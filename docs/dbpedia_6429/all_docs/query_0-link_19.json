TABB: Will you please take your seats? I think it is time for us to begin.\n\nGood morning. I am Winston Tabb, the Associate Librarian, Library of Congress and I am pleased to welcome all of you to the Library of Congress' third and final hearing on the Current State of American Television and Video Preservation.\n\nI want to remind all of you to sign the guest register just outside the back of the room, please.\n\nThe purpose of this hearing is to get specific suggestions for the Library of Congress to consider in preparing the comprehensive national program on American television and video preservation for the United States Congress.\n\nThe pertinent issues include what should be saved, who is doing it, who should do it, what are the technical preservation standards and problems, how to be assured that they are addressed and perhaps most important, how to fund--what funding models seem most promising.\n\nThis hearing is undertaken in accordance with the directive of Congress to the Library of Congress to \"establish and maintain in the Library of Congress, a library as an American television and radio archives. \"The purpose of the archives shall be to preserve a permanent record of the television and radio programs which are the heritage of the people of the United States and provide access to such programs to historians and scholars without encouraging or causing copyright infringement.\"\n\nI regret that the person who is responsible for accomplishing this objective of the Library of Congress, Dr. Billington, has been called away from Washington today, but he has asked that I read the remarks that he just made at the two previous hearings that we have held in Los Angeles and New York. So, I am going to read this for the record. STATEMENT OF DR. BILLINGTON, PRESENTED BY WINSTON TABB\n\nMR. TABB: Not long ago, I was a witness before our House Appropriations Committee and I am happy to tell you that it is much better to be on this side of table listening to other people testify.\n\nToday's hearing may not carry the legal and fiscal implications of a Congressional hearing, but it is an important event for the Library of Congress and the archival community and for everyone who shares our concern about preservation of our television and video legacy.\n\nOur first two public hearings held in Los Angeles and New York were very productive. The panels there heard statements from archives, major studios, networks and educators and from others who share our goals.\n\nWe hear encouraging reports from the major producers of prime-time programming, because as commercial enterprises, they have sufficient economic incentives to maintain their materials under reasonably good conditions and thus ensure availability for future use.\n\nOn the other hand, we heard from much smaller organizations with little or no resources to safeguard and preserve the valuable television and video materials in their care.\n\nAs might be expected, the witnesses expressed views and opinions as varied as the organizations they represented, a testament in itself to how television and video has become embedded in American life and culture.\n\nThis is the last of three public hearings the Library of Congress will conduct this month. These are intended to help develop a report on the Current State of American Television and Video Preservation and even more important, a plan listing recommendations.\n\nBoth the report and plan will be published later this year as a single document. This activity is authorized under the American Television and Radio Act of 1976 and is being pursued in response to a recommendation from the National Film Preservation Board and from many groups and individuals who helped draft Redefining Film Preservation: A National Plan, which the Library published in 1994.\n\nThe American Television and Radio Act authorizes the Library of Congress to establish and maintain an archives whose purpose is to preserve a permanent record of the broadcast programs which are our heritage.\n\nThese hearings and the report to follow will help the Library develop the actual policies to ensure that we can carry out this work in concert with other archives and libraries and with production and broadcast organizations.\n\nThese hearings and the report parallel our earlier film preservation study in several important ways. First, we seek the same goals. That is, to preserve the American television and video heritage and make it more accessible for educational use.\n\nSecond, we wish to obtain a wide range of views and opinions representative of the diverse interest that exists in the creation, preservation and research use of moving images in all its aspects, including arts and entertainment, news and documentary, public affairs, video art and community video, just to name some of the large categories.\n\nThird, we wish to encourage other archives and libraries to work with us to accomplish the very difficult task of preserving television and video and making them available.\n\nFinally, we wish to address the problems of funding television and video preservation programs both in public archives and industry, which is no easy task at a time when resources are scarce, particularly relative to the preservation workload ahead.\n\nPublic-private partnerships are essential. During the course of these hearings, we hope to receive your recommendations on how this partnership can be established.\n\nThere are other parallels with the film preservation report worth mentioning. Like American film, much of the early history of television has already been lost. Broadcasts were live and kinescope or film recordings were used selectively.\n\nAmpex introduced videotape recording technology in 1956 and since then the industry has manufactured or adopted numerous incompatible video formats, making technological obsolescence a major archival issue.\n\nLike nitrocellulose, the staple of the film industry until 1951, videotape has proven to be both a blessing and a curse. We have entrusted our historical and cultural images to videotape and yet it is highly vulnerable to degradation and destruction.\n\nLike film, everything associated with vide preservation is expensive, including specialize storage facilities, electronic equipment, a skilled technical staff and reformatting costs.\n\nThe very notion of reformatting large collections of videotape is a daunting one, because their volume already exceeds the means of most organizations.\n\nYet the rewards for safeguarding and preserving our television and video heritage are immeasurable. No one can fully understand who we are as a people and what we have become as a society without having access to the recordings created by television and video production during the last 50 years.\n\nHistorians, sociologists and other scholars, even politicians and parents, debate the causal relationship of television to the society at large. In the future, such debates will be fruitless if the historical evidence does not survive.\n\nIn conclusion, the Library of Congress encourages all of you at the audience to write down your opinions and recommendations which we will collect up until April 29.\n\nToday we will hear from a number of distinguished individuals, some professionals in the field, others representing important organizations that share our goal of preserving American television and video.\n\nOn behalf of the Library of Congress, I want to thank all of you who have taken time from your busy schedules to participate in this event and especially those of you who have come from out of town at your own expense. We appreciate your interest and concern and will ensure that your efforts are not in vain.\n\nMR. TABB: Before we actually begin the hearing, I want to take a few minutes to thank those who have been most responsible for getting us here today. One is sitting beside me, David Francis, who is chief of the Library's Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division.\n\nSteve Leggett, who is standing at the back, always ready to jump and help us do whatever needs to be done. Finally, Bill Murphy, who is on loan to us from the National Archives and Records Administration, serving this year as our project coordinator.\n\nI would now like to introduce our panelists. I already mentioned David, who is on my left. On my right is Frank Burke who is now Professor at the University of Maryland, the College of Library and Information Science, but also is known to many of us as the former acting archivist of the United States.\n\nIt gives me particular pleasure to introduce to all of you--most of who may know Barbara already--Barbara Ringer, who is the Register of Copyrights Emerita, but I think also for today we should refer to her as the mother of this ATRA Act.\n\nSomeone who is very responsible for getting this law enacted and who has waited very patiently for 20 years for the Library to really take this as seriously as we ought to have done. So this is both a public apology, Barbara, and a thank you for coming and helping us continue this work that you began so long ago.\n\nMS. RINGER: My pleasure.\n\nMR. TABB: Now just a few minutes on the ground rules. We are very pleased that 26 people have asked to testify today, but given our time restraints, we will have to ask that everyone make their remarks in ten minutes or less and try to focus particularly on suggestions, not just on description.\n\nI will be fairly ruthless in wielding the gavel to be sure that the panel that is scheduled for the end of the day is not short changed.\n\nWe have organized the speakers into panels representing different focuses of our study and I will ask that each panel come to the table together and then let the speakers present their testimony in the order listed in the program that we distributed out in the lobby.\n\nAt this table, we will hold our questions until the end of each panel, unless there is a need for clarification about something that we cannot understand at all.\n\nAfter all the speakers on the panel have given their prepared statements, I will invite my colleagues here to ask follow-up questions during the balance of the time allotted to that group.\n\nAll written comments and the transcripts of the proceedings today will be printed and available to the public as an appendix to the report that we submit to Congress later this year.\n\nI remind you again that we will invite the speakers, observers, anyone else who has a strong interest in this matter, to submit written comments to Steve Leggett of our Motion Picture Division by April 29. The hearing record will remain open until that time.\n\nAll right. Now we will begin by calling our first two panelists. Will you please come forward to the table?\n\nWe are glad to welcome as our first panel Gerald George, who is the executive director of the National Historical Publications and Records Commission on which I am also pleased to serve as a member.\n\nA special welcome to George Stevens, Jr., formerly a member of the National Film Preservation Board and a long time friend to the Library of Congress.\n\nWill you go ahead and begin, Jerry? STATEMENT OF GERALD GEORGE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS AND RECORDS COMMISSION\n\nMR. GEORGE: Thank you very much, Commissioner Tabb. I am glad that you called attention to the fact that you are a member of my Commission and with you at the table, along with Dr. Burke, my predecessor as director of NHPRC once removed, I feel very comfortable on this occasion.\n\nIn fact, if you have a number of questions I cannot answer, I not only will enlist the services of Ms. Laurie Baty, a program officer with the Commission who is with me, but I may very well just turn them over to Dr. Burke.\n\nMy testimony, by the way, will be within your ten-minute limit so there should be no problem.\n\nI am, as you said, executive director of the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, which is better known by its more easily remembered initials, the NHPRC.\n\nI congratulate the Library of Congress on its initiative in gathering information on the current state of American television and video preservation and I certainly welcome this opportunity to contribute.\n\nThe subject is one that has long concerned and in many ways perplexed my Commission and I will be speaking primarily to the funding questions--the funding parts of your information gathering agenda.\n\nOur concern arises from the Commission's mission. When the Congress created the National Archives in 1934, it also created the NHPRC. It housed us within the National Archives and it charged us with promoting nationwide the preservation and publication of documents of particular importance for understanding American history.\n\nIn time, the Congress began appropriating some funds from which we could even make grants so that we could do more than just advocate attention to the source material on which historical study depends.\n\nFor awhile this seemed fairly simple. The NHPRC helped launch projects to publish the scholarly editions of the papers of Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Edison, John Adams and Jane Addams and more recently of Dwight Eisenhower and Martin Luther King, just to take some examples.\n\nBut at the same time, we had some remarkable revelations. It has dawned on historians that America cannot be understood simply from the activities of its most exalted leaders and now it has dawned on us all that even for understanding those leaders, the best sources are not exclusively what they wrote.\n\nPhotographers, film makers, and video broadcasters have led us to that insight. They have handed historians an incredible resource--the actual person, the words as delivered, the unfolding event, all captured in images and most importantly in moving images.\n\nTonight's evening news documents contemporary history at every level. It also supports creation of the visual records own pedagogical form--the film or television documentary--which itself has expanded public access to historical insight far beyond the book, the lecture and the classroom.\n\nWhat would we not give to have moving images from earlier times. How stirred we would be if archaeologists in ancient Rome turned up a canister of filmed reports by Walter Cronkitus or Daniel Ratheronius on debates in the Roman forum, spectacles in the Coliseum, Hannibal's crossing the Alps, Caesar's campaigns in Gaul and the daily concerns, say, of the ordinary \"classical\" family. No effort would seem too great to preserve such an unexpected glimpse of ancient history as it actually was. So why be careless with the recorded images we are making of our own history?\n\nAccordingly, the NHPRC long ago, even during the days of Dr. Burke, recognized the value of television and video preservation for historical documentation, and we have acted on that recognition.\n\nIn 1987, the NHPRC granted funds to the American Film Institute's National Center for Film and Video Preservation to convene a national conference to plan for improving the care of local television news film collections and providing access to them.\n\nMore than 40 institutions, I understand, with collections of newsfilm sent representatives to this conference, the published proceedings of which expanded attention to news film collections and their preservation needs.\n\nIn 1991, the NHPRC gave another grant to the National Center for Film and Video Preservation, this time to help it create a local television news film curatorial manual. Persons with responsibility for collections of news film will find much- needed guidance in this manual for acquiring, organizing, preserving, cataloging, and providing access to moving-image materials.\n\nThese two projects for the National Center for Film and Video Preservation have not cost a huge amount of money--less than $100,000 from the NHPRC. But they have helped the Center organize attention to the need and then publish guidance for dealing with it.\n\nAlso, the NHPRC has invested nearly a half-million dollars of its grant funds in 11 projects to preserve collections of newsfilm and provide access to them in individual repositories. I am appending a list of those projects to this testimony, if that is agreeable.\n\nFrom New York to California, from North Dakota to Mississippi, future scholars and the public are going to be able to get at least some glimpses of what life was like in 20th- century America and what our history looked like as it happened, thanks to the work of NHPRC grantees with news film and video collections.\n\nWe are proud of this record, but we recognize that it is a token. We have had enough money to help a few institutions save a few runs of newsfilm for posterity out of the millions of feet of material that television broadcasters produce every month.\n\nThe NHPRC's entire appropriation for grants this year is just $5,000,000, with which we have to try to meet all kinds of documentary preservation needs across the entire nation.\n\nWe are grateful to have even that much, but for perspective, please consider this. The published accounts of the production costs of Oliver Stone's latest historical film indicate that NHPRC's grant budget this year could have financed little more than 20 minutes of it and the entire cost was equal to our appropriations total for the last eight years.\n\nOur era in history is the first that is able to document itself in moving images recorded as words were spoken and events occurred, but there is far more videotape and news film than there is money for their preservation. When an agency with resources no larger than the NHPRC's is a leading funder of moving image preservation, the limitations come clearly into view. Obviously we must press the argument for increasing the financing and I hope my remarks will be useful for that purpose.\n\nBut at the same time we must consider rigorously how we can use more meaningfully the funds we have, and I am not just talking about squeezing efficiencies out of projects. At the NHPRC, we are proud of our grant program processes. In evaluation applications for grants for video preservation and access, we judge the relative historical value of the collections to be preserved and the competence of the applicant institutions, and we fund as many projects as we can that score high on those tests. But we are asking ourselves a lot of questions. What material does not come into institutional collections whose directors write grant proposals? What are we missing? How much film and videotape of value is being destroyed or lost for future use while we are doing what we can to save a little? Is it possible to devise a documentary strategy for news film preservation of a kind that people are experimenting with in some other areas? What can we do to assure the people of this nation something more than a haphazard visual record of its remarkable history?\n\nThese are questions with which the Commission itself currently is struggling, and they need collaborative attention if we are to do anything more than request additional funding.\n\nThat is my view of where things stand, and I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to your study. More than anything else, besides attention to the real funding needs, I think we also need to work out some means, some set of priorities, some collectively agreed upon standards for being sure that what we do preserve is what in fact is the most useful and most important with the very small resources that I have indicated we have.\n\nThe National Historical Publications and Records Commission will welcome opportunities to work on this problem with the Library of Congress and any other organization concerned with saving the nation's irreplaceable cultural resources. We look forward to the outcome of the deliberations on which you are embarked. Thank you very much.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you, Jerry. Mr. Stevens? STATEMENT OF GEORGE STEVENS, JR., INDEPENDENT PRODUCER\n\nMR. STEVENS: Thank you. I come here as a film maker, writer, producer and director and a friend of the work that the Library has been doing both in the field of motion picture preservation and now this new initiative in television.\n\nWhen I was a young man in Hollywood cutting my teeth in the film world, there were few opportunities to see the films of the past. The studios that produced the films felt that what had gone before was past and all attention was paid to producing the hit pictures for the present.\n\nThe result was that the movies made during the first 50 years of the film industry were ignored. A majority of them were allowed to deteriorate in vaults or were melted down to recover the silver content of the negatives.\n\nWhen I had the opportunity to start the American Film Institute in 1967, we made motion picture preservation our first priority. Though there were many films that we would never be able to find and others that were too deteriorated to preserve, we were successful in rallying a vanguard to the idea of rescuing and conserving our motion picture heritage and preserving films that otherwise would have been lost.\n\nAmong the legacies of that beginning are the over 20,000 feature films in the AFI collection in the Library of Congress and, equally important, the national awareness that the art and history that exists on motion picture film are essential aspects of the country's intellectual treasure and cultural heritage.\n\nIt became apparent to me during our work on film preservation in the early 1970's that there was another sphere of American creativity and communication that was beginning to be lost in the same way as the early motion pictures.\n\nTelevision, which had taken its place on the American stage and was to a large degree eclipsing movie going as a pastime, was becoming a unique and primary record of our times and what the historian, Eric Barnouw, likened to \"America's central nervous system.\"\n\nBut television was plunging forward with hardly any concern for the fact that it was also a large part of the historical record of our times.\n\nWe set out in 1975 to try to bring together the networks, producers and other institutions in a collaborative effort to focus on the preservation of our television heritage.\n\nWhile that initiative called attention to the problem, there was little interest from government agencies, foundations and the industry. So today we really face a problem that has grown through the years.\n\nWhen Bill Murphy invited me to testify at these hearings he told me that he had uncovered an article that I had written for the Washington Post in 1975. Fortunately the article was published on paper. I am certain that if it had been recorded on video it would have been lost in the intervening 21 years.\n\nMr. Murphy sent me the article in which I went on at greater length than I intend to today (three cheers for good judgment that comes with age) describing the horror stories of lost programs and the peril that continued inattention to saving and preserving television broadcasts would bring.\n\nThe article noted, for example, that by 1975 NBC had retained and catalogued 17,799 hours of programming, which was about seven percent of its total programming. 107,835 hours of NBC programming were listed simply as not retained.\n\nFrom that day to this, a span of 21 years, the networks and stations have each day been producing programs and one suspects not doing much better in preserving them, particularly since the last decade has been a period of downsizing that caused considerable reduction of staff and infrastructure at the major networks.\n\nDuring the years when the AFI, the Library of Congress, George Eastman House and the Museum of Modern Art served as a public interest consortium working to preserve our motion picture heritage, it is not an exaggeration to say we were viewed, at best, as a nuisance and, at worst, with hostility by the film studios whose motion pictures we were working to preserve.\n\nThat situation has much improved today. Most of the studios have created special vaults for storing their films and are instituting preservation standards and procedures.\n\nUnfortunately, this awakening to the value and importance of the films they own came too late to save many of the finest motion pictures ever made.\n\nI believe it is important to understand how this change in attitude at the major studios came about. The job description of the individuals now in charge of preservation is revealing. They are not given the traditional title of archivist. They are designated vice-presidents in charge of asset management.\n\nThe change in attitude came only when the studio owners realized that these old films that the public archives had been working to preserve for several decades had, with the arrival of home video, become assets.\n\nI make this point because I believe television preservation is going to present a new set of problems. So much of the television material that must be saved is in the area of news and recorded history and I do not believe that the nightly news or the coverage of the Vietnam War or the advances in American science will ever have the asset value comparable to Casablanca or Singin' in the Rain.\n\nThe volume of existing material which needs to be preserved is staggering. The cost of preserving it will be great and each day and each year new material of value is being created.\n\nSo it seems to me that the admirable effort that Dr. Billington and the Library have undertaken will require special gifts of persuasion and organization. There can be no question that it is in the national interest for the view of our times as seen on television to be preserved.\n\nWhen thinking about conserving that which is timeless, it seems sensible to look to the wisdom of the ancients. It was Cicero who said, \"History is the witness of the times, the torch of the truth, the life of memory, the teacher of life, the messenger of antiquity.\"\n\nWitness, memory, teacher and messenger, television is all of those things. Failure to preserve it will deny future generations of Americans vital legacy.\n\nPreserving it will be a formidable task and it will require leadership at the national level at a time when national leadership is questioned, when the argument is to make all things local.\n\nThis is one example where national leadership must be the driving force to encourage the other institutions across the country to do what is necessary for the public good.\n\nI salute the Library for its leadership. I of course pledge my cooperation and urge all institutions to collaborate in this most significant task. Thanks very much.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you. Question, David?\n\nMR. BURKE: For Jerry George. The two major projects that you talked about were the grant for a plan given to the American Film Institute's National Center Film and Video Preservation and the curatorial manual.\n\nAs opposed to the other kinds of grants which are parcelling out small funds here and there for the preservation of local network material or local television materials at separate institutions, do you see the national role more one of stimulating bringing people together and planning and programming so that it can be carried out, rather than providing funds on individual preservation bases when there are so many of those projects that could be done?\n\nMR. GEORGE: The answer to that is, yes, for both policy and pragmatic reasons. With appropriations at the level that ours have been, vis-a-vis the problems with which we are trying to help, advocacy must be a major part of the Commission's activity; bringing people together to try to solve problems for the field as a whole must be part of the activity. Making accessible nationwide the fruits of the products that we do fund, that is to say things that can be used by others, must be a major part of our activity, yes.\n\nWe do a great deal of that in the archival field in particular, and the two grants that you mentioned are representative of that.\n\nMR. BURKE: Is that a pattern that you think that other government agencies or other government funding units should follow?\n\nMR. GEORGE: Well, yes and no. The National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts, some of the other federal agencies that have programs in conservation of cultural resources or preservation of cultural resources should help to the extent that they have sufficient funds to help specific projects. I mean those funds are needed if we are going to preserve anything.\n\nBut I think with our Commission in particular, given the Congressional mandate that as you know we were given to promote this kind of activity, as well as to make grants in support of it, we have a special role there, to look out for documentary preservation as a whole, and to encourage, promote, and advocate the attention of others, as well as ourselves, to these needs.\n\nWhat other agencies will do in the reduced circumstance that many of them are facing, I do not know. In our own case, however many dollars we have, we also have a Congressional mandate to advocate and to help the field bring itself together around these problems and that is what we will continue to do.\n\nMR. BURKE: Thank you.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: Throughout these hearings we have heard particular concern expressed about local news film archives. As it is almost ten years since the Madison Conference you funded, I wondered whether you would consider the idea of funding another meeting, to take up the matter you raised about a strategy for newsfilm preservation.\n\nIf we could parcel off a small part of the problem and ask for the assistance of an organization like yours, it would be extremely helpful.\n\nI do not know whether you feel that is something that would fit within your terms of reference, but I think it would be extremely useful.\n\nMR. GEORGE: Well, there is no question about it that we would be interested. I say that in hope of Commissioner Tabb's blessing on that rather firm pronouncement, but I think I may say that safely, because the NHPRC makes its grants in accordance with the strategic plan that we implemented some three years ago, which sets forth categories by priority of what we want to fund and what we want to help bring about. Within that strategic plan, one of its objectives is to attempt to form or assist collaborative endeavors to deal with some of these issues.\n\nIf someone were to put together a very strong grant proposal to try to establish priorities for newsfilm preservation or work out a documentary strategy for that purpose with which a number of others were agreed, we would be most interested in that kind of proposal. The sooner it comes the better, given the vagaries of the funding situation, but yes, we would be interested.\n\nMS. RINGER: Let me make a few personal remarks to begin with. I cannot tell you how gratified I am to see this initiative being taken in the Library, even if it is 20 years late.\n\nI have felt exactly the way you all obviously feel for many, many years. As a staff member of the Library of Congress, I was aware that the policies and practices here in the 1960's and 1970's, when the problem of television news archives was beginning to come to a boil, were hit or miss. Acquisition policies were largely based on copyright deposits and were a very hodgepodge business.\n\nAn opportunity arose when the big revision of the copyright law was going through in the mid-1970's. Because of the Vanderbilt litigation and Senator Baker's interest in it, there was a way to open the door for the Library of Congress to develop a national archive. It is amazing to me the hostility that produced here and elsewhere.\n\nThe Congressional mandate was there, but the implementation did not get off the ground. I was aware of the institutional hostility and I had other things to do. I did not try to push it that hard, because I could not. It was just not possible.\n\nBut I was aware that sooner or later the tape would come around again and people would realize the opportunity they were missing and try to do something about it. It is a pity that we are encountering this new positive attitude now, at a time when we do not have any money.\n\nHas there been any thought of private funding, major private funding, by foundations, individuals and corporations? I know there is no such thing as a free lunch in this. If people give you money they want something in return. That is human nature. But, nevertheless, is there any major current activity to find funding sources?\n\nMR. GEORGE: Well, Mr. Stevens may be able to speak to that more effectively.\n\nMS. RINGER: I am asking my question to both of you.\n\nMR. GEORGE: This would be my response. Within the Commission, with our grants, we made a calculation recently that told us that for every dollar, every federal dollar we spend on the projects we support, there are two other dollars from other sources in their budgets and most of those are private dollars. The grant applicants who come to us frequently show, and in fact we look for this and encourage this, that they have approached private sources and are trying to build their budgets in that way. That makes a great deal of difference to us, because if we can co-fund a project, that gets more mileage out of our own few dollars.\n\nBut you know, I think, as well as I do, that this is a very difficult time for private sector fund raising, as well, if only because of the volume of the number of institutions there of all kinds that are turning to private corporations and foundations for support, and in part because of their losing funds from public revenue sources.\n\nSo the competition there is fierce as well as for our dollars. Whether we have adequately tapped the possibilities for private sector funding in this area, I do not know, but I do know that while I would certainly encourage efforts to do more private sector fund raising, I am also keenly aware that there are limits to what can be expected.\n\nThat again is what brings me back to recommending to you the consideration of some kind of documentary strategy in this area as in others, because however much additional funds we are able to generate from whatever sources, they are not going to be enough to save all the collections that people would like to save.\n\nMr. Stevens may wish to speak to private funding. I do not know.\n\nMR. STEVENS: Well, maybe not that, but I think that word \"strategy,\" which David picked up which you advanced and David Francis picked up on is so important.\n\nI think the Library is doing exactly the right thing. I think this process of calling all of these institutions, giving them an opportunity to testify, which in turn causes them to assess when they are doing, to create an awareness within the community that is concerned or should be concerned with this activity.\n\nI think it is exactly the right thing to do and I think the key beyond that is persistence. I think that if you can set a mechanism where something will happen every six months or every year that it reminds people of this obligation and the importance of it.\n\nI think gradually the good work will be done. Obviously, the idea would be sweeping funding and to apply it and systematically get all of this done, but that will not happen and failing that, I think individual and institutional initiative.\n\nDavid Francis and I were talking earlier about the motion picture preservation and just to speak briefly of it, I realize that while during the time I was running the American Film Institute and we were concerning ourselves with the great films and the lost films of the teens, 20's, 30's, 40's, it never occurred to me that at the very time I was doing that, the classics that my father had made in the 50's and 60's were going to deteriorate.\n\nI set off some alarm bells a few years ago when I testified here and said that the negative to A Place in the Sun had been lost. Paramount got up in arms.\n\nI must say in the intervening two years, I told Sherry Lansing, who is the chairman of Paramount, about it and she said, \"We will do everything possible to preserve A Place in the Sun-- and they are doing it. They are spending a lot of money on it.\n\nWhat I am leading towards is I think that there is an aspect of this that individual producers, directors, creators should be encouraged to watch out for their own films.\n\nI think they should be brought into your councils and reminded, because I now realize as I am working on my father's films and films that I have made that are at these companies, I realize that they are not quite sure where those are and they are only 12, 14 years old.\n\nI think one new idea is to encourage individuals to understand that it is part of their responsibility to find out where their films are. In that line, I would just say that most of us who make films do not think that way, because we have not had the experience.\n\nIt does not occur to us. That we are moving along doing the next one. We have just done our 24th American Film Institute Life Achievement Award show and we did our 18th Kennedy Center Honors.\n\nI mean the case of the Kennedy Center Honors, I know I am the only one who knows where the tapes are and they are only preserved because I ask the question every couple of years. Where are these things? What quality are they? Have we transferred the early ones to the standard?\n\nThat is just a suggestion that individuals be encouraged and informed and brought into this.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: I want to follow up on that. I wonder whether, if we worked together, we could look at the television programs you have produced and see how well they have been preserved. The results could form an appendix to the report. It could be a model for others to follow.\n\nI do not know whether you would be agreeable to that. It would be a very powerful addition to the report.\n\nMR. STEVENS: David, at the risk of great personal embarrassment, when we discovered that what I have said is not true, I would welcome it. We should be happy to do that. You just tell me how we need to proceed.\n\nMR. TABB: All right. Thank you very much. We appreciate your testimony.\n\nI will invite to the table the next group of panelists, our educators. Before I invite the panelists of this group to begin speaking, I would like to take one moment to introduce a very distinguished member of our audience.\n\nMr. Bob Saudek, the former chief of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division and a distinguished pioneer of the industry that we are hearing so much about today. Bob, we are very glad to see you and glad that you joined us today. All right. Let's begin with Mr. Culbert. STATEMENT OF DAVID CULBERT, INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR MEDIA AND HISTORY (IAMHIST), EDITOR HISTORICAL JOURNAL OF FILM, RADIO AND TELEVISION, PROFESSOR OF HISTORY, LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY, BATON ROUGE\n\nMR. CULBERT: I would say that the issue for the preservation of television video is much more acute than the issue for the preservation of film and I think this point has already been underscored.\n\nI was re-reading the testimony from the 1993 hearings before coming up here and my colleague and friend, Doug Gomery, made that very point even while testifying about film. Preservation of television is a more acute problem.\n\nI am very concerned about the disappearance of local television news, as well as issues of access, but I thought it also would be helpful to underscore, for example, the difficulties encountered in scholarly use of television and video materials.\n\nThe historical profession we historians know is acutely conservative. It is my understanding that situation in the United States is not different in the United Kingdom and is not different in Germany. The historical profession for the most part is not dominated by persons whose central research interests have to do with the mass media; scholarly preferment goes primarily to persons publishing books in areas that do not in fact make the issue of mass media a central concern.\n\nThe journal which I edit, the Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, opens its pages to those who wish to be published without payment, the same pay that brings me here to these hearings (I will be getting my Greyhound bus ticket back home in just a few hours.).\n\nThe fact is that of submissions to that journal, if I may add statistical precision to what is primarily a seat-of-the- pants estimate, I would say 70% of the submissions which I receive have as the subject of inquiry film, 20% television, and 10% radio, that 10% being perhaps adjusted upwards.\n\nThe fact is that television is not being studied in an important way by scholars who ought to include it in writing about topics that deal with the 20th century. For television, let us say from 1950 on, scholars are not making use of video materials in their writing, or if they do, they are relying on print summaries, which all-too-often are by persons writing for style sections offering impressions of these programs.\n\nA book which deals centrally with media-related issues, saying nothing about the visual part of video materials, may very well receive splendid reviews by those who do not believe that it is important for a book dealing with television or the impact of television on political decision-making to analyze the visual component of visual materials.\n\nI would suggest that in giving thought to what needs to be preserved, it would be very useful to study, shall we say, the footnotes in the scholarly apparatus of scholars who have in fact made use of video materials in their research.\n\nNow to the issue of funding. I remember Jim Billington indicating that everyone was in favor of film preservation in the 1993 hearings, but who is to pay for it. The opening of a West Coast Museum of Television and Broadcasting suggests, not surprisingly, that though it is always hard to shake a buck out of someone, some persons can do this, even if the funding of a fine building is always easier than finding funding for other things. To those who suggest that there is no money in the private sector it seems to me the answer is that an expensive building was just put up.\n\nI would suggest that since people like to have things named after them, I do not see why it is inherently impossible not to consider naming someone who is providing substantial funding for the preservation and transfer of video; perhaps each cassette should have on it \"given thanks to the support of.\"\n\nIt is not true that it is impossible to get funding for video preservation, but I think we all agree that it is easier to find funding to put up a building, though that is hard, than funding for preservation.\n\nThe issue of access is not being effectively dealt with in my opinion by the industry itself. I am talking about access for scholars who could take the pledge: I would like to be rich if I knew how, but I ended up in the world of scholarship because I do not know how to get rich.\n\nYears ago, when CBS was riding high, it had an imperious, oft-iterated slogan, \"CBS does not sell the face or voice of a network commentator.\" Well, now it will. Bill Murphy alerted me to this welcome change from the good old days. I decided to spend my money as an educator so I faxed CBS archvist Doug McKinney to see if I could get something that I need for classroom use.\n\nBack indeed came a fax saying that CBS would sell me, since I had provided the name of the program and the exact date, a CBS program for classroom use only.\n\nThe cost would be $100 an hour; I should prepay $207 using a credit card and the material could not be returned for any reason whatsoever and it would take six weeks.\n\nI am happy to say that they got the material to me promptly, but there are not very many persons, myself included, who would regularly spend what might seem to someone as a very small sum, but not to a person who feels that the purchase of video materials on the home video market at $9.95 or $19.95 for things that people use in classrooms is a reasonable sum. $100 an hour without knowledge of what one is getting would suggest that CBS considers scholarly access a profit-making operation.\n\nMy next concern is the issue of frame enlargements and stills and I am very concerned about this. My proposal would be that the American Radio and Television Act be amended so as to provide scholarly use and reproduction of frame enlargements and stills for video as well as for film.\n\nI have been interested in this subject and it seems very clear to me that no one is prepared to be the test case and instead we are here dealing with what I would characterize as government inertia.\n\nI am not at all satisfied with the explanation that this is an area that is in doubt and we do not know. I have brought with me and thought I would submit to you examples of the technological problems involved in making frame enlargements. For video, particularly in dealing with copies that may be made from poor-quality video cassettes, the technical capacity of the reproduction of a freeze frame image is such that it is sometimes almost impossible, using the best technology, to get an image that is of sufficient quality to meet the standards of a large press's art department.\n\nI have in the journal in which I edit been very keen to accepting articles about television and have in fact found that video frame enlargements can be used and that they are sufficiently clear so that one can see the image.\n\nNow the matter of permissions from Hollywood studios. I have brought with me an example of what I consider to be a rather rapacious standard contract provided by 20th Century Fox. I thought 20th Century Wolf might be a better description. Someone has dreamed up a standard contract which made me an offer I could refuse.\n\nSince nobody knows whether frame enlargements and/or stills can or cannot be used without written permission, 20th Century Fox says when in doubt hit them for all you can get.\n\nWith this contract I conclude my remarks. \"The licensee may not use the stills on the cover.\" In the section for releases, \"written releases from all individuals whose likenesses or performances are contained in the stills\" are required. All persons. How about a crowd scene?\n\n\"Written releases from any unions or guilds, to the extent required under applicable collective bargaining agreements\" are required in connection with the use of the stills.\n\nPoor Professor X has to ascertain whether these bargaining arrangements are or are not applicable. You can imagine that the union, hard up for money these days, will want its own fee and a censorship clause.\n\n\"The publication shall not be derogatory to or critical of the entertainment industry or of Fox or any officer, director, agent, employee, affiliate, parent or subsidiary of Fox or of any motion picture produced or distributed by Fox and the stills will not be used in a manner which would be derogatory to or critical of the motion picture from which the stills were taken or to the persons involved with the making of the motion picture from which the stills were taken.\"\n\nIt is certainly an invitation, shall we say, to an appreciative approach to the history of the entertainment history in America, but it is preposterous.\n\nThe situation is very clear. It is unclear. There is no clear sense of what constitutes fair use. There is no consensus amongst publishers. I brought with me examples that I thought I should at least leave anonymous, lest the publishers ride me out of town on a rail for naming names, but I happen to have these names and have the documents.\n\nThis lack of consensus is not based on hearsay. Press X says, you may use frame enlargements, but not stills, without permission from the copyright holder. Press Y says, you may use stills, but not frame enlargements. Press Z, one that I have worked with and others at this table have worked with, says if you do not have everything in triplicate, you cannot use anything.\n\nI submit to you that this is a very serious brake on our conservative historical profession's analysis of a visual medium. When you make it so incredibly difficult to even think about reproducing a video enlargement you effectively leave a visual medium consigned to a position in which the visual can only be described in words, if that. Thanks to the technical limitations of video frame enlargements, the visual almost never appears in the writing about television. Historians must have fair use of video frame enlargements, and film frame enlargements in writing about film and television. The Copyright Act must be clarified by the federal government. That is more than ten minutes.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you very much. Mr. Gomery, welcome back. STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS GOMERY, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK, PROFESSOR, COLLEGE OF JOURNALISM\n\nMR. GOMERY: Thank you. I will try to do less than ten minutes, although I know we academics are programmed for 50 minutes. So this will require everything that I can summon up.\n\nIn that spirit, I will not read. I will try to make my couple of points. Just to start with, I want to agree in a general yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. We are losing things as we speak faster than they can be saved.\n\nYes, frame enlargement is absolutely a very important position. I once worked on a book on Disney in which there is no reproductions of a Disney film or television show, because Disney would not sign off on the condition that we \"had something derogatory to say about them\".\n\nWe should save the news absolutely. I think the general point which is very, very important is that and I am very sympathetic with 20th Century Fox. These are profit centers. These are profit making corporations.\n\nThey are not in the business of archival work nor do they pretend to be. That is an ancillary product of what they do.\n\nSo with those yes's, I want to make just two larger points. I know my colleagues are going to eloquently say I think things that are very important so I would like to say things that I think are over arching and I suppose to the public would be what old fuddy duddy tenure professors can say and get away with and raise that others will not, because they feel they are running a journal or doing something else. This is what my mother told me tenure was for.\n\nI think we should try to save everything. I think one of the things that worries me a lot is this whole value system. The value system is, we are all familiar with it, hierarchy one is historical figures in the news.\n\nIf I had a reproduction of Napoleon, would it not be wonderful? That is what I call it. I think that is really to short for future.\n\nTo try to shock the group here, I agree with Newt Gingrich, a former professor, when he says we ought to worry a lot about what we present to future generations. I think that this is not saving the budget for future generations. This is passing them a cultural legacy that if we erase it, it is not there.\n\nSo it is very, very important and I think it is very important that we do not lose sight of values of what is important. I was struck writing this testimony you think about how much struggle I had getting into the Vermeer exhibit.\n\nNow if you go back and study Vermeer's life, you understand that we do not even know how many paintings Vermeer produced in his life. There is a wonderful book in which they estimate 57.3.\n\nWhile we have a certain number that we know and they did a wonderful job collecting those together, but we do not even know what was left. My imagination was, would it not be wonderful if the Dutch had had a preservation program back when Vermeer died or the guilds or the unions or somebody had said, maybe we should save some of this stuff.\n\nThis guy Vermeer is not important now, but maybe in a few hundred years people will line up around the block and bribe their Congressmen to get in and push and shove, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nSo, I think we should be very careful of what we think is valuable to pass on to future generations. One of my current obsessions is Patsy Cline. Someone who falls far lower in the value structure than news, et cetera, et cetera, but Patsy Cline is the largest selling female recording artist for country music in history.\n\nHer greatest hits album is selling now at 750,000 copies per year. She has been dead for 33 years. People are going in basements trying to discovery stuff. Well, Patsy Cline was on Washington, D.C. television every week, every Saturday night for a year and a half.\n\nDo we have any record of that? Absolutely not. Zero. So the same way that poor Vermeer may have painted masterpieces that we will never know about because they were not saved and were scattered about and not valued at the time, Vermeer did not paint famous people, Vermeer did not paint what we considered to be important subjects.\n\nHe had painted streets and little subjects and rooms. My favorite, the Milkmaid, a person pouring milk. I mean that is not going to make a lot of money. That is not a valued subject in his day and of course it disappeared.\n\nWhy should we expect it? Patsy Cline has disappeared, too. So what do we say to the public who buys her album? One out of every nine households in the United States has a Patsy Cline album. What do we say to that public?\n\nWould it not be nice that we had some visual record of what she actually performed like? Well, unfortunately we do not. The same in Washington, D.C. TV as for Walter Cronkite and others.\n\nOn an absolutely personal note, I interviewed Bob Dalton who has been on Washington TV for 30 years recently and Bob Dalton has the sum of his lifetime work, 30 years on American television, daily journalism in nine videotapes sitting on his couch. Nine.\n\nI said, Bob, is this it? He said, yes, this is it. Eight were from the 1990's. One videotape from 1952 to 1990. That is unconscionable.\n\nSo first big point by the tenured professor is do not think small. Please do not think small. Do not give the values of our generation to our children and our grandchildren and their great grandchildren. Please do not do that.\n\nI know money is tight. I know things are hard. I know it is difficult. Life is difficult, but I think if we narrow it now, they will never have it. We lose, if you want a fancy term what the economists call option value.\n\nIf we destroyed Yellowstone Park in 1916, we would not have the option of having it generation after generation and that brings me to my second point. Money.\n\nI am a trained economist. So I try to think about this. I proposed several years ago a one-percent tax on all movies. Movie tickets, movie rentals, et cetera. Five hundred million dollars a year.\n\nYes. That would go a long way in solving the problem, but I got poo-pooed. The press ran things about it. This is the dumbest idea we have ever heard. Obviously this guy is a professor. How did he ever get tenure, et cetera.\n\nWell, I recently heard an example and I thank the news for bringing it up. The Everglades. The Everglades are a great natural resource that we have in this country. A park that is being destroyed and the nature groups that are destroying it and my apologies to them, are the sugar producers.\n\nThey want good land. This is terrific virgin territory, near water, et cetera. So the sugar producers have been, if you go in south Florida, encroaching from Lake Okeechobee down further and further.\n\nWell, a deal has been struck. The Everglades need money to be saved. So we now have a one cent a pound tax on sugar. Now of course you can hear the screaming and yelling by the sugar industry.\n\nThis is going to kill us. We have no profits. It is the end of sugar as we know it. All I ask is a test case. Has anyone in this room noticed a difference in the price of sugar? Have you bought less sugar for your coffee? Have you bought less pies? Have you noticed an escalation?\n\nNo, of course not. One cent on a pound has not changed anyone's behavior, but hopefully it will provide the financial basis for preserving the Everglades. Those who use it, the sugar producers and us the consumers, should help keep it as a public good. I think the exact analogy goes here.\n\nIf we want to pass this to our grandchildren and great grandchildren as a public service, as a public good, a cultural product, then we all ought to be willing to contribute.\n\nI do not measure video in pounds, but if you want to use feet, if you want to use one percent, a half a percent, I think you come up with a similar model, a model of preserving that material as a public good for all of us now and in the future.\n\nI would encourage that we think big on those lines so that we can have not only the amount of funding necessary, but the steady state of funding that is necessary, not just hit and miss, but steady.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nMR. TABB: Mr. Cripps, good to see you again as well. STATEMENT OF THOMAS CRIPPS, MORGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY\n\nMR. CRIPPS: Thank you. For our next tenured fuddy duddy professor, I think I will take my allotted time or less. I am not sure.\n\nI have a long paragraph I am skipping, in which I explain to us all why we are here and why I am personally here. I will skip both of those.\n\nI should like to be thought of as a delegate from another world, that is of the small college struggling to be a university in a world of giants.\n\nThe Morgan State Universities in the world number in the thousands. They graduate most of the students of higher education in the United States, particularly in the case of Morgan and HBU, as we say on the campus, historically black university.\n\nThis statistic has meaning. HB's have graduated a far higher proportion of America's black leaders than have the traditionally white universities and yet we struggle in a way that larger, research oriented universities do not.\n\nOur libraries, when compared with major libraries, grow at an inch worm rate. Especially this is so with respect to costly electronic images, whether radio, television, motion pictures, laser discs, CD rom materials.\n\nNot only are these materials prohibitively costly, but their storage, maintenance and accessibility render the need for their acquisition almost moot.\n\nRanging from buying machinery, monitors, players, VCR's and such, to buying licenses to take new materials off satellite place small libraries in a perpetual survival mode.\n\nThus our collections remain small and relatively speaking grow smaller and so our distance from the mainstreams of American intellectual life remains the subject of a constant struggle.\n\nAlmost no predominantly African-American university can expect to stay even in this uneven struggle. My own university, when I arrived 37 years ago, was blessed by Guggenheim Fellows such as Benjamin Quarles, distinguished journalists such as G. James Fleming and pioneers in bringing black American life into the American studies and internationally regarded literary critics such as Philip Butcher and Nick Ford. Now we have perhaps one or two dinosaurs left.\n\nPartly this is so because the nature of the curriculum has changed in ways that render electronic media obligatory as sources of study and of teaching.\n\nWhen I was a graduate student in olden times, as my students think of it, a professor once quoted with quiet approval a famous historian who had asserted that history is past politics.\n\nNow politics has been subsumed under rubrics such as cultural studies. This means that to study any trait of 20th century American culture in society has become for some scholars a search for politics. Politics of art, of movies, of television.\n\nThis curricular evolution alone has made both teaching and research prohibitively dear. Susan Davis' book, Parades and Power, a recent study of 19th century Philadelphia working class politics combined, even indeed linked popular forms of parading on holidays as manifestations of political campaigning.\n\nHer entire corpus of research might have been accomplished in one or two libraries by turning the pages of old newspapers. To attempt the same task in the age of television is to incur a research debt that would be unavoidably dependent on research and travel grants that would be prohibitive to graduate students and undergraduates alike.\n\nSo with a simultaneous arrival of both cultural studies and electronic media, the teacher and the student both at a small American college are effectively debarred from participating in any important trend in American higher education.\n\nThe solution to this emerging disparity is access to electronic resources and of course self evidently the preservation of these videotape documents.\n\nOthers will argue far more effectively than I for such a hoped for outcome of these hearings. My most deeply felt need is for access to the preserved document.\n\nAt the very least, the ongoing work of the Library of Congress, Division of Broadcasting, Motion Pictures and Recorded Sounds must be encouraged and expanded, perhaps in the form of regional core collections of their documents.\n\nIn addition, in keeping with the laws expressed wish to enhance education while ensuring against copyright infringement, we must ask for a re-clarification of the copyright law of 1976, coincidentally written in the same year as the television preservation law.\n\nIf we clarify copyright law in a way that it does not infringe upon the rights of copyright holders, it should allow for educational use as fair use. Perhaps by having institutions pay a general user fee, not unlike that paid to ASCAP for the right to use musical compositions.\n\nIn this way researchers, even undergraduate researchers, would be able to receive on request of the Library of Congress or other repository, either by satellite or by postal service research and teaching copies of historic video documents.\n\nPerhaps copyright holders could have a small logo supered in the corner of the frame of such programming as an insurance against an unintended pirated use for broadcast purposes.\n\nMany firms in the business of selling stock shots already do this. Or a more commonplace solution might be the often discussed prospect of regional media study centers. There are already such precedents for this in the Pacific Film Archive, the late lamented Southwestern Film and Video Archive, the Harvard and Yale Archives, along with many smaller archives that have taken in the news footage of their local television stations, such as the University of Baltimore and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\n\nTo take any one of these steps, accompanied by a rigorous national effort to preserve the nation's television heritage, much has already been undertaken.\n\nIt will allow the nation's small institutions to share in an academic culture now accessible only to those universities rich enough to collect their own archives. Those near to the major repositories, such as the Library of Congress and those who now scrape by even as they are partly daunted by the FBI's warnings at the top of every Blockbuster tape that they use fragment of in class.\n\nMy students frequently play a verbal dramatized joke in class, each one thinking he or she has invented it, bursting in the door, pretending to be the FBI and having us put our hands against the wall.\n\nMany witnesses before this body will surely emphasize the documented need for preservation and broad access without violating copyright, but I would press further a more precious need that practicing scholars cannot do without.\n\nThe development of the provenance and the pedigrees of the video image. To rely on collectors, commercial stores such as Blockbuster or even their more historically minded counterparts, such as Video Americain, is to study documents that have frequently been violated, edited, fragmented and otherwise spoiled as pristine primary sources.\n\nTo have a national repository such as the Library of Congress with a staff trained in librarianship would assure not only the stanching of the bleeding away of lost materials, but would assure that the survivors would be catalogued according to a professional standard of description.\n\nHere I should point out that by the television document I mean precisely what is meant by almost everyone else who might wish to speak to this issue. All of the programming, not merely news, documentaries or so-called educational television.\n\nIt is all educational, whether the seven-year hit situation comedy, a flop that has dropped after six shows or the hundreds of commercials that routinely punctuate the programming.\n\nIt is the total television experience that will teach our offspring what our culture was really like. Imagine if we were to judge the culture of Britain only by what comes to us through the prism of Masterpiece Theatre. We would miss entirely the Irish, the working class, the blacks and so on.\n\nTo fail to see this preservation attempt in the round is to become dependent on compilers of the holdings of copyright possessors.\n\nHowever much we were amused by MGM's That's Entertainment, however we wince at the NFL's compilations of the league's hardest hits, complete with augmented whacks of sound effects, we are unable to learn much from them.\n\nYet we are dependent on what sells, whether in the rental stores or among the chains of dealers, such as Sun Coast.\n\nMay I have one last word on the aspect of our work here that may elude those of us who have not recently faced its structures? I wrote this before I heard David talking about copyright.\n\nThat is the subject of copyright. We indeed need some uniform code or standard that will allow scholarly use without the threat of litigation for presume violation or infringement.\n\nThe law as it stands or rather the jurisprudence that has followed from it has made eligible for copyright almost any document, even a laundry list.\n\nThat is to say, any scribbling on a page constitutes intent to publish. Therefore any manuscript or in our instance today, any out take, constitutes a copyrighted document protected by the law.\n\nMoreover, this particular title in the law awards uncommonly ironclad protection to all of the future widows and orphans of America whose forbears may have produced something deemed as meant to be published.\n\nWe need to remove all non-commercial, scholarly research or teaching purpose or intent from this morass of ever lengthier claims to ownership.\n\nWe should make clear the intent neither to infringe the rights of others nor the wish to profit from the work of others, but the public's right to know as phrased in the original copyright act of 1790 is also a right and one that we must defend against infringement. Thank you.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you. Mr. Curtin, the director of cultural studies programs at Indiana University. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL CURTIN, INDIANA UNIVERSITY, DIRECTOR, CULTURAL STUDIES PROGRAM\n\nMR. CURTIN: Good day. Thank you for the invitation to present here. I have submitted some written comments and rather than reading from those comments, I just want to touch on some things that have already been said by some of the scholars here and by the first round of presentations, amplifying upon them a little bit and then perhaps offer a modest suggestion, which is probably just as naive as some of the other suggestions that scholars will make today.\n\nFirst of all, as far as budgets are concerned, whether we are talking about small colleges or \"research institutions\" we are talking about very small research budgets.\n\nMr. Cripps very eloquently pointed out the problems that scholars confront at small institutions. At Indiana University, what is known as a world class research institution or at least likes to pretend that it is a world class research institution, scholars in the humanities have no research budgets.\n\nYou can compete for research budgets. You can try and negotiate for research budgets and a very handsome annual research budget might total $1,000, $2,000. So we are talking about very small amounts of money.\n\nMost of the money that people spend on their research comes out of their pockets. A lot of this we have sort of referred to jokingly, but perhaps dark humor is what one is confronted with in these kinds of circumstances, but we refer to it as credit card research. We extend our credit limits on our credit cards in order to be able to go places to gather the information and materials that are important to us. So as far as research budgets are concerned, all up and down the scale we are talking about very limited amounts of money that are available.\n\nThe second thing is that Mr. Culbert pointed out that there is a reticence on the part of some historians to actually engage in the analysis of television programs themselves, given the obstacles that they confront. It is very true that for years television studies pretty much focused on institutional, regulatory, and economic issues, largely I think because people did not have VCR's in their homes where they could pop tapes in, record programs, and then go back and look at them very carefully.\n\nA lot of the research that was being done was being done about television as an institutional force and it is only more recently that we have started to see an increasing interest in the program texts themselves.\n\nThis interest in programs is appearing not just in history but in cultural studies, which is one of the reasons why I wanted to appear today. Cultural studies is perhaps one of the fastest growing areas in humanities research today.\n\nWhat is cultural studies? Well, it is very much about the connection between text and context. How is it that the meanings that we circulate in society are connected to social and power relations in society? It is not just media scholars who are interested in this. It is people in English departments, political science departments, folklore departments, comparative literature departments, all across the university. My program includes 60 faculty members from 19 departments and programs in the university who study everything from cartoons to Ouigi boards to television, and television is of increasing interest, because for 40 years more than 80% of the American people have had TV's in their homes. It is something that we share across generations. We share it across economic, social, ethnic, racial, other sorts of divides. How we share it, how we use it is of course distinctive to each viewing context itself, but nevertheless it is the preeminent form of mass communication.\n\nYet what we have here, what we are confronted with, is a blanking out; a sort of sealing off of a lot of discussion about this realm and about the texts themselves, largely because of the issues that we confront in the area of copyright.\n\nYou have heard a lot of discussion about this today; I too consider copyright to be perhaps the paramount issue in resolving a lot of the problems we confront. Certainly funding, storage, access, those sorts of things are very important, but the real irony here is that these programs which are so hard to access were broadcast over the public airwaves.\n\nMr. Gomery is very right, we have to be sympathetic with these private corporations being profit ventures. Indeed they are profit ventures and that has made only too apparent by Mr. Stevens' comment that one is known as the vice-president of asset management; they see themselves as profit ventures primarily. So their priorities are very, very different, but the irony here is that as a result their priorities fly in the face of the fact that here we have a public medium of which we have no record.\n\nIn newspapers we have a record. The next day you can go to the library and you can look at what was in yesterday's newspaper and study it very carefully. You could do that of course for decades. You can get it on microfilm. It can be circulated to institutions all over the country.\n\nWith television, you cannot do that. You do not have access to those records and if you do not have your tape machine, your personal tape machine running, chances are you may be missing something, like the O. J. Simpson flight and trial.\n\nNow granted, however you take that issue, it was a major media event, which compelled national attention. What happened with the Simpson flight and trial is probably a condensation of just about a half dozen very significant issues that confront us. Everything from domestic relations to race relations to the future of Los Angeles to police enforcement, et cetera, et cetera. A very important event and yet we have no way of legitimately accessing that without going through these corporate institutions with their own sets of priorities, unless we want to fly in the face of copyright and make our own recording, circulate them among ourselves, do this in a very sort of casual and subrossa manner, which is how a lot of television research gets conducted.\n\nSo what goes over the public airwaves is not available for critique. It is not available for criticism largely because of.\n\nMr. Gomery suggested a 1% tax as one proposal that we might consider. I would also say that what we should consider as well is pressing for an exemption to copyright laws for the Library of Congress: that the Library of Congress be allowed to record off-air at its own discretion, that it be able to seek from commercial distributors materials that are not otherwise commercially available at a reasonable cost and that by gaining this exemption that they start to undertake a very active program of systematically trying to record what is happening now on television and also gathering those things that are difficult to obtain through commercial sources.\n\nThat exemption is not unreasonable. It is not unreasonable first of all because we are talking about the public airwaves, but it is also not an unreasonable thing because when my book was published last year, I know that a copy went to the Library of Congress. When books are published, they end up in the Library of Congress, right? Well maybe not in all cases, but certainly in most cases we know where to look.\n\nWith television, we have the most ubiquitous form of mass communication in the United States and we do not have a record. We do not have a way to move forward systematically in gathering that record. Why? Because we depend on the contributions and generosity of television executives, of producers. We depend on the occasional collection that gets donated.\n\nI do not know all of the ways in which collections are gathered and organized, because that is not my bailiwick, but I do know that I just recently published a book on the emergence of television news in the early 1960's as the preeminent form of news in the United States especially the documentary genre itself.\n\nI was able to go around the country and I was able to gather most of the documentaries that I was looking for. Why? Because nobody considered them to be commercially valuable anymore, one.\n\nSecondly, they were considered to be public service kinds of programming so they got distributed to libraries. They got distributed to archival collections. It was part of a network public service gesture, the whole documentary boom of the early 1960's.\n\nTherefore, I could go around the country and gather up these things and nobody thought they were worth anything. In fact, I was just ahead of the garbage man in many cases, because what was happening was that people were discarding from collections many of these documentaries that I was in fact studying.\n\nSo in that case, I was lucky. If I had not been able to access those documentaries, I would argue that I would have written a very, very different book than the book that I wrote, because one of the things that scholars pay attention to increasingly is the fact that all forms of media, are contradictory.\n\nEmbedded within them is not one single message, but a constellation of often conflicting, contradictory meanings and what I often found in these documentaries were things that were far different from what I had expected.\n\nThe questions I ended up asking as part of my research project were far different than the questions I started out with when I started my project looking through government documents, looking through trade publications, looking through contemporary press accounts, et cetera.\n\nSo this public record is extremely important. What we know and what we will think of our immediate past and our distant past is highly reliant on the fact that we start making a systematic effort to save much of what is there.\n\nI just want to close with one final comment and that is going back to what Mr. Gomery was saying about priorities. Inscribed in whatever systematic effort we make will be a certain set of values. A certain set of assumptions about what we think is valuable.\n\nLet me just point out that I have a student right now who is working on a dissertation about cooking shows. It is a fascinating dissertation: What we think about food. How we present food. The sorts of discussion and deliberation that goes on around food. The ways in which cooking is both a public and a private activity. The ways in which television bridges the public and the private. The way that it gathers viewers around the issue of what kinds of foods are to be valued, how they are prepared, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nWho would have thought of cooking as being a fascinating dissertation? Yet, this student, who is working on her dissertation in this area, is now producing I think something that is going to be very valuable to people in the future when they look back and they think about how was food inscribed in social practices during the 1980's and 1990's?\n\nSo I very much urge you to consider the sorts of things that the panelists suggest here. Certainly we do not know all of the particularities of how these acquisitions will take place, how they will be funded, et cetera, et cetera, but we can tell you that it is extremely important what this panel is doing.\n\nWe are very grateful for these efforts and we think that this action needs to move beyond just the question of the technical issues, the funding issues. It needs to also move into the realm of dealing with these very confusing copyright concerns. Thank you.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you. Now we welcome Thomas Doherty who is chairman of the film studies program at Brandeis. STATEMENT OF THOMAS DOHERTY, BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY, CHAIR, FILM STUDIES PROGRAM\n\nMR. DOHERTY: Thank you. I am pleased to testify to the importance of television and video preservation and to programs that assure scholars, students and the general public ready access to television archives.\n\nBut because I am from Brandeis University I come here not only to testify, but to kvetch a little about that subject. Like my colleagues, I believe that the television legacy no less than printed material or the motion picture record offers the unique lens into American life in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nMatthew Arnold to the contrary, culture is no longer only the best that is written in thought. It is also what we see and create on screen.\n\nNo one outside the provinces of an Amish community can doubt the centrality of television to American life. Reviled or beloved, vast wasteland or cultural cornucopia, TV shapes our imagination and colors our existence.\n\nThe values we esteem, the myths that we live by, even the leaders we elect are transmitted and mediated by television.\n\nSince 1948 or thereabouts successive generations of Americans have measured their lives by shared moments beheld on the screen. Just as we experience that shared present through television, we learn our history through it for history is now as likely to be acquired as a visual memory, as a printed one, as a retrieval of images rewound from our collective visual consciousness.\n\nWe can all do the channel surfing in our heads. Frank Costello's hands nervously fidgeting during the Kefauver crime hearings, attorney Joseph Welch facing down the junior senator from Wisconsin, a perspiring Charles Van Doren feigning concentration, four indelible days in November, 1963, a blizzard of combat imagery from southeast Asia, the president's men called to account before the halls of Congress and on and on to the Challenger disaster, the Hill-Thomas hearings, the war in the gulf and too long ago, the murder verdict of the century.\n\nIn focusing just now on matters of obvious historical significance however, I did not mean to slight the rest of the medium's content.\n\nMomentous events aside, our encounter with television is more likely to be the daily rituals of situation comedies, talk shows, crime dramas or sports. Yet sometimes the obscure and the ephemeral persist with surprising tenacity and what seems the disposable dextrose of one era might be a nugget of gold to another.\n\nViewed from a distance, revelations abound in the common rung of television programming. The racial and ethnic shadings of 1950's America in Amos and Andy and Molly. The gender dynamics in any one of a dozen ripe sitcoms from Ozzie and Harriet to Roseanne and the nation insecurities expressed in crime melodramas such as Dragnet or NYPD Blue.\n\nIn honesty, one might be forced to concede the daunting possibility that the Jerry Springer show might reveal as much about the 1990's as 60 Minutes.\n\nIn short, though some discrimination is nigh unavoidable, given the vast quantity of material in the TV culture bank an open ended selection process might best capture the wide net and permissive arena that is television, an admissions policy that accepts all genres and embraces the low with the high.\n\nAfter all, we have learned those terms have a way of turning on their heads with time. As anyone knows who has partaken of the genius, is there a better word for it, of Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason or Ernie Kovacs.\n\nIf the defense of television as an art and the arguments for its impact as a social influence are familiar enough, it's role in the classroom as a historical document might be less known.\n\nIn this sense I thought it might be useful to discuss one example of how as a teacher of American history and culture TV comes into play. Being a cultural historian, I teach courses in the full range of Americanist material, from the sermons of John Winthrop on through to the glories of classical Hollywood cinema.\n\nA couple of years ago I took over a course entitled \"Television in American Culture,\" given out of the American studies department at Brandeis.\n\nFrom the billing at least it might seem to be the kind of offering designed to give lazy undergraduates a gut and conservative critics of the academy the conniptions.\n\nBut in tracing a half century of American life, via television I and most of my students I really believe found the material rich, complex and demanding: the death of presidents, the immediacy of war, the constitution in action.\n\nThe chronology alone tracks a whole range of cultural transformations, many impossible to imagine without the influence, salutary and baleful, of television.\n\nWould the civil rights movement have finally penetrated the American conscience without television? Would crime and illegitimacy have exploded without the commercial drumbeat of instant gratification? Surely these are subjects and questions to be pondered in an undergraduate education.\n\nYet in mastering the history of television and of obtaining material for the class, I found myself stymied again and again. Unlike virtually any other subject one can teach in which ready access to illustrative material and landmark text is a given, the television coded and propelled history of America is maddeningly intangible and un-chronicled.\n\nFurther, television moments are just that. Discreet and irreplaceable pieces of time. If you are teaching say the Army-McCarthy hearings, the assassination of JFK or the Tet offensive, access to the contemporaneous images and I would really like to second what Tom Cripps said, as broadcast at the time not as re-contextualized and reedited in retrospective archival documentaries is simply essential.\n\nTo be sure, the VCR has helped enormously as has the proliferation of cable options such as A&E, C-SPAN and the history channel.\n\nMoreover in my experience, the networks and individual television producers have been generous in making their materials available, but let's be real. The networks are businesses whose main clients are their in-house production teams.\n\nScholars of the medium naturally fall well outside their job description. For a specific example, take an event like the Cuban missile crisis, surely a moment in American history worth reclaiming in undergraduate classrooms.\n\nAn essential part of teaching that moment is JFK's address on October 22, 1962 in which he used television to deliver an ultimatum to the Soviets and to inform the American people of the gravity of the crisis.\n\nIt is certainly the most bracing presidential address ever given on television. We remember it. Our students do not. Where do you find it unedited in its entirety as it was delivered? How do you get a copy of it to show to your class?\n\nMoreover, what substitution can you make? Again, unlike literature where one can choose from a range of likely books when teaching say the American renaissance or even film where an individual western, musical or filmed war can stand in for the genre TV can accept no substitute.\n\nCould you teach the Cuban missile crisis without having seen JFK's speech and screening it? Maybe, but you cannot teach it as well, as vividly, as powerfully.\n\nIronically and despite whatever the future holds for VHS, which will likely go to the way of the eight track tape with the onset of the digital video disc, even as videotape has become an ever more cost efficient and user friendly teaching tool, the availability of materials to obtain scholarly expertise and assist pedagogy remains both expensive and elusive.\n\nThis is especially true of the landmark broadcast of the early television era, which were preserved haphazardly on kinescope, if at all.\n\nIn some cases, the visual record of events from 1946 to 1960 may be more clouded and less retrievable than events before that era, which were preserved on news reel film or after it, recorded on videotape.\n\nThere is another consideration that might be calculated into the video mix, one that has special resonance for media historians. Once a fresh insight, it is now a stale cliche to observe that in an image obsessed world the boundaries between reality and the image have converged.\n\nThat reality, as Susan Sontag put it, \"has come to seem more and more like what we are shown on cameras\". Yet even for Sontag, a critic with a preternatural sense for the next fashion curve, the photographical reproduction of reality possessed an unbreakable link to the original.\n\n\"The picture distorts\", Sontag wrote in 1977, \"but there is always the presumption that something exists, or did exist, which is like what's in the picture.\"\n\nThat presumption no longer holds. Today the technology of photo fabrication in videotape and cinema, no less than the still picture, has out paced the ability of the spectator to detect it.\n\nThe telltale indicators of tampering by which a discerning eye could always perceive alterations in the photographic image. The difference in film grain, the visible lines in air brushing, the mismatch of lighting and background have been wiped clean by imaging technologies.\n\nThrough the magic of seamless matching, morphing, computer graphics and digital editing techniques, the integrity and voracity of any moving image, perhaps the whole notion of documentary cinema has been called into question.\n\nIn sum, if the historian's job of work is to evoke and interpret the past, then television must be part of the material at hand.\n\nThe psychologist Karl Jung remarked that \"myth is the history you don't have to be taught in school.\" Can anyone doubt that our modern myth makers are on and around television?\n\nThat television is like the atmosphere, sometimes invigorating, sometimes oppressive, but always there. In a famous warning, Edward R. Murrow once ruminated on the potential of television, that it was an appliance that might teach and illuminate but otherwise it was merely lights and shadows in a box.\n\nI think we know it is always much more, but whatever it is, it must be before our eyes to study, to interpret, to delight in.\n\nAs the preeminent custodian of our national heritage, the Library of Congress should commit itself aggressively to the task of preserving these vivid and irreplaceable documents. Thank you.\n\nMR. TABB: All right. Thank you. David?\n\nMR. FRANCIS: I hope you do not consider the question I am going to address to all of you as unfair. Let's look at the suggestion Doug Gomery raised about keeping everything effectively.\n\nSay the Library of Congress or other organizations were in a position to record programs off-air and to protect copyright by putting time code invision. This would also enable us to retain information about the date of transmission. Would the academic community be prepared to make a contribution towards the cost of the operation?\n\nIt is not actually that expensive to record the major networks off-air. If you divide that cost between all the academic organizations which have an interest in this material, I do not think it would be a significant amount. You then have to find a way of getting that information to the user and that would involve some form of electronic transmission.\n\nI think it is a feasible proposition. What do you feel about it? Let us take a figure out of the blue and say it would cost each institution $50,000 a year for access to this collection. That would cover the cost of the recording. There might also be a small charge for each access.\n\nDo you think this is a feasible approach? It might be possible that we could find a way ensuring adequate protection to record all programs off-air.\n\nThis proposal has the advantage of not only recording the programs, but the links as well, enabling one to see the juxtaposition of programs on one channel and another.\n\nMR. CRIPPS: This is already done in the form of off satellite licenses. So people who make up budgets are already used to that line in the budgets. I think it would be only a matter of as the technology advances refining the language of the contracts.\n\nI think you are right about the small item that that budget buying would be for each institution. I think that is not only perfectly reasonable anticipation of the future, but actually a description of what already goes on.\n\nMR. CURTIN: There is already a significant and growing amount of library budgets allocated for the acquisition of video materials and actually one of the advantages here of pursuing such a thing is that a lot of the materials that are being gathered are being gathered on the basis of purchasing tapes, tapes which a lot of times for a half hour, hour tape sometimes cost $200 for a single tape. Other tapes which are much less expensive are starting to become available as well.\n\nBut some sort of a sharing arrangement, one of the advantages here is the fact that libraries might then have access to a larger pool actually than what they have now using a similar amount of money in their budgets or perhaps even a smaller amount of money from their budgets.\n\nGiven the fact that for example there are tapes that I have ordered by the library that I might use once or twice a year and yet we have to purchase the tape in order for me to be able to use them in the classroom or use them for research.\n\nSo I think yes indeed this is a wonderful idea and I think it would be received quite well by many librarians on the one hand.\n\nOn the other hand, these libraries are facing very, very severe sorts of funding constraints themselves. So, it has to be a way of sort of reallocating resources primarily within already existing budgets as opposed to coming up with new money, because in many cases new money just does not exist, as you well know.\n\nMR. TABB: Anyone else want to respond to David's question?\n\nMR. CULBERT: The only thing I would add is certainly a problem in my university--very, very modest or antiquated equipment for classroom use. I could see the idea of a contribution for a licensing fee, something that in fact would make sense in the university, but then how to get it into the classroom. Having students come to a designated room in the library in a university with 27,000 people would immediately create a scheduling problem. Fortunately the vast majority of professors could not care less about this and would never come.\n\nIt is not an insurmountable barrier, but it is worth keeping in mind that it is not just in the eloquence of Tom Cripps' description of HBU's. There are lots and lots of places out there where material in the classroom can be a bit of a challenge because of the simple brake of inadequate equipment with brake in both senses (break!) of the word.\n\nMR. BURKE: With the importance of television as presented here eloquently this morning and other media, is there a rationale for some universities closing down their radio, television and film departments?\n\nMR. GOMERY: I guess that is aimed at me, but it was presented to us as a fate complie and so I do not think it was a good rationale at all nor a good idea. When the votes were taken, we were not in the room.\n\nMR. BURKE: Is it a trend?\n\nMR. GOMERY: Yes. Sadly it is a trend. The University of Virginia. The University of Maryland. The University of Oregon. Arizona State. Ohio State. I could keep the list a long way down.\n\nAs an economist, when the economy went into recession in 1990, 1991, 1992, particularly this is really pretty much for state universities, started to look for ways to cut.\n\nOne of the things my colleagues have alluded to is the changing of the nature of the academy, which is as you all know having been there very, very slow and so the study that media was often in a humanities program or something else.\n\nWhen you look at a humanities program, the history department, my apologies to most history departments, use chalk and maybe a few slides and et cetera. Then you get down to the radio and TV film budget, well it was a pretty easy decision to be made.\n\nBut that had nothing to do with the study by the media. It had to do with the inability to get rid of large dollar expenditures quickly.\n\nMR. CULBERT: I think part of that too has to do with another sort of uncertainty. The name radio, TV, film would seem to many to be sort of an antiquated title. Do you want to call it mass communications and what do you want to do with it?\n\nThe problem at my university has been an uncertainty as to the cost of buying the constantly evolving technology and the fact that persons who used to go into a radio, TV, film department, now updated with at least a new title--if no new equipment--now attend a School of Mass Communication.\n\nIf these are persons who are seeking employment in an industry, then unless you have extremely up-to-date equipment you are, shall we say, instructing them in something new, it is called a typewriter--and then sending them out to try and find practical employment.\n\nThe issue is whether the primary purpose of a radio, TV, film department is to produce practitioners or to promote the kinds of interest that I think every panelist here is concerned about--trying to integrate the study of television into a much, much wider range of inquiry.\n\nI think in a sense your question, which I see as being animated by just a whiff of malice, actually is a very interesting one if a non-malicious but more thoughtful or reflective response is encouraged.\n\nTo measure the impact of the study of television or video in the academic world based on closings or openings or budgets of radio, TV, film departments would be an exceedingly inaccurate mechanism, like using the telephone to find out who was going to win the presidential election of 1936.\n\nIt is hard to get the needed data. Please remember that an association of professors of journalism or mass communication is not the way to find out something which nobody knows and that is what use is being made of television in the classroom.\n\nI use those same materials Tom Doherty spoke of in the course that I teach in America since 1945. I am also interested in complete video texts.\n\nI cannot imagine missing an opportunity to show the entire Nixon Checkers speech, which I always tell my students is an opportunity to see one of the very few examples of the dinosaur age of television production.\n\nI have mass communications majors in that course who indeed are shocked to see what was state-of-the-art broadcasting in 1952.\n\nTo me not only is the content memorable, but it is the video technique and the problem of how a camera managed to move from Dick Nixon with the greatest of effort--it seems to take a minute to get all the way over to Pat--while also revealing what was conceived of as a reasonable studio set in 1952.\n\nThis is part of the contextualization of a landmark in American political television. But that is only part of it and the fact that it is a standard item that might be used in a course on America since 1945 is never going to be discovered by asking about budgets for radio, TV, film departments.\n\nMR. BURKE: There is no malice of forethought. I just wanted to get the issue on the table.\n\nMR. CULBERT: No. It is a very good question though.\n\nMR. DOHERTY: The film studies program there is a new creation in the last couple of years, because it finally became intolerable, even to the liberal arts sort of print oriented, talmudic history of Brandeis that you w"
