        "text": "ChatGPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is a chatbot AI that mimics human conversation. It has been trained by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The AIs are learning to respond intelligently by having millions of humans check their output to weed out the ridiculous or unsatisfactory. Millions of low-paid workers in places like Kenya and Nepal are grading routine output. Trained experts all over the world can make a lot of money grading ChatGPT’s answers to medical, legal, and creative writing prompts.\n\nAs it relates to creative writing, another way ChatGPT learns is by absorbing billions of writing samples. Margaret Atwood was one of 8,000 authors who signed a recent open letter demanding that the major AI developers stop training their bots using her work without permission or compensation. That should fix that problem.\n\nA year ago, a company called OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public. Its free version is based on ChatGPT 3.5. ChatGPT Plus is based on the more powerful ChatGPT 4 and costs $20/month. ChatGPT is currently being used by 140 million users and brings in about $80 million/month. OpenAI is about to sell shares in an IPO for an expected valuation of $80-$90 billion. It has several competitors: Google’s Bard, Microsoft’s Bing Chat, and Meta’s LLaMA. The People’s Republic of China has banned ChatGPT, citing it as an attempt at propaganda by the U.S., and rushed its own version, Baidu’s Ernie Bot, to market in order to present the unvarnished truth to the world. The PRC is also spending a lot of effort in developing military AI. To counter that effort, Scale is developing Donovan for our military, to analyze classified data, pilot autonomous combat robots, ships, planes, and drones, as well as give tactical advice to commanders during battle. Donovan sounds so much more friendly than Skynet.\n\nToday I want to talk about how ChatGPT might affect the profession of creative writing. Kindle has instituted a limit on the number of books an individual can publish in a single day. The limit is now three. Who is publishing more than three books per day such that this rule was thought necessary? Individuals who use AIs such as ChatGPT to generate novels and non-fiction books from their prompts. There are now hundreds of books listed on Amazon that have ChatGPT as a coauthor, and an unknown number more that have concealed the AI contribution. Using art-generating AIs such as DALL-E 3 (also from OpenAI) or Midjourney coupled with text generated by ChatGPT, an author can generate an illustrated children’s book and get it up on Amazon as a Kindle offering in just a few hours. There are more than a few YouTube videos that will talk you through the process of generating an entire novel with ChatGPT’s assistance.\n\nHow easy is it to generate a story? Here is my very first interaction with ChatGPT:\n\nPrompt: Write a story of 1000 words about a superhero fighting off an alien invasion.\n\nChatGPT\n\nIn the darkest hours of the night, the city of Metropolis stood bathed in an eerie, silver glow. The moon hung low in the sky, casting long shadows that seemed to stretch into infinity. But it wasn’t the moon causing this unearthly illumination. It was the arrival of an alien armada, descending upon the city with a menacing grace.\n\nThe citizens of Metropolis awoke to an otherworldly spectacle. Spaceships of varying sizes and shapes hovered ominously above the city, their lights casting an eerie radiance over the buildings and streets. Panic swept through the city like wildfire as people rushed to their windows and streets, staring up in awe and fear.\n\nAmid the chaos, a figure stood undaunted on a rooftop, surveying the alien fleet. He was a hero, a beacon of hope in these dire times. He was known as Stellarion, a man with powers beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals. He possessed the ability to harness the energy of the stars, granting him incredible strength, agility, and a mastery of celestial forces. Tonight, Metropolis needed him more than ever.\n\nStellarion leaped into action, soaring into the sky with a graceful burst of energy. He made his way toward the largest alien vessel, a colossal metallic monstrosity that crackled with energy. As he neared it, he unleashed a beam of starlight from his fingertips, cutting through the alien hull with ease. The vessel shuddered and exploded, showering the city with fiery debris.\n\nBut the aliens were relentless. Their smaller craft swarmed around Stellarion, firing laser beams and energy projectiles. He deftly dodged and weaved through their attacks, countering with bursts of celestial power that disintegrated their ships one by one. The city’s skyline became a battlefield, with the hero fighting to keep Metropolis safe from the invaders.\n\nDown below, the citizens watched in awe and gratitude as Stellarion’s powers blazed across the night sky. The people found strength in his unwavering resolve, and they began to rally together, forming makeshift shelters and aiding those in need. The hero’s actions were a symbol of hope in a city teetering on the brink of despair.\n\nHowever, as the battle raged on, Stellarion realized that these aliens were not like any he had encountered before. They were not driven by conquest but by desperation. He saw the fear in their strange, otherworldly eyes. They weren’t invaders; they were refugees fleeing from a dying world.\n\nStellarion paused, hovering in the midst of the chaos. He reached out with his mind, seeking a way to communicate. Through the power of the stars, he projected a message into the minds of the alien beings. “I am Stellarion. I mean you no harm. We can find a way to coexist peacefully. Please, cease this aggression.”\n\nThe alien fleet hesitated, their weapons lowering. They communicated amongst themselves, their strange language resonating with an ethereal beauty. After a tense moment, the leader of the aliens, a tall, elegant figure with bioluminescent skin, responded in kind. “We came seeking refuge, but we feared your kind would reject us. Our planet is dying. We only wish to find a new home.”\n\nStellarion, with compassion in his heart, extended an olive branch. “Metropolis has always been a city of refuge. We can help you find a new home. But violence is not the way. Let’s work together to find a peaceful solution.”\n\nThe alien leader nodded, and with that, the battle came to an abrupt halt. Stellarion used his powers to communicate with the city’s leaders and the United Nations, forging a plan to accommodate the alien refugees while ensuring the safety of Metropolis. The city came together, demonstrating the resilience and compassion that defined it in times of crisis.\n\nOver the following weeks, the aliens were provided shelter and resources, and scientists collaborated to find a suitable planet for their resettlement. Metropolis, with Stellarion as its guiding light, proved that unity and compassion could prevail even in the face of unimaginable challenges.\n\nIn the end, the alien refugees found a new home among the stars, and Metropolis remained a shining beacon of hope. Stellarion, once a symbol of strength and power, now stood as a symbol of peace and compassion, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, the human spirit could prevail.\n\nAs the alien fleet departed, the citizens of Metropolis watched with a sense of fulfillment. The night sky was no longer filled with fear and dread but with hope and a renewed sense of unity. Stellarion, the hero who had once fought off an alien invasion, had now ushered in an era of interstellar cooperation, proving that even in the face of the unknown, humanity’s capacity for empathy and understanding could triumph over all.\n\nHere is another early attempt:\n\nPrompt: Write a scene in which a mother, Anna, and a daughter, Kim, are arguing in a kitchen about the traditional recipe for chicken salad that has been handed down through the generations. Kim wants to modify it. The mother resists change. But the subtext of the argument is that Anna is angry that Kim has rejected her husband’s pleas to start a family. Kim thinks children would hamper her career as a lawyer. Unknown to the mother, Kim has come home to recover from an abortion. Once Kim’s husband finds out about the abortion, Kim knows that her husband will divorce her. Unaware of all this background, the mother still hopes for a traditional happy family, including grandchildren.\n\nChatGPT\n\nIn the warm, sunlit kitchen of their family home, Anna and Kim stood on opposite sides of the worn, maple wood table. The scent of fresh herbs and simmering soup filled the air, mixing with the tension that hung between them. Anna, her silver-streaked hair pulled back in a tight bun, clutched a faded recipe card in her hand. Kim, her eyes determined and dark hair pulled into a hasty ponytail, looked resolute.\n\nAnna sighed and glanced down at the cherished piece of paper in her hand, the delicate handwriting worn from years of use. “Kim, you can’t just change our family’s chicken salad recipe. This has been passed down through generations. It’s tradition.”\n\nKim crossed her arms and leaned against the counter, her voice soft but firm. “Mom, I love tradition, but sometimes it needs a little update. I’m a lawyer, for heaven’s sake. I can’t bring this bland, old-fashioned dish to the potluck and expect people to be impressed. I’ve got to make it my own.”\n\nAnna’s eyes flashed with a mix of frustration and disappointment. “Kim, it’s not just about the salad. It’s about the values and the memories it carries. It’s a piece of our family history.”\n\nKim’s jaw clenched, her voice carrying an edge of frustration. “And what about my future, Mom? This recipe is a relic from a time when women were expected to just cook and have kids. You know I don’t want children right now. I have a career to build.”\n\nAnna’s eyes clouded with an unspoken sorrow. She had longed for grandchildren, and the truth of Kim’s feelings stung more than her insistence on altering the recipe. “Kim, your father and I have been waiting for you and Dan to start a family for so long. It’s only natural.”\n\nKim’s eyes met her mother’s, and there was a moment of silence that carried the weight of unspoken secrets. Kim looked away, her voice barely above a whisper. “Mom, I don’t want kids.”\n\nAnna’s eyes searched her daughter’s face, seeing something deeper there, a hidden pain she couldn’t quite decipher. “Kim, I thought you and Dan were trying to conceive. Your father was so excited.”\n\nKim turned her gaze to the floor, unable to meet her mother’s eyes. “We were, but I… I had a miscarriage, Mom. It was tough, and I realized I’m not ready for this. I need to focus on my career.”\n\nAnna’s face softened with empathy as she reached across the table to touch Kim’s hand. “Oh, sweetheart, I had no idea. I’m so sorry you had to go through that.”\n\nKim’s eyes glistened with unshed tears, her voice breaking. “There’s something else, Mom. I… I had an abortion. I couldn’t tell Dan. I knew he’d be devastated.”\n\nAnna gasped, her hand flying to her mouth, her eyes wide with shock. Her world, filled with hopes of grandchildren and a traditional family, crumbled in an instant.\n\nKim took a shuddering breath, her voice trembling. “Mom, you have to understand, I’m not ready for this. Dan can’t know, or he’ll divorce me.”\n\nAnna, still in a state of shock, reached for her daughter, pulling her into a tight embrace. The ancient recipe card slipped from her fingers and floated gently to the kitchen floor, a symbol of traditions that were rapidly changing, and secrets that were unfolding.\n\nIn the background, the soup continued to simmer, its aroma mingling with the tears and unspoken fears of a family in transition.\n\nChatGPT can give the story in any format you want:\n\nPrompt: As a Hollywood screenwriter expert at adapting prose fiction for the screen, rewrite this scene as the opening scene of a screenplay.\n\nChatGPT\n\nINT. FAMILY KITCHEN – MORNING\n\nA cozy, sunlit kitchen with dappled light streaming through lace curtains. The aroma of simmering soup and fresh herbs fills the air. ANNA (early sixties, silver-streaked hair pulled back in a tight bun) clutches a faded recipe card in her hand. KIM (late twenties, determined eyes, hasty ponytail) stands on the opposite side of the worn, maple wood table.\n\nAnna’s eyes are fixed on the cherished recipe card, frustration evident in her voice.\n\nANNA (With frustration) You can’t just change our family’s chicken salad recipe, Kim. This has been passed down through generations. It’s tradition.\n\nKim crosses her arms, leaning against the counter, her voice just as resolute.\n\nKIM (Defiant) Mom, I love tradition, but sometimes it needs a little update. I’m a lawyer, for heaven’s sake. I can’t bring this bland, old-fashioned dish to the potluck and expect people to be impressed. I’ve got to make it my own.\n\nAnna sighs, her eyes revealing a mix of frustration and disappointment.\n\nANNA (With disappointment) Kim, it’s not just about the salad. It’s about the values and the memories it carries. It’s a piece of our family history.\n\nKim’s jaw clenches, her voice filled with frustration.\n\nKIM (Frustrated) And what about my future, Mom? This recipe is a relic from a time when women were expected to just cook and have kids. You know I don’t want children right now. I have a career to build.\n\nAnna’s eyes cloud with unspoken sorrow.\n\nANNA (Sorrowful) Kim, your father and I have been waiting for you and Dan to start a family for so long. It’s only natural.\n\nKim’s gaze falls to the floor, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nKIM (Whispering) Mom, I don’t want kids.\n\nAnna’s eyes search her daughter’s face, sensing a hidden pain.\n\nANNA (Sympathetic) Kim, I thought you and Dan were trying to conceive. Your father was so excited.\n\nKim avoids her mother’s eyes, her voice breaking.\n\nKIM (Tears welling) We were, but I… I had a miscarriage, Mom. It was tough, and I realized I’m not ready for this. I need to focus on my career.\n\nAnna’s face softens with empathy. She reaches across the table to touch Kim’s hand.\n\nANNA (Emotional) Oh, sweetheart, I had no idea. I’m so sorry you had to go through that.\n\nKim’s eyes glisten with unshed tears, her voice trembling.\n\nKIM (Tearful) There’s something else, Mom. I… I had an abortion. I couldn’t tell Dan. I knew he’d be devastated.\n\nAnna gasps, her hand covering her mouth, her eyes wide with shock. Her dreams of grandchildren and a traditional family shatter.\n\nKim takes a shuddering breath. Her voice quivers.\n\nKIM (Confessing) Mom, you have to understand, I’m not ready for this. Dan can’t know, or he’ll divorce me.\n\nAnna, still in shock, pulls her daughter into a tight embrace. The ancient recipe card slips from her fingers and falls gently to the kitchen floor. It’s a symbol of traditions in flux and secrets unraveling.\n\nIn the background, the soup continues to simmer, its aroma mingling with the tears and unspoken fears of a family in transition.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\nThe quality of the writing isn’t quite up to that of a professional writer, yet. But the AI is getting better with each use. In ChatGPT Plus the user can give up or down ratings of the output which is used by the developers to continuously refine the model.\n\nOf more immediate use is ChatGPT’s potential role as a writer’s assistant. It will, for instance, take a sample of your writing and proofread it. It can offer suggestions for how to introduce dramatic twists, deepen character motivations, or resolve plot holes. It can sift through immense amounts of background data to help you with research or detect anachronisms in your historical writing. Let’s illustrate this capability:\n\nPrompt: Here is a passage from a story set during the American Civil War, “The private shivered in his tent unable to sleep thinking about the upcoming battle. He thought of phoning his mother and telling her how much he loved her, but worried that he would only betray his own fear and cause her to worry. He thought of getting up and cleaning his rifle, but he knew that his M-16 was already in perfect condition. He tried to find some soothing music on the radio, but the signal was too weak. He hoped his leaders knew what was best and would do everything in their power to keep him safe. He trusted General Caesar and President Carter. His last thought before falling asleep was that he hoped there wouldn’t be any mustard gas used in the upcoming battle.” As an expert editor skilled in the history of the Civil War analyze this passage to find any historical anachronisms or factual mistakes. List them for the author in the order in which they occur in the text.\n\nChatGPT\n\nThere are several historical anachronisms and factual mistakes in the passage you provided, which is set during the American Civil War. Here they are, listed in the order they appear in the text:\n\n“phoning his mother”: The term “phoning” suggests the use of a telephone, which did not exist during the American Civil War. Communication during that time was primarily through letters or in-person.\n\n“M-16”: The M-16 rifle did not exist during the American Civil War. The M-16 is a modern firearm developed in the 20th century.\n\n“radio”: Radio technology also did not exist during the Civil War. It wasn’t invented until the late 19th century and wasn’t widely used until the 20th century.\n\n“General Caesar and President Carter”: General Julius Caesar and President Jimmy Carter did not exist during the American Civil War. General namesakes like Julius Caesar are from a different era (ancient Rome), and Jimmy Carter served as the President of the United States in the late 20th century.\n\n“mustard gas”: Mustard gas is a chemical weapon that was used during World War I, which occurred decades after the American Civil War. There was no use of mustard gas during the Civil War.\n\nThese anachronisms and factual mistakes significantly disrupt the historical accuracy of the passage, as they refer to technologies, people, and events that are far removed from the Civil War era.\n\nChatGPT can pattern your outlines according to popular paradigms such as Blake Snyder’s “Save the Cat” structure, showing all of the beats at their proper places. It can also help prepare character backstories. Let’s see an example of this last task:\n\nPrompt: As preparation for a literary novel, design character backstories for each of the Myers-Briggs personality profiles. Make sure to randomly assign characters’ genders and ethnicities in the same demographic distribution as the last census.\n\nChatGPT\n\nCreating character backstories for each of the Myers-Briggs personality profiles with diverse gender and ethnic representation is a complex task, as it requires the development of 16 unique characters. Additionally, it’s important to note that the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality assessment, and people of any gender or ethnicity can belong to any of the 16 personality types. Here, I’ll create a brief character sketch for each personality type, randomly assigning gender and ethnicity while aiming for a diverse representation:\n\nISTJ – The Inspector\n\nCharacter: Alex Patel (Indian-American)\n\nOccupation: Attorney\n\nBackground: Born and raised in Chicago, Alex is a meticulous and responsible individual who comes from a close-knit family of Indian immigrants.

Apple TV just canceled Jon Stewart’s talk show because it didn’t want to air his comments on AI (as well as on China). Part of that is how criticism of AI might seriously impact the company’s profits given the ongoing negotiations between the studios and producers on the one hand and both writers’ and actors’ guilds on the other. The Hollywood writer’s strike was resolved after fierce battles over how AI would be used in generating scripts. There had been speculation that instead of hiring screenwriters, the studios were more interested in prompt writers. The actors are still trying to work out a compromise. Both segments of the creative community can envision a world where corporations can edit humans out of the creative process altogether and not have to share any of their profits with bothersome creatives. It is possible that no humans will be involved in any aspect of professional creative writing within the next decade. The same is true for most white-collar skill jobs. Enrollments in college bookkeeping programs have fallen dramatically. Doctors, pharmacists, lawyers, architects, etc. could all see their professions completely automated. A small few may be retained as prompters and annotators, but the rest will be caught in a tsunami of creative destruction.\n\nBut I won’t bother going through any more of these complex ethical issues myself. I’ll let ChatGPT do it for me:\n\nPrompt: Write a fictional discussion between Margaret and Kurt about the dangers and ethical questions raised by ChatGPT writing novels. What will this new method of writing fiction mean for human writers and for literature?\n\nChatGPT\n\nMargaret: Good evening, Kurt. It’s a pleasure to be here to discuss the fascinating topic of ChatGPT and its impact on the world of literature and human writers.\n\nKurt: Good evening, Margaret. I’ve been looking forward to this conversation. It’s an intriguing subject, indeed.\n\nMargaret: To kick things off, I believe we should first address the incredible capabilities of ChatGPT when it comes to writing fiction. This AI can generate coherent narratives, complex characters, and even mimic different writing styles. What do you make of this, Kurt?\n\nKurt: Well, Margaret, it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it’s remarkable how far technology has come in enabling AI to create stories that are, to some extent, indistinguishable from those written by humans. But on the other hand, it raises questions about the future of human creativity and the role of the writer in the creative process.\n\nMargaret: Absolutely. One concern that immediately comes to mind is the potential erosion of human creativity and the devaluation of the writer’s craft. With ChatGPT being able to churn out novels at a pace and consistency that no human can match, how can we ensure that the art of writing doesn’t become mechanical and sterile?\n\nKurt: That’s a valid point. Writing has always been an expression of human thought, emotion, and individuality. When machines start doing it, we risk losing the human touch and the uniqueness that comes with each author’s voice. It’s like a world of copies without originals.\n\nMargaret: I think you’ve hit the nail on the head, Kurt. The beauty of literature lies in its diversity and the myriad perspectives and voices that contribute to it. But ChatGPT and other AI tools can homogenize this landscape. And it’s not just about the writing process; it’s also about the opportunities for emerging authors and marginalized voices. Will AI make it even harder for them to break through in the literary world?\n\nKurt: You’re absolutely right. The publishing world can be competitive and biased as it is. If AI-generated content starts to dominate the market, it could potentially make it even more challenging for new and underrepresented authors to find their place. Diversity and originality are essential to literature, and we need to ensure they’re not lost in the AI shuffle.\n\nMargaret: On the flip side, though, AI could be a valuable tool for aspiring writers. It can help with brainstorming, providing inspiration, or even editing. It can serve as a collaborator, a creative partner, so to speak. What do you think about this potential for AI to assist and empower writers?\n\nKurt: You make a good point, Margaret. AI can be a valuable resource for writers, providing them with inspiration, suggestions, and even helping them refine their work. It’s like having an infinite well of knowledge and ideas to draw from. However, the danger is in over-reliance. Writers should use AI as a tool, not a crutch. The unique human perspective should always shine through.\n\nMargaret: And there’s also the ethical question of authorship and ownership. If an AI helps generate ideas or even complete works, who should be credited as the author? The programmer who created the AI, the person who pushed the button, or both? It’s a thorny issue.\n\nKurt: That’s a fascinating ethical dilemma. It blurs the lines of authorship and intellectual property. If the creative process is a joint effort between humans and machines, do we need to redefine how we attribute authorship? It’s a question that’s only going to become more pressing as AI continues to advance.\n\nMargaret: Indeed, and I think it’s essential to have clear guidelines and regulations in place. We need to protect the rights of both human writers and those who create these AI systems. It’s a matter of ensuring that the balance between human creativity and technological advancement is maintained.\n\nKurt: Well, I agree, but I also fear that once Pandora’s box is open, it’s tough to control its contents. There will always be people pushing the boundaries, using AI in ways that could be detrimental to literature or society as a whole.\n\nMargaret: True. We’ve already seen instances of AI-generated content being used for malicious purposes, like deepfake videos and misinformation. The potential for AI to create fake news or propaganda in the form of novels or stories is concerning. It’s a matter of safeguarding the integrity of literature and ensuring that fiction doesn’t blur with reality in harmful ways.\n\nKurt: It reminds me of the power of literature to influence society. Novels have been used to spark change, provoke thought, and inspire generations. But if AI starts producing literature that’s manipulative or malicious, what does that mean for the moral and ethical impact of fiction?\n\nMargaret: I’m glad you brought that up, Kurt. Literature has the power to shape our perspectives, challenge our beliefs, and bring about positive change. When AI is harnessed for manipulation or propaganda, it undermines the very essence of what literature stands for. We need to be vigilant in guarding against such misuse.\n\nKurt: And, you know, Margaret, while there are concerns about AI-generated fiction, there’s also the potential for AI to explore new frontiers in storytelling. It can help us break free from conventional narrative structures and genres. Perhaps it’s a tool to inspire experimentation and innovation in literature.\n\nMargaret: I’m glad you brought that up, Kurt. AI can help us push the boundaries of storytelling, creating narratives that might not be achievable through conventional means. It can be a source of creative inspiration, challenging writers to think beyond their usual constraints. But the key is for authors to use AI as a tool to enhance their creativity, not as a replacement for their unique voice.\n\nKurt: Right, we don’t want to end up in a world where every story sounds the same because it’s been filtered through an AI’s notion of what’s “marketable” or “popular.” Literature should be diverse, unpredictable, and reflective of the human experience.\n\nMargaret: I couldn’t agree more. Literature is a reflection of our culture, our history, and our emotions. It’s a record of the human condition, and it should continue to evolve and capture the essence of the ever-changing world we live in.\n\nKurt: So, Margaret, what do you think about the responsibility of writers and publishers in this new landscape? How can they navigate the AI era while preserving the authenticity of literature?\n\nMargaret: That’s a crucial question, Kurt. Writers and publishers have a significant role to play in shaping the future of literature in the AI era. For writers, it’s about maintaining their unique voice and not allowing AI to overshadow their creativity. It’s also about setting clear boundaries for the use of AI as a tool rather than a replacement.\n\nKurt: I couldn’t agree more. Writers need to remember that they are the architects of their stories. AI can be a helpful assistant, but it should never become the primary author. As for publishers, they must ensure that the proliferation of AI-generated content doesn’t crowd out the diverse voices that make literature vibrant and meaningful.\n\nMargaret: Yes, and publishers also need to establish ethical guidelines for the use of AI in literature. They should take measures to verify the authenticity of human-authored works, preventing the spread of misleading or harmful content. The publishing industry has a responsibility to maintain the integrity of literature.\n\nKurt: I think it’s also important for educational institutions and writing programs to adapt to the changing landscape. They should teach aspiring writers how to navigate the world of AI, use it as a creative tool, and maintain their individuality. We need to prepare the next generation of authors to thrive in this new literary environment.\n\nMargaret: That’s an excellent point, Kurt. The education of writers must evolve to reflect the technological advancements in the field. Aspiring authors should be equipped with the knowledge and skills to harness the potential of AI while preserving the art and craft of storytelling.\n\nKurt: Speaking of craft, Margaret, do you think that AI could ever truly replicate the deep emotional and intellectual understanding that human authors bring to their work? Can it write stories that resonate on a profound level?\n\nMargaret: It’s a challenging question. AI can mimic the appearance of depth and emotion in writing, but it lacks the genuine human experience and understanding that authors bring to their work. The complexities of human emotions, relationships, and the human condition are not easily replicated by algorithms. While AI can produce compelling stories, there’s a depth that only human authors can provide.\n\nKurt: That depth is what makes literature so powerful and enduring. It’s the ability of writers to capture the complexities of the human experience and convey them in a way that resonates with readers. AI may create engaging stories, but it may not touch the soul in the same way.\n\nMargaret: Exactly, Kurt. Literature has the power to move us, to make us think, to challenge our beliefs, and to bring about social change. It’s a reflection of our shared human experiences and emotions. AI can certainly entertain and inform, but it may not be able to inspire the same level of introspection and empathy that human-authored literature can.\n\nKurt: You know, Margaret, there’s something else that concerns me. As AI continues to advance, there’s a risk that it could be used to perpetuate existing biases and inequalities, whether consciously or unconsciously. We’ve seen this in other applications of AI, such as in hiring and criminal justice. How do we ensure that AI-generated literature doesn’t reinforce harmful stereotypes or biases?\n\nMargaret: That’s a crucial point, Kurt. AI systems can inherit biases from the data they are trained on, which is often drawn from historical sources that reflect societal biases. To prevent AI-generated literature from perpetuating these biases, it’s essential to rigorously scrutinize the data and algorithms used. Writers, publishers, and AI developers should be committed to promoting diversity, inclusivity, and ethical content.\n\nKurt: It’s not just about avoiding bias in content, but also in the way AI-generated content is promoted and disseminated. We need to be vigilant against the concentration of power in the hands of a few who might use AI-generated literature for their own agendas. It’s a question of ensuring that the literary world remains open and democratic.\n\nMargaret: That’s an excellent point, Kurt. We should be cautious about the concentration of power and the potential for AI-generated literature to be used for propaganda or manipulation. The literary world should remain a place where diverse voices are heard, where ideas are freely exchanged, and where the power of storytelling is a force for good.\n\nKurt: It’s a challenge, Margaret, but it’s also an opportunity. AI can help us reach wider audiences, break down language barriers, and make literature more accessible. We just need to harness its potential while being mindful of its limitations and ethical considerations.\n\nMargaret: Indeed, Kurt. AI can be a tool for democratizing literature and expanding its reach. It can help us bridge cultural and linguistic gaps, making literature a truly global and inclusive endeavor. But, as with any powerful tool, its use must be guided by a sense of responsibility and ethics.\n\nKurt: As we look to the future, Margaret, what do you think are the most critical considerations for the literary world as it navigates the age of AI? How can we ensure that literature continues to evolve and thrive while preserving its unique human essence?\n\nMargaret: One of the most critical considerations is the responsible and ethical use of AI in literature. We need guidelines and regulations to protect the integrity of the craft and ensure that diverse voices continue to be heard. We must also educate the next generation of writers to harness the potential of AI while preserving the art of storytelling.\n\nKurt: I agree, Margaret. Education and ethical guidelines are key. Additionally, we need to encourage experimentation and innovation in literature, using AI as a tool to explore new frontiers while preserving the authenticity of human creativity. Literature should continue to be a source of inspiration, challenge, and reflection for generations to come.\n\nMargaret: And we must always be vigilant against the misuse of AI-generated literature for propaganda or manipulation. The literary world should be a place where truth and creativity are valued above all else, where the power of storytelling is a force for good.\n\nKurt: Well, Margaret, it’s been a fascinating discussion. The future of literature is certainly at a crossroads, and it will be interesting to see how it unfolds in the age of AI.\n\nMargaret: It has been a pleasure, Kurt. The literary world is ever-evolving, and it’s up to us and future generations to ensure that it remains a vibrant and authentic reflection of the human experience. Thank you for this insightful conversation. Kurt: Thank you, Margaret. Here’s to a future where literature and AI coexist in harmony, pushing the boundaries of creativity while preserving the essence of human storytelling.\n\nBy Mark H. Phillips\n\nA professional writer takes explicit control over all the elements of writing: plot, character, setting, style, and theme. For many writers the hardest of these is theme. Thematic elements can include everything from the moral of a story, to a specific worldview, to leitmotifs and recurring topics. I prefer to look at theme through the lens of philosophy. You have a philosophy. You can’t help it. Whether you’ve unquestioningly accepted the current philosophy of your culture or individually reasoned one out from first principles, you’ve got one. And whether you write the great American novel or formulaic pulp action, your philosophy is going to show up in your fiction.\n\nPhilosophy may come to the forefront as a prime plot driver (say in a didactic novel like Atlas Shrugged which illustrates Ayn Rand’s Objectivist philosophy) or creep in as a pervasive approach to life (as in H. P. Lovecraft’s worldview that humans would go mad if they realized how utterly alien, meaningless, and malevolent the universe is. (Notice how this Lovecraftian theme meshes almost seamlessly with an extended exploration of endemic American racism in Matt Ruff’s Lovecraft Country or its HBO adaptation.)).\n\nYour philosophy may appear in woke or unwoke notions of race, gender roles, sexuality, or religion. How long do promiscuous women last in a typical slasher film? Women who step outside the roles the conservative patriarchy has assigned to them are brutally murdered by slashers wielding phallic weapons, often using first person camera to allow adolescent incels to vicariously punish what they most hate. It is no accident that women’s lib and slasher films arose at virtually the same time in a deeply conflicted and divided culture.\n\nWhat position does your protagonist take towards personal responsibility? A bad guy takes an innocent hostage and threatens to shoot her if our hero doesn’t drop his gun. In Tom Laughlin’s film Billy Jack, our hero says to go ahead and shoot her. The bad guy says, “You’d kill her? Just like that?” Billy says, “You’ll kill her. And then I’ll kill you. Just like that.” Imagine how different most action fiction would be if heroes took this position consistently. It hearkens back to the ethical philosophy of Socrates and is a refreshing alternative to the cliched hostage tropes we have to suffer through in countless action fiction.\n\nContrast Billy Jack’s philosophy of personal responsibility with the attitude of Batman in Frank Miller’s graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns. The Joker is wreaking havoc in an amusement park, handing out free, poisoned cotton candy to a whole troop of boy scouts. In a thought balloon the Joker imagines himself talking to Batman,\n\nThey could put me up in a helicopter and fly me up in the air and line the bodies head to toe on the ground in delightful geometric patterns like an endless June Taylor dancing routine—and it would never be enough. No, I don’t keep count. But you do. And I love you for it.\n\nBatman chases the Joker through a hall of mirrors and then into a tunnel of love, while the Joker is killing random innocents all along the way. Neither setting is accidental: the Joker considers himself as a twisted reflection of Batman locked in a perverted romantic seduction whose only logical conclusion is death. Thought balloons show Batman agonizing over every victim, just as the Joker wants him to. All because Batman will not kill. He has captured and sent the Joker to Arkham Asylum time after time. And time after time the Joker has escaped and added more victims. It’s Batman’s ongoing shame that all those deaths are the cost of his decision not to end the cycle once and for all, the ongoing price of maintaining his own, rigid moral code. He vows that this time will be different. When the Joker takes a hostage, Batman puts out the Joker’s right eye with a batarang. Eventually, badly wounded, Batman breaks the Joker’s neck to paralyze him and end his reign of terror. The Joker mocks him for not having the nerve to go all the way then ups the ante by suicidally completing the neck-breaking, killing himself to make the police think Batman is a murderer. All that drama depends entirely on Batman having a philosophy of personal responsibility for the acts of others very different from Billy Jack’s. A good writer consciously takes up these philosophical issues and uses them to drive his/her fiction.\n\nI just finished the first Shell Scott detective novel by Richard S. Prather. Our hero has been imprisoned with an innocent girl he’s been tracking. Their captors are a pair of vicious, murdering twins, and the captives are set to be executed as soon as night falls. Shell comes up with a desperate plan which works, leaving one twin shot dead and the other lying helpless on the floor. Shell and the girl escape. Shell knows that the other twin will most likely recover and come looking for vengeance. That is exactly what happens, and Shell is forced to go through a second gun battle resulting in the second twin’s death. Why didn’t he just shoot the second twin the first time he had him incapacitated? One bullet behind the ear and future problem solved. Prather can’t allow his goody-two-shoes hero to even contemplate taking such unfair advantage of a helpless opponent. It wouldn’t be fair. Shell kills, but he isn’t a killer. He only uses violence defensively, reactively. He’s the good guy.\n\nContrast Prather’s philosophy with a passage from Simon R. Greene’s Unnatural Inquirer. Our hero, John Taylor, has just won a desperate magical battle with the evil Kid Cthulhu. Lying on the floor, temporarily incapacitated, Kid Cthulhu says,\n\n“Kill you, Taylor. Kill you for this. Kill you and all your friends, and everyone you know. I have people. I’ll send them after you, and I’ll never stop, never. Never!”\n\n“I believe you,” I said. And I raised my foot and stamped down hard on the back of his fat neck. I felt as much as heard his neck break under my foot, and as easily as that the life went out of him. I stepped back. Bettie looked at me, horrified.\n\n“You killed him. Just like that. How could you?”\n\n“Because it was necessary,” I said. “You heard him.”\n\n“But . . . I never thought of you as a cold-blooded killer . . . You’re supposed to be better than that.”\n\n“Mostly I am,” I said. “But no-one threatens me and mine.”\n\n“I don’t know you at all, do I?” Bettie said slowly, looking at me steadily.\n\n“I’m just . . . who I have to be.”\n\nWhich hero do you want—the good guy who follows a sporting code at the cost of inviting future violence, or the ruthless, proactive violence of the hero who does what he must to protect the innocent? Each represents a different philosophy. The expert writer thinks out these philosophical acts and their ramifications. And he does so through the actions of the characters rather than inserting moral essays. Show versus tell.\n\nSome (rather cynical) writers may spend all their time trying to figure out their audiences’ philosophies and then write character actions to reinforce those (à la the slasher pictures that cashed in on male, anti-feminist rage). Other (more authentic, grounded) writers may incorporate their own philosophies into their fiction and just hope that resonates with an audience. Still other writers may try to work out a tough moral conundrum by putting different positions onto different characters and then setting up an environment to force a confrontation.\n\nIn the Republic, Plato uses the parable of the Ring of Gyges to illustrate his ethical theory. A shepherd finds a magical ring that renders him invisible. He proceeds to use it to seduce the queen and usurp the throne. Would you act morally if you were given the power to get away with any immorality without fear of consequences? Plato describes the human soul as divided into three parts: a rational part (impersonal, unbiased reason), a spirited/ambitious part (think the part that needs to win and excel at any endeavor), and an appetitive part (think id: lust, gluttony, addiction). We know they are distinct parts because they can conflict with one another. The athlete who craves glorious victory can resist the entreaties of his appetite to control his diet, but he can also ignore the rational advice of his doctors and attempt to compete before an injury has fully healed. Plato likens the moral individual as having a truly balanced soul. The soul is a chariot that wins the race of life by having the reason as driver, rigidly controlling the horse of appetite, and moderately controlling the horse of ambition, all for the good of the whole. What use is the Ring of Gyges to the balanced soul? It would only tempt him to allow the appetite or ambition to get out of control and thus crash the chariot. The best thing for the good man to do is put the Ring in a box and never touch it.\n\nOr perhaps throw it into the fires of Mordor? The Lord of the Rings is Tolkien’s extended working out of Plato’s theme, probably informed by the temptations of the U.S. to use nuclear weapons to fight the evils of Fascism and Communism. Gandalf or Galadriel are finely tuned balances of powerful soul elements. For either to take the Ring would be more dangerous to Middle-earth than for it to fall into Sauron’s “hands.” Only Frodo has the strength of character to bear the Ring and eschew its temptations.\n\nPlato’s philosophy of the tripartite soul was taken up and modified by Gene Roddenberry to form the dynamic relationship between Spock, McCoy, and Kirk on Star Trek. In episode after episode, the ethical solution to a dilemma is invariably Kirk’s synthesis of the emotionless logic of Spock and the overly emotional humanism of McCoy. Roddenberry’s ideal chariot has the explorer/warrior Kirk handling the horses of pure logic (Spock) and boundless care for sentient life (McCoy) for the good of the Enterprise and the beings it encounters.\n\nA skillful author can take competing notions of the good and force them to compete in action. Where the stakes are the highest, what values matter most? Suppose you took the sorting hat from J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books and used it on Roddenberry’s characters.\n\nYou might belong to Gryffindor,\n\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\n\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry,\n\nSet Gryffindors apart;\n\nYou might belong to Hufflepuff,\n\nWhere they are just and loyal,\n\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true\n\nAnd unafraid of toil;\n\nOr yet of wise old Ravenclaw,\n\nIf you’ve a ready mind,\n\nWhere those of wit and learning,\n\nWill always find their kind;\n\nOr perhaps in Slytherin,\n\nYou’ll make your friends,\n\nThose cunning folk use any means,\n\nTo achieve their ends.\n\nMcCoy goes to Hufflepuff. Spock goes to Ravenclaw. Kirk sure wants to go to Gryffindor. He might even resist when the hat tries to slot him into Slytherin. Maybe the hat reluctantly lets him have his way, but the Slytherin is there in him just like Harry’s parseltongue. The Kirk who cheated to be the only cadet to beat the Kobayashi Maru test is a Slytherin man. Remember that the real hero of the Harry Potter books, and the man after whom Harry names one of his sons, is a Slytherin. Kirk may be brave, daring, and chivalrous, but he above all wants to win, and if cunning works better than outright bravery, then cunning it is. It’s not the brave Kirk who defeats Khan; it’s the cunning Kirk who wins. Achilles is brave, daring, and chivalrous. But who won the Trojan War: brave Achilles or wily Odysseus? Kirk is an Odysseus figure. Kirk and Severus Snape would’ve gotten along just fine over at Slytherin House. And when everything is on the line, it’s Kirk and Severus I want on my side.\n\nKnowing the philosophies incorporated into the very essence of a particular genre can save you a lot of mistakes. If you are a sunny individual who opts to trust others until proven otherwise, you might not want to write noir fiction. If you’re a natural collectivist communitarian, you’re not going to be writing a genuine western successfully. I wouldn’t have encouraged Lovecraft to write any romcoms. Readers and writers often choose particular subgenres because they find them reliably in tune with their own philosophical worldview.\n\nBut if there is no niche out there for your own particular philosophy, go ahead and write what is authentic for you. Who knows, you might invent a new subgenre of your own and inspire a whole host of people to share your vision. It worked for H. P. Lovecraft, Carroll John Daly, and Ayn Rand. But whatever you choose, do it with calculated cunning. Go Slytherin."
