A number of years ago they were a mandated network but are no longer. They do pass audio description for a few shows through at least some cable partners, though probably not for newer episodes. Some shows are on the preschool channel only. We do not have any access to the schedule.\n\nPBS (Broadcast, Not Mandated)\n\nPBS (Public Broadcasting Service) was the first provider of audio description on television, and even today they broadcast more hours of audio described programming than any other Broadcast network. Yet ironically, they do not produce any listing of which shows have description, so it is difficult for us to provide that information to you. However, PBS does release a lot of described programming via several streaming options (in addition to broadcast), so we urge you to consult our listing of Partial List of Audio Described Shows on PBS for both what MAY be described locally for you AND for what you MAY be able to find online. Also, tvlistings.zap2it.com may be a helpful resource for finding described shows on PBS in your area. Look for the \"DVS\" notation in the show details.\n\nSYFY (Non-Broadcast, Not Mandated, 4 Series)\n\nSYFY, owned by Comcast subsidiary NBCUniversal, also broadcasts a number of movies with audio description.

We do not list them here, but they are usually listed on our Daily TV Schedule.\n\nNetworks may also offer limited access online to their series after initial airing, in some cases with AD but only available on specific platforms. ABC and CBS offers on-demand content with AD through their app/website, NBC and USA through Xfinity's Stream/X1 platform, and PBS offers very limited AD through their app/website. See our Streaming Page for details.\n\nPlease notify the webmaster of additional series that you find described or if you locate schedules exclusively for described shows.\n\nGo Time Block: Hearst Media Production Group (formerly Litton Entertainment), who produces the Saturday Morning series for four of the networks above, also produces what used to be called the Go Time block of children's programming with audio description for syndication, primarily to independent stations.

We suggest that visiting our own TV by Days listing is your best resource for finding described movies.\n\nThe FCC reviews the list of stations to be mandated every three years and selects the top five non-broadcast networks based on Nielson reports from the previous two years, taking into consideration exemptions granted based on the nature of programming. Current exemptions include Fox News, ESPN, and MSNBC.\n\nIn 2015, The History Channel was substituted for Nickelodeon by the FCC as a mandated network\n\nIn mid-2018, the FCC mandated substitution of HGTV and the Discovery Channel for Disney and TNT as mandated nonbroadcast networks, plus increased the minimum amount of programming per quarter to 87.5 hours, with limited credit for repeats. USA Network gained an exception regarding repeats, but still had the most described shows.\n\nOn July 1, 2021: Discovery and USA became no longer mandated. The five mandated nonbroadcast networks became Hallmark (new), HGTV, History, TBS, and TLC (new).
