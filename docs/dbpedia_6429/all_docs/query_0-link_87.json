        "text": "Chapter 3\n\nStretching the Caricatural Aesthetic\n\nFOOTWEAR MANUFACTURERS TRAFFICKED IN three-dimensional wares mostly made of leather, but the circulation of footwear was mediated by ephemeral two-dimensional textual and pictorial documents like catalogues, price lists, invoices, receipts, patterns, and fashion plates printed on paper. Fashion plates regularly published with issues of Le Moniteur de la Cordonnerie and Le Franc ParleurParisien represented an array of various women’s and men’s models in profile in a visually legible matrix of footwear styles labeled by name. It was sometimes acknowledged, however, that even a skilled drawing could not capture the nuances of an especially well-made shoe and the materials that had been combined to make it.1 Subscribers were encouraged to make footwear in the latest styles that were depicted in fashion plates and offer these items for sale to their customers. Patterns were also published regularly in the trade press that subscribers could unfold, cut out, and use as templates to make component parts of specific models of footwear.2 In each case, two-dimensional plates and patterns printed on paper anticipated the construction of wearable three-dimensional footwear fabricated from leather and other materials.\n\nThe homology between two-dimensional drawn representations and the corresponding three-dimensional objects helped to animate the international circulation of footwear. A similar correspondence animated Méliès’ film practice, which relied on two-dimensional drawings as the basis of many of the key components of the three-dimensional worlds he created in his studio, which were then remediated as two-dimensional films and photographs.3 Méliès’ “artificially arranged scenes” were dense with action and objects, like many of the caricatures Méliès drew for weekly issues of La Griffe in 1889–1890 using the pseudonym “Géo. Smile,” which were lithographed in several colors similar to the way fashion plates were printed. Just as fashion plates mediated footwear, Méliès’ caricatures for La Griffe mediated scores of different objects, albeit in a considerably less verisimilar fashion.\n\nThis chapter explores the productive tension between two-dimensional drawings and three-dimensional objects, beginning with Méliès’ caricatures for La Griffe and continuing with the importance of drawing for Méliès’ film production process. Méliès made many preparatory drawings for his films on paper with pencil and/or ink, which mediated the material objects that Méliès had modeled them on and/or had imagined. He sketched designs for scenery, costumes, and props that were then fabricated on a larger scale as physical objects from wood, fabric, paint, and other materials. Integrated into the mise-en-scène of his film productions, the backdrops, scenery, props, and costumes were juxtaposed in the studio with performers playing their roles. The film production process then transformed these three-dimensional bodies and objects into mostly two-dimensional strips of negative film, which took on more palpable volume when rolled and stored on reels and inside of canisters. After the negatives were developed, edited, printed on lengths of positive film stock, and sometimes hand-colored, Méliès’ film titles were then sold, purchased, and projected onto flat screens. Together with the illumination of the light source, the intermittent mechanism of the projector endowed these flat translucent strips of celluloid with illusory movement and depth, the screened scenes seeming to transpire in three-dimensional space. The visual paradox of cinema’s deceptive dimensionality was explicitly thematized in a number of Méliès’ films that show the transformation of two-dimensional representations into moving three-dimensional figures.4\n\nSome of the drawings Méliès made in preparation for specific films were on the backs of sheets of letterhead for the Manufacture de Films pour Cinématographes G. Méliès, and some were drawn in color. As a surface for the inscription of text, letterhead, as Lisa Gitelman points out, blurs the distinction “between a blank and (blank) paper” inasmuch as it combined clearly demarcated spaces to be filled in with an entirely blank slate of sorts.5 Like most letterhead, Méliès’ “official letterhead work[ed] like filling in a blank form” with spaces in which the date could be specified (within the decade) and an expansive empty space on the sheet for the body of the missive itself.6 Letterhead that was not drawn upon was used to correspond with others in the film business, both in France and internationally.7 By drawing on the verso side of his letterhead, Méliès creatively misused the work of job printers intended for official textual correspondence with individuals and entities outside his organization. He also sometimes extended the material limits of the letterhead itself to better suit his purposes. A long horizontal sketch made for Le Raid Paris-Monte Carlo en deuxheures was drawn on the backs of multiple sheets of letterhead that were trimmed, laid end to end, and taped together.8\n\nFor Méliès, drawing was an integral part of the production process. In enumerating the arts that were employed in filmmaking, Méliès placed drawing just after the dramatic arts at the head of the list.9 Méliès did not compose written film scenarios, claiming that the way he worked “consisted of inventing the details before the whole thing” and that whatever story there was in his films served as “only the thread intended to link ‘effects’ without much of a relationship to each other.”10 Thus, Méliès emphasized, “the script was without any importance because my only aim was to use it as an excuse for mise-en-scène.”11 The survival of a number of drawings made in preparation for specific films confirms that drawing—not writing—was the most crucial component of Méliès’ preproduction process.12 Long after Méliès stopped making films, when he believed most of his films no longer existed, Méliès made numerous ex post facto drawings of scenes he could remember from his films, often recalling the mise-en-scène with remarkable accuracy, and he sometimes captioned them too.13 Drawings not only provided the basis of Méliès’ mise-en-scène and functioned as aides demémoire for films he believed to be lost, they also modeled the very studios in which he produced many of his films. Although Méliès’ first film studio was abandoned in 1923 after the Montreuil property on which it was built was sold, falling into disrepair before being demolished in 1948, detailed drawings made of it do survive.14\n\nStudies of Méliès typically mention his pseudonymous caricatures for La Griffe, but the drawings themselves have rarely been examined. For Georges Sadoul, who reproduced one of Méliès’ caricatures from La Griffe in his Méliès monograph, Méliès’ political cartoons were evidence that despite being “shut up in his studio,” Méliès had not “forgotten the reality of the contemporary world.”15 Sadoul pointed to the series of films Méliès made in 1899 detailing the Dreyfus Affair as further evidence, while acknowledging that few of Méliès’ films were quite as politicized as Affaire Dreyfus.16 Looking closely at Méliès’ films, however, one can sometimes find the kinds of critique that caricature makes visible: notice the air pollution that besmirches the skyline in the painted backdrop of the fourth tableau of Voyage dans la Lune, the massive cannon and projectile that visually dominate the film’s next few tableaus, and the highly ironic take on the self-satisfaction of colonialism with which the film concludes, the latter resonating with one of Méliès’ caricatures, “La Raison du Plus Fort . . .” (La Griffe, January 23, 1890).17\n\nMore often, however, Méliès’ films offer what Donald Crafton, in his excellent book on Émile Cohl, Méliès’ contemporary and fellow caricaturist, describes as “satire de moeurs (satire of manners), or essentially nonpolitical comments on French social life.”18 For example, Méliès took satirical aim at contemporaneous fads like the Cakewalk dance, which he quite literally demonized inLe Cake-Walk infernal, and roller skating, which he made comedic in The Woes of Roller Skaters.19 But, for Sadoul, it was drawing—more than caricature specifically—that was of decisive importance for Méliès’ overall aesthetic.20 Like photography and cinema, drawing is a two-dimensional medium, but unlike photographs or films, drawings have an entirely arbitrary relationship to the three-dimensional world that they may or may not represent, more or less faithfully, in two dimensions on paper. Indeed, drawing is infinitely malleable, and in many ways, it was Méliès’ preferred medium.\n\nA Caricatural Aesthetic\n\nThroughout his life, Méliès was a “compulsive draughtsman,” as Paul Hammond and Paolo Cherchi Usai both put it.21 In his memoirs, Méliès wrote he had become possessed by the “demon of drawing” as a schoolboy and recalled that his notebooks and even his textbooks were “copiously illustrated” with countless sketches; he declared that he would continue drawing until his dying day, and indeed he did.22 The drawings Méliès made in profusion throughout his life subtended his overlapping careers as a footwear manufacturer, caricaturist, illusionist, filmmaker, musical theater actor-director-manager, and toy retailer.23 Drawings Méliès made during every phase of his life survive, but with the exception of the twenty-six caricatures he drew for La Griffe, most were unpublished during his lifetime.24 Many more were dispersed, discarded, destroyed, or otherwise lost. Although a number of Méliès drawings were published posthumously, researchers have paid them relatively little attention in their own right.\n\nSeveral of Méliès’ earliest films, Dessinateur express (M. Thiers) [lost], Dessinateur (Chamberlain) [lost], Dessinateur (Reine Victoria) [lost], and Dessinateur (Von Bismarck) [lost], directly incorporated the act of drawing. Although the films are lost, the titles indicate that each was a “quick-sketch” or “lightning sketch” film in which a performer—likely Méliès himself—drew a likeness of the named celebrity in real time on a chalk board or a large tablet.25 Before animated films, quick-sketch films flourished as a genre—and some of the earliest animated films, including Cohl’s Fantasmagorie, combined animation created by successive single frame exposures with filmed quick-sketch performances, segueing between the respective modes.26 Méliès subsequently embedded quick-sketch performances with chalk on a chalkboard in La Luneàunmètre, Le Chevalier mystère, Voyage dans la Lune, and Le Roidumaquillage.27 Quick-sketch films thematized their own evanescence: as soon as the drawings were wiped from the chalkboard, the celluloid on which the quick-sketch performances were recorded was the only tangible record of the respective drawings. Similarly, the lithographed covers of a handful of surviving copies of La Griffe are all that remains of the corresponding drawings made by Méliès. A similar evanescence defined the art of the Incohérents. In most cases, the engravings published in Incohérent exposition catalogues (which were themselves made from drawings) are often the only visual records of the utterly ephemeral artworks themselves, which have perished or were discarded. So too for examples of footwear manufactured by the Maison Méliès and the Société Méliès, which have mostly vanished: what survives are engraved images printed in catalogues and fashion plates.\n\nElsewhere, I have examined how a number of Méliès’ caricatures for La Griffe mocked the political movement of Boulangism and its namesake, the former general Georges Boulanger, whom Méliès and other contributors to La Griffe had nicknamed “Barbenzingue” (Zinc-Beard).28 These caricatures were consumed privately and individually as well as publicly and collectively. In 1880, one French elected official pointed out fearfully about caricatures that were posted in booksellers’ windows and elsewhere, “drawing strikes the sight of passersby, addresses itself to all ages and both sexes, startles not only the mind but the eyes. It is a means of speaking even to the illiterate, of stirring up passions, without reasoning, without discourse.”29\n\nInstead of interpreting the symbolic meanings caricatures impute to nearly everything in an enframed image, my approach here is more straightforwardly iconographic. Art historian (and classical film theorist) Erwin Panofsky defined iconography as “a description or classification of images [. . .] which [. . .] furnishes the necessary basis for all further interpretation” but requires historians “to familiarize ourselves with what the authors of those representations [. . .] knew.”30 Rather than interpreting these images or identifying the caricatured individuals, I consider the range of bodies and objects that make up the mise-en-cadre of Méliès’ caricatures for La Griffe. The individuals in these caricatures are overwhelmingly male, which is at least partly a function of the journal’s focus on historically male-dominated activities like politics, international relations, and military and judicial matters, constituting a remarkably homosocial drawn universe. Of the twenty-six caricatures Méliès drew for La Griffe, only two contain recognizably female figures, “1890” (January 2, 1890) and “L’Influenza” (December 26, 1889). A third, “Adam et Eve” (August 29, 1889), inverts costume as a denotation of gender by depicting a man with a mustache and a beard cross-dressed in a corset and bustle alongside a hirsute naked man wearing only riding boots and spurs.31 Similarly, “1890” depicts a woman as an object of display, unveiled by a mustachioed face peeking from behind a curtain.32 Women in numerous Méliès films are often posed statically like “1890,” sometimes atop literal pedestals, fragmented with individual body parts isolated onscreen, and/or choreographed in ornamental dancing formations.33\n\nOne major category of objects in Méliès’ caricatures for La Griffe are fashion items. Fashion is explicitly invoked in the caricature “Le Mannequin” (September 5, 1889), which foregrounds the torso of a mannequin on a stand, on which a hollow fake head is perched. “Le Mannequin” also explicitly thematizes the difference between three-dimensional representations like the mannequin and a bust perched on a shelf, and the two-dimensional signage on the wall. Clothing itself flexes between two and three dimensionality in both its making and its daily use. Indeed, articles of clothing are typically constructed from pieces of fabric and often stored flat by being hung or folded, fully taking shape only when worn or draped. Footwear is constructed likewise from flat pieces of leather. During the late-nineteenth century, this sometimes involved using paper patterns published with footwear industry journals or available for purchase, all of which were flat and could easily be sent through the mail.\n\nCaricatures necessarily represent footwear and clothing in two dimensions. Items of clothing, especially pants and coats that vary in drawn color, cut, and condition, are important primary elements of Méliès’ La Griffe caricatures. Clothing serves as an indicator of status and social class. Boots, including riding boots, a Méliès specialty, most of which are colored black like much of the men’s footwear manufactured by the Société Méliès, some accessorized with spurs or spats, recur in these caricatures. In Méliès’ caricatures for La Griffe, footwear is disproportionately small and often clustered near the bottom of the frame, proximate to the captions.\n\nHeadgear, by contrast, is emphasized, and is often disproportionately large relative to other objects. Different styles, shapes, and sizes of hats appear in each and every one of Méliès’ caricatures for La Griffe. Hats were an especially expressive part of the semantic vocabulary of fashion and could indicate a wearer’s profession and identify the individual with specific national and/or historical contexts. (This in fact comprises the entirety of Cohl’s film Histoiredechapeaux in which a succession of historical periods are conveyed entirely through a series of different hats.) In Méliès’ caricatures, hats drawn as two-dimensional shapes serve a similar function to communicate the profession and the social status of various individuals. Hats were so expressive (and so recognizable at a glance) that the morphology of headgear supported its own subcategory of performance, chapeaugraphy, which flourished during the late nineteenth century, often in the hands of magicians, including Méliès’ contemporary Félicien Trewey, a renowned chapeaugrapher. Chapeaugraphy was a mode of manual dexterity premised on manipulating a ring of felt to form approximations of different forms of headgear.34\n\nIn her study of Charles Baudelaire’s essays on caricature, Michèle Hannoosh describes the “caricatural aesthetic” as being “as impermanent as the events it chronicled.”35 Caricatures, Hannoosh concludes via Baudelaire, “provide a historical record, a collection of anecdotes and facts, and constitute part of the national archives; they are comparable to pages of a newspaper, short-lived and fleeting, wholly subject to the winds of time.”36 Hannoosh argues, “Maintaining a likeness while simultaneously deforming it, preserving in its distortion the very object it attacks, caricature occupies a special place in the vanguard of artistic change.”37 The maintenance of likenesses makes individual objects and people in caricatures recognizable, but as Hannoosh suggests, the “caricatural aesthetic” also entails deformations.\n\nThe “caricatural aesthetic” relishes nonverisimilar representational strategies, including pronounced distortions of scale. One of the most dramatic examples in Méliès’ caricatures for La Griffe is the massive carrot Barbenzingue straddles in “Le Roi Carotte” (September 12, 1889). Fully the size of a steed, the giant carrot is instantly recognizable as such, even without reference to the title of the caricature or a look at the other carrots—several of which are freakishly large—that trail behind Barbenzingue in the field.38 The caricatural aesthetic represents size in relative, rather than verisimilar, terms. Thus, one of the five individuals in Méliès’ caricature “La Triple Alliance” (La Griffe, January 9, 1890), the balding, spike-headed figure in the middle ground, is considerably larger than the others, two of whom are leashed like playthings by lengths of chain. The other two individuals, both in military uniforms, are the relative size of toy soldiers.39\n\nScale can be similarly variable in Méliès’ films. Sometimes, a single object is somewhat out of proportion with other parts of the mise-en-scène, allowing a relevant profilmic detail to be clearly seen in a long shot. These include the four-leaf clover the witch gives to the wandering troubadour in La FéeCarabosse and the key to the forbidden chamber Bluebeard’s seventh wife finds in Barbe-Bleue. Props like these are disproportionately large and unduly flat, as are the facsimiles of a series of food and drink items carried by a procession of servants for the wedding feast in Barbe-Bleue.40 In films like Le Chapeau à surprises and Le MerveilleuxÉventailvivant, the objects themselves, a top hat that is the size of a child and a fan that is taller than a person, respectively, are resolutely three-dimensional, but caricaturally oversized, like the root vegetable in “Le Roi Carotte.”\n\nOne of the largest figures in Méliès’ caricatures for La Griffe is the homunculus he drew to represent the “Russian flu” pandemic of 1889 in “L’Influenza” (December 26, 1889). Wearing a cowl labeled with the words “Dengue Fever,” the sallow-colored fiend with pointed ears, sharp teeth, long thin fingers, and long sharp fingernails and toenails towers over buildings and people in the streets below. It steps over a long line of people, at least two of whom are women, queued up outside of a pharmacy door.41 The size differential between the homunculus and the humans in the street, two of whom are in the throes of physical distress caused by the virus, is like the difference between the snow giant and the polar explorers in Méliès’ later film À la conquêteduPôle. The towering homunculus in “L’Influenza” looks as if it could easily pick up several people, which is just what the snow giant does in À la conquêteduPôle, taking several humans in his hand before gobbling them up in his gaping maw—an effect Méliès created with a giant marionette.42\n\nThe staggering scale of the pandemic meant the homunculus that represents it fills nearly the entire frame of “L’Influenza.” Indeed, it killed more than a million people worldwide before eventually dissipating in 1892.43 Epidemiologists believe the pandemic may have been caused by cattle—the source of the leather supply—infecting humans with a strain of the coronavirus. The spread of the virus during the fall of 1889 was undoubtedly accelerated and extended by modern transportation:\n\nIn October 1889 the pandemic spread rapidly out of Russia heading west, east, and south. Mapping the movement of the pandemic [. . .] revealed the railroad’s role in rapidly spreading the disease. Influenza traveled with infected passengers, and the stops on the rail line served as the epicenters of spread into different regions. [. . .] Larger cities served as nodes of spread, with the infection then moving to smaller cities and towns and then into the rural communities. [. . .] The data showed that steamships, too, played a role in transmitting the disease. The steamships were larger than their sail-powered predecessors, giving them larger populations for sustaining chains of infection; they were also faster, allowing them to deliver people still actively contagious. As a result, they brought the pandemic to every port [. . .] and from them the infection rapidly penetrated the interior via rail and river lines.44\n\nThe transportation networks that made the Société Méliès a successful international business also spread the virus. These same networks underpinned the international mail systems that facilitated the traffic in raw materials, footwear, and styles of footwear, along with dozens of international footwear industry trade periodicals and caricature journals.\n\nWriting in 1893, John Grand-Carteret, an early historian of caricature, emphasized the transnationalism of caricature, noting that “the wide circulation of the press”—and the illustrated press specifically—made caricature a mode of international exchange.45 Exchange was made possible by mail systems that facilitated the circulation of flat and folded documents in envelopes of various sizes. Copies of La Griffe circulated intracontinentally on railroad trains that also carried parcels containing shoes and boots manufactured by the Société Méliès.46\n\nElasticity\n\nComparing the caricatures Méliès drew for successive issues of La Griffe, the nose and ears of Barbenzingue become larger and more misshapen. In his caricature for the first issue of La Griffe, “Trop de Pression!!!” (August 8, 1889), Méliès drew Barbenzingue’s nose and ears in a relatively naturalistic way, but Barbenzingue’s nose becomes more bulbous and the ears more enormous in Méliès’ caricatures for subsequent issues. Barbenzingue’s countenance thus has the quality of “plasmaticness,” which film theorist Sergei Eisenstein used to describe the elasticity of Disney films.47 Paging through successive issues of La Griffe, Barbenzingue’s ears become larger than his head in “Le Roi Carotte” (September 12, 1889) and Barbenzingue’s nose extends, culminating with “Pauvre Exilé sur la Terre Étrangere!!!” (October 24, 1889), in which his disproportionately small finger is inserted into the nostril of his oversized proboscis. One recurring figure in a number of Méliès’ caricatures for La Griffe inexplicably grows a hump in “Le Mannequin” (September 5, 1889), which continues to bulge in “Un Enterrement de Première Classe” (October 10, 1889), in which a coffin is perched atop the hump; “Le Coup de Balai des Invalidations” (November 7, 1889), in which the curved-back figure has peg legs and is being swept down the stairs by a broom; “Les Députés Boulangistes en Route pour Jersey” (November 14, 1889), in which the figure’s bulging hump is ringed by several inflated bladders serving as flotation devices to aid swimming; and “La Grande Manifestation Boulangiste” (November 21, 1889), in which the humpbacked figure is inexplicably costumed like a frog while leaping into a fountain.48 Like Disney films, within the representational world of Méliès’ caricatures, sometimes “beasts [. . .] have a habit of stretching and shrinking.”49 A surviving preparatory sketch for an unidentified Méliès film shows the limbs and neck of a traditional French Pierrot clown figure extending in phases: first its legs, then its neck, and finally its arms attenuate to snake-like lengths while another Pierrot figure seated in a chair looks on surprised.50 How Méliès might have planned on accomplishing this effect cinematically—or perhaps succeeded in a film that is no longer extant—is entirely unclear.\n\nIn “Trop de Pression!” the quality of stretching is implicitly ascribed to the materiality of rubber. This caricature includes a number of objects one imagines are made of rubber, including an oversized balloon-Barbenzingue in colorful military regalia floating overhead and multiple hoses through which it has been overinflated to bursting.51 Rubber came into widespread use in the mid-nineteenth century. As the French footwear industry sought viable substitutes for leather and wood, flexible resilient substances derived from tree sap—rubber and gutta-percha—were widely used for making footwear and molding heels. Vulcanized rubber was waterproof and it could also be painted, making it an especially versatile material for shoes and boots.52 During the 1850s, American manufacturers began producing footwear entirely made out of rubber, and this development was closely followed by the French footwear industry.53 Rubber, of course, had many other applications, including bicycle tires, represented on the high-wheel bicycle in the caricature “Le Char de l’État” (La Griffe, November 28, 1889).54\n\nRubber was a quintessentially incoherent modern material inasmuch as it refused definitive form when superheated to liquidity and remained flexible as a vulcanized solid. In Méliès’ aesthetic, the flexibility of rubber was homologous with the representational flexibility of drawing as a medium. The portrait-charge, a genre of caricature that was widely used by caricaturists associated with the Incohérents, was based on conjoining a disproportionately large head on a disproportionately small body, “the practice of drawing a large caricatural head on a squat comic torso.”55 The periodical Les Hommes d’aujourd’hui, with which La Griffe seems to have been loosely affiliated, published a portrait-charge on the cover of each of its issues.56 Méliès drew portrait-charges, including a self-portrait and a drawing of his father in this format, both of which were hand-colored.57\n\nMéliès’ film L’hommeà la têteàcaoutchouc makes the oversized head of the portrait-charge into a spectacular effect by showing a “chemist in his laboratory” (according to Méliès’ American catalogue) inflating his own head with a “rubber hose.”58 However, his assistant over-inflates the head with a bellows, causing it to explode. The film recalls Méliès’ caricature “Trop de Pression!!!” as Paul Hammond and Anne-Marie Quévrain have noted.59 But, unlike drawing the head of a figure larger than the body, or photographing frame by frame incremental drawn changes of scale to make the head of a figure appear to grow larger or smaller, as Cohl did in Fantasmagorie, Le Binetoscope, and other animated films for Gaumont, Méliès had himself filmed against a black background on a dolly that moved his head closer to the camera to visually simulate its expansion. This was double exposed with a shot of Méliès and his assistant in long shot in front of a backdrop with a black field painted in its center.60 The title of the film Méliès made immediately before L’hommeà la têteàcaoutchouc was Le Bataillonélastique (cocasseriefantastique) [lost], which suggests that it likewise dealt with elasticity, perhaps in a military context, but nothing is known of the film apart from its title.\n\nA Méliès drawing that he made later depicts the explosion of his over-inflated head in L’hommeà la têteàcaoutchouc—the point at which (as the American catalogue description explains), “The head swells until it bursts with a crash, knocking over the two experimenters.”61 Méliès recalled the setting with a fair degree of accuracy, including the central black field that facilitated the double exposure in the film and much of the other detail painted on the backdrop: the laboratory sign that hangs over the doorway frame right, the table and the platform atop it, the bellows, and even the stools, which appear in a number of different Méliès films.62 But, for this ex post facto drawing, which he signed and titled “L’homme à la tête à caoutchouc: Trop de Pression!! . . . Catastrophe!!!” Méliès chose a moment that was impossible to show in a live-action film and thus had to be imagined: the moment the head explodes, the directional force of the explosion visibly propelling shards of his skull (and presumably his brain) in a starburst that breaks the glass of the laboratory door. The look on the oversized head registers surprise, and a much smaller Méliès looks up from his bellows with even greater surprise as his assistant’s stool tips over from the blast on the other side of the room (one of the few spatial transpositions that does not match the mise-en-scène of the film). In the film, this moment is implied, elided by an abrupt substitution splice that joined a shot of the head appearing to expand to a shot of an explosion and the central table toppling forward as a large cloud of smoke billows and both Méliès and the other performer in the scene are sent sprawling onto the ground; another substitution splice completely clears the smoke instantaneously.63\n\nMéliès devised another visual effect to simulate inflatable bodies for the film Le Raid Paris-Monte Carlo en deuxheures, which was commissioned to be part of a theatrical revue at the Folies-Bergère.64 After more than three hundred performances in which the film was shown, producing “gales of laughter,” according to promotional materials, black-and-white and colored versions were offered for sale. The film shows a reckless automobilist careening first through the streets of Paris and then via Dijon on the road to Monte Carlo. The careless automobilist backs over a policeman, “who, by the passage of the automobile over his body, is flattened out as thin as a sheet of paper,” explains the American catalogue description; then, the driver “takes his pneumatic pump, adjusts it to the body of the crushed man, and with a few vigorous strokes of the handle he succeeds in starting him to swell,” but drives off in a hurry. Several onlookers commandeer three additional pumps from a garage, which they connect to the flattened body with rubber hoses. A crowd gathers while the bystanders are together “pumping up the policeman to his original size,” and when the crowd parts, a substitution splice has replaced the flat clothing on the ground with the fully formed body of the police officer moving spasmodically on the ground as the onlookers continue to apply themselves to the pumps. The crowd forms again, concealing a direct view of the police officer’s body, but the bystanders at the pumps “become so animated in their efforts that they cause the poor unfortunate to explode” in a puff of smoke that sends everyone running.65\n\nIllusions of Dimension and Scale\n\nThe transformation from flatness to three-dimensionality is one of the recurring motifs of Méliès’ cinema.66 These transformations thematize the material characteristics that allowed for the kinds of transnational exchange and circulation previously discussed. In the Méliès films Le Livremagique, Les Cartesvivantes, and Les Affiches en goguette transformation occurs when representations—illustrations in books, oversized playing cards, and poster images, respectively—come to life, stepping off of pages, pasteboards, and the apparent surface of a lithographed poster. In Le Livremagique, a man (Méliès) brings forth a large book that is taller than he is. He places the thin book, which is bilingually titled “Le Livre Magique” and “The Magical Book,” upright on a low table and proceeds to turn its several pages, each of which contains an illustration of a character from a fairy tale or pantomime. Each drawing is signed “Méliès.” Méliès the performer reaches a hand up to each illustration in succession, and with a series of substitution splices, individuals costumed to match the illustrations step down from the book in succession, five in all, and move about in front of the table, leaving the corresponding pages of the upright book blank. After the characters gather together momentarily, Méliès returns them one by one to the book: as he ushers each one onto the low table, a substitution splice causes the live performer to vanish in a flash and the corresponding illustration to reappear instantaneously. But the fifth performer, a Pierrot figure, refuses to be returned to motionless two-dimensionality. First it tries to hide, and then when Méliès manages to get it onto the table, it is not transformed into an illustration, and Méliès closes the book, but Pierrot’s resolutely three-dimensional body prevents the book from closing and becoming flat again. Instead it reappears in front of the book as if passing magically through the cover, and steps down off of the table. Méliès tries to grab it, but Pierrot eludes his grasp, vanishing and reappearing on the other side of the frame before Méliès manages to get hold of it and put it back on the table in front of the book, whereupon Pierrot vanishes. Méliès opens the book to the page that was formerly blank, and Pierrot is now an illustration once again. Méliès laughs and closes the book. Standing in front of the book, Méliès takes a bow, but the book tumbles down on him, flattening him instantaneously and causing him to vanish. He re-enters the scene through a door in the background, takes another bow, and walks forward, takes the book down off of the table, and carries it out of the frame.\n\nLes Cartesvivantes enacts a similar series of transformations from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality and back, but combines these transformations with illusions of scale. Playing the role of the magician, Méliès enlarges a playing card through several well-placed substitution splices and then throws it at a huge blank surface atop a stand, “which immediately has outlined upon its surface the face of a huge nine of spades.”67 Through a dissolve, the enormous nine of spades is transformed into a humongous queen of hearts and with another substitution splice and a dissolve, the represented queen becomes a living person dressed like the queen who steps off the oversized pasteboard, leaving a blank expanse on the face of the giant card that now shows only its suit, a heart, in the upper left corner.68 The living queen steps down from the stand to the ground as Méliès kisses her hand. She turns around and steps back onto the stand, where Méliès positions her carefully and steps away before another substitution splice and another dissolve transforms her back into a two-dimensional representation. Another dissolve transforms the humongous queen of hearts into a humongous king of clubs, and a living person dressed like the king bursts through the surface of the giant card, and with a substitution splice, leaves a blank expanse on the face of the giant card that shows only a club in the corner. The king steps down from the stand, Méliès steps out of the frame, and with a substitution splice, throws off his royal raiment, revealing Méliès in a tuxedo who takes a bow and leaps upward, seemingly absorbed into the blank card. Méliès then appears behind the card, steps down from the stand, raises his arms, and then exits the frame. The scene is quickly replaced by a full-screen copyright notice for “Geo. Méliès. Paris, New-York.”\n\nOther magicians performed versions of expanding playing cards at this time, including Joseffy, who used an elaborate mechanism with which “A queen of hearts, held in the magician’s hand, visibly and instantly expands to many times its original size.” The apparatus survives and involves a “spring-loaded mechanism” connected to a “giant hand-painted silk card,” although the queen of hearts only grew to the size of a sheet of paper rather than the size of a person as in Les Cartesvivantes.69 The inverse illusion, “Cartes diminuées,” in which cards diminished some four times in size when pressed between the magician’s fingers, was also available from the Paris magic dealer Maison Caroly, whose proprietor Jean Caroly was a member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Prestidigitation of which Méliès was the longtime president, and which held its monthly meetings at the Théâtre Robert-Houdin.70\n\nThe ending of Le MenuetLilliputien [incomplete] offers a cinematic version of Caroly’s “Cartes diminuées” in which the size of four oversized playing cards are reduced to normal size in two increments, effectively reversing the action of Les Cartesvivantes. But, the film begins with an “art to life” illusion whereby a statue comes to life, although this part is missing from the only known surviving print. According to the American catalogue description, Le MenuetLilliputien began as follows:\n\nA magnificent marble statue is carelessly supported upon an amphora of the same material. Under the passes of a prestidigitateur, the statue becomes animated and serves him as an assistant. The latter takes a pack of ordinary playing cards and places them in a casket of glass. Four cards, the king of spades, the queen of hearts, the queen of clubs, and the king of diamonds, come out of the pack individually and go into the hands of the juggler without any apparent assistance. He places the four cards upright on a small platform, and there the four of them become animated, leave the surface of the cards, advance to the middle of the platform, and dance a minuet gracefully and prettily, the figures preserving the diminutive size of those on the cards.71\n\nThe surviving fragment of Le MenuetLilliputien shows four miniature monarchs dancing on a raised tabletop as four blank playing cards each bearing a different suit, tip upward to a vertical position behind the dancers. This segment of the film emphasizes the visible difference between the flatness of mostly two-dimensional and mostly static pasteboards and the fullness of moving and rotating three-dimensional figures.\n\nIn Le MenuetLilliputien, the dancing monarchs are moving miniatures, an effect created by superimposing shots of a group of performers filmed from a distant camera position with shots of one or more performers taken from a closer camera position against a backdrop containing a black background, something Méliès also did in the film Le Voyage de Gulliver à Lilliput etchezlesGéants.72 In Le MenuetLilliputien, this illusion involved shots of four normal-sized performers and four oversized playing cards. (Indeed, the same oversized queen of hearts, king of clubs, blank hearts, and blank clubs cards used in Les Cartesvivantes appear to have also been used in making Le MenuetLilliputien; the catalogue numbers of the respective films, numbers 678–679 and numbers 690–692, respectively, indicate that Le MenuetLilliputien was produced not long after Les Cartesvivantes, with only three film titles intervening between these two playing card films.73) The shot of the Lilliputians’ minuet was double exposed with a shot of Méliès and his assistant in long shot in front of a backdrop with a black field painted in its center.74\n\nAlthough the moment in Le MenuetLilliputien when the monarchs depicted on the face cards “leave the surface of the cards” does not appear to be extant, it must have been similar to the corresponding effect in Les Cartesvivantes when the queen of hearts and the king of clubs appear to step off the surface of the respective oversized playing cards into three-dimensionality. But, the surviving fragment of Le MenuetLilliputien does show what the catalogue description described as follows, “The dance over, each returns to its place before its corresponding playing card, and is mysteriously merged into the card as at first.”75 Touted in the catalogue as “an entirely new trick,” it appears to be the same effect used in Les Cartesvivantes when the queen of hearts “is at once transformed into a playing card.”76 Lined up next to one another, the cards rise and drop in an alternating rhythm as the magician and his assistant, flanking the table, look on. After a substitution splice ends the double-exposed sequence, the magician gathers up the four cards (perfectly matched in size to the human-sized playing cards miniaturized in double exposure), which are now palpably material as well as visibly flat. Quickly stacked twice against his knee, they diminish in size two times before disappearing altogether as he appears to toss them aside, illusions accomplished with three well-placed substitution splices. Méliès joins hands with his assistant and they take a bow, then exit the frame. Le MenuetLilliputien and Les Cartesvivantes are illusions of scale as well as dimensional illusions in which two-dimensional representations magically become three-dimensional figures and living people thin out to flat simulacra just as instantaneously.\n\nMéliès made at least one ex post facto drawing of Le MenuetLilliputien that survives. It is colored and includes a caption that includes the title of the film, along with the superlative phrase “ultra fantastic magic” at the top of the page.77 The drawing does not include the assistant depicted in the surviving fragment of the film. Like Méliès’ ex post facto drawing of L’hommeà la têteàcaoutchouc discussed above, this drawing depicts one of the film’s magical moments that was impossible to accomplish cinematically, an effect that could not be made visible, but could only exist in the imagination of the filmmaker and/or the viewer. Three of the four miniature monarchs are detached from their respective cards but look like thin cut-outs (which resemble smaller drawn versions of the flattened policeman in Le Raid Paris-Monte Carlo en deuxheures). The queen of spades in Méliès’ ex post facto drawing of Le MenuetLilliputien is curtsying with her arm outstretched to the king of clubs, and the king of diamonds stands upright. All three of the respective cards, off of which they have presumably stepped, are tumbled behind them—shadows on the faces of the blank cards indicate the figures’ physical separation from the cards. But, the fourth miniature monarch, the queen of spades, appears to be coming detached from the card held above the table by the magician, who resembles a goateed and mustachioed young Méliès. The queen of spades is peeling away from the face of the card: one of her hands reaches out from beyond the edge of the card and touches the hand of the king of diamonds, one of her legs steps down beyond the edge of the card toward the surface of the table, and the bottom of her royal robes are unfurling over the spade on the bottom corner of the card although much of the rest of her body appears to be adhering to the card—if not imprinted on it.\n\nCinema was an illusion of scale as well as an illusion of movement and an illusion of depth. Looking at an unmagnified strip of 35mm film, individual frames are quite small: the images are visible, but the level of detail that is so crucial for the caricatural aesthetic is difficult to discern with the naked eye.78 Thus, hand-colorists used optical magnification to apply aniline dyes to different parts of individual film frames. But, when projected onto a screen with a powerful light source, these same images became exponentially larger, a miracle of magnification that later inspired Jean Epstein to rhapsodize about the truly magical potential of cinematic close-up shots.79 Christian Metz alludes to the remarkable difference in scale between the film strip and the projected image when he describes the film canister like the magician’s hat that can produce contents far larger than its apparently limited volume: “a little rolled up perforated strip which ‘contains’ vast landscapes, fixed battles, the melting of the ice on the River Neva, and whole life-times, and yet can be enclosed in the familiar round metal tin, of modest dimensions, clear proof that it does not ‘really’ contain all that.”80\n\nTrademarked Backdrops\n\nFlat painted backdrops were widely used in still photography for studio portraits, for theatrical scenery, and for settings in early cinema. These backdrops mediated three-dimensional spaces with varying degrees of verisimilitude and varying approximations of trompe l’œil. Brian R. Jacobson writes, “filmmakers such as Méliès used painted backdrops to transport viewers into artificial but seemingly natural worlds beyond the screen.”81 The worlds beyond the flat screens on which films were projected were conjured by similarly flat (and similarly fabric) backdrops in Méliès’ studio. Méliès put a great deal of care into these backdrops, some of which he re-used for multiple films. Indeed, the American catalogues Gaston Méliès published in New York made a point of stating that the films listed within it were “the personal creations of Mr. Georges Méliès, who himself conceived the ideas, painted the backgrounds, devised the accessories and acted on the stage,” a schema in which the “painted backgrounds” were second only to the film’s conception, followed closely by “the accessories,” all of which were material objects.82\n\nMany of the backdrops Méliès used in films were based directly on drawings. A photograph of Méliès at work in his studio shows him painting a backdrop laid across the floor, holding a long-handled brush in one hand and a drawing in the other. A number of other backdrops appear rolled on racks behind him beside the glass wall of the studio.83 André Méliès recalled his father perched on a ladder, holding a long stick, outlining in charcoal how backdrops were to be painted in black and shades of gray, while the cloth was suspended vertically, as it would be in the films in which these backdrops appeared.84 The large size of these backdrops made them unwieldy and difficult to store, even after they had been rolled. Méliès added an annex to his Montreuil studio in 1900 for the creation and storage of painted backdrops.85 The following year, Pathé advertised the film Plaisirdes Sept châteaux dudiable as a costly production consisting of forty tableaus that included “15 décors by master set designer Albert Colas,” which were “three meters by four meters, painted in trompe l’œil.”86 The size of these backdrops necessitated additional space and, in 1903, Pathé created a space dedicated to the construction, painting, and storage of scenery that was separate from its main studio facility. This new location supported a greater quantity of film productions and a greater variety of settings within those films.\n\nThe materiality of backdrops is the focus of “La Commission des Théâtres” (La Griffe, December 12, 1889), which offers a behind-the-scenes view of a Paris theater. A cowed theater director looks on, hands over his head, while one fire inspector applies a torch to a theatrical backdrop to test its flammability and another fire inspector applies fire retardant from a pail labeled “Ignifuge.”87 By showing the obverse side of a theatrical scenery flat in this way, Méliès’ “La Commission des Théâtres” highlights the sheer materiality (and inherent flammability) of the represented world painted on the reverse side for the view of an audience. The inspector with a torch kneels beside a stamp that marks the approval of the “Commission des Théâtres,” which has been applied to the backdrop in several places.88\n\nWhile the Commission des Théâtres stamped its approval on décors that had been adequately fireproofed, Méliès embedded his trademark on the backdrops that he used for filmmaking. The first of these trademarks, a black star, was registered by his partner Lucien Reulos on November 20, 1896. Méliès continued to use different versions of the black five-pointed star trademark, many of which also included his name and the words “Trade Mark” and “Star.”89 Méliès’ “Star” Films trademark is visible—however incongruously—on the backdrops he used for many of his films. Trademarking had “the aim of discouraging illegal duplication and plagiarism,” Cherchi Usai notes, and often involved the backdrops themselves: “The logo is often visible in the image itself (sometimes as an object in the set direction). [. . .] The logo does not appear systematically in all titles, nor in all scenes.”90\n\nFootwear manufacturers sought to combat unauthorized knockoffs by trademarking their wares. Copying the design, construction, and external appearance of an article of footwear was permissible, but forging a trademark was illegal. Trademarks made the articles of footwear to which they were applied proprietary, not the patterns used to make these articles or the fashion plates on which they were modeled. Thus, the name “Méliès” was stamped on the sole of shoes, serving as the guarantee the product was authentic and not an inexpensive “counterfeit.”91 The filigreed “G. Méliès” signature that was imprinted along with the trademark star on celluloid prints of Méliès’ films is like the filigreed “Méliès” signature stamped on the leather soles of Méliès shoes and boots (along with the name “MELIES” in block letters on the heels and instep). Physically impressing a trademark and/or embossing a signature on products was a practice that the manufacturers of commodities used to prevent their merchandise from being counterfeited. The Société Méliès imprinted its trademark on footwear it manufactured because counterfeiting was rampant in the fashion industry, and French shoe manufacturers like Méliès were trying to protect the international market for authentic French-made de luxe products from inexpensive knockoffs.\n\nLike footwear, early films were initially not intellectual property eligible for copyright protection, but material commodities subject to the protection of trademarking.92 Méliès applied his trademark black star to the moving pictures, photographs, and painted backdrops he produced, just as he signed many of his drawings. Trademarks were also placed on Méliès’ printed sales and promotional materials, including publicity photographs, “probably the earliest film production stills ever distributed.”93 Méliès’ letterhead specified, “reproduction of our pictures is strictly forbidden.”94 As mentioned in the introduction, Gaston Méliès originally deposited paper prints of entire films with the Library of Congress to secure copyright protection for “Star” Films in the United States, but in 1904 he began depositing only a still photograph of a single backdrop from a film, a telling indicator of the importance of this specific component of Méliès’ products. Beginning around 1904, English-language “Star” Films promotional materials were also trademarked and copyrighted in the United States.95\n\nMéliès’ American catalogues emphasized: “No ‘Star’ Films are genuine unless marked with a ‘Black Star’ printed on the second picture, our embossed trade mark on the first one and our embossed signature at the beginning of the film.”96 In some cases, a star-shaped hole was punched in a single frame near the beginning of the film strip. The exact inspiration for Méliès’ choice of trademarks is unknown.97 Stars were not uncommon commercial symbols: during the 1880s, the Vincennes shoe manufacturer Henry Jumelle used a black star in advertisements, as did Brousté. French law acknowledged that the novelty of new trademarks was relative inasmuch as there were a potentially limited number of iconic symbols for manufacturers to choose from; thus, symbols that were part of existing trademarks could be registered as new trademarks provided they were applied to a new class of products.98 French law did not specify where trademarks were placed, and in fact trademarks did not need to be visible on the surface of the trademarked item or its packaging to be legally protected from infringement.99\n\nJust as the Société Méliès tried to deter counterfeits by trademarking the footwear it produced, “Méliès aggressively fought against this practice by inserting the logo of his company (Star-Film) on the main title of his films. [. . .] [H]e also resorted to applying his signature on the film leader, and to punching and embossing the logo on all positive prints.”100 Richard Abel writes,\n\nGeorges Méliès [. . .] came up with the brand name “Star” Films, for which he could substitute an easily identifiable logo. When Gaston Méliès set up facilities in New York to print and sell “Star” Films, in May 1903, his [New York] Clipper ads promoted the trademark star as much as the Méliès name in order to authorize the company’s products. That star appeared in black in all “Star” Films ads, and its “negative” (a white cutout) was punched into, and later embossed on, the opening frames of every film reel the company sold. Méliès adopted this trademark strategy for several reasons. One, of course, was to counteract Edison’s and Lubin’s extensive practice of duping and selling his films as their own, which reached a crisis point with the phenomenal success of A Trip to the Moon. The trademark proved ineffectual for Méliès as a means of asserting ownership (as did copyright), but it did assure the quality of his “original” film subjects in contrast to that of the dupes.101\n\nMotion pictures were subject to counterfeiting as unscrupulous entrepreneurs like Siegmund Lubin of Philadelphia attempted to circumvent legal trademark protection by scratching Méliès’ logo off each individual frame of a positive print and using that print to make a duplicate negative—as he did with the twenty-sixth tableau of Voyage dans la Lune. In 1930, Méliès explained, “As soon as the first positives were forwarded to U.S.A. [. . .] they were copied (countertyped) and sold in large number.”102 Other companies simply sold unauthorized duplicate prints. When nitrate prints of what appeared to be two Méliès films turned up at a French flea market in 1988, the presence of Méliès’ engraved signature and the trademark black star, still clearly visible on both film prints, vouchsafed their authenticity.103 It continues to be one of the most reliable ways of identifying genuine Méliès film prints.104\n\nLost Films, Surviving Drawings\n\nMéliès recalled making numerous drawings backstage at the Théâtre Robert-Houdin during evening performances when he was not needed onstage.105 Méliès also made many ex post facto drawings of his films while selling toys and candy in two different kiosks operated successively in the Gare Montparnasse by his second wife Stéphanie “Fanny” Méliès from 1925 to 1932.106 He wrote at the time that he was “never so happy as when” he was on vacation “draw[ing] to his heart’s content way up on top of [the] rocks in Brittany.”107 Conditions in the kiosks in the Gare Montparnasse were considerably less blissful, however. In 1930, Méliès complained, “I am in the worst conditions for drawing, with my hands frozen, and such a bad light,” later adding, “the cold [. . .] prevents me to be able [sic] to make drawings,” which “is a very very long work of patience.”108 After retiring in Orly, Madeleine Malthête-Méliès remembered her grandfather sitting by a window in the Orly retirement chateau, reconstituting selected tableaus from his films on paper with ink and colored pencils.109 According to Stéphanie Méliès, much was burglarized from their rooms in the chateau. “Everything was stolen at Orly,” she recounted in 1944, “I had posters, I had photographs.”110\n\nIn 1931, Méliès was still in possession of a number of “original drawings” he had made during the production of his films, including “a few of the original sketches made [. . .] in 1902 for ‘Trip to the Moon’ [. . .] with ordinary ink and shadowed only with blue pencil.”111 Some of these drawings have survived. As is typical in the fine arts, “frequently drawings relate to works by the same artist in other media [. . .] which [. . .] are usually more familiar.”112 So it is for drawings Méliès made of films like Voyage dans la Lune. But, in Méliès’ case, a number of the works in other media are not just unfamiliar, but nonexistent. Indeed, for certain lost films for which no production stills survive, including Le Petit Chaperon rouge [lost], among others, drawings constitute some of the only extant visual records.113"
