TABB: We need to get underway because if you have seen a copy of today's schedule you know we have a very ambitious one, and cannot afford to fall behind at the beginning.\n\nI am pleased to welcome all of you here for the second of two town meetings on film preservation in the United States sponsored by the National Film Preservation Board at the Library of Congress. The first of the two meetings was held in Los Angeles just two weeks ago today.\n\nI would like to begin by introducing our panelists.\n\nFirst, on my right, Fay Kanin, who is the Chair of the National Film Preservation Board, on which she represents the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nTo my left is David Francis, the Chief of the Library's Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division.\n\nNext to Fay is John Belton, a member of the National Film Preservation Board representing the Society for Cinema Studies. He is also a professor at Rutgers.\n\nTo his right is Milt Shefter, an alternate at-large member of the Film Board and president of Miljoy Enterprises, Inc., a preservation consulting firm.\n\nAnd, finally, to my far left, David Chasman, who is a veteran industry executive.\n\nDr. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, will also be joining us shortly.\n\nBefore we go further, I would like to call on Fay Kanin to read the remarks that Dr. Billington would have delivered had he been able to be here at this point and then we will go ahead and talk about the ground rules for the rest of the day. Fay?\n\nCHAIRWOMAN KANIN: Thank you, Winston. I will now read Dr. Billington's statement.\n\nI want to thank all of you for joining us today for the second of two public meetings on film preservation by the National Film Preservation board. Two weeks ago in Los Angeles we had our first meeting which successfully brought together major film studios, archivists, film techniciansand users for a very interesting discussion of the issues before us.\n\nThese meetings are intended to help us develop a report which wemust deliver to Congress in June and to achieve our historic mission, to preserve our film heritage.\n\nIn June 1992, Congress reauthorized the National Film PreservationBoard for four years. Congress asked us to continue performing some ofthe tasks we were already performing, such as selecting 25 culturally, historically or aesthetically significant films and to collect archival copiesof them for a national collection in the Library of Congress. But the 1992Act clarified that our principal mission is film preservation.\n\nCongress asked us to take two steps. First, we were asked to take a snapshot of all the current activities and issues in our national film preservation efforts and to report this information to Congress by the endof June 1993. Second, using this report as a working document, we are towork with all of the relevant parties to develop a national plan to preserve our film heritage. We will prepare this plan by the end of 1993.\n\nSo today we continue on the task we began in Los Angeles two weeks ago as information gatherers. Last September, the newly reconstituted National Film Preservation Board decided that we should hold public meetings to discuss our nation's preservation activities. These public meetings are a great opportunity to air a wide assortment of issues,to hear from all parts of the film community and to begin to shape public policy.\n\nBefore we start, there are two points worth underlining that I mentioned at our Los Angeles meeting. We are defining preservation broadly to include the full range of activities required to save and also tomake available America's film heritage. The other point is that Congressasked us to limit our report to film preservation, so we will put aside any questions about television and other video media. Our report may pavethe way for a second report on the important issues involved with the preservation of television and video materials but we were not given this mandate from Congress and are not charged to address them today or inour June report.\n\nOn February 12 in Los Angeles, we had 20 witnesses from public archives, film studios, labs and citizens groups discuss a variety of concerns about the physical preservation of materials, accessing information about what is currently stored and preserved, and about public access to the materials themselves.\n\nToday we will add to our information base with testimony from 25 additional witnesses from the film community, and we are doing it in a public forum to encourage discussion of the issues we are now facing.\n\nLet me repeat what I said in Los Angeles. We encourage response comments from those testifying today and from those of you in the audience on any of the subjects before us today or that we discussed inLos Angeles. All written comments must be received by the Library of Congress by March 15.\n\nAgain I want to publicly thank Annette Melville and Scott Simmon,our consultants tasked with writing the report, for all of their efforts todate.\n\nAnd that is Dr. Billington's report. I might just say for myself that the number and the diversity of the interests that are participating in this meeting is quite remarkable. I think it is historic that the Library and the National Film Preservation Board are able to provide such an opportunity for us all to get together to talk about this. I know all of us are very eager to hear and learn from all of you. Thank you.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you very much, Fay.\n\nNow, as moderator, I would like to review our procedures for today's meeting. We have organized the speakers into panels of varying sizes. In fact, some of the panels will be one person only. But I will ask each panel to come to the speakers' table together and then the speakers will go in the order listed in the program that we distributed in the lobby.\n\nIf anyone failed to get any of the handouts, you may go out and get any that you wish to have. There are several that I think will be very useful to you to have throughout the hearing.\n\nAll the speakers have been instructed to keep their prepared remarks brief, that is, no more than ten minutes. And I will call time, if necessary. In fact, I think I will have to wield a fairly mean gavel today to be sure we get through all of the comments as well as have time for the questions.\n\nAfter the speakers have given their prepared statements, I will invite my colleagues on this panel to ask follow-up questions during the balance of the time allocated to that group.\n\nAll written comments and the transcript of the proceedings today will be printed and available to the public as an appendix to the report we submit to Congress in June. We invite the speakers, observers and anyone else who has a strong interest in this matter to submit written comments to the Library, that is, to Steve Leggett of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division, by March 15.\n\nIf you have not yet got a copy of the notice in the Federal Register, it tells you what the address is and what the deadline is. March 15 is the time by which we must receive all comments.\n\nNow if we could begin, I would like to invite to the table Matt Gerson, who will be speaking for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. We know Matt also as the alternative representative of the Motion Picture Association of America on the Film Board, so we are glad to see you, Matt. Statement of Matthew Gerson, Vice President, Motion Picture Association of America, representing the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers MR. GERSON: Thank you very much, Winston.\n\nChairman Kanin, panel members, my name is Matt Gerson. I am Vice President of the Motion Picture Association of America [MPAA]. A number of people wondered whether this forum would be cancelled today because of the snow but I knew that at the Library, just like in Hollywood, the show must go on.\n\nIt is an honor to appear today on behalf of my friend and colleague, Nick Counter, the president of AMPTP, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Nick and I represent the producers and distributors of films, TV shows and home videos. MPAA represents the seven major studios. AMPTP represents those studios and 100 other producers in labor negotiations with the various guilds.\n\nI am here today because we support this panel and efforts to develop a plan for preserving America's film heritage. We appreciate the importance of your mandate because your work is targeted at our history, our family tree, if you will, and will ensure that we leave a legacy for future generations.\n\nAs this panel knows, the studios have had ongoing preservation programs for a very long time. They had programs before anyone anticipated that our films would flourish in the home video and cable markets. In recent years, the studios have increased their preservation initiatives. At the hearing held earlier this month, as Ms. Kanin noted, you heard about several of the programs ongoing at the major studios.\n\nThere are four points from Nick Counter's written testimony that I would like to emphasize today.\n\nFirst, we want to work with this panel and the Library in formulating a national plan. We have learned many practical lessons about preservation and want to share that knowledge and serve as a resource.\n\nSecond, we recommend that the board establish a glossary of terms so that everyone is singing from the same song sheet. Jargon can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. Some speak in terms of preservation, others speak in terms of restoration, and it is hard to be sure that everyone is always talking about the same thing.\n\nWe believe that a glossary would facilitate communications among experts and laymen and enhance the identification of films in need of protection and clarify the focus of preservation efforts.\n\nWe propose the establishment of a separate committee, a committee set up to prepare a glossary, and we would be eager to suggest experts from the studios who could share their knowledge and the knowledge that they have acquired over the years that we have been preserving our films. This committee might also be asked to study the technology of preservation so that we all better understand the different technologies used by the different players.\n\nThird, Nick wants me to suggest that we encourage this panel to focus their energies and resources on those films that are not being tended to, those films that are being neglected, those that will be lost if steps are not taken and not taken now.\n\nFourth, we want to reaffirm MPAA's commitment to the National Film Preservation Board. Our members will do their part to ensure that the Library has prints of films selected for the National Film Registry. In the past, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Billington, has thanked Jack Valenti and the MPAA for our efforts to make sure that film prints are available to the registry.\n\nWe are honored to own a number of the films that have been selected for the Registry and we do recognize a duty to the Registry and, as I said, to this panel and the panel's efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, let me note that it is quite refreshing to see the level of cooperation that characterizes the preservation community. Studios, private collections, archives and public institutions regularly help one another by exchanging material, sometimes through funding. The spirit and common purpose that I have seen inspires confidence that the panel will be able to meet the goals that have been set for them.\n\nI would be glad to respond to any questions that you might have. Thank you very much for this opportunity.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you, Matt. Questions? David?\n\nMR. FRANCIS: Obviously the glossary is very important. We all speak the same language but it seems not only do we have to have a glossary, we have to have standards to match the words we use.\n\nDo you think those standards already exist among your members? I mean, are they all using the same standards?\n\nMR. GERSON: In preparing for my testimony today, I read the testimony the studios gave to you a couple of weeks ago in Los Angeles and it appears to me just from that brief reading that they do not necessarily have the same standards. It is not always done the same way.\n\nMy recommendation about a glossary, our recommendation of a glossary, comes from my background which is more public policy than preservation. I know that when this panel makes their recommendations to the Congress they are going to be dealing with legislators who are not experts in preservation, laymen in this area, who go from the Agriculture Committee to the Intelligence Committee to the Copyright Committee and then have to think about preservation.\n\nI think it would help them to do their work and you to achieve the goals that you have set for yourselves if they can better understand these issues. I think it would be a great asset to those that are going to help you meet the goals of this panel.\n\nMR. TABB: John?\n\nMR. BELTON: Yes. I was wondering whether the producers and distributors have a mechanism for sharing information about their own ongoing preservation activities, where such discrepancies might come to the surface, or whether such a mechanism needs somehow to be part of a national preservation policy, whether there is some sort of a forum for people within the industry to talk about problems they face?\n\nMR. GERSON: I know that each of the individual studios have in-house databases. Phil Murphy of Paramount is testifying later on and he described in his testimony last week the database that was put together by Paramount so they can share information in-house, all over the world, through a personal computer. Many of the studios have similar facilities.\n\nThe big question is what about sharing between and among the studios, the archives and private institutions, and the Library of Congress. I believe that is one of the questions that really needs to be addressed by this panel, whether or not we can put together a database that will achieve your goal while at the same time maintaining the rights of copyright owners.\n\nAgain, in my experience observing preservation over the last five years, there is an extraordinary amount of cooperation that goes on. It is refreshing to see how the archives will help out a studio and vice versa. And I think that there can be more done to facilitate that information sharing.\n\nMR. BELTON: There seem to be new models for cooperation between private and public archives which we discovered in California, the Sony-Columbia arrangement, the Museum of Modern Art is also working with studios, Eastman House.\n\nIs there any encouragement within the industry for establishing newer models rather than the deposit models that have been used in the past, to actually work actively with public archives?\n\nMR. GERSON: Sure. There is absolutely a commitment to doing that. At the same time I think there has to be a sensitivity to the rights of the corporations, the rights of the copyright holders, the rights of the shareholders. But as a general matter, I think it is equally important that we share information because in our efforts to preserve a film that may be missing five minutes or one reel, the portion we need might be sitting in a warehouse in a private archive or a private institution and we can benefit from knowledge, from knowing that it is out there someplace. So we are committed to developing a database that works for all interested in preservation.\n\nCHAIRWOMAN KANIN: It would be very key to have the studios enter their information into a national database because without that commitment, we would not have a full picture.\n\nMR. GERSON: Well, again, we are committed to developing the right kind of standards but I will emphasize we also have to have sensitivity to the rights of our shareholders, the rights of copyright owners, the proprietary rights that we enjoy under the copyright act and elsewhere.\n\nMR. CHASMAN: Excuse me. You raise a point. There are many films which are--not to be blunt about it--illegally held by private collectors, some of them very rare, some of them very old. What would the studios' reaction be to some sort of amnesty or forgiveness for the registration of such material improperly held though they may be?\n\nMR. GERSON: Sir, I honestly do not know the answer to that but I certainly can explore that and get back to this panel. We were just talking yesterday with some of the experts that are assisting this panel and that there are films out there, in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, that used to be and still are owned by the studios. However, if the copyright owner does not have a copy, what good is it to them? So I think in order to get a copy, they may forego prosecutions.\n\nMR. CHASMAN: That is a whole new can of peas because with the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc, all of the films that are being found are usually illegally acquired outside the copyright agreements.\n\nMR. GERSON: But it seems to me that there would be great incentive just to have back this property that we have lost. As I said, I would like to explore that question a little bit further with the people that I represent.\n\nMR. CHASMAN: I understand.\n\nMR. GERSON: And we will be glad to get back to you on the subject.\n\nMR. CHASMAN: Thank you.\n\nMR. TABB: Are there any other questions?\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you very much, Matt.\n\nMR. GERSON: Thank you very much.\n\nMR. TABB: We will move on to the next panel of independent filmmakers.\n\nI invite to the table Mr. Stevens, who was formerly a representative of the AFI on the Film Board, and also Frederick Wiseman, who is the maker among other films of High School, which the Librarian has chosen for the National Film Registry.\n\nWe will start first with you, Mr. Stevens. We have up to ten minutes for prepared remarks and then we will have questions from the panel. Thank you. Statement of George Stevens, Jr., independent producer and filmmaker\n\nMR. STEVENS: Thank you, Winston, and members of the committee for a chance to offer a few comments from my perspective. I am here today in the good company of Fred Wiseman as an independent filmmaker. Of course, I also have had an interest in this particular topic for, I guess, close to 25 years.\n\nDriving up here through the snow it seemed to me kind of a metaphor for our quarter- century involvement in trying to preserve films, rescue films and save films and, in thinking about just a few things to say today, I developed two themes. One is, \"We have come a long way, baby,\" and the other is, \"Baby, we have a long way to go.\"\n\nI was just thinking back to my own involvement and really taking a look at the activity that is going on in these areas, the work of the Library, the Film Preservation Board, and it is quite remarkable, the level of involvement, the breadth of involvement, that has developed in recent years to focus on this very important problem--because it is an issue that was almost off the radar screen many years ago.\n\nI remember my first kind of shock of recognition, you might call it that, about the issue of film preservation that came at--I remember it precisely--the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. I had the privilege of being the American delegate at the Cannes Film Festival. I was then working at USIA for Edward R. Murrow at the Motion Picture Division and that was one of the perquisites that came with that job. And I think I could fairly call him a disheveled man, a large man with hair down to his shoulders--I see David Francis smiling because he knows I am describing Henri Langlois--and he accosted me, sat down and started this tirade about the failure of America to preserve its films. I was very ignorant of those circumstances and he was a missionary preserving films in Europe, but he also had this great love and affection for American films and it was provocative and stimulating.\n\nIn the immediately ensuing years when we were planning the American Film Institute, it certainly put preservation at the forefront of my mind and made it a cornerstone when the AFI was founded.\n\nAnd, of course, it was such a different landscape then. There was the pioneering George Eastman House, led by James Card; there was the Museum of Modern Art, led by Eileen Bowser and Willard Van Dyke; and the Library of Congress and very little else. And certainly the studios at that time had virtually no interest in film preservation. And to complete the picture, most of you know that at that time in the Library of Congress, film preservation came under a subsection of the Prints and Photographs Division. And when we were beginning the AFI and the Library people became involved, it is ironic in retrospect that the first decision of the AFI board in terms of film preservation was to make a grant of $50,000 annually from this new, small organization to the Library of Congress to stimulate film preservation. We decided not to create an archive, thinking that was not what we should do. Rather, we would help collect films for the Library and, happily, I think some 20,000 films are now in the AFI collection in the Library of Congress.\n\nThere have been lots of these trips by so many of us--not always snowy trips but sometimes they seem snowy trips--up Independence Avenue to try and make the Congress more aware of these problems. Gregory Peck was the founding chairman of the American Film Institute and we came together several times to testify. One time we were before John Brademas' committee--Greg had worked very hard on this and he then was very concerned about film preservation and he still is, and his testimony was excellent and he gave it with the resonance that he is capable of. As we walked out, he asked if we are successful in getting this preservation going, could we exclude a film called The Days of Glory? That was Greg's first film that he was not very proud of. It would be interesting to find out if that film has indeed been preserved.\n\nYou know, it is interesting, David Chasman was asking, one of the great early crises of the American Film Institute was when Sam Kula and Larry Karr were the two archivists. There was a film, which I think for this purpose should still remain nameless, that was found in England, and it was a very important film on the rescue list of 50 films that Card, Everson, Van Dyke and the AFI staff had developed. And Sam Kula came to me with great enthusiasm that they had found a print of this lost film in England. He said it belonged to a collector and that he was willing to turn over his mint condition print if we would make a dupe and give it back to him.\n\nWell, it turned out to be a break between the AFI and one of the major film companies because we had given our pledge that we would give the man a copy of the film, and it was the feeling of the studio that that was a complete violation of their rights. There was that capacity for tension between the studios and the rescuers and collectors.\n\nToday, we have a visionary leader of the Library of Congress. I think it is so encouraging that Jim Billington, who is a scholar in so many fields, has taken such a personal interest both in guiding these efforts and screening films, and sitting through long meetings of the Film Preservation Board. I would just like to thank you personally, Jim. I think you have made a great difference.\n\nI think when we see so many archivists and historians working in this field, and we begin to see an interest on the part of the film companies in taking an active role. You remarked that was stimulated by video. I think there is a more aware generation of leadership in the film studios. After our testimony in 1989 before the Senate committee, it was just at the time of the Sony purchase of Columbia, and a number of us raised the concern that Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is now owned in Tokyo. And I sent a copy of my testimony to Mickey Schulhof, the chairman of Sony, and within two days he called up and he said we are aware of that concern. He said we are going to form a committee to work on film preservation, and he asked if I would be part of it. And a number of us, Mary Lea Bandy, Bob Rosen, and others have been meeting with the Sony executives and they have been doing a superb job. I think it is a great example of the kind of collaboration that now can go on between the private sector and the public. And I think it is worth saying at this time that the involvement of the public sector--the National Endowment for the Arts which created the American Film Institute, and the Library of Congress--has been the stimulus that has kept this question in front of the public and in front of the film companies. I think it is important that stimulation continue.\n\nNow, just two or three personal items from another perspective on the \"Baby, we've- got-a-long-way-to-go\" department. In addition to making films, being the son of a filmmaker, I end up having a kind of custodial role in that there are occasions when I get involved with the films of my father. It was two years ago that I got a call from 20th Century Fox. When we were preserving films, we thought that rescue work was about the silent films, the nitrate films, the films from the distant past. It never occurred to me that I would be getting a call in 1990 about a film made in 1958, The Diary of Anne Frank. Somebody from the Fox studio called and said that they had gone to the negative--the only negative, the existing negative--of The Diary of Anne Frank, and found that two reels of the film had become \"vinegarized.\" This film was made with such care, such beautiful photography and such beautiful lighting about a subject of such importance by an individual who believed that films well-made would stand the test of time and be of interest to other generations. Fox was aware that I had a 35mm print of the film, and the sad conclusion of this was that the only way to recreate those two reels of The Diary of Anne Frank was to make a negative off the print. And, of course, that means that film will forever exist in a degraded state.\n\nSo, I think we have to be vigilant and questioning in the public's interest. I realize, as was pointed out earlier by the MPAA representative, that the studios have some proprietary feelings and some proprietary rights, but--sitting here with Fred Wiseman--I would like to raise the filmmaker's perspective, the perspective of the people who conceive and spend long days and nights making these films. I speak for friends who have gone--John Huston, William Wyler, John Ford, Hitchcock, my father--to say that a public responsibility exists, and, I believe, there should be some accountability in terms of the preservation of these works that are so much a part of our national culture. Thank you very much.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you. Mr. Wiseman? Statement of Frederick Wiseman, independent filmmaker\n\nMR. WISEMAN: Thank you. I appreciate the chance to talk with you today.\n\nI would like you to imagine yourselves historians of twentieth-century America working in the year 2093. You would have access to the usual historical records, books, newspapers, memorandum, computer disks, still photographs, Hollywood movies, but probably not documentary films because they would not be available. Yet much of the material historians of our time will be most interested in exists in and on documentary film.\n\nOne can put aside the politics or point of view of documentary films and just look at what is shown as a form of natural history. Documentary films show how people talk, walk, dress, relate to each other, the nature of work, the social organization of society, family relations, the handling of deviant behavior, the operation of courts, the role of police, medical practices, the relationship between men and women, racial issues, the functioning of government agencies, scientific experimentation, the nature of entertainment and our music and the way it was performed. The list is obviously endless.\n\nI would like now to reverse the historical look and suggest that our knowledge and understanding of nineteenth-century America would be enriched and enlarged if film technology had been available to document American life in that century. We would be endlessly fascinated by a police station in Boston in 1840, a southern plantation, a hospital in Washington during the Civil War, the voyage of a clipper ship, a western frontier town, the Library of Congress in 1890, a congressional race in Missouri in 1866, a regiment fighting in the War of 1812, the South during Reconstruction, Charles Dickens' tour of America, a band concert in a small Ohio town in 1872 to name but a few topics from another endless list.\n\nWhat interests twentieth-century historians of nineteenth-century American life are not just the best-selling popular novels of the period, but documents that give the texture and feel of everyday life. I would like to suggest to you that the principal film archival effort that I am familiar with is the equivalent of collecting the popular novels of the 19th century. The emphasis today is on the preservation of Hollywood movies to the almost total exclusion of documentary film material. There is to my knowledge no systematic, selective effort to preserve and collect the work of the documentary filmmakers of our time.\n\nI am going to briefly describe my own material because it may be representative of the problems facing many documentary filmmakers.\n\nOver the last 26 years, I have made 26 films covering a wide variety of topics drawn from the common experience of everyday life: schools, military service, courts, hospitals, religious life, handicapped people, business and prisons. This represents about 4 million feet of negative and 4 million feet of quarter-inch tape. There is also 4 million feet of work print and 4 million feet of magnetic track. In addition, I have the original negative, interpositive and duplicate negatives for each of the films. This represents another half million feet of film and optical track.\n\nThe cost of storing this material is about $7000 a year. I cannot afford to continue to pay this. I am obviously going to keep all the preprint negative material but I am now forced to consider destroying the rest which consists of most of the material. Yet the kind of documentation that exists in the outtakes of films may be of most interest to historians and the general public in succeeding centuries in their efforts to reconstruct, know and understand the way we live now.\n\nI would urge you to support an archival effort that makes a systematic and enduring effort to preserve and collect documentary film material. I believe that in doing so you would make an important contribution to the future study and understanding of our times and establish a precedent that would be admired and followed.\n\nI would like you also to think about the possibility that the documentary film of our time may be the entertainment film of the next century. One measure of social change will be the extent to which the documentary films of the twentieth century become the equivalent of the Marx Brothers or situation comedies of the twenty-first century. Thank you.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you. Any questions? John?\n\nMR. BELTON: Yes. Mr. Stevens, you have had tremendous experience with the AFI during its first 13 years or so. I was wondering if you could share with us, or use this background of the experience of trying to coordinate a national film preservation effort, to pinpoint one or two of the major problems which you felt that the AFI faced, and what solutions might have accelerated preservation activities over the past two decades. Unfortunately, that sort of thing just did not happen. What is the nation facing in terms of chief problems?\n\nMR. STEVENS: Well, first the progress. I think the most important progress has been this interest and awareness. I think it was so difficult before because people's eyes glazed over. People had not yet realized how important it was to preserve feature films and documentary films. So I think that is very important progress.\n\nThe difficult part is money. I mean, just hear Fred Wiseman describe the cost of preserving the materials of one filmmaker. I think, at the time, we felt that this nitrate rescue effort would be done and then everything would be fine. The lesson was that that was merely the beginning, that there are more and more and more films being made, and the fact that they are made on safety film did not guarantee their survival. Loss and carelessness and inattention put them in jeopardy.\n\nIf I could, parenthetically, give one other personal item because we are involved in it right now. The American Film Institute is paying tribute to Elizabeth Taylor. Paramount Pictures lost the negative to A Place in the Sun. We are now dealing with material from whatever they have been able to piece together. The scene selected from A Place in the Sun for the tribute to Elizabeth Taylor is a scene that most people with memory of the film remember, the scene with her and Monty Clift when they are dancing, they go out on the porch and she says, \"Come to mama.\" There is a terrible pop in the sound track. We could not avoid that pop when we made George Stevens: A Filmmaker's Journey; we could not avoid that pop when we honor Elizabeth Taylor. It is very hard to get the attention of Paramount Pictures to the fact that this is a very important film classic, and that it needs to be preserved and safeguarded to the best extent possible now that the negative is lost, unless somehow there would be the good fortune of finding the negative.\n\nSo I both herald the progress and answer your question by saying that money and interest are the two big problems.\n\nMR. BELTON: Is there a suggestion you might make in terms of how to structure a national preservation policy, how public attention and the attention of the studios can be focused on this issue?\n\nMR. STEVENS: Frankly, I think there are people who are working on it today who are better informed on that and I would defer to you who are more active than I am right now.\n\nMR. TABB: Fay?\n\nCHAIRWOMAN KANIN: To Mr. Wiseman. You rightly describe for us the information that is available about our lives and our society on documentary films. What is the problem of public access to that [material]? And how do you see that as being used by the public? What structure do you see for that?\n\nMR. WISEMAN: I suppose if an archive or archives began to collect this material more systematically it would be open to the public, to anyone who wanted to have access to it, whatever access to it.\n\nCHAIRWOMAN KANIN: You would, for instance, give your material to an archive?\n\nMR. WISEMAN: I would give all the outtake material. I would not make the films available free because that means I would stop eating.\n\nCHAIRWOMAN KANIN: But you were saying you would make it available with certain fees, is that it?\n\nMR. WISEMAN: Well, I would make the outtakes available without any fees.\n\nCHAIRWOMAN KANIN: I was using you as an example, not holding you up--\n\nMR. WISEMAN: The full-length films I would not make available free.\n\nMR. SHEFTER: Just a quick question for Mr. Wiseman. Your films have moved all of us, so you are among fans here, but I was especially interested in the fact that you have your own distribution company, Zipporah Films? MR. WISEMAN: Right.\n\nMR. SHEFTER: And I think this could be a role model for independent filmmakers and documentarians to take control of their own destinies. Could you tell us a little bit about this and how you came to that decision?\n\nMR. WISEMAN: Well, after having been cheated blind by a couple of the studios I felt that there was a 100% margin of error in setting up my own company, which I did in 1970, so that at least whatever money came in I got to keep, and whatever mistakes I made were my own, and I had no one else to blame. Because I was not only not getting any money from distributors, but I was having to sue them to at least get the reports to see how they cheated me.\n\nMR. SHEFTER: Would you advise other filmmakers to set up their own companies?\n\nMR. WISEMAN: Well, it was much easier in the seventies than it is now, because in the seventies when schools and libraries were more interested in 16mm prints, you could eke out a living on it. Now with videocassettes, it is extremely difficult, so I would suggest that anybody proceed with great caution.\n\nMR. SHEFTER: Thank you.\n\nMR. CHASMAN: On a slow question, in addition to studios who are copyright holders there are a half dozen separate entities, universities and museums, that maintain film preservation programs. Would either of you have any thoughts or even recommendations on how a national coordination of this kind of preservation could be achieved?\n\nMR. STEVENS: I think the process is one of bringing people together and I think that the studios, the archives, all interested parties should be formed into a federation of some sort, an organization that exchanges information, meets regularly and works with rescue lists and an awareness of what films are in trouble, what films are missing. Certainly the Film Preservation Board and that list of films is a good beginning.\n\nMR. CHASMAN: Let me say as a postscript that Greg Peck's worst fears are realized. Days of Glory shows on American Movie Classics all the time.\n\nMR. TABB: David Francis?\n\nMR. FRANCIS: Mr. Wiseman, I think that the question of outtakes is one of the most difficult ones for film archives. One of their great worries is that the material is often not well documented at the time of production, because of the stresses that take place then.\n\nDo you think if one could devise a standard format for describing outtakes, that documentary filmmakers, knowing that national collections would then consider them, would be prepared to follow that format--if it were as simple a format as possible but one that had basic information?\n\nMR. WISEMAN: Well, I assume that documentary filmmakers that have a minimum of intelligence would be interested in following that format, because it would be in their interests. And I think that just in order to make a documentary film, to edit a film, you have to have a very good log of all the material. I cannot speak for others, but I know for myself that I have a log which lists every shot on each roll of film, and I would think that most people have that.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: If I may follow up just briefly, do you think the log that you keep would also be as intelligible to someone who was not around at the time of shooting? If it suddenly came into a collection like ours and was given to our cataloging staff, would the information be enough to make that material valuable in the way that you described in your testimony?\n\nMR. WISEMAN: I think so, but I cannot speak for anybody else. I keep very detailed logs summarizing the action and the conversation.\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: Well, first of all, I would like to say as a historian that I think you are absolutely right about documentary film. We are already discovering that the film we have restored and put in our American Memory packets, which we tested in 44 sites around the country, often has unexpected educational value. I mean, when you have shown a very little bit of footage of what a street in New York was like at the turn of the century, you get people asking questions that stimulate the leading experts in the field because the leading experts in the field have not looked at this material.\n\nMuch of it is immediately intelligible and prompts questions about clothing, why are these people walking this way; they knew that there was horse and carriage but why were the people sitting the way they were in the carriage, and so forth and so on. There is just an almost infinite amount of material in these documentaries, and our experience is that a lot of this stuff can really fundamentally affect the educational process and rekindle for an audiovisually oriented audience an interest in history and traditional history as we are doing in libraries. So this kind of experience forces people back into books rather than pulling them away the way so much television does these days.\n\nNow, that leads to two questions. One, in our hearings in Los Angeles, one of the more, I think, surprising testimonies to most of us was the testimony of a young woman who was the custodian of an ethnically oriented, but nevertheless basically home movie collection. And I wondered if the same thing that is true of documentaries is not also true of home movies, and if there is any rational way of collecting and sorting and preserving those materials? That is my first question.\n\nAnd my second question is if you, not only as a distinguished producer of documentary films and distributor of them, but also as a lawyer, if you saw any way in which laws or regulations, federal or otherwise, could be changed to encourage more preservation in the documentary group?\n\nMR. WISEMAN: Well, the last part is easier to answer because I would say I was physically present in law school. [Laughter.] I have never practiced and do not even keep up with the laws that relate to this.\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: Is there a documentary of your physical presence? [Laughter.]\n\nMR. WISEMAN: Fortunately not. And as far as home movies are concerned, I have not really thought about that. I suppose I have a parochial interest in first attacking the problem or trying to do something about the problem of documentary movies. I agree with you. If there was a way of collecting some home movies, the problem is that there is such a volume of them that you would have to obviously, and similarly with documentary film, be enormously selective.\n\nMR. TABB: I think we need to end now. We are over our time but we appreciate very much your responses to the questions. If I could call Mr. Prelinger now to the table? Statement of Richard Prelinger, President, Prelinger Associates, Inc.\n\nMR. PRELINGER: I am speaking today as president of Prelinger Associates, Inc., one of the largest private collections of what I call \"ephemeral films\", that is to say, films produced for a specific purpose at a specific time. Our collection contains educational, industrial, advertising and amateur films as well as a great deal of unedited material, approximately 9000 hours in all. Unlike most other collections or archives that will be represented here, we derive our income primarily from licensing archival footage.\n\nAlthough ephemeral films have not received much attention from scholars and historians, in fact these genres have numerically dominated American cinema for most of its history. Since the advent of the talkies in 1927, I estimate that over 600,000 of these, plus an uncountable number of amateur films, have been produced in this country. Many were made to show in theaters and, as such, should be part of any consideration of film history. But the majority reached their audiences on school days, at community meetings or in the workplace.\n\nWebster's defines ephemeral as anything lasting but a brief time, and this has been the situation with regard to these mostly obscure films. No one knows how many survive but perhaps as many as 50% no longer exist.\n\nNo logical principle governs what has survived and what has disappeared. No archive is equipped logistically or financially to house the huge number of remaining films and an infinitesimal percentage has been preserved. In fact, they are one of American film's best kept secrets.\n\nSo why bother to preserve films like The Wonderful World of Wash and Wear, Rochester: A City of Quality or Dating Dos and Don'ts? I would suggest that these are our national home movies, the best and most vivid records of our public and private lives, how Americans have lived, worked, thought and consumed.\n\nRecently I was invited to visit Britton, a town in eastern South Dakota. It seems that during the Depression a man named Ivan Besse, an enterprising projectionist, tried to boost attendance at the Strand Theater. So he took his camera out to Main Street to shoot films of people visiting town on Saturday. Later, he also shot cornhusking bees, WPA workers building a dam and sheriffs taking prisoners to jail. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, when business was slow, he showed these 16mm pictures at the Strand.\n\nWhen TV came to South Dakota, Ivan's efforts to corral audiences were no longer successful. He lost the theater in the sixties and the films were sold for 50 cents to a woman in Texas. Later, they came to me and when the mayor Britton found this out, I was invited to bring them back to the Strand. 53 years later, Ivan hosted a screening of his films in the same old theater, narrating them in front of an audience who pointed out their younger selves promenading on the screen. I have never seen people talk back, call out and interact with a movie like that audience did, for they saw images of their town surviving what in South Dakota what they called \"the dirty thirties\" as best it could, and that meant a great deal to them. They saw the rich public life of Main Street crowed with shoppers, gawkers and flirting teens, community rituals like proms, distributions of Christmas presents and Memorial Day parades and the faces of people, their manners and body language of fifty years ago. One person even saw her older sister for the first time for her sister had died before she was born.\n\nSomewhere in the forgotten industrial, advertising or educational film there is something for every one of us, scenes of our hometown, pictures of how our fathers and mothers worked for a living, a treatise on social etiquette or maybe the look of a twenties farm or fifties supermarket and you will not see many of these everyday images in newsreels and feature films.\n\nSince 1984, we have supplied footage to over 2000 film and video producers, researchers and scholars seeking imagery and historical documentation unavailable from any other source. Images from our collection are routinely seen on PBS's American Experience and NOVA, on network news programs, in documentaries and independent productions and, of course, in numerous commercials and corporate shows.\n\nI think this testifies to the importance of and demand for this material. We are now fielding requests from publishers of electronic books, interactive and other kinds of emerging media. Their products, if enhanced by carefully curated moving images, promise to nurture historical consciousness in future generations and we have brought one project that we have done to show how this material can acquire life in the optic media. It is outside.\n\nBut no foreseeable increase in business activity will permit more than token efforts on our part to preserve our over 23,000 completed films and 40,000 cans of unedited footage. And this I am afraid is the situation all repositories of ephemeral films face, whether public or private.\n\nI urge the board to look beyond recognized masterworks and to consider the importance of ephemeral films and the state of their preservation which, unhappily, is not significant at this time. I hope you will make generous provision for them in your report and recommend that these historical materials receive their proper share of attention and funding under a future national moving image preservation plan, whether they are held by public or private custodians. Their preservation and ready accessibility will send a powerful message to future generations, that the history of daily life is not just a matter of nostalgia or quaintness but a means of understanding the heritage of our own communities, lives and labors. Thank you.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you, Mr. Prelinger. Are there questions? John?\n\nMR. BELTON: Just to follow up on your last point, you mentioned that your commercial exploitation of your holdings has not generated enough income to finance their preservation. If there were some sort of national, public preservation, exactly what relationship would it hold to your holdings? That is, if material within your collection were to be preserved, what would the status of this material be in terms of public access or your own access? How would you envision a deal?\n\nMR. PRELINGER: Well, this has been a tough nut to crack lately, but I feel very strongly about making material available to people that need it. I should say that we deal with hundreds of independent film and videomakers every year who do not have money, and that we still are able to work for them simply for the cost of duplication.\n\nI also believe strongly in a rich public domain, which is one of the reasons that we have been able to derive income from exploiting these films, and I think that we have to figure out what the public stake in material would be if it is preserved at public expense. I think if public funds are used that some kind of access without charge will ultimately be necessary, perhaps after a window.\n\nMR. SHEFTER: Mr. Prelinger, the panel has heard a call for creating some form of national database of materials. I know that your Footage '89 represented a rather large database of material primarily on stock footage and other types of films. Perhaps you could help us in telling us how you put that together. Did you get cooperation from all sectors? And how valid was the information you received?\n\nMR. PRELINGER: Beginning in 1987, we surveyed every actual or suspected repository of moving image material that we could think of in North America. We ended up listing in that book and in the revision somewhere in the neighborhood of 1750 sources. There were many we could not list or for whom we could not elicit information.\n\nOne of the things that became very clear in the process of preparing a reference is that the state of information is pretty terrible. There is a national database in the works, NAMID, the National Moving Image Database. We are going to begin to upload records to them because I feel strongly that should represent non-theatrical material as well. But we found that we had to include a great deal of anecdotal information that archivists or public service people at the collections would tell us. And also the decentralization makes it very difficult to have a broad picture of what actually still exists in this country. You can go to the back closet of a university media center anywhere in the country and find unique material. Or you can find government-produced films that are not in the National Archives.\n\nMR. SHEFTER: So if we were to run a so-called national survey of materials either that had been preserved or should be preserved, we should question the results of that, based on your experience? The information received from the various repositories?\n\nMR. PRELINGER: I think that the outreach needs to go beyond the repositories with which we are very familiar. And I know that this has been part of the history of AFI, that it has looked all over the place. But if we expand this search to work that is not just features, we will have to look in much different places.\n\nMR. TABB: Fay?\n\nCHAIRWOMAN KANIN: In terms of your own library or others that you know of, what is the state of preservation of a lot of your material now? What media were they done in? What is holding up and what is not?\n\nMR. PRELINGER: In almost every obsolete and current film format you can imagine. We are not equipped to collect videotapes, so we do not.\n\nUntil recently, we were able to take refuge in the fact that, since we were primarily collecting safety, what little nitrate material we have, we could put it off until we had a little more money. Suddenly that is no longer true. Because of the vinegar syndrome, our holdings in nitrate have become much more significant.\n\nWe would like to preserve nitrate material and certainly safety films which are probably of the greatest historical value, but I think we have to wait. I think a lot of people in the stock footage business and the archival sector look to the turn of the century and the millennial consciousness as a means of generating a considerable interest and possibly income out of their holdings.\n\nSo the other thing we do which I think I would like to mention is we collect preprint material on ephemeral films. Archives like Iowa State, which also collect this material, are not able, in the absence of funding, to preserve this material. I think this is a very good idea to try to find preprint elements and safeguard them.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: I just wanted to follow up something that Milt said. I do not know whether you plan to revise your stock footage directory regularly, but I was wondering about the possibility of your sending out questionnaires, because I am very reluctant to start yet more surveys, if there are surveys that already exist or could be slightly modified to question all of these people about what in their collections they feel is most valuable to them and most in danger? We could then get some picture of all these collections and find out what people individually feel is most in danger. Then, we would have some idea of what are the most important elements in this field, and the most important things that could be done. Would that be possible, do you think?\n\nMR. PRELINGER: I think that is an excellent idea. I should say that nobody seemed to respond to questionnaires. We had to make about 10,000 telephone calls. But beyond that, the message of this is that we will find a lot of unexpected repositories, including stock footage collections, have unique material. We are familiar with the newsreel problem, that is an example of that.\n\nMR. TABB: All right. Thank you very much.\n\nMR. PRELINGER: Thank you.\n\nMR. TABB: I would like to call now our panel from the educational community, Professors Gomery, Gunning, and Kolker. While this panel is getting settled, I would remind people that Mr. Prelinger has brought a videodisc which is out in the foyer. When we have our break for lunch, please stop and see what he has brought. Thank you very much for bringing that. Can we begin now? Statement of Douglas Gomery, Professor of Journalism, University of Maryland, College Park\n\nMR. GOMERY: Good morning. My name is Douglas Gomery and I have prepared a statement which I have put into the record. I always wondered having watched C-SPAN for years how I should do this, and so I have looked at various models and I will use the Jack Valenti model. [Laughter.] The Jack Valenti model is you prepare a statement and then you try to talk about it and make the points. I will not do as well as Jack because I will not tell a lot of great, funny anecdotes that I had a staff look up because I do not have a staff. [Laughter.] I have three points. Point one, and I speak for myself as a teacher, as a person who entered this field, like John Belton, 20 years ago or so, and remember the battles, as an author of nine books and 300 articles and, I am proud to say, several thousand reviews.\n\nMy first statement is I think this is not a problem of current energies or of focus. I guess I humbly disagree with some people on this matter. I think that this meeting this morning is testimony. I live in Washington and I guarantee you that this is the most well- attended meeting of today. Everybody else's kids are out of school, every school system has closed down. I came in this morning thinking there would be about three people here. My spouse who studies health care and is working with President Clinton will have many less people at her meetings than I will.\n\nI do not think it is energy. I think these people work extraordinarily hard and, speaking as a media economist, for relatively low wages given what they could do otherwise. I look at people like Greg Lukow and I just wonder what makes people like that go. I can only think missionary zeal, a kind of religious metaphor. I do not think that is the problem. I think a little tinkering here, a little tinkering there is all we need.\n\nSo what is the problem? I think the problems, in my opinion, are two things. First is the nature of the issue at hand, and the second more important problem, that is, of course, resources.\n\nThe nature at hand is, and, I think here Fred Wiseman said it better than I will, to use my metaphor, we are fighting the last war. I think most people that I know and I think the general consensus would be that we ought to save motion pictures. But I think that is to lose sight of what we ought to really be focusing on saving, which is less trendy, less hip, less educationally viable to my colleagues in the universities--my apologies to these, of course, enlightened colleagues--and that is television.\n\nTelevision is where the Fred Wisemans of the next generation, to use Dr. Billington's expression, will get their footage, will recognize what a school board meeting in Washington, D.C., looked like in 1992, will recognize what people discussed and wore, etc.\n\nAnd irony of irony, it is not the national television news; it is the local television news. This is what captures the texture of a community, the texture of our society. We have a channel here called NewsChannel 8, 24-hour CNN local news, all day, all night. And they really document the nature of this community. They do not document the nature of the president's jogs; they do not document these kinds of hearings; they document ordinary, day-to-day activities that three-and-a-half, four million people that make up Washington live by.\n\nAnd we do not save that, and we are not--NewsChannel 8 is taping over its tapes just as most news organizations are doing; we are not saving anything.\n\nVanderbilt is on shaky grounds. Other news archives are what we used to call pirated and in-house and hidden in the closet, etc.\n\nSo I would argue that the problem of focus needs not to be narrowed or specified, but to be expanded.\n\nSo now we know what the next question is, which is the proper question which my colleague George Stevens, Jr. brought up and I have heard at these kinds of meetings for years and years and years, and that, of course, is the problem of resources.\n\nAs an economist, I am familiar with this. My spouse is really after resources. She studies Medicare; we are talking there billions and billions of dollars. When I told her my proposal for this, she kind of chuckled. The rounding error in her community is $100 million. So what is the argument?\n\nThe argument is, and I think Dr. Billington stated it, others have stated it. The argument is that this material is absolutely necessary for the education of today and in the future. It is not ephemeral; it is not tangential; it is at the core of what we do. It documents the world; it explains the world; it is our primary cultural artifacts of the world. So to not have libraries, to use that metaphor, of moving image collections is not to have libraries of books in the nineteenth century. It just to me makes no sense.\n\nSo that is the first step. The first step is it is an educational goal. It is an educational motivation. It is an educational drive, centerpiece. So that is the first.\n\nThe second step is it is a national education demand, not just state and local. State and local is how we organize education in the United States. We have great state universities; we have great local institutions. But some material, some activities need to be done on a national basis. I think this is one of them. I think we need a national library of moving image material like we have a national library of books that Dr. Billington looks over.\n\nSo the question is what to do. Well, I propose that the fairest means of raising money for a national archive, a national institution to meet educational goals is what I call a user tax. I think the fairest kind of tax--we have heard a lot of data about taxes in the United States--is a tax in which people recognize what the goal is. I think that people are willing to pay a certain amount for an energy tax because they realize the goal is to reduce pollution and have positive contributions to society. So I propose a user tax.\n\nA user tax encompasses the people who produce and the people who distribute and the people who use moving image materials. That is everybody. That is everybody.\n\nSo I propose a 1% sales tax and revenue tax on the production and distribution of all moving image materials. This will raise, I estimate by my calculations, $500 million per year, and I think it will then also be passed on, in part, not totally, in part--this is called tax incidence--to users like us, and you, [and] everyone else, which will mean 2 cents or 3 cents more for rental of a videotape, 5 cents more for going to the movies, etc. And that way, because it will be passed on, as taxes on corporations traditionally are, and I could cite that literature for you if you want me to, we will all pay. The studios and other organizations will not take the full burden, they will take part of the burden, but they should take part of the burden. They are taking part of the benefit. We are taking part of the benefit, we should take part of the burden.\n\nSo I propose that we need a dedicated specific tax aimed at education and that is what I think would help solve this problem. Thank you very much.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you. Mr. Gunning? Statement of Tom Gunning, Associate Professor and Acting Chairman, Film Program, State University of New York, College at Purchase, representing The Society for Cinema Studies\n\nMR. GUNNING: I am Tom Gunning from the State University of New York-Purchase. I guess my model will be to stick to the script. [Laughter.] I am speaking here both as an individual scholar involved in researching and writing the history of American cinema and also as a representative of the Society for Cinema Studies (SCS), the professional society for film study in the United States whose more than a thousand members teach and write about the cinema. Although our membership is based in the academy, both professors and graduate students, it also includes other serious film researchers and other film study professionals such as film archivists.\n\nI would say that as film professionals, most of whom are involved both in research and in the teaching of film study, we members of SCS are concerned about film preservation at both ends of the chain. For us individual researchers the preservation of our film heritage constitutes the very material of our work. The vast strides that film study has made over the last two or three decades comes directly from the fact that our generation had the opportunity of looking closely at actual prints of films which film historians and theorists of an earlier period often had access to only through memory or from printed sources. Clearly we feel the need for preservation most intently because films are the substance of our work, our curiosity, and I should add our passion.\n\nAt the other end of the chain comes conveying the results of our research. Those of us involved in teaching are also dedicated to passing on our discoveries and our delights down to another generation. Most of us in this room, I think, came from a generation for whom film viewing was a natural passion shared by most members of the society and it hardly seemed a necessity to teach a love and interest in cinema to anyone. But the generation we are now teaching are not as naturally attuned to the film image as we were and, although we live in a constant environment of visual images, they often seem to be more the victims of those visual assaults than their masters.\n\nAs professionals involved in film study, I feel we are teaching a form of visual literacy and, although much of this literacy involves contemporary issues, I also feel that a knowledge of the history of film, where it came from and how it developed, is essential for visual education. As teachers, we are a sort of medium of preservation as well as the critique of film culture. And for this task we need film preservation not only to provide materials for research but also to allow our students to directly experience the texts of our film heritage.\n\nI am therefore adding my voice to those of archivists in pleading for the immense importance of preserving our film heritage which for technical reasons is the most fragile of our arts and for commercial reasons one of the most difficult to preserve. But I would also like to add to that central plea that the planning for preservation should also consider the availability and circulation of films. We need, in other words, not only to preserve films in archives but to increase availability of these films not only to those scholars lucky enough to live in proximity to archives or wealthy enough to take long trips, but also to classrooms across the nation and to students who need to see something of the vast range of our film heritage beyond what is available at the local video store or those films considered commercially profitable in the ever-shrinking market of 16mm film rentals.\n\nI believe that addressing the availability of films to students and to film scholars for teaching purposes completes the purposes of film preservation by allowing such films to become a living part of our heritage. Therefore, I would urge that a consideration of film preservation not take place in a vacuum but consider a strategy for intersecting with film education.\n\nAs a historian, I tend to look to specific events for guidance in understanding the way history functions and I think that a very strong example for the way issues in film preservation should be approached lies in the Paper Print Collection of the Library of Congress. It was this extraordinary collection of film that helped revolutionize the study of early cinema in this country and my own book on the early films of D.W. Griffith depended on it enormously.\n\nAs you are undoubtedly aware, this collection was basically an accident, originally established to plug a loophole in the copyright laws before they covered motion pictures, and never intended as a means of film preservation. However, in the 1940s, Harold Lamarr Walls, a clerk in the Library of Congress, discovered this cache of paper film and recognized its unique value. The rescuing of this collection and its transfer to 16mm film not only addressed therefore preserving it but also provided a means of making it available to scholars and other interested viewers.\n\nSince anyone can purchase a print of a film from this collection--although unfortunately the cost has increased a great deal in recent years--it has provided not only a tool of research but the core of several university teaching collections on the history of early film as well as personal collections of scholars, aficionados and filmmakers. The decision to consider how to make these films available is one of the aspects that makes this collection not only valuable but powerful in revising our notions of early film history.\n\nA second aspect of this collection raises another point regarding preservation that I would like to stress. The preservation of the Paper Print Collection was not selective. It included films by great directors like Griffith, Mack Sennett or Edwin S. Porter, as well as silly comedies by anonymous directors and advertising films. All of the very sorts of films preserved in the Paper Print Collection have yielded discoveries about the development of American cinema and its relation to American culture. I am still making discoveries in it.\n\nAs Patrick Loughney of the Library of Congress has pointed out in his research on the Paper Print Collection, the very variety of the collection appealed to the Librarian of Congress during its discovery, Archibald MacLeish.\n\nMacLeish favored creating a film archive which would deal not only with the preservation of film as an aesthetic form but also as a part of America's history, society and popular culture. I would stress the importance of such collections. This is partly because aesthetic values are always changing and we often discover our strongest art works in categories previously treated with contempt. But beyond this, film is perhaps the most resolutely social of all art forms, involving complex intersections of industry, technology, capital and a range of makers and audiences. Therefore, its value not only for film historians but for historians of culture becomes particularly intense.\n\nI would stress, then, that film preservation should be focused not only the preservation of feature films which often receive the greatest comment and attention because they have professional publicists whose jobs are precisely to make such films highly visible. Film preservation needs to be especially scrupulous in ferreting out and preserving films which were often made with minority audiences in view, ranging from the films of the avant-garde to those of specific ethnic groups or geographical areas.\n\nPreserving the work of avant-garde filmmakers, African American, Yiddish or regional filmmakers in Maine, Florida or Salt Lake City is harder because there was less invested in the film's distribution or publicity. But for film history they are precious indeed and for reasons which we can not always predict in advance.\n\nI strongly applaud the movement the Library of Congress has begun to make in this direction in the last few years, showing that our heritage of distinguished films need not be limited to the most familiar and widely recognized titles but needs to consider those works especially in need of highlighting and preservation because of their neglect or marginalization within a commercial industry.\n\nFilm archives have been doing a heroic job in this area and need further support and recognition. Again, these films which were always so little distributed need to be made available for teaching and study as well as preservation.\n\nAt the beginning of this month I traveled to the University of Chicago for a screening of the magnificent restoration of D.W. Griffith's masterpiece Intolerance undertaken by the Museum of Modern Art and the Library of Congress. This restored print has been shown five times around the world accompanied by an orchestra score restored and conducted by Gillian Anderson. And I have had the good fortune to attend four of those screenings, three in this country and one in Italy.\n\nHowever, at present, I can only tell my students about this extraordinarily restored version while I project a 16mm print which I now consider inadequate to Griffith's original conception of the film. The restoration of Intolerance is a magnificent work and I applaud it heartily. But in some senses its preservation will only be complete when it is available to a larger range of viewers.\n\nI cannot stress enough the importance of film preservation in the teaching of American culture and preservation in the broadest sense also means carefully considering strategies for availability. Thank you.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you. Professor Kolker? Statement of Robert Kolker, Professor of English and Comparative Literature, University of Maryland, College Park MR. KOLKER: Robert Kolker, University of Maryland. And one of the benefits of being last is that I get a chance to summarize and set forward some of the points of my colleagues.\n\nLike them, I want to speak on behalf of the growing number of educators using film as part of the classroom process either as an aid or complement to the central subject matter or as the central concern of their curriculum. The latter is of particular interest to me because my career is devoted to the study and teaching of film.\n\nThe number of cinema studies courses grows yearly. Colleges and universities are either adding film studies departments and programs or situating course offerings in existing departments. Introductory courses are showing up in community colleges and even high schools are beginning to express interest. The need to teach young people how to read, analyze and understand the moving image, the form in which most people get the stories the culture wants to tell them, and the desire of young people to make such images on their own is placing more and more institutions on alert.\n\nAs programs grow or are created, access to material becomes an increasingly serious concern. How do students get to see films and how do the teacher-scholars who teach film get to study the form and learn its history so that they can teach it well, not only to their students but to the public at large for whom they write their books and articles?\n\nHow do those institutions like community colleges and high schools that do not have access to experienced film teachers or budgets for expensive film rentals provide the education their students want and need?\n\nAnd what of the choices for preservation? The emphasis seems to be on 35mm theatrical features, which are certainly of central interest to many film scholars. But thought has to be given to the independent film, the work of the avant-garde and the recent upsurge in films by and about women and minorities, gays and lesbians.\n\nThe board needs to direct some of its attention to some of these marginal works, because they are central to important cultural issues, and think about them not only in terms of preservation but of availability as well. Here are films with no corporate structure to help preserve or distribute them.\n\nThe National Film Preservation Board needs to confront a number of issues beyond those concerned simply with the preservation of existing theatrical films. It needs to be concerned with questions of scope and access. To say that a particular title has been saved from deterioration, that a color, nitrate positive has been transferred to three safety black-and- white negatives and put in cold storage is a triumph indeed but an incomplete one.\n\nWhat is the value of an expensive act of preservation if the results are inaccessible? If scholars and students cannot see the results, if the only access to the particular film is still through a scratched and spliced 16mm dupe or, more likely, a poorly resolved video recording, who profits from the preservation? Pedagogy and the history of film do not. The unseen remains the unknown.\n\nAt the very least I would suggest the Library of Congress should be enabled to make viewing copies of every film that becomes part of the preservation process. Further, as copyright problems are worked out and negotiated, there should be a mechanism developed for the larger public availability of these preserved titles. Right now, the LC offers, I believe, certain borrowing privileges to recognized archives. These privileges might be extended to accredited universities. Efforts should be made to arrange traveling exhibits, perhaps of the programs presented at the Pickford Theater, for example.\n\nFinally, an educational outreach program needs to be instituted either as part of the preservation board or perhaps more reasonably as a separate entity. No such program exists in the country at this time. The American Film Institute has put its concentrations elsewhere. There is no central location for finding prints, arranging screenings, publishing study guides, filmographies, bibliographies. The Motion Picture Division of the Library of Congress provides a basic and wonderful reference service that could serve as the base of an expanded operation that could publish introductory and advanced materials, training in film studies pedagogy and perhaps viewing material in some usable form.\n\nI expect that many of the country's leading film scholars would be interested in taking part in such an operation as part of the service component of their research. And certainly Doug Gomery's notion of revenues from a user tax could be used for such a service.\n\nVisual narratives are the fundamental transmission forms of our culture's immediate thoughts, beliefs and fantasies. They need to be understood and such understanding requires education and access. Preservation is the beginning of a process that can, with some of the additional elements outlined above, lead to the perpetuation of knowledge. Thank you.\n\nMR. TABB: Thank you very much. Milt, I think you had the first question.\n\nMR. SHEFTER: Professor Gomery, I know Jack Valenti and you, sir...(pause) did very well. [Laughter.]\n\nMR. GOMERY: Thank you. I take that as a very high compliment.\n\nMR. SHEFTER: I cannot speak for Mr. Valenti, but I think he would have been pleased with your presentation although not your proposal on taxation. [Laughter.]\n\nMR. GOMERY: I am sure of that.\n\nMR. SHEFTER: I would like to get into that a little bit and, by the way, on behalf of the panel I would like to thank you for coming forth with a very positive suggestion for revenue. We have been hearing virtually nothing but requests for an ever expanding realm of material to be preserved.\n\nIn your proposal, and you have suggested that we be more comprehensive and include television, I do not see any taxation on television or any of the other things that you wish preserved and I am kind of curious as to how this idea of yours would work.\n\nHow would it function and how would the money be distributed should it be collected?\n\nMR. GOMERY: Well, let me read it. I was just trying to summarize. In fact, just to be absolutely specific, I did not do as well as Jack might. I meant television absolutely as well. No question about it. It would be much less of a figure if television was not included.\n\nTo pay for this, I am reading, I am sorry, but let me be precise. To pay for this, I propose a user tax. That is, those of us who gain entertainment information from moving images, insight and fun both from film and television should be willing to contribute a tiny portion of what we spend on purchase and rental to maintain preservation. I suggest a 1% of all gross sales and rentals and television advertising expenditures of all films and television.\n\nI think such a tax would yield $500 million a year, every year, not just one year, and that it would be a regular, ongoing source of funding. I think one of the things that my colleagues point out--Tom did a terrific job--is the ups and downs, the inconsistencies. We have some things saved from some eras because we are lucky that funding was available or people were industrious, and in some areas we have nothing. It is really the vagaries of the budget process that leads to that, which I think is a shame. So I think we need something permanent.\n\nI think it would not be just television stations, television networks, movie studios, television producers, etc., all just contributing because I think that as economists would suggest they would slightly increase their prices, pass it down the system, and so that we would all contribute just as the arguments that are going on at the moment for raising the corporate rate. The rise in the corporate tax that President Clinton has proposed, virtually all economists that I have seen and heard of would suggest that that in part will be passed on to all of us and it will be, just as this would be.\n\nMR. SHEFTER: And your mechanism for the distribution of these funds?\n\nMR. GOMERY: Well, I see that as less of a problem, I think, if by the stroke of serendipity or whatever, some larger force than I, it would happen. Let me preface.\n\nI think government works. I am a fan of government. I think some of the greatest things that have been contributed in the United States of America in our 200-year history that I have studied intensively have been done by government. I do not believe, as some of my fellow Washingtonians, that everything that touches government is bad. I think that is a fallacious assumption, that is a narrow reading of history and that is dead wrong. So I think that [the mechanism might be] a board, a panel--and I mulled this over, asking my spouse who does know how these things work better than I. I would put it in the Education Department, and I would make it responsible for creating libraries and access, as my colleagues have articulated much more clearly than I have. First you have to preserve and then you can provide access, but you cannot do either without money.\n\nMR. SHEFTER: Thank you.\n\nCHAIRWOMAN KANIN: I want to address a question to our counsel here as a result of your proposal, Doug. Has a user tax in this form ever been proposed and what was the reaction to it?\n\nMR. SCHWARTZ: I do not think one has ever been proposed.\n\nCHAIRWOMAN KANIN: No one has ever proposed that particular way of raising funds?\n\nMR. GOMERY: Then I suggest we should call it the Gomery Tax. [Laughter.]\n\nMS. MELVILLE [staff member speaking at request of Mr. Tabb]: Jean Firstenberg told me at one point that she had recommended a tax on videocassette rental.\n\nMR. GOMERY: Actually, she said to me at one point.\n\nCHAIRWOMAN KANIN: Yes. I just wondered if it had ever flown?\n\nAnd then a question to Mr. Kolker. You talked about educational outreach. Would you see a particular database just for the educational community or would a national database serve those needs?\n\nMR. KOLKER: I think that the building of a national database should be sufficient and I think, as we all know who are working in electronic libraries, that databases are only as good as the software that allows access to them. And so it may be useful to have varieties of access, different kinds of software for different kinds of users that would access more or less information, whatever a particular user needed. So there might be a particular educational software package to get into that database and no reason to provide more than that.\n\nMR. KOLKER: To have a separate entity.\n\nMR. FRANCIS: Could I just follow up on Fay's question just for a moment? And I would also like to ask another one.\n\nThere was a lot of discussion in Europe about a tax on blank videocassettes because blank videocassettes are used for time shifting. This could be used as a source of funding for film and television preservation because the blank videocassette is mainly used for time shifting purposes. The idea never got anywhere in the end because the manufacturers' lobby successfully killed it. But that was one that was discussed quite widely in several European countries.\n\nAnd the other question I would like to ask and I think it is really addressed to Tom. One of the other people testifying mentioned that there was a lot of expertise, particularly all the people who teach and are involved in film studies, which could be valuable to archives as far as advising them on what should be preserved and what should be made available. Often I think archivists feel they are working on their own. They very seldom receive requests specifically to preserve or to acquire or make available a particular film.\n\nIn SCS, do you ever have discussions amongst your membership in order to draw up lists of films that you particularly want to see available which are not currently available? It would be extremely valuable to archivists to have such lists. I do not know whether you do that.\n\nMR. GUNNING: There is, and I think actually John Belton would be able to answer this even better. There has been for several years in the Society for Cinema Studies a subcommittee on film availability which, I think, John was at least a member of and may still be, which was partly involved although primarily in terms of making information available about commercial rental of 16mm prints for classroom use.\n\nBut it is in place, I think, to address the type of issue that you are talking about. Since both of us are here, we can see to it. But I might ask John if he has any further comment on that.\n\nMR. BELTON: I think the interesting issue that has been brought up has to do with the relationship of the academic community to the archival community. The testimony that all of you have presented is one which expands the parameters of preservation to include access and availability.\n\nSCS has concentrated so far solely on non-theatrical distribution and the availability of films in this area. In fact, I would turn it around and ask all of you perhaps to comment on models of availability that perhaps already exist. For example, the Museum of Modern Art has a circulating library and the Museum of Modern Art is one of the only archives in this country that attempts to distribute the materials that it holds in its collection, as well as some materials from the Eastman House collection. Is this a viable model for both creating bridges between the academic community, the general public which is being serviced by the academic community (that is, college students and so forth), and the archives as part of a larger preservation plan? Anyone?\n\nMR. KOLKER: Well, would another model be Bill Blakefield's unit at the [National] Archives?\n\nMR. BELTON: Could you explain that?\n\nMR. KOLKER: Where he distributes and circulates material from that group. There is a different problem, obviously, because there is not a copyright problem with the products that are circulated out of the Archives. One of the elements that I am interested in is whether the Board or some other organization can begin a negotiation process in which the copyright problem is made somewhat less severe so that prints or other forms, other media, are made available.\n\nI am concerned with the fact that 16mm format is becoming less and less useful to us because of expense and because of the appalling quality of those films. So I felt a bit constrained, because I know that the charge of the Board is not to consider alternative media but I am wondering if perhaps [after] the preservation of a given print, the manufacture of a laserdisc version would be considered and that disc be available for either purchase or distribution, circulation, if the appropriate contracts could be worked out.\n\nDR. BILLINGTON: I would really welcome any thoughts that you have on how one deals with the copyright problem in order to distribute films. That is the fundamental problem. The paper print distribution, which is another model that you have mentioned, all three models that you have mentioned as positive, simply do not have the problem of copyright. If you are going to get into a serious distribution program of the films, you are going to have to deal with this.\n\nThe Copyright Office is part of the Library of Congress, and we are not only obliged but we think it right and proper to be vigilant custodians of the intellectual property rights and so forth. But I see a situation emerging in another area where, despite reassurances that copyright will be respected, some of the more aggressive special interest lobbyists--let me put it directly and bluntly, you need only read today's paper--by getting certain issues into certain agendas and with the cooperation of the media, these special interests are able to simply misrepresent and, in effect, undercut the possibility of added services in needed areas that can be performed by the nation's libraries by raising this problem as a bugaboo.\n\nNow, it seems to me what we need is some creative way both of solving the added distribution problem and respecting intellectual property rights. We would not do it at the Library of Congress, and I do not think the other repository institutions would do it in any way that did not respect the laws of the country. But this is being presented by people who are in many cases more Catholic than the Pope on this issue as, in effect, an obstacle. It is being constantly thrown out to frighten corporate executives.\n\nThe Library of Congress is part of the legislative branch of government. We are not a lobbying organization so we are in unequal combat with people who are, in effect, preventing added new services of distribution by simply presenting this as an obstacle.\n\nNow, what is the practical way to deal with this, since we are in unequal combat? We are not a public relations and sales organization; we are a public service organization. We are trying to expand public services, but we do have to have some way of presenting this argument and of coming up with a formula. Because, if there is going to be an added, more aggressive distribution program, as there surely should be, there is going to have to be some way of answering these questions besides reassuring people that it is going to happen, so I appreciate any thoughts you have on it.\n\nThis is a very practical and current problem for a whole range of questions. Because, frankly, I can say that in the current budgetary climate, in my view, unless great public institutions are going to be able to extend their services the people who are lobbying intensively against the extension of services are going to destroy the great public institutions because there are not the dynamics of support as such. It is easier, if you are in prison in California today, to get access to a library than if you are in a public high school, and that situation is getting worse and worse all the time.\n\nI see this question of extending services not only as important intrinsically for better teaching and better understanding of our world, but for the survival of institutions that are being severely undercut, and may even be destroyed, by the shortsighted attempt to create problems which do not exist in fact, but are made to exist, because of the preference of the media to dramatize problems rather than to talk about opportunities. This is a very serious practical problem that affects us all. I really would appreciate any thoughts you have on this.\n\nMR. KOLKER: I am absolute novice in terms of copyright law and I can only think of it in an administrative gambit which would be studio-by-studio or even individual-by- individual discussion.\n\nFor example, I have noticed in my own discussions and from my own work a very slight opening of the door at Warner Bros. There is a gentleman, I believe vice president in charge of properties, who has expressed verbally to me that he is interested in the work of film scholarship. That alone is an extraordinary statement. And perhaps this is one way, to locate these individuals who are indicating exactly what you say, a recognition that there is a problem and a possibility that they may at least initiate a discussion to solve it.\n\nI think a lot of it is as exactly as you say. It is a smokescreen because it means work for them. It means work for the studio to begin dealing with their own entangled copyright situation. But the only way to do it that I know of is to begin talking, and to explain the problem in those terms, with that kind of eloquence, and to see where the points of entry exist.\n\nMR. TABB: Do the other speakers want to respond to this question?\n\nMR. GUNNING: Well, one brief point that I think I would make: expanded distribution and exhibition of films of the sort that I am thinking. I do not have a Gunning Plan to match the Gomery Tax, but I think there are ways maybe to go about it that do not necessarily involve violation of copyright or even of ownership.\n\nOne of the things that I think is very extraordinary to keep in mind--and it is generally kind of a problem but it actually is also an opportunity--is the fact that film is one of the few art forms that makes money. And consequently there are ways, I think, to run distribution and exhibition with just a lower profit margin or no profit that would not necessarily collapse if copyright royalties and duties had to be observed.\n\nOne of the things that strikes me around this country, although I tend to agree with Professor Gomery that government is a beneficent thing, it is behind things that pop up otherwise. In almost every large urban center and in many small urban centers--I know a few out in the country--there are not-for-profit film theaters that are set up. They partly proceed by grants, but they basically just are able to run on a kind of flat profit scheme. Their idea is primarily to bring films to communities and things like that.\n\nNow, those have not been organized by a government. But I think there would be a possibility of working that out, and also that there is already a kind of network of such places in existence, that they also could be a framework from which one could think about a not-for-profit distribution scheme, which would not necessarily have to totally upset or throw out copyright in any sense, but that would precisely be able to proceed "
