        "text": "To determine if an item is recyclable or not, use the Recyclopedia search tool above. Below are some of the top questions we get about specific items.\n\nStyrofoam\n\nStyrofoam is the #1 searched material in the Recyclopedia. Expanded polystyrene foam (aka Styrofoam) in any shape or size is not recyclable in your household recycling bin. This material is difficult to recycle and there is little market demand for it.\n\nCan‚Äôt stand the thought of throwing it away? Try reusing it or find a drop off location to recycle it.\n\nPro Tip: Packing peanuts can be returned to most shipping stores for reuse.\n\nPizza Boxes\n\nEMPTY pizza boxes can be recycled (with the exception of frozen pizza boxes).\n\nRemove all food, liners, and pizza savers (plastic tables) before placing the box in the recycling bin. Leftover pizza (if there is any) can be composted or put in the trash.\n\nWhat about the grease?\n\nGrease and trace amounts of residual cheese are OK. Paper recycling mills have assured us that this does not interfere with the paper making process. For more information, check out the Recycle Smart MA newsletter article: ‚ÄúNo Matter How You Slice It.‚Äù\n\nPro tip: Fold the box inside out before you put it in the recycling bin. This will help ensure the box is empty and there are no surprises at the recycling facility!\n\nShredded Paper\n\nShredded paper should NOT go in your recycling bin, even if it is in a stapled paper bag. Shredded paper is considered ‚Äúdreaded paper‚Äù at the recycling facility. It either ends up floating all over the place like confetti or, if it gets wet, it turns into pulp and sticks to food and beverage containers. Either way it isn‚Äôt captured for recycling.\n\nThe good news: many communities host paper shredding events where you can watch your documents get shredded on site in a truck equipped with industrial shredders. These trucks will take the paper directly to paper recycling facilities. Check with your local recycling program to find out when and where the next event will take place: bit.ly/2Nk9epX‚Å£.\n\nOffice supply stores also offer shredding as a paid service you can access year-round, and they send the paper to secure facilities that shred and recycle the paper.\n\nWhat if my paper is already shredded?\n\nCompost it! There is no limit to how much shredded paper you can add to your compost pile since it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbrown‚Äù ingredient (which can be 100% of the pile). An easy recipe would have 75% shredded paper and 25% food scraps ‚Äì or 3 parts brown to 1-part green (food scraps, grass, etc.). Dampen the paper with water and you‚Äôre set; it should fully compost within 3 to 6 months. Check out this poster for simple composting steps https://www.mass.gov/doc/poster-composting-is-easy/download\n\nFor curbside or subscription compost pick up services, please check with your municipality or composting service provider, as each has their own rules.\n\nAlternatively, check out this blog post, ‚Äú11 Uses for Shredded Paper.‚Äù\n\nIf none of these options work for you, please put shredded paper in the trash.\n\nCartons (Milk, Juice, Soup)\n\nFor most of Massachusetts, cartons should go in the trash.\n\nCartons are made with multiple layers of plastic and paper (plus an aluminum layer in drink and soup boxes). To recycle them, they must be sorted and sent to a special mill that can separate the layers.\n\nThere are currently only 3 mills in the U.S. that recycle cartons right now and the cost to sort, collect, and transport this material is prohibitive for most recycling facilities. In Massachusetts, there is only one Material Recovery Facility (MRF) located in Western Massachusetts (the Springfield MRF) that accepts cartons for recycling. The remaining MRFs in the state do not have the equipment to properly sort out cartons or storage space to accumulate enough cartons for a marketable load (which can take 6 months or more).\n\nIf your municipality sends your recyclables to the Springfield MRF (see this list), you can put cartons in your recycling bin. Otherwise, please place your cartons in the trash to ensure your community doesn‚Äôt face increased fees for contaminated recycling.\n\nIf carton recycling becomes more economically feasible in the New England area and the rest of the Massachusetts MRFs start accepting this material, we will update the Recycle Smart MA guide accordingly.\n\nPlastic Bags\n\nPlastic bags of any kind, size, or shape do NOT belong in the household recycling bin. This includes plastic grocery bags, bags from e-commerce orders, bags with recycling symbols and the plastic resin number on it, produce bags, bread bags, pellet bags, pet food bags, dry cleaning bags, cereal box liners, product and case wrap, etc.\n\nPlastic bags and plastic wrap (collectively known as ‚Äúplastic film‚Äù in recycling industry short-hand) are the number one problem at recycling facilities because they wrap around sorting machinery, shutting down the sorting line often multiple times per day. Workers then must cut the plastic off the machines, which puts them at risk of injury. Check out this short video about plastic bags and other tanglers at the recycling sorting facility.\n\nAlthough they do not belong in the household recycling bin, plastic bags and wrap SHOULD be recycled ‚Ä¶ at drop-off collection bins in most supermarkets. See the Recycle Smart MA Newsletter ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the bag‚Ä¶‚Äù for more information about what types of plastic bags and wrap can be recycled at a drop-off location near you.\n\nTake-Out Containers\n\nTake-out food comes in containers of many sizes shapes, and colors. Check out the graphic below or this helpful <1 minute video to learn what is and isn‚Äôt recyclable from your next carry out order. Still not sure? Check the Recyclopedia.\n\nEating at home? Ask the restaurant to skip the plastic utensils, straws, napkins or condiment packets next time you order.\n\nWant to see less waste? Start a conversation with your local restaurant owner about greener take-out packaging options. Feel free to share this RecyclingWorks guide for restaurants about reducing waste from restaurant takeout and delivery meals.\n\nüì∑: RecyclingWorks MA\n\nTo learn more, check out the Recycle Smart MA newsletter ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Talk about Plastic: Are My Take-Out Containers All Trash?‚Äù\n\nTubes & Pouches ‚Äì i.e. toothpaste, lotions, deodorant, juice/food pouches\n\nMany food, beauty, health, and cleaning products come in flexible pouches and tubes. These items do NOT belong in your household recycling bin. For example, this includes toothpaste, lotion and deodorant tubes, the standup zippered bags that trail mix and dried fruit comes in, baby food pouches, the sachets that sample beauty products come in, or soap refills that come in a pouch with a spout. Remember, recycling facilities are designed to sort hard plastic containers. If it‚Äôs a clean and empty plastic bottle, jar, jug or tub, it can be recycled. Otherwise, check the Recyclopedia or throw it out.\n\nGlass Items (mirrors, drinking glasses, crockery)\n\nJust because something is made of glass does not guarantee it can be recycled. Flower vases, candle jars, mirrors, drinking glasses, and crockery do NOT belong in your recycling bin. These items cannot be recycled because of additives that cause them to melt a different temperature than beverage and food containers (like pasta jars or wine bottles). Consider reusing or donating items in good condition that you no longer need.\n\nClothing and Textiles\n\nMost clothing and textiles can be reused or recycled ‚Ä¶ but NOT in your household recycling bin. The equipment at recycling facilities is not designed to sort clothing. For more information see ‚Äúwhat is a tangler?‚Äù\n\nInstead, drop off unwanted clothing or textiles at a nearby clothing collection box, your favorite local charity or thrift store, or see if your community offers curbside pick-up of clothing and textiles.\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about donating clothing and textiles is that items must be in good condition. It ends up, clothing and other textiles (bedding, towels, table linens, etc.) are a still useful, even if they are stained, ripped, missing buttons, or have broken zippers. As long as items aren‚Äôt wet, moldy, or soaked in oil or hazardous materials, they can be donated. If they are unable to be sold for reuse locally, they may be baled and sold to export markets, made into industrial wiping clothes, or converted to fiber for insulation, carpet padding or sound-proofing material.\n\nLearn more about textile recovery in Massachusetts or use the Beyond the Bin Recycling Directory to find out where to recycle, reuse, or re-purpose your textiles.\n\nFor more about textile donation and reducing your ‚Äúfashion footprint,‚Äù see the Recycle Smart MA newsletters: What‚Äôs in your closet? and Making Every Thread Count\n\nBatteries\n\nBatteries do NOT belong in the recycling bin. Single-use alkaline batteries (AAA, AA, C, D, and 9-volt) can be put in the trash or taken to a battery recycler but these are few and far between.\n\nRechargeable batteries of all kinds are a serious fire hazard when placed in the trash or in the recycling bin. To find a recycling location for rechargeable batteries consult Call2Recycle.\n\nButton batteries (e.g., the round ones found in your watch) may contain mercury and should be dropped-off at a collection bin, event, or recycled through a mail-in program.\n\nContact your local municipality or visit Call2Recycle‚Äôs website to find drop-off sites near you: https://www.call2recycle.org/locator/\n\nMetal Items\n\nThe only metal items that should go in your household recycling bin are empty metal food and beverage cans, and clean aluminum foil, pie tins, and baking trays.\n\nAlthough they are made of metal ‚Äî items like pots, pans, baking sheets, metal gutters, car parts, propane tanks, bike wheels and hangers are classified as ‚Äúscrap metal‚Äù and cannot be recycled with food and beverage containers. Check with your local municipal recycling website for a scrap metal drop-off bin or search Beyond The Bin Recycling Directory for scrap metal recyclers in your area.\n\nOr ‚Äì donate items that are in decent condition.\n\nStretchable, Flexible Plastics\n\nStretchable plastics like the kind found around paper towels, toilet paper, or bottled water do not belong in the recycling bin. Just like plastic bags, plastic wrap gets tangled in machinery and can shut down equipment at the recycling facility.\n\nMany stretchable plastics (also known as film plastics) can be recycled along with your plastic bags at your local supermarket drop-off bin.\n\nCheck out this guide for what types of stretchable/flexible plastics can be recycled and where:"
