        "text": "For last year’s Broadway Bound Blogathon, I reviewed the\n\nHallmark Hall of Fame presentation, A Tale of Two Cities. This is an adaptation\n\nfrom 1980 I liked so much, it was one of the best movies I saw in 2023! While\n\nreflecting on that film, I realized it’s been a whole year since I reviewed a\n\nHallmark Hall of Fame production. To make up for lost time, I chose to write\n\nabout the 1987 Hallmark Hall of Fame film, Pack of Lies! Two years\n\nbefore this movie aired on television, Pack of Lies premiered on\n\nBroadway, making the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie a good choice for the\n\nblogathon. Pack of Lies is also a Hallmark Hall of Fame film from the ‘80s\n\nI haven’t seen before. One of my aspirations is to see as many Hallmark Hall of\n\nFame movies as realistically possible. Out of the titles I have seen, I’ve\n\nnoticed the mystery genre is rarely represented throughout the Hallmark Hall of\n\nFame collection. That fact is another reason why I chose to review Pack of\n\nLies!\n\nThings I liked about the film:\n\nThe acting: Ellen Burstyn and Teri Garr portray Barbara\n\nJackson and Helen Schaefer in Pack of Lies. The friendship of these two\n\ncharacters highlights how different they are from one another. Helen has a very\n\noutgoing and bubbly personality, a talkative woman who’s willing to solve\n\nproblems. Meanwhile, Barbara is more reserved, dressing more modestly and\n\navoiding conflict whenever possible. Part of why the differences between these\n\ncharacters were achieved was through the acting abilities of both Ellen and\n\nTeri! They presented the uniqueness of their characters through various emotions\n\nand expressions. When creating a movie where actors portray friends, the believability\n\nof their performances can make or break that illusion. The aforementioned illusion\n\nwas certainly created and maintained throughout Pack of Lies!\n\nIn stories where a character has some degree of authority,\n\ntheir personality is usually serious. This can be a challenge for an actor or\n\nactress, as there are few opportunities to utilize a variety of expressions and\n\nemotions. That didn’t stop Alan Bates from portraying Stewart and making that\n\nperformance memorable! When Mr. and Mrs. Jackson first meet Stewart, he leaves\n\na trusting first impression. During this meeting, Alan incorporates eye movements,\n\nvocal inflections, and variations of mouth movements to create an interaction\n\nthat appeared realistic. Because of the realistic nature of Stewart’s meeting,\n\nthe scene itself contains a sense of realism. This realism is consistently\n\ncarried in the movie through the acting performances!\n\nA mystery within a mystery: The meeting between Stewart and\n\nthe Jacksons I previously referenced in this review is about how Stewart is\n\nlooking for a man named Laurence. The main mystery in Pack of Lies is\n\ndiscovering who Laurence is and why Stewart is interested in finding him. At\n\nthe same time, the legitimacy of Stewart and his mission serve as a second\n\nmystery. Because of the vagueness Stewart provides to the Jackson family, it\n\nleaves both the Jackson family and the audience wondering who Stweart really is\n\nand why he wants to confront Laurence so much. This second mystery provides an\n\nadded layer of intrigue to the overall story!\n\nProviding books as gifts: While visiting their friends, Helen\n\nand Peter Schaefer, Barbara and Bob Jackson receive books as gifts from Peter.\n\nBarbara loves art so much, she and Helen take art classes regularly. Meanwhile,\n\nBob is an employee in the aircraft industry. In the meeting between the Jackson\n\nfamily and Stewart, Stewart points out a model plane Bob built. From Peter, Barbara\n\nreceives a book of drawings from the Clark Institute in Massachusetts. Peter gives\n\nBob a book about the first flights across the Atlantic. These books were\n\nthoughtful presents Peter took the time and effort to find. Looking back on the\n\nHallmark films I’ve seen, including those from Hallmark Hall of Fame,\n\ncharacters receiving books as gifts are rarely shown. Therefore, I appreciate\n\nthis creative choice from Pack of Lies’s creative team to fill a\n\ncreative void that is, more often than not, overlooked.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the film:\n\nTelling instead of showing: In an ideal movie, it’s\n\nimportant to show and tell what’s happening on screen. But because film is a\n\nvisual medium, showing should be emphasized. Unfortunately, in Pack of Lies,\n\ntelling was preferred over showing. Throughout the movie, Stewart tells Mr. and\n\nMrs. Jackson that a man named Laurence Powell is a man of interest. The reason for\n\nthis interest is his possible connections to Russian communists. Dialogue is\n\nthe only way the truth about Laurence and Stewart’s reason for recruiting the\n\nJackson family is revealed. The subject of espionage in entertainment media isn’t\n\nalways action-packed and adrenaline-fueled. If a creative team knows their\n\nstory will have low energy, they should maintain a sense of suspense and\n\nintrigue by showing what’s going on.\n\nLittle lapse in time: At the beginning of the movie, Stewart\n\nassures the Jackson family he’ll only observe Laurence for a day or two. As the\n\nstory progresses, Stewart’s mission ends up lasting longer than the proposed\n\none to two days. Like I just said in this review, Pack of Lies\n\nemphasized telling instead of showing. The little lapse in time throughout the\n\nmovie is another example of this flaw. Christmas decorations in the Jackson\n\nhouse are the only indication a significant period of time took place. Prior to\n\nthat part of the story, the film looks like events happened within a week.\n\nThings that don’t make sense: As I’ve been saying in this\n\nreview, Stewart’s mission is to observe Laurence over a period of time. The more\n\ninformation revealed by Stewart, the more the Jacksons and the audience learn\n\nStewart knew more about Laurence than he originally let on. I know the subject\n\nof espionage can be varied and complicated when included in entertainment\n\nmedia. However, with everything I just said, why didn’t Stewart just arrest\n\nLaurence instead of observing him over multiple days? Why did Stewart need to\n\nget the Jackson family involved in the first place? This is one example where Pack\n\nof Lies doesn’t make sense.\n\nMy overall impression:\n\nHallmark Hall of Fame movies, like any creative endeavor, are\n\nnot created equally. As I shared in this review’s introduction, I liked A\n\nTale of Two Cities so much, it was one of the best movies I saw last year.\n\nSadly, I can’t say the same about Pack of Lies. The 1987 presentation\n\nwas a two hour slow and tedious build-up to a resolution that was underwhelming\n\nand anticlimactic. The cause of these flaws was the emphasis on telling instead\n\nof showing. This is not the first time a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie from the ‘80s\n\nlet me down, as I also found 1985’s The Corsican Brothers disappointing.\n\nAfter watching Pack of Lies, I learned the movie was based on a true\n\nstory. Now knowing this, I think the story would have benefitted more had it\n\nbecome a documentary instead. As I wrap up my review of Pack of Lies, I\n\nreflect on a Hallmark commercial I have seen. In this commercial, a man, whose\n\nfirst language is not English, is looking for the perfect card for his wife,\n\nwho will soon arrive in the United States. When he goes to a Hallmark store,\n\nthe man is assisted by an employee named Rose, who helps him find exactly what\n\nhe is looking for. Another man who occasionally appears throughout the\n\ncommercial reveals the events in the commercial are based on a true story.\n\nHonestly, the story behind that Hallmark commercial is a more fascinating movie\n\nidea than what was presented in this Hallmark Hall of Fame film.\n\nOverall score: 5 out of 10\n\nHave you seen Pack of Lies? Which Broadway show do\n\nyou wish received a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie? Tell me in the comment\n\nsection!\n\nHave fun on Broadway!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\nAs I mentioned in my list of the top ten worst movies I saw in 2023, I saw enough films to create a best movies of the year list! But because I saw more movies I disliked than liked, there aren’t enough films to create an honorable mentions section. When I look back on the best films I saw this year, I realize the majority of the titles are made-for-TV productions. Looking specifically at the top three best movies of 2023, I noticed a shared theme; all of the movies contain historical fiction stories. Since I reviewed most of the films on this list, I will provide the links to those reviews in this article. So, as the sun sets on 2023, let’s start my list of the top ten best movies I saw this year!\n\n10. Curious Caterer: Grilling Season\n\nOut of all the movies in the Curious Caterer trilogy, I’d say Curious Caterer: Grilling Season is the best film! It improves on some of the predecessor’s flaws, like adding more humor into the script. The film also made different creative decisions, such as giving Marla more involvement in the mystery, that proved this series still has many ideas at the creative team’s disposal. One of the strengths of the Curious Caterer series, including the sequel, is the quality of the acting performances! From the main actors to the supporting talent, each on-screen interaction appeared so natural, it allowed the story to feel immersive. As of late 2023/early 2024, there have only been two mystery movies announced by Hallmark Movies & Mysteries; True Justice: Family Ties and Gilded Newport Mysteries: Murder at the Breakers. Hopefully, the network will consider continuing the Curious Caterer series.\n\nTake 3: Curious Caterer: Grilling Season Review + 455 Follower Thank You\n\n9. Christmas Princess (2017)\n\nRevisiting this film after seeing it for the first time six years ago, Christmas Princess still holds up! What works in this movie’s favor is how it focuses on Donaly’s journey to the Rose Court. This creative choice not only prevented the 2017 made-for-TV project from adopting several Christmas related tropes and cliches, it also gave the movie a chance to tell a more unique story for a Christmas production. Other good creative decisions include Donaly’s wardrobe and providing a thorough explanation of the Rose Court process. Looking back on Christmas Princess, I’m surprised there hasn’t been more movies made related to the Tournament of Roses. It’ll be interesting to see if a studio or network finds a story inspiring enough to adapt into a film!\n\nTake 3: Christmas Princess (2017) Review\n\n8. Frankenweenie (2012)\n\nAs I’ve said in past reviews, I rarely receive an opportunity to write about animated movies. So, it is even rarer for an animated title to appear on my best of the year list. What made 2012’s Frankenweenie so memorable was a collection of good creative choices. Some of them include the creatures within the story, presenting the film in black-and-white imagery, and sprinkling “Easter Eggs” throughout the movie. But another reason why Frankenweenie landed on my best movies of the year list is how much heart this story contained. Sure, I knew this project would be a cute take on Mary Shelley’s book. However, the heart-filled nature of the film’s story was such a pleasant surprise!\n\nTake 3: Frankenweenie (2012) Review + 470 Follower Thank You\n\n7. Mystery on Mistletoe Lane\n\nAfter the release of Murder, She Baked: A Plum Pudding Mystery, I’ve always wondered why Hallmark Movies & Mysteries didn’t create more Christmas themed mystery films. Mystery on Mistletoe Lane proved that the network should, at least, consider making more mystery stories that take place around Christmastime. With festive clues and well-written riddles, the mystery itself left me on the edge of my seat, curious to see how the mystery would be resolved. I also liked the movie’s subplot, as it was interesting to see the creative ways Christmas activities were incorporated into the story. Another factor that worked in the favor of Mystery on Mistletoe Lane is how the mystery provided lower stakes. This allowed the movie to maintain the cheerful and light-hearted tone most viewers expect from Hallmark’s Christmas offerings.\n\n6. RKO 281\n\nToward the end of my review of RKO 281, I said good films leave a lasting impression. Not only did the 1999 movie leave a lasting impression, it earned a spot on my best of the year list! There are many aspects of RKO 281 that are so good, you will find yourself saying, “Wait, this is an HBO film”? Every component of this movie goes above and beyond, looking and feeling like it should have received a theatrical premiere. For every “classic” or “iconic” film, there is a journey for how that film came to exist. The journey shown in RKO 281 made me appreciate the efforts taken to bring Citizen Kane to the big screen. Reflecting on both Citizen Kane and RKO 281, it makes me wonder if other well-known movies have an incredible behind-the-scenes story worthy of its own film?\n\nTake 3: RKO 281 (1999) Review\n\n5. Haunted Harmony Mysteries: Murder in G Major\n\nWhen I talked about Jesse Stone: Night Passage in my top ten worst movies I saw in 2023 list, I mentioned how, for me, 2023 was not the year for mysteries. However, there were a few stand-out mystery movies, with Haunted Harmony Mysteries: Murder in G Major being one of them. In the 2020s so far, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries have premiered mystery films that lack the “coziness” viewers have come to expect from the network’s mystery projects. Haunted Harmony Mysteries: Murder in G Major brought that “coziness” back, filling a void Hallmark Movies & Mysteries have been abandoning. Because the story incorporates a ghost, it gives this movie a unique identity and adds more creativity to the realm of Hallmark’s mystery library. As I said earlier in this list, there have, so far, only been two mystery movies announced by Hallmark Movies & Mysteries. Sometime in 2024, I hope Hallmark turns Haunted Harmony Mysteries into a series, as there is so much potential for this story to lend itself to a multi-chapter title!\n\n4. The Great Muppet Caper\n\nIf I could describe The Great Muppet Caper in one word, it would be “joyful”. That’s because, as I said in my review, this movie exudes so much joy! Each Muppet character had a specific purpose within the story, making every Muppet feel important. The jokes were well delivered, thanks to clever writing and solid acting. The Great Muppet Caper contains a simpler story that is easier to follow. But because of how good other aspects of this film are, that simplistic story works in The Great Muppet Caper’s favor. Since I liked the 1981 movie, maybe, in 2024, I’ll check out other productions featuring the Muppets!\n\nTake 3: The Great Muppet Caper Review (The Great Muppet Guest Star Caper Double Feature Part 1)\n\n3. A Biltmore Christmas\n\nSimilar to Top Gun: Maverick, I had low expectations for A Biltmore Christmas. Hallmark’s decision to give the 2023 Christmas movie a lot of hype and publicity made me skeptical of the movie’s quality. When I finally checked the film out, I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was! There was so many things Hallmark got right; from the strength of the cast to the attention given to historical accuracy. While this type of story is nothing new for romance films, it does provide Hallmark Channel with a different type of narrative for their Christmas pictures. Within the 2020s so far, I noticed how Hallmark is creating more projects that have historical fiction elements. I’m interested to see what the network’s next big, historical fiction, Christmas movie ends up being in 2024!\n\n2. Hallmark Hall of Fame’s A Tale of Two Cities\n\nWhen I shared my overall impression of A Tale of Two Cities, I stated how both Oliver! and Nicholas Nickelby found a place in my year-end best movies lists. I also stated how that tradition would continue, as the Hallmark Hall of Fame adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities left such a good impression on me. However, this is the first time a Charles Dickens adaptation has earned a spot in my best list’s top three! Even though this film is longer than most Hallmark productions, it never feels like two hours and thirty-six minutes. Instead, A Tale of Two Cities feels like a well-paced, well-written, and well-acted depiction of Charles Dickens’ work. The creative team’s attention to detail also added to the movie’s great quality. It showed me the people who created this adaptation cared about the project they were working on. I have said before how I wanted to see as many Hallmark Hall of Fame productions as realistically possible. I hope to find more Hallmark Hall of Fame movies that are just as good as A Tale of Two Cities!\n\nTake 3: Hallmark Hall of Fame’s A Tale of Two Cities Review\n\n1. Hallmark Hall of Fame’s Caroline?\n\nI know there’s no such thing as the “perfect” Hallmark Hall of Fame movie. But 1990’s Caroline? is the closest thing to it! The strengths of the project far outweigh the flaws, coming together to create a film that is intriguing, creative, and even thought-provoking. I liked seeing the characters’ interactions, as they made the movie captivating to watch. Similar to Hallmark Hall of Fame’s A Tale of Two Cities, the creative team behind Caroline? gave attention to detail. In the case of the 1990 film, this attention to detail was placed in differentiating between the past and the “present”. In my opinion, Caroline? is one of the more underrated Hallmark productions. I also believe it should have been re-released on DVD.\n\nTake 3: Hallmark Hall of Fame’s Caroline? Review + 460 Follower Thank You\n\nHave fun in 2024!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\nMy last movie review was for the 1983 adaptation of The Best Christmas Pageant Ever. Revisiting the film after so many years, I learned the production was more of a “very special episode” of a television show than a movie. Wanting to revisit more movies of Christmas past, I remembered how much I liked the 2017 made-for-TV project, Christmas Princess! In the early days of 18 Cinema Lane, I mentioned how Christmas Princess was my favorite film of 2017. I recall enjoying the movie more than Hallmark’s offerings that year. But like any film from the past, perspectives can change. A movie once loved may not hold up when viewed twice. However, a film that was labeled as “bad” may not seem so bad the second time around. Not having seen Christmas Princess in six years, I wanted to review the film to see if any of my opinions on it have changed!\n\nThings I liked about the film:\n\nThe acting: A well-acted scene in Christmas Princess is when Donaly, portrayed by Nicole Muñoz, comes face-to-face with her biological mother, Roberta, portrayed by Kaaren de Zilva. Remembered by Donaly as a bitter woman, Roberta still carries a chip on her shoulder. Anytime she speaks to Donaly, Roberta has a passive aggressive tone in her voice. She also has a pessimistic attitude and uses that attitude to try to belittle Donaly. In Roberta’s presence, Donaly appears small. There’s a grimace on her face, troubled at what Roberta might tell her. But when Roberta asks about Donaly’s siblings, Abraham and Emily, Donaly slowly gains confidence. As she’s recalling Emily’s trip to Madrid, Donaly displays a sense of sincerity, refusing to let Roberta dull her sparkle. Smiling while reflecting on this trip, Donaly’s tone of voice makes her sound sure of herself.\n\nZak Santiago will be familiar to Signed, Sealed, Delivered fans as Ramon Rodriguez. A frequent patron of the local grille restaurant, Ramon is a ray of sunshine, carrying himself with a cheerful attitude and a smile almost always on his face. Portraying Ignacio Marquez, the husband of Sara Marquez and father of Donaly, Abraham, and Emily, Zak displays a different persona. This time, Zak carries his character with a more serious attitude. Yet, a kind and caring personality shines through. During a conversation between Ignacio and Donaly, Donaly confesses a fear she’s been working to overcome. After hearing Donaly’s explanation, Ignacio gently tells his daughter why he was hesitant to let Donaly try out for the Rose Court in the first place. He also reassures Donaly how it’s ok to take care of those you love, but how important it is to trust those same people. Zak’s performance in Christmas Princess compared to his performances in the Signed, Sealed, Delivered series provides a great example of how versatile his acting talents are!\n\nProcess of the Rose Court: An honored tradition of the Tournament of Roses is the Rose Court. During the Rose Parade, the Rose Court receive their own special float, waving to every viewer in Pasadena and to those watching the parade at home. When the Rose Court float appears, the parade’s announcers will typically provide a brief explanation of how the young ladies on the float became a member of the Rose Court. Donaly’s journey in Christmas Princess gives a thorough explanation of how one becomes a Rose Princess. From a series of interviews to a montage of community service, the role of a Rose Princess, shown in the movie, means more than just sitting pretty on a parade float. This thorough look at the Rose Court process is educational to viewers who are not familiar with the Rose Parade or the Rose Court.\n\nThe wardrobe: In movies with a more contemporary story, I typically don’t talk about the wardrobe. But in Christmas Princess, there was one detail I missed when I first saw the movie. There are times when Donaly and even her friend, Chloe, wear attire that is either red or contains a flower pattern. In a scene where Donaly receives an email about the Rose Court, Donaly wears a red denim jacket. Not only is her phone case red, the following scene shows Donaly wearing red shoes. At the beginning of the film, Donaly and Chloe attend their first day of senior year. While Chloe wears an outfit with a floral design, Donaly’s blouse is covered in a pattern of flowers. These wardrobe choices were a clever and subtle way of complimenting the movie’s theme.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the film:\n\nRoberta seeking out Donaly: One of the conflicts in Christmas Princess is Donaly facing her traumatic past. A reason why Donaly’s past was traumatic was the result of her biological mother, Roberta. While I thought Roberta’s confrontation with Donaly was a well-acted scene, Roberta’s attempts to find Donaly don’t make sense. Toward the beginning of the film, Roberta shows up at a rummage sale Donaly’s youth group is sponsoring. There’s no explanation provided how Roberta knew Donaly was a part of that specific youth group or how she found out about the rummage sale in the first place. Later in the movie, Roberta looks up the Rose Court finalists, including Donaly, on the Rose Court’s website. How would Roberta get the idea that Donaly was even trying out for the Rose Court when, in a previous scene, she was standing several feet away from Sara Marquez’s car, where, while sitting inside the car, Donaly received the email she’d made it to the next round of try-outs? To me, it would have made more sense if Roberta had learned about Donaly’s Rose Princess crowning in a newspaper article.\n\nThe “friends upset at protagonist for not spending more time with them” cliché: The “friends upset at protagonist for not spending more time with them” cliché is typically found in stories for younger audience members. With this cliché, something will happen that inflates the protagonist’s ego, causing the protagonist’s friends to feel abandoned. In Christmas Princess, Donaly’s friends, Chloe and Trent, are frustrated by Donaly’s busy schedule, partly caused by her Rose Court responsibilities. Even though this cliché had a brief appearance in the movie, its inclusion in the script made Chloe and Trent look hypocritical. Both of Donaly’s friends were supportive of Donaly’s decision to try-out for the Rose Court. Chloe even attended the Rose Court crowning when Donaly was selected. It should also be noted how Chloe also tried out for the Rose Court. She and Donaly attended the same Rose Court seminar, where they learned about what it would take to become a Rose Princess.\n\nThe “it’s not what you think” cliché: When I discussed the top ten worst cliches from Hallmark movies, I brought up the “it’s not what you think” cliché. This cliché shows a character taking what they saw or heard out of context, making them assume the worst out of a situation. One day, while shopping, Sara Marquez becomes injured in a car accident. At home, Donaly overhears Ignacio talking on the phone about Sara’s injury. After Donaly hears Ignacio saying how he doesn’t know what to do about the children, she assumes she and her siblings will be kicked out of their home. Donaly evens packs a suitcase in case she and her siblings are forced to leave. The utilization of the “it’s not what you think” cliché was better in Christmas Princess than other made-for-TV productions. But with Christmas Princess already containing a few conflicts in the script, from Roberta’s confrontation to feelings of self-doubt, I don’t think the inclusion of this cliché was necessary.\n\nMy overall impression:\n\nBack in March, I wrote about the Touched by an Angel episode, “Perfect Little Angel”. In that review, I talked about how the script prioritized Tracy’s journey to the pageant, which prevented the story from adopting several pageant related tropes and cliches. Similarly, Christmas Princess revolves around Donaly’s journey to the Rose Court. Because of this creative decision, several Christmas related cliches and tropes were avoided. Even though Christmas Princess shows secular elements of the holiday, such as gift giving and Christmas trees, these things are not a central focus like in other Christmas films. To me, the 2017 movie is one of the better made-for-TV Christmas titles. It features a more unique story that provides an interesting perspective on the holiday. What also helps are the strength of the various creative elements, such as the acting performances and the wardrobe. While there are some cliches in the story that I don’t think are necessary, the movie has more positives than negatives. Six years later, I’d say Christmas Princess still hold up pretty well!\n\nOverall score: 7.7-7.8 out of 10\n\nHave you seen Christmas Princess? Are there any Christmas movies from 2017 you’d like to see me review? Please tell me in the comment section below!\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\nWhen it comes to movies from the 1970s, I haven’t had the best of luck, this year, finding a film I actually like. While I thought Days of Heaven and The White Buffalo were ok, I wasn’t impressed with The Last Child and Double Nickels. However, I was still determined to search for a movie from the ‘70s I enjoyed. During this search, I stumbled upon the 1971 film, Evel Knievel, a biopic about the stuntman of the same name. Since August’s theme of Genre Grandeur is ‘bikers, bikes, and motorcycles’, I had a great excuse to check this movie out! Choosing the 1971 title for Genre Grandeur also gave me an excuse to learn more about Evel Knievel. Before watching this film, I was familiar with who Evel is and why he was famous. But that basic information was all I knew. Besides broadening my cinematic horizons, I used my entry for Genre Grandeur to learn something new.\n\nThings I liked about the film:\n\nThe acting: In my review of RKO 281, I talked about Liev Schreiber bringing humanity to his portrayal of Orson Welles, finding the heart of the “genius” and putting some genuine emotion behind it. This was successfully done to highlight Orson as more than just a legend. During his career, Evel Knievel became a celebrity, performing stunts that most people would never dream of attempting. Similar to Liev Schreiber, George Hamilton found the man behind the famous name and presented the human side of him. Toward the beginning of the film, Evel is at a local bar, talking to his friends how “something big” is going to happen in town. From furrowing his eyebrows to showing a good-hearted smirk, Evel talks about this upcoming, unknown event with ease and confidence. Through George’s performance, Evel is shown as more than just the famous stuntman, adding a sense of charm to his portrayal.\n\nThroughout the film, Evel interacts with his wife, Linda. Portrayed by Sue Lyon, Linda and Evel’s encounters were pleasant to watch! This is because George and Sue had nice on-screen chemistry! Evel and Linda kind of reminded me of Abby and Bill from Days of Heaven. In the 1978 movie, it felt like Bill and Abby truly got along with one another, with a shared gentleness understood between them. The 1971 shows Linda and Evel respecting one another and, more often than not, being on the same page.\n\nDespite appearing in the movie for a short period of time, Dub Taylor left a memorable impression as Turquoise Smith! The ring-master of a local rodeo, Turquoise had a larger-than-life personality. But this personality never felt over-the-top, thanks to the way Dub portrayed Turquoise. Even when there was a tragedy at the rodeo, Turquoise maintained professionalism and showmanship. Because of the quality of Dub’s acting talents, these components of the character remained consistent.\n\nThe stunt footage: During Evel Knievel, a montage of stunt footage is featured. This footage shows Evel performing various stunts throughout his career, with some stunts more successful than others. The montage is used as a bridge between his early years and “present day”, as the footage emphasizes the dedication and willpower Evel put into his stunts. Since the movie is a bio-pic about a real-life person that existed at one point in time, the montage added contextual depth to the story. It also provides a nice connection between the film and the actual Evel Knievel.\n\nThe messages and themes: As I said in this review’s introduction, I chose to write about Evel Knievel because I wanted to learn more about the titular man. However, I was surprised by the messages and themes that came out of this story. While reflecting on his relationship with Linda, Evel recalls a time when he visited Linda at her high school. During this encounter, Evel explains why he doesn’t play basketball. He feels that in basketball, you don’t have much to lose, as all the stakes are lower. He also confesses how he doesn’t want a lettermen sweater, as Evel doesn’t need to prove he’s a hero. With this, he tells Linda, “heroes know who they are”. Letterman sweaters/jackets have been known for being something high schoolers can earn through academic and athletic achievement. But until watching Evel Knievel, I’ve gained a newfound perspective on this subject.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the film:\n\nTransitions between past and “present”: The story of Evel Knievel is told through Evel’s recollections of his past as he’s preparing for an upcoming stunt. But the way the film jumped between past and “present” was confusing. During one of Evel’s recollections, he remembers a tragedy that took place toward the beginning of his career. As soon as the tragedy occurs, the story is brought back to the “present”, showing Evel nervous about the upcoming stunt and dealing with an injured leg. It took me a little while to realize the story had transitioned between the past and “present”, as the scene changed so abruptly. Personally, I think the story should have been told through a chronological order.\n\nThe past more interesting than the “present”: Like I mentioned in my previous point about the story’s transitions between past and “present”, Evel is preparing for an upcoming stunt in the “present”. But aside from seeing Linda and Evel interact and the aforementioned stunt, I didn’t find the “present” interesting. In fact, I found Evel’s recollections of his past more interesting, as it was an opportunity for me to learn more about Evel Knievel. Even though the stunt in the “present” is shown, it doesn’t take place until the story’s last ten minutes. So, the audience is forced to wait almost the entire movie for that moment.\n\nAn omission of a “where are they now” segment: In most biopics, there is a segment toward the end of the movie which explains what happened to the story’s key people after the events of the movie. But this segment was omitted from Evel Knievel. During the “present”, Evel talks about how he wants to perform a stunt in the Grand Canyon. I was hoping there would be a sense of closure about whether this stunt actually took place. Sadly, no explanation about the fruition of this stunt was provided. I don’t know where Evel’s career was at the time of the film’s release. However, I still think a “where are they now” segment should have been included.\n\nMy overall impression:\n\nI’ve seen some movies where I felt the subject would have been better served through a documentary, as the subject itself is quite fascinating. This is how I felt while watching Evel Knievel. I was able to learn more about the “king of stuntmen” through his recollections of his past. In fact, I found the past more interesting than the “present”, as I was kind of bored by the weak conflict. Despite the confusing jumps between past and “present”, Evel Knievel provided an introduction to the titular man. As this is one of the reasons why I watched the film, the 1971 title does its job. When it comes to biopics, Evel Knievel doesn’t really reinvent the wheel, with the story being pretty straight-forward. The acting, stunt footage, and messages and themes prevent the movie from becoming unmemorable.\n\nOverall score: 6.1 out of 10\n\nHave you seen or heard of Evel Knievel? Which biopic do you think is well-made? Tell me in the comment section!\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\nAs I stated in my USS Christmas review, I will be making a greater effort this year to review more Christmas movies. For my second Christmas film of 2022, I will be writing about the 2021 title, A Godwink Christmas: Miracle of Love! In my list of the top five Hallmark films based on a true story, I mentioned the 2019 movie, A Godwink Christmas: Meant for Love. While talking about that film, I said the sequel was stronger than the first movie. This is because the 2019 title did a better job at explaining and showcasing what a “Godwink” is. Since publishing that list, I have seen the third and fourth films in the Godwink series. The 2020 movie, A Godwink Christmas: Second Chance, First Love, was, in my opinion, fine. However, it was reminiscent of the first movie, where the “Godwinks” feel more like plot conveniences. What are my thoughts on the fourth film? Keep reading to find out!\n\nThings I liked about the film:\n\nCharacter interactions: Like I said in my Words on Bathroom Walls review, interactions between characters are only as good as the actors and actresses portraying those characters. In A Godwink Christmas: Miracle of Love, I enjoyed watching these character interactions, as they were pleasant! One reason why was how believable the camaraderie felt! A Godwink Christmas: Miracle of Love revolves around Joy and Eric’s experiences volunteering during the Christmas season. During their time together, they work alongside two other volunteers, Adam and Sadie. Anytime these four actors (Katherine Barrell, Alberto Frezza, Josh Ssettuba, and Faith Wright) interacted with each other on-screen, I always got the impression their characters truly got along with one another and enjoyed each other’s company. This was accomplished partly with the help of the actors’ and actresses’ acting talents!\n\nThe inclusion of Advent: Advent is an important part of the Christmas season that, almost always, gets overlooked in Christmas cinema. So, imagine my shock when I see Advent included in A Godwink Christmas: Miracle of Love! Advent was the name of the non-profit Eric and Joy volunteered for. However, the candle lighting and messages associated with Advent were incorporated into the script, correlating with what is happening in the story. The non-profit’s volunteer leader, Angelo, lights each candle at select moments in the film, explaining the significance of every one. Honesty is a message associated with the Advent candles, which connects to a dilemma Joy is facing in her personal life.\n\nThe incorporation of a conflict: It’s been several years since I’ve seen A Godwink Christmas: Meant for Love. From what I remember, the story contained a conflict the characters were working to resolve. As I said earlier in this review, Joy and Eric volunteer during the Christmas season in A Godwink Christmas: Miracle of Love. The volunteers’ goal is to help a family who lost their house due to a fire. Because the characters work together to resolve this conflict, this part of the story gave the audience a reason to stay invested in the film. It also provided better explanations for what “Godwinks” are.\n\nShowcasing each volunteer’s talent: As I said in my Top Gun: Maverick review, it can, sometimes, be difficult to evenly distribute character development to every character in a group. But in A Godwink Christmas: Miracle of Love, the group of volunteers was smaller, which allowed the audience to get to know the characters. One way the movie’s characters received character development was having their talents showcased in the story! Sadie is one of the volunteers, like I mentioned earlier in my review. She is an expert when it comes to computers and technological equipment. When she discovers the Romero family’s computer hard-drive was destroyed in the house fire, Sadie finds a way to save at least some family photos. These photos were given to the Romeros as portraits for their new baby’s room.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the film:\n\nJoy’s relationship subplot: At the beginning of the movie, Joy is introduced as a woman in a serious romantic relationship. She has been dating her boyfriend, Danny, for five years. Throughout the film, Joy wonders if she should continue her relationship with Danny. I know A Godwink Christmas: Miracle of Love is based on a true story. I’m also aware Joy needed a personal conflict to work through. However, I, personally, didn’t think the relationship subplot was necessary. In fact, I found this subplot to be the weakest part of the overall story.\n\nAn unresolved story: In this review, I’ve been mentioning how the Romero family lost their house due to a fire. This is why the volunteers of the Advent non-profit are helping them. Because the Romero family play such a vital role in the film’s story and because A Godwink Christmas: Miracle of Love is based on a true story, I was hoping they would receive an update at the end of the movie. Unfortunately, the Romero family was never mentioned. This exclusion made their story seem unresolved.\n\nA missed opportunity: When Joy and Eric first meet Katie Graber and her husband, Dr. Louis Graber, they learn about “Godwinks”. Louis claims that, because he’s a man of science, he thinks “Godwinks” are simply coincidences. Meanwhile, Katie is a firm believer “Godwinks” are God’s intervention. While Louis eventually changes his mind on “Godwinks”, I feel the movie’s creative team missed a good opportunity to explore how people can have differing opinions around a singular subject. As I’ve been saying in this review, A Godwink Christmas: Miracle of Love is based on a true story. I also know there’s only so much story you can tell in two hours. However, I wish a little more time had been given to that aforementioned idea.\n\nMy overall impression:\n\nA Godwink Christmas: Miracle of Love is only the second Christmas movie I’ve reviewed this year, so far. But based on what I saw, I was impressed! The fourth chapter in the Godwink series was reminiscent of the 2019 movie, A Godwink Christmas: Meant for Love. This is because both films a) do a better job showing and explaining what a “Godwink” is and b) featured a conflict the characters were trying to resolve. These types of Godwink stories are the ones I prefer. The movie’s creative team adopted interesting choices that made the story feel more unique. One example was how gift exchanging was incorporated into the script as a way for the Romeros to become acquainted with their new neighbors. While gift exchanging has been featured in countless Hallmark productions, the way it was presented in A Godwink Christmas: Miracle of Love was creative. From what I’ve gathered, there were no Godwink films released or planned for release in 2022. Perhaps we’ll receive one in 2023, on either Hallmark Movies & Mysteries or maybe even Great American Family?\n\nOverall score: 8.4 out of 10\n\nHave you seen any of the Godwink films? Are there any “Godwink” stories you think should be adapted into a movie? Please tell me in the comment section!\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\n‘Films About Doctors, Nurses and Hospitals’. That’s the theme of this month’s Genre Grandeur. There were several titles I could have selected to write about. But after re-reading my list of the top ten films I’d love to review, I decided to take a different approach for November’s event. When I published the aforementioned list in June, I talked about the 1986 made-for-TV movie, Alex: The Life of a Child. The film is based on Frank Deford’s book of the same name, which recounts the life of his daughter, Alex. Because of her Cystic Fibrosis diagnosis, Alex spent a significant amount of time interacting with doctors and nurses, as well as spending time in the hospital. Therefore, I thought Alex: The Life of a Child was an appropriate title to review for November’s Genre Grandeur!\n\nThings I liked about the film:\n\nThe acting: When you have a story that primarily focuses on a younger character/person, you need to recruit a younger actor or actress who has the talent to carry that film on their shoulders. In the case of Gennie James’ portrayal of Alex Deford, her performance highlights the idea of children being smarter than they sometimes receive credit for. Toward the end of the film, Alex asks her doctor whether she’s going to die. Her tone of voice is matter-of-fact, containing a sense of understanding for what’s going on. Alex’s doctor, Dr. Tom Dolan, tries his best to be as honest as possible, while also sugar-coating the news just enough to keep it bearable. Alex then tells Tom, “Ok, I think you better go now”, empathy felt in her voice. However, this empathy was for Tom, as Alex knew how difficult her passing would be for him.\n\nDanny Corkill portrays Alex’s brother, Christian Deford. Even though he appeared in only a handful of scenes, Danny’s performance was a strong one! After receiving the news his family will be adopting a child, Christian goes to his room. In there, he listens to a series of recordings Frank created while Alex was still alive. Throughout this scene, Danny consistently carries a long look on his face. His eyes stare off into the distance, searching for the one person who won’t come back home. Those eyes are paired with a frown and a sad tone in his voice. This scene alone showcases how difficult a family member’s passing can be on a child, especially if that family member is their younger sibling.\n\nAlex and Christian’s mother is portrayed by Bonnie Bedelia. What I liked about her performance was how expressive it was. Shortly after receiving the news about Alex’s diagnosis, Frank and Carole are worried about their daughter’s outcome. During her conversation with Frank, Carole’s eyes are filled with sadness and fear. A deep sense of concern is in Carole’s voice, as she and Frank wonder how much longer Alex will live. That scene displays a portrayal that feels believable, thanks in part to Bonnie’s strong acting abilities!\n\nRespect toward the source material: As I mentioned in the introduction, Alex: The Life of a Child is based on a book written by Alex’s father, Frank. In my list of the top ten movies I’d love to review, I said I had read this book. Even though it’s been years since I read Frank’s novel, there were parts of the story I recognized from the text. One of them was the Deford family’s recording for their answering machine. In both the book and movie, the Deford family creates a funny recording for their answering machine, where they pretend to be in the shower while the phone is ringing. They record the message in the bathroom, leaving the faucet running and singing songs. This moment served as a hilarious moment in Alex’s life, stressing how Alex attempted to seek out the bright spots in her world, despite the severity of her illness.\n\nAddressing the subject of patient advocacy: During one of her hospital stays, Alex’s lung collapses. She not only is in pain, she recognizes where the pain is coming from. When she tells a doctor what is happening, the doctor doesn’t believe her. But when Alex told a nurse she couldn’t breathe, Alex’s concerns were addressed. The subject of patient advocacy, especially for younger patients, is one that has received more acknowledgment in recent years. Alex’s story took place in the 1970s, with the film released in 1986. Therefore, this scene’s inclusion feels ahead of its time. It can also show viewers, including younger viewers, that you should stand up for yourself, even in a medical setting.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the film:\n\nThe adoption subplot: Throughout the film, Frank and Carole Deford plan on adopting a child. This decision comes after the death of their daughter, Alex. In real life, the Deford family did adopt their youngest daughter, Scarlet. But this information was not included in the film’s source material, which was published in 1983. Scarlet’s adoption was addressed when Frank’s book was re-released in 1997, a decade after the film premiered. Because a good amount of the movie focused on this subplot, it took away focus from Alex’s part of the story, even though the film is titled Alex: The Life of a Child.\n\nNo acknowledgment for the Deford family’s involvement with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation: According to Frank Deford’s bio on Goodreads, “he became involved in cystic fibrosis education and advocacy after his daughter, Alexandra (“Alex”) was diagnosed with the illness in the early 1970s”. Frank even became a chairman of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Unfortunately, none of this information is included in the film. In fact, the aforementioned foundation is never brought up. I know there’s only so much story you can tell in an hour and thirty-three minutes. However, I wish this part of the story was included in a subplot instead of the adoption subplot.\n\nUnclear time period: Similar to the book, the movie is told from Frank’s perspective, as he recalls Alex’s short life. Because of the visual nature of film, the audience witnesses some of these moments brought to life. But since the presentation of the “past” scenes doesn’t look much different from the “present” scenes, it was sometimes difficult to determine what part of the story was being told. For the sake of the film, I think the story should have been told in chronological order.\n\nMy overall impression:\n\nBack in April, I reviewed Brian’s Song. In that review, I said I wasn’t as emotionally affected by the movie as I thought I would be. This is because I was familiar with Brian and Gale’s story before watching the film, which prevented me from becoming caught off-guard by the emotional, sadder moments in the story. I ended up having a similar experience while watching Alex: The Life of a Child. As I mentioned in this review, I have read the source material prior to seeing its adaptation. Therefore, I already knew how Alex’s story would play out. From what I remember of the book, I do feel the film was respectful to Frank’s text. I also think the strong acting performances worked in the movie’s favor. Alex: The Life of a Child is a fine, competently made television film. But if you’ve read the book, you’ve already seen the movie.\n\nOverall score: 7.1-7.2 out of 10\n\nHave you seen or read Alex: The Life of a Child? Is there a “based on a true story” movie you’re a fan of? Let me know in the comment section!\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\nLast December, I was nominated for The Pick My Movie Tag by Gill from Realweegiemidget Reviews. My selected topic was “A list of must-watch Hallmark film star biopics”. In my quest to find these kinds of films, however, I found very few Hallmark titles about film stars, especially those I’ve seen. More often than not, I came across Hallmark movies that were based on true stories that were not celebrity related. Therefore, I decided for this tag I would write about the top five Hallmark films based on a true story! Before I list the tag’s rules, I’d like to thank Gill for the nomination, as Gill’s thoughtfulness is appreciated.\n\nThe Tag’s Rules\n\nNominate one or more people to review the film or films of your choice. Or you can request they review something from a certain year, genre, or star. Everyone can review the same thing, or you can request each person cover something different. As long as it’s something they haven’t written about yet, you’re good.\n\nNominees are allowed to request a different pick for whatever reason no more than five times. Stuff happens. We all know it.\n\nNominees must thank the person who nominated them and provide a link their blog.\n\nNominees may nominate others to keep the tag going.

The Christmas Choir (2008)\n\nIt’s been years since I’ve seen The Christmas Choir. From what I remember, I enjoyed this film! The cast as a whole is strong. Quality in acting talents and screenwriting allow the characters to come across as realistic and endearing. The Christmas Choir is one of Hallmark’s more unique Christmas titles, as it doesn’t follow a formula or contain a certain set of Christmas movie tropes and cliches. In fact, it’s surprising this film isn’t a Hallmark Hall of Fame production, as the story of a choir that started in a homeless shelter seems like the perfect material for that collection of movies. Another thing I remember about The Christmas Choir is the genuine good-heartedness the film exuded. As the Christmas season is on the horizon, this may be a movie I end up revisiting!\n\n2. Hallmark Hall of Fame’s The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler (2009)\n\nI first talked about this film in my tier rank list of all the Hallmark Hall of Fame movies I’ve seen. In that list, I mentioned the film’s presentation, as the film itself felt like a theatrical release. However, that’s not the only strength The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler contains. Historical accuracy is an element that Hallmark Hall of Fame productions have, more often than not, executed well. This film is no exception, as the movie appropriately reflects the story’s time period! Movies like The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler make me wish Hallmark had created more period dramas. Yes, we have When Calls the Heart. But, to me, that feels like the exception to the rule.\n\n3. Hallmark Hall of Fame’s A Smile as Big as the Moon (2012)\n\nIf you asked me to name a “space camp” movie, A Smile as Big as the Moon is the first one that comes to mind. As I said in my aforementioned tier rank list, this film is the perfect example of what a Hall of Fame title should be. I still stand by that statement, with the movie containing so many good components! Similar to The Christmas Choir, the strong acting performances and screenwriting brought to life characters that were worth rooting for. It was also interesting to see what it takes to be enrolled in space camp. The story’s messages and themes are just as relevant today as they were in 2012 or even the late 80s, when the story takes place. A Smile as Big as the Moon is a Hallmark Hall of Fame title that I consider a classic!\n\n4. The Color of Rain (2014)\n\nIn my opinion, The Color of Rain is Lacey Chabert’s best film from Hallmark. One reason why is the story in this film is so different from those in Lacey’s other Hallmark movies. The Color of Rain does contain sadder moments, as both families are dealing with the death of a family member. But similar to films like Holly and Ivy, the movie’s creative team adopted a balance between sorrow and joy. It also helps how the cast’s acting talents were strong, as it allowed the characters to be memorable. The more I think about The Color of Rain, the more it feels like a Hallmark Hall of Fame title.\n\n5. A Godwink Christmas: Meant for Love (2019)\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed this sequel in the “Godwink” series more than the first film. A Godwink Christmas: Meant for Love does a better job at explaining and showcasing what a “Godwink” is. Like Holly and Ivy and The Color of Rain, this movie’s creative team successfully balances joy and sorrow. I also think Cindy Busby’s portrayal of Alice is one of her best performances, as it is well-rounded and contained emotionality. In a year when Hallmark premiered new films weekend after weekend, A Godwink Christmas: Meant for Love was, to me, one of their stand-outs. I may have to seek out the other two films in this series.\n\nNominations\n\nJillian from The Classic Film Connection – A Hallmark Hall of Fame movie starring at least one “classic” film star\n\nRebecca from Taking Up Room – A vampire film released after 1960\n\nEric from Diary of a Movie Maniac – A made-for-TV movie from the 1990s\n\nAndrew from The Stop Button – An underrated sports film\n\nJ-Dub from Dubsism – Another entry in the Movies Everybody Loves That I Hate series\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\nFor this Blog Follower Dedication Review, I was originally going to review some episodes of Murder, She Wrote. The two reasons for that decision were a) I haven’t reviewed Murder, She Wrote episodes since 2020 and b) I was going to offer something different for my readers and followers. But since I recently watched Woman in Gold, I chose to write about that movie instead. The 2015 film revolves around the subject of art restoration, specifically art stolen during World War II. When it comes to entertainment media, this subject seems to have received more awareness within the previous decade. Two years after the release of Woman in Gold, the Signed, Sealed, Delivered series tackled this subject in their movie; Signed, Sealed, Delivered: Home Again. In 2014, Robert M. Edsel’s book, The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History, was adapted into a film. These are just three movies, with two of them based on a true story. Think of all the other stories like these that haven’t been covered in film yet?\n\nThings I liked about the film:\n\nThe acting: Helen Mirren is an actress who has a commanding presence. While I’ve only seen a handful of her movies, the ones I have watched feature her as a lead actress or in a prominent role within an ensemble. In Woman in Gold, Helen portrays Maria, a woman desiring to reunite with a painting of her aunt. Maria was eccentric in the film. But the way she was presented in the movie was pleasant and inviting! On a trip to the airport, Randol ‘Randy’ Schoenberg and his wife are giving Maria a lift. When Randy mentions how much luggage was packed, Maria replies, nonchalantly, how they should arrive in Austria in style. Before meeting with the art museum’s archivist, Maria excitedly tells Randy how their mission is like a James Bond film, with Randy as Sean Connery. This presentation, as well as the on-screen camaraderie, made Maria someone to root for!\n\nIn my years of watching and reviewing movies, I have noticed a more successful transition of comedic actors in dramatic roles. This was Ryan Reynolds’ case in Woman in Gold. When Randy first meets Maria, the subject of her recently deceased sister is brought up. After seeing how much stuff Maria inherited from her sister, Randy jokingly remarks how she will no longer have to argue with her roommate. Remembering why Maria has her sister’s belongings, he quickly apologizes for the ill-timed joke. Even when scenes are more light-hearted, Ryan utilized his comedic acting skills. However, it never overshadowed his dramatic efforts!\n\nThe more of Daniel Brühl’s movies I see, the more I appreciate his acting talents! So, when I discovered his involvement in Woman in Gold, it piqued my interest in watching the film. Daniel portrayed Hubertus Czernin, a reporter from Austria. Because he supports the art restoration movement, Hubertus uses his resources to help Maria and Randy. The scene where these three characters are interacting for the first time showcases Daniel’s acting skills! While Hubertus is speaking about who he is and why the aforementioned movement is so important to him, you can sense how at ease Daniel is in his role. His mannerisms come across so naturally, the interaction between these three characters felt realistic. With all that said, I wish Daniel had more appearances in this film, as he was only in a handful of scenes.\n\nThe historical accuracy: As I’ve said in past reviews, an indicator of a movie’s time period is the inclusion of technology. Some parts of Woman in Gold take place in the late ‘90s. Therefore, bigger, boxier computers are shown at Randy’s law firm. Randy’s cell phone looks like one sold from around that time period, even sporting an antenna. But technology is not the only indicator of when a story takes place. A series of flashbacks show pieces of Maria’s life, including moments from around World War II. In these flashbacks, wardrobe elaborates on that story’s respective time. The World War II segments show Maria wearing sensible blouses and skirts that reach the knees. These parts of the flashbacks even show characters in tailored coats.\n\nThe legal side of art restoration: When I think of art restoration, I reflect on the process of restoring a piece to its original form. But because Woman in Gold revolves around restoring art to its original origin, the legal component is explored. A lot of well-known pieces I’m familiar with were acquired by respected museums and institutions. Therefore, I, more often than not, assumed those museums and institutions legally owned those pieces. Even if a museum or institution acquires an art piece, Randy and Maria’s story shows how difficult it is to obtain ownership of such a priceless artifact. Woman in Gold not only highlights United States law, it also addresses Austrian law. This allows the audience to witness the similarities and differences between these two legal systems.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the film:\n\nHow Randy’s grandfather was an afterthought: Throughout the story, Randy’s grandfather, a renowned composer, is brought up by various characters. Maria even claims to have crossed paths with him. Since the film primarily focuses on Maria’s efforts to reunite with her aunt’s portrait, Randy’s grandfather seems like a footnote within the overall narrative. As a viewer, I get the impression Randy deeply cared about his grandfather. A shot of Randy tearing up at a concert celebrating his grandfather’s work serves as one example of this assumption. Unfortunately, I don’t feel I learned enough about Randy’s grandfather from this story.\n\nSome rushed parts of the story: Another thing I’ve said in past reviews is how there’s only so much story you can tell within a given run-time. In the case of Woman in Gold, the movie is an hour and forty-nine minutes. Because of this and because of how long and complimented the legal process is, some parts of the story were rushed. One example was when Maria and Randy took the Austrian government to court in California. I know that any on-screen court case is going to be abbreviated for the sake of time. However, the aforementioned California case only presented the opening arguments and the end result. As someone who wanted to learn more about the legal side of art restoration, it felt like the script skipped some key elements just to get to the exciting parts of the case.\n\nWeak segues between flashbacks and “present time”: I like how the story incorporated pieces of Maria’s life through flashbacks, giving depth to the overall narrative. Unfortunately, I found the segues between these flashbacks and “present time” weak. In one scene, Maria is looking out a window. All of a sudden, a flashback begins. Several moments later, the flashback ends abruptly. Weak segues like this one caused the flow of these scenes to feel a bit choppy.\n\nMy overall impression:\n\nBefore I share my overall impression, I’d like to thank every follower of 18 Cinema Lane! I appreciate the time you’ve given to reading and engaging with my content! Now, on to my overall impression of Woman in Gold! The subject of restoring art stolen during World War II has, in the past decade, received more awareness within entertainment media. In the case of the aforementioned film, it explores the legal side of that subject. I did learn how complicated the process of art ownership can be. The movie also had its strengths, such as the acting performances and the project’s historical accuracy. But due to the film’s heavier subject matter, the re-watchability rate isn’t as strong as other films I’ve reviewed. The movie had its flaws as well, with some rushed parts of the story as one example. With all that said, Woman in Gold is a film I would recommend, especially if you’re interested in the topics brought up in this review.\n\nOverall score: 7.4 out of 10\n\nDo you see Woman in Gold? Have you seen any films about restoring art stolen during World War II? Let me know in the comment section!\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\nLast year, when I reviewed Let Him Go, it became my 275th movie review! But that wasn’t the only movie review that achieved a milestone. My recent review, Dr. Phibes Rises Again, was my 650th post! With these achievements, I decided to write a top ten list, as I haven’t published one yet. Whenever I wanted to review a particular title, I have, for the most part, been able to seek that title out. While most of them have been accessible, some of those films were harder to find. The idea of film accessibility caused me to reflect on which movies I would love to review someday. Therefore, my list of the Top 10 Movies I’d Love to Review was born! The films featured in this list are underrated/lesser known. They were also released over ten years ago. This was a conscious choice, as it keeps each entry on an equal playing field. The entries are listed based on how accessible they are. In this case, “accessibility” means whether I can legally and realistically rent, purchase, or view a film.\n\n10. A Little Romance\n\nI first saw the trailer for A Little Romance years ago on Turner Classic Movies (TCM). The movie looked so sweet and charming based on what my television screen presented. Looking back on the trailer, the story seems like a light-hearted version of Rich Kids; where two young characters go off on an adventure. This is ironic, as both Rich Kids and A Little Romance were released in 1979. I have not only found several DVD copies of A Little Romance, but I am able to rent the film. So, a review of this movie will have to be in order in the foreseeable future!\n\n9. The Lost Empire/The Monkey King\n\nSome of Bai Ling’s projects have been reviewed on 18 Cinema Lane. In fact, one of my most recent movie reviews was of her 2002 HBO film, Point of Origin. So, when I discovered Bai starred in a Hallmark movie, I knew I had to, eventually, check it out. Based on what I know about the 2001 project, the story is based on Chinese folklore. This is a very different and unique film concept from the types of movies Hallmark creates today. Similar to A Little Romance, I have found several DVD copies of The Lost Empire/The Monkey King. The full movie is available on Youtube as well.\n\n8. Alex: The Life of a Child\n\nLong before 18 Cinema Lane came along, I had learned of Alexandra Deford’s story. After reading Alex: The Life of a Child, I wanted to see its respective adaptation. For the longest time, a twelve-dollar donation to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation was the only way to receive a VHS copy of the movie. But if you visit the non-profit’s website, there is no mention of the film or how to acquire a copy of it. Fortunately, the full movie has been posted on Youtube. So, expect a review of Alex: The Life of a Child in the near future!\n\n7. A Circle of Children and Lovey: A Circle of Children Part II\n\nOne of Judy Garland’s movies I like is A Child Is Waiting. For those who aren’t familiar with the 1963 title, Judy portrays a music teacher who works at a school for students with special needs. A decade after the release of A Child Is Waiting, two made-for-tv films, A Circle of Children and Lovey: A Circle of Children Part II, aired. Unlike Judy’s movie, the aforementioned productions are based on the true story of a teacher named Mary MacCracken. Her books were not only the source material for these movies, Mary was also one of the screenwriters for both films. While I haven’t found a physical copy of either movie, A Circle of Children and Lovey: A Circle of Children Part II have been uploaded on Youtube. With everything said, these titles could serve a future double feature!\n\n6. Hallmark Hall of Fame’s Redwood Curtain and The Flamingo Rising\n\nI’ve said before on 18 Cinema Lane how some Hallmark Hall of Fame titles were only sold on VHS. This exclusivity has encouraged me to seek them out. Even though I’d like to see as many of those films as realistically possible, Redwood Curtain and The Flamingo Rising are at the top of my wish list! Each synopsis sounds interesting and Asian/Asian American stories are far and few between in the Hallmark Hall of Fame collection. As of late June 2022, both Redwood Curtain and The Flamingo Rising are available on Hallmark’s streaming service, Hallmark Movies Now. I have also found some copies on VHS.\n\n5. An Old Fashioned Christmas\n\nI have gone on record to state An Old Fashioned Thanksgiving as one of my favorite Hallmark films. Two years after that movie’s release, Hallmark aired a sequel titled An Old Fashioned Christmas. This is one of Hallmark’s unique Christmas offerings, as it is a period drama. The story also takes place in and was filmed in Ireland. I have come across a few DVD copies of An Old Fashioned Christmas. However, these copies were included in Christmas movie box sets, which have been, more often than not, expensive. The 2010 film has an official page on Hallmark Drama’s website. But the movie isn’t scheduled for any upcoming presentations. Hopefully, when Christmas time rolls around, An Old Fashioned Christmas will appear among the network’s selection of seasonal titles.\n\n4. She Couldn’t Say No\n\nThis 1953 comedy starring Jean Simmons and Robert Mitchum was originally recommended to me by one of my readers. Since then, I have been trying to find a way to, legally and realistically, watch the movie. No VHS tapes or DVDs of this title have been attainable, as of late June 2022. She Couldn’t Say No has also not been posted on Youtube. Similar to An Old Fashioned Christmas, the 1953 movie does have an official page on Turner Classic Movies’ website. But it doesn’t look like the movie will air on the channel anytime soon. The only option I have left is to wait for the Youtube channel, Cult Cinema Classics, to upload the movie.\n\n3. Oliver 2: Let’s Twist Again\n\nWhile looking for a title to review for the upcoming Other Than A Bond Girl Blogathon, I came across this project on Diana Rigg’s IMDB filmography. As soon as I read the title, it gave off Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo vibes. Because of that, I thought I had finally found my “so bad, it’s good” movie. But I discovered Oliver 2: Let’s Twist Again is a “Dickens spoof broadcast as part of the BBC’s 1995 “Comic Relief” telethon”. As someone who enjoyed the 1968 musical, Oliver!, I am curious to see what an Oliver Twist sequel would look like. But as of the publication of this list, there have been no uploads on Youtube of Oliver 2: Let’s Twist Again. For now, it would be considered “lost media”.\n\n2. The Tim Pope Cut of The Crow: City of Angels\n\nI won’t talk about this entry too much, as I’ve already talked about it in depth in my editorial, Why Now is the Perfect Time to Release the Tim Pope Cut of ‘The Crow: City of Angels’. Personally, I’d consider the Tim Pope Cut a “partial lost film”. The film itself isn’t lost, but this version of it is. Since publishing my aforementioned editorial, it has garnered over a thousand views and counting! This tells me there’s a desire to find and restore the Tim Pope Cut. But, as of late June 2022, this version of the movie hasn’t been restored. For now, all there is to do is wait and “trust the timing”.\n\n1. Four Devils\n\nFor those not familiar with this title, Four Devils is a 1928 project that is considered one of the most infamous lost films. The movie revolves around four siblings who form a circus act called the “four devils”. I don’t always receive an opportunity to review films from the 1920s. Therefore, writing about Four Devils would provide unique and intriguing content for my readers. Like I said about the Tim Pope Cut of The Crow: City of Angels, there has been no recent development in the retrieval of Four Devils. In the meantime, I guess I’ll find the book this movie is based on and read that.\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\nWhen the subject of “disaster films” is brought up, one will usually think of films revolving around over-exaggerated, fictionalized disasters. Whether it’s Sharknado or The Day After Tomorrow, these types of titles have become the faces of the “disaster film” category. But what if a movie depicts a real-life disaster that could be experienced by anyone? This is the case of my Disaster Blog-a-Thon entry, Point of Origin. Last month, I searched on Wikipedia for a title to review for May’s Genre Grandeur. During that search, I stumbled across the aforementioned 2002 HBO production. After reading the film was a “fact-based drama about an arson investigator searching for the perpetrator of a string of deadly fires in 1980s California”, I knew it was the perfect choice for J-Dub and Pale Writer’s event! Before I start this review, I would like to point out how this marks two firsts for 18 Cinema Lane. Not only is this my first time participating in the Disaster Blog-a-Thon, this is also the first HBO film reviewed on my blog!\n\nThings I liked about the film:\n\nThe mystery: For the most part, the mystery in Point of Origin allowed the audience to experience it alongside the characters. What also helps is how the mystery started right at the beginning of the film. This immediately hooked the audience into the story, while also giving them a shared journey with the key players on screen. There was room for viewers to speculate what would happen in the story. That gave them the opportunity to interact with the film’s mystery. Three separate components played a role in the overarching narrative. While I won’t give anything away, it was interesting to see these components come together.\n\nThe special effects: When John was investigating a crime scene, he would attempt to figure out how the fire started. Toward the beginning of the film, this thought process was visualized through special effects. As John is recounting the information, the actual fire is played out in reverse on screen. This is very different from other mystery movies, as flashbacks might be utilized to speculate the cause of a crime. When it came to the fires themselves, it appeared as if they actually took place in a given scene. It may have been possible for the movie’s creative team to insert footage of fires through editing or CGI, as Point of Origin was released in 2002. However, practical effects were an interesting choice. This creative decision reminded me of productions like The Crow.\n\nShowcasing the dangers of fire: While investigating a local fire, John and his co-worker, Keith, examine a young boy who died on the crime scene. Despite only the victim’s face being shown, it is blackened due to smoke and flame exposure. Later in the film, John visits a surviving burn victim in the hospital. The victim’s face and part of his hand are covered in burns. He even claims that it hurts to open his eyes. Due to the nature of Point of Origin, the story is heavier in tone. However, the incorporation of the dangers of fire never felt like they were there for “shock value” or as a tactic to scare the audience. If anything, it was shown just enough to get the point across.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the film:\n\nBai Ling’s limited presence: Bai Ling was cast as John’s wife, Wanda Orr, in the 2002 HBO film. Her involvement in Point of Origin is one of the reasons why I sought out this movie, as she is the top billed actress. When I watched the film, however, I discovered Bai appeared in only a handful of scenes. Compared to some of Bai’s other projects, her talents were under-utilized in Point of Origin. It also seems like the main supporting actress, Illeana Douglas, received more screen-time than Bai. Bai did a good job with the acting material she was given. But this situation is very reminiscent of Katharine Hepburn’s involvement in 1994’s One Christmas, where Katharine appeared in about five scenes despite being that film’s top billed actor.\n\nA confusing time period: As I mentioned in the introduction, Point of Origin takes place in the 1980s. Elements from that decade were incorporated into the film, such as vehicles and a typewriter used by John at various moments in the story. Meanwhile, Bai’s wardrobe looked like it came straight from the early 2000s. There was also a scene where a store patron tells another patron not to smoke in the store. This attitude was more prevalent in the 2000s, as smoking in public places was more accepted in the 1980s. The inconsistency with the film’s historical accuracy was so confusing, it was, on a few occasions, distracting.\n\nAn unidentified red-haired man: Throughout the movie, a red-haired man made multiple appearances. I won’t spoil the movie for anyone who hasn’t seen it. But I will say when everything was said and done, I don’t feel like I received a satisfying explanation of who that character is. Yes, I can assume the red-haired man’s identity. However, when it comes to that character, the movie was building up to something without providing a pay-off.\n\nMy overall impression:\n\nFor the Disaster Blog-a-Thon, I chose to talk about a film that revolved around a real-life disaster. This is because, in my opinion, these types of titles aren’t talked about as much within the realm of “disaster films”. When it comes to Point of Origin specifically, it was a fine, competently made, intriguing movie. But the 2002 HBO project made me feel similarly to Red Corner. This is ironic, as Bai Ling was cast as the lead actress in both films. What I mean by my aforementioned statement is I held higher expectations for each film, only to be somewhat let down by them. As I’ve said before on 18 Cinema Lane, the historical accuracy works when the creative team places emphasis on the details. In Point of Origin, however, it seems like the film’s creative team forgot, at times, their project took place in the 1980s. This is because some aspects of the film reflected the time of the film’s release; the early 2000s. I haven’t seen a lot of HBO films, so I can’t make any comparisons with Point of Origin. But I will say, based on other made-for-TV mystery productions, this one felt closer to the middle of the road.\n\nOverall score: 7.2 out of 10\n\nHave you seen Point of Origin? Are there any HBO films you’d like to see reviewed on 18 Cinema Lane? Please let me know in the comment section!\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen"
