The primary focus of the NPS, however, is on commercial filming that has the potential to impact park resources and visitors beyond what occurs from normal visitor use of park areas. Examples of this type of filming are productions that use substantial equipment such as sets and lighting, productions with crews and personnel that exceed 5 people, and filming in closed areas, wilderness areas, or in locations that would create conflicts with other visitors or harm sensitive resources.\n\nAll filmers, no matter the size, must comply with all rules that apply in park areas, just like other visitors.\n\nIf Iâ€™m a social media influencer, do I need a permit?\n\nFederal law requires a permit for all commercial filming, no matter the size of the crew or the type of equipment.

Barr had no impact on how the National Park Service regulates still photography, so there are no changes in how the National Park Service regulates that activity. Still photographers require a permit only when:\n\nthe activity takes place at location(s) where or when members of the public are generally not allowed; or\n\nthe activity uses model(s), sets(s), or prop(s) that are not a part of the location's natural or cultural resources or administrative facilities; or\n\na park would incur additional administrative costs to monitor the activity\n\nWhat fees will I have to pay?\n\nThe National Park Service will collect a cost recovery charge and a location fee for still photography permits.
