        "text": "For hours today, I hold\n\nthe sweet weight\n\nof ripe peaches\n\nin my palm, and\n\nwith the other hand,\n\nI slice into the fruit,\n\nthe golden juice streaming\n\nbetween my fingers,\n\nsticky, delicious,\n\nbefore I drop the slices\n\ninto the bags for the freezer.\n\nWhat is it in the body\n\nthat knows to gather\n\nwhat is ripe and preserve it\n\nfor a time in the future\n\nwhen the world is barren?\n\nI have tried to do this\n\nwith love. Sometimes,\n\nmidwinter, I pull out\n\na memory. I swear\n\nsometimes it’s even\n\nsweeter, but sometimes\n\nit leaves me\n\nravenous.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAll around me, the world\n\nwas normal—people eating dinner\n\nor walking down the street—\n\nbut my world?\n\nSome massive, invisible hand\n\nkept capturing me, then\n\ntossing me into the air.\n\nAnd I’d somersault\n\nand fall and be caught,\n\nthen placed upright again\n\non the ground. All night\n\nit went on like this.\n\nI’d be walking and then\n\nI’d be flying and then\n\nI’d be falling and then\n\nI’d be caught, until finally,\n\nby morning, we couldn’t say\n\nthat it wasn’t disconcerting,\n\nbut we could say I\n\nhad become more fluent\n\nin this strange upheaval.\n\nWe could say I\n\nhad begun to trust\n\nthe same hand that tossed me\n\nwould catch me.\n\nWe could say that when\n\nI woke up, I was still myself\n\nand nothing felt the same.\n\nAnd though my feet\n\nnever left the ground today,\n\nI was tossed.\n\nAnd then I was caught.\n\nEven now, I almost feel them\n\naround my chest,\n\nthose great fingers\n\nas they set me on my feet again.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nfor D.B.F.\n\nThe white and blue folds of her sweater.\n\nThe hand of her daughter on her shoulder.\n\nThe rain.\n\nThe cancer blossoming in her brain.\n\nThe story of when she did dishes for the dying woman.\n\nThis dying woman in the home she just built.\n\nThe glasses lifted high for a champagne toast.\n\nThe medicine waiting for tomorrow.\n\nThe snapdragons on the table not yet starting to droop.\n\nThe song we have sung with her for thirty years.\n\nThe tears.\n\nThe missing harmony where her voice would be.\n\nThe smile on her face as if nothing was missing.\n\nAs if nothing was lacking.\n\nAs if she was opening the gate\n\nand showing us this, this is the way to walk through.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBowing at the Feet of the Ordinary\n\nMay I remember this day\n\nwith its two-hundred twenty two\n\nmiles of pavement and my\n\ndaughter beside me and both\n\nof us singing her favorite songs.\n\nRemember this day not because\n\nit was special but because\n\nit was the way it always is,\n\nwith us laughing and talking\n\nand sitting in easy silence.\n\nWith a stop at the car wash\n\nand her grumbling about vacuuming,\n\nthen doing it anyway. With\n\na stop at the coffee shop\n\nand me grumbling about\n\ncake pops, then buying one\n\nanyway. With the sweetness\n\nof ripe Cresthaven peaches\n\nwe bought at the roadside stand—\n\nhow the juice dripped down our chins.\n\nWith the rich green of late summer\n\na blur out the window. The day\n\nso infused with commonplace\n\nlove I never once doubted\n\nI belonged with my girl, in that car,\n\nin the world, in the universe,\n\nthe days getting shorter\n\nbut still so luminous, so warm.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nlistening to Trio Duende play Allegro con Brio, from Piano Trio 1 in B Major\n\nOnce, on a rainy night, I sat in the home\n\nof a family I did not know and listened\n\nto a trio playing Brahms. Though\n\nit is only hours later, I unwrap\n\nthe memory as if it is tied with silk ribbons\n\nand wrapped in gold tissue—something\n\nprecious as a time-smoothed stone\n\non the banks of a slender river. Unlike\n\na museum piece, this memory wants\n\nto be opened, to be held, to be touched,\n\nto be cradled by bare hands. Wants\n\nmy finger prints all over it—\n\nthe memory of how beauty swells in us\n\nand then breaks us, breaks us\n\nthe way the piano itself broke apart tonight—\n\nthe pedal rods clattering to the ground\n\nmid-movement. Beauty bids us play on\n\nas the pianist did tonight. Play on.\n\nThough broken. Though we know\n\nthe work eventually ends in a minor key.\n\nPlay on, as if we trust the line of beauty\n\nwill not be broken. No matter how intense\n\nit gets. Even if the world explodes.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nafter “Pleasure” by Rick Barot\n\nIt was a garden, they said,\n\nwith an apple tree and one\n\nman and one woman,\n\nalways blissful.\n\nAnd while I don’t doubt\n\nthis, too, is paradise,\n\nI know well the paradise\n\nwhen one woman is alone\n\nin the garden pulling up\n\nbindweed by the roots,\n\nknowing she’ll never get it all.\n\nAnd somehow there is pleasure\n\nin the endless pulling.\n\nI know the paradise\n\nwhen fifty-thousand people\n\nsing together a song\n\nabout heartbreak.\n\nAnd the paradise of a lover’s\n\narms when I’m weeping\n\nis somehow even more paradisical\n\nthan when the world feels easy.\n\nI’m not saying I want\n\nthings to go wrong.\n\nI, too, pray for peace.\n\nBut I know now that pain\n\ndoes not preclude paradise.\n\nThe bruised apple\n\nmakes a sweet sauce.\n\nThe arm that aches\n\nstill holds the beloved child.\n\nAnd after a fire,\n\nthe world grows back\n\nwith such startling green.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
