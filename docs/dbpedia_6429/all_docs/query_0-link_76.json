        "text": "ENTRIES IN PART 4:\n\nLauren Carroll Harris\n\nWriter, artist and broadcaster on RN’s The Screen Show, contributor to The Saturday Paper, The Baffler and Cineaste\n\nPhantom Thread (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2017)\n\nA most perverse and controlled love story. I’ve always felt that Paul Thomas Anderson has some deep-down understanding of what binds groups of people and relationships; here, with Daniel Day Lewis, Vicky Krieps and Jonny Greenwood, he reaches a new pinnacle of psychological insight about coupledom.\n\nThe Other Side of the Wind, Orson Welles (1975-2018)\n\nOrson Welles’ exquisite formal innovations continue even in his afterlife: here, slipping into montage and gliding deep into autobiography and faux-documentary as he returns to his canonical themes of artistic identity, self-mythology and creative legacy.\n\nBisbee 17 (Robert Greene, 2018)\n\nNon-fiction cinema at its most dynamic, which takes a violent anti-union protest in desert USA as its unresolved subject. We confront the past by looking at it head-on, which could be this film’s very mandate.\n\n★ (Johann Lurf, 2017)\n\nJohann Lurf sheds himself of the gravity of conventional narrative form and planet Earth itself, with a beautifully calming supercut of cinematic skyscapes that has the atmosphere of other, unknowable worlds.\n\nFirst Reformed (Paul Schrader, 2017)\n\nTo speak of this film’s surface themes – doubt in institutional religion, existential terror in the face of ecological collapse – seems reductive. Once again, Paul Schrader goes beyond the politics and circumstances of the day, eventually departing from realism for some other realm of the spirit.\n\nBlack Panther (Ryan Coogler, 2018)\n\nOne of the few exemptions to the decline of the Hollywood action blockbuster, Black Panther and its radical politics rise up through the Marvel sludge with a hard-driving soundtrack curated from the African diaspora by Kendrick Lamar.\n\nBlacKkKlansman (Spike Lee, 2018)\n\nLee’s experimental, commercial art film toggles between genres in unexpected ways, eventually and stunningly jolting into documentary – with all the shock of the present political lurch to the far-right – with news footage sourced from the USA’s Charlottesville crisis.\n\nGood Luck (Ben Russell, 2017)\n\nSlow cinema and immersive documentary careen toward one another in Good Luck, a double collective portrait of two mining communities, continents apart. The opening scene is a perfectly formed video artwork in and of itself.\n\nAmerica (Erick Stohl and Chase Whiteside, 2018)\n\nA paradox: how can a documentary forged of the banality of the everyday, the family, the poverty of the developing world, the relentlessness of age – be suffused with such cinematic poetry? A most humble, beautiful, humane documentary by outsiders to a poor, marginalised family confronting their grand-matriarch’s illness in Mexico.\n\nStrange Colours (Alena Lodkina, 2017)\n\nA rare debut that says, yes, this filmmaker will go onto make a body of deeply felt work. Lodkina’s desert film – of alienated men and daughters – operates on a metaphorical, audiovisual level not seen in many Australian films at the minute.\n\nZama (Lucretia Martel, 2018)\n\nZama lingers – the tropical heat, the seeping madness, the Kafka-esque bureaucratic run-arounds, and not the least, Martel’s contained formalism that gradually gives way to the complete and senseless despair of an irrelevant colonial official at the forging of a now-failing project: modernity.\n\nCan You Ever Forgive Me? (Marielle Heller, 2018)\n\nWhat appears as a normcore biopic gives way to a melancholy, wholly realised portrait of loneliness and the romance of friendship, as two queer outcasts bond together, and almost break apart, in careless 1980s New York City.\n\nAndy Hazel\n\nEditorial assistant at The Saturday Paper and producer and host of the podcasts Cultural Capital and Twin Peaks the Return\n\nIf 2018 was about anything it was about chaos. Every sense we have for cinema was overloaded with stimuli, politics, social causes, environmental catastrophes, personal traumas made public and public traumas dealt with privately. As a viewer, consumer or critic, we can choose to find solace in a slow-moving film from an auteur director in which everything on the screen and the soundtrack offers a disarming balm to our minds, a blockbuster that will allow us to briefly feel in the moment along with millions of other people, or we can seek to engage with the chaos, with a filmmaker who uses emotion to find order. I took all three of these options in 2018, but it’s the latter that left the biggest impact on me, which is why my film of the year, as of early December, is Nadine Labaki’s divisive Capharnaum.\n\nThe story of 12-year-old Zain trying to assert his sense of humanity and justice to first, protect young sister from being sold into marriage, then to care for the infant Yonas after his mother is deported, is a sprawling chaotic manipulative film. It’s far from faultless and accusations of Labaki being a clumsy exploiter of emotions, of her needlessly confuse the story by beginning the film with Zain’s efforts to use the courtroom to stop his parents from having any more children, the scarcely credible climax, and the folly casting herself as Zain’s lawyer all have merit.\n\nCapharnaum is shot in the messy sprawl of Beirut and features a cast of thousands, but like another emotionally harrowing, sprawling film about finding a sense of justice in a very unequal world, Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, Labaki is happy to let chaos unfold and for her camera to follow. She lets Zain’s perilous journey for survival drive the film through the crowds and rubble and lawlessness of the city. A film made about justice in poverty should be messy and fraught with thorny questions about authorship, and most films that tackle this subject could probably use another edit, but in the case of Capharnaum, the child’s-eye view of the chaos and the exhaustion at the journey to survive feels pure. A neorealist triumph in a year where that felt like the last thing that could connect or unify an audience increasingly lost in a customised news and social bubble. Labaki’s vision is sure even if the energy bursting from the frame gets unruly. It’s a case of the right story being told by the right filmmaker at the right time.\n\n1.

Many independent and foreign films tend to get released months and sometimes years after their festival debuts. Therefore I’ve limited this list to films that premiered theatrically in the United States in 2018, with the exception of one phenomenal movie that was banished to the world of streaming only after premiering at Sundance. I couldn’t help but include it.\n\n1. Zama (Lucrecia Martel, 2017)\n\n2. Lean on Pete (Andrew Haigh, 2017)\n\n3. El Mar la Mar (J.P. Sniadecki, Joshua Bonnetta, 2017)\n\n4.

Here are my top cinematic experiences of 2018.\n\nLa Coquille et le Clergyman (The Seashell and the Clergyman, Germaine Dulac, 1928) UCLA Billy Wilder Theater\n\nProvocative imagery, subversive, a fragmented visual style. Dulac was a disrupter far beyond her years.\n\nSaving Brinton (Tommy Haines & Andrew Sherburne, 2017) Santa Monica Lamelle\n\nAn absorbing documentary of Michael Zah’s quest to save a rare film collection and the struggle in keeping history alive. An absolute must see if you’re a nerd for film preservation, historian, and lover of lost films. I came very close to meeting this man in person.\n\nViva (Anna Biller, 2007) Loyola Mount Marymount University\n\nLittle did I know during the screening, I was sitting next to two actors from The Love Witch, which Anna Biller had to point out during her Q&A after the showing. I was a deer in headlights. Viva delivers a refined look into the sexual revolution from a homemaker’s perspective and through her experience delivers a personal revelation. Biller is a cinematic goddess.\n\nCzłowiek z marmuru (Man Of Marble, Andrzej Wajda, 1977) Armer Theater, Cal State Northridge\n\nThe opening sequence had so much gumption, and the music really gives it an extra kick. Andrzej Wajda’s storytelling of a bricklayer in Poland while simultaneously a documentarian’s perseverance to tell his story has a very delightful meta feel to it. Historical 70’s in Poland, I love it.\n\nSuspiria (Luca Guadagnino, 2018) AMC Century City\n\nMy favorite horror film of 2018. The most harrowing aesthetic is its subversive tone and sound design going beyond the confines of what the original story had done. Depth, ingenuity, and bloody violent.\n\nBlackkklansman (Spike Lee, 2018) Pasadena Lamelle\n\nRealizing the day I watched this film was the one-year anniversary of Heather Heyer’s tragic death in the Charlottesville attack to which the film is dedicated to. It’s a polarizing, yet formidable look into the destructive American facade unraveling its relentless history attributing certain pieces of cinema from the past baring witness to its own atrocities.\n\nThe Other Side of the Wind (Orson Welles, 2018) North Hollywood Laemmle\n\nFelt like ZABRISKIE POINT meets Shakespeare opening a time capsule of the tumultuous 70s era while dissecting the complex business of filmmaking. I feel like it’s Welles’ magnum opus and those who resurrected and took this film to the finish line, thank you!\n\nRoma (Alfonso Cuarón, 2018) North Hollywood Laemmle\n\nDifficult at times, demanding your patience but also the black and white is a contrast to a vivid childhood memory film. Personal and heartbreaking and beloved who share sentiments to such a past. Something about it reminds me of a stark painting that makes you confront something you may not necessarily want to.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick, 1968) Arclight, Hollywood\n\nI’ve been waiting my whole cinephile life to witness this with my mind, body, and soul. And in 70mm print. Historic gold.\n\nHereditary (Ari Aster, 2018) North Hollywood Laemmle\n\nDecadent slice of horror bordering with the clash of hilarity and nervous bewilderment. Sinister hell fire, perhaps a cult classic for decades to come.\n\nThe Guest (Pearl Bowser,1977) Portland, Oregon\n\nI was fortunate enough to attend the AMIA conference in Portland this year which is where film archivists share and celebrate their finds. Being a baby in this arena it opened my eyes to a bigger world of possibility. Pearl Bowser, an African American cinema pioneer had a peculiar style but I enjoyed learning about her work.\n\nAlain Hertay\n\nTeaches cinema studies at the Haute Ecole de la Province de Liège, Belgium.

Leto (Summer, Kirill Serebrennikov, 2018)\n\nIs there anything left to say about Roma? There are a number of films in any given year that are made with as much technical precision, but where films like Nelyubov (Loveless, Andrey Zvyagintsev, 2017) or Zimna wojna (Cold War, Pawel Pawlikowski, 2018) felt schematic and lifeless, Roma was an often thrilling and nearly always jaw-dropping work. This, I hope, is no capricious value judgement: if I can pinpoint the difference, it’s that Loveless and Cold War, along with many other A-grade festival films, never seem liberated from their metaphors and synoptic skeletons, whereas Cuarón’s film mesmerised me throughout, in its emotional resonance as much as its formal ambition. Roma, ironically, belongs to a genre that is perhaps more susceptible than any other to overbearing narrative – the “true story” – but, in his obsessive recreation of places and individuals, Cuarón manages to construct something like life: intricate and disjointed, open-ended and quotidian, even in its most dramatic moments.\n\nA much smaller-scale film but as much of a revelation was young Australian auteur Georgia Temple’s Grace, Who Waits Alone, which Bill Mousoulis screened as part of his touring Australian New Wave showcase. Previously shown at the 2017 Queensland Film Festival, Temple’s debut feature is a beautifully minimalist and highly accomplished work that evokes Chantal Akerman’s early, personal films such as Je, tu, il, elle (1974) and News from Home (1977) in its intimacy – Temple acts as well as handling most technical responsibilities, shooting in locations as mundane as a house, a supermarket and a car park while confining dialogue to poetic voiceover – and, notably, its brilliant sound design. I’ve long wondered if there was a place for a cinema as radical as Akerman’s in Australia, and Grace, Who Waits Alone offers a resounding yes. Such cinema may never have large-scale commercial success, but I urge readers to check out this (as well as the other works in Mousoulis’ series) if they get the opportunity.\n\nA somewhat “bigger” – but no less artistically ambitious – film in terms of its scale and reach was Alena Lodkina’s Strange Colours, a sophisticated and wholly refreshing examination of rural Australian masculinity and emotional isolation that also had space to breathe. Lodkina, too, has written of the special place Akerman (and, particularly, Je, tu, il, elle) had in her development as a filmmaker; if these two works are anything to go by, then we can begin to hope that our much-maligned national cinema is finally shedding some of its self-consciousness and heading in a refreshingly radical direction.\n\nAnd it’s not just minimalism that gets my heart racing: Yann Gonzalez’s gay-porn serial-killer movie Knife + Heart was thrillingly flamboyant and idiosyncratic, as good as if not better than anything Pedro Almodóvar made in the ‘80s; Josephine Decker’s Madeline’s Madeline was the best-edited film I have seen in a long time; and Jean-Luc Godard’s The Image Book was, if nothing else, the most fun video essay of 2018.\n\nBest repertory screenings\n\nWhile Melbourne Cinémathèque had another terrific year – highlighting the work of, among others, Věra Chytilová, Jeanne Moreau and Dušan Makavejev – my personal highlight was ACMI’s Alice Is Everywhere film program, held over May and June in conjunction with their Wonderland exhibition. This season, curated by Audrey Lam, Keegan O’Connor and Strange Colours director Lodkina, made a strong case for the importance of Lewis Carroll’s seminal surrealist text on cinema, taking in films as brilliant and imaginative as Něco z Alenky (Alice, Jan Švankmajer, 1988), Valerie a týden divů (Valerie and Her Week of Wonders, Jaromil Jireš, 1970) and the film that I perhaps cherish more than any other, Céline et Julie vont en bateau (Celine and Julie Go Boating, Jacques Rivette, 1974). To see the last of these on the big screen for the first time was a (literally?) magical experience, and one I’ll never forget.\n\nBest DVD releases\n\nL’ange (The Angel, Patrick Bokanowski, 1982) (Re:voir)\n\nL’enfant secret (The Secret Son, Philippe Garrel, 1979) (Re:voir)\n\nIngmar Bergman’s Cinema (Criterion Collection)\n\nThe Nun (Corin Hardy, 2018) (Studio Canal)\n\nIt seems churlish to complain about a set as expansive and essential as Criterion’s Bergman survey, but I did find myself missing the handful of features that were left out (I could reluctantly accept the exclusion of the disowned and frankly not particularly good This Can’t Happen Here, but the absence of works as essential as Prison and Face to Face was unfortunate), and it would have been nice for at least a few of the director’s hard-to-find TV productions to be included as extras, even if in substandard audiovisual quality. Of course, it’s no easy feat to gain the rights for a filmmaker’s full oeuvre, and that’s why the Bergman set remains a must-have and a beautiful thing for what it is. In the meantime, the Potemkine Éric Rohmer box set must, it seems, remain the unattainable standard for such endeavours.\n\nFinally, speaking of French labels, Re:voir had another wonderful year of releases, bookended by two cinematic treasures: Patrick Bokanowski’s L’ange (1982) and Philippe Garrel’s L’enfant secret (1979), one of a number of previously unreleased Garrel titles that the company has recently brought out. In a liminal period for film distribution in which many great films still lie dormant in archives, there is a cherished place for dedicated small-time distributors like Re:voir that make such effectively buried work available to the public.\n\nLEE HILL\n\nAUTHOR OF A GRAND GUY: THE ART AND LIFE OF TERRY SOUTHERN\n\nBests\n\nThe Phantom Thread (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2018)\n\nThe Other Side of the Wind (Orson Welles, 2018)\n\nFirst Man (Damien Chazelle, 2018)\n\nThe Post (Steven Spielberg, 2017)\n\nHereditary (Ari Aster, 2018)\n\nZimna Wojna (Cold War, Pawel Pawlikowski, 2018)\n\nStudio 54 (Matt Tyrnauer, 2018)\n\nA Cambodian Spring (Christopher Kelly, 2016)\n\nA Ciambra (Jonas Carpignano, 2017)\n\nKona fer í stríð (Woman at War, Benedikt Erlingsson, 2017)\n\nDoubles vies (Non-Fiction, Oliver Assayas, 2018)\n\nVox Lux (Brady Corbet, 2018)\n\nBeoning (Burning, Lee Chang-dong, 2018)\n\nRunners-Up, Honourable Mentions and Not So Guilty Pleasures\n\nThe Favourite (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2018), Sicario 2: Day of the Soldado (Stefano Sollima, 2018), Mission: Impossible – Fallout (Christopher McQuarrie, 2018), Bergman – ett år, ett liv (Bergman: A Year in the Life, Jane Magnusson, 2018), Gholam (Mitra Tabrizian, 2018), A Gentle Creature (Sergei Losznita, 2017), Aus dem Nichts (In The Fade, Faith Akin, 2017), First Reformed (Paul Schrader, 2018), Destroyer (Karyn Kusama, 2018), The Square (Ruben Ostland, 2017), The Heiresses (Marcelo Martinessi, 2018), Black Klansman (Spike Lee, 2018), Un Couteau Dans le Coeur (Heart + Knife, Yann Gonzalez, 2018), and; Jiāng hú ér nǚ (Ash is The Purest White, Jia Zhang-ke, 2018)\n\nThe Far Side of Paradise\n\nReady Player One (Steven Spielberg, 2018), Napszállta, (Sunset, Laszlo Nemes, 2018) and Suspiria (Luca Guadagnino, 2018)\n\nReissues\n\nBerorlingen (The Touch, Ingmar Bergman, 1971), Die Büchse der Pandora (Pandora’s Box, FW Murnau, 1929), Laughter in the Dark (Tony Richardson, 1969), 2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick, 1968), The Passenger (Michelaneglo Antonioni, 1975), Yellow Submarine (George Dunning, 1968), L’Orphee (Orpheus, Jean Cocteau, 1950), The Last Movie (Dennis Hopper, 1971) and 7th Heaven (Frank Borzage, 1927)\n\nWorsts\n\nThe Children’s Act (Richard Eyre, 2018), In Fabric (Peter Strickland, 2018), Out of Blue (Carol Morley, 2018), The Mercy (James Marsh, 2018), Happy New Year, Colin Burstead (Ben Wheatley, 2018), and; Mansfield 66/67 (P.

With respect to the latter, Danny Boyle, Bond film bridesmaid, did get his mojo back as the man behind the picaresque docu-drama, Trust, which was a lot more fun than a good half of Ridley Scott’s recent output (the maligned film maudit, The Counsellor, excepted). On a sadder note, the passing of two giants of my film going youth, Nicolas Roeg and Bernardo Bertolucci, within days may have put the more Stalinist aspects of the MeToo movement in bold relief, but the ambition and grandeur of Bad Timing, The Conformist and yes, Last Tango, et al. will transcend the carping in time. The rest of this list can speak for itself, but I predict a Netflix 2.0 might one day restore A Rainy Day in New York (Woody Allen Project 2017) with a companion making of doc by Louis CK.\n\nLili Hinstin\n\nArtistic Director Locarno Film Festival\n\nPossibly in no particular order\n\nLe Livre d’image (The Image Book, Jean-Luc Godard, 2018)\n\nMi aporte (My Contribution, Sara Gómez, 1969)\n\nAmin (Philippe Faucon, 2018)\n\nThe Kamagasaki Cauldron War (Leo Sato, 2018)\n\nM (Yolande Zauberman, 2018)\n\nClassified People (Yolande Zauberman, 1989)\n\nFest (Nikita Diakur, 2018)\n\nTemporada (Season, André Novais Oliveira, 2018)\n\n“Îmi este indiferent daca în istorie vom intra ca barbari” (“I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians”, Radu Jude, 2018)\n\nLazzaro felice (Happy as Lazzaro, Alice Rohrwacher, 2018)\n\nRay & Liz (Richard Billingham, 2018)\n\nGrass (Hong Sang-soo, Korea, 2018) (haven’t seen Gangbyun Hotel yet)\n\nReza (Alireza Motamedi, 2018)\n\nClassical Period (Ted Fendt, 2018)\n\nJytte Holmqvist\n\nPassionate about movies from all over the world and an avid film festival goer\n\nA casa tutti bene (There Is No Place Like Home, Gabriele Muccino, 2018)\n\nThis family drama develops like a Greek tragedy and reminds of Polanski’s Carnage (2006). In Muccino’s film initial harmony is replaced by crisis, chaos and catharsis when characters are forced to re-evaluate past and present. Set on Ischia, the external environment becomes a character in its own right when couples clash and the rugged island reflects the darkened mood of the characters. As collective and individual harmony crumbles, out come multifaceted and troubled personalities and internal stability is tested.\n\nBalentes (The Brave Ones, Lisa Camillo, 2018)\n\nBalentes speaks of a ravaged Sardinia ̶ once a prosperous 1960s idyll under the influence of Prince Aga Khan but since used as military testing ground. Exposed to harmful toxic waste, some Sardinians stand strong in the face of adversity, opening up to the media. Whistle-blower Camillo interviews people instrumental to her story, using real footage. Through her timely film we learn of socio-political injustices which need urgent addressing.\n\nLoro (Paolo Sorrentino, 2018)\n\nIn Loro, Sorrentino represents an Italian icon: Sergio Berlusconi ̶ a politician who reached both fame and notoriety. Toni Servillo’s character encapsulates the essence of the long-reigning prime minister; a man who was a law unto himself, both revered and detested. Sorrentino presents us with carefully orchestrated mass scenes where youths sway their hips to pumping music during gigantic parties arranged by Berlusconi ̶ his politics played down in favour of materialistic hype and glamour. The film delights and shocks at once and the viewer is dazed by the experience; subjected to loud images, loud music and a loud main character with a plastic face – Servillo a spitting image of the real Berlusconi.\n\nLazzaro felice (Happy as Lazzaro, Alice Rohrwacher, 2018)\n\nLazzaro felice spans across time and space and takes us on a journey first through the Italian countryside, then into a surreal landscape seemingly separate from reality. Rohrwacher uses Christian symbolism when main character Lazzaro takes on an almost Christlike appearance in an apocalyptic scene at the end. Also exploring animal symbolism, this film is an ambitious undertaking which leaves the viewer with new images and impressions; pondering the journey they’ve been taken on and its many unconventional twists and turns.\n\nDogman (Matteo Garrone, 2018)\n\nSet in a dark and gloomy landscape in the outskirts of Rome, Dogman ̶ with noir-like elements ̶ follows the fate of downtrodden main character Marcello. Manipulated and exploited by male brutes, Marcello temporarily manages to gain a sense of self pride before he’s again abused, and rejected by the surrounding community. Never dull despite its drab colour schemes, Dogman entertains in all its misery and contains scenes and characters so seemingly impossible that we cannot help but laugh at the absurdity of it all.\n\nPájaros del verano (Birds of Passage, Cristina Gallego & Ciro Guerra, 2018)\n\nHighly acclaimed Pájaros del verano brings to mind Loving Pablo (2017) about drug lord Pablo Escobar. And like Lazzaro felice also Pájaros del verano crosses time and place. The viewer is taken on a visual and narrative ride where we’re initially presented members of a Wayuu family. The film then takes on epic proportions as it comments on Colombian drug trafficking. Main character Rapayet goes from low-level dealings to high-level drug trade as his business takes off and threatens family stability, leading to clashes between warring families. Stylishly shot, the film is divided into chapters, the viewer enters surreal landscapes and the film fascinates from beginning to end.\n\nSuspiria (Dario Argento, 1977)\n\nArgento’s is a cult movie like few others, a horror that delivers beyond our expectations. Using as external backdrop to the plot an imposing institution in the middle of nowhere, the cineaste tells a story where female students interact with staff then odd things happen and nothing is what it seems. Playing with our mind and senses, Suspiria creates suspense, shocks and manipulates all at once and it would have delivered a well-aimed punch to the collective solar plexus of audiences at the time.\n\nJirga (Benjamin Gilmour, 2018)\n\nAustralian drama Jirga is a solemn and poetic reflection on war. A man’s first-hand engagement in battle sees him taking the life of an Afghani man during a raid on this family. Subsequent feelings of remorse linger in this story about a former soldier who causes tragedy and grief. In Jirga, Mike Wheeler returns to Afghanistan three years later to ask for forgiveness. Does redemption exist for a self-declared enemy venturing into Taliban territories to establish a connection with the Other? This film set in an achingly beautiful, barren landscape offers a resolution and in the end the story seems contradictorily realistic.\n\nFirst Man (Damien Chazelle, 2018)\n\nChazelle’s film focuses not on the grandeur of the first moon landing. Instead, Armstrong and crew are presented in extreme close-up, and we’re claustrophobically invited into the space shuttle as Armstrong prepares for take-off. Exposed to simulation effects, we join him on his bumpy journey. Physically and mentally drawn into the human drama unfolding on screen, we get to know Armstrong professionally and personally in this intimate portrayal of him and first wife Janet Shearon who holds the domestic fortress while her husband masterfully navigates the realms high up above.\n\nBohemian Rhapsody (Bryan Singer, 2018)\n\nThis mind-blowing blockbuster is a feisty and dynamic tour de force where we get to know rock legend Freddie Mercury visually, musically, and on an intimate level. Raman Malek, of Egyptian and Parsi heritage and a spitting image of the singer, shines in the main role and we follow the increasingly troubled star from his pre-celebrity beginnings as he ventures into the local night life, moving from spectator to lead participant when Queen is born. Bohemian Rhapsody emphasises the free-flowing nature of Mercury and his multiple flamboyant personas on stage. Achingly sincere, Mercury is mesmerizing and Singer delivers a majestic tribute to the star in a film worth watching over and over again.\n\nPeter Hourigan\n\nMelbourne cinephile and former media teacher at secondary level\n\nMy year started with lots of good films, nothing “top ten” outstanding, but I was sustained by:\n\nLast Flag Flying (Richard Linklater 2017) A sense of pathos infused this war story – several generations after the war.\n\nIstanbul Kirmizisi (Red Istanbul, Ferhan Ozpetek 2017) Where multinational means a situation when two cultures (Turkish and Italian) really do meet.\n\nJusqu’à la garde (Custody, Xavier Legrand 2017) The pain felt by a jilted father comes through even though it’s a harrowing story of domestic violence.\n\nLes Gardiennes (The Guardians, Xavier Beauvois, 2017) This film is so infused with the spirit of Pialat’s La maison des bois (1972), it’s no surprise the project was recommended to Beauvois by Pialat’s widow.\n\nThen two films made a stronger impact, the Russian drama about a neglected child and the impact of his unexplained disappearance, and the American film about relationships, architecture and all:\n\nNelyobov (Loveless, Andrey Zvyagintsev, 2017) The pain of a neglected child caught between two bickering parents is deeply moving.\n\nColumbus (Kogonada, 2017) Its cinematic style reflected the architecture of its location Columbus, Indiana, and its director deep immersion in great cinema.\n\nThe first edition of Cinema Reborn in Sydney was a rich few days, but two films in new editions had the strongest impact.\n\nNighanaya ( The Treasure, Lester James Perier, 1972) A luminescent film. The surprise is why has this been absent for so long.\n\nThe Mummy (The Night of Counting the Years, Shadi Abdel Salam, 1969) A rich interweaving of several worlds – ancient and modern, and different attitudes to treasures. Radiantly stately and beautiful.\n\nCinema Ritrovato in Bologna was again a rich feast, perhaps with no particular film standing out for me, but three films can represent the range and rewards of this celebration of the history of Cinema:\n\nRosita (Ernst Lubitsch, 1923) It’s not Lubitsch’s greatest, but it’s hard to understand why Mary Pickford seems to have taken such steps to repress it.\n\nFad’jal (Safi Faye, 1979) A real discovery from Senegal. At first appearances a simple documentary of village life, but it’s so much more as it becomes a contemplation of the vast gap between what is history to a French Colonist and a village elder.\n\nCarosello napoletano (Neapolitan Carousel, Ettore Giani, 1954) An original look at the history of Naples through some of its popular songs over the ages, with the fantasy and imagination of a Powell and Pressburger.\n\nEn route to Bologna, I saw another of my year’s greats, an experience enhanced by seeing it in its own country, where its story of life under communism seemed shockingly still relevant.\n\nZimna wojna (Cold War, Pawel Pawlikowski, 2018).\n\nMelbourne International Film Festival followed on the heels of Cinema Ritrovato. Another cinematic banquet. My standouts were:\n\nDa xiang xi di er zuo (An Elephant Sitting Still, Ho Bon-chi, 2018) Almost four hours of B & W becomes a part of the experience of living in a town made bleak by the industrialization which has now passed on.\n\nZama (Lucrezia Martel, 2017) A complex, and rich film about a medium level official in 17th Century Argentina who is destined never to find a place where he feels he belongs.\n\nThe Dead Nation (Radu Jude, 2017) A documentary built around glass plates found in the holdings of a country photographer in Romania is telling in the way it reveals the difference between official histories and how ordinary people see themselves.\n\nSandome no satsujin (The Third Murder, Hirokazu Kore-eda, 2017) So different to what we’ve come to expect from this Japanese director that we can overlook the complexity of its look at crime and justice.\n\nTwo films that had limited commercial screenings but impressed with the way they tackled specific issues in their countries – the Norwegian massacre by a far-right extremist, and the continued impact of Japan’s use of comfort women in Korea during World War II.\n\nUtøya 22. Juli (U-July 22, Erik Poppe, 2018) An appalling act of terrorism is confronted exclusively from the point of view of a person caught up in it, making an original and compelling experience.\n\nHerstory (Kyu-dong Min, 2018) Korea confronts the wartime experience of comfort woman in a film that challenges Japan to also do the same.\n\nTwo films that I only fully appreciated second time around were:\n\nPhantom Thread (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2017)\n\nThe Tree of Life (Terrence Malick 2011/2018) The extended version available this year really did extend the film for me. With almost an extra hour of running time it feels only half as long and twice as complex.\n\nAnd what better way to end the year than with a real high, seemingly a tiny film – it’s only about a maid the director’s family had years ago – but how it becomes a film about Mexico, life and everything else. And it’s ravishing in its wide-screen black-and-white.\n\nRoma – (Alfonso Cuaron, 2018).\n\nCerise Howard\n\nEast-West Golden Arch Awards juror, Melbourne Cinémathèque co-curator and “Plato’s Cave” co-host\n\nA lucky 13 faves to have been released in Melbourne in 2018, on one platform or another.\n\nThey Shall Not Grow Old (Peter Jackson, 2018, seen in 2D)\n\nAfter faking Gallipoli footage in his and Costa Botes’ wonderful 1995 hoax documentary Forgotten Silver, determining where Jackson begins, and the pioneering, if altogether fictitious, advances in filmmaking by Colin MacKenzie end, grows ever harder! An astonishing, uncanny accomplishment in found-footage reanimation which communicates with devastating immediacy the horrors and banality of life for thems as signed up en masse for trench warfare in WWI.\n\nTerror Nullius (Soda_Jerk, 2018)\n\nIn a great year for supercuts, and notwithstanding that They Shall Not Grow Old premiered in Melbourne after a solemn minute’s silence on Armistice Day, nothing could match Terror Nullius’ premiere at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image for a sense of occasion. The grand unveiling at ACMI, in its installation form, deliciously occurred only a matter of days after its funders, The Ian Potter Foundation, officially distanced themselves from it, declaring it to be, of all things, “Un-Australian”. Mind you, it did plunder a surprisingly large number of New Zealand films for content! Nonetheless, it amounts to a glorious mashed-up hour of sociopolitical reckoning with Australian screen culture and its, and the nation’s political classes’, excesses, and its public disownment by its funders added joyous frissons galore at its opening, gifting Soda_Jerk, and ACMI with publicity they couldn’t have dreamt of obtaining with their own words and deeds alone.\n\nUna mujer fantástica (A Fantastic Woman, Sebastián Lelio, 2017)\n\nA wonderful film, at once authentic and steeped in bittersweet magic realist whimsy, which has been granted epochal status for ultimately landing its captivating trans lead performer Daniela Vega an Oscars-hosting gig. A game-changer! And I’m all for game-changers, where trans representation is concerned.\n\nThe Other Side of the Wind (Orson Welles, 2018)\n\nOh, Netflix – were that I could have seen this – especially the film-within-the-film – in a cinema (or perhaps at a drive-in best of all)! But kudos to Netflix too, for ensuring that it, finally, even exists, in some sort of finished form.\n\nZimna wojna (Cold War, Paweł Pawlikowski, 2018)\n\nVisages Villages (Faces Places, Agnès Varda, 2017)\n\nThe Favourite (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2018)\n\nFoxtrot (Samuel Maoz, 2017)\n\nTestről és lélekről (On Body and Soul, Ildikó Enyedi, 2017)\n\nManbiki kazoku (Shoplifters, Hirokazu Kore-eda, 2018)\n\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey & Rodney Rothman, 2018)\n\nThe Square (Ruben Östlund, 2017)\n\nSweet Country (Warwick Thornton, 2017)\n\nWonders new and old, encountered at festivals hither and yon\n\nHither (Melbourne)\n\nThe Green Fog (Guy Maddin, Galen Johnson & Evan Johnson, 2017)\n\nUn couteau dans le cœur (Knife + Heart, Yann Gonzalez, 2018)\n\nHoliday (Isabella Eklöf, 2018)\n\nLet the Corpses Tan (Hélène Cattet, Bruno Forzani, 2017)\n\nQueerama (Daisy Asquith, 2017)\n\nDiamantino (Gabriel Abrantes, Daniel Schmidt, 2018)\n\nPulse (Stevie Cruz-Martin, 2017)\n\nStrange Colours (Alena Lodkina, 2017)\n\nNico, 1988 (Susanna Nicchiarelli, 2017)\n\nLuz (Tilman Singer, 2018)\n\nYon\n\n„Îmi este indiferent dacă în istorie vom intra ca barbari” (“I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians”, Radu Jude, 2018)\n\nDomestik (Domestique, Adam Sedlák, 2018)\n\nBílý ráj (White Paradise, Karel Lamač, 1924)\n\nKing Skate (Šimon Šafránek, 2018)\n\nThe Miseducation of Cameron Post (Desiree Akhavan, 2017)\n\nKhrustal (Crystal Swan, Darya Zhuk, 2018)\n\nShorts\n\nEl Doctor (Suzan Pitt, 2006)\n\nJoy Street (Suzan Pitt, 1995)\n\nŠimtamečių godos (The Dreams of the Centenarians, Robertas Verba, 1969)\n\nAccidence (Guy Maddin, Galen Johnson & Evan Johnson, 2018)\n\nInanimate (Lucia Bulgheroni, 2018)\n\nThe Hymns of Muscovy (Dimitri Venkov, 2017)\n\nFauve (Jérémy Comte, 2018)\n\nBonobo (Zoel Aeschbacher, 2017)\n\nAll These Creatures (Charles Williams, 2018)\n\nWe Vanish (Astrid Dominguez Ortega, 2018)\n\nEast-West: Golden Arch awards jury duty longlist revelations (atop the aforementioned Foxtrot and On Body and Soul)\n\nNovember (Rainer Sarnet, 2017)\n\nA stunningly beautiful, high-contrast, gothic Estonian b&w folktale like no other I’ve ever encountered.\n\nPororoca (Constantin Popescu, 2017)\n\nBogdan Dumitrache’s slow-burn descent into desolation and madness is one for the ages.\n\nSveta (Zhanna Issabayeva, 2017)\n\nDeaf actor Laura Koroleva upends all expectations that her deaf character will fall prey to the usual topos of Eastern European miserabilism as the magnificently manipulative Sveta of the title.\n\nRepertory screening wonders\n\nKusama’s Self-Obliteration (Jud Yalkut, 1967)\n\nAnd presented by, and programmed by my colleagues at, The Melbourne Cinémathèque\n\nOlivia (Jacqueline Audry, 1951)\n\nMuchachas de Uniforme (Alfredo B.

I say “organize” because most of the curation was performed by others. David Dinnell brought nearly five hours of 16mm films culled from the collection of Canyon Cinema. Paul Harrill presented “A Sense of Place: A Retrospective of American Regional Cinema, 1960-1989.” Blake Williams curated a diverse and challenging program of 3D work, “Stereo Visions.” And I collaborated with Lewis Klahr on an installation and two screenings. The majority of my favorite film discoveries this year screened during our four-day festival.\n\nThe other festival highlight of the year was “A History of Shadows,” a wide-ranging program curated by Gerwin Tamsma and Gustavo Beck in Rotterdam. Also, I was thrilled to finally catch up with Angela Schanelec’s work thanks to Mubi’s streaming retrospective over the summer. I limited myself to one film per director on each list. Otherwise, Schanelec would have earned three or four mentions.\n\nAs for new films, Zama and Western towered over every other feature I saw.

The Other Side of the Wind (Orson Welles, 2018)\n\nUndoubtedly the cinematic event of the year was the unveiling of a reconstructed version of Orson Welles’s great unfinished 1970s project, first at the Venice International Film Festival then ultimately to the massive online audience of Netflix. Whether or not Welles would have been bemused at where his reels and reels of analog film ended up in the Digital Age, the concept and “finished” product remain resolutely modern, resting on a dense knowledge of cinematic and media tropes and the form now known as “mockumentary.”\n\n1. Beoning (Burning, Lee Chang-dong, 2018)\n\nBeguiling and mysterious in both tone and subject, the newest film from the great Lee Chang-dong, one of the best dramatists in cinema today, starts with casual coincidences and a tentative relationship between an introverted wannabe writer (Yoo Ah-in) and a mercurial woman from his childhood (Jun Jong-seo). Once an insouciant interloper (the casually menacing Steven Yeun) enters the picture, however, the film becomes something darker, moodier, slowly unleashing the undercurrent of potential emotional and physical violence that was always there.\n\n2. Sorry to Bother You (Boots Riley, 2018)\n\nTruly unpredictable, the feature debut of political activist rapper Boots Riley is by turns hilarious, sexy, and awe-inspiringly confrontational. Starting as a satire of corporate-speak and code-switching, it gradually evolves into something much stranger and more suspicious of the entire edifice of modern capitalism, embracing science-fiction and magical realist elements on its way to a fantastical climax.\n\n3. Support the Girls (Andrew Bujalski, 2018)\n\nFew movies even to attempt to confront thorny issues of race, class, or sexism, let alone the intersection of all three or in an engaging way, but the cast and crew of this year’s great social comedy is up to the challenge. Under the generic guise of a practically all-female workplace comedy, Support the Girls better mines the pitfalls of capitalism than movies twice as long and twice as serious.\n\n4. Minding the Gap (Bing Liu, 2018) & Shirkers (Sandi Tan, 2018)\n\nTwo remarkable, personal documentaries were released this year, each searching through footage of the past to reconcile and make sense of the present. In Minding the Gap, Bing Liu intercuts adolescent home movies of himself and his skater pals with present day interviews with them, trying to pinpoint exactly how people become who they become; Shirkers mixes images from a legendary Singaporean independent movie with a retrospective investigation of its making and history, all tied together by the resilient obsession of writer/director/star Sandi Tan.\n\n5. BlacKkKlansman (Spike Lee, 2018)\n\nOnly as fiercely political a filmmaker as Spike Lee could have made this movie in the year 2018, and current events and the cultural climate conspired to make it relevant. Bluntly drawing a line between the KKK of the 1970s, pathetic but courting respectability, to the alt-right and their political enablers of today, the movie entertainingly but incisively implores us to avoid the mistakes of the very recent past.\n\n6. Lazzaro felice (Happy as Lazzaro, Alice Rohrwacher, 2018)\n\nMixing a magical realist narrative with a social realist aesthetic, Lazzaro tells the tale of a kind of “holy fool” (the remarkably blank and good-natured Adriano Tardiolo) living and working amidst a family of sharecroppers in rural Italy. As the story goes on its surprising way, he anchors everything in astonishingly open, reactive empathy.\n\n7. The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling (Judd Apatow, 2018)\n\nApatow finally brings his penchant for elephantine running times to a worthwhile subject, his hero and friend Garry Shandling, an inspirational force in both stand-up comedy and television. Jumping off from candid footage and snippets of diary, the film paints a portrait of a keenly talented, flawed, and temperamentally spiritual artist.\n\n8. Leave No Trace (Debra Granik, 2018)\n\nAs haunting and soft-spoken as its lead father-daughter pair, Leave No Trace nevertheless builds a thriller-like intensity by possessing an acute sense of place and focusing on the gradually diverging desires of its characters confronting the demands of the outside world.\n\n9. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (Ethan Coen and Joel Coen, 2018) & Damsel (David Zellner and Nathan Zellner, 2018)\n\nAny new Coens film is a cause for celebration, and Buster Scruggs delivers six vignettes of their patented blend of comic despair and hyper-literate wordplay against the backdrop of the Old West. The Zellner brothers’ surprising Western would have fit right into the Scruggs anthology, maybe as a dark inverse of the “Gal Who Got Rattled” segment.\n\n10. Ying (Shadow, Zhang Yimou, 2018)\n\nThe commercial and artistic aspirations of Zhang Yimou have ebbed and flowed throughout his long career, but this year’s Shadow is a highlight, a return to his interests in gender relations, exacting color schemes, and martial action.\n\nA Few 2018 US Premiere Favorites\n\nThe following made their non-festival premieres within the US in 2018 (and I didn’t include them in last year’s poll):\n\nUn beau soleil intérieur (Let the Sunshine In, Claire Denis, 2017)\n\nLa caméra de Claire (Claire’s Camera, Hong Sang-soo, 2017)\n\nThe Death of Stalin (Armando Iannucci, 2017)\n\nFirst Reformed (Paul Schrader, 2017)\n\nSanpo suru shinryakusha (Before We Vanish, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, 2017)\n\nZama (Lucrecia Martel, 2017)\n\nFinally, R.I.P. FilmStruck!"
