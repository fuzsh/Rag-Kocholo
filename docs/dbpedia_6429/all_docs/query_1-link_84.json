        "text": "What counts as distracted driving\n\nOntario’s distracted driving laws apply to the use of hand-held communication/entertainment devices and certain display screens.\n\nWhile you are driving, including when you are stopped in traffic or at a red light, it is illegal to:\n\nuse a phone or other hand-held wireless communication device to text or dial – you can only touch a device to call 911 in an emergency\n\nuse a hand-held electronic entertainment device, such as a tablet or portable gaming console\n\nview display screens unrelated to driving, such as watching a video\n\nprogram a GPS device, except by voice commands\n\nYou are allowed to use hands-free wireless communications devices with an earpiece, lapel button or Bluetooth. You can view GPS display screens as long as they are built into your vehicle’s dashboard or securely mounted on the dashboard.\n\nOther actions such as eating, drinking, grooming, smoking, reading and reaching for objects are not part of Ontario’s distracted driving law. However, you can still be charged with careless or dangerous driving.\n\nDistracted driving statistics\n\nIn Ontario, deaths from collisions caused by distracted driving have doubled since 2000.\n\nOntario data on collisions from 2013 show:\n\none person is injured in a distracted-driving collision every half hour\n\na driver using a phone is four times more likely to crash than a driver focusing on the road\n\nPenalties for distracted driving\n\nThe easiest way to avoid penalties for distracted driving is to not use a hand-held device when you’re behind the wheel.\n\nIt’s against the law to use hand-held communication (e.g. your phone) and electronic entertainment devices (e.g. DVD player, e-reader) while driving.\n\nIn fact, simply holding a phone or other device while driving is against the law.\n\nYou can use:\n\na hands-free device (e.g. Bluetooth) but only to turn it on and off\n\na mounted device (e.g. phone, GPS) as long as it is secure – not moving around while driving\n\nIf convicted, the penalty you face depends on the kind of licence you hold and how long you’ve been driving.\n\nDrivers with A to G licences\n\nIf you have an A, B, C, D, E, F, G and/or M licence, you’ll face bigger penalties when convicted of distracted driving:\n\nFirst conviction:\n\na fine of $615, if settled out of court (includes a victim surcharge and the court fee)\n\na fine of up to $1,000 if a summons is received or if you fight the ticket in court and lose\n\nthree demerit points\n\n3-day suspension\n\nSecond conviction\n\na fine of $615, if settled out of court (includes a victim surcharge and the court fee)\n\na fine of up to $2,000 if a summons is received or if you fight the ticket in court and lose\n\nsix demerit points\n\n7-day suspension\n\nThird and any further conviction(s)\n\na fine of $615, if settled out of court (includes a victim surcharge and the court fee)\n\na fine of up to $3,000 if a summons is received or if you fight the ticket in court and lose\n\nsix demerit points\n\n30-day suspension\n\nNovice drivers\n\nIf you hold a G1, G2, M1 or M2 licence, and are convicted of distracted driving, you’ll face the same fines as drivers with A to G licences. But you won’t receive any demerit points.\n\nInstead of demerit points you’ll face longer suspensions:\n\na 30-day licence suspension for a first conviction\n\na 90-day licence suspension for a second conviction\n\ncancellation of your licence and removal from the Graduated Licensing System (GLS) for a third conviction\n\nto get your licence back you’d have to redo the GLS program\n\nCareless driving\n\nYou could face more charges – for careless driving – if you endanger other people because of any kind of distraction. This includes distraction caused by both hand-held (e.g., phone) or hands-free (e.g., Bluetooth) devices.\n\nIf convicted of careless driving, you may receive:\n\nsix demerit points\n\nfines up to $2,000 and/or\n\na jail term of six months\n\na licence suspension of up to two years\n\nYou could even be charged with dangerous driving – a criminal offence that carries heavier penalties, including jail terms of up to 10 years for causing bodily harm or up to 14 years for causing death.\n\nTips to avoid distracted driving\n\nUse any of these tips to avoid distracted driving and its penalties:\n\nturn off your phone or switch it to silent mode before you get in the car\n\nput it in the glove compartment (lock it, if you have to) or in a bag on the back seat\n\nbefore you leave the house, record an outgoing message that tells callers you’re driving and you’ll get back to them when you’re off the road\n\nsome apps can block incoming calls and texts, or send automatic replies to people trying to call or text you\n\nask a passenger to take a call or respond to a text for you\n\nif you must respond, or have to make a call or send a text, carefully pull over to a safe area\n\nsilence notifications that tempt you to check your phone\n\nCalling 911\n\nIn an emergency, you can use your phone to call 911, but be sure to pull off the road to a safe area to make the call."
