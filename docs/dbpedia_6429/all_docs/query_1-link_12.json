We do not offer rain checks or refunds due to inclement weather.\n\nService animals are welcome on Zoo grounds under the care of their owner. The Houston Zoo asks that all guests with service animals check in at our Safety and Security window (currently at the main entrance to the right of the ticket booths) to register their animal. Service animals must remain under their owner’s control at all times.\n\nVIEW SERVICE ANIMAL MAP\n\nPlease note that emotional support animals, assistance animals, or companion animals are not allowed in the Zoo.\n\nYes.

Operators must be 18 years of age or older. All operators between the ages of 18 and 21 must have a valid driver’s license and signature of a legal parent/guardian over the age of 21. Young children are not allowed to operate the chair.\n\nThe Hermann Park Railroad is not officially associated with Houston Zoo, and the train does not run within Zoo grounds.
