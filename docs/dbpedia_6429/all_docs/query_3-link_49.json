It is the responsibility of parents, guardians, and/or caregivers to let their children know what they should do if they must leave the Library.\n\nLibrary staff may call appropriate City agencies if an individual appears to be truant, is left unattended when a Library facility closes, or otherwise appears to be unwilling or unable to care for themselves.\n\nChildren’s areas are designated for children 12 and under; Teen areas are designated for ages 13 to 18.\n\nAdults may visit Teen and Children’s areas only when accompanied by children using those departments or retrieving materials for research or checkout.\n\nAdults unaccompanied by children may be asked by Library staff to use the restrooms, facilities, services, and/or equipment in the adult section of the Library.\n\nLast Revised 12/2019\n\nAttendance at Library Public Programs\n\nAs part of its mission to ensure open access to information and the exchange of ideas, The New York Public Library hosts public programs across its locations.\n\nThe following policies apply to the Library’s public programs:\n\nAll members of the public are welcome to attend the Library’s public programs, subject to any occupancy limits and, where applicable, ticketing requirements.\n\nAll Library users and program attendees must comply with the Library’s General Policies and Rules and to rules applicable to a particular venue (e.g., bag check requirements) or to a particular program (e.g., prohibitions on photography or recording).\n\nFor pre-ticketed events, attendees will only be admitted upon the presentation of a valid ticket.\n\nThe Library recognizes and supports the rights of attendees and other members of the public to exercise their rights of freedom of speech and peaceable assembly. Accordingly, picketing and distribution of literature in a traditional public forum (generally the sidewalk) outside Library premises may be conducted so long as it does not interfere with access or egress, is not disruptive to the activities within the Library, and is otherwise undertaken in accordance with any applicable local permitting and public assembly laws and regulations. Organizers of demonstrations adjacent to Library facilities are requested to inform the Library 48 hours in advance so the Library may put in place any necessary arrangements, including safety and security measures.\n\nFailure to comply with these rules may result in expulsion from a Library program or facility, suspension of Library privileges, and/or arrest and prosecution to the full extent of the law.\n\nThe Library reserves the right to amend these rules.\n\nLast Revised 12/2019"
