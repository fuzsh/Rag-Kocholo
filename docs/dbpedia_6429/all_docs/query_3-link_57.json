        "text": "With many areas of North Carolina and parts of the Palmetto State facing potential flooding from Tropical Storm Debby, AAA – The Auto Club Group is urging motorists to adhere to local authorities and weather warnings to stay safe.\n\n“Heavy rain could play a major role in disrupting motorists across the Carolinas,” said Tiffany Wright, director of public affairs for AAA – The Auto Club Group in the Carolinas. “Make sure to be extra vigilant behind the wheel and avoid flooded areas, because just a few inches of water can turn your vehicle into a boat, and could put your life, and the lives of those around you, at great risk.”\n\nAAA has a few driving tips for motorists dealing with the effects of heavy rain and flooding:\n\nVisibility While Driving: If you can’t see the edges of the road or other vehicles at a safe distance while driving during wet weather, pull off the road as far as you can and wait for the rain to ease up. Make sure to turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers.\n\nSlow Down and Leave Room: Slowing down during wet weather driving can be critical to reducing a car’s chance of hydroplaning, when the tires rise on a film of water. Drivers should reduce their speed to correspond to the amount of water on the roadway. It is important for motorists to allow ample stopping distance between cars by increasing the following distance of the vehicle in front of them.\n\nAvoid Cruise Control: Never use cruise control in wet conditions. The chances of losing control of your vehicle greatly increase.\n\nResponding to a Skid: Even the most careful drivers can experience skids. If a driver feels their car is about to skid, don’t panic and follow these basic steps.\n\nContinue to look and steer in the direction the driver wants the car to go\n\nAvoid slamming on the brakes to maintain control.\n\nAvoid Standing Water and Flooded Roads at All Times: There is no way to tell how deep standing water is on a flooded road and driving through it can be very dangerous. Flooded roads can cause a vehicle to stall and result in severe damage to the vehicle from:\n\nFlooding the engine\n\nWarping brake rotors\n\nLoss of power steering\n\nShort in electrical components\n\nIf Your Vehicle Stalls in a Flooded Area:\n\nDO NOT remain in the car.\n\nAbandon your vehicle as soon as possible and seek higher ground. Flood waters can elevate quickly, sweeping away the vehicle and its occupants.\n\nAbout AAA – The Auto Club Group\n\nThe Auto Club Group (ACG) is the second largest AAA club in North America with more than 13 million members across 14 U.S. states and two U.S. territories.
