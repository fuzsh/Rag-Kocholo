        "text": "\"So what are you, man or superman?\"\n\n— Lana Lang to Clark Kent, Pilot\n\nClark Kent, aka Superman, is Earth's greatest hero and the main protagonist of Smallville. Hailing from the planet Krypton, Clark is a super-powered alien who was raised in Smallville, Kansas. He resided there until his early adult years, when he moved to Metropolis.\n\nBorn as Kal-El to Jor-El and Lara-El, he was sent to Earth by his parents to fulfill a destiny in which he would become the savior of humanity: he was rocketed off of the planet just minutes before its destruction. Accompanied by a massive meteor shower, his spaceship crash-landed in Miller's Field in Smallville: there, he was found by farmers Jonathan Kent and Martha Kent to which they raised him as their son and named him Clark. Thanks to the yellow sun, Clark developed many Kryptonian powers that grew stronger as he got older. His parents instilled in him strong moral principles and taught him to use his abilities for good. Clark learned much about his origins from Dr. Virgil Swann, a journal, and an artificial intelligence version of Jor-El. Clark secretly fought crime around his hometown during his high school years and moonlit as a vigilante throughout Metropolis initially known as the Good Samaritan, then as the Red-Blue Blur, and then simply as the Blur. By day, he works as a reporter at the Daily Planet and manages his family's farm.\n\nFor many years, Clark maintained an association with Lex Luthor that started as a friendship before evolving into mutual enmity, a complicated relationship with his first love Lana Lang, and finally met Lois Lane, with whom he began a relationship after they were assigned as co-workers at the Daily Planet. He also developed an unbreakable bond with his childhood friend Chloe Sullivan, an association with Lionel Luthor, a friendship with Oliver Queen with whom he works to fight for good, was the owner of a dog (Shelby) and an acquaintance with Tess Mercer.\n\nAfter Jonathan's death, Clark started to mature more and began to worry more about the consequences of his actions. After several incidents involving his Kryptonian heritage (i.e. Kal-El's deadly encounters with Brainiac and a bond with his cousin Kara Kent), Lana's departure and Lex's constant attempts to discover his secret, Clark began to embrace his destiny as a hero, culminating in Jimmy Olsen's published photograph of the super-powered \"Red-Blue Blur\" on the Planet front page and the citizens adopting that name for their own vigilante. Following Jimmy's death as a consequence of Clark's mistakes while trying to stop Davis Bloome/Doomsday, Clark dropped the red-and-blue look and embraced his Kryptonian side, starting to leave his family crest as a symbol of hope at the sites of his heroic feats. When Zod returned to Earth as a younger clone of himself with his army and declared war on Earth, Kal-El had several encounters with Zod. After he used the Book of Rao to send all the army to a new world, Kal-El won over Zod in a deadly battle.\n\nWhen he was warned about Darkseid coming to Earth, Clark's future as a hero fell into question due to the doubts and fears in his heart. But after going with Brainiac 5 to the future, he came back with a new purpose for his crusade and recently took the next step toward the future he saw by revealing his secret to Lois, who surprised him by telling him she already knew. With his secret out of the way, and seeing how well his relationship with Lois strengthened him, Clark decided to take the next step by proposing to Lois, who accepted with great delight. He also mentored his \"brother\" Alexander Luthor/Conner Kent.\n\nClark and his allies began making preparations to defend Earth from the coming of Darkseid. In the midst of his and Lois' wedding and after a final reunion with Lex, Clark won the battle with Darkseid by mastering his ability to fly, putting on the suit, pushing Apokolips away from Earth, and finally fulfilling his destiny by becoming the Earth's greatest savior known as Superman.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nMain article: Clark Kent's attire\n\n\"You do know, of course, you look absolutely ridiculous in that, right? And I got a great tailor, hook you up with a little color, maybe.\"\n\n— Oliver Queen to Clark, Roulette\n\n\"You talk like a cop, you walk like a fireman. Heck, you beat us to most of our own crime scenes. You might as well put an \"S\" on your chest.\"\n\n— Bert Camp to Clark, Masquerade\n\nPhysically, Clark stands around 6 feet 3 inches tall in height and is broad-shouldered and muscular in build, towering even over other tall and muscular men, such as Oliver Queen. This build, alongside his wavy dark brown hair, perfectly puts him into the description of \"tall, dark and handsome.\" He also had bangs in the earlier seasons. In the later seasons, his hair was gelled up. Sometimes in the rain, you'd see his bangs. He has the traditional House of El's blue navy eyes, with many other fellow Kryptonians telling him he has \"his father's eyes\". In fact, Clark looks just like his father Jor-El while he was on Earth during his youth.\n\nA result of his good looks (and sometimes solely because of them), Clark is often the object of sexual desire for most of the women he comes in contact with.[17] Even women who have been admittedly in love with Clark have been known to physically objectify him.[18] In spite of this attention, Clark is generally oblivious to his attractiveness, and has never seemed to have much vanity or concern with his appearance at all (save for occasions where he was afraid of standing out or looking foolish).\n\nIn Seasons 1-8, Clark often wore a red jacket and blue t-shirt or the other way around. In Season Eight's Infamous, he stopped wearing red and blue while working at the Daily Planet so that he could start to create a dual identity. As a reporter, Clark wore dress shirts, ties and dark suits. Clark once showed Lois a pair of thick-lenses black-rimmed glasses. Once he began to step out more into the public eye as a superhero, Clark decided to wear the glasses more regularly in order to mask his true identity.\n\nAs the Red-Blue Blur, Clark wore a bright blue short-sleeved t-shirt, a dark red jacket, a black belt, light blue jeans and brown work boots.\n\nIn Season Nine, Clark started to wear attire consisting of a black low-collar long-sleeved double-breasted twin-tailed trench coat, black pocketed denim pants, black belt, black riding boots, and a high-collar short-sleeved black shirt that bears a gray Mark of El. Since Sacrifice, he started to wear a white version of the Mark of El which shined brightly enough to be seen clearly if he was standing in the shadows.\n\nIn Season Nine, Clark started to wear a black carhartt jacket with a black t-shirt underneath, black jeans and black boots to reflect his Kandorian Blur costume. This clothing is reminiscent to the red jacket and blue t-shirt.\n\nAfter his near-death experience in Lazarus, Clark returned to his \"Red-Blue Blur\" look. He wore a bright blue low-collar short-sleeved t-shirt, a dark red leather low-collar long-sleeved, a dark red leather zip-up jacket with the Mark of El on the front, a black belt, black pants, and brown work boots.\n\nMartha made Clark a costume that consisted of a blue low-collar long-sleeved shirt with a diamond-shaped, red-lined and yellow shield emblem with a red Mark of El in the middle on the chest, with blue pants with red trunks, a yellow belt, a pair of red boots and a flowing low-collar long red cape. Due to Clark's inner doubts and fears, Jor-El kept the costume in the Fortress of Solitude for the time being. Once Clark fully embraced his powers, Jor-El unveiled the costume, which was then presented to Clark by the spirit of Jonathan.\n\nClark has been seen wearing his glasses as his mild-mannered disguise in the following episodes:\n\nSeason Three: Whisper\n\nSeason Six: Noir\n\nSeason Seven: Apocalypse\n\nSeason Nine: Idol, Salvation\n\nSeason Ten: Homecoming, Masquerade, Booster, Prophecy, Finale Part 1, Finale Part 2\n\nSeason Eleven: Guardian, Haunted, Argo, Olympus\n\nSmallville Miniseries: Alien, Lantern, Continuity\n\nThe Red-Blue Blur/The Blur\n\nChloe: \"You know, Clark, maybe you can have your cape and wear it, too. Say that Clark Kent, the unassuming journalist, buttoned up in a starched shirt and tie, but then, when he's playing the hero, he—\"\n\nClark: \"Steps out of the shadow into his red and blue, creating two completely separate identities\"\n\n― Chloe Sullivan and Clark Kent in Infamous\n\nMain article: Clark Kent's aliases\n\nWhen Clark began anonymously saving strangers in Metropolis, he became known as the Good Samaritan. Jimmy Olsen began tracking his saves, determined to get to the bottom of it. Finally, Jimmy was able to capture a picture of Clark super-speeding. His red jacket and blue shirt appeared on the image, causing Jimmy to name him the Red-Blue Blur.\n\nWith the start of Season Nine, Clark went by the Blur. As the Blur, Clark wore dark clothing with his family's Kryptonian symbol on his chest, alluding to the Superman costume and also to the fact that Clark was still in mourning over Jimmy's death. He also left the Mark of El burned onto an object wherever he saved lives or stopped a crime. For a short while, Clark left his human life behind but returned to his life as Clark Kent to keep an eye on Lois, though he still mainly focused on his Kryptonian training with Jor-El.\n\nAfter Cat Grant told him that the world needs an all-American hero who doesn't hide in the shadows, Clark was inspired to make a change and started with his costume, donning a new attire consisting of a red leather jacket with the Mark of El engraved on it and a blue shirt underneath.\n\nBlur 1: Due to Clark's constant red-jacket/blue-shirt look (at times blue-jacket/red-shirt) at the start of his super-saves in Metropolis, Jimmy's first photo of him gave the general public the perception of a super-speeding man in red and blue. Unwilling to don a 'suit' just yet, though also seeing the notion on how a costumed hero watching over the people of the city can give them some hope, Clark sought Oliver to give the city a single clear view of his seeding alias. As confirmed by later notions, like kids' views of \"the Red-Blue Blur\" resembling what'll be Superman,[19] as well as Martha adapting a yellow belt and Clark's red cape given to him by Rachel Davenport, the general public perceives this first guise of the proto-Superman \"Blur\" to be mostly donning blue, a yellow belt, and heavy red cape.\n\nBlur 2: Though still giving off a mostly blur-like perception to the public, Clark decided to notch up his proto-Superman alias, with the events of Doomsday persuading him to drop the red/blue colors in favor of a pure black look. This actual 'suit' includes a cape-like trench coat, in a way continuing on from the perception Oliver gave Metropolis back in Identity, and the actual Mark of El proudly on his chest. Because he isn't letting the citizens still fully see him yet, though there are exceptions from time to time with allowing Lois and a few citizens to glimpse him, Clark emphasizes the use of his family's crest by burning it at areas of his saves. Though it was at a great distance, thus mostly obscuring his face from the general public, he did let them fully see him for the first time during his last super-save in this suit as he caught the Daily Planet globe. This costume is very similar to the one Zod adopted when he possessed Lex.\n\nBlur 3: Clark's truly final transition from the seeding alias that has been building for two years. In response to Cat Grant's emphasis on the continuing paranoia from certain sections of the general public and even the US military toward costumed heroes, Clark forever dropped the black in favor of returning to the more American-friendly red and blue. Though unable to keep a cape-look due to Jor-El confining the full-fledged Superman suit that Martha made for him, Clark opted to don a 'suit' more familiar with Oliver and the Justice League's: A red leather jacket with the iconic 'S' embedded (two halves of it on the left and right sides) of the front chest section, as well as a blue shirt from his first Blur look under the jacket. Clark used this last contribution to his proto-Superman \"Blur\" far less than the prior two so far, taking what could be considered a five-episode sabbatical before he finally started performing public super-saves in it.\n\nHe has been seen wearing his costume in the following episodes:\n\nSeason Nine: Savior, Metallo, Rabid, Echo, Roulette, Crossfire, Idol, Pandora, Disciple, Absolute Justice, Part 2, Warrior, Persuasion, Conspiracy, Checkmate, Upgrade, Charade, Salvation\n\nSeason Ten: Lazarus, Shield, Homecoming, Ambush, Icarus, Beacon, Masquerade, Scion, Booster, Prophecy\n\nOliver once wore a mock-up version of Clark's costume on one occasion to act as cover for Clark in Identity.\n\nSuperman\n\nSuperman Suit: Made by Martha Kent, this costume consists of a blue low-collar long-sleeved shirt with a diamond-shaped, red-lined and yellow shield emblem with a red Mark of El in the middle on the chest with blue pants with red trunks, a yellow belt with a Mark of El buckle, a pair of red boots and a red flowing low-collar long cape with a yellow diamond-shaped, black-lined emblem with a black-lined Mark of El in the middle on the back. Due to Clark's conquering his inner doubts and fears and fully mastering his powers, he was bequeathed the suit by both Jor-El and Jonathan Kent.\n\nSuperman Suit II: Clark changed his costume six months later. Gone are the red trunks, replaced by a red belt trimmed in gold with a gold buckle. Blue-gray bands now run lengthwise along his sides from under the arms to his boots. The Mark of El on the cape is now in dark silhouette with all the yellow removed. Clark explained that he put lead in the shield of his new suit to protect himself from being shot with Kryptonite bullets. Superman's belt buckle can also be used as a communication device for Watchtower, and has a holo-computer.\n\nHe has been seen wearing the Superman suit in the following episodes:\n\nFirst costume\n\nSeason Nine: Salvation\n\nSeason Ten: Homecoming, Finale, Part 2\n\nSecond costume\n\nSeason Eleven: Guardian, Detective, Haunted, Effigy, Argo, Valkyrie, Olympus, Hollow\n\nSmallville Miniseries: Titans, Alien, Lantern, Chaos, Continuity\n\nSuperman Speed Force Suit: While battling Black Flash, Clark wore a new Superman suit, created by Emil Hamilton. Emil took the concept of sending Clark into the sun to remove his irradiation to fashion a containment suit. He then modified the suit to collect speed energy so Clark could be able to use it to constantly move fast enough to confront the demon. This costume is half black half electric-blue, covering all of his body and with a bright House of El emblem on the chest.\n\nHe has been seen wearing the speed force suit in the following episodes:\n\nSeason Eleven: Haunted\n\nGreen Lantern\n\nAs a Green Lantern, Clark wears a sleek energy constructed uniform, created by his power ring, which is a necessary accessory. Like all Green Lanterns' costumes, its colors are green and black. He wears a black tight suit, which covers all of his body except his hands and face, underneath the energy contracted green details of his costume, which includes bracelets, boots and the emblem of House of El, instead of that of the Green Lanterns, on his chest, which expands into a big armor covering his chest, neck, belly, and shoulders. While in costume his eyes also glow green.\n\nHe has been seen wearing the Green Lantern uniform in the following episodes:\n\nSmallville Miniseries: Lantern\n\nPersonality[]\n\n\"What's real is your strength and integrity and compassion. As long as you remain honest to those things, it doesn't matter what you wear or what name you go by, because...you'll always be my son\"\n\n— Martha to Clark, in Beacon\n\nTwo traits of Clark Kent that have been prominent for most of the series have been his positive and optimistic view on humanity as well as his self-loathing and self-pity of not being human. Clark strongly believes that feelings such as compassion are synonymous to the human race, and think humans are, on the whole, noble beings. He has often expressed a desire to be human and a disdain towards his alien heritage, probably because he feels his biology hinders his humanity despite several people telling him that humanity is more than biology.[20] Clark also has been told many times to have a hero complex and that he often does good, selfless acts without any thought for himself. Clark can sometimes be sarcastic with others like he was with Lois when they first met.\n\nThis self-loathing is probably why Clark internalizes situations and believes everything is his fault or revolves around him in some fashion. It deeply affects him when his loved ones suffer because of his secret, as he fails to consider that people who love him would willingly suffer for him and instead blames himself for any trouble that befalls them, regardless as to whether he's responsible or not.[21] He considers knowing his secret a burden to bear that puts the secret-keeper in danger.[22] He often feels guilty about things over which he had no control and, because of this, does not consider himself a hero.[23] It may also explain part of his constant fear of sharing his secret, assuming that he won't be accepted for what he is because he is not comfortable with himself.[24] Clark also struggles with the fact that he cannot save every endangered person and, as such, feels that his heroic deeds are inadequate.[25]\n\nThis inferiority complex also extends to how Clark feels about his own race since he was quick to judge that Kryptonians were evil until discovering that they, like humans, were capable of love and compassion as well as hate and evil, his own father having been a respected Kryptonian scientist who had his world's best interests at heart. Clark has made some improvements toward accepting who he is, expressing gratefulness for his abilities and taking pride in his compassion for the human race, which he views as a strength.[26] However, recent events and revelations have caused Clark to abruptly change his mind about his compassionate side, and he now feels like caring too much for humans limits his ability to save them.[27] As he has grown older, Clark has begun to realize that the circumstances surrounding his destiny affect a greater circle than his small hometown and has clearly decided to embark on his Kryptonian training in the near future. After Lana moved away from Smallville, accompanied by a near-death experience when he was temporarily rendered powerless, Clark resolved to take a more active role in his destiny and took a job at the Daily Planet to be certain of being in \"the thick of the action.\" In conjunction with this decision, he began to use his powers in a more active manner.[28]\n\nClark has two notable characteristics that he takes directly after his biological parents Jor-El and Lara: His father's independent spirit and his mother's never-ending bravery and compassionate heart. (Abandoned)\n\nClark is idealistic and has the ability to always find the good in people, which manifests itself into a willingness to trust others to a fault.\n\nHe trusted Lex Luthor for several seasons, despite indications that Lex was engaged in unethical projects.\n\nHe was willing to give Zod a chance, even though he knew that his original self had contributed to the destruction of Krypton.\n\nHe was willing to trust Lionel Luthor from Season 5 on despite the many previous indications of Lionel's villainy.\n\nHe continued to consider Pete Ross a friend even after Pete proved a poor custodian of his secret and began to engage in unethical behavior, often blaming Clark for his problems due to knowing the secret causing him too much stress.\n\nHe continued to love and trust Lana even though she had married his former best friend and current enemy Lex Luthor.\n\nHe was willing to trust Brainiac 5 when he said he had been re-programmed, even though previous versions of the Kryptonian supercomputer had tried to resurrect Zod, kill him, his loved ones, unleash the Doomsday beast, and destroy the entire planet of Earth.\n\nHe was willing to put Tess Mercer in charge of Watchtower, despite knowing that she, like Lex, was involved in unethical activities and had previously sided with Zod and the Kandorian army against Earth.\n\nHe gave Clark Luthor a second chance and sent him back to Earth-2, despite knowing that he was a sociopathic mass murderer who had ruined life for the citizens of Metropolis on his adopted home planet.\n\nHe had faith in Oliver Queen after he had been controlled by Darkseid's prophets using the Omega symbol, even though Oliver had just tried to take away all of his powers using gold kryptonite.\n\nHis ability to find the good in others has led to the redemption of several villains, including two Luthors: Lionel Luthor and Tess Mercer. He wasn't able to \"save\" Lex Luthor and apologized to him for failing to do so in Season Ten's Finale, Part 2, he also failed to redeem Zod, despite reaching out to him in friendship midway through Season Nine.\n\nClark also completely rejects the idea that the greater good can ever justify killing someone, even if it means that many others may die:\n\nClark refused to kill the impending vessel of General Zod, even though it was likely that Zod would destroy Earth like he had attempted to destroy Krypton. Instead, he killed Brainiac and in doing so, unwittingly open a portal to the Phantom Zone and freed Zod.\n\nRokk Krinn and the Legion of Super-Heroes were willing to kill Chloe in order to destroy Brainiac and save the lives of billions on Earth. Clark stopped them and insisted they find a better way: eventually they discovered they could combine their powers to generate an EMP and them remove Brainiac's nanites from Chloe, saving her life. (Legion)\n\nClark was not willing to kill Doomsday even though he might destroy Metropolis and much of Earth. As a result, Oliver Queen and his team of heroes incapacitated Clark with kryptonite in order to attempt to kill Davis, as they knew that Clark wouldn't be willing to consider murder. (Doomsday)\n\nHowever, on very few occasions, Clark was willing to hurt or even kill an alien in order to save others and/or himself. This was shown in particular when he faced the alien Titan in a brutal fight and revealed a sinister smile towards his opponent before punching him upwards. (Combat) He recapitulated this behavior in a fight with his doppelganger Bizarro, superimposed by a feeling of superiority in each case. (Bizarro) Several months later, he was even willing to destroy Bizarro with blue Kryptonite, although this plan was eventually adopted by Lana. (Persona)\n\nClark's optimistic opinions and outlook on life may also be somewhat inherent: while amnesiac, he retained a positive attitude of the people around him. Clark can be impulsive and often acts before thinking things through, doing things without considering the real-universe repercussions or adverse outcomes, despite his good intentions.[29] Unsurprisingly, Clark has a hero complex, often trying to save lives at any and all costs. He has willingly risked his own life to save his loved ones and has, on many occasions, offered the Kents' home to individuals seeking refuge.[30] Clark has a temper which can come out when the people he loves are put into danger.[31] Clark is also very comfortable around children and enjoys situations in which he gets to be a \"big brother\" figure.[32]\n\nAdditionally, because he closely guards his secret, Clark can sometimes be dishonest. He often makes up lies to explain his sudden presence or absence as well as his knowledge of mysterious things. He seems slightly less mature than his friends, although this could be the result of his sheltered upbringing. Clark has also been known to complain, especially about his roller-coaster relationship with Lana.[33] His family and friends have repeatedly told him that he shouldn't bottle up his emotions until they get the best of him.[34] Clark has also shown to be somewhat of a workaholic, using work to cope or avoid his problems, or working unreasonably long hours.[35]\n\nClark has a few ironic traits to his personality: He is afraid of heights despite the fact that he can survive almost any fall, and is also habitually late despite being able to run at teleportation-like speeds. Finally, and perhaps most ironically, Clark highly values trust in a relationship, despite his constant lies to protect his secret. When it comes to secrets and lies, Clark is an enormous hypocrite. He lies and keeps secrets constantly from other people, but is outraged when secrets are kept from him. This increasingly evident when Chloe keeps someone else's secret from him, such as Davis or Lana, and he feels betrayed, despite her keeping his secret even from those closest to her. He is good at math, and his interests include playing football and basketball, astronomy and journalism.\n\nMost of Clark's personality traits and moral character are the direct result of his modest farm upbringing. Being very close to both of his parents, Clark was respectful, obedient, and highly valued their approval. Raised with a strong moral background, he does not like invasions of privacy, thinks the bad guys should be punished, and wants things to be fair. Clark is also hard-working and usually does not place much value in material possessions.[36]\n\nClark's relationship with Lois consists of bantering, a unique partnership, and the ability to understand each other's personalities. (Oracle, Siren, Pandora) Clark's relationship with Lois began with him being very irritated by her impulsive behavior to rush into situations and her rude, bossy attitude towards him. (Gone) Like with most people that Clark meets, he tries to find the good in people. He eventually discovered that under Lois's mask of sarcasm and witty banter lie a heart full of compassion, love, and dedication much like himself. (Lucy) It's interesting to note that while Clark denied countless times that he doesn't have feelings for Lois, everyone else around him (from his parents, Lana, Chloe, Lucy, Jimmy, Oliver, and Kara) could see that he did have feelings that were brewing beneath the surface.\n\nIt's not until he's infected by red Kryptonite (Crimson) that the feelings he has developed towards Lois over the course of their relationship were revealed to him by his passion and willingness to reveal his powers to her. Since joining the Planet staff as a reporter and being partnered up with Lois, Clark has grown to admire and respect her as well as come to the realization that he is deeply in love with her. The special bond they developed is clearly evident by Clark's ability to break free from Maxima's seductive entrancement which she reveals to Lois, as well as her ability to calm him down following Alicia's death. (Instinct) Lois caught Clark using his powers four times (Blank, Crimson, Infamous, Salvation).\n\nClark confessed to Lois that he feels emotionally stronger with her in his life. (Pandora) This is made clear when Clark resumed his Kryptonian training and believed that, if he cut ties with his humanity, he would be completely focused to protect humanity without any distractions. However, Clark discovered that he could not protect humanity fully by standing apart. He needed something to keep him connected so he turned to Lois with whom he found inner strength and a strong connection to as the Blur that just deepened his relationship with her as Clark even more.\n\nWhen Clark finally did tell Lois his secret, he found that she was not just a typical damsel-in-distress that needed his protection. Instead she was a major force to be reckoned with that could hold her own in any situation she came up against and expected Clark to treat her as his equal. (Harvest, Patriot) Clark admits to Lois that he always felt like an outsider, a freak until he met her who made him feel human. (Scion)\n\nRecently, Clark has fully begun his Kryptonian training and is much less emotional and more violent than before (although he still retains his humor while around Lois). He has also seems to have become much calmer during battles and resorts to more brutally offensive methods than he would have in the past. His willingness to use violence is further expressed when he put a witness in the hospital (Echo), lifted Tess off the ground by the throat and manhandled her while under no threat. (Kandor) Clark once told Zod to stay away from Lois, for she was off-limits, and threatened to destroy him and the Kandorians if Zod didn't leave Lois alone. (Disciple)\n\nClark's personality has also changed drastically enough since he first began his training that he no longer deals with the same inhibitions he did before. Red kryptonite no longer affects him in the same way because of this: while under its effects, Clark does not display the greedy and lustful tendencies he has in the past, because he no longer has to deal with those desires. Instead, he becomes simply more ruthless and violent. (Upgrade)\n\nPowers & Abilities[]\n\n\"That's why I'm lucky to have parents like you. Every time I woke up and had a new ability, you were always there to help me adjust and this time is no different.\"\n\n— Clark Kent, Arrival\n\nNormally, Clark's physical capacities are no greater than a normal human of his conditioning. However, once his body is charged by yellow sunlight, he possesses various superpowers. They have evolved and grown stronger to a degree as Clark has gotten older. As a Kryptonian, his cellular matrix stores solar energy for later use like a battery and his abilities usually appear suddenly and he must learn to control them. Clark stands as the most powerful being on Earth and one of the most powerful in the entire universe.\n\nIn episodes like Slumber, Labyrinth, Fracture, and Collateral, it is apparent that Clark's powers are tied to certain neuron pathways in his brain which activates his abilities. While Clark was kept asleep by Sarah Conroy, he didn't have his superpowers at first but, when the sun hit him at the end of his dream, he was able to use his heat vision ability to destroy the Traveler. After phantom Hudson entered his mind, Clark was unable to activate his powers but the Martian Manhunter, John Jones, was able to exorcise the phantom using his red crystal, allowing Clark to wake up. After Clark entered Lex Luthor's mind in order to obtain certain memories that would help him find Lois and Kara, he was seen powerless towards Lex, who easily picked him up with one hand, but Clark eventually found his way out of Lex's mind and managed to get back to to reality.\n\nSolar Battery: Clark's cellular structure allows him to absorb, store and metabolize the wavelength of yellow sun radiation to fuel all of his abilities. Direct exposure to sunlight will also accelerate his absorption rate. Having been constantly exposed to yellow sunlight and maturing with it since infancy has allowed him to store up energy in far greater quantities and metabolize it with equal efficiency than other Kryptonians. Emil theorized that if Clark enters into the Sun, his powers would become uncontrollable.\n\nSuperhuman Strength: Clark's chief physical ability is his vast superhuman strength. Direct exposure or contact with the rays given off by Earth's yellow sun, further magnify his strength. Clark, as a growing adolescent, was extremely strong, and as such, he would often be seen using his strength to help out around the Kent farm, by plunging fence posts into the ground, driving in nails with his thumb, lifting up tractors and other heavy machinery for his father Jonathan. Also, during this time, he would use this ability to stop rogue metahumans and save people all around Smallville, Kansas. He apparently, was aware of this power since the Kents found him in the field, and would on occasions, break tables and walls with his fists when he was little, until his parents taught him to never to use his powers in such a violent fashion. Clark was able to send Bizarro into Earth's upper atmosphere with just one punch: at the time, he was powered up from being in direct sunlight. Clark was easily able to catch a monorail train with no apparent effort and put it down carefully. Clark was easily able to tear off a limo car-door. After ripping the car-door from its hinges, Clark threw it to the side with tremendous force. While trying to rescue Lois Lane. Clark grabbed the Daily Planet globe in the air and was still able to soar higher, without losing any momentum or speed, even though the globe weighed more than a ton. Clark was able to effortlessly block and catch numerous attacks from Oliver, even though he was powered by Darkseid. He was capable of flying straight through Lionel-2's chest while Lionel was possessed and enhanced by Darkseid with no difficulty Then he was later able to save Lois and numerous government agents from crashing in a plane by lifting it back into position. He lastly was able to lift a full-sized planet rivaling Saturn in size and fly it into the upper atmosphere and back into space, showing no signs of strain in the process.\n\nSuperhuman Leap: Clark can combine his super strength and dexterity to perform highly accurate super leaps. The first time Clark jumped a vast distance, he displayed great hesitancy. Since then, he's shown increasing amounts of confidence and control over his super leaps. His \"super leaps,\" as of before, were a substitute for flying, as Clark had yet to fully learn how to fly. Clark was able to jump higher the older he became. Clark super leaps to Chloe's rescue after Zatanna's counter-spell blast her off the rooftop. (Warrior) Later he leaps onto a rooftop after saving Lois. (Charade) Clark super leaps off a cab to catch the Daily Planet Globe in mid-air though it can be argued that he also did some flying. (Lazarus)\n\nSuperhuman Speed: Clark can move and react at superhuman speeds that far exceed the speed of sound barrier, whether it is on land or underwater. Clark through accelerated vision perceives the entire Earth in slow motion. Clark is one of the fastest beings alive, with only speedsters such as Impulse capable of surpassing him in speed. Clark, as a growing adolescent, could run or move extremely fast, and would often be seen using this ability to rescue people in very tight situations. Even as a child, Clark could, as iterated in Transference, move fast, even more so than kids his own age, and even full adults, although he displayed signs of enhanced speed as a toddler. At first, Clark could travel around to places in Smallville in minutes, and as such, his movements could be perceived by his family and friends but not by those who were ignorant to his abilities. Later on, as he harnessed this ability and through years of practice, became too fast for anyone to follow and or detect, and even machines couldn't record his movement. In season 5, Clark can run from Metropolis to Honduras in seconds. (Void) By season 10, Clark can run on water (in season 4 Clark could not when chasing Bart) and was able to run back to Metropolis from London England in just 2 seconds. (Masquerade). Due to his supercharged brain, he can also think at an incredible pace, allowing him to read very fast and to retain great amounts of information all at once.\n\nClark Time / Accelerated Perception: Clark’s super speed also extends to his perception; his brain is able to process information at such high speeds that time appears to have slowed down, allowing him to perceive what would normally be moving too fast to see and respond accordingly. Also known as \"Clark Time\", it is when Clark Kent's perspective is shown when he's using his super speed ability. When he learned super speed, at age six. This ability grew significantly more powerful in eighth grade, where he was able to run from the Kent barn to the Smallville library and back before Chloe could turn around.\n\nInvulnerability: Under a yellow sun, Clark has an invisible force-field that renders him virtually invulnerable to any form of physical harm. Nothing earthly can penetrate it, bullets, knives, arrows, cars, lasers, lightning, all types of weather, such as tornadoes, etc. all bounce off or bend around it. Clark's skin is also much denser than a normal humans. Much like his speed and strength, Clark's durability capacity increased gradually as he gets older. When he was younger, he was immune to bullets, flames, cold temperatures, and all earthly diseases and sicknesses, and was able to collide with cars head on and come out completely unfazed. Also, due to the aura that surrounds Clark, even his hair is somewhat invulnerable to damage, as seen when Lana while possessed by Margaret Isobel Thoreaux, tried to cut his hair with a pair of scissors, and they snapped in half on contact. Now as an adult, along with still being immune to diseases, bullets, and temperature extremes; rockets/silos, bombs and lasers can't harm him in any way. He is now basically indestructible: even something devastating like an atom or nuclear bomb would have no effect on him. However, despite his invulnerability, forms of Kryptonite, magic, and certain alien weapons can still hurt him.\n\nSuper Healing: Clark possesses an accelerated healing factor, allowing him to heal or recover from most wounds instantly when he is not exposed to green Kryptonite. Direct sunlight greatly amplifies this capacity of this ability. (Alien)\n\nSuperhuman Stamina: Clark can run, exercise, or take part in strenuous action for days on end without getting tired: he never sweats unless he is exposed to green kryptonite (except season 2 episode 2 he sweat from temperature or because he sees Desirée Atkins).\n\nX-Ray Vision: Clark can see through any type of matter, except for lead, just by concentrating. It may appear as a skeletal image similar to the ones seen on hospital x-rays, or it may be a full color image. Originally, he appeared to have mastered the skeletal images over full color. Just recently, however, he has mastered both aspects of this ability.\n\nSuperhuman Vision: Clark's vision processes the entire electromagnetic spectrum as well as allowing vast control over selective perception and focus. This umbrella ability includes the following:\n\nElectromagnetic Spectrum Vision: Clark can visually perceive most of the electromagnetic spectrum. He can see and identify radio and television, as well as all other transmissions or transmitted frequencies. With this ability, he can avoid detection by radar or satellite monitoring methods. This also allows him to see the auras generated by living beings.\n\nMicro Vision: Clark has the ability to see things too small for the human eye to normally see. Clark uses his Microscopic vision to find ink residue on the body of a victim. Clark has referred to this ability as \"micro vision\". (Masquerade)\n\nTelescopic Vision: Clark has the ability to see people or objects from meters away (this power does not break the laws of physics: that is, they cannot see something that happens too far away as it happens). This ability operates independently of normal vision and can be activated or deactivated by an act of will.\n\nInfrared Vision: Clark is able to see heat signatures.\n\nHeat Vision: Clark's eyes can emit red beams of concentrated heat, which was first triggered by his level of sexual stimulation. Over time and training, he has learned to control and develop his heat vision. Clark can use this ability in a variety of ways: a straight beam of heat (for melting/welding/cutting objects), a ray of pure temperature (for heating but not destroying objects), a blast of solar energy (non-lethal for attacking enemies) and explosive bursts (for exploding objects similar to a grenade). He has fully mastered this ability.\n\nSuperhuman Hearing: Clark can hear indirect whispers, frequencies, pitches, and other volumes of sound from vast distances. As an adult, Clark can multitask and use super-hearing and can also super-speed and hear conversations while he's moving. Clark's super hearing may pick up things randomly (such as someone in trouble) or Clark can focus listen to as specific sound.\n\nSuperhuman Breath: With his superpowered lungs Clark can release strong pulses, currents, or waves of air by exhaling. He can break through probably anything with this power, being able to destroy concrete walls and doors, even blowing his barn door seven miles across Smallville.\n\nArctic Breath: He can freeze people and objects the same way. At age 19, Clark was vulnerable in the Phantom Zone and returned to Earth with super-strong sneezes.\n\nSuperhuman Dexterity: Clark is able to throw a basketball into a hoop yards away easily and he never trips. (Duplicity) When he failed to throw a football in a hoop, Martha was shocked and stated that she had never seen him miss before. (Jinx). As Clark was on the phone with Lois, he threw a can to the back of a crook's head with precise aim, ensuring that the crook would not escape from him. (Warrior)\n\nFlight: After he fully embraced his destiny, he gained the ability to fly, enabling him to hover, levitate, or transverse through the air at fast velocities. Clark has the ability to defy gravity by the manipulating his gravitational field. He has perfect control over this, he can move perfectly in any direction and also can levitate. Clark also has the ability to fly in outer space. Under his own power he can fly through space at planetary distances and to other galaxies. In a rather short amount of time, Clark has proven to have completely mastered this ability. (Finale, Part 2).\n\nLongevity: According to Jordan Cross, Clark will live for an extremely long period of time, explaining it as if he can \"go on forever.\" While under the light of a yellow sun Clark would age without appearing to do so. This power slows his aging process making him effectively immortal. Also, Jonathan and John Jones have stated that he may be immortal or at least very long-lived.\n\nEnhanced Mental Capacity: Similar to how Clark’s body is super enhanced, his mind is too. This gives Clark a perfect photographic memory and allows it to function faster and more efficiently than a human's. His brain can perceive and understand information at super speed.\n\nAccelerated Thought Process: Clark can process information at incredible speeds, allowing him to analyze and come to conclusions at an unprecedented rate and perceive everything at a faster time frame, such as when he managed to assess his parents' expenses by listening to them discuss their financial situation, calculating the answer in his head in seconds. This power allows Clark is able to come up with full plans in mere seconds. This also allows Clark to perform multiple separate tasks at once, as his brains can process multiple independent trains of thought/function at the same time and his body is able to perform them without interfering/overlapping with the other actions, meaning he can use multiple powers at once if he needs to.\n\nEnhanced Lung Capacity: Since all his organs are super enhanced like the rest of his body, Clark has an enhanced lung-capacity and through it, he can hold his breath for long periods of time and survive in space.\n\nClark can hear Kryptonian beacons, and is able to mentally interface with Kryptonian artifacts to order them to fly into his hand as Kal-El. He has also had a possibly precognitive dream relating to the arrival of the Black Ship, though this is not clear. Although he has not been heard speaking it, Clark has been fluent in written Kryptonian language since about age 15 (it is unknown if he can understand or speak spoken Kryptonian).[37] Jor-El gave Clark temporary telepathy in Echo as part of a lesson in his Kryptonian training. He used this to get closer to Lois by reading her thoughts and asking her on a date to where he now knew she really wanted to go, a monster truck rally.\n\nIntellect: Clark is quite intelligent despite his occasional over-reliance on his powers and frequent tendency to be impulsive. When he was 14, he managed to outsmart corrupt veteran cop Sam Phelan twice. The first is by making it so he is in possession of a confidential file and leaving him for the oncoming police when he intentionally tripped the alarm. Though Phelan forced Clark into a tricky position after this when he framed Jonathan for murder, the young Kryptonian managed to ultimately outwit him a second time by throwing a priceless breastplate out of the museum window for the authorities to find, noting that it would be impossible for Phelan to avoid any charges that time due to his DNA being on the artifact. Later, when Eric Summers had accidentally acquired his powers and began behaving out of control, a normal Clark bested him by deducing that he also acquired his vulnerability to kryptonite and by exploiting his other weaknesses of blind rage and vast inexperience with Kryptonian powers compared to Clark himself. Sometime after that, Clark had managed to come to the right conclusions concerning Lex's history with Club Zero and to figure out how Lana developed her visions after a pipeline exploded in addition to the fact that her kidnapper was a police officer. He was also instrumental in deducing that it was Sheriff Ethan Miller that framed his father and formulated a successful plan to lure and catch the corrupt lawman. Clark was also able to outdo Van McNulty when the latter learned his weakness to kryptonite by building a lead vest and also figured out that a phone call concerning Lana's death was made from the future based on recent weather forecasts and sporting events. While struggling against Zod's fighting skill, Clark ultimately out-thought the general by tricking him into getting absorbed back into the Phantom Zone. He was also able to successfully come up with a plan to separate Doomsday from Davis Bloome to bury the former underground and to coordinate with Oliver Queen to outfox Zod in order to escape the Phantom Zone.\n\nAdvanced Hand-to-hand Combatant: At first, Clark had no formal combat training but his superhuman physical abilities still made him extremely formidable, with even the most powerful of metahumans often being no real threat to him. While easily outclassed by more skilled and stronger (or equally strong but much more experienced) opponents, Clark showed himself to be not entirely powerless in close combat when without his powers, as he has developed a very powerful \"right hook\" and his regular physical condition can still easily equal and even surpass that of a highly strong human man, mostly due to his already muscular shape and peak-developed body; even displaying some intuitive fighting skill. He exploits the fact that no one expects him to fight back to land blows capable of instantly knocking his opponents out, which was surprisingly effective, as shown when he managed to subdue three metahumans, knock out any human opponent he fought with a single blow, and deal with many opponents during his time in the Phantom Zone. After fully immersing himself in his Kryptonian training, Clark became very proficient in hand-to-hand combat, which allowed him to equal, if not defeat, an adversary who would have previously easily outclassed him. This is later emphasized when he is able to defeat Alia, a highly trained Kryptonian soldier, relatively easily. This is emphasized even more when Clark is able to fight on par against Major Zod for an extended period of time despite Zod wielding a Kryptonian Knife, whereas the original Zod completely outclassed Clark before. He is also able to take out several of Zod's Gladiators as well as compete with Oliver Queen, a master hand-to-hand combatant, and almost defeat him while powerless in the Phantom Zone.\n\nSwordsmanship: Clark has proven that he's capable with a sword and shield, during his time within the Phantom Zone, when he fought Oliver Queen in Gladiator Match for Zod's amusement.\n\nMain article: Clark Kent's fighting style\n\nClark believes strongly in non-lethal combat, and has never directly killed anyone using his powers.[38] As a result, he has adopted a fighting style that depends largely on knocking opponents unconscious using his superhuman strength. He will sometimes combine these attacks with super speed, in order to remain anonymous or to sneak up on his opponents. He does use more force when battling more powerful metahumans, extraterrestrials and even supernatural beings.\n\nVulnerabilities[]\n\nMain article: Clark Kent's vulnerabilities\n\nDespite his nigh-invulnerability to harm, Clark can be still injured by various means.\n\nKryptonite: He is vulnerable to kryptonite, radioactive remnants of his home planet Krypton. The known variations of kryptonite affect him in different ways. Like Kryptonians, kryptonite is affected by Earth's yellow sun which gives these rocks abilities that greatly influence them. Clark can protect himself from kryptonite radiation using lead. Removal of the substance reverses the effects.\n\nGreen kryptonite: Green kryptonite is one of his greatest weaknesses. It renders Clark physically weak and mentally ill: the effects will make Clark weaker the longer he's exposed to its radiation. Sometimes and depending on the circumstance, he can use his powers while in its presence. (Jitters, Fever, Shattered, Resurrection: Crisis, Splinter, and Abandoned) He once stated that green kryptonite exposure hurts more than cracked ribs. While powerless, after getting thrown into a car windshield, his ribs were fractured, and he stated, \"I'd take this over meteor rocks any day of the week\", conforming to the statement made above. As Clark has gotten older and stronger, he seems to have developed some resistance or tolerance to green kryptonite, though he is still vulnerable to its effects.\n\nRed kryptonite: Red kryptonite affects Clark's mental state, removing his inhibitions and social conscience; the effects strengthen over long periods of exposure. Unlike the green variant, red kryptonite doesn't weaken him or physically affect him in any way, so he retains full use of his powers and abilities. When under the influence of red kryptonite, Clark usually refers to himself as \"Kal\", short for his birth name, Kal-El.\n\nBlue kryptonite: Blue kryptonite suppresses Clark's powers for as long as he is in contact with it, but otherwise does not cause him any physical or mental harm.\n\nGold kryptonite: Gold kryptonite can give Clark permanent scars that can't ever be healed. It is capable of permanently removing Clark ability to process yellow sunlight, which nullifies all superpowers.\n\nBlack kryptonite: Black kryptonite splits Clark from his Kryptonian persona, Kal-El.\n\nSilver kryptonite: Silver kryptonite induces paranoid delusions and hallucinations in Clark. Prolonged exposure can make him sweat, his eyes will start to dilate, his skin becomes pale. and his breathing becomes heavy.\n\nMagic: Clark's invulnerability provides no defense against magic, making it possible for magic users to render him powerless, erase his memories, cut through his invulnerable skin, and other possible effects.\n\nRed solar radiation: When exposed to the same red solar radiation as Krypton’s red sun Rao, it replaces the higher-yield yellow solar energy in Clark's cells, robbing him of the fuel for his powers and rendering him mortal.\n\nAlien beings: Certain alien beings can wound and even kill Clark. Aldar, Titan, and Doomsday were able to overpower and hurt Clark. At first, due to his internal darkness and doubts, Darkseid was capable of using him as a vessel, However, later on, Clark, with the help of Brainiac 5, harnessed and gained control of himself.\n\nAlien weapons: The Starblade was not only capable of harming Clark, but also negated his healing factor. A Kryptonian dagger could kill Clark if he was stabbed with it. The Persuader's atomic axe was able to wound Clark due to the atom-splitting properties of the metal. It appears that lesser extraterrestrial devices have no effect on him, as Clark was able to withstand a powerful energy beam released from the Blue Beetle suit unharmed.\n\nHigh-frequency noises: Because of his super hearing, Clark's ears are extra-sensitive to extreme noises such as Black Canary's sonic scream or Silver Banshee's banshee scream.\n\nLead: Clark can't see through lead or lead-lined objects with his X-ray vision.\n\nLimiters: Over the course of his life and acquisition of power under a yellow sun, Clark was taught how to place mental limiters on his own power. These \"limiters\" are used to keep his power in check so that he doesn't accidentally hurt innocent people. [citation needed] Though for him it is unknown that he has placed several of these limiters within his own mind, it is unknown how many and just how powerful he would be if he decided to release them all. They are the barriers that allow him to be human enough to live a normal life, and he only ever releases one or some of them when fighting a particularly powerful opponent or performing a predominately difficult task.\n\nEarly life[]\n\n\"You are my home, you're my family. You make me feel like I actually belong.\"\n\n— Clark to Kara Kent, Bloodline\n\nClark was born as Kal-El, the only son of Jor-El and Lara, on the planet Krypton. Kal-El was a few weeks old[39] when Krypton was about to be destroyed after his uncle Zor-El ignited Krypton's core and also due to General Zod's attempt to conquer its people, Jor-El placed Kal-El in a spaceship, to send him to a good family on the planet Earth where he visited years ago. Though Lara wondered if the people of Earth would accept and love him, Jor-El reassured her that the family he chose would be good to him.\n\nKal-El came to Earth during the meteor shower which struck the community of Smallville, Kansas, on October 7, 1989. He was sent from Krypton as an infant, but because of the distance from Earth, Kal-El appeared to be between the ages of two and three when his ship crash-landed. Jonathan and Martha Kent found him in Miller's Field: unable to have children themselves, the Kents adopted the young orphan and raised him as their son. Because he owed a favor from Lionel Luthor, Jonathan allowed him to produce forged paperwork that made it official. They arbitrarily picked a May 13, 1987 birth date for their new son and named him Clark, Martha's maiden name.\n\nClark formed a friendship with another farmer's son, Pete Ross in early childhood. He also was grade school friends with Greg Arkin and Abigail Fine.[40] Clark has been in love with Lana Lang for most of his life. Lana lived a mile away and while growing up, Clark used his telescope in his loft to spy on her. However, Lana almost always wore a necklace with a meteor rock charm on it. As a result, Clark could not even come into close physical proximity without being physically affected but never understood why. Clark met Chloe Sullivan in eighth grade and along with Pete Ross, the three formed an inseparable trio.\n\nClark was considerably stronger than other children at an early age. Martha noticed his strength the day she brought him home. He even cracked the kitchen table in half and occasionally put holes in the walls during tantrums. He once lifted a 500-pound bed frame as a toddler.\n\nWhen Clark had to read an essay at school in front of the entire class, parents and teachers, he was very scared but Jonathan convinced him to believe in himself and in what he had written, and gave three key phrases to get it right : \"Find your centre, stand your ground and speak your piece.\"\n\nBecause Jonathan and Martha did not want him to inadvertently injure other children, Clark was not allowed in playgroups or to play on sports teams as a child. His father also once mentioned that he was never allowed to play baseball with other kids. Indeed, in an attempt to protect Pete from a bully, he once threw the other child through a door. Clark developed super-speed around age six.[41] Jonathan and Martha taught Clark that his abilities were \"gifts\", but also that he should never tell anyone else about them. By the time he was 14, he knew that he was adopted, but he seriously began to question his strange powers and confronted his parents, demanding answers.\n\nSmallville TV Series[]\n\nSeason Eleven[]\n\nSix months later, Clark lives with Lois in their Metropolis apartment. He is no longer known as The Blur to the public, instead he is known by the name of Superman which was dubbed to him by Lois after he had saved humanity from Darkseid's Apokolips. At some point, after his public debut, Clark updated his Superman costume.\n\nAt home with Lois, Clark showers and brushes his teeth, talking with her about the energy ribbon - or \"aurora\" - that attacked the space station. As he then makes breakfast, he asks if they should return the wedding presents they received. Lois states that the wedding was postponed not cancelled, so they shouldn't have to.\n\nAs they lament their independently busy lives - he with saving the Earth, she with becoming a pre-eminent reporter - Lois mentions that the Russians have already announced they will be commissioning a statue of Superman to commemorate his saving of the space station. Clark expresses his discomfort at the hero worship, but Lois assures him that it is inspiring people, just as he wanted to do with the suit. Clark states that he'd like to finally tell the Earth that Superman is an alien. Lois counters that with all of the concern brought on by the pictures of the aliens on Apokolips, it might not be the best time, especially with Lex Luthor making such noise about it in public.\n\nRecently, he saved a Russian space station from a mysterious explosion. Later, in his mild-mannered disguise, Clark met Lex Luthor on the street. Lex introduced himself to Clark, because he doesn't remember Clark. Luthor only knows from the video clips that they were friends when they were young. He hardly recognized Kent. Clark is surprised that Lex knew that they were friends years ago. Lex doesn't understand how they could ever have been friends. Clark responded with: \"As you said, we were younger.\"\n\nMeanwhile Green Arrow patrols the city and arrives to the Port of Metropolis, in order to apprehend a crew of thieves who attempts to raid a shipping container.He's surprised by one of the goons who has climbed on top of a stack of containers and trains an RPG launcher on the Emerald Archer. Before Ollie can react, the goon fires. Just before the RPG strikes him, Superman zips into the area and stands in front of it, shielding Ollie from the hit and the explosion.\n\nSuperman knocks the crew out and ties the bunch together around a pole. A short time after, Ollie and Clark, now in street clothes, watch as Metropolis PD comes by to apprehend the thieves. Ollie's a bit surprised Clark didn't stay in costume to greet the police, joking that Superman is \"all about b standing around, shaking hands, kissing babies...\" As they walk off, Clark retorts that Superman has never kissed a baby. When Ollie asks if Clark Kent has, Clark mentions an exploding baby from his past. When Ollie exults about not having to experience such things when the Queens move to Star City, Clark expresses surprise that they haven't left yet. They were supposed to have left but Ollie says the hold-up is on his wife.\n\nIn space, Superman talks to Watchtower over their communication network, as he accesses the holo-computer in his belt. He is scanning for hints at the cause of the storm and finds none, noting he used his whole spectrum of Super-Vision. In S.T.A.R. Labs, Chloe and Emil discuss the development of Clark's powers. Emil states Virgil Swann founded the facility as a way to help The Traveler develop his abilities. Clark ask if they could have sent one of their Environmental Hazard Drones instead, and Emil apologizes for having to send Clark instead. Clark checks his belt buckle communicator and finds a message from Lois, telling him he is late for the conference, much to Clark's dismay. Clark then uses his superspeed and arrives to the conference and saw Lois asking Lex where he disappeared to after he was declared dead and before Tess's death which leads Lex to defend himself. Clark shows up and whispers to Lois that they both know Lex killed Tess, but can't do anything without proof. Lex then begins criticizing Superman and the Justice League, claiming they have failed to protect humanity and now the Earth is in more danger than ever. He announces the Guardian orbital defense platforms as a means of protection and the public is impressed, save for Lois and Clark. She ask who will pilot the Shuttle to bring the satellites into orbit on such short notice, and Lex introduces the pilot, Commander Hank Henshaw.\n\nClark interviews Hank Henshaw one last time before the LuthorCorp shuttle takes flight, as Hank eats a large meal, claiming it's apart of a superstition pilots like him share. Hank then makes a passionate quote about piloting, and how it helps him appreciate what he has on Earth, and says that Lex has given him a greater purpose, allowing him to pilot The Guardian Platforms into space. Clark claims that the world isn't as dark as Lex claims, and Hank mockingly ask if Clark is a Superman fan. Hank then claims that Superman is doing a good job, but should do more. Clark says that it's best Superman not impose his ideas on all. Hank says it's a good idea, but sometimes people need to be forced. Clark thanks him for the interview as Hank goes off to get ready.\n\nDuring takeoff, Lois tells Clark she has a bad feeling about the Guardian platforms, but Clark claims it might be a good thing, as Superman can't be everywhere at once, but Lois isn't convinced. Clark claims that Hank is trustworthy, but Lois claims Lex is still dangerous. Aboard the Shuttle, Hank begins leaving Orbit, when the ship begins experiencing problems. In mid-air, it explodes. Clark runs off and changes into his Superman suit, with Chloe guiding him from Watchtower. Superman catches up to the shuttle and sets out the fire caused by the explosion, and removes the last fuel tank before it explodes. Using his gamma vision, he's able to see that there is a radiation leak.\n\nSuperman has Chloe contact Commander Henshaw through LexCorp mission control, where he informs them that he can save them, but needs to pry open the shuttle as it will depressurize, but Henshaw insist that Superman save his crew members first, in order to pilot the shuttle into orbit as the shuttle is leaking radiation. But before Superman leaves to save the crew, Henshaw reveals a secret. Superman saves the crew and returns to the shuttle as the oxygen levels reach zero and Henshaw passes out.\n\nHenshaw wakes up on a stretcher, with burns from the radiation exposure. As the paramedics begin to transport him, Superman instructs them to send him to Emil at S.T.A.R. Labs. Lois comes up to Superman, hoping for a quote, but he instead tells her that Clark will not be home for breakfast, because the explosion was not a misfire.\n\nAt LexCorp Plaza, Lex arrives in his penthouse office, as Superman angrily breaks his glass window by clapping. Superman accuses Lex of activating the Guardian Platform mid-flight, but Lex dismisses the claim, saying the accident could have been avoided had the military not forced the private sectors hand. Superman accuses him again, nearly attacking him, until three military helicopters show up, demanding that Superman step away from Lex. Lex claims that Superman's appearance at the Korolyov and Guardian incidents, as well as his apparent attack of LexCorp Plaza, Superman had given Sam Lane a reason to intervene. The military tell him he is under arrest, but Superman refuses as the military ready their guns.\n\nSuperman is fired upon by the military helicopter under the orders of General Lane. During the confrontation Clark receives a call from Lois, whom he asked if her father knows his secret identity, saying that he had implied it before. Lois reassures him that if General Lane knew that he was firing upon his own son-in-law he'd probably wouldn't have fired at him. As they surround Superman they begin firing, Lois seeks cover under her convertible.\n\nThe bullets deflect off of Superman and hit the tail rotor of one of the helicopters,which begins to fall to the street below. Superman flies down and saves Lois before the helicopter crashes onto of her car, and explodes. High above in the clouds Lois is wrapped in a romantic embrace with Clark followed by a passionate kiss.\n\nSuperman then returns to downtown Metropolis where he proceeds to clean up the mess made by the military during their field test of his abilities before the arrival of the fire department where he leaves a calling card apologizing. Superman then meets with General Lane at Liberty park where they have a discussion about his recent heroics but also the fear members of Washington DC have against him as he has no real accountability to the government only to his moral code. Superman suggest to General Lane that he'd be up to going to Washington DC to meet with the President, just when he's suddenly summoned by Emil's signal watch to S.T.A.R. Labs. Emil informs Clark via his Bluetooth earpiece that Lex had transferred Hank Henshaw's mind into one of his EH drones however the process made his mind unstable.\n\nSuperman arrives at S.T.A.R. Labs. confronting cybernetic Henshaw who engages him in an intense battle of sheer super strength as Henshaw's cyborg body is able to adapt and counter any of Superman's abilities as he demonstrated by throwing Superman through ten buildings. Superman tries to reason with Henshaw after punches some sense into him.\n\nSuperman manages to disconnect Henshaw long enough to calm him down and returns him to S.T.A.R. Labs to an isolation unit where he is connected to a computer interface. Superman meets with Terri Henshaw informing her that he's made special arrangements for her to see her husband whenever she wanted too. Before he leaves Superman sees Henshaw who apologizes to him and asked Superman how he manages to do the right thing.\n\nThe next Morning in Metropolis, Superman pays a visit to Lex Luthor at LexCorp where he attempts to apologizes for misjudging him before on their last encounter . Only to discover that the Guardian shuttle incident was a no accident it was a means for Lex to coat Superman with an isotope radiation that he could track Superman's whereabouts anywhere on Earth with his satellites. Superman realizes what this means and angrily threaten Lex this isn't over as he leaves.\n\nFloating above the Daily Planet rooftop, Clark awaits for Lois who arrives hoping to find \"Clark Kent\" only to see Superman instead. Superman tells her that \"Clark Kent\" will be taking an extended leave of absence. He wouldn't risk leading Lex Luthor into their lives because he could track his whereabouts with the radiation. Lois is angry with this startling revelations and wants to hurt Lex. But Clark forbids it. Lois then suggest that Clark uses his Heat vision to destroy Lex's satellites but Clark says that isn't the answer either. Clark tries to comfort Lois but she is still uneasy about the whole situation, Clark reassures her that he'll find away to come back home to her. He kisses her tenderly then flies away.\n\nLater that night as the rest of Metropolis sleeps peacefully, Clark is floating above in space overlooking Earth and hears Lois's voice who reaffirms her love for him.\n\n3 weeks later, Clark and Lois are finally able to spend some time together, but they are still dealing with Lex tracking Clark. They are at the Fortress, and Oliver made sure one of his satellites blocked Lex's for one second so Clark and Lois could teleport to the Fortress without Lex knowing. Clark also revealed to Lois that after he completed his trials and made peace with Jor-El, his computer program ended. The fortress as well as the knowledge of the galaxies are now Clark's to use as he sees fit. So far Clark has used it to shield his radiographic signature from Lex's keyhole satellite and to find a way to remove the isotope from his system.\n\nThe Following Morning, Clark returns Lois to Metropolis and takes her directly to Daily Planet basement. He then files towards a hostage situation across town in which an unknown gunman has a group of children held hostage above within a bus. While the police attempt to handle the situation with diplomacy. Superman uses his Heat vision to disarm the gun from the assailant and quickly grabs him and pulls him out from the roof of the bus with his Super strength and holds unto him with a firm grip. Superman then turns his attention to the children and address a boy who previous attempted to be a hero by standing up to the gunman who pointed a gun at his face. Superman tells the boy not to be reckless especially around gun as they are not toys. Superman returns his attention to the assailant only to discover that he's got the ability of Teleportation and uses that ability to free himself and to fire at the police unit below using his Super speed Superman intercepted every bullet in his hand and converted it into a ball then handing it to Dan Turpin before pursuing the teleporter who stood on a nearby roof, Superman arrives and confronts him only to discover that he was using the hostage crisis to distract Superman from a robbery that was in progress and that he had placed a bomb on the crane holding the bus with children as an insurance to prevent Superman from touching him with a remote detonator. Superman uses his Arctic breath to freeze the teleporter in place then uses his heat vision to thaw his head while he interrogates him on who sold him the tech suit equipped with teleportation, The teleporter refusing to corporate, Superman uses his X-ray vision to see that the tech is from LexCorp .\n\nAfter he take care of the bomb, Superman round up the teleportation thieves who apologize to the children for kidnapping them, hitching their school bus up on a crane, and then trying to blow them up with a bomb. As Superman politely soars off with one of the teleportation vests, Dan Turpin meets Bruce Wayne and Barbara Gordon visiting Metropolis who got to see Superman in action first hand.Barbara is more impressed than Bruce is, or more impressed than Bruce is letting on. Bruce however reveals that it looks like Superman is taken.\n\nLater, at the Ace of Clubs, Lex and Bruce have their lunch meeting on the patio while Barbara Gordon is having lunch with Otis. Lex and Bruce's lunch however is prematurely ended by Superman.\n\nLater, at Lexcorp R&D, Superman and Lex are all forced friendly-like as Lex analyzes the teleportation vest and admits the technology is his, but it was stolen. Stolen, in fact, during a series of robberies made on Lexcorp and other companies, one of which was foiled way back by the Green Arrow and Superman. Lex surmises that whomever created these teleportation vests using all that stolen technology would have to be very familiar with Lexcorp's patents and proprietary coding. Which leads Superman to Stryker's Island prison and The Toyman. Safely incarcerated and seemingly not a suspect, according to Warden Draper, since he's been under constant supervision in \"hyper-solitary\". Superman is stymied. Meanwhile, imprisoned elsewhere at Stryker's is Bruno Mannheim, the head of Intergang, who's acting like a raving lunatic while palming the Crime Bible, which he says was given to him by G. Gordon Godfrey. Next thing we know, Mannheim has escaped his cell! Well, not so much escaped as being interrogated by The Batman. The Batman has Mannheim and he only wants to know where Joe Chill is. Mannheim claims he's gone straight, that the Crime Bible changed his life, and a lot of nonsense, but the Batman's having none of that. Next thing we know, Superman arrives on the scene.\n\nSuperman meets Batman and he wants to have a word with him. Instead, he gets Batman manifesting some sort of energy and then punched Superman. Batman and Superman do battle on Stryker's island. Batman with the advantage using red sun radiation generated from his suit. Superman discovers Bruce Wayne is Batman and manages to beat Batman and interrogates him on why he tried to free Bruno Mannheim, he said that he needed to find the man who murdered his parents. Superman is shocked and puts Batman down.\n\nMeanwhile, Green Arrow and Nightwing haven't gotten the memo from their respective bosses that they've reached a détente and it's time to stop fighting. Evenly matched, Arrow and Nightwing have spilled arrows and Batarangs all over the place trying to smack each other down. Superman arrives to break up the fracas when Bruno Mannheim pleads for sanctuary from the Man of Steel. Superman then snatches Mannheim and takes him up, up, and away for questioning.\n\nIn the sky, Superman says he's sorry to be using extreme measures on Mannheim. Mannheim doesn't know anything, but Superman points out he's lying, and knows his better half will have a talk to him over this. Just then, in front of the Batwing, Mannheim falls from above before Superman catches him below. Mannheim spills the beans: Intergang wanted to protect themselves from the invasion, Mannheim decided against it but offered Joe Chill to help them. But now, Chill is off the grid, rumored to be in FBI custody. Superman grabs the tracking device and asks Batman if he catches that. The Batwing storms off, Superman takes that as a yes.\n\nMeanwhile at the Daily Planet, Superman helps Lois find him in the sky by sparking his heat vision. After the talk over what he did to Mannheim, Lois confirms Chill is in FBI custody. As for Toyman being a suspect, the answer is no, but Lois learns that an Oswald Loomis did try to visit Toyman dozens of times before turning away. Superman wants to talk with Batman again, and has a way into contacting him.At a supply ship called Leviathan docked in Metropolis is an HQ for Batman and Nightwing, where inside they are getting medical treatment. The cameras pick up something and Bruce decides to head out alone, while Barb is in the Hub, when he looks outside to see what it is: the Bat-Signal.\n\nBatman arrives on the rooftop source of the signal to find Superman waiting for him. Superman knows enough about the Batman that this is the specific way to call a meeting with him. Superman also knows Batman and Nightwing located Joe Chill's safe house in Suicide Slum.Superman doesn't want Batman tearing through Suicide Slum hell bent on revenge for Joe Chill so he proposes \"a joint investigation mutually beneficial to both of us.\" They make sure Joe Chill is safe from Intergang and then find out who's manufacturing the weapons he's peddling and Batman agrees.\n\nAt Suicide Slum, Superman and Batman are on a stakeout. Batman is irritated by Superman's penchant for conversation but Superman seems to really be enjoying having a partner in crime fighting. Superman revealed that, he didn't want to draw attention to it and compromise Batman's security because he knows Lex Luthor is watching all his movements. Superman and Batman then scans the building and Batman's night vision goggles spot some extra snipers Superman missed when he bathed the building with X-rays. Batman then easily and stealthily penetrates the safe house and finds Joe Chill's room, though Superman beats him there with Super speed.At the safe house, Chill, a lifelong criminal, isn't exactly repentant about killing Batman's parents, whoever they were. Batman can't be specific and Chill has killed a lot of people for lots of reasons. This isn't good enough for Batman, who loses it, until Superman literally slaps him down. Superman calmly explains to Joe Chill that they're really here to find out where they can find a man named Loomis, who they believe is manufacturing the weapons Chill fenced for Intergang. But hey, they don't have to look very far because Loomis is already there! Batman and Superman spring into action with Heat Vision and Batarangs, but a burst of cold takes out both. Loomis isn't alone. He has help from Mr. Freeze.Superman and Batman are fighting Prankster and Mr. Freeze. Batman reveals that Mr. Freeze is Victor Fries. Prankster reveals that he wants to prove himself to Intergang. While Superman tries to distract the villains, Batman and Joe Chill try to escape. Superman gets shot by Kryptonite bullets while Mr. Freeze kills Joe Chill and frames Batman for the crime.\n\nBatman frees himself, and sees that Chill is dead, and Superman is critically wounded. Batman contacts Nightwing to inform her about Superman's condition. The FBI comes in to arrest Batman. Batman escapes with Superman within the Batmobile. Then Daily Planet reporter Lois joins the police and the FBI in the pursuit chase.Upon dropping off his last passenger, a bus driver doses off in the middle of the street, only to be waken up by the Batmobile going through his bus. News stations cover the pursuit of the \"murderer Batman kidnapping a wounded Superman\" just as Lois and Ollie meet up (wondering where Batman is taking Superman) and Chloe is hacking into the traffic system so no one is hurt during the chase.\n\nInside the Batmobile: Nightwing comments on the stress she's feeling over Superman being hurt and Batman being chased, just as Superman tells Batman to call him Clark and Batman, relieved that Clark is still alive, asks him who to call to save him. Nightwing calls Chloe, who in turn calls a choked up Lois: Nightwing gives her the situation: Superman has four Kryptonite bullets, none to the heart, but his vitals are fading. Nightwing, later, gives Batman Lois' message: get the Kryptonite out, and then expose Superman to yellow sunlight. But as Batman says, he's already has his hands full.A road block is set up, with cops surrounded, so Batman can't \"go through it\" like before, so he comes up with a different idea. Shifting the front tires to a \"X\" position, and firing the boosters from below, the Batmobile literally goes around the road block from above. The cops, and even Lois and Ollie, can't believe what they saw. A helicopter approaches, with an EMP on board, and Batman knows this and but can't do anything about it, until Ollie messages him that he can. Ollie simply \"pops up\" to the helicopter, and it goes away. Nightwing takes control of the Batmobile, leading it outside the Leviathan ship. Batman performs the surgery inside the car, just as Lois arrives and she sees it happening. After getting the bullets out, Batman reprograms his vest and splash Clark with yellow sunlight, just as the police report that they lost the Batman. Chloe is relieved that it's over, but Batman and Nightwing respond that it isn't: they need to make sure that the authorities know it was Freeze and Prankster who killed Chill. Ollie agrees, but also asks for his lawyer to be called too (he's been arrested).\n\nInside Leviathan: Clark wakes up with Lois by his side, where Lois reveals the Earth still thinks Batman killed Superman, and she can't help but be tempted by the huge story she's been given: Batman isn't a myth, and is Bruce Wayne. Barbara Gordon, introducing herself to the two, gives Clark some orange juice before he heads out to speak with Bruce, who is hard at work at the armory. Bruce asks why Clark hasn't destroyed Lex' satellite, but Clark points out Lex would build more, and that he prefers hope and inspiration over fear and brute force (in a way, criticizing Bruce's Batman). Bruce tells Clark that he's been having a hard time finding Prankster and Freeze, because Freeze needs to be in extreme colds to survive: Clark points out the Hobbs River as an idea, but the list is too big. Then Clark has an idea: use Lex' tracking from himself to read other types of radiation, like Kryptonite. Bruce tries that, and then successfully, finds the villains' location. Given Clark's weaknesses, and Bruce still being human who can't survive colds 40 below: Bruce reveals what he has built: armored suits for Superman and Batman to fight in. In order to still keep a low profile, the two heroes head out into the sewers with another one of Batman's vehicles: the Batboat.\n\nAt Freeze's hideout: Superman and Batman find no one there, at least until Prankster appears using a robotic suit Toyman was developing, complete with Kryptonite on the chest. He reveals that Freeze is under his control, and is attacking the citizens, but in actuality, his suit's fuel cells are overloading, and will explode. And with Freeze above the city's water purification plant, anyone within one mile will die. Batman heads out in the Batboat to take care of Freeze, while Superman goes to handle Prankster.\n\nIn Metropolis, the next morning, Lois Lane talks to Superman about the news headline of today. Superman and Batman have been hailed as heroes by the Daily Planet, labeled World's Finest in the paper. In Gotham, Superman speaks with Bruce Wayne about his (Bruce's) parents. Bruce puts the flowers down and reveals that he and Superman are at the spot where his parents died. Bruce and Superman agree to work together if necessary.\n\nLater on the moon at the construction site for Queen Industries' new Moon Base, Clark and Martian Manhunter oversee the construction which the S.T.A.R. Labs H.E.D drones help in the process. Clark shares some Double Stuff Oreo cookies with his friend and mentor when he receives an alert about an attack on Metropolis involving a former Project Ares subject. As Superman speeds off to deal with the threat, J'onn decides to return to his apartment in Metropolis.\n\nOut in the streets of Metropolis, a Dr. Jones who wants to be called Psimon is looking for Lex, whose Project Ares has apparently given the diminutive doctor his purple skin, an oversized and glowing-through-his-skull brain and some kind of indeterminate psycho-molecular power. Psimon is not convinced a peaceful resolution to this situation is possible and shoots a purple blast at Lex, whom Superman saves and proceeds to returns to finish with Psimon, who proves to be able to act more quickly than Superman thanks to his enhanced synaptic firing. As he tries to capture Psimon, the criminal's telepathic abilities allow him to \"feel\" Superman's moves before he makes them and counteract them. Moving faster than thought, Bart arrives to help his old friend. The speedster, sporting a new costume, proves too quick for Psimon and is able to punch him into submission.To celebrate, Impulse speeds ice cream cones into the hands of all the nearby citizens, including Superman.\n\nOut in the ocean, Clark and Bart race each other above the water. Bart comments on Clark running slower than he used to, which Clark attributes to now having the ability to fly as well. Clark makes a wager that he can fly faster than Bart can run with the loser paying for lunch. As the two rocket over the coast of Cameroon, a young woman watches from a distance.\n\nClark arrives in Mumbai, India, assuming that he has beaten Bart. As children swarm him for an autograph, he finds that Bart was not only there first but is playing a game of soccer with some of the locals. Later, as they share food, Clark describes how he can't return to his life as Clark Kent and must remain Superman for the time being due to Lex's irradiation ploy. Research from S.T.A.R. Labs has revealed that his healing ability from the rays of the sun is slowly curing the radiation. Bart suggests he fly into the sun to speed up the process and burn the rest of it away, but Clark tells him that Emil isn't sure they could stop the process from eventually turn him into raw energy if he tried it.\n\nThough he's happy to spend some time with Bart, Clark points out that it's not really the speedster's style and asks if something is wrong. Bart deflects by saying he had to get a glimpse of Clark in a costume. A moment of appreciation between the two is broken up by a call from Chloe at Watchtower. She tells them that a situation with art thieves in Paris has arisen and, as they don't have any agents in Europe as of yet, they are the two closest to respond. They make another wager over who can get there first. Bart gives Clark a head start and his friend bolts into the sky. As he prepares to run, Bart hears an ominous voice call his name. He looks around but sees nothing but the locals. Tapping into the Speed Force, he runs after the Man of Steel.At the Musée du Louvre in Paris, Superman and Impulse arrive to help the French police with a chaotic scene, baffled at the threat art thieves are presenting. Suddenly, a huge explosion racks the front of the museum. Out of the rubble runs Monsieur Mallah, a giant gorilla carrying the Mona Lisa. In a container slung around Mallah's back is the brain of the scientist who increased Mallah's intelligence to genius levels. The two lead a gang of monkeys and apes stealing art.\n\nAs Impulse attends to the smaller primates, Superman turns his attention to Mallah and the Brain. The Brain can speak through the container and Superman asks if he is Mallah's. Brain explains that they are lovers and helped each other escape from the experimentation that led to their current states. They plan to sell the stolen art to fund and form their own nation. Mallah pulls a gun and fires at the crowd.\n\nImpulse runs to catch some of the bullets but sees there are too many. He taps into the Speed Force to move faster and is able to stop all of the projectiles. Using the Force, though, brings on the mysterious voice again. In Speed Time, Bart sees a horrifying dark creature run out of the Force that he's seen before, telling him that \"It is time.\" The creature bolts toward Bart, reaching out to grab him.\n\nMeanwhile, Superman uppercuts Mallah off of his feet, knocking him out. He turns to find the other monkeys and apes massing toward him. Winding his arms up and bringing his hands together in a superclap, Clark uses the force and the sound of the clap to upend all of the primates and knock them unconscious.\n\nClark finds a tired and scared Bart on his knees, muttering that \"it\" almost got him. Looking around the scene, Clark asks what Bart is talking about. Realizing the creature is nowhere to be found—and wanting to keep the secret to himself—Bart tells his friend it was nothing.\n\nFlying over the Atlantic, Clark carries Bart, who told him about the creature, refusing to let him use superspeed to avoid being captured by it in the Speed Force. Bart then mentions the \"Speed Demon\" or \"Black Racer\" has always waited for him at every turn when he used his superspeed, after which he explains in detail what really happened years ago during the time he was captured by Lex. With the creature always present ever since, Clark asks why Bart wanted a race to India in the first place. Bart admits that, since Clark is the only one who can come close to keeping pace with him, he hoped that by the two going so fast and Clark not seeing the demon, he could prove it was all in his head. Clark assures his friend that he's not crazy. He states that they need to find a way for Clark to face the creature and make it stop tormenting Bart once and for all.\n\nAt S.T.A.R. Labs, Emil Hamilton meets with his staff to discuss two problems before them: one, assisting Superman in finding a way to help Impulse with the dark creature; and two, aiding Watchtower in retrieving the technology that LexCorp used to transfer Hank Henshaw's consciousness from his charred and crippled body into one of the H.E.D. drones. Emil states he will address the technology issue and assigns the others to Impulse's case.The scientists at S.T.A.R. Labs set Bart and Clark up for a speed assessment. As Bart chats up a lovely blonde scientist, Emil asks Clark how he's able to be so jovial. Clark answers that Bart probably welcomes any distraction from being chased by the creature as long as he has. With everything set, Bart wonders how Clark will manage to match his speed, considering he runs a lot faster than Clark. Emil explains that the treadmills they are using for the assessment had been specially designed with a frictionless engine assembly when they began testing Clark's abilities. This will allow Bart to run as fast as he can while Clark's treadmill will accelerate him towards Bart's speed. They all hope that if they can get Clark fast enough, he can witness the creature as well.\n\nAs they run, Clark encourages Bart to go full speed, insisting that he has his friend's back. With approval, Bart taps into the Speed Force and runs so fast that he causes the treadmill and the monitoring equipment to explode. As Clark falls to the floor, while in the Speed Force, the horrible creature towers over him, chastising his speed as \"not pure.\" Outside of the force, Bart asks Clark if he was able to see the demon. Now knowing what he is dealing with, Clark assures his friend that he will find a way to save him.\n\nClark and Lois meet on the roof of the Daily Planet Building for a bite to eat and further lament that he can't return to his \"normal\" life as a mild-mannered reporter. She mentions that he has burned through all of his sick days and vacation time and that their boss, Franklin Stern, is getting suspicious about his absence. Joking about having to tell him Clark's become a fireman or something else, Clark admits that he's devoted his life to bigger things now.\n\nRegarding one of those things, Lois shows Clark pictures of the LexCorp employee, Fritz, who was thrown into a wall and superspeed aged to death at the ruins ofLuthorCorp's abandoned Ridge Facility. She shows him pictures of other incidents of it occurring over the past five years. She says that these \"speed storms\" have popped up in Keystone City, Mexico, Miami, and islands in the Pacific Ocean, and have been increasing in frequency. Clark immediately recognizes each as places Bart has been and that the storms are chasing him like the dark creature. Clark worries that he won't be able to find a way to help Bart when Lois points out that he should consult someone else who has run as fast as Bart before.\n\nThey are interrupted by Jeff and Clark superspeeds into the sky. Later, Clark and Bart visit the JSA Brownstone, being tended to by a Mrs. Hunkel. She lets them past the security measures and Clark takes Bart into the museum honoring the members of the Justice Society of America. Bart recalls that this was Carter Hall's group but wonders how any of the artifacts will help them with his problem with the \"speed demon.\" Clark explains they are there to begin a search for the first hero to break the sound barrier on foot, Jay Garrick.\n\nOn the soccer field in Mumbai where Bart played with the kids earlier, one of the speed storms breaks out. Another hits at Louvre in France. Chloe and Oliver monitor the outbreaks at Watchtower and note the increasing frequency. Oliver relays this to Clark while Clark asks how Chloe is doing following her procedure. Oliver assures him that he's looking after her.\n\nClark and Bart walk the white plains of Utah until they come upon an isolated house. An old voice asks if he can help them and Bart reveals they are looking for Jay Garrick. The man at the end of the voice steps from the house and identifies himself as Garrick.\n\nAt Garrick's house, the old man chastises Bart for stealing his identity. He asks him he did it and Bart admits that he doesn't know. He also reveals that he doesn't remember anything of his life previous to waking up with his abilities, just that there was a flash of light and the names of Garrick, Wally West, and Barry Allen just appeared in his head. Clark explains to Garrick the plan Carter Hall had of resurrecting the Justice Society of America with the help of the new, younger heroes. He asks for the elder's help.\n\nGarrick suggests Bart talk to his old teammate, Pieter Cross, instead. Impatient, Bart asks what the old man knows about the \"Black Racer.\" The elder speedster tells them his leg was broken when the federal government tried rounding up the JSA and he never wanted it repaired. When Clark attempts to ask why he would never want to run fast again, Bart correctly guesses that he's seen the demon. Garrick admits to it and explains that what is occurring to Bart happened to him. Clark mentions the speed storms and Garrick says it's the racer calling Bart out. Bart asks how the old man survived it and Garrick reiterates that he just stopped running. Bart adamantly refuses that option and the elder tells him the only other option is to die.\n\nAs the speed storm crackles in Utah, Clark tries to reason with Jay Garrick that there must be another option to help Bart. Garrick asserts that there is no choice in the matter and that by using the Speed Force, the demon is there to collect the debt. Clark asks why there were no records of speed storms while Garrick was with the JSA. The old man surmises that Bart is so fast that it has made the creature hungry and desperate. Picking up on the thought, Clark reasons that it is sending out the speed storms to try to create a new speedster to take on as its prey. Bart realizes that the biology of the speedsters is special and that's why so many have died in the attempts.\n\nBart asks Garrick how many speedsters there are. The old man gives a mealy answer about not being the first and Bart not being the last. Bart confronts him about not having raced the demon himself to stop to have possibly stopped it, and Garrick denounces their abilities as a curse. Clark offers that curses can be blessings if they don't let their powers control their lives. Garrick likens Clark to Carter Hall and Bart jumps on the moment to call him out for not having stayed in touch with his team. The old man owns up to being proud of how he acted, but it's not good enough for Bart. Riled up, he starts tapping into the Speed Force before Clark manages to stop him.\n\nClark fields communication from Chloe at Watchtower. He asks how she is and she tells him she's coping. She alerts him to a speed storm brewing in Las Vegas, a huge one that isn't slowing down and many dying. Clark relays the message to Bart, who tries running off on his own. Clark grabs him and Bart argues that the racer is waiting for him there and is calling to him. Clark tells Chloe that they didn't come up with a solution. She responds that S.T.A.R. Labs might have something. Patched to Emil Hamilton, the doctor explains they took the concept of sending Clark into the sun to remove his irradiation to fashion a containment suit. He states that they modified the suit to collect speed energy and that Clark might be able to use it to constantly move fast enough to confront the demon.\n\nThe scientists at S.T.A.R. fire a pod into the atmosphere and it quickly rockets its way to the young heroes' location in Utah. The pod opens to reveal the new suit, a black and silver affair with a glowing S-Shield. Clark quickly puts on the suit and speeds to the massive storm in Las Vegas. Boldly, Clark proclaims to the demon that it's \"time for round two.\"\n\nIn Las Vegas, Clark Kent saves a man from becoming another victim of a speed storm. He cannot save everyone but he does save as many as he can. Superman stops the speed storms and has everyone evacuate. An angry Black Flash, seeing that Superman is trying to stop him, decides to kill him. Superman and Black Flash begin to fight.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Superman continues to fight the Black Flash. Just as Black Flash seems to be gaining the upper hand just as Bart arrives, prepared at last for the final showdown and his reckoning with the speed force.\n\nBlack Flash, finally satisfied that Bart arrive getting to feed on \"Pure\" speed. Bart then rush to take Clark out of the fight and proceeds to absorb the Speed Force out of Clark's containment suit. Clark tries to talk Bart out of taking on the Black Flash with Impulse revealed that the speedsters he met with told him that he was the only one who can take him down. Bart then confides in Clark that he never been alone, and then rushes to take down Black Flash. Clark then proceeds to try to catch up and help Bart.\n\nBart rushes to Black Flash with Clark trying to convince him to slow down. They both flashback to back when they first met as teenagers back on the barn. Bart, who thanks Clark for looking out for him. He says he's going to explore the world, and invites Clark to come. Clark asks him to stay, and Bart slyly says he'd consider it... if Clark can catch him. The two superspeed down the roads of Smallville, but Bart easily leaves Clark in the dust.\n\nThere is soon a big Speed Force explosion that took out both Bart and Black Flash out leaving a giant lightning bolt in the desert with Clark mourning and forced to tell Watchtower that Impulse is gone.\n\nSometime later at the JSA Brownstone, Clark and Jay look at the first Impulse Suit in the glass case. Jay Garrick feels somber about what happened saying Bart did what he should have done a long time ago. Clark tells Jay that everything end no matter what and Bart would have never stopped running, as long as you're running towards something. Abigail Hunkel and Emil came in to pay their respects. After Abigail and Jay left to get some tea and leave Clark and Emil to talk. Emil reveals that the speed force Bart exposed Clark to might have had an unforeseen effect.\n\nLois sits at their apartment asking Clark if their going to hold a funeral like they did for Carter. Clark replies he will also build a statue for Bart. He then asks if he found anything about Lex with Lois saying considering how the night has went it's pretty much a win and she'll tell him after his next flyby. Clark replies he doesn't think he will be doing that anymore.\n\nThen there is a knock on the door and as Lois opens it, there is Clark in his glasses and suit and tie simply saying \"Honey, I'm home\". As they embrace Lois wonders how is this possible, with Clark replying thanks to Bart's speed, the radiation is removed. Lois then tells his get back into the suit because they have work to do.\n\nAt LexCorp Plaza, Lex heads towards his office only to find that the lights aren't working. As he calls for Otis, Superman appears with Lex realizing that he found a way to remove the radiation off him. The Green Arrow appears revealing they are here to take Tess back. Then Lois appears surrounding Lex. As Green Arrow is about to use a taser arrow, Lois slaps Lex knocking him unconscious. As he wakes up, He is help by Otis. He realizes what the heroes did, he asks where is Tess.\n\nAt Watchtower, Clark, Lois and Oliver stands patience as Emil downloads a grateful Tess into a computer system making her a hologram. Clark wonders where Chloe,Oliver reveals she's outside waiting to reveal something to him. Chloe tells Clark about the Monitors and then she tells Clark about the baby she is about to have. As Clark understands and accepts Chloe's decision to leave to start a life with Oliver for the sake of their child. Clark is overjoyed and takes Chloe on a flight, she later reveals that she and Oliver needs to leave so the baby can come safely to term with Clark understanding since that is what both Jor-El and Lara as well as Jonathan Kent and Martha Kent did for him.\n\nBack at the apartment, Lois and Clark are in the shower with Clark washing her hair. Clark wonders if Lois would be alright in Africa and if he should go with her to check on the vigilante known as the Angel of the Plateau. Lois reminds him that Franklin Stern is watching him closely now that he returned from his extended leave. She asks if Clark would be alright after what just happened with Bart, and Clark says he will but he wonders how many more people do they have to loose. Clark then proceeds to take care of an apartment building on Russell and Glosson.\n\nAfter Clark takes care of the f"
