        "text": "TITLE: Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nDirectors: Ian Bonhôte, Peter Ettedgui\n\nLogline: Never-before-seen home movies and extraordinary personal archives reveal how Christopher Reeve went from unknown actor to iconic movie star as the ultimate screen superhero. He learned the true meaning of heroism as an activist after suffering a tragic accident that left him quadriplegic and dependent on a ventilator to breathe.\n\nSales Agent: Cinetic Media\n\nPanelists: Ian Bonhôte (director); Peter Ettedgui (director); Alexandra Reeve, Contributor/Christopher Reeve’s Daughter; Matthew Reeve, Contributor/Christopher Reeve’s Son; William Reeve, Contributor/Christopher Reeve’s Son\n\nFirst screening: Sunday, Jan. 21\n\nKey quotes: “With 2024 being the 20-year anniversary of our father’s death, that felt like the right time to reintroduce him and his heroic story to the world. And as we met the folks at Passion Pictures and Misfits Entertainment, and Ian and Peter and our friends at Words + Pictures, we knew we had the right team. Everything came together in a way that we knew as a family we could be open and honest and vulnerable and hand everything over to them and see what they came back with. And that trust has been rewarded in a way that we’re just so thrilled about and can’t wait for the world to experience as well.” — Will Reeve, Christopher Reeve’s son\n\n“There are so many different parts of his personality and his passions that come through in the film. He was dedicated to his craft, of course, before the accident, but also after being able to return to acting and directing and showing that a disability wouldn’t hold him back. So that legacy of what it is to care about your career and keep moving even after overwhelming obstacles is one key part of it. But the other part is his life as an advocate. He was an activist again before the injury. And then after the injury, of course, he became known around the world for his advocacy, for medical research and for disability rights.” — Alexandra Reeve, Christopher Reeve’s daughter\n\n“They bare their soul on the screen. And I think that’s rare as well, that people were so ready to go to places and to share with the world and to expose some vulnerability. And I think if you want to get close to an icon and a person, you need people to accept, to share and to let you in their own life because it’s their legacy. Christopher lives through those three lovely people [Matthew, Alexandra, and Will]. So I think that I want to point out again that the film would not have been what it is without them, the trust they gave us.” – Director Ian Bonhôte\n\nThe Deadline Studio at Sundance runs January 19-22 at 608 Main Street, when the cast and creatives behind the best and buzziest titles in this year’s lineup sit down with Deadline’s festival team to discuss their movies and the paths they took to get to Park City."
