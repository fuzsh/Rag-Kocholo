        "text": "Christopher Reeve\n\nActor, Director,\n\nand Activist\n\n1952-2004\n\nPhoto by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders\n\nActor, director, and activist are just some of the words used to describe Christopher Reeve. From his first appearance at the Williamstown Theatre Festival at the age of 15, Christopher established a reputation as one of the country’s leading actors.\n\nWhen he became paralyzed in an equestrian competition in 1995, Christopher motivated neuroscientists around the world to conquer the most complex diseases of the brain and central nervous system while he put a human face on spinal cord injury.\n\nIn 1999, Christopher was appointed as Chairman of the Board of the Christopher Reeve Foundation, which later became the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation after his wife’s untimely passing.\n\nThe Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation is dedicated to curing spinal cord injury by advancing innovative research and improving quality of life for individuals and families impacted by paralysis.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Reeve Foundation grew to become the preeminent spinal cord injury and paralysis foundation that it is today, funding some of the earliest discoveries in basic science and debunking the centuries-old dogma that the spinal cord could never be repaired.\n\nWhile the world knew him for his incredible role as Superman, those who knew him personally remember him to be so much more than an exquisite actor.\n\nChristopher was an extraordinary father, a loving husband, a human rights advocate, an avid adventurer, an environmentalist, an author, a director, and an accomplished pianist. He was also a pilot who had made two solo trips across the Atlantic, a outdoor enthusiast who skied, sailed, scuba dived, played tennis, and canoed alone into the wilderness.\n\nIn 1985, at the age of 33, Christopher began horseback riding and by 1989 was competing in events, which included cross-country jumping. On May 27, 1995 Christopher injured his spinal cord when he fell from his horse during a competition.\n\nAfter months of grueling rehabilitation and therapy, Christopher returned home with new purpose. He delved into ways he could use his name, his celebrity and his voice to urge the scientific world to work faster and harder; to help the patient community be heard and improve their quality of life; and to impact legislators to increase federal funding for spinal cord injury research.\n\nChristopher’s generosity in spirit was infinite and resonated through all those he touched. He conveyed his valiancy through his passion for his work and how he chose to live his life. As a result of his courage, determination, international renown, and his conviction that ‘nothing is impossible,’ Christopher initiated a sea change.\n\nChristopher Reeve died October 10, 2004, of heart failure. He was 52 years old. Christopher is survived by his children Matthew, Alexandra, and Will, all of whom are actively involved with the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation\n\nActing and Director\n\nAfter graduating from Cornell University in 1974, Christopher pursued his dream of acting, studying at Juilliard under the legendary John Houseman.\n\nHe made his Broadway debut opposite Katharine Hepburn in A Matter of Gravity in 1976 and then went on to distinguish himself in a variety of stage, screen and television roles with passion.\n\nFilm credits include: Superman in 1978 and its subsequent sequels, Deathtrap, Somewhere in Time, The Bostonians, Street Smart, Speechless, Noises Off, Above Suspicion and the Oscar-nominated The Remains of the Day. Stage credits include: The Marriage of Figaro, Fifth of July, My Life, Summer and Smoke, Love Letters and The Aspern Papers.\n\nChristopher made his directorial debut with In the Gloaming on HBO in April 1997. The film was met with rave reviews, was nominated for five Emmys and won six Cable Ace Awards, including Best Dramatic Special and Best Director.\n\nHis autobiography, Still Me, was published by Random House in April 1998 and spent a staggering 11 weeks on The New York Times Bestseller List. His audio recording of Still Me earned Christopher a Grammy for Best Spoken Word Album in February 1999.\n\nHis second book, Nothing is Impossible: Reflections on a New Life, was published by Random House in September 2002. The audio rendition of Nothing is Impossible garnered Christopher his second Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album.\n\nIn his first major role after becoming paralyzed, Christopher starred in an updated version of the classic Hitchcock thriller Rear Window, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries. He also served as executive producer of the film.\n\nChristopher’s ongoing directing work in television and film as well as his arts-advisory service also continued as a board member of the Williamstown Theatre Festival. In early 2001, he began combining his directing efforts with his activism, through such projects as directing four Johnson & Johnson commercials featuring Ray Romano, Randy Newman, Toni Morrison and himself for the company’s “Talk to Your Kids” campaign. The same year he filmed a spot for the American Red Cross that celebrated volunteerism.\n\nIn August 2004, Christopher completed directing The Brooke Ellison Story. This fact-based A&E cable television movie, which aired October 25, 2004, is based on the book Miracles Happen: One Mother, One Daughter, One Journey. Brooke Ellison became a quadriplegic at age 11 but with determination and the support of her family, Ellison rose above her disability and went on to graduate from Harvard University. The film stars Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Lacey Chabert and John Slattery."
