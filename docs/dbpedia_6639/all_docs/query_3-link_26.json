        "text": "Space Quest\n\nFed up with a lack of privacy at home and at work, Frasier decides it's time for his father to move out.\n\nRosetta\n\nDetermined to find out where he came from, Clark travels to New York to meet Dr. Virgil Swann (Christopher Reeve - \"Superman\" movies), a brilliant scientist who possesses a message for Clark from his home planet. Meanwhile, Lana decides to move out of Chloe's house--and into the Luthor Mansion -- after the two girls get into another argument about Clark.\n\nLegacy\n\nWhen Jonathan acts strangely, Clark believes that his Kryptonian father, Jor-El (voice of Terence Stamp - \"Superman II\"), is sending Jonathan messages and is the cause for his father's withdrawal from the family. Clark goes down to the caves to confront his biological father, but Lionel finds Clark there and begins putting the pieces together--leading him straight to reclusive scientist Dr. Virgil Swann (recurring guest star Christopher Reeve), who knows Clark's origins. As the two billionaires face off, a deal is struck, and Lionel's true motives are revealed.\n\nProfessor Grover's Superhero School\n\nWelcome to superhero school! Professor Groverâs star pupils include Super Guitar Girl (Rosita) and Super Tutu (Zoe). To graduate, all they need to do is save the day. Also in this episode: Christopher Reeve (Superman) recites the alphabet with Ernie and Rubber Duckie, and Big Birdâs âJourney to Ernieâ takes him to Chilly, Icy Snowyville. Brought to you by the letter H and the number 13."
