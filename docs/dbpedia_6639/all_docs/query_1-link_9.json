        "text": "Here is a poem by American poet Franklin D'Olier Reeve, known as F. D. Reeve, (September 18, 1928 – June 28, 2013), American academic, writer, poet, Russian translator, and editor.\n\nHe was also the father of actor Christopher Reeve. Reeve published over two dozen books of poetry, fiction, criticism, and translation.\n\nAutumn Song\n\nSeptember again. In the rain the autumn leaves\n\nare brown like old bronze Chinese coins.\n\nThe students lust for experimental encounters\n\nas if the future must burst from their loins.\n\nBrave bold new women with long golden hair\n\nwho wish their beardless lovers true,\n\nas you sit down to put your make-up on, remember\n\nwe all were once as young as you.\n\nHandsome runners for the Olympic flame\n\nwhom Pindar praised and Housman glorified\n\nrelent, lest youth be all-victorious\n\nand history die on the losing side.\n\nSweet scholars shivering at your desks,\n\nafraid you know less than we knew,\n\ncite not our title but the fact:\n\nwe all were once as young as you.\n\nDespite the failures and mistakes,\n\nthe cycle has compelling charms:\n\nthe old rewriting their lost books,\n\nthe young asleep in each other’s arms.\n\nAnd you who keep your own September,\n\namong the faces aren’t there a few\n\nyou recognize? On seeing them\n\n(like looking at childhood photographs)\n\ndon’t you say to yourself – Yes, I remember\n\nI was once as young as you.\n\nF. D. Reeves [Poetry September 1991]"
