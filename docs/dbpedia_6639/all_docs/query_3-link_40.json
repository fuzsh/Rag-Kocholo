        "text": "One of the more surprising and touching elements of the documentary “Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story” is the deep bond and long friendship between the “Superman” star Christopher Reeve and Robin Williams.\n\nThe two were classmates at Juilliard and stayed close throughout their lives. And speaking at IndieWire’s Studio at Sundance, Presented by Dropbox, the late Reeve’s three adult children took the time to honor Williams and his wife Marsha as among their “chosen family.”\n\n“It was just a beautiful friendship, and it wasn’t about the Hollywood roles or the outside personas,” Alexandra Reeve Givens, who today runs the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, said of Williams. “It was brother Robin and a deep friendship that went back to both of them being in class together. So I think it was just a beautiful well of strength for both of them. You get to switch off and be normal. Robin’s normal is different than most people.”\n\nThe documentary is a non-chronological story of Reeve both before and after his 1995 horse riding accident that left him paralyzed from below the shoulders. And mixed into that story we see Williams throughout in old photos from Juilliard, attending parties, and speaking at Reeve’s funeral in 2004. Williams died of suicide in 2014, and actress Glenn Close in the film says she believes that if Reeve were still alive today, Williams would be with us too.\n\nBut the Reeve children also said they still share a deep bond with Williams’ partner Marsha Williams, whom to this day they call their “fairy godmother.”\n\n“You capture the amazing gift of what it is to have not just blood family but chosen family, and they were part of the chosen family,” Reeve Givens said of Robin and Marsha’s depiction in the documentary.\n\n“That’s what defined them, Robin and Marsha too, their generosity, and their willingness to show up,” Reeve’s youngest son Will Reeve added. “That’s sometimes what friendship or brotherhood or love boils down to, just showing up for people.”\n\nWill Reeve took the time to share a memory of Williams from when he was just a toddler in the mid-’90s. It was time for Will’s nap on a family vacation, and Williams offered to help Will get to sleep, saying he does funny voices. Williams had just come off making “Aladdin,” but Will recalls saying, “No, I don’t want you” in favor of his grandmother.\n\n“He was all bummed out about it, and all these years later, a bit of a regret, but it was a wonderful friendship to witness and bask in the glow of as a family,” Will Reeve said.\n\nAlexandra and Will were joined by their sibling Matt Reeve, whom has followed somewhat in his father’s footsteps by becoming a filmmaker. And “Super/Man’s” directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui also stopped by the IndieWire Studio. Ettedgui says they wanted to capture the “lovely rhyme” to Reeve’s life both before and after his accident by editing the film in a way that wasn’t chronological, and it helps get at what it means to be a hero for a man who will forever be known as Superman.\n\n“[Reeve was] almost type cast in that role, that’s what people expect him to be. And he’s desperately trying to say I’m not a hero. I’m not just Superman, I’m trying to do other things with my life,” Ettedgui said. “He tries to run away from it, and then after the accident, he starts to realize he can embrace that legacy he created for the first time in his life, fully use his name and legacy as Superman to become a true superhero in life.”\n\n“In many ways our dad’s story circumstances are unique, but the themes are universal,” Reeve Givens added. “People think just of the superhero narrative, but really being a hero is the strength to fight through and show up every day, and not just for the bigger community but for the people around you.”\n\nThe 2024 Sundance Film Festival runs January 18–28, with festival talks taking place January 19–26.
