        "text": "The mass publication of Whitehall's organisational charts is not an immediately obvious victory for open government data, but that's what it is. The Cabinet Office today released the full structural details of every government department, from the big hitters of health and education down to the tiniest of government agencies.\n\nIt's part of the first big update of data.gov.uk, the UK's (better) answer to data.gov. And with each department the underlying data has been made available and easily accessible.\n\nThe charts themselves are available by roaming around this interactive guide:\n\nIt's a huge improvement on the last time the Cabinet office did this - and this time each department has been forced to release the underlying data as a spreadsheet in consistent formats.\n\nWe've pulled those spreadsheets together into one huge document, which contains the data for every department.\n\nBut what does the data tell us? Firstly, it only covers the senior civil servants - those who make policy in Whitehall. It doesn't include the people working at the coalface in jobcentres around the country, for instance. We've decided to focus on senior rather than junior departmental posts - you can get these from data.gov.uk.\n\nThat still gives us a pretty substantial list: 3,822 of Britain's most senior civil servants. Not all of them are named but the departmental structure and how much they get paid is included. There's a sample below too, if you scroll down for the 1,000 whose names have been published. It tells you the pay band for each one and the salary bill for the staff who directly report to them. The annual paybill for this lot is in the region of £13bn - which is probably an underestimate.\n\nYou can download the full data below.
