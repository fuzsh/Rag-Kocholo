        "text": "The ‘Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story’ documentary is one of the most anticipated productions in the Sundance Festival of 2024, which is happening in the next few days, a look back at the career of the famous actor who played Superman between 1978 and 1987 that saw his work cut short by the riding accident he suffered in 1995, which left him paralyzed from the neck down until the day he died in 2004, at only 52 years old. However, in 2023 we were able to enjoy again Reeve as Superman again - if only for a few seconds - through his cameo in ‘The Flash’, with his fleeting appearance next to that of Helen Slater as Supergirl, both via CGI. Now, Reeve’s children are sharing their thoughts on their father’s cameo, which they did not know of.\n\nChristopher Reeve’s children did not know about his cameo in ‘The Flash’\n\nIn a recent interview on Variety with Christopher Reeve’s children ahead of the premiere of their father’s documentary at the 2024 Sundance Festival, Will, Matthew, and Alexandra Reeve assured that they did not know of said cameo, given that Warner Bros. didn’t inform them or asked for permission. They even claim that they haven’t seen ‘The Flash’. All this is due to the controversy over the use of the image of deceased performers in new productions, whether or not they have the explicit permission from the family."
