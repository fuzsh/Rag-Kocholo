        "text": "Charles W. Raisch, who since 1896 has lived upon his present farm of eighty acres on section 27, Osceola township, successfully engaged in general farming and stock-raising, was born in Germany, September 1, 1863. He is a son of Gotlieb W. and Louisa Fredericka (Hess) Raisch, natives of Germany. They came to Ackley in July, 1880, and the father died there April 27, 1902, his wife surviving him until December, 1907. To their union were born nine children: Fredericka L., the wife of Philip Paulus, of Buffalo, New York; Gotleib F., of Reeve township; Charles W., of this review; Sophie L., who married Ely Behrens, of Waverly, Iowa; Christian F., of Hardin county; Gotthilf H., of Dumont; Amelia, who married Christian Walton, of Oakland, California; Bertha L., the wife of Eugene Friz, of Oakland, California; and, Henry, deceased.\n\nCharles W. Raisch came to America with his parents in 1880 and remained at home until he was twenty-four years of age. He then began farming independently and in 1896 made his first purchase of land, buying the eighty acres on section 27, Osceola township, upon which he still resides. This property he has improved with substantial buildings, including a modern silo, and he has installed excellent equipment, making the place valuable and productive in the highest degree. He is a stock-raiser on an extensive scale and makes a specialty of Duroc Jersey hogs and Holstein cattle.\n\nMr. Raisch married Miss Lenna Adell Whitney, who was born in Illinois, September 9, 1864, and who came to Franklin county in her infancy. Mr. And Mrs. Raisch have adopted two children: Frederick Arthur, aged twenty-one; and Mary Effie, aged thirteen. Mr. Raisch is a member of the Presbyterian church and connected fraternally with the Modern Woodmen of America. He gives his political allegiance to the republican party and has been honored by his fellow citizens by election to various positions of trust and responsibility, including the office of township assessor, which he has held for the past fourteen years. He has made a most commendable official record and enjoys to the fullest extent the confidence and good-will of those with whom he has been brought in contact.\n\nJames Redding\n\nSince 1876 James Redding has been connected with farming interests of Franklin county, and he is now the owner of two hundred acres of land whereon he engages successfully in general farming and stock-raising. He was born in Ireland, December 29, 1835, and is a son of John and Bridget (Ryan) Redding, also natives of the Emerald isle, who came to America, locating in Dubuque county, Iowa, in 1836. Forty years later they moved to Franklin county and there passed away in 1893. To their union were born eight children: James, of this review; Mary, the wife of John Flanagan, of Dubuque county; Ann and Michael, who reside in Ackley; John, Josephine and Frank, deceased; and Katherine, who married Thomas King, of Osceola township.\n\nJames Redding was reared in Dubuque county, Iowa, and acquired his education in the public schools. After beginning his active career he farmed upon rented land there until 1876. In that year he came to Franklin county with his parents and purchased eighty acres of land, which he developed and improved for ten years thereafter. At the end of that time he sold this and bought a farm of one hundred acres, which he afterward disposed of, buying one hundred and sixty acres. When he sold this he purchased his present farm of two hundred acres on section 36, Reeve township. This he has improved with substantial barns and outbuildings and upon it has since engaged in general farming and stock-raising, meeting with gratifying and well deserved success.\n\nOn the 21st of January, 1873, Mr. Redding was united in marriage to Miss Mary Markham, a native of Iowa, and they became the parents of nine children: twins, who died in infancy; John, a resident of Franklin county; Clem and Leo, at home; Maggie, deceased; Maggie, second of the name, who has also passed away; Irene, at home; and Agnes, deceased. Mr. Redding is a member of the Roman Catholic church and gives his political allegiance to the republican party. No record of the agricultural development of Franklin county would be complete without the history of his honorable and useful career, for he is recognized throughout the community as one of its most valuable and estimable citizens.\n\nJ. Albert Reeve, a native son of Franklin county, a representative of one of its honored pioneer families and one of the progressive farmers and extensive stock feeders and shippers of this locality, is a son of James B. and Adeline (Riggs) Reeve, natives of Connecticut. The father came to Iowa in' October, 1852, and here purchased a farm in Reeve township. He was one of the pioneer settlers of this locality, assisting in the organization of the county and serving as the first county judge. He took up the first claim in Franklin county and Reeve township was named in his honor. At the time of the Civil war he raised Company H of the Thirty-second Iowa Infantry, was elected its captain and went to the front in June, 1863. He died at Fort Pillow, Tennessee, and his wife has also passed away.\n\nThey were the parents of eleven children: Fernando L., who was a member of the Ninth Iowa Infantry in the Civil war and who died in Andersonville prison in August, 1864; Theodore H., who was a member of the same regiment and who is now engaged in the practice of law and also conducts a real-estate office at Dewey, Oklahoma; Orilla M., who married John T. James, of Arkansas; Orson G., a member of the Iowa state legislature; Beulah M., deceased; John R., who is engaged in the coal and grain business in Hampton; Susan M., the wife of H. A. Clock, of Long Beach, California; J. Albert, of this review; Ella, the wife of F. Foster, of St. Marys, Idaho; Herman D., who was secretary to Congressman Hall and who is now practicing law in Washington, D. C.; and Emily A., a teacher in a missionary school in India.\n\nJ. Albert Reeve was reared at home and acquired his education in the district schools. During his entire active life he has been engaged in farming and his success in this field is the result of wide experience and thorough familiarity with the best and most practical agricultural methods. In 1873 he made his first purchase of land, buying eighty acres in Morgan township. He has added to this from time to time until he is today one of the most extensive landholders in the county, owning seven hundred and twenty acres in Morgan, Reeve and Hamilton townships. His property is all well improved and under a high state of cultivation, returning bounteous harvests as a result of the care and labor bestowed upon it. In addition to dairy farming Mr. Reeve is a stock breeder and dealer on an extensive scale, shipping a large amount of cattle annually.\n\nMr. Reeve is a stanch republican and although he is not an active politician he takes an intelligent interest in public affairs and is always ready to cooperate in any movement for the advancement of the county and state. Having resided in Franklin county since his birth, he is well and favorably known here and his record is such as commends him to the respect and good-will of all with whom he is associated.\n\nOrson G. Reeve\n\nHon. Orson G. Reeve, representing his district in the state legislature and recognized for many years as one of the representative citizens of Franklin county, makes his home in Hampton, where he has lived since retiring from active farm life, having turned over the management and cultivation of his farm to his sons. He was born in Ashtabula, Ohio, July 4, 1846, his parents being James B. and Adeline (Riggs) Reeve, both of whom were natives of Connecticut. The father came to Iowa in October, 1852, and here established a home for his family upon a farm in Reeve township. He was one of the pioneer settlers here, assisting in the organization of the county and was the first county judge. In many ways he left the impress of his individuality upon the progress and development of this section of the state. He took up the first claim in the county and Reeve township was named in his honor. At the time of the Civil war he raised Company H, of the Thirty-second Iowa Infantry, was elected its captain, went to the front and in June, 1863, died at Fort Pillow, Tennessee. His wife has also passed away. They were the parents of eleven children: Fernando L., who was a member of the Ninth Iowa Infantry in the Civil war and died in Andersonville prison in August, 1864; Theodore H., who was also a member of the same regiment and is now engaged in the practice of law and also conducts a real-estate business at Dewey, Oklahoma; Orilla M., who is the wife of John T. James, of Arkansas; Orson G.; Beulah M., deceased; John R., who is engaged in the coal and grain business in Hampton; Susan M., the wife of H. A. Clock, of Long Beach, California; Albert, living in Reeve township; Ella, the wife of F. Foster, of St. Marys, Idaho; Herman D., who was secretary to Congressman Hall and is now practicing law in Washington, D. C.; and Emily A., teacher in a missionary school in India.\n\nOrson G. Reeve was a little lad of but seven years when brought by his parents to this county, where he was reared and educated, having the usual experiences of the pioneer lad who is reared on the frontier. He was but seventeen years of age, when in June, 1863, about the time of his father's death, he offered his services to the government as a union soldier, joining Company G, Eighth Iowa Calvary, with which he served for two years,' being honorably discharged on the 30th of September, 1865, at Macon, Georgia. He participated in a number of hotly contested engagements and went through all the rigors and hardships of war, yet had not attained his majority, when after two years of service at the front he returned home. At once he resumed farming and-has always lived in Reeve township. He made agricultural pursuits his life work and is still the owner of two hundred and forty acres of rich, valuable and productive land, which is now being cultivated by his sons while, having retired from business cares, Mr. Reeve is spending his days in the enjoyment of well earned rest. He removed to Hampton on the 1st of March, 1913, and there occupies a beautiful and commodious home.\n\nIn politics Mr. Reeve has always been a stalwart republican, casting his first vote for Lincoln when but eighteen years of age. This privilege came to him through the fact that he was serving as a soldier and-the right of franchise was accorded to all soldiers in the field. On the 17th of March, 1913, he was elected to the state legislature to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Frank Thayer, so that he is now a member of the Iowa general assembly. He.had previously held every office in Reeve township and in all had proven himself a loyal official, prompt and faithful in the discharge of every duty devolving upon him\n\nOn the 30th of September, 1872,Mr. Reeve was united in marriage to Miss Sarah M. Parks, a native of Jo Daviess county, Illinois, and to them have been born eight children: Olive, at home; Orilla M., who is an osteopathic practitioner in Mason City, Iowa; Adele, the wife of W. L. Johnson, a farmer of Reeve township; Charles H. who died May 13, 1913; John J., who follows farming in Reeve township; Lew, Myra and Lovell, all at home. Fraternally he is connected with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and with the Grand Army of the Republic, and he is as true and loyal to his country today as when he followed the old flag upon the battle fields of the south.\n\nWilliam C. Rice\n\nFor over forty years William C. Rice has been a resident of Franklin county, having come here in 1870. In early days he made his living as a hunter when wild animals were still plentiful and he is now a successful apiarist. He was born in Indiana, January 6, 1838, and is a son of Nicholas and Delilah (Samuels) Rice. The father, a boat builder by trade, moved to Knox county, Illinois, in 1838, and came to Iowa in 1851, locating in Hardin county, where he built the first sawmill. When he settled in that county there were only five other families in the neighborhood. He passed the rest of his life there, and his wife died in Cherokee county. They were the parents of ten children: Jacob K., of Port Angeles, Washington; Jonathan, deceased; Henry Harrison, also deceased; James N., of Cherokee county; William C.; Marilda S., the widow of W. B. Fail, of Kansas; Catherine and Emma, deceased; Clementine T., the widow of Charles Marx, of Lemon Cove, California; and N. John, also of Lemon Cove, that state.\n\nWilliam C. Rice was reared under the parental roof and acquired such an education as the early schools provided. At the age of seventeen he worked in a sawmill his father owned and for seven years followed that occupation in Hardin county. After his marriage he turned his attention to farming, buying in 1862 eighty acres of land near Ackley, at the rate of six dollars per acre, and remained there for about three years. He greatly improved this property, selling three years later at twenty-five dollars per acre. He then removed to Ackley, where at that time the Illinois Central Railroad was in course of construction. Mr. Rice had been quite successful as a hunter in those days, shooting elk and other wild animals. He shipped these to New York, having a contract with a firm in that city. As a game collector he also trapped and caught buffalo, cranes, wild geese, beaver, swan and antelope. Mr. Rice was for many years a hunter and disposed of his animals at an advantageous price in eastern markets. He captured more wolves than any other man in his section, receiving a bounty for his efforts, and he estimates the number of these animals that he killed at over three thousand.\n\nIn 1870 Mr. Rice came-to Franklin county, locating at Oakland Valley, and there he has since made his home. He has given much attention to bee culture and has derived a gratifying income from this source. He owns one block and two lots in Oakland and is also the possessor of twenty acres of valuable timber and farmland.\n\nOn September 25, 1856, Mr. Rice was united in marriage to Miss Mary Elizabeth Barnum, a relative of P. T. Barnum, and a daughter of Jabez and Anna L. (Goodsell) Barnum, natives of New York. Mrs. Rice, at the age of seventeen, taught the first school held at Steamboat Rock, Iowa. Her father was one of the pioneers of Hardin county, having entered land there in 1854. Both parents passed away in that county. They had the following children: Abraham G., Joseph S. and Olive, deceased; a son and a daughter who died in infancy; Mary Elizabeth, the wife of our subject; and Cordelia, Emory E., Anna and Lura, all deceased. Mr. and Mrs. Rice had ten children: Frank M., of Popejoy; Rosetta, deceased; Burton B., of Nebraska; Irene M., of Cedar Falls; Iva L., who married F. C. Holmes, of Iowa Falls; Myrta D., the wife of L. B. Patterson, of Des Moines, Iowa; Daisy M., at home, who is a teacher in the Waterloo schools; Blanche R., also a teacher, and the widow of T. W. Christopher, at home; Loretta V., of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and a son who died in infancy.\n\nMr. Rice is one of the well known and highly esteemed residents of this section. Although he has passed his seventy-sixth birthday, he is still hale and hearty and takes interest in all affairs that affect his township, county, state or nation. In his political faith he is a progressive republican and for two terms has served as township assessor of Oakland township, performing his duties in a highly satisfactory manner. He has the full confidence of his friends and neighbors, who know him to be a man of good character and a public-spirited citizen.\n\nJames Howard Richards is closely associated with agricultural interests of Franklin county as the owner of the old Richards homestead of one hundred and sixty acres on section 14, Reeve township. He was born upon this property May 7, 1879, and is a son of W. H. and Sarah (Combellick) Richards, of whom further. mention is made elsewhere in this work.\n\nJames H. Richards acquired his education in the public schools of Franklin county and since the beginning of his active life has been engaged in farming, his long experience being one of the most important factors in his success. In 1910 he bought the old homestead of one hundred and sixty acres, and here he has since carried on general farming and stock-raising, acquiring important interests along both lines.\n\nOn the 7th of December, 1904, Mr. Richards was united in marriage to Miss Norma Nobles, a native of Franklin county and one of four children: a son who died in infancy; Fannie, the wife of Sherwood Clock, of Hampton; Norma, the wife of the subject of this review; and Helen, at home.

Richards is a veteran of the Civil war, living retired in Hampton after many years of close connection with agricultural interests of Franklin county. He was born in Jo Daviess county, Illinois, February 20, 1843, and is a son of James and Elizabeth (Vincent) Richards, natives of England. The parents came to America in 1838 and the father afterward spent the greater portion of his time in California, where he engaged in mining. The father died in 1870 and the mother in December, 1912, at the age of eighty six years. To their union were born five children: William H., of this review; Sarah, the wife of B. Ball, of Osage, Iowa; Pierce, of Galena, Illinois; James, who died in the Union army during the Civil war; and Joseph, who passed away when he was still a child.\n\nWilliam H.

In August, 1862, he enlisted in Company A, Ninety-sixth Illinois Volunteer Infantry, and served for three years, receiving his discharge as color bearer and corporal. He participated in many of the most important engagements of the Civil war, twenty-seven or twenty-eight battles and skirmishes in all, among them the battles of Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge. His regiment of four hundred men was held as a reserve at Chickamauga and there lost two hundred and fifteen men in six hours of fighting. After his discharge he returned to Illinois and thence in 1872 moved to Franklin county, Iowa. He bought eighty acres of land in Reeve township and remained upon this farm until his retirement, increasing its dimensions to three hundred and twenty acres and making it by his intelligent management one of the most valuable and productive farms in the locality. In 1904 Mr. Richards disposed of his property and moved into Hampton, where he now resides.\n\nOn the 3d of July, 1870, Mr. Richards married Miss Sarah Combellick, a native of Illinois, and they became the parents of nine children: Alice, the wife of E.

He gives his political allegiance to the republican party and has served with credit and ability as school director. Throughout the entire period of his residence in Franklin county he has contributed in substantial measure to community growth and upbuilding, and his retirement rewards many years of earnest and faithful labor.\n\nHenry F. Richtsmeier is carrying on general farming and stockraising upon one hundred and sixty acres of land on section 7, Osceola township, and is numbered among the successful and progressive agriculturists of his locality. He was born in Illinois, August 12, 1874, and is a son of Henry F. and Martha (Stoneberg) Richtsmeier, natives of Germany. The father came to America when he was twelve years of age and located in Illinois, where he grew to manhood.

His wife survives him and still resides upon the homestead. To their union were born seven children: Henry F., of this review; Fred, of Franklin county; John, residing in Bradford; William, of Geneva; and Herman, Frank and Christ, of Grant township.\n\nHenry F. Richtsmeier was nine years of age when he moved with his parents to Franklin county and has been a resident of this part of Iowa since that time. In his childhood he learned farming through practical experience upon his father's property, and his entire active life has been given over to this occupation. He now rents the homestead of one hundred and sixty acres on section 7, Osceola township, and here carries on general farming and stock-raising, both branches having become under his able management important and profitable.\n\nOn the 15th of February, 1899, Mr. Richtsmeier was united in marriage to Miss Tillie Heitland, a native of Germany and a daughter of Henry and Maggie (Nortman) Heitland, also natives of the fatherland.

They are well known and highly esteemed throughout the community and have gained an extensive circle of friends during their lifelong residence here.\n\nRichard Rodemeyer, Sr., became the owner of four hundred acres of valuable land in Franklin county, Iowa, and his property holdings were the visible evidences of a life of-well directed thrift and intelligent effort. He was born in Landesbergen, in the kingdom of Hanover, Germany, October 21, 1845, and in childhood lost his father. His mother afterward came to America, where she resided for a number of years prior to her demise. In the common schools of his native country Richard Rodemeyer pursued his education and in June, 1866, when in the twenty-first year of his age, he crossed the Atlantic to the new world, making his way to Chicago. The reports concerning the favorable business opportunities of America led him to make this change in residence, and he continued in Chicago until after the great fire in that city in October, 1871.\n\nIt was on the 18th of February, 1872, that Mr. Rodemeyer was united in marriage to Miss Hulda Steffen, who was then living with her sister in Chicago.

Her father was a government forester and subsequent to his death and that of her mother Mrs. Rodemeyer went to London, England, and thence came to the United States.\n\nFollowing their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Rodemeyer removed from Chicago to Waterloo, Iowa, where for three years he engaged in farming. On the expiration of that period they took up their abode in Franklin county, and as a result of his careful management and judicious investment Mr. Rodemeyer became the owner of four hundred acres of fine land. Year after year he carefully tilled the soil and as time passed on his well cultivated crops brought him a substantial financial return. At length he determined to retire and spend his remaining days in the enjoyment of well earned and well merited rest. Accordingly in 1905 he left the farm and he and his wife took up their abode in Latimer.\n\nThey were the parents of seven sons and two daughters: Louie F. D.; Herman H. and William, twins; Richard; Pauline; Frederick D., manager for the Interstate Lumber Company at Alexander, Iowa; Edward, who died January 17, 1904; Ernest D.; and Lena.

Nine years later Mr. Rodemeyer passed away, dying on the 20th of August, 1913, after an illness of nearly six weeks. Both he and his wife were members of the Lutheran church and its teachings proved the guiding spirit in their lives. In politics Mr. Rodemeyer was a staunch democrat. He was fond of reading and during his leisure hours was usually found with book or paper in his hand. He thus became a well informed man and one who could converse in interesting manner upon any of the subjects of general public moment. During his long residence in Iowa he made many friends and the high esteem in which he was uniformly held by his acquaintances indicated the sterling worth of his character.\n\nClaude F.

Roemer attended the district schools and starting out in life for himself at the age of twenty years, came to Hampton, where he established an implement and pump business. The enterprise was successful from the beginning and the trade has steadily grown so that he is now accorded a liberal patronage that brings a good financial return. He built a fine building with concrete sides and pressed brick front, forty by one hundred and four feet, and three stories in height. In 1912 Mr. Roemer took in Mr. Gibson as a partner and the business is conducted: under the name of Roemer & Gibson.

In business, too, he has made continuous advancement and is now one of the substantial and prosperous merchants of his adopted city.\n\nOtto Roline\n\nThe industry that more than any other has raised the United States to a foremost place amongst the nations of the world is that of farming and it is to the agriculturist that the people of this country must give thanks for this gratifying accomplishment. This result has been brought about by the sons of all nations who have settled in this country and among the foremost agriculturists who have been an important factor in farming development are the Swedish Americans. To this hardy race belongs Otto Roline, who owns a valuable place of two hundred and seventy-five acres in Morgan township, Franklin county.
