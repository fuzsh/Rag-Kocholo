        "text": "Reeve, who was best known in Hollywood for his role as Superman, became paralysed from the neck down after falling from a horse in 1995. He tragically died at the age of just 52 in 2004, after suffering from heart failure according to the History Channel. His wife Dana Reeve then died two years later, seven months after announcing she had lung cancer, per MedPageToday.\n\nHe is survived by three children. Here’s what we know about his lookalike sons:\n\nWho are Will and Matthew Reeve’s parents?\n\nMatthew Reeve, 44, was born in London in 1979 to actor Christopher Reeve and Gae Exton. William, 31, was born in Massachusetts in 1992, to Christopher and Dana Reeve.\n\nThey have a sister\n\nMatthew and William have a sister, who’s the middle child. Alexandra Reeve Givens is the daughter of Christopher and Gae Exton. According to People, she has a career in politics and law, and is married to her husband Garren Givens. They have a son called Christopher named after her father.\n\nThe Reeve siblings have shared stories about their dad\n\nAll three of Christopher’s children have been protective of their father’s legacy. At the premiere of Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, Matthew Reeve recalled the time his father appeared on stage at the 1996 Oscars for the first time after his riding accident.\n\n“I remember I was in London, it was a school night and we stayed up until three or four in the morning to watch it. And it was absolutely incredible,” he told People magazine. “And what sticks with me most was after that incredible warm welcome and that very long ovation that he received, his introduction – he followed it up with a wonderful speech about how cinema and movies are at their best when they not only entertain, but they inform and educate and address issues.”\n\nMatthew’s brother Will also told People in 2015: “We shared a very deep bond in general, but sports was definitely a major component of our family bond. If it involved a ball or a stick or a racquet or a bat or a puck, we were either watching it or playing it or talking about it together.”\n\nChristopher Reeve’s sons are both in the film biz\n\nBoth brothers have followed in their father’s footsteps by joining the world of Hollywood.\n\nMeanwhile, Matthew works as a writer, director and producer, per his X bio.\n\nMatthew and Will Reeve’s love lives\n\nWhile Matthew seems more private about his personal life, Will is known to be in a relationship with event planner Amanda Dubin, per the New York Post."
