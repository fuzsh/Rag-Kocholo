        "text": "Christopher Reeve was a legendary American actor, director, writer, producer and activist. He is best remembered for his perfect portrayal of the DC Comic book superhero ‘Superman.’ With blue eyes, towering height, and athletic built, Reeve played the role of ‘Superman’ with utmost ease and élan. Born into an upper-class household, Reeve was bit by the acting bug early in his life. It was while studying at ‘Cornell University’ that Reeve took up acting professionally. He made his Broadway debut and was soon asked to play the character of ‘Clark Kent/Superman.’ Apart from the ‘Superman’ series, Reeve showed his brilliance as an actor in various films, including ‘The Remains of the Day’ and ‘Rear Window.’ Acting apart, Reeve was a licensed pilot and had flown solo across the Atlantic twice. He was also an active campaigner of various issues related to health and society. It was a tragic accident during an equestrian competition in Culpeper, Virginia that left him quadriplegic in 1995. However, he did not let his physical impairment come in between his acting and activism. He founded the ‘Christopher Reeve Foundation’ and lobbied for issues related to spinal cord injuries and human embryonic stem cell research."
