        "text": "By Movieguide® Contributor\n\nSUPERMAN star Christopher Reeve’s son Matthew is remembering his father’s 1996 appearance at the Oscars following the accident that left him paralyzed.\n\n“I remember I was in London, it was a school night and we stayed up until three or four in the morning to watch it. And it was absolutely incredible,” Matthew told PEOPLE. “And what sticks with me most was after that incredible warm welcome and that very long ovation that he received, his introduction — he followed it up with a wonderful speech about how cinema and movies are at their best when they not only entertain, but they inform and educate and address issues.”\n\nHe explained that, following his father’s speech, they showed a series of clips that demonstrated his point, like COMING HOME and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT “and films that really address important human issues and made a call to action that Hollywood do more to do that.”\n\n“So that’s always stuck with me,” Matthew said. “And that’s why also I feel like here, at Sundance, that’s what they do and that’s what they live for.”\n\nToday, Matthew and his siblings, Will and Alexandra, are remembering his father’s legacy through the new documentary, SUPER/MAN: THE CHRISTOPHER REEVE STORY.\n\n“There are so many different parts of his personality and his passions that come through in the film. He was dedicated to his craft, of course, before the accident, but also after being able to return to acting and directing and showing that a disability wouldn’t hold him back,” Alexandra told Deadline. “So that legacy of what it is to care about your career and keep moving even after overwhelming obstacles is one key part of it. But the other part is his life as an advocate. He was an activist again before the injury. And then after the injury, of course, he became known around the world for his advocacy, for medical research and for disability rights.”\n\nThe actor was paralyzed after a horse accident in 1995.\n\nWill told Deseret News, “We wanted this project to be the definitive story of our dad’s life, and that requires an emotional ride. And we were prepared for it, as much as one can be.”\n\n“We’re proud of all of it,” he continued. “We’re proud of all the complexities and nuances and not-so-great elements of the story, because that’s humanity, that’s what makes a human. And that’s what makes an ordinary individual into a hero, is all of the messiness and all of the striving to be better.”"
