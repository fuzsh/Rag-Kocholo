        "text": "Will Reeve, son of the late Superman actor Christopher Reeve, gave his first comments to TMZ about what it was like filming a cameo for James Gunn’s upcoming “Superman.” It’s a full-circle moment as Will’s father played the Man of Steel in four comic book tentpoles, including Richard Donner’s iconic 1978 “Superman.” Variety reported earlier this month that Will would be making an appearance in Gunn’s new movie.\n\n“I know the folks making the film, and they’ve been so kind to me and my family, and I had a free day, so we made it [happen],” Reeve told TMZ.\n\n“I don’t know what I’m allowed to say,” he added. “It was a really great experience; they were super friendly; it was quick, easy…I was actually more nervous doing that than I am whenever I’m on TV for my normal job because there was so many people around and I had to memorize one line, but still!”\n\nWill has worked as a correspondent for ABC News, and rumor has it his “Superman” cameo is that of a TV reporter. Gunn recently wrapped filming the movie’s six-week shoot in Cleveland, which is where Will filmed his cameo appearance. The writer-director stressed that “we are not done shooting” and there’s “still a couple weeks left,” adding: “It’s a long shoot…but we’re getting close!!”\n\nChristopher Reeve’s children, Will and older siblings Matthew and Alexandra, have been celebrating their father’s legacy this year thanks to the documentary “Super/Man,” which world premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January and was sold to Warner Bros. in a deal worth roughly $15 million. The siblings appear in the film and were on the ground in Park City to promote it. They are expected to factor into the film’s promotion when it has a theatrical release starting Sept. 21.\n\nAlexandra told Variety that the documentary is a “beautiful gift” because it’s rare to “see your parent’s life told in its totality…to see a life well lived on screen and in its full complexity. We wanted people to see the highs and lows, the public facade and what’s happening at home.”\n\n“It is a gift. We’re so lucky,” Matthew added. “We not only have his films to look at but a collection of home movies to dig up and go through and interviews on YouTube of him to pull up. Seeing things I hadn’t seen before didn’t change my perception of him but enhanced it…like some rare Australian interview done in 1977 that was uploaded and I didn’t know existed. It was pretty cool to see that and uncover a lot more material than we knew about.”\n\n“Superman” is set to open in theaters on July 11, 2025, from Warner Bros."
