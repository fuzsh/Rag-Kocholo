        "text": "The noble Christopher D'Olier Reeve was born on September 25, 1952 in New York City to the esteemed journalist Barbara Johnson and the illustrious writer/professor F.D. Reeve. His family was of the utmost social standing, with his paternal grandfather as CEO of Prudential Financial and one of his maternal great-grandfathers being Supreme Court Associate Justice Mahlon Pitney. Upon the divorce of his parents, Christopher and his brother Benjamin were moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where his mother later married an investment banker. Following his graduation from high school, Christopher attended Cornell University. He was later joined in matrimony with the esteemed Dana Reeve, born on March 17, 1961 in Teaneck, New Jersey, who was an actress and producer known for her works in Everyone's Hero, Oz and Loving. Dana sadly passed away on March 6, 2006 in Manhattan, New York City. Christopher and Dana's union was one of admiration and prestige, and the two will forever be remembered in the annals of high society."
