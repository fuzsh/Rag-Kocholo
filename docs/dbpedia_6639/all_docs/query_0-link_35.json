Though born in the U.S., his father was English and his mother was Puerto Rican, a rich and diverse cultural heritage. He later became a mentor to Allen Ginsberg. Williams had a series of heart attacks and strokes in 1948 and 1949, and died at age 79 in March 1963. Among his many poetry collections are: Sour Grapes; An Early Martyr; The Wedge, which was published in a pocket-sized edition for U.S soldiers to carry with them during WWII; the multi-volume Paterson; The Desert Music; and The Red Wheelbarrow.\n\nThis Is Just To Say\n\nby William Carlos Williams\n\nI have eaten\n\nthe plums\n\nthat were in\n\nthe icebox\n\nand which\n\nyou were probably\n\nsaving\n\nfor breakfast\n\nForgive me\n\nthey were delicious\n\nso sweet\n\nand so cold\n\n”This Is Just to Say” from The Collected Poems: Volume I, 1909-1939, copyright © 1938 by William Carlos Williams – New Directions Publishing\n\n________________\n\n1945 – Kay Ryan born in San Jose, California; American poet and community college English teacher. She called her childhood home a place of silence, where “being a poet would be thought of as putting on airs.” Ryan published Dragon Acts to Dragon Ends privately in 1983. The Niagara River, her 6th book, won the 2004 Ruth Lily Poetry Prize. She was a surprise choice for U.S. Poet Laureate (2008-2010). “I felt completely unequal to the task. I thought, no, never in a million years …” In spite of her self-doubts, and the diagnosis of her life partner, Carol Adair, with advanced stage cancer, she accepted, and during her tenure emphasized the value of community colleges. Adair died in 2009, during Ryan’s second term. Ryan won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for The Best of It: New and Selected Poems. In 2013, President Barack Obama presented her with a National Humanities Medal.\n\nDoubt\n\nby Kay Ryan\n\nA chick has just so much time\n\nto chip its way out, just so much\n\negg energy to apply to the weakest spot\n\nor whatever spot it started at.\n\nIt can’t afford doubt.

He earned degrees from Princeton and Columbia, worked as a Hudson River longshoreman, and then in 1961, was part of one of the first exchanges between the American Council of Learned Societies and the USSR Academy of Sciences. In the summer of 1962, he accompanied Robert Frost to Russia for his meeting with Nikita Khrushchev, serving as Frost’s translator.

He and Christopher were estranged for many years, but reconciled after his son was paralyzed in an equestrian accident. F.D. Reeve was a founding editor of Poetry Review, and published over two dozen books of poetry, fiction, criticism, and translation. F.D. Reeve died at age 84 from diabetes complications in June 2013.\n\nThe Moon and Other Failures\n\nby F. D. Reeve\n\nThe stones of Paris smell of books\n\nfrom bibles lighting up the Middle Ages\n\nto romantic tales of unrequited love.\n\nEvery Sunday my grandfather winds his clocks\n\nAnd checks the past for any uncut pages.\n\nTime still presses hard upon his house\n\nbuttoned up against late winter snow.\n\nThe landscape cheapened, he’ll soon move away\n\nbecause suddenly he fears an airplane crash,\n\nlike Montaigne who fled the plague in old Bordeaux.\n\nAs I walk along the Paris streets surprised\n\nby the fanshaped stones and the butt of a Roman wall,\n\nI fancy Grandpa waiting at a corner\n\nand wonder of bishops still rise to Paradise\n\nand every king is picketed in Hell.\n\nFresh bread on Easter morning would fill the air\n\nwith joy. (The Way of the Cross goes on and on.)\n\nMeanwhile, the planets pass with cold indifference,\n\nand documentaries of a thousand wars\n\n(the latest technologies) compute the sun’s\n\nposition in the encyclopedia of matter.\n\nThe house of Heaven, like the Luxembourg full of statues,\n\nwith its old families who used to constellate the sky\n\nburns to ashes. Wandering the streets of Paris,\n\nno one remembers the moon and other failures.\n\n“The Moon and Other Failures” from The Moon and Other Failures, © 1999 by F. D. Reeve – Michigan State University Press\n\n_____________________\n\nSeptember 20\n\n________________\n\n1878 – Upton Sinclair born as Upton Beall Sinclair Jr. in Baltimore, Maryland; American writer of both fiction and nonfiction, muckraking journalist, socialist, political activist, and the 1934 Democratic nominee for governor of California.

He wrote nearly 100 books in several genres. He also wrote the occasional poem and even a verse drama entitled Hell. He died at age 90 in November 1968.\n\nOn a Steamship\n\nby Upton Sinclair\n\nAll night, without the gates of slumber lying,\n\nI listen to the joy of falling water,\n\nAnd to the throbbing of an iron heart.\n\nIn ages past, men went upon the sea,\n\nWaiting the pleasure of the chainless winds;\n\nBut now the course is laid, the billows part;\n\nMankind has spoken: “Let the ship go there!”\n\nI am grown haggard and forlorn, from dreams\n\nThat haunt me, of the time that is to be,\n\nWhen man shall cease from wantonness and strife,\n\nAnd lay his law upon the course of things.\n\nThen shall he live no more on sufferance,\n\nAn accident, the prey of powers blind;\n\nThe untamed giants of nature shall bow down—\n\nThe tides, the tempest and the lightning cease\n\nFrom mockery and destruction, and be turned\n\nUnto the making of the soul of man.\n\n________________\n\n1928 – Donald Hall born in Hamden, Connecticut; American poet, writer, editor, and literary critic. Author of over 50 books, from children’s literature, biography, memoir, and essays, to 22 volumes of verse.

Waits\n\nin a weed’s shadow.\n\nFlashes emerald–\n\nis gone.\n\nHere once horror poured so hot, heavy, thick,\n\neveryone was dead before he was sick.\n\nNow here is no heat but the sun’s\n\non old stone treads;\n\nno motion but that rippling inch of whip:\n\nyours, you little live jewel, who slipped away\n\ninto silence. Yet stay on to haunt memory,\n\nlike those dead.\n\n“Lizard at Pompeii” from Collected Poems 1919-1962, © 1962 by Babette Deutsch – Indiana University Press\n\n________________\n\n1947 – Mary Fell born Worcester, Massachusetts; social worker, educator, and poet.

Awful not to be the water\n\nBut how awful to be the stone\n\n“Anywhere Obliged” © 2022 by Shane McCrae, appeared in BOMB Magazine in October 2022\n\n_____________________\n\nSeptember 23\n\n________________\n\n1948 – Maggie Anderson born in New York City, American poet and editor.
