Reeve discussed his return to work in \"Rear Window\" and \"In the Gloaming\" saying: \"Resting doesn't agree with me......during 'Rear Window' my SAT's remained high, I had no pressure sores, unlimited energy....I was in the chair for 15 hours a day for more than a month.\" He spoke of the importance to him of his wife and three children and added: \"I don't want other people to be dragged down by the fact that I had a silly accident and so I try as hard as possible, and this is the most important lesson I've learned since the accident and something I would pass on to other disabled people, and that is, even when you're feeling needy your job is to give.\" When asked if as long as he was still working, still spiritually content, would it matter if he's not walking at 50? He immediately said, \"No\" and concluded: \"As long as the scientists keep working for a cure. No slacking off! Then I'll still be content because I'm convinced and so are they that one day there will be a cure, and that's common ground, not wishful thinking.\" \"Something that was thought impossible for 1000's of years can actually be achieved.\"\n\nJanuary 8, 1999: The International Council of Nurses (ICN) in Geneva, Switzerland announced that Christopher Reeve will be Honorary Patron for this year's celebrations of the ICN centennial.

As Honorary Patron for the 100th birthday of the International Council of Nurses, I ask that we recognise the work of our nurses and thank them for their contribution in promoting good health in all of our communities.\" ICN's centennial year celebrations aim to remind the world how in homes, work places, schools, hospitals, villages, refugee camps and many other settings, that nurses promote the health and well-being of their communities, educate, tend to people in need, and search for new ways to improve the health of humanity. The official beginning of the ICN centennial celebrations will take place January 28th in Geneva, the site of ICN's corporate headquarters.

Chris, Dana, and Will Reeve were in attendance along with former President Gerald Ford, Jane Seymour, Kelsey Grammar, and Mary Hart from Entertainment Tonight, where it was announced that $200,000 was raised for the Reeve Foundation. This was the first time Christopher Reeve visited Vail since he had competed in the same event in the winter of 1995, a few months before he was injured and he said it took him a little time to adjust when he arrived in his room and looked at the slopes. \"There have been tremendous breakthroughs recently, and there is tremendous reason for hope,\" said Reeve. \"I may not be able to ski again right away, but it certainly is not outside the realm of possibility.\"\n\nFebruary 9, 1999: \"Rear Window\" will be shown on Australian television for the first time on February 15, 1999 at 8.30pm on Channel 9 (check your local guides for verification).\n\nFebruary 10, 1999: Christopher Reeve, Colin Powell, and other friends paid tribute to Wanda Chappell, the 39-year-old Random House executive who died in a West Side Manhattan high-rise fire in December, at the 92nd Street Y memorial.

They also predict that he recovered after \"prompt use of methylprednisolone, a steroid, reduced initial damage. Then tissue was transplanted to act as a bridge across which motor neurons could reconnect.\" The prediction goes a little further with the more technical medical terms, but it is very encouraging to read that it is predicted that Chris will recover the year he turns 50 whether or not he actually does.\n\nFebruary 16, 1999: According to U.S. News & World Report, in their February 22nd issue, quadriplegic painter Chuck Close is feuding with Chris. They base this on Close airing his criticism in New Mobility magazine. Close wants Chris to use his popularity to push for social improvements like better health insurance-not a cure for paralysis, which many see as wishful thinking. A cure is Chris's priority, but he has lobbied Congress before, in 1997 and 1998, to increase insurance companies' lifetime caps on payments for catastrophic injuries and will do so again in April 1999 by asking Congress to double the research budget of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nFebruary 21, 1999: Two appearance dates to see Chris in Peter Lowe's Success 1999 seminar are now available.

Reeve said when accepting his award, \"And I remember when I was first injured in 1995, a leading researcher, Dr. Wise Young was asked, 'Do you think that Christopher Reeve will ever walk again?' And he said, 'well you can always hope but after awhile hope ebbs.' And when he was asked the same question three years later, he said, 'I am astonished what has happened in the last three years, all bets are off and if the money and the funding continues, it is possible that he could be up and walking within approximatelyfive years!' That is an astounding change and as it has been said before, more has happened in neuroscience in the last five years, than in the previous fifty! And I feel very lucky to have been injured at a time of real hope and real optimism, so that I can get out of bed everyday and say, there is something positive that we can do and it's not just pie in the sky optimism, but there are concrete steps and measures we can take to go forward into what I call \"the frontier of inner-space\" it's the last frontier of medicine in the brain and the central nervous system.\" Reeve also participated in a roundtable discussion that focused on furthering scientific knowledge and continued funding for the National Institute of Health.

Reeve said that money will determine how quickly a spinal cord injury cure will be found and he will be testifying before Congress today for an increase in govermnent funding.

Otherwise it could take as long as 15.\n\nApril 14, 1999: During his appearance on the Today show, Christopher Reeve announced the merger of the American Paralysis Association and the Christopher Reeve Foundation to form a single organization: the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation. Reeve said, \"This merger makes strong sense...By working together, we can find solutions that none of us alone can achieve.\" In addition to the merger and name change, Reeve announced that the Christopher Reeve Foundation will bring over $1 million to the CRPF immediately. The Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation will continue the work previously done separately by the two organizations as it raises and targets funds for medical research leading to the development of effective treatments and a cure for paralysis caused by spinal cord injury and other central nervous system disorders.

Her deep desire was to help children.\n\nMay 13, 1999: Several television programs have shown Christopher Reeve participating in an experimental program which allows his legs to move under certain conditions. The theory is based on the concept that unused muscles remember their function if stimulated. It was developed by NASA to help understand how astronauts' bodies return to normal after leaving zero gravity conditions. HOWEVER, HE IS NOT WALKING. Reeve issued a statement through the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation: \"Recent media reports have either stated or created the impression that I am now able to walk. Unfortunately, this is not the case. I am completely paralyzed from the rib cage down. However, I am participating in a cutting-edge therapy which is part of my overall exercise program. Wearing a parachute harness and suspended by overhead cables, I stand on a treadmill. When it is put into motion, energy and memory which remain in the spinal cord allow me to step at speeds up to 4 miles per hour... I deeply appreciate the great interest that people take in my progress toward recovery.

Nothing to it.\" About how he would like the magazine to be Reeve said, \"I'd like them to accurately report what's going on with celebrities. To know the facts straight and not to create rumors. I think this will be a class act. People want to hear about celebrities, but you got to get rid of all the rumors and get to the facts.\" Reeve also talked about his experience with Talk magazine, \"We are going to be in the third issue of the magazine and they did a great photo shoot of all of us.

Reeve adds, 'Nic has been so supportive.' They knew each other just casually, having met once on a plane. 'I enjoyed acting in Rear Window, but (for me) directing is really the future. And I love it. For him to think of me was not an act of charity. There are no giveaways' in their business.\" The article also mentioned that the book Dana Reeve is wrapping up, made up of some of the 35,000 letters from both ordinary and famous people who wrote to Reeve after his accident, called Care Packages will be out this fall.

During a press briefing before the meeting, Reeve said creation of the board in New York was important because of the state's large number of research facilities and that \"the money will be used well here.\" Reeve said about the importance of money in finding a cure, \"Right now money makes all the difference.

When Gottlieb talked about people with spinal cord injuries who have nursing care where wives are forced to be caregivers, Reeve said that his rule of thumb is to \"never turn your wife into your nurse or mother because that's the start of your relationship going down hill.\" Reeve also said that his hip is currently dislocated, but is not the topic while eating dinner with his family. Reeve explains, \"We have a rule that we don't talk about anything to do with medical issues at the dinner table. Our son Will is there and we talk about the fact that he just learned how to ride a two-wheeler by himself. We talk about the Yankees. We talk about normal life, but anything medical, you know. For example, right now I have a dislocated hip. I'm going to see a specialist in awhile, but it's pretty serious because I'm going to need the hip intact for when the cure comes, but I would not [talk about it at the dinner table].\" When Gottlieb, a quadriplegic for about 20 years who is not eager to get out of \"the chair\" asked him about his hope that a cure is coming Reeve said, \"I've only been injured, you know, for four years, I'm 46 and I tolerate being a quadriplegic, but I do not accept it.\"\n\nSeptember 16, 1999: Actor and comedian Robin Williams appeared on BBC1's Clive Anderson Talk's Back and was asked how Christopher Reeve was doing.

He's an extraordinary person. Last time we talked I said he was on a roll. But then he always is. Right now people are going (looks worried). That's a joke for him and other people who'll go \"I like that\". Stephen Hawking will go (talks in a synthesised voice) \"Funny joke!\". He's doing better... He's wonderful... He's my friend. He's the godfather of my son.\" Imitating Marlon Brando Robin joked, \"I must always do good things for him. I have a male born child I must help him in any way possible.\" He went on to say, \"He's a great friend. I wish to be the same for him. I've always tried to help him through by using humour and being there for him when he needs it. Going to benefits and just being there, not necessarily to perform at the benefit but just to be there for him.\" Later in the interview Robin made a reference to Christopher Reeve's appearance at the Oscars in 1996. Asked whether he'd present the Oscars Robin said no and joked that, \"I will be in the dance numbers though (singing), \"We're dancing! We've got war movies, people in pain.

Reeve said, \"When regeneration occurs, because the side that controls movement is normal, I should have quite a substantial recovery.\" Reeve visited MCP Hahnemann University at the invitation of University President Constantine Papadakis, who greeted him and hosted the presentation in the University's executive board room. The MCP Hahnemann University team is the only group in the Greater Philadelphia region studying the pathophysiology and treatment of spinal cord injuries.

At a dinner that night, actor and friend Joe Pesci presented Reeve the first ever Bancroft NeuroHealth Award. Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell also presented him a commemorative bowl. \"We all have reserves we're not aware of,\" Reeve said. \"Before my accident, I ran like a teenager, and I would have said that paralysis was unacceptable. And initially, when this happened, I felt intense regret and anger.\" He also noted that his condition has led him to find gratification in new ways. During a press conference following the award presentation, Reeve said he believed that scientists will soon be able to help those with brain injuries as well as those with paralysis to lead fuller lives. The message Reeve wants to convey to others during the conference is, \"That all of us have inside of us many more resources than we know, and when we are faced with a tragedy of some kind, we should challenge ourselves to go beyond any level that we have gone before.\"\n\nSeptember 24, 1999: Another award was given to Christopher Reeve in the category of \"Biography\" for his autobiography Still Me in New York's Blackbird Restaurant from Libraries U.S.A. and Ameritech at their first annual Readers' Choice Awards Luncheon.

Reeve said, \"I want to go back to the NOD and tell them about this and tell them we should start an initiative so places like this can be built all over the country.\" He also said that people with disabilities want funding for a cure or other innovations that will allow them to lead productive lives. \"Those who are able-bodied,\" Reeve said, \"can do so much by simply not looking away.\" The Albany Advocacy Resource Center, formerly the Albany Association for Retarded Citizens, has been working on building the home for more than five years.\n\nOctober 4, 1999: Next month Dana Reeve will be present at the Barnes & Noble bookstore on 82nd & Broadway in New York City to autograph the book that she edited, Care Packages: Letters To Christopher Reeve From Strangers and Other Friends.

In the section about Superman Reeve candidly said about working with Donner, \"We would get sometimes about two shots a day, I mean. And Donner was very, very critical. He kept the standard of the movie up very high because he would come in sometimes and he would see a shot and say, 'Nope. That's not going to be good enough. We have to go back and do it again.' So, he was tough on everybody and yet he was fun. It was kind of tough love. I'm doing this for your own good. You're not going to want to see your name on this picture unless we get it right.\" Donner talked about getting called by the Salkinds to direct the movie, Reeve trying on an early version of the Superman costume after getting the part, getting Superman to fly, talking with Marlon Brando who played Superman's father Jor-El in the movie and also told a funny story about Gene Hackman having a mustache that he didn't want to shave to play Lex Luthor. Reeve also talked about Donner's directing style, \"I think what makes Dick Donner a unique director are two things: his desire to enable his co-workers to do their best, and a real innocence about the story so that he can look at it really from an audience's point-of-view and say, 'Tell me the story.'\"\n\nOctober 7, 1999: The ten 1999 Angelus Awards finalists were welcomed by the Honorary Committee, that includes Christopher Reeve, at the finalist luncheon for finalists and media before Jack Shea, President of the Directors Guild of America, annoounced the winners.

Washington said about Reeve, \"Chris is very much alive. He still has this great passion for living. He wants to do things. He wants to get up. He's at the forefront of raising money for nerve regeneration. He's preparing himself to be the first human guinea pig. He talks about one day walking into a premiere.\"\n\nNovember 1, 1999: The Washington Post reports that Capital Style magazine had a story about Christopher Reeve campaigning for the re-election of Republican Vermont Senator James M.

Several letters from the book were read by Philips. Reeve said that the closer scientists come to a cure, the more their egos and financial reward contaminate the process.

There's a lot of stuff.\"\n\nNovember 1, 1999: Mitchell Fink reported in his Daily Dish column in the New York Daily News that Christopher and Dana Reeve attended a party at the Rainbow Room on Thursday, October 28th for the movie The Bone Collector.

Reeve said, \"It's just me and the dog.\" He also told Fink that he has also taken his wheelchair \"off-roading. I've even gone to places where we pick apples.\" About The Bone Collector Reeve said, \"I'm happy that there's a disabled character who carries a movie.\" About the visit Denzel Washington and Queen Latifah made at their Westchester home, Dana had no idea that they were coming or that Latifah's real first name is also Dana when she extended her hand while introducing herself.

Mrs. Reeve said when asked how she keeps her spirits up and keeps focused and balanced, \"I am lucky that I tend to be a positive person by nature and, while I am also deeply rooted in reality, I find I can almost always find a way to remain so. I find doing things for others keeps my spirits up to some degree, but no one can do that all the time. Time spent with my very amusing seven-year-old helps a lot, as does singing.\" When asked if a letter provoked her to seek out and meet the sender in person Mrs. Reeve said, \"I did contact quite a few people by phone, and both Chris and I have met people who have needed some inspiration to get through an ordeal, but believe it or not, I am actually a very private person and would normally not seek someone out.\" Someone asked how as a caregiver, wife and friend to Christopher she continues to help him and keep from losing herself in the circumstances, as she answered with advice, \"it is so important as a caregiver not to become so enmeshed in the role that you lose yourself. It's neither good for you nor your loved one. I make sure I pursue my own interests and career, and Chris encourages me to do so.\" When a member of the crew here at the Christopher Reeve Homepage asked what her feelings are towards a proposed Superman movie with Nicolas Cage playing Superman, Mrs. Reeve said, \"The movie Heartbreaker is for Nicolas Cage's production company, Saturn Films, but he is not in it. It starts shooting in New York in the spring. As far as Nic playing \"Superman\" -- sure, why not. Although I don't think it's happening.\" When another member of the Christopher Reeve Homepage asked her about her hope to be in a musical and mentioned this website Mrs. Reeve answered without acknowledging this website, \"I actually just appeared in a musical in your own state at the NJ Shakespeare Festival in Madison. It was called Enter the Guardsman, and I starred with Robert Cucciolli (from Jekyl and Hyde. The festival has great stuff, so keep looking.\"\n\nNovember 3, 1999: The New York Rangers announced that the entire 1999-2000 Rangers club and Christopher Reeve will team up in an all-star night of hockey to benefit the NYR SKATE and the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundations.

Washington told the paper that \"out of the 12 people I talked to, everyone said that, at one point, they considered suicide.\" He explained that Reeve also talked about it, \"I spent time with Christopher Reeve and he talked about it too.\" At first while doing the interviews he was too series, then by the time he got up to Reeve, Washington was just talking. Reeve gave Washington understanding about painful seizures some quadriplegics experience when he asked him what it feels like, since he had one or two early on. Reeve told Washington, \"You know the feeling you get when you drink a cold ice drink too fast and you get that pain in the roof of your mouth? Multiply that by 50.\" Reeve also told him, \"If you had that, I would understand why he would want to check out because you don't know at any moment if it will just kill you or make you a vegetable. It's God's cruel joke.\"\n\nNovember 5, 1999: For the first time since his accident, Christopher Reeve was on Larry King Live live and took questions from callers.

King also caught up with the couple by talking about Reeve in Rear Window, their children, progress towards a cure for paralysis, as well as the movie Reeve is going to direct in the Spring called Heartbreaker. When King asked him how he is doing and if he gets better Reeve answered, \"Yes, I've had some recovery over time. I have sensation all the way down my spine now, and I'm able to breathe on my own off the hose for up to about 45 minutes at a time, which is great. And I'm able to use my diaphragm, which I'm not supposed to be able to do. Plus, I have no muscle atrophy, and my bone density is what it is before the accident.\"\n\nNovember 7, 1999: CNN/TIME had a special episode called Visions 21: Questions for the Next Century where Christopher Reeve was interviewed at Kessler Institute For Rehabilitation in West Orange, New Jersey while he was there for the signing of a New Jersey bill into law.

Sometimes when I just see somebody get up and walk down the hall, I get resentful.\" Wise Young and Evan Synder were among the scientists interviewed. Reeve also said, \"There's an intersection between politics, the media and celebrities. They all feed off each other. So I've always felt it was my responsibility to use that position intelligently.\" When asked what he has in mind to see when he is on his feet in a few years Reeve answered, \"My greatest desire, actually, is to go sailing again, to be somewhere off the coast of Maine, which used to be one of my favorite haunts. And then I probably would like to take my wife and family and disappear on the Greek islands and not be found for quite a while.\"\n\nNovember 8, 1999: Established author and friend of this homepage, Walter Oleksy, has an upcoming biography about Christopher Reeve that is very well-written and accurate, due out in January on Lucent Books as part of their People In The News series.

Chris described her as, \"An individual who really causes us to fall in love with her.\" On the subject of her fashion of wearing \"boyish\" clothes Chris said, \"She really didn't care what anybody thought about her. That's rare because a lot of people in Hollywood spend every waking momment worrying about whether they're being liked or whether they look right. They hope to run into somebody that can help them in their career, whatever. She didn't care about any of that.\" Christopher also talked of his experience of working with Hepburn in theatre: \"I auditioned for a play she was doing, called A Matter of Gravity. So I first met her at the audition. She was sitting way out in the dark and I remember trying to get a hold of the situation. I was very nervous. So I called out: \"Miss Hepburn I'm sure you would like to hear greetings from my grandmother, she went to school with you at Bryn Mawr.\" And out of the darkness came, \"Oh Bea, I never could stand her!\" I thought either I disappear, or, ... I had to take a minute to regroup, it was quite a shock. She actually gave me the part right there at the audition.\"\n\nNovember 25, 1999: An article titled \"Girl who supported Superman gets £4m\" was published in The Times.

Dana Reeve and the president of the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation were among Reeve's personal guests at the event sitting with acclaimed journalists from the National Press Club. During his speech Reeve said: \"We live in a time when the words 'impossible' and 'unsolvable' are not in the vocabulary of the scientific community and this makes it all the more difficult to understand why both the government and the private sector are not doing more to relieve the human suffering that can afflict anyone in an instant. And why does the average citizen who is stricken with a catastrophic illness or disability still have to fight their HMO's and their insurance companies for even the most basic necessities... Now it is time for America to take care of its own.\" During a Q & A session after the speech Reeve said: \"To put it very, very simply the future of the cure for spinal cord injury, as well as Parkinsons, Alzheimers, and stroke is going to be stem cells, which are completely undifferentiated cells and when placed in an environment they seem to have an intrinsic knowledge of what to do.\" Reeve said that he is currently involved in casting and pre-production for a movie called \"Heartbreaker\" which he plans to direct in the Spring. He describes it as \"a light, warm, romantic comedy set in New York.\" That evening Reeve was given the America's Role Model 2000 Award by the Ohlinger Foundation during a ceremony at the Kennedy Center.

At a press conference for SuperSkate 2000, Reeve said, \"I think all these movie stars really would've rather been hockey players anyway, you know. So it's a fantasy night for, you know, actors getting to be hockey players. You know it's really cool that people made such an effort.\" Dana Reeve concluded the pre-game excitement by singing the National Anthem and soon the game was underway. The White team was coached by Jeff Beukeboom and Susan Sarandon. The Blue team prevailed in overtime with goals from Cuba Gooding Jr. and Boomer Esiason.

But I'm grateful for the technology that's filtered down to help disabled people lead more productive lives.\n\nDecember 25, 1999: As part of a special campaign about talking to children and caring about how they feel, Johnson & Johnson is airing a series of four unusual and inspirational announcements across the country during the holiday season featuring Toni Morrison, Randy Newman, Ray Romano, and Christopher Reeve. Reeve directed the production of all four commercials and appears in one titled How to talk to your kids about faith. Reeve appears seated in his wheelchair against a plain white background and says: \"I became famous playing Superman - a man who could fly. Now I can't move or even breathe on my own. But after my accident when I knew I would live, I learned an important lesson: My disability need not be disabling. I could still pursue my career as an actor and director. So tell your kids not to become discouraged in the face of adversity. Tell them that - with faith - their bad days are just good days in disguise. You don't need any special eloquence to talk to your kids. Just the act of talking to them can be a spiritual experience. The right words will come. So tell them to have faith.\" The commercials end with the Johnson & Johnson logo and female voice saying: \"Just like you, we care about how your kids feel.\"\n\nDecember 29, 1999: Christopher Reeve was interviewed as part of BBC1's science program Tommorow's World: 2000 and Beyond which predicted developments expected to occur in the next century. When asked if he believed he would walk again Chris said: \"Absolutley, yes.\" On the subject of recovery he said: \"The day that I say goodbye to that ventilator I mean that will be tremendous, and that;s what's going to happen. The recovery won't be like lighting up a Christmas tree. It'll be incremental but it'll spread.\" The program highlighted that: \"His faith is based on remarkable research across the world which has seen paralysed rats walking again.\" Dr. Barth Green of the Miami Project stated that: \"Probably our major emphasis is transplantation and regeneration. That's taking people in wheelchairs and moving them out of wheelchairs.\" The program made its prediction for a cure to paralysis stating that: \"The Miami Project have regenerated part of a rat's spinal cord by transplanting in special cells. With other techniques about to go to human trials some paralysed people could be cured by 2020.\" A longer web version of the interview featured some more interesting comments. Christopher revealed that due to the recovery of his diaphragm he's able to go ninety minutes or more off the ventilator. He stated that the most promising discovery for a cure is that of stem cells: \"This is the most promising and also the most hopeful because it's the least invasive... It's a discovery that's only about a year and a half old, but it really showed tremendous progress.\" He also revealed his frustration with the medical community's reluctance to start human trials: \"Where we're stuck is to have the courage to be brave and try it on people. And also the money to conduct these human trials would be very, very expensive. So with my foundation I'm personally on a crusade to raise three hundred million dollars...\" Asked if he believes he will be walking within five to ten years he stated: \"No, at the present levels of spending and with the reluctance to move into human trials you could be looking at another fifteen to twenty years in a chair. And that's something that really angers me. It's something that I find unacceptable.... I'm talking personally. I'm saying I find it unacceptable. If other people can tolerate twenty years in a wheelchair more power to them, but I am angry because if the money was spent and there is the money availible, the scientist know enough now to conduct human trials but are afraid to do so. You know that is something that is hard to live with.\" (Video clips and the longer web text interview can both be reached by clicking here).\n\nBack to the top\n\nOther News pages:\n\n1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004\n\n2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014\n\n2015 | 2016 | 2017-2019\n\nNews Reports | Biography | Fundraising | Online Shop | Autobiography\n\nMovie Reviews | Contact Info | Have Your Say | Photo Gallery | Song Lyrics\n\nTranscripts | Mailing Lists | Interviews | Other Websites | About Us | Search\n\nThis page is Copyright © 1999-2019, Steven Younis.
