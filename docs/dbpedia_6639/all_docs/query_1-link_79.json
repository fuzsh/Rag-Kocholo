        "text": "There are many interesting facts about Superman, including some Connecticut connections.\n\nThe following article was written by Phil Devlin as part of his column, This Week in CT History:\n\nJust this past Tuesday, a first edition copy of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby sold at auction for over $100,000; however, that sum pales in comparison to the very first Superman comic book — which was published 75 years ago — and recently sold for over $2 million!\n\nThat price gives us an indication of the high popularity of Superman-related memorabilia in American popular culture and the reason why no fewer than six movies have been made about the \"Man of Steel,\" the latest of which is being released this week.\n\nCleveland residents and friends Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster first conceived of Superman in 1933. The first publication of Superman's story occurred in Action Comic #1 in June of 1938, after Siegel sold the rights to the story for $130. The story proved to be hugely popular, but Siegel and Shuster have derived very little money from Superman's popularity. Litigation against the current copyright holder of all things Superman by Siegel's family continues to this day.\n\nIt's interesting to examine the source of Siegel's idea of Superman. Many believe that it grew out of a crime that cost Siegel's father his life. A robber held a gun to Mr. Siegel's head, causing him to have a heart attack and die. Jerry claimed that the idea of Superman — whose preoccupation with \"truth, justice, and the American way\" is legendary — came to him in a dream following his dad's untimely death. Above all else, Siegel's Superman fights crime — no surprise for a boy who had just lost his dad to a criminal act.\n\nHere are some more interesting facts related to Superman:\n\nJoe Shuster's illustration of Superman holding a car in the air on the cover of the first issue of the comic book is one of the most recognizable illustrations in American pop culture.\n\nJune is the most popular month for releases of Superman-related material, as June 18th is the date given in the first comic book as Clark Kent's birthday.\n\nIllustrator Joe Shuster said in an interview once that the name \"Clark Kent\" was derived from two of the most popular leading male actors of the 1930s: Clark Gable and Kent Taylor.\n\nThe most well-known Superman movie to date starred Christopher Reeve in the leading role in 1978. Reeve's father, Franklin D. Reeve, taught at Wesleyan University in Middletown for 40 years. His step-mother, Helen Reeve, taught Russian at Connecticut College in New London for many years and currently lives in Higganum.\n\nOne of the first actors to be offered the role of Superman in 1978 was Newtown, CT, resident Bruce Jenner — Olympic decathlon winner in 1976. Jenner declined the role.\n\nMany believe that the role of Superman is cursed. George Reeves, who played Superman in the 1950s TV series, had an untimely death either through suicide or murder in 1959. Christopher Reeve also died young at age 52 after a fall from a horse paralyzed him.\n\nFullerton, CA, has a street named \"Lois Lane.\"\n\nIn one modern episode of Superman, the man of steel travels back in time to meet with William Shakespeare!\n\nActor Nicholas Cage has such a fondness for Superman that he named his son Kal-El — Superman's name on the planet Krypton!\n\nIn the 1978 movie, when the young Lois Lane is sitting on a train and sees Clark Kent run by the moving train, she is with her parents who are played by Noel Neill — the Lois Lane of the 1950s TV show — and Kirk Alyn, who played Superman in the 1948 movie!\n\nActor Sylvester Stallone of \"Rocky\" fame is a big fan of Superman and wanted desperately to play the lead in the 1978 film, but Marlon Brando, who played Superman's dad on Krypton, rejected him for the role. This rejection led to a bitter feud between the two.\n\nJon Bon Jovi and Shaquille O'Neill are also huge fans of the man of steel and sport large Superman tattoos.\n\nJerry Seinfeld is also a huge fan of Superman. Many believe that there is either an overt or subtle reference to Superman is every episode of the TV sitcom \"Seinfeld.\" That is not true, though he is referenced both verbally and visually in a majority of the episodes in the series.\n\n\"Man Of Steel\" opens on Friday, June 14, nationwide. The movie stars British actor Henry Cavill as Superman and Amy Adams as Lois Lane. Laurence Fishburne and Russell Crowe have significant parts in the movie as well. It's just the latest in the story of the nation's most popular superhero whose popularity still is going strong after 75 years!\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
