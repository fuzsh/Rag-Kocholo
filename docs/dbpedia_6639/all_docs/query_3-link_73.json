        "text": "The story of Christopher Reeve is an astonishing rise from unknown actor to iconic movie star, and his definitive portrayal of Clark Kent/Superman set the benchmark for the superhero cinematic universes that dominate cinema today. Reeve portrayed the Man of Steel in four ‘Superman’ films and played dozens of other roles that displayed his talent and range as an actor, before being injured in a near-fatal horseriding accident in 1995 that left him paralyzed from the neck down.\n\nAfter becoming a quadriplegic he became a charismatic leader and activist in the quest to find a cure for spinal cord injuries, as well as a passionate advocate for disability rights and care, all while continuing his career in cinema in front of and behind the camera, and dedicating himself to his beloved family.\n\nFrom the directors of McQueen, Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui, this film includes never-before-seen intimate home movies and an extraordinary trove of personal archive material, as well as the first extended interviews ever filmed with Reeve’s three children about their father, and interviews with the A-list Hollywood actors who were Reeve’s colleagues and friends. The film is a moving and vivid cinematic telling of Reeve’s remarkable story.\n\nCourtesy of Warner Bros. Discovery"
