        "text": "It's been 20 years since the death of beloved \"Superman\" star Christopher Reeve, and now, a new documentary is revealing details about the actor’s life before and after his paralyzing accident.\n\nIn 1995, Reeve fell from a horse at an equestrian competition, leaving him paralyzed from the neck down. Nine years later, he passed away at age 52 in 2004 after suffering a heart attack following an infection.\n\n\"With 2024 being the 20-year anniversary of our father’s death, that felt like the right time to reintroduce him and his heroic story to the world,\" his youngest son, Will Reeve, told Deadline.\n\nWill credited the team behind the documentary titled \"Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story,\" including directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui, adding, \"Everything came together in a way that we knew as a family we could be open and honest and vulnerable and hand everything over to them and see what they came back with. And that trust has been rewarded in a way that we’re just so thrilled about and can’t wait for the world to experience as well.\"\n\nCHRISTOPHER REEVE'S LOOK-ALIKE SON WILL REEVE ATTENDS STAR-STUDDED EVENT HONORING RYAN REYNOLDS\n\n\"Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story\" premiered at Sundance over the weekend and is seeking distribution.\n\nAll three of Reeve’s children, Matthew and Alexandra with Gae Exton, and Will with wife Dana Reeve, participated in the documentary, which shares incredible new details and behind-the-scenes footage from Reeve’s life.\n\n\"One of the joys is that they uncovered so much archival footage. So, there’s the outtakes from the original audition for ‘Superman,’ interviews with dad from the ’70s and ’80s when we were still young kids,\" Alexandra told The Wrap.\n\nShe added, \"Seeing him at the height of fame and even old home movies we hadn’t spent much time with – suddenly we’re uncovering these moments and seeing them on the big screen. All of that woven together has been really beautiful and powerful.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nOne of the more surprising revelations from the documentary is how Reeve’s relationship with his children changed following his accident.\n\nAccording to Variety, in the documentary, Matthew recalls that his father left to ski in France the day after he was born and often showed love through competition with his kids, like taking them skiing then racing ahead of them.\n\n\"Our love language was activity before,\" Alexandra told Variety. \"Suddenly, you’re spending time just hanging out in dad’s office looking each other in the eye and talking for two hours.\"\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Reeve acknowledged the changes, saying, \"I needed to break my neck to learn some of this stuff.\"\n\n‘SUPERMAN’ ACTOR CHRISTOPHER REEVE'S SON REMEMBERS HIM 15 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH: 'HE HAD AN IMPACT'\n\nThe film also touches on Reeve’s own difficult relationship with his father.\n\n\"It was difficult to breathe easy when he was around,\" Reeve said of his father, per The Guardian.\n\nThe outlet also noted Reeve’s children recall an unverified family tale of Reeve’s father ordering champagne when his son earned the role of Superman, mistakenly thinking he had won a part in the George Bernard Shaw play \"Man and Superman.\" After he realized the mix-up, Reeve’s father reportedly didn’t approve.\n\nReeve himself struggled with being known for \"Superman\" and the concept of being a hero.\n\nCHRISTOPHER REEVE'S 'SUPERMAN' CAPE SELLS FOR $193G AT AUCTION\n\nPrior to taking the role, he had concentrated on theater, which Alexandra said in the documentary was a refuge after a childhood \"so f--ked up\" by his parents' divorce at age 3, per The Guardian.\n\nJeff Daniels, who worked with Reeve onstage, recalled that fellow co-star William Hurt advised against taking the superhero role, saying, \"Don’t go, you’re going to sell out.\"\n\nThe experience of filming the movie with the iconic Marlon Brando wasn’t exactly what Reeve had hoped for, with The Guardian noting that he described Brando as \"phoning it in\" and that he \"took the $2 million and ran.\"\n\nAlexandra said, \"For Dad, Superman needed to be art.\"\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nAccording to The Guardian’s reporting, Reeve wasn’t thrilled to be in the sequels and called Superman IV \"a catastrophe from start to finish.\"\n\n\"I am not a hero, never have been, never will be,\" he reportedly said.\n\nWill explained to Variety that though he’s best known for the title role in \"Superman,\" it’s a smaller role in the Oscar-nominated \"Remains of the Day,\" co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, of which he was the proudest.\n\n\"He was so proud of his role in that movie. It’s not a big role. It’s an important role in the film,\" he told the outlet. \"He got to show a completely different side of himself. I knew how proud he was of that. Not that he wasn’t proud of ‘Superman’ … but if he were here, he wouldn’t choose ‘Superman,’ he’d choose ‘Remains of the Day.’ I don’t think about the ‘Superman’ films as much as I do about the swings he got took beyond this larger-than-life role.\"\n\n‘SUPERMAN’ PRODUCER ILYA SALKIND REVEALS SECRETS FROM THE SET: CHRISTOPHER REEVE HAD TO GAIN 40 POUNDS OF MUSCLE\n\nThe documentary also delves into his journey into advocacy following his accident.\n\nWhen he was first hospitalized, Reeve, according to The Guardian, was \"unable to avoid thinking the darkest thoughts\" and told his wife Dana, \"Maybe we should let me go.\"\n\nHe eventually worked through those difficult moments, but every day remained a struggle.\n\n\"We’d all wake up every morning and think anything could happen. But he would wake up and then remember all over again that he couldn’t move,\" Will told Variety.\n\nJANE SEYMOUR SAYS SHE ‘FELL MADLY IN LOVE’ WITH CO-STAR CHRISTOPHER REEVE: ‘WE DIDN’T LET ANYONE KNOW’\n\nReeve went through rehab with support from celebrities like Robert De Niro, Katherine Hepburn and Paul McCartney, according to The Guardian. The outlet also reported that in her interview in the film, Glenn Close recalled \"he was so terrified that he could die at any moment.\"\n\nHis famous friendship with Robin Williams is featured prominently in the documentary. The two met and were roommates at Juilliard as young men and stayed close friends all their lives.\n\nPer The Guardian, Close said in the documentary, \"I’ve always thought if Chris was still around, then Robin would still be alive.\"\n\nAs he adjusted to his new life, Reeve became heavily involved in disability advocacy and fundraising for research for spinal cord injuries.\n\nPAUL REUBENS, DAVID HASSELHOFF, CHRISTOPHER REEVE AND ROBIN WILLIAMS AMONG CELEBRITY ROOMMATES BEFORE FAME\n\n\"Things came easily to him early in his life,\" one of the film’s directors Ian Bonhote told Variety. \"Then, as Christopher said, ‘The one minority anyone can become part of in an instant, is disability.’ I think that there was a genuine opening to the world around him on a different level. It would be facile to say, ‘Oh, this is a triumph over adversity story,’ but it is turning adversity into opportunity.\"\n\n\"I think he was very conscious of that irony and the legacy of ‘Superman’ when people viewed his story and thought about him after the accident,\" Alexandra told the outlet. \"He talked about redefining what it is to be a hero… it’s an everyday person who survives despite overwhelming obstacles.\"\n\nReeve’s wife Dana, who died shortly after him from cancer in 2006, also gets her due in the documentary.\n\n\"What I’m just beyond touched by and so proud of is the way that the filmmakers tell my mom’s story, the way that my mom, Dana, features in this documentary because she featured so heavily as you might expect in our lives,\" their son, Will, told The Wrap.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe continued, \"As much of an honor as it is to be the son of Christopher Reeve, I’m also the son of Dana Reeve. Anytime I can tell her story and share with the world what a singular force she was makes me so proud.\"\n\nWill and his siblings are on the board of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, an organization \"dedicated to curing spinal cord injury by advancing innovative research and improving the quality of life for individuals and families impacted by paralysis,\" according to its website."
