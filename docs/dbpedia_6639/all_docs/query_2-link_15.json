Reeve, poet, translator of Russian literature, and father of actor and disability activist Christopher Reeve has died.\n\nNYS Writers Institute Director Donald Faulkner, a friend of Reeve, said, \"Like the cat that he used as a mask in his later poems, Franklin Reeve had a boundless curiosity, an electric energy, and many lives. As a poet, thinker, teacher, father, and friend he was fearless, fierce in his beliefs and his loyalties. His great, loving spirit abides.\"\n\nFull obituary in the New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/books/f-d-reeve-poet-and-translator-dies-at-84.html?ref=obituaries\n\nReeve visited the Institute to present poetry and jazz in 2008: http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/archives/fdreeve_bluecat08.html\n\nHere's a clip from his visit to the Institute: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSetkKNZoHA"
