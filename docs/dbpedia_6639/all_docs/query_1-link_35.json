Loved his art and the books he worked on. Byrne was as good or better but I usually associate him more with Marvel when I think of him.\n\nPost by crazy_asian_man on\n\nGary Frank - when he has the RIGHT INKER - is probably #1 for me.\n\nThen John Byrne/Karl Kesel for Reeve-Superman.\n\nOrdway I respect, but so far- Frank's images pop the most off the page for me right now as the most powerful.\n\nPost by Metallo on\n\nFrank has the advantage of modern printing. His use of Reeve’s likeness is the most blatant but he’s still a great artist in his own right.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nGary Frank maybe.\n\nThe artist has skill no doubt, and his inspiration is recognizably Reeve. But that face... it always looks like Kal just passed gas and was caught in the act.\n\nPost by crazy_asian_man on\n\n@roffellamo said:\n\nGary Frank maybe.\n\nThe artist has skill no doubt, and his inspiration is recognizably Reeve. But that face... it always looks like Kal just passed gas and was caught in the act.\n\nI admit that sometimes the expressions that Frank chooses to tell his stories are a little odd... (Much like Frank Quitley)- but his style is so unique in comics, that (again when he has the right inker), that I enjoy it immensely when he's drawing Superman."
