        "text": "In the prestigious competition The Global Undergraduate Awards 2023, which is called the Nobel Prize for juniors, Dominika Burešová, a student of Faculty of Electrical Engineering at CTU in Prague, was among the winners in the category of mathematics and physics. She succeeded with her bachelor's thesis in a competition of more than 2800 other male and female students from 409 universities worldwide. No one from the Czech Republic has ever won this prize in the fields taught at CTU.\n\nThe opponent of the thesis, Austrian physicist Karl Svozil, who is, among others, a collaborator of Nobel Prize winner Anton Zeilinger, evaluated the work of Dominika Burešová as a significant contribution to the theory of quantum logics, which far exceeds the requirements usually placed on bachelor theses. Prof. Petr Páta awarded Burešová the Dean's Prize of the Faculty of Physics for her thesis.\n\nShe found her love for mathematics at FEL\n\nDominika Burešová admits that it was only at FEL where she discovered her love for mathematics. \"In the second semester of my bachelor's studies at OI, I enrolled in a course in mathematics minor taught by Prof. Pták. From then on, I didn't want to do anything but mathematics,\" says Burešová. Soon after, she joined Prof. Mirek Navara's research group at the Department of Cybernetics and deepened her mathematical education by taking a number of courses designed for PhD students.\n\nDominika has many interests. In addition to lecturing at Czech and international conferences (for example, the IQSA 2022 conference), she used to swim competitively and play the soprano flute. Her positive relationship with music has remained to this day, and she prefers listening to classical music, especially Sergei Rachmaninov and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In addition, she enjoys reading classical literature and poetry.\n\nThe Global Undergraduate Awards 2023 have been held in Dublin since 2008. There are a total of 25 categories in the sciences and humanities. The judges select from fully anonymised undergraduate entries from around the world, without knowing the country of origin of the work.\n\nDominika Burešová is the third person from the Czech Republic to succeed in this prestigious competition. In 2015, the competition in the category of life sciences was won by Masaryk University student Hana Sedláčková. In the same category in 2017, another Masaryk University student, Tereza Gerguri, succeeded."
