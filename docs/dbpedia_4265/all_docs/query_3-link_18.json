In this paper, we utilize these techniques to investigate the quantum logical structures of the Peres-Mermin square and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-Mermin configuration. Our analysis uncovers analogous complete contradictions between classical and quantum predictions in a four-dimensional system involving two spin-1/2 particles.",
