        "text": "EDMONTON — I have been lucky enough to cover several world juniors. Tournaments in Toronto and Montreal, Buffalo and Orchard Park, and Ostrava and Trinec. Pre-tournament games in Ottawa and pre-tournament camps in Oakville and Plymouth. I plan to cover more, in Edmonton and Red Deer next winter, in Gothenburg in 2024, and beyond.\n\nThere are things about each of those events that I’ll remember — tearing my MCL in Prague and then walking on it undiagnosed for two weeks of excruciating pain in Ostrava, for starters!\n\nBut 2021 in Edmonton? Whew. None of the tournaments that follow will be anything like this one.\n\nAs I prepare to leave Rogers Place one last time after the gold medal game and the advertisements below are peeled off the boards to make way for the Oilers, I’ve spent more than 120 hours in this building, watched 28 games and written 13 stories across 12 days.\n\nIn the lead-up to the tournament, I wasn’t even confident it was going to happen. First, Canada shut down its Red Deer selection camp due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Positive tests followed for top German (Lukas Reichel), Austrian (Thimo Nickl) and Swedish (Karl Henriksson, William Wallinder, William Eklund and others) players in their camps. Team USA also lost several players, including returnee John Beecher and breakout Michigan star Thomas Bordeleau to what they’ve said were false-positive tests.\n\nThen, word that the charter flights sent to Europe to pick up the teams were too small.\n\nOnce the event started, it didn’t really feel like the world juniors in the early days. The Germans, down to just three lines of skaters while the rest of their team quarantined and playing on a back-to-back on Boxing Day, all but gave up against Canada with goalies Arno Tiefensee and Jonas Gahr struggling to make routine saves. The Austrians, promoted out of the championship’s second tier and into the top flight, were matched in a group against four of the hockey world’s top six nations, gave up 60-plus shots per game and failed to score until midway through their third game (a goal that stood out as their lone goal of the tournament).\n\nWithout fans, even tightly contested round-robin games such as the Czech Republic’s upset over Russia or Germany’s thrilling overtime win over Slovakia didn’t feel the same.\n\nEvery day, once I got my temperature checked, answered my daily COVID-19 questionnaire and made my way to the designated media area in between Rogers Place’s lower bowl and upper bowl (perched above the Chevrolet truck seen on TV at ice level), the rink felt emptier and more cavernous than it had when I’d covered the NHL bubble at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto five months earlier.\n\nFor one, the media presence was smaller. Because TSN’s crew was permitted inside the bubble proper and the IIHF decided not to credential media from outside Canada, I was the only independent media member in the building for the vast majority of the games (with a handful of local Edmonton reporters coming and going for Canada’s contests).\n\nMidway through the tournament, the person at the other end of the food hotline they’d set up for meals to be delivered to the media area knew it was either me or on-site IIHF media official Andre Brin calling.\n\nThis tournament also proved more conducive to good work in many ways, rather than less. In Toronto for the NHL’s media bubble, because the local media presence was much more pronounced, it was harder to coordinate non-Zoom one-on-one access with players and staff, the kind of access that breeds the storytelling we want to do here.\n\nBut because I was the only non-broadcast media member committed to covering every game of the event, I was also often the only media member Brin had to circle by late in the third period to ask if I had any postgame questions for the teams. When I did, it meant I always got to ask the first question of the scrums from the media tribune before it opened up to off-site reporters.\n\nHockey Canada media relations lead Dominick Saillant and USA Hockey on-site official Aaron Westendorf went above and beyond to facilitate individual access throughout the tournament too. Whenever I asked for a phone interview with a player or staff member, they arranged it. Westendorf, in particular, went above and beyond, going as far as to reach out to me to set up access when he knew I had something in the works on a specific player. In many cases, that meant I could avoid the Zoom conferences to spend more time colouring stories with players and staff individually than is afforded by a question and a follow-up on those joint media calls.\n\nBecause the two groups were playing out of the same building instead of in two cities, the days were also more packed than a typical world juniors, with three games usually beginning daily at noon local time and ending after 10 p.m., meaning I got to watch every second of the tournament live. Last year, for example, I travelled from Ostrava to Trinec to watch games with colleagues Chris Peters and Corey Pronman just once, which meant when everyone met in the quarterfinals in Ostrava, I’d seen a lot more of one group than the other (at least live).\n\nThough the days were long and cold (Brin eventually offered me hand and feet warmers!), the quiet of the arena also helped with player evaluation, narrowing my focus to the ice without the distractions of the crowd or racing around the rink to talk to sources, which typically happens.\n\nThere’s a real analysis benefit to this most unusual, never-to-be-repeated setting in that way. The pile of new notes I have on these players, notes that will inform my upcoming 2021 prospect pool rankings for all 31 NHL teams, is certainly more detailed than it was at the end of last year’s tournament.\n\nI could also hear more in the Edmonton world juniors bubble than the Toronto NHL one. I remember being shocked at how much colleague Thomas Drance picked up on in Edmonton for his not-safe-for-work Game of Chirps stories, but it made sense once I got here because the piped-in fan noise was quieter and my media station was closer to ice level.\n\nSo I could hear when Trevor Zegras shouted obscenities at Philipp Wimmer late in the Americans’ 11-0 blowout against the Austrians.\n\nI could watch the Czech bench in the dying moments of their stunning round-robin win over the Russians, bouncing up and down and celebrating like they’d just won the gold medal, belting out their anthem at the blue line, then screaming their way down the tunnel and into their locker room: “WOO! WOO! YEAH!”\n\nI could hear German head coach Tobias Abstreiter shout, “No way! No way! No way!” after a too-many-men penalty with 8:38 left in a tie game against Slovakia, and again on the penalty kill that followed when Senators super prospect Tim Stützle was hauled down in a foot race with no call. “Wake the fuck up! Jesus fucking Christ!” he berated at the officials.\n\nI could hear it when “Open your fucking eyes!” rang out from the Czech bench after Canadiens prospect Kaiden Guhle delivered a high hit on top 2022 prospect Stanislav Svozil that went uncalled in the quarterfinal game between Canada and the Czech Republic.\n\nAs the tournament played on, it began to feel more like the world juniors again, too. There was the annual unlikely hero, with Austrian goaltender Sebastian Wraneschitz making so many saves in the tournament opener that he had to leave the game because of cramps.\n\nThere was the kind of goal celebrations you’re more likely to get out of teenagers than NHL veterans, led by Leafs prospect Rodion Amirov’s good goal wave after he’d had one called back, and Matej Kaslik’s best Evgeny Kuznetsov imitation, flapping his wings to centre ice.\n\nThere were the Swedes, who were so antsy for a penalty call on Russian Mikhail Abramov at the end of the second period of their group-play game (a call that never came) that the entire bench practically crawled over the boards with their feet hanging over the ledge and sticks banging against the glass when it showed again on the JumboTron. There was even a familiar shout of “Ice cold beer here!” from the lower bowl in the second intermission of that Sweden-Russia game, which gave me a good laugh. (I’ve launched an investigation to find out who yelled it.)\n\nIn the quarterfinals, the tournament’s first four-game day at a single location, a 14-hour marathon included three tight quarterfinal fights from underdog German, Slovak and Czech teams and a stunning come-from-behind Finnish victory over the Swedes in a game that featured three unanswered Finland goals and a game winner with 25 seconds left.\n\nIn the semis, I was there to see the shocked reaction on Canada’s bench when Alex Newhook’s game-opening goal against Russia was shown on the JumboTron in a delayed video review (Newhook said he didn’t even think it went in) and when the U.S. bench lost its collective mind over a Matt Boldy blocked shot in the dying seconds of its nail-biting 4-3 win over the Finns.\n\nAnd when it was over and the Americans had blanked the Canadians — a team that looked unbeatable until it was beaten — 2-0 on Tuesday, the scene was the same.\n\nAt the Canadian end nearest my seat, Cole Perfetti, Peyton Krebs and Bowen Byram sat, hunched over and motionless, uninterrupted for several minutes until Jakob Pelletier and Dylan Cozens noticed, circling to comfort them with hugs and words.\n\nAt the other, it was the greatest moment in the young lives of two dozen American teenagers who’d opened their tournament with a loss and finished it with the only win that mattered.\n\nNext year’s world juniors will be played in the same city, at the same time of year, with the same 10 teams and many of the same players. It will look and feel and be much different.\n\nBut those feelings, the complete caving in of defeat and the complete ecstasy of triumph, they’ll be the same.\n\n(Photo: Scott Wheeler / The Athletic)"
