That, together with multiple recent contextual experiments, prompts improving the methods of generation of contextual sets and finding their features. The most elaborated contextual sets, which offer blueprints for contextual experiments and computational gates, are the Kochen–Specker (KS) sets. In this paper, we show a method of vector generation that supersedes previous methods. It is implemented by means of algorithms and programs that generate hypergraphs embodying the Kochen–Specker property and that are designed to be carried out on supercomputers. We show that vector component generation of KS hypergraphs exhausts all possible vectors that can be constructed from chosen vector components, in contrast to previous studies that used incomplete lists of vectors and therefore missed a majority of hypergraphs. Consequently, this unified method is far more efficient for generations of KS sets and their implementation in quantum computation and quantum communication. Several new KS classes and their features have been found and are elaborated on in the paper. Greechie diagrams are discussed.

The natural laws of the microscopic realm provide a fairly simple method to generate non-deterministic sequences of random numbers, based on measurements of quantum states. In practice, however, the experimental devices on which quantum random number generators are based are often unable to pass some tests of randomness. In this review, we briefly discuss two such tests, point out the challenges that we have encountered in experimental implementations and finally present a fairly simple method that successfully generates non-deterministic maximally random sequences.

The most natural semantics for these logics is a form of holistic semantics, where meanings behave in a contextual way. In this framework, the concept of quantum probability can assume different forms. We distinguish an absolute concept of probability, based on the idea of quantum truth, from a relative concept of probability (a form of transition-probability, connected with the notion of fidelity between quantum states). Quantum information has brought about some intriguing epistemic situations. A typical example is represented by teleportation-experiments. In some previous works we have studied a quantum version of the epistemic operations “to know”, “to believe”, “to understand”. In this article, we investigate another epistemic operation (which is informally used in a number of interesting quantum situations): the operation “being probabilistically informed”.

Quantum entropy in the measurements decides the quality and security of the random number generator (RNG). At the same time, it directly determines the extraction ratio of true randomness from the raw data, in other words, it obviously affects quantum random bits generating rate. In this work, we commit to enhancing quantum entropy content in the vacuum noise based quantum RNG. We have taken into account main factors in this proposal to establish the theoretical model of quantum entropy content, including the effects of classical noise, the optimum dynamical analog-digital convertor (ADC) range, the local gain and the electronic gain of the homodyne system. We demonstrate that by amplifying the vacuum quantum noise, abundant quantum entropy is extractable in the step of post-processing even classical noise excursion, which may be deliberately induced by an eavesdropper, is large. Based on the discussion and the fact that the bandwidth of quantum vacuum noise is infinite, we propose large dynamical range and moderate TIA gain to pursue higher local oscillator (LO) amplification of vacuum quadrature and broader detection bandwidth in homodyne system. High true randomness extraction ratio together with high sampling rate is attainable. Experimentally, an extraction ratio of true randomness of 85.3% is achieved by finite enhancement of the laser power of the LO when classical noise excursions of the raw data is obvious.

First, we obtain the distributions of both the coefficients and the only phase in the five-term decomposition of Acín et al. for an ensemble of random pure states generated by the Haar measure on U ( 8 ) . Furthermore, we analyze the probability distributions of two sets of polynomial invariants. One of these sets allows us to classify three-qubit pure states into four classes. Entanglement in each class is characterized using the minimal Rényi-Ingarden-Urbanik entropy. Besides, the fidelity of a three-qubit random state with the closest state in each entanglement class is investigated. We also present a characterization of these classes in terms of the corresponding entanglement polytope. The entanglement classes related to stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) are analyzed as well from this geometric perspective. The numerical findings suggest some conjectures relating some of those invariants with entanglement properties to be ground in future analytical work.

For single-qudit states, we present new entropic inequalities in the form of the subadditivity and condition corresponding to hidden correlations in quantum systems. We present qubit states in the quantum suprematism picture, where these states are identified with three probability distributions, describing the states of three classical coins, and illustrate the states by Triada of Malevich’s squares with areas satisfying the quantum constraints. We consider arbitrary quantum states belonging to N-dimensional Hilbert space as ( N 2 − 1 ) fair probability distributions describing the states of ( N 2 − 1 ) classical coins. We illustrate the geometrical properties of the qudit states by a set of Triadas of Malevich’s squares. We obtain new entropic inequalities for matrix elements of an arbitrary density N×N-matrix of qudit systems using the constructed maps of the density matrix on a set of the probability distributions. In addition, to construct the bijective map of the qudit state onto the set of probabilities describing the positions of classical coins, we show that there exists a bijective map of any quantum observable onto the set of dihotomic classical random variables with statistics determined by the above classical probabilities. Finally, we discuss the physical meaning and possibility to check derived inequalities in the experiments with superconducting circuits based on Josephson junction devices.

The principle states that the quantumness of physical phenomena, that is, the specific character of physical phenomena known as quantum, implies that our predictions concerning them are irreducibly probabilistic, even in dealing with quantum phenomena resulting from the elementary individual quantum behavior (such as that of elementary particles), which in turn implies that our theories concerning these phenomena are fundamentally algebraic, in contrast to more geometrical classical or relativistic theories, although these theories, too, have an algebraic component to them. It follows that one needs to find an algebraic scheme able make these predictions in a given quantum regime. Heisenberg was first to accomplish this in the case of quantum mechanics, as matrix mechanics, whose matrix character testified to his algebraic method, as Einstein characterized it. The article explores the implications of the Heisenberg method and of the QPA principle for quantum theory, and for the relationships between mathematics and physics there, from a nonrealist or, in terms of this article, “reality-without-realism” or RWR perspective, defining the RWR principle, thus joined to the QPA principle.

Two-level quantum systems are the basic elements connecting the binary nature of classical computation with the settlement of quantum processing. Despite this, their design depends on specific quantum systems and the physical interactions involved, thus complicating the dynamics analysis. Predictable and controllable manipulation should be addressed in order to control the quantum states in terms of the physical control parameters. Resources are restricted to limitations imposed by the physical settlement. This work presents a formalism to decompose the quantum information dynamics in S U ( 2 2 d ) for 2 d -partite two-level systems into 2 2 d − 1 S U ( 2 ) quantum subsystems. It generates an easier and more direct physical implementation of quantum processing developments for qubits. Easy and traditional operations proposed by quantum computation are recovered for larger and more complex systems. Alternating the parameters of local and non-local interactions, the procedure states a universal exchange semantics on the basis of generalized Bell states. Although the main procedure could still be settled on other interaction architectures by the proper selection of the basis as natural grammar, the procedure can be understood as a momentary splitting of the 2 d information channels into 2 2 d − 1 pairs of 2 level quantum information subsystems. Additionally, it is a settlement of the quantum information manipulation that is free of the restrictions imposed by the underlying physical system. Thus, the motivation of decomposition is to set control procedures easily in order to generate large entangled states and to design specialized dedicated quantum gates. They are potential applications that properly bypass the general induced superposition generated by physical dynamics.

We have adopted the tools of quantum entropy analysis to investigate the conditions under which the security properties of quantum bit commitment can be circumvented. Our study has revealed that cheating the binding property requires the quantum system acting as the safe to harbor the same amount of uncertainty with respect to both observers (Alice and Bob) as well as the use of entanglement. Our analysis also suggests that the ability to cheat one of the two fundamental properties of bit commitment by any of the two participants depends on how much information is leaked from one side of the system to the other and how much remains hidden from the other participant.

We here define those which use kinship relationships to define systems. A finite structure we call a partially defined quasigroup (or pdq, as stated by Definition 1 below) on a dictionary (called a natural language) allows prediction of certain anthropological descriptions, using homomorphisms of pdqs onto finite groups. A viable history (defined using pdqs) states how an individual in a population following such history may perform culturally allowed associations, which allows a viable history to continue to survive. The vector states on sets of viable histories identify demographic observables on descent sequences. Paths of vector states on sets of viable histories may determine which histories can exist empirically.

Here, brief summaries are given of a series of key results of different sorts that have been obtained since the final elements of the Copenhagen interpretation were offered and it was explicitly named so by Heisenberg—in particular, results from the investigation of the behavior of quantum probability since that time, the mid-1950s.

To distinguish such approach from quantum physics, it is called quantum-like. It is applied to modeling socio-political processes on the basis of the social laser model describing stimulated amplification of social actions. The main aim of this paper is establishing the socio-psychological interpretations of the quantum notions playing the basic role in lasing modeling. By using the Copenhagen interpretation and the operational approach to the quantum formalism, we analyze the notion of the social energy. Quantum formalizations of such notions as a social atom, s-atom, and an information field are presented. The operational approach based on the creation and annihilation operators is used. We also introduce the notion of the social color of information excitations representing characteristics linked to lasing coherence of the type of collimation. The Bose–Einstein statistics of excitations is coupled with the bandwagon effect, one of the basic effects of social psychology. By using the operational interpretation of the social energy, we present the thermodynamical derivation of this quantum statistics. The crucial role of information overload generated by the modern mass-media is emphasized. In physics laser’s resonator, the optical cavity, plays the crucial role in amplification. We model the functioning of social laser’s resonator by “distilling” the physical scheme from connection with optics. As the mathematical basis, we use the master equation for the density operator for the quantum information field.
