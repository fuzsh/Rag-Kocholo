Clicks in a counter Interpret them as information Maybe just trash, maybe meaningful Black box scheme:\n\n3 Formalization of quantum information Classical bit code: t = 1 „true“ and f= 0 „false“ Quantum bit („qubit“): x a = at+bf form a continuum, [with |a| 2 +|b| 2 = 1, a,b in C] „Coherent superposition“ of t and f\n\n4 (In)Consistency Quantum mechanics (so far consistently) achieves the implementation of classically inconsistent information into a single quantum bit.\n\n5 Idea Classically distinct (contradicting) information is represented at once by a single qubit and then piped through a quantum processor I.e., 1 qubit may represent 2^1 bits By combining qubits one can represent 2^n classical bits by n qubits Hope for exponential speedup!\n\n6 Some qubit features Qubits are contextual. A quantum bit may appear different, depending on the method by which it is inferred. Qubits cannot be copied or ``cloned'' This due to the fact that the quantum evolution is reversible, i.e., one-to-one. Qubits do not necessarily satisfy classical tautologies such as the distributive law. Qubits are coherent superpositions of classically distinct, contradicting information. Qubits are subject to complementarity. Qubits obey quantum logic which is different from classical logic.\n\n7 Complementarity and quantum cryptography principal impossibility to measure two observables at the same time with arbitrary position. If you decide to precisely measure the first observable, you ``loose control'' over the second one and vice versa. By measuring one observable, the state of the system undergoes a ``state reduction'' or, expressed differently, ``the wave function collapses'' and becomes different from the original one. This randomizes a subsequent measurement of the second, complementary observable: in performing the subsequent measurement, one obtains some measurement results (i.e., clicks, you remember?), but they dont tell us much about the original qubit, they are unusable crap.\n\n8 How can it be done? Assume that Alice sends Bob a qubit and an eavesdropper is present. This eavesdropper is in an inescapable dilemma: neither can the qubit be copied, nor can it be measured. The former case is forbidden in quantum information theory and the letter case would result in a state reduction which modifies Alice's qubit to the point where it is nonsense for Bob. Bob and Alice can realize this by comparing some of their results over a classical (insecure) channel.\n\n9 Quantum computing Universal quantum computation model: U(n) unitary transformations in n-dim Hilbert space Universal U(2) gate: Factoring,...\n\n10 Price of parallelism?
