So I thought I would look up the site to find if there was anything new. What a marvellous site it is now - the result of so much hard work and inspiration - would that all sites were like yours! I did not find the answer to my query, but that did not matter, because I learned so much more about this wonderful composer. A score by Julius TOLDI, which was performed in 1925 at one of Bach's concerts, has turned up - \"Wanderszizzen\" - 9 Variations on a Rumanian Folk Song. Starting with a single oboe, it ends up with a huge 'Gurrelieder' scoring and we are engaged in copying it on to a synthesiser, to see if it is worth resurrecting. We know about his life post 1933 in USA - hardly anything about his Vienna days, so like you with Herbstsinfonie, I am making lots of phone calls! Many thanks for your past support. Best wishes, Jared\n\njwood(AT)mail.mcneese.edu aus/from Lake Charles, Louisiana schrieb/wrote (12/04/2006):\n\nWhat a wonderful website! What an astounding amount of important information, more than I can absorb at one time, so I have bookmarked it to return to, as I know I will, many times. I love Marx's music and have the 4 ASV recordings. I was sorry to see that their other Marx projects have been cancelled. But I was thrilled to hear your orchestrations of \"The New Year's Hymn\" and \"The Mountain Hymn.\" What wonderful music!!!! I wish you could get someone to record them, though I would be delighted to buy your synthesized versions were they on a CD. Such glorious music!! Thank you for your labor on behalf of this great composer. I am 60 years old and have been listening seriously to music since I was a young boy, but it is only within the past few months I have heard of Joseph Marx and heard his music. I am very happy that I finally have. It obviously has much to do with your efforts.

He told me that he is saddened by the idea that so few of Marx's beautiful music has been published ... indeed nothing, he thought.\n\nActually, I never have heard a single piece of Marx, although I love Mahler, Schreker & Korngold and the romantic Schoenberg, until I came across the four CD's which were recently released. I listened to the sound clips and immediately ordered all of them ... desperately waiting for these CD's. I am sure that Hans Frank will be very happy to be able to finally listen to this great music.\n\nOne more thing: people should be more determined and self-conscious with regards to beauty. I myself have recently written an article http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505088 about aestetics and the two extremes: irritating cacophonic white type noise on the one side; and monotony on the other. Art lies inbetween. Hans told me that during a lecture, Joseph Marx was just expressing the same ideas.\n\nI wish you all the best for your future work!\n\nJemand / Someone schrieb/wrote (05/07/2005):\n\nWebmaster Berkant Haydin aus/from www.joseph-marx.org schrieb/wrote (28/06/2005):\n\nKostja aus/from Erlangen schrieb/wrote (28/06/2005):\n\nclaudia.rueggeberg(AT)tele2.at aus/from 8010 GRAZ schrieb/wrote (04/06/2005):\n\nwendel schrieb/wrote (22/05/2005):\n\nLieber Herr Haidyn!\n\nGanz schnell, weil gerade von Italien aus gefunden.\n\nHerzlichen Gruss\n\nWOW\n\nMarx, Joseph, österr.

[…]\". - Joseph Marx erhielt bereits während seiner Gymnasialzeit Unterricht in Geige, Klavier und Komposition, studierte dann an der Univ. Graz Philosophie und Musikwissenschaft. Seit 1910 lebte er als freischaffender Komponist in Graz. 1914 wurde er Prof. der Musiktheorie und Komposition an der Wiener Akademie für Musik, deren Direktor er 1922-25 war. 1924-27 leitete Marx die der Akademie angeschlossene Fachhochschule für Musik. 1947 wurde er Honorarprofessor der Musikwissenschaften an der Univ. Graz, 1949 an der Akademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst in Wien. Zu seinen Schülern zählte u.a. Johann Nepomuk David. Marx war Musikkritiker u.a. der \"Wiener Zeitung\". Er komponierte im nachromantisch-impressionistischen Stil Orchester- und Kammermusik; sein Liedschaffen stand unter dem Einfluß Hugo Wolfs.

This obviously neglected composer should be in everybody's catalogue along with the other great masters, it's certainly not to be missed by anyone who likes to indulge in the late romantics and these compositions should certainly be given more concert performances From the works I've listened to so far I certainly want to hear more.

I have recently purchased the CD of the \"Nature Trilogy\". What beautiful music! I am so glad that there has been a belated re-awakening of interest in composers who, towards the end of their lives were condemned as \"old-fashioned Romantics\"-Bortkiewicz, Holbrooke, Korngold and of course, Marx to name just a few.I look forward to the issue of further CDs.\n\nBerkant aus/from this website schrieb/wrote (04/08/2003):\n\nNo, there are no solo piano or two piano scores of the symphony.

Thanks\n\nharlos(AT)unt.edu aus/from Denton, Texas USA schrieb/wrote (04/08/2003):\n\nDear Herr Haydin,\n\nThank you for your incredible efforts to bring attention to this wonderful composer. My interest in Marx was recently renewed when I came across the score to the Suite for cello and piano in F major in a used bookstore. I am a pianist on the faculty of the University of North Texas, and in our music library we have orchestral parts for an arrangement of the Minuet from this suite which was published by Universal. You can find the listing at http://iii.library.unt.edu/ . I hope to perform the entire suite sometime in the next year or two. I will notify you of any plans.\n\nMeanwhile, I am looking forward to hearing the orchestral music.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDr. Steven Harlos\n\nottfried.hafner(AT)kug.ac.at aus/from Graz schrieb/wrote (02/08/2003):\n\nKathrin Holzer, bigflower(AT)gmx.at aus/from Grambach schrieb/wrote (27/07/2003):\n\nScherzer Eduard aus/from A 3400 Weidling schrieb/wrote (12/07/2003):\n\nAngelika Meyer schrieb/wrote (09/07/2003):\n\nbulla(AT)itp.tu-graz.ac.at aus/from Graz schrieb/wrote (27/06/2003):\n\nStefan Esser, puetz-esser(AT)t-online.de aus/from Leverkusen schrieb/wrote (21/06/2003):\n\ngloricoates(AT)yahoo.com aus/from Munich schrieb/wrote (02/06/2003):\n\nA beautiful article...so that I want to hear the music.\n\nmugu_cliffford(AT)37.com aus/from lome togo schrieb/wrote (23/05/2003):\n\nkeep on the deal\n\nJemand / Someone schrieb/wrote (03/05/2003):\n\nAlan Schweitzer schweitzeralan(AT)hotmail.com aus/from Avon, Ohio schrieb/wrote (30/04/2003):\n\nI came across the name of Joseph Marx in a recent list of relatively unknown works and did a little research. According to the few reviews of his works, in particular, his \"Autumn symphony\" the style is that of a luxuriant romantic impressionism, a style generally not germane to German style, and I am referring here to apparent impressionist tendencies. According tothe brief review his orchestral works are similar to those of Mahler, yes, understandably, but also the reviewer notes influences of Debussy, Scriabin, and Bax. The last three composers figure among my favorites. If there are hints and similarities of Debussy, Scriabin and Bax in Marx's work, I would very much like to get ahold of his work. Nothing is listed in amazon save a piano sonata which may be quite interesting. I like Bruckner and Mahler but I prefer French, English and Scandinavian music. Any advice? I would most appreciate it.\n\nAlan Schweitzer\n\nMahash Giru aus/from New Delhi, India schrieb/wrote (28/04/2003):\n\nLieber Freund von Musik,\n\nich schaetze mich gluecklich um gefunden zu haben diese wunderbare Tempel von klangvolle Musik aus dem schoene Oesterreich.

The lushness and depth of these works is quite remarkable.\n\nI also own the Romantisches Klavierkonzert, the disc of Quartets and the Violin Sonata. I eagerly await the next releases. Perhaps ASV has plans to record the Herbstsinfonie?\n\nThank you for providing a worthwhile and informative website about Joseph Marx.\n\ncolin(AT)mozart-heals.com aus/from St Albans, UK schrieb/wrote (16/03/2003):\n\nI just heard the first five minutes of the 'Symphonische Nachtmusik' from ASV's forthcoming disc on a CD review broadcast.\n\nHow can this marvellous music have remained unknown for so long!\n\nThank you for a great website.\n\nBest regards\n\nColin Healy\n\nLuc DESECK, luc.deseck(AT)west-vlaanderen.be aus/from 8500 KORTRIJK - BELGIUM schrieb/wrote (14/03/2003):\n\nRico aus/from Chemnitz schrieb/wrote (13/03/2003):\n\nudomarxrade(AT)t-online.de schrieb/wrote (10/02/2003):\n\nPeter Vujica <vujica(AT)nusurf.at> schrieb/wrote (04/02/2003):\n\ntomoko.uchino(AT)verizon.net aus/from New York schrieb/wrote (10/01/2003):\n\nHi, there.
