        "text": "Dear Markus,\n\nI'm happy to see you've found the time to enter an essay into this year's competition. Like last year's, it's a highly intriguing and insightful piece, and I'll spend some quality time studying it further. I like the way you frame the discussion: undecidability and related phenomena need not fuel defeatist stances, you enlist them in an optimist message about our ability of getting to know what's there to know at all.\n\nThis bears some similarity to what Karl Svozil has called the 'third path' in dealing with these notions: most of the time, the issue is either neglected as an artifact, an esoteric mathematical rumination not more relevant to the (physical) world than the precise number of angels on the head of a pin, or on the other extreme, enlisted into grim pronouncements of our doomed quest for knowledge. Trying to find a third (or perhaps 'middle') way of taking it seriously, even as the starting point of some constructive challenge to outdated ideas that force us to engage with some core assumptions is a welcome change of pace.\n\nBefore I go into deeper discussion, however, I'd like to ask a question, if I may. The sort of structural realism you champion derives from a venerable tradition, stretching back at least to William James, Bertrand Russell, and Arthur Eddington. But it seems to me that a challenge raised against such views by the mathematician Max Newman (known these days generally simply as 'Newman's objection') hasn't really found a good answer. That challenge essentially consists in pointing out that if everything you know about some domain is the relational structure it fulfills, then really, all you can answer are questions of cardinality---for if there's the right number of elements, any structure will fit, so to speak.\n\nDo you think that's a problem for your view? If not, how do you propose it is overcome, or why doesn't it apply?\n\nBest of luck in the contest!\n\nCheers\n\nJochen\n\nDear Jochen,\n\nthank you so much for taking the time to read my essay -- and, in particular, for the excellent comments!\n\nI'm glad that you've pointed me to Karl Svozil's piece. I wasn't aware of it, and I've put it on my reading list.\n\nFor now, let me comment only on Newman's objection. I'm not an expert on all of the nuanced ways that it is interpreted in detail, and on the particular versions of structural realism to which it would apply. But here's how I understand it in the spirit of the view sketched in my essay.\n\nYes, if you take some large enough domain, you can put any structure on it. But consider the conclusion: that all we can make, in effect, are cardinality claims. The formulation of this conclusion already indicates the limitations of Newman's argument: it assumes that there is a ``domain of things'' that could be counted, and \"structure\" is simply a notion of relations in set-theoretical terms.\n\nHowever, the view that I've sketched would exactly deny this. What I mean by \"structure\" is something much more general: anything that a consistent theory talks about -- not necessarily a \"set with relations\". In particular, it is nothing that would supervene on a \"collection of objects\".\n\nI think that this is also the reason why, as far as I understand, Newman's objection is typically used as an argument against *epistemic* structural realism, not *ontic* structural realism as I (and much more deeply, Ladyman) defend it. In the former case, you can think of the world as a collection of \"real things\" (for example particles), but we have no access to these directly. Based on this metaphysical assumption (that I reject), a set-theoretic understanding (a mathematical notion of relations with no physical primacy) is natural, and Newman's objection seems perhaps applicable.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is probably much more deeply analyzed by the supporters of ontic structural realism. I'd like to read more about that.\n\nThanks again for your comments on my essay! I'm looking forward to reading yours.\n\nBest,\n\nMarkus\n\nDear Markus,\n\nthanks for your reply. I think you're right regarding OSR and the Newman Objection, at least as it's usually conceived. I'm not totally convinced by the argument, though. To me, there seems to be a threat of a priori considered to be distinct structures collapsing onto one another---any claim to theory A giving the 'right structure' can be challenged by some theory B yielding the same predictions. Essentially, you can mirror one theory within another---roughly, via something like a GÃ¶del numbering, but more explicitly, if you have a theory which allows for universal computation, you can just 'code up' a simulation of whatever other theory you want to say gives the 'right structure' within the former.\n\nSay you've got a fully worked-out version of string theory, and want to claim that hence, that gives you the full 'real structure' of the world, and with that, everything that can be said about it (in the sense of everything there is to be said). But then I come along, and encode string theory into some electromagnetic field configuration that corresponds to a computer's memory containing a program that simulates string theory with some initial conditions, and derive all the same predictions from (presumably rather complicated) calculations using nothing but Maxwell's equations---in what sense, then, is the structure of the world that of string theory, and not that of Maxwell's electromagnetism? (Apologies, by the way, if you address this in your essay, unfortunately I still haven't gotten to digesting it fully.)\n\nOf course, there's going to be more structure than just the Maxwell equations, corresponding to some complicated initial state, but there's presumably some initial state in the string theoretic description too, plus there will be very many programs on many different computational architectures---many different field configurations---leading to the same predictions.\n\nBut I'd need some time to make this thought more precise. I think I'm otherwise quite happy with accepting OSR as a live option---I've in a sense chosen the other way out: rather than conclude that structure is all there is, I presume that what there is will always outrun our ability to fully describe (which description, I agree, is essentially structural), largely motivated by something like the above worry on structural underdetermination (regarding the question of implementing a computation).\n\nI'll hold off on further comments until I've gone through your essay. I can say already, however, that it's excellent, and deserves to go far in this contest.\n\nAs a final remark, I've found many articles of Svozil highly illuminating on this topic. I think he's in Vienna, too, no (albeit at the TU)? Maybe you should strike up a discussion and see if you find some common ground!\n\nCheers\n\nJochen\n\nDear Markus,\n\nI've finally gotten round to giving your essay the reading it deserves. I think it's in some ways very close to my own thinking, and a few years back, I would've heartily endorsed all of its claims---indeed, in my entry to the 'It from Bit'-FOXi contest, I expressed similar reservations against 'thingism': \"The world is then not something comprised, at the very bottom, of things, but rather, it is given by a web of relations.\"\n\nBack then, I appealed to a notion of 'relative facts' to encompass roughly what you call 'differentiations' of a structure---the idea being that the questions not answered by a given structure have answers only relative to other events, sort of like an electron's state is 'spin up' relatively to a measurement apparatus' registering the appropriate measurement, whereas to you, I gather, the 'spin up'-value would be a further differentiation of the structure giving the system's state.\n\nOne worry, to me, is then how differentiation happens. If we, say, make a measurement on a quantum system, to stay with the example, does this then entail a literal further specification of the state---i. e. does the structure go from S in which the question of the electron's spin is indeterminable to S' in which it has a definite answer? If so, that seems hard to square with a purely structural reading---for if there were some further structure that determines what value is provided, then we simply didn't have the full structure to begin with (something which will be hard to square with the various limitative theorems of QM).\n\nBut on the other hand, if differentiation happens essentially randomly, then that process does not have a formulation in terms of structure---so in a way, considering this as a structural view is like having a 'computational' universe that every now and then has to look at an oracle to draw a genuinely random bit from a hat.\n\nThe third alternative would be to go to a kind of 'many worlds'-view, where all differentiations already exist---something like the 'relative facts'-version. But it seems questionable whether that's then still a 'structural' view---after all, if we have some structure S, allowing for differentiations S' and S'', and we say that those differentiations are already out there---say, again, in the two distinct possibilities of an electron's spin value in a superposition---then these differentiations, from the point of view of us who only have the description according to S, take the role of the 'things' that the structure is a structure off, and an experiment will tell us which it is---although of course, it will yield both answers.\n\nRegardless, I think your criticism of 'thingism' is apt, on the whole---I've been trying to steer a kind of 'middle way', having become skeptical that pure structure can yield enough of a world to ground our experiences, but all my conclusions there are very tentative. I don't believe that there's a world of 'fundamental' facts that's simply given to us, a container of stuff to discover; but I'm also not sure that the mere specification of relations does not leave it just all empty, so to speak.\n\nAnyway, I think this is an intriguing topic to explore. You may actually find some congenial notions in my essay this year, and the Found. Phys. article that spawned it---while I agree that GÃ¶del's results, as such, don't have applicability to the physical world, they, together with a great many other similar ideas---the unsolvability of the halting problem, Russell's paradox, and others---are really a manifestation of a more general structure, captured in a fixed point theorem due to F. W. Lawvere. This I try and connect with the measurement process in quantum mechanics, in a way which seems very apt to your idea of 'differentiation'. I view it slightly differently, based on additional considerations, but I believe the framework fits.\n\nCheers\n\nJochen\n\nDear Jochen,\n\nthanks for your reply. The time you take for this is highly appreciated!\n\nBefore going into details of what you write, I think that the answer to many of your comments is: it depends on what we mean by \"structure\". In my essay, I'm not really defining it properly (in particular in the section on the physical world). Any serious philosophical approach that tries what I've sketched will have to give a clear(er) definition. Also OSR has to do that (and I suspect that it does, but they mean something slightly different from what I mean).\n\nRegarding your example of the Maxwell's equations and String Theory, I think that what this tells us is that we should define \"structure\" in terms of \"big enough equivalence classes\", or admit \"coarse enough isomorphisms\" when we define it. In particular, there may be two theories T and T' that talk about the same structure S. I would say that your example of Electromagnetism (i) and String Theory (ii) is of that kind: two theories that give the *same* structure.\n\nBeing a structural realist in *that* sense, I'd say that there is no ontological difference between the statements that \"(i) is true\" and that \"(ii) is true\". But I admit that this does not really come across in my essay, because I'm not giving a clear-enough definition of \"structure\". And there are many questions that such a view leaves open.\n\nYou are right that it would be nice to talk more to Karl Svozil; I've only met and chatted with him once, and he seems to have many clever ideas and insights that touch these topics.\n\nBut I'd also find it nice to meet you in person at some point in the near future. Perhaps I can invite you to visit IQOQI when the Corona crisis is over? It would be a lot of fun to chat in person! Also, we have a regular Physics-Philosophy-Meeting here that you might enjoy.\n\nNow, regarding your second email and quantum mechanics:\n\nAgain, I was clearly not detailed enough to say what I mean by structure or differentiation in this context. That is certainly a drawback of my essay (also due to space limits, of course, but also I don't really know how to do the definitions properly -- it's more an idea than something fully worked out.)\n\nHere's what I do *not* mean. I don't mean to say that the world now is structure S, and once we learn an additional measurement outcome, it evolves into a more differentiated structure S'.\n\nInstead, consider the quantum world on all of spacetime. There are certain \"real patterns\" in accordance with quantum physics: for example, certain events that happen earlier on (perhaps \"preparations\") are in correspondence with frequencies of certain types of events later on (correlations with \"measurement outcomes\"). This would be structure S.\n\nA more differentiated structure S' would be the world according to de Broglie-Bohm theory: additional (unobservable) events earlier on that are deterministically correlated with outcomes later on. The corresponding theory T' makes more claims than T, and so S' would be more differentiated than S.\n\nIn other words: I'm just saying that views in which quantum probabilities are not \"knowledge *about* the world\" are in some structural sense less differentiated than view in which they are. So a structural view may increase one's confidence to accept views of the former kind.\n\nI'm really curious to find out about your \"middle way\", but I'll postpone commenting on it until I have read your essay. I'm having a busy time with some deadlines next week, but I'm eager to read your essay directly after that.\n\nBest,\n\nMarkus\n\nDear Marcus,\n\nI have you to thank for engaging with my comments in such an open way! These contests are always at their best when they stimulate frank exchanges on views that may go slightly beyond what one would normally put into a journal article or the like.\n\nAnd I'd very much like to come for a visit to Vienna---although thinking about traveling plans seems almost frivolous these days. Perhaps one lesson we could take away from the present situation is that we should try to create more and better avenues for online exchange of views---something like virtual research/discussion groups, where people interested in some topic can congregate, discuss with either live-sessions or in a chat/forum based manner, exchange drafts for articles/request comments and the like. Could be as simple as a Teams channel, or something like that.\n\nBut back to the things themselves, as Husserl said---or to their absence, as it were. Regarding the 'modding out' of equivalences between structures, I'm afraid that this might leave us with altogether too little in the way of substance to account for the world and out experience within it---if we agree that in my example, electromagnetism and string theory yield in some sense the same structure, then one could also draw in all manner of 'different' systems---say, for example, the three body problem is at least conjectured to be computationally universal, so you could encode the requisite data into its initial configuration, and then just let Newton's laws do the rest. Or, of course, any other theory that allows for universal computation.\n\nSo fine, one might try to say that then, most of the structure is in the initial condition---the program, so to speak. But this, too, is far from unique: you can instantiate the three body problem with all manner of initial states, implementing different Turing machines that then instantiate the requisite computation from different initial conditions. In each case, that would add some constant number of bits to the length of the initial program, corresponding to the specification of a Turing machine to be simulated.\n\nSo suppose that you have an initial condition for the three body problem that can be specified using n bits, such that the resulting system implements the 'structure of the world' in some sense, by essentially implementing some Turing machine T executing the n bit program. Then, it seems to me you could find a TM T' such that it takes at most n O(1) bits input to implement the same program, with the O(1) factor corresponding to T' simulating T. But then, have you really said more about the world other than 'it contains at least n bit of information' if you specify its structure in this way?\n\nI think this is essentially the Newman problem again. In some sense, all 'universal' structures---structures corresponding to theories allowing for universal computation---are equivalent: whatever you can describe using one, you can describe using another, with at most some constant overhead.\n\nMaybe one could try to argue for parsimony, and single out that structure which yields the most compact specification---which has the problem that the question which one this is will be undecidable, due to the uncomputability of Kolmogorov complexity. Or, one could try to adapt the various attempts at solving the threat of trivializing computationalism---because that's essentially the same problem, again: virtually every system can, naively, be viewed as instantiating virtually every computation. There are, I think, certain avenues regarding dispositional/counterfactual/causal accounts of computation that one could pursue, in order to arrive at a notion of isomorphism between structures that's coarse-grained enough to allow for the identification of 'obviously identical' structures, without being so coarse-grained as to trivially identify virtually all structures with one another. I'm not sure if that'll work, but, with a more careful fleshing out of the notion of structure, I think there's at least a few avenues to explore here.\n\nRegarding the concrete application towards quantum mechanics, I think I understand your proposal somewhat better now; but if the structure, as such, only accounts for the correlations in measured data, then how are concrete measurement outcomes accounted for? Pre-measurement, only a certain probability distribution over outcomes exists, but post-measurement, we at least seem to have observed one definite outcome.\n\nNow, I suppose one way to account for this without appealing to some sort of coming-into-being of a more differentiated structure is to appeal to a sort of facts-as-relations account: before the measurement, relative to the '|ready>' state of the detector, the (say) qubit is in an equal superposition; after the measurement, relative to the '|detected 1>'-state of the detector, the qubit is in the state |1>, and relative to the '|detected 0>' state of the detector, it's in the state |0>. We think about this as moving from a superposition to a definite state, but this is really thinking as if we could hold the state of the detector fixed---but thinking about this as a relation between the detector and the qubit, the three propositions 'relative to |ready>, the qubit is |0> |1>', 'relative to |detected 1>, the qubit is |1>', and 'relative to |detected 0>, the qubit is |0>'---which are not actually in conflict at all, and hence, can well be part of a consistent structure.\n\nAs for my 'middle way' between the naive box-of-things view of the world, and the---to my way of thinking---somewhat too rarefied view of relata-less relations, I don't really go into that in the present essay, but the germ of the idea---which is still pretty much all I've got---is in my entry into last year's contest, where I essentially propose that there are fundamental facts only relative to a certain perspective on the world, or a certain way to split the world into distinct subsets, or sub-objects, or perhaps, subject and object. It's a bit of a tightrope walk, and I'm far from certain something like that can be made to work at all, but not really liking to drop to either side, it's kinda all I got.\n\nI hope you manage to meet all your deadlines!\n\nCheers\n\nJochen\n\nDear Jochen,\n\nthe points that you are raising are very interesting, but going into quite far-reaching details so that I feel I really want to read your essay first (and last year's again) before commenting much further.\n\nIn a very brief nutshell, I've tried to lay out my view in detail in arXiv:1712.01826. It is in some sense much more radical. In a nutshell, I would say that the following two situations are absolutely ontological identical:\n\n(1) We are parts of a physical universe in roughly the way that we intuitively believe.\n\n(2) We are brains in a vet or a simulation, yielding exactly the same observations as in case (1).\n\nMy argument is that all that there is, in a way, is an observer's state, and some chance of what this state might be next (and the form of this is the unique primitive structural claim). There is not *one* world, or *many*, but *zero*. To a view of this form, many standard objections and problems don't apply. Instead, one then has to argue why it typically so looks to the observer *as if* they were part of some \"world\", with computation, \"things\" and intersubjectivity. That's what I'm claiming to do, in an abstract sense, in that paper.\n\nNow, I don't jut want to spam the world with the details of my pet view, so let me not go much further into this, and instead read your essay and comment on it to continue our discussion.\n\nMaybe a final comment for now: the \"simulation\" problem that you mention is discussed a lot in the context of algorithmic information theory. As an arbitrary example (that you may enjoy), here's a paper by Marcus Hutter: \"A Complete Theory of Everything (will be subjective)\". What's said there (and elsewhere) is that it's not enough to have a theory that contains what you see (otherwise: dovetail all computable universes, done!), but you have to say where you are in it (observer localization).\n\nBest,\n\nMarkus"
