        "text": "Dominika Burešová in her bachelor thesis under the supervision of Prof. Pavel Pták from the Department of Mathematics of the Faculty of Mathematics of the Czech Technical University summarized the results of her multi-year research on algebraic and state properties of quantum logics. During her undergraduate studies in the Open Informatics (OI) programme, she continuously published partial results of her research; she has published one paper independently and co-authored three of them.\n\nThe opponent of the thesis, Austrian physicist Karl Svozil, who is, among others, a collaborator of Nobel Prize winner Anton Zeilinger, evaluated the work of Dominika Buresova as a significant contribution to the theory of quantum logics, which far exceeds the requirements normally set for bachelor theses. Prof. Petr Páta awarded Burešová the Dean's Prize of the Faculty of Physics for her thesis.\n\nShe found her love for mathematics at the Faculty of Economics\n\nDominika Burešová admits that she discovered her love for mathematics only at the Faculty of Mathematics. In the second semester of my bachelor's studies at OI, I enrolled in a course in mathematics minor taught by Prof. Pták. From then on, I didn't want to do anything but mathematics,\" says Burešová. Very soon after, she joined Prof. Mirek Navara's research group at the Department of Cybernetics and deepened her mathematical education by taking a number of courses designed for PhD students. She is now continuing her studies in the Master's programme in Electrical Engineering, Energy and Management (EEM).\n\nDominika Burešová has a variety of interests. In addition to lecturing at Czech and international conferences (for example, IQSA 2022), she used to swim competitively and play the soprano flute. Her positive relationship with music has remained to this day, and she prefers listening to classical music, especially Sergei Rachmaninov and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In addition, she enjoys reading classical literature and poetry.\n\nThe Global Undergraduate Awards have been held in Dublin since 2008. There are 25 categories in the sciences and humanities. The judges select from fully anonymised undergraduate entries from all over the world, without knowing the country of origin of the work.\n\nDominika Burešová is the third person from the Czech Republic to succeed in this prestigious competition. In 2015, Hana Sedláčková, a student from Masaryk University, won the competition in the life sciences category. In the same category in 2017, another Masaryk University student, Tereza Gerguri, succeeded."
