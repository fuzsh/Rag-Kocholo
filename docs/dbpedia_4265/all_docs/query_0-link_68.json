        "meta_description": "This week I am reading from Karl Svozil's book 'UFOs: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena: Observations, Explanations and Speculations'.\n\nUnidentified phenomena in space, in the Earth's atmosphere, and in waters are too important to leave their exploration to the military and scientific laypersons. Their proper scientific study is important for a variety of reasons; in particular, scientists and the public at large need to know the basic facts, to be informed about the way evidence is recorded, and to understand the difference been reliable evidence and fiction, as well as between plausible explanations and fantasy.\nWith this objective, the book surveys the history of UFO observations, the variety of recorded phenomena, and recounts the efforts of investigative commissions and their published findings.\nAlthough wild rumors are demystified in the process, this is not an exercise in rumor-bashing. An open and at the same time critical mindset is the key. Many narratives and hypothesis appear implausible relative to our present state of knowledge; but this alone should not lead to their outright exclusion. Thus the author also pays attention to UFO sightings that have so far eluded explanation in terms of known physics or meteorology. Here the reader will encounter some of the more speculative but scientifically tenable proposals, for example, relating to sudden zigzag motion without apparent inertia or recognizable propulsion, yet always with a clear guide to their plausibility. Last but not least, the book outlines plans and suggestions for future research capable of revealing the existence and intentions of extraterrestrial intelligences, outer-space engineers, or technologies so far known only from science fiction.\n\nBio\nKarl Svozil (born 18 December 1956 in Vienna, Austria) is an Austrian physicist educated at the University of Vienna and Heidelberg University. Visiting scholar at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of the University of California at Berkeley, US (1982â€“1983), the Lebedev Institute of the Moscow State University, and the Ioffe Institute, St. Petersburg (1986). Docent in Theoretical Physics at the Vienna Technical University. Ao. Univ. Professor at the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the Vienna Technical University. External Researcher at the Centre for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science[1] of the University of Auckland.\nResearch in quantum theory, applications of computability theory, algorithmic information theory, constructive mathematics (in Errett Bishop's sense) in theoretical physics, equilibrium dynamics.\n\nAmazon link https://tinyurl.com/3ux346a4\n\nhttps://www.pastliveshypnosis.co.uk/\nhttps://www.patreon.com/alienufopodcast",
