The conference dinner (Thursday, at Teleborg Castle, also on university campus)\n\nTo/from the university: Bus No 3 (marked \"Universitetet\") from downtown towards the university; one can also use buses No 1 and No 5 (marked Teleborg). Get off bus at stop Teleborg-centrum and then walk 300 m to the university. You can buy your ticket on the bus by using your card or you can download an app (\"Länstrafiken Kronoberg\") and buy tickets with its aid. At the train station you can buy a bus-card and put money on it. There is also a nice walk from downtown to the university along the Växjö-lake. Depending on your physical condition it takes 30-50 min; you can join a group of people who have already been in Växjö.\n\nTuesday, 11 June\n\n08.20-09.00 Registration (outside the main conference room Myrdal, Building K, Campus Växjö)\n\nMyrdal\n\n09.00-09.10 Opening Ceremony: Andrei Khrennikov\n\nMyrdal Chair: Rüdiger Schack\n\n09.10 Christopher A.

In this session, we shall investigate how other tools from the quantum formalism can be used to great avail in finance. This session will attempt to look at what Hamiltonian frameworks can aid in formalizing information in the asset pricing process. We will consider how an appeal to open systems can lead to promising new results in finance. Other topics such as the future of quantum measurements in finance will also be considered.\n\nSpeakers: Trung Duong, Christoph Gallus, Emmanuel Haven, Will Hicks, Lane Palmer Hughston, Polina Khrennikova, Sudip Patra\n\nQuantum Intersubjective Agreement\n\nOrganizer: Scott Glancy\n\nDoes quantum theory ensure that measurements made by different people must agree with one another, or does it ensure that situations may arise in which people must disagree? This question of \"intersubjective agreement\" has been lurking in quantum theory for decades, and recent \"extended Wigner's friend\" thought experiments have added precision and clarity to the issue. This special session will explore what different interpretations of quantum theory say about intersubjective agreement and its implications.\n\nSpeakers: Masanao Ozawa, Rüdiger Schack, Amanda Gefter, Hervé Zwirn, Jacques Pienaar\n\nQuantum and quantum-like models in biology and medicine\n\nOrganizer: Andrei Khrennikov\n\nThis session is devoted to quantum and quantum-like modelling of biological processes. Quantum information revolution has a big impact not only in physics (by treating quantum systems as carriers of information), but also outside of it, e.g., in cognition, biology and recently in medical diagnostics. Such models are known as quantum-like and they explore the methods and methodology of quantum theory for investigation of generally macroscopic biological information processors. On the other hand, today’s bioscience pushes the limits of conventional measurement, so quantum measurement methods may become the only recourse to achieve better resolutions, higher sensitivities, and reduce damage to fragile bio-targets. Hence, the study of genuine quantum processes in biosystems is very important. While the field is driven by practical applications, at issue are a range of fundamental phenomena that may have a significant impact on how we understand the world we live in and the role of quantum mechanics in it.\n\nSpeakers: C. D. Aiello, Carlos Baladron, Felix Benninger, Satoshi Iriyama, Lev Murokh; Gregory Scholes, Oded Shor, Irina Trofimova"
