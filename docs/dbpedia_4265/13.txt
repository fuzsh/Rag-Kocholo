1 Suppose you are God… …how would you do it?

2 Some broader context…awakening Are we at the center of the Universe? — No, but we seem to be quite conveniently located within our galaxy. Are our bodies made-up of solid stuff? — No, our bodies are „almost“ empty. Things only appear to be solid. Were we created in a different way than other species? — No, we evolved and spread just like locusts & everyone else around. Are we up to further disillusionments? Are we „fleshware,“ units inside a (what to us appears gigantic) simulation/computation?

3 Pythagoras (6th cent. B.C.) … considered numbers as the essence and principle of all things, and attributed to them a real and distinct existence; so that, in his view, they were the elements out of which the universe was constructed. http://www.google.at/search?q=pythagoras+world+as+numbers&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=de&metahttp://www.google.at/search?q=pythagoras+world+as+numbers&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=de&meta= http://www.bartleby.com/181/341.html Thomas Bulfinch (1796–1867).

4 Plato (c. 427- c. 347 B.C.) „God geometrizes“ [Plutarch (Convivialium disputationum, liber 8,2): „Plato said God geometrizes continually“] http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/may99/0202.html

5 K. F. Gauss (1777-1855) …„o theos arithmetizei“ = “God computes“ http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/may99/0202.html

7 Gödel (1906-78) & Turing (1912-54) Formalization of Mathematics by coding of axiomatic systems, which are representable as (universal) computer programs Precise definition of „Universal Computation“ (Turing machine is modeled after pencil&paper operations) wich is „robust“ „true > provable“

8 E. Wigner (1902-1995) „The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences“ Richard Courant Lecture delivered at New York University, May 11, 1959 and published in Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics 13, 1 (1960).

11 K. Zuse (1910-1995) „Rechnender Raum“ = „Calculating Space“ Konrad Zuse, Rechnender Raum, Friedrich Vieweg & Sohn, Braunschweig, 1969.

12 T. Toffoli & E. Fredkin Reversible Computation Role of the Observer in Uniform Systems Digital Mechanics „The Universe is a cellular automaton “ Digital Philosophy http://www.digitalphilosophy.org/ http://digitalphysics.org/

13 S. Wolfram (et al ;) … Is there any physics left to be done after ANKOS (=A New Kind of Science)? http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_reviews.html

14 The (humble?) rest … Not too many researchers pursuing Digital Mechanics: J. Schmidhuber, N. Margolus, K.Svozil (not very lately), Jim Crutchfield…., among others…

15 Some of my results… Automaton logic Intrinsic =/= extrinsic Space-time frame generation by intrinsic observers K. Svozil, ``Randomness and Undecidability in Physics'‚ (World Scientific, Singapore, 1993), xvi+292 p.

16 Space-time of intrinsic CA observers CA rules of a light clock (below), and CA light clock evolution (right) „universality“ and „robustness“ makes this Model independent

17 Let‘s face it: Digital Physics is utterly non mainstream & off-topic! Today‘s physics is continuum physics; even quantum theory just discretizes the number of quanta within a mode. Modes are still continuous! What is it good for? Is it Ideology (according to Popper, but who cares about Popper anyway)? What about „non-locality“ and „contextuality“? Not good for your career as a physicist!

18 Some mind-boggling speculations Automaton Logic very similar to Quantum Logic Relativity-Type transformation laws of frames constructed by radar coordinates (Alexandrov‘s theorem,…) Intrinsic-Extrinsic setup (Systems Science) Interfaces & Dualism & the Eccles Telegraph

19 … continued… „Atomism“ is very suitable for digital simulation (identical parts, recyclable,…) Physical undecidability by uncomputability (Casti‘s Red Herring http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/casti.htm) “Zoo hypothesis” (cf. F.Sagan’s “Contact” with aliens) Maybe we are simulations; e.g., for marketing purposes Maybe there is just one consistent Universe? Maybe free will is an illusion?

20 Not much empirical evidence … (indeed, is there any?) How could we ever find out? Some claims, none convincing. Ultimate physical justification is experiment. Competing with “traditional” continuum physics is hard; e.g., take this: anomalous magnetic Moment of the Muon a(theory) = 11 659 177(7) × 10^-10 a(experi) = 11 659 204(7)(5) × 10^-10 http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0211044 or this: http://link.aps.org/abstract/RMP/v60/p1067 Neutron double slit experiment

21 … but it is fun & inspiring! Daniel F. Galouye, Simulacron 3 (1964); stimulated R. W. Fassbender’s “Welt am Draht” & “Thirteenth Floor” H. Putnam, “Reason, Truth and History” (“Brain in a vat”) “Total Recall” “Matrix”, of course...
