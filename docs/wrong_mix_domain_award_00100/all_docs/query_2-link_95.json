        "text": "On Friday the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel committee will announce the winner, or winners, of arguably the world’s most prestigious award: the Nobel peace prize.\n\nThis year there have been more than 273 nominees, the second highest number on record. The nominees are a closely guarded secret but whoever wins – Pope Francis is currently the bookies’ favourite – will undoubtedly be an impressive sort, joining the ranks of Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, Barack Obama and Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize is one of the five awards inaugurated by Alfred Nobel, the man who invented dynamite, before his death in 1896. It can be awarded to multiple people or to an organisation, and some years – particularly non-peaceful years, like during the world wars – it is simply not awarded to anyone.\n\nThe award is meant to reward “the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses”. No biggie then.\n\nIt’s too late for you to be nominated this year but if you think you may be the person who has done the most for world peace recently, applications for the 2016 prize are due in February, so it is not too early to start thinking about securing your nomination.\n\nThe process\n\nGiven the large amounts of glory and prize money (this year about £627,000) bestowed on whoever wins the award, the process of nominating someone is surprisingly easy. All it requires is a letter or email submitted to the Norwegian Nobel committe by 1 February, nominating someone and explaining why they deserve the prize. You do more work to get unsubscribed from some email mailing lists.\n\nThe catch is that not everyone can nominate someone for an award. The Nobel committee keeps the riff-raff out by limiting the people who are allowed to submit nominations to members of national assemblies and governments, members of international courts, university chancellors, university professors of certain subjects, directors of peace research institutes and foreign policy institutes, previous winners of the Nobel peace prize and members of or advisers to the Norwegian Nobel committee.\n\nBut let’s assume that you have one of them on your side or in your pocket and they’re prepared to nominate you, you still need to impress the panel. Based on past winners of the prize, here’s a nifty guide to give you the best shot of winning the gong.\n\nYou can be a woman, but it helps if you’re not\n\nApparently it was a woman, Bertha von Suttner, who inspired Alfred Nobel to include peace as a category for the awards he was thinking of creating. Including Von Suttner, who won the award in 1905, only 16 individual women have won the peace prize since it began, compared to 87 men. More organisations (22) have won the prize than women.\n\nShockingly, these are the best statistics of any of the categories, with more individual women winning the peace prize than the prizes for physics, chemistry, medicine, economics or literature. However, the rate at which women are winning the peace prize has accelerated. There were only three female winners of the award between its inception in 1901 and 1975, and there have been 13 in the 40 years since, including six since 2003.\n\nBe a religious figure committed to peace and/or social justice\n\nThe best odds being offered for peace prize winners this year go to Pope Francis (9-2), followed by another Vatican man - Father Mussie Zerai (5-1), an Eritrean-born priest who advocates for north African refugees.\n\nIf either were to win they would join a large number of other men and women of the cloth who have been given the peace prize, such as Nathan Söderblom, former head of the church in Sweden (1930), Dominique Pire, a Belgian priest who headed up a relief organisation for refugees (1958), Mother Teresa (1979), Desmond Tutu (1984), the Dalai Lama (1989), and Catholic bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo who campaigned for independence for East Timor (1996).\n\nThough religious leaders represent a sizeable cluster of peace prize winners, they each had particularly difficult routes to get there. Teresa lived among the poor and leprous in Calcutta, Tutu and Belo both received death threats for speaking out on issues in their respective countries. So, becoming a prominent, probably poor, possibly life-threatened religious figure is an extreme route to winning the Nobel peace prize, but then again, this is the Nobel peace prize, show some commitment.\n\nBe an American president\n\nAfter religious leaders, this is the profession best represented by peace prize winners. Four US presidents have won the award, Theodore Roosevelt (1906) for his work mediating the end of the Russo-Japanese war; Woodrow Wilson (1919) for his work setting up the League of Nations; Jimmy Carter (2002) for his work campaigning for international peace and the improvement of lives in developing countries, and Barack Obama (2009), for… well, no one’s quite sure.\n\nThe prize has also been won by two vice-presidents: Charles G Dawes (1925) and Al Gore (2007) and by the then secretary of state, Henry Kissinger (1973), jointly with his Vietnamese counterpart Le Duc Tho. Kissinger’s award was one of the most controversial in the prize’s history, with Tho refusing to accept the award and two Nobel prize committee members resigning in protest.\n\nIf you can’t be an American president, at least be American\n\nSeventeen peace prize winners were born in the US, 11 in the UK, nine in France, five in Germany and five in Sweden. There have been winners born in non-US, non-European countries – special mentions to South Africa and Egypt with three winners apiece – but there have only been a handful of winners from South America and Asia. As with female winners, racial diversity seems to be increasing as well, the last five years have seen winners from Pakistan, India, Yemen, Liberia, and China.\n\nGet organised\n\nOne of the strangest things about the peace prize is that it can be won by organisations as well as individuals. To date, the award has been bestowed on 22 organisations including the office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), which has won twice (1954 and 1981) and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which takes the Nobel cake by having won three times (1917, 1944 and in 1963 with the League of Red Cross Societies), as well as staking a claim to the first ever peace prize award which went to Red Cross founder Henry Durant, alongside Frédéric Passy, in 1901.\n\nYour sunset years are also your peace prize years\n\nThe average age of peace prize winners is 61, and the great bulk of winners get the award in their 50s, 60s or 70s, so these are prime Nobel-prize-winning years. That being said last year Malala Yousafzai became the prize’s youngest ever winner at 17, in partnership with Kailash Satyarthi, for her work campaigning for girls’ education. The oldest winner is Joseph Rotblat, a Polish-British physicist, who was joint recipient in 1995, at the age of 87, for his work in the area of nuclear disarmament.\n\nIf you don’t win, don’t worry, neither did Gandhi\n\nThere have been some notable omissions on the winners’ list over the years, but none so significant as that of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. The Mahatma was nominated in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1947 and 1948, a few days before his death, but he never won."
