        "text": "On 10th of December 1901 the first Nobel Peace Prize was awarded. It went to Henry Dunant, founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who shared the first Nobel Peace Prize with Frédéric Passy, a leading international pacifist of the time.\n\nSince then, the Red Cross has been awarded the Peace Prize three times.\n\nThe Red Cross: Three-time recipient of the Peace Prize\n\nFour of them given out in Stockholm and one, the Peace Prize, in Christiania, as Oslo was then called. You can read more about that here: From the first Nobel Prize award ceremony, 1901\n\nThe announcement that the founder of the Red Cross had been chosen as Peace Prize laureate met with mixed reactions. Dunant had been awarded the prize for ameliorating the suffering of wounded soldiers, not for organising peace congresses or reducing standing forces, as stipulated in Alfred Nobel’s will. The Nobel Committee had chosen a broad interpretation of the provision that a laureate should “further fraternity between nations”. The Red Cross: three-time recipient of the Peace Prize\n\nHenry Dunant (1828–1910). Switzerland, “for his humanitarian efforts to help wounded soldiers and create international understanding”\n\nFrédéric Passy (1822–1912). France, “for his lifelong work for international peace conferences, diplomacy and arbitration.”"
