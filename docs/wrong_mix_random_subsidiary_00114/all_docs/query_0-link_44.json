        "text": "Release. Evaluate. Revise. Repeat.\n\nOne of those models that has stood the test of time is the Accountable Care Organization (ACO), groups of doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers, who collaborate to delivery high quality, coordinated care to the Medicare patients they serve. Coordinated care helps ensure that patients, especially the chronically ill, get the right care at the right time, in the right care location. When an ACO succeeds in both delivering high-quality care and spending health care dollars more wisely, it will share in the savings it achieves for the Medicare program.\n\nArizona Care Network started as an ACO.\n\nThis Medicare “proof of concept” and the savings generated under these value base arrangements caught the attention of commercial payers, who developed their own versions. According to Healthcare Finance News, “For the first time, commercial lines rather than government lines of business are leading adoption, advancement, and innovation of value-based care models and strategies.”\n\nArchitects of a new, more effective healthcare system.\n\nWith many new commercial value-based arrangements available, ACN forged agreements with a variety of payers to give a broader population of patients the opportunity to benefit from value-based medicine. When this takes place outside of Medicare, the model is referred to as Clinical Integration.\n\nSo Arizona Care Network is also a Clinically Integrated Network (CIN).\n\nClinical Integration programs have proven to improve quality outcomes and slow the rising rate of healthcare costs. As a CIN, we provide data, tools, services and resources to our participating providers so we can improve the health of our community, manage the rising cost of care, improve the patient experience and drive provider satisfaction.\n\nAs an accountable care organization (ACO), ACN takes a collaborative, evidence-based approach that allows physicians to focus on what they do best – improving the health of their patients.\n\nACN is a physician-governed organization and is uniquely structured to allow providers to maintain their independence while giving them the opportunity to leverage shared resources, technology and support that will prepare them for the future of healthcare delivery."
