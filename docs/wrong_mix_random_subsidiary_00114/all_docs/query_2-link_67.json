        "text": "Music writer, theorist and film maker Kodwo Eshun's More Brilliant Than The Sun: Adventures In Sonic Fiction is set to be republished some 20 years since first appeared in 1998. Covering the music of artists such as Sun Ra, Alice Coltrane, Lee Perry, Dr Octagon, Parliament and Underground Resistance, the book was revolutionary for the way Kodwo decoded the messages in jazz, dub, techno, funk, hiphop, jungle and much more in order to create new sonic possibilities and fictions. As Peter Shapiro said in The Wire 171, “This is the work of a writer who is desperately trying to break past language barriers to grasp at the ineffable qualities of music. It may not live up to the title, but it comes very close.”\n\nThis new edition will include a new introduction by Eshun as well as texts by film maker John Akomfrah and producer Steve Goodman aka kode9. It will be published by Verso in October 2018, priced £12.99"
