Peterson) - A stunning study of the horizon line, where each succeeding frame differs from the previous, creating rapidly alternating geometric patterns via our persistence of vision. The only copy of this in-camera-edited masterpiece (that I’m currently aware of) is located at the NYPL’s Performing Arts branch and is faded as hell; if anyone has any leads to Peterson, her other work, or both, please give me a ring.\n\nGroups I-VIII (1969-80; Barry Gerson) - I was lucky enough to spend a day with Barry Gerson—experimental cinema’s best kept secret—at his studio in Preston Hollow, where we watched a handful of his minimalist 16mm vignettes. For those interested, all of these will be screened at Anthology early next year!\n\nKen Jacobs: Up The Illusion (2023) - May Ken continue to teach us new ways of seeing for another 90 years!\n\nHe Weeps for You (1977; Bill Viola) - Cry me a river, drowning in my own tears, etc.\n\nBatman Dracula (1964; Andy Warhol) - Chris Nolan could learn a thing or two from this one…\n\nBabylon Series #3 (1990; Stan Brakhage) - I saw a handful of great Stan Brakhage films this year—such as Interpolations I-V, Spring Cycle, Airs, Tortured Dust, and Faust’s Other: An Idyll, to name a few—but this one, easily the most “minor” of the bunch, is Stan at his most breathtakingly ephemeral. Perfectly replicates those fleeting early morning moments of slowly waking up on a blindingly snowy day.\n\nEcosystem 7 ~ A Sedimentary Heat (1990; Teruo Koike) - The late Teruo Koike and his ecological films are unknown entities to most stateside experimental cinema enthusiasts, something that will hopefully be rectified in the coming years. This one could easily be mistaken for a hand-painted Brakhage film.\n\nRoom Film 1973 (1973; Peter Gidal) - Sorta like Skinamarink, except not terrible.\n\nHours for Jerome (1982; Nathaniel Dorsky) - I watched this on a (stunning, breathtaking, gorgeous, etc.) 16mm print at the Harvard Film Archives. After the screening, they proceeded to officially award me an honorary PhD in “based grail hunting.”\n\nRomeo and the Black Brothers (1995; Kōzō Kusuba, Shinpei Miyashita, Yasuo Iwamoto, Tomomitsu Matsukawa, & Kenichi Nishida) - My first go-around with World Masterpiece Theater and, suffice to say, I was deeply impressed with its simple, yet economic production values, consistently magnificent artistry, and masterful storytelling instincts. For those who are on the fence about anime in general, I’d gladly recommend this wonderfully anti-weeb enterprise any day.\n\nAnd here’s ten other noteworthy titles:\n\nNike Air Max 180 Commercial (1991; Jean-Luc Godard) - In a year where we got a trailer for a movie that will never exist, it’s only fitting to mention Godard's Nike ad that almost never saw the light of day.\n\nEarly Summer (1951; Yasujirō Ozu) - GOAT-zu strikes again!\n\nThe Dagger of Kamui (1985; Rintaro) - Turns a series of pulpy historical novels into a mythic soap-opera epic. Includes some of the most visually stunning animated sequences to come out of 1980s Japan and features a cameo from cowboy Mark Twain.\n\nMonkey Business (1952; Howard Hawks) - “What a knee-slapper!”\n\nFall (1971; Tom DeWitt Ditto) - Tom Ditto, a future NASA researcher, once worked on experimental films like Scott Bartlett’s OnOff. This one, which gave me slight vertigo, is somehow even more technically impressive.\n\nParticle Dreams (1988; Karl Sims) - Love these early computer animation doodles that exist at the intersection of art and science.\n\nElectramorphic (1987; Bradley Eros, Aline Mare) - Bradley, you crazy for this one!\n\nThe Flesh (1991; Marco Ferreri) - Ferrari remains the true Italian Stallion.\n\nSpiders in Love: An Arachnogasmic Musical (1999; Martha Colburn) - Creepy-crawlies of the world, unite!\n\nBrickwall (1975; Paul Winkler) - Takes a while for this one to really get going, but once it does, it hits like… well, you get the idea.\n\nJon Auman\n\nWriter\n\nFirst Viewings\n\nThe Woman on the Beach (Jean Renior)\n\nSpacked Out (Lawrence Ah Mon)\n\nEasy Living (Mitchell Leisen)\n\nFour Daughters (Michael Curtiz)\n\nList (Hong Sangsoo)\n\nCreepy (Kiyoshi Kurosawa)\n\nNo Highway in the Sky (Henry Koster)\n\nDaughter of the Nile (Hou Hsiao-Hsien)\n\nSailor Suit and the Machine Gun (Shinji Sōmai)\n\nThe Quest (Nippon TV)\n\nAdam-12\n\nThat Night's Wife (Yasujiro Ozu)\n\nLila Avilés\n\nFilmmaker, Tótem\n\nDe Humani Corporis Fabrica (Véréna Paravel & Lucien Castaing-Taylor)\n\nGoodbye Dragon Inn (Tsai Ming-Liang)\n\nBlack Girl (Ousmane Sembene)\n\nThe Process (Orson Wells)\n\nThe Naked Island (Kaneto Shindō)\n\nGodland (Hlynur Pálmason)\n\nAll The Beauty And The Bloodshed (Laura Poitras)\n\nVera (Tizza Covi & Rainer Frimmel)\n\nTrenque Lauquen (Laura Citarella)\n\nSean Baker\n\nFilmmaker, Red Rocket\n\nDelitto d'amore aka Somewhere Beyond Love (Luigi Comencini, 1974)\n\nExtra Terrestrial Visitors (Juan Piquer Simón, 1983)\n\nDelirio caldo aka Delirium (Renato Polselli, 1972)\n\nThe Magnificent Cuckold (Antonio Pietrangeli, 1964)\n\nSailor Suit and Machine Gun (Shinji Somai, 1981)\n\nThe Sex of Angels (Ugo Liberatore, 1968)\n\nLove Affair, or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator (Dušan Makavejev, 1967)\n\nMalèna (Giuseppe Tornatore, 2000)\n\nIl demonio aka The Demon (Brunello Rondi, 1963)\n\nTyphoon Club (Shinji Somai, 1985)\n\nOn the Silver Globe (Andrzej Żuławski, 1988)\n\nErika Balsom\n\nCritic/Academic\n\nNew Releases\n\nTrenque Lauquen (Laura Citarella)\n\nMutzenbacher (Ruth Beckermann)\n\nSaint Omer (Alice Diop)\n\nOrlando (Paul B.

2022)\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon (Martin Scorsese, 2023) – Leonardo DiCaprio’s Ernest Burkhart exemplifies the white American character more exactly than any other figure, real or imagined: irredeemably stupid, casually evil, gracelessly horny, impressionable, craven, greedy, grandiose.\n\nDon’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot (Gus Van Sant, 2018)\n\nMinute Bodies: The Intimate World of F. Percy Smith (Stuart Staples, 2016) – Pure heaven\n\nThe Five Devils (Léa Mysius, 2022) – Best song outro ever?\n\nI Hate Myself and I Want to Die (Greg Eggebeen and Benjamin Shapiro, 2012-2023)\n\nThe Mother and the Whore (Jean Eustache, 1973) – When spiritual desolation hits like fentanyl\n\nDior and I (Frédéric Tcheng, 2014)\n\nHello Dankness (Soda Jerk, 2022) – Starting a petition to demand a change back to Soda_Jerk\n\nTalking to Strangers (Rob Tregenza, 1988)\n\nThe Dark, Sad Life of Boogie2988 (Mike Clum, 2023) – An engrossing portrait of monodimensional internet stardom until Clum acknowledges he’s overwhelmed by the bleakness of his subject and starts clumsily reaching for uplift.\n\nDan Welch & David Cardoza\n\nCARTOONISTS/EDITORS, CASHIERS DU CINÉMA\n\nFirst Viewings and Discoveries:\n\nPanic in Needle Park at Film Forum:\n\nRecently a fellow cartoonist told me that the ideal readership for an anthology he publishes would look something like the Needle Park junkies in the scene where they’re shooting up and drooling over copies of Zap Comix. I think this is a strong indicator that the NY comics scene is the sharpest it’s been in years.\n\nLost Weekend at Film Forum:\n\nOne of the most honest movies I’d seen in a long time… I hit up the 4-D experience (smuggled in a bag of 24oz. Bud Heavies).\n\nFaster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! at Walter Reade:\n\nThe lady with the black hair is like if Lucy from Peanuts grew up.\n\nGloria at Film Forum:\n\nThe crowd at this screening really put me on edge: a gaggle of cynical chuckleheads who’d mistake deeply sad lines of dialogue for insult comedy (and thought a shot of a car flipping over was also really funny …???). My pal Luke put it best as he swept up their trash: “Some people assume any movie made before 1995 is a fucking satire.”\n\nTale of Princess Kaguya + Scary Movie at IFC:\n\nThe most emotionally jarring double feature I have ever subjected myself to. Outside afterwards the married couple I’d watched Scary Movie with got into an argument about whether the part where Ana Faris gets repeatedly kicked in the stomach for no reason was offensive and I just stood there.\n\nSorcerer at the new Paris “Atmos” (I still don’t know what this means???) Theater:\n\nI have never seen a film punish its audience so ruthlessly for simply being interested in its protagonists… sort of like the Metal Machine Music of action movies.\n\n“This is what driving as a woman feels like.” - my date when I caught it again at the Roxy\n\nShaolin Soccer in Walter’s grandparents’ TV room:\n\nMy friend’s golden retriever sat down and watched this whole movie start to finish without blinking.\n\nSmall Town Ecstasy on Youtube:\n\nThe head projectionist at this theater I used to work at in Boston would come into work every day wearing one of his much-cherished, Robert Crumb-esque “1930’s newspaperman” suits (fedora included)... which mostly struck me as being funny and kind of embarrassing, until later on I found out that he used to dress like a normal, basketball shorts-wearing schlub before his wife divorced him and took the kids away. That revelation engendered a deep-seated paranoia in me – that halfway through our lives God just starts button-mashing the controller, and sometimes (as in this poor soul’s case and the case of the Small Town Ecstasy guy) it results in a totally mortifying personality reset.\n\nWonderful World at home on my laptop, half-drunk, stapling zines together:\n\nIf there’s one movie whose excision from the timeline would leave a zero-percent impact on cinema history, it has to be this 2009 Matthew Broderick vehicle. For most of my adult life I’ve felt drawn to this mysterious power a work of art gains when not a single sane person would ever claim it as their favorite; like the Dave Berman line goes, “I’m perfect in an empty room.”\n\nO.C. and Stiggs at the Roxy\n\nYet again affirmed a belief I have that Altman was the only director who would’ve ever been capable of adapting Pynchon. Nobody’d better be making a Vineland movie.\n\n– D.W\n\nOver The Brooklyn Bridge at home, wide awake:\n\nI once had an “aspiring filmmaker” coworker who’d pitch his movie idea to any high roller who came walking through the door…Annoying as shit. Wasn’t until I watched Elliot Gould do the same sort of dance as a bottom-rung restaurateur that I realized there’s an art to this persistence, passion, and perspiration: it’s the American Dream.\n\nBeing Different at home, half asleep:\n\nSideshow freaks hangin out still chasing tail in their sunset years. Will the Ripley’s Believe it or Not of the future showcase the human oddities of today dancing the Floss or Toosie Slide on Tik Tok with a special consideration under God???\n\nFaster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! at The Walter Reade:\n\nI was so drunk when I saw this I imagined the actresses were just giant talking breasts with mouths on them. Is that so wrong?\n\nJimmy Buffet: Tales From Margaritavision at my Girlfriends place as the sun was rising:\n\nThe morning he died I watched ol’ Jimmy Buffet go down his very own memory lane.\n\nSorcerer at the Paris Theater:\n\nAs the credits were rolling, I was cracking my friends up doing a pretty over-the-top William Friedkin impression. Some guy physically smacked me on the back of the head and told me to KNOCK IT OFF. I turned around. It was Gene Hackman. He was not pleased.\n\nOc & Stiggs at the Roxy Theater in mouthwatering crunchy 35mm:\n\nIf OC and Stiggs were around in NYC today, they’d be pouring toxic waste in the Dimes Square water supply and kicking the asses of all the gaunt downtown scenester misanthropes like they were volleyballs at a King Sunny Adé concert.\n\n– D.C\n\nBrian Darr\n\nContributor\n\n10 Best Films of 2023 (seen so far, anyway; alphabetical by English title)\n\nAsteroid City (Wes Anderson)\n\nAurora’s Sunrise (Inna Sahakyan)\n\nMatter Out of Place (Nikolaus Geyrhalter)\n\nMay December (Todd Haynes)\n\nNam June Paik: Moon is the Oldest TV (Amanda Kim)\n\nReturn to Seoul (Davy Chou)\n\nRewind & Play (Alain Gomis)\n\nSam Now (Reed Harkness)\n\nSilver Dollar Road (Raoul Peck)\n\nWill O’ the Wisp (João Pedro Rodrigues)\n\nFirst Views (also so far; order viewed)\n\nBlind (Wiseman)\n\nDeep End (Skolimowski)\n\nWhere Chimneys Are Seen (Gosho)\n\nBad Girls Go To Hell (Wishman)\n\nNear Death (Wiseman)\n\nStories We Tell (Polley)\n\nThere’s Always Tomorrow (Sirk)\n\nCentral Park (Wiseman)\n\nAspen (Wiseman)\n\nAmerican Odyssey (Huey, Meader & Williams)\n\nAttica (Firestone)\n\nOn Body and Soul (Enyedi)\n\nKing of New York (Ferrara)\n\nHigh School II (Wiseman)\n\nWho By Water (Morrison)\n\nBallet (Wiseman)\n\nThe Big Parade (Vidor)\n\nThe Young One (Buñuel)\n\nThe Wildcat (Lubitsch)\n\nForgotten Faces (Schertzinger)\n\nDustin Guy Defa\n\nFilmmaker, The Adults\n\nTo Live and Die in L.A.

I came across this film while doing research for my book Connecticut in the Movies as a few scenes were shot in Stamford. It was a reminder of how old-fashioned story telling with a superb group of actors just works. And? Can we please bring back the intermission with films over 3 hours? Plus, best scene of a man unexpectedly jumping out of a window I have ever seen.\n\nBoomerang (1947) Directed by Elia Kazan and starring Dana Andrews and Arthur Kennedy. Kazan begins to weave his passion for social causes into his first “neo realist” film. Plus Arthur Kennedy is a standout.\n\nThe Secret Life of an American Wife (1968) Written and Directed by George Axelrod and starring Anne Jackson and Walter Matthau. This is a daring 60’s sex comedy told from a woman’s point of view.\n\nThe Last House on the Left (1972) Written and Directed by Wes Craven. The scenes of sexual violence and torture were too much for me—I barely got through it.\n\nThe Curse of the Living Corpse (1964) Written, Directed and Coproduced by Del Tenney . This was the year I discovered Del Tenney. Really liked this folk horror story with screen debut of Roy Scheider.\n\nGahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird (2013) Directed and Photographed by Steven-Charles Jaffe. If you are like me, just at the point of forgetting the impact of cartoonist Gahan Wilson (National Lampoon, The New Yorker) watch this doc. Terrific insights from director Guillermo del Toro have stayed with me.\n\nBang! The Bert Berns Story (2016) Directed by Brett Berns and Bob Sarles. Any doc about The Brill Building I’m in, but I was unaware of the impact of songwriter and record producer Bert Berns, who among other things launched the career of Van Morrison and oh yea, wrote Twist and Shout.\n\nThe gothic melodramas Ivy (1947) Directed by Sam Wood, So Evil My Love (1948) directed by Lewis Allen, and Obsession (1949) directed by Edward Dmytryk all came my way via The Criterion Channel. If there’s a throughline that links all three it might be, when in doubt, use poison. If I had a favorite it would be So Evil My Love. Ray Milland is just so deliciously unscrupulous turning the beatific Ann Todd—a former missionary—into his love slave and criminal accomplice.\n\nKen Burns’s Baseball (1994). Having missed this along the way I thought it would be a great way to get into baseball season. Who says there’s no crying in baseball? Incredibly moving document to our very American pastime. Ken Burns is a national treasure.\n\nThe Holdovers (2023) Directed by Alexander Payne. From the credits I knew I was in good hands. Let me be specific. From the font he chose for the credits I knew I was in good hands. I watched this the day after Norman Lear died. It was Lear who said he made comedies about, “the foolishness of the human condition.” Well, that’s The Holdovers. Just a beautiful film, filled with love and compassion and pathos, about our very human need to find connection.\n\nAyanna Dozier\n\nArtist\n\nBest Films of 2023\n\nHello Dankness, directed by Soda Jerk\n\nMay December, directed by Todd Haynes\n\nAnatomy of a Fall, directed by Justine Triet\n\nSaint Omer, directed by Alice Diop\n\nPiaffe, directed by Ann Oren\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon, directed by Martin Scorsese\n\nPassages, directed by Ira Sachs\n\nGodland, directed by Hlynur Pálmason\n\nFly in Power (2023), directed Yin Q and Yoon Grace Ra\n\nJohn Wick 4, directed by Chad Stahelski\n\nFirst Watches (+Shorts)\n\nCette Maison (2022), directed by Miryam Charles\n\nSombre (1998), directed by Philippe Grandrieux\n\nSuccubus (1968), directed by Jesús Franco\n\nGothic (1986), directed by Ken Russell\n\nThe Hourglass Sanatorium (1973), directed by Wojciech Has\n\nSzamanka (1996), directed by Andrzej Zulawski\n\nThe Bat Woman (1968), directed by René Cardona\n\nThe Doll (1919), directed by Ernst Lubitsch\n\nThe Fire Within: A Requiem for Katia and Maurice Kraff (2022), directed by Werner Herzog\n\nMano Destra (1986), directed by Cleo Übelmann\n\nShorts\n\nFighting Looks Different to Me Now (2022), directed by Fox Maxy\n\nQuiet As It’s Kept (2023), directed by Ja’Tovia Gary\n\nTraces of Yarrow (2023), directed by Shahkeem Williams\n\nLet’s Talk (2023), directed by Simon Liu\n\nYaangna Plays Itself (2022), directed by Adam Piron\n\nBloom (2023), directed by Helena Girón and Samuel M.

The second had a reel change in which the lights barely came up. Changing seats in the theater in the half-light felt like hurtling through space.\n\nKashima Paradise (Yann Le Masson, Bénie Deswarte, 1973)\n\nEveryday Life in a Syrian Village (Omar Amiralay, 1974)\n\nExtreme Private Eros: Love Song 1974 (Kazuo Hara, 1974)\n\nThe Marshes (Kassem Hawal, 1976)\n\nLe Théâtre des matières (Jean-Claude Biette, 1977)\n\nEgypt, City of the Dead (Jocelyne Saab, 1978) - Patience. The scenes of music and poetry make the bodies onscreen so close.\n\nNeige (Juliet Berto, 1981)\n\nNocturne (Phil Solomon, 1980)\n\nOur Voice of Earth, Memory and Future (Marta Rodriguez, Jorge Silva, 1982) - Powerfully combines landscape and land struggle in a way I haven't seen before. The devil is real and you pay him rent.\n\nRemains to be Seen (Phil Solomon, 1983)\n\nThe Secret Garden (Phil Solomon, 1988) - Applies to all the Phil Solomon. Saw them together and for a week I only dreamed of dark expanses of water spanned by bridges and pierced by small lights.\n\nUne Histoire de Vent (Joris Ivens, 1988)\n\nThe Bridges of Madison County (Clint Eastwood, 1995)\n\nLa Captive (Chantal Akerman, 2000)\n\nDaniel Goldhaber\n\nFilmmaker, How to Blow Up a Pipeline\n\nFirst Viewings\n\nDeep Cover (Bill Duke, 1992)\n\nCyberpunk Edgerunners (Yoshiyuki Kaneko, Hiroyuki Imaishi, Yuichi Shimodaira, Mai Owada, Akira Furukawa, Kodai Nakano & Tomoyuki Munehiro; 2022)\n\nLittle Children (Todd Field, 2006)\n\nThe Evil Within (Andrew Getty, 2017)\n\nThe Idiots (Lars von Trier, 1998)\n\nSaloum (Jean Luc Herbulot, 2021)\n\nThe Plot Against Harry (Michael Roemer, 1971)\n\nThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button (David Fincher, 2008)\n\nBelly (Hype Williams, 1998)\n\nLeo Goldsmith\n\nNew Releases\n\nMan in Black (Wang Bing\n\nLast Things (Deborah Stratman)\n\nMast-del (Maryam Tafakory)\n\nJanet Planet (Annie Baker)\n\nThe Night Visitors Carol Goodman\n\nAbattoir U.S.A.! (Aria Dean)\n\nEureka (Lisandro Alonso)\n\nThe Fist\n\nHello Dankness (Soda Jerk)\n\nFerrari (Michael Mann)\n\nFirst Viewings and Discoveries\n\nLambs Are Born in the Snow\n\nModesty and Shame\n\nL’homme blessé\n\nNuts in May\n\nThe Third Generation\n\nThe Disappearance\n\nThe Glenn Miller Story\n\nGuns\n\nNeige\n\nPitch Black/Chronicles of Riddick/Riddick\n\nCaroline Golum\n\nNew Releases\n\nNota bene: As a lifelong rep goer I prefer instead to leave festival coverage to my more serious and talented peers! However, I did manage to catch a few recent efforts, the most enjoyable of which I've listed below in chronological order.\n\nNew Strains (Dirs. Artemis Shaw, Prashanth Kamalakanthan)\n\nHello Dankness (Dir. Soda Jerk)\n\nThe Apocalyptic is the Mother of All Christian Theology (Dir. Jim Finn)\n\nHoneycomb (Dir. Avalon Fast)\n\nA Woman Escapes (Dirs. Blake Williams, Sofia Bohdanowicz, Burak Çevik)\n\nMaestro (Dir. Bradley Cooper)\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon (Dir. Martin Scorsese)\n\nMay December (Dir. Todd Haynes)\n\nPetrol (Dir. Alena Lodkina)\n\nGodzilla Minus One (Dir. Takashi Yamazaki)\n\nFirst Viewings and Discoveries (chronological)\n\nThe value and joy of filmgoing as a social act is all too often lost in the tweetstorm (or is it a \"postnado\"?) of year-end-discourse. As with last year, I appreciate using this bit of column-space to tout my favorite screenings of 2023.\n\nJanuary:\n\nAlfreda's Cinema Presents: You Wanted to See Me Broken, presented at a secret location. Fantastic program to start the year off right, featuring short films by Ladan Osman, a live performance by singer Sam Diaz, and closing out with an all-killer-no-filler vinyl set from legendary NYC DJ Donna Edwards. Melissa Lyde has done it again!\n\nFebruary:\n\nN/A, made a movie instead.\n\nMarch:\n\nThe Errand Boy, Roxy Cinema (35mm)\n\nMy first in-theater screening after six weeks of shooting, and the best possible reminder of why I've foolishly devoted my life to the seventh art. Not the hardest I've cried in a cinema this year, but definitely a close second.\n\nApril:\n\nThe Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings, Metrograph (35mm)\n\nMy colleague Matt Folden and I programmed this must-include for a baseball series at our place of employment. We managed to fenagle an intro from none other than SNY's auteur-in-house John DeMarsico, whose own directorial artistry is often the most exciting aspect of the local New York Mets broadcasts.\n\nMay:\n\nThe Apple, Nitehawk Cinema (35mm)\n\nA special birthday screening programmed and hosted by birthday boy Joe Berger of The Deuce! After the movie we kibitzed about our respective histories with this fantastic film maudit, turns out we have a mutual friend in NuArt Theater manager/programmer emeritus Marc Edward Heuck, who showed this on the regular when I was hanging around there in high school.\n\nJune:\n\nI Am My Own Woman, Spectacle Theater\n\nThis year's follow-up to Elizabeth Purchell's 2022 Rosa von Praunheim retrospective at Spectacle, once again with some special elements from NYPL. Of all the films in the series, this was my favorite - part period drama, part documentary, all queen shit. Liz crashed with me that week and left behind her copy of subject Charlotte von Mahlsdorf's memoir (which I summarily devoured).\n\nJuly:\n\nSafe in Hell, Nitehawk Cinema (35mm)\n\nScreened on a print from the Library of Congress! This is another indulgent gimme, since I introduced the screening with my wife Cristina Cacioppo. What a wild-ass ride this movie is, truly. Might be my most stoned intro to date.\n\nAugust:\n\nHere At Water's Edge / Duelle Films, Rockaway Film Festival\n\nPerfect weather for an outdoor screening that ticked every box on my list of expanded cinema must-haves. Gina Telaroli and Carolyn Funk presented a live projection before the feature presentation of Leo Hurwitz and Charles Pratt's 1962 experimental doc about NYC's waterways. You haven't seen either picture unless you've experienced them as soundtracked by the wind and waves of Rockaway Beach!\n\nSeptember:\n\nWladyslaw Starewicz, Len Lye and Oskar Fischinger, MoMA (16mm/35mm)\n\nStrong contender for my favorite screening this year and the hardest I cried in a movie theater this year. Stacked program, but the laurels go to Starewicz's The Magic Clock and The Song of the Nightingale - the former a fantastical bricolage of Brothers Grimm, William Morris, and Aesop's Fables, the latter a heartbreaking love story that doubles as a passionate plea for environmental conservation.\n\nOctober:\n\nOrdinary Madness of a Daughter of Cham / Mist Melodies of Paris, BAM\n\nThe first US retrospective of filmmaker/playwright Julius-Amédée Laou, featuring new restorations of his criminally-underseen oeuvre, and programmed by my cinema-brother Steve Macfarlane. I went in completely unaware of what to expect, and left the theater feeling as if I'd run a psychic and emotional marathon. Daughter of Cham has some of the finest screen performances I've seen this year, if not this decade.\n\nNovember:\n\nLast Movies, Nitehawk Cinema (35mm), Spectacle Theater (16mm), Light Industry\n\nI love an all-day roving film program that brings multiple venues together, and on November 4 we all hosted visiting artist/provocateur Stanley Schtinter for a program of last films seen by notable 20th century luminaries: 20,000 Years in Sing Sing/Waterloo Bridge at the 'hawk, The Kid with a live score at Spec, and Manhattan Melodrama/Oedipus Rex at Light Industry. I think November 4 should be Last Movies Day in perpetuity!\n\nDecember:\n\nArchangel, Metrograph\n\nDear Penthouse Forum, I can’t believe it happened to me… I moderated a Q&A with my favorite living director. Is this an auspicious omen for the year to come or the last good thing that will ever happen in my miserable life? TBD!\n\nEmerson Goo\n\nNew Releases:\n\nI Didn’t See You There (Reid Davenport)\n\nSmall, Slow, but Steady (Sho Miyake)\n\nStonewalling (Huang Ji & Ryuji Otsuka)\n\nDry Ground Burning (Adirley Queirós & Joana Pimenta)\n\nThe Potemkinists (Radu Jude)\n\nMay December (Todd Haynes)\n\nRemembering Every Night (Yui Kiyohara)\n\nBye Bye Tiberias (Lina Soualem)\n\nAgainst the Tide (Sarvnik Kaur)\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (Christopher McQuarrie)\n\nFirst viewings and discoveries\n\nAhupuaʻa, Fishponds and Loʻi, archival footage screening (Hoʻomau Nā Maka o ka ʻĀina)\n\nBaldwin’s N—er (Horace Ové)\n\nBlue Island (Chan Tze-Woon)\n\nCarlito’s Way (Brian De Palma)\n\nA Family Tour (Ying Liang)\n\nForever A Woman (Kinuyo Tanaka)\n\nInfinity According to Florian (Oleksiy Radynski)\n\nLe Petit Chaperon rouge (Shinji Aoyama)\n\nLove Hotel (Shinji Somai)\n\nOld Long Stay (Yuki Iiyama)\n\nRepatriation (Kim Dong-won)\n\nSaint Omer (Alice Diop)\n\nThe Shout (Jerzy Skolimowski)\n\nSnow In September (Lkhagvadulam Purev-Ochir)\n\nSorcerer (William Friedkin)\n\nTa’ang (Wang Bing)\n\nTobacco Embers (Yugantar Film Collective)\n\nUkraine-Poland: The Solidarity Border (Lech Kowalski)\n\nWhen Cinema Reflects the Times: Hou Hsiao-Hsien and Edward Yang (Hirokazu Koreeda)\n\nWoman of Tokyo (Yasujiro Ozu)\n\nJulia Gorden\n\nRoxy Cinema Attendant\n\nSudden Manhattan (Adrienne Shelley)\n\nSong to Song (Terrence Malick)\n\nI Walked with a Zombie (Jacques Tourneur)\n\nBeautiful Creatures (Richard LaGravenese)\n\nI Used to Be Darker (Matthew Porterfield)\n\nA Man Vanishes (Shōhei Imamura)\n\nRhubarb (Arthur Labin)\n\nKnock Knock (Eli Roth)\n\nOut 1: Spectre (Jacques Rivette)\n\nMay (Lucky McKee)\n\nTake This Waltz (Sarah Polley)\n\nThe Rocky/Creed franchise in its entirety\n\nMicah Gottlieb\n\nprogrammer/archivist\n\n\"First Viewings and Discoveries\" rather than any 2023 releases:\n\nCompensation (1999, Zeinabu irene Davis) - Academy Museum (DCP)\n\nThe Cure in Orange (1987) - Academy Museum 35mm\n\nThe Dupes (1972, Tewfik Saleh) - Film at Lincoln Center (DCP)\n\nFlames (1978, Adolfo Arrietta) - Mkv file\n\nForagers (2022, Jumana Manna) - Vimeo link\n\nThe Grateful Dead (1977, Leon Gast) - Shout Factory blu-ray\n\nI Know Where I'm Going!

Lots of films were best in their ways… bit of a cop-out answer, but here are some that stuck in my brain\n\nAvatar: The Water One - Start of the year, bottom of the barrel. I haven’t walked out of a movie halfway through since the first Harry Potter. I couldn’t tell if it was the ™blue vodka drink I got or the Best Buy motion capture, but I was losing my mind. When the blueboy bonded with the whale, that was my cue.\n\nDogleg - A neat little shaggy dog. Guy has problems stacked on problems, while also trying to keep his shit together for the other, unrelated stack of problems. 80 minutes, perfect runtime.\n\nSmoking Causes Coughing - Mr Oizo’s work is the perfect combination of Dude, Where’s My Car, Godard, Godot, Seinfeld and Twilight Zone. These power rangers go on a weekend retreat and spin a few yarns. It goes nowhere, also 80 minutes, so perfect. I got to meet that cute fly from Mandibles a year earlier, life highlight.\n\nSkinamarink - An ASMR version of Ghostwatch. Hazy, evocative and almost exclusively fuzzed out images of empty hallways accompanied by a soundtrack of whispered voices. My partner HATED it, but she also requested we see Avatar, so I figure this was pretty good revenge. Also, I like singing the title to the tune of “Metal Guru”.\n\nRotting In The Sun - I love films where it starts out as one story and completely goes left halfway in. A pretty simple gumshoe, with added drugs, dongs, instagram and sand.\n\nCarpet Cowboys - I truly think that Memory are creating a new genre of documentary. The children of Errol Morris, Godfrey Reggio, Agnes Varda etc. What starts as a pretty simple curio about rug makers unravels (ha) into a much bigger picture: American Dream, commodification, identity and all.\n\nAnother Body - Speaking of identity, this is another doc sitting in the pits of the uncanny valley. A double deepfake about reality pixelated, a warning about tech running ahead of us (I wrote this using ChatGPT).\n\nBabylon - I watched this on a tiny plane screen after taking a sleeping pill, which may have been the perfect viewing condition. It’s a bloated mess, of course, but it oscillates between total shit and campy heights that it all kind of worked in an obscurist logic. A bit Hollywood Babylon in the more salacious chapters, and the tragedy parts worked better than the triumph of “da movies” — either way, still better than The Artist. I know this came out end of ’22, I’ll take the cheat.\n\nThe Gods Of Times Square - An oldie brought back by the fine folks at Elara. The scuzzy NYC I dreamed of in my Sydney youth. A guy with a camera hanging round and talking to the priests of the block, slowly drawing out their (un)real personalities. Studs Terkel as told via GG Allin’s last gig footage, right?\n\nChicken Run: Dawn Of The Nugget - I haven’t seen this movie, but that title is the best thing since The Chipmunks series. Also Aardman can do no wrong!\n\nFirst Viewings and Discoveries\n\nForce Majeure\n\nBrigsby Bear\n\nVegas YouTubers - Walking around, buffets, slots and bumping into each other, this is my favourite cinematic universe\n\nPaul McCarthy - WS White Snow installation\n\nGoodbye To Language\n\nJersey Shore Family Reunion + Bar Rescue - Pluto TV or Tubi? Always the question.\n\nSlim Gaillards Civilisation - Old Arena BBC 4 hour doc about King Slim\n\nIs That All There Is? - Lindsay Anderson pops up to the shops, has a cup of tea\n\nAttenberg\n\nWattstax\n\nOld\n\nBad Day At Black Rock\n\nIn A Glass Cage\n\nThe Wedding Banquet\n\nAmerican Dream\n\nTicket Of No Return + Dorian Gray in the Mirror of the Yellow Press\n\nHulk (Eric Bana one)\n\nMerrily We Go To Hell\n\nWe Are The Best!\n\nThe Murder of Mr. Devil\n\nLaugh, Clown, Laugh\n\nJulia Gunnison\n\nWriter\n\nBest First Watches\n\nFreaks (Tod Browning, 1932)\n\nThree (Aleksandar Petrović, 1965)\n\nDownpour (Bahram Beyzai, 1972)\n\nThe Dupes (Tawfiq Saleh, 1973)\n\nMuna Moto (Jean-Pierre Dikongué-Pipa, 1975)\n\nMr. Klein (Joseph Losey, 1976)\n\nGetting to Know the Big Wide World (Kira Muratova, 1978)\n\nDawn of the Dead (George A. Romero, 1978)\n\nFamily Nest (Béla Tarr, 1979)\n\nThe Social Life of Small Urban Spaces (William"
