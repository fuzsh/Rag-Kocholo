You can do this by visiting our special exhibitions section. Using photographs, laboratory notebooks and other historical sources, these exhibitions bring to life some of this process. See for yourself some of the ups and downs the scientists have faced along the way.\n\nThe history of antimicrobial resistance and scientists' struggles to overcome the problem\n\nSeattle Genetics: A case study of drug development\n\nA Healthcare Revolution in the Making: The Story of César Milstein and Monoclonal Antibodies\n\nThe life story of a monoclonal antibody\n\nThe path to DNA sequencing: The life and work of Frederick Sanger\n\nThe places\n\nTimeline\n\nAn ever-growing list of events, currently 2,656 events, that have contributed to the growth of biotechnology. Click here to browse the timeline. For timelines for specific sciences click here: antibodies, CRISPR-Cas9, genetics, gene therapy, immunotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, virology. For timelines for specific places click here: Cambridge University, Harvard University, The Laboratory of Molecular Biology, The Pasteur Institute, Rockefeller University, The Wistar Institute. For timelines for specific people click here: Cesar Milstein, Fred Sanger, Donall Thomas, Herman Waldmann.\n\nCracking Covid: The history of COG-UK\n\nHow a community came together to break the COVID code and brought about a revolution in genomic surveillance\n\nBegun in December 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic saw the unprecedented coming together of the scientific community to find a solution to the unfolding devastation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This exhibition explores the pioneering collaborative work undertaken by the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK) to provide large-scale and rapid whole-genome virus sequencing to help track the evolution and spread of the virus. Set up and funded with remarkable speed, COG-UK led the world in terms of the volume of samples sequenced, which enabled it to rapidly track the movement of the pandemic and pick up more transmissible and worrying variants in real-time to inform public health measures.\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\nVideo exploring the COG-UK exhibition.

Music credit: Alexander Nakarada, Serpent Sound Studios.\n\nUsing a rich collection of interviews conducted with many of the consortium’s participants, as well as messages they posted on social media and original documents, the exhibition charts the major challenges they faced in collecting, sharing and interpreting genomic data as well as the very long hours and sacrifices individuals made to contribute to COG-UK both within the laboratory and outside. Together this material provides a glimpse into the complex development of science as well as the social history behind the pandemic. Leaving behind an important legacy for future pathogen genomic surveillance, the history of COG-UK will be of interest to everyone seeking lessons to tackle future pandemics.

Deep dives in the resources include: Long-COVID – The nightmare that won't end - A researcher's first hand perspective. Other resources cover: Coronavirus: the antibody drugs few people have been discussing – until now.

More infectious than HIV, the virus globally claims the lives of more than 900,000 people each year. Spread by exposure to infected blood and bodily fluids, the virus infects at least one in three people worldwide at some point in their lives. Hepatitis B is particularly worrying because its carriers initially show no symptoms but it can cause serious damage to the liver which results in deaths from cirrhosis or liver cancer many years later. The group most at risk of becoming infected and transmitting the virus are infants. The only thing that can break the cycle of hepatitis B infection is through vaccination. First introduced in the early 1980s, this vaccine has dramatically reduced the incidence of hepatitis B. The vaccine is a fascinating history on several accounts. Not only was it the first vaccine to protect against cancer, it was also the first one to be made with just a subunit of a virus which opened up a new chapter for improving the safety of vaccines overall.

Click here to see their comments and contribute your own reflections. This is part of an ongoing public engagement project to champion the contributions of women in the biomedical sciences. Click here to find out more about this project. Find out about some of the hidden women at the cutting edge of the science by visiting our profiles of some of the women who have helped shape biotechnology. Click here to see a timeline of initiatives implemented to promote gender equality in the biomedical sciences. Click here to see a timeline of some some key biomedical discoveries in which women played a pivotal role.\n\nThe untold story of monoclonal antibodies\n\nEngineering Health: How Biotechnology Changed Medicine\n\nCelebrating the first publication of monoclonal antibodies\n\nIt is now over 40 years since César Milstein and Georges Kohler published their technique for producing monoclonal antibodies. To celebrate the occasion we invite you to watch the film Un Fuegito about the life and work of Milstein, produced by Ana Fraile, Pulpofilms. The film, which you can find on vimeo.com, has been released to help raise funds for a new educational film to promote greater understanding about monoclonal antibodies and how they have transformed the lives of millions of patients across the world.\n\nThe Debate: Genome editing"
