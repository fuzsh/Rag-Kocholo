The video stars Hollywood icon Val Kilmer of Top Gun, Willow, The Doors, The Island Of Doctor Moreau and The Ten Commandments: The Musical fame.\n\nShot in Los Angeles and directed/edited by Rick Alverson (Entertainment, The Comedy) the clip features a woozy Kilmer bobbing his head as 0PN's track burbles around an LA home, owned, according to the end credits, by one Dan Finfer. The video's minimal storyline was devised by Daniel Lopatin and Alverson."
