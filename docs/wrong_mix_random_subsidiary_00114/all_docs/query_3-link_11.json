        "text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic maintains its grip on the world, physicians at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences continue to step up in a myriad of ways to help the Western New York community.\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine published a paper Nov. 3 that described how children with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma responded to a targeted therapy for the disease that has been effective in adults.\n\nYongho Bae, PhD, assistant professor of pathology and anatomical sciences, has received a $250,000 sponsored research award from the Empire Discovery Institute (EDI) to investigate the role a novel mechanotherapeutic target, discovered in his lab, may have on vascular and cardiac stiffening commonly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\nNew research on an enigmatic neurotransmitter receptor in the brain reveals it may be a promising target for future novel therapeutic treatments for a host of neurological diseases, according to Gabriela K. Popescu, PhD, professor of biochemistry.\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) patients may be better equipped to stave off the cognitive decline that the disease can cause by using a smartphone-based app now under development at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.\n\nA team of Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences researchers has published a paper that provides novel guidelines for clinicians when discussing brain atrophy with their multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.\n\nEven before she had made up her mind about which career path to choose, emergency medicine has been at the center of E. Brooke Lerner’s professional life.\n\nThe Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences researchers who have changed the way concussions are treated have been awarded $4.8 million from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate whether incorporating elements from the Buffalo Concussion Protocol to the DOD’s current concussion protocol would improve outcomes for active members of the military who sustain a concussion.\n\nGetting a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) is a career-crowning achievement for any medical researcher. This fall, within one week, it happened to two members of the Department of Pediatrics in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, both of whom also happen to be Jacobs School alumnae.\n\nParesh Dandona, MD, PhD, SUNY Distinguished Professor of medicine in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, is co-author on a study that shows low doses of pioglitazone used to treat diabetes in patients with insulin resistance may be preferable. In this study, patients had a history of previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).\n\nMark D. Hicar, MD, PhD, associate professor of pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases, has been awarded a $100,000 Microbial Pathogenesis in Alzheimer’s Disease Grant by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Foundation to explore a potential link between infectious diseases and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nA type of acupressure focused on pressure points in the ear could be a promising treatment for functional abdominal pain disorder (FAPD), a challenging group of disorders that cause chronic abdominal pain in 13.5 percent of children and adolescents.\n\nA joint study between researchers at the University at Buffalo and UCLA demonstrates for the first time that a specific type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that teaches information processing skills can modulate key components of the brain-gut-microbiome axis in some of the most severe irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients.\n\nThe University at Buffalo and UBMD Physicians’ Group have launched the region’s only long COVID registry in order to learn more about the condition and to connect Western New Yorkers with treatment options and the potential to participate in clinical trials.\n\nSteven E. Lipshultz, MD, the A. Conger Goodyear Professor and Chair of pediatrics, is co-author on a new paper that validates the long-term efficacy and safety of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) for treatment of adolescent obesity.\n\nGil I. Wolfe, MD, UB Distinguished Professor and the Irvin and Rosemary Smith Chair of the Department of Neurology, is involved in trials of FcRn (neonatal FC receptor) antagonists that offers a new approach to treating myasthenia gravis (MG).\n\nA Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences researcher has been awarded a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute grant to explore how changes in arterial stiffness elicit vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) behaviors that contribute to cardiovascular disease.\n\nA trainee in the doctoral program in biochemistry has been awarded a two-year predoctoral fellowship from the American Heart Association for her research on a fatal neurodegenerative disorder.\n\nA student in UB’s summer research fellowship program, “Training the Next Generation of Physician-Scientists,” won the 2021 American Medical Association Research Challenge, emerging from more than 1,100 submissions to claim the grand prize of $10,000 in the largest national research competition among medical students, residents and fellows in the country.\n\nDeveloping a more effective vaccine for tuberculosis is the goal of research led by Jonathan F. Lovell, PhD, SUNY Empire Innovation Associate Professor of biomedical engineering, that has been funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nResearchers at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and their collaborators have developed powerful new ways to study and potentially reverse the cellular mechanisms that cause mitochondrial diseases and premature aging.\n\nFor teens who have struggled with obesity, it probably sounded too good to be true: a weekly injection that could help them control their eating and lead to weight loss. But the results of the clinical trial on the drug semaglutide, released earlier this month in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the discipline’s major conference, Obesity Week, turned out to be better than anything the participants — or even the researchers — expected.\n\n“Your baby has a genetic disease.” It’s one of the most terrifying things that new parents can hear. Yet it frequently turns out not to be true because, while newborn screening is extremely accurate for many common conditions, screening accuracy rates for rare — even fatal — conditions can be abysmal, according to genetics specialists.\n\nMausma Bawa, MD, a trainee in the neonatal-perinatal medicine fellowship, has been selected as one of three early-stage investigators — in collaboration with the Society for Pediatric Research (SPR) Junior Section — to present at the 125th annual meeting of the Japan Pediatric Society April 15-17 in Fukushima, Japan.\n\nStephen T.
