He had a major supporting role in the action-thriller Skyscraper, a 1996 direct-to-video film starring Anna Nicole Smith, where he played her screen character's detective husband.\n\nHowever, Steinmetz was best known as Passions' Martin Fitzgerald, whom he portrayed from May 2004 to October 2006, when Steinmetz was dropped to recurring status, and the character subsequently disappeared from the canvas without explanation. In May 2012, it was announced that Steinmetz would join the cast of ABC's General Hospital as the son of a previous character with a past connection to popular character Sonny Corinthos.\n\nOn July 2, 2012, Steinmetz made his first appearance on the series in the role of Joe Scully, Jr.. On September 15, 2012, It was announced that Steinmetz's contract with General Hospital would not be renewed, Steinmetz made his last appearance on the series on October 23, 2012.\n\nA native of Chicago, his father was a cop on the South Side; Steinmetz graduated from high school in Federal Way, a suburb of Seattle, and played professional soccer for the Portland Timbers. The acting bug bit him, and he left for San Francisco, and then New York City, where he worked on stage for nearly 10 years.\n\nIn addition to acting, Steinmetz coaches high school football. His team, the Venice Gondoliers, made it to the City Championships last year, where they played in front of 40,000 people. Steinmetz is single, resides in Los Angeles, and is the foster father of three sons, Trevor and Troy and Jr."
