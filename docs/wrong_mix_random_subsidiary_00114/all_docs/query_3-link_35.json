Here at Buffalo, the SNMA chapter in collaboration with LMSA and the Office of Medical Admissions is heavily involved in the recruitment of underrepresented minority students through Interviewee Welcome on Interview days, Second Look Weekend, and ongoing communication with accepted and prospective students.\n\nWe know both in clinical practice and medical education, diversity makes us stronger and better for our patients and their families. We hope that with our constant support, SNMA and LMSA is able to have considerable contribution in making the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences mirror the diverse landscape of Buffalo, and cement its mission to the attention and promise of healthy equity in the Buffalo area.\n\nA panel conversation on advancing diversity and inclusion in STEM with prominent women scientist and a Nobel Prize laurate\n\nWednesday, March 24, 2021\n\n3:00 pm via Zoom\n\nPresented by Laura Helmuth, editor in chief for Scientific American.\n\nThe panel conversation will focus on the Picture a Scientist documentary and will be centered on advancing diversity and inclusion in STEM disciplines.
