        "text": "Children’s Game\n\nI want­ed to write about our trip to Paris:\n\nSeventy-two hours, with­out sleep — unless\n\nyou count pass­ing out in the Louvre,\n\nagainst The Borghese Vase, until a guard\n\nnudged us awake with the toe of his well-polished\n\nbrogue and again, down in the catacombs,\n\nwhere we woke with our heads pressed against\n\na wall of skulls arranged in patterns\n\nof hearts and cross­es; death as a chil­dren’s game,\n\nwhich, I sup­pose, it was, at the time this wall was made.\n\nWhen we woke, we broke through a hole\n\nin Av. du Colonel Henri Rol-Tanguy, and had sex\n\n(of a rough, unpro­tect­ed sort) beneath\n\nsome con­ve­nient bush­es. I remem­ber your hot breath\n\nagainst my neck, at the shiv­er­ing hairline,\n\nthe bud­ding bram­bles scrap­ing my ass,\n\nand the baguette and cheese we ate afterwards,\n\nsit­ting on a bench in the sun. There’s a photograph\n\nyour par­ents snapped, when we got home.\n\nI’m lean­ing against you: you’ve got me under\n\nthe arms. Both pairs of eyes are pouched\n\nand shad­owed, but main­ly we look young.\n\nWe were stu­dents togeth­er. Afterwards,\n\nI fell asleep in the bath and woke\n\nwith water flood­ing my throat, through my nostrils.\n\nBut I’m not going to write about that.\n\nInstead, how about the first time I left you?\n\nWe were sit­ting in the Aberystwyth Wetherspoons,\n\non a brown leather sofa by the win­dow, overlooking\n\nthe train tracks and the small cart of used books\n\njust beyond the open bar. You laid your heavy head\n\nbetween my shoul­der and my neck, in the crook\n\nbeneath my ear and I kept on emptying\n\nketchup pack­ets onto the thick, white plate.\n\nBefore your train pulled out, I took you upstairs\n\nand jerked you off, one last time,\n\nin the biggest stall in the Ladies’. I think I knew\n\nthat we weren’t over yet, but I need­ed to breathe,\n\nI need­ed to breathe. And you use up\n\na lot of oxy­gen. You draw it right out of my lungs\n\nand I’m afraid (so afraid) that this time\n\nthe water won’t be enough to wake me up.\n\n~\n\nIn The Tall Grass\n\nLovebirds can move both sides of their beaks\n\ninde­pen­dent­ly, manip­u­lat­ing the top and the bottom\n\nhalves at once. They can push them away\n\nfrom their fat, cheer­ful faces like a grandparent\n\nenter­tain­ing an infant by push­ing their false teeth\n\nhalfway out of their mouth with their tongue.\n\nWhen a love­bird is hap­py, their red beak parts,\n\nslight­ly, so that their hard, bone sick­le curves\n\ninto a mim­ic of a grin. When they yawn, the top half\n\narcs up as the low­er drops and their white-lined eyes\n\nslit shut with plea­sure. They’ll wag­gle their thumb-like,\n\nmucos­al pro­boscis about as though the air were something\n\ndeli­cious — to be peeled, crushed, and final­ly drawn\n\ndown into their hap­pi­ly churn­ing coils of guts.\n\nI watch them care­ful­ly — my birds — gaug­ing their moods,\n\ntheir health, the slight­est bright, cut­tle­fish flicker\n\nof emo­tion, with exact­ly the same eye for detail\n\nthat I used to save for you, but (I have to say) I do so\n\nwith­out the fear. There is no chance that the puffed plumage\n\nof a bird, with ‘love’ right there in the name, could hide\n\na deep and stone-lined chasm. I watch my birds\n\nwith plea­sure. They are not wait­ing for me to slip.\n\nThey feel no rel­ish at the prospect of my fall.\n\n~\n\nActs of Bondage\n\nMy doves bring each oth­er presents, lit­tle gifts\n\nto solid­i­fy their social bond. Hou Yi plucks a straw\n\nfrom the nest box I bought espe­cial­ly for them\n\nand presents it to Chang’e as she sits, the plumes\n\nat her breasts puffed out against the rim\n\nof their food bowl, and she takes it in her narrow\n\nbeak and turns it, this way and that, considering\n\nits mer­it, and his with it, before adding the hon­ey colored\n\nstrand to her grow­ing col­lec­tion. Then Hou Yi scrunches\n\nhis warm body into the nar­row space beside her,\n\nbefore lean­ing over to gen­tly groom the feathers\n\nat her crown. My yel­low love birds express their tenderness\n\nby caress­ing each oth­er’s crim­son beaks. They lean in close,\n\nand nuz­zle each oth­er at the neck, pass­ing choice\n\nmorsels of fruit (apple, or pear) from mouth to mouth,\n\nbur­bling (between sweet bites) the twin halves of a song\n\nthey’ll spend their whole lives writ­ing. My small, damaged\n\ndog brings me mauled stuffed ani­mals, or else the perfect\n\nstick she nosed out from under a bush, and our son\n\nbrings me paint­ings he makes in class; the clay sculptures\n\nhe formed from flour and water. I brought you things, too:\n\nnew socks, clean under­wear, the foods you loved\n\nand nev­er bought for your­self. I brought you book\n\nafter book, with your name on the ded­i­ca­tion page,\n\npil­ing them up at your feet, and you’d have seen it there,\n\nif you’d ever opened them. I brushed and gen­tly braided\n\nyour long, thick hair. I wove your tress­es into a crown.\n\nI brought you a warm hand and a thin gold ring,\n\nand I can still hear the small, sad noise it made\n\nwhen you tore it off, after anoth­er of our innu­mer­able fights,\n\nand sent it fly­ing out the door to clat­ter in the street\n\n~"
