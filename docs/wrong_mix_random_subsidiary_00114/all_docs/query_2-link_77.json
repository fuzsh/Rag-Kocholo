        "text": "2021\n\nE=MC3In this surrealist dreamscape based on actual events, \"E=MC³\" is Victor Stabin's animated tale of Albert Einstein's invention and patenting of the perpetual motion refrigerator that brings peace to the Middle East. The animation combines fantastic imagery with tongue-in-cheek storytelling and plenty of schtick. This story had its genesis in the strange but true account of Einstein's work on a highly efficient refrigerator designed while in Berlin circa 1920s. This remarkable story combines Stabin's long-running love affair with public radio with a narrative that unfolds through an NPR-style radio interview - an interview conducted by a talking clam voiced by Dave Davies of NPR's \"Fresh Air.\"12Victor Stabin USAEnglishFestival 2021#uploading_holocaustThousands of young Israelis join \"the journey to Poland\" each year to learn about the Holocaust.

The film is a potent and moving journey through the universal experience of loss, mourning and rebuilding a life.31Jen KaplanUSAEnglishAJFF365 2021A Kaddish for Bernie MadoffA mystical meta-musical about the greatest financial fraud in history. A hybrid of memoir docudrama and narrative fantasy, A KADDISH FOR BERNIE MADOFF tells the story of Madoff and the system that allowed him to function for decades – through the eyes of artist Alicia Jo Rabins, who fuels her growing obsession with interviews turned musical numbers, ancient spiritual texts, fevered fantasies of synchronized swimmers and the unique perspective of watching the global financial crash of 2008 unfold from her 9th floor studio in an abandoned office building on Wall Street. Fueled by her growing obsession, real-life interviews transform into music videos, ancient spiritual texts become fevered fantasies of synchronized swimming, and a vivid, vulnerable work of art is born from the unique perspective of an artist watching the global financial collapse up close.75Alicia J. RoseUSAEnglishAJFF365 2021A Starry Sky Above the Roman GhettoIn her Roman attic, a girl finds an old picture of the Jewish child Sarah Cohen whose family has been killed by the Nazis in World War II.

Another chapter of his biography seems to have disappeared – the kidnapping of his daughter, Angelica, by her mother who had fallen in love with one of his students. This was an event that became crucial to the Israeli art world, but also to Angelica’s life.

The new Soviet Union of the 1920s championed equality for women and great innovation in the creative arts. Until it didn't. Looking back at that time, history remembers the men who were celebrated and then shut down. But women were there, too, and they were influential, powerful and brilliant. \"I Want to Make a Film About Women\" gazes in to a creative communal kitchen and watches these women transform it into a workshop, then a stage set, then a film, all the while juggling noisy men and the wolves of history. It imagines what the revolutionary women artists of the 1920s said, what they did, and what they might have created had it not been for Stalin's suppression.12Karen PearlmanAustraliaEnglish, RussianFestival 2021Image of VictoryDuring the 2014 war in Gaza, Uri, an Israeli soldier, is shot and wounded.

His artistic vision of over seventy prolific years peers through a unique lens of Judaism, claiming that over decades of study, he has become “one with the Torah.” As an articulate academician, Maurice Schmidt candidly describes how his spiritual interpretations become a congruent mastery of beautiful craftsmanship and pure visceral expression that plays out seamlessly through his powerfully dynamic portrayals of daily life, agricultural landscapes, and religious subjects.28Vanessa ReiserUSAEnglishFestival 2021Marry Me HoweverThis film tells the stories of LGBT men and women who, for religious reasons, decided to marry against their own sexual orientation in order to comply with Torah laws and to be accepted into their families and religious communities. Some shared their secret with their partners, some kept it hidden, and some lied even to themselves. After their divorces, they confront the conflicts they repressed: their faith and religious laws; children, family and community; exposure to society and search for a partner. The characters experience a journey of self-acceptance and social activism as they try to affect a change in their religious environments. The film also follows the women who married and divorced homosexual partners, as well as rabbis and psychologists who seek a solution to an unsolvable conflict.63Mordechai VardiIsraelHebrewFestival 2021Mazel TovAt a banquet hall in Israel, at the height of a war, Adam Weizmann’s Bar Mitzvah party turns into a glorious catastrophe.

In reality, he was sheltering hundreds of Jewish families. By the end, many were saved in hiding places dug into the ground and carved into the walls. Many more were executed by the SS and buried in a mass grave. Today, the former \"HKP\" is unchanged. A group of scientists arrive to locate the hiding places of those who were saved and identify the mass grave of those who were murdered. A child survivor of the camp and an American physician, whose mother was saved by Major Plagge, join them.

Golda Meir was Israel’s first and only female prime minister. Much of the film’s focus is on the period surrounding the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when Israel was attacked by Egypt and Syria. Gibson’s drama suggests that Meir threatened Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger with the launch of nuclear weapons against her enemies, conceivably starting World War III, unless the U.S. came to her country’s aid.86Scott SchwartzUnited StatesEnglishFestival 2019Hidden FaceThe Admor of Sanz-Klausenburg was a rabbi who experienced personal devastation yet, despite this, succeeded in rehabilitating his own life and that of his Chassidic community.

The film presents the complex relationship between ultra-Orthodox Jews and the memory of the Holocaust.

After a humble start as a St. Louis reporter, he rose through the ranks of journalism and politics, eventually purchasing the trendsetting paper “The World.” Over a four-decade publishing career, Pulitzer championed democratic ideals and the common man, fighting suppression of news, advocating for the poor, and exposing corruption, even as he overcame illness and attempts to discredit him.86Oren RudavskyUSAEnglishFestival 2019Picture of His LifeWorld renowned wildlife photographer Amos Nachoum has one final photographic dream remaining - to photograph a Polar Bear underwater, while swimming alongside it.

He's furious with the committee's decision and sets out to fight for his right to save his father's life. Through the film's portrayal of a relationship full of love, rejection, and co-dependency, it manages to shed some light and question the importance of human life, human connection, and if life is even possible without either one of them.98Michael Rozenbaum & Marek RozenbaumIsraelHebrewFestival 2019Tel Aviv on FireSalam, an inexperienced young Palestinian man, becomes a writer on a popular soap opera after a chance meeting with an Israeli soldier.

Dr. Tamir and his team take the viewers on an emotional rollercoaster as they deal with the most serious question of who to treat and who will be left to die. The experienced physicians find it hard to detach from the emotional bond they share with their small patients. \"A Heartbeat Away\" is a riveting human drama, swinging on the pendulum between science and faith, hope and despair, life and death—in its center, human doctors who have been thrust to the position of Gods in the midst of Africa.55Tal Barda, Noam PinchasIsraelHebrewFestival 2018An Act of DefianceIn this riveting historical drama, 10 political activists (including Nelson Mandela and his inner circle of Black and Jewish supporters) face a possible death sentence for conspiracy to commit sabotage after they are arrested by the apartheid South African government during a raid in the town of Rivonia during the summer of 1963.

They are both Hedy Lamarr, the glamour icon whose ravishing visage was the inspiration for Snow White and Cat Woman and a technological trailblazer who perfected a radio system to throw Nazi torpedoes off course during WWII. Weaving interviews and clips with never-before-heard audio tapes of Hedy speaking on the record about her incredible life—from her beginnings as an Austrian Jewish emigre to her scandalous nude scene in the 1933 film Ecstasy to her glittering Hollywood life to her ground-breaking but completely uncredited inventions to her latter years when she became a recluse, impoverished and almost forgotten—\"BOMBSHELL: THE HEDY LAMARR STORY\" brings to light the story of an unusual and accomplished woman, spurned as too beautiful to be smart, but a role model to this day..88Alexandra DeanUnited StatesEnglishFestival 2018Budapest NoirA murder mystery set in Budapest 1936, just as Hungary was preparing to allign itself with Hitler.

Most of the group have a simple motivation: to raise the money necessary to leave Germany behind and move on to the United States. But David has a secret, and the beautiful American Army investigator Sara Simon (Antje Traue, \"Man of Steel\") is determined to uncover it.

The violin is Perlman's chosen instrument, the vehicle he has used to overcome his own challenges and express himself to the world. In Perlman and his music, we hear the story of obstacles and survival, we trace the path of the Jewish people from the chaos of Europe to the promise of Israel, and we see the comfort of home and family and witness how humor and talent combine with discipline and drive. We hear his tales of growing up as the child of Polish survivors, where his mastery of the instrument takes him from his small neighborhood in Tel Aviv to the world’s most prominent stages , and we hear his perspective on music and life. Through Itzhak Perlman, we’re able to see an artist at work, a modern Jewish family embracing its heritage while living in a world of changing expectations, and how the legacy of both the Jewish people and the violin are knitted together in one remarkable human being.83Alison ChernickUnited States, IsraelEnglishFestival 2018Kavod GadolDaniel gets a wonderful surprise from his father for his Bar Mitzvah party—a sheep—to slaughter.
