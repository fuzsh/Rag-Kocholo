        "text": "(Updated from a story published November 17, 2021, referring to a production that was subsequently postponed.)\n\nShakespeare Theatre Company has cast Thornton Wilder’s Our Town entirely with DMV-based actors. Directed by STC’s Associate Artistic Director ALAN PAUL (Camelot) and playing May 12 to June 11, 2022, at Sidney Harman Hall, this Our Town production will celebrate community by utilizing only artists who call the DC-area home.\n\nLed by five-time Helen Hayes Award winner HOLLY TWYFORD (Old Times, The Little Dog Laughed) in the iconic role of the Stage Manager, the cast includes CHINNA PALMER (Fairview) as Emily Webb and JAKE LOEWENTHAL (Macbeth) as George Gibbs, STC Affiliated Artist CRAIG WALLACE (Romeo and Juliet) as Mr. Webb, FELICIA CURRY (The Color Purple) as Mrs. Webb, ERIC HISSOM (Out of Time) as Dr. Gibbs, NATASCIA DIAZ (Man of La Mancha) as Mrs. Gibbs, and LAWRENCE REDMOND as Simon Stimson.\n\nAlso featured in the cast are ELLIOT DASH as Constable Warren, HUDSON KOONCE as Joe Crowell, SARAH MARSHALL as Mrs. Soames, TOMMY NELSON as Wally Webb, SUZANNE RICHARD as Joe Stoddard, CHRISTOPHER MICHAEL RICHARDSON as Howie Newsome, and KIMBERLY SCHRAF as Professor Willard.\n\nIn addition, the ensemble now includes three students from STC’s Academy for Classical Acting: JOSH DECKER, QUINN M. JOHNSON, and SUMMER WEI.\n\nA literary classic, Thornton Wilder’s Pulitzer Prize-winning Our Town continues to leave audiences awestruck with wonder and a shared sense of our humanity. Guided by an amiable stage manager, the theater becomes turn-of-the-century Grover’s Corners, where the occurrences of everyday life reveal universal truths about community and love, life and death. “A hauntingly beautiful play” (The New York Times), Our Town is both deeply allegorical and endlessly captivating.\n\nFrom STC’s Associate Artistic Director Alan Paul: “Our Town is more than a play—it’s a ritual of renewal. I can’t wait to hear Thornton Wilder’s timeless words fill Sidney Harman Hall as we emerge from this pandemic and come back to the theater. After such a long time apart, it seemed only fitting to reunite audiences with the local DC artists that they best recognize and love. It feels like a sort of homecoming for artists and audiences alike.”\n\nIn choosing to program this production for STC’s 36th Season Artistic Director Simon Godwin offers, “Our Town is a celebration of community. One of the greatest American plays, this production—starring all local actors—will be a glorious affirmation of our city and the healing power of stories. Wondrous, tender, and humane, Our Town will be the healing tonic all of us need.\n\nOur Town plays from May 12 to June 11, 2022, at Sidney Harman Hall, 610 F Street NW, Washington, DC.
