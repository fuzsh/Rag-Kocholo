        "text": "I think this ^^ is probably the root of any perceived prickliness we hear sometimes in interviews... rightly or wrongly, Burton seems to feel that the Guess Who were never given their proper due in rock n' roll history. He has talked about their absence in the HOF... and the fact that being Canadian was held against them by critics and rock historians.\n\nHe reminds me of Rod Argent in this regard... who also has a big chip on his shoulder about his place in rock history.\n\nBurton also seems to have a love / hate relationship with his hometown of Winnipeg... feeling that maybe he is under-appreciated there for putting that town on the musical map. So, sometimes the interviews we hear locally are a bit terse and he comes across as a dick. He does have a point, tho'... the attempts to make it up to him (re-naming a community club and a run-down theatre after him) were way overdue and half-hearted.\n\nI was a huge fan in the early to mid-70s (Guess Who Mk. 2... after Bachman left / the Kurt Winter years)... but those solo BC albums left me cold... mostly cheesy yacht rock in retrospect. I thought the Guess Who reunion tour in the late 90s was great... and I would probably still pay to see him. But, like with many of my past RnR heroes, probably best not to meet him in person.\n\nThey say fans shouldn't meet their heroes, and I can get that when it comes to Burton. There proabably isn't a question he hasn't been asked, and probably a few he's been asked too often for comfort. Only thing that bugs me about him and The Guess Who is, they stayed real close to the original versions on stage - heck, if I wanted to hear it the way I've always heard it, I could just take out any of 11 compilation albums, and play Side One (they're almost always in the same order). I heard the re-formed version sans Kale in Philadelphia just a few days after 9/11...and it all sounded the same as that Running Back Through Canada tour album recorded a year earlier...and when you go back to the Together Again album, well, nothing seems to have changed. Then go further back, to Live At The Paramount when Buddha gave us a few more examples from thos two nights...deja vu. Maybe I was spoiled by folks like Zappa and Rundgren, but for a great an arena band as they've been...I don't hear a lot of looseness in their sets. Which is odd, considering \"American Woman\", surely their biggest success, was all built on an improvised riff, and some hastily-slapped-together lyrics.\n\nAs for Burton, he truly was a sponge in the days before The Devrons, all the way into the pre-Nimbus 9 era. He embraced the rock & roll that was changing the world, strapped himself to that piano, and just kept getting better and better. That's an honest touchstone to his work, that heritage. But you can't expect artists not to change, be it to keep themselves vital to a changing and maturing audience, or just to keep performing a strong set. And if you think you've heard \"No Time\" enough to keep you for the rest of your life, well, you weren't the one who's been singin' it steadily since 1968. So if he dialed-back his adenoids and leaned a little A/C for his solo career, you just gotta remember, that smartass young upstart who elbowed Chad Allen out of the limelight, was not the same world-weary guy who gave us those freak-outs like \"Truckin' Off Across The Sky\"...and neither of those were the guy who put out Plus Signs. And somewhere, back in earlier internet history, he told us in a Yahoo Group, that he's got over a thousand songs written that never got recorded, and I believe him. As a writer myself, I understand the wisdom of knowing you're not really a \"writer\", until you can get those first 10,000 or so pages out of your way, so you're ready to write the good stuff.\n\nI hope he finds the right avenue for taking the world by storm once more, with fresh, more mature material. In the meantime though, if the man wants to remind you he was the greatest thing that ever happened to rock and roll showbiz, cut him some slack."
