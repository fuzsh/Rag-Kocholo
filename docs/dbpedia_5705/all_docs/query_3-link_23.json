        "text": "Overview\n\nPoor fen is a sedge-dominated wetland found on very strongly to strongly acid, saturated peat that is moderately influenced by groundwater. The community occurs north of the climatic tension zone in kettle depressions and in flat areas or mild depressions on glacial outwash and glacial lakeplain.\n\nRank\n\nGlobal Rank: G3 - Vulnerable\n\nState Rank: S3 - Vulnerable\n\nCounty Distribution Map\n\nLandscape Context\n\nPoor fen occurs in flat areas and shallow depressions on sandy glacial outwash and glacial lakeplain, and in kettle depressions on pitted outwash and moraines. Poor fens found in kettle depressions are associated with active or extinct glacial lakes. Within kettle depressions, poor fens can occupy the entire basin or occur as a floating mat along the margin of a remaining glacial lake. Poor fens occurring on former glacial lakebeds and drainageways tend to be more extensive than kettle fens, which are limited in area by the size of the glacial ice-block that formed the basin. Poor fens occur adjacent to other peatland communities, often grading into bog, poor conifer swamp, and muskeg. More minerotrophic systems such as northern fen, northern shrub thicket, northern wet meadow, and rich conifer swamp can occur along the outer margins of poor fens where groundwater seepage from adjacent uplands is prevalent. Upland community types neighboring poor fen typically include fire-adapted communities such as pine barrens, dry northern forest, and dry-mesic northern forest.\n\nSoils\n\nThe organic soils of poor fens are composed of peat, which frequently forms a shallow, continuous mat ranging from one to three meters in depth. Organic soils near the surface are fibric peat and very strongly to strongly acid with low nutrient availability. Low levels of groundwater input combined with high water-retaining capacity of fibric peat produce continuously saturated conditions in the rooting zone of poor fens. The water table of poor fens is stable, typically at the soil surface with soils remaining saturated but seldom flooded. The surface waters of poor fens are characterized by very strong to strong acidity, low available nutrients, low specific conductivity, cool temperatures, moderate levels of dissolved organic matter, and anaerobic conditions.\n\nNatural Processes\n\nPoor fens are weakly minerotrophic peatlands, receiving inputs of water and nutrients from both ion-poor precipitation and low exposure to nutrient-rich groundwater. The acidity of poor fens limits the availability and uptake of essential mineral nutrients by plants. Saturated and inundated conditions inhibit organic matter decomposition and allow for the accumulation of peat. Under cool, anaerobic, and acidic conditions, the rate of organic matter accumulation exceeds organic decay. Development and expansion of fens occurs via two different processes in glacial lakeplains and outwash plains versus kettle depressions. Fens develop in glacial lakeplains and outwash where groundwater influence maintains saturated conditions. Peat develops vertically and spreads horizontally. Lake-filling occurs in small kettle lakes with minimal wave action where gradual peat accumulation results in the development of a sedge mat that can fill the basin or form a floating mat in the lake or a grounded mat along the waterâ€™s edge. Floating mats of fen sedges, such as wiregrass sedge (Carex lasiocarpa), are able to pioneer open water and submergent and emergent marshes. The interlacing of rhizomes and roots forms a floating mat that is buoyed by the water and accumulates organic matter in the form of sapric peat. Over time fen mats are often invaded by ericaceous shrubs and acidifying sphagnum mosses. The invasion of sphagnum moss into rich fen systems such as northern fen often results in conversion to more acidic communities such as poor fen or bog.\n\nNatural disturbance factors influencing poor fens include fire, flooding, windthrow, and insects. Surface fire can contribute to the maintenance of fens by killing encroaching trees and promoting graminoid dominance. In addition, many of the shrub species resprout following fire. In the absence of fire, a thick layer of leaf litter can develop that stifles seedling establishment and seed bank expression. Fire severity and frequency in fens is closely related to landscape context and fluctuations in water level. Prolonged periods of lowered water table can allow the surface peat to dry out sufficiently to burn. Such peat fires can result in the conversion of peatland to mineral soil wetland. Peat fires within bogs can also release enough nutrients to favor succession to more minerotrophic peatlands such as poor fen or intermittent wetland. Lowering of the water table of fens can also result in the increase in decomposition rates of organic matter and the subsequent accumulation of compact peat that is more conducive to shrub and tree growth. In such a circumstance, poor fen can succeed to poor conifer swamp or northern shrub thicket. Flooding, often caused by beaver activity, can contribute to the maintenance of fens and also result in the conversion of fens to bogs. Roots of peatland trees are physiologically active near the surface and are killed when the water table rises during prolonged flooding. Trees growing in fens are particularly susceptible to windthrow because peat provides a poor substrate for anchoring trees and the anaerobic conditions associated with saturated soils prevent trees from rooting deeply. Tree survival in fens is also limited by insects and parasites. Insect outbreaks of larch sawfly (Pristiphora erichsonii) cause heavy mortality of tamarack (Larix laricina), while the plant parasite dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium pusillum) kills black spruce (Picea mariana).\n\nVegetation\n\nPoor fens have a unique flora that is intermediate between northern fen and bog. Poor fens are characterized by a graminoid-dominated herbaceous layer of low to moderate diversity. While sedges remain dominant, many poor fens also support a continuous carpet of sphagnum mosses and widely scattered, slightly raised peat ridges or mounds with low ericaceous, evergreen shrubs and stunted conifer trees. Gradients in pH, light, soil moisture, and cation concentrations (i.e., nutrient availability) determine floristic composition of poor fens. Sedges dominate the species-poor herbaceous layer of poor fens. Few-seed sedge (Carex oligosperma) and wiregrass sedge (Carex lasiocarpa) are typically dominant. Other sedges that are characteristic of poor fens include creeping sedge (Carex chordorrhiza), coastal sedge (C. exilis), livid sedge (C. livida), few-flower sedge (C. pauciflora), and mud sedge (C. limosa). Additional graminoids that thrive in poor fens include twig-rush (Cladium mariscoides), three-way sedge (Dulichium arundinaceum), cotton-grasses (Eriophorum spp.), swamp candles (Lysimachia terrestris), white beak-rush (Rhynchospora alba), arrow-grass (Scheuchzeria palustris), and tufted bulrush (Trichophorum cespitosum). The following is a list of prevalent herbaceous plants occurring in poor fen: rush aster (Symphyotrichum boreale), fireweed (Chamerion angustifolium), fringed willow-herb (Epilobium ciliatum), grass-leaved goldenrod (Euthamia graminifolia), wild blue flag (Iris versicolor), bog buckbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), marsh cinquefoil (Comarum palustre), false mayflower (Maianthemum trifolium), bog goldenrod (Solidago uliginosa), and common bog arrow-grass (Triglochin maritima). Insectivorous plants, round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), spoon-leaf sundew (D. intermedia), pitcher-plant (Sarracenia purpurea), horned bladderwort (Utricularia cornuta), and flat-leaved bladderwort (U. intermedia), are common features of poor fens. Where a continuous moss layer occurs, it is dominated by sphagnum mosses, especially Sphagnum magellanicum, S. angustifolium, S. capillaceum, S. capillifolium, S. recurvum, S. papillosum, and S. fuscum.\n\nThe patchy shrub layer of poor fens is dominated by low, primarily ericaceous shrubs including bog rosemary (Andromeda glaucophylla), leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), bog laurel (Kalmia polifolia), Labrador tea (Rhododendron groenlandicum), bog willow (Salix pedicellaris), large cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), and small cranberry (V. oxycoccos). The tall shrub layer of poor fens is less dense than the low shrub layer and is often restricted to the periphery. Tall shrubs typical of poor fens include black chokeberry (Aronia prunifolia), mountain holly (Ilex mucronata), pussy willow (Salix discolor), steeplebush (Spiraea tomentosa), and wild-raisin (Viburnum cassinoides). More minerotrophic shrubs, like bog birch (Betula pumila), Kalmâ€™s St. Johnâ€™s-wort (Hypericum kalmianum), and shrubby cinquefoil (Dasiphora fruticosa), can occur in poor fens where their roots extend beneath the surface mat to minerotrophic peat. Trees within poor fens are widely scattered (tree cover is typically less than 10%), stunted (seldom reaching six meters), and are often restricted to scattered, low peat mounds. The most commonly occurring trees in poor fens are black spruce (Picea mariana) and tamarack (Larix laricina), with jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and white pine (P. strobus) as occasional associates.\n\nFor information about plant species, visit the Michigan Flora website.\n\nPlant Lists\n\nGraminoids\n\nsedges (Carex chordorrhiza, C. exilis, C. lasiocarpa, C. limosa, C. livida, C. oligosperma, C. pauciflora, and others)\n\ntwig-rush (Cladium mariscoides)\n\nthree-way sedge (Dulichium arundinaceum)\n\ncotton-grasses (Eriophorum angustifolium, E. vaginatum, and E. virginicum)\n\nwhite beak-rush (Rhynchospora alba)\n\ntufted bulrush (Trichophorum cespitosum)\n\nForbs\n\nmarsh cinquefoil (Comarum palustre)\n\nspatulate-leaved sundew (Drosera intermedia)\n\nround-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia)\n\nfringed willow-herb (Epilobium ciliatum)\n\ngrass-leaved goldenrod (Euthamia graminifolia)\n\nwild blue flag (Iris versicolor)\n\nswamp candles (Lysimachia terrestris)\n\nfalse mayflower (Maianthemum trifolium)\n\nbog buckbean (Menyanthes trifoliata)\n\nbog aster (Oclemena nemoralis)\n\npitcher-plant (Sarracenia purpurea)\n\narrow-grass (Scheuchzeria palustris)\n\nbog goldenrod (Solidago uliginosa)\n\nrush aster (Symphyotrichum boreale)\n\ncommon bog arrow-grass (Triglochin maritima)\n\nbladderworts (Utricularia cornuta and U. intermedia)\n\nMosses\n\nsphagnum mosses (Sphagnum spp.)\n\nShrubs\n\nbog rosemary (Andromeda glaucophylla)\n\nblack chokeberry (Aronia prunifolia)\n\nbog birch (Betula pumila)\n\nleatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata)\n\nKalmâ€™s St. Johnâ€™s-wort (Hypericum kalmianum)\n\nmountain holly (Ilex mucronata)\n\nbog laurel (Kalmia polifolia)\n\nsweet gale (Myrica gale)\n\nLabrador-tea (Rhododendron groenlandicum)\n\nbog willow (Salix pedicellaris)\n\nmeadowsweet (Spiraea alba)\n\nsteeplebush (Spiraea tomentosa)\n\nlarge cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon)\n\nsmall cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos)\n\nwild-raisin (Viburnum cassinoides)\n\nTrees\n\ntamarack (Larix laricina)\n\nblack spruce (Picea mariana)\n\njack pine (Pinus banksiana)\n\nwhite pine (Pinus strobus)\n\nNoteworthy Animals\n\nPoor fens provide important habitat for small mammals such as short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda), beaver (Castor canadensis), meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), mink (Mustela vison), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), and masked shrew (Sorex cinereus). Both muskrats and beaver can profoundly influence the hydrology of peatlands. Muskrats create open water channels through the peat and beavers can cause substantial flooding through their dam-building activities. Beaver dams can cause blocked drainage in fens and the subsequent succession of fens to bogs. Numerous butterflies and moths are restricted to bogs and fens because their food plants occur within these open peatland systems.\n\nRare Plants\n\nCarex nigra (black sedge, state endangered)\n\nCarex wiegandii (Wiegand's sedge, state threatened)\n\nEleocharis nitida (slender spike-rush, state endangered)\n\nPetasites sagittatus (sweet coltsfoot, state threatened)\n\nRare Animals\n\nAlces alces (moose, state threatened)\n\nAppalachia arcana (secretive locust, state special concern)\n\nArdea herodias (great blue heron, protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918)\n\nAsio flammeus (short-eared owl, state endangered)\n\nBoloria freija (Freija fritillary, state special concern)\n\nBoloria frigga (Frigga fritillary, state special concern)\n\nBotaurus lentiginosus (American bittern, state special concern)\n\nCanis lupus (gray wolf, state threatened)\n\nCircus cyaneus (northern harrier, state special concern)\n\nClemmys guttata (spotted turtle, state threatened)\n\nCoturnicops noveboracensis (yellow rail, state threatened)\n\nEmydoidea blandingii (Blandingâ€™s turtle, state special concern)\n\nErebia discoidalis (red-disked alpine, state special concern)\n\nFalcipennis canadensis (spruce grouse, state special concern)\n\nFalco columbarius (merlin, state threatened)\n\nHaliaeetus leucocephalus (bald eagle, state threatened)\n\nLynx canadensis (lynx, state endangered)\n\nMerolonche dolli (Dollâ€™s merolonche moth, state special concern)\n\nPandion haliaetus (osprey, state threatened)\n\nPhyciodes batesii (tawny crescent, state special concern)\n\nPicoides arcticus (black-backed woodpecker, state special concern)\n\nPseudacris triseriata maculata (boreal chorus frog, state special concern)\n\nSistrurus c. catenatus (eastern massasauga, federal candidate species and state special concern)\n\nSomatochlora incurvata (incurvate emerald, state special concern)\n\nTerrapene c. carolina (eastern box turtle, state special concern)\n\nWilliamsonia fletcheri (ebony boghaunter, state special concern)\n\nBiodiversity Management Considerations\n\nThe primary mechanism for preserving poor fens is to maintain their hydrology and water chemistry. A serious threat to poor fens is posed by off-road vehicle (ORV) traffic, which can destroy populations of sensitive species and significantly alter fen hydrology through rutting. Reducing access to peatland systems will help decrease detrimental impacts. Increased surface water inputs and reductions in groundwater recharge can be prevented by avoiding road construction and complete canopy removal in stands immediately adjacent to fens. Where shrub and tree encroachment threatens to convert open wetlands to shrub-dominated systems or forested swamps, prescribed fire or selective cutting can be employed to maintain open conditions. Silvicultural management of poor fens to preserve open canopy should be employed during the winter to minimize damage to the peat and impacts to the hydrologic regime. Where feasible, fires originating in adjacent uplands should be allowed to burn across poor fens when they do not pose serious safety concerns or threaten other management objectives.\n\nPoor fens are primarily threatened by changes to their hydrology and water chemistry, which may result from road building, ORVs, quarrying, peat mining, creation of drainage ditches and dams, agricultural runoff and nutrient enrichment, or runoff from logging. Fen vegetation is extremely sensitive to minor changes in water levels, water chemistry, groundwater flow, and nutrient availability. A reduction in groundwater flow and subsequent decrease in nutrients in poor fens can result in the shift to less minerotrophic wetlands such as bog. Lowered water tables from drainage allow tree and shrub encroachment into open fens and the eventual succession to closed-canopy peatlands. Conversion to more eutrophic wetlands has occurred as the result of nutrient enrichment and raised water levels, which cause increased decomposition of peat soils. Eutrophication from pollution and altered hydrology has detrimentally impacted fens by generating conditions favorable for invasive species. Monitoring and control efforts to detect and remove invasive species are critical to the long-term viability of poor fen. Particularly aggressive invasive species that may threaten the diversity and community structure of poor fen include purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), narrow-leaved cat-tail (Typha angustifolia), hybrid cat-tail (Typha xglauca), reed (Phragmites australis subsp. australis), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), European marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre), glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus), and multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora).\n\nVariation\n\nSpecies composition of poor fens varies depending on gradients in nutrient levels and water chemistry. The degree of minerotrophy of a given fen and within a fen depends on a variety of factors including the amount of groundwater discharge and its chemistry; degree of dilution from precipitation; the characteristics of the bedrock and/or glacial deposits the groundwater has percolated through (i.e., older glacial sediments have less dissolved minerals due to prior leaching); the distance the water has traveled through the peatland; and the thickness and character of the peat. Fens occurring on former glacial lakebeds and drainageways tend to be more extensive than kettle fens, which are limited in area by the size of the glacial ice-block that formed the basin.\n\nSimilar Natural Communities\n\nBog, coastal fen, intermittent wetland, muskeg, northern fen, northern wet meadow, patterned fen, poor conifer swamp, prairie fen, and rich conifer swamp.\n\nPlaces to Visit\n\nCyr Fen, Escanaba State Forest Management Unit, Marquette Co.\n\nLovell's Fen, Grayling State Forest Management Unit, Crawford Co.\n\nNahma Fen, Hiawatha National Forest, Delta Co.\n\nNine Mile Fen, Roscommon State Forest Management Unit, Roscommon Co.\n\nSnow Lake Fen, Barry State Game Area, Barry Co.\n\nTahquamenon River Mouth Fen, Tahquamenon Falls State Park, Chippewa Co.\n\nRelevant Literature\n\nAmon, J.P., C.A.
