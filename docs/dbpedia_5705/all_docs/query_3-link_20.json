The Town is prepared and coordinating with the OPP and other law enforcement partners to ensure there is a plan in place that will keep residents and visitors safe and informed throughout the weekend.\n\n“Wasaga Beach is a safe, fun community and every summer we welcome millions of visitors from far and wide,” said Mayor Brian Smith. “We have an incredible weekend planned. We welcome everyone who visits Wasaga Beach to have fun, play and swim safely, and to respect our laws and the people who enforce them.”\n\n“The Town’s Fire Department, municipal law enforcement officers, Simcoe County first responders, provincial park wardens and OPP detachment are working together to ensure this long weekend, and this summer, continues to be safe and fun for everyone,” Smith added.\n\nThe OPP are urging residents and visitors to “get out and enjoy the summer festivities, obey the law, and respect the community,” said Inspector Leah Gilfoy of the Huronia West OPP, “we are proud to be coordinating with our municipalities, other emergency services partners and the community to ensure a safe last long weekend of summer for all to enjoy.”\n\nQuick facts\n\nWasaga Beach is the longest freshwater beach in the world. Each year, the Town welcomes over 2 million visitors.\n\nThe Labour Day long weekend, also the last long weekend of summer, is one of the busiest. Stay informed about road closures, traffic diversion and traffic calming measures that may take effect by following the Town’s Twitter and Facebook channels.\n\nTown Hall and facilities will be closed to respect the Labour Day statutory holiday on Monday September 4.\n\nSafety is everyone’s responsibility.
