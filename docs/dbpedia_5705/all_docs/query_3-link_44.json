        "text": "DDT\n\nDDT was widely used during World War II to protect soldiers and civilians from malaria, typhus, and other diseases spread by insects. After the war, DDT continued to be used to control disease, and it was sprayed on a variety of agricultural crops, especially cotton. DDT continues to be applied against mosquitoes in several countries to control malaria. Its stability, its persistence (as much as 50% can remain in the soil 10-15 years after application), and its widespread use have meant that DDT residues can be found everywhere; residual DDT has even been detected in the Arctic.\n\nPerhaps the best known toxic effect of DDT is egg-shell thinning among birds, especially birds of prey. Its impact on bird populations led to bans in many countries during the 1970s. Although its use had been banned in many countries, it has been detected in food from all over the world. Although residues in domestic animals have declined steadily over the last two decades, food-borne DDT remains the greatest source of exposure for the general population. The short-term acute effects of DDT on humans are limited, but long-term exposures have been associated with chronic health effects. DDT has been detected in breast milk, raising serious concerns about infant health.\n\nHeptachlor\n\nListed under Annex A\n\nPrimarily used to kill soil insects and termites, heptachlor has also been used more widely to kill cotton insects, grasshoppers, other crop pests, and malaria-carrying mosquitoes. It is believed to be responsible for the decline of several wild bird populations, including Canadian Geese and American Kestrels in the Columbia River basin in the US. The geese died after eating seeds treated with levels of heptachlor lower than the usage levels recommended by the manufacturer, indicating that even responsible use of heptachlor may kill wildlife. Laboratory tests have also shown high doses of heptachlor to be fatal to mink, rats, and rabbits, with lower doses causing adverse behavioral changes and reduced reproductive success.\n\nHeptachlor is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Food is the major source of exposure for humans, and residues have been detected in the blood of cattle from the US and from Australia.\n\nHexachlorobenzene (HCB)\n\nListed under Annex A and Annex C\n\nFirst introduced in 1945 to treat seeds, HCB kills fungi that affect food crops. It was widely used to control wheat bunt. It is also a byproduct of the manufacture of certain industrial chemicals and exists as an impurity in several pesticide formulations.\n\nWhen people in eastern Turkey ate HCB-treated seed grain between 1954 and 1959, they developed a variety of symptoms, including photosensitive skin lesions, colic, and debilitation; several thousand developed a metabolic disorder called porphyria turcica, and 14% died. Mothers also passed HCB to their infants through the placenta and through breast milk. In high doses, HCB is lethal to some animals and, at lower levels, adversely affects their reproductive success. HCB has been found in food of all types. A study of Spanish meat found HCB present in all samples. In India, the estimated average daily intake of HCB is 0.13 micrograms per kilogram of body weight.\n\nMirex\n\nListed under Annex A\n\nThis insecticide is used mainly to combat fire ants, and it has been used against other types of ants and termites. It has also been used as a fire retardant in plastics, rubber, and electrical goods.\n\nDirect exposure to mirex does not appear to cause injury to humans, but studies on laboratory animals have caused it to be classified as a possible human carcinogen. In studies mirex proved toxic to several plant species and to fish and crustaceans. It is considered to be one of the most stable and persistent pesticides, with a half life of up to 10 years. The main route of human exposure to mirex is through food, particularly meat, fish, and wild game.\n\nToxaphene\n\nListed under Annex A\n\nThis insecticide is used on cotton, cereal grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables. It has also been used to control ticks and mites in livestock. Toxaphene was the most widely used pesticide in the US in 1975. Up to 50% of a toxaphene release can persist in the soil for up to 12 years.\n\nFor humans, the most likely source of toxaphene exposure is food. While the toxicity to humans of direct exposure is not high, toxaphene has been listed as a possible human carcinogen due to its effects on laboratory animals. It is highly toxic to fish; brook trout exposed to toxaphene for 90 days experienced a 46% reduction in weight and reduced egg viability, and long-term exposure to levels of 0.5 micrograms per liter of water reduced egg viability to zero.\n\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)\n\nListed under Annex A with specific exemptions and under Annex C\n\nThese group of chemicals possess properties including longevity, heat absorbance and form an oily liquid at room temperature that is useful for electrical utilities and in other industrial applications. Due to their physico-chemical properties, PCB were manufactured worldwide for use in a wide range of applications, most importantly as insulating were and heat exchange fluids in transformers and capacitors and other electric equipment, and in open applications such as additives in paint, carbonless copy paper, and plastics.\n\nPCB are toxic and can cause serious health effects in humans and animals, including reproductive impairment and immune system dysfunctions. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified PCB as Group 1 “carcinogenic to humans”. Of the 209 different types of PCBs, 13 exhibit a dioxin-like toxicity. Their persistence in the environment corresponds to the degree of chlorination, and half-lives can vary from 10 days to one-and-a-half years.\n\nOnce in the environment, PCB enter the food chain. PCB have been detected in human milk and, in some cases, observed levels of PCB were found to be several orders of magnitude higher than the WHO safety level. Large numbers of people have been exposed to PCBs through food contamination. Consumption of PCB-contaminated rice oil in Japan in 1968 and in Taiwan in 1979 caused pigmentation of nails and mucous membranes and swelling of the eyelids, along with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Due to the persistence of PCBs in their mothers' bodies, children born up to seven years after the Taiwan incident showed developmental delays and behavioural problems. Similarly, children of mothers who ate large amounts of contaminated fish from Lake Michigan showed poorer short-term memory function. PCBs also suppress the human immune system and are listed as probable human carcinogens.\n\nPCBs are toxic to wildlife, including fish, killing them at higher doses and causing spawning failures at lower doses. Research also links PCB to reproductive failure and suppression of the immune system in various wild animals, such as seals and mink.\n\nPCB web section covers an overview, decisions, guidance, meetings, technical assistance activities, reports and additional resources. Information of the work of the Small Intersessional Working Group on PCB and the PCB Elimination Network is also available.\n\nPolychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD)\n\nListed under Annex C\n\nThese chemicals are produced unintentionally due to incomplete combustion, as well during the manufacture of pesticides and other chlorinated substances. They are emitted mostly from the burning of hospital waste, municipal waste, and hazardous waste, and also from automobile emissions, peat, coal, and wood. There are 75 different dioxins, of which seven are considered to be of concern. One type of dioxin was found to be present in the soil 10 - 12 years after the first exposure.\n\nDioxins have been associated with a number of adverse effects in humans, including immune and enzyme disorders and chloracne, and they are classified as possible human carcinogens. Laboratory animals given dioxins suffered a variety of effects, including an increase in birth defects and stillbirths. Fish exposed to these substances died shortly after the exposure ended. Food (particularly from animals) is the major source of exposure for humans.\n\nPerfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), its salts and PFHxS-related compounds\n\nRisk profile Ar, Ch, En, Fr, Ru, Sp (PDF)\n\nRisk management evaluation Ar, Ch, En, Fr, Ru, Sp (PDF)\n\nDraft indicative list of substances covered by the listing of PFHxS, its salts and PFHxS-related compounds (UNEP/POPS/POPRC.15/INF/9)\n\nChemical identity and properties\n\n“Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), its salts and PFHxS related compounds” means the following:\n\nPerfluorohexane sulfonic acid (CAS No. 355-46-4, PFHxS), including branched isomers;\n\nIts salts;\n\nAny substance that contains the chemical moiety C6F13SO2- as one of its structural elements and that potentially degrades to PFHxS.\n\nUse and production\n\nPFHxS, its salts and PFHxS related compounds have been intentionally used at least in the following applications: (1) Aqueous Film-Forming Foams (AFFFs) for fire-fighting; (2) metal plating; (3) textiles, leather and upholstery; (4) polishing agents and cleaning/washing agents; (5) coatings, impregnation/proofing (for protection from damp, fungus etc.); and (6) within the manufacturing of electronics and semiconductors. In addition, other potential use categories may include pesticides, flame retardants, paper and packaging, in the oil industry, and hydraulic fluids. PFHxS, its salts and PFHxS related compounds have been used in certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based consumer products. PFHxS is and has been unintentionally produced during the electrochemical fluorination (ECF) processes of some other PFSAs. In many applications, PFHxS has been used as a replacement for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).\n\nPOPs characteristics of PFHxS\n\nPFHxS are very resistant to chemical, thermal and biological degradation due to their strong carbon-fluorine bonds and a resistance to degradation which makes it persistent in the environment. Numerous studies have reported elevated levels of PFHxS in soil, water and a variety of biota. Humans are exposed to PFHxS mainly through intake of food and drinking water but also through the indoor environment through dust or consumer products containing PFHxS or its precursors. Following PFOS and PFOA, PFHxS is the most frequently detected PFAS in blood-based samples from the general population worldwide. PFHxS is present in the umbilical cord blood and breast milk. Breast milk may be an important source of exposure for breast-fed infants since it is documented that PFHxS is excreted via lactation. Contamination of drinking water can result in highly increased PFHxS serum levels due to the long elimination-time in humans. Use of drinking water for food preparation can add to the background levels present in foods.\n\nReplacement of PFHxS\n\nThe assessment of alternatives to PFOS under the Stockholm Convention has revealed that alternatives are available for all potential applications which could also be relevant for PFHxS, its salts and related compounds. Alternatives include both fluorinated and non-fluorinated substances as well as alternative (non-chemical) technical solutions. Information on availability, accessibility and price of alternatives, as well as information on regulatory measures and use in different countries, reveal that the socioeconomic costs of implementing a ban on the use of PFHxS are considered small and are outweighed by the benefits of an elimination/ regulation. High costs are estimated for remediation of contaminated sites, such as old and current fire-fighting foam training sites and airports, landfills for industrial waste, and hazardous waste, as well as for the removal of PFASs, including PFHxS, from drinking water and water sources affected by PFHxS (and other PFASs) contamination. Implementation of control measures for PFHxS, its salts and PFHxS related compounds would contribute to avoiding such future costs."
