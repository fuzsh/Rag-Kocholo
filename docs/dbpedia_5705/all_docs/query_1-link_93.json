        "text": "I recently received my order.... I just wanted to express my gratitude and appreciation for how well everything was handled. Everything arrived very healthy and active. The Uromastyx pair are almost immediately after getting acclimated and warmed up and the black African house snake is docile and is taking frozen hoppers without an issue. I've never ordered any reptiles online until now and everything about my experience with LLL has been perfect. Even the person who called me after ordering was polite and answered my questions. I'm now a loyal customer, so, Thank you!\n\nHello! I wanted to let you know how pleased I have been with my recent orders of live animals. My giant African millipede and my baby Hermann's Tortoise both arrived healthy and beautiful and both are doing great! I am so pleased with my new family additions. I also want to commend you on your prices and sales-they beat all other websites by far! Thank you so much for offering quality animals at reasonable, and better, prices!"
