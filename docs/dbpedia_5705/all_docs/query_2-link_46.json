        "text": "As a Good Canadian Boy, I had the pleasure of seeing the Guess Who Live at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE Stadium in Toronto) Randy had already formed BTO.\n\nTo me, Burton was the voice of the Guess Who and an exceptionally talented as any \"Front Man\" at the time. When you listen to the Guess Who's song catalogue Burton's voice \"Is\" undeniably the \"Guess Who\"\n\nRandy and Burton's collaborative song writing efforts were certainly unparalleled in Canada and recognized internationally. The Guess Who's legacy and success were based solely on \"Their\" talents and the hit songs that they wrote. Not the rhythm or percussion contributions.\n\nI also had the pleasure of Seeing BTO live twice at the CNE once on their own and the second time with the Beach Boys! So many fond memories.....BTO live in the 70's was an experience that I'll never forget.\n\nIt's tragic, that their legacy, friendship's and memories will forever, be that of a failed marriage!\n\nWhile I can understand both sides of the argument, as a living Guess Who Fan that grew listening to the band on AM radio in the 60's and 70's and for what it's worth when I hear \"Guess Who\" I want to see and hear Burton and Randy.\n\nI first saw the Guess Who about the mid-70s with Domenic Troiano (RIP) on guitar\n\nand it was Burton's vocals and piano playing that made the show interesting for me.\n\nSometime later I saw a special called The Bachman/Cummings Songbook where Randy\n\nand Burt played songs and talked about how they came about.\n\nI last saw Cummings at Berklee Performance Center doing a solo show and he was\n\nin fine form for that show. From what I've heard he's backed by a band called The Carpet\n\nFrogs these days doing shows around Canada.\n\n\"The Carpet Frogs are a Toronto-based rock band. They are known for their work performing at private events and touring with Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings and have performed on Canada's Walk of Fame, Juno Awards, Live 8 Canada, SOCAN Awards, and more. Wikipedia\"\n\nBest wishes to all of them.\n\nBurton Cummings Takes Drastic Measures Against Guess Who 'Cover Band' - Best Classic Bands\n\n\"This doesn't stop this cover band from playing their shows,\" he says, \"it just stops them from playing the songs I own. If the songs are performed by the fake Guess Who, they will be sued for every occurrence.\"\n\nIt almost sounds like Garry and Jim's contributions didn't matter at all. They did to me.\n\nZD,\n\nI understand your feelings and you are correct, as I re-read my post, I made it sound like they didn't matter. My post certainly implied and provoked your understanding, of what I wrote.\n\nFor me, when I think/hear the Guess Who, Burton's voice and when Randy was still a member, they wrote the songs that propelled the group. In a similar fashion to John and Paul driving the Beatles...I loved all of the Fab Four, but the face(s) and fortunes of the group were clearly driven by Lennon/McCartney.....George and Ringo were special in their own right and I appreciate the fact that the Beatles wouldn't have been the same without them....\n\nMy post wasn't meant to offend you or infer that the other members \"didn't matter at all\".\n\nMy post unfortunately, clearly sent that message to you for that, I apologize.\n\nThe Guess Who, like the Beatles would likely have never been the same without Garry or Jim's contributions.\n\nFavourites and opinions will always differ and that's the way it should be.\n\nHappy Halloween!\n\nChad Allen , of Chad Allen and the Expressions \"Shaken All Over\" , was one of the members of the guess who , Chad was a friend of mine when I lived on the coast a talented pianist and fine singer ,\n\nThe Who did a cover of \"Shaken All Over \"on Live at Leeds because they were getting confused with the Guess Who at that time.\n\nsad to see these guys fight over stuff 50+ years later\n\n...I understand your feelings and you are correct, as I re-read my post, I made it sound like they didn't matter. My post certainly implied and provoked your understanding, of what I wrote.....\n\nMy post wasn't meant to offend you or infer that the other members \"didn't matter at all\".\n\nMy post unfortunately, clearly sent that message to you for that, I apologize....\n\nHow to tell us you're Canadian without saying \"I'm Canadian\"\n\nThe Guess Who isn't the Guess Who without Burton Cummings voice.\n\nI'm surprised that anyone would pay $$$ to see them without Cummings.\n\nHe could tour, calling himself Burton Cummings and Friends, and I'd go to the show.\n\nBut, a coupla guys calling themselves the GW who were in the original band, nah.\n\nI'm there for the music (including THAT VOICE) not to see a bunch of old band-members.\n\nimo."
