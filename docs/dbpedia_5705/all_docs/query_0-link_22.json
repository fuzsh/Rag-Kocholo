With the release of his first album \"In Light\" and his latest album \"Red Wagon\" the music industry has taken notice. Shane's latest work challenged him to push the acoustic sound to new heights. His song-writing skills, strong vocals, and work as a guitarist would bring musical success on their own, but combined they are so much more."
