Music tourism is a growing part of the music industry. London saw a 40% rise in music tourists from 4.9 million in 2022, to 6.9 million in 2023. This growth is not just limited to London, with an 86% increase in music tourists to the South West, rising from 1 million in 2022, to 2 million in 2023. There was also a 29% increase of music tourists in the North East, from 352,000 in 2022 to 489,000 in 2023. However, despite the growth in music tourism, independent festivals and grassroots music venues are still struggling and artists are also facing a cost-of-touring crisis. In September 2023, UK Music published its Manifesto for Music, which outlined measures that could be taken to supercharge music industry growth and support the talent pipeline and is now calling on the new Government to take action.

Going to see your favorite artist perform is a real treat and a way to escape from the daily routine. The resurgence of music concerts in the entertainment realm during the post-pandemic era has been warmly embraced by the public, which then led to many music events being held, ranging from local to international musicians. With the expectation that these positive trends will continue into 2024, music festivals have become something that event organizers, entertainment industry, and even the tourism sector cannot overlook 🎤🎪. In our recent survey, we delve into the evolving landscape of live music events and explore the behavior of concert-goers in Indonesia, including their preferences for artists/bands, concert ticket spending, and other interesting aspects.

Your interest drove me to explore and visualize how these vibrant events generate revenue and manage expenses. Finding detailed financial statements for music festivals is impossible. However, through extensive research and analysis of multiple articles and webpages, I've recapped the financial dynamics of some of the largest music festivals like Coachella, Glastonbury, Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and Tomorrowland. The data provided is not actual data from any specific organization but rather a proforma based on industry-reported coefficients. This data is used to construct a P&L (Profit and Loss statement) and visualize it through a Sankey chart. This topic is particularly timely given the buzz around the \"Sunny Hill\" festival being held in Prishtina, which has sparked significant interest and excitement.\n\nToday, UK Music Ltd has published new research into the value of gigs, concerts and festivals to local economies, revealing that a total of 19.2 million music fans travelled from UK towns and cities and overseas to see shows and festivals in the UK in 2023. Dr Jo Twist OBE (she/her), CEO of BPI: \"This welcome news shows that the UK continues to be a global centre for live music, with live gigs, concerts and festivals bringing huge value to the British economy. While there are challenges, particularly for smaller venues, it's particularly exciting to see significant growth in music tourism in the South West and North East, which is testament to the vibrant music ecosystems and incredible talent all across the UK. We have an exciting opportunity to work together, in the industry and with government, to boost creative skills and education and give opportunity to talent from all parts of the UK. This is why it's so important that all parts of the music sector, including under-threat grassroots venues, are enabled to perform their vital role in supporting artists’ careers.\" Read the story in full: https://lnkd.in/eveZqrxS\n\nA lot of people still don't realise the true value of live events. That's OK, because UK Music Ltd's latest report gave us an insight into its impact in 2023... 🎪 19.2 million music fans travelled from across the UK and overseas to see UK shows and festivals (33% increase on the year prior) 🎪 £8 billion spent in local economies as a result of music tourism (21% increase on the year prior) 🎪 62,000 jobs sustained through music tourism (17% increase on the year prior) 🎪 1.014 million foreign music tourists (a slight drop from 1.053 million in the year prior) 🎪 18.2 million domestic music tourists (36% increase on the year prior) And that's just the economic benefits of our industry - think about the benefits to people, places, societies and communities. Despite positive impacts, UK Music CEO Tom Kiehl states: “Grassroots music venues and festivals, studios and rehearsal spaces are facing tough economic pressures and it’s vital that the music ecosystem that enables musicians and artists to perform is supported to ensure that everyone – no matter where they live – can have access to music. “We’re looking forward to working with the new Government to ensure that all our towns and cities have thriving music ecosystems that support the growth of the industry – generating thousands more jobs, boosting economic growth and making their areas even more attractive to visitors.” #grassroots #festivals #events #musicindustry #yourfestivalneedsyou 📸 BLOND:ISH at Labryinth Open Air, Tofte Manor - captured by Jake Philip Davis, produced by The Fair\n\nHow do you make your music event stand out? Now that festival season is here, we've decided to dust off our whitepaper on 'What music festivals do when the music stops?'. Your content strategy will play a crucial role if you understand that it's about connecting and getting your audience to take action. Here are some key strategies 🔑 to help solidify and strengthen these connections. 📊 Transparency Strategies Transparency is essential for building trust with your audience.

What is the ‘seed’ music industry? \"Seed Music\" refers to the stage before grassroots, which is live music in hospitality venues. Seed Music 🫘 Vs. Grassroots 🌱 🎫 When people reference the live music industry, they are typically referring to ticketed gigs, events and festivals. 🎺 By \"Seed Music\" we’re talking about DJs, bands and soloists playing music in venues such as pubs, restaurants, bars and clubs. 📈 While this sub-section of the live music industry has by far the highest number of participating artists and venues, it has previously been unreported on in the UK. Did you read the Live Music Index?\n\nMost orchestras and classical music festivals are losing their purpose and sense of why, due to fear and ignorance. One thing needs to be clear: why are we playing classical music? Who is our primary audience? What are we doing to contribute to society's needs as we continue practicing this centuries old art form? The answer to the overrated word \"innovation\" in our frightened classical music world is being taken in a very amateur and lazy way. Most organizers are not putting in the hours necessary to answer this demand. The result is a confused curatorship that sets the scene for growing mediocrity. If we think that fewer people are attending classical music concerts, then what do we do? Ah, let's play another pops concert that will help sell tickets and bring in new audiences. Well, Starbucks will not start selling beer all of a sudden just because the pub around the corner is packed on Friday afternoon. Starbucks knows it sells coffee and, with it, an environment that aligns with working, reading, and creating. There is a time for that! What about us? What is our product? The more we know about what we do and, first and foremost, why this art form should exist in people’s lives, the better we will face our challenges."
