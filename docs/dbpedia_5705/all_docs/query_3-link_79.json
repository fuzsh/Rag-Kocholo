        "text": "How to identify Fishing Spiders\n\nFemales grow between 15 and 26 mm in length, while males fall between 7 and 13 mm. Fishing spiders are typically brown and may display black and light-brown markings, with brown and black banded rings on the legs. Often confused with wolf spiders, fishing spiders can be distinguished by their large size and the position of their eyes, which are arranged in two horizontal rows of four. Some species display white abdominal markings that range in appearance from spots or speckles to W-shaped or chevron patterns.\n\nSigns of an infestation\n\nFishing spiders commonly live in and around pools and can infiltrate homes. Possible signs of a fishing spider infestation include the moulted exoskeletons of the developing offspring, which are easily recognizable for their large size compared to other spider species. Living close to wooded areas increases the chances of seeing or otherwise encountering fishing spiders.\n\nFishing Spiders Removal\n\nThe removal of fishing spiders entails the cleaning of areas previously occupied by the pests. Getting rid of any woodpiles stacked around the house eliminates harbourage sites. Residents should also spend some time looking around basements and crawl spaces to remove the pests from the home. If a fishing spider infestation gets out of hand, call a local pest control service to combat the problem immediately.\n\nHow to prevent Fishing Spiders from invading\n\nLimit the amount of standing water on the property around the home to reduce the availability of preferred food sources. As fishing spiders also enjoy the vegetation in and around standing bodies of water, limiting these ideal hiding places may result in a reduction of the arachnid population as well.\n\nHabitat, Diet, and Life Cycle\n\nHabitat\n\nSome species of fishing spiders can be found away from bodies of water. However, the majority of species seek water to find prey. As the pests typically move from site to site, they frequently encounter humans. Whether living in the wild or near manmade bodies of water, fishing spiders look to vegetation for cover. These arachnids can also be found under rocks or wood.\n\nDiet\n\nFishing spiders are classified as generalist predators and use ambush tactics to catch many types of prey unaware. Using the water to feel vibrations much like other spiders use webs, these semi-aquatic arachnids grab any kind of reasonably sized prey within reach. Many types of fishing spiders feed on insects, while larger species may catch small fish. The fishing spider diet also consists of tadpoles and small frogs.\n\nLife Cycle\n\nWhile they may not use silk webbing to entrap prey, fishing spiders manufacture silk to facilitate the hatching of their eggs. Female fishing spiders produce egg sacs filled with their offspring, wrap the eggs in the silk, and carry them between their fangs until hatching begins. Once hatching starts, the mother spider creates a nest with webbing to provide protection for the next generation. Hatchlings resemble full-grown adults and shed their exoskeletons over time as their bodies grow.\n\nCommonly Asked Questions\n\nWhy do I have fishing spiders?\n\nFishing spiders, also called dock or wharf spiders, like to live in waterfront properties near lakes, ponds, marshes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, and woods. Swimming pools, boathouses, and boats may also become infested.\n\nAble to feed on prey almost five times their size, fishing spiders have been reported to eat aquatic insects, minnows, tadpoles, frogs, and even small fish. When weaving their own tent-like nests – or nursery webs – they like to build in tall grasses, between rocks, or under docks.\n\nHow worried should I be about fishing spiders?\n\nFor many people, the size and fierce appearance of a fishing spider alone are enough to cause alarm and stress. fishing spiders can also bite when trapped inside clothing, held, or sat or stepped on. Whilst not fatal, the bites are painful, similar to bee stings.\n\nThese pests also reproduce at an alarming rate, laying up to 1,000 eggs at a time, so it is important to act quickly if you suspect an infestation and to contact a professional pest control service to remove these pests effectively."
