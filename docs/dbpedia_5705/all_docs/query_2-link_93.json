After he left, I noticed I had one other item that we had not realized was part of the incident. Ifthe item was low dollar I would have just moved on. I immediately reported the loss to their office. Within 45min of my report, the amazing front office & management had secured the facts of the incident and resolved the issue with a replacement order from the vendor of my damaged item.

So impressed with Ben/ please send again next time and thank you so much! 5 star quality and service and value!Long time consistent user of peace frog. Highly recommend!\n\nJohnny V\n\n1685112451\n\nI have 3 year old carpet that has been moderately abused by 2 dogs, 2 cats and a daughter who is quite messy with her makeup. After several pet stains, oil from pets coats, smeared makeup, and drink spills developed, I figured it was time for a carpet cleaning and began the process of vetting cleaning companies. From the 1st contact, Peace Frog really stood out from the other companies! While speaking with Justin McBride on the phone, he was thorough, listened well, friendly and pleasant. He repeated my concerns back to me and asked clarifying questions, it was a positive experience. They sent a rep to my house to evaluate the job and give a quote. I really appreciated this, because 2 other companies just gave an estimate over the phone without even knowing what the job entailed. Jason Schmidt, the technician who came to my house and gave a quote, explained their entire processes to me, was knowledgeable, friendly, and offered several solutions. He didn't try any \"hard sell\" tactics either (a different company tried this approach and it was very off putting). It was a good experience and a honest price, so I booked the carpet cleaning. Peace Frog sent over Jeremy McKnight, the carpet cleaning technician, and again I was taken back at how friendly and professional their employees were. Jeremy, asked great questions, showed that he listened to my concerns, was personable, and communicated everything extremely well! You can tell he really cares about his customers. He did an outstanding job lifting the stains from our carpet. The carpets look brand new, the house smells great, and we're all super satisfied with our experience in working with Peace Frog! You seriously cant go wrong with using them! Do yourself a favor, and book this company for your cleaning needs!\n\nAmy K.\n\n1683319379\n\nWe recently moved from out of state to the Austin area. Our rental home had beautiful hardwood floors, until you stepped onto them. They were not taken care of or cleaned properly in a long time. I contacted Peace Frog and they sent someone out the next day for an estimate. Jason was amazing. He took the time to talk to me and told me what process he would use to remove the built up grime. They got us in really fast, and even cleaned our kitchen tiles up! I highly recommend them for your flooring needs. Thank you Jason and Jeremy for a wonderful job!!\n\nChondra M\n\n1683314625\n\nY’all, Ben got red wine out of my white sofa and light gray rug! The stain sat for two days until they could get here and there is not a trace of wine left on the sofa. I absolutely love Peace Frog and Ben!\n\nMadison B.\n\n1681752595\n\nI never leave reviews but I really was blown away by the service I received this morning. I just had Jeremy out to my house to clean three carpeted rooms and the tile of one bathroom. He was on time, very thorough, helpful, kind - all the things you want when having someone do work in your home! Will definitely have Peace Frog back again!\n\nElizabeth W.\n\n1681577009\n\nAwesome service\n\nRelated Services\n\nWhat Our Clients Say!\n\nI am so impressed with this LOCAL carpet cleaning company!
