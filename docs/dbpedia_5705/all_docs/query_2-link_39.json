I wonder is this the solution to my problem, I do know it won't allow frogs to burrow,however i can't give away this opportunity to better myself. and i believe the carpet have its adventage that any frog poop on the carpet it will make the poop easier to find(so hopefully it will my wife easier to do the daily spot clean), moreover i was told this carpet can keep moisture well and easy to clean.\n\nany advice on this guys?\n\ncheers.\n\nHi there\n\nReptile carpet isnt the best for pacman frogs because it can be abrasive to their skin\n\nand dosent hold humidity too well. Whenever you recieve information from pet store employees, always\n\ncheck it out online. A better alternative would be paper towel substrate but will need to be replaced\n\ndaily to prevent the growth of bacteria. Keep the cage between 70 and 80 degrees and feed every\n\ntwo days for smaller frogs and twice a week for larger adults, crickets are fine but are not the most\n\nnutritious so calcium powder can be dusted on the prey item, pink mice (newborn) are very fatty\n\nand should be fed sparsingly. Other people like Gifthegreat and lija are experts on this topic."
