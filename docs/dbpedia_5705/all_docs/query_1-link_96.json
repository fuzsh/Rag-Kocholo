And certain concerns I had about it and how to prevent some issues (namely hard water build up but enough about that.\n\nHere is more or less the setup I have now for Froggo.\n\nShe is a (AFAIK) southern leopard frog.\n\nThe only concern (and even then it's not the biggest deal) is any differing suggestions on substrate. Currently I have some experience terra 'jungle moss' in/under the log hide. I really like it because it allows her to dig herself in, but it can be a bit of a hassle to clean out of the water side. I didn't catch what species of moss it was, but I did see a decently sized wad of live moss for sale at Petco. It seems to hold together pretty well.\n\nIf there's no other workable solutions, I'm fine with what I have now. I do like the moss as it's easier for her to get out of her mouth if she accidentally grabs some with food. Again, it just tends to disintegrate rather quickly in the water so it's hard to pick out.\n\nEco carpet maybe once a month. I sectioned off the standard 20 gallon long size into three equal sections. Everytime I'd out new moss down I'd pop out the old carpet, get as much moss off as I could, spray it with the suggested cleaning spray (Wipe out? It's on the package of the eco-carpet) and let it sit to dry. After it was dried off I'd rinse it off in tap water, wring it out, and then rinsed it again in dechlorinated water, and wring it out again.\n\nThe new eco-carpet I'm using for the 40 gallon wasn't as good of a fit, but I found out she prefers to have access to the gravel as well and burrow into it. Well more make a frog sized depression, but she thinks she's being sneaky\n\nFor lighting she was under a daylight heat bulb and tropical uva (it came with the combo mini dome light kit I got when she just finished morphing from a tadpole, she seemed to do fine and I figured this kit was more appropriate than the desert heating kits. IIRC I since replaced the blue daylight with a basking bulb (had a freebee from a friend. She seems to prefer that.\n\nThe other side is a standard aquarium light for plants"
