        "text": "Michael Zweig has been writing and performing for more than 30 years. He got his start in the late 70�s playing guitar for such local legends as Ray Materick, Lisa Hartt, Peter Foldy, and Bob Segarini. In 1984 he signed to Ready Records under the name Michael Zee, and recorded his first record, an EP, called �Five-Seven, Maybe Five-Eight�, which spawned the mini-hit �I've Got News For You�.\n\nThroughout the rest of the 80�s, Zweig toured Ontario and Eastern Canada with The Knockouts. The Knockouts became Seventh Son, and released a self-titled album. This album contained two more mini-hits, \"She's Insane\", and �Going Downtown�. The band dissolved shortly after that.\n\nIn the 90�s, Zweig wrote, played, sang jingles, moved to L.A. and back, and finally started his own jingle company. The company has written and produced spots for Ford, GM, Sears, Adidas and many others. It is also responsible for the current Home Hardware and Ontario Place campaigns.\n\nIn 2000 he joined Toronto party band The Carpet Frogs, toured Canada with Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman (including Live 8), and played on their �Jukebox� CD. He also played with Tom Cochrane. He can sometimes be heard Saturday night on Hockey Night In Canada as the co-writer and performer of �The Place'll Be Rockin� �Cause It�s Saturday Night�."
