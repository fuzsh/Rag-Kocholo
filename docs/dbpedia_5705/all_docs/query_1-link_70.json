        "text": "Getting rid of bugs is important, but it’s not worth declaring nuclear warfare on your home. The pesticides we ship are fully registered, sourced from, and used by some of the best pest control companies in the world, and have been used in hospitals, schools, and more.\n\nAs with any pesticide application, certain safety measures need to be followed while applying. For example, pets and children should not come in contact with treated areas until the pesticide has fully dried. A complete set of safety measures and instructions are included with each shipment.\n\nWith Pestie, you get the same pest control that high-end pro pest control companies use, but since we skip the middlemen, salespeople, and applicators, you get it for a fraction of the price.\n\nWe partner with pest control manufacturers and experts to select and ship the highest quality, proven pesticides that are optimized for your specific location and the bugs in your area. View the specific details of the pesticides you'll get in your area and other details by visiting our buy page and clicking \"View included pesticides/tools\".\n\nYour shipment will usually rotate through different pesticides for higher efficacy and to prevent bugs from developing resistance to a specific pesticide.\n\nWe also have specialty treatments that we send to customers in certain situations that are optimized for certain pests or issues. Usually these are not necessary except with more severe issues.\n\nEvery pesticide/treatment that we send out has been thoroughly tested for safety and efficacy, and is usually the same or better than what your local professional pest control companies are using. Every shipment that we send out comes with the original EPA-approved label, full safety information, and application instructions.\n\nFor most of our customers, we recommend an outdoor barrier sprayed around the home. In most cases, this is extremely effective at getting rid of pests inside your home.\n\nIn rare cases where it's necessary to spray indoors as well, the pesticide can be applied using a light spray while taking additional precautions such as moving any human or pet food and waiting for the product to dry before any contact. Only a light spray is needed.\n\nBefore spraying indoors, you should read the included label for full safety information and instructions. If you have any questions about whether or not you should spray indoors, our team is available to help. Contact us at hello@pestie.com.\n\nWe’re so confident that you’re going to love Pestie that if you’re not completely satisfied with the results or the products we sell, we will do whatever it takes to make it right—send specialty treatments, personalized treatment plans, or a full refund. Just contact our support team and we'll get you taken care of.\n\nWith any pesticide, certain safety procedures need to be followed during application. Included with each shipment is the registered label and a full set of instructions on how to safely apply the pesticide. As outlined in the instructions, when applying you should take standard pesticide application precautions such as wearing gloves (included), wearing long sleeved shirts and pants, and wearing closed-toed shoes. Be sure to read and follow the included label for complete safety information."
