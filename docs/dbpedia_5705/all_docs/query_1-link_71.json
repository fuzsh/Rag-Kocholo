        "text": "Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame (CSHF) inductees Burton Cummings and Buffy Sainte-Marie were among those honoured at this year’s Juno Awards in Calgary.\n\nBuffy Sainte-Marie, who’s song ‘Universal Soldier’ was inducted into the CSHF in 2005, took home two JUNO’s for Aboriginal Album of the Year and Contemporary Roots Album of the Year for her fifteenth studio release, Power in the Blood. The Juno nod comes shortly after winning the 2015 Polaris Music Prize in September.\n\nAlso being honoured was 2005 CSHF inductee Burton Cummings who was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame (CMHF). Cummings was already a member of the CMHF through his band The Guess Who (inducted in 1987) and 2016 marked the singer-songwriter’s solo induction.\n\n“First and foremost, I share this and dedicate this to my hometown Winnipeg,” Cummings said to the crowd at the Junos. “I learned everything in Winnipeg that would equip me for what was going to happen. This really belongs in Winnipeg.”\n\nCummings’ participated in a series of tribute performances that also featured Jann Arden, Shawn Hook and the Tenors, which can be viewed below.\n\nBurton Cummings was also the first artist to place his plaque at the National Music Centre’s Studio Bell. The brand new state-of-the-art facility will be home to the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and is set to open to the public later this year.\n\nCongratulations to Buffy Sainte-Marie and Burton Cummings, and to all 2016 winners and nominees.
