        "text": "...that's the goal of Liner Notes - to offer a platform for the Canada's retro music makers to tell all of their story, no holds barred.\n\nLiner Notes is a dream come true for us. We're Heather Prescott and Lori Dean, co-founders of Dusty Discs Radio. The internet-based station is a non-sponsored, labour of love, showcasing music from the '60s-80's with a particular focus on Canadian music from those decades. We, as well as the listeners, grew up listening to these Canadian artists and wanted to know more about:\n\nhow they made the songs;\n\nthe highs (and lows) of their career;\n\nwhat they're up to now; and\n\nlife lessons learned along the way.\n\nHere's your 'fly on the wall' moment, a chance to catch revealing insights into the person behind the music in a casual, laid back manner. Also, the audio quality sometimes gets rough around the edges. Nothing over produced here. Just real, raw engaging talk.\n\nBy becoming a Liner Notes VIP member you will can help cover the costs of producing this podcast so we can continue providing an uncensored, laidback platform for all Canadian music makers to reveal their story, in their own way, just for you. You'll be able to download full, uninterrupted episodes and listen to them whenever and wherever.\n\nCheck below for the membership perks and sign-up details. Know that we're grateful to have you on board and we can't thank you enough."
