The Blue Line of the Namma Metro in Bangalore, India, is a proposed elevated metro route spanning 18.236 km from KR Puram to Central Silkboard.

Trains on the Blue Line will be stabled and maintained at the existing Baiyappanahalli Depot.

BMRCL plans to procure 120 coaches for the Blue Line, with trains operating in a six-coach formation. Due to the re-purposing of some of the Purple Line's stabling lines for the Blue Line, a new depot for the Purple Line will be constructed at Kadugodi near Hope Farm Junction, where government land is available.
