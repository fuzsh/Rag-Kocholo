Blue Line Metro Bangalore Map 2024

The Blue Line of the Namma Metro in Bangalore, India, is a proposed elevated metro route spanning 18.236 km from KR Puram to Central Silkboard. The line will include 13 stations including some of the prominent localities like HSR Layout, Bellandur, and Mahadevpura which not only hold significant roles in Bangalore's landscape but are also prized as elite residential areas. Trains on the Blue Line will be stabled and maintained at the existing Baiyappanahalli Depot.

BMRCL plans to procure 120 coaches for the Blue Line, with trains operating in a six-coach formation. Due to the re-purposing of some of the Purple Line's stabling lines for the Blue Line, a new depot for the Purple Line will be constructed at Kadugodi near Hope Farm Junction, where government land is available.
