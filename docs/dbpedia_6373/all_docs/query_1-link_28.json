Click Here\n\nCheck Out Some Properties In Bengaluru\n\nLatest Bengaluru Metro Updates\n\nJune 26, 2024: The opening of the extended Namma Metro Green Line in Bengaluru is delayed until September due to final testing. The 3.7km stretch from Nagasandra to Madavara will add 3 new stations and improve connectivity for areas like Madavara and Chikkabidarakallu. Residents are eager for the launch as it will cut down travel times compared to buses or cars, especially with heavy traffic on Tumakuru Road.\n\nNamma Metro construction at the Doddanekundi underground may resume after six months.\n\nApril 17, 2023: After an almost six-month pause, construction on the Namma Metro at the Doddanekundi underground is set to resume. This is a segment of the projected 19-kilometre-long Outer Ring Road line, which will run from Central Silk Board to KR Puram and is expected to open in 2025 or 2026. The ORR Metro impediment has been resolved, according to the now-disbanded Mahadevapura Mobility Task Force, which is led by MLA Aravind Limbavali.\n\nThe open web girder (equivalent to an overhead line for a Metro train) was allowed for a length of 65 metres across the Doddanekundi railway line, which is what is claimed to have caused the problem. However, the railways insisted on a length of 85 metres in order to support a fifth track in the future.\n\nThe Namma Metro Yellow Line in Bengaluru is scheduled to open in August 2023\n\nThe Bengaluru Metro Yellow line is slated to open in August 2023. The Bengaluru Metro Yellow Line is part of the Namma Metro Phase 2 project. This metro route will connect R V Road in the city's southern outskirts to Bommasandra in the city's southeastern outskirts.\n\nRagigudda, Kudlu Gate, Jayadeva Hospital, Bommanahalli, BTM Layout, Hongasandra, Central Silk Board, Singasandra, Hosa Road, Konappana Agrahara, Huskuru Road, Beratena Agrahara, Electronic City, Hebbagodi, and Bommasandra are among the 16 stations on the upcoming metro route.\n\nThe Bengaluru Metro Yellow line will begin at RV Road, which is also connected to the Bengaluru Metro Green line. At Jayadeva Hospital and Central Silk Board station, the future Bengaluru metro Yellow Line will intersect with the Pink and Blue Line metro lines.\n\nThe Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has confirmed that the Nagasandra-Madavara stretch is now 95% complete, with the remaining work expected to wrap up in the coming weeks.\n\nNamma Metro Green Line Stations\n\nThe Bengaluru Namma Metro Green line, which runs from Nagasandra in the northwest to Anjanapura in the southwest, opened in March 2014. The overall distance between these two locations is 30 kilometres, with 30 stations in between. The Green Line is elevated for four km and has three underground stations. The most recent addition was completed in January 2021, and it is now being extended another 33.5 kilometres to Madavara and Silk Institute in the south.\n\nStations On Namma Metro Green Line\n\nBengaluru Metro Green Line Stations\n\nMadavara\n\nChikkabidarakallu\n\nManjunathanagar\n\nNagasandra\n\nDasarahalli\n\nJalahalli\n\nPeenya Industry\n\nPeenya\n\nGoraguntepalya\n\nYeshwanthpur\n\nSandal Soap Factory\n\nMahalakshmi\n\nRajaji Nagar\n\nMahakavi Kuvempu Road\n\nSrirampura\n\nSampige Road\n\nNadaprabhu Kempegowda station, Majestic\n\nChickpete\n\nKrishna Rajendra Market\n\nNational College\n\nLalbagh Botanical Garden\n\nSouth End Circle\n\nJayanagar\n\nRashtreeya Vidyalaya Road\n\nBanashankari\n\nJaya Prakash Nagar\n\nYelachenahalli\n\nDoddakallasandra\n\nKonankunte Cross\n\nVajarahalli\n\nTalaghattapura\n\nSilk Institute\n\nBengaluru Metro Map: Green Line\n\nImage Source: Routemaps.info\n\nMetro Fares In Bengaluru\n\nImage Source: Wikipedia\n\nBengaluru metro rates are determined by the type of token used and the distance travelled. The fare often ranges between Rs 10-Rs 45. The fare system in the Bengaluru metro is separated into three categories:\n\nToken (Ticket)\n\nA token can be purchased for as little as Rs. 10 and as much as Rs. 50. This type of ticket is ideal for one-way trips on the Bengaluru metro.\n\nGroup Tickets\n\nA party of at least 25 people travelling together can purchase group tickets. However, everyone in the group should be going to the same place. A 10% reduction on the token fare is available.\n\nSmart Card\n\nA smart card is a card that can be recharged based on how much you use it. These cards cost Rs 50 and can be filled with up to Rs 3000. A metro rider receives 5% off any amount over the token value.\n\nBengaluru Metro Timings\n\nThe Bengaluru Metro service begins at 5:00 a.m. and ends at 10:35 p.m. Services begin at 6:00 a.m. and end at 10:35 p.m. on general holidays such as the second and fourth Saturdays. On Sunday, however, the first metro arrives at 7:00 a.m. and runs until 11:00 p.m.\n\nBengaluru Metro (Namma Metro) App\n\nImage Source: Google Play\n\nNamma Metro (BMRCL official app) is a smartphone application available on the Play Store that can assist passengers. You can use an app to examine a map, top up your smart card, check fare information or contact customer service for assistance.\n\nConclusion"
