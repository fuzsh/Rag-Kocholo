This 3-km extension, part of Phase II, adds new stations at Manjunathnagar, Chikkabidarakallu, and Madavara. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) will initiate trial runs soon, anticipating an influx of 25,000 to 30,000 additional riders. With construction at Madavara nearing completion and power supply checks underway, the extension aims to enhance access to the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre and streamline travel for passengers in surrounding areas.",
