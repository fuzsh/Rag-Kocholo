        "text": "Rithvik K Bhat\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nBootcamp\n\n·\n\n10 min read\n\n·\n\nDec 4, 2022\n\n--\n\nThis case study showcases the design decisions I took while redesigning the Namma Metro app, considering working professionals as the target demographic.\n\nAbout Bangalore’s Metro app\n\nThe Bangalore Metro has been a boon for many working professionals who get to work on time without delay due to traffic, bad weather or poor road conditions. It has also enabled people to switch to a more eco — friendly alternative.\n\nTo assist commuters, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) launched an app to provide a one-stop solution for recharging metro cards and accessing the route map, timings, and fares.\n\nSurveyed Commuters Don’t Use the Metro App\n\nTo find out if users liked the app, I sent a Google Form to people who board the metro to their workplace and enquired whether they used the metro app to recharge their cards and check the train schedule. None of the 10 responders had used the app.\n\nUser Interview: What could be the Problem?\n\nI interviewed two people to understand the problem.\n\nKey Insights from User 1:\n\nLimited functionality and clunky features within the app.\n\nUser forced to use another application to achieve their goal, which is time-consuming.\n\nIt would be better to know the time of each train based on the nearby metro station rather than a standard timetable. This would help the user to plan his trip accordingly.\n\nIntegration with Google Maps, station arrival alerts and last-mile connectivity services were all suggested as valuable additions.\n\nKey Insights from User 2:\n\nBad reviews on the Google Playstore kept this user from downloading it. Plus, iPhone users are left out because there’s no app for them.\n\nUsers need to wait for an hour to see the balance on their card if they had done it online.\n\nThe app missed crucial features that may have assisted users (like navigation, feeder services, recent activity, etc.).\n\nUser Reviews\n\nI browsed through reviews on the Play Store, App Store (the app is not available), Reddit discussions, Twitter threads, and news articles. I also did this to understand how commuters feel about the app.\n\nLearning from reviews:\n\nCommuters feel the app isn’t helpful, forcing them to rely on other, time-consuming apps.\n\nThey even use Google Maps despite its outdated train information.\n\nA single app for both iOS and Android is crucial.\n\nAdditionally, features need to be introduced or refined with functionalities that truly assist commuters.\n\nCompetitive analysis\n\nI downloaded metro apps of different cities to see what features they incorporated that made it better than the Bangalore Metro app.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nPassengers get station warnings, the quickest route indicator and less interchange travel right on the app.\n\nThe Delhi Metro app has a service alert feature that notifies users of the lines suspended due to maintenance or other unforeseen circumstances.\n\nLost and found items, feeder services, and parking facilities are present in the app.\n\nPassengers benefit from comprehensive end-to-end travel convenience.\n\nUser Personas: Catering to Local and Migrant Commuter Needs\n\nGoals of the app\n\nSimple and quick recharging of the metro card for busy commuters.\n\nProvide necessary information to help first-time commuters plan their trip.\n\nNew features that will make the whole traveling experience seamless.\n\nAssumptions\n\nUsers are familiar with most mobile applications and want a quick and easy-to-use interface.\n\nThe user’s goal is to make recharges, be notified of station arrival, and get convenient services when they board or get off the train.\n\nOptimizing User Journeys: The New Information Architecture for Bangalore Metro App\n\nExploring User Needs: Paper Wireframing for a User-friendly App Interface\n\nMy design approach included a lot of exploratory drawing before I started designing the app digitally. I was constantly reassessing what the user group would search for and how an interface must deliver timely prompts.\n\nI have also iterated several times based on the feedback I received from the users to come up with the final wireframe design.\n\nVisual Design\n\nBrand Identity\n\nWhy did I choose a different colour palette?\n\nOld Colours Led to Confusion: The previous app colors matched metro lines (green & purple), potentially confusing riders using both lines.\n\nFor example, the app’s header or button colour is green, a Purple Line passenger may feel he is boarding the Green Line and can make an incorrect booking decision.\n\nThis may not seem like a big deal, but if a commuter is in a hurry and needs to make a quick booking, this confusion can prove costly. So choosing a more accessible colour can help the passenger and avoid misunderstanding.\n\nNew Royal Blue Improves Clarity: The new Royal Blue aligns with station signage, enhancing clarity and avoiding booking errors.\n\nHome Page\n\nI designed the homepage to provide all the crucial features that a busy commuter would need and speed up the entire process.\n\nCommuters may use the app to get directions, recharge their metro cards, receive notifications and access different services directly from the homepage.\n\nThe image below explains the features added to the new app design.\n\nSearch flow\n\nSearching for routes between stations and navigating are the most frequently used features on any companion app.\n\nFor First-time travellers\n\nI ensured it would show all the relevant information about a specific metro station.\n\nThey can find restaurants, banks, and hospitals near the metro station.\n\nIs there a quicker way to search and navigate?\n\nThe app chooses the closest station for departure automatically. A user can modify the departure station by dragging the pin to the desired position.\n\nFor commuters who travel on the same route frequently, I have added shortcuts that will allow them to skip some steps mentioned above and go directly to the navigation screen.\n\nTo inform passengers when the train is reaching their destination, a new feature called “Station Arrival Alert” has been added. Passengers need not worry about missing their chosen station.\n\nFare Information and Maps\n\nThe earlier design only offered information on the fare between two stations. There was no information regarding the number of stations, time required, or the ability to navigate directly on the app.\n\nThe new app design has included all of these features.\n\nReason for using Google Maps API\n\nImplementing a navigation system that utilizes the Google Maps API simplifies user navigation within the app and eliminates the need for third-party apps to navigate and purchase tickets.\n\nI’m using the Google Maps API instead of the metro’s native map since people are more familiar with the Google Maps UI and it’s been the go-to navigation tool for many travellers. This is why apps like Ola, Uber, Swiggy, and Zomato use this API.\n\nPayment Page\n\nThe previous design had separate sections for making recharges, paying for QR tickets and purchasing travel passes.\n\nAll of them are now combined on a single page in the newer design.\n\nI designed the new payment page to make quicker recharges or purchasing of QR tickets/Travel Pass.\n\nDifferent Choices\n\nActivity\n\nCommuters can view the complete trip activity based on the metro card used. If they face any issue during a trip, they can resolve it with the services provided.\n\nProfile\n\nThe inability to unlink a metro card on the app was one of the primary issues users had. Therefore I included this feature in the updated design.\n\nI included the past activity section to make it easier for the passenger to select the card based on their recent activity and unlink it rather than relying just on the card number.\n\nLogin Page\n\nUsers can log in two ways, using their Truecaller ID or by providing their mobile number.\n\nWhat is the advantage of introducing Truecaller in the login page?\n\nUsers may log in with a single tap, eliminating the need to wait for an OTP and then enter it. In the earlier design, the user must wait 2 minutes for the OTP to arrive.\n\nAnother benefit is for BMRCL, who typically spends between 50 paise to 1 rupee for each SMS sent to users for OTP verification. Although it may seem like a tiny sum, with 5 lakh people using the metro every day, even if 10% of them use the app, it works out to be about ₹50,000 per day or ₹1.82 crores per year only for delivering OTPs by SMS. They can avoid such expenses using Truecaller.\n\nUsers can use the app without logging in\n\nA commuter who uses the app only for navigation, checking fares between two stations and viewing the train schedule has no reason to log in or register. It would only be required while buying a ticket, recharging a card or purchasing a travel pass.\n\nUser Testing\n\nI showed the app prototype to people who travel by metro and saw how they used it. I noticed a few issues and also obtained feedback from commuters.\n\n1) Selecting the Departure station is unclear\n\nMany users were unaware of dragging the pin to choose the departure station. As a result, I decided to keep things straightforward and altered the design, allowing users to set their departure based on a search or set their location on a map.\n\n2) An easier way to select between departure and destination stations\n\nA user provided some wonderful input. If they select any two stations on the map, it should auto-select the departure and destination stations and display the cost and journey time. I included this idea in my design.\n\n3) Additional features\n\nTrain Schedule: A few users wanted to know the train schedule to plan ahead of time. As a result, I’ve included a section on train time on the route information page.\n\nAudio script: There are station names which cannot be pronounced by everyone, so I have provided the option to hear the station name through audio.\n\nPrototype\n\nWrapping Up🎊\n\nLearning\n\nThis was my second UX Design project, and I can see how I’ve grown along the process by identifying problems, meeting people, learning about their concerns, and then finding solutions and designing iterations based on user testing and feedback.\n\nAs a frequent metro user, I have come to appreciate the importance of taking into account your environment while creating designs for people.\n\nThe most crucial lesson I learned while redesigning this app was that time is of the essence for every metro user, thus designing for speed and efficiency was crucial.\n\nFuture Enhancements\n\nAccommodate more metro lines that will soon be operational. It would be a fantastic idea to offer the option of picking a route with fewer stops or fewer interchanges because there will soon be a lot of interchanges.\n\nProviding more details and information regarding stations that can assist people with special needs.\n\nPassengers who require last mile connectivity would benefit greatly from the integration of BMTC bus schedule. Unfortunately, there are currently no such mechanisms in place.\n\nIncluding metro station floor plans/layouts can assist travellers in quickly locating exits, facilities, washrooms, and so on.\n\n🤝 If you have any questions, suggestions or opportunities to work together, please get in touch with me on LinkedIn or Email.
