Spanning 74 km and serving 66 stations, it offers a reliable and cost-effective alternative to the city’s congested road network. Currently in a phase of extensive expansion, the metro system is poised to expand further, with 102 km of new lines under construction and an additional 82 km set to commence soon.\n\nThe Yellow Line, connecting RV Road to Bommasandra, is nearing operational readiness pending the delivery and testing of new trains. Extensions such as the Green Line to Madavara, along with plans for the Pink and Blue Lines, signify progress towards the upcoming Phase 3 and 4 expansions. Achieving its first-ever profit in the fiscal year 2022-23, Bangalore Metro is committed to enhancing connectivity across the city and aims to boost non-fare revenue, aligning with the government’s ambitious PM Gati Shakti initiative for rapid infrastructure development.\n\nBengaluru Namma Metro Route Map 2024\n\nBangalore Metro, also known as Namma Metro, is Bengaluru’s premier Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS), comprising 2 lines and 51 stations. Phase 1 of Bangalore Metro, covering 42.30 km, commenced construction in April 2007. The Purple Line’s first section, from Baiyyappanahalli to MG Road, opened in 2011, and the final section was inaugurated by India’s President on June 17, 2017, with commercial operations starting the next day.\n\nPhase 2 of Bangalore Metro spans 73.921 km, with construction beginning in September 2015. Due to funding challenges, most civil construction contracts were awarded by mid-2017. The Green Line extension to Silk Institute commenced operations in January 2021, while the entire Phase 2, including a 13.9 km underground section of the Pink Line, is slated for completion by 2024, expanding the metro network to 116.25 km. Phase 3 of Bangalore Metro, proposing routes totaling 44.65 km, is awaiting approval from the Central Government’s cabinet. Initially, 105 km of routes were planned, with segments like the 18 km Central Silk Board to KR Puram and the 38 km KR Puram to KIAL Airport lines accelerated and being built concurrently under Phase 2A and Phase 2B alongside Phase 2.\n\nBengaluru Namma Metro Route Map Overview\n\nOperatorNamma Metro BangaloreOperation start20 October 2011Number of lines5 Metro LinesTrain length6 CoachesNo. of stations65 Active StationsCategoryTrendingMetro timings⏱ Starting | Ending\n\n05:00 AM | 11:00 PM\n\nCheck This:- Hyderabad Metro Route Map\n\nHistory Of Bengaluru Metro\n\nThe Bangalore Metro, known as Namma Metro, has emerged as a crucial solution to alleviate the city’s increasing traffic congestion and promote sustainable urban mobility.

The inaugural phase, the Purple Line from Baiyappanahalli to Mysuru Road, commenced operations in 2011 after overcoming significant planning and construction challenges. This launch marked a pivotal moment, offering commuters a reliable alternative amidst the city’s congested roads.\n\nSubsequent phases saw expansions such as the Green Line stretching from Nagasandra to Silk Institute, with ongoing plans for additional lines like Yellow, Blue, Pink, Orange, Grey, and Red. These extensions aim to connect diverse parts of Bangalore, underscoring the city’s rapid urbanization. The Bangalore Metro plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable urban growth by reducing travel times, mitigating pollution, and enhancing overall mobility.\n\nAs a symbol of Bangalore’s aspiration to modernize transport infrastructure, Namma Metro provides millions of residents with efficient and comfortable commuting options.
