The line will span 21.25 km, with 13.92 km underground and 6.98 km elevated sections, and will have a total of 18 stations.\n\nTunnelling works have been successfully completed, and the elevated stretch is nearing completion. Finishing works for the stations are ongoing, with track laying scheduled to begin in October 2023.\n\nThe Pink Line will have important interchanges with the Purple, Yellow, and Blue lines. The introduction of the Pink Line is expected to have a positive impact on the real estate sector, with increased demand and value appreciation for properties near metro stations. The project will improve transportation connectivity and reduce traffic congestion in Bengaluru.\n\nJuly 2023: The Bengaluru Metro Pink Line, spanning from Kalena Agrahara to Nagawara, faced delays in construction and missed the previous deadline of December 2024. BMRCL has set a deadline of March 2025 for the commencement of commercial operations on the Pink Line, spanning 21.3 km from Kalena Agrahara to Nagawara. The construction of a 13.8 km tunnel network from Dairy Circle to Nagawara is a crucial part of the Pink Line. The agency has completed almost 80% of the tunnel construction work. To undertake the challenging construction, nine tunnel-boring machines were deployed, and the tunnelling work for a 4.5 km stretch is nearing completion.\n\nSeptember 01, 2023: The Namma Metro's extensive underground section marked a significant achievement with the successful completion of tunnelling by the sixth Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), named Vamika.

This expansion project has been meticulously planned to cater to the rising transportation demands of the city's growing population.\n\nThe execution of the Namma Metro Pink Line is divided into two distinct phases. The first phase, covering a distance of 13.92 km, will include a well-balanced mix of six underground stations and six elevated stations. This phase is anticipated to be operational by December 2024, providing significant relief to commuters.\n\nThe second phase, spanning a distance of 6.98 km, includes an additional 0.48 km on the surface and features six elevated stations. In total, the Pink Line will comprise 18 stations, out of which 12 will be elevated and six will be underground, seamlessly connecting key areas and enhancing overall accessibility.\n\nOfficials have estimated that the completion of the Bengaluru Metro Pink Line will likely occur around 2026, marking a significant milestone in the city's transportation infrastructure. This eagerly awaited expansion is expected to not only improve connectivity but also offer a reliable and efficient mode of transportation to residents and visitors alike.\n\nAs an integral part of Bengaluru's urban development plan, the Pink Line will play a pivotal role in reducing congestion, enhancing the city's mobility, and fostering sustainable growth.\n\nThe introduction of the Namma Metro Pink Line is eagerly awaited by the residents and commuters of Bengaluru.\n\nThis ambitious expansion is set to revolutionise the city's transportation landscape, significantly reducing travel time, enhancing connectivity, and providing a sustainable mode of public transportation. It is expected to relieve the burden on road traffic, lessen pollution levels, and contribute to the overall development and growth of Bengaluru as a thriving metropolis.\n\nIn summary, the Namma Metro Pink Line project stands as a testament to Bengaluru's commitment to modernising its transportation infrastructure.\n\nOnce completed, it will not only alleviate traffic congestion but also serve as a catalyst for economic development, improved accessibility, and enhanced quality of life for the residents of Bengaluru.\n\nNamma Metro Pink Line: Status\n\nImage Source: iStock\n\nThe Namma Metro Pink Line in Bengaluru is currently undergoing construction, with significant progress being made on various fronts.
