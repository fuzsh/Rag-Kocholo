        "text": "According to a top official at Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), over 35 per cent of this cost (Rs 10,485 crore) will be borrowed from external sources. The remaining funds will be contributed by the state and union governments through equity, land acquisition and GST reimbursement. Land acquisition, estimated at about Rs 5,000 crore, will be funded by the state government.\n\n“The state will review the DPR and suggest changes, if necessary. We will then revise the DPR accordingly and resubmit it to the government. After the state cabinet approval, it will be sent to the union government, which could take up to a year to approve,” the official told DH.\n\nThe Centre may ask for changing the alignment and reducing the cost. If so, the DPR will be modified and resubmitted for approval. The project deadline is five years from the date of the Centre’s approval, the official said.\n\nPhase 3A will connect Sarjapur in southeastern Bengaluru to Hebbal in the north via Koramangala, Wilson Garden and KR Circle. The DPR has reduced the underground section from 17 km to 14.44 km, costing about Rs 1,000 crore per km. The elevated section will be 22.15 km, up from 19 km. Of the total 29 stations, 11 will be built underground, and there will be five interchange stations (Iblur, Agara, Dairy Circle, KR Circle and Hebbal).\n\nIn May, Namma Metro’s average daily ridership hit an all-time record of 7,18,170, with 2,22,63,299 passengers travelling by train, generating Rs 58.13 crore in revenue. The highest ridership was on May 27 (7,86,208), and the highest revenue was on May 6 (Rs 2.15 crore)."
