The operator of this system is Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL). This system moves daily over 50 thousand passengers (2015), a relatively low utilization, considering that in the Bangalore metropolitan area has 5.7 million inhabitants.\n\nThere are plans to expand this system, and probably this year (2015) to open other 41 stations, which will put an end to Phase I. Phase II can be completed by 2019, leaving the system with 4 lines and 102 stations and 115 line kilometers.\n\nThe project is managed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) since the beginning of the 2000s. The system would be completed in 2 phases. In phase 1, 2 lines, the purple line and the green line, which would intersect perpendicularly would be built. At the end of this phase the system would be 33 kms long and would serve 32 stations. The line that would circulate in the horizontal axis through the city from east to west would have 18 kilometers long. The vertical axis, from north to south, would stretch 15 kilometers. 9 kilometers would circulate underground through the center of the city and the rest by elevated viaducts.\n\nThe second phase of Namma Metro will add 72.1 kms of tracks and 61 stations (13 kms would circulate underground and the rest in elevated viaducts).
