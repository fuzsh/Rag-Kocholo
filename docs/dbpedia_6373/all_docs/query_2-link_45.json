        "text": "The Bengaluru Metro or Namma Metro will be expanded to Tumakuru and Devanahalli covering approximately 15 km in north Bengaluru. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said in his Budget 2024-25 speech on Friday.\n\nBengaluru Namma Metro: The metro rail service is definitely helping in reducing traffic jams an increasing number of people opt for it in their daily commute. More than eight lakh people use these metro services daily. Considering this, an additional 44 km of metro lines will be added to the existing 74 km route. The Karnataka Budget for the financial year 2024-25 has outlined plans to expand the Namma Metro. The state government has decided to expand the metro route to Tumakuru and Devanahalli covering approximately 15 km in north Bengaluru.\n\n“The feasibility report for extending the metro rail from Bangalore International Exhibition Centre to Tumakuru and from Kempegowda International Airport to Devanahalli on a Public-Private Partnership basis will be prepared,” Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said in his Budget speech on Friday.\n\nBengaluru: New Electric Buses\n\nThe Karnataka Chief Minister also announced that the BMTC will add as many as 1,334 new electric buses and 820 BS-6 diesel buses to its fleet in the coming months.\n\nBengaluru: Rail Project\n\nTalking about the Bengaluru suburban rail project, he said with the rapid implementation of civil works for Corridor-2, stretching from Baiyappanahalli to Chikkabanavara will be completed soon.\n\n“Integrating various modes of public transport in Bengaluru, such as Metro, suburban rail along with BMTC will help in promoting public transport on a large scale. Our priority is to promote public transport. This will help in reducing traffic congestion and environmental pollution and will improve the standard of life of people in Bengaluru,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.\n\nReacting on the announcements Srinivas Alavilli, Fellow, WRI India stated that public transport in the city got a boost in the budget with new buses, metro and suburban train timelines.\n\n“Focus on Climate Action is appreciated as transport contributes significantly to air pollution; unless we act now, we will head in the direction of Delhi and Mumbai. 2023 has been a good year for public transport and with Metro to Electronic City and new buses, 2024 looks promising,” he added.\n\n“This budget lacks significant measures for addressing transport-related issues, with particular neglect of non-motorised transport. Moreover, it predominantly focuses on high-cost projects without sufficient attention]n to essential aspects,” said Vinay Srinivas, member of the Bangalore Bus Prayanikara Vedike.\n\n“Proposing a metro to Tumakuru seems impractical. Instead, the government should prioritise the development of suburban railways to interconnect nearby cities, as the metro is Bengaluru-centric,” he added."
