        "text": "Team-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2009\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 8,898\n\nThanked: 12,940 Times\n\nre: The Bangalore Metro rail (BMRCL) thread!\n\nJumped onto the Metro today for a little joy-ride. A few points on this:\n\n- It's a bit slower than I expected. There was a lot of talk about getting to Bypanahalli from MG Road in 8-12 minutes or something like that. the entire journey for me, right from getting into the station at Bypanahalli, into the train, and then getting off at MG Road took about 30 minutes or so.\n\n- You can't keep the tokens that you get. You have to hand them back. I would have liked to keep it! And I personally know several others who would. But I guess it makes no difference, really.\n\n- The pillars and the entire structure, actually, still wears that raw cement look. Something must be done about it, because it looks aesthetically hideous. Don't tell me it can't be done. The Airport-Road/Domlur flyover has a nice coat of two-tone paint that helps it blend with the surroundings nicely! Again, this probably makes no difference, but it's just an observation.\n\n- The train itself is quite narrow actually. Feels narrower than BMTC buses (or should we say, BTS buses?) of yore.\n\nLast edited by suhaas307 : 26th October 2011 at 17:22.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2005\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 222\n\nThanked: 64 Times\n\nre: The Bangalore Metro rail (BMRCL) thread!\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by WindRide\n\n...Hence the gap between carriage and platform i mentioned earlier is of grave concern.\n\nLast evening, our neighbours and we took the Metro to M G Road to our club. We wanted to avoid driving back from the club. My neighbour is from Delhi and he observed and pointed out the same thing - he says Delhi Metro has no gap between the coach and the platform.\n\nI'm sure there must be some reason why there is a gap, perhaps in future coaches will be wider?\n\nOur experience was overall a positive one.\n\nThere was a big crowd at Byappanahalli but there was no hold up anywhere. I already had my card which I had bought via the website, but my friend was able to buy their cards (two), and I topped my card for another Rs. 200, all within 5 minutes. This was in spite of the rush, so that's good management.\n\nAll direction boards were clear so there was no confusion.\n\nOn the two sharp curves at Byappanahalli and SV Road, I could hear and feel the wheels on the tracks, this disappeared when the track was straight.\n\nIt seemed the a/c was either off or improperly set, it was pretty warm inside. It was lot cooler at M G Road when we alighted.\n\nGetting off at M G Road, the police have made a pedestrian crossing, so crossover was smooth, but it is imperative that the Plaza station gets operational soon, the traffic on M G Road is seriously affected.\n\nPersonally we benefit enormously because we live just 5 minutes walk from the rear of Byappanahalli station, but definitely it will have wider impact when the Phase 1 is complete.\n\nOverall, we were very happy. Very proud of \"Namma Metro\"!\n\nEDIT: We thought the Metro would be running till 11 pm so we left our club at 10 pm and received an unpleasant surprise - the service was only till 10 pm! We had to then get to begging auto drivers to take us home!\n\nI hope the BMRCL extends the service at least till 11 pm, I for one don't mind paying a premium after 10 pm. BMRCL can charge 25% more for 10 pm to 12 midnight.\n\nLast edited by .anshuman : 28th October 2011 at 14:17. Reason: Smiley removed on request.

Observations:\n\n1. Far less stressful than using the bike or car. I'm in a much better mood when I get to work and when I get back home. We avoided the city center on weekends for years because of the traffic and the lack of parking, but that's changed thanks to the Metro. Rediscovering bookstores, restaurants, and pubs on MG Road!\n\n2. The Feeder Bus from MG Road is the only weak link. 3 days, the same feeder bus number went on 3 different routes! But there are indications that it will improve. No problem with Feeder buses to/from the Byapanahalli station.\n\n3. Hardly any crowd on non-holidays. Quite a rush on the weekend and on the Deepavali holiday, especially at the MG Road station. That should disappear once the \"novelty\" value wears off. If you are using the Metro over the weekend, head to MG Road early and start back only after 9 PM (and of course before 10, when the Metro service stops for the day).\n\n4. Pedestrian over bridges are a must for each station. There is provision for them, just need to be completed.\n\n5. A few posts expressed concern over the gap between the coach and the platform. I don't see it as much of a concern, hardly notice it when stepping into the train. But I guess it may be something to be aware of when traveling with young children.\n\nSo, assuming you can use the Byapanahalli-MG Road Phase I of the Metro, in my opinion:\n\na. The Metro is for you now if you are just waiting for an alternative that allows you to avoid the absolute mess that Bangalore traffic has become, can spare some extra time for the daily commute, and don't mind walking a bit to/from the bus stops and within the terminals.\n\nb. Wait a bit till the last-mile-connectivity aspect improves if being at a destination at a particular time each day is an absolute must.\n\nTeam-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2009\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 8,898\n\nThanked: 12,940 Times\n\nre: The Bangalore Metro rail (BMRCL) thread!\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Damu\n\nEDIT: We thought the Metro would be running till 11 pm so we left our club at 10 pm and received an unpleasant surprise - the service was only till 10 pm!

BMRCL can charge 25% more for 10 pm to 12 midnight.\n\nThat's odd!\n\nI stay about 2 minutes from the Metro station on CMH Road, and I get to see the train whiz past us from my terrace, and I could have sworn I saw it go by, not once or twice, but several, several times, even after 12 am. Test runs, probably? Or they might have forgotten to turn it off.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by am1m\n\n4. Pedestrian over bridges are a must for each station.

Unfortunately, there seems to be some dispute regarding the property that once used to be the Plaza Theatre.\n\nLast edited by suhaas307 : 12th November 2011 at 11:00.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2005\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 222\n\nThanked: 64 Times\n\nre: The Bangalore Metro rail (BMRCL) thread!\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by suhaas307\n\n..I get to see the train whiz past us from my terrace, and I could have sworn I saw it go by, not once or twice, but several, several times, even after 12 am. Test runs, probably? Or they might have forgotten to turn it off.\n\nIf they have extended the timings that's really good news. It will increase the value of the service. Since the M G Road/Brigade Road area has so many popular pubs and restaurants, at least those people bound towards East can use the Metro instead of their vehicles.\n\nIncidentally, I too live just a short walk away from the rear entrance of Byapannahalli Metro and from my bedroom window I can see the roof of the Metro shed. Every night I hear the unique \"toot toot\" of the Metro cars as they are parked (I think) for the night. This used to happen around 2215 hrs, but of late I have been hearing this after 2300 hrs so you could be right. I hope so!\n\nAs I had mentioned earlier, charging 25% more after 10 pm would be acceptable to all I'm sure.\n\nLast edited by Damu : 13th November 2011 at 11:49. Reason: added a line"
