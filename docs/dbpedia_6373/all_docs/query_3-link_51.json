        "text": "The Bangalore Metro Rail Network Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has announced record operational profits for the second consecutive financial year, touching Rs 129.3 crore for the fiscal year 2023-2024.\n\nCurrently, the city metro stands as India’s second longest operational metro network, spanning 73.81 kilometres, following the Delhi Metro.\n\nTwo operational corridors serve the city. The East-West Corridor stretches 43.49 kilometres, running from Whitefield Station in the east to Challagatta Terminal in the west.\n\nThe North-South Corridor covers 30.32 kilometres, with Nagasandra Station marking its northernmost point and Silk Institute Station situated at its southern end.\n\nA senior BMRCL official stated, “Our revenues have met our expectations, with income from fares reaching Rs 735.48 crore and expenditure standing at Rs 606.18 crore, resulting in an operational surplus.”\n\nThe introduction of new metro lines has significantly contributed to increased ridership. The crucial link between KR Pura and Baiyappanahalli stations, as well as the extension to Challaghatta on the Purple Line launched on 9 October 2023, has played a pivotal role in achieving this operational surplus.\n\nComparatively, the fiscal year 2022-2023 recorded a ridership of 17.72 crore and an operational surplus of Rs 108 crore, with income from fares at Rs 594.01 crore.\n\n“This growth is commendable, especially when compared to the previous fiscal of 2021-2022, where our revenue was Rs 228.76 crore, expenditure was Rs 345.6 crore, resulting in a loss of Rs 118 crore. The trend towards self-sufficiency in operations is promising for BMRCL,” the official added, reports The New Indian Express.\n\nB L Yashavanth Chavan, chief public relations officer at BMRCL, revealed that the average daily ridership for the past financial year was 6.36 lakh.\n\nHe also highlighted the impact of the new connectivity to K R Pura, noting that the average daily boarding figure from Baiyappanahalli to Whitefield (Kadugodi) was 1.05 lakh, indicating Baiyappanahalli is no longer the primary hub for passengers.\n\nNadaprabhu Kempegowda Interchange station remains the busiest, followed by Benniganahalli. Indira Nagar and Nagasandra jointly occupy the third position in terms of footfalls.\n\nIn a notable development, BMRCL is nearing the 8 lakh per day ridership mark, achieving this milestone twice recently."
