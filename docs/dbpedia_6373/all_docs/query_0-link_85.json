        "text": "Namma Metro, Bengaluru's metro rail system, recorded its highest-ever daily ridership on Monday, 15 April, with over 7,92,000 passengers using the network. This surpasses the previous record of 7,80,000 passengers set in January.\n\nCurrently, the city metro stands as Indiaâ€™s second longest operational metro network, spanning 73.81 kilometres, following the Delhi Metro.\n\nTwo operational corridors serve the city. The East-West Corridor stretches 43.49 kilometres, running from Whitefield Station in the east to Challagatta Terminal in the west.\n\nThe North-South Corridor covers 30.32 kilometres, with Nagasandra Station marking its northernmost point and Silk Institute Station situated at its southern end.\n\nOfficials with the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) believe ridership could soon breach the 800,000 mark. BMRCL Executive Director (Operations and Maintenance) A S Shankar attributes the surge to several factors, reports Economic Times.\n\n\"Mondays typically see higher ridership as people returning from weekend trips utilise the metro to reach various destinations within the city,\" Shankar explained. \"Additionally, the rise in office workers returning to in-person work is contributing to the record numbers.\"\n\nThe recent implementation of 5 am services from the Majestic interchange station in all four directions has also been well-received by commuters, according to Shankar. This extended service appears to be catering to those with earlier work schedules."
