Click Here!\n\nCheck Out Some Properties In Bengaluru\n\nRecent News On The Namma Metro Yellow Line\n\nJuly 19, 2024: Namma Metro Yellow Line is set to open by December 2024, offering faster commutes and easing traffic congestion. The 19km line, connecting RV Road to Bommasandra, will have 16 stations and is expected to run at least 8 trains every 15 minutes. Trial runs on the Yellow Line began in June 2024 with a prototype train to test oscillation and safety aspects, expected to be completed by September or October. While initial delays due to COVID and train deliveries pushed back the launch, the BMRCL is now on track to meet its revised deadline, bringing much-needed relief to Bengaluru commuters.\n\nMarch 08, 2024: Bengaluru's Namma Metro Yellow Line launch is delayed until year-end to prioritise testing and approvals. Trial runs with a driverless train have commenced, connecting key areas between RV Road and Bommasandra. Passengers will have to wait for at least 7 trains and regulatory clearances before regular service starts. The wait brings advanced features like collision-preventing communication and AI track monitoring for a safer and more efficient metro experience. Once operational, trains on the Yellow Line will initially operate at 15-minute intervals. This frequency has the potential to decrease to as low as five minutes once additional trains arrive next year.\n\nMay 2023: Construction on the Namma Metro Yellow Line started in 2017 and is still going strong. Its opening will mark a crucial turning point in Bengaluru's public transport system's development. The line will speed up and simplify commutes for thousands of people. It will speed up transport between the city's eastern and western regions.\n\nA 19.14 km elevated route will connect RV Road and Bommasandra as part of the yellow line route of the Bengaluru metro. There will be 16 metro stations in all.\n\nInitially, the train's launch was divided into two phases. The first phase, from Bommasandra to Central Silk Board, was originally scheduled to commence operations in June. Subsequently, the second phase, connecting Central Silk Board to RV Road, was slated to begin by December 2023.\n\nHowever, Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has announced that the Yellow Line of Bengaluru Metro will commence operations in December.\n\nThe Yellow Line traverses through densely populated areas such as BTM Layout, Bommanahalli, Central Silk Board, and Electronics City, offering a solution to alleviate traffic congestion.\n\nNotably, the route will feature Bengaluru's first double-decker flyover, spanning 3.3 km from Ragigudda to Silk Board Junction, enhancing connectivity and convenience for commuters.\n\nAdvancements In Namma Metro Yellow Line\n\nImage Source: Freepik\n\nThe creation of a new depot at Kadugodi is one of the important developments in the advancement of the Namma yellow line metro. This depot is made to offer storage and repair facilities for the trains that go along the line. 50 trains can fit in the depot, which should be enough for any upcoming growth plans.\n\nIn addition to these changes, a number of additional actions have been done to enhance the general riding experience on Namma Metro Yellow Line. Among these include the introduction of new trains with upgraded features like CCTV cameras and digital displays, as well as the installation of automated fare collection systems to simplify ticketing.\n\nImage Source: Freepik\n\nLatest Updates On Namma Metro\n\nKR Puram Metro Station To Get Foot Over-Bridge\n\nThe building foot over-bridge (FOB) between KR Puram railway station and Metro station is now underway following the long-standing dispute between SWR and BMRCL on land acquisition criteria. Finally, the South Western Train (SWR) has consented to provide BMRCL with 3,600 sqm of land close to platform No. 4 of the train station.\n\nThe FOB will be built in three stages: first, it will link the Purple Line station and the other side of the street; second, it will link the Blue Line station and the other side of the street; and third, it will link the platform of the refurbished KR Puram railway station with all of the Namma metro stations.\n\nLaunch Of One Nation-One Card And QR Code Ticketing By Namma Metro\n\nThe National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) and ticketing based on QR codes will soon be used by commuters. Every station of the Phase 1 Metro has at least one Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) gate installed by the BMRCL.\n\nThe new AFC gate is equipped to receive open-loop NCMC and QR-code. The NCMC and QR-code-compliant AFC gates are already present in the Phase 2 Metro stations. Passengers will be able to purchase tickets using a smartphone app and pick up paper tickets at ticket booths thanks to the QR-code-based ticketing system.\n\nOnce in operation, the new system will do away with the need for tokens or smart cards. Open loop cards, which are accepted everywhere, can be used to pay for parking and for shopping. It is integrated with BMTC, cars, and taxis, among other modes of transportation.\n\nGovernment Funding For Namma Metro Yellow Line\n\nImage Source: Freepik\n\nThe Central and State Governments would contribute roughly Rs. 15,000 crores to Namma Metro Phase 2. The cost of the project will be split by the State and Central Governments at 30% and 20%, respectively. Senior-term loans will be used to obtain the balance. Loans may be used by BMRCL to raise up to 9,000 crores.\n\nThe construction of the Hebbagodi and Konappana Agrahara (now known as \"Infosys Foundation Konappana Agrahara\") metro stations on the Yellow Line was announced to receive funding from a pharmaceutical and an IT company, respectively. Each company will give the project 100 crores (US$13 million).\n\nTicket Prices To Travel In Namma Metro Line\n\nImage Source: Freepik\n\nAll commuters will find the Namma Yellow line metro to be both economical and practical thanks to its fare system that is dependent on the distance covered. The line's minimum fare, which covers up to a 2 km travel, is Rs. 10. The maximum fee is Rs. 60, which is good for travel beyond 24 kilometres.\n\nPassengers have the option to use either smart cards or tokens to purchase tickets at the stations. Smart cards provide the advantage of discounted fares and can be conveniently recharged online or at the stations.\n\nRegular commuters particularly find smart cards beneficial as they can easily recharge them and the fare is automatically deducted when the card is scanned at the entry and exit gates.\n\nThis system offers a seamless and efficient experience for passengers, eliminating the need for manual ticket purchases and allowing for hassle-free travel on the metro.\n\nNamma Metro Yellow Line: Connectivity And Station Names\n\nImage Source: Freepik\n\nIn the near future, the Namma Yellow line metro will facilitate the connection between the eastern and western parts of the city, offering convenient transportation options. This line will link prominent destinations such as Indiranagar, M.G. Road, Vidhana Soudha, and Majestic, enhancing accessibility for commuters.\n\nThe strategically located metro stations will be in proximity to numerous bus and train stops, enabling seamless transfers and providing easy access to different parts of the city.\n\nThis integration of metro, bus, and train services will contribute to a well-connected public transportation system, making travel within Bengaluru more efficient and convenient for residents and visitors alike.\n\nBelow are the station names for Namma yellow line metro\n\nStation Name\n\nRashtreeya Vidyalaya Road (RV Road)\n\nRagigudda\n\nJayadeva Hospital\n\nBTM Layout\n\nCentral Silkboard\n\nBommanahalli (formerly HSR Layout)\n\nHongasandra (formerly Oxford College)\n\nKudlu Gate (formerly Muneshwara Nagar)\n\nSingasandra (formerly Chikkabegur)\n\nHosa Road (formerly Basapura Road)\n\nBeratena Agrahara (formerly Hosa Road)\n\nElectronic City\n\nInfosys Foundation Konappana Agrahara (formerly Electronic City – II)\n\nHuskur Road\n\nHebbagodi (Hebbagodi Depot of 39.3 acres)\n\nBommasandra\n\nEstimated Timings Namma Metro Yellow Line\n\nImage Source: Freepik\n\nThe daily hours of operation for the Namma Metro Yellow Line will be 5:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Train frequencies will differ between peak and off-peak times.
