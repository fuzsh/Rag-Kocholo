        "text": "Latest News On Namma Metro Pink Line\n\nJune 2023: Pink Line Metro To Commence Operations In December 2024\n\nThe construction of Bengaluru’s Pink Line Metro, connecting Nagawara and Kalena Agrahara, is progressing well and is expected to be completed before the December 2024 deadline. The line will span 21.25 km, with 13.92 km underground and 6.98 km elevated sections, and will have a total of 18 stations.\n\nCompletion of Purple Metro Line Boosts Real Estate\n\nResidential prices have increased by around 13 per cent in certain areas It is a well-established fact that the development of transport infrastructure boosts the real estate market of surrounding areas. And by boosts, we not just mean in terms of price appreciation, but also in terms of increasing the number of available homes and offices….\n\nTunnelling works have been successfully completed, and the elevated stretch is nearing completion. Finishing works for the stations are ongoing, with track laying scheduled to begin in October 2023.\n\nThe Pink Line will have important interchanges with the Purple, Yellow, and Blue lines. The introduction of the Pink Line is expected to have a positive impact on the real estate sector, with increased demand and value appreciation for properties near metro stations. The project will improve transportation connectivity and reduce traffic congestion in Bengaluru.\n\nJuly 2023: The Bengaluru Metro Pink Line, spanning from Kalena Agrahara to Nagawara, faced delays in construction and missed the previous deadline of December 2024. BMRCL has set a deadline of March 2025 for the commencement of commercial operations on the Pink Line, spanning 21.3 km from Kalena Agrahara to Nagawara. The construction of a 13.8 km tunnel network from Dairy Circle to Nagawara is a crucial part of the Pink Line. The agency has completed almost 80% of the tunnel construction work. To undertake the challenging construction, nine tunnel-boring machines were deployed, and the tunnelling work for a 4.5 km stretch is nearing completion.\n\nSeptember 01, 2023: The Namma Metro’s extensive underground section marked a significant achievement with the successful completion of tunnelling by the sixth Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), named Vamika. The tunnelling process is now 84% complete. The TBM finished its task, connecting Lakkasandra and Langford Town stations, in just 132 days, significantly ahead of the expected October timeline. With Vamika’s completion, only one TBM, Rudra, remains engaged in tunnelling for the Lakkasandra-Langford Town section, with a breakthrough anticipated in December. In total, the six TBMs have tunnelled 17.62 kilometres out of the overall 20.991 kilometres, with hopes to finish the remaining tunnelling by the end of the year, although the deadline might be ambitious given the pace of progress.\n\nDecember 08, 2023: Bengaluru’s Pink Line metro project has achieved a notable milestone, with 90% of the tunnelling work completed from Dairy Circle to Nagawara. The breakthrough at Kadugondanahalli (KG Halli) station by the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) Tunga signifies the completion of 1,184.4 metres, contributing to the overall advancement of 18,832.3 metres out of the total 20,992 metres on the Pink Line. Despite challenges like hard rock terrain, the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) remains on track to finish the Pink Line by March 2025, utilising nine TBMs. The project’s progress sets the stage for subsequent civil works, showcasing Bengaluru’s commitment to infrastructural development and improved connectivity within India’s fastest-growing major economy.\n\nApril 10, 2024: Tunneling for Bangalore’s Namma Metro Pink Line is nearly finished, with 94 per cent of the final phase complete. Two tunnel boring machines are expected to wrap up their sections by August, paving the way for track installation, station construction and other works. The Pink Line, a mix of underground and elevated sections, is expected to open by the end of 2025 and significantly improve Bengaluru’s public transport network.\n\nNamma Metro Pink Line"
