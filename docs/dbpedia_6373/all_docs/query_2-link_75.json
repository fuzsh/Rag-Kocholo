        "text": "The Centre last week informed Parliament that it has received a proposal from Karnataka Government for implementation of Phase-III of the Namma Metro Project.\n\nReplying to Bengaluru Central Lok Sabha member P C Mohan's question, Union Minister of State for Housing And Urban Affairs Kaushal Kishore said that the 44.65-km-long Phase-III will have two corridors.\n\nThe 32.15-Km Corridor 1 with 22 stations will extend the Metro line from Kempapura to JP Nagar Phase IV. Once this corridor is complete, Bengaluru will have a circular metro on the Outer Ring Road (ORR).\n\nThe Corridor 2 from Hosahalli to Kadabagere along Magadi Road will have a length of 12.5 km with nine stations.\n\nFor the Corridor 1, stations are planned at JP Nagar (IV, V phases), Kamakhya bus depot, PES Institute of Technology, Nagarbhavi Circle, Sumanahalli Cross, Hosakerehalli Cross, Kanteerava Studio, Peenya, BEL Circle, Mysuru Road, and Hebbal.\n\nFor the Corridor 2, Stations are likely to come at Hosahalli, Sumanahalli Cross, Herohalli, Vinayak Nagar, Byadarahalli, Sunkadakatte, and Kadabagere on the Magadi Road section.\n\nPhase III of the Namma Metro project has already received the State government’s in-principal approval in November 2022.\n\nThe State government has requested the Union government to sanction the proposal for implementing the project.\n\n16,000 Crore Project\n\nThe project, estimated to cost Rs 16,368 crore, is scheduled to take five years to complete from the date of the Centre’s approval.\n\nWhile 40 per cent of the cost would be split equally between the Union government and the State government, the remaining 60 per cent will be raised through debt.\n\nThe Centre is likely to provide additional funds under the PM Gati-Shakti scheme to fast-track transport infrastructure projects.\n\nBengaluru Metro, christened as \"Namma Metro\", is an urban Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) with two lines and 51 stations serving Bengaluru, Karnataka’s capital and largest city.\n\nThe project is being implemented by Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) which is a joint venture of Government of India and Government of Karnataka."
