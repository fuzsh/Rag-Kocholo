        "text": "The Bengaluru Metro, also called Namma Metro, now runs through most of the city and will soon be extended to the IT city's outskirts to help people get around. When the Bengaluru Metro opened, it was the first underground metro system in south India. It has underground metro stations on the ground and up high. The Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) is in charge of building, running, and expanding Bengaluru's metro system. It is a project of both the Indian government and the government of Karnataka. The Purple Line of Namma Metro runs through the Baiyappanahalli Metro Station.\n\nThe Karnataka government recently gave the Bangalore Metro project phase 3 an \"in-principle\" green light. The new metro line in Bangalore will be 32.16 km long and is expected to cost Rs 16,368 crore to finish. The center will give money to the project, and the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited will get loans to pay for it (BMRCL). The chief minister of Karnataka, Basavaraj Bommai, said that the Bangalore Metro would start running to the Kempegowda International Airport by the end of 2023. The Metro Phase 2B project will build the 39-km-long corridor that starts at Krishnarajapura (KR Puram) and goes to the airport. Before reaching the airport, the route will follow the northern part of the Outer Ring Road (ORR) through Nagawara, Hebbal, and Jakkur.\n\nThe first metro line that goes to Varthur Road is the PURPLE LINE. Since the feasibility study for Namma Metro Phase 3 was made public, people have started asking for certain areas to be included in the planned project. Some people have even started a petition to ask for the metro to go from Marathahalli Bridge to Varthur Road and further since this would help take pressure off the roads. Recently, the area between Varthur and Gunjur has become a popular place to live. By the time phase 3 starts, the amount of traffic on this stretch will have increased by a lot, and the only ways out will be Varthur road and Panathur road. A metro line along this stretch of Varthur Road will help many people and take many cars off the road. Most people take the Varthur Road, which makes traffic jams that can last for hours. Even traveling half a kilometer sometimes takes one hour.\n\nIn 2016, RITES and BMRCL studied the project's pre-feasibility and techno-economic feasibility. In February 2018, the state government of Karnataka permitted the project's detailed report (DPR) to be written. In July 2020, RITES was given the job of writing the DPR. The first draught should be ready by the middle of 2023. Phase 3 construction is expected to start in 2025 and end in the middle of the 1930s. By the time construction starts, the project's scope and alignment will likely change more than once. The feasibility study for Metro phase 3 is being done by RITES, which has confirmed that the study is going on. Metro on the ORR (SilkBoard to KR Puram) and Varthur stretch would allow many East Bengalureans to stop driving to work or school daily. This petition asks the right people to tell RITES to do a feasibility study on this route and to make the metro route longer.\n\nNew subway lines:\n\nLines that already exist will be made longer (23 km). The route of the airport line was decided in May 2017. It will go from RK Hegde Nagar to Jakkur to Yelahanka. In 2018, it was decided to be built as an extension of the SilkboardâKR Puram line as part of Phase 2B.\n\nAlso, here are some other ideas that could be on the table:\n\nHebbal Magadi Road Toll Gate - Kadabagere Gottigere - Basavapura RK Hegde Nagar to Aerospace Park Kogilu Cross - Rajanukunte Bommasandra to Attibele Iblur to Carmelaram."
