        "text": "Bengalureans rejoiced at the opening of two small metro sections on Monday. The years-long wait seemed to have been worth it. Of the two, the 2.1-km-long Baiyappanahalli-KR Pura section is critical because it connects the tech hub of Whitefield to the rest of the city.\n\nNamma Metro reported a decent uptick in its ridership with trains ferrying 5.86 lakh passengers between 5 am and 8 pm. The numbers will rise further as metro trains run until nearly midnight. For context, the metro’s average daily ridership is 6.5 lakh.\n\nMetro operations had a positive impact on the traffic situation, too. Traffic police reported a drastic reduction in congestion during the morning rush hours, especially between Tin Factory (Benniganahalli) and Whitefield, at Hoodi Junction and outside the Baiyappanahalli metro station.\n\nPreviously, people had to park or exit the metro station and take the feeder buses towards KR Pura and proceed towards Whitefield. The opening of the missing link negates the need for the switch at the station, reducing traffic on the road instantly.\n\nTraffic flow from MM Temple towards Mahadevapura via the KR Puram railway station under the hanging bridge also improved due to fewer vehicles on the road. Vehicle queue length at traffic signals on the same road fell from 150 metres to about 100 metres, a reduction of at least 33%, as of 10 am, he explained.\n\nAnucheth, however, cautioned that a better understanding of the impact of the full metro line can be gauged only after a week’s worth of data. “As more people become aware that the Purple Line is fully operational, they might switch to the metro. That will further bring down the traffic. We need to observe for a week for detailed analysis and trends,” he said.\n\n“We now have at least 20 BMTC buses from the KR Pura metro station to Silk Board Jn along the ORR. We are planning to formally launch this on Wednesday. There are also plans to launch KR Pura-Whitefield loop feeder buses on the same day,” he said."
