        "text": "Bangalore or Bengaluru is the city of dreams that attracts people from all corners of the country. Some are here to start their corporate life while others are striving to build a successful start-up. Many reputed companies have set up their base in this beautiful city! Tourists come here all the time to explore the well-manicured gardens and architectural wonders. And then there is the party scene! Bengaluru has the highest number of pubs and breweries in the country that entertain the masses. That being said, the cityâs traffic woes have always been a point of discussion. Bangalore Metro, also called âNamma Metroâ makes commuting easier, safer and certainly faster!\n\nHereâs everything you need to know about the Bangalore Metro, its history, operational lines, upcoming lines, fares, features and more.\n\nRead on!\n\nHistory and Development\n\nThe State Town Planning Department recommended that the city must have a mass rapid transport option, preferably an intracity metro, way back in 1977. A committee sat down to discuss the same and took help from a few members of the Southern Railway (SR). The team from SR suggested that the city must have a 2-corridor metro that is about 80 kms long along with rail lines and a ring railway. SR was commissioned to do this in 1981.\n\nIn 1993, the state government established another community and they also suggested the same thing that the SR team previously planned.\n\nBangalore Mass Rapid Transit Ltd (BMRTL) was created in 1994. This body suggested that the network should be 300 kms long with 6 routes. However, the plan was dropped. With so many hurdles and not a single plan going on the floor, the Karnataka government finally sought the expertise of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRL) after seeing their successful metro venture in the capital of India. After a detailed study, this body suggested that the metro must have 2 lines running 60 kms. They said that the middle of the cross can be underground at the Central Railway Station. The government accepted DMRLâs plan and BMRTL was replaced with Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL).\n\nPhase 1\n\nThe initial plan for the Phase 1 construction was submitted in May 2003. It was for a route of 33 kms with 32 stations. The Union Cabinet approved the same on 25th April 2006. Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, laid down the first stone of construction on 24th June 2006. The construction of the Phase – 1 line that runs between Baiyyappanahalli and Mahatma Gandhi Road began on 15th April 2007.\n\nPhase 2\n\nPhase – 2 plan was needed to extend the metro network to parts of Bengaluru where the routes of Phase – 1 did not run. DMRC submitted their plan for the second phase of construction on 4th January 2011. The Karnataka government gave their approval on 3rd January 2012. But, there were delays in the preparation of the complete plan and hence, they couldnât seek the approval of the Central government. After a lot of delays, a budget plan was made and the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) approved it in August 2013. Subsequently, the Union Cabinet announced its approval on 30th January 2014. Phase 2 lines are expected to run from late 2024 to early 2025.\n\nThere are plans for future expansion of the Bangalore Metro in Phase – 3 which is expected to have three more lines.\n\nYou can also look into the elaborate Chennai Metro Network which does an equally good job to ensure people travel faster and safer in the Tamil Nadu capital.\n\nCurrent operational lines of Bangalore Metro\n\nThe purple and green lines of Bangalore Metro are currently operating in the city. These were constructed as a part of Phase 1 of the project and the line runs for 42.3 kms. 8.82 kms of this route is underground while the remaining 33.48 is elevated. The lines have 40 stations with 7 underground ones, 1 at grade (at the general surface level, sometimes without a roof) and 32 are elevated.

It may range anywhere between INR 10 to INR 50. You will find three types of tickets in the counters of the metro stations.\n\nToken – A token is useful for one-way travel or one-time travel that can range anywhere between INR 10 to INR 50.\n\nGroup Ticket – If a group of 25 people or more are travelling by the Bangalore metro to the same destination, they can purchase the group ticket and also avail additional 10% discount on the fare price to their station.\n\nSmart Card – A smart card is useful for people who travel every day through the metro.

These are the e-tickets which will have distinct QR codes that can be scanned at the Automated Fare Collection (AFC) gates of the metro station. The mobile QR tickets offer a 5% discount on the token fare.\n\nMetro Services and Features\n\nThe Bangalore Metro timings are from 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM. The last train from each starting point would begin its journey around 10:35 PM. On general holidays like the second and fourth Saturdays, the trains start moving at 6:00 AM and the last train at 10:35 PM. On Sundays, the first train moves at 7:00 AM and the last train at 11:00 PM.\n\nDuring peak hours or special days, the trains frequent the stations every 5-7 minutes. Otherwise, there is a duration of 10 to 15 minutes between the arrival of each train. Also, the doors shut too fast so you must hasten and get in soon.\n\nThe stations have CCTV surveillance for the safety of passengers. There are security personnel for checking and bag scanners to detect harmful items. You also have metal detectors at the gates. In the trains, dedicated coaches are available for women and female personnel are always present for their checks.\n\nYou will find dedicated parking spaces in a few metro stations if not all. There are feeder buses too that will ensure last-mile connectivity to your desired destination. Interestingly, certain stations also have bicycle-sharing facilities where you can get a bicycle, ride and return it back. Wi-Fi is available in most of the major metro stations.\n\nThe Bangalore Metro route map currently extends to major tourist hubs and important industrial areas. It is the best way to reach your destination without the hassle of manoeuvring your way through the traffic. Also, the stations and trains are designed with passenger safety in mind, so you can let go and relax until you reach your station.\n\nEnvironmental and social impact\n\nThe Bangalore Metro route map extends to the major localities in the city. Most people are now relying on the services of this public transport system. Due to this practice carbon emissions from vehicles will be less too, contributing to a better environment and lower pollution levels.\n\nReal estate and economic effect\n\nThe property value has increased significantly in areas that are closer to the Bangalore metro lines and stations. Many residential construction projects, entertainment ventures and newer party places were also built here over the years. There is a surge in commercial activity with newer retail shops, offices and restaurants on these routes.\n\nPeople visiting the city prefer to book hotels in Bangalore that are near the metro stations. After giving one look to the Bangalore map metro, you can easily narrow down stays that are close to the transportation points.\n\nChallenges and solutions\n\nThe major challenge while constructing the Bangalore Metro was to navigate through the tough terrains of the underground stations. The cutter head of the tunnel boring machine was broken and this delayed the project until replacement parts were ordered. Also, getting a sufficient budget was an issue. The government paved the way for the collaboration between the state and private sectors which helped in mobilising the resources better within the budget range.\n\nUser experience and feedback\n\nRegular commuters are very happy with the punctuality of the trains and the cleanliness of the couches. They can reach their destinations sooner than they had while travelling on the road. Many testimonials highlighted the ease of travel and the time they were able to save.\n\nTourists can book their accommodations easily around the main transit points of the city. For instance, it is hassle-free to book hotels near Bangalore Railway Station and reach these places through the metro. And from here, they can take the metro again to explore the tourist attractions of the city while utilising the ticket discounts available."
