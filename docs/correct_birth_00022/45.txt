Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born on September 23, 1949 in Long Branch, New Jersey. Nicknamed "The Boss," his career as a musician has spanned nearly 50 years. He is known as an originator of "heartland rock" music, which mixes rock musical elements with personal storytelling.

He released his first albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, in 1973, but achieved his first bout of widespread success with his third album, Born to Run. The titular track and Thunder Road have become rock music staples and some of Springsteen's greatest hits. His most commercially successful album came even later with the release of Born in the U.S.A. in 1984. As of 2020, he has released 20 studio albums.

In his career, he has won a grand total of 20 Grammy Awards, and he was awarded an Oscar and a Golden Globe in the category of Best Original Song in 1994 for Streets of Philadelphia, which was featured on the Philadelphia soundtrack. He also earned an Oscar nomination in 1996 for his title track for the film Dead Man Walkin' and a Golden Globe nomination in 2009 for the title track of The Wrestler. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in 1999.

He made his Broadway debut with Springsteen on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theatre on October 3, 2017. The solo concert residency featured Springsteen playing his greatest hits interspersed with personal stories, many from his autobiography. The show officially opened October 12, 2017 and played a thrice-extended, sold-out run through December 15, 2018. On June 26, 2021, Springsteen on Broadway reopened for another limited engagement that ran through September 4, making it the first show to play on Broadway since the COVID-19 pandemic.
