New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, has announced that September 23 will now officially be known as Bruce Springsteen Day in the Garden State. Murphy mentioned the news on social media, tweeting the document he signed to seal the deal. “Bruce Springsteen is one of the most iconic and influential musicians—and New Jerseyans—of all time, period,” Murphy tweeted. “And so, I am both honored and proud to announce @Springsteen’s birthday, Sept. 23, will officially be known as Bruce Springsteen Day.”

“Beyond being an iconic singer, songwriter, and family man, ‘the Boss’ has acted on film, TV, and Broadway, recorded a podcast series with President Barack Obama, written, starred in, and produced documentaries, and has helped countless charities in New Jersey and around the world,” Murphy wrote in the proclamation. “Bruce Springsteen will forever be remembered as the voice of the Garden State, signaling to the world that New Jerseyans were born to run.”

Murphy also announced the news last night (April 15) during the American Music Honors, as Billboard points out. The event (hosted by New Jersey native Jon Stewart) was held at the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music on the campus of Monmouth University in West Long Branch, New Jersey.

Springsteen has earned a number of accolades over the years, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, bestowed upon him by President Barack Obama in 2016. Just last month, President Joe Biden honored Springsteen with the National Medals of Arts.
