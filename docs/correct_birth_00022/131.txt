LONG BRANCH -- A small house in the West End section previously occupied by New Jersey rock legend Bruce Springsteen is for sale for $299,000, according to a report by RedBank Orbit.

The reports said Springsteen lived in the house in 1974 and 1975, when his career-making "Born to Run" album was released. Realtor Susan McLaughlin of Keller Williams Realty told the website the one-story shotgun-style house is "bigger than it looks at 828 square feet."
