The state of New Jersey recently announced its recognition of September 23rd as Bruce Springsteen Day.

The announcement was made by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy at the 2023 American Music Honors. The inaugural American Music Honors were held April 15th at the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music.

The Bruce Springsteen Archives are located on the campus of Monmouth University in West Long Branch, New Jersey. The ceremony was a fitting place to pay tribute to “The Boss”, and was hosted by fellow NJ legend Jon Stewart.

“I may be the 56th individual to be called ‘governor,’ but there will ever only be just one ‘Boss’,” Gov. Murphy remarked during his announcement. “Thank you for showing the world what it means to live our New Jersey values.”

September 23rd is also Bruce Springsteen’s birthday. He joins a list of notable New Jersey artists to receive official “Days” that includes Frank Sinatra, Bon Jovi, and Springsteen’s former E Street Band member Clarence Clemons.
