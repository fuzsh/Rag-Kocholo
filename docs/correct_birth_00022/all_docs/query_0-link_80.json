        "text": "Gov. Phil Murphy made the announcement honoring the iconic Freehold-born rocker on April 15. Here's when to celebrate:\n\nFREEHOLD, NJ - Legendary New Jersey rocker Bruce Springsteen has nodded to his home state in countless songs, from “Atlantic City” to “Jersey Girl” to “Born To Run.” Now, the Garden State is paying tribute to the Freehold-born musician right back.\n\nAccording to a Saturday tweet from Gov. Phil Murphy, Springsteen’s birthday, September 23, will be recognized as “Bruce Springsteen Day” going forward.\n\n“Bruce Springsteen is one of the most iconic and influential musicians – and New Jerseyans – of all time, period,” Gov. Phil Murphy said.\n\nRelated: Springsteen Declined Rest Stop To Be Named After Him\n\nRelated: Bruce Springsteen's Post-Pandemic Plans? A Jersey Freeze Visit\n\nThe 73-year-old rocker began his music career cutting his teeth at New Jersey venues like The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, later memorializing his native Freehold in “My Hometown,” among other hits. Over a nearly six-decade career, he’s earned multiple Grammy, MTV Video Music and American Music awards.\n\n“Beyond being an iconic singer, songwriter and family man, “The Boss” has acted on film, TV and Broadway, recorded a podcast series with President Barack Obama, written, starred in and produced documentaries, and has helped countless charities in New Jersey and around the world,” the proclamation reads. “Bruce Springsteen will forever be remembered as the voice of the Garden State, signaling to the world that New Jerseyans were born to run.” Related: Springsteen Joins Obama, Recalls Freehold Riots On New Podcast\n\nYou can view the full proclamation below:\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
