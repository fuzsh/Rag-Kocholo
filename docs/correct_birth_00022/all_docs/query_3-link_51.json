        "text": "Bruce Springsteen made his clearest reference to the Jersey Shore with “Atlantic City” on Nebraska in 1982. This song tells a darker story about the death of a mob boss in Philadelphia. The official video shows scenes from the most commonly known shore point in South Jersey.\n\nPut your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty\n\nAnd meet me tonight in Atlantic City\n\nTom Waits originally wrote and performed “Jersey Girl” in 1980, but Bruce Springsteen popularized the song with live performances in the state of New Jersey. The song starts off with a perfect line to describe the anticipation of a vacation.\n\nTonight I’m gonna take that ride\n\nAcross the river to the Jersey side\n\nTake my baby to the carnival\n\nAnd I’ll take her on all the rides\n\n“Jersey Girl” tied in the romantic theme commonly associated with summer music, especially by the countless people in the mid-Atlantic region who met their spouses at the Jersey Shore.\n\nCause down the shore everything’s all right\n\nYou and your baby on a Saturday night\n\nYou know all my dreams come true\n\nWhen I’m walking down the street with you\n\n“Rosalita” is like many Springsteen songs about the feeling of youth and the desire to make it big against all odds. The lyrics tell the story of a young couple who don’t have the approval of the their parents.\n\nAnd my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy\n\nAnd my machine, she’s a dud, out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey\n\nIt’s a classic that won’t go out of style. The most popular Springsteen song is even recognized by the Library of Congress for artistic influence.\n\nThe song mentions “Highway 9,” which runs along the coast of the Jersey Shore. Springsteen famously performed it with fellow New Jersey native Jon Bon Jovi at a concert to benefit relief funds for damages caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nTramps like us\n\nBaby we were born to run\n\n“Spirit in the Night” uses a rebellious vibe and a geographic reference to Route 88, which runs into the heart of Point Pleasant in North Jersey just a few miles from Asbury Park.\n\nWell, Billy slammed on his coaster brakes\n\nAnd said, “Anybody want to go on up to Greasy Lake?\n\nIt’s about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88\n\nI got a bottle of rose so let’s try it\n\n“Thunder Road” never explicitly mentions the state of New Jersey, but the themes stay in line with the most popular music from the Boss. The vibe has made it a Jersey Shore favorite for generations.\n\nYou can still catch the Juliano Brothers covering it at Keenan’s in Wildwood, the beach bars of Sea Isle, and plenty of spots throughout the rest of Cape May County every summer.\n\nIt’s also become one of the easiest songs to allow for the audience to take over at a live show.\n\nHey, what else can we do now?\n\nExcept roll down the window\n\nAnd let the wind blow back your hair\n\nWell, the night’s busting open\n\nThese two lanes will take us anywhere\n\nSpringsteen filmed the video for “Tunnel of Love” in Asbury Park with scenes along the famous boardwalk that show carnival rides, food vendors, and other easily recognizable scenery. It also includes scenes inside an abandoned casino that add authenticity to the location.\n\nIt ends with Bruce walking toward a fading sunset, a peaceful image easily associated with a summer vacation and a beach setting."
