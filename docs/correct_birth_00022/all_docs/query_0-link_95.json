        "text": "The Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University has announced a new 30,000 square foot building to house the Archives, the Center for American Music, related exhibition galleries, and a 230-seat, state-of-the-art theater.\n\nDesigned by the acclaimed New York-based architectural firm, COOKFOX, the building will be located on the campus of Monmouth University, not far from where Springsteen wrote his landmark song, “Born to Run,” nearly 50 years ago.\n\nA campaign to raise the $45 million to construct the new building is underway. The anticipated opening date is spring 2026.\n\n“Monmouth University is excited to enrich our campus with a new home for one of the country’s premier cultural and educational institutions dedicated to preserving the legacy of Bruce Springsteen and the story of American music,” said Monmouth University President and Chair of the Archives Board Patrick F. Leahy. “This beautiful and functional facility will enhance cultural and educational opportunities in New Jersey and our region, expand academic scholarship, and position Monmouth University as a national leader in arts education.”\n\nThe Center for American Music will feature exhibits on Springsteen and showcase diverse topics and themes in American music, while the Archives will offer visitors the chance to listen to oral histories and interviews, watch rare film footage, and explore major moments in music history.\n\nIntimate concerts, teacher workshops, symposia, lectures, film series, and other public and educational programs will also be part of the mission of the Archives and Center for American Music.\n\n“Our institution will offer exciting research opportunities for students, journalists, and historians and give Springsteen fans the chance to explore his music and the role it plays in American history like never before,” added Robert Santelli, executive director of the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music. “Teachers will also find the Archives and Center for American Music a valuable educational resource. Lesson plans, teaching strategies, and online programs will be available to teachers and enable them to bring American music into the classroom.”\n\nAbout the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University\n\nThe Bruce Springsteen Archives serves as the official repository for Bruce Springsteen’s songs and other written works, plus photographs, periodicals, oral histories, recordings, films, and artifacts related to Springsteen and the E Street Band.
