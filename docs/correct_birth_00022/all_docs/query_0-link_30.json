        "text": "The state of New Jersey recently announced its recognition of September 23rd as Bruce Springsteen Day.\n\nThe announcement was made by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy at the 2023 American Music Honors. The inaugural American Music Honors were held April 15th at the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music.\n\nThe Bruce Springsteen Archives are located on the campus of Monmouth University in West Long Branch, New Jersey. The ceremony was a fitting place to pay tribute to “The Boss”, and was hosted by fellow NJ legend Jon Stewart.\n\n“I may be the 56th individual to be called ‘governor,’ but there will ever only be just one ‘Boss’,” Gov. Murphy remarked during his announcement. “Thank you for showing the world what it means to live our New Jersey values.”\n\nSeptember 23rd is also Bruce Springsteen’s birthday. He joins a list of notable New Jersey artists to receive official “Days” that includes Frank Sinatra, Bon Jovi, and Springsteen’s former E Street Band member Clarence Clemons.\n\nThe Official Bruce Springsteen Day Proclamation\n\nThe official proclamation by Governor Murphy reads as follows:\n\n“WHEREAS, Bruce Springsteen will forever be remembered as the voice of the Garden State, signaling to the world that New Jerseyans were born to run;\n\n“NOW, THEREFORE, I, Philip D. Murphy, Governor of the State of New Jersey, do hereby proclaim: SEPTEMBER 23 AS BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN DAY for creating the soundtrack to our glory days.”\n\nBruce Springsteen is one of America’s most decorated living musicians. He has received the Kennedy Center Honors, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Arts. Over his career, Springsteen has amassed 20 Grammy awards, an Oscar, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999."
