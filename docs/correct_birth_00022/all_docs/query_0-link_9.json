        "text": "Post-show analysis, band-naming sessions and budding romances — it all happened at the Inkwell Coffeehouse in Long Branch for Bruce Springsteen and the members of the E Street Band.\n\nThe Inkwell, 665 2nd Ave. closed its doors earlier this month. “It saddens us to say the good times have come to an end,” said management in a May 17 social media post. “We want to thank everyone for all the love and support over the years.”\n\nThe roots of the E Street Band's connections to the Inkwell go back to when it was called the Expresso House inside the former Lincoln Hotel on Kingsley Street in Asbury Park.\n\nThere, E Street Band founder Vini “Mad Dog” Lopez used to talk drumming and music with mentor Buzzy Lubinsky. Original owner Joe Distasio moved the business to Second and Brighton in Long Branch in 1965 and called it the Inkwell.\n\n“Joe formed his own particular business code, which includes no swearing and — surprise again — no dancing,” wrote the Asbury Park Press in 1965. “He claims that dancing often leads to trouble, and besides, ‘I hate rock ’n’ roll. It isn’t any real form of music and the words are pretty dumb.’ \"\n\nThat didn't keep the future members of the E Street Band away.\n\n“We would go there late at night,” said Lopez, previously to the USA Today Network NJ. “I loved the pumpernickel cheese sandwiches. We would go there when we had the money.”\n\nLopez, Springsteen and the rest of the group came up with the pre-E Street Band name Steel Mill at the Inkwell, Lopez said. The Boss even moved in around the corner from the Inkwell at 7½ West End Court in Long Branch in 1974.\n\nIt was there where he wrote “Born to Run.”\n\nDistasio moved the Inkwell to its current location in 1979 before selling to a group of employees. That location is even closer to the house where Springsteen wrote “Born to Run.”\n\nTour announcemnt: Bruce Springsteen, E Street Band announce international tour to start in U.S. early 2023\n\n'Thank you, Boss': Bruce Springsteen songs performed on 'American Idol' finale\n\nIn the '80s, Springsteen and Patti Scialfa would hit it up after playing with Cats on a Smooth Surface at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park on Sunday nights.\n\nThey'd have “an after-hours cheeseburger and chat at the Inkwell,” said Springsteen in his “Born to Run” memoir. “A few smiles, a kiss on the cheek, a 'See you at the club' and the night would come to a close.”\n\n“Sometimes we would go out to the Inkwell in West End (section of Long Branch) and have a hamburger and the chocolate milk with the whipped cream on top,” said Scialfa, a native of Deal, to New Jersey Monthly. “The old Inkwell — I had been going there since I was a teenager.”\n\nSpringsteen and Scialfa were married in June 1991, and they raised three children together.\n\nInkwell owner Anthony Esposito said it was time to move on.\n\n“I just came to the conclusion now that I need to take a step back,” said Esposito to the USA Today Network NJ. “I’m 50 years old. I’m a single dad, and I’m looking to take a step back to spend some more time with my family.”\n\nSubscribe to app.com for the latest on Bruce Springsteen and the New Jersey music scene.\n\nChris Jordan, a Jersey Shore native, covers entertainment and features for the USA Today Network New Jersey.
