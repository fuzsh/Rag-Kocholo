        "text": "By Judy O’Gorman Alvarez\n\nWEST LONG BRANCH – The hometown streets were abuzz last week when fans of The Boss – and music fans in general – learned of Monmouth University’s plans for a new 30,000-square-foot building to house the Bruce Springsteen Archives & Center for American Music.\n\nThe new building, to open in spring 2026, will be a fitting home for the nearly 35,000 items of Springsteen memorabilia the archives hold from 47 countries. The new center will also include exhibition galleries and a 230-seat state-of-the-art theater. Designed by the acclaimed New York-based architectural firm COOKFOX, the building will be located on the university’s West Long Branch campus. A campaign to raise the $45 million needed for construction is under way.\n\n“Monmouth University is excited to enrich our campus with a new home for one of the country’s premier cultural and educational institutions dedicated to preserving the legacy of Bruce Springsteen and the story of American music,” said Monmouth University president and chair of the archives board Patrick F. Leahy, Ed.D. in a press release announcing the news.\n\nThe Center for American Music will feature exhibits on Springsteen and showcase diverse topics and themes in American music, while the Archives will offer visitors the chance to listen to oral histories and interviews, watch rare film footage and explore major moments in music history. Intimate concerts, teacher workshops, symposia, lectures, film series, and other public and educational programs will also be part of the center’s mission. “Our institution will offer exciting research opportunities for students, journalists, and historians and give Springsteen fans the chance to explore his music and the role it plays in American history like never before,” said Robert Santelli, executive director of the Bruce Springsteen Archives & Center for American Music. “Teachers will also find the Archives & Center for American Music a valuable educational resource. Lesson plans, teaching strategies, and online programs will be available to teachers and enable them to bring American music into the classroom.”\n\nEileen Chapman, archives and center director, is excited for the new venue. Chapman has cared for, nurtured and helped grow the Springsteen trove since it was a small fan-based collection of memorabilia housed at the Asbury Park Library in 2001.\n\nWhen the archival collection outgrew the library’s storage capacity, Chapman, who worked at Monmouth University, helped find a place for it on the campus in 2011. “In 2017 Springsteen announced that we will be his official archives,” she said.\n\n“When it arrived here it was 15,000 pieces. And it continues to grow because Bruce continues to tour and so we realized at the pace that the collection was growing, that it needed not only a bigger space, but a space that accurately reflects the quality of this collection.”\n\nThe collection serves the research and informational needs of music fans, scholars, authors and others with a serious interest in the life and career of Bruce Springsteen. It contains the musician’s written works, photographs, periodicals, and artifacts.\n\nImagine a walk back in the life of The Boss. Chapman said they recently obtained Springsteen’s high school commencement program, a family Bible that dates back to the 1800s, and various items fans will recognize from the more than 50 years Springsteen has been performing, including his beloved electric Fender guitar – the one he learned how to make talk – featured on the cover of the “Born to Run” album.\n\nA highlight of the collection, according to Chapman, is Springsteen’s mother’s scrapbook.\n\n“Adele kept scrapbooks of Bruce’s career from the time he started playing. And so those scrapbooks are just, again, very priceless, and so thoughtfully put together.”\n\nHis proud mother preserved letters from former managers who wrote notes like, “I think your son’s going to be a star.”\n\n“Everyone that comes in comes with excitement and interest and engagement,” Chapman said.\n\nAmong the visitors are researchers, scholars, filmmakers, documentarians, as well as musicians, fans and the curious. Sometimes fans bring their kids to see posters from shows they have attended. They once had a bachelorette party of 16 visit. “Every visit is meaningful,” Chapman said. Visits to the center can be arranged by appointment only.\n\nSpringsteen, who grew up in Freehold and spent years performing in and writing about Asbury Park, may be a local treasure, as the hordes of fans who come through the museum will attest, but he’s a global attraction, too.\n\nChapman noted there are visitors from all over the world including France, Italy and Japan who come to study the man and the artifacts.\n\n“Sometimes we’ll have the opportunity to introduce them to former members of the E Street Band or Bruce’s first manager Tinker West,” she said. “We try to enhance everybody’s visit and make it that much more meaningful.”\n\nIn addition to the archives, the Center for American Music preserves and promotes the legacy of Bruce Springsteen and his role in American music, while creating exhibits, public programs and education initiatives that explore the works of American music giants like Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, Billie Holiday, Patti Smith, Frank Sinatra, Gaslight Anthem and others.\n\nThey are in the process of curating an exhibit of 100 iconic music items, that will tell the story of music from the 1800s to the present day. Somewhat random items in the collection include very early musical instruments, a hymnal of slave songs, the first Rolling Stone magazine and Ray Charles’s sunglasses.\n\nSpringsteen continues to pull in fans of all ages.\n\n“I’m not surprised because working on the college campus, I actually get to see the level of engagement with the students,” Chapman said. “Here at Monmouth we teach two Springsteen courses.”\n\nChapman said they also hire university students to work in the archives to help catalog items and often allow them to help curate exhibits.\n\n“This beautiful and functional facility will enhance cultural and educational opportunities in New Jersey and our region, expand academic scholarship, and position Monmouth University as a national leader in arts education,” said Leahy.\n\nFor an article on Carl “Tinker” West, see page 10.\n\nThe article originally appeared in the October 26 – November 1, 2023 print edition of The Two River Times."
