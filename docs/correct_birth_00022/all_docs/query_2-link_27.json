        "text": "The Born in the U.S.A. Tour was the supporting concert tour of Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. album. It was his longest and most successful tour to date. It featured a physically transformed Springsteen; after two years of bodybuilding, the singer had bulked up considerably. The tour was the first since the 1974 portions of the Born to Run tours without guitarist Steven Van Zandt, who decided to go solo after recording the album with the grop. Van Zandt, who was replaced by Nils Lofgren, would appear a few times throughout the tour and in some of the music videos to promote the album. It was also the first tour to feature Springsteen's future wife, Patti Scialfa.\n\nThe tour started in June 1984 and went through the United States and to Canada. In March 1985 the tour went to Australia, Japan and Europe. It then headed back for a second leg of the U.S. tour in which Springsteen and the E Street Band played to sold-out professional football stadiums. The tour finished in October 1985 in Los Angeles.\n\nThe tour grossed $80–90 million overall. Of that, $34 million came from Springsteen's summer 1985 stadium dates in North America.[1] The Born in the U.S.A. album was inside the top 10 of the Billboard 200 during the entire tour. Springsteen also was enjoying a hit single from the album (there were seven in total) during any moment of the tour. The album along with Springsteen's previous album, Nebraska, which he did not tour to promote, were performed in their entirety throughout the tour. Total attendance was 3.9 million.\n\nPersonnel[]\n\nBruce Springsteen – lead vocals, guitars, harmonica\n\nClarence Clemons – saxophone, congas, percussion, background vocals\n\nGarry Tallent – bass guitar\n\nDanny Federici – organ, glockenspiel, piano, synthesizer\n\nRoy Bittan – piano, synthesizer, background vocals\n\nMax Weinberg – drums\n\nNils Lofgren – guitars, background vocals\n\nPatti Scialfa – background vocals, synthesizer, tambourine\n\nSpecial guests[]\n\nCourteney Cox (6/29/84 – danced with Springsteen on \"Dancing in the Dark\" which was captured in the music video)\n\nJ.T.
