        "text": "Happy Bruce Springsteen Day!\n\nYup, it's official. Springsteen's birthday is Sept. 23 — he’s 74 — and it's Bruce Springsteen Day in the state of New Jersey.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy proclaimed it so at the inaugural American Music Honors event, presented by the Bruce Springsteen Archives, on April 15.\n\n“There's been 14 administrations in New Jersey since Springsteen started performing,” Murphy said. “I can't believe it's taken this long.”\n\nMeanwhile, Springsteen fans around the world have celebrated the date for years.\n\n“Bruce Springsteen is one of the most recognizable, iconic and influential musicians — and New Jerseyans — of all time,” said Murphy in a statement. “It is important that we recognize Bruce for all he has done and will continue to do, from giving us the gift of his music to lending his time to the causes close to his heart.”\n\nFans will be celebrating Springsteen Day, and his birthday, around the world. The Spring-Nuts fan club plans to have fun and send the Boss a group birthday message on social media.\n\nBruce Springsteen Day 2023 sees the Boss and the E Street Band on a break\n\nSpringsteen and the E Street Band are taking a break as the Boss is being treated for symptoms of peptic ulcer disease. The rest of the E Street Band's shows in September have been postponed.\n\nThe legendary rocker posted a note to his official Instagram page informing fans that, starting with the scheduled concert on Sept. 7 in Syracuse, New York, he would be taking a break under advisement from his doctors.\n\n\"Over here on E Street, we're heartbroken to have to postpone these shows,\" the statement reads. \"First, apologies to our fabulous Philly fans, who we missed a few weeks ago. We’ll be back to pick these shows up and then some.\"\n\nSpringsteen signed off with, \"We’ll be back soon. Love and God bless all.\"\n\nIn August, Springsteen uncharacteristically postponed two concerts at Philadelphia's Citizens Bank Park, citing illness. But he was back for a trio of hometown stadium stompers at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nSpringsteen was born Sept. 23, 1949, at the former Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch. He's the first born of Adele and Douglas Springsteen of Freehold. They would have two more children, Virginia and Pamela."
