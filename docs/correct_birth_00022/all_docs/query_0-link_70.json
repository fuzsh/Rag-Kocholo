        "text": "Bruce Springsteen may not have gone to college, but he is getting a building named after him at Monmouth University in West Long Branch near his longtime home in New Jersey, the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music announced at a special ceremony on Wednesday morning. Springsteen has a long history with the university, having performed there on multiple occasions and housing his archives there.\n\n“Having a building with your name on it is a tricky thing,” Springsteen told the audience, which included Rock and Roll Hall of Famers singer Darlene Love, former E Street Band member Vini Lopez and longtime manager manager Jon Landau. “Because I’m still alive.”\n\nSpringsteen joked that with the building comes great responsibility, because “I am subject to any kind of behavior.”\n\n“I mean, I could get arrested for… tequilas in a public park. That’s something that could happen,” he laughed, referencing the 2021 incident where he was charged with DWI on his motorcycle after taking a shot of tequila offered by a fan.\n\n“All I can say,” he concluded on that note, “is I will try to do my best for the rest of my life not to embarrass a building.”\n\nThe new 30,000 square foot building to house the archives will be designed by the acclaimed New York-based architectural firm, Cookfox, and will be located on the campus of Monmouth University on the corner of Cedar and Norwood Avenue, not far from where Springsteen wrote his landmark song, “Born to Run,” nearly 50 years ago. A campaign to raise the $45 million to construct the new building is underway, with two-thirds of the goal already raised, according to Monmouth University President and Chair of the Archives Board Patrick F. Leahy.\n\n“A few years ago, Bruce Springsteen committed his archives here to us, Leahy said. “I think he referred to it as his ‘stuff.'”\n\nSpringsteen added that the center gave him an opportunity to “get the junk out of my house,” he laughed. “It was getting cluttered in there and so now I’ve got someplace to put that stuff.”"
