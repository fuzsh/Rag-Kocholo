        "text": "Bruce Springsteen himself might not be particularly enthusiastic about his seventh studio effort, Born In The U.S.A. (\"a group of songs about which I've always had some ambivalence\n\nBorn In The U.S.A. was co-produced with Jon Landau, Chuck Plotkin, and E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt, and represented a complete divergence from his previous release, the acoustic affair Nebraska. Audiences didn't seem to mind the change in tone: The 12-track LP spent seven weeks atop the Billboard 200 and sold more than 17 million copies in America alone.\n\nIt also equaled the record set by Michael Jackson's Thriller by spawning seven consecutive U.S. Top 10 hits, including the oft-misunderstood title track, \"I'm On Fire,\" and his highest-charting, \"Dancing in the Dark.\" (The latter netted The Boss his first GRAMMY Award, for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male.) Born's themes of working-class life in the Ronald Reagan era struck a chord with homegrown audiences, albeit occasionally for unintended reasons, and picked up a coveted Album Of The Year nod at the 1985 GRAMMYs.\n\nBut there's more to Born In The U.S.A.'s story than blockbuster sales and critical acclaim. It also changed the course of rock music in several ways, whether reigniting America's love of the genre, proving that synths and guitars could work together in perfect harmony, or simply popularizing a new way to hear it. Ahead of its 40th anniversary, here's a look at why the record fully deserves its status as an all-time great.\n\nIt Revolutionized The Sound Of Heartland Rock\n\nAlready hailed as a progenitor of the blue-collar, rootsy sound known as heartland rock, Springsteen once again proved to be something of a revolutionary when he added synths into the mix. Born In The U.S.A. continually puts pianist Roy Bittan's skills to great use — whether he's echoing the whistle that haunts the narrator of \"Downbound Train,\" giving \"I'm On Fire\" its ethereal sheen, or imbuing \"Dancing In The Dark\" with a glowing warmth.\n\nBorn In The U.S.A. helped codify synths as a key component of the decade's rock sound. Within a few years, most of The Boss' peers had enjoyed synth-based success: Don Henley with Building the Perfect Beast, Tom Petty with Southern Accents, as well as Robbie Robertson's self-titled debut. Even The Boss' hero, Bob Dylan, went electric again on Empire Burlesque. And you can hear its modern-day influence in the likes of the Killers, Kurt Vile, and, most notably, proud Springsteen acolytes The War on Drugs.\n\nIt Bid Farewell To Rock's Most Iconic Backing Band\n\nWith their uncanny ability to capture and expand upon his musical vision, The E Street Band have been as integral to Springsteen's success as The Boss himself. The likes of bassist Garry Tallent, saxophonist Clarence Clemons, and drummer Max Weinberg were responsible for the Wall of Sound that enveloped 1975 breakthrough Born to Run, while 1980's The River was a concerted attempt to replicate their prowess on the stage in the studio.\n\nBut while they provided occasional backing on 1987 follow-up Tunnel of Love, Born In The U.S.A. was the last time Springsteen fully utilized their talents until 2002's return-to-form The Rising. It also proved to be a proper farewell to Van Zandt, who left the set-up halfway through recording to pursue a solo career. The constant whoops and cheers, however, suggests that all parties were determined to end things on a celebratory note.\n\nIt Turned Springsteen IntoAn MTV Icon\n\nSpringsteen had only previously released one music video, and he didn't even make an appearance, with 1982's \"Atlantic City\" consisting solely of austere images of the titular location. But keen to show off the muscular physique he'd developed during the following two years, The Boss made five videos for Born In The U.S.A., and bagged some impressive names to help him land that all-important MTV play.\n\nScarface director Brian De Palma helmed its most famous, the \"Dancing in the Dark\" promo in which Springsteen plucked a then-unknown Courteney Cox from the crowd. Indie favorite John Sayles pulled triple duty, directing the performance-based video for the title track and developing the narrative treatments for \"I'm On Fire\" (Springsteen plays car mechanic tempted by affair with married customer) and \"Glory Days\" (Springsteen bonds with son via baseball). Boasting footage from the Born In The U.S.A. tour, \"My Hometown\" rounded off the whole audio-visual campaign which was twice recognized at the VMAs.\n\nIt Kickstarted A CD Revolution\n\nAlthough compact discs had been around for several years, Born In The U.S.A. was — fittingly, considering its title and blue collar themes — the first to be manufactured in America. Within just a few years, the homegrown CD market had skyrocketed from virtually zero to more than $930 million. And with at least 17 million copies sold domestically overall, it seems reasonable to suggest that Springsteen's seventh LP was responsible for a significant percentage.\n\nNo doubt that its iconic front cover — shot by celebrated photographer Annie Leibovitz — helped the album stand in record stores. Shot from behind with Springsteen clad in denim, posing in front of the Stars and Stripes, Born In The U.S.A. provided audiences with one of the decade's most recognizable images. Explaining the creative decision to ignore his Hollywood action hero looks, The Boss toldRolling Stone, \"The picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.\"\n\nIt Spawned A Game-Changing Tour\n\nIf you need any proof of how stratospheric Born In The U.S.A. sent Springsteen's career, just look at its accompanying tour. With 156 dates across North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia, the tour raked in approximately $90 million. (It remained the decade's highest-grossing rock tour until Pink Floyd's A Momentary Lapse of Reason concluded four years later.)\n\nSpringsteen's success also appeared to convince David Bowie and Tina Turner that solo artists could handle a stadium crowd as well as any band.\n\nThe Born In The U.S.A. trek was monumental for several other reasons: it was the first to feature new E Street Band member Nils Lofgren and Springsteen's future wife Patti Scialfa. It established his long-running love affair with the now-demolished Giants Stadium, a New Jersey venue returned to 23 times. The tour formed more than half of Springsteen's Live: 1975-85 album that topped the Billboard 200 for four weeks in 1986. Until Garth Brooks' Double Live 12 years later, Live: 1975-85 the highest-selling live album ever.\n\nIt Celebrated Male Friendship\n\nSpringsteen has never been afraid to be vulnerable when it comes to an area most rock musicians seem afraid to address: the importance of male friendship. \"Ghosts,\" for example, is a heartfelt dedication to all the bandmates he'd lost over the years, while \"This Hard Land\" is a tale of brotherhood inspired by his love of western maestro John Ford. But it was on Born In The U.S.A. where The Boss first showed that songs about entirely platonic love can be as emotively powerful as the more romantic side.\n\nIndeed, the ambiguous gender on \"Bobby Jean\" has led many to believe the concert staple is a testament to his relationship with Van Zandt. And \"No Surrender\" appears to revel in the camaraderie they shared back in their younger days. Foo Fighters (\"The Glass\"), the Walkmen (\"Heaven\"), and Death Cab for Cutie (\"Wheat Like Waves\") have all since followed Springsteen's lead by opening up about their all-male bonds.\n\nIt Ushered In A Wave of Presidential Appropriation\n\nIt's not something that Springsteen will be shouting from the rooftops about. But Born In The U.S.A. — specifically its famously misunderstood title track — essentially ushered in the trend of presidential candidates co-opting chart hits regardless of the artist's political leanings. Indeed, long before the likes of George W. Bush vs. Sting, Sarah Palin vs. Gretchen Peters, and Donald Trump vs. Neil Young and John Fogerty (among many others), The Boss took umbrage with Ronald Reagan's plans to use \"Born In The USA\" for his 1984 reelection campaign.\n\nDespite Springsteen's flat-out refusal, he was still celebrated by Reagan in a stump speech, declaring that America's future \"rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young Americans admire: New Jersey's own Bruce Springsteen.\" And both Pat Buchanan and Bob Dole, also seemingly mistaking its rally cry against the treatment of Vietnam War veterans for a patriotic anthem, cheekily used the track before its writer got wind and shut them down.\n\nIt Revived America's Love Of American Rock\n\nWhile Eagles' Hotel California, Fleetwood Mac's Rumors, and Boston's self-titled debut had all racked up colossal sales in the '70s, Springsteen's commercial opus was the first guitar-oriented U.S. release to achieve similar numbers in the '80s. By the end of the decade, Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction and Journey's Greatest Hits were also approaching the 20 million mark, while Bryan Adams' Reckless, Van Halen's 5150, and Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet were just a few of the domestic rock efforts that immediately followed in its chart-topping footsteps.\n\nAnd while the use of synths brought Springsteen's sound into the '80s, The Boss didn't forget about his earthier roots. Born In The U.S.A. is also steeped in the classic sounds of American rock, from the honky tonk leanings of \"Darlington County\" and rockabilly of \"Workin' On The Highway\" to the front porch folk of \"My Hometown.\" Its lyrical content might not always have been patriotic, but its accompanying music was as American as apple pie.\n\nSongbook: How Bruce Springsteen's Portraits Of America Became Sounds Of Hope During Confusing Times\n\nBon Jovi have officially been in the cultural conversation for five decades — and it looks like we'll never say goodbye.\n\nThe band's self-titled debut album was unleashed upon the world in 1984, and lead single \"Runaway\" made some waves. Yet the New Jersey group didn't truly break through until their third album, the 12 million-selling Slippery When Wet. By the late 1980s, they were arguably the biggest rock band in the world, selling out massive shows in arenas and stadiums.\n\nSince, Bon Jovi releases have consistently topped album charts (six of their studio albums hit No. 1). A big reason for their continued success is that, unlike a majority of their ‘80s peers, frontman Jon Bon Jovi made sure that they adapted to changing times while retaining the spirit of their music — from the anthemic stomp of 1986’s \"Bad Medicine\" to the Nashville crossover of 2005’s \"Who Says You Can’t Go Home.\" It also doesn’t hurt that the 2024 MusiCares Person Of The Year has aged very gracefully; his winning smile and charismatic personality ever crush-worthy.\n\nTheir fifth decade rocking the planet has been marked by many other milestones: The release of a four-part Hulu documentary, \"Thank you, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story\"; Bon Jovi's 16th studio album Forever, and fan hopes for the return of original guitarist Richie Sambora who left unexpectedly in 2013. Despite all of these positive notes, there is an ominous cloud hanging over the group as their singer had to undergo vocal surgery following disappointing, consistently off-key performances on the group's 2022 U.S. tour. Even afterward, he remains unsure whether he’ll be able to tour again. But Bon Jovi remains popular and with Sambora expressing interest in a reunion, it's plausible that we could see them back on stage again somehow.\n\nJon Bon Jovi has also had quite a multifaceted career spun off of his success in music, as shown by the following collection of fascinating facts.\n\nJon Bon Jovi Sung With Bruce Springsteen When He Was 17\n\nBy the time he was in high school, Jon Bongiovi (his original, pre-fame last name) was already fronting his first serious group. The Atlantic City Expressway was a 10-piece with a horn section that performed well-known tunes from Jersey acts like Bruce Springsteen and Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.\n\nThey regularly played The Fast Lane, and one night Bruce Springsteen was in the audience. To Bon Jovi’s surprise, The Boss jumped onstage to join them. The two later became good friends — during his MusiCares performance, Bon Jovi introduced Springsteen as \"my mentor, my friend, my brother, my hero.\"\n\nJon Recorded Bon Jovi’s First Hit Before The Band Formed\n\nAlthough \"Runaway\" was the debut single and lone Top 40 hit from Bon Jovi's first two albums, it was recorded as a professional demo back in 1982.\n\nBon Jovi got a gig as a gopher at Power Station, the famed studio co-owned by his second cousin Tony Bongiovi where artists like the Rolling Stones, Diana Ross, and David Bowie recorded. (He watched even watched Bowie and Freddie Mercury record the vocals for \"Under Pressure.\")\n\nThe future rockstar cut \"Runaway\" (which was co-written mainly by George Karak) and other demos with session musicians — his friend, guitarist Aldo Nova, Rick Springfield/John Waite guitarist Tim Pierce, Springsteen keyboardist Roy Bittan, bassist Hugh McDonald (a future Bon Jovi member), and Scandal drummer Frankie LaRocca. The song first appeared on a WAPP compilation under his name, but then it was placed on Bon Jovi’s debut album. When the video for \"Runway\" was created nearly two years later, members of Bon Jovi were miming to other people’s performances.\n\nAlthough it is a classic, original guitarist Richie Sambora hates it and never wants to play it again.\n\nHe Eloped With His High School Sweetheart In April 1989\n\nDuring the band’s world tour in support of New Jersey, Bon Jovi and Dorothea Hurley spontaneously eloped in a quickie wedding in Vegas. His bandmates and management were shocked to find this out; the latter probably feared that his ineligible bachelor status would harm their popularity with their ardent female fans. But it simply played more into his more wholesome image that differed from other hard rockers of the time.\n\nIn May 2024, Bon Jovi’s son Jake secretly married \"Stranger Things\" actor Millie Bobby Brown. It was like history repeating itself, except this time family was involved.\n\nListen: Revisit Jon Bon Jovi's Greatest Hits & Deep Cuts Ahead Of MusiCares' Person Of The Year 2024 Gala\n\nThe Bongiovi Family Is Part Of The Bon Jovi Family\n\nBack in the ‘80s, parents often didn’t like their kids’ music. However, Bon Jovi’s parents completely supported his. Mother Carol Bongiovi often chaperoned his early days when he was an underaged kid playing local clubs and bars in New Jersey. Father Jon Sr. was the group’s hair stylist until their third album, Slippery When Wet. He created his son's signature mane.\n\nJon’s brother Matthew started as a production assistant in the band’s organization, then worked for their management before becoming his brother’s head of security and now his tour manager. His other brother Anthony became the director of a few Bon Jovi concert films and promo clips. He’s also directed concert films for Slayer and the Goo Goo Dolls.\n\nBon Jovi Is A Regular In Television & Film\n\nAfter writing songs for the Golden Globe-winning \"Young Guns II soundtrack (released as the solo album Blaze Of Glory) and getting a cameo in the Western’s opening, Bon Jovi was bitten by the acting bug. He studied with acclaimed acting coach Harold Guskin in the early ‘90s, then appeared as the romantic interest of Elizabeth Perkins in 1995's Moonlight and Valentino.\n\nIn other movies, Bon Jovi played a bartender who’s a recovering alcoholic (Little City), an ex-con turning over a new leaf (Row Your Boat), a failed father figure (Pay It Forward), a suburban dad and pot smoker (Homegrown), and a Navy Lieutenant in WWII (U-571). The band’s revival in 2000 slowed his acting aspirations, but he appeared for 10 episodes of \"Ally McBeal,\" playing her love interest in 2002.\n\nElsewhere on the silver screen, the singer has also portrayed a vampire hunter (Vampiros: Los Muertos), a duplicitous professor (Cry Wolf), the owner of a women’s hockey team (Pucked), and a rock star willing to cancel a tour for the woman he loves (New Year’s Eve). He hasn’t acted since 2011, but who knows when he might make a guest appearance?\n\nIn 2004, Bon Jovi became one of the co-founders and co-majority owner of the Philadelphia Soul, which were part of the Arena Football League (AFL). (Sambora was a minority shareholder.) The team name emerged in a satirical scene from \"It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia\" during which Danny DeVito’s character tries to buy the team for a paltry sum and twice butchers the singer’s name.\n\nJon stuck with the team until 2009, a year after they won Arena Bowl XXII, defeating the San Jose SaberCats. He then set his eyes on a bigger prize, the Buffalo Bills, aligning himself with a group of Toronto investors in 2011. One of his biggest competitors? Donald Trump, who ran a smear campaign alleging that the famed singer would move the team to Toronto.\n\nIn the end, neither man purchased the team as they were outbid by Terry and Kim Pegula, who still own the Bills today.\n\nJon & Richie Sambora Wrote Songs For Other Artists\n\nHaving cranked out massive hits with songwriter Desmond Child, Bon Jovi and Sambora decided to write or co-write songs for and with other artists.\n\nIn 1987, they co-wrote and produced the Top 20 hit \"We All Sleep Alone\" with Child for Cher, and also co-wrote the Top 40 hit \"Notorious\" with members of Loverboy. In 1989, the duo paired up again Loverboy guitarist Paul Dean for his solo rocker \"Under The Gun\" and bequeathed the New Jersey outtake \"Does Anybody Really Fall in Love Anymore?\" (co-written with Child and Diane Warren) to Cher.\n\nThe Bon Jovi/Sambora song \"Peace In Our Time\" was recorded by Russian rockers Gorky Park. In 1990, Paul Young snagged the New Jersey leftover \"Now and Forever,\" while the duo penned \"If You Were in My Shoes\" with Young, though neither song was released. In 2009, Bon Jovi and Sambora were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame for their contributions to music.\n\nJon Bon Jovi Once Ran His Own Record Label\n\nFor a brief time in 1991, he ran his own record label, Jambco, which was distributed through Bon Jovi’s label PolyGram Records. The only two artists he signed were Aldo Nova and Billy Falcon, a veteran singer/songwriter who became Bon Jovi's songwriting partner in the 2000s. Neither of their albums (Aldo Nova’s Blood On The Bricks and Billy Falcon’s Pretty Blue World) were big sellers, and the label folded quickly when they began losing money.\n\nStill, the experience gave Bon Jovi the chance to learn about the music business. That experience helped after he fired original manager Doc McGhee in 1991 and took over his band’s managerial reins until 2015.\n\nBon Jovi's Vocal Issues Aren't New\n\nAlthough Jon Bon Jovi's vocal problems have become a major issue recently, they stem back to the late 1980s. It's doubtful as to whether Jon had proper vocal training for a rock band at the start.\n\nThe group did 15-month tours to support both the Slippery When Wet and New Jersey albums. Near the end of the grueling Slippery tour, Bon Jovi was getting steroid injections because his voice was suffering.\n\nWhile his voice held up into the 2000s, it has become apparent over the last decade that his singing is rougher than it used to be. As shown in the Hulu new documentary, the singer has been struggling to maintain his voice. It’s natural for older rock singers to lose some range — it’s been very rare to hear him sing any of the high notes in \"Livin’ On A Prayer\" over the last 20 years — but he admitshe is unsure whether he can ever tour again, even with recent surgery.\n\nBon Jovi Has Been A Philanthropist For Over Three Decades\n\nBack in the 1980s, the upbeat Bon Jovi made it clear that they were not going to be a toned-down political band. But in the ‘90s, he and the band toned down their look, evolved their sound, and offered a more mature outlook on life.\n\nReflecting this evolved viewpoint, the band started an annual tradition of playing a December concert in New Jersey to raise money for various charitable causes; the concert series began in 1991 and continued with the band or Jon solo through at least 2015. The group have played various charitable concert events over the years including the Twin Towers Relief Benefit, Live 8 in Philadelphia, and The Concert For Sandy Relief.\n\nBy the late 2000s, Jon and Dorothea founded the JBJ Soul Kitchen to serve meals at lower costs to people who cannot afford them. COVID-19 related food shortages led the couple to found the JBJ Soul Kitchen Food Bank. Their JBJ Soul Foundation supports affordable housing and has rebuilt and refurbished homes through organizations like Project H.O.M.E., Habitat For Humanity, and Rebuilding Together.\n\nWhile he may be a superstar, Jon Bon Jovi still believes in helping others. For his considerable efforts, he was honored as the 2024 MusiCares Person Of The Year during 2024 GRAMMY Week.\n\nListen: Revisit Jon Bon Jovi's Greatest Hits & Deep Cuts Ahead Of MusiCares' Person Of The Year 2024 Gala\n\nThe rock scene may no longer be the dominant force it once was — blink-182's One More Time... is the only Billboard 200 chart-topper this year to predominantly fall under this category. But 2023 has still been an interesting and eventful period for those who like their guitar music turned up to eleven.\n\nOver the past 12 months, we've had the two biggest groups of the Swinging Sixties returning to the fray in style, a new European invasion, and a wave of blockbuster albums that may well go down as modern classics. And then there's the revivals which will no doubt spark nostalgia in any kids of the 2000s, a resurgence in all-star line-ups, and a residency that could possibly change how we experience live music.\n\nAs we gear up for the holiday season, here's a look at 10 trends that defined rock music in 2023.\n\nEuropean Rock Traveled To America\n\nFrom Lacuna Coil and Gojira to Volbeat and Rammstein, the Billboard charts aren't exactly strangers to European rock. But 2023 was the year when the continent appeared to band together for a mini invasion. Italian quartet Måneskin continued their remarkable journey from Eurovision Song Contest winners to bona fide rock gods with a Best New Artist nod at the 2023 GRAMMYs, a top 20 placing on the Billboard 200 albums chart for third album Rush!, and a Best Rock Video win at the MTV VMAs.\n\nMasked metalers Ghost scored a fourth consecutive Top 10 entry on the Billboard 200 with covers EP Phantomime, also landing a Best Metal Performance GRAMMY nomination for its cover of Iron Maiden's \"Phantom of the Opera,\" (alongside Disturbed's \"Bad Man,\" Metallica's \"72 Seasons,\" Slipknot's \"Hive Mind,\" and Spiritbox's \"Jaded\"). While fellow Swedes Avatar bagged their first Mainstream Rock No. 1 with \"The Dirt I'm Buried In,\" a highly melodic meditation on mortality which combines funky post-punk with freewheeling guitar solos that sound like they've escaped from 1980s Sunset Strip.\n\nAge Proved To Be Nothing But A Number\n\nThe theory that rock and roll is a young man's game was blown apart in 2023. Fronted by 80-year-old Mick Jagger, The Rolling Stones reached No.3 on the Billboard 200 thanks to arguably their finest album in 40 years, Hackney Diamonds, with lead single \"Angry\" also picking up a Best Rock Song GRAMMY nod alongside Olivia Rodrigo's \"aallad of a homeschooled girl,\" Queens of the Stone Age's \"Emotion Sickness,\" Boygenius' \"Not Strong Enough,\" and Foo Fighters' \"Rescued.\" (The latter two will also battle it out with Arctic Monkeys' \"Sculpture of Anything Goes,\" Black Pumas' \"More than a Love Song,\" and Metallica's \"Lux Aeterna\" for Best Rock Performance.)\n\nThe eternally shirtless Iggy Pop, a relative spring chicken at 76, delivered a late-career classic, too, with the star-studded Every Loser. And Bruce Springsteen, KISS, and Paul McCartney all proved they weren't ready for the slippers and cocoa life yet by embarking on lengthy world tours.\n\nDeath Was No Barrier To Hits\n\nJimmy Buffett sadly headed for that tropical paradise in the sky this year. But having already recorded 32nd studio effort, Equal Strain on All Parts, the margarita obsessive was able to posthumously score his first new entry on the Billboard Rock Chart since 1982's \"It's Midnight And I'm Not Famous Yet.\"\n\nBut he isn't the only artist to have recently achieved success from beyond the grave. Linkin Park reached the U.S. Top 40 with \"Lost,\" a track recorded for 2003 sophomore Meteora, but which only saw the light of day six years after frontman Chester Bennington's passing.\n\nPerhaps most unexpectedly of all, The Beatles topped the U.K. charts for the first time since 1969 thanks to \"Now and Then,\" a psychedelic tear-jerker in which surviving members McCartney and Ringo Starr brought previously unheard recordings from George Harrison and John Lennon back to life.\n\nThe Giants Stayed Giant\n\nFoo Fighters also overcame the death of a core member on what many rock fans would consider this year's most eagerly awaited album. Drummer Taylor Hawkins, who passed away in early 2022, doesn't feature on the poignant but vibrant But Here We Are. Yet the two-time GRAMMY nominated LP still proved to be a fitting tribute as well as an encouraging sign that Dave Grohl and co. can extend their legacy:lead single \"Rescued\" became their 12th number one on Billboard's Main Rock Chart.\n\nThe Best Rock Album category for the 2024 GRAMMYs proves that veterans were alive and mighty in 2023. Along with the Foos' latest LP, the nominees include another Grohl-affiliated band,, Queens of the Stone Age's first album in six years, In Times New Roman..., Paramore's This Is Why, Metallica's 72 Seasons and Greta Van Fleet's Starcatcher.. (Metallica's 72 Seasons also struck gold with its singles, three of which landed at No. 1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, where lead single \"Lux Æterna\" spent 11 consecutive weeks on top.)\n\nOf course, we also have to give a shout-out to U2. Not for March's Songs of Surrender album (for which they re-recorded 40 of their biggest and best tracks), but for the immersive, eye-popping Las Vegas residency at The Sphere which potentially reinvented the future of live music.\n\nThe Rock Supergroup Continued To Thrive\n\n2023 spawned several new rock supergroups including Mantra of the Cosmos (Shaun Ryder, Zak Starkey and Andy Bell), Lol Tolhurst x Budgie x Jacknife Lee, and Better Lovers (various members of The Dillinger Escape Plan and Every Time I Die). But it was an already established all-star line-up that took the GRAMMY nominations by storm.\n\nConsisting of Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker, boygenius bagged a remarkable seven nods at the 2024 ceremony. Throw in a well-received headline set at Coachella, U.S. Top 50 follow-up EP, and even a \"Saturday Night Live\" showing alongside Timothée Chalamet, and the trio couldn't have asked for a better way to continue what they started together in 2018.\n\nThe Early 2000s Enjoyed A Revival\n\nThe cyclical nature of the music industry meant that the era of choppy bangs and super-skinny jeans was always going to come back into fashion. And following throwbacks from the likes of Olivia Rodrigo and Willow, the original punk-pop brigade returned this year to prove they could still mosh with the best of them.\n\nPossibly the defining nasal voice of his generation, Tom DeLonge headed back into the studio with blink-182 for the first time in 12 years, with the resulting One More Time... topping the Billboard 200. Linkin Park (\"Lost\"), Papa Roach (\"Cut the Line\"), and a reunited Staind (\"Lowest in Me\") all scored No. 1s on the Mainstream Rock Airplay Chart, while Sum 41, Bowling For Soup, and Good Charlotte were just a few of the high school favorites who helped cement When We Were Young as the millennial's dream festival.\n\nThe Emo Scene Went Back To Its Roots\n\nAfter channeling the new wave and synth-pop of the 1980s on predecessor After Laughter, Paramore returned from a six-year absence with a record which harked back to their mid-2000s beginnings. But it wasn't their own feisty brand of punk-pop that Best Rock Album GRAMMY nominee This Is Why resembled. Instead, its nervy indie rock took its cues, as frontwoman Hayley Williams freely admits, from touring buddies Bloc Party.\n\nParamore weren't the only emo favorites to rediscover their roots. Fall Out Boy reunited with Under the Cork Tree producer Neal Avron and old label Fueled By Ramen on the dynamic So Much (for) Stardust. And while Taking Back Sunday further veered away from their signature sound, the Long Islanders still embraced the past by naming seventh LP 152 after the North Carolina highway stretch they used to frequent as teens.\n\nCountry Artists Tapped Into Rock Sensibilities\n\nWe're used to seeing rock musicians going a little bit country: see everyone from Steven Tyler and Bon Jovi to Darius Rucker and Aaron Lewis. But the opposite direction is usually rarer. In 2023, however, it seemed as though every Nashville favorite was suddenly picking up the air guitar.\n\nZach Bryan repositioned himself as Gen-Z's answer to Bruce Springsteen with the heartland rock of his eponymous Billboard 200 chart-topper (which is up for Best Country Album at the 2024 GRAMMYs alongside Kelsea Ballerini's Rolling Up the Welcome Mat, Brothers Osborne's self-titled LP, Tyler Childers' Rustin' in the Rain, and Lainey Wilson's Bell Bottom Country). Meanwhile, Hitmaker HARDY — who first cut his teeth penning hits for Florida Georgia Line and Blake Shelton — leaned into the sounds of hard rock and nu-metal on his second studio LP, The Mockingbird & the Crow.\n\nBut few committed more to the crossover than the one of country's greatest living legends. Dolly Parton roped in a whole host of hellraisers and headbangers including Richie Sambora, Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, and Rob Halford, for the 30-track Rockstar — her first rock-oriented project of her glittering 49-album career.\n\nPost-Grunge Reunions Were Abundant\n\nFans of the mopey '90s scene known as post-grunge had all their dreams come true this year thanks to several unexpected reunions. Turn-of-the-century chart-toppers Staind and Matchbox Twenty both returned with new albums after more than a decade away. Creed, meanwhile, announced they'd be headlining next year's Summer of '99 cruise after a similar amount of time out of the spotlight.\n\nThe insatiable appetite for all things nostalgia, of course, means that any band — no matter how fleeting their fame — can stage a lucrative comeback. Take Dogstar, for example, the unfashionable outfit boasting Hollywood nice guy Keanu Reeves. Twenty-three years after appearing to call it a day, the Los Angeles trio surprised everyone by hitting the Bottlerock Napa Valley Festival before dropping a belated third LP, Somewhere Between the Power Lines and Palm Trees and embarking on a headlining national tour.\n\nThe New Generation Gave The Old Their Dues\n\nSay what you want about today's musical generation, but they know to pay respect where it's due., Olivia Rodrigo, for example, doffed her cap to '90s alt-rock favorites The Breeders by inviting them to open on her 2024 world tour.\n\nNew working-class hero Sam Fender invited fellow Newcastle native Brian Johnson to perform two AC/DC classics at his hometown stadium show. While ever-changing Japanese kawaii metalers Babymetal debuted their latest incarnation on \"Metali,\" a collaboration with one of their musical idols, Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello.\n\nWhether new artists are teaming up with the old or veterans are continuing to receive their flowers, 2023 proved that rock is alive and well.\n\n2023 In Review: 5 Trends That Defined Hip-Hop\n\nSeventeen years ago, Brian Fallon and the rest of the Gaslight Anthem — guitarist Alex Rosamilia, bassist Alex Levine, and drummer Benny Horowitz — were just trying to hold onto the dream.\n\nNew Jersey’s communal culture of DIY punk brought them years of friendship and freedom from square jobs, but entering their late 20s, Fallon and co. had played in countless bands that flamed out or left them unfulfilled. Formed in 2006, the Gaslight Anthem was their final shot. \"That’s why we called our first record Sink or Swim,\" Fallon tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nThey swam. That 2007 debut signaled a sea change: In the early 2000s, punk bands were not repping Bruce Springsteen. They were absolutely not namechecking Tom Petty. Here was a punk band from the same streets as the Misfits, Bouncing Souls, and My Chemical Romance, writing great songs draped in the Americana of their parents’ generation. By the time the Boss himself joined Gaslight onstage at Glastonbury Festival 2009, their sophomore album The ‘59 Sound had made them one of the world’s most acclaimed new rock bands.\n\nThe Gaslight Anthem mined its tried and true sound for two more albums,but half a decade of non-stop touring and creative pressure was starting to take its toll. 2014’s Get Hurt, a moodier record inspired by Fallon’s recent divorce, received mixed reviews. A year later, the band was on ice. They reformed in 2018 to perform 10-year anniversary shows for The ‘59 Sound but disappeared soon after. Fallon released singer/songwriter-oriented solo albums into the 2020s and kept in touch with his old bandmates, but it wasn’t the same.\n\nOn Oct. 27, the Gaslight Anthem releases History Books, its first album in nine years. It’s an earthy, battle-tested rock record from a veteran band that sounds hungry again, their first self-released album after an amicable split with Island Records. The title track features a duet with Bruce Springsteen, the pair’s first studio collaboration after years of friendship.\n\nGRAMMY.com caught up with Fallon to discuss what years of (humble) rock stardom brought him: a hard-earned appreciation for Gaslight Anthem’s past and a new understanding of the demons rattling in his brain.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nWhat made you want to get the band back together?\n\nI don’t think it was anything other than being inspired to write. I wouldn’t say that being inside for two years didn’t have a hand in that. At some point, you’re sitting there thinking to yourself, I had this band and we played big shows. It’s fun. A lot of people like it. It sounds like a good idea… I gotta do this. I have something else to say.\n\nWhen the band was inactive, how much did the four of you stay in touch?\n\nWe don’t call each other every day, but we stayed current on the things going on in everybody’s life.\n\nThe whole thing is more about being friends. We’ve been through things no one else has seen. We’ve slept on floors in another country in a youth center with bugs crawling on you when you’re sleeping. And the only people that understand that are those other three.\n\nIt’s been almost a decade since Gaslight Anthem released its last album, Get Hurt. Now that there’s some space to look back on it, why do you think the band went its separate ways after that album?\n\nWe all felt that strain. In 2015, you couldn’t really say, as a musician, \"Hey, I need to not be on tour because I’m going crazy. I need to sort my mental health out.\" People would just be like, \"We’re going onto the next band. Bye. Your career is over.\"\n\nSo when we pulled the plug, everyone was like, \"Why are you doing this?\" Well, so we don’t die. So we don’t hate ourselves, that’s why. We knew it wasn’t the band. We knew it wasn’t each other. I think we just needed to stop the landslide.\n\nDo you think this had to do with being in the major label ecosystem? You came up releasing albums on punk rock labels, so I’m interested how you think it all compares.\n\nI would love to sit here and tell you that the pressure is only in the major label world and that it’s the evil major label corporate overlords who do this to bands, but it is absolutely not. It comes from the smallest indie label of some dude in his basement, all the way up. My experience on majors was maybe even a little more sensitive. If you’re running a small label and you have excitement built up, you’re like, \"Whoa! This is working on a big level!\" You’re so excited that you’re like, \"You gotta do this! You gotta do that!\"\n\nI’m not saying any of the labels we were on were like, \"You gotta do this!,\" but there was definitely, \"Well, if you don’t play this radio show, they’re not gonna play your record.\"\n\nNow, people are a little more in tune to what’s going on, but [10 to 15 years ago] for sure, it was like, this is your only opportunity ever! Well, no, it’s not the only opportunity ever. There’s other opportunities.\n\nDid it feel like people knew what to do with you at Island Records?\n\nWe had a real big champion at the time in the president, David Massey. He was the person who signed us. Bon Jovi and U2 had been on Island for a while and contemporary to us, was the Killers. Every time the Killers did something good, it gave us a little more freedom because they were the other rock band on the label. We liked [the Killers] and they liked us. They covered one of our songs [\"American Slang\"] at one of their shows in New York [in 2017]. It was like having a big brother on the label, paving a path.\n\nWhen we got back together, we weren't really on Island, but they could have made us make a record [for Island]. We don’t own anything. I don’t own [the masters for] Sink or Swim. I don’t own ‘59 Sound. Nothing. So we wanted to own it, now. We wanted to do our own label, with [independent distribution company] Thirty Tigers, where it’s much more of, \"You’re the label, you make the decisions.\"\n\nHow did \"History Books\" with Bruce come together?\n\nI’m not one to shoot my shot, so to speak. Which has not been great for my career, I guess. But if somebody wants to do something for you, let them do it, you know? I never asked Bruce for anything.\n\nWe were talking and I was saying, \"Yeah, we’re putting the band back together and working on some songs.\" He just said, \"Why don’t you write a duet for us?\" I was like, \"What? Alright!\" You have to understand that, for me, sitting here and saying, \"Why don’t you whip up a duet for me and Bruce Springsteen?\" – that to me is like saying, \"Why don’t I write a book for Ernest Hemingway? Why don’t I write Jimi Hendrix a guitar solo?\"\n\nSo I went away and I would say to myself, Alright, the next one is for Bruce. I’ll write the next song for Bruce. I just kept writing the songs to get them out, without the pressure. And at the end of it all, I just said, \"Which song would Bruce sound good singing on?\" Everybody just said \"History Books.\" Cool! And then we sent it to him.\n\nWhat did he say when you sent him the song?\n\nHe said, \"Cool, I’ll get it done.\" He was in Dublin on tour and he just did it.\n\nAfter knowing him all these years, why do you think now was the time he proposed writing a song together?\n\nWith the band back and writing new material, it was just the right time. I don’t think there was a time before this where it would have been good for us to have done.\n\nNow, we’ve gone down a path enough to where we can embrace Bruce, New Jersey, our influences. We’re able to comfortably have that be our home.\n\nWhen you’re around Bruce, do you get nervous?\n\nImagine you’re seven years old, you’re reading your comic books, and then all of a sudden Batman jumps out of the comic book in your room and goes, \"Hey, you wanna go fight crime tonight?\" It’s insane to be in the presence of a person that’s that famous, and that influential to you. It’s not a thing a normal person can comprehend. And I can not comprehend this.\n\nReading the lyrics to this album, I thought you were referencing your mental health a lot. Can you share what's been going on during the several years of your life?\n\nIt feels like everybody in America’s got things on their mind, especially the last couple years. I got to a point where the days felt like they were harder than they should have been. It’s like pushing a rock up a hill when you’re doing that every day, and you get tired. You’re dealing with stuff in your mind that you can’t quite… there’s not an event that causes you to feel a certain way. There’s no cause, so you can’t predict it. And that becomes extremely frustrating.\n\nYou turn to other things, or you get help and say, I don’t think I can do this on my own. I need someone else alongside me.\" That’s the point I got to. I got a therapist. There’s not a special rockstar line that people call, or if there is, I don’t have that number. I just went to the doctor and said, \"I don’t feel right.\"\n\nDid these feelings get buried during Gaslight Anthem’s more active years, only to come out during the pandemic when things got quieter?\n\nI think it was coming anyway. Whether there was time to deal with it or not. The band slowing down before the pandemic was part of that, needing some time and space. That was why the band stopped, because it was like a steamroller. It’s like you have another mental illness, which is the anxiety of the pressure of feeling like you have to be excited. And that’s where the tidal wave starts… You feel guilty ‘cause you’re like, \"I should be grateful. I’m in a band.\" And you are grateful, but you’re also struggling, and it’s freaking hard!\n\n[Mental health] comes up a lot in the song \"Positive Charge\"… I wrote it about that struggle. But this isn’t the mental health record. I’ve been writing long enough where I can steer the boat so it’s not a diary entry anymore.\n\nBack in 2021, you played a fundraiser in New Jersey alongside Jon Bon Jovi and Johnny Rzeznik from the Goo Goo Dolls. What was that like?\n\nWe were doing a benefit for the reelection of the Governor of New Jersey [Democrat Phil Murphy]. Jon Bon Jovi reached out to my manager and wanted me to play. Whoopi Goldberg was hosting. Insane stuff.\n\nJon Bon Jovi wanted to meet for dinner beforehand. At the same time, I was really thinking about the band. On the way in the car, I said to my wife, \"I think I wanna get the band back together.\" I had not spoken of this prior, so this blew her mind.\n\nWe sit down at the table, and it’s Jon Bon Jovi and John Rzeznik. I didn’t expect them to be familiar with my band, because they’re giant songwriters. They were just genuinely interested in what we had done, talking about the songs they liked. When we left, my wife was like, \"That’s a sign. If there’s a sign, that’s a sign.\"\n\nI’ve met famous people who are completely off the planet. They’re just not interested in having a normal conversation. They just revel in the absurdity of their fame. I could relate to [Bon Jovi and Rzeznik] because the one common denominator is we all came from nothing. And now we’re in bands that achieved some amount of success.\n\nOn New Album 'Jonny,' The Drums' Jonny Pierce Is Finished \"Setting Myself Up To Lose\"\n\nEd Sheeran takes fans behind the curtain of his personal life and struggles with mental health in Ed Sheeran: The Sum of It All. The four-episode docuseries, which is now streaming on Disney+, details the pain of losing his best friend Jamal Edwards and his wife Cherry Seaborn receiving a cancer diagnosis while she was pregnant with their daughter Jupiter.\n\n\"What I think is really great about the documentary is the themes that it explores, everyone goes through,\" Sheeran said at the New York City premiere on May 2, according to the Hollywood Reporter. \"Everyone goes through grief. Everyone goes through ups and downs of their mental health.\"\n\nSheeran dives deeper into his struggles — and is more vulnerable than ever before — on his latest album Subtract, which arrived on May 5. \"Running from the light/ Engulfed in darkness/ Sharing my eyes/ Wondering why I'm stuck on the borderline,\" he sings on album cut \"Borderline,\" which touches on battling suicide thoughts.\n\nLewis Capaldi\n\nLike Sheeran, Scottish singer Lewis Capaldi also gave fans an incredibly upfront look at his mental health challenges in a documentary, How I'm Feeling Now. The new Netflix release details his experience with anxiety and Tourette's syndrome, taking viewers to physical therapy with Capaldi and discussing how his medication both helps and hurts the quality of his life.\n\nCapaldi's second album, Broken By Desire To Be Heavenly Sent (due May 19) will further explore his anxieties and vulnerability. While he has admitted it wasn't easy to be so raw in his music and on screen, Capaldi wants to make a difference in other people's lives. \"If people notice things that are concurrent with what's going on in their life, then it's all been worth it,\" he told Variety.\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nWhile Billie Eilish's music has been raw and real from the start, her music has become increasingly more vulnerable throughout the years. Whether in her music or in interviews, the star has opened up about dealing with body dysmorphia, depression and thoughts of self-harm — hoping to inspire fans to speak up when they are hurting, and to know that it gets better.\n\n\"It doesn't make you weak to ask for help,\" she asserts in a 2019 video for Ad Council's Seize The Awkward campaign, which features stars discussing mental health.\n\n\"Kids use my songs as a hug,\" she told Rolling Stone earlier that year. \"Songs about being depressed or suicidal or completely just against-yourself — some adults think that's bad, but I feel that seeing that someone else feels just as horrible as you do is a comfort. It's a good feeling.\"\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nAs one of the most-followed stars on social media, Selena Gomez has often used her formidable presence to discuss her mental health and connect with others. In 2022, the singer launched a startup called Wondermind, which is focused on \"mental fitness\" and helping users maintain strong mental health.\n\nJust a few months later, Gomez further chronicled her own mental health journey in an Apple TV+ documentary, Selena Gomez: My Mind and Me, which shows extremes she's suffered with her depression and bipolar disorder. She has said she was initially hesitant to share the film, but ultimately reflected on how many others could be helped if she did.\n\n\"Because I have the platform I have, it's kind of like I'm sacrificing myself a little bit for a greater purpose,\" she explained in a 2022 cover story with Rolling Stone. \"I don't want that to sound dramatic, but I almost wasn't going to put this out. God's honest truth, a few weeks ago, I wasn't sure I could do it.\"\n\nShawn Mendes\n\nIn 2019, Shawn Mendes first publicly addressed his struggles with anxiety in the dynamic — and GRAMMY-nominated — hit \"In My Blood.\" Three years later, the singer postponed his 2022 tour in order to focus on his mental health, opening up an important conversation to his legion of fans.\n\n\"The process was very difficult,\" he said in a February interview with Wall Street Journal. \"A lot of doing therapy, a lot of trying to understand how I was feeling and what was making me feel that way. And then doing the work to help myself and heal. And also leaning on people in my life to help a little bit.\n\n\"It's been a lot of work, but I think the last year and a half has been the most eye-opening and growing and beautiful and just healing process of my life,\" he continued. \"And it just really made me see how culture is really starting to get to a place where mental health is really becoming a priority.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen\n\nEven an artist as successful and celebrated as Bruce Springsteen has faced depression. In his 2016 autobiography Born to Run, the 20-time GRAMMY winner cites a difficult relationship with his father and a history of mental illness in the family, sharing that he has sought treatment throughout his life.\n\n\"I was crushed between 60 and 62, good for a year, and out again from 63 to 64,\" he wrote in the book. In that time, he released his 2012 album, Wrecking Ball, which featured a raw track called \"This Depression.\" \"Baby, I've been down, but never this down I've been lost, but never this lost,\" he sings on the opening verse.\n\nAs his wife, Patti Scialfa, told Vanity Fair in 2016, \"He approached the book the way he would approach writing a song…A lot of his work comes from him trying to overcome that part of himself.\"\n\nJanet Jackson\n\nThe physical and emotional abuse suffered by the famous Jackson family is well-documented in books, documentaries and TV dramatizations. But it's only been in recent years that Janet Jackson has talked about her own depression, which she has referred to as \"intense.\" Her son Aissa has helped her heal from mental health challenges that have followed her all of her life.\n\n\"In my 40s, like millions of women in the world, I still heard voices inside my head berating me, voices questioning my value,\" she wrote in a 2020 ESSENCE cover story. \"Happiness was elusive. A reunion with old friends might make me happy. A call from a colleague might make me happy. But because sometimes I saw my failed relationships as my fault, I easily fell into despair.\"\n\nElle King\n\nAfter seeing global success with her debut single, \"Ex's & Oh's,\" Elle King experienced the woes of sudden fame as well as a crumbling marriage. Her second album, 2018's Shake the Spirit, documented her struggles with self-doubt, medicinal drinking and PTSD.\n\n\"There's two ways out,\" she told PEOPLE in 2018, describing her marriage as \"destructive,\" physically abusive and leading her to addiction. \"You can take the bad way out or you can get help. I got help because I knew that I have felt good in my life and I knew I could get there again.\"\n\nBrendon Urie\n\nCertain public situations can trigger crippling anxiety attacks for Brendon Urie, who has been open about mental health concerns throughout his career. He can perform in front of thousands of fans, but he's revealed that being in the grocery store or stuck in an elevator for too long with other people are among some of his most uncomfortable scenarios in his life.\n\n\"You would never tell on the surface, but inside it's so painful I can't even describe,\" the former Panic! At The Disco frontman — who disbanded the group earlier this year to focus on his family — said in a 2016 interview with Kerrang.\n\nBig Sean\n\nRapper Big Sean and his mother released a series of educational videos during Mental Health Awareness Month in 2021 — two years after the Detroit-born star started talking about his own long-held depression and anxiety publicly.\n\n\"I was just keeping it real because I was tired of not keeping it real,\" he said in an interview with ESSENCE in 2021. \"I was tired of pretending I was a machine and everything was cool and being politically correct or whatever. I just was like, I'm a just say how I feel.\"\n\nLike many of his peers, he hopes that his honesty will help others. \"Whatever they can apply to their life and better themselves and maybe it just even starts a whole journey in a different direction as far as upgrading and taking care of themselves and bossing up themselves,\" he added. \"Whatever they're trying to do, I hope it helps them get to that place.\"\n\nHow Durand Jones' Debut Album 'Wait Til I Get Over' Helped Him Explore His Roots & Find Self-Acceptance"
