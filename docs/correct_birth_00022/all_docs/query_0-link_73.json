He has released twenty studio albums, many of which feature his backing band, the E Street Band. Originally from the Jersey Shore, he is one of the originators of the heartland rock style of music, combining mainstream rock musical style with narrative songs about working class American life. During a career that has spanned five decades, Springsteen has become known for his poetic, socially conscious lyrics and energetic stage performances, sometimes lasting up to four hours in length. He has been nicknamed \"the Boss\".\n\n#BruceSpringsteen #TheRollingStones #EricClapton #littleredrooster #MickJagger #KeithRichards #BrianJones #WillieDixon #BillWyman #CharlieWatts #RonnieWood #jagger #keef #Clapton #RollingStones #deltablues #chicagoblues #legends #legendary #guitarist #guitarplayer #harmonica #bluesguitar #fender #stratocaster #guitars #electricguitar #bluesmusic #blues #Rockhistation\n\nvia: @ucoofficial @rockhistation @springsteen\".",
