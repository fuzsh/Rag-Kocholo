        "text": "The Boss's birthday, September 23rd, will be formally recognized as Bruce Springsteen Day in his home state of NJ.\n\nNEW JERSEY — Mid-September is usually associated with the beginning of fall, but a new proclamation stamps Sept. 23 as \"Bruce Springsteen Day\" in New Jersey.\n\nThe Shore's favorite son was born on that day, and Gov. Phil Murphy has signed a proclamation to further cement his name in Jersey history (see below).\n\n“Bruce Springsteen will forever be remembered as the voice of the Garden State, signaling to the world that New Jerseyans were born to run,\" Murphy's proclamation says.\n\n\"The Boss\" was born in Long Branch and raised in Freehold — and had Asbury Park stamped on debut studio album. Springsteen's impact on American music and culture are undeniable, and he continues touring with the iconic E Street Band. But he is also known for his charitable contributions and service work in New Jersey and around the country, as Murphy noted.\n\nThe proclamation is full of references to Springsteen songs and history, and Murphy also notes the honors the Boss has received: a planet named after him, a Presidential Medal of Freedom and National Medal of the Arts, an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and millions and millions of records sold.\n\n“Bruce Springsteen is one of the most recognizable, iconic and influential musicians – and New Jerseyans – of all time,” Murphy said. “It is important that we recognize Bruce for all he has done and will continue to do, from giving us the gift of his music to lending his time to the causes close to his heart, including making the Archives and Center for American Music a repository that will inspire tomorrow’s songwriters and singers. We thank him for showing the world what it means to live our New Jersey values. I am both honored and proud to declare his birthday Bruce Springsteen Day in New Jersey.”\n\nMurphy presented the proclamation at the American Music Honors, which took place at the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University on April 15.\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
