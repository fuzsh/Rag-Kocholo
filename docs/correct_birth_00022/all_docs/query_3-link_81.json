        "text": "Song Title Running Time Release\n\n100 MILES FROM JACKSON uncirculating\n\nNote: Uncirculated track, recorded October 26, 1983 at The Hit Factory.\n\nA GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND (PITTSBURGH) - V1 3:40 private A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND (PITTSBURGH) - V2 3:12 TRACKS\n\nNote: V1 is a Colts Neck band rehearsal from April 1982. Very similar to the final take, slightly slower with some lyrical variation. V2 is the result of two days at the Power Station on May 5 and 6, 1982.\n\nFIST FULL OF DOLLARS - V1 3:44 FFOD / HNWB / MT2 FIST FULL OF DOLLARS - V2 2:24 FFOD / HNWB ATLANTIC CITY - V3 1:40 FFOD / HNWB ATLANTIC CITY - V4 take 1 uncirculating ATLANTIC CITY - V5 - take 4 4:00 LM-1 ATLANTIC CITY - V6a - take 3 3:56 NEBRASKA / GREATEST / ESSENTIAL / BESTOF ATLANTIC CITY - V6b - take 3 - stereo mix 3:43 NEBRASKA ATLANTIC CITY - V7 uncirculating\n\nNote: Two demos (V1 & V2) were recorded in April 1981, under the title \"Fist Full Of Dollars\", but they also had quite a few verses written, all about Atlantic City. You can hear him turning pages of his notebook as he worked on them. Some lyrics would remain for \"Atlantic City\", including the opening lines \"Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night / Now that town sets in for a fight.\"\n\nThe story continues in late 1981, still at Colts Neck with V3. The lyrics are getting into shape; The rest is Bruce trying variations of the chorus. V4, V5 and V6 were recorded on his Portastudio at Colts Neck during a two-week period, December 17 to January 3, 1982, with V6 take 3 chosen for Nebraska. Take 1, V4 is the only outtake from this session. In a letter to Jon Landau, Springsteen noted that \"this song should probably be done with the whole band really rockin' out.\" And indeed, Bruce went into the studio for two weeks from late April 1982 and spent the first day working on \"Atlantic City\", and a number of takes were cut at the Power Station over three days on April 26–28, 1982. However these recordings remain unheard; information from various sources suggests this was with the band, but we can't confirm.\n\nBABY I'M SO COLD (Turn The Lights Down Low) - V1 3:46 LM-10 BABY I'M SO COLD - V2 4:02 private BABY I'M SO COLD - V3 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1 is a solo acoustic demo recorded between September 1981 and April 1982 at Bruce's house at Colts Neck. He used the same melody he composed for \"Follow That Dream\", with lyrics lifted from \"Loose Ends\", and some that would end up in \"Janey Don't You Lose Heart\". V2 is a fascinating band rehearsal from Colts Neck dated after V1, but in the same time period, still using the borrowed melody from \"Follow That Dream\" and lyrics from \"Loose Ends\". Even though \"Loose Ends\" was finished in 1979, it's clear Springsteen was keen to scavenge most of the lyrics for \"Baby I'm So Cold\", but then again, the latter was never released, and sometimes we have little idea what Bruce is doing with his vast empire of songs. According to studio logs, V3 was later recorded at Power Station on May 11, 1982, perhaps the \"Loose Ends\" lyrics were just a placeholder, and by then it had its own identity.\n\nBAD BOY uncirculating\n\nNote: Recorded at The Hit Factory on June 2, 1983.\n\nBELLS OF SAN SALVADOR - V1 1:28 LM-10 BELLS OF SAN SALVADOR - V2 1:17 LM-10 BELLS OF SAN SALVADOR - V3 0:32 LM-10 BELLS OF SAN SALVADOR - V4 2:18 LM-10 BELLS OF SAN SALVADOR - V5 3:09 LM-10 BELLS OF SAN SALVADOR - V6 3:07 private\n\nNote: V1-5 are acoustic demos that were recorded at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ between September and December 1981. V1-V4 are merely vocalisations over a guitar backing, while V5 has Springsteen tentatively adding primitive vocals. V1 can be found, incorrectly titled as 'Ruled By The Gun #2', on Lost Masters X. V2 is track 11 on the same CD, 'Untitled Riff', which ends with Springsteen speaking the words \"Bells Of San Salvador\", which links all these recordings under that title. V3 and V5 are tracks 22 and 23 on the same CD, titled 'They Killed Him In The Street', while V4 is erroneously titled 'Wages Of Sin #3', track 13. A careful listen shows V1 and V4 were mistakenly grouped with other outtakes on the disc.\n\nV6 is a full-band performance probably recorded at Colts Neck in late 1981. A sinister and oppressive song, it describes a May 1979 massacre that took place on the steps of San Salvador Cathedral in El Salvador. Despite being well developed, it was not cut at Power Station in April-May 1982 like many of the other songs known to have been rehearsed during this period, and session logs indicate it was never recorded in the studio. The opening line of the song, \"They took him from his house and killed him in the street,\" can also be found in the lyrics of Springsteen's adaptation of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Run Through The Jungle\", which was performed live three times during the European leg of the River Tour.\n\nBETTY JEAN 2:17 LM-16 / GS\n\nNote: Only one known take of this rockabilly song found in the logs, recorded at Springsteen's home studio in Los Angeles on January 20, 1983. The cut on 'Lost Masters 16' may be the very same take from the logs, but we can't be certain. Bruce lifted aspects of the second verse (specifically the street fight in a \"halo of light,\" and the girl calling out \"Go, Bobby, Go\") from \"Preacher's Daughter\", which was recorded during the Darkness On The Edge Of Town sessions. Similar lines were also incorporated into the introduction to \"She's The One\" during the later dates of the 1978 tour. No relation to \"Bobby Jean\", or to Chuck Berry's \"Betty Jean\".\n\nBOBBY JEAN - V1a 3:44 BUERM / 1984AC BOBBY JEAN - V1b 3:47 BITUSA\n\nNote: After working on a final album sequence for two days, Bruce called the band in to the Hit Factory on July 28, 1983 to record a new song, \"Bobby Jean\". After playing into the wee hours of the next morning, eight takes had been recorded. Overdubs and mixing completed the track on October 10, 1983. Though it was not known at the time, this was the tenth track that would eventually comprise the Born In The U.S.A. album, with \"No Surrender\" and \"Dancing In the Dark\" still to come. Bruce said, \"\"Bobby Jean\" and \"No Surrender\" were great tributes to the bonding power of rock and my friendship with Steve.\" Just the one outtake of \"Bobby Jean\" circulates, said to be from a March 1984 rough mix of the album. Seemingly identical to the final album cut, it however includes the full \"ah-1-2-3-4\" count-in that was shortened to \"2-3-4\" on the album.\n\nBODY AND SOUL - V1 uncirculating BODY AND SOUL - V2 uncirculating BODY AND SOUL - V3 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1 is an uncirculated demo recorded on January 20, 1983 at Springsteen's home studio in Los Angeles. V2 later recorded with the band at The Hit Factory on May 25 and June 2, 1983. Springsteen returned to the song on November 29, 1983. Despite this attention, it remains in the vaults.\n\nBORN IN THE U.S.A. - V1 2:22 FFOD / HNWB / MT2 BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V2 0:30 FFOD / HNWB BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V3 4:45 FFOD / HNWB BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V4 3:10 FFOD / HNWB BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V5 2:55 FFOD / HNWB BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V6 4:00 FFOD / HNWB BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V7a (take 1) 3:06 LM-1 / HNWB BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V7b (take 1 mix 2) 3:06 TRACKS BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V8 (take 2) private BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V9 (take 3) private BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V10 (take 4) private BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V11 (takes 5-8) uncirculating BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V12 (take 9) 8:09 THLBB / UH / GS / BUERM / MI BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V12a (take 9 edit 1) 4:34 BITUSA / GREATEST / ESSENTIAL / GREATEST: 2009 / CHAPTER / BESTOF BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V12b (take 9 edit 2) 4:52 LM-19 / THLBP BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V13 (take 10) uncirculating BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V14a freedom mix 7:20 1984 EP BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V14b radio mix 6:10 1984 EP BORN IN THE U.S.A. - V14c dub mix 7:36 1984 EP\n\nNote: Writing and recording began at Springsteen's house in Colts Neck, NJ during the fall of 1981 with a set of acoustic demos. V1 evolved, both musically and lyrically, from the bluesy demo \"Vietnam\". V1 includes the chorus \"born in the USA\" that Springsteen lifted from the title of a script of a Paul Schrader movie given to him by Jon Landau, as well as many lyrical elements that would remain in the final released version. The demo begins its transition with V2, a brief snippet of the \"Born In The U.S.A.\" riff, the opening verse, and then the sardonic chorus \"Born baby in the USA / I believe in the American way\". V3-V6 were all recorded soon after, and see Springsteen developing the lyrics with every take. V7 was recorded between December 17, 1981 and January 3, 1982 on the TEAC Portastudio that Mike Batlan had set up in Bruce's home, and was included on the demo cassette tape sent to Jon Landau. In his notes to Landau, Bruce described the song as \"a little ditty. should be done very hard rockin.\" A copy leaked to bootleggers via Batlan and was pressed on 'Lost Masters I' in 1996, before V7b was mixed in 1998 and officially released on Tracks.\n\nWhen Bruce and the E Street Band entered Power Station on April 26, 1982, the aim was to re-record the songs on his demo tape in a professional studio environment. Logs indicate that work on \"Born In The U.S.A.\" began on the second day, and continued on April 28 and May 3. What work was done on what day is unclear, but it appears that the bulk of the song was recorded across ten takes on a single night, most likely May 3. A Power Station mixsheet dated to May 3 exists, which supports this position. We know that Springsteen initially attempted to re-record his demo tape alone, which may have occurred on April 27 and 28.\n\nOn May 3, Springsteen and the band cut a number of takes of a rocking electric reimagining of that original acoustic demo. In take 2 Bruce sung the first verse over his electric guitar, before bass and drum joined in. Take 3 sees Max accompanying Bruce right from the opening, yet the famous organ riff is nowhere to be found. Take 4 begins with Springsteen singing the first verse a cappella, before the band join in. We now skip ahead to take 9, where the riff is now in place alongside other new elements, some of which did not make the final track. Brief audio of the opening verse of takes 2, 3, 4, and the multitracks of take 9 first emerged in April 2022, played by Toby Scott at a public event in Mexico City. Recollections vary as to the origin of the riff; Roy Bittan remembers Springsteen demonstrating the song on acoustic guitar before he improvised the organ riff on a new Yamaha CS-80 synth, and the first take evolved from there. Max Weinberg, however, recalls the first recording was as \"a country trio\" with a country beat (Max may have been referring to the arrangement found in takes 2-4 above), and the main riff came from Springsteen's guitar. Weinberg doesn't dispute Bittan's memories though.\n\nThe eight minute V12 is the full length of take 9. With some edits, including using all or parts of take 10 (V13) for the ending, this take eventually became the first song on side one of Born In The U.S.A (V12b). V12c continues where V12b fades out with an extended synthesizer ending. Toby Scott recalls a total of eight to ten takes, with take six (or nine, recollections seem to vary) as the master. V14a-V14c are 12\" dance remixes by Arthur Baker that were recorded at Shakedown Studios in New York City in September 1984. Toby Scott was the recording engineer for the remixes (which include additional vocals by The Latin Rascals), and all were mixed by Bob Clearmountain. The remixes were first released in December 1984. Baker utilized several aspects of the original mixes that were removed for the final album take.\n\nBROTHERS UNDER THE BRIDGES 5:02 TRACKS\n\nNote: Recorded on September 14, 15, and 16 and October 10, 1983 at The Hit Factory in New York, with a take from September 14 chosen for Tracks.\n\nSMALL TOWN GIRL (CAR WASH) - V1 2:04 TRACKS CAR WASH - V2 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1 recorded on May 31, 1983 at The Hit Factory, and logged under the title \"Small Town Girl\". Six months after it was in the can, Springsteen returns for another go on November 30, 1983 (V2). V1 was later selected for Tracks, now titled \"Car Wash\".\n\nCOMMON GROUND (STAY HUNGRY) uncirculating\n\nNote: Recorded at the Power Station on May 11, 1982. Uncirculated song cut with the band during the so-called \"Electric Nebraska Sessions\".\n\nCOUNTY FAIR - V1 4:58 LM-17 COUNTY FAIR - V2a 5:02 LM-19 / UH COUNTY FAIR - V2b 4:50 ESSENTIAL: BONUS\n\nNote: V1 was recorded at Springsteen's home studio on March 24, 1983 by Springsteen alone on all instruments. V2 was recorded two months later on May 23, 1983 at The Hit Factory, and uses Springsteen's original vocal and guitar track over a new band backing. The November 9, 1983 date given in the Lost Masters liner notes appears to be incorrect, and may be a mixing or overdub date, or merely the date that the recording was dubbed to the original tape used for the bootleg. V2 also features Ruth Jackson (wife of Bruce Jackson) on backing vocals - presumably these are the ethereal vocals over the closing coda. This overdub was likely recorded at the same session as \"My Hometown\", which also features Jackson. V2a and b are very similar, and in fact may be identical, with the only differences in flaws and variations in the bootleg source.\n\nCOVER ME - V1a 3:15 THLBB / RTT COVER ME - V1b 3:36 1984AC / BUERM COVER ME - V1c 3:28 BITUSA COVER ME - V2 uncirculating COVER ME (Undercover Mix) - V3a 6:11 1984 EP COVER ME (Radio) - V3b 3:46 1984 EP COVER ME (Dub I) - V3c 4:11 1984 EP COVER ME (Dub II) - V3d 4:14 1984 EP\n\nNote: \"Cover Me\" was recorded at The Hit Factory on January 25, 1982. Earlier that month, David Geffen had approached Jon Landau to ask if Springsteen would write a song for Donna Summer. In response, Bruce wrote \"Cover Me\", but after Landau heard the January 25 tape, he told Bruce to come up with another song, because \"we're keeping this one\". In response, Bruce wrote \"Protection\". The January 25 session was recorded by Neil Dorfsman, who was also working on the Gary U.S. Bonds On the Line sessions. A copyright was filed on February 8, 1982.\n\nThe two circulating outtakes appear to be the same vocal. V1a is an alternative mix that lacks Springsteen's lead guitar overdubs, but has the count-in and full ending chopped off the released track. Note that the take found on the 'This Hard Land' vinyl bootleg runs very fast. V1b is believed to date from a March 1984 rough mix of the album, and includes Springsteen's lead guitar overdubs, the full ending and no fade-out. V1c, the final album track, cuts the ending short with a fade-out, and features background vocals by Richie \"La Bamba\" Rosenberg. On May 12, 1982, Springsteen cut nine additional takes (V2) at the Power Station, but those recordings remain in the vault. It is possible that these takes relate to the guitar overdubs.\n\nV3a thru V3d are dance/disco remixes cut at The Hit Factory in July 1984 by Arthur Baker. The recording engineer was Toby Scott, and they were released in early September 1984. Baker was requested to remix \"Cover Me\" following the success of his \"Dancing In The Dark\" remixes. A far more radical remix than \"Dancing In The Dark\" was, Baker's Undercover Mix added a new bassline from Moja Nya bassist Brian Rock, replaced much of the guitar with organ and keyboards by Gary Henry, and added percussion by session legend Bashiri Johnson. The backing vocals are courtesy of Jocelyn Brown, which were previously unused tracks recorded before Baker started work. According to Baker, Springsteen took influence from his mix for the intro and bassline in live performances.\n\nCYNTHIA - V1 3:24 LM-18 / GS CYNTHIA - V2a 4:01 SO / MAT / UH CYNTHIA - V2b 4:10 TRACKS CYNTHIA - V3 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1 was recorded April 20–21, 1983 at Thrill Hill West, Bruce's Hollywood Hills home, in rockabilly style for a set of home demos. V2 was Bruce re-recording this with The E Street Band on June 15, 1983, not April 20 as the Tracks notes claim, at The Hit Factory, New York in a much more rocking arrangement. \"Cynthia\" was resurrected over a decade later on May 23, 1995 (V3); studio logs show takes were recorded at Thrill Hill West with a four-man backing band of Danny Federici (keyboards), Garry Tallent (bass), Marty Rifkin (pedal steel, dobro) and Gary Mallaber (drums), the same day as \"The Ghost Of Tom Joad\". Both 1983 and 1995 versions were on early Tracks listings, but the latter was eventually dropped for the final release.\n\nDANCING IN THE DARK - V1a 4:31 BUERM / 1984AC DANCING IN THE DARK - V1b 3:57 BITUSA / GREATEST / ESSENTIAL / GREATEST: 2009 / BESTOF DANCING IN THE DARK - V2a blaster mix 6:09 1984 EP DANCING IN THE DARK - V2b radio mix 4:50 1984 EP DANCING IN THE DARK - V2c dub mix 5:30 1984 EP\n\nNote: The last song on Born In The U.S.A. to be recorded. Written after Jon Landau convinced Bruce that the album needed a single. According to Dave Marsh in Glory Days, Bruce was not impressed with Landau's approach. \"Look,\" he snarled, \"I've written seventy songs. You want another one, you write it.\" Despite this reaction, Bruce sat in his hotel room and wrote the song in a single night, essentially writing about his frustrations, sick of \"trying to write this book.\" Six takes were cut on February 14, 1984 at The Hit Factory, utilizing a new Yamaha synthesizer, but the track was not completed until March 8, after 58 mixes. Just the one outtake of \"Dancing In The Dark\" circulates, V1a, that contains a longer sax solo and a hard-ending (no fade-out) at the end that was cut short for the official album version. Curiously, the final synthesizer note is held for a few seconds at the conclusion of the song. This take is sourced from a March 1984 rough cut of the album. The 7\" and 12\" singles were released on May 9, 1984, and the 12\" finished as the biggest seller in the U.S.A. that year.\n\nV2a thru V2c are extended, radio friendly dance/disco remixes cut at the Power Station in April or early May 1984 by Arthur Baker, at the request of Columbia Records. The recording engineer for the remixes was Chris Lord-Alge. Providing the backing female vocals are Cindy Mizelle, Jocelyn Brown, and Baker's then-wife Tina B. Mizelle would later join the Sessions Band in 2006, and then become an E Street regular as a member of the E Street Choir between 2009 and 2014. These remixes were released on June 29, 1984.\n\nDARLINGTON COUNTY - V1 uncirculating DARLINGTON COUNTY - V2 5:04 private DARLINGTON COUNTY - V3a 5:20 LM-19 / THLRR DARLINGTON COUNTY - V3b 4:44 BITUSA\n\nNote: The title \"Darlington County\" is first known from the early days of the Darkness On The Edge Of Town sessions, where it can be found on a worksheet that is believed to date from late June 1977. The worksheet is reproduced in the facsimile book included in the Darkness box set, and \"Darlington County\" is the first item on the list, with the note \"notice structure of tape.\" That suggests \"Darlington County\" was worked on during the sessions, but it does not appear in any session logs, and aside from the title it is unknown how it relates to the Born In The U.S.A. cut. Also found in the book is the familiar couplet \"My eyes have seen the glory of the comin' of the Lord / He was peelin' down the alley in a black and yellow Ford,\" not too dissimilar than what could be found in the version that was recorded some five years later during the Born In The U.S.A. sessions.\n\nAt some point, it was set aside and not picked up again until 1981. V2 is a band rehearsal from Colts Neck, New Jersey, probably recorded some time in late 1981; a rather pedestrian take, as noted by both Max and Bruce at the conclusion of the song. V3 was recorded in a single take at Power Station, New York on May 13, 1982. V3a, which appears to be a slightly longer, slower take on 'Lost Masters XIX' is actually the released version V4b, before vocal overdubs, fixed-up intro, and the use of varispeed to speed the track up. Track 8 on 'Lost Masters Volume 7', titled \"Untitled Harmonies #1\", is a short clip from January 1980 of Springsteen singing a tune that bears some resemblance to \"Darlington County\".\n\nDELIVERY MAN - V1 2:17 LM-17 / GS DELIVERY MAN - V2a 2:50 LM-17 / UH / GS DELIVERY MAN - V2b 2:43 GS\n\nNote: Two different recordings from around January 1983 at Springsteen's home studio in the Hollywood Hills. V1 is more rocking and has a quick fade-out. V2 is the definitive version and features an extra verse not found in V1. The song is missing from studio logs, suggesting it was recorded at a standalone session, separate from other songs cut around the same time.\n\nDON'T BACK DOWN - V1 0:55 CAST DON'T BACK DOWN - V2 3:03 LM-18 DON'T BACK DOWN - V3 3:01 LM-18 DON'T BACK DOWN - V4 3:02 LM-18 DON'T BACK DOWN - V5 2:29 LM-18 DON'T BACK DOWN - V6 0.43 LM-18 DON'T BACK DOWN - V7 2:23 LM-18 DON'T BACK DOWN - V8 2:28 LM-18 DON'T BACK DOWN - V9 2:52 LM-18 DON'T BACK DOWN - V10 2:52 LM-16 DON'T BACK DOWN - V11 3:12 LM-16 DON'T BACK DOWN - V12 3:34 LM-16 / UH DON'T BACK DOWN - V13 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1 was recorded at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ between mid-September 1981 and May 1982, a brief acoustic demo of the V11 arrangement of \"Don't Back Down\", track four of 'The Lost Masters XVI'. Other known recordings took place on January 4, 18 and 20, February 8–10 and 14–15, and March 10 and 12, 1983, all at Springsteen's home studio in Los Angeles. All circulating recordings are complete takes, except for V6, which is abandoned. V2, V3, V4, and V10 are rock-flavored and appear to share the same vocal take. Indeed, the differences between the takes are slight, and may only be found in the backing music or the mix. V5–V9 are acoustic-flavored, and once again seem to share the same vocal take. The excellent V11 utilizes double tracked vocals and a different melody and lyrics. It could perhaps be considered a completely different song that only shares a title with the other versions listed here. V12 is the slowest and arguably the definitive version, using the same backing music as \"The Klansman\". According to the 'Lost Masters' liner notes it was recorded on January 4, 1983. V13 was recorded June 15, 1983 at The Hit Factory, New York. The arrangement used for this studio recording is unknown.\n\nDOWNBOUND TRAIN - V1 1:11 FFOD / HNWB DOWNBOUND TRAIN - V2 0.34 LM-10 DOWNBOUND TRAIN - V3 take 3 2:22 LM-1 / HNWB / MT2 / ESR DOWNBOUND TRAIN - V4a 3:17 THLRR / BUERM / TDB / LM-19 / GS DOWNBOUND TRAIN - V4b 3:29 BITUSA DOWNBOUND TRAIN - V5 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1 and V2 are brief acoustic demos that were recorded at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ in late 1981. V1 includes the closing line used in both the Nebraska take and the final Born In The U.S.A. album version: \"don't it feel like you're a rider [baby], on a downbound train.\" V2 is just harmonies, with no lyrical content. A demo was recorded and dubbed to a cassette tape on December 2, 1981 - nothing else is known about this particular recording, but it may be related to V3, a full acoustic run-through of the song recorded at some point between mid-December 1981 and January 3, 1982, with the patented Nebraska ending. Described by Springsteen in his notes to Jon Landau as an \"uptempo rocker for full effect / needs band / could be exciting.\"\n\nPower Station logs show sessions took place on April 27 and 28 and May 3, 5 and 6, 1982, the result of which provided the base track, V4. V4a features Springsteen's count-in, a small lyrical variation in the first verse left over from the acoustic demo (\"laid off down at the auto yard\" rather than \"lumber yard\"), some vocal howls in the mid-section, more up-front acoustic guitar over the final verse, and a shorter fade-out. Nearly a year later Bruce returned to \"Downbound Train\" on February 3, 1983 (V5) at Thrill Hill West, his Hollywood Hills garage studio. However, it was the 1982 cut that was issued on Born In The U.S.A. in 1984.\n\nDROP ON DOWN AND COVER ME - V1a 7:?? uncirculating DROP ON DOWN AND COVER ME - V1b 4:37 SO / GS / BUERM / 1984AC / UH\n\nNote: At least eleven takes of \"Drop On Down And Cover Me\" (or \"Drop (On) Down And Cover Me\") were recorded between May 31 and June 2, 1983 at The Hit Factory. Long believed to have evolved into \"Cover Me\" but the studio documentation proves otherwise, with its precursor recorded some eighteen months earlier. This reworking uses some lyrics from \"Cover Me\" in the opening verses, as well as the melody of \"Janey, Don't You Lose Heart\". V1a was edited down to 4:37 from the original seven minutes. Springsteen included it on a July 1983 album track listing between \"None But The Brave\" and \"Shut Out The Light\" at the expense of his 1982 songs, which were eventually restored. Though it was included (see the Tracks-sampler) in early Tracks listings, with takes 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 all pulled for evaluation in June 1998, it was dropped before the final cut.\n\nFADE TO BLACK - V1 4:15 LM-7 / HNWB FADE TO BLACK - V2 0.50 LM-7 FADE TO BLACK - V3 0:45 LM-10 FADE TO BLACK - V4 3:01 FFOD / HNWB FADE TO BLACK - V5 2:57 FFOD / HNWB FADE TO BLACK - V6 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1–V5 are all acoustic demos recorded at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, New Jersey. V1 is an early demo with basic lyrics while V2 is merely harmonies, both were probably recorded in late June 1981. V3 (which consists of the title repeated over a basic melody) was possibly recorded later in the year. The Lost Masters artwork claims that the contents of 'Lost Masters X' were recorded in early 1983, but this is doubtful, given that the likes of \"Glory Days\" and \"Wages Of Sin\" were recorded at Power Station in April and May of 1982, respectively. V4 and V5 are identical performances combined into a single track on both 'How Nebraska Was Born' and 'Fistfull Of Dollars'. Both are listed here for completeness. This performance (probably from late 1981) is much more developed, and includes the line \"you're crying in the corner, makeup running down your face,\" which is similar to a line found in \"Wages Of Sin\". According to logs, V6 was recorded at Power Station on May 11, 1982 - this take could be solo or with the band.\n\nFOLLOW THAT DREAM - V1a 0:14 LM-17 FOLLOW THAT DREAM - V1b 3:50 LM-17 FOLLOW THAT DREAM - V1c 3:52 LM-17 FOLLOW THAT DREAM - V1d 3:42 SO / LM-18 / UH / MILM FOLLOW THAT DREAM - V1e 3:44 LM-18\n\nNote: Haunting rewrite of the Elvis Presley classic which was considered at one point for Born In The U.S.A.. V1a is a false start. Vocally, all four full length takes seem to be identical and any differences may only be in the mix. Studio logs say \"Follow That Dream\" was recorded January 29–30 and February 7–8 and 17, 1983 at Springsteen's home studio in the Hollywood Hills. 'Lost Masters' liner notes say the above tracks were all recorded January 30, which suggests more takes remain in the vaults. Shares a melody with \"Baby I'm So Cold\". An early Tracks six-CD sample set from June 1998 indicates that \"Follow That Dream\" was considered for Tracks, but ultimately rejected.\n\nFRANKIE - V1 4:46 LM-3 / DDO / DO-2 / AM / UP / DDOC FRANKIE - V2 5:46 DOT TAPE FRANKIE - V3a take 10 7:23 private cdr FRANKIE - V3b 7:41 THLRR / MI / THLBP / UH FRANKIE - V3c 7:39 LM-19 FRANKIE - V3d 7:22 TRACKS\n\nNote: \"Frankie\" was composed by Springsteen in early 1976, just after the 1975 Born To Run Tour. According to Christopher Sandford's Point Blank, a demo of \"Frankie\" was recorded in January 1976, along with a completed recording of \"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\". However the accuracy of this information is doubted, as early recordings of \"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\" from June 1977 indicate most of the words were still unwritten. However, \"Frankie\" was near completion when it was debuted live on the Chicken Scratch Tour in late March 1976.\n\nWhen Springsteen returned to the studio after the litigation with Mike Appel was resolved, \"Frankie\" was recorded on June 3, 1977, and again on July 12, both at Atlantic Studios. V2 and V3 may be from those sessions. Apparently, \"Frankie\" did not fit Bruce's concept for the album, and it was set aside, not to be recorded again during the Darkness sessions. When writing \"Candy's Room\" a few months later, Bruce lifted some lyrics from \"Frankie\", specifically, \"In the darkness, there'll be hidden worlds that shine.\" However, a take of \"Frankie\" was dubbed to a reel dated February 1, 1978 alongside \"Rendezvous\", indicating that the song hadn't entirely slipped Bruce's mind. Just over four years later, \"Frankie\" was recorded again on May 14, 1982 at the Power Station, New York, on the last day of three weeks of sessions for the Born In The U.S.A. album. Take 10 was chosen, and completed with several overdubs. Though it was not included on Born In The U.S.A., V3d was considered for Greatest Hits, again missing the cut, before being selected for the Tracks compilation in 1998. One other mix, V3a, has the same saxophone overdub during the instrumental outro as V3d. V3b and V3c were alternative mixes without sax. It is not known if the takes from 1977 were ever considered for Tracks.\n\nFUGITIVE'S DREAM 3:59 LM-16 / UH / BUOR\n\nNote: Two known takes found in the logs, recorded January 20 and March 24, 1983 at Springsteen's home studio in Los Angeles. Which take is on 'Lost Masters 16' is unknown.\n\nGLORY DAYS - V1 1:59 LM-10 GLORY DAYS - V2 4:24 private GLORY DAYS - V3a 4:54 THLBP / THLBB GLORY DAYS - V3b 5:18 LM-19 / UH / GS / MI / BUERM / TDB / RTT GLORY DAYS - V3c 5:05 private cdr GLORY DAYS - V3d 4:11 BITUSA / GREATEST / ESSENTIAL / GREATEST: 2009 / BESTOF\n\nNote: V1 is a very early solo acoustic demo recorded sometime between September 1981 and April 1982. It includes an early version of the verse about Springsteen's father that was cut from the final album version but appears in most circulating bootlegs. V2 is a Colts Neck band rehearsal that can be dated to around the same period, but after V1. The verse about his father is there, Bruce can be heard calling out instructions occasionally, there are minor lyrical variations throughout, and it lacks the entire call-and-response ending. V3 is recorded at Power Station on May 5, 1982; four different mixes are known. V3a only appears on 'This Hard Land' issues and 'Roll The Tapes', and is unique because of the serious audio distortion that runs throughout. V3b is unedited and contains the extra verse cut from the officially released version. The wild variations in track length appear to be due to tape speed, and there are two variations in the count-in. An alternative source of V3b includes an engineer identifying the take as #11.\n\nGLORY OF LOVE uncirculating\n\nNote: Uncirculated track from The Hit Factory, recorded September 16, 1983. Included on a Tracks concept compilation in 1993.\n\nGONE, GONE, GONE uncirculating\n\nNote: According to studio documentation, \"Gone, Gone, Gone\" was recorded at The Hit Factory on May 25, 27, and 31, 1983. One take was recorded on the 25th, and three takes on both May 27 and 31. A rough mix was created on the final day, but there is no information beyond that and the song remains in the vault, and was never bootlegged. The phrase \"gone, gone, gone\" can also be found in \"Seeds\", but there is no relation to that song. Springsteen will often re-use lyrics, and indeed \"gone, gone, gone\" is used in at least four other Born In The U.S.A. session outtakes: \"Fugitive's Dream\", \"Don't Back Down\", \"Sugarland\", and \"Seven Tears\".\n\nGUN IN EVERY HOME uncirculating\n\nNote: According to studio logs recorded at Power Station on April 30 and May 6, 1982. Uncirculated song.\n\nDEPUTY - V1 uncirculating DEPUTY - V2 uncirculating DEPUTY - V3 uncirculating DEPUTY - V4a 5:30 LM-1 / HNWB HIGHWAY PATROLMAN - V4b 5:36 NEBRASKA HIGHWAY PATROLMAN - V4c stereo mix 5:37 NEBRASKA HIGHWAY PATROLMAN - V5 uncirculating\n\nNote: Four different takes were recorded - the three variants of V4 are merely alternate mixes. The original title was \"Deputy\". In a letter to Jon Landau, Bruce said he \"worked very long on this and always had the feeling I was comin up short. Not really finished but is about as good as I can get it at the time. Don't think the ending was quite strong enough.\" Logs show takes at Power Station on April 30, 1982, either solo or with the band.\n\nHOLD ON (TO WHAT YOU GOT) uncirculating\n\nNote: Recorded at The Hit Factory in January or February 1982. Probably the same core recording as found on the U.S. Bonds album (i.e. the E Street Band) – but with the Springsteen lead vocal.\n\nI DON'T CARE uncirculating\n\nNote: Uncirculated track recorded at Springsteen's home studio in Los Angeles some point prior to February 1983. This track appears on a 24-track mix tape from February 1983 alongside \"The Money We Didn't Make\", a solo cut of \"This Hard Land\", and \"Seven Tears\".\n\nI'M GOIN' DOWN - V1 3:47 THLBB / CAST / THLBP I'M GOIN' DOWN - V2a take 9 4:54 LM-19 / UH / GS I'M GOIN' DOWN - V2b take 9 3:57 BUERM / TDB / THLRR / MI I'M GOIN' DOWN - V3 take 10 3:25 BITUSA\n\nNote: Original title was \"Down, Down, Down\". All the above were recorded at the Power Station on May 12–13, 1982, with over ten takes on the latter date, including the album cut. V1 is often timed at 3:29, due to a circulating ultra-fast version (Castaway and This Hard Land vinyl boots). V2a, which 'Lost Masters' says was recorded November 9, 1983, was also from the 13th - November 9 may have been the date it was mixed. V2 lacks the extra guitar over the introduction and the saxophone solo. V2 is take #9.\n\nI'M ON FIRE - V1a 2:42 private cdr I'M ON FIRE - V1b 2:50 LM-20 / THLRR / UH I'M ON FIRE - V1c 2:58 1984AC / BUERM I'M ON FIRE - V1d 2:32 BITUSA / GREATEST: 2009\n\nNote: Rumored to have been initially recorded at The Hit Factory in January 1982, but the Born In The U.S.A. track was completed on May 11, 1982 at the Power Station. V1a and 1b have slightly different vocals and arrangements, and longer fade-outs than the officially released V1d. V1c, believed to be a track from a March 1984 rough mix of the album, has the complete ending to a hard-stop (i.e. no fade-out), as well as some small changes to the vocals over the closing coda.\n\nIDA ROSE (NO ONE KNOWS) uncirculating\n\nNote: Recorded late in the sessions, on February 20, 1984 at The Hit Factory. \"Ida Rose\" was included on a Tracks concept compilation in 1993, but remains in the vaults.\n\nINVITATION TO YOUR PARTY uncirculating\n\nNote: Two takes recorded at The Hit Factory on May 31, 1983, one labelled as \"fast.\"\n\nJAMES LINCOLN DEER - V1 4:14 LMEC2 / HNWB JAMES LINCOLN DEER - V2 uncirculating\n\nNote: \"James Lincoln Deer(e)\" aka \"James Lincoln Dear\" was worked on at four sessions over the period of twelve months. V1 is an acoustic demo first recorded around March 1982 at Colts Neck. Contains lyrics later used in \"My Hometown\": \"Man said, \"These jobs are goin' boys / And they ain't comin' back.\" Springsteen returned to the song on January 20, 1983, which more work following on February 15 and 17, and March 12, 1983, all at Thrill Hill Recording, Hollywood Hills, California. By late April however, Springsteen renamed his protagonist and re-worked the lyrics before recording \"Richfield Whistle\".\n\nJANEY, DON'T YOU LOSE HEART - V1a 4:31 UH / GS / MI / 1984AC JANEY, DON'T YOU LOSE HEART - V1b 3:24 TRACKS / 1985 single / BACK JANEY, DON'T YOU LOSE HEART - V2 uncirculating\n\nNote: \"Janey, Don't You Lose Heart\" was originally recorded on June 16, 1983 at The Hit Factory, New York. The heavily bootlegged V1a features Steve Van Zandt on background vocals and guitar, and an extended wistful organ coda closes out the track. V1b is the same base recording, except Nils Lofgren's new vocal and guitar parts replace Van Zandt's. Lofgren's overdubs were recorded on July 14, 1985. The organ coda was also removed, reducing the length by over a minute. V1b was released September 7, 1985, as the b-side of \"I'm Goin' Down\" and then re-released in 1998, on Tracks. On June 16, 1995, the twelve year anniversary of the 1983 recording date, V2 was recorded at Springsteen's home studio in Beverly Hills with a line-up of Bruce, Gary Mallaber (drums), Garry Tallent, Marty Rifkin, and Chuck Plotkin (keyboards). Both variants of \"Janey\" were considered for Tracks, but the 1995 recording was dropped in favor of the 1983 cut.\n\nJOHNNY 99 - V1 3:50 FFOD / HNWB JOHNNY 99 - V2 3:26 FFOD / HNWB JOHNNY 99 - V3 uncirculating JOHNNY 99 - V4 take 1 uncirculating JOHNNY 99 - V5a take 2 3:30 LM-1 JOHNNY 99 - V5b take 2 3:36 NEBRASKA / ESSENTIAL: 2015 JOHNNY 99 - V5c take 2 stereo mix 3:36 NEBRASKA JOHNNY 99 - V6 take 3 uncirculating JOHNNY 99 - V7 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1 is similar to the released version, with some lyrical variations. V2 is closer still. Both are acoustic demos recorded at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ from mid-September to December 1981. Three different, complete, recordings were made on January 3, 1982, but only one has surfaced (V5), in three alternative mixes. One of the recordings has a different ending verse. In late April 1982 Bruce recorded takes at the Power Station on April 27–28 and May 3, 1982. These cuts may be solo or with the band.\n\nCOME ON (LET'S GO TONIGHT) - V1 2:32 FFOD / HNWB JOHNNY BYE-BYE - V2 uncirculating JOHNNY BYE-BYE - V3a 1:45 LM-16 trk 10 / UH / GS JOHNNY BYE-BYE - V3b 1:45 LM-18 trk 13 JOHNNY BYE-BYE - V3c 1:39 LM-18 trk 10 JOHNNY BYE-BYE - V3d 1:51 1985 b-side / BACK JOHNNY BYE-BYE - V3e 1:49 TRACKS JOHNNY BYE-BYE - V4 2:55 LM-16 trk 11 / MT2 / ESR JOHNNY BYE-BYE - V5 2:58 LM-17 trk 12 / GS JOHNNY BYE-BYE - V6 3:41 LM-17 trk 13 / GS\n\nNote: In 1962, Chuck Berry wrote \"Bye Bye Johnny\", a sequel to \"Johnny B. Goode\", where a mother sent her musician son off to Hollywood to be a star: \"She drew out all her money from the Southern Trust, and put her little boy aboard the Greyhound Bus.\" Bruce decided to use those lines in 1981 in the opening verse of a new song that used most of the lyrics from Darkness On The Edge Of Town outtake \"Come On (Let's Go Tonight)\", calling it \"Johnny Bye-Bye\".\n\nThe story begins between legs of the River Tour in March 1981 when Springsteen recorded an acoustic demo (V1) at his home, combining lyrics from \"Come On (Let's Go Tonight)\" with some newly written lyrics over a new dark and foreboding arrangement. This recording can be found on bootlegs 'Fistfull Of Dollars' and 'How Nebraska Was Born' under the title \"Bye Bye Johnny\". The Elvis Presley references already contained within \"Come On (Let's Go Tonight)\" made a perfect match with Berry's classic, keeping the lines about the death of Elvis and adding lines about Memphis.\n\nSpringsteen premiered his new song on May 13, 1981 in Manchester, UK with a short spoken introduction: \"I think everybody remembers where they were when they heard that Elvis died, it is a hard thing to understand\". The refrain \"come on, come on, let's go tonight\" remained in place at the end of the first and second verses, and \"bye-bye Johnny, oh Johnny bye-bye\" was now added at the close, solidifying the connection to Berry's original. Despite performing the song regularly on the River Tour, Bruce did not record it as part of the January 1982 Nebraska demos at Colts Neck; the legendary Nebraska version of \"Johnny Bye-Bye\" does not exist. The version on the tape he sent Landau was almost certainly a live July 1981 recording. When the Nebraska tape was backed up in June 1982 in its entirety, alternate takes and all, there was still no \"Johnny Bye-Bye\".\n\nThe first studio take of \"Johnny Bye-Bye\" was recorded on April 27, 1982, at Power Station, New York. This audio does not circulate, but is listed above as V2. In all likelihood, this is a solo take. Studio documentation shows that Springsteen returned to the song in the winter of 1983, with sessions on January 4, March 9, and March 24 at Bruce's Hollywood Hills converted studio at his home in Los Angeles, now arranged with a bouncy hillbilly blues rhythm and a re-written third verse. According to the Tracks liner notes, the official V3 was recorded in January, and five different mixes circulate. V3d, released February 6, 1985 as the b-side to \"I'm On Fire\", features a different drum overdub to that found on the mix chosen for Tracks, V3e. V3b and V3c have slight but noticeable variations in their mixes.\n\nV4 and V5 were recorded on March 9 at Thrill Hill West and are different takes of a slower acoustic arrangement with a gentle synthesizer backing, slight lyrical differences and overdubbed with chirping crickets at the start and end. By far the definitive performance is V6, from March 24, 1983, which includes a poignant extra verse at the end not found on the other versions. \"Johnny Bye-Bye\" was included on the July 1983 sequence for Born In The U.S.A., but did not make the final cut. After the lawyers met, Bruce and Chuck became composing partners, the song now registered as Springsteen-Berry.\n\nJOHNNY GO DOWN uncirculating\n\nNote: Uncirculated track initially titled \"Johnny Cool Down\", recorded March 9 and 12, 1983 at The Hit Factory and marked as \"new idea\" on the March 9 reel. Included on a 24-track mix tape alongside \"Don't Back Down\", \"James Lincoln Deer\", and \"Losin' Kind\", and later on a 1993 in-house Tracks \"concept album\".\n\nJUST AROUND THE CORNER TO THE LIGHT OF DAY uncirculating\n\nNote: Recorded May 25, 1983. Quite a complex story behind this song. The original title when recorded during the Born In The U.S.A. sessions was \"Just Around The Corner To The Light Of Day\". A demo of the song was sent to screenwriter/director Paul Schrader in 1985 for consideration for his upcoming film about struggling rock musicians. Ironically, Schrader had sent Springsteen a draft screenplay for this movie (then titled Born In The U.S.A.) in 1981 hoping Bruce might craft a song for it. Bruce never did write a song for Schrader at the time. Schrader then put this film project on hold to direct the 1982 movie Cat People. However the script's title (though not its storyline) spurred Bruce at the time to alter a partially written song of his called \"Vietnam\" and create the song \"Born In The U.S.A.\". Fast forward four years – in 1985, when Schrader received the go-ahead to make the film, he couldn't use his title Born In The U.S.A. because by that point it had become too closely associated with Springsteen. Schrader again asked Bruce for a song and Bruce donated this – which Schrader loved so much that he re-copyrighted his screenplay in 1985 under the new title Just Around The Corner To The Light Of Day. In 1986 when the film was being shot, both the movie and song titles were shortened to \"Light Of Day\". It had never been intended that Springsteen's recording would be used in the film. The song was recorded by the film's stars, Joan Jett and Michael J. Fox (\"The Barbusters\"), and released concurrently with the movie in February 1987. The Barbusters first performed the song live at a nightclub appearance in mid-1986. Springsteen first performed the song live on April 12, 1987. A later live version was officially released on MTV Unplugged.\n\nKING'S HIGHWAY uncirculating\n\nNote: Seven takes of \"King's Highway\" were recorded over two days on May 23 and 24, 1983 at The Hit Factory in New York. Uncirculated song from the sessions, it was later included on two in-house rarities compilations, the 1993 concept list and another from November 1997, but failed to make the cut.\n\nLION'S DEN - V1 0:55 FFOD / HNWB LION'S DEN - V2 2:18 uncirculating LION'S DEN - V3 2:18 TRACKS\n\nNote: \"Lion's Den\" was first recorded as a solo acoustic demo (V1) in late March to early April 1981 at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ, and consists of the chorus, repeated. It was bootlegged under the title \"Daniel In The Lion's Den\". V2 is a base track recorded at The Hit Factory on January 25, 1982, during the Gary U.S. Bonds sessions. V3 overdubs the 1998 horn section (Cruz-Manion-Pender-Rosenberg-Spengler) for Tracks over the V2 base track. The original 1982 element was not recorded by Toby Scott but rather by Neil Dorfsman, the engineer for the Bonds LP.\n\nLITTLE GIRL (LIKE YOU) - V1 1:20 LM-16 / UH / GS LITTLE GIRL (LIKE YOU) - V2 1:24 LM-17\n\nNote: Two different recordings but quite similar, both recorded January 20, 1983 at Springsteen's home studio in the Hollywood Hills. Short, but sweet. Considered for use as a b-side in March 1983.\n\nTHE ANSWER - V1 1:56 FFOD / HNWB / MT2 THE ANSWER - V2 3:17 FFOD / HNWB / MT2 LOSIN' KIND - V3 take 1 uncirculating LOSIN' KIND (Patrolman) - V4 take 2 4:47 LM-1 / HNWB / MTQ / MT2 LOSIN' KIND - V5 take 3 uncirculating LOSIN' KIND - V6 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1 & V2 are portions of two takes that are far from rough demos. Bruce wrote an extensive poem about a troubled young man who had two visions of events, what he perceived in the present, and a spiritual self that could see Frank was headed for disaster. Bruce refers to this as \"kind of like a James M. Cain story\", and it also could have been a 1940s hard luck Jimmy Cagney movie. Both versions were recorded at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ between December 20, 1981 and January 3, 1982, and are combined a single file.\n\nV4 is an acoustic take on January 3, 1982, one of the fifteen demos that Springsteen put on a tape. This is the definitive circulating take, but was not chosen for Nebraska. Springsteen wrote to Landau, \"Searched and searched for a better title, spent many hours on this task but no good. I like the verses but I can't seem to find a better punch line. Kind of like a James M. Cain story. Could be done with more of a band arrangement.\" V5 was recorded at Power Station on April 30, 1982. At that time Springsteen was attempting to re-create that demo tape magic in a more professional environment - this take could be solo or with the band. A year later Bruce would make one more attempt to record \"Losin' Kind\", this time at Thrill Hill West, his Hollywood Hills studio, on March 12, 1983 (V6). Without bootlegs, we would never know that \"Losin' Kind\" exists; officially, it has never been released.\n\nLOVE'S ON THE LINE V1 uncirculating LOVE'S ON THE LINE V2 3:38 GUEST: LINE\n\nNote: Recorded at The Hit Factory in January or February 1982 (V1). Probably the same core recording as V2 found on the U.S. Bonds album (i.e. the E Street Band, including Bruce's backing vocals) – but with the Springsteen lead vocal.\n\nMAN AT THE TOP - V1a 4:08 uncirculating MAN AT THE TOP - V1b 3:16 TRACKS\n\nNote: Recorded on January 12, 1984 at The Hit Factory, New York, NY, take 2, slow acoustic version. Springsteen premiered the song live on July 12, 1984 on the Born In The U.S.A. Tour. Thanks to the Panda for providing track length of full cut with hard stop, before it was downsized and faded out for Tracks.\n\nMANSION ON THE HILL - V1a uncirculating MANSION ON THE HILL - V1b 4:00 LM-1 MANSION ON THE HILL - V1c 4:01 NEBRASKA MANSION ON THE HILL - V1c stereo mix 3:55 NEBRASKA MANSION ON THE HILL - V2 uncirculating\n\nNote: Written by Springsteen during the River Tour, although the themes found in the song were explored prior to this, during the Darkness sessions. For example, the lyric \"there's a palace on the edge of town / risin' from the factories and railroad shacks\" can be found in the Darkness box set facsimile book, which is very similar to a lyric found in \"Mansion On The Hill\". The first song completed for Nebraska, and only one recording was made - the four variants above are merely alternate mixes. Springsteen recorded multiple takes at Power Station on April 27, 28, and 30, 1982 either solo (Springsteen would re-record the Nebraska tracks around this time in a failed attempt to reproduce his demos in a professional environment) or with the band.\n\nMURDER INCORPORATED - V1a 4:03 MI / GS / MILM / LM-19 / TDB / UH MURDER INCORPORATED - V1b 4:27 RTT MURDER INCORPORATED - V1c 4:22 RTT / THLBP / THLBB MURDER INCORPORATED - V1d 4:13 private cdr MURDER INCORPORATED - V1e 3:59 MI / GS / MILM / UH MURDER INCORPORATED - V1f 3:52 GREATEST / ESSENTIAL: 2015 / 1995 single\n\nNote: Recorded at Power Station by Toby Scott on May 3–4, 1982 and considered for an early album track listing as the second song, to follow \"Born In The U.S.A\". According to Brian Hiatt in The Stories Behind The Songs, \"Murder Incorporated\" was rehearsed in Roy Bittan's living room, and a tape of that rehearsal is highly admired by Max Weinberg: \"the best version I've ever heard,\" he told Hiatt. All of the above are different mixes of the same core recording. V1a has been in circulation for many years, and is the most commonly bootlegged version. V1b is the full recording, with hard stop ending. When compensated for speed and empty space, the recording found on track 3 of the LP 'This Hard Land' (Boss Productions) is V1c, found at correct pitch on 'Roll the Tracks', with no backing vocals in the first verse. V1d deletes the saxophone solo after the second verse, and V1e is an alternate mix, featuring Roy Bittan on piano. The officially released V1f was remixed by Bob Clearmountain in 1994 for the Greatest Hits album. It includes the saxophone solo, but fades out earlier than the outtakes, explaining the ten second difference in track length. Inclusion on a six-CD sampler dated from June 1998 indicates that the song was considered for Tracks. This is peculiar, since the original 1982 recording had already been issued at this point, and no further recordings are known.\n\nYOUR HOMETOWN - V1 3:30 LM-17 / MT1 YOUR HOMETOWN - V2 3:14 LM-17 YOUR HOMETOWN - V3 3:23 LM-17 / GS#1 YOUR HOMETOWN - V4 3:16 LM-17 / GS#2 MY HOMETOWN - V5 take 1 6:47 uncirculating MY HOMETOWN - V6 take 2 6:22 uncirculating MY HOMETOWN - V7 take 3 4:25 BITUSA / GREATEST MY HOMETOWN - V8 take 4 4:54 LM-19\n\nNote: Written in late 1982 as a rockabilly song called \"Your Hometown\", with many of the album version lyrics finished by late January 1983. The second verse tells the real-life story of events in Springsteen's hometown of Freehold in May 1969, when a shoot-out between cars of white and black kids turned almost fatal, and the racial tensions and violence in the aftermath. V1–V4 were early takes recorded by Bruce and Toby Scott at his new home, at 7965 Fareholm Drive, Los Angeles, California 90046, on January 29 and 30, and February 9 and 17, 1983. The demos are of good quality, probably prepared to aid in teaching the song to the band. Instead, Bruce set it aside for a few months, and came back with a new title, \"My Hometown\", and an arrangement for the band. On June 29, 1983 at The Hit Factory, four complete takes were recorded, but the first two were discarded because they both exceeded six minutes. Takes 3 and 4, which both featuring Ruth Jackson (wife of sound engineer Bruce Jackson) on background vocals, were the final result, with take 3 (V7) chosen for Born In The U.S.A..\n\nMY LOVE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN - V1a 3:12 private cdr MY LOVE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN - V1b 4:20 LM-19 / THLRR / UH / GS / THLBP MY LOVE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN - V1c 4:32 MI / UH / GS MY LOVE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN - V1d 4:20 TRACKS\n\nNote: Recorded at the Power Station over three days on May 5, 6 and 7, 1982. The studio venue listed in Tracks is incorrect. All of the above four mixes are very similar, but V1b has Springsteen adding a count-in, vocalizations over the first thirty seconds of the song, and a complete ending. V1a cuts early. V1c and V1d fade out, and the V1d mix (used for Tracks) has slightly different vocals at the end of the song, maybe a 1998 vocal. Bruce Springsteen said in 2001 of the song: \"I don't know why it got left off. It was one of those things we pulled out in the first rehearsal and went, Whoa!\"\n\nSTARKWEATHER - V1 1:09 LM-1(17) / HNWB STARKWEATHER - V2 1:05 LM-1(18) / HNWB STARKWEATHER - V3 take 1 uncirculating STARKWEATHER - V4 take 2 uncirculating STARKWEATHER - V5 take 3 uncirculating STARKWEATHER - V6a take 4 m 4:25 LM-1(1) NEBRASKA - V6b take 4 mix 1 4:25 NEBRASKA / ESSENTIAL: 2003 NEBRASKA - V6c take 4 mix 2 early fade 4:25 uncirculating NEBRASKA - V6d take 4 mix 3 bad harp 4:25 uncirculating NEBRASKA - V6e take 4 mix 4 glock 4:25 uncirculating NEBRASKA - V6f stereo mix 4:16 NEBRASKA NEBRASKA - V7 uncirculating\n\nNote: The first song recorded, and the first song in the final running order, for Nebraska. V1 and V2 are takes of the introduction and first two lines, recorded in late 1981 at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ. Six takes were recorded on January 3, 1982, including V6b take 4, the title track of the album. V6 above are alternate mixes. Mix #1 is complete, with a 12-string guitar. #2 fades early, #3 is noted as \"bad harp no good\". Take #4 is with glock. Listed as \"Starkweather\" in an early song line-up, the song is about the Charles Starkweather murder spree in the 1950s. \"Nebraska\" was later recorded over three days at Power Station on April 27, 28 and 30, 1982; these recordings could be either solo or with the band, or possibly both.\n\nNO SURRENDER - V1 3:57 BITUSA NO SURRENDER - V2 uncirculating\n\nNote: Near the end of the Born In the U.S.A. sessions, Bruce brings in a new composition, \"No Surrender\", and the band goes to work on it for three days, October 25–27, 1983, with the album arrangement (V1) recorded October 27 at The Hit Factory. Richie \"La Bamba\" Rosenberg contributes background vocals. Springsteen would return on November 29, 1983 to cut an acoustic version (V2). The song almost didn't make the album, and was only added after Steve Van Zandt convinced Springsteen that it should be included. At the time CBS had an eleven-song album without \"No Surrender\" ready to go. Van Zandt argued that \"Dancing In The Dark\" should be cut in favor of \"No Surrender\", but in the end there was space on the album for both.\n\nNONE BUT THE BRAVE - V1a 5:24 BUERM / UH / MAT / MILM / RTT NONE BUT THE BRAVE - V1b 5:12 SO / GT NONE BUT THE BRAVE - V2 5:29 ESSENTIAL: BONUS\n\nNote: \"None But The Brave\" was cut on June 6, 1983 at The Hit Factory, with follow-up sessions on June 13 and 27. V1a and V1b appear to be almost finished recordings with double-track vocals. They are said to be different mixes but are very similar, and any differences may be down to tape speed and recording source. V2 was a fresh vocal on June 27, and Miami Steve Van Zandt cutting loose on guitar that was probably added as a subsequent overdub. The lyrics are the same as V1a/b, aside from a small change in the third verse, replacing 'Something that ain't there no more' with 'Just waitin' to see you come walkin' through that door'. This alternate take was released on the bonus third CD of The Essential Bruce Springsteen in November 2003, and then played live for the first time at the 2003 Christmas shows in Asbury Park the following month.\n\nNOW AND FOREVER - V1 uncirculating SUMMER ON SIGNAL HILL - V2 uncirculating\n\nNote: \"Summer On Signal Hill\" was recorded as an instrumental by Clarence Clemons & The Red Bank Rockers at the Record Plant, New York, in 1983, the same sessions that produced \"Savin' Up\". Both tracks were produced by Bruce Springsteen, and released as a UK single, with \"Summer On Signal Hill\" the b-side. Springsteen's music publisher in Australia was accidentally sent the wrong information, so Clarence's instrumental was published and released there in 1983 as \"Now And Forever\", which was its original title. It was composed by Springsteen, with lyrics, and played during band rehearsals in April 1982, at his home studio in Colts Neck, New Jersey. Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band may have recorded it in the spring of 1983 at The Hit Factory in New York City, but it does not appear in Sony's database of Springsteen recording sessions. It was also recorded and released by Killer Joe on their 1991 album Scene Of The Crime. Moreover, Max Weinberg stated that \"the E Street Band played the song but never recorded it\" in the liner notes for that album.\n\nON THE PROWL uncirculating\n\nNote: Recorded at Power Station on April 30, 1982. Bruce performed part of the song (mixing it into Little Richard's \"Lucille\") at the Stone Pony in August 1982. However the only known complete, stand-alone performance of the song (i.e. with all its verses) was during a guest appearance on October 3, 1982. Recorded prior to the live performances, not after, as once thought.\n\nONE LOVE 4:40 LM-16 / UH / GS\n\nNote: Three known takes of this simple, bouncy number, all dubbed to a cassette at Springsteen's home studio in Los Angeles on January 19, 1983. Just one of these takes has circulated, on Lost Masters 16. Considered for use as a b-side in March 1983 - perhaps it was worked on a little more at the Hit Factory, but it doesn't appear in the logs.\n\nOPEN ALL NIGHT - V1 1:24 FFOD / HNWB WANDA (OPEN ALL NIGHT) - V2 take 1 uncirculating WANDA (OPEN ALL NIGHT) - V3a take 2 mix 1 2:50 LM-1 OPEN ALL NIGHT - V3b take 2 mix 2 2:51 NEBRASKA OPEN ALL NIGHT - V3c take 2 mix 3 stereo mix 2:48 NEBRASKA OPEN ALL NIGHT - V4 uncirculating\n\nNote: In early 1981 Springsteen took the storyline and lyrics from 1979 River outtake \"Living On The Edge Of The World\" to create a new composition, \"Open All Night\". The first audio we have is a curious solo acoustic demo that was recorded at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ during a gap in the River Tour in late March or early April 1981. The opening verses of this demo are lifted from \"Living On The Edge Of The World\", while the third is from another Born In The U.S.A. outtake, \"This Hard Land\". Two takes were included on Springsteen's demo tape, V2 and V3. Both were recorded between December 17, 1981 and January 3, 1982, also at Colts Neck; only V3 has surfaced in three different mixes. The only song on Nebraska with electric guitar accompaniment. Springsteen used the title \"Wanda (Open All Night)\" in an early song line-up. A number of takes were recorded by Springsteen at the Power Station on April 27, 1982. It is unknown if these are with the band or solo, and any completed recordings remain in the vault.\n\nOUT OF WORK V1 uncirculating OUT OF WORK V2 2:53 GUEST: LINE / 1982 single\n\nNote: Recorded at The Hit Factory in January or February 1982 (V1). Probably the same core recording as V2 found on the U.S. Bonds album (i.e. the E Street Band, including Bruce's guitar) – but with the Springsteen lead vocal. Springsteen filed a copyright on April 27, 1982.\n\nPINK CADILLAC - V1 uncirculating PINK CADILLAC - V2 take 2 5:21 LM-1 / HNWB / MT2 PINK CADILLAC - V3a 3:45 BUERM / 1984AC PINK CADILLAC - V3b 4:21 private cdr PINK CADILLAC - V3c 3:33 1984 b-side PINK CADILLAC - V3d 3:33 TRACKS / 1984 b-side / CAST PINK CADILLAC - V4 3:55 GUEST: STANDING\n\nNote: Two acoustic takes were recorded around January 3, 1982 at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ. \"Pink Cadillac\" was one of the few songs from the acoustic Nebraska not to be recorded with the band in the May 1982 sessions at the Power Station, but V3 was recorded on May 31, 1983 at The Hit Factory in New York. Officially released in May 1984 as the b-side to \"Dancing In The Dark\". V3b has the complete ending, V3c is a mono mix that for some reason was only issued on the Japanese single. Included on a 1984 album artwork prototype, in place of both \"No Surrender\" and \"I'm Goin' Down\". Interestingly, the song was copyrighted on April 7, 1983, almost two months before the Hit Factory session. The January 1982 acoustic recording was considered for Tracks, as it was included on a June 1998 six-CD sample set alongside the acoustic \"Born In The U.S.A.\". V4 is the duet version recorded for Jerry Lee Lewis's 2006 album Last Man Standing. For a bizarre footnote, see the 1983 Bette Midler incident.\n\nPROTECTION - V1 3:30 LM-4 / MI / GS / MILM / UH / BUERM PROTECTION - V2 3:35 GUEST: DONNA SUMMER / 1983 single PROTECTION - V3 uncirculated\n\nNote: In early 1982 renowned producer David Geffen contacted Jon Landau to ask if Springsteen would write a song for Donna Summer, the first artist signed to Geffen Records. In response, Bruce wrote \"Cover Me\", but after hearing it, Landau said, \"You aren't giving this one away.\" Even though he disagreed, Springsteen wrote another song, \"Protection\", in early February. V1 of \"Protection\" was recorded by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at The Hit Factory on February 23, 1982, and was registered with the U.S. Copyright Office on March 8, 1982. A demo of \"Protection\" was sent to Summer and her producer, Quincy Jones, and it was arranged for Roy Bittan and Bruce to fly out to Los Angeles to cut the track. On March 8, they arrived at Westlake Audio Studios, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles where Summer's tenth album, Donna Summer, was in production. Bruce struck up a friendly relationship with Jones, with whom he would work again in 1985, recording \"We Are The World\". He also apparently got along with Donna, sleeping on her couch that evening as they worked on the song. He played guitar and provided backing vocals for the recording, which was cut over multiple takes. Quincy was thoroughly impressed, later saying Bruce \"was one of the nicest people I have ever worked with. The man has more musical knowledge than a lot of people think and has a deep sense of commitment to music. You could feel his spirit in the sessions.\" \"Protection\" was issued as the sixth track on Donna Summer, released on July 19, 1982. The album did not have the success of her disco records of the 1970s, but she was nominated for the 'Best Female Rock Vocal Performance' Grammy for \"Protection\" in 1983.\n\nA vocal duet version (V3) of \"Protection\" also exists, but the recording does not currently circulate. Note that six short acoustic demos of a song titled \"Protection\" were recorded during The River sessions in 1979 and included on 'Lost Masters Volume VIII'. Other than the title, they bear little in common musically or lyrically with this track.\n\nREASON TO BELIEVE - V1a take 1 4:00 LM-1 REASON TO BELIEVE - V1b take 1 4:02 NEBRASKA REASON TO BELIEVE - V1c take 1 stereo mix 3:56 NEBRASKA REASON TO BELIEVE - V2 take 2 uncirculating REASON TO BELIEVE - V3 3:34 private REASON TO BELIEVE - V4 0:50 private REASON TO BELIEVE - V5 uncirculating\n\nNote: On January 3, 1982 two complete recordings were made but only one has surfaced, which is take #1. This take circulates in three different mixes. The second (unused) take has an extra verse. Inspired by Springsteen's own experience driving down Highway 33 on his way to Millstone, a township in Monmouth County. V3 is a full-band rehearsal (missing the opening lines) of the song Springsteen recorded solo in January 1982. This performance is a work-in-progress, with some lyrical variation including an extra third verse, suggesting it was recorded before \"Reason To Believe\" was completed, probably during a band get-together at Springsteen's house some time between the end of the River Tour and late December 1982. The first verse is sung by Springsteen alone accompanied by electric guitar, before drum and bass join in for the rest of the song. A driving beat features throughout. V4 is a short take of just the second verse. V5 is multiple studio takes from April 27–28, 1982 at Power Station. These takes could be solo or with the band.\n\nREFRIGERATOR BLUES uncirculating\n\nNote: Uncirculated track from the sessions, recorded at The Hit Factory on February 16, 1984.\n\nRICHFIELD WHISTLE - V1 6:28 LM-18 / UH RICHFIELD WHISTLE - V2 uncirculating\n\nNote: \"Richfield Whistle\" V1 was recorded on April 24, 1983, at Thrill Hill Recording, Hollywood Hills, California. Developed from the 1981-83 work-in-progress composition \"James Lincoln Deer\". V2 recorded with the band at The Hit Factory on May 27 and June 10, 1983.\n\nROBERT FORD AND JESSE JAMES - V1 1:15 FFOD / HNWB JESSE JAMES - V2 4:10 LM-10 JESSE JAMES - V3 1:39 LM-10 ROBERT FORD - V4 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1 recorded at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ from late March to early April, 1981 just a snippet, with mostly unintelligible lyrics. V2 from Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ from mid-September 1981 thru May 1982, no relation to \"Jesse James\" from the We Shall Overcome - The Seeger Sessions album. May be related to \"Robert Ford And Jesse James\" which was demoed in early 1981. Some lyrics are eventually reused in \"Outlaw Pete\". V4 recorded at Power Station on April 27, 1982; this is probably a solo take. Also known as \"Robert Ford And Jesse James\".\n\nROCKAWAY THE DAYS 4:40 TRACKS\n\nNote: Recorded on January 12, 1984 at The Hit Factory, New York, NY. The recording date listed on Tracks (February 3) could be a mixing date.\n\nROLL AWAY THE STONE uncirculating\n\nNote: Uncirculated track from the sessions, recorded November 30, 1983 at The Hit Factory.\n\nSAVIN' UP V1 uncirculating SAVIN' UP V2 4:20 GUEST: RESCUE / 1983 single SAVIN' UP V3 5:09 GUEST: ENDOFTHEROAD\n\nNote: Recorded at The Hit Factory on January 25 and/or February 23, 1982. Song considered for Gary U.S. Bonds but not used – donated in 1983 to Clarence Clemons & The Red Bank Rockers for their debut album Rescue (V2, with Springsteen on guitar). V3 is a duet recorded with John Luraschi for his farewell album in 2008.\n\nSEVEN TEARS 1:56 LM-16 / GS / MT2\n\nNote: Short but sweet. The 'Lost Masters' liner notes say it was recorded January 4, 1983 at Springsteen's home studio in the Hollywood Hills - this may be an error as studio logs only list one take, recorded February 15, 1983.\n\nSHUT DOWN uncirculating\n\nNote: Uncirculated track, recorded October 26, 1983 at The Hit Factory.\n\nSHUT OUT THE LIGHT - V1a 4:33 LM-16 / UH SHUT OUT THE LIGHT - V1b 3:25 LM-18 SHUT OUT THE LIGHT - V1c 3:56 1984 b-side / BACK SHUT OUT THE LIGHT - V1d 3:51 TRACKS\n\nNote: All of the above use the same core recording from January 19, 1983 at Springsteen's home studio in Los Angeles, but four different mixes. V1a is considered by many to be the definitive version of the song – it contains two additional verses that were cut from the three other mixes. V1c contains a violin part courtesy of Soozie Tyrell that she overdubbed, probably on May 23 or 25, 1983 at The Hit Factory (her first session work for Bruce). V1d brings the violin more to the fore in the mix. \"Shut Out The Light\" was considered for the album before it was released in 1984 as the b-side to \"Born In The U.S.A.\". The theme of a Vietnam veteran returning home was also explored in the 1981 demo \"Vietnam\", which also includes the opening couplet \"The runway rushed up at him as he felt the wheels touch down / He stood out on the blacktop and took a taxi into town.\"\n\nSTAND ON IT - V1 3:03 TRACKS STAND ON IT - V2 2:30 1985 b-side / TRP / BACK\n\nNote: Recorded on June 16, 1983 at The Hit Factory, New York. V2 was released as the b-side of the single \"Glory Days\" on May 22, 1985. V1, which is possibly the original take that V2 was mixed from, contains an additional verse and complete ending, both missing from the single release. It was released on Disc 3 of Tracks in 1998.\n\nSTOP THE WAR - V1 3:48 private STOP THE WAR - V2 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1 is a full band rehearsal, probably from late 1981 at Springsteen's house in Colts Neck. Well developed and practised, it's no surprise that \"Stop The War\" was later recorded at Power Station on May 5-6, 1982 (V2). An upbeat and promising song about a failing relationship crippled by argument. The opening line of the song, \"I pull you close but when we kiss girl I can feel a doubt\", would later be found in \"I'm Goin' Down\".\n\nSUGARLAND - V1 0:08 LM-17 SUGARLAND - V2 rockabilly 2:39 LM-17 / GS SUGARLAND - V3 rockabilly 2:35 LM-16 / GT / GS SUGARLAND - V4 country 2:17 LM-16 / GS SUGARLAND - V5 acoustic 2:41 LM-19 / UH / MILM / GS / BUOR SUGARLAND - V6 rock 2:39 LM-18 SUGARLAND - V7 uncirculating\n\nNote: Takes recorded January 18, 19, and 30 and February 7, 8, 14, and 17, 1983 at Springsteen's home studio in Los Angeles. Five full takes circulate, all complete performances in varying arrangements - V1 is a false start included here for completeness. V2 is rockabilly, recorded January 30, 1983 according to the 'Lost Masters' liner notes. V3 and V6 (from January 18) are more rock-oriented, and appear to have the same vocal take. The only differences between the two may be in the backing music, or the mix. The 'Lost Masters' liner notes consider V4 to be in a country-style, but is actually more of a Cajun style. These arrangements pale in comparison to V5 which is quiet and atmospheric and the definitive version. Later recorded at The Hit Factory in May 1983, presumably now with a band backing: V7 is fourteen takes on May 25, 1983. Performed live twice in 1984 on the Born In The U.S.A. Tour, but never since. An early Tracks six-CD sample set from June 1998 indicates that \"Sugarland\" was considered for Tracks, but ultimately rejected.\n\nSWOOP MAN uncirculating\n\nNote: Uncirculated track from The Hit Factory in New York, recorded November 30, 1983.\n\nTHE KLANSMAN 2:54 LM-16 / UH / BUOR\n\nNote: Compelling song about a boy's indoctrination into the Ku Klux Klan, recorded at Springsteen's home studio in Los Angeles. The Lost Masters liner notes say it was recorded January 4, 1983 - this may be an error as studio logs only list one take, recorded March 10, 1983.\n\nTHE MONEY WE DIDN'T MAKE uncirculating\n\nNote: Uncirculated track recorded February 15, 1983.\n\nTHIS HARD LAND - V1 4.46 TRACKS / THLRR / UH / SQBI / MI / GS THIS HARD LAND - V2 4.50 THLBP / THLBB / MAT / CAST THIS HARD LAND - V3 uncirculating THIS HARD LAND - V4 1:57 YBNT2 / BB THIS HARD LAND - V5 4:40 DDITV THIS HARD LAND - V6 4:48 GREATEST THIS HARD LAND - V7 5:40 private\n\nNote: V1 and V2 recorded at the Power Station (not The Hit Factory, as the Tracks liner notes suggest) on May 11, 13, and 14, 1982. Springsteen returned to it with more takes recorded on January 3 and 15, 1983 at his home studio in Los Angeles, designated V3. Re-recorded in January 1995 at The Hit Factory, New York City during the Greatest Hits sessions. Frank Pagano guests on percussion instruments. V4 is the brief snippet shown in the Blood Brothers video that accompanied Greatest Hits. V5 and V6 are two different recordings, though very similar, and V7 is a full take marked as take #3, with mandolin, accordion, and an extended coda. After all these rerecordings, a 1982 Born In The U.S.A. studio session version was issued on Tracks a few years after the Greatest Hits sessions concluded.\n\nTRUE LOVE IS HARD TO COME BY - V1 0:30 LM-10 TRUE LOVE IS HARD TO COME BY - V2 0.15 LM-10 TRUE LOVE IS HARD TO COME BY - V3 1:40 LM-10 TRUE LOVE IS HARD TO COME BY - V4 1:10 LM-10 TRUE LOVE IS HARD TO COME BY - V5 1:25 LM-10 TRUE LOVE IS HARD TO COME BY - V6 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1-V5 are acoustic demos recorded January-April 1982. V3 is solely harmonies, V4 features lyrics similar to \"Dollhouse\". V5 has lyrics from \"Janey Don't You Lose Heart\". V6 recorded with the band at The Hit Factory on June 2, 1983. Shortlisted for Tracks.\n\nTV MOVIE - V1 2:40 private TV MOVIE - V2a 2:34 LM-19 / UH TV MOVIE - V2b 2:39 TRACKS\n\nNote: V1 is a band rehearsal from Colts Neck, probably from around late 1981. Very similar to V2, the final studio recording cut on June 13, 1983 and issued on Tracks. Two different mixes known; V2a has saxophone; V2b has the saxophone deleted.\n\nUNDER THE BIG SKY uncirculating\n\nNote: Uncirculated track from the sessions, recorded November 30, 1983 at The Hit Factory. Springsteen may have returned to this song for Tracks, as a song titled \"Under A Big Sky\" was recorded in April 1998.\n\nUNSATISFIED HEART - V1 5:22 LM-17 / UH / GS UNSATISFIED HEART - V2 uncirculating UNSATISFIED HEART - V3 5:38 uncirculating\n\nNote: Two known takes are listed in studio logs from Thrill Hill Recording in Los Angeles, March 24 and April 16, 1983. It is unknown which of these two takes is the one circulating. V3 was recorded on June 13, 1983 at the Hit Factory, New York. One take only was recorded on this date, with a 5:38 running time, but is not yet released. \"Unsatisfied Heart\" shares many lyrics with \"Fugitive's Dream\", takes of which are known to have been recorded on March 24, raising the possibility that the circulating takes of both songs were recorded on the same day.\n\nUSED CARS - V1 3:17 FFOD / HNWB USED CARS - V2 2:30 FFOD / HNWB USED CARS - V3 2:45 FFOD / HNWB USED CARS - V4 uncirculating USED CARS - V5 uncirculating USED CARS - V6 take 1 uncirculating USED CARS - V7a take 2 3:00 LM-1 USED CARS - V7b take 2 3:01 NEBRASKA USED CARS - V7c take 2 stereo mix 2:59 NEBRASKA USED CARS - V8 uncirculating\n\nNote: V1–V3 are acoustic demos recorded at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ from mid-September to December 1981, similar to the released version with some lyrical and melodic variations. Then four different, complete, recordings were made - only one has surfaced (three mixes). Take 1 was \"a little dirty recording wise,\" according to Springsteen. V8 was cut during sessions at the Power Station on April 30, 1982, and could either be solo or with the band.\n\nWAGES OF SIN - V1 2:00 LM-10 WAGES OF SIN - V2 0:20 LM-10 WAGES OF SIN - V3 3:05 LM-10 WAGES OF SIN - V4 5:10 LM-10 WAGES OF SIN - V5 4:49 TRACKS\n\nNote: V1–V4 make up an interesting group of acoustic demo takes recorded at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, NJ during January–April 1982. V4 is most like the final version on Tracks, recorded at Power Station on May 10, 1982. Note that \"Wages Of Sin\" #3, track 13 on 'Lost Masters Volume 10' is a different work-in-progress song, \"Bells Of San Salvador\".\n\nA THOUSAND TEARS (WILLIAM DAVIS) - V1 uncirculating WILLIAM DAVIS - V2 uncirculating\n\nNote: First recorded under the title \"A Thousand Tears (William Davis)\" at Power Station Studios on January 31 and February 1, 1980. Springsteen would return to the song on April 27 and 28, 1982, with the working title, \"William Davis\", during the early days of the Born In The U.S.A. sessions. These takes could be solo or with some band accompaniment. No audio circulates.\n\nWORKIN' ON IT uncirculating\n\nNote: Recorded at The Hit Factory on January 25, 1982. An uncirculated song from the same session that gave us \"Cover Me\" and the Gary U.S. Bonds tracks.\n\nWORKING ON THE HIGHWAY - V1 3:25 private WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY - V2 3:18 MI / THLRR / BUERM / TDB WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY - V3 3:35 private cdr WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY - V4a 3:09 LM-19 / UH / GS WORKING ON THE HIGHWAY - V4b 3:10 BITUSA\n\nNote: Springsteen took the lyrics of January 1982's \"Child Bride\" and wrote an entirely new rock melody to create \"Working On The Highway\". V1 is a Colts Neck full band performance that appears to predate the \"Child Bride\" recording, since it has a completely different final verse from both \"Child Bride\" and the final studio take of \"Working On The Highway\". This song lacks the \"We lit out down to Florida\" verse entirely, and replaces it with the protagonist suggesting that he wants to see her father to say \"my love is pure and true,\" but first he must \"drop a two lane blacktop from here to Timbuktu.\" There are also a few minor lyrical elements closer to \"Child Bride\", for example parts of lines three and four are reversed, as they are in the Nebraska outtake. V2–V4 recorded at Power Station on April 30 and May 6, 1982.\n\nYOUR LOVE IS ALL AROUND ME - V1 5:51 LM-10 YOUR LOVE IS ALL AROUND ME - V2 3:18 LM-10 YOUR LOVE IS ALL AROUND ME - V3 0:49 LM-10 YOUR LOVE IS ALL AROUND ME - V4 1:07 private YOUR LOVE IS ALL AROUND ME - V5 3:28 private YOUR LOVE IS ALL AROUND ME - V6 uncirculating"
