        "text": "Info | Hospital | Private Residence\n\nBruce Springsteen is born at the Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, New Jersey, on September 23. The first child of parents Adele (Zerilli) Springsteen and Douglas Springsteen. Bruce's paternal grandfather was 50% Dutch (Springsteen lineage) and 50% Irish (O'Hagen lineage). Bruce's paternal grandmother was 100% Irish (McNicholl lineage). Both Bruce's maternal grandparents were born in Italy and were of 100% Italian lineage. So, although 'Springsteen' is a Dutch surname, Bruce's ethnic heritage is actually a mixture of Dutch, Irish, and Italian. This Randolph Street house (which no longer exists) was owned and occupied at the time by Bruce's paternal grandparents (Fred and Alice). Bruce's parents were merely staying there for a few years while they accumulated a deposit to buy their own place."
