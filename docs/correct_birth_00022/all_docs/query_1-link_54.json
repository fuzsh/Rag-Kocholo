        "text": "Bruce Springsteen was already a star before Born in the USA... but that album made him an icon.\n\nNot many artists are still producing their best work over a decade into their careers. Even fewer are selling anywhere near as many records as they used to.\n\nBut then not many artists are like Bruce Springsteen.\n\nBruce Springsteen gives young fan a lovely hug during his live show in Belfast\n\nBruce Springsteen's Vietnam intro to 'The River' is one of the most tear-jerking moments in rock\n\nListen to the Gold Greats Live Playlist on Global Player, the home of Gold\n\nThe Boss had already released six classic albums by the time we inched toward the middle of the 1980s.\n\nHe'd started the decade with the chart-topping The River before scaling things right back for follow-up Nebraska.\n\nThen he went supernova with Born in the USA. 40 years on, we're taking a closer look at Springsteen's most successful masterpiece.\n\nWhen was Born in the USA recorded, and when was it released?\n\nAfter the critical acclaim of his early albums, Bruce Springsteen really broke through with his third record – 1975's Born to Run.\n\nHe got deeper and grimier on Darkness on the Edge of Town, before an explosion of creativity with the double album The River in 1980.\n\nThen came something of a side-step. He started writing his next album in the autumn of 1981, starting with a song called 'Vietnam', inspired by Ron Kovic's memoir Born on the Fourth of July (later to be made into a film by Oliver Stone starring Tom Hanks), and met several war veterans.\n\nThat song morphed into 'Born in the USA', named after an unnamed movie by Paul Schrader for which Bruce was asked to write the music.\n\nThen came a flurry of more songs, and Bruce laid down some four-track demos at his Colts Neck home between December 17, 1981, and January 3, 1982, with the intention of recording them properly with the E Street Band.\n\nAnd they tried... but the only problem was that little of the album-to-be matched the incredible raw beauty of those demos. So the so-called Electric Nebraska was shelved, and the stripped-back demos were released as the Nebraska album in 1982.\n\nOn some of the songs, the band absolutely nailed it. At the Power Station in New York City in April 1982 they put down a load of future classics.\n\nThere were more sessions at the Hit Factory in May and June 1983, and yet more sessions that October, and even into 1984.\n\nSo between January 1982 and March 1984, Bruce and the band had 70 to 90 songs recorded.\n\n\"By that time, I'd recorded a lot of music,\" he wrote in 2016's Born to Run.\n\n\"But in the end, I circled back to my original groups of songs. There I found a naturalism and aliveness that couldn't be argued with. They weren't exactly what I'd been looking for, but they were what I had.\"\n\nBorn in the USA was released on June 4, 1984.\n\nWho plays on Born in the USA apart from Bruce Springsteen?\n\nBruce Springsteen had been playing with the E Street Band since way back in the autumn of 1972, even though the group didn't formally get that name for another couple of years.\n\nBut while his live tours – and the Live 1975–85 compilation – are credited to Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, the Boss's studio albums are always released simply under the name Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe preceding Nebraska really was a totally solo Bruce Springsteen album, with Bruce playing absolutely everything on the album all by himself, including guitar, harmonica, mandolin, glockenspiel, tambourine, Hammond organ and synthesizer, as well as singing of course.\n\nBorn in the USA is of course a full band affair, with Bruce back to his day job of vocals and guitars.\n\nHe was ably backed by the early 1980s vintage of The E Street Band, which meant Roy Bittan on piano and synthesizer, Clarence Clemons on saxophone and percussion, Danny Federici on Hammond organ, glockenspiel and piano, Garry Tallent on bass guitar, Steven Van Zandt on acoustic guitar and mandolin and Max Weinberg on drums, with backing and harmony vocals spread around the group.\n\nAs well as the E Streeters, the album featured extra backing vocals by Richie 'La Bamba' Rosenberg on 'Cover Me' and 'No Surrender', and by Ruth Jackson on 'My Hometown'.\n\nDespite its snappy coherence, the album has four listed producers: Bruce himself, his manager-producer Jon Landau, knob-twiddler Chuck Plotkin, and E Street guitarist and right-hand man Steven Van Zandt.\n\nVan Zandt actually left the E Street Band after the first batch of recordings. Buon Viaggio, mia fratello, Little Steven (\"Safe travels, my brother, Little Steven\") read a note in Italian from The Boss on the sleeve. Steve released the solo albums Men Without Women in 1982 and Voice of America in 1984.\n\nSteve was replaced by Nils Lofgren from 1984 to the E Street band's breakup in 1989. He returned for the group's short-lived 1995 get-together and then again for their proper reunion in 1999, with Nils also retaining his place in the lineup.\n\nWhat is the tracklisting of Born in the USA?\n\nOf the reported 70-90 tracks recorded for Born in the USA, the running order was eventually slashed down to just 11 tracks... and then bumped up to 12, with Steve Van Zandt successfully lobbying for the inclusion of 'No Surrender'.\n\nThe final running order of Born in the USA is as follows:\n\nBorn in the U.S.A.\n\nCover Me\n\nDarlington County\n\nWorking On the Highway\n\nDownbound Train\n\nI'm On Fire\n\nNo Surrender\n\nBobby Jean\n\nI'm Goin' Down\n\nGlory Days\n\nDancing In The Dark\n\nMy Hometown\n\nIncredibly, over half of the songs on the 12-track album were released as a single. Incredibly, all seven singles from Born in the USA were top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nFirst out of the tracks was 'Dancing in the Dark', released ahead of its parent album. Then came 'Cover Me' and 'Born in the USA' itself before 1984 was out.\n\nThe following year saw the release of 'I'm on Fire', 'Glory Days', 'I'm Goin' Down' and finally in November 1985, 'My Hometown'.\n\nWhat songs were left off Born in the USA, and have any of them been released since?\n\nExperts and Bruce-ologists like the people at Bruce Base have scoured the archives and the record and pieced together a comprehensive record of every single part of the four phases of recording for Born in the USA.\n\nOf the songs not included on the album, it's best to start with the ones we've actually heard.\n\n'Pink Cadillac' was the B-side of 'Dancing in the Dark'. 'Shut Out The Light' was on the flip of 'Born in the USA'. 'Johnny Bye Bye' was on the other side of 'I'm on Fire'. 'Stand On It' was on the B-side of 'Glory Days'. 'Janey, Don't You Lose Heart' was the B-side on 'I'm Goin' Down'.\n\nAll of those B-sides were included on 1998's Tracks compilation, as were the following previously-unreleased Born in the USA outtakes:\n\nA Good Man Is Hard To Find (Pittsburgh)\n\nMy Love Will Not Let You Down\n\nWages Of Sin\n\nThis Hard Land\n\nFrankie\n\nCynthia\n\nLion's Den\n\nCar Wash\n\nTV Movie\n\nBrothers Under The Bridges ('83)\n\nMan At The Top\n\nRockaway The Days\n\nSince then, there's only been one formally-released Born in the USA song, with 'Murder Incorporated' being included as one of the four \"new\" songs on 1995's Greatest Hits album.\n\nThen there are songs that you can possibly find, though not exactly legally:\n\nProtection\n\nThe Klansman\n\nSeven Tears\n\nFugitive's Dream\n\nOne Love\n\nBetty Jean\n\nUnsatisfied Heart\n\nLittle Girl (Like You)\n\nDelivery Man\n\nFollow That Dream\n\nSugarland\n\nDon't Back Down\n\nJames Lincoln Dear\n\nRichfield Whistle\n\nBells Of San Salvador\n\nA small number of songs are known to have passed hands among private collectors:\n\nYour Love Is All Around Me\n\nStop The War\n\nBaby I'm So Cold\n\nThen there are the songs that have never been heard by anyone outside of The Boss’s camp, including tantalising recordings of the Electric Nebraska sessions among them:\n\nOn The Prowl\n\nNebraska\n\nAtlantic City\n\nMansion On The Hill\n\nJohnny 99\n\nHighway Patrolman\n\nUsed Cars\n\nOpen All Night\n\nReason To Believe\n\nLosin' Kind\n\nFade To Black\n\nRobert Ford\n\nWilliam Davis\n\nGun In Every Home\n\nCommon Ground (Stay Hungry)\n\nTrue Love Is Hard To Come By\n\nI Don't Care\n\nThe Money We Didn't Make\n\nJohnny Go Down\n\nBody And Soul\n\nSavin' Up\n\nOut Of Work\n\nLove's On The Line\n\nClub Soul City\n\nHold On (To What You Got)\n\nWorkin' On It\n\nGone, Gone, Gone\n\nKing's Highway\n\nJust Around The Corner To The Light Of Day\n\nInvitation To Your Party\n\nBad Boy\n\nGlory Of Love\n\nShut Down\n\n100 Miles From Jackson\n\nRoll Away The Stone\n\nSwoop Man\n\nUnder The Big Sky\n\nRefrigerator Blues\n\nIda Rose (No One Knows)\n\nNow And Forever / Summer On Signal Hill\n\nWhat is the front cover of Born in the USA all about?\n\nThe front cover of Born in the USA is one of the most iconic – and controversial – in all of rock music.\n\nThe photograph was taken by premier rock snapper Annie Leibovitz and features Bruce from the back, wearing his all-American blue jeans and white T-shirt, with a red baseball cap stuffed into the back pocket\n\nIf those colours (blue, white, red) weren't enough, Bruce is standing in front of the red and white stripes of the US flag.\n\nThe presence of the flag, and the 'Born in the USA' name married to how uplifting that title track sounds has led those who never bothered to read the lyrics (and who didn't know much about Bruce Springsteen to start), to think of it the album and its sleeve as some sort of rah-rah 'go USA' patriotic/nationalist piece.\n\nObviously, anyone who listened to the words (\"Sent me off to a foreign land/ To go and kill the yellow man\") or had listened to any Bruce records before, knew his feelings about the US were much more ambiguous.\n\nSome of those people took one look at the cover, Bruce's unsighted right hand, and thought he was urinating on the flag.\n\nThere was absolutely no truth to that.\n\nThe best line about the sleeve came from the man himself, who quipped to Rolling Stone: \"The picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face\".\n\nWhere did Born in the USA get in the charts and how many copies has it sold?\n\nWe've already described Born in the USA as Bruce Sprinsgteen's biggest-selling album and mentioned its seven top 10 singles, but that doesn't start to do justice to just how massive a commercial success Born in the USA is.\n\nIn the UK, it's gone triple platinum, with sales of over 1,120,000.\n\nIn the US it's gone 17 (SEVENTEEN) times platinum, racking up sales over over 17 million copies.\n\nWorldwide sales are estimated at over 30 million.\n\nNaturally, the album went to number one in both countries, as well as in many places all over the world."
