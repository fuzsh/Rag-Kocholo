A global critical and commercial success, it found Springsteen marking a departure in his sound. While its predecessor, the dark and acoustic 'Nebraska', featured songs of pessimism and isolation, 'Born in the U.S.A.'s lyrics expressed signs of hope in the daily fight of the ordinary American in following the American Dream, a new feeling complemented by synthesized arrangements and a pop-flavored, radio-oriented sound that helped Springsteen to extend his popularity and appeal to mainstream audiences. 'Born in the U.S.A.' was the best-selling album of 1985 in the United States (and Springsteen's most successful album ever), selling 15 million copies in the U.S alone, and 30 million worldwide.\n\nTrack List:\n\nSide A\n\nBorn In The U.S.A.\n\nCover Me\n\nDarlington County\n\nWorking On The Highway\n\nDownbound Train\n\nI'm On Fire\n\nSide B\n\nNo Surrender\n\nBobby Jean\n\n3.
