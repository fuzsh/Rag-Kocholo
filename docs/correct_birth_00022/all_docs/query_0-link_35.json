        "text": "House has five rooms%2C one bath\n\nAll three owners willing to sell their share\n\nDylan once got lost looking for this house\n\nLONG BRANCH, N.J. -- Here's your chance to live like the Boss.\n\nA cottage at 7 1/2 West End Court in Long Branch, where one-time renter Bruce Springsteen wrote \"Born to Run\" is up for sale for $349,900, said real estate agent Susan McLaughlin of Keller Williams Realty.\n\n\"It went on sale Friday, and I've had about 40 calls and another 40 contacts, mainly through emails,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nThe house, described as a \"Landmark Jersey Shore Cottage\" by McLaughlin, has five rooms, two bedrooms and one bath.\n\nThere are three owners. Only one of the owners is a resident, and he's getting married and looking to sell and move out. The other two owners each would be willing to sell their third of the house, McLaughlin said.\n\nSpringsteen lived in the house in 1974 and 1975 and composed his breakthrough album \"Born to Run\" there. The house is the spot, according to local lore, that Bob Dylan was looking for when he was detained by Long Branch police in 2009, McLaughlin said.\n\n\"(Dylan) was visiting the former homes of Jim Morrison and a number of rock stars, just looking to get the feel of the music and pick up the vibes of these properties,\" McLaughlin said. In Long Branch, \"he (mistakenly) went to West End Avenue and this is West End Court.\"\n\nMcLaughlin hopes the city of Long Branch will buy the house and turn it into a music heritage destination.\n\n\"Buses of tourists stop there all the time,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nLong Branch Mayor Adam Schneider was noncommittal Wednesday night.\n\n\"A museum would be fun (at the house) but as a practical matter I don't think it's going to happen,' Schneider said. \"I don't think we can buy the home with taxpayers money.\"\n\n\"Now if Springsteen could perform a benefit concert...\"\n\nThe house was last on the market in 2009."
