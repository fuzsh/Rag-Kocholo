With eighteen Grammy awards, an Oscar, and untold record sales to his credit, Bruce is among the most successful entertainers of our time. His ballads and anthems cross all generations and speak to all people. He is, in the truest sense of the word, a hero to millions of working class Americans. Born in Long Branch and most frequently associated with Asbury Park, Bruce exudes a love for New Jersey than is evident in his music, and his generous support for causes across our great state."
