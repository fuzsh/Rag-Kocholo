        "text": "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced on Saturday that the state will declare a Bruce Springsteen Day to pay tribute to the famous American music maker.\n\nSpringsteen was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, back in 1949. According to Murphy, September 23 will officially be declared Bruce Springsteen Day to honour his birthday.\n\n\"Bruce Springsteen will forever be remembered as the voice of the Garden State, signaling to the world that New Jerseyans were born to run,\" the proclamation reads.\n\nNJ.com reported that the New Jersey governor revealed the holiday at American Music Honors awards at the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University.\n\n\"Bruce Springsteen is one of the most recognizable, iconic and influential musicians - and New Jerseyans - of all time,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"It is important that we recognize Bruce for all he has done and will continue to do, from giving us the gift of his music to lending his time to the causes close to his heart.\"\n\n\"I know my place in the hierarchy of New Jersey. After all, I may be the 56th individual to be called 'governor,' but there will ever only be just one 'Boss.'\n\n\"Thank you for showing the world what it means to live our New Jersey values.\""
