        "text": "(born 1949). After emerging on the East Coast music scene in the early 1970s, Bruce Springsteen reached a national audience with the album Born to Run (1975) and eventually became an international rock superstar. He won fans with both his character-driven songs, often reflecting his concern for the working class, and his legendary live performances. Performing sometimes on his own but more often with his longtime partners in the E Street Band, Springsteen remained a vital artist into the 21st century.\n\nSpringsteen was born in Freehold, New Jersey, on September 23, 1949. He got his first guitar after seeing Elvis Presley perform on a television show in 1956. In the 1960s he began playing in bands along the New Jersey shore, particularly in the town of Asbury Park. In 1972 he auditioned for John Hammond at Columbia Records, who signed him to the label. Backed by a talented group of local musicians known as the E Street Band, Springsteen released his first two albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, in 1973. Both earned some stellar reviews but sold poorly beyond his cult following in the Northeast.\n\nSpringsteen’s breakthrough came with the release of the album Born to Run in 1975. Its songs featured dramatic tales of urban youth paired with Springsteen’s passionate vocals and a densely layered rock sound. His next album—the darker, tougher Darkness on the Edge of Town—appeared in 1978. The River (1980) provided Springsteen’s first international hit single, “Hungry Heart,” but by then he was best known for his energetic three- and four-hour concerts. His next album, Nebraska (1982), was a stark set of acoustic songs. It was followed by Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which produced seven hit singles and sold more than 15 million copies. The album and the subsequent 18-month world tour lifted Springsteen to a new level of fame.\n\nFollowing the blockbuster success of Born in the U.S.A., Springsteen scaled back his sound. Tunnel of Love (1987) was a collection of intensely personal songs about intimate relationships. In late 1989, following his Tunnel of Love tour, Springsteen disbanded the E Street Band. After a five-year hiatus from recording he released the pop-oriented Human Touch and Lucky Town (both 1992), which explored his feelings about parenting and adulthood. His hit single “Streets of Philadelphia” (1994), featured on the soundtrack of the film Philadelphia, earned him four Grammy Awards as well as an Academy Award.\n\nSpringsteen’s next release, The Ghost of Tom Joad (1995), returned to the style of his Nebraska album. It was a mostly acoustic set of songs examining the plight of immigrants in the United States. It was his first album not to go platinum, though it earned a Grammy Award for best contemporary folk album. Choosing midsize venues over the massive arenas and stadiums he formerly played, Springsteen supported the album with a solo acoustic U.S. and world tour in 1995–97.\n\nIn 1999 Springsteen reunited the E Street Band. They spent a year touring with him, resulting in a live album (Live in New York City [2001]) but only a handful of new songs. In late September 2001 Springsteen performed the national debut of his song “My City of Ruins” on a television special. “My City of Ruins” had been written about Asbury Park, but it took on a different tone in the wake of the September 11 attacks. That tone continued on The Rising, Springsteen’s 2002 album with the E Street Band, which weighed the consequences of the terrorist attacks. Beginning on the Rising tour, Springsteen became a strong critic of the U.S. government, especially regarding the Iraq War. These developments culminated in his participation in the 2004 Vote for Change tour in support of Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.\n\nIn 2005 Springsteen embarked on a solo tour following the release of the album Devils and Dust. The album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (2006) was made over a period of 10 years and used a folk-roots band and a horn section. It featured traditional American folk songs as well as songs associated with its inspiration, folksinger Pete Seeger. Springsteen’s tour of the United States and Europe in 2006 featured a 20-piece band.\n\nMagic (2007), another E Street Band album, spoke sometimes metaphorically and sometimes explicitly in opposition to the war and government intrusions on civil liberties. Springsteen continued his commentary through a worldwide tour with the E Street Band in 2007 and 2008. The album Working on a Dream, released in 2009, concerned itself lyrically with thoughts of love and life and how fleeting both are. In 2009 Springsteen and the band were the featured entertainment at halftime during professional football’s Super Bowl XLIII. Wrecking Ball (2012) was another politically charged album that incorporated a broad range of sounds, including mariachi horns, strings, Celtic pipes, fiddles, synthesizers and samples, and a gospel choir. High Hopes (2014) was a collection of cover songs, new recordings of old Springsteen songs, and outtakes from earlier albums.\n\nSpringsteen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. In 2009 he was awarded the Kennedy Center Honors."
