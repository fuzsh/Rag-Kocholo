        "text": "Springsteen: His Hometown\n\nThe exhibit “Springsteen: His Hometown” opened to much fanfare at the Monmouth County Historical Association (MCHA) at 70 Court Street in Freehold in September 2019. Co-curated by Professor Melissa Ziobro of the Department of History and Anthropology and MCHA Curator of Collections Bernadette Rogoff, with support from Eileen Chapman and Bob Santelli of the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University, the exhibit started as a class project in Ziobro’s fall 2018 museums and archives class. It features more than 150 items from the Springsteen Archives and guitars, clothing, jewelry, and other items from Springsteen himself, who joined the curators and guests at the exhibit preview party on Saturday, Sept. 28. The exhibit will be open through fall 2020. It has enjoyed much local and national news coverage thus far, see, for example:\n\nNew York Post: Bruce Springsteen exhibit to open in his New Jersey hometown\n\nRolling Stone Magazine: See Bruce Springsteen’s Surprise ‘Light of Day’ at Exhibit Opening Gala\n\nBillboard: Bruce Springsteen ‘His Hometown’ Exhibit Will Showcase 150 Rare Items\n\nVariety: Bruce Springsteen Exhibit Draws the Boss Himself for Surprise Performance (Watch)\n\nBruce Springsteen exhibit in hometown to feature never-before-seen items\n\nTracking Sandy: Monmouth County Remembers\n\nIn 2012, Superstorm Sandy swept ashore and disrupted the lives of countless residents along the east coast. In 2016, the Department began to collaborate with the Monmouth County Historical Association (MCHA) to create an exhibition marking the fifth anniversary of the Storm. Over the course of a year, the exhibit team partnered with libraries, churches, community centers, local government, and the general public in a crowdsourcing initiative to compile the story. Professor Melissa Ziobro, who served as MCHA’s guest curator for the project, noted at the time, “This is a unique opportunity to allow the citizens of Monmouth County to create their own living archive of what some have called a ‘100 year storm’.” MCHA President Linda Bricker concurred, saying, “Sandy should not be forgotten after altering the lives of so many people and communities in such a dramatic way. It is a story that will be of great interest to future generations and which should be documented while those impacted can relate personal experiences.” Several Monmouth University students assisted Professor Ziobro in the preparation of the exhibit.\n\nThe exhibition was open at the MCHA headquarters in Freehold from October 2017- October 2018.\n\nPhotos:"
