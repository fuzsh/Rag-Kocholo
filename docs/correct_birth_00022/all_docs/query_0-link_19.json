        "text": "Newark, NJ home featured in ‘The Sopranos’ can be yours for $580K\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nThe New Jersey home of fictional mobster Tony Soprano's uncle is for sale. The center-hall Colonial at 380 Highland Avenue in Newark appeared in the HBO show \"The Sopranos\" as the home of Corrado John \"Junior\" Soprano, the boss of the DiMeo crime family. Asking $579,900, the four-bedroom property is located in the charming neighborhood of Forest Hill, a tree-lined suburban area north of downtown Newark.\n\nsee it here\n\nThis Bauhaus-inspired Montclair, N.J. home is asking $3.5M\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\n\"Bauhaus-inspired\" architecture brings to mind solid geometric forms, once thought to be radically simplified, yet enduring and functional. This custom-built home in Montclair, New Jersey is the result of bringing craftsmanship and smart technology together. Asking $3,500,00, this high-end suburban property at 251 South Mountain Avenue has five bedrooms and six baths, floor-to-ceiling windows, a tremendous modern fireplace, a heated driveway, and a three-car garage.\n\ntake the tour\n\nThis $3.2M waterfront house on the Hudson in Edgewater, NJ, would be right at home in Malibu\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nWhen we think of homes on the Hudson River, we don't usually envision glass-walled waterfront houses like the ones we've seen perched on southern California cliffs. This three-bedroom home at 23 Shore Road in Edgewater, New Jersey, asking $3,249,000, is a contemporary riverside residence reminiscent of Malibu or Miami. Included in this glittering four-level property are panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline and George Washington Bridge–and a private boat dock.\n\nmalibu on the hudson, this way\n\nAsking $800K, this notable modern Princeton home once belonged to Joyce Carol Oates\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nLocated in the Elm Ridge Park neighborhood in Princeton, N.J., this well-preserved mid-century modern home at 9 Honey Brook Lane was built in 1962 by local architect Philip Sheridan Collins, who designed the New Jersey State Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair. Currently on the market for $800,000, the house was featured in Architectural Digest as the home of American author Joyce Carol Oates, who referred to the wooded property as an “enchanted place.\"\n\ntake the tour\n\nLive the Victorian seaside life in this $5.2M Cape May confection\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nLocated in the popular destination town of Cape May on the southernmost tip of the Jersey Shore, this colorful cottage at 24 Jackson Street is surrounded by Victorian-style homes. Built in 1905, this historic property, asking $5,200,000, is a charming example of the neighborhood's eclectic architecture. The restoration of this former bed and breakfast was a true labor of love for the home's current owner, who added a full menu of modern updates while maintaining the home's historic character.\n\ntake the tour\n\nThis $1.2M Princeton home is a modernist gem designed by Otto Kolb\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nThis Otto Kolb original home at 140 Heather Lane, asking $1,195,000, is tucked into a wooded 2.39-acre lot on a quiet Princeton street. The Swiss-born Modernist architect designed this one-of-a-kind jewel box of a single-story home in 1959. Rooms in the five-bedroom house wrap around two courtyards, surrounding them with nature and sunlight.\n\nGet a closer look at this Modernist masterpiece\n\nPrinceton manor designed by Mar-a-Lago architect lists for $4.3M\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nOver the course of his 50 year career, American architect Marion Sims Wyeth designed more than 700 projects in Palm Beach, Florida, including Mar-a-Lago, former President Donald Trump's current residence. Wyeth also designed this grand Princeton, New Jersey home, recently listed for $4,250,000. Built in 1927, the seven-bedroom manor at 91-93 Edgerstoune Road sits on a little more than three acres and boasts a bucolic backyard with an outdoor pool and a pond with a pagoda.\n\nGet the details"
