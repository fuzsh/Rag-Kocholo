        "text": "LONG BRANCH – Are you born to buy a house where Bruce Springsteen lived?\n\nThe cottage at 71/2 West End Court in Long Branch where one-time renter Bruce Springsteen wrote \"Born to Run\" has been newly listed for $299,000, said George Rives Holder, a broker associate with Gloria Nilson & Co. Real Estate.\n\nThe price is down from the $349,900 that was asked in 2013.\n\nIt has two bedrooms, one full bath and it's near the ocean and the Brighton Avenue shopping district. But, perhaps more importantly, it's steeped in rock 'n' roll history. Springsteen has stated that he wrote the songs \"Born to Run,\" \"Thunder Road\" and \"Backstreets\" while living there from 1974 and '75.\n\n\"It's amazing that 'Born to Run' came out of that home,\" Holder said \"It was Springsteen's last shot at geatness and he did it.\"\n\nThe house is the spot, according to local lore, that Bob Dylan was looking for when he was detained by Long Branch police in 2009. Dylan went through a period of visiting the former homes of rock 'n' roll stars at the time.\n\n\"It can't be proven but people pretty much assume that he was looking for Bruce's house,\" Holder said. \"It's funny -- the officers didn't recognize Dylan.\"\n\nThe three current owners, who are Springsteen fans, purchased the home in 2009 for $280,000 with the intent of turning it into a museum or something similar, Holder said. There are two renters living in it now.\n\n\"The price is in line with the market now with a little bit of a premium put on it because of the historical significance of it,\" Holder said.\n\nThe house, often part of Springsteen fan tours of the Jersey Shore, will be shown to serious buyers only.\n\n\"Buyers will have to go through a vetting process,\" Holder said.\n\nEmail Holder at rholder@glorianilson.com for more information.\n\nChris Jordan: cjordan@app.com"
