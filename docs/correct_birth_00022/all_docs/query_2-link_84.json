        "text": "BRUCE Springsteen toured Australia for the first time in 1985, when I was 16. Up to that stage, he’d had a couple of minor hits here — ‘Born To Run’ and ‘Hungry Heart’ were already staples of FM radio — but was nowhere near being a household name.\n\nBut his seventh album, Born In The USA, released in 1984, had been his global smash breakthrough, and the Brian De Palma-directed video for ‘Dancing in The Dark’ was a regular on Countdown, alongside Prince’s ‘When Doves Cry’, various Madonna hits and Michael Jackson’s ‘Beat It’. The sight of Springsteen, a 30-something white man in a plain t-shirt and jeans among the splendid glamour, dangerous sexuality and androgyny of Prince, Madonna and Jacko on a television show devoted to pop music was slightly incongruous, but what did we know?\n\nWithin weeks of starting my first supermarket job, I’d used some of my pay to buy Born In The USA, and pretty soon I knew the riffs and lyrics of every song by heart.\n\nIt was the album I played when I was feeling down and needed cheering up — how could you not feel uplifted by a song like ‘Darlington County’ or ‘No Surrender’. But there was also something dark and meaningful about the stories told within those songs, of ordinary working class men and women struggling to keep their dreams alive as they confronted the realities of life in Reagan’s America.\n\nWhen Springsteen’s Australian tour was announced, a friend from school somehow got hold of a couple of tickets to Springsteen’s concert at the Melbourne Showgrounds. The Boss’s live shows were legendary: three or four hour performances which left the audience exhausted and soaking in sweat as the E Street band took them on a roller coaster of emotions.\n\nI came home excited about the gig to be met by the immovable force of my mother. It was a Wednesday night, and there was no way I was going to a rock concert on a school night, let alone on other side of town.\n\nI don’t think I talked to my mother for a week after that and 35 years later, I still haven’t fully forgiven her. It wasn’t until almost three decades on when I finally got to see Springsteen perform live at the Rod Laver Arena for his Wrecking Ball tour in 2013. Through a quirk of the ticketing system, I somehow secured front row seats in the second tier, directly adjacent to an extended part of the stage where Springsteen performed part of the concert in the middle of the crowd. And it was during that part of the concert — I believe it was ‘Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out’ — that Bruce rushed past within half a metre of me, high-fiving everyone in sight. Somehow he missed my hand, but I reached out and managed to lay a palm on his sweaty back before he was gone.\n\nAbout a fortnight before the 2020 US election, Springsteen released his 20th studio album, Letter To You. Recorded live in the studio with the E Street Band, it has been described as an elegy for his youth. The timing of the release was significant because in song, gesture and public comment, Springsteen has been a trenchant critic of Trump. Doing the publicity rounds for his new album, he predicted Trump would lose in a landslide, with the caveat that he would be moving to Australia if he was proved wrong.\n\nIt is no small irony that many of Springsteen’s biggest fans are the same people who wear red MAGA caps to Trump rallies. Springsteen has spent a career chronicling the heartbreaks, disappointments, dreams, tragedies, triumphs and adventures of the same white working class folk whose grievances Trump so effectively harnessed for his 2016 election to the White House. The same people from dying industrial towns in rust belt states with their noisy pickups and guns and simmering resentment at the lousy deck of cards life has dealt them.\n\nIn his songs, Springsteen tells short stories of these people’s lives, often bittersweet and sometimes just plain heartbreaking. His characters seek redemption and a small portion of dignity, and they often endure in the face of all odds.\n\nResilience, redemption, dignity. These have been the constant themes of his canon of work, and by articulating their lives, Springsteen has become a hero for working class white Americans. The same people who Trump sees as his base.\n\nYet Springsteen couldn’t be more different than Trump. If anything, he and Joe Biden are cut from the same cloth: both grew up in small town Catholic working class families and through a combination of luck and hard work, managed to escape. Trump, on the other hand, was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and his life has been one of privilege and inherited wealth.\n\nIn his outlook, Springsteen is a liberal; the racism, bigotry and misogyny that Trump espouses is anathema to him. Springsteen is a patriot who believes his country can and should be better.\n\nDespite his liberalism, Springsteen has often been wilfully misinterpreted by the right and his music has been appropriated by those he is politically opposed to. Perhaps this is because at his heart, Springsteen is a populist who speaks for the everyman, and he appeals to the same people Right wing populists want to vote for them.\n\nThe most famous example of this is how Springsteen’s anti-Vietnam War song, ‘Born In the USA’ was adopted by Ronald Reagan as a hairy chested anthem of American might and power, when the message in the song was the opposite of that.\n\nIn any case, it is by listening to Springsteen that we can begin to understand the anger and grievance that propelled Trump to power and drives Trumpism. Springsteen rarely offers solutions for his characters, and when he does they are vastly different than those offered by Trump and his ilk. But as we grapple with what has gone so wrong in contemporary America, revisiting Bruce Springsteen’s back catalogue helps to begin to explain it all.\n\nBut with 20 studio albums over almost half a century as a recording artist, where do you start?\n\nState Trooper\n\nFrom its cover of a grainy photo looking through a car windscreen at a storm up ahead to the subject matter, Nebraska is Springsteen’s bleakest album, conceived and recorded in the earlyl-1980s as Reaganism began to impact on working class America. The title track is based on the 1958 murder spree of Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend, which also inspired Terence Malick’s classic 1973 film Badlands, which in turn gave a title to the opening song on Springsteen’s Darkness On The Edge Of Town album. Circles within circles. The songs on Nebraska are peppered with similar stories of violence, death, crime and nihilism. The songs had been originally recorded as demos with sparse instrumentation, often just an acoustic guitar. Springsteen carried the cassette around in the back pocket of his jeans intending to record them properly with the E Street Band, but eventually concluded that the stark arrangements were the perfect pairing for the lyrics. ‘State Trooper’ is written from the perspective of a lone driver late at night on the New Jersey Turnpike, and the fact that the protagonist never actually encounters the State Trooper only makes the song more menacing. Springsteen plays a simple repetitive bluesy riff on the bass strings of his guitar, while vocally he was heavily influenced by Alan Vega of the electronic New York band Suicide with reverb and echo giving his voice an eerie, haunting quality, and those blood curling howls and screams at the end are truly frightening.\n\nBorn In The USA\n\nNot only Springsteen’s most wilfully misinterpreted song, but one of the most misunderstood of all time. Far from a flag-waving ode to patriotism exploited by American conservatives, ‘Born In The USA’ was written as a critique of the way young men were exploited for political ends in the Vietnam War, and then abandoned by their government when they returned home. This was deeply personal for Springsteen, who had spent his late-teens and early-twenties living in fear of being drafted and watching his friends and contemporaries go off to the war, some of them never to come back home. But he had mostly avoided writing about Vietnam until he read Ron Kovic’s Born On The Fourth Of July, and through its author met other damaged Vietnam vets. Springsteen wrote the song about the same time as Nebraska and the original acoustic demo has a similar bluesy, heavily echoing sound. But once the E Street Band got hold of it, it was transformed into the massive stadium filler that is both Springsteen’s signature and his burden, opening with that instantly recognisable synthesiser riff and thumping snare drums and finishing in a wild crescendo of percussion, keyboards and electric guitar. The bombastic vocal delivery and over-the-top production is not to everyone’s taste, but more than 30 years later it remains one of his most important songs from his most successful album.\n\nBorn To Run\n\nThis is where it all starts and ends for Bruce Springsteen, summoning the spirits of Dylan, Elvis and Phil Spector to produce his most enduring masterpiece. After two studio albums which had gained some critical acclaim but been commercial flops, when Springsteen entered the recording studio at the start of 1974, it was all or nothing in pursuit of his dream of stardom. This was his last roll of the dice, and he was determined to produce an epic for the ages. In his quest for perfection, Springsteen spent months labouring over the recording, adding dozens of overdubs which resulted in layers of strings, horns, keyboards and guitars competing for space in an epic wall of sound. But it would have amounted to nothing without a great song underneath. ‘Born To Run’ saw the emergence of Springsteen as a master wordsmith, combining the lyrical themes and imagery that would define his career: dreams of escape from small town blue-collar America, fast cars and the open road, do or die romance, and the redemptive power of rock and roll. He sings of a ‘runaway American dream’, a town that ‘rips the bones form your back, it’s a death trap, a suicide rap’, and the only way out is to find a fast car and hit the open road. It doesn’t matter where you’re heading, but if you hold onto your dreams someday ‘we’re gonna get to that place where we really wanna go and we’ll walk in the sun’. But until we do, we’re all destined to be born to run. Forty-five years later it has lost none of its power, and will remain a milestone in music history long after Springsteen has gone."
