        "text": "springsteen house.png\n\nThis house at 7 1/2 West End Court in Long Branch, where Bruce Springsteen wrote the 'Born to Run' album, is for sale. (Andrew Mills | The Star-Ledger)\n\nLONG BRANCH -- In their land of hopes and dreams, Jerry Ferrara and his two business partners would have renovated their beach cottage in Long Branch into a tribute to Bruce Springsteen.\n\nAfter all, Ferrara, his sister and friend - big Springsteen fans - bought that particular house six years ago for one reason: Springsteen wrote his entire \"Born to Run\" album while living there.\n\nBut now that life has taken them in different directions, the co-owners have reluctantly decided to sell it, but hope the new owners will preserve the spirit of the house.\n\n\"We probably paid more than it was worth when we bought it because of what we call 'the Bruce factor,'\" Ferrara said. \"We still think it's worth it.\"\n\nWhen Ferrara's father first suggested he buy the house in 2009, Ferrara didn't take him seriously. But soon he found himself convincing his sister, Kim McDermott and his friend Ryan DeCarolis to go into partnership with him to save the 828-square foot house a block-and-a-half from the beach from potentially being demolished.\n\nBefore they knew it, they were handing over a check for $280,000 for the opportunity to own what was to them the ultimate piece of Springsteen memorabilia.\n\n\"We'd been to a couple of auctions where people paid a ridiculous amount of money for a (Springsteen) signed guitar,\" said Ferrara, 58, of Belmar. \"To me, the house is better than that stuff. It's the place where he wrote 'Born to Run.'\"\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe plan was for DeCarolis to live there while the trio - friends who have seen more than 100 Springsteen concerts together - slowly made some renovations.\n\nThen DeCarolis got married and needed a bigger house. McDermott got divorced and Ferrara got extra busy with his construction work. They decided they didn't have the time to devote to the house.\n\nBuilt in 1920, the two-bedroom, single-bath house with a new roof, new wood floors and vinyl siding is now on the market for $299,000. Springsteen, who this year celebrated the 40th anniversary of the release of the 'Born to Run' album, has said in interviews that he wrote every song on the album, including the title track as well as \"Thunder Road,\" \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-out,\" \"Jungleland\" and \"Backstreets,\" while living there from 1974 to 1975.\n\nVisiting the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland a few years ago, McDermott said she saw at the Springsteen exhibit the round wooden table that graced the kitchen of the house while Springsteen lived there. On the table were bills addressed to him at that house at 71/2 West End Court, she said.\n\nThe house does draw visitors and Ferrara and McDermott said they try to accommodate the fans who come from all over the world.\n\nSince they've owned it, they'd engaged in discussions with various groups about buying it an turning it into a public attraction or a non-profit operation that would retain 'the Bruce factor.'\n\nEXCLUSIVE:\n\nBut now that it's for sale, they don't have any control over its future.\n\n\"I hope it doesn't just become some house on West End Court,\" said McDermott, a 46-year-old preschool teacher from Little Falls. \"We would hope someone would keep 'the Bruce factor' in it,\" she said.\n\nMcDermott, Ferrara and DeCarolis are disappointed that they couldn't make more of a Springsteen attraction out of the house in the years they owned it. But in her dreams, McDermott has the ideal scenario for the next owner.\n\n\"In a dream world, Bruce would show up and say 'I think I should own this still,'\" McDermott said. \"But I don't think that's going to happen.\""
