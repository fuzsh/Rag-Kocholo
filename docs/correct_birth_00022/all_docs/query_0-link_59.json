        "text": "Want to eat like a Boss at the Jersey Shore? The WindMill in Long Branch's West End has your hot dogs — and more. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band have been stopping by the iconic hot dog stand for 50 years.\n\nIt's about a block down the road from the bungalow where Springsteen wrote much of “Born to Run” — and around the corner, at Brighton Avenue and Second Avenue, from the former location of the Inkwell, where the band used to hang in the late '60 and early '70s.\n\nBorn to Run:Here’s what the classic Bruce Springsteen album means to fans, song by song\n\nSpringsteen's WindMill stops were more frequent when he would walk in for a late-night snack after a surprise performance at the Stone Pony. One night, the crew kept the place open for the Boss. He was sitting at the counter when there was a banging on the window.\n\nSpringsteen and the guys turned around to see a woman flash the Boss.\n\n“It's 3:30 a.m. in Long Branch,” Springsteen said. “I'm going home.”\n\nSpringsteen plays no favorites when it comes to Jersey Shore hot dogs. He's also a fan of Max's Famous Hot Dogs, located down the street at 25 Matilda Terrace, just off Ocean Avenue.\n\nGo: WindMill Restaurant, 586 Ocean Blvd., Long Branch's West End; 732-681-9628, windmillhotdogs.com."
