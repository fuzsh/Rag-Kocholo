(AP) â€” While it takes Bruce Springsteen close to four hours to effectively revisit the four-plus decades of his career in concert, the Boss needed just 90 minutes to chronicle his life story at New Jersey's Monmouth University.\n\nThe 67-year-old Garden State-born rocker spoke at the school in West Long Branch Tuesday night as part of an \"intimate conversation\" moderated by Grammy Museum Executive Director Bob Santelli.\n\nAmong the topics Springsteen touched on were his youth as a bar band singer on the Jersey shore, writing his classic album \"Born To Run\" and the importance of political activism in music moving forward.\n\nMonmouth officials also announced that the university will be home to Springsteen's archives. A forthcoming exhibit will feature Springsteen's personal collection of written works, photographs and other memorabilia from his career.\n\nThe Hispanic Outlook on Education (HO) is a national monthly magazine that provides education news, innovations, networking, resources and the latest trends impacting students from kindergarten through graduate school all while maintaining a unique Hispanic perspective. Originally entitled The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education, HO has provided a pipeline delivering nationwide news about multicultural accomplishments and challenges in classrooms for over 30 years.\n\nDuring the year, HO has special theme issues that place particular emphasis on specialized topics including Financing a College Education, Community Colleges, Graduate Schools, Medical Professions, Arts and Media, Law Schools, Hispanic Hiring Institutions, and the Top 100 Schools for Hispanics.\n\nTerms and Conditions"
