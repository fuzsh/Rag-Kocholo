Institutional History

Abstract

A professional society formed in 1953 to promote communication among people interested in high vacuum technology through symposia and publications. Originally formed as the Committee on Vacuum Techniques and mandated to initiate a symposium and develop programs for education and recommend standards. Name changed at 1957 symposium to American Vacuum Society, the society became an affiliate member of the American Institute of Physics in 1963, and a full member in 1976.
