Prefacing the DOI with doi.org/ will turn it into an actionable link, for example, https://doi.org/10.1109/5.771073. Clicking that link will ‘resolve’ it, i.e. redirect to the latest information about the object it identifies, even if the object changes or moves.\n\nSend questions or comments to doi-help@doi.org.\n\nFurther documentation is available here.\n\nCopyright © 2023 DOI Foundation.
