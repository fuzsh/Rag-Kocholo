However, their use in interventional radiology has not been widely reported. The authors describe a case of duodenal perforation occurring after 15Â years of gastric bypass surgery, in whom surgical diversion was unsuccessfully attempted and the leakage was successfully controlled using percutaneous administration of a combination of biological and organic sealants.\n\nWhite Paper: Curriculum in Interventional Radiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nMahnken, Andreas H; BÃ¼cker, Arno; Hohl, Christian; Berlis, Ansgar\n\n2017-04-01\n\nPurpose âScope and clinical importance of interventional radiology markedly evolved over the last decades. Consequently it was acknowledged as independent subspecialty by the \"European Union of Medical Specialists\" (UEMS). Based on radiological imaging techniques Interventional Radiology is an integral part of Radiology. Materials und Methods âIn 2009 the German Society for Interventional Radiology and minimally-invasive therapy (DeGIR) developed a structured training in Interventional Radiology. In cooperation with the German Society of Neuroradiology (DGNR) this training was extended to also cover Interventional Neuroradiology in 2012. Tailored for this training in Interventional Radiology a structured curriculum was developed, covering the scope of this modular training. Results âThe curriculum is based on the DeGIR/DGNR modular training concept in Interventional Radiology. There is also an European Curriculum and Syllabus for Interventional Radiology developed by the \"Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe\" (CIRSE). The presented curriculum in Interventional Radiology is designed to provide a uniform base for the training in Interventional Radiology in Germany, based on the competencies obtained during residency. Conclusion âThis curriculum can be used as a basis for training in Interventional Radiology by all training sites. Key Points: Â· Interventional Radiology is an integral part of clinical radiology.

This review is targeted for clinicians who may refer their patients to paediatric interventional radiology services, or who are responsible for patients who are undergoing paediatric interventional radiology procedures. The article includes a brief overview of the indications for intervention, techniques involved and the commonest complications. Although some of the procedures described are most commonly performed in a tertiary paediatric centre, many are performed in most Children's hospitals.\n\nPaediatric musculoskeletal interventional radiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nNatali, Gian L; Paolantonio, Guglielmo; Fruhwirth, Rodolfo; Alvaro, Giuseppe; Parapatt, George K; Toma', Paolo; Rollo, Massimo\n\n2016-01-01\n\nInterventional radiology technique is now well established and widely used in the adult population. Through minimally invasive procedures, it increasingly replaces surgical interventions that involve higher percentages of invasiveness and, consequently, of morbidity and mortality. For these advantageous reasons, interventional radiology in recent years has spread to the paediatric age as well. The aim of this study was to review the literature on the development, use and perspectives of these procedures in the paediatric musculoskeletal field. Several topics are covered: osteomuscle neoplastic malignant and benign pathologies treated with invasive diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures such as radiofrequency ablation in the osteoid osteoma; invasive and non-invasive procedures in vascular malformations; treatment of aneurysmal bone cysts; and role of interventional radiology in paediatric inflammatory and rheumatic inflammations. The positive results that have been generated with interventional radiology procedures in the paediatric field highly encourage both the development of new ad hoc materials, obviously adapted to young patients, as well as the improvement of such techniques, in consideration of the fact that childrens' pathologies do not always correspond to those of adults. In conclusion, as these interventional procedures have proven to be less invasive, with lower morbidity and mortality rates as well, they are becoming a viable and valid alternative to surgery in the paediatric population.\n\nPediatric Interventional Radiology: Vascular Interventions.\n\nPubMed\n\nKandasamy, Devasenathipathy; Gamanagatti, Shivanand; Gupta, Arun Kumar\n\n2016-07-01\n\nPediatric interventional radiology (PIR) comprises a range of minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that are performed using image guidance. PIR has emerged as an essential adjunct to various surgical and medical conditions. Over the years, technology has undergone dramatic and continuous evolution, making this speciality grow. In this review, the authors will discuss various vascular interventional procedures undertaken in pediatric patients. It is challenging for the interventional radiologist to accomplish a successful interventional procedure. There are many vascular interventional radiology procedures which are being performed and have changed the way the diseases are managed. Some of the procedures are life saving and have become the treatment of choice in those patients. The future is indeed bright for the practice and practitioners of pediatric vascular and non-vascular interventions. As more and more of the procedures that are currently being performed in adults get gradually adapted for use in the pediatric population, it may be possible to perform safe and successful interventions in many of the pediatric vascular lesions that are otherwise being referred for surgery.\n\n[Brief history of interventional radiology].\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Zhenliang; Jia, Aiqin; Li, Luoyun; Li, Chunyu\n\n2014-05-01\n\nIn 1923, angiography was first successively used for the human body. In 1953, a Swedish doctor Sven-Ivar Seldinger pioneered the Seldinger technique, which laid down the foundation of interventional radiology. In 1963, Charles Dotter first proposed the idea of interventional radiology. In 1964, Charles Dotter opened a new era of percutaneous angioplasty through accidental operation, marking the formation of interventional radiology. On this basis, the techniques of balloon catheter dilation and metal stent implantation was developed. Endovascular stent was proposed in 1969. In 1973, the percutaneous angioplasty has been a breakthrough with the emergence of soft double-lumen balloon catheter. Percutaneous coronary angioplasty is applied in 1977. Since the 1990s, balloon angioplasty relegated to secondary status with the emergence of metal stent. Currently, endovascular stent have entered a new stage with the emergence of temporary stent and stent grafts and biological stent. Transcatheter arterial embolization had been one of the most important basic techniques for interventional radiology since 1965, it had also been a corresponding development with the improvement of embolic agents and catheter technology for the treatment of diseases now. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt is a comprehensive interventional radiology technology since 1967, in which the biliary system can be reached through a jugular vein, and the improvement appeared with balloon expandable stent in 1986.Since 1972, non-vascular interventional techniques was another important branch of interventional radiology. Currently, it is applied in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases of the internal organs like the pancreas, liver, kidney, spinal cord, Fallopian tubes, esophagus and other organs. In 1973, Chinese radiologist first conducted the angiography test. Interventional radiology was introduced into China in the 1980s, it was readily developed through the sponsoring of\n\nOccupational dose in interventional radiology procedures.\n\nPubMed\n\nChida, Koichi; Kaga, Yuji; Haga, Yoshihiro; Kataoka, Nozomi; Kumasaka, Eriko; Meguro, Taiichiro; Zuguchi, Masayuki\n\n2013-01-01\n\nInterventional radiology tends to involve long procedures (i.e., long fluoroscopic times). Therefore, radiation protection for interventional radiology staff is an important issue. This study describes the occupational radiation dose for interventional radiology staff, especially nurses, to clarify the present annual dose level for interventional radiology nurses. We compared the annual occupational dose (effective dose and dose equivalent) among interventional radiology staff in a hospital where 6606 catheterization procedures are performed annually. The annual occupational doses of 18 physicians, seven nurses, and eight radiologic technologists were recorded using two monitoring badges, one worn over and one under their lead aprons. The annual mean Â± SD effective dose (range) to the physicians, nurses, and radiologic technologists using two badges was 3.00 Â± 1.50 (0.84-6.17), 1.34 Â± 0.55 (0.70-2.20), and 0.60 Â± 0.48 (0.02-1.43) mSv/y, respectively. Similarly, the annual mean Â± SD dose equivalent range was 19.84 Â± 12.45 (7.0-48.5), 4.73 Â± 0.72 (3.9-6.2), and 1.30 Â± 1.00 (0.2-2.7) mSv/y, respectively. The mean Â± SD effective dose for the physicians was 1.02 Â± 0.74 and 3.00 Â± 1.50 mSv/y for the one- and two-badge methods, respectively (p < 0.001). Similarly, the mean Â± SD effective dose for the nurses (p = 0.186) and radiologic technologists (p = 0.726) tended to be lower using the one-badge method. The annual occupational dose for interventional radiology staff was in the order physicians > nurses > radiologic technologists. The occupational dose determined using one badge under the apron was far lower than the dose obtained with two badges in both physicians and nonphysicians. To evaluate the occupational dose correctly, we recommend use of two monitoring badges to evaluate interventional radiology nurses as well as physicians.\n\nIntegrated Fellowship in Vascular Surgery and Intervention Radiology\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMessina, Louis M.; Schneider, Darren B.; Chuter, Timothy A. M.; Reilly, Linda M.; Kerlan, Robert K.; LaBerge, Jeane M.; Wilson, Mark W.; Ring, Ernest J.; Gordon, Roy L.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nObjective To evaluate an integrated fellowship in vascular surgery and interventional radiology initiated to train vascular surgeons in endovascular techniques and to train radiology fellows in clinical aspects of vascular diseases. Summary Background Data The rapid evolution of endovascular techniques for the treatment of vascular diseases requires that vascular surgeons develop proficiency in these techniques and that interventional radiologists develop proficiency in the clinical evaluation and management of patients who are best treated with endovascular techniques. In response to this need the authors initiated an integrated fellowship in vascular surgery and interventional radiology and now report their interim results. Methods Since 1999 vascular fellows and radiology fellows performed an identical year-long fellowship in interventional radiology. During the fellowship, vascular surgery and radiology fellows perform both vascular and nonvascular interventional procedures. Both vascular surgery and radiology-based fellows spend one quarter of the year on the vascular service performing endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs and acquiring clinical experience in the vascular surgery inpatient and outpatient services. Vascular surgery fellows then complete an additional year-long fellowship in vascular surgery. To evaluate the type and number of interventional radiology procedures, the authors analyzed records of cases performed by all interventional radiology and vascular surgery fellows from a prospectively maintained database. The attitudes of vascular surgery and interventional radiology faculty and fellows toward the integrated fellowship were surveyed using a formal questionnaire. Results During the fellowship each fellow performed an average of 1,201 procedures, including 808 vascular procedures (236 diagnostic angiograms, 70 arterial interventions, 59 diagnostic venograms, 475 venous interventions, and 43 hemodialysis graft interventions) and 393\n\nPediatric interventional radiology clinic - how are we doing?\n\nPubMed\n\nRubenstein, Jonathan; Zettel, Julie C; Lee, Eric; Cote, Michelle; Aziza, Albert; Connolly, Bairbre L\n\n2016-07-01\n\nDevelopment of a pediatric interventional radiology clinic is a necessary component of providing a pediatric interventional radiology service. Patient satisfaction is important when providing efficient, high-quality care. To analyze the care provided by a pediatric interventional radiology clinic from the perspective of efficiency and parent satisfaction, so as to identify areas for improvement. The prospective study was both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative component measured clinic efficiency (waiting times, duration of clinic visit, nurse/physician time allocation and assessments performed; nâ=â91). The qualitative component assessed parental satisfaction with their experience with the pediatric interventional radiology clinic, using a questionnaire (5-point Likert scale) and optional free text section for feedback (nâ=â80). Questions explored the family's perception of relevance of information provided, consent process and overall satisfaction with their pediatric interventional radiology clinic experience. Families waited a mean of 11 and 10Â min to meet the physician and nurse, respectively. Nurses and physicians spent a mean of 28 and 21Â min with the families, respectively. The average duration of the pediatric interventional radiology clinic consultation was 56Â min. Of 80 survey participants, 83% were satisfied with their experience and 94% said they believed providing consent before the day of the procedure was helpful. Only 5% of respondents were not satisfied with the time-efficiency of the interventional radiology clinic. Results show the majority of patients/parents are very satisfied with the pediatric interventional radiology clinic visit. The efficiency of the pediatric interventional radiology clinic is satisfactory; however, adherence to stricter scheduling can be improved.\n\nRadiological interventions in malignant biliary obstruction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMadhusudhan, Kumble Seetharama; Gamanagatti, Shivanand; Srivastava, Deep Narayan; Gupta, Arun Kumar\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMalignant biliary obstruction is commonly caused by gall bladder carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and metastatic nodes. Percutaneous interventions play an important role in managing these patients. Biliary drainage, which forms the major bulk of radiological interventions, can be palliative in inoperable patients or pre-operative to improve liver function prior to surgery. Other interventions include cholecystostomy and radiofrequency ablation. We present here the indications, contraindications, technique and complications of the radiological interventions performed in patients with malignant biliary obstruction.

The type and complexity of interventional radiology cases being performed increases from year to year. Anaesthesiologists' presence in interventional radiology is increasing in turn, due to increasingly ill patients and intricate procedures requiring more than local anaesthesia for well tolerated completion. The literature available describing this is largely written by radiologists, with little attention paid to anaesthetic considerations. Cases in interventional radiology are complex in terms of the logistics of working in an unfamiliar area, frequency of patient comorbidity and unfamiliar procedures. Ensuring familiarity with the variety of interventional radiology procedures and their periprocedure requirements can increase anaesthesiologists' comfort in interventional radiology.\n\nWhat Does Competence Entail in Interventional Radiology?\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAhmed, Kamran, E-mail: k.ahmed@imperial.ac.u; Keeling, Aoife N.; Khan, Reenam S.\n\n2010-02-15\n\nInterventional radiology is a relatively new speciality and may be referred to as 'image-guided surgery without a scalpel.' Training and accreditation bodies regard interventional radiology training as being 'different' from general radiology because of the additional need for dexterity and clinical acumen. Due to the multidimensional role of an interventional radiologist, a practitioner in this discipline must have a number of the competencies of anesthetists, surgeons, and radiologists. The attributes required of an interventional radiologist are akin to those required of a surgeon. This paper gives an overview of the skills required to be a competent interventional radiologist along withmoreÂ Â» a succinct introduction to methods of assessment of technical and non-technical skills.Â«Â less\n\n[Interventional radiology: current problems and new directions].\n\nPubMed\n\nSantos MartÃ­n, E; Crespo Vallejo, E\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn recent years, vascular and interventional radiology has become one of the fastest growing diagnostic and therapeutic specialties. This growth has been based on a fundamental concept: performing minimally invasive procedures under imaging guidance. This attractive combination has led to the interest of professionals from other clinical specialties outside radiology in performing this type of intervention. The future of vascular and interventional radiology, although uncertain, must be linked to clinical practice and multidisciplinary teamwork. Copyright Â© 2011 SERAM. Published by Elsevier Espana.

Radiology reporting standards and tools have evolved to enable automated data integration from multiple institutions using structured templates. In interventional radiology, data aggregated into clinical, research and quality registries from enriched structured reports could firmly establish the interventional radiology value proposition.\n\nPediatric interventional radiology workforce survey: 10-year follow-up.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaufman, Claire S; James, Charles A; Harned, Roger K; Connolly, Bairbre L; Roebuck, Derek J; Cahill, Anne M; Dubois, Josee; Morello, Frank P; Morgan, Robin K; Sidhu, Manrita K\n\n2017-05-01\n\nPediatric interventional radiology is a distinct subspecialty differing from both pediatric diagnostic radiology and adult interventional radiology. We conducted a workforce survey in 2005 to evaluate the state of pediatric interventional radiology at that time. Since then there have been many advancements to the subspecialty, including the founding of the Society for Pediatric Interventional Radiology (SPIR). To evaluate the current state of the pediatric interventional radiology workforce and compare findings with those of the initial 2005 workforce survey. We sent a two-part survey electronically to members of SPIR, the Society for Pediatric Radiology (SPR), the Society of Chairmen of Radiology in Children's Hospitals (SCORCH) and the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR). Part 1 focused on individual practitioners (n=177), while part 2 focused on group practices and was answered by a leader from each group (n=88). We examined descriptive statistics and, when possible, compared the results to the study from 2005. A total of 177 individuals replied (a 331% increase over the first study) and 88 pediatric interventional radiology (IR) service sites responded (a 131.6% increase). Pediatric IR has become a more clinically oriented specialty, with a statistically significant increase in services with admitting privileges, clinics and performance of daily rounds. Pediatric IR remains diverse in training and practice. Many challenges still exist, including anesthesia/hospital support, and the unknown impact of the new IR residency on pediatric IR training, although the workforce shortage has been somewhat alleviated, as demonstrated by the decreased mean call from 165Â days/year to 67.2Â days/year. Pediatric interventional radiology practitioners and services have grown significantly since 2005, although the profile of this small subspecialty has changed and some challenges remain.\n\nInterventional Radiology: Equipment and Techniques.\n\nPubMed\n\nScansen, Brian A\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe breadth of small animal diseases that can now be treated by a minimally invasive, transcatheter approach continues to expand. Interventional radiology is the field of medicine that affects a therapeutic outcome via minimally invasive catheterization of peripheral blood vessels or body orifices guided by imaging. The intent of this article is to provide an overview of the equipment required for interventional radiology in veterinary medicine with a discussion of technical uses in diseases of dogs and cats.

Physicians of many specialties will encounter patients undergoing such procedures and knowledge of possible complications is therefore desirable. We aim to briefly outline the role of the most commonly undertaken radiological thoracic interventions and review the associated complications, their subsequent management and the steps that can be taken to minimize the risk of these complications occurring.\n\nGlove Perforations During Interventional Radiological Procedures\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLeena, R. V., E-mail: leenarv_76@yahoo.co.uk; Shyamkumar, N. K.\n\n2010-04-15\n\nIntact surgical gloves are essential to avoid contact with blood and other body fluids. The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of glove perforations during interventional radiological procedures. In this study, a total of 758 gloves used in 94 interventional radiological procedures were examined for perforations. Eleven perforations were encountered, only one of which was of occult type. No significant difference in the frequency of glove perforation was found between the categories with varying time duration.\n\nEffect of iodinated low-osmolar contrast media on the hemostatic system after intraarterial and intravenous contrast administration.\n\nPubMed\n\nLukasiewicz, A; Lebkowska, U; Galar, M\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSome of the adverse clinical effects of intravascular radiological contrast agents include the interference of these contrast media with normal hemostatic processes. The aim of this report was to investigate in vivo whether a non-ionic iodinated contrast agent possess prothrombotic or anticoagulant properties. Hemostatic parameters: vWF (von Willebrand factor), F1+2 (prothrombin fragments 1+2), TAT (thrombin-antithrombin complexes), D-Dimer, Î²-TG (beta-thromboglobulin) were measured in a group of 35 patients. Blood samples for laboratory investigations were collected before and 30 min after the administration of a iodine contrast agent. There was observed statistically highly significant contrast-induced increase in TAT and F1+2 (p = 0.005 and p = 0.008, respectively). D-Dimer increase and decrease of Î²-TG and vWF after contrast medium administration were non significant. The volume of contrast medium has no influence on the assessed hemostatic parameters, while the type of contrast medium and/or the route of the contrast administration may significantly affect hemostatic parameters. We found significant effects of non-ionic agents on hemostatic activation. These effects may be important for adverse reactions and for thromboembolic complications.\n\nA case series of interventional radiology in postpartum haemorrhage.\n\nPubMed\n\nAgarwal, N; Deinde, O; Willmott, F; Bojahr, H; MacCallum, P; Renfrew, I; Beski, S\n\n2011-08-01\n\nPostpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. In some instances, PPH can be anticipated and recent improvements in obstetric imaging techniques allow earlier and more reliable diagnosis of abnormalities associated with haemorrhage such as morbid placentation. However, the majority of PPH is unpredicted. Good practice notes published by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state interventional radiology should be used as emergency intervention in PPH and should be considered when primary management has failed allowing arteries to be embolised to achieve haemostasis. Through collaboration between interventional radiology and maternity, appropriate guidelines need to be developed, on both emergency and elective of interventional radiology in the prevention and management of PPH. As there is mapping for neonatal services, in the future there should be consideration to develop obstetric trauma units. Maternity units which lack facilities for interventional radiology would be able to refer their cases (like placenta accreta) for safe management in units with 24 h interventional radiology services.\n\nSummary of the proceedings of the International Forum 2017: \"Position of interventional radiology within radiology\".\n\nPubMed\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe International Forum is held once a year by the ESR and its international radiological partner societies with the aim to address and discuss selected topics of global relevance in radiology. In 2017, the issue of the position of interventional radiology (IR) within radiology was analysed. IR is expanding because of the increased patient demand for minimally invasive therapies performed under imaging guidance, and its success in improving patient outcomes, reducing in-hospital stays, reducing morbidity and mortality of treatment in many organs and organ-systems. Despite the many successes of IR, public awareness about it is quite low. IR requires specific training and, in most countries, the majority of interventional radiologists do not dedicate their time completely to IR but perform diagnostic radiology investigations as well. Turf battles in IR are common in many countries. To preserve and keep IR within radiology, it is necessary to focus more on direct and longitudinal patient care. Having beds dedicated to IR within radiology departments is very important to increase clinical involvement of interventional radiologists. IR procedures fit perfectly within \"value-based healthcare\", but the metrics have to be developed. â¢ IR should stay a prominent subspecialty within radiology. â¢ Dedicated IR training pathways are mandatory. â¢ Measures to increase recruitment of young doctors to IR and to increase public awareness of IR are needed. â¢ Beds dedicated to IR within radiology departments are important in order to increase clinical involvement of interventional radiologists.\n\nA Checklist to Improve Patient Safety in Interventional Radiology\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKoetser, Inge C.

The checklist was adapted on the basis of observation of daily practice in a tertiary referral centre and evaluation by users. To assess the effect of RADPASS, in a series of radiological interventions, all deviations from optimal care were registered before and after implementation of the checklist. In addition, the checklist and its use were evaluated by interviewingmoreÂ Â» all users. The RADPASS checklist has two parts: A (Planning and Preparation) and B (Procedure). The latter part comprises checks just before starting a procedure (B1) and checks concerning the postprocedural care immediately after completion of the procedure (B2). Two cohorts of, respectively, 94 and 101 radiological interventions were observed; the mean percentage of deviations of the optimal process per intervention decreased from 24 % before implementation to 5 % after implementation (p < 0.001). Postponements and cancellations of interventions decreased from 10 % before implementation to 0 % after implementation. Most users agreed that the checklist was user-friendly and increased patient safety awareness and efficiency. The first validated patient safety checklist for interventional radiology was developed. The use of the RADPASS checklist reduced deviations from the optimal process by three quarters and was associated with less procedure postponements.Â«Â less\n\nMy road on interventional radiology\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Yan-Hao\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe author tells a story of how he has become an expert of interventional radiotherapy from a graduate of middle school. In his childhood, he wanted to become an astronomer. However, he was forced to go to the countryside as a school graduate. In 1974, he was enrolled as a âworker-peasant-soldierâ student in Henan Medical College. After graduated from the college, he was assigned to the Radiology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan Medical College where he worked hard as an assistant doctor. Then, he was transferred to Nanfang Hospital (Guangzhou, China) where he achieved great successes and thus has become an expert of interventional radiology.

The developments in interventional radiology with fluoroscopy and dose-intensive interventions require intensified radiation protection. It is recommended that all available tools should be used for this purpose. Besides the options for instruments, xâray protection at the intervention table must be intensively practiced with lead aprons and mounted lead glass. A special focus on eye protection to prevent cataracts is also recommended. The development of cataracts might no longer be deterministic, as confirmed by new data; therefore, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has lowered the threshold dose value for eyes from 150Â mSv/year to 20Â mSv/year. Measurements show that the new values can be achieved by applying all Xâray protection measures plus lead-containing eyeglasses.\n\nPhysical and cognitive task analysis in interventional radiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnson, S; Healey, A; Evans, J; Murphy, M; Crawshaw, M; Gould, D\n\n2006-01-01\n\nTo identify, describe and detail the cognitive thought processes, decision-making, and physical actions involved in the preparation and successful performance of core interventional radiology procedures. Five commonly performed core interventional radiology procedures were selected for cognitive task analysis. Several examples of each procedure being performed by consultant interventional radiologists were videoed. The videos of those procedures, and the steps required for successful outcome, were analysed by a psychologist and an interventional radiologist. Once a skeleton algorithm of the procedures was defined, further refinement was achieved using individual interview techniques with consultant interventional radiologists. Additionally a critique of each iteration of the established algorithm was sought from non-participating independent consultant interventional radiologists. Detailed task descriptions and decision protocols were developed for five interventional radiology procedures (arterial puncture, nephrostomy, venous access, biopsy-using both ultrasound and computed tomography, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram). Identical tasks performed within these procedures were identified and standardized within the protocols. Complex procedures were broken down and their constituent processes identified. This might be suitable for use as a training protocol to provide a universally acceptable safe practice at the most fundamental level. It is envisaged that data collected in this way can be used as an educational resource for trainees and could provide the basis for a training curriculum in interventional radiology. It will direct trainees towards safe practice of the highest standard. It will also provide performance objectives of a simulator model.\n\nHemostatic strategies for traumatic and surgical bleeding\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBehrens, Adam M.; Sikorski, Michael J.; Kofinas, Peter\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWide interest in new hemostatic approaches has stemmed from unmet needs in the hospital and on the battlefield. Many current commercial hemostatic agents fail to fulfill the design requirements of safety, efficacy, cost, and storage. Academic focus has led to the improvement of existing strategies as well as new developments. This review will identify and discuss the three major classes of hemostatic approaches: biologically derived materials, synthetically derived materials, and intravenously administered hemostatic agents. The general class is first discussed, then specific approaches discussed in detail, including the hemostatic mechanisms and the advancement of the method. As hemostatic strategies evolve and synthetic-biologic interactions are more fully understood, current clinical methodologies will be replaced.

Patients in whom interventional radiology was performed were compared with those in whom interventional radiology was not performed as regards type of pancreatic resection, diagnosis, postoperative mortality and morbidity, postoperative pancreatic fistula postpancreatectomy haemorrhage, bile leakage, reoperation rate and length of hospital stay. Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of interventional radiology in the treatment of complications after pancreatic resection. One hundred and eighty-two (62.8%) out of 290 patients experienced postoperative complications. Interventional radiology procedures were performed in 37 cases (20.3%): percutaneous drainage in 28, transhepatic biliary drainage in 8 and arterial embolisation in 3 cases. Technical success was obtained in all cases and clinical success in 75.7%. Reoperation was avoided in 86.5%. In patients with major complications, clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula and bile leaks as well as those with late postpancreatectomy haemorrhage (P=0.030) and patients with postpancreatectomy haemorrhage grade C (P=0.029), interventional radiology was used (P<0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.009, respectively) significantly more frequently than in the remaining patients. The reoperation and mortality rates were similar in the two groups (P=0.885 and P=0.100, respectively) while patients treated with interventional radiology procedures had a significant longer length of hospital stay than those in the non-interventional radiology group (37.5 Â± 23.4 vs. 18.7 Â± 11.7 days; P<0.001). Interventional radiology procedures were useful, especially for patients with postoperative pancreatic fistulas and bile leaks in whom reoperation was very often avoided.\n\n[Interventional radiology treatment of extensive pulmonary embolism and thromboembolic diseases].\n\nPubMed\n\nBattyÃ¡ni, IstvÃ¡n; DÃ³sa, Edit; Harmat, ZoltÃ¡n\n\n2015-04-26\n\nThe authors discuss interventional radiological methods in the field of vascular interventions applied in venous system diseases. Venous diseases can be life threatening without appropriate treatment and can lead to chronic venous diseases and venous insufficiency with long-term reduction in the quality of life. In addition, recurrent clinical symptoms require additional treatments. Interventional radiology has several methods that can provide fast and complete recovery if applied in time. The authors summarize these methods hoping that they will be available for a wide range of patients through the establishment of Interventional Radiological Centres and will be a part of the daily routine of patient care. Regarding the frequency of venous diseases and its influance on life quality the authors would like to draw attention to interventional radiological techniques and modern therapeutic possibilities.\n\nInterventional radiology in the elderly\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKatsanos, Konstantinos; Ahmad, Farhan; Dourado, Renato; Sabharwal, Tarun; Adam, Andreas\n\n2009-01-01\n\nInterventional radiological percutaneous procedures are becoming all the more important in the curative or palliative management of elderly frail patients with multiple underlying comorbidities. They may serve either as alternative primary minimally invasive therapies or adjuncts to traditional surgical treatments. The present report provides a concise review of the most important interventional radiological procedures with a special focus on the treatment of the primary debilitating pathologies of the elderly population. The authors elaborate on the scientific evidence and latest developments of thermoablation of solid organ malignancies, palliative stent placement for gastrointestinal tract cancer, airway stenting for tracheobronchial strictures, endovascular management of aortic and peripheral arterial vascular disease, and cement stabilization of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The added benefits of high technical and clinical success coupled with lower procedural mortality and morbidity are highlighted.

Abstracts accepted to the annual meetings of the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR), the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE), the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and the European Congress of Radiology (ECR) between 2005 and 2015 were analyzed using the search terms \"interventional/computed tomography\" and \"radiation dose/radiation dose reduction.\" A PubMed query using the above-mentioned search terms for the years of 2005-2015 was performed. Between 2005 and 2015, a total of 14 520 abstracts (mean, 660Â±297 abstracts) and 80 614 abstracts (mean, 3664Â±1025 abstracts) were presented at interventional and diagnostic radiology meetings, respectively. Significantly fewer abstracts related to radiation dose were presented at the interventional radiology meetings compared with the diagnostic radiology meetings (162 abstracts [1% of total] vs. 2706 [3% of total]; P < 0.001). On average 15Â±7 interventional radiology abstracts (range, 6-27) and 246Â±105 diagnostic radiology abstracts (range, 112-389) pertaining to radiation dose were presented at each meeting. The PubMed query revealed an average of 124Â±39 publications (range, 79-187) and 1205Â±307 publications (range, 829-1672) related to interventional and diagnostic radiology dose reduction per year, respectively (P < 0.001). The observed increase in the number of abstracts regarding radiation dose reduction in the interventional radiology community over the past 10 years has not mirrored the increased volume seen within diagnostic radiology, suggesting that increased education and discussion about this topic may be warranted.\n\nEvolution of hemostatic agents in surgical practice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSundaram, Chandru P.; Keenan, Alison C.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nObjective: Topical hemostatic agents are used in a wide variety of surgical settings, and the evolution of this class of surgical tools is an interesting topic. We reviewed and outlined the historical progress of topical hemostats into present day surgery and urology, and highlight opportunities for future research. Materials and Methods: A MEDLINE search of all available literature concerning several classes of topical hemostatic agents was performed. Fibrins sealants, Gelatin sponge hemostatics, cyanoacrylate adhesives, oxidized regenerated cellulose, and microfibrillar collagen were included. References were chosen from a broad range of surgical literature. Results: Topical hemostatic agents have historically taken advantage of a wide variety of mechanisms for hemostasis. Fibrin sealants have a rich history and large potential for further applications. Gelatin sponge hemostatics have been widely used since their introduction, but have changed little. Cyanoacrylate adhesives have a unique mechanism and opportunity for novel applications of existing products. Oxidized cellulose was original in the use of plant-based components. Microfibrillar collagen hemostats have evolved to a wide variety of formats. Conclusions: A review of the evolution of topical hemostatic agents highlights opportunities for potential novel research. Fibrin sealants may have the most opportunity for advancement, and understanding the history of these products is useful. With the drive in urology for minimally invasive surgical techniques, adaptation of topical hemostatic agents to this surgical approach would be valuable and offers an opportunity for novel contributions.

To describe the current state and limitations to interventional radiology (IR) in Canada through a large, national survey of Canadian interventional radiologists. Methods. An anonymous online survey was offered to members of the Canadian Interventional Radiology Association (CIRA). Only staff radiologists were invited to participate. Results. Seventy-five (75) responses were received from a total of 247, giving a response rate of 30%. Respondents were split approximately equally between academic centers (47%) and community practice (53%), and the majority of interventional radiologists worked in hospitals with either 200-500 (49%) or 500-1,000 (39%) beds. Procedures listed by respondents as most commonlymoreÂ Â» performed in their practice included PICC line insertion (83%), angiography and stenting (65%), and percutaneous biopsy (37%). Procedures listed as not currently performed but which interventional radiologists believed would benefit their patient population included radiofrequency ablation (36%), carotid stenting (34%), and aortic stenting (21%); the majority of respondents noted that a lack of support from referring services was the main reason for not performing these procedures (56%). Impediments to increasing scope and volume of practice in Canadian IR were most commonly related to room or equipment shortage (35%), radiologist shortage (33%), and a lack of funding or administrative support (28%). Conclusion. Interventional radiology in Canada is limited by a number of factors including funding, manpower, and referral support. A concerted effort should be undertaken by individual interventional radiologists and IR organizations to increase training capacity, funding, remuneration, and public exposure to IR in order to help advance the subspecialty.Â«Â less\n\nRadiation dose reduction: comparative assessment of publication volume between interventional and diagnostic radiology\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHansmann, Jan; Henzler, Thomas; Gaba, Ron C.; Morelli, John N.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPURPOSE We aimed to quantify and compare awareness regarding radiation dose reduction within the interventional radiology and diagnostic radiology communities.

Simple research enhancing strategies including regular journal club, research hour, basic research skills training, hiring of research faculty, research awards, and annual research retreat and research board to increase research production were implemented in the Department of Radiology of a teaching hospital in Pakistan. A total of 77 papers were produced by the Department of Radiology before the intervention, which increased to 92 after the introduction of research initiatives. There was a significant increase in the overall proportion of publications in the international journals after the intervention (p < 0.001) with an increasing trend towards indexed journals (p < 0.001). The research enhancing interventions had a positive effect on increasing clinical research output by the Department of Radiology. Such interventions can also be replicated in other clinical departments to increase their research productivity.\n\nICRP publication 121: radiological protection in paediatric diagnostic and interventional radiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhong, P-L; Ringertz, H; Donoghue, V; Frush, D; Rehani, M; Appelgate, K; Sanchez, R\n\n2013-04-01\n\nPaediatric patients have a higher average risk of developing cancer compared with adults receiving the same dose. The longer life expectancy in children allows more time for any harmful effects of radiation to manifest, and developing organs and tissues are more sensitive to the effects of radiation. This publication aims to provide guiding principles of radiological protection for referring clinicians and clinical staff performing diagnostic imaging and interventional procedures for paediatric patients. It begins with a brief description of the basic concepts of radiological protection, followed by the general aspects of radiological protection, including principles of justification and optimisation. Guidelines and suggestions for radiological protection in specific modalities - radiography and fluoroscopy, interventional radiology, and computed tomography - are subsequently covered in depth. The report concludes with a summary and recommendations. The importance of rigorous justification of radiological procedures is emphasised for every procedure involving ionising radiation, and the use of imaging modalities that are non-ionising should always be considered. The basic aim of optimisation of radiological protection is to adjust imaging parameters and institute protective measures such that the required image is obtained with the lowest possible dose of radiation, and that net benefit is maximised to maintain sufficient quality for diagnostic interpretation. Special consideration should be given to the availability of dose reduction measures when purchasing new imaging equipment for paediatric use. One of the unique aspects of paediatric imaging is with regards to the wide range in patient size (and weight), therefore requiring special attention to optimisation and modification of equipment, technique, and imaging parameters. Examples of good radiographic and fluoroscopic technique include attention to patient positioning, field size and adequate collimation, use\n\nInterventional Radiology in the Management of Budd Chiari Syndrome\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBeckett, David; Olliff, Simon, E-mail: simon.olliff@uhb.nhs.u\n\nBudd Chiari syndrome is an uncommon condition in the Western world but interventional radiology can contribute significantly to the management of the majority of patients.

Using the database of Journal Citation Reports the 40 highest impact factor radiology journals were chosen. From these journals the 100 most cited interventional radiology papers were chosen and analysed. The top paper received 2497 citations and the 100(th) paper 200 citations. The average number of citations was 320. Dates of publication ranged from 1953 - 2005. Most papers originated in the United States (n = 67) followed by Italy (n = 20) and France (n = 10). Harvard University (n = 18) and Osped Civile (n = 11) were the most prolific institutions. Ten journals produced all of the top 100 papers with \"Radiology\" and \"AJR\" making up the majority. SN Goldberg and T Livraghi were the most prolific authors. Nearly two thirds of the papers (n = 61) were published after 1990. This analysis identifies many of the landmark interventional radiology papers and provides a fascinating insight into the changing discourse within the field. It also identifies topics, authors and institutions which have impacted greatly on the specialty.\n\nInterventional Radiologic Treatment for Idiopathic Portal Hypertension\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHirota, Shozo; Ichikawa, Satoshi; Matsumoto, Shinichi\n\n1999-07-15\n\nPurpose: To evaluate the usefulness of interventional radiological treatment for idiopathic portal hypertension. Methods: Between 1995 and 1998, we performed an interventional radiological treatment in five patients with idiopathic portal hypertension, four of whom had refused surgery and one of whom had undergone surgery. Three patients with gastroesophageal varices (GEV) were treated by partial splenic embolization (PSE), one patient with esophageal varices (EV) and massive ascites by transjugular intrahepatic portosytemic shunt (TIPS) and PSE, and one patient with GEV by percutaneous transhepatic obliteration (PTO). Midterm results were analyzed in terms of the effect on esophageal and/or gastric varices. Results: InmoreÂ Â» one woman with severe GEV who underwent three sessions of PSE, there was endoscopic confirmation that the GEV had disappeared. In one man his EV shrunk markedly after two sessions of PSE. In two patients slight reduction of the EV was obtained with one application of PSE combined with endoscopic variceal ligation therapy. PTO for GV in one patient resulted in good control of the varices. All patients have survived for 16-42 months since the first interventional treatment, and varices are well controlled. Conclusion: Interventional radiological treatment is effective for patients with idiopathic portal hypertension, whether or not they have undergone surgery.Â«Â less\n\nInterventional radiology in living donor liver transplant\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCheng, Yu-Fan; Ou, Hsin-You; Yu, Chun-Yen; Tsang, Leo Leung-Chit; Huang, Tung-Liang; Chen, Tai-Yi; Hsu, Hsien-Wen; Concerjero, Allan M; Wang, Chih-Chi; Wang, Shih-Ho; Lin, Tsan-Shiun; Liu, Yueh-Wei; Yong, Chee-Chien; Lin, Yu-Hung; Lin, Chih-Che; Chiu, King-Wah; Jawan, Bruno; Eng, Hock-Liew; Chen, Chao-Long\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe shortage of deceased donor liver grafts led to the use of living donor liver transplant (LDLT). Patients who undergo LDLT have a higher risk of complications than those who undergo deceased donor liver transplantation (LT). Interventional radiology has acquired a key role in every LT program by treating the majority of vascular and non-vascular post-transplant complications, improving graft and patient survival and avoiding, in the majority of cases, surgical revision and/or re-transplant. The aim of this paper is to review indications, diagnostic modalities, technical considerations, achievements and potential complications of interventional radiology procedures after LDLT.

Previous studies investigated MPH as a replacement to nonflowable hemostatic agents of different application techniques (e.g., oxidized cellulose, collagen); therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if MPH is a surrogate for flowable hemostatic agents of similar handling and application techniques, specifically a flowable thrombin-gelatin hemostatic matrix. Hemostatic efficacy was compared using a heparinized porcine abrasion model mimicking a capsular tear of a parenchymal organ. MPH (ARISTA, 1 g) and hemostatic matrix (Floseal, 1 mL) were applied, according to a randomized scheme, to paired hepatic abrasions (40 lesions per group). Hemostatic success, control of bleeding, and blood loss were assessed 2, 5, and 10 min after treatment. Hemostatic success and control of bleeding were analyzed using odds ratios and blood loss using mean differences. Hemostatic matrix provided superior hemostatic success relative to MPH at 5 (odds ratio: 0.035, 95% confidence interval: 0.004-0.278) and 10 min (0.032, 0.007-0.150), provided superior control of bleeding at 5 (0.006, <0.001-0.037) and 10 min (0.009, 0.001-0.051), and had significantly less blood loss at 5 (mean difference: 0.3118 mL/min, 95% confidence interval: 0.0939-0.5296) and 10 min (0.5025, 0.2489-0.7561). These findings corroborate other MPH investigations regarding its low-level efficacy and suggest that MPH is not an appropriate surrogate for hemostatic matrix despite similar application techniques. The lack of a procoagulant within MPH may likely be the reason for its lower efficacy and need for multiple applications. Copyright Â© 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Animal data have shown that hemostatic bandages reduce hemorrhage and improve survival. This article reports recent clinical observations regarding the efficacy and evolution of use of two new hemostatic bandages employed in the global war on terrorism. We performed a retrospective cohort review of soldiers treated with either the QuikClot or HemCon hemostatic bandages between April and October 2006. Hemostatic dressings were placed on wounds either in the field or at the combat support hospital (CSH). During the 6-month study period, 1691 trauma patients were admitted to the CSH. Fifty uses of hemostatic dressings in 44 patients (2.6% of admissions) were identified. Forty patients were treated with HemCon dressings, three patients with QuikClot, and one with both QuikClot and HemCon. Eighteen percent of the dressings were used in the field, predominantly on extremity wounds (7/8). In contrast, most dressings used in the CSH were for truncal wounds (26/36 patients). Hemostatic dressings were applied to extremity wounds in prehospital and hospital settings, either alone or in conjunction with tourniquets. In surviving patients (95%), the treating surgeon determined that the hemorrhage was either stopped or greatly decreased by use of hemostatic dressings. Two of the four patients treated with QuikClot had burns from exothermic reactions, while no adverse reactions were noted with HemCon. Hemostatic agents stop or decrease bleeding. Whereas HemCon appears to be safe, QuikClot may produce superficial burns. These new hemostatic agents have a place in the surgical armamentarium to assist in controlling internal hemorrhage from truncal and pelvic hemorrhage, especially during damage-control surgery.\n\nApproaching the Practice Quality Improvement Project in Interventional Radiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nReis, Stephen P; White, Benjamin; Sutphin, Patrick D; Pillai, Anil K; Kalva, Sanjeeva P; Toomay, Seth M\n\n2015-12-01\n\nAn important component of maintenance of certification and quality improvement in radiology is the practice quality improvement (PQI) project. In this article, the authors describe several methodologies for initiating and completing PQI projects. Furthermore, the authors illustrate several tools that are vital in compiling, analyzing, and presenting data in an easily understandable and reproducible manner. Last, they describe two PQI projects performed in an interventional radiology division that have successfully improved the quality of care for patients. Using the DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) quality improvement framework, interventional radiology throughput has been increased, to lessen mediport wait times from 43 to 8 days, and mediport infection rates have decreased from more than 2% to less than 0.4%.

PMID:25918585\n\n2000 RSNA annual oration in diagnostic radiology: The future of interventional radiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nBecker, G J\n\n2001-08-01\n\nOrigins in imaging, procedural emphasis, and dependence on innovation characterize interventional radiology, which will continue as the field of image-guided minimally invasive therapies. A steady supply of innovators will be needed. Current workforce shortages demand that this problem be addressed and in an ongoing fashion. Interventional radiology's major identity problem will require multiple corrective measures, including a name change. Diagnostic radiologists must fully embrace the concept of the dedicated interventionalist. Interspecialty turf battles will continue, especially with cardiologists and vascular surgeons. To advance the discipline, interventional radiologists must remain involved in cutting-edge therapies such as endograft repair of aortic aneurysms and carotid stent placement. As the population ages, interventionalists will experience a shift toward a greater emphasis on cancer treatment. Political agendas and public pressure will improve access to care and result in managed health care reforms. Academic centers will continue to witness a decline in time and resources available to pursue academic missions. The public outcry for accountability will result in systems changes aimed at reducing errors and process changes in the way physicians are trained, certified, and monitored. Evidence-based medicine will be the watchword of this century. Interventional radiology will maintain its role through development of methods for delivery of genes, gene products, and drugs to specific target sites; control of angiogenesis and other biologic processes; and noninvasive image-guided delivery of various forms of energy for ablation.\n\nICRP Publication 139: Occupational Radiological Protection in Interventional Procedures.\n\nPubMed\n\nLÃ³pez, P Ortiz; Dauer, L T; Loose, R; Martin, C J; Miller, D L; VaÃ±Ã³, E; Doruff, M; Padovani, R; Massera, G; Yoder, C\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn recent publications, such as Publications 117 and 120, the Commission provided practical advice for physicians and other healthcare personnel on measures to protect their patients and themselves during interventional procedures. These measures can only be effective if they are encompassed by a framework of radiological protection elements, and by the availability of professionals with responsibilities in radiological protection. This framework includes a radiological protection programme with a strategy for exposure monitoring, protective garments, education and training, and quality assurance of the programme implementation. Professionals with responsibilities in occupational radiological protection for interventional procedures include: medical physicists; radiological protection specialists; personnel working in dosimetry services; clinical applications support personnel from the suppliers and maintenance companies; staff engaged in training, standardisation of equipment, and procedures; staff responsible for occupational health; hospital administrators responsible for providing financial support; and professional bodies and regulators. This publication addresses these elements and these audiences, and provides advice on specific issues, such as assessment of effective dose from dosimeter readings when an apron is worn, estimation of exposure of the lens of the eye (with and without protective eyewear), extremity monitoring, selection and testing of protective garments, and auditing the interventional procedures when occupational doses are unusually high or low (the latter meaning that the dosimeter may not have been worn).\n\nFamiliarity with current practices of granting and maintaining privileges in pediatric interventional radiology--a worldwide survey of the members of the Society for Pediatric Interventional Radiology (SPIR).\n\nPubMed\n\nHarned, Roger K\n\n2012-11-01\n\nPhysician credentialing is a complex process driven by the demand for quality improvement in health care. In the U.S., the Joint Commission Standard of 2007 has tied hospital accreditation to credentialing through mandated use of the Focused Professional Practice Evaluation (FPPE) and Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (OPPE). To assess pediatric interventional radiologists' knowledge of how institutions grant them privileges. Members of the Society for Pediatric Interventional Radiology (SPIR) were sent a web-based survey regarding credentialing. Of 122 members from 19 countries, 81 (66%) responded, and of these 81, 59 (73%) were familiar with their hospital's privileging process. Of 49 U.S. respondents and 32 non-U.S. respondents, 37 (76%) and 17 (53%), respectively, stated that interventional radiology credentialing was different from diagnostic radiology credentialing. Of the 49 U.S. respondents, 24 (49%) reported an OPPE, and of the 32 non-U.S. respondents, 8 (25%) reported an ongoing evaluation. The U.S. OPPE is performed at shorter intervals than its international equivalent. Four years after the Joint Commission defined the FPPE and OPPE, separate credentialing of pediatric interventional radiology from pediatric diagnostic radiology is more likely in the U.S. than internationally, and U.S. pediatric interventional radiologists are more likely to have a defined ongoing professional evaluation and to be evaluated every 6Â months or more frequently. There are many SPIR members who do not know how they obtain privileges and/or are not knowingly subject to an OPPE. This lack of knowledge may affect future education of interventional radiologists as well as the definition of pediatric interventional radiology practices within individual institutions.\n\nThe New Interventional Radiology Pathways: Options for Implementation.\n\nPubMed\n\nRecht, Michael; McKinney, J Mark; Alleman, Anthony M; Lowe, Lisa H; Spies, James B\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe new interventional radiology (IR) pathways have generated much discussion with articles and editorials pointing out perceived advantages and disadvantages compared to the current pathways. To briefly review, under the new system, there are three pathways to enter IR: the integrated (INT) IR residency, the independent (IND) IR residency, and the early specialization in interventional radiology (ESIR) program. The pathways have been designed to provide maximum flexibility to programs for implementation and to radiology residents for planning their subspecialty training. As a result, there are many potential permutations for these training programs, and understanding the variety of options can be a challenge at first. We offer three potential solutions, based on the different circumstances or requirements a department might face. The first two solutions involve integrated programs created through newly funded and converted diagnostic radiology slots, respectively. The third involves establishing ESIR and IND programs only. Hopefully, the examples provided will be useful for those currently planning for the future of their IR training programs. Copyright Â© 2016 The Association of University Radiologists.

P.; Azevedo, F. S.; Barroso, R. C.; Lopes, R. T.\n\n2007-09-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate dose values in patients and staff involved in some interventional radiology procedures. Doses have been measured using thermoluminescent dosemeters for single procedures (such as renal and cerebral arteriography, transjungular intrahepatic portasystemic shunt (TIPS) and chemoembolization). The magnitude of doses through the hands of interventional radiologists has been studied. Dose levels were evaluated in three points for patients (eye, thyroid and gonads). The dose-area product (DAP) was also investigated using a Diamentor (PTW-M2). The dose in extremities was estimated for a professional who generally performed one TIPS, two chemoembolizations, two cerebral arteriographies and two renal arteriographies in a week. The estimated annual radiation dose was converted to effective dose as suggested by the 453-MS/Brazil norm The annual dose values were 137.25 mSv for doctors, 40.27 mSv for nurses and 51.95 mSv for auxiliary doctors, and all these annual dose values are below the limit established. The maximum values of the dose obtained for patients were 6.91, 10.92 and 15.34 mGy close to eye, thyroid and gonads, respectively. The DAP values were evaluated for patients in the same interventional radiology procedures. The dose and DAP values obtained are in agreement with values encountered in the literature.\n\nAnesthesia Practices for Interventional Radiology in Europe\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nVari, Alessandra, E-mail: alessandra.vari@uniroma1.it; Gangi, Afshin, E-mail: gangi@unistra.fr\n\nPurposeThe Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) prompted an initiative to frame the current European status of anesthetic practices for interventional radiology, in consideration of the current variability of IR suite settings, staffing and anesthetic practices reported in the literature and of the growing debate on sedation administered by non-anesthesiologists, in Europe.MethodsAnonymous online survey available to all European CIRSE members to assess IR setting, demographics, peri-procedural care, anesthetic management, resources and staffing, pain management, data collection, safety, management of emergencies and personal opinions on the role CIRSE should have in promoting anesthetic care for interventional radiology.ResultsPredictable differences betweenmoreÂ Â» countries and national regulations were confirmed, showing how significantly many âlocalâ factors (type and size of centers, the availability of dedicated inpatient bed, availability of anesthesia staff) can affect the routine practice and the expansion of IR as a subspecialty.

Current clinical methods of restoring hemostasis after large volume blood loss include platelet and clotting factor transfusion, which have respective drawbacks of short shelf-life and risk of viral transmission. Therefore, synthetic hemostatic agents that can be delivered intravenously and encourage stable clot formation after localizing to sites of vascular injury are particularly appealing. In the past three decades, platelet substitutes have been prepared using drug delivery vehicles such as liposomes and PLGA nanoparticles that have been modified to mimic platelet properties. Additionally, structural considerations such as particle size, shape, and flexibility have been addressed in a number of reports. Since platelets are the first responders after vascular injury, platelet substitutes represent an important class of intravenous hemostats under development. More recently, materials affecting fibrin formation have been introduced to induce faster or more stable blood clot formation through fibrin crosslinking. Fibrin represents a major structural component in the final blood clot, and a fibrin-based hemostatic mechanism acting downstream of initial platelet plug formation may be a safer alternative to platelets to avoid undesired thrombotic activity. This review explores intravenous hemostats under development and strategies to optimize their clotting activity.

There are numerous causes of acute GIB including but not limited to infection, vascular anomalies, inflammatory diseases, trauma, and malignancy. The diagnostic and therapeutic approach of GIB depends on its location, severity, and etiology. The role of interventional radiology becomes vital in patients whose GIB remains resistant to medical and endoscopic treatment. Radiology offers diagnostic imaging studies and endovascular therapeutic interventions that can be performed promptly and effectively with successful outcomes. Computed tomography angiography and nuclear scintigraphy can localize the source of bleeding and provide essential information for the interventional radiologist to guide therapeutic management with endovascular angiography and transcatheter embolization. This review article provides insight into the essential role of Interventional Radiology in the management of acute GIB.

Interventional radiology stands to benefit greatly from advances in nanotechnology because much of the ongoing research is focused toward novel methods of imaging and delivery of therapy through minimally invasive means. Through the development of new techniques and therapies, nanotechnology has the potential to broaden the horizon of interventional radiology and ensure its continued success. This two-part review is intended to acquaint the interventionalist with the field of nanotechnology, and provide an overview of potential applications, while highlighting advances relevant to interventional radiology. Part I ofmoreÂ Â» the article deals with an introduction to some of the basic concepts of nanotechnology and outlines some of the potential imaging applications, concentrating mainly on advances in oncological and vascular imaging.Â«Â less\n\nInterventional radiology procedures in adult patients who underwent liver transplantation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMiraglia, Roberto; Maruzzelli, Luigi; Caruso, Settimo; Milazzo, Mariapina; Marrone, Gianluca; Mamone, Giuseppe; Carollo, Vincenzo; Gruttadauria, Salvatore; Luca, Angelo; Gridelli, Bruno\n\n2009-01-01\n\nInterventional radiology has acquired a key role in every liver transplantation (LT) program by treating the majority of vascular and non-vascular post-transplant complications, improving graft and patient survival and avoiding, in the majority of cases, surgical revision and/or re-transplantation.

Aspiration and drainage of fluid collections, biliary and endourologic interventions and gastrointestinal interventions are parts of non-vascular interventions. In addition, the authors discuss in detail interventional radiological treatment options in patients with hemoptysis. In acute cases interventions must be performed within 12-24 hours. For background, an everyday 24 hours service should be provided with well-trained personnel, high quality equipment and devices, and a reasonable financial reimbursement should be included, too. Multidisciplinary teamwork, consultations, consensus in indications and structured education should make these centers function most effectively.\n\nInterventional Radiology of the Urinary Tract.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerent, Allyson C\n\n2016-05-01\n\nMinimally invasive treatment options using interventional radiology and interventional endoscopy for urologic disease have become more common over the past decade in veterinary medicine. Urinary tract obstructions and urinary incontinence are the most common reasons for urinary interventions. Ureteral obstructions are underdiagnosed and a common clinical problem in veterinary medicine. Ureteral obstructions should be considered an emergency, and decompression should be performed as quickly as possible. Diagnostic imaging is the mainstay in diagnosing a ureteral obstruction and has changed in the last few years, with ultrasound and radiographs being the most sensitive tools in making this diagnosis preoperatively.

C.; Esposito, A.; FanÃ³, L.; Paolucci, M.; Passeri, D.; Pentiricci, A.; Placidi, P.\n\n2013-08-01\n\nInterventional Radiology (IR) is a subspecialty of radiology comprehensive of all minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed using radiological devices to obtain image guidance. The interventional procedures are potentially harmful for interventional radiologists and medical staff due to the X-ray diffusion by the patient's body. The characteristic energy range of the diffused photons spans few tens of keV. In this work we will present a proposal for a new X-ray sensing element in the energy range of interest for IR procedures. The sensing element will then be assembled in a dosimeter prototype, capable of real-time measurement, packaged in a small form-factor, with wireless communication and no external power supply to be used for individual operators dosimetry for IR procedures. For the sensor, which is the heart of the system, we considered three different Active Pixel Sensors (APS). They have shown a good capability as single X-ray photon detectors, up to several tens keV photon energy. Two dosimetric quantities have been considered, the number of detected photons and the measured energy deposition. Both observables have a linear dependence with the dose, as measured by commercial dosimeters. The uncertainties in the measurement are dominated by statistic and can be pushed at Ë5% for all the sensors under test.\n\nEnvironmental monitoring in interventional radiology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDel Sol, S.; Garcia, R.; SÃ¡nchez-GuzmÃ¡n, D.; Ramirez, G.; Chavarin, E. U.; Rivera, T.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe procedures in Interventional Radiology involve long times of exposure and high number of radiographic images that bring higher radiation doses to patients, staff and environmental than those received in conventional Radiology. Currently for monitoring the dose, the thermoluminescent dosimetry use is recommended. The aim of this work was to carry out the monitoring of the environmental scattered radiation inside the IR room using two types of thermoluminescent dosimeters, TLD-100 (reference dosimeter), CaSO4:Dy (synthesized in our laboratory). The results indicate that the TLD-100 is not effective for the environmental monitoring of low-energy Rx rooms. The CaSO4:Dy presented good behaviour over the 6 months of study. The results will be specific to each room so it is recommended such studies as part of the program of quality control of each Rx room.\n\nDifferent chemical groups modification on the surface of chitosan nonwoven dressing and the hemostatic properties.\n\nPubMed\n\nYan, Dong; Hu, Shihao; Zhou, Zhongzheng; Zeenat, Shah; Cheng, Feng; Li, Yang; Feng, Chao; Cheng, Xiaojie; Chen, Xiguang\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe hemostatic properties of surface modified chitosan nonwoven had been investigated. The succinyl groups, carboxymethyl groups and quaternary ammonium groups were introduced into the surface of chitosan nonwoven (obtained NSCS, CMCS and TMCS nonwoven, respectively). For blood clotting, absorbance value (0.105Â±0.03) of NSCS1 nonwoven was the smallest (CS 0.307Â±0.002, NSCS2 0.148Â±0.002, CMCS1 0.195Â±0.02, CMCS2 0.233Â±0.001, TMCS1 0.191Â±0.002, TMCS2 0.345Â±0.002), which indicated the stronger hemostatic potential. For platelet aggregation, adenosine diphosphate agonist was added to induce the nonwoven to adhered platelets. The aggregation of platelet with TMCS2 nonwoven was highest (10.97Â±0.16%). Further research of blood coagulation mechanism was discussed, which indicated NSCS and CMCS nonwoven could activate the intrinsic pathway of coagulation to accelerate blood coagulation. NSCS1 nonwoven showed the shortest hemostatic time (147Â±3.7s) and the lowest blood loss (0.23Â±0.05g) in a rabbit ear artery injury model. These results demonstrated that these surface modified chitosan nonwoven dressings could use as a promising hemostatic intervention, especially NSCS nonwoven dressing. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Interventional radiology can be used to prevent or treat life-threatening haemorrhage, but evidence for its efficacy is limited to case series predominantly from large tertiary centres. The current availability of interventional radiology for management of obstetric haemorrhage in the UK is unknown. A postal questionnaire on the use of interventional radiology was sent to the lead clinician for obstetric anaesthesia in 226 UK maternity units. The response rate was 72%; 74 respondents (46%) had considered and 51 (31%) used interventional radiology for control of obstetric haemorrhage. Its use was primarily confined to large tertiary obstetric units and limited by availability of equipment and staff. Interventional radiology to assist in the management of obstetric haemorrhage is not uniformly available in the UK and experience remains limited. Access to this resource is subject to striking local variability and influenced by the size and nature of the hospital supporting the delivery unit. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the recent improvements in the endoscopic, hemostatic and adjuvant pharmacologic techniques, the reported mortality is still around 5%-10% for peptic ulcer bleeding and about 15%-20% for variceal hemorrhages. Although endoscopic management reduces the rates of re-bleeding, surgery, and mortality in active bleeding; early recurrence ratios still occur in around 20% of the cases even with effective initial hemostatic measures. In this quest for an alternative pro-hemostatic agent for the management of GI bleedings, Ankaferd blood stopper (ABS) offers a successful candidate, specifically for âdifficult-to-manageâ situations as evidenced by data presented in several studies. ABS is a standardized mixture of the plants Thymus vulgaris, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Vitis vinifera, Alpinia officinarum, and Urtica dioica. It is effective in both bleeding individuals with normal hemostatic parameters and in patients with deficient primary and/or secondary hemostasis. ABS also modulates the cellular apoptotic responses to hemorrhagic stress, as well as hemostatic hemodynamic activity. Through its effects on the endothelium, blood cells, angiogenesis, cellular proliferation, vascular dynamics, and wound healing, ABS is now becoming an effective alternative hemostatic medicine for gastrointestinal bleedings that are resistant to conventional anti-hemorrhagic measurements. The aim of this review is to outline current literature experience suggesting the place of ABS in the management of GI bleeding, and potential future controlled trials in this complicated field.

This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) level of radiation protection (RP) among interventional radiology staff in Iranian health care centers across the country. We used a validated questionnaire survey consisting of 30 multiple-choice questions to perform a cross-sectional study. Participants were healthcare personnel working professionally with radiation at different levels (i.e., secretary, radiology technologists, nurse, and physician). The questionnaire was divided into three sections to assess KAP regarding RP. Significant differences exist in RP KAP mean scores based on educational age (p < 0.050). There was no significant difference in RP KAP mean scores when looking at sex, practice age, and hospital type (p > 0.050). We found a significant difference between RP KAP mean scores and different regions (p < 0.050). Educational and practice age, sex, type of hospital, and geographical region affect he KAP of interventional radiology staff regarding RP. Since many of the subjective radiation harms for both medical team and patients, this can be easily controlled and prevented; a checkup for personnel of interventional radiology departments, considering samples from different parts of the country with different levels of education, continuous training, and practical courses may help map the status of KAP. The results of this study may also help authorized health physics officers design strategic plans to enhance the quality of such services in radiation departments.\n\nComparison of transcutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound-guided injected hemostatic agents with traditional surgery treatment for liver, spleen and kidney trauma: a retrospective study.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Dong; Lv, Faqin; Luo, Yukun; An, Lichun; Li, Junlai; Xie, Xia; Tian, Jiangke; Zhao, Weiyan; Tang, Jie\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThere is lack of studies on the effectiveness of transcutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound-guided injections of hemostatic agents for liver. spleen and kidney trauma. We compared treatment by hemostatic agents to surgical treatment in a retrospective interventional human study. The study enrolled a total of 135 subjects from emergency unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital in Beijing. Within the cohort, 62 patients received contrast enhanced ultrasound-guided injection of hemostatic agents and the rest received surgical treatments. The injury severity score was lower in the hemostatic agent treatment group than surgical treatment group (p<0.05), but Glasgow coma scale scores did not reach statistical significance. The patients in the surgical treatment group had significantly higher hospital fees than those in the hemostatic treatment group (p<0.05), although the length of hospitalization did not significantly differ between two groups. Safety outcome variables pre- and post-treatment remained within normal limits in both groups. Hemostatic agents were more cost-effective than surgery to treat patients with liver, spleen and kidney trauma. How"
