        "text": "In 1901, if you were lucky, you might have witnessed a startling scene on the streets of London—one which would quickly revolutionise how most of us clean our homes.\n\nEngineer Hubert Cecil Booth was rolling his new vacuum cleaner onto the wealthier streets of town.\n\nFirst employed by Maudslay, Sons and Field in Lambeth in the 1890s, at the time he was better known for designing suspension bridges and fairground Ferris wheels (including Vienna’s famous Riesenrad).\n\nBut in 1901 he turned his skill to carpet cleaning after witnessing the demonstration of a new machine at London’s Empire Music Hall.\n\nHe realised that the machine on display had a fatal flaw. It was designed to blow out air in the hope of raising the dust from the carpet and into the collecting bag. The inventor told him that the method Booth suggested instead—sucking up the dirt through a filter—was impossible.\n\nChallenge accepted, Booth set off on a mission to produce a machine that would suck, not blow.\n\nAfter allegedly near-fatal tests—in which he choked after putting a handkerchief 'filter' over his mouth and sucking up dust from the arm of a chair—Booth formed the British Vacuum Cleaner Company and launched his new device. This was the huge beast of a machine seen doing the rounds of wealthy Londoners' homes at the start of the 20th century.\n\nAfter a flurry of disapproval and a string of court cases, both against the disruption the machine caused on the streets (including frightening horses) and from a series of disgruntled inventors, Booth finally convinced judge and jury that his powerful machine was the only vacuum cleaner at the time that actually worked.\n\nCleaning everywhere from Buckingham Palace to the Royal Mint and Crystal Palace—where 26 tons of dust were removed from the girders during a First World War outbreak of spotted fever—its credentials were soon established as a reliable cleaning machine.\n\nVacuum cleaners were purchased by Russia's Tzar Nicholas II, Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II, the House of Commons and the popular Dickens & Jones department store in London.\n\nDespite the drama and theatre of Booth’s machine, the basic technology and the suction principle was the same as in most vacuum cleaners today. Vacuum cleaners soon got smaller, more portable and—most importantly—cheaper. Smaller motor-powered vacuum cleaners, famously from Hoover and Electrolux, began to appear before 1915.\n\nFor wealthier households, the annual evacuation so servants could complete their spring cleaning became a thing of the past. Rich homeowners purchased the new vacuum cleaners, eager to be seen as early adopters of the technology, or looking to retain domestic help made scarce by the First World War.\n\nThe introduction of electrically powered household appliances from the late 19th century provided a vision of a leisure-filled future for homeowners—and less drudgery for servants and home helps.\n\nPowered carpet cleaners, washing machines and dryers, electric or gas irons and dishwashers all gradually appeared—more recently joined by smart and robotic technologies. But despite these time and labour-saving devices, households are spending about the same time on chores as 100 years ago.\n\nWhy? Factors such as higher expected standards of hygiene, the number of laundry loads and the increasing amount of time we spend on domestic tasks such as pet care and childcare have all played their part.\n\nThe work might be less physical, but we’re doing just as much of it. And despite some change in the gender chore gap, women are still doing more of it than men.\n\nSo will the current raft of smart appliances and gadgets—from robotic vacuum cleaners to self-cleaning windows and ovens—finally give us that long-promised future of R&R? Only time will tell."
