        "text": "Solar Forced Dansgaard/Oeschger Events?\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMuscheler, R.; Beer, J.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nClimate records for the last ice age (which ended 11,500 years ago) show enormous climate fluctuations in the North Atlantic region - the so-called Dansgaard/Oeschger events. During these events air temperatures in Greenland changed on the order of 10 degrees Celsius within a few decades. These changes were attributed to shifts in ocean circulation which influences the warm water supply from lower latitudes to the North Atlantic region. Interestingly, the rapid warmings tend to recur approximately every 1500 years or multiples thereof. This has led researchers to speculate about an external cause for these changes with the variable Sun being one possible candidate. Support for this hypothesis came from climate reconstructions, which suggested that the Sun influenced the climate in the North Atlantic region on these time scales during the last approximately 12,000 years of relatively stable Holocene climate. However, Be-10 measurements in ice cores do not indicate that the Sun caused or triggered the Dansgaard/Oeschger events. Depending on the solar magnetic shielding more or less Be-10 is produced in the Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, 10Be can be used as a proxy for solar activity changes. Since Be-10 can be measured in ice cores, it is possible to compare the variable solar forcing directly with the climate record from the same ice core. This removes any uncertainties in the relative dating, and the solar-climate link can be reliably studied. Notwithstanding that some Dansgaard/Oeschger warmings could be related to increased solar activity, there is no indication that this is the case for all of the Dansgaard/Oeschger events. Therefore, during the last ice age the Be-10 and ice core climate data do not indicate a persistent solar influence on North Atlantic climate.\n\nDansgaard-Oeschger events and their reflection in speleothems (Hans Oeschger Medal Lecture)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBar-Matthews, Miryam\n\n2013-04-01\n\nSpeleothems in karstic cave environments form by passage of meteoric water through the overlying soils, where the water dissolves CO2 to form carbonic acid, which in turn dissolves the host-rock carbonate. Degassing of the carbonate supersaturated meteoric water leads to the formation of calcite speleothems, which therefore can be considered as the end product in the much larger sea-atmosphere-land cycle. Their stable isotopic and geochemical composition reflect the environmental conditions above the cave, which in turn depend on larger scale parameters such as isotopic composition of the rainfall source, atmospheric storm patterns, ocean-land heat transfer. In this talk I specifically address the potential of using speleothems to look at short term climatic events: the Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events; rapid climate changes first observed in Greenland ice cores by Hans Oeschger with Willi Dansgaard and suggested to occur during the last glacial period. Many researches now show that D-O events are globally synchronous and can be identified in the marine and terrestrial climate records. Given, the ability to accurately date speleothems and to perform high-resolution studies of stable isotopes, trace elements and various other proxies (e.g., fluid inclusions, 'clumped isotopes' thermometry), it has become clear that speleothems enable us to better date the exact timing of D-O events and to understand the climatic response on land in different parts of the world to their occurrence, i.e., to address specific questions on the marine-atmosphere interaction, sea surface temperature, rainfall generation and their influence on human habitation and dispersal. Since the stable isotopic signal in speleothems primarily is a function of temperature and isotopic composition of rainfall, short time climatic events can be registered in fast growing speleothems. Indeed recent studies clearly demonstrate that D-O events are registered in speleothems, for example, vegetation changes\n\nResponse of North American Great Basin Lakes to Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillations\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBenson, L.; Lund, S.; Negrini, R.; Linsley, B.; Zic, M.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nWe correlate oscillations in the hydrologic and/or cryologic balances of four Great Basin surface-water systems with Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events 2-12. This correlation is relatively strong at the location of the magnetic signature used to link the lake records, but becomes less well constrained with distance/time from the signature. Comparison of proxy glacial and hydrologic records from Owens and Pyramid lakes indicates that Sierran glacial advances occurred during times of relative dryness. If our hypothesized correlation between the lake-based records and the GISP2 ??18O record is correct, it suggests that North Atlantic D-O stades were associated with relatively cold and dry conditions and that interstades were associated with relatively warm and wet conditions throughout the Great Basin between 50,500 and 27,000 GISP2yr B.P. The Great Basin lacustrine climate records reinforce the hypothesis that D-O events affected the climate throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere during marine isotope stages 2 and 3. However, the absolute phasing between lake-size and ice-core ??18O records remains difficult to determine.\n\nRandom and externally controlled occurrences of Dansgaard-Oeschger events\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLohmann, Johannes; Ditlevsen, Peter D.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nDansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events constitute the most pronounced mode of centennial to millennial climate variability of the last glacial period. Since their discovery, many decades of research have been devoted to understand the origin and nature of these rapid climate shifts. In recent years, a number of studies have appeared that report emergence of DO-type variability in fully coupled general circulation models via different mechanisms. These mechanisms result in the occurrence of DO events at varying degrees of regularity, ranging from periodic to random. When examining the full sequence of DO events as captured in the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) ice core record, one can observe high irregularity in the timing of individual events at any stage within the last glacial period. In addition to the prevailing irregularity, certain properties of the DO event sequence, such as the average event frequency or the relative distribution of cold versus warm periods, appear to be changing throughout the glacial. By using statistical hypothesis tests on simple event models, we investigate whether the observed event sequence may have been generated by stationary random processes or rather was strongly modulated by external factors. We find that the sequence of DO warming events is consistent with a stationary random process, whereas dividing the event sequence into warming and cooling events leads to inconsistency with two independent event processes. As we include external forcing, we find a particularly good fit to the observed DO sequence in a model where the average residence time in warm periods are controlled by global ice volume and cold periods by boreal summer insolation.\n\nPrecise dating of Dansgaard-Oeschger climate oscillations in western Europe from stalagmite data.\n\nPubMed\n\nGenty, D; Blamart, D; Ouahdi, R; Gilmour, M; Baker, A; Jouzel, J; Van-Exter, Sandra\n\n2003-02-20\n\nThe signature of Dansgaard-Oeschger events--millennial-scale abrupt climate oscillations during the last glacial period--is well established in ice cores and marine records. But the effects of such events in continental settings are not as clear, and their absolute chronology is uncertain beyond the limit of (14)C dating and annual layer counting for marine records and ice cores, respectively. Here we present carbon and oxygen isotope records from a stalagmite collected in southwest France which have been precisely dated using 234U/230Th ratios. We find rapid climate oscillations coincident with the established Dansgaard-Oeschger events between 83,000 and 32,000 years ago in both isotope records. The oxygen isotope signature is similar to a record from Soreq cave, Israel, and deep-sea records, indicating the large spatial scale of the climate oscillations. The signal in the carbon isotopes gives evidence of drastic and rapid vegetation changes in western Europe, an important site in human cultural evolution. We also find evidence for a long phase of extremely cold climate in southwest France between 61.2 +/- 0.6 and 67.4 +/- 0.9 kyr ago.\n\nInterpreting the power spectrum of Dansgaard-Oeschger events via stochastic dynamical systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMitsui, Takahito; Lenoir, Guillaume; Crucifix, Michel\n\n2017-04-01\n\nDansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events are abrupt climate shifts, which are particularly pronounced in the North Atlantic region during glacial periods [Dansgaard et al. 1993]. The signals are most clearly found in Î´ 18O or log [Ca2+] records of Greenland ice cores. The power spectrum S(f) of DO events has attracted attention over two decades with debates on the apparent 1.5-kyr periodicity [Grootes & Stuiver 1997; Schultz et al. 2002; Ditlevsen et al. 2007] and scaling property over several time scales [Schmitt, Lovejoy, & Schertzer 1995; Rypdal & Rypdal 2016]. The scaling property is written most simply as S(f)Ë f-Î² , Î² â 1.4. However, physical as well as underlying dynamics of the periodicity and the scaling property are still not clear. Pioneering works for modelling the spectrum of DO events are done by Cessi (1994) and Ditlevsen (1999), but their model-data comparisons of the spectra are rather qualitative. Here, we show that simple stochastic dynamical systems can generate power spectra statistically consistent with the observed spectra over a wide range of frequency from orbital to the Nyquist frequency (=1/40 yr-1). We characterize the scaling property of the spectrum by defining a local scaling exponentÎ² _loc. For the NGRIP log [Ca2+] record, the local scaling exponent Î² _loc increases from Ë 1 to Ë 2 as the frequency increases from Ë 1/5000 yr-1 to Ë 1/500 yr-1, and Î² _loc decreases toward zero as the frequency increases from Ë 1/500 yr-1 to the Nyquist frequency. For the Î´ 18O record, the local scaling exponent Î² _loc increases from Ë 1 to Ë 1.5 as the frequency increases from Ë 1/5000 yr^{-1 to Ë 1/1000 yr-1, and Î² _loc decreases toward zero as the frequency increases from Ë 1/1000 yr-1 to the Nyquist frequency. This systematic breaking of a single scaling is reproduced by the simple stochastic models. Especially, the models suggest that the flattening of the spectra starting from multi-centennial scale and ending at the Nyquist frequency\n\nIce core Î´D(CH4) record precludes marine hydrate CH4 emissions at the onset of Dansgaard-Oeschger events\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBock, M.; Schmitt, J.; MÃ¶ller, L.; Spahni, R.; Blunier, T.; Fischer, H.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nAir enclosures in polar ice cores represent the only direct paleoatmospheric archive (besides firn air) and show that atmospheric CH4 concentrations changed in concert with northern hemisphere temperature during both glacial/interglacial transitions as well as rapid climate changes (Dansgaard-Oeschger events). For stadials and interstadials during Marine Isotope Stage 3 concentration jumps of 100 - 200 ppbv within a few decades are observed. A concentration gradient with higher values in the northern versus the southern hemisphere during warm stages was reconstructed from ice core methane data from Greenland and Antarctica. This gradient indicates additional methane emissions during warm periods located in the northern hemisphere. However, the underlying processes for these changes are still not well understood. With tropical and boreal wetlands, biomass burning, thermokarst lakes, ruminants, termites, UV-induced emissions from organic matter and marine gas hydrates all contributing to the natural atmospheric CH4 level, an unambiguous source attribution remains difficult. Also changes in the methane sinks can modify the tropospheric CH4 budget, as trace gases like volatile organic compounds are competing for the major reactant - the OH radical. Additionally, the changing global atmospheric methane concentration itself feeds back on its lifetime. Together with the CH4 interhemispheric gradient, stable hydrogen and carbon isotopic studies on methane (Î´D(CH4) and Î´13CH4) in ice cores allow to constrain individual CH4 source/sink changes. Here we present clear evidence from the North Greenland Ice Core Project ice core based on the hydrogen isotopic composition of methane Î´D(CH4) that clathrates did not cause atmospheric methane concentration to rise at the onset of Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events 7 and 8 (34 - 41 kilo years before present), however, we can not exclude that they played a minor role during and at the end of an interstadial.

W.; Munday, D. R.; Stokes, C.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nMany northern hemisphere climate records, particularly those from around the North Atlantic, show a series of rapid climate changes that recurred on centennial to millennial timescales throughout most of the last glacial period. These Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) sequences are observed most prominently in Greenland ice cores, although they have a global signature, including an out of phase Antarctic signal. They consist of warming jumps of order 10Â°C, occurring in typically 40 years, followed generally by a slow cooling (Greenland Interstadial, GI) lasting between a few centuries and a few millennia, and then a final rapid temperature drop into a cold Greenland Stadial (GS) that lasts for a similar period. The most distinctive feature of D-O cycles is the rapid warming event, often attributed to a sudden change in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Recent work has suggested that AMOC is most easily disrupted by freshwater delivered through the Arctic. We suggest that the proposed AMOC changes may have occurred as part of a natural oscillation, in which runoff from the Laurentide ice sheet into the Arctic is controlled by temperature around the North Atlantic. The Arctic buffers the salinity changes, but under warm conditions, high runoff eventually leads to water entering the North Atlantic with low enough salinity to switch AMOC into its weaker state. Under the colder conditions now prevailing, the Arctic is starved of runoff, and the salinity rises until a further switch occurs. Contrary to many previous studies, this mechanism does not require large freshwater pulses to the North Atlantic. Instead, steady changes in ice-sheet runoff, driven by the AMOC, lead to a naturally arising oscillator, in which the rapid warmings come about because the Arctic Ocean is starved of freshwater. The changing size of the ice sheets would have affected the magnitude and extent of runoff, and we suggest that this may provide a simple explanation\n\nRapid subtropical North Atlantic salinity oscillations across Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmidt, Matthew W; Vautravers, Maryline J; Spero, Howard J\n\n2006-10-05\n\nGeochemical and sedimentological evidence suggest that the rapid climate warming oscillations of the last ice age, the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, were coupled to fluctuations in North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation through its regulation of poleward heat flux. The balance between cold meltwater from the north and warm, salty subtropical gyre waters from the south influenced the strength and location of North Atlantic overturning circulation during this period of highly variable climate. Here we investigate how rapid reorganizations of the ocean-atmosphere system across these cycles are linked to salinity changes in the subtropical North Atlantic gyre. We combine Mg/Ca palaeothermometry and oxygen isotope ratio measurements on planktonic foraminifera across four Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles (spanning 45.9-59.2 kyr ago) to generate a seawater salinity proxy record from a subtropical gyre deep-sea sediment core. We show that North Atlantic gyre surface salinities oscillated rapidly between saltier stadial conditions and fresher interstadials, covarying with inferred shifts in the Tropical Atlantic hydrologic cycle and North Atlantic overturning circulation. These salinity oscillations suggest a reduction in precipitation into the North Atlantic and/or reduced export of deep salty thermohaline waters during stadials. We hypothesize that increased stadial salinities preconditioned the North Atlantic Ocean for a rapid return to deep overturning circulation and high-latitude warming by contributing to increased North Atlantic surface-water density on interstadial transitions.\n\nIce sheet runoff and Dansgaard-Oeschger Cycles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHewitt, Ian; Wolff, Eric; Fowler, Andrew; Clark, Chris; Evatt, Geoff; Johnson, Helen; Munday, David; Rickaby, Ros; Stokes, Chris\n\n2016-04-01\n\nMany northern hemisphere climate records, particularly those from around the North Atlantic, show a series of rapid climate changes that recurred on centennial to millennial timescales throughout most of the last glacial period.

Most explanations for D-O events call on changes in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength, and the majority of such explanations use changes in freshwater delivery from ice sheets as a trigger. Many have relied on large inputs of freshwater from singular events (such as lake outbursts or iceberg armadas) to push the AMOC into its cold state. However the evidence for such events at the right time in each cycle is sparse. Here we investigate mechanisms that would arise from a change in the rate of ice sheet runoff, which would be a natural feedback from each rapid warming or cooling event. Recent work has suggested that AMOC is most easily disrupted by freshwater delivered through the Arctic. We investigate whether the proposed AMOC changes could have occurred as part of a natural oscillation, in which runoff from the Laurentide ice sheet into the Arctic is controlled by temperature around the North Atlantic. The Arctic buffers the salinity changes, but under warm conditions, high runoff eventually leads to water entering the North Atlantic with low enough salinity to switch AMOC into its weaker state.

J.; Fleitmann, D.; Mangini, A.; Matter, A.; Guilderson, T.; Reimer, P. J.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nA 1.7 m long stalagmite from Moomi Cave, Socotra Island in the Indian Ocean provides a continuous, high- resolution record of climate change between 53 and 41 kyr BP. In the northern high-latitude regions, this time period is characterized by several rapid climate change events, corresponding to Dansgaard-Oeschger (D/O) cycles 10-13. It has been suggested that these D/O cycles may be global events but high-resolution data from the low-latitude regions are scarce. As a result, the driving and feedback mechanisms of these rapid changes remain poorly understood. The presented stalagmite data of U/Th, stable isotopes (del 18O, del 13C) and radiocarbon (14C) provide unique information regarding the nature and timing of rapid climate changes in the tropics. A depth-age model for the Moomi Cave stalagmite was developed from 25 high-precision U/Th measurements, providing a solid chronology for this record. Oxygen isotope measurements of the stalagmite calcite reveal several large variations that are believed to reflect changes in the amount of precipitation, rather than temperature. A comparison to the Greenland Ice Core records shows a remarkable similarity to D/O cycles 10- 13 with warmer periods in the high-latitude regions being associated with increased precipitation in the tropics and vice versa. The stalagmite radiocarbon (14C) values from over 100 individual measurements reveal an almost identical cyclic pattern, tracing all four D/O cycles. Assuming no changes in the carbonate chemistry of the precipitating fluid, the radiocarbon values of the stalagmite calcite directly reflect changes in global atmospheric 14C concentrations. There are three possible explanations for these cyclic variations of 14C values: 1) changes in the carbonate chemistry of the drip water resulting in changes of the dead carbon fraction (DCF); 2) changes in the solar activity and/or Earth's magnetic field resulting in direct variations of atmospheric 14C concentrations; and 3) changes in\n\nDecadal-scale progression of Dansgaard-Oeschger warming events - Are warmings at the end of Heinrich-Stadials different from others?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nErhardt, T.; Capron, E.; Rasmussen, S.; Schuepbach, S.; Bigler, M.; Fischer, H.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nDuring the last glacial period proxy records throughout the Northern Hemisphere document a succession of rapid millennial-scale warming events, called Dansgaard Oeschger (DO) events. Marine proxy records from the Atlantic also reveal, that some of the warming events where preceded by large ice rafting events, referred to as Heinrich events. Different mechanisms have been proposed, that can produce DO-like warming in model experiments, however the progression and plausible trigger of the events and their possible interplay with the Heinrich events is still unknown. Because of their fast nature, the progression is challenging to reconstruct from paleoclimate data due to the temporal resolution achievable in many archives and cross-dating uncertainties between records. We use new high-resolution multi-proxy records of sea-salt and terrestrial aerosol concentrations over the period 10-60 ka from two Greenland deep ice cores in conjunction with local precipitation and temperature proxy records from one of the cores to investigate the progression of environmental changes at the onset of the individual warming events. The timing differences are then used to explore whether the DO warming events that terminate Heinrich-Stadials progressed differently in comparison to those after Non-Heinrich-Stadials. Our analysis indicates no difference in the progression of the warming terminating Heinrich-Stadials and Non-Heinrich-Stadials. Combining the evidence from all warming events in the period, our analysis shows a consistent lead of the changes in both local precipitation and terrestrial dust aerosol concentrations over the change in sea-salt aerosol concentrations and local temperature by approximately one decade. This implies that both the moisture transport to Greenland and the intensity of the Asian winter monsoon changed before the sea-ice cover in the North Atlantic was reduced, rendering a collapse of the sea-ice cover as a trigger for the DO events unlikely.\n\nCoherent Sea Ice Variations in the Nordic Seas and Abrupt Greenland Climate Changes over Dansgaard-Oeschger Cycles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSadatzki, H.; Berben, S.; Dokken, T.; Stein, R.; Fahl, K.; Jansen, E.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nRapid changes in sea ice extent in the Nordic Seas may have played a crucial role in controlling the abruptness of ocean circulation and climate changes associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles during the last glacial (Li et al., 2010; Dokken et al., 2013). To investigate the role of sea ice for abrupt climate changes, we produced a sea ice record from the Norwegian Sea Core MD99-2284 at a temporal resolution approaching that of ice core records, covering four D-O cycles at ca. 32-41 ka. This record is based on the sea ice diatom biomarker IP25, open-water phytoplankton biomarker dinosterol and semi-quantitative phytoplankton-IP25 (PIP25) estimates. A detailed tephrochronology of MD99-2284 corroborates the tuning-based age model and independently constrains the GS9/GIS8 transition, allowing for direct comparison between our sediment and ice core records. For cold stadials we find extremely low fluxes of total organic carbon, dinosterol and IP25, which points to a general absence of open-water phytoplankton and ice algae production under a near-permanent sea ice cover. For the interstadials, in turn, all biomarker fluxes are strongly enhanced, reflecting a highly productive sea ice edge situation and implying largely open ocean conditions for the eastern Nordic Seas. As constrained by three tephra layers, we observe that the stadial-interstadial sea ice decline was rapid and may have induced a coeval abrupt northward shift in the Greenland precipitation moisture source as recorded in ice cores. The sea ice retreat also facilitated a massive heat release through deep convection in the previously stratified Nordic Seas, generating atmospheric warming of the D-O events. We thus conclude that rapid changes in sea ice extent in the Nordic Seas amplified oceanic reorganizations and were a key factor in controlling abrupt Greenland climate changes over D-O cycles.

Great uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics of the DO cycle, as well as controls on the timing and duration of individual events. Using ice core data we show that the duration of warm (interstadial) periods is strongly correlated with Antarctic climate, and presumably with Southern Ocean (SO) temperature and the position of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) westerlies. We propose a SO control on AMOC stability and interstadial duration via the rate of Antarctic bottom water formation, meridional density/pressure gradients, Agulhas Leakage, and SO adiabatic upwelling. This hypothesis is supported by climate model experiments that demonstrate SO warming leads to a stronger AMOC that is less susceptible to freshwater perturbations. In the AMOC stability diagram, SO warming and strengthening of the SH westerlies both shift the vigorous AMOC branch toward higher freshwater values, thus raising the threshold for AMOC collapse. The proposed mechanism could provide a consistent explanation for several diverse observations, including maximum DO activity during intermediate ice volume/SH temperature, and successively shorter DO durations within each Bond cycle. It may further have implications for the fate of the AMOC under future global warming.\n\nStrengthening of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific Oxygen Minimum Zone during Marine Isotope Stage 3 despite the intensification of Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChoumiline, K.; Lyons, T. W.; Carriquiry, J. D.; Perez-Cruz, L. L.; Raiswell, R.; Beaufort, L.; Rafter, P. A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) is sensitive to climatic changes that either strengthen or weaken the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ). Paleoproxy and model evidence indicate that the shifts from cold stadials (LGM, MIS4) to warm interstadials are often accompanied by sudden sea level rise, intensification of marine productivity and enhanced oceanic anoxia. These intermediate states remain enigmatic, especially with overimposed Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) oscillations and Heinrich events. We present a high-resolution reconstruction of productivity (Corg, P, Cd, Ni, Ba) and redox (Fe/Al, FeHR/FeT, Mo, V, U) of the ETNP over the last glacial period with special emphasis on the MIS3 transition (roughly 30-60 kyr BP). We found that the OMZ was profoundly anoxic throughout that interval, based on marine sedimentary paleoproxy records. Our spatiotemporal reconstruction shows that the geographic extent of enhanced deoxygenation during the MIS3 not only encompassed the Gulf of California (Alfonso, La Paz and Guaymas Basin), Pacific margin off Mazatlan and Baja California (Soledad Basin), but also California (Santa Barbara Basin) and western Canadian margins. The OMZ achieved its peak strength during 45-60 kyr BP exposed by the highest Mo (35 mg/kg), V (120 mg/kg) and U (13 mg/kg) values, and then commenced weakening and contracting onto the LGM. Marine productivity was also reportedly high during the MIS3, mostly mirroring the redox signals. In contrast, MIS4 and LGM were well-oxygenated and depleted in redox proxies (as low as 4 mg/kg of Mo, 60 mg/kg of V and 4 mg/kg of U). Despite of enhanced anoxia or even euxinia during the MIS3, the effect of cold D-O and Heinrich events was unmistakable. Most of these perturbations corresponded to low export production (low Corg, P, Cd/Al, Ni/Al and Ba/Al) and good ventilation of the ETNP. The recoveries after these events were relatively quick and anoxic conditions were re-established within hundreds of years. As of now, there is no\n\nDansgaard Oeschger Dynamics: Clearly Revealed in a Comprehensive Model of Glacial Climate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPeltier, W. Richard; Vettoretti, Guido\n\n2017-04-01\n\nMore than 30 years ago, Willi Dansgaard in Copenhagen and Hans Oeschger in Bern established the existence of millennium timescale oscillations in oxygen isotope stratigraphies from Greenland ice cores. This isotopic signal was interpreted as implying large amplitude variations in surface air temperature. Until the publication of Peltier and Vettoretti (2014, GRL) the prevalent view had been that this exclusively ice-age phenomenon, thought to be linked to variability in the strength of the Atlantic MOC, was considered to be forced by the episodic release of freshwater from the continental ice sheets, each oscillation requiring its own freshwater input. In Peltier and Vettoretti (2014) this phenomenon was recovered for the first time in a comprehensive model of glacial climate, specifically the CESM1 model of the NCAR laboratory. Attention was drawn to the fact that individual D-O oscillations, or Bond Cycle clusters of such oscillations, were inevitably preceded by individual Heinrich events. In Peltier and Vettoretti (2014) it was shown that, following the \"spin-up\" of CESM1 into the glacial state, with continental ice sheet volume held fixed, a sequence of nonlinear unforced and therefor \"free\" oscillations of the MOC occurred, following a sharp Heinrich event-like sharp suppression of MOC strength. All of the salient characteristics of the D-O process inferred on the basis of ice core evidence from both hemispheres were fully captured in these high (CMIP5) resolution simulations, namely: (i) the pulse shape of the individual oscillations characterized by an extremely rapid shift from cold stadial to warm interstadial conditions followed by a slow return to the stadial state, (ii) the peak-to-peak variations in Greenland surface air temperature of 10-15 degrees Centigrade during individual oscillations, (iii) the \"bi-polar see saw\" connection between this Northern Hemisphere process and that recorded in the EDML and WAIS Divide ice cores from Antarctica, (iv) the\n\nGlacial Isostatic Adjustment Derived Boundary Conditions for Paleoclimate Simulation: the Refined ICE-6G_D (VM5a) Model and the Dansgaard-Oeschger Oscillation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPeltier, W.

The most recent refinement of the ICE-NG (VMX) series of such global models from the University of Toronto, ICE-6G_C (VM5a), has recently been slightly modified insofar as its Antarctic component is concerned to produce a \"_D\" version of the structure. This has been chosen to provide the boundary conditions for the next round of model-data inter-comparisons in the context of the international Paleoclimate Modeling Inter-comparison Project (PMIP). The output of PMIP will contribute to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which is now under way. A highly significant test of the utility of this latest model has recently been performed that is focused upon the Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillation that was the primary source of climate variability during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3) of the most recent glacial cycle. By introducing the surface boundary conditions for paleotopography and paleobathymetry, land-sea mask and surface albedo into the NCAR CESM1 coupled climate model configured at full one degree by one degree CMIP5 resolution, together with the appropriate trace gas and orbital insolation forcing, we show that the millennium timescale Dansgard-Oeschger oscillation naturally develops following spin- up of the model into the glacial state.\n\nTropical North Atlantic subsurface temperature anomalies: evidence for AMOC variability across Dansgaard-Oscheger events?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nParker, A. O.; Schmidt, M. W.; Chang, P.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nA common mechanism often proposed to explain the abrupt climate events of Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3), known as Dansgaard-Oscheger (D-O) cycles, invokes variability in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Although proxy evidence shows that D-O cycles resulted in large-scale changes in atmospheric circulation patterns around the planet, an understanding of how the AMOC varied across these events remains unclear. Coupled ocean-atmosphere models demonstrate that AMOC variability is linked to abrupt change in the tropical North Atlantic (TNA) through both oceanic and atmospheric processes. A reduction in AMOC causes a subsurface oceanic warming in the TNA as the western boundary current slows, allowing the warm salinity maximum waters to enter the deep tropics. Recently, Schmidt et al. (2012) identified an abrupt subsurface warming at the onset of AMOC slow down during both Heinrich 1 and the Younger Dryas, suggesting this signal may be a robust feature of AMOC variability in the TNA. In order to determine if AMOC variability was the driver of D-O cycles during MIS 3, we present new, high-resolution Mg/Ca and Î´18O records from the near-surface dwelling planktonic foraminifera G. ruber and the lower-thermocline dwelling planktonic foraminifera G. crassaformis from 22 - 52 ka BP in southern Caribbean core VM12-107 (11.33oN, 66.63oW, 1079m depth). Sedimentation rates in VM12-107 average 24cm/kyr, providing high temporal resolution able to resolve millennial-scale events. The G. ruber Î´18O record shows abrupt oscillations up to 1â° as well as Mg/Ca-based SST changes of 1.5 - 2oC that are synchronous with some D-O cycles recorded in the Greenland ice cores. Given our ability to resolve D-O cycles in the planktonic record, we find that Mg/Ca ratios from G. crassaformis were, on average, 0.13 Ã 0.04 mmol/mol higher during stadials. This equates to a temperature increase during stadials of up to 1.5oC. These results imply that AMOC\n\nAbrupt climate change: Past, present and the search for precursors as an aid to predicting events in the future (Hans Oeschger Medal Lecture)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMayewski, Paul Andrew\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe demonstration using Greenland ice cores that abrupt shifts in climate, Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, existed during the last glacial period has had a transformational impact on our understanding of climate change in the naturally forced world. The demonstration that D-O events are globally distributed and that they operated during previous glacial periods has led to extensive research into the relative hemispheric timing and causes of these events. The emergence of civilization during our current interglacial, the Holocene, has been attributed to the \"relative climate quiescence\" of this period relative to the massive, abrupt shifts in climate that characterized glacial periods in the form of D-O events. But, everything is relative and climate change is no exception. The demise of past civilizations, (eg., Mesopatamian, Mayan and Norse) is integrally tied to abrupt climate change (ACC) events operating at regional scales. Regionally to globally distributed ACC events have punctuated the Holocene and extreme events have always posed significant challenges to humans and ecosystems. Current warming of the Arctic, in terms of length of the summer season, is as abrupt and massive, albeit not as extensive, as the transition from the last major D-O event, the Younger Dryas into the Holocene (Mayewski et al., 2013). Tropospheric source greenhouse gas rise and ozone depletion in the stratosphere over Antarctica are triggers for the modern advent of human emission instigated ACCs. Arctic warming and Antarctic ozone depletion have resulted in significance changes to the atmospheric circulation systems that transport heat, moisture, and pollutants in both hemispheres. Climate models offer a critical tool for assessing trends, but they cannot as yet predict ACC events, as evidenced by the inability of these models to predict the rapid onset of Arctic warming and resulting changes in atmospheric circulation; and in the model vs past analog differences in projections for\n\nThe INTIMATE event stratigraphy and recommendations for its use\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRasmussen, Sune O.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe North Atlantic INTIMATE (INtegration of Ice-core, MArine and TErrestrial records) group has previously recommended an Event Stratigraphy approach for the synchronisation of records of the Last Termination using the Greenland ice core records as the regional stratotypes.

The most pronounced changes observed, beside the glacial terminations, are the Dansgaard-Oeschger events. Present day general circulation climate models simulating glacial conditions are not capable of reproducing these rapid shifts. It is thus not known if they are due to bifurcations in the structural stability of the climate or if they are induced by stochastic fluctuations. By analyzing a high resolution ice core record we exclude the bifurcation scenario, which strongly suggests that they are noise induced and thus have very limited predictability.

Controls on the magnitude and frequency of these climate perturbations, and how they may be inter-related, remain unclear. Specific problems include the difficulty of dating Heinrich sediment layers and local bias of key paleoclimate archives. We present a highly detailed and precise record of ice core methane (CH4), a globally integrated signal, which resolves climatic features in unprecedented resolution. Abrupt CH4 increases are resolved in Heinrich Stadials (HS) 1, 2, 4 and 5 where, in contrast to all D-O cycles, there are no concurrent abrupt changes in Greenland temperature. Using modern-day tropical rainfall variability as an analog, we propose that strong cooling in the North Atlantic severely restricted the northerly range of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), leading to an enhanced wet season over Southern Hemisphere tropical land areas, and consequently driving production of excess CH4 in tropical wetlands. Our findings place four Heinrich events firmly within ice core chronologies and suggest maximum durations of 778 to 1606 yr. CH4 anomalies are only associated with Heinrich events of Hudson Strait provenance, indicating that the tropical impacts of Heinrich events were not uniform.\n\nPrecise interpolar phasing of abrupt climate change during the last ice age.\n\nPubMed\n\n2015-04-30\n\nThe last glacial period exhibited abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger climatic oscillations, evidence of which is preserved in a variety of Northern Hemisphere palaeoclimate archives. Ice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the warm phases of the Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle and vice versa, suggesting an interhemispheric redistribution of heat through a mechanism called the bipolar seesaw. Variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength are thought to have been important, but much uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics and trigger of these abrupt events. Key information is contained in the relative phasing of hemispheric climate variations, yet the large, poorly constrained difference between gas age and ice age and the relatively low resolution of methane records from Antarctic ice cores have so far precluded methane-based synchronization at the required sub-centennial precision. Here we use a recently drilled high-accumulation Antarctic ice core to show that, on average, abrupt Greenland warming leads the corresponding Antarctic cooling onset by 218 Â± 92 years (2Ï) for Dansgaard-Oeschger events, including the BÃ¸lling event; Greenland cooling leads the corresponding onset of Antarctic warming by 208 Â± 96 years. Our results demonstrate a north-to-south directionality of the abrupt climatic signal, which is propagated to the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes by oceanic rather than atmospheric processes. The similar interpolar phasing of warming and cooling transitions suggests that the transfer time of the climatic signal is independent of the AMOC background state. Our findings confirm a central role for ocean circulation in the bipolar seesaw and provide clear criteria for assessing hypotheses and model simulations of Dansgaard-Oeschger dynamics.\n\nThe INTIMATE event stratigraphy of the last glacial period\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOlander Rasmussen, Sune; Svensson, Anders\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe North Atlantic INTIMATE (INtegration of Ice-core, MArine and TErrestrial records) group has previously recommended an Event Stratigraphy approach for the synchronisation of records of the Last Termination using the Greenland ice core records as the regional stratotypes.

The magnitude of Caribbean hydroclimate change associated with D-O variability and particularly with stadial intervals, remains poorly constrained by paleoclimate records. We present a 3.3 thousand-year long stalagmite Î´ 18 O record from the Yucatan Peninsula (YP) that spans the interval between 26.5 and 23.2 thousand years before present. We estimate quantitative precipitation variability and the high resolution and dating accuracy of this record allow us to investigate how rainfall in the region responds to D-O events. Quantitative precipitation estimates are based on observed regional amount effect variability, last glacial paleotemperature records, and estimates of the last glacial oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation based on global circulation models (GCMs). The new precipitation record suggests significant low latitude hydrological responses to internal modes of climate variability and supports a role of Caribbean hydroclimate in helping Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation recovery during D-O events. Significant in-phase precipitation reduction across the equator in the tropical Americas associated with Heinrich event 2 is suggested by available speleothem oxygen isotope records.\n\nNatural periodicities and Northern Hemisphere-Southern Hemisphere connection of temperature changes during the last glacial period: EPICA and NGRIP data sets revisited\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlberti, Tommaso; Lepreti, Fabio; Vecchio, Antonio; Bevacqua, Emanuele; Capparelli, Vincenzo; Carbone, Vincenzo\n\n2015-04-01\n\nWe investigate both the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica Dronning Maud Land (EDML) and North Greenland Ice-Core Project (NGRIP) Î´18O data sets to study both the time evolution of the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger events and the dynamics at longer timescales during the last glacial period, considering the interval 20 - 120 kyr B.P., since this is the interval in which significant temperature changes, that are the focus of the present work, are observed. To identify the main periodicities and their amplitudes, we applied the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), a technique designed to investigate non-stationary data, by which both the Î´18O time series are decomposed into a finite number m of oscillating intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) as 18 mÎ£-1 Î´ O = Cj(t)+ rm(t) j=0 (1) where Cj(t) are the IMFs and rm(t) is a residue which provides the mean trend. We extract the proper modes of both the data sets confirming that natural cycles of abrupt climate changes exist and their occurrence cannot be due to random fluctuations in time. It is shown that the time behavior at the typical timescales of Dansgaard-Oeschger events is captured through signal reconstructions obtained by summing five EMD modes for NGRIP and four EMD modes for EDML. The reconstructions obtained by summing the successive modes can be used to describe the climate evolution at longer timescales, characterized by intervals in which Dansgaard-Oeschger events happen and intervals when these are not observed. Using EMD signal reconstructions and a simple model based on the one-dimensional Langevin equation, it is argued that the occurrence of a Dansgaard-Oeschger event can be described as an excitation of the climate system within the same state, while the longer timescale behavior appears to be due to transitions between different climate states.

L.; Rull, V.; Giralt, S.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nMarine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3, 59.4-27.8 kyr BP) is characterized by the occurrence of rapid millennial-scale climate oscillations known as Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles (DO) and by abrupt cooling events in the North Atlantic known as Heinrich events. Although both the timing and dynamics of these events have been broadly explored in North Atlantic records, the response of the tropical and subtropical latitudes to these rapid climatic excursions, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, still remains unclear. The Rano Aroi peat record (Easter Island, 27Â° S) provides a unique opportunity to understand atmospheric and oceanic changes in the South Pacific during these DO cycles because of its singular location, which is influenced by the South Pacific Anticyclone (SPA), the Southern Westerlies (SW), and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) linked to the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). The Rano Aroi sequence records 6 major events of enhanced precipitation between 38 and 65 kyr BP. These events are compared with other hydrological records from the tropical and subtropical band supporting a coherent regional picture, with the dominance of humid conditions in Southern Hemisphere tropical band during Heinrich Stadials (HS) 5, 5a and 6 and other Stadials while dry conditions prevailed in the Northern tropics. This antiphased hydrological pattern between hemispheres has been attributed to ITCZ migration, which in turn might be associated with an eastward expansion of the SPCZ storm track, leading to an increased intensity of cyclogenic storms reaching Easter Island. Low Pacific Sea Surface Temperature (SST) gradients across the Equator were coincident with the here-defined Rano Aroi humid events and consistent with a reorganization of Southern Pacific atmospheric and oceanic circulation also at higher latitudes during Heinrich and Dansgaard-Oeschger stadials.\n\nA stratigraphic framework for abrupt climatic changes during the Last Glacial period based on three synchronized Greenland ice-core records: refining and extending the INTIMATE event stratigraphy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRasmussen, Sune O.; Bigler, Matthias; Blockley, Simon P.; Blunier, Thomas; Buchardt, Susanne L.; Clausen, Henrik B.; Cvijanovic, Ivana; Dahl-Jensen, Dorthe; Johnsen, Sigfus J.; Fischer, Hubertus; Gkinis, Vasileios; Guillevic, Myriam; Hoek, Wim Z.; Lowe, J.

As part of the INTIMATE (INTegration of Ice-core, MArine and TErrestrial records) project, protocols have been proposed to ensure consistent and robust correlation between different records of past climate. A key element of these protocols has been the formal definition and ordinal numbering of the sequence of Greenland Stadials (GS) and Greenland Interstadials (GI) within the most recent glacial period. The GS and GI periods are the Greenland expressions of the characteristic Dansgaard-Oeschger events that represent cold and warm phases of the North Atlantic region, respectively. We present here a more detailed and extended GS/GI template for the whole of the Last Glacial period. It is based on a synchronization of the NGRIP, GRIP, and GISP2 ice-core records that allows the parallel analysis of all three records on a common time scale. The boundaries of the GS and GI periods are defined based on a combination of stable-oxygen isotope ratios of the ice (Î´18O, reflecting mainly local temperature) and calcium ion concentrations (reflecting mainly atmospheric dust loading) measured in the ice. The data not only resolve the well-known sequence of Dansgaard-Oeschger events that were first defined and numbered in the ice-core records more than two decades ago, but also better resolve a number of short-lived climatic oscillations, some defined here for the first time. Using this revised scheme, we propose a consistent approach for discriminating and naming all the significant abrupt climatic events of the Last Glacial period that are represented in the Greenland ice records. The final product constitutes an extended and better resolved Greenland stratotype sequence, against which other proxy records can be compared and correlated.

H.; Blunier, T.; Maselli, O. J.; McConnell, J. R.; Romanini, D.; Severinghaus, J. P.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe drivers of abrupt climate change during the Last Glacial Period are not well understood. While Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) cycles are thought to be linked to variations in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation (AMOC), it is not clear how or if Heinrich Eventsâextensive influxes of icebergs into the North Atlantic Ocean that impacted global climate and biogeochemistryâare related. An enduring problem is the difficultly in dating iceberg rafted debris deposits that typically lack foraminifera. Here we present an ultra-high resolution record of methane from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core at unprecedented, continuous temporal resolution from 67.2-9.8 ka BP, which we propose constrains the timing of Heinrich events. Our methane record essentially mirrors Greenland ice core stable isotope variability across D-O events, except during Heinrich stadials 1, 2, 4 and 5. Partway through these stadials only, methane increases abruptly and rapidly, as at the onset of a D-O event but Greenland temperature exhibits no equivalent response. Speleothem records exhibit signatures of drought in the Northern extra-tropics and intensified monsoonal activity over South America at these times. We use a simple heuristic model to propose that cold air temperatures and extensive sea ice in the North, resulting from Heinrich events, caused extreme reorganization of tropical hydroclimate. This involved curtailment of the seasonal northerly migration of tropical rain belts, leading to intensification of rainfall over Southern Hemisphere tropical wetlands, thus allowing production of excess methane relative to a 'normal' Greenland stadial. We note that this mechanism can operate if AMOC is already in a slowed state when a Heinrich event occurs, as paleo-evidence suggests it was. Heinrich events and associated sea ice cover would therefore act to prolong the duration of this AMOC state.

During this interval, Mono Lake experienced four lowstands each lasting from 1000 to 2000 yr. The youngest lowstand, which occurred between 15,500 and 14,000 14C yr B.P., was nearly synchronous with a desiccation of Owens Lake, California. Paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) data indicate that three of four persistent lowstands occurred at the same times as Heinrich events H1, H2, and H4. 18O data indicate the two highest lake levels occurred Ë18,000 and Ë13,100 14C yr B.P., corresponding to passages of the mean position of the polar jet stream over the Mono Basin.

The timing of our multi-proxy geochemical dataset is coeval with D-O interstadials (15-18) and stadials, including Heinrich Event 6. The McLean's Cave stalagmite indicates warmer and drier conditions during Greenland interstadials (GISs 15-18), signified by elevated Î´18O, Î´13C, reflectance, and trace element concentrations, and less radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr. Our record extends evidence of a strong linkage between high-latitude warming and reduced precipitation in western North America to early MIS 3 and MIS 4.

K.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nNine stalagmites collected from various depths of a submerged cave system on the island of Abaco, Bahamas comprise a continuous record of oxygen isotopic variation between 7.3 to 63kyr. The depths from which the speleothems were collected range from 12m to 37m. The youngest age of the speleothems reflect the inundation of the cave system by rising sea level. Millennial scale rapid climate change events can be seen in the Î´18O record of the Bahamian stalagmites as Heinrich Stadials H0 to H6 and Dansgaard Oeschger Events. This collection of stalagmites represents different depths in a cave in Abaco, and their collective geochemical record reflects the global climatic effects as experienced locally in the subtropical islands of the Bahamas. Separately, various stalagmites that grew during the same time periods reflect similar patterns in the Î´18O values of their calcite mineralogy despite having been located at vastly different depth elevations relative to each other. In general, the average Î´18O value for the stalagmites collected from this cave is -2.5â° VPDB with a maximum and minimum Î´18O value between 0.5 â° and -5.5â° VPDB respectively during Heinrich stadials and D/O events. In addition to Î´18O values measured in these stalagmites, ratios of Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca, and Ba/Ca are also compared with one another. This study attempts to elucidate differences, if any, that locations in a cave relative to sea level would have on recording the true climate signals of a region. Finally, results from this study are compared with stalagmites collected from Eleuthera, another Bahamian island with speleothems younger than those from Abaco in order to create a mostly continuous record of rapid climate change events dating back from present day to 63,000 years.\n\nGlacial greenhouse-gas fluctuations controlled by ocean circulation changes.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmittner, Andreas; Galbraith, Eric D\n\n2008-11-20\n\nEarth's climate and the concentrations of the atmospheric greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) varied strongly on millennial timescales during past glacial periods. Large and rapid warming events in Greenland and the North Atlantic were followed by more gradual cooling, and are highly correlated with fluctuations of N(2)O as recorded in ice cores. Antarctic temperature variations, on the other hand, were smaller and more gradual, showed warming during the Greenland cold phase and cooling while the North Atlantic was warm, and were highly correlated with fluctuations in CO(2). Abrupt changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) have often been invoked to explain the physical characteristics of these Dansgaard-Oeschger climate oscillations, but the mechanisms for the greenhouse-gas variations and their linkage to the AMOC have remained unclear. Here we present simulations with a coupled model of glacial climate and biogeochemical cycles, forced only with changes in the AMOC. The model simultaneously reproduces characteristic features of the Dansgaard-Oeschger temperature, as well as CO(2) and N(2)O fluctuations. Despite significant changes in the land carbon inventory, CO(2) variations on millennial timescales are dominated by slow changes in the deep ocean inventory of biologically sequestered carbon and are correlated with Antarctic temperature and Southern Ocean stratification. In contrast, N(2)O co-varies more rapidly with Greenland temperatures owing to fast adjustments of the thermocline oxygen budget. These results suggest that ocean circulation changes were the primary mechanism that drove glacial CO(2) and N(2)O fluctuations on millennial timescales.\n\nCorrelation of Late-Pleistocene Lake-Level Oscillations in Mono Lake, California, with North Atlantic Climate Events\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBenson, L.V.; Lund, S.P.; Burdett, J.W.; Kashgarian, Michaele; Rose, T.P.; Smoot, J.P.; Schwartz, M.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nOxygen-18 (18O) values of sediment from the Wilson Creek Formation, Mono Basin, California, indicate three scales of temporal variation (Dansgaard-Oeschger, Heinrich, and Milankovitch) in the hydrologic balance of Mono Lake between 35,400 and 12,900 14C yr B.P. During this interval, Mono Lake experienced four lowstands each lasting from 1000 to 2000 yr. The youngest low-stand, which occurred between 15,500 and 14,000 14C yr B.P., was nearly synchronous with a desiccation of Owens Lake, California. Paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) data indicate that three of four persistent lowstands occurred at the same times as Heinrich events H1, H2, and H4. 18O data indicate the two highest lake levels occurred ???18,000 and ???13,100 14C yr B.P., corresponding to passages of the mean position of the polar jet stream over the Mono Basin. Extremely low values of total inorganic carbon between 26,000 and 14,000 14C yr B.P. indicate glacial activity, corresponding to a time when summer insolation was much reduced. ?? 1998 University of Washington.\n\nTo what extent can global warming events influence scaling properties of climatic fluctuations in glacial periods?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlberti, Tommaso; Lepreti, Fabio; Vecchio, Antonio; Carbone, Vincenzo\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Earth's climate is an extremely unstable complex system consisting of nonlinear and still rather unknown interactions among atmosphere, land surface, ice and oceans. The system is mainly driven by solar irradiance, even if internal components as volcanic eruptions and human activities affect the atmospheric composition thus acting as a driver for climate changes. Since the extreme climate variability is the result of a set of phenomena operating from daily to multi-millennial timescales, with different correlation times, a study of the scaling properties of the system can evidence non-trivial persistent structures, internal or external physical processes. Recently, the scaling properties of the paleoclimate changes have been analyzed by distinguish between interglacial and glacial climates [Shao and Ditlevsen, 2016]. The results show that the last glacial record (20-120 kyr BP) presents some elements of multifractality, while the last interglacial period (0-10 kyr BP), say the Holocene period, seems to be characterized by a mono-fractal structure. This is associated to the absence of Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events in the interglacial climate that could be the cause for the absence of multifractality. This hypothesis is supported by the analysis of the period between 18 and 27 kyr BP, i.e. during the Last Glacial Period, in which a single DO event have been registred. Through the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) we were able to detect a timescale separation within the Last Glacial Period (20-120 kyr BP) in two main components: a high-frequency component, related to the occurrence of DO events, and a low-frequency one, associated to the cooling/warming phase switch [Alberti et al., 2014]. Here, we investigate the scaling properties of the climate fluctuations within the Last Glacial Period, where abrupt climate changes, characterized by fast increase of temperature usually called Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, have been particularly pronounced. By using the\n\nAbrupt climatic events recorded by the Ili loess during the last glaciation in Central Asia: Evidence from grain-size and minerals\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSong, Yougui; Zeng, Mengxiu; Chen, Xiuling; Li, Yue; Chang, Hong; An, Zhisheng; Guo, Xiaohua\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe loess record of Central Asia provides an important archive of regional climate and environmental changes. In contrast to the widely investigated loess deposits in the Chinese Loess Plateau, Central Asian loess-paleosol sequences remain poorly understood. Here, we present an aeolian loess section in the southern Ili Basin. Based on granularity and mineralogical analyses, we reconstruct climatic changes during the last glaciation. The results indicated that most of the abrupt climatic events (such as Dansgaard-Oeschger events and Heinrich events) were imprinted in this loess section, although their amplitudes and ages showed some differences. Compared with the millennial oscillations recoded in loess and stalagmites in East Asia, the arid Central Asia responded more sensitively to the warming events than to the cooling events. The shifting trajectory of westerlies across Central Asia played an important role in dust deposition during the stadials. The North Atlantic climatic signals may have been transmitted from Central Asia to the East Asian monsoon regions via the westerlies.\n\nA stratigraphic framework for naming and robust correlation of abrupt climatic changes during the last glacial period based on three synchronized Greenland ice core records\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRasmussen, Sune O.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nDue to their outstanding resolution and well-constrained chronologies, Greenland ice core records have long been used as a master record of past climatic changes during the last interglacial-glacial cycle in the North Atlantic region. As part of the INTIMATE (INtegration of Ice-core, MArine and TErrestrial records) project, protocols have been proposed to ensure consistent and robust correlation between different records of past climate. A key element of these protocols has been the formal definition of numbered Greenland Stadials (GS) and Greenland Interstadials (GI) within the past glacial period as the Greenland expressions of the characteristic Dansgaard-Oeschger events that represent cold and warm phases of the North Atlantic region, respectively. Using a recent synchronization of the NGRIP, GRIP, and GISP2 ice cores that allows the parallel analysis of all three records on a common time scale, we here present an extension of the GS/GI stratigraphic template to the entire glacial period. This is based on a combination of isotope ratios (Î´18O, reflecting mainly local temperature) and calcium concentrations (reflecting mainly atmospheric dust loading). In addition to the well-known sequence of Dansgaard-Oeschger events that were first defined and numbered in the ice core records more than two decades ago, a number of short-lived climatic oscillations have been identified in the three synchronized records. Some of these events have been observed in other studies, but we here propose a consistent scheme for discriminating and naming all the significant climatic events of the last glacial period that are represented in the Greenland ice cores. This is a key step aimed at promoting unambiguous comparison and correlation between different proxy records, as well as a more secure basis for investigating the dynamics and fundamental causes of these climatic perturbations.

M.; Huntley, B.\n\nA high-resolution palynological study of a 51 m core from Lago Grande di Monticchio, southern Italy, has provided a palaeonvironmental record for the last glacill. A annual lamination based chronology, supported by radiometric and tephrochronological dates, provides an absolute timescale for this record that spans 76,300 years. Correlations are established between the pollen stratigraphy, the GRIP ice core Î´18O record and foraminiferal assemblages from Atlantic core V23-81. Both Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events are reflected by changes in the pollen stratigraphy. Revised dates are estimated for Heinrich events H1-H6. A quantitative palaeoclimate reconstruction based upon the pollen data provides evidence of the climate changes in southern Italy associated with these and other fluctuations during the last glacial.\n\nEnhanced aridity and atmospheric high-pressure stability over the western Mediterranean during the North Atlantic cold events of the past 50 k.y.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCombourieu Nebout, N.; Turon, J. L.; Zahn, R.; Capotondi, L.; Londeix, L.; Pahnke, K.\n\n2002-10-01\n\nMultiproxy paleoenvironmental records (pollen and planktonic isotope) from Ocean Drilling Program Site 976 (Alboran Sea) document rapid ocean and climate variations during the last glacial that follow the Dansgaard-Oeschger climate oscillations seen in the Greenland ice core records, thus suggesting a close link of the Mediterranean climate swings with North Atlantic climates. Continental conditions rapidly oscillated through cold-arid and warm-wet conditions in the course of stadial-interstadial climate jumps. At the time of Heinrich events, i.e., maximum meltwater flux to the North Atlantic, western Mediterranean marine microflora and microfauna show rapid cooling correlated with increasing continental dryness. Enhanced aridity conceivably points to prolonged wintertime stability of atmospheric high-pressure systems over the southwestern Mediterranean in conjunction with cooling of the North Atlantic.\n\nEvidence of Methane Outgassing During MIS3 in the Bering Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCook, M. S.; Keigwin, L. D.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nThere are multiple negative excursions in planktonic and benthic foraminifer Î´13C in a core from 1467m in the southeast Bering Sea. These excursions occur episodically during the last glacial period, and may coincide with Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events. Measured foraminifer Î´13C during the excursions is as low as -14â° and are probably the result of overgrowths of diagenetic calcium carbonate. We estimate overgrowth Î´13C is -23â°, and hypothesize that the occurrence of overgrowths is associated with anaerobic oxidation of biogenic methane. The likely pressure and temperature conditions at this site and during the last glacial period were well within the zone of methane-hydrate stability, so the source of methane is probably not from destabilization of methane hydrate at this depth. The methane may have originated from increased in-situ methanogenesis resulting from greater burial of organic carbon, or from destabilization of methane hydrate at shallower sites near the methane-hydrate stability threshold. Both these scenarios could be active, consistent with the ``Clathrate Gun Hypothesis'' (Kennett et al., 2003), in which there is widespread destabilization of marine methane hydrates during D-O events, where methane gas both is oxidized within the water column and escapes to the atmosphere.\n\nTemperature and seawater isotopic controls on two stalagmite records since 83 ka from maritime Japan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMori, Taiki; Kashiwagi, Kenji; Amekawa, Shota; Kato, Hirokazu; Okumura, Tomoyo; Takashima, Chiduru; Wu, Chung-Che; Shen, Chuan-Chou; Quade, Jay; Kano, Akihiro\n\n2018-07-01\n\nMillennial-scale interstadial Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles and Heinrich (H) stadial events are pronounced paleoclimatic features during the last glacial period, which were first demonstrated in the North Atlantic region. These stadial and interstadial events are expressed in marine and terrestrial high-resolution records elsewhere in the world, but the magnitude and mode of the regional climate changes are still poorly quantified. Here we present new replicated stalagmite Î´18O profiles from two caves in central Japan, which extend back to 83.4 ka. The records clearly display the H7 to H3 events, but not D-O cycles. An important feature of the two Japanese stalagmites is the small difference (â¼2.9â°) in Î´18O values between the mid-Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Long-term trends of the stalagmite Î´18O values at the more maritime site generally follow that of the Î´18O record of seawater, which is responsible for â¼1.1â° of the â¼2.9â° difference between mid-Holocene and LGM. The remaining 1.8â° in the difference can be accounted for by +9 Â°C of warming between the LGM and mid-Holocene and -3 Â°C cooling at H events, which are comparable with the previous estimates of land paleo-temperature in the Japanese Islands. The attenuated isotopic signal associated with D-O interstadials indicates that the warming in the Atlantic did not significantly transfer to the maritime Japan. These unique features of the isotopic records of the Japanese stalagmites are due to the geographic position at the vicinity of the moisture source, Kuroshio warm current.\n\nVariations in productivity and eolian fluxes in the northeastern Arabian Sea during the past 110 ka\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPourmand, Ali; Marcantonio, Franco; Schulz, Hartmut\n\n2004-04-01\n\nHigh-resolution (one to two samples/ka) radionuclide proxy records from core 93KL in the northeastern Arabian Sea provide evidence for millennial climate variability over the past 110 ka. We interpret 230Th-normalized 232Th fluxes as a proxy for eolian input, and authigenic uranium concentrations as a proxy for past productivity. We attribute orbital and suborbital variations in both proxies to changes in the intensity of the southwest Indian Ocean monsoon. The highest 230Th-normalized 232Th fluxes occur at times that are consistent with the timing of the Younger Dryas, Heinrich events 1-7 and cold Dansgaard-Oeschger stadial events recorded in the GISP2 ice core. Such high dust fluxes may be due to a weakened southwest monsoon in conjunction with strengthened northwesterlies from the Arabian Peninsula and Mesopotamia. Authigenic uranium concentrations, on the other hand, are highest during warm Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadials when the southwest monsoon is intensified relative to the northwesterly winds. Our results also indicate that on orbital timescales maximum average eolian fluxes coincide with the timing of marine isotopic stage (MIS) 2 and 4, while minimum fluxes occur during MIS 1, 3 and 5. Although the forcing mechanism(s) controlling suborbital variabilities in monsoonal intensity is still debated, our findings suggest an atmospheric teleconnection between the low-latitude southwest monsoon and North Atlantic climate.\n\nMillennial-scale variability in vegetation records from the East Asian Islands: Taiwan, Japan and Sakhalin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTakahara, Hikaru; Igarashi, Yaeko; Hayashi, Ryoma; Kumon, Fujio; Liew, Ping-Mei; Yamamoto, Masanobu; Kawai, Sayuri; Oba, Tadamichi; Irino, Tomohisa\n\n2010-10-01\n\nHigh-resolution pollen records from Taiwan, Japan and Sakhalin document regional vegetation changes during Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles during the last glacial. During the period from the cold phase (GS 18/19) to warm phase (D-O 19), the biome shift from temperate conifer forest to cold/cool conifer forest in Japan and from subtropical forest to temperate deciduous/conifer forest in Taiwan. The vegetation in D-O 17, cool mixed forest in central Japan, temperate deciduous broadleaf forest in western Japan and subtropical forest in Taiwan, indicates warm condition but not wet in all area. These vegetation changes lead to biome shift from MIS (Marine Isotope Stage) 4 to MIS 3. The abundance of Cryptomeria japonica and Fagus crenata in D-O 12 and D-O 8 indicates wet conditions brought by the strong summer monsoon through the Islands and high snowfall brought by the inflow of the Tsushima Warm Current into the Sea of Japan. The registration of other D-O warming events in MIS 3, although reflected by shifts in the abundance of key species, is not sufficient to produce changes in biomes. Development of cold deciduous forest in HS (Heinrich events) 1 in Sakhalin, Hokkaido and central Japan was conspicuous and was much larger than that in YD. Vegetation response in YD was small scale and within the same biome in the East Asian Islands. In D-O 1 at the termination of the last glacial, the same taxa that developed in the early Holocene, cold evergreen needleleaf trees in northern region, temperate deciduous broadleaf trees in central and western Japan, and warm-temperate evergreen trees in Taiwan, increased.\n\nInvestigating the Influence of Climate Changes on Rodent Communities at a Regional-Scale (MIS 1-3, Southwestern France)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRoyer, AurÃ©lien; Montuire, Sophie; Legendre, Serge; Discamps, Emmanuel; Jeannet, Marcel; LÃ©cuyer, Christophe\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTerrestrial ecosystems have continuously evolved throughout the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene, deeply affected by both progressive environmental and climatic modifications, as well as by abrupt and large climatic changes such as the Heinrich or Dansgaard-Oeschger events. Yet, the impacts of these different events on terrestrial mammalian communities are poorly known, as is the role played by potential refugia on geographical species distributions. This study examines community changes in rodents of southwestern France between 50 and 10 ky BP by integrating 94 dated faunal assemblages coming from 37 archaeological sites. This work reveals that faunal distributions were modified in response to abrupt and brief climatic events, such as Heinrich events, without actually modifying the rodent community on a regional scale. However, the succession of events which operated between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene gradually led to establishing a new rodent community at the regional scale, with intermediate communities occurring between the BÃ¸lling and the AllerÃ¸d.

Records from ecosystems such as the Amazon rainforest, savanna, Caatinga, Atlantic rainforest, Araucaria forest and grasslands provide interesting insight of past climate variability. The influence of events such as Dansgaard-Oeschger, Heinnrich stadials, changes in the thermohaline circulation (THC) will be discussed. In particular the Younger Dryas (YD) period shows at different places distinct vegetational changes, revealing unexpected past climatic conditions.\n\nTropical North Atlantic subsurface warming events as a fingerprint for AMOC variability during Marine Isotope Stage 3\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nParker, Andrew O.; Schmidt, Matthew W.; Chang, Ping\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThe role of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) as the driver of Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) variability that characterized Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) has long been hypothesized. Although there is ample proxy evidence suggesting that DO events were robust features of glacial climate, there is little data supporting a link with AMOC. Recently, modeling studies and subsurface temperature reconstructions have suggested that subsurface warming across the tropical North Atlantic can be used to fingerprint a weakened AMOC during the deglacial because a reduction in the strength of the western boundary current allows warm salinity maximum water of the subtropical gyre to enter the deep tropics. To determine if AMOC variability played a role during the DO cycles of MIS 3, we present new, high-resolution Mg/Ca and Î´18O records spanning 24-52 kyr from the near-surface dwelling planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber and the lower thermocline dwelling planktonic foraminifera Globorotalia truncatulinoides in Southern Caribbean core VM12-107 (11.33Â°N, 66.63Â°W, 1079 m depth). Our subsurface Mg/Ca record reveals abrupt increases in Mg/Ca ratios (the largest equal to a 4Â°C warming) during the interstadial-stadial transition of most DO events during this period. This change is consistent with reconstructions of subsurface warming events associated with cold events across the deglacial using the same core. Additionally, our data support the conclusion reached by a recently published study from the Florida Straits that AMOC did not undergo significant reductions during Heinrich events 2 and 3. This record presents some of the first high-resolution marine sediment derived evidence for variable AMOC during MIS 3.\n\nBasin-wide Millennial Cycles in Arabian Sea Climate Over the Last Glacial\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPourmand, A.; Marcantonio, F.\n\n2005-05-01\n\nHigh-frequency Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) and Heinrich cycles first discovered in the records of North Atlantic ice and marine sediments have been found to extend beyond the North Atlantic There is ample evidence for these millennial cycles of climate variability in the sediments of the Arabian Sea. We employ uranium-series radionuclide proxies to determine changes in the fluxes of sedimentary components in two cores from the western (W) and northeastern (NE) Arabian Sea in order to investigate fluctuations of export production and wind strength on a large regional scale during the last glacial period. In the NE Arabian Sea off of the Pakistani margin, 230Th-derived detrital (eolian) fluxes are highest during periods consistent with the timing of North Atlantic D-O stadial and H 1-7 events. Authigenic uranium concentrations, which we interpret as a proxy for primary productivity, also show an increase during North Atlantic D-O interstadials. Preliminary results from W Arabian Sea sediments off of the Oman margin corroborate that these millennial cycles in productivity and eolian fluxes are indeed basin-wide events. Authigenic U concentrations in these sediments are, on average, about twice those measured in the NE Arabian Sea, suggesting, qualitatively, an enhancement of primary productivity in the western part of the basin. In contrast, fluxes of eolian material to the Oman margin are, on average, more than 10 times lower than those delivered to the Pakistani margin, even though the patterns of millennial variability are virtually identical. We associate enhanced export production and a decreased eolian input during relatively warmer D-O interstadials with an intensification of southwest monsoonal winds. Similarly, decreased export production is coincident with an increase in eolian fluxes during North Atlantic stadial and H events. These results provide strong evidence for a basin-wide atmospheric teleconnection between Arabian Sea and North Atlantic climate on sub\n\nMillennial-scale variability during the last glacial in vegetation records from North America\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nJimÃ©nez-Moreno, Gonzalo; Anderson, R.

In the western, more mountainous regions, these climate changes are generally observed in the pollen records as altitudinal movements of climate-sensitive plant species, whereas in the southeast, they are recorded as latitudinal shifts in vegetation. Heinrich (HS) and Greenland (GS) stadials are generally correlated with cold and dry climate and Greenland interstadials (GI) with warm-wet phases. The pollen records from North America confirm that vegetation responds rapidly to millennial-scale climate variability, although the difficulties in establishing independent age models for the pollen records make determination of the absolute phasing of the records to surface temperatures in Greenland somewhat uncertain. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.\n\nCarbon and hydrogen isotope composition of plant biomarkers as proxies for precipitation changes across Heinrich Events in the subtropics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArnold, T. E.; Freeman, K.; Brenner, M.; Diefendorf, A. F.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nLake Tulane is a relatively deep (~23 m) solution lake in south-central Florida. Its depth and location on a structural high, the Lake Wales Ridge, enabled continuous lacustrine sediment accumulation over the past >60,000 years. Pollen in the lake sediments indicate repeated major shifts in the vegetation community, with six peaks in Pinus (pine) abundance that coincide with the most intense cold phases of Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles and the Heinrich events that terminate them. Alternating with Pinus peaks are zones with high relative percentages of Quercus (oak), Ambrosia (ragweed), Lyonia (staggerbush) and Ceratiola (rosemary) pollen, genera that today occupy the most xeric sites on the Florida landscape. This suggests the pollen record indicates the Pinus phases, and therefore Heinrich Events, were wetter than the intervening Quercus phases. To test the connection between Heinrich Events and precipitation in Florida, we analyzed the carbon (Î´13C) and hydrogen (Î´D) isotope signatures of plant biomarkers extracted from the Lake Tulane sediment core as proxies of paleohydrology. The Î´13C of plant biomarkers, such as n-alkanes and terpenoids, are determined, in part, by changes in water-use efficiency (WUE = Assimilation/Transpiration) in plant communities, which changes in response to shifts in mean annual precipitation. Plant Î´13C values can, therefore, provide a rough indication of precipitation changes when other factors, such as plant community, are relatively stable throughout time. Paleohydrology is also recorded in the Î´D of plant leaf waxes, which are strongly controlled by precipitation Î´D. In this region, precipitation Î´D is negatively correlated with rainfall amount (i.e. the \"amount\" effect) and positively correlated with aridity. Thus, the Î´13C and Î´D signatures of molecular plant biomarkers provide relative indicators of precipitation change, and when combined, provide a test of our hypothesis that vegetation changes in this region are driven\n\nDansgaard-Oeschger cycles observed in the Greenland ReCAP ice core project\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKjÃ¦r, Helle Astrid; Vallelonga, Paul; Vinther, Bo; Simonsen, Marius; Maffezzoli, NiccolÃ³; Gkinis, Vasileios; Svensson, Anders; Jensen, Camilla Marie; Dallmayr, Remi; Spolaor, Andrea; Edwards, Ross\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe new REnland ice CAP (RECAP) ice core was drilled in summer 2015 in Greenland and measured by means of Continuous flow analysis (CFA) during the last 3 months of 2015. The Renland ice core was obtained as part of the ReCAP project, extending 584.11 meters to the bottom of the Renland ice cap located in east Greenland. The unique position on a mountain saddle above 2000 meters altitude, but close to the coast, ensures that the Renland ice core offers high accumulation, but also reaches far back in time. Results show that despite the short length the RECAP ice core holds ice all the way back to the past warm interglacial period, the Eemian. The glacial section is strongly thinned and covers on 20 meters of the ReCAP core, but nonetheless due to the high resolution of the measurements all 25 expected DO events could be identified. The record was analyzed for multiple elements including the water isotopes, forest fire tracers NH4+ and black carbon, insoluble dust particles by means of Abakus laser particle counter and the dust ion Ca2+, sea salt Na+, and sea ice proxies as well as acidity useful for finding volcanic layers to date the core. Below the glacial section another 20 meters of warm Eemian ice have been analysed. Here we present the chemistry results as obtained by continuous flow analysis (CFA) and compare the glacial section with the chemistry profile from other Greenland ice cores.\n\nUnstable AMOC during glacial intervals and millennial variability: The role of mean sea ice extent\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSÃ©vellec, Florian; Fedorov, Alexey V.\n\n2015-11-01\n\nA striking feature of paleoclimate records is the greater stability of the Holocene epoch relative to the preceding glacial interval, especially apparent in the North Atlantic region. In particular, strong irregular variability with an approximately 1500 yr period, known as the Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, punctuates the last glaciation, but is absent during the interglacial. Prevailing theories, modeling and data suggest that these events, seen as abrupt warming episodes in Greenland ice cores and sea surface temperature records in the North Atlantic, are linked to reorganizations of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In this study, using a new low-order ocean model that reproduces a realistic power spectrum of millennial variability, we explore differences in the AMOC stability between glacial and interglacial intervals of the 100 kyr glacial cycle of the Late Pleistocene (1 kyr = 1000 yr). Previous modeling studies show that the edge of sea ice in the North Atlantic shifts southward during glacial intervals, moving the region of the North Atlantic Deep Water formation and the AMOC also southward. Here we demonstrate that, by shifting the AMOC with respect to the mean atmospheric precipitation field, such a displacement makes the system unstable, which explains chaotic millennial variability during the glacials and the persistence of stable ocean conditions during the interglacials.\n\nPeriodic fluctuations in deep water formation due to sea ice\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaha, R.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nDuring the last ice age, several abrupt warming events took place, known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events. Their effects were felt globally, although the North Atlantic experienced the largest temperature increase. The leading hypothesis to explain their occurrence postulates that the warming was caused by abrupt disruptions of the North Atlantic Current due to meltwater discharge from destabilized ice sheets (Heinrich events). However, the number of warming events outnumber the those of ice-sheet collapse. Thus, the majority of D-O events are not attributed to surface freshwater anomalies, and the underlying mechanism behind their occurrence remain unexplained. Using a simple dynamical model of sea ice and an overturning circulation, I show the existence of self-sustained relaxation oscillations in the overturning circulation. The insulating effect of sea ice is shown to paradoxically lead to a net loss of heat from the top layer of the polar ocean when sea ice retreats. Repeated heat loss results in a denser top layer and a destabilized water column, which triggers convection. The convective state pulls the system out of its preferred mode of circulation, setting up relaxation oscillations. The period of oscillations in this case is linked to the geometry of the ocean basin, if solar forcing is assumed to remain constant. If appropriate glacial freshwater forcing is applied to the model, a pattern of oscillation is produced that bears remarkable similarity to the observed fluctuations in North Atlantic climate between 50,000 and 30,000 years before present.; Comparison of NGRIP Î´ 18-O (proxy for near surface air temperature) between 50,000 and 30,000 years before present, showing Bond cycles (left) with the model output when forced with appropriate glacial freshwater forcing (right).\n\nEnvironmental magnetic record and paleosecular variation data for the last 40 kyrs from the Lake Biwa sediments, Central Japan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHayashida, Akira; Ali, Mohammed; Kuniko, Yoshiki; Kitagawa, Hiroyuki; Torii, Masayuki; Takemura, Keiji\n\n2007-07-01\n\nWe have conducted paleomagnetic and environmental magnetic analysis of a sediment piston core recovered from Lake Biwa, central Japan.
