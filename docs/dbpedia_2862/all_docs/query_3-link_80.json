        "meta_description": "nal, postmarket registry medical record review (October 2020 through March 2022). The primary effectiveness outcome was treatment success, defined as bleeding control after insertion with no treatment escalation or bleeding recurrence. Additional outcomes included blood loss, time to device insertion, indwelling time, bleeding recurrence, and time to bleeding control. Treatment success and severe maternal morbidity measures (transfusion of 4 or more units of red blood cell, intensive care unit admission, and hysterectomy) were evaluated by blood loss before insertion. To assess safety, serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse device effects were collected. All outcomes were summarized by mode of delivery; treatment success was summarized by bleeding cause (all causes, any atony, isolated atony, nonatony).\r\r\nRESULTS: \r\r\nIn total, 800 individuals (530 vaginal births, 270 cesarean births) were treated with the device; 94.3% had uterine atony (alone or in combination with other causes). Median total blood loss at device insertion was 1,050 mL in vaginal births and 1,600 mL in cesarean births. Across all bleeding causes, the treatment success rate was 92.5% for vaginal births and was 83.7% for cesarean births (95.8% [n=307] and 88.2% [n=220], respectively, in isolated atony). Median indwelling time was 3.1 hours and 4.6 hours, respectively. In vaginal births, 14 SAEs were reported among 13 individuals (2.5%). In cesarean births, 22 SAEs were reported among 21 individuals (7.8%). Three (0.4%) SAEs were deemed possibly related to the device or procedure. No uterine perforations or deaths were reported.\r\r\nCONCLUSION: \r\r\nFor both vaginal and cesarean births in real-world settings, rapid and effective bleeding control was achieved with an FDA-cleared intrauterine vacuum-induced hemorrhage-control device. The safety profile was consistent with that observed in the registrational trial (NCT02883673), and SAEs or adverse device effects were of the nature and severity expected in the setting of PPH. This device is an important new tool for managing a life-threatening condition, and timely utilization may help to improve obstetric hemorrhage outcomes.\r\r\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: \r\r\nClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04995887....",

        "text": "Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) causes 70,000 maternal deaths globally per year and causes 12% of maternal deaths in the United States (2017–2019).1,2 Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) rates have increased in the United States, with PPH as the most common cause (2.7% in 2000, 4.3% in 2019).3–7 Morbidity and mortality related to PPH often are deemed preventable with timely recognition and treatment, leading to development of national patient safety bundles that outline standards for PPH readiness, prevention, recognition, and response.8 Despite these efforts, the rise in PPH-associated morbidity highlights an unmet need for innovative treatment options to effectively manage PPH and prevent SMM.\n\nOnce abnormal bleeding or PPH is recognized, options for management include uterotonics (eg, carboprost, methergine, misoprostol) and an antifibrinolytic agent (tranexamic acid), mechanical device placement, or surgical intervention.9–12 Once bleeding is refractory to medical management, intrauterine balloon tamponade devices are commonly used to manage PPH.13–15 In August 2020, an intrauterine vacuum-induced hemorrhage-control device (Jada System) was U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–cleared for the management of abnormal postpartum uterine bleeding or PPH.16 The device has an elliptical silicone loop that is placed in the uterus and facilitates uterine contraction when connected to low-level vacuum and was specifically designed to control obstetric hemorrhage.16,17 In the registrational study (N=106), the device safely and effectively controlled bleeding in 94% of individuals, with definitive bleeding control in a median of 3 minutes.18\n\nThis postmarket registry medical record review was conducted to assess the real-world effectiveness and safety of the intrauterine vacuum-induced hemorrhage-control device in the management of obstetric hemorrhage.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe RUBY (Treating Abnormal Postpartum Uterine Bleeding or Postpartum Hemorrhage with the Jada System) study was an observational, multicenter, postmarket registry medical record review conducted from October 8, 2020, to March 31, 2022, across 16 centers in the United States (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04995887). Centers were selected based on their ability to reliably collect data on device use. All individuals treated with the device (ie, device was inserted and connected to vacuum) at the centers during the study timeframe were included in the registry; there were no prespecified exclusion criteria. Data were collected retrospectively after the clinician had treated the individual with the device. Medical record reviews for all instances of device use were to be performed biweekly at each site through the study end. Because this was an observational study, we do not expect that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a substantial effect on the study results.\n\nThis study was conducted in compliance with local or national regulations (ie, International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice and in accordance with the ethics principles of the Declaration of Helsinki). The study protocol was approved by the IRB of each site and waiver of informed consent was obtained before the study was conducted.\n\nThe primary effectiveness endpoint was treatment success, defined as bleeding control after device insertion with no treatment escalation or bleeding recurrence after initial bleeding control and device removal. Concomitant treatment with uterotonic agents beyond oxytocin (eg, carboprost, methergine, misoprostol) or tranexamic acid, compression sutures (in cesarean birth), and blood transfusions were allowed in cases of treatment success. Cases were categorized as device failure if nonsurgical interventions (uterine packing, balloon tamponade, embolization for atony-related bleeding), surgical interventions (uterine artery ligation, hysterectomy for atony-related bleeding), or compression sutures (if device was aborted to treat with compression sutures for ongoing bleeding) were required to control bleeding after placement of the device. Individuals who had a missing date or time for device insertion, bleeding recurrence after device removal, or hysterectomy were imputed as device failures.\n\nAdditional outcomes included: blood loss before device insertion; total blood loss (including recurrence); the time from placenta delivery to device insertion; the device indwelling time; bleeding recurrence; the time to bleeding control; treatment with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion; and SMM components including transfusion of four or more units of RBCs, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and hysterectomy. Volume of blood loss was collected according to each institution's protocol and, therefore, could have been estimated or quantitative. The Use of uterotonic agents and tranexamic acid before device insertion was obtained from medical records. Information on known risk factors for obstetric hemorrhage, including induction, birth weight, parity, and medical comorbidities was collected from medical records.\n\nTo assess safety, serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse device effects were collected from time of device insertion through hospital discharge. An SAE was defined as an event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in permanent impairment or damage to a body function or structure, or necessitated medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. Adverse device effects were defined by the investigator as an event that was considered at least possibly related to the device or procedure, and serious adverse device effects were a subset of SAEs considered at least possibly related to the device or procedure. Adverse event terms were collected verbatim from the medical record. These verbatim terms were reviewed by one author (P.I.C.) and categorized into lower-level terms for summary purposes (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Version 25.1).\n\nAll analyses are descriptive, and results are presented by mode of delivery. The primary treatment success endpoint is summarized by cause of bleeding (preplanned analysis). The bleeding cause subgroups were any uterine atony, with or without nonatony causes; isolated uterine atony; and nonatony only. Efficacy and safety in the subgroup with gestational age less than 34 weeks are summarized (preplanned analysis). In an exploratory post hoc analysis, treatment success, any RBC transfusion, and SMM outcomes are summarized by blood loss at time of device insertion (999 mL or less, 1,000–1,999 mL, 2,000–2,999 mL, and 3,000 mL or more). Severe maternal morbidity measures also are summarized by treatment success and failure. Continuous variables are summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, quartiles), and categorical variables are summarized as number and percentage. Two-sided, 95% CIs for the exact binomial distribution were used for analysis of the primary effectiveness endpoint, based on the Clopper-Pearson method. Race and ethnicity were collected directly from the medical record, summarized as per National Institutes of Health standards, and included as an important social determinant of health in hemorrhage management.19 Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 on a Linux64 operating system.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFrom October 2020 to March 2022, 800 individuals were treated with the device (n=530 vaginal births, n=270 cesarean births). The mean (SD) maternal age was 30.3 (6.23) years. Most individuals treated were White, almost half were nulliparous before the current delivery, 6% delivered preterm, and 10% had a history of abnormal postpartum bleeding or PPH (Table 1). Preeclampsia with severe features and gestational hypertension were risk factors reported for more than 10% of individuals. Overall, 94.3% of cases had uterine atony, alone or in combination with other bleeding causes; 57.9% in the vaginal birth group and 81.5% in the cesarean birth group had isolated uterine atony (Fig. 1). More than half (62.8%) of individuals with vaginal births had induced labor, and 51.1% of cesarean births were scheduled (Table 1). Birth weight was more than 4,000 g in 8.3% of vaginal and was 9.0% of cesarean births. Most individuals received second-line uterotonics beyond oxytocin or tranexamic acid before device insertion (Table 2). Administration of two uterotonics with or without tranexamic acid was the most common treatment approach.\n\nBleeding was successfully controlled with the intrauterine vacuum-induced hemorrhage-control device in 92.5% of vaginal births and in 83.7% of cesarean births, and the pattern of treatment success was consistent across uterine atony with other bleeding causes, isolated uterine atony, and other or nonatony bleeding causes (Fig. 2A). The treatment success rate was highest in cases of isolated uterine atony for both groups (vaginal births: 95.8%, n=307; cesarean births: 88.2%, n=220). In the subgroup of births with gestational age less than 34 weeks (n=24 vaginal births, n=26 cesarean births), treatment success rates (vaginal births: 91.7%; cesarean births: 84.6%) were similar to those observed in births with gestational age 34 weeks or more (vaginal births: 92.5%; cesarean births: 83.6%; Table 3).\n\nIn the vaginal birth group, median blood loss at the time of device insertion was 1,050 mL, and one in four individuals lost more than 1,500 mL of blood before the device was inserted. In cesarean births, median blood loss at insertion was 1,600 mL and one in four individuals lost more than 2,000 mL before insertion (Table 4). The median time from placenta delivery to device insertion was 31 minutes in vaginal births, and the time to device insertion was more than 1 hour from delivery of the placenta for one in four individuals. For cesarean births, the median time from placenta delivery to device insertion was 108 minutes and device insertion did not occur for more than 3 hours in one in four individuals. For vaginal births, the median indwelling time (insertion to removal) was 3.1 hours and bleeding recurred after device removal in 2.8%. For cesarean births, the median indwelling time was 4.6 hours and 4.1% had bleeding recurrence. Time-to-bleeding-control was available in 49% of cases (n=241 vaginal births, n=151 cesarean births). Definitive control of bleeding was achieved within 5 minutes for 73.8% of vaginal births (n=178) and 62.2% of cesarean births (n=94) and within 1 minute for 45.6% (n=110) and 34.4% (n=52), respectively. Red blood cell transfusion was administered in 29.2% of vaginal births and in 60.7% of cesarean births (Table 4).\n\nIndividuals with treatment failure experienced substantially higher median [interquartile range] total blood loss (2,193.5 mL [1,225, 3,500] for vaginal births, 3,540.0 mL [2,400, 5,000] for cesarean births) compared with treatment success (1,227.5 mL [886, 1,625] for vaginal births, 1,750.0 mL [1,460, 2,350] for cesarean births). When summarized by volume of blood lost before device insertion (n=431), the treatment success rate in the vaginal birth group with blood loss data available was 92.4% with up to 999 mL of blood loss, 94.1% with 1,000–1,999 mL of blood loss, and 90.6% with 2,000–2,999 mL of blood loss (Fig. 2B). In cesarean births with blood loss data available (n=238), 100% efficacy was observed when the device was inserted before 1,000 mL of blood was lost. Efficacy in cesarean births was 89.4% and 77.6%, respectively, in the 1,000–1,999 mL and 2,000–2,999 mL blood loss categories. In both groups, bleeding control efficacy was less than 50% when 3,000 mL or more of blood was lost before device insertion (Fig. 2B). For vaginal births in which the device did not successfully control bleeding (n=40), 17.5% (n=7) of individuals underwent hysterectomy, 32.5% (n=13) required transfusion of 4 or more units of RBCs (vs 2.2% [n=11/490] of treatment successes), and 27.5% (n=11) were admitted to the ICU (vs 2.4% [n=12/490] of treatment successes; Fig. 3A). For treatment failures among cesarean births (n=44), 27.3% (n=12) underwent hysterectomy, 47.7% (n=21) required transfusion of 4 or more units of RBCs (vs 5.8% [n=13/226] of treatment successes), and 43.2% were admitted to the ICU (vs 7.5% [n=17/226] of treatment successes; Fig. 3B). When SMM outcomes were summarized by volume of blood loss, an expected pattern of increased rates of any RBC transfusion, transfusion of 4 or more units of RBCs, and hysterectomy were observed with increasing blood loss in both the vaginal and cesarean birth groups (Table 5).\n\nNo uterine perforations or deaths were reported. In vaginal births, 14 SAEs were reported in 13 individuals (2.5%); in cesarean births, 22 SAEs were reported in 21 individuals (7.8%; Table 6 for a summary of SAEs). Adverse device effects were reported in six (1.1%) vaginal births and three (1.1%) cesarean births, of which two (0.4%) in the vaginal birth group and one (0.4%) in the cesarean birth group were considered serious. Both serious adverse device effects in the vaginal birth group were endometritis, one in an individual with uterine atony who was induced at 36 weeks of gestation and one in an individual with uterine atony and vaginal laceration whose labor was augmented at 40 weeks; both resolved with antibiotics. In the cesarean birth group, the serious adverse device effect was hemorrhagic shock (resulting in surgical ICU admission) in an individual with uterine atony and retained placenta who had emergent cesarean birth after being induced at 41 weeks of gestation; indwelling time for the intrauterine vacuum-induced hemorrhage-control device time was only 2 minutes, and the event resolved with balloon tamponade and transfusion. Among the SAEs, two occurred in the less than 34 weeks of gestation subgroup (one vaginal birth and one cesarean birth; both hysterectomy) and no adverse device effects were reported in this subgroup. Six nonserious adverse device effects were reported (four vaginal births, two cesarean births). Events in the vaginal birth group were device expulsion during a bowel movement, fever after device removal, postpartum endometritis, and postpartum endometritis with fever. Events in the cesarean birth group were abdominal pain while the device was in place and endometritis or bacterial vaginosis.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn addition to confirming the results of the registrational trial18 by demonstrating the real-world effectiveness and safety of the FDA-cleared intrauterine vacuum-induced hemorrhage-control device in the management of PPH, this observational postmarket registry medical record review provided an opportunity to assess SMM in real-world settings. Rapid bleeding control was achieved in both vaginal and cesarean births, and indwelling time was relatively short compared with typical indwelling times for balloon tamponade.17 The safety profile was consistent with that observed in the registrational trial, and all events were expected risks in the setting of PPH and resolved without serious complications, suggesting an acceptable risk-benefit profile. Differences between the registrational trial and the RUBY registry include that the registrational trial excluded individuals with blood loss of more than 1,500 mL at the time of device placement, preterm births before 34 weeks of gestation, and nonatony bleeding causes. Together, these studies provide evidence that the device is an important new tool for managing a life-threatening condition, and its timely use may help to improve obstetric hemorrhage outcomes and ultimately decrease maternal morbidity and mortality.\n\nObstetric hemorrhage can be a traumatic experience for birthing individuals, affecting not only physical and reproductive health but also mental health.20 Risk factors for PPH, including those for uterine atony, are increasing in the United States, and SMM has also increased despite heightened awareness within the medical community.4,6,7 Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, which include transfusion and hysterectomy among 21 indicators,4 SMM increased almost 3-fold from 1993 to 2014 (49.5–144.0 cases/10,000 delivery hospitalizations), driven primarily by blood transfusions.4 The observation that 29.2% of individuals in the vaginal birth group and 60.7% in the cesarean birth group received transfusions reflects the high blood loss volumes at the time of device insertion.\n\nEarly recognition of abnormal postpartum bleeding and timely intervention are crucial in managing the condition and preventing SMM associated with excessive blood loss. Whether PPH is defined as 1,000 mL or more of blood loss regardless of delivery route or 500–999 mL of blood loss in the setting of vaginal births and more than 1,000 mL in the setting of cesarean births,14,21 most cases in this study exceeded those thresholds before device insertion. The blood loss volumes before the insertion of the device, together with the elapsed time from placenta delivery to device insertion, suggests either a delay in the recognition of obstetric hemorrhage or a delay in implementation of effective treatment measures. Whereas effectiveness with the device was stable at more than 90% in vaginal births with up to 2,999 mL of blood loss, efficacy declined as blood loss volume increased in the cesarean birth group. Although most transfusions of 4 or more RBC units and ICU admissions occurred in individuals with treatment failure, substantial SMM still occurred in individuals at lower blood loss volumes. These findings suggest the potential utility of earlier and more aggressive intervention in obstetric hemorrhage to mitigate risk of maternal morbidity.\n\nA primary strength of our study is that it is a large evaluation of the Jada System, providing practical information on device use in both vaginal and cesarean births across multiple sites in real-world settings. Our findings not only confirm the efficacy and safety reported in the registrational trial18 but also expand the evidence base with data from 270 cesarean births (only 15 in the registrational trial) and 50 births with gestational age less than 34 weeks. Preterm births before 34 weeks of gestation were excluded from the registrational trial, and the device's instructions for use contain a warning for this subgroup.16,18 In addition, the racial and ethnic diversity of our PPH population was similar to that reported in a nationally representative health care database of more than 1.6 million pregnant individuals across 463 U.S. hospitals, which includes Medicaid, and the National Inpatient Sample database, which is the largest publicly available U.S. all-payer inpatient care database.22,23\n\nLimitations include that recruitment was largely at academic centers, which could affect generalizability to rural, community, or limited-resource settings. In addition, the blood loss data were comprised of a mix of estimated and quantitative reporting and should be interpreted under the context of institutional variability in assessment and quantification methods. Estimated blood loss is less reliable than quantitative blood loss assessment and likely underestimates total blood loss volume.24 Similarly, institutional protocols for ICU admission and transfusion likely varied. Missing data are a challenge with all real-world data collection. Unlike controlled clinical trials in which data collection and patient management are highly structured, it can be particularly difficult to capture some types of data (eg, detailed timestamps, blood loss volume, time to achieve hemostasis) in urgent medical situations such as real-world PPH management. Finally, this registry was designed as single-arm study to assess use of the device, so direct comparisons to other treatments are not possible; however, such data could provide valuable insights to better understand the appropriate place for this device in PPH treatment algorithms."
