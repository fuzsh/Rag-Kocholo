You can submit to the journals based on your talk at the AVS 68th International Symposium at any time. You can choose either JVST A, JVST B, Biointerphases, SSS or AQS depending on the topic.\n\nYour article/letter will be peer-reviewed rigorously as a regular submission and, if accepted, will be published quickly online.\n\nYour article/letter will get either an article or letter designation on online databases such as ISI; it will NOT be designated as a proceedings paper.\n\nThere are no length limitations and your manuscript can be as long as it needs to be to convey your ideas and results in the most succinct way.\n\nYou can find easy-to-use templates and instructions for authors for all AVS journals by choosing the journal from this link: https://avs.scitation.org. Once on the journal site, click “Preparing your Manuscript” under the “For Authors” tab.\n\nFor your convenience, an article template is available on the journal.\n\nPlease submit using the links below.\n\nOur journal web pages utilize quick links and advanced search capabilities. Articles are fully citable as soon as they are published online."
