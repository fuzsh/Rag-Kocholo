        "text": "Ethical Acquisitions for Marine Aquariums\n\nEthical decision-making is built into Association of Zoos and Aquariums professionals’ daily lives, regardless of their roles and responsibilities. For those who are charged with acquiring fish for aquariums, those decisions are complicated by a set of challenges that can begin thousands of miles away.\n\nIdeally, every participant in a marine aquarium supply chain would act ethically and be committed to sustainability. However, issues related to education, training, social justice, and adherence to standards create real roadblocks. And for AZA-accredited aquariums, finding ways around those roadblocks is essential.\n\n“Verifying the sustainability of animals in our care is linked to the sustainability of our collections and ongoing operations,” said Dan Ashe, president and chief executive officer of AZA. “The inability to verify the source of wild marine fish contradicts the conservation intent of accredited aquariums, threatens the reputational integrity of these organizations, and ultimately may do harm to local communities and the species and their environments.”\n\nRecognizing the critical nature of this and related issues, AZA created the Aquatic Collections Sustainability Committee (ACSC) in 2019, with a mission to “guide our members in making ethical and responsible management decisions to assure thriving, sustainable, aquatic populations.”\n\n“We knew we had to look at the entire subject of aquatic sustainability, and we knew how complex it was, but there were a few strategic areas where we thought we could move the needle,” said current ACSC committee chair Hap Fatzinger, director of North Carolina Aquariums Division. Ethical acquisition became one of the group’s five strategic priorities, along with animal welfare and longevity; sustainable management; larval programs; and communications. And today, committee members and many others are participating in collaborations to develop ethical solutions that will reap benefits from the reefs to their own aquarium collections.\n\nOffer Training\n\n“One of the big challenges in the past 20 years involves using cyanide to catch fish. Not only does it stun the fish, it also stuns everything in the reef,” said Andrew Pulver, vice president of animal care at Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Ill., and chair, ACSC ethical acquisitions working group. “We want to know the fishers’ catch methods, that they’re using the best gear, doing no harm, and using the best handling and packing practices that result in low stress and mortality.”\n\nTo that end, Paul Anderson, founder of the Coral Reef Aquarium Fisheries Campaign, is currently embarking on the IndoReefFish project, a training initiative in Indonesia that is supported by a three-year, $700,000 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).\n\nWith Shedd Aquarium serving as principal investigator on the grant, and support from AZA, Anderson is also partnering with two conservation NGOs, the LINI Foundation and Rare, to implement the project.\n\n“There are aquatic fisheries in 35 countries, and management of them varies widely,” said Anderson. “We wanted to develop a model for sustainable sourcing for zoos and aquariums that could be upscaled and replicated. We chose Indonesia because LINI and Rare are based there, and the stakeholders are generally supportive of this. We’re going to present training programs for villages on how to manage fishing and how to do better business management in a way that will be able to provide value to them.”\n\nFor more than a decade, LINI has taught marine aquarium fishers sustainable fishing techniques and how to advocate for their businesses and the sustainability of their fishery. Anderson plans to invite those fishers and LINI representatives to train fishers in other areas of the country.\n\nAnd Rare, which has already developed a successful model of food fishery sustainability called Managed Access with Reserves (MA+R), is collaborating with Anderson in what will be their first time implementing their model for marine aquarium fisheries.\n\n“Rare believes that tackling poorly regulated and unmanaged aquarium fishing practices can be achieved using the MA+R model,” said Stuart Campbell, Rare’s senior program director, Indonesia. “The MA+R approach introduces community-led and legal regulations that aim to sustain fisheries production and build co-management with governments while elevating the voices of coastal fishers to tackle degradation of fish habitats, declining fisheries, and poor livelihood outcomes of coastal communities.”\n\nEvery effort to improve the beginning of the process is inextricably linked to the ultimate health and sustainability of our collections.\n\n“We can’t achieve aquatic conservation without the communities we rely on,” said Peggy Sloan, chief animal conservation officer at Shedd Aquarium. “Our job is to ensure that we’re doing right by the communities and reefs out there by how we do our business here.”\n\nCreate Accountability\n\nOnce the fish leave the fishers, they pass through a chain that can include multiple buyers, quarantine and export facilities, and import facilities before they reach a wholesaler.\n\n“There can be so many middle players that we lose traceability, said Pulver. “We need to be able to ensure there aren’t any slip-ups in that chain, and that every part uses best practices. We need to build clear coalitions from reef to aquarium.”\n\nThe ACSC’s ethical acquisitions working group action plan includes the development of a third-party vendor-verification model for marine fish suppliers, a critical component of a process that should be marked by ethics and sustainability at every step.\n\nSloan and Rob Hicks, divisional director, conservation, welfare, and education at Merlin Entertainments (SEA LIFE), joined forces to carry that work forward in a partnership that extends beyond AZA. Last year they conducted a study to determine the feasibility of developing a certification model and found that it would be possible with a great deal of effort and funding. After completing nine months of research and interviews, they hosted an invited workshop in January of this year designed to build a coalition of stakeholders in the marine aquarium trade who would commit to best practices and a path toward a model for third-party certification.\n\n“We needed to determine ‘what is the pathway toward a place where an aquarium in New England―or Kansas―can acquire fishes and know that they are sustainably and ethically sourced?’ said Sloan. “There have been many great efforts by individual aquariums that have tried to work in this area on their own but realize it can’t be done in isolation. We have to work with collective impact models.”\n\nFollowing the two-day workshop during which individuals from 12 countries participated in presentations and discussions, Sloan reported that their first three goals of the project have been achieved:\n\nAgree on best practices for acquisition using models of standards creation that are recognized to develop authentic, meaningful, and usable outcomes.\n\nAgree how to use those best practice standards and commit to following the process.\n\nPilot priority species in specific regions.\n\nThe next two steps will be underway during the remainder of 2024 and throughout 2025.\n\nAdopt a shared model of best practices and how to follow them, and share results and lessons learned.\n\nAgree on a certification or recommendation, easily identifiable and “owned” by a third party.\n\nShare Resources\n\nThe AZA community is increasing its reliance on aquaculture as another option for acquiring fishes. The larval fish programs working group of ACSC is committed to leveraging existing resources among the membership through its larval production and distribution program.\n\nBy being very selective about rearing species that AZA members are most interested in acquiring, participants are avoiding a past issue of raising too many fish that no one wanted, according to Fatzinger.\n\n“We’ve developed a very focused and strategic process to ID the eggs. Multiple facilities are participating, and once we’re comfortable that we can raise the larvae to shipping size, we put out a call to see who is interested in what species, and how many fish they want. As we develop new technologies and strategies to increase our knowledge of species rearing, we will make all of that information public and available.”\n\nAlthough not part of the ACSC larval fish program, Chris Coco, vice president of aquatic sustainability at Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Ga., has found another path to benefit from aquaculture through a partnership. After Hawaii shut down its ornamental fish industry, he entered into a mutually beneficial relationship with Hawaii Pacific University’s Oceanic Institute (OI) aquaculture development program.\n\n“The relationship between OI and Georgia Aquarium is one where we provide resources for staff there to obtain surplus local marine fish species eggs of interest to the Aquarium, hatch them, and ship them to us as small juveniles. Aquarium staff then grow the fish, ultimately integrating them into our live reef and other display habitats; and we also share some of these sustainably produced fish with other AZA members. In addition, OI staff host Aquarium team members for one to two weeks annually for marine aquaculture technique training; and we also host OI staff for training our team here in Atlanta.\n\n“Increasing our ability to bring in our own animals through partnerships with like-minded people lowers the number of animals needed from the wild; and allows us to have vibrant and robust living collections to present to our guests well into the future.”\n\nAs with most large and complex issues that are global in nature, solutions aren’t achieved overnight or in a vacuum. AZA members have stepped up to be effective partners in this effort.\n\n“We have to know where our fish are coming from, and we have to find those chains we can support responsibly,” said Fatzinger, who feels that ACSC has made progress in this and the other priority areas. “I feel that we are elevating the conversation and the work effort to tackle it. We’re not turning a blind eye. We’re facing the challenges head on, but we’ll never be done with this work.”\n\nHero Photo Credit: Brenna Hernandez, © John G. Shedd Aquarium\n\nBack to All Stories"
