        "text": "PERSPECTIVE\n\nMultipartite continuous-variable optical quantum entanglement: Generation and application\n\nThe authors offer an overview of progress and a future perspective of large-scale optical quantum entanglement. They cover a broad range of topics from the basics of continuous-variable optical quantum entanglement and a multiplexing methodology for the generation of large-scale quantum entanglement to future approaches toward practical usages of large-scale optical quantum entanglement. The content includes both pedagogical content and the search for future directions beyond the current frontier.\n\nWarit Asavanant and Akira Furusawa\n\nPhys. Rev. A 109, 040101 (2024)\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nEditorial: Enhancing Physical Review A Letters\n\nJanuary 4, 2023\n\nPhysical Review A is excited to offer better visibility and a tailored abstract for our popular Letter articles.\n\nEDITORS' SUGGESTION\n\nQuantized Thouless pumps protected by interactions in dimerized Rydberg tweezer arrays\n\nThe authors study Thouless pumps, i.e., adiabatic topological transport, in an interacting spin chain described by the dimerized XXZ Hamiltonian. They show that a new adiabatic path for a Thouless pump is possible for an interacting spin chain in which interactions can induce a spontaneous antiferromagnetic order.\n\nSergi Julià-Farré, Javier Argüello-Luengo, Loïc Henriet, and Alexandre Dauphin\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, 023328 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nAnalytically controlling the laser-induced electron phase in sub-cycle motion\n\nThe authors develop an approach to directly control the phase of an electron’s sub-cycle motion in an intense laser field by tuning an additional low-frequency electric field. A key formula connecting the low-frequency electric field with the harmonic frequency shift is found, suggesting in situ applications including continuously tuning XUV waves and sampling terahertz pulses.\n\nDoan-An Trieu et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L021101 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nControlling nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation with engineered environments\n\nThe authors blueprint a superconducting “Bose condenser,” a device where nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of photons into single or multiple modes can be controlled on demand, through the coupling to artificial quantum baths.\n\nFrancesco Petiziol and André Eckardt\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L021701 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nModel-independent inference of quantum interaction from statistics\n\nThe traditional approach to understanding an interaction between physical systems involves explaining the experimental statistics with some model of interaction. The author here proposes an alternative approach where the interaction is explained via experimental statistics. By assuming systems behave according to quantum theory, their method uses Bell inequalities to infer entangling quantum interactions among an arbitrary number of quantum systems from statistical data.\n\nShubhayan Sarkar\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L020402 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nNagaoka ferromagnetism in doped Hubbard models in optical lattices\n\nFinding ferromagnetic ground states of the Hubbard model, which usually features antiferromagnetic spin correlations, has been an outstanding challenge since Nagaoka’s celebrated (but experimentally unrealistic) proposal in 1966. Here, the authors show how such elusive itinerant ferromagnetism can be enhanced by kinetic frustration or occupation-dependent hoppings and demonstrate the relevance of these mechanisms to recent optical-lattice experiments.\n\nRhine Samajdar and R. N. Bhatt\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L021303 (2024)\n\nEDITORS' SUGGESTION\n\nDissociative recombination of rotationally cold ArH+\n\nThe authors experimentally studied the dissociative recombination of electronically and vibrationally relaxed ArH^+ in its lowest rotational levels, using an electron-ion merged-beams setup at the Cryogenic Storage Ring. They find that the unusually slow reaction rate at low collision energies is driven by nonadiabatic interactions where dissociation occurs on the loosely bound electronic ground-state ArH.\n\nÁbel Kálosi et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, 022816 (2024)\n\nEDITORS' SUGGESTION\n\nLinearly polarized RABBIT beyond the dipole approximation\n\nIn this paper, the authors use numerical solutions to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, perturbation theory, as well as analytic expressions to investigate nondipole effects in the RABBIT technique, studying a helium atom subject to a linearly polarized XUV and a weak IR field. By scanning the time delay between the two fields, they observe modulations in sidebands both for the angular-integrated photoelectron yield and for the forward-backward asymmetry in photoelectron distribution along the light-propagation direction.\n\nYijie Liao et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, 023109 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nRelaxation in dipolar spin ladders: From pair production to false-vacuum decay\n\nThe authors demonstrate how the interplay between intrachain and interchain interactions in a dipolar spin chain results in three distinct relaxation regimes: ergodic, characterized by rapid relaxation towards equilibrium; metastable, where the state is quasi-localized; and partially relaxed, exhibiting both partial ergodic and quasi-localized behaviors simultaneously.\n\nGustavo A. Domínguez-Castro et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L021302 (2024)\n\nEDITORS' SUGGESTION\n\nVibrational branching fractions for laser cooling of nonlinear strontium-containing molecules\n\nThe authors explore candidates for a next-generation search for the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) by experimentally measuring the vibrational loss channels in three Sr-containing nonlinear molecules. They conclude that SrNH2 is the optimal choice for a future laser-cooled molecule-based eEDM experiment.\n\nAlexander Frenett, Zack Lasner, Lan Cheng, and John M. Doyle\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, 022811 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nMagnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atom-molecule collisions\n\nThe authors present quantum scattering calculations on magnetic Feshbach resonances (MFRs) in ultracold atom-molecule collisions. The calculations predict a wealth of experimentally detectable MFRs in Rb-SrF collisions and uncover new MFRs due to the intramolecular spin-rotation interaction. These results open up the possibility of unbiased theoretical simulations on MFRs in ultracold atom-molecule collisions with realistic interactions.\n\nMasato Morita et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L021301 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nExtended quantum process tomography of logical operations on an encoded bosonic qubit\n\nThe authors implemented full process tomography of a bosonic gate in a superconducting circuit using coherent states as probes. This approach allows for a transparent error budget and the detection of leakage errors.\n\nMikael Kervinen et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L020401 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nProcess of dissociation of NH3 by electron impact in low-temperature plasma and its isotope effect\n\nThe authors present a theoretical approach to investigate the dissociation of the ammonia molecule following a collision with a low-energy electron. The approach could be used to model the process for other molecules in low-temperature plasma.\n\nXianwu Jiang et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L020803 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nViolations of the v-representability condition underlying Kohn-Sham density-functional theory\n\nThe authors demonstrate that Kohn-Sham density-functional theory in its original form is not applicable to many open-shell atoms because no proper Kohn-Sham model system obeying the Aufbau principle exists. Perspectives to deal with this situation are outlined.\n\nEgor Trushin, Jannis Erhard, and Andreas Görling\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L020802 (2024)\n\nANNOUNCEMENT\n\nAPS Releases Refreshed Data Availability Policy for the Physical Review Journals\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\nThe policy requires authors to explain where research data can be found starting Sept. 4.\n\nRead More\n\nMore News\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nEditorial: Coauthor!
