Manual layup method for FRP reinforcement is very old and traditional method. There is no other way to make fibre and epoxy resin and hardener coated surface on the steel tank, inside or outside for strength and corrosion free. The same time the detailed study of present manual hand layup winding of Filament activity indicates that the process suffers from various draw back like lack of accuracy which results in cracks, weak structure and instability in surface and round cylinders, low production rate E-Glass fibre is one of the essential elements of reinforced Plastics with epoxy resin in aerospace, Pipe industries, Pressure vessel and Marin Industries. These Fibre roving and their reinforcement are used for strengthening pressure vessel, cylinder of thick and thin structure for increase life and trouble free maintenance. In order to remove above drawbacks and formulate an approximate experimental data based model by using E-Glass fibre, Epoxy resin, and hardener for Filament winding activity. Design of experimental work is executed for establishing, formulation of experimental mathematical model for processing time, Density, fibre volume fraction, weight of shell, and Ultimate tensile strength of FRP Shell by obtaining specified result with Filament winding. Experimentation data is chosen, using methodology of engineering experimentation for CNC filament winding machine. This research also includes the design, fabrication and Mass Production of Pressure vessel with Filament winding along with theory of experimentation. It also includes formulation of mathematical model and its sensitivity analysis, reliability, optimization and limiting values and ANN. Out of which process for formulation of mathematical model established. Field Data collected from Vendors and In-house for a prediction model was then developed to predict effect of parameters. The basic steps used in generating the model adopted in the development of the prediction model are: collection of experimental data; analysis of data, pre-processing and feature extraction of the data, design of the prediction model, training of the model and finally testing the model to validate the results and its ability to predict Filament winding operation. This research work presents an experimental investigations and sequential classical experimentation technique used to perform experiments for various independent parameters. An attempt is made to optimize the process parameters for processing time, Density, fibre volume fraction, weight of shell, and Ultimate tensile strength. The test results proved processing time, Density, fibre volume fraction, weight of shell, and Ultimate tensile strength are significantly influenced by changing important five dimensionless π terms..\n\nPage(s): 31-53\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nReferences\n\n[1].

Hence measuring productivity and efficiency is essential for all kinds of production plants to perform better. There is huge scope for research on measurement of the productivity and efficiency for pre-serial production plant, as there are no findings of literatures in this regard. This research is about the operations of pre-serial production plants and bottlenecks in adopting the standard methodologies of measurement of productivity and efficiency which are generally followed in serial production and batch production plants & developing a new measurement technique for productivity & efficiency for pre-serial & prototype production plants. As per the findings, the appropriate methodology for measurement of productivity and efficiency of Pre- serial production plants is not well set till now. Most of the companies who operates pre-serial production plants adapted the methodologies which are suitable only for serial production. As compared to serial and batch production plants, the pre-serial production plants work totally differently. In serial production plants the product is optimized and all the relevant data which contributes in the measurement of productivity and efficiency is available. The pre-serial plants are responsible for product optimization. In these plants the product optimization is primary objective and process is secondary. Hence we cannot finalize the inputs like cycle time, machining time; labor usage till the product is finalized. The value of input measures will keep on changing during optimization of product and process. Hence using these values for measurement of productivity makes no sense. Once the product is optimized then the suitable processes will get optimized and the trails will takes place. The results from trails will be considered as the input measures for productivity measurement. As the working methodology and process of serial and pre-serial production plants differs from each other, there is a need to develop a measurement technique which can efficiently measure the productivity of pre-serial plants. The project comprises of defining a new measurement model/methodology for pre-serial plants and as per the pre-study it has been decided that the author will divide the production process into micro processes and define the standard for each process which will be considered as standard and compared with actual parameters which will leads to find out productivity and efficiency of the pre-serial production plants. This horizontal deployment of this methodology can be done to batch production and also prototype production plants with suitable modifications..\n\nPage(s): 88-95\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nLubrication is a phenomenon to introduce a substance between the moving contact surfaces to reduce friction. Lubricants are the substances applied for this purpose. Oil, grease, graphite, mineral oils are commonly used lubricants. These permits free action of mechanical devices, absorb excess of heat and prevents damage of machinery. A lubricant is used as around 90% of the base oil and rest of mineral oil. The additives are the chemical substances added to the lubricants to improve the quality. Mineral oils are being added for this purpose. Although these are cheap and available easily yet the oxidation products of these oils are not environmental friendly. To overcome this problem searching of new sources of additives are in progress. The seed oils would serve a good option for it. High viscosity index, high flash and fire points, more biodegradability and oiliness are some of the advantages of these. In the course of our research to seek new/novel sources of oils from Arid /semi-arid zone of Rajasthan, a number of seed oils were analysed. The physicochemical properties of seeds and oils have been determined using volumetric, spectroscopic and chemical techniques. A detailed field survey, seeds collection, oil extraction, and the determination of values like viscosity, acid values, saponification values and flash and fire points are some of the parts of research. Some edible oils were purchased from local market for comparative analysis. The various values were determined and compared for application in lubrication. The present paper deals with the physicochemical analysis of Vernonia cineria, Glycin max, Gossipium hirsutium, Verbesenia encelioides, Ricinus communis and Aracis hypogia seed oils. It was concluded that these oils could prove their role better as compared to traditional additives.\n\nPage(s): 121-124\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nReferences\n\n[1].

Glycerol, by-product of biodiesel synthesis, could be a bio-renewable substrate to obtain hydrogen. Momentous amount of glycerol is produced as a byproduct during bio-diesel production by the transesterification of vegetable oils, which are available at low cost in large supply from renewable raw materials. As hydrogen is a clean energy carrier, conversion of glycerol to hydrogen is one among the most attractive ways to make use of glycerol. Production of hydrogen from glycerol is environmentally friendly because it adds value to glycerol generated from biodiesel plants. In this study, the catalytic production of hydrogen by steam reforming of glycerol has been experimentally performed in a fixed-bed reactor. The performance of this process was evaluated over 5wt%, 10wt%, and 15wt% Ni/Al2O3. The catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation technique. For a comparative purpose, the steam reforming experiments were conducted under same operating conditions, i.e., reaction temperature ranging from 700°C to 900°C, atmospheric pressure and 1:9 glycerol to water molar ratio. Also the effect of glycerol to water ratio, metal loading, and the feed flow rate (space velocity) was analysed. The results showed that the hydrogen production increased with the increase in the treatment temperature. The highest amount of hydrogen produced was attained over 15wt% Ni/Al2O3 at 850 °C at 1:9 glycerol to water molar ratio. The catalyst Co/Al2O3,Cu/Al2O3 were prepared by wet impregnation technique and need to do activity test and compare the results with Ni/Al2O3..\n\nPage(s): 150-152\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nThe widespread occurrence of organic micro pollutants such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, flame retardants, and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in receiving bodies and drinking water influents has been a global issue of concern for academia and environmental agencies for over two decades. With looming water scarcity in many parts of the world, providing clean drinking water and sustainable development will require the use of water recycling in the future and it will be imperative that recycled water will not impact both environmental and human health. Consequently, extensive research and development in both upstream processing and downstream monitoring are needed. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) refer to a set of oxidative water treatments that can be used to treat toxic effluents at industrial level, hospitals and wastewater treatment plants. AOPs are successful to transform toxic organic compounds (e.g. drugs, pesticides, endocrine disruptors etc.) into biodegradable substances. AOPs in general are cheap to install but involve high operating costs due to the input of chemicals and energy required. To limit the costs, AOPs are often used as pretreatment combined with biologic treatment. Wastewaters from the various dyeing, paint and colour industries have been found to contain high amounts of harmful dyes such as RB-5 (Reactive Black T), Congo Red etc. The consumption of such wastewater is responsible for various type of diseases, cancers etc. The present study aims at the removal of these dyes from various effluents from a variety of methods including Ozonation, Catalytic Ozonation, Fenton and Photo Fenton. A series of experiments containing same concentration of dye were conducted and the effects of each were observed. Operating parameters such as effect of catalyst, rpm in the Ozonation experiments and the effect of different dosages of H2O2 ferrous ions and intensity of sunlight in Fenton and Photo-Fenton experiments were carefully observed. Finally the analysis is done by UV- spectrophotometer to calculate the concentration of the dye in the wastewater..\n\nPage(s): 170-173\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nIn the field of structural engineering the design of cost efficient structure is highly important. This led to development of cold-formed steel structures. Cold formed steel members have been widely used in residential and commercial buildings as primary load bearing structural elements. They are often made of thin steel sheets and hence they are more susceptible to local buckling. The present study focuses on understanding the importance of “lip” in cold formed steel sections. As per IS: 801 - 1975, design solution is developed for flexure member design. An experimental program is performed, to gain information on flexural capacity and buckling behaviour of member. Suitable finite element models are then developed to simulate the behaviour of tested beams and are validated using test results. All the ultimate load capacity results for local buckling are compared with codal provisions as well as results obtained by experimental program. This paper mainly focuses on to investigate load carrying capacity and buckling behaviour of two different cold formed steel channel sections i.e., with lip and without lip, by analytically(by developing design solutions),experimentally as well as by finite element analysis(by using ABAQUS software).The „lip‟ is not taking part anywhere in calculation of bending moment capacity. It is important regarding to buckling behaviour of cold formed steel sections. All the specimens are tested under Universal Testing Machine (UTM) and subjected to two point load system. Results are showing that members subjected to pure bending, with „Lip‟ channel section is subjected to web buckling. Channel sections with 'lip' is showing 28.7% higher than without 'lip' sections. In contrast, without „Lip‟ channel section is subjected to flange buckling. With „lip‟ channel section has high load carrying capacity compared to without „Lip‟ channel section. Analytical, experimental and finite element results are showing close to each other.\n\nPage(s): 193-196\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Budeanu CI.: Puissancesreactivesetfictives.

Entrepreneur can be, in this present day Mega world, either financier and / or consultant, technical adviser, secretarial adviser market etc. etc .So for the ethical growth, one has to follow the righteous track with no semblance for cut throat competition, nor any mix up , for temporary illusory cartel with similar industry for cut throat competition. Instead the righteous ones should be located, consented and then run the cartel for fair and just function of each one of such healthy cartels. We have such ethical companies since a long past. of glorious decades/centuries of Tatas, Birlas etc and also with their growth and expansion with diversification. They have their slogan-I grow and you grow with clientele too happy as well. However the spirituality is not achieved in a day as they say Rome was not built in a day.

Mind with its associated thoughts is different in each and every human being, on account of its own stock of thoughts of previous births unfruitified, present life till date, parental inheritance, effected through contacts, associations and the work Besides we need to be ethical for a common cause of overall growth of all in general.. It is though difficult but not impossible; because they say ‘where there is a will, there is a way’. This is a puritan call of the day, particularly, when the whole world is full of impulsive activities under the fear of insecurities-pain in body and tension in the mind-and so is in rat race of the hoarding of any kind of security. Even then, despite the very grievous reward of the ‘nature’ to us of frequency, type and intensity of the disasters, our longevity has increased and so we are sure to find a solution and its corresponding execution for understanding the mind, and its reorientation from its ‘impulse base’ to ‘value base’ activity, in line with universal ethics, for our overall growth with ecology as well.

Women entrepreneurship and their participation in entrepreneurial activities are gradually increasing. Quite a large number of women entrepreneurs have set up their enterprises and have been in business successfully. Self Help Groups (SHGs) have smoothened the way for entrepreneurship of rural women. The members of Self Help Groups are involved in Micro Entrepreneurship and work at micro level or cottage sectors. They are very much interested in entrepreneurial activities like, Handloom weaving, Piggery farm, Poultry farm, Dairy farm, Handicraft etc. The rate of growth of women entrepreneurship is not satisfactory till now. This is due to some basic problems arising in relation to entrepreneurial development in our societies. Hence the investigator carried out a study to find out motivating factors of entrepreneurship and also to find out the constraint faced by women entrepreneurs and suggesting remedial measures that would contribute to greater success rate among women entrepreneurs. Two hundred women (200) members from Self Help Group who are engaged themselves in various entrepreneurial activities are considered as respondents. The finding revealed that different factors compelled rural women to start their entrepreneurial activities but varieties of problems are faced by them in establishing and running their business ventures. The problems ranges from financial, Marketing Problems, Production Problem etc. The problems of women entrepreneurs are far more than their men counterparts due to the existence of societal taboos and restrictions. Considering the economic importance of developing entrepreneurship among women, the Government shall design a suitable scheme to attract women towards entrepreneurship and to help their enterprises to survive.\n\nPage(s): 315-318\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nIn the old pedagogies, a teacher’s quality was assessed primarily in terms of their ability to deliver content in their area of specialisation. Pedagogical capacity was secondarily important; its development in colleges of education varied a lot by country and culture. In most places, “teaching strategies” overwhelmingly meant direct instruction. In recent decades, technology has been layered on top of content delivery and used primarily to support students’ mastery of required curricular content. The question of what and how students should learn has been occupying a central place in debates on education in many countries in the Asia-Pacific region (UNESCO, 2014). A relevant education is not limited to a classroom, but seeks to contextualize the issues by the surrounding areas and people as parts of the learning environment. With the introduction of ICT and online education, there is a considerable potential for increase and a transformation from a simple classroom to complex virtual classrooms with participants collaborating irrespective of time and place. Transformative pedagogy is defined as an activist pedagogy combining the elements of constructivist and critical pedagogy that empowers students to examine critically their beliefs, values, and knowledge with the goal of developing a reflective knowledge base, an appreciation for multiple perspectives, and a sense of critical consciousness and agency. A transformative pedagogy underlies and contributes to the extent of the change, as more argue for a range of analytical and context-related skills to be developed in students. To operationalize education associated with sustainability, teaching approaches must focus on elements relating to the processes of learning, rather than the accumulation of knowledge—to develop graduates with capabilities to improvise, adapt, innovate, and be creative. Thus, the following research questions emerged, What is the impact of transformative pedagogy on fostering inservice teachers' transformative learning? What practices of transformative pedagogy impact student transformative learning? The Faculties from 3 private universities of Baroda were the sample for study. The Questionnaire was sent by Google forms and some of the faculties were interviewed and their opinion was noted related to transformative pedagogy. The data was collected from 150 faculties of different streams. The data collected through questionnaire was analysed quantitatively, keeping in mind the significance of the study whereas the interviews and opinionnaire was analysed qualitatively. The purpose of the current article is to revisit transformative pedagogy in order to redefine its units of analysis, its objectives and its methodologies, in a way that would make it more meaningful in the context of today’s knowledge driven society.\n\nPage(s): 332-337\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nIndia is very low penetrated country in health insurance with only around 20% of its population insured for health, has lowest public spending on health at only 1.4% of its GDP and very low per capita government spending on health at only 75$, making health insurance inevitable in India. The reliance on health insurance policies offered by public and private insurance companies is increasing in the present times. Over the years, the health insurance sector has expanded in all terms which is evident based on number of indicators. This paper tries to study the growth of health insurance sector post liberalisation in India. To study the growth of health insurance sector, various financial parameters such as total premium collection, total claims paid, claims paid ratio, premium per policy, claims paid per policy, premium per insured member, claims paid per insured member etc. along with non-financial parameters such as total number of policies, number of members, number of claims, number of health insurance companies etc. have been analysed over the years. For the purpose of study, secondary data on various parameters of growth have collected from Insurance Regulatory Development Authority’s reports and also from Insurance Information Bureau reports. The study has been carried out using various statistical methods such as graphical and descriptive measures and calculation of annual growth rate for various parameters. The study shows that there has been a phenomenal growth on almost all non-financial and financial growth parameters over the years indicating substantial development of health insurance sector post liberalisation in India. The rising cost of healthcare, increased awareness about the healthcare among people, the entry of efficient private players and the government thrust on achieving universal health coverage will fuel further growth in the health insurance sector in coming years. It is suggested that the government and IRDA should frame such policies that not only the health insurance sector rapidly grows but also maximum number of citizens of India are covered for health and get the benefit of health insurance.\n\nPage(s): 354-362\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nIntroduction: Mental well-being is an important aspect of health. Many disorders have been identified; among these existing, bipolar affective disorders is 2-4%. Over the years many drugs have been used in the treatment of bipolar mood disorders, but Lithium still remains the drug of choice for treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. Material & Methods : a quasi-experimental, one group pre-test, post-test design was adopted to measure the effectiveness of Teaching Plan on knowledge, for patients on lithium carbonate therapy in Psychiatric Centre of Jaipur City. The study was conducted on 50 patients who were put on lithium carbonate therapy and had completed at least one week duration of treatment. Data was collected from Jan 2016 to May 2016 A structured questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge about general self-care, side effects, Do’s, don’ts, and precaution to be taken while patient is put on Lithium therapy. And an teaching plan was prepared to provide pertinent information about the same. Results: The data revealed that, there is significant difference in mean of pre-test score (60.12) and mean of post-test score (79.44) of patient who were put on Lithium Carbonate Therapy. Major findings of study revealed that teaching plan on Self Care with Lithium Carbonate Therapy is effective in enhancement of patient’s knowledge. Knowledge of patients about Self Care with Lithium Carbonate Therapy was significantly associated with age, sex, and other type of occupation like housework, farmer and shopkeeper. Conclusion: After the detailed analysis of this study shows that professional students may have more Perceived level of stress compared to non-professional and it could be also undoubtedly concluded that stress management protocol make aware the college students regarding the impact of stress on their life and to manage their own affairs.\n\nPage(s): 423-427\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nReferences\n\n[1]SIRO Cinepharm USA, Lung Cancer Focus : India, Tracing the evolution,prevalence, distribution, etiology, association, occurrence, types, menifestation & imoact of lung cancer in India, 2015.

In some cases, the computer may have been used in order to commit the crime, and in other cases, the computer may have been the target of the crime. Computer viruses are computer programs that, when opened, put copies of themselves into other computers' hard drives without the users' consent. Creating a computer virus and disseminating it is a cyber crime. The virus may steal disk space, access personal information, ruin data on the computer or send information out to the other computer user's personal contacts. The most common way for a virus to infect a computer is by way of an email attachment. An example would be if you received an email with an attachment. You open this attachment, and the virus immediately spreads through your computer system. In some cases, if the virus is opened by a computer on a system network, such as your place of employment, the virus can immediately be spread throughout the network without needing to be sent via email. There are numerous reasons that a person would create a virus to send out to another computer or computers. It may be to steal information or money, to sabotage that system or to demonstrate the flaws that the other computer system has. In some cases these viruses are able to be removed from the user's computer system, and in some cases they are not. Therefore, it is easy for us to understand how these viruses cause significant financial harm every year. The punishment for those who damage or gain unauthorized access to a protected computer can be prison time and the repayment of financial losses.\n\nPage(s): 451-452\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nReferences\n\n[1].

It also focuses on the enhancing quality and accessibility and how can we bridge the gap between education and Employment. Methodology: Both primary and secondary data were used to see the present challenges in the system which it has failed in proper exaction of the policies. The analysis and conclusions are based on the personal queries to lecturers and university professor specially from Delhi and Rajasthan university. The rules and regulations of controlling agencies like UGC, AICTE and NAAK were analyzed. A few conclusions have been drawn from personal observation and experience and the need for improvement that has been felt and is required. Findings: It has been found that the controlling agencies of HES have adequately developed the system concerning all aspects the HES yet they have failed in developing the very spirit in the machinery that really works. Amazing findings have come out that in spite of having a proper structure, it has failed in providing the proper required and essential education. Research Limitation/Implication: As it has been earlier suggested that the controlling agencies of higher education have concerned every aspect, the paper throws light on the repeated concerns, yet if the spiritual and intellectual thought process is to be given to the problems, the suggestions can be implied, yet it does not claim to have considered all aspects. It has thrown light on major issues. Practical Implications: If a thought is generated, half of it is of course practical, the papers findings and suggestions are practical in the sense that the whole system needs to be reshuffle. If the teaching and administrative machinery is restructured with the main concern of providing better education. It can be practical. Originality/value: The originality of the paper lies in the down to earth discussion that mirroriges the real scenario of higher education that is often felt but not well expressed. It the paper is published reviewed and considered well, it can be valuable for bringing real change, however slight yet the real one.\n\nPage(s): 459-462\n\nDate of Publication: 24th December 2016\n\nReferences\n\n[1].
