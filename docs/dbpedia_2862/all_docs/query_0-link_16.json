        "text": "Throughout the history of civilization, humans have used packages that were made of various materials to protect and store the products they have obtained. In this process, many of the natural or artificial materials were used to protect or transport the product. Along with the increase in production and the change in consumer demands due to the industrialization that started in the 18th century, the marketing feature of the packaging, as well as the protection and storage function, gained importance. The invention of the printing press, the increase in the variety of materials used in packaging production, the effect of new artistic movements and the changing consumption habits of consumers played a major role in the diversification and development of the material and design of the packaging. Packaging and packaging design, which has become a major sector today, has an essential place in product marketing and strategies. While designing a packaging for a product, there are many important points such as the cost of the material chosen for the packaging, the compatibility of the packaging material with the product, the colors used in the design, the typography used and the layout on the shelves as well as the content of the product. In this study, we will examine the packaging designs used from the history of humanity to the present in terms of the materials used in the historical process, the changing purpose of use and changing design applications."
