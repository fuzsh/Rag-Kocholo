        "text": "Transactions on Plasma Science\n\nThe IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science is a publication of the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society. It is published monthly, and covers the theory and application of plasma science and engineering.\n\nThe Transactions on Plasma Science (TPS) is viewed as a primary source of technical information in many of the areas it covers. It serves as a major vehicle for dissemination of technical information for the plasma science community, and for three Technical Committees of the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society – the Plasma Science and Applications Committee, the Pulsed Power Science and Technology Committee, and the Fusion Technology Committee.\n\nManuscripts submitted to TPS for consideration for publication should meet the criteria as described elsewhere in this web site. Submissions should be made to the web site http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tps-ieee.\n\nHighlight Papers Made Freely Available\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief has selected papers that are likely to be of great interest to the community to be made freely available.\n\n2020\n\nWire Explosion in Vacuum\n\nIEEE Transactions on Plasma Science Best Paper Award\n\nDescription: The IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science Best Paper Award will be given annually to the paper deemed the best among those published in the IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science journal. The best paper will be selected in the spring.\n\nPrize: The award will be a plaque, a certificate for each of the paper authors and a money prize. The money prize is $500 for each author, up to a maximum award of $1500; if the paper has more than 3 authors, the maximum award will be divided equally among all authors.\n\nFunding: Funded by the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society.\n\nEligibility: The authors of all papers published in the Transactions on Plasma Science in the year 3 prior to the year of the award are eligible for consideration. For example, to be considered for the award presented in 2019, a paper must have been published in 2016.\n\nBasis for Judging: The primary consideration in determining the best paper will be its quantifiable usefulness to the community. The primary factor in this assessment will be the number of downloads of the paper from Xplore. Supplemental factors, which will be examined, are literature citations to the paper, quality, clarity of presentation, originality, significance, and contributions to the field. To minimize any risk that unethical manipulation could influence the winning paper selection, all of the factors mentioned (number of citations, quality, clarity of presentation, originality, significance, and contributions to the field) will be considered during final evaluation of the top-ranked paper to insure that is deserves to be selected as the award winner.\n\nPresentation: The award will be presented annually at the NPS Society conference most relevant to the topical area of the selected paper.\n\nFrequency: One award presented annually.\n\nAward Recipients:\n\n2019: The 1st award was announced in an editorial in the September 2019 issue of TPS.

The scope covers all aspects of the theory and application of plasma science. It includes the following areas: magnetohydrodynamics; thermionics and plasma diodes; basic plasma phenomena; gaseous electronics; microwave/plasma interaction; electron, ion, and plasma sources; space plasmas; intense electron and ion beams; laser-plasma interactions; plasma diagnostics; plasma chemistry and processing; solid-state plasmas; plasma heating; plasma for controlled fusion research; high energy density plasmas; industrial/commercial applications of plasma physics; plasma waves and instabilities; and high power microwave and submillimeter wave generation.\n\nConsiderations for the Suitability of Manuscripts for TPS\n\nManuscripts considered for publication should report original contributions to the theories, experimental results, or applications of the fields listed under the Journal Scope above; although papers of a tutorial or historical nature will be considered. Recent findings of a noteworthy nature will be considered for the Correspondence section; these will ordinarily be shorter length papers, thus facilitating the review process. IEEE’s policy on duplicate publication states “authors should only submit original work that has neither appeared elsewhere for publication, nor which is under review for another refereed publication. If authors have used their own previously published work(s) as a basis for a new submission, they are required to cite the previous work(s) and very briefly indicate how the new submission offers substantively novel contributions beyond those of the previously published work(s).”\n\nRequired Manuscript Content\n\nThe work should report new results, new applications, or new developments of interest. The manuscript must provide introductory material and context for the work. It must be clear what is new in the work and how it relates to other work in the field, and related work must be referenced appropriately. Models should be verified by data or some other means. There must be an analysis of data that provides conclusions that are general beyond the specific devices or system studied. The information provided must be sufficient for others to make use of the approach, results, etc. so that the impact is not limited to the particular system or application used in the manuscript. The paper should be sufficiently complete that others with comparable equipment could repeat the work. Overall the work needs to be of an archival nature (e.g., not only test results on a part that will be obsolete in a couple of years, or analysis of a particular design without illustration of generally applicable principles, or a description of the characteristics of a particular test facility, or an account of the existence and characteristics of a specific commercial product etc.).\n\nItems for Authors to Address Before Submission\n\nReviewers of TPS manuscripts are requested to evaluate, at a minimum, the items listed below. Authors should be sure that their manuscript suitably addresses all these items before submitting their work to TPS.\n\n1. Background and Context\n\nIs the introductory and background material sufficient for someone not an expert in this area to understand the context and significance of this work?\n\nHas related work been appropriately and adequately referenced?\n\nIs it clear what is new in this work?\n\nIs the relationship between this work and other work in the field adequately described?\n\nIs it described how this work advances the state-of-the art?\n\n2. Technical Quality\n\nIs the work relevant and accurate, free from errors, misconceptions, ambiguities?\n\nAre interpretations/models supported by data?\n\nIs the data analysis complete?\n\nDoes the work contain new results, new applications, or new developments of interest?\n\nIs the work of general applicability, i.e., not limited to the particular system or application used in the manuscript?\n\nAre the conclusions significant and well-supported?\n\n3. Clarity and Completeness\n\nIs the work logically developed?\n\nIs the presentation of data and/or modeling clear and easy to follow?\n\nIs the discussion clear and unambiguous?\n\nIs sufficient information provided for an expert reader to understand fully what was done, to repeat the experiment, or to duplicate the results presented?\n\nIs enough detail presented to support the conclusions drawn?\n\nIs the manuscript “complete”, i.e., not requiring extensive reference to other work to permit understanding?\n\n4. Presentation\n\nAre the English grammar and usage satisfactory?\n\nIs the manuscript loosely written or repetitious?\n\nDoes the manuscript restate established scientific or engineering principles instead of merely providing the appropriate reference to such principles?\n\n5. Figures and Tables\n\nAre the figures and tables clearly labeled, legible, and with appropriate captions?\n\nAre the figures and tables relevant, and referred to in the text?\n\nDo the tables and figures show reduced rather than raw data?\n\nIs the number of figures and tables appropriate?\n\n6. Symbols, Acronyms, and Abbreviations\n\nAre all nonstandard abbreviations and acronyms identified at first use?\n\nDoes the manuscript use proper and consistent symbols and abbreviations?\n\n7. Length\n\nIs the length of the manuscript appropriate for the amount and type of material presented? (Eight (8) pages is the maximum length of a “standard” manuscript. If the manuscript is longer than this, is that additional length necessary to develop and explain the material? If it is not, please suggest areas where material could be eliminated.)\n\n8. Appropriateness\n\nIs the work of an archival nature (e.g., not just test results on a part that will be obsolete in a couple of years, or analysis of a particular design without illustration of generally applicable principles, or description of the characteristics of a particular test facility, or an account of the existence and characteristics of a specific commercial product, etc.)?\n\nIs the work a good “fit” for the Transactions on Plasma Science, and of interest to its readership?\n\nIs this work overall appropriate for publication in the Transactions on Plasma Science?\n\nShould this work be placed in the Correspondence section rather than as a full paper? Correspondences typically fall into two primary categories. One category is for comments on a previously published paper. The other category is for short papers that describe new ideas or results that are particularly newsworthy or of interest to the community, but with insufficient content to warrant a full paper. The length is typically expected to be less than 2 (or perhaps in special cases 3) journal pages.\n\nManuscript Preparation\n\nDetailed information for the preparation of manuscripts for TPS is provided at https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-journal-article/.\n\nNote particularly that the abstract must be a concise yet comprehensive reflection of what is in your article. In particular:\n\nThe abstract must be self-contained, without abbreviations, footnotes, or references. It should be a microcosm of the full article.\n\nThe abstract must be between 150-250 words. Be sure that you adhere to these limits; otherwise, you will need to edit your abstract accordingly.\n\nThe abstract must be written as one paragraph, and should not contain displayed mathematical equations or tabular material.\n\nThe abstract should include three or four different keywords or phrases, as this will help readers to find it. It is important to avoid over-repetition of such phrases as this can result in a page being rejected by search engines.\n\nEnsure that your abstract reads well and is grammatically correct.\n\nIEEE supports the publication of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) author names in the native language alongside the English versions of the names in the author list of an article. For more information, please visit the IEEE Author Center at: https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-article/create-the-text-of-your-article/publishing-author-names-in-native-languages/\n\nManuscripts submitted for review should be in 2-column journal format, according to the standard IEEE template for all Transactions, also available at: https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-article/use-authoring-tools-and-ieee-article-templates/ieee-article-templates/templates-for-transactions/\n\nSubmission Procedure\n\nAll manuscripts must be submitted to the TPS online peer review system at http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tps-ieee. Instructions on the use of this web site are available at that URL. During the submission process, authors will be asked what type of manuscript they are submitting, i.e., what technical area the manuscript is associated with. These areas are:\n\nBasic Processes in Fully and Partially Ionized Plasmas\n\nMicrowave Generation and Microwave-Plasma Interaction\n\nCharged Particle Beams and Sources\n\nHigh Energy Density Plasmas and Their Interactions\n\nIndustrial, Commercial, and Biological (non-medical) Applications of Plasmas\n\nPlasma Diagnostics\n\nPulsed Power Science and Technology\n\nArcs and MHD\n\nSpace Plasmas\n\nDusty Plasmas\n\nFusion Science and Technology\n\nElectromagnetic Launch Science and Technology\n\nTerahertz Science & Technology\n\nComputational Methods\n\nOther Areas of Plasma Science\n\nIf the submitting author is unsure which manuscript type best describes the manuscript, he/she should choose the “Other Areas of Plasma Science” manuscript type. The Editor-in-Chief will then assess the suitability of the manuscript for TPS and assign it to the most appropriate category. TPS also regularly publishes special issues based upon manuscripts presented at a particular conference (e.g., International Conference on Plasma Science, Pulsed Power Conference, Symposium of Fusion Engineering, etc.) or in a particular subject area. A temporary Manuscript Type category is created for a limited time for authors from those conferences or in those subject areas to submit their work to the corresponding special issue.\n\nHelp/Questions about Web Submission: Questions about or help with problems using the submission web site http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tps-ieee should be directed to tps-editor@ieee.org\n\nHelp/Questions about TPS Policy: Questions about TPS policies should be directed to the TPS Editor-in-Chief, Dr. Edl Schamiloglu, at schamiloglu@me.com.\n\nReview Process\n\nThe articles in this journal are peer reviewed in accordance with the requirements set forth in the IEEE Publication Services and ProductsBoard Operations Manual (https://pspb.ieee.org/images/files/files/opsmanual.pdf). Each published article is reviewed by a minimum of two independent reviewers using a single-blind peer review process, where the identities of the reviewers are not known to the authors, but the reviewers know the identities of the authors. Articles will be screened for plagiarism before acceptance.\n\nEditorial Board\n\nEditor-in-Chief:\n\nEdl Schamiloglu\n\nBasic Processes in Fully and Partially Ionized Plasmas\n\nSenior Editor: Taccogna, Francesco – CNR-Nanotec, Bari, Italy\n\nMicrowave Generation and Microwave-Plasma Interactions\n\nSenior Editor: Leopold, John – Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel\n\nCharged Particle Beams and Sources\n\nSenior Editor: Ekdahl, Carl – Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico USA\n\nHigh Energy Density Plasmas and Their Interactions\n\nSenior Editor: Beg, Farhat — University of California, San Diego, San Diego, California USA\n\nIndustrial, Commercial, and Biological Applications of Plasmas\n\nSenior Editor: Lopez, Jose – Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey USA\n\nPlasma Diagnostics\n\nSenior Editor: Portillo, Sal – University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico USA\n\nPulsed Power Science and Technology\n\nSenior Editor: Joshi, Ravi – Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas USA\n\nArcs and MHD\n\nSenior Editor: Domonkos, Matthew – Verus Research, Albuquerque, New Mexico USA\n\nSpace Plasmas\n\nSenior Editor: Lai, Shu – Hanscom Air Force Base (retired), Massachusetts, USA\n\nDusty Plasmas\n\nSenior Editor: Hyde, Truell — Baylor University, Waco, Texas USA\n\nFusion Science & Technology\n\nSenior Editor: Kovari, Michael – UKAEA, Culham Science Centre, Abingdon Oxfordshire, United Kingdom\n\nElectromagnetic Launch Science & Technology\n\nSenior Editor: Hegeler, Frank – Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC USA\n\nTerahertz Science and Technology\n\nSenior Editor: Chang, Chao Xi’an Jaotong University, Xi’an, Shaanxi, China\n\nComputational Methods\n\nSenior Editor: Portillo, Sal University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico USA\n\nReview Papers\n\nSenior Editor: Schamiloglu, Edl – University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico USA\n\nSocial Media\n\nSenior Editor: Shannon, Stephen – North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina USA\n\nOther Areas of Plasma Science\n\nSenior Editor: Edl Schamiloglu\n\nUpcoming Special Issues\n\nMarch 2024 (tentative) – Special Issue on Selected papers from Third International Conference on Advances in Plasma Science and Technology – Senior Editor: Edl Schamiloglu; Guest Editors: K.
