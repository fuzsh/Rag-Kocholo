        "text": "DC01\n\nWith the royalties from G-Force sales, James Dyson was able to set up his own company, Dyson Ltd. In 1993 he opened his own research centre and factory in the Cotswolds, and set to work making a new vacuum – one that would capture even smaller particles of dust. It was called DC01, for ‘Dual Cyclone’, and it was the first vacuum cleaner to maintain 100% of suction 100% of the time.\n\n1*Suction test based on IEC 60312-1, 5.8 and 5.9 loaded to bin full. Comparison against cordless stick vacuums.\n\n2Tested to EN1822.\n\n3Historically, manufacturers based “no loss of suction” claims on a single test that can be completed before a vacuum’s bin is full."
