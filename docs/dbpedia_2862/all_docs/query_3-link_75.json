        "text": "Nikhil Koratkar’s research has focused on the discovery and investigation of novel materials with superior properties. These include zero-dimensional (fullerene), one-dimensional (carbon nanotubes), two-dimensional (graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, phosphorene, tellurene, MXenes) as well as bulk (chalcogenide perovskites, covalent organic frameworks and high entropy alloy) material systems. Nikhil is studying the fundamental mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical, optoelectronic and electrochemical properties of these materials and developing a variety of composites, coating and energy storage device applications using these materials.\n\nTo date, Nikhil Koratkar has co-authored over 250 archival journal publications. These include 2 in Nature, 1 in Science, 1 in Nature Reviews Materials, 3 in Nature Materials, 5 in Nature Communications and 2 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. To date, Nikhil’s papers have received > 36,000 citations (Google Scholar) and his H-index is 90. Over his career, Nikhil has secured 40 research grants (with 36 as Principal Investigator), totaling ~$11 Million. Twenty-two of these grants are from the USA National Science Foundation (NSF). These funds were used to primarily support Ph.D. students and to date a total of 30 Ph.D. students have graduated with Nikhil Koratkar as their thesis advisor. His former students are employed by some of the world’s most successful companies including Apple, Google, Tesla, GE, Boeing, Samsung, Exxon Mobil, Intel and IBM. His Ph.D. students have also won many high-profile awards including the MIT-Lemelson student prize, the Amelia Earhart fellowship and several MRS graduate student awards. Two of his former students are full professors in academia.\n\nNikhil is very active in the materials science community. Since 2010, he has served as an Editor of the Elsevier journal Carbon. In 2009, Nikhil won the Electrochemical Society’s SES Young Investigator Award for research excellence and in 2015, Nikhil was honored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) with their Gustus Larson Memorial Award for research excellence. In 2016, Nikhil was elected ASME Fellow. In 2018 and in 2021, Nikhil was named by Clarivate Analytics in their Highly Cited Researchers List (Top 1% by citations). In 2019, Nikhil was awarded the Distinguished Alumnus Award by his alma mater, the Indian Institute of Technology- Bombay and in 2021, he was awarded the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s William H. Wiley 1866 Distinguished Faculty Award. In 2021, Nikhil was elected a Fellow of the American Association for Advancement of Science (AAAS) and in 2023, he was elected a Fellow of American Physical Society (APS).\n\nOver 100 media reports citing Nikhil Koratkar’s work have appeared in major outlets such as: NY Times, USA today, MSNBC, Nature News, Scientific American, Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, Indian Express, the Economic Times and US News & World Report. Nikhil has been interviewed by BBC Radio and Northeast Public Radio and by CBS and ABC TV News in Albany, NY. The United States National Science Foundation has also issued three separate Press Releases publicizing his NSF-funded research discoveries.\n\nNikhil Koratkar’s work in battery materials is finding important practical applications. He has five Patents and several pending patent applications. He is a Co-Founder and serves on the Advisory Board of a battery start-up company (Alsym Energy), which has developed and is commercializing a new class of aqueous batteries for grid energy storage. Alsym Energy based in Woburn, MA has completed two major funding rounds (totaling ~$110 Million), employs over 70 full-time employees, and has begun manufacturing battery prototypes for customer evaluation. Alsym’s aqueous battery chemistry avoids lithium and cobalt, and takes advantage of readily available materials that are inherently non-flammable and non-toxic, reducing costs and increasing safety and sustainability.\n\nOver 100 reports citing Koratkar’s work have appeared in top media outlets including Nature News, NY times, USA today, MSNBC, Scientific American, Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, the Indian Express, Wikipedia and the US News and World Report. Koratkar has been interviewed by BBC Radio and Northeast Public Radio and by CBS and ABC TV News in Albany, NY. The USA National Science Foundation has also issued three Press Releases based on his work in nano-composites, Lithium-ion batteries and graphene.\n\nFew sample media reports are given below:\n\n(1) “Water + acid + graphene = power”, Nature, Volume: 476, Page: 255, Date published: (18 August 2011), doi:10.1038/476255f (Research Highlight)\n\n(2) “Nanorods make boiling better”, Published by Nature in their News Section (doi:10.1038/news.2008.935), July 4, 2008.\n\n(3) “Nanorods enhance boiling”,BBC Radio’s Science in Action Program, July 4, 2008.\n\n(4) “Pot boiler: a new, faster way to heat water”, Scientific American, July 8, 2008.\n\n(5) “Carbon nanotube 'shock absorbers' excel at dampening vibration”, Press Release issued by the National Science Foundation, January 2005.\n\n(6) “Leap in sniffing: nanotubes can name that gas”, New York Times, Aug 19, 2003.\n\n(7) “Handheld bioterror detectors in the works”, Article in USA Today, July 7, 2003.\n\n(8) “'Nanoscoops' Could Spark New Generation of Electric Automobile Batteries”, US News and World Report, January 5, 2011.\n\n(9) “Potassium Metal Batteries Are Almost As Good As Lithium-Ion”, Popular Mechanics, March 4, 2020.\n\n(10) “Graphene-coated sensors to strike oil”, MSNBC, July 2011.\n\n(11) “Miracle Material”, Press release by the National Science Foundation, May 19, 2011.\n\n(12) “'Nanoscoops Could Spark New Generation of Electric Automobile Batteries”, Press release issued by the National Science Foundation, January 4, 2011.\n\n(13) “Graphene’s other transparency”, Nature Asia-Pacific, January 23, 2012.\n\n(14) “Graphene Foam Sensors Cheaply Detect Trace Particles in Air Better Than Current Technology”, Popular Science, 23rd November, 2011.\n\n(15) “Controlling the movement of water through nanotube membranes”, Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, 2007.\n\n(16) “New way to create fast-charging lithium-ion batteries discovered”, Article in the Indian Express, April, 2019."
