They cover a broad range of topics from the basics of continuous-variable optical quantum entanglement and a multiplexing methodology for the generation of large-scale quantum entanglement to future approaches toward practical usages of large-scale optical quantum entanglement. The content includes both pedagogical content and the search for future directions beyond the current frontier.\n\nWarit Asavanant and Akira Furusawa\n\nPhys. Rev. A 109, 040101 (2024)\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nEditorial: Enhancing Physical Review A Letters\n\nJanuary 4, 2023\n\nPhysical Review A is excited to offer better visibility and a tailored abstract for our popular Letter articles.\n\nLETTER\n\nProcess of dissociation of NH3 by electron impact in low-temperature plasma and its isotope effect\n\nThe authors present a theoretical approach to investigate the dissociation of the ammonia molecule following a collision with a low-energy electron. The approach could be used to model the process for other molecules in low-temperature plasma.\n\nXianwu Jiang et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L020803 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nViolations of the v-representability condition underlying Kohn-Sham density-functional theory\n\nThe authors demonstrate that Kohn-Sham density-functional theory in its original form is not applicable to many open-shell atoms because no proper Kohn-Sham model system obeying the Aufbau principle exists. Perspectives to deal with this situation are outlined.\n\nEgor Trushin, Jannis Erhard, and Andreas Görling\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L020802 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nNonreciprocal dynamics and the non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs\n\nThe authors investigate the dynamics of an interacting bosonic chain which can be made non-reciprocal through engineered coupling to the environment. They show the presence of directional motion both for single bosons and repulsively bound pairs, which can be exploited to make the two move in opposite directions.\n\nPietro Brighi and Andreas Nunnenkamp\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L020201 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nConversion of twistedness from light to atoms\n\nThe authors theoretically demonstrate that the quantum state of structured light can be transferred to the highly coherent atomic beam when structured photons are absorbed by a bound electron. The proposed scheme allows complex shaping of the atomic wavefront.\n\nS. S. Baturin and A. V. Volotka\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L020801 (2024)\n\nANNOUNCEMENT\n\nAPS Releases Refreshed Data Availability Policy for the Physical Review Journals\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\nThe policy requires authors to explain where research data can be found starting Sept. 4.\n\nRead More\n\nMore News\n\nEDITORS' SUGGESTION\n\nSpin noise spectroscopy of an alignment-based atomic magnetometer\n\nThe authors propose a stochastic theoretical model that explains the dynamics of an alignment-based atomic magnetometer and verify the model in a series of experiments with good agreement. The results could potentially enable alignment-based magnetometers in real-time sensing tasks.\n\nM. Koźbiał et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, 013125 (2024)\n\nEDITORS' SUGGESTION\n\nHomodyne detection is optimal for quantum interferometry with path-entangled coherent states\n\nThe authors propose the use of homodyne detection to detect phase shifts and show that this method is optimal for path-entangled coherent states. This is notable because homodyne measurements do not require photon counting, and the resulting sensitivity is independent of the value of the phase shift itself.\n\nZ. M. McIntyre and W. A. Coish\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L010602 (2024)\n\nEDITORS' SUGGESTION\n\nBeyond the parametric approximation: Pump depletion, entanglement, and squeezing in macroscopic down-conversion\n\nThe authors study the dynamics of the pump mode in the down-conversion Hamiltonian using the cumulant expansion method, perturbation theory, and the full numerical simulation. They obtain the properties of the pump mode, such as depletion, entanglement, and squeezing for an experimentally relevant initial state.\n\nKarthik Chinni and Nicolás Quesada\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, 013712 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nLaser cooling of stored bunched relativistic Li-like oxygen ions\n\nThe authors report on the experimental demonstration of laser cooling of bunched Li-like O^{5+} ion beams at ~64% of the speed of light in a heavy ion storage ring. The laser cooling technique and the simulation method developed in this work pave the way for laser cooling and precision laser spectroscopy experiments at future large heavy ion accelerator facilities.\n\nW. Q. Wen et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L010803 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nRadiative lifetime of the A Π1/22 state in RaF with relevance to laser cooling\n\nThe authors report a lifetime measurement for the lowest-lying excited electronic state of the radioactive molecule RaF. The lifetime of this state is important for designing experiments to demonstrate laser cooling of RaF, which is a key element of proposals for sensitive searches of new physics in the future.\n\nM. Athanasakis-Kaklamanakis et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L010802 (2024)\n\nEDITORS' SUGGESTION\n\nQuantum electrodynamics of lossy magnetodielectric samples in vacuum: Modified Langevin noise formalism\n\nIn this work, the author develops an alternative to the Langevin noise formalism of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics in such a way that the bare photon fluctuations are separated from those of the medium polaritons.\n\nA. Ciattoni\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, 013707 (2024)\n\nLETTER\n\nDissipative Dicke time crystals: An atom’s point of view\n\nThe authors develop a non-equilibrium quantum theory for atoms with time-periodic cavity-mediated interactions and dissipation by eliminating the photonic modes. Their theory describes accurately the relaxation into stable time-crystalline steady states and is used to predict the phase transition lines.\n\nSimon B. Jäger, Jan Mathis Giesen, Imke Schneider, and Sebastian Eggert\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L010202 (2024)\n\nEDITORS' SUGGESTION\n\nQuantum optimal control of squeezing in cavity optomechanics\n\nThe authors show how to use optimal control theory to maximize squeezing in an optomechanical setup with two external drives and determine how fast the mechanical mode can be squeezed. The results provide a clear recipe for experimentalists to achieve optimized quantum control in such optomechanical systems.\n\nAnton Halaski, Matthias G. Krauss, Daniel Basilewitsch, and Christiane P. Koch\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, 013512 (2024)\n\nEDITORS' SUGGESTION\n\nModified mean-field ansatz for charged polarons in a Bose-Einstein condensate\n\nThe authors propose a method to study charged Bose polarons that emerge from the interaction between an ion and a Bose-Einstein condensate based on a mean-field approach in a co-moving frame. The method allows obtaining the ground state and induced interactions between ions mediated by the bath and can be applied to dynamical scenarios, which may otherwise be challenging with other numerical techniques.\n\nUbaldo Cavazos Olivas, Luis A. Peña Ardila, and Krzysztof Jachymski\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, L011301 (2024)\n\nEDITORS' SUGGESTION\n\nDisentanglement-induced multistability\n\nMultistability is experimentally observed in a variety of quantum systems but cannot be derived from any theoretical model that is based on a monostable master equation. The author investigates the relation between disentanglement and multistability in the few-spin transverse Ising model and finds that multistability can be obtained in the presence of spontaneous disentanglement.\n\nEyal Buks\n\nPhys. Rev. A 110, 012439 (2024)\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nEditorial: Coauthor! Coauthor!\n\nMay 21, 2024\n\nWhen determining the authorship list for your next paper, be generous yet disciplined.\n\nAPS Announces Outstanding Referees for 2024\n\nAPS has selected 156 Outstanding Referees for 2024 who have demonstrated exceptional work in the assessment of manuscripts published in the Physical Review journals. A full list of the Outstanding Referees is available online.\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nEditorial: Introducing Perspective Articles\n\nApril 18, 2022\n\nThree journals are excited to announce a new article type, “Perspectives,” to provide forward-looking views of cutting-edge science that has recently emerged or is enjoying renewed activity.\n\nSpecial Collection on Laser-Plasma Particle Acceleration\n\nWe are very pleased to offer the readers of Physical Review a new, carefully curated collection of articles from the vibrant field of laser-plasma particle acceleration. Some of the articles have already been published, and others will be forthcoming. This Collection is the latest in the journal’s series of Special Collections on current or emerging fields and topics."
