        "text": "Professor Webb received his B.A. degree from the University of Pennsylvania and his M.A. (1970) and Ph.D. (1972) from Princeton University. He has held positions as an adjunct assistant professor at UCLA and research associate and assistant professor at Princeton University. He joined the Texas A&M faculty in 1980. Dr. Webb's research interests are in experimental high-energy particle physics; searching for super heavy GUT magnetic monopoles in cosmic rays using the MACRO detector at the Gran Sasso Laboratory; studies of proton-antiproton interactions at the Fermilab Collider and the design of new high-performance detectors. From 1995 -2008, Dr. Webb has been involved with the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment, MINOS, carried out using Fermilab's Main Injector accelerator. This experiment was designed to answer directly the question concerning whether or not neutrinos have mass in the range being indicated in recent atmospheric neutrino experiments. MINOS formally presented its first results on neutrino oscillations at Fermi Lab in March 2006 and has since that time produced the most precise measurements of the neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillation properties. More recently, Dr. Webb has returned to his study of exotic forms of matter in cosmic rays. With faculty colleague, James White, they have joined the Large Underground Xenon Dark Matter Detector (LUX) being staged at the Sanford Underground Laboratory in Lead, SD. This experiment uses a two-phase liquid Xenon detector to search for the feeble impacts of DM WIMPs as they pass through the detector. LUX has just concluded its 300+ day data-taking run and recently announced the most sensitive limits on the abundance of WIMP dark matter yet achieved. With the data taking of LUX now completed, a new and expanded collaboration is now engaged in building a much larger detector (LZ) to push the search for dark matter to even lower sensitivity levels. The LZ detector will use 10 tonnes of liquid xenon to search for WIMP dark matter and is scheduled to be commissioned underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in 2020.\n\nResearch in the Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) Laboratory at Texas A&M is aimed at developing a comprehensive experimental picture of the structure and electronic properties of III-V semiconductor surfaces and interfaces. Our current work has taken advantage of the nanometer-scale spatial resolution afforded by STM to advance our understanding of two especially significant problems in III-V epitaxial growth: the precise structure of the interfaces in type-II semiconductor superlattices and quantum wells, and the onset of atomic ordering in III-V semiconductor alloys. Dr. Weimer received his S.B. degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1976, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the California Institute of Technology in 1978 and 1986, respectively. He held a postdoctoral research fellowship at Caltech from 1986 through 1988 before joining the physics faculty. Dr. Weimer was a 1989 recipient of an ONR Young Investigator Award, and has served on the Program Committee for the International Conference on Scanning Tunneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy as well as the Governing Board of the Nanometer Science and Technology Division of the American Vacuum Society. He is an active member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society, the American Vacuum Society, the Materials Research Society, and Sigma Xi.\n\nProf. Zubairy's research interests include quantum optics and laser physics. He has been interested in quantum optical applications to quantum computing and quantum informatics. He has also been interested in quantum state measurement of the radiation field and sub-wavelength atom localization. His other interests include coherent atomic effects and quantum thermodynamics. He is the co-author of two books, one on Quantum Optics and the other on Quantum Computing Devices. Recently he published a book on Quantum Mechanics for Beginners. Prof. Zubairy received his Ph.D. from the University of Rochester in 1978 working under the supervision of Prof. Emil Wolf. He held research and teaching appointments at the Optical Sciences Center of the University of Arizona and the Center for Advanced Studies at the University of New Mexico before joining the Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan in 1984. He served as Professor of Electronics and the founding Chairman of the Department of Electronics at the Quaid-i-Azam University. In 2000 he joined Texas A and M University where he is presently a University Distinguished Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the holder of the Munnerlyn-Heep Chair in Quantum Optics. He has received many honors including the Willis E. Lamb Award for Laser Science and Quantum Optics, Alexander von Humboldt Research Prize, the Outstanding Physicist Award from the Organization of Islamic Countries, the Abdus Salam Prize in Physics, the International Khwarizmi Award from the President of Iran, the Orders of Hilal-e-Imtiaz and Sitara-e-Imtiaz from the President of Pakistan, and the George H. W. Bush Award for Excellence in International Research. He is an elected member of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Physical Society and the Optical Society of America.\n\nI work in the area of experimental high energy physics, which embarks on the fundamental understanding of the world around us by studying its smallest building blocks and forces that keep these blocks together. In big picture terms, we are trying to understand how the world around us is built and why, including the origin of masses, nature of the mysterious dark matter. To answer these fundamental questions we build large accelerators that smash particles at near the speed of light velocities. We then study the results of such collisions to search for new fundamental particles and study the forces that arise between the particles as they interact. In the past 50 years, nearly major discoveries in particle physics came from collider experiments. These experiments remain to be one of the most promising techniques for studying high-energy physics. I joined Texas A&M University in 2006 and since then built one of the largest experimental high energy physics single PI university programs in the US with an annual budget of over $500K. My personal physics interests focus on searches for the Higgs boson, the \"God particle\", and other kinds of \"new\" physics including Supersymmetry at CERN LHC collider. Members of my group and I work on the CMS experiment located at CERN (Switzerland) respectively. In addition to analyzing data, we work on building parts of these gigantic detectors with a special emphasis on the development of high-speed electronics for the CMS muon trigger, which we design and build in our electronics shop.\n\nProfessor Saslow's research is in the theory of condensed matter physics. Currently, this includes spintronics (Spin Hall Effect; spin-pumping and spin-transfer torque); magnetism in thin films; charge transport in multi-carrier systems (including semiconductors, mixed ionic-electronic conductors, and biological systems); electrical properties of small systems (e.g., quantum dots, buckyballs, thin wires, nanotubes). He has also published in: random magnetic systems (spin glasses, disordered ferromagnets, and re-entrant spin glasses); superfluidity in 3He and 4He; and transport processes at low temperatures. This work comprises well over 100 research articles -- many of them single author. He has also written 10 pedagogical articles, three of which have made the American Journal of Physics' Most Memorable list. He has also written an introductory textbook for well-prepared physics majors and honors students: \"Electricity, Magnetism, and Light\". In addition to careful treatments of the usual topics, it contains retro but correct treatments (a la J. J. Thomson) of voltaic cells, and of the exterior magnetic fields of magnets via magnetic poles; nineteenth century (e.g. J. C. Maxwell) derivations of the laws of the magnetism of electric currents; and discusses the successes and failures (in light of quantum mechanics) of the electric fluid model.\n\nProf. Strigari's research is in the fields of astroparticle physics and cosmology, with a focus on neutrinos and dark matter. Strigari is interested in searches for new physics via neutrino interactions, and searches for dark matter via direct and indirect methods. Since joining Texas A&M, Strigari has been a member of the Dark Energy Survey, focusing on interpreting data from the Local Group and Milky Way satellite galaxies. He uses cosmological simulations to study the theoretical properties of dark matter and faint satellite galaxies. Strigari is also interested in high energy gamma-ray astrophysics, in particular using Fermi-LAT data to identify and model new gamma-ray sources.\n\nMy colleagues and I are endeavoring to build an astronomical observatory at Dome A, the highest point in Antarctica. We hope to set up several telescopes in the coming years to study the mysterious dark energy in the universe. My research interests include spectropolarimetry observations of supernovae. The supernovae I study are so far away that even the largest telescopes in the world cannot resolve their shapes through direct imaging. Spectropolarimetry is a technique that enables geometric structures of supernovae to be studied. I am also doing research on machine learning enabled studies of large astronomical data sets and am a member of the TAMIDS Scientific Machine Learning Lab. I lead the DECam Search for Intermediate Redshift Transients (DESIRT), which uses DECam to find transients and DESI to carry out spectral follow-ups. Most excitingly, I am working on finding high redshift transients using the JWST. We expect new, exciting data to become available very soon!\n\nWilliam G. Unruh is a professor of physics at the University of British Columbia. His research includes contributions to general relativity and, with Stephen Hawking, refining the foundations of quantum mechanics in relation to black holes. Unruh is a Fellow of the Royal Society of both London and Canada and is a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He holds the Rutherford Medal from the Royal Society of Canada as well as the Herzberg Medal and the Medal of Achievement from the Canadian Association of Physicists. Unruh will collaborate with faculty and students in the College of Science."
