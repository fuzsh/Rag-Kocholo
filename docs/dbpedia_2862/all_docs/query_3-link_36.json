The papers will be peer reviewed. Accepted papers will appear online immediately after proof processing and published in the next open issue of JVST B and also be grouped into the online Collection.\n\nPapers will be reviewed according to criteria set by the JVST and must meet JVST standards for both technical content and written English. All manuscripts are reviewed to the same standards as regular JVST submissions. Submit your manuscripts to the JVST B journal, chosen for your specific conference, using the journals' online manuscript submission system, the JVST Peer X-Press site.\n\nhttp://jvstb.peerx-press.org\n\nIn preparing your article, you should follow the instructions for contributors, which may be found on the Information for Contributors link below. Click here for Information for Contributors.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to use the JVST templates. The easiest way to prepare your manuscript is to use the available JVST Article Template to delete and replace text as necessary.\n\nClick here for the JVST Article Templates for MS Word and LaTeX.\n\nNote that acceptance to present at the conference does not guarantee the acceptance of the manuscript. To be published in JVST, the manuscript must:\n\n(1) present original findings, conclusions or analysis that have not been published previously by the authors or others,\n\n(2) be free of errors and ambiguities,\n\n(3) support conclusions with data and analysis,\n\n(4) be written clearly, and\n\n(5) have high impact in its field, which must be within the scope of topics covered by the journal.\n\nIt is very IMPORTANT that authors indicate to which Conference Collection the paper is submitted. Online, you will have an opportunity to tell us that your paper is a part of a conference by choosing \"Conference/Special Topic\" under the article type and then the conference special collection name from a list.\n\nAcceptable manuscript file types are MSWord, LaTeX, and PDF. For the initial submission/review process, a single PDF or MSWord file with embedded figures is needed. However, once a paper is accepted, MSWord or TeX file of the text, any tables and the list of figure captions along with the separate figure files will be required for final production. Use of color in figures is encouraged.\n\nFigures appear online in color for free. Prepare illustrations in the final published size, not oversized or undersized.\n\nFor any other details about manuscript preparation, please refer to the JVST B journal web page, Author tab, Information for Contributors.\n\nManuscript deadline: 08 May 2020 10 April 2020\n\nSUBMIT MANUSCRIPT to: http://jvstb.peerx-press.org"
