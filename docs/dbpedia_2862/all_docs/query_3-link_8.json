        "text": "The pipe coming out of the wall appears to be PVC.\n\nCut the PVC pipe just at where it meets the ABS (black) pipe.\n\nGet a trap adapter to glue to the pvc pipe. 1 1/2 hub to a 1 1/4 inlet. (Most Bath sinks take a 1 1/4\" trap.)\n\nRemove all the black pipe from the sink tailpiece. Replace it with a 1 1/4 bath p-trap kit. It has everything you need to connect the sink drain tail into the adapter on the pipe from the wall. It needs no glue. This is all screw on fittings using supplied washers. Follow supplied directions.\n\nYou may need a tailpiece extender (also 1 1/4) if the tail from the sink is too short.\n\nDry fit everything before gluing the adapter. Just snug all fittings to allow adjustment. Then tighten everything when you are confident it all fits. Hand tight is usually all they need.\n\nUse a bottle trap.\n\nFirst try what rmdman suggests in another answer. If you can make that work, it's preferable. The trap kit suggested there is cheap and if it doesn't work it won't kill you to have a spare.\n\nBottle traps vary in exact size and shape, and vary wildly in price. You should be able to find one that isn't outrageously expensive and where the bottom of the trap fits inside the pedestal unlike the P trap.\n\nIt's not the best but your other options are to move the basin to the side so the trap can go outside it, or to move the wall drain up so a P trap fits in the pedestal or get a new sink."
