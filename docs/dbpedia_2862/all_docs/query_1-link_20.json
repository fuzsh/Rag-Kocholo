        "text": "Overview\n\nThe AVS International Symposium & Exhibition is the premier forum for the presentation and discussion of the science and technology of materials, interfaces, and processing.\n\nWhy Attend – 2022\n\nThe show addresses cutting edge issues associated with materials, processing and interfaces in both the research and manufacturing communities. The weeklong Symposium fosters a multidisciplinary environment that cuts across traditional boundaries between disciplines, featuring papers from AVS Technical Division, Groups, Focus Topics on emerging technologies and more.\n\nThe Symposium will cover methods for controllable defect formation, studies of their stability, and techniques for their characterization.\n\nIn addition, there will be sessions in several innovative topical areas. Focus Topics at this meeting include: 2D Materials; Actinides and Rare Earths; Atomic Scale Processing; Fundamental Discoveries in Heterogeneous Catalysis; Advanced Ion Microscopy and Ion Beam Nano-Engineering; New Trends in Structural and Electronic Characterization of Materials, Interfaces, and Surfaces Using Synchrotron and FEL Based Light Sources; Chemical Analysis and Imaging at Interfaces; Spectroscopic Ellipsometry; and for the first time, Radiation Effects on Materials.\n\nAlso, there will be a Quantum Information Science Focus Topic that is connected with the AVS Quantum Science (AQS) journal, and a Mini Symposium on Synthesis of 2D Materials and Device Structures.\n\nAs well as the technical program, there will be an extensive equipment and vendor exhibition, short courses, and many networking and career advancement and recruitment events for those launching their careers as well as for established researchers.\n\nAn extensive Exhibition of related equipment, tools, materials, supplies, chemicals, services, consulting, technical literature, and new technologies are showcased during the week.\n\nWhy Exhibit – 2022\n\nBy exhibiting at the show, exhibitors get an opportunity for showing new technology and research methods to a target audience.\n\nOrganizer\n\nFounded in 1953, American Vacuum Society (AVS) is organized into technical divisions and technical groups that encompass a range of established as well as emerging science and technology areas. There are also regional chapters, international chapters and affiliates, and student chapters that promote communication and networking for professionals and students within a geographical region.\n\nSource: Event Website"
