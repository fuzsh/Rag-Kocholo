        "text": "Vacuum technology is critical for manufacturing high tech products like semiconductors, optics, health care technology, architectural glass and more. Thin film technology is a specialized area within this category.\n\nYour first vacuum technology course will set you on a path to earning an associate degree in thin film and vacuum technology in two years. Classes involve engineering, math, computer technology, chemistry and more. Yes, you can learn them!\n\nYou will develop useful knowledge and skills through hands-on learning in and out of your vacuum technology classes; they were created through partnerships with local companies.\n\nImagine this: In two years, you will have an associate degree in vacuum and thin film technology and be ready to work in a good paying job. In Minnesota, the annual median salary for technicians is $41,925. And because Normandale offers the only two-year vacuum and thin film technology program in the nation, youâ€™ll find a job quickly."
