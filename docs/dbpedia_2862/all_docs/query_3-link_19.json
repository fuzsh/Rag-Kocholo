This study proposes a novel pulse transient method based on a fractional derivative model derived on physical fractal space, incorporating operator algebra and the mechanics–electricity analogy to derive a new control equation that more accurately delineates the permeability evolution in coal. To validate the approach, permeability experiments were conducted on coal samples under mining stress conditions. The results showed that the adoption of a physically meaningful fractional-order relaxation equation provides a more accurate description of non-Darcy flow behaviour in rocks than traditional integer-order control equations. Additionally, the method proved effective across different rock types, verifying its broad applicability. By establishing a new theoretical foundation, this approach illustrates how the microscale fractal structure of rocks is fundamentally linked to their macroscale fractional responses, thereby enhancing the understanding of fractional modelling methods in rock mechanics and related domains.

Utilizing the Banach contraction mapping principle, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the considered problem. Additionally, employing Schauder’s fixed-point theorem, we demonstrate the existence of solutions within the framework of β-Banach spaces. Moreover, we examine the β–Ulam–Hyers stability of the solutions, providing insights into the stability behavior under small perturbations. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the theoretical results obtained.

Existing automated crack detection models depend on large quantities of precisely annotated crack sample data. The irregular morphology of cracks makes manual annotation time-consuming and costly, thereby posing challenges to the practical application of these models. This study proposes a pavement crack image detection method integrating fractal dimension analysis and semi-supervised learning. It identifies the self-similarity characteristics within the crack regions by analyzing pavement crack images and using fractal dimensions to preliminarily determine the candidate crack regions. The Crack Similarity Learning Network (CrackSL-Net) is then employed to learn the semantic similarity of crack image regions. Semi-supervised learning facilitates automatic crack detection by combining a small amount of labeled data with a large volume of unlabeled image data. Comparative experiments are conducted on two public pavement crack datasets against the HED, U-Net, and RCF models to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results indicate that, with a 50% annotation ratio, the proposed method achieves high-precision crack detection, with an intersection over union (IoU) exceeding 0.84, which is close to that of U-Net. Visual analysis of the detection results confirms the method’s effectiveness in identifying cracks in complex environments.

This model is used to explain waves in shallow water, fluid dynamics, and other areas. We obtain kink, bright, singular, and other types of exact wave solutions using the modified extended direct algebraic method and the improved (G′/G)-expansion method. Some solutions do not exist. These solutions may be useful in different areas of science and engineering. The results are represented as three-dimensional, contour, and two-dimensional graphs. Stability analysis is also performed to check the stability of the corresponding model. Furthermore, modulation instability analysis is performed to study the stationary solutions of the corresponding model. The results will be helpful for future studies of the corresponding system. The methods used are easy and useful.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of “cha-koji”, green tea leaves fermented with Aspergillus luchuensis, on cutaneous wound healing, using a linear incision wound mouse model. Topical application of autoclave-sterilized cha-koji suspension on the dorsal incision wound area healed the wound significantly faster and, notably, with less scarring than did the green tea or the control distilled water treatment. Further in vitro experiments revealed that the accelerated effects of cha-koji could be attributed to its increased anti-bacterial activity, enhanced epidermal cell proliferation and migration, augmented expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor-β1, reduced expression of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in macrophages, and decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, we conducted a skin sensitizing potential test, which revealed that cha-koji had no adverse effects that posed a sensitizing risk. Thus, cha-koji may have a potent therapeutic effect on cutaneous wound healing, opening up a new avenue for its clinical application as a medical aid.

Despite TAP and Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI) (i.e., the prototype of the Kunitz-type protease inhibitors) sharing a similar 3D fold and disulphide bond topology, they have remarkably different amino acid sequence (only ~24% sequence identity), thermal stability, folding pathways, protease specificity, and even mechanism of protease inhibition. Here, fully active and correctly folded TAP was produced in reasonably high yields (~20%) by solid-phase peptide chemical synthesis and thoroughly characterised with respect to its chemical identity, disulphide pairing, folding kinetics, conformational dynamics, and fXa inhibition. The versatility of the chemical synthesis was exploited to perform structure–activity relationship studies on TAP by incorporating non-coded amino acids at positions 1 and 3 of the inhibitor. Using Hydrogen–Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry, we found that TAP has a remarkably higher conformational flexibility compared to BPTI, and propose that these different dynamics could impact the different folding pathway and inhibition mechanisms of TAP and BPTI. Hence, the TAP/BPTI pair represents a nice example of divergent evolution, while the relative facility of TAP synthesis could represent a good starting point to design novel synthetic analogues with improved pharmacological profiles.

The core of the IOOA algorithm lies in its unique two-color complementary mechanism, which significantly improves the algorithm’s global search capability and optimization performance. Firstly, in the initialization stage, the population is created by combining logistic chaos mapping and the good point set method, and the population is divided into four different color groups by drawing on the four-color theory to enhance the population diversity. Secondly, a two-color complementary mechanism is introduced, where the blue population maintains the OOA core exploration strategy to ensure the stability and efficiency of the algorithm; the red population incorporates the Harris Hawk heuristic strategy in the development phase to strengthen the ability of local minima avoidance; the green group adopts the strolling and wandering strategy in the searching phase to add stochasticity and maintain the diversity; and the orange population implements the optimized spiral search and firefly perturbation strategies to deepen the exploration and effectively perturb the local optimums, respectively, to improve the overall population diversity, effectively perturbing the local optimum to improve the performance of the algorithm and the exploration ability of the solution space as a whole. Finally, to validate the performance of IOOA, classical benchmark functions and CEC2020 and CEC2022 test sets are selected for simulation, and ANOVA is used, as well as Wilcoxon and Friedman tests. The results show that IOOA significantly improves convergence accuracy and speed and demonstrates high practical value and advantages in engineering optimization applications.

Three candidate peptides were subsequently synthesised and characterised as potential drug delivery vehicles. The elastin-derived peptides are Fmoc-FFAAAAKAA-NH2, Fmoc-FFAAAKAA-NH2, and Fmoc-FFAAAKAAA-NH2. All three peptide sequences were able to self-assemble into nanofibers. However, only the first two could form hydrogels, which are preferred as delivery systems compared to solutions. Both of these peptides also exhibited favourable nanofiber lengths of at least 1.86 and 4.57 µm, respectively, which are beneficial for the successful delivery and stability of drugs. The shorter fibre lengths of the third peptide (maximum 0.649 µm) could have inhibited their self-assembly into the three-dimensional networks crucial to hydrogel formation.

Currently, the intra-arterial dispersal and fragmentation behavior of HA gels is unknown but critical to our understanding of the pathomechanism of these injuries. This work introduces the Pulsatile Unit for the Laboratory Simulation of Arterio-embolic Restrictions (PULSAR) and evaluates the intravascular behavior of different HA gels. The fragmentation and dispersal behaviors of four HA gels with distinct rheological properties were evaluated via high-resolution videography and ImageJ particle size and morphology analysis. The gels’ elastic modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), tan(δ), and HA concentration were subsequently correlated with their intra-arterial behaviors. This study effectively confirms the extensive fragmentation of HA gels upon arterial inoculation, with particle sizes ranging from <50 µm to >1 mm. Gel particle size and morphology correlated most significantly with tan(δ). Conversely, arterial flow rates did not significantly influence gel fragmentation behavior, though the probability of proximal, macrovascular obstruction was affected. Overall, this study validates the PULSAR model for simulation of arterial dynamics and the testing of intravascular filler kinematics. The findings demonstrate the ability of gels to microfragment and disseminate distally, as well as induce partial proximal occlusion depending on gel rheology and arterial flow parameters.

The adsorption and desorption isotherms of five Chinese polydextrose products were measured in the range of 0.1–0.9 aw and 20–35 °C by a dynamic moisture sorption analyzer. The results show that the shape of adsorption and desorption isotherms was similar to that of amorphous lactose. In the range of 0.1–0.8 aw, the hysteresis between desorption and adsorption of polydextrose was significant. The sorption isotherms of polydextrose can be fitted by seven commonly used models, and our developed seven-parameter polynomial, the adsorption equations of generalized D’Arcy and Watt (GDW) and Ferro-Fontan, and desorption equations of polynomial and Peleg, performed well in the range of 0.1–0.9 aw. The hysteresis curves of polydextrose at four temperatures quickly decreased with aw increase at aw ˂ 0.5, andthereafter slowly decreased when aw ≥ 0.5. The polynomial fitting hysteresis curves of polydextrose were divided into three regions: ˂0.2, 0.2–0.7, and 0.71–0.9 aw. The addition of 0–10% polydextrose to rice starch decreased the surface adsorption and bulk absorption during the adsorption and desorption of rice starch, while it increased the water adsorption value at aw ≥ 0.7 due to polydextrose dissolution. DSC analysis showed that polydextrose as a gelling agent inhibited the retrogradation of rice starch, which could be used to maintain the quality of cooked rice.

This is primarily because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity. The widespread usage of composite hydrogels is hindered by a lack of simultaneous properties, such as high strength and low swelling rate. Herein, we report the preparation of novel hydrogels composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)–intercalated agar polymer networks physically crosslinked with tannic acid. The hydrogel was subjected to multiple freeze/thaw (F/T) cycles (1, 3, and 5), and it was found to exhibit the highest strength after 5 F/T cycles. After 1 F/T cycle, the tensile strength of the composite hydrogel reached 1.56 MPa with a 1.0 wt% crosslinker, whereas after 5 F/T cycles, it increased to 3.77 MPa with a reduced amount (0.75 wt%) of the crosslinker. In addition, the swelling ability decreased upon increasing the crosslinker content and number of F/T cycles. Furthermore, the hydrogel demonstrated excellent water retention and a strong ability to adhere to different substrates. We have successfully implemented an innovative approach to improve the mechanical properties of PVA-based hydrogels by combining the use of tannic acid as a cross-linking agent and multiple F/T cycles. The developed hydrogels are expected to facilitate new developments in hydrogel technology, thus impacting diverse fields such as biomedical (wound dressing and artificial cartilage).

The effect of three different proteins (soy protein isolate (SPI), pea protein isolate (PPI), and whey protein isolate (WPI)) at different protein levels and processing conditions (heating (90 °C, 1 h) followed by cooling (4 °C, 12 h) and heating (90 °C, 1h) followed by freezing (−18 °C, 12 h)) of konjac glucomannan (KGM) was analyzed. The optimal formulations for simulating tripe were screened by examining their similarity to real tripe in terms of texture, color, and sensory experience. The screened formulations were also subjected to a preliminary mechanistic investigation. The results show that all three proteins improved the gel’s textural properties to varying degrees. At the same concentration, the hardness and chewiness of the KGM/WPI composite gel were significantly higher than those of the other two KGM/protein composite gels, among which the composite gel obtained by adding 8% WPI and 5% KGM heating-frozen (FWK4) had the greatest hardness and chewiness of 4338.07 g and 2313.76, respectively, and the springiness differences in all of the composite gels were small. In addition, the addition of protein increased the whiteness of the hybrid gels, with WPI having the most significant effect on the whiteness of the composite gels (whiteness increased from 30.25 to 62.80 as the concentration of WPI increased from 0 to 10%). Freezing increased composite gel hardness and chewiness, but reduced gel springiness and whiteness. Cluster analysis showed that the composite gel obtained by heating–cooling 8% WPI and 5% KGM (WK4) was very similar to the real tripe in terms of chewiness and whiteness, and WK4 had the highest sensory scores for color, tissue morphology, tactile sensation, taste, and odor. The acceptability score in terms of tissue morphology reached 4.3. Meanwhile, the characterization results of WK4 indicate the presence of large junction areas in the gel network. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, X-ray diffraction, and intermolecular force contributions indicated that the incorporation of WPI promoted integral interactions, and that hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonding played a key role in the WK4 composite gel system. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) also showed that the combination of WPI and konjac glucan resulted in a more compact gel structure. This study is informative for the development of the field of bionic tripe processing.

The concentrations of long-lived reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), namely, H2O2, NO2−, and NO3−, in the PAW were 48.76 mg/L, 0.046 mg/L, and 172.36 mg/L, respectively. Chemically activated water (CAW) with the same concentration of long-lived RONS was also prepared for comparison. A. niger A32 was treated with PAW and CAW. After treatment, the treated strains were observed and analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to screen probable mutants. The results indicated that the pH, conductivity, and ORP values of PAW were 2.42, 1935 μS/cm, and 517.07 mV, respectively. In contrast, the pH and ORP values of CAW were 6.15 and 301.73 mV, respectively, which differed significantly from those of PAW. In addition, the conductivity of CAW showed no change. SEM and TEM analyses revealed that A. niger A32 treated with CAW exhibited less damage compared with the control. In contrast, A. niger A32 treated with PAW showed significant shrinkage, deformation, and exudate attachment over time. Following PAW treatment, after four passages, a high cellulase-producing stable mutant strain A-WW5 was screened, exhibiting a filter paper enzyme activity of 29.66 U/mL, a cellulose endonuclease activity of 13.79 U/mL, and a β-glucosidase activity of 27.13 U/mL. These values were found to be 33%, 38%, and 2.1% higher than those of the original fungus sample, respectively. In total, 116 SNPs and 61 InDels were present in the genome of the mutant strain A-WW5. The above findings indicate that the impact of PAW on A. niger is not only attributed to long-lasting H2O2, NO2−, and NO3− particles but also to other short-lived active particles; PAW is expected to become a new microbial breeding mutagen.

Trichoderma longibrachiatum T6, an important biocontrol fungus, has been demonstrated to effectively parasitize and degrade Heterodera avenae cysts, eggs, and second-stage juveniles (J2s). However, the genes that encoding serine protease and their functions in T. longibrachiatum T6 have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we successfully cloned and sequenced the serine protease gene TlSP1 in T. longibrachiatum T6. Our results revealed that the expression level of the TlSP1 gene was induced and significantly increased in T. longibrachiatum T6 after inoculation with H. avenae cysts. The full-length sequence of the coding region (CDS) of TlSP1 gene was 1230 bp and encoded a protein consisting of 409 amino acids. Upon the transformation of the TlSP1 gene into Pichia pastoris X33, the purified recombinant TlSP1 protein exhibited optimal activity at a temperature of 50 °C and pH 8.0. Following 4–10-day of treatment with the purified recombinant TlSP1 protein, the eggshells and content were dissolved and exuded. The number of nematodes invading wheat roots was reduced by 38.43% in the group treated with both TlSP1 and eggs on one side (P1+N) compared to the control group, while the number of nematodes invading wheat roots was reduced by 30.4% in the TlSP1 and eggs two-sided treatment group (P1/N). Furthermore, both the P1+N and P1/N treatments significantly upregulated genes associated with defense enzymes (TaPAL, TaCAT, TaSOD, and TaPOD), genes involved in the lignin synthesis pathway (TaC4H, Ta4CL2, TaCAD1, and TaCAD12), and salicylic acid (SA)-responsive genes (TaNPR1, TaPR1, and TaPR2) and led to the high expression of jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive genes (TaPR4, TaOPR3, and TaAOS2). This study has highlighted the significant role of the TlSP1 gene in facilitating H. avenae eggshells’ dissolution, preventing nematode invasion in the host plant, and boosting plant resistance in wheat.

Correlating gene expression with an interrogatable and easily observable characteristic such as the surrogate phenotype conferred by a reporter gene is a valuable approach to gaining insight into gene function. Many reporters including lacZ, amdS, and the fluorescent proteins mRuby3 and mNeonGreen have been used across all manners of organisms. Described here is an investigation into the creation of a robust, synthetic, fusion reporter system for Cryptococcus neoformans that combines some of the most useful fluorophores available in this system with the versatility of the counter-selectable nature of amdS. The reporters generated include multiple composition and orientation variants, all of which were investigated for differences in expression. Evaluation of known promoters from the TEF1 and GAL7 genes was undertaken, elucidating novel expression tendencies of these biologically relevant C. neoformans regulators of transcription. Smaller than lacZ but providing multiple useful surrogate phenotypes for interrogation, the fusion ORF serves as a superior whole-cell assay compared to traditional systems. Ultimately, the work described here bolsters the array of relevant genetic tools that may be employed in furthering manipulation and understanding of the WHO fungal priority group pathogen C. neoformans.

Using advanced statistical models from the GARCH family, we analyze the returns of Binance USD, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Solana, Tether, USD Coin, and Ripple. Our findings reveal significant shifts in volatility dynamics and day-of-the-week effects on returns, challenging the notion of market efficiency. Notably, Bitcoin and Solana began exhibiting day-of-the-week effects during the pandemic, whereas Cardano and Dogecoin did not. During the pandemic, Binance USD, Ethereum, Tether, USD Coin, and Ripple showed multiple days with significant day-of-the-week effects. Notably, positive returns were generally observed on Sundays, whereas a shift to negative returns on Mondays was evident during the COVID-19 period. These patterns suggest that exploitable anomalies persist despite the market’s continuous operation and increasing maturity. The presence of a long-term memory in volatility highlights the need for robust trading strategies. Our research provides valuable insights for investors, traders, regulators, and policymakers, aiding in the development of effective trading strategies, risk management practices, and regulatory policies in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

The pathogenesis of veisalgia is not understood and treatment has not yet been established. Occasionally, students take N-acetylcysteine (NAC) before binge drinking to alleviate hangover. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of NAC on serum levels of electrolytes, enzymes, oxidative stress biomarkers and symptoms of veisalgia in binge drinking. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, healthy students were randomly assigned into two groups: one receiving NAC and the other receiving a placebo. Blood samples were taken before drinking, 30 min after a 1.5 h long drinking session, and the subsequent morning. Serum levels of electrolytes, urea, enzymes, ethanol, 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and N-epsilon-hexanoyl-lysine were measured. The participants completed the Acute Hangover Severity Scale (AHSS) assessment based on symptoms, and 40 students (20 male), aged 23 ± 2 years, were included in the study. Their mean blood ethanol concentration was 1.4 g/kg. Serum sodium levels were increased after drinking, and urea decreased the following morning compared to their levels before drinking in both groups. Serum 8-OHdG levels were increased after drinking and remained elevated until the following morning, compared to the levels before drinking, in both groups. NAC had no effect on sodium, urea and 8-OHdG levels or the symptoms of veisalgia. In conclusion, binge drinking causes a transient increase in serum sodium and as a prolonged increase in oxidative marker 8-OHdG levels. NAC had no effect on the sodium and 8-OHdG levels.

Recent advances in understanding people’s emotions expressed through verbal and non-verbal communication are particularly noteworthy in the clinical context for the assessment of patients’ health and well-being. Facial expression recognition (FER) plays an important and vital role in health care, providing communication with a patient’s feelings and allowing the assessment and monitoring of mental and physical health conditions. This paper shows that automatic machine learning methods can predict health deterioration accurately and robustly, independent of human subjective assessment. The prior work of this paper is to discover the early signs of deteriorating health that align with the principles of preventive reactions, improving health outcomes and human survival, and promoting overall health and well-being. Therefore, methods are developed to create a facial database mimicking the underlying muscular structure of the face, whose Action Unit motions can then be transferred to human face images, thus displaying animated expressions of interest. Then, building and developing an automatic system based on convolution neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to recognise patterns of facial expressions with a focus on patients at risk of deterioration in hospital wards. This research presents state-of-the-art results on generating and modelling synthetic database and automated deterioration prediction through FEs with 99.89% accuracy. The main contributions to knowledge from this paper can be summarized as (1) the generation of visual datasets mimicking real-life samples of facial expressions indicating health deterioration, (2) improvement of the understanding and communication with patients at risk of deterioration through facial expression analysis, and (3) development of a state-of-the-art model to recognize such facial expressions using a ConvLSTM model.

Multiple health conditions, multimorbidity, is a growing problem in many populations worldwide. Methods: This paper quantified the effect of community assets on major health conditions for the population of England over six years, at a fine spatial scale using a data analytic approach. Community assets, which included indices of the health system, green space, pollution, poverty, urban environment, safety, and sport and leisure facilities, were quantified in relation to major health conditions. The health conditions examined included high blood pressure, obesity, dementia, diabetes, mental health, cardiovascular conditions, musculoskeletal conditions, respiratory conditions, kidney and liver disease, and cancer. Cluster analysis and dendrograms were calculated for the community assets and major health conditions. For each health condition, a statistical model with all community assets was fitted, and model selection was performed. The number of significant community assets for each health condition was recorded. The unique variance, explained by each significant community asset per health condition, was quantified using hierarchical variance partitioning within an analysis of variance model. Results: The resulting data indicate major health conditions are often clustered, as are community assets. The results suggest that diversity and richness of community assets are key to major health condition outcomes. Primary care service waiting times and distance to public parks were significant predictors of all health conditions examined. Primary care waiting times explained the vast majority of the variances across health conditions, with the exception of obesity, which was better explained by absolute poverty. Conclusions: The implications of the combined findings of the health condition clusters and explanatory power of community assets are discussed. The vast majority of determinants of health could be accounted for by healthcare system performance and distance to public green space, with important covariate socioeconomic factors. Emphases on community approaches, significant relationships, and asset strengths and deficits are needed alongside targeted interventions. Whilst the performance of the public health system remains of key importance, community assets and local infrastructure remain paramount to the broader determinants of health.

The geometric structures such as the second fundamental form, curvatures tensor, mean curvature, statistical Ricci curvature and the relations among them on a statistical submanifold of a statistical manifold equipped with F-statistical connections are examined. The equations of Gauss and Codazzi of F-statistical connections are obtained. Such structures when the statistical submanifolds are conjugate symmetric are discussed. We present a inequality for statistical submanifolds in real space forms with respect to F-statistical connections. Also, we obtain a basic inequality involving statistical Ricci curvature and the squared F-mean curvature of a statistical submanifold of statistical manifolds.

The dual hidden layer neural network structure using the combination of a radial basis and sigmoid function with twenty and forty neurons is presented for the solution of the nonlinear HIV-1-ISCP. The mathematical form of the model is divided into three classes named cancer population cells (T), healthy cells (H), and infected HIV (I) cells. The validity of the designed novel scheme is proven through the comparison of the results. The optimization is performed using a competent scale conjugate gradient procedure, the correctness of the proposed numerical approach is observed through the reference results, and negligible values of the absolute error are around 10−3 to 10−4. The database numerical solutions are achieved from the Runge–Kutta numerical scheme, and are used further to reduce the mean square error by taking 72% of the data for training, while 14% of the data is taken for testing and substantiations. To authenticate the credibility of this novel procedure, graphical plots using different performances are derived.
