AVS is a not-for-profit professional society that promotes communication between academia, government laboratories, and industry for the purpose of sharing research and development findings over a broad range of technologically relevant topics. Our symposia and journals provide an important forum for the dissemination of information in many areas of science and technology-enabling a critical gateway for the rapid insertion of scientific breakthroughs into manufacturing realities.

Founded in 1953, AVS is organized into 10 technical divisions and 3 technical groups that encompass a range of established as well as emerging science and technology areas. There are also 17 local-area chapters that promote communication and networking for professionals and students within a geographical region. AVS is comprised of approximately 6,000 members worldwide and welcomes all member and non-member scientists, technologists, students, and educators to participate in its national and regional events.

AVS promotes communication through its major annual symposium and numerous topical conferences throughout the year. AVS also publishes through the American Institute of Physics (AIP) the prestigious Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology (JVST A and B), which is devoted to reports of original research and review articles, and Surface Science Spectra (SSS), which is devoted to archiving spectra of technological and scientific interest. Technical short courses and educational materials such as videotapes and monographs are also produced.
