        "text": "Examine the image below. A man sits in the middle of a late fourteenth century map, staring at a yellow orb, a nugget of gold. He is clearly a king, for he wears a crown and holds a scepter. To Europeans, these are symbols of kings, and the image was created by the European map-maker Abraham Cresques who lived in Spain around the year 1375. Yet the king is African, not European. He is Mansa Musa I, ruler of the state of Mali, and is possibly the wealthiest man of his time. He probably did not really have a crown or a scepter because these were not West African symbols of kingship. But the gold nugget is accurate because Mansa Musa controlled some of the richest goldfields of this era.\n\nThere were plenty of West African states in this era, but Mansa Musa's Mali is the one that shows up in world history texts because it left behind the most evidence. Mali emerged from a region that had given birth to many states in earlier centuries. Also, unlike North Africa and Europe, the collapse of the Roman Empire was not felt in West Africa. But it certainly had its own political patterns and connections to those other parts of the world. As early as 300 CE, trade routes crossing the Sahara Desert linked North Africa, including Roman controlled regions, to the growing cities in West Africa. These cities, including Jenne-Jeno, were relatively egalitarian and had little centralized authority. But that changed by 800 or 900 CE.\n\nThe region south of the Sahara Desert was known as the Sahel, or sometimes the Western Sudan (this region is far to the west of the current countries of Sudan and Southern Sudan). This was mostly dry grassland, with some wetter areas, including two large rivers called the Senegal and the Niger. Plus there were several lakes in an area known as the Chad Basin1‍. These wet areas could support large populations of people. As usual, that created a need for organization and governance. So different communities built states, sometimes collaboratively, and sometimes forcefully. The earliest we know of was Wagadu, the state we usually call by the title of its ruler, Ghana. Headquartered near the Niger River, it was probably established around the end of the sixth century. Nearby, the city of Gao controlled a region that we know as Kawkaw. Further to the east, a number of communities combined to build the state of Kanem in the Chad Basin around the ninth century. Other states in this region soon followed, and it didn't hurt that many shared the same language, called Hausa. To the west, the state of Takrur was built on the Senegal River around the ninth century. It was sometimes under the control of Wagadu, and sometimes independent.\n\nFirst, these states generally relied on the domination of long-distance trade for the funds they needed to govern and survive. Wagadu, for example, controlled a large portion of the gold trade because it sat in the middle of the trade route that sent the gold north. Most West African gold in this period was mined a hundred miles or so south of Wagadu, and it was in great demand in North Africa and Europe, thousands of miles to the north. Meanwhile, the Hausa states and Kanem controlled the sale of kola nuts, grown in the forests to the south and mostly used as a stimulant in North Africa and the Middle East. (Kola has caffeine and was one of the original ingredients that made Coca-Cola such a stimulating drink!) Takrur controlled regional trade in grain and salt. These states also manufactured goods, especially textiles, but their governments were more focused on trade because it was easier to tax.\n\nSecond, these states all relied on densely populated, wet, grain-producing centers. They had little control over the people in the drier regions around them—most of whom were nomadic herders. The governments of the big states couldn't really rule them, and in fact the nomads sometimes raided or invaded the cities around the lakes and rivers. The most control these governments could exert over the nomads was the occasional demand of tribute, usually in the form of some trade goods, money, or animals.\n\nFinally, all of these states had to deal with religious diversity. From at least the ninth century, Islam was a powerful force in the West African Sudanic zone. It was the religion of the traders from North Africa, and soon some West African merchants became Muslims as well. But most of the people of the Sudan in this period, especially farmers followed local, non-Muslim religions. A few rulers chose to convert to Islam because it was useful for trade and because it had a written language. The Kings of Takrur and Kanem became Muslim by the eleventh century, for example. But most kings did not. Instead, they were very inclusive. Both Muslims and members of local religions served in their courts. Rulers allowed many different sets of rituals, and themselves participated in multiple types of prayers and practices. One of the unique local features that remained important was matrilineality, or tracing one's heritage and ancestry through the mother. At the state level, this included political power for royal queen mothers (the mothers of kings), which was not a normal feature of Islam in many other regions. This flexibility and inclusiveness of faith—known as religious pluralism—remains a feature of many of the communities of this region today.\n\nDuring the twelfth century, Wagadu (Ghana) began to decline and lost its status as the biggest state in the region. It is possible that this was partly because of an invasion by North Africans hoping to take control of the gold trade, but not too many historians buy that story. They may have merely been surpassed by a state to the south, Susu, which gained control over most of the gold and kola nut trade. It also had successful textile and iron industries. The Susu were the great power of the region for a hundred years, until they were themselves defeated by a new power.\n\nThat new power was the state of Mali, led by its first mansa (sultan, king, or emperor), Sunjata. Sunjata's full name was Sogolon Mari Djata. \"Sogolon\" was actually his mother's name, and although he may have been Muslim, he still embraced matrilineality and other local cultural and religious ideas. In fact, much of his power came from his mother, who may have been related to the rulers of Susu. She brought him supporters, as did his father, who was a king of a nearby territory. Sunjata defeated Susu around 1240. In the wake of his victory, he built the long and lasting state of Mali. Many of his followers then took their forces and conquered the people around them until Mali stretched more than a thousand miles east to west.\n\nIf you ever want to watch a group of historians argue, ask them if Mali was an empire. On one hand, it had a core of people who shared a language and culture, while around them were conquered people who did not—like an empire, right? On the other hand, it was not very centralized. The different regions were fairly independent, and there isn't a lot of evidence that conquered people were treated as inferior. That makes it seem less like an empire. But back to the one hand, there is evidence that Mali's rulers got very rich by controlling the growing trade in the region. This was especially true as trade grew in North Africa and Europe in the early fourteenth century. This trade created a demand for currency, especially gold, and Mali controlled much of the gold production available in western Afro- Eurasia. Mansa Musa, the man in the map at the top, became Mansa of Mali around 1312, and he controlled so much wealth that a European map-maker, who had never met or seen him, would draw a scepter in his hand and a crown on his head to depict him as a great and rich king.\n\nIt is interesting that most high schools limit their teaching of African history, pre-1500 CE, to Mali and the Sudanic African states, leaving out many regions that had states and complex systems of trade. In the forests to the south of the Sudanic zone, there were actually large kingdoms including Benin and the Yoruba and Igala states. They were built to ensure the safety of farmers and control the profits from trading kola nuts, gold, and other goods going north. In the mountains of Central Africa, the kings of Kitara and their neighbors created systems of nobility and monarchy based on ownership of cattle. Along the Congo River, chiefs gave gifts to each other to secure military and political alliances. In northeast Africa, the massive kingdom of Ethiopia was ruled by a Solomonic dynasty, so named because it claimed the biblical king Solomon as an ancestor. In Southeast Africa, extensive states like the one centered on the stone city called Great Zimbabwe existed alongside smaller societies. Historians are learning much more about these kingdoms, which we once ignored. It's a great example of how history's many narratives can grow and change based on the evidence and on who is telling the story."
