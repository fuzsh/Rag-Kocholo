        "text": "1. Mali The kingdom of Mali existed from the 1200s until the 1600s. Where? The Empire of Mali was located in Western Africa. It spread across 1,200 miles to the Atlantic Ocean. Its northern border was just south of the Sahara Desert. It covered parts of modern day countries such as Mali, Niger, Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea, and The Gambia. Economy Although many people in the kingdom worked as farmers and fishermen, Mali became wealthy selling other products. In particular, gold, salt and copper were traded with other tribes, and also some European countries. Politics and government The government of the Mali Empire was led by the emperor who was called the Mansa. The empire was then divided up into provinces that were each led by a governor called a ferba. Many government administrators were Muslim scribes. Religious beliefs The religion of Islam was an important part of the Mali Empire. However, even though the kings, or Mansas, had converted to Islam, they did not force their subjects to do so. Many people practiced a version of Islam that combined Islamic beliefs with the local traditions. Mali and slavery Slaves were kept in the Kingdom of Mali, and traded with people in the Middle East. Mali was also involved in the Atlantic trade although the kingdom had collapsed by the time the Atlantic trade became most lucrative."
