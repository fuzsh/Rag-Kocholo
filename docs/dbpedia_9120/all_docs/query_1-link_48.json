        "text": "Making Money - , Death, and Early Modern Trade on Africa's Guinea Coast( Colleen E. Kriger) (2017 edition)\n\n(Page 10-11)(African trade network)\n\nBased mainly in regions along the southern shore of the Sahara, Juula merchants created extensive trade diasporas that linked major trans-Saharan routes with myriad local, regional, and interregional networks to the south.\n\nEvidence from archaeological sites and from Arabic written sources provides a general indication of just how extensive these networks were, reaching overland and along rivers to connect towns and cities in the grasslands and forests there with the primary entrepôts of Saharan caravan traffic. Prominent among the surviving material remains of this commercial system are foreign manufactures that crossed the desert and found their way as far as the tropical rainforests, well before the arrival of the Portuguese.\n\nFor example, two archaeological\n\nsites at Igbo-Ukwu (in modern southeast Nigeria) are especially significant on this score. Among the priestly burial, regalia, and treasure unearthed at those sites is a spectacular trove of over 165,000 trade beads from the Mediterranean and Asia. Dating to the ninth or tenth century, the sites provide with general temporal markers for the economic history of West Africa.\n\nThey indicate that on the eve of the second millennium communities deep in the rainforest belt were indirectly linked with avenues of trans-Saharan trade, receiving beads that came from distant towns in Africa or beyond.\n\nThis material evidence also presents visually dazzling corroboration of the rather cursory references to trade beads in the Arabic-language written sources. There is, however, an important caveat: the beads themselves are of only limited use in identifying specifically where they came from.\n\nRed beads made of carnelian, for example, which were found at both Igbo Ukwu and Gao, might have been from Gao itself or, alternatively, from other known supply centers as far away as Egypt or India.\n\nMonochrome glass beads found in those same sites and others could have been from Morocco, Egypt, or the Near East, which were the major known suppliers of such beads between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.\n\n(Page 12) (Currency and money in West Africa)\n\nThe largest regional currency zone, extending over much of the West African interior, owed its existence to the importance of the trans-Saharan\n\ncaravan trade.\n\nIn this zone people reckoned prices and exchanged goods based on units of African gold, imported cowry shells, and Saharan rock salt.\n\nThe other three currencies—cotton textiles, bar iron, and sea salt—circulated in and between smaller subregions and also into and out of Muslim trading\n\nnetworks.\n\nPage 18-19 (History of cowry in Africa below the Sahara)\n\nMuslim merchants introduced another currency, cowry shells, from either the Near East or the Indian Ocean basin into West African networks via trans-Saharan trading routes at least as early as the eleventh century. Evidence of this traffic comes from travelers' accounts collected and written down by al-Bakri, which mentioned cowry imports observed at that time in the vicinity of Gao.\n\nOther sources from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries make additional references to cowries being carried across the Sahara along the western caravan route leading southward from Sijilmasa to Ghana. [ Al idrissi, i suppose]\n\nArchaeological remains of a portion of what was one such caravan offer material corroboration of these rather sparse and meager written sources.\n\nWhat survived of them is impressive. Along with approximately two thousand standard-sized rods of copper and copper alloy were several containers filled with cowry shells. The site, called Ma'den Ijafen (Mauritania,) , is believed to date to the twelfth century.\n\nThe first mention of a cowry currency in the Arabic sources comes from al-Umari, who wrote in 1337/8 about the Mali Empire and what was remembered thirteen years after the pilgrimage to Mecca of its leader, Mansa Musa.\n\nAmong his informants was one Ibn Amir Hajib, a governing official of Cairo, who had met and befriended Musa and claimed to have had many informative conversations with him. Hajib recounted to al-Umari some of what Mansa Musa had told\n\nhim about Mali's history and culture. Gold was apparently collected as tribute but exported, and the main currency circulating in Mali at that time was imported cowry shells. He added that merchants who were specialists in the business of supplying cowry imports profited handsomely from it.\n\nPage 18-19 ( cowry currencies vs gold )\n\nIbn Battuta, a Moroccan traveler in West Africa from February 1352 to December 1353, provides a brief but very instructive eyewitness description of cowry currency in his written account of his travels. He noted that cowries were a currency there, specifying Mali and Gao in particular.\n\nMost precisely, he stated that in both places he had seen them changing hands at the same rate of 1,150 shells per gold dinar.\n\nCowries amounted to small change and\n\nwere especially useful for making minor transactions. As fixed and durable units, they could circulate by count in single- or multiple-shell units or, if necessary, in larger quantities by weight. Creating standard gold-cowry conversion rates thus provided greater flexibility and social reach to West African commerce by enabling a Muslim gold-weight system to operate in regular and reliable contact with shell-counting systems of polytheistic and rural peoples.\n\n(Page 21-22) (cotton vs cowry currencies)\n\nThe earliest written information about cotton and cotton textile manufacture in sub-Saharan West Africa comes from al-Bakri's eleventh-century in which he states that the currencies of Sila (in the lower Senegal River valley) consisted of sorghum, salt, copper rings, and lengths of finely woven cotton.\n\nAl-Umari noted in the fourteenth century that one of the currencies in Kanem, in the vicinity of Lake Chad well to the east, was a locally woven cotton strip cloth, and that Mali, far to the west, was reportedly cultivating much cotton and producing high-quality cotton textiles.\n\nAl-Bakri's report about the currencies in the lower Senegal River valley noted the cotton currency there circulated in lengths he referred to as izar, the Arabic word for mantle, the most basic and versatile of garments.\n\nKanem's cotton currency as described by al-Umari circulated in lengths of ten cubits (the forearm length from the middle finger tip to the elbow bottom), and purchases could be made using fractions from one cubit upwards.\n\nImported cowries, beads, copper pieces, and silver coins also circulated there\n\nas currency, but their values were calculated in terms of the local cotton cloth units. Al-Umari also noted that the excellent white woven cotton of Mali was\n\ncalled kamisiya, from the Arabic qamis, a generic term for shirt.\n\n(Page 37)(EuroAfrican trade)\n\nThe general classes of overseas commodities that England's Royal African Company (RAC) brought to the Guinea Coast in the second half of the seventeenth century centered on textiles and metalwares. These remained the two most important categories of trade goods into and throughout the eighteenth century.\n\n(Page 47-48)(EuroAfrican trade and cowry)\n\nIn their dealings on the Guinea Coast, the RAC noted the well-established markets there for particular kinds of beads. On the Upper Guinea Coast, people used coral (a red organic material), crystal, and glass beads as well as cowry shells as cash to purchase food or drink or to pay a person for labor or services. People also hoarded these small currency units for making larger purchases or for major family investments.\n\nCrystal beads were desired up the Gambia River, where they were necessary in the trade assortments for captives and export goods.\n\nCoral and amber also served as jewelry on the Upper Guinea Coast, worn by prominent titled women and valued by them as highly as gold and silver.\n\nBeads of coral were also in great demand farther down the coast in the Benin Kingdom, where they were displayed ceremonially as part of the royal regalia. And cowries were an essential item in Euro-African trade all along the Bight of Benin.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company brought cowries—a shell currency originally from the Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean that circulated in and around Islamic trading zones—in quantity as ballast for its ships on their voyages homeward. In the early years of the RAC monopoly, they purchased their cowries in Amsterdam, but it did not take long for London dealers who specialized in other Indian Ocean goods to become the company's main suppliers. For their early supplies of clear crystal and colored glass beads, the company relied on Holland until London dealers developed reliable contacts to get them direct from producers in Venice.\n\nCowrie Shells and Cowrie Money : A Global History Bin Yang\n\n(BOok description content)\n\nOriginating in the sea, especially in the waters surrounding the low-lying islands of the Maldives, Cypraea moneta (sometimes confused with Cypraea annulus) was transported to various parts of Afro-Eurasia in the prehistoric era, and in many cases, it was gradually transformed into a form of money in various societies for a long span of time.\n\n(Page 3)( life of the cowrie mollusc )\n\nThe term \"cowrie\" (\"cowry\" or \"gowrie\") in Greek means \"little pig,\" and that is why early European texts referred these shells as pig shells. The very origin of the term can be traced to Sanskrit, as Paul Pelliot observed. But before going into the human view and uses of the cowrie, let us consider the biological story of this mollusc. With a history of more than 100 million years, cowrie shells have been dis- covered in prehistoric archaeological sites in India, China, Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa and other parts of Afro-Eurasia. Today, they are widely found in most subtropical and tropical oceans between 30° N and 30° south of the equator. Most of them live in shallow waters no deeper than five metres, while a few occasionally live as deep as fifty metres or more. While algae seem to be their main source of food, most of them are carnivorous, some are omnivorous, and some mollusc-eating fish are their natural predators.\n\n(Page 160)(Chapter 7 - West Africa : connecting the worlds, old and new)\n\n(Page 161)\n\nArchaeological findings have indicated the use of cowrie shells, both Cypraea moneta and Cypraea annulus, in pre-dynastic Egypt, their main functions being as charms, amulets and decorations, while many scholars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries mistook these as money.\n\nAmongst genuine cowries, there are imitated cowries (Figure 7.1), including a gold imitation one, 1.5 cm long, found in the northern cemetery near tomb enclosure 758 of Dynasty 12–13 (ca. 1990–1650 BCE), indicating that cowrie shells were brought to and used in Egypt probably well before the beginning of the second millennium BCE. It is highly likely that cowries (both genuine and imitated) were favoured by the nobility for adornment, with specifi c cultural or religious signifi cance.\n\nAs for the northern coast, evidence has shown that before the Christian era, cowries from the Indian Ocean were carried to Levantine ports such as Antioch, Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut and Acre. The Romans possessed shells and kept outposts deep in the Sahara, and it is said that a cowrie market had been established in Cairo by the Middle Ages, although only based on circumstantial evidence.\n\n(Page 165-168)(Cowry in West Africa)\n\nThe earliest area for cowrie money was probably along the great bend of the Niger River. An early account of cowrie use was made by al-Bakri in 1046, when he mentioned that cowries were amongst the imported goods in Kougha, once a capital of the Songhay (Songhai) Empire.\n\nNearly one century later, al-Zuhri also noticed the importing of cowries, but gave no details; about another century later, Ibn Saʽid (?–1274) provided more information, noting how cowries were shipped by merchants who travelled from Morocco across the desert en route to the Ghana Empire, which has since been confi rmed by a recent archaeological discovery.\n\nIt was not until the beginning of the fourteenth century that cowrie shells were definitively recorded as being used as money in West Africa (Map 7.1). Al-ʽUmari\n\n(1301–1349) in his Masalik al-absar pointed out that in the Mali Empire, \"all internal business transactions\" are \"in cowries imported by the merchants at a considerable profit.\"\n\nNot long after, Ibn Battuta added his emphatic voice on the presence of cowrie money in Africa, as he was a Moroccan scholar who had travelled to many of the cowrie money regions across the world. He went on from there to Gawgaw [Gao], which is a large city on the Nile (Niger River) , and one of the finest towns in the ..... lands. It is also one of their biggest and best-provisioned towns, with rice in plenty, milk and fish, and there is a species of cucumber there called \"inani\" which had no equal.\n\nIn the following centuries, more records of cowrie money in various parts of West Africa were made. Alvise Cadamosto (1432–1488), a Venetian merchant and navigator who under the patronage of the Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator embarked on voyages to West Africa, explored the coastal areas of the present-day countries of Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. In 1455, he heard about the use of cowrie money inland from Arguin, an island off the western coast of Mauritania.\n\nThe use of cowrie money in the Mali Empire was again mentioned in the fifteenth century when the Berber Leo Africanus (c. 1494 to c. 1554), who was the most authoritative scholar on Africa from his age, described the monetary practices including cowrie money in Timbuktu in the early sixteenth century :\n\nThe coine of Tombuto is of gold without any stampe or superscription: but in matters of smal value they vse certaine shels brought hither out of the kingdome of Persia, fower hundred of which shels are worth a ducate: and sixe peeces of their golden coine with two third parts weigh an ounce.\n\nThe earliest cowrie zone started on the upper and middle Niger River in the northern part of West Africa, probably from the eleventh century. It took roots in the Mali Empire by the fourteenth century, continued to expand eastwards to Gao, capital of the Songhay empire, before eventually reaching Timbuktu, Jenne and probably the western part of old Mali by the sixteenth century.\n\nIn the southern part of West Africa, shell money was used in an enclave near Benin when the Portuguese arrived there in the late 1480s. However, most of these shells were of the small olive shell type available on some West African beaches, particularly at Luanda Island. Locally known as zimbos, these Atlantic shells constituted the dominant money in the Kingdom of Kongo.\n\n(Page 168-169)(Cowry regional distribution)\n\nAfter the arrival of cowrie shells carried by European vessels, there existed two routes for the cowrie trade: one from North Africa (mainly Morocco) across the desert to West Africa and the other by sea to the Guinea Coast (between Accra and the western portion of the Niger Delta). The first one had pre-dominated for cowrie imports before the sixteenth century, while subsequently, the second soon took over the hegemony and indeed shaped the expansion of the cowrie money zone. From the sixteenth century onwards, the cowrie area \"expanded steadily from its beachhead at the Niger bend, and from another centered in southern Dahomey.\"\n\nIn the following two or three centuries, the zone expanded dramatically and as a result, the northern and the southern parts joined together.\n\n- In the north, Timbuktu seems to have been the northern limit of the use of the shells in the nineteenth century; they were then at a discount because they were not accepted by the desert traders . . . West of Timbuktu, in the mid-nineteenth century, cowries were found in the region of Nioro, but they may have been a relatively recent introduction there.\n\n- To the east, they have been found in the ruins of Azalik, near Agades . . . In Agades itself, cowries had been in use when the gold trade was flourishing there, and an Agades chronicle tells of an eighteenth-century chief making a gift of a horse and a million cowries.\n\n- In the south, the southern import of cowries soon became the major route for the expansion of cowrie money, indeed reversing the north-south direction of cowrie circulation. Along the coast, Whydah and Ardra immediately became two major cowrie centres for the slave trade, and by the seventeenth century, cowrie shells had been used in Lay, west of the Volta mouth. They kept spreading westwards and reached Accra and Christiansborg by the early eighteenth century, the Dutch posts in Bereku and Apam by the late eighteenth century, the English post at Winneba by the early nineteenth century and Anomabu by 1850. To the west, these shells seem not to have reached Cape Coast or Elmina on the central Gold Coast; nor did they spread to the eastern Niger Delta, to the east.\n\n(Page 169-170)(Cowry transportation)\n\nCowries were carried inland by various means of transportation. Once unloaded on the coast, they were shipped by canoe, along the Volta River, for example, whenever possible, and then transported on land by camels, donkeys and people for the rest of the journey. The Volta River, over 1,600 km long, is the chief river system of Ghana. Confluenced by three major tributary rivers of the Black Volta, the White Volta and the Red Volta and joined by a small tributary river the Oti from Togo in the east, the Volta starts from Bobo- Dioulasso highlands of Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) and flows generally southwards through Ghana into the Gulf of Guinea. Indeed, the Volta River became a major route of the cowrie trade, with its region a crucial part of the expanded cowrie money zone in the south.\n\nIn the north, the camel caravan that crossed the desert was exclusively adopted in North Africa to the northern part of West Africa. A camel could carry 100,000 to 240,000 cowries, about 250 to 600 pounds in weight, depending on distance and the animal. Donkeys were mainly restricted to the northern zone, due to their high mortality in the southern part. A donkey could carry 32,000 to 50,000 cowries, about 80 to 120 pounds. Human portage was also widely adopted, due to convenience and resilience. It was also why some units of measurement for cowrie shells were adopted in local societies, such as a mat, a bag or a sack (20,000 shells, roughly 50 pounds), which was one man's load. Therefore, the transportation expense served as one of the main contributors to the rise of price."
