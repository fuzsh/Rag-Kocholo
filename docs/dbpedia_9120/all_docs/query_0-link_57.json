        "text": "Following up on Al-Bakri: Historian & Geographer, this week we’ll take a look at the life Mansa Sundieta Keita. After his victory at Kirina, Mansa Sundiata established his capital at Niani. His sons went on to succeed him as Mansas of the Empire.\n\n\"The spirit of man lives thanks to three things: seeing what he wants to see, saying what he wants to say, doing what he wants to do. So now everyone answers for his person, he is free in his acts, in compliance with the laws of his country.\"\n\n---\n\nThe Mandinka kingdoms of Mali existed several centuries before Sundiata’s unification as small states to the south of the Soninké empire of Wagadou, better known as the Ghana Empire.\n\nSundiata, the son of King Naré Maghann Konaté of Kangaba and Sogolon Condé, was born early in the 13th century to a noble family within the Malinke kingdom. Kangaba, part of the Ghana empire of West Africa, rose from its position as a small, influential kingdom located on an offshoot of the upper Niger River to become the great Mali Empire.\n\nOral stories about Keita say that he was a sickly child or suffered from some sort of physical impairment. He would become the first ruler of the Mali Empire from 1235 A.D. to 1255 A.D.\n\nAlso known as the Lion of Mali, Sundieta Keita was the great-uncle of the Malian ruler Mansa Musa, regarded as the wealthiest person of all time.\n\nSundiata left Kangaba, for reasons unknown: he may have gone into voluntary exile to avoid a jealous half-brother, or he may have been exiled by Sumanguru Kante, king of the Soso, who killed Keita's father and took over his kingdom.\n\nThe oral traditions relating to Sundiata Keita were passed down generation after generation by the local griots, until eventually their stories were put into writing from sources such as the Moroccan traveler Muhammad ibn Battúta (1304–1368) and the Tunisian historian ibn Khaldun (1332–1406), both having travelled to Mali in the century after Sundiata's death.\n\nWhen the Ghana Empire tried to impose trade restrictions on the Malinke, Keita began a revolt.\n\nAt The Battle of Kirina, Sundiata and his allies defeated the Sosso king, and he became the first Emperor of the Mali Empire. He was the first of the Mandinka line of kings to adopt the royal title Mansa (king or emperor in the Mandinka language).\n\nAfter his victory at Kirina, Sundiata took control of the former conquered states of the Sosso and appropriated privileges among those who participated in the defeat of Soumaoro. The former allies of Soumaoro were also later defeated, in particular the king of Jolof.\n\nAfter his victory at Kirina, Mansa Sundiata established his capital at Niani, near the present-day Malian border with Guinea. Assisted by his generals, he went on to conquer other states. The lands of the old Ghana Empire were conquered.\n\nThe Mali Empire grew wealthy due to its control of trade routes as well as its significant gold and copper resources.\n\nThe Mali Empire would become the largest and richest empire yet seen in West Africa controlling trade routes by land and river and local resources such as gold, copper, iron, and ivory.\n\nThe Mali Empire, under Sundiata Keita, created one of the very first charters of human rights, the Manden Charter, also known as the Kouroukan Fouga. The Charter in oral form was transmitted for centuries by the Malinké, an initiatory group of hunters, and by the griots, the storytellers of West Africa.\n\nKeita died in 1255 from an unclear cause. Some records point to an accidental but fatal arrow wound, others to drowning in the Sankarani River.\n\nThe name Keita is a clan name rather than a surname. His three sons (Mansa Wali Keita, Mansa Ouati Keita and Mansa Khalifa Keita) went on to succeed him as Mansas of the Empire.\n\n---\n\nHope you enjoyed this week’s Notable People in History newsletter.
