The face of the coin depicts the Hummingbird â€“ the eponymous company emblem for Hummingbird Resources, with the name of the origin mine and the weight stamped on. The reverse of the coin is decorated with the portrait of Musa I of Mali, 14th century king of the Mali empire, thought to be the richest person to have ever lived.

The gold for this coin was mined by Hummingbird Resources, at their Yanfolila Mine in Mali, West Africa. Yanfolila is an SMO member mine, which means it complies with rigorous international standards of the World Gold Council Responsible Gold Mining Principles (RGMPs), Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) or International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) principles. This mine is then independently audited & certified, making it one of the best in class for responsibly sourced gold.
