        "text": "Swift Current was home to us, for a long time ,from 1975 to 1997,all that time I worked in the Media and played and coached ball.I had officailly retired to give my Radio career first dibs ,and worked hard at it,and did very well I mite add,but ,my past ghosts came back to haunt me as the Leader Post had a hugh writeup about me leaving the Winnepeg Kernels, of the Western Major Fastball League,,pro ball ,anyway ,Winnepeg and I came to terms and I was given my amateur status back!\n\nThe L-P is well read in SC ,so that day I had 2 calls to come and play ball,one from Frontier Moving,and one from Bill and Harvs.,I chose Bill and Harvs and on with the show this is it!!!!\n\nThe SC league was known as SC and District Fastball League,teams were from Neville,Burnham,Rush Lake,Bill & Harvs.Frontier Moving,Healy Hotel and the Hondas from Wymark area!Each team actually was in fine shape ,all had 2 pitchers and 3-4 extra players for a nice 14 man roster,Burnham had a great pitcher,Darryl Wallace,and good hitting as well,Rush Lake had Stew Wells and Doug Robertson on the mound and where a threat at the plate at all times,Neville had the Broten boys and good hitting and good defencively as well,.In Swift Current the Frontires had Wilf Montgomery and Ron Giesbrecht on the hill ,and was a real good all around ball team,the Healy boys had workhorseVan Wamer on the hill and perhaps the weakest team,Hondas had Rueben Wiebe as their ace and were a real proud bunch of mennonite boys that never gave up ,Bill & Harvs was by far the most hated team ,because we were good and gave the teams the fits,pitching veterans John Wiebe and Red ,me ,with an all-around veteran bunch,Ken Thomas,Bruce Klassen,Terry Riddle,Daryl Schlamp and Johnny Pribyl were the backbone of this team!Team manager ,coach Jack Byers was the leader, no two ways about it ,this was His team!!!He ventured where no one walked ,to A tournaments in Saskatoon,Regina,Plentywood,Havre and Great Falls ,Minot,ND, as well as Medicine Hat ,AB.\n\nBill & Harvs also had their own 24 team open class tourney,drawing all A teams from Saskatoon,Regina,Moose Jaw and Alberta , Montana and North Dakota!!!\n\nTour Challenges\n\nMexico ,USA Tour The tour took us to Las Vegas ,then off to Lancaster,home ,against the Edwards Air Base ,went on to\n\nLancaster Chemelions,We then played in Corona,Vista, Nogales,Mex,and to Phoenix. We played 18 games and won 11 and lost7.\n\nWe also played in Oceanside,Chula Vista!\n\n.Each city treated us like heros ,with the mayors and recreation and ambassadors at the games.\n\nWe all received momentous and souvenirs,a great all around idea and good will!!!!!\n\nSK:McKaig,Friesen,Heese,Hilderbrand,Ridley,Byers,Wiebe,Peterson,MB: Pallister,Brown,Duggan,Andersun\n\nThe tour was dedicated to Marty Froese,my cousin,pitcher and friend,He accidentally died in a car mishap at Butte Montana,on the way down to join our tour,Marty was married to Becky, Miss you,Marty .Marty was a great pitcher,a lefty,fast and had the neatest change-up around,He thru a fine drop ball as well. Marty was a dedicated ball player,team man,good hitter and excellent attitude!He was self driven,motivated and a complete player. worked hard at his craft and would have developed into a world class thrower,had he had the chance.T he tour was devastated when nephew Wilf called me about the sad news,I, imediately called Martys mom,my aunt and asked what we should do,no hesitation,Marty would want you to go on with the tour. we did so in his Honour!!! Swift Current:: . This was as competitive, rivalry laden league, as they come .The league was made up of City teams and Rush Lake,Neville, Kyle, Burnham,the fan support was great and most games were broadcast on CKSW. Bill & Harvs (sponsor name of Schell Service Station),also hosted a 24 team tourney every year,teams invited were the best of Sask,Alberta and Montana,playing for Three Thousand Dollars in prize money.KT Thomas the catcher for Bill&Harvs passed away ,Jan 25/07at age 61,what a competitor .These were some of my very best years,pressure was gone ,now,learn to play competitive,but,still have fun. Like I said ,my prime years were over,however I could help to coach,pitch the odd and even games,less travel,and all good guys .My work was most important to me and loved my years in broadcast,very high commitments but I could handle it ,I was young. Primarily,my job was to create revenue,which was very important to owner Elmer Hildebrand of Altona ,Manitoba.I loved Elmer and we worked planned together well!A lot of quiet PRESSURE,however,we all got with the program and won! More——We embarked on a new venture ,creating the Can-Am Fastpitch League,teams from Swift Current,Medicine Hat,Lethbridge, Havre,and two teams from Great Falls. The concept was to play tournaments in each city and allow any players to take part,no fixed rosters and more open to ,so called ,illegal pitching,and a few rules were ignored,as well! We kept it going for thee years ,and all involved were well pleased. The time I played A ball,we had residency rules,travel rules ,so it was tougher to have a winner. Today players can sign for Nationals only and play in US or anywhere for that matter. Fastball is a great game,with one problem,no grassroots promotion like baseball,until that happens the game will continue at its hotbeds with imports and carry on. Sure hope that will change ,the sooner the better,what happens when this generation of players retire?\n\nSpeed\n\nISC pitching speeds\n\nThese are from the Midland website.

There have been some overstatements and understating that are both comical and disturbing.\n\nIn my younger years I wrote a few papers on the subjects relating to all areas of fastpitch including hitters reaction time, bat speed and hitting efficiency, throwing velocity training and base stealing techniques.\n\nIn these papers I dealt with the biomechanical principals, the physics of the actions and the mental aspects behind these actions. These papers do not make me an expert but I hope to enlighten, entertain and engage you while you read this. The numbers that I use will be explained and hopefully you will understand why I use them.\n\nThe distance for a fastpitch pitcher delivery point will be 40ft due to the fact that the release point is at the hip. Most pitchers hips are at about 6ft in front of the rubber on release, the distance for a baseball pitcher will be at 53ft since the release point is ahead of the front foot. You could argue this with me a bit but I will try to be on the side of caution.\n\nA world class female pitcher who throws a 68mph pitch released at 38 ft would allow the hitter .381 of a second to react, which equates to a 95 MPH pitch in baseball.\n\nA world class male windmill pitcher who throws an 80mph pitch released at 40 feet would allow the hitter . 341 of a second, which relates to a 106mph pitch in baseball.\n\nIn the major leagues the top fastballers (Randy Johnson, Clemons) will throw 93-98mph consistently. Now the baseball pitchers speed is not so important for reaction time as it is a comparison for what a fastpitch batter must face when he hits.\n\nAn 80mph pitch in the men’s fastpitch game is 117.33 ft/second which gives the batter standing 40ft from the release point .341 of a second to hit the ball.\n\nA 95mph pitch is 139.33 ft/sec, which gives the batter standing 53ft from the release point .380 of a second to hit the ball. A baseball pitcher would have to throw the ball 155.42 ft/sec to accomplish the .341 reaction time for the baseball batter. This equates to a 106 mph fastball.\n\nThese are the pure comparison numbers and do not take in to account; the size of the ball, ball movement, etc. Fastpitch batters never have a 6 11″ Randy Johnson releasing the ball about 3-4 ft behind a left handed batter and have it curve into the strike zone.\n\nThe multitude of release points that a baseball pitcher can throw at you (side arm, ¾ arm, over the top, etc) or the huge speed changes from one pitch to the next. All these things work into the reaction time formula.\n\nThe baseball batter of course very rarely sees a ball rise thru the strike zone. Top pitchers will throw faster than the examples given which then requires even less time to react.\n\nThese are the reasons why batters spend hours trying to “pick a pitcher” since you can eliminate either a direction of movement or speed of pitch so that the batter can focus on a smaller hitting zone.\n\nOf course hitting is not all reaction time and mental aspects of hitting are as important as ones’ ability to react to a pitch. I think the comparison of baseball to fastpitch hitting is complex but as a pure degree of difficulty in reacting to a top quality fastpitch pitcher I personally think that us “chest thumping” fastpitch hitters can be proud of our accomplishments.\n\nI hope this enlightens and entertains, as it was meant to.\n\nDave Paetkau\n\nPower Zone Academy\n\nhttp://www.powerzoneacademy.com\n\nK\n\nHockey winger currently playing for the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL).

With approval from City Council, the new media gondola being built at the ENMAX Centre will be named the Steve “Foggy” Fallwell Media Centre. Fallwell was the radio play-by-play voice of the Lethbridge Broncos and Hurricanes back in the 80’s and 90’s. Over the course of his broadcasting carrer, Fallwell called more than 1400 regular season junior hockey games. Broncos/Hurricanes Alumni Chair Dick Gibson says Foggy was known in Lethbridge and southern Alberta as the “voice” of the Hurricanes and Broncos and carried with him a sterling reputation of professionalism and integrity. Fallwell says he’s deepy touched to have the new media centre named in his honour\n\n.\n\nBOB RIDLEY,3000 Games and Counting\n\nBob Ridley CHAT,The Hat ,WHL 3000 games\n\nTrots\n\nBryan John Trottier (born July 17, 1956, in Val Marie, Saskatchewan, Canada) was a professional Ice Hockey Centre in the NHL, and is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nNicknamed “Trots,” he was drafted by the New York Islanders in 1974 where he played his first fifteen seasons. He won the Calder Trophy as the league’s Rookie of the year in 1976. Trottier was one of the core players of the Islanders early 1980s dynasty wininng four Stanley Cups with them in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983, earning the Conn Smythe trophy as playoff MVP in 1980. His best season was 1978-79 when he had 134 points, top in the NHL that season, garnering the Hart Trophy as league MVP. In the same season, he led the NHL in assists with 87, something he did the year before as well with 77 assists.\n\n. On June 1st, 2006, Trottier finally returned to the Islanders’, as Executive Director of Player Personnel\n\nMoen\n\nTravis Moen (born April 6, 1982 in Swift Current, Saskatchewan) is a Canadian hockey player for the Anaheim Ducks of the NHL. Although he was born in Swift Current, he grew up in Stewart Valley. He was originally drafted in the fifth round of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft by the Calgary Flames, however, he never played for the club. Today he plays fot the Montreal Canadiens .\n\nWillie Friesen\n\nWillie Friesen’s “Damascus Road” experience came after a fight during the 1974-75 hockey season. A sixth-round draft pick of the Philadelphia Flyers, he was playing left wing for their farm team, the Philadelphia Firebirds of the North American Hockey League, when, during a game in Syracuse, N.Y., he dropped his gloves and fought a player on the other team. The crowd loved it, cheering on the combatants.\n\nBut later in the penalty box, Friesen had second thoughts. “I knew that guy. I played against him wh\n\nWillie Friesen in his farm team Philadelphia Firebirds uniform\n\nen we were both in Saskatchewan,” he told a rapt audience of over 300 youths and young adults at last year’s Peace-It-Together conference at Canadian Mennonite University (CMU) in Winnipeg. “And yet here I was fighting him far from home, cheered on by 10,000 people. It was like I was like a gladiator, entertaining the crowd.”\n\nFrom then on, he said, “it was harder and harder to fight.” But getting to that point was a hard journey for Friesen, who was brought up in a Mennonite family in Saskatchewan. “I really liked to win,” he said of his younger years in sports. He also liked to play tough, and got into a lot of fights during games—something that deeply worried his father, a committed pacifist. “If one day you have to go before a judge to say you don’t want to go to war, how will you ever be able to say you are a conscientious objector with all your fights?” he said his father asked him.\n\nBut fighting was what his coaches wanted him to do. In junior hockey, he played on a line with future NHL Hall of Famer Bryan Trottier in Swift Current, Sask., scoring 25 goals in his last season with the Broncos. But that’s not what his coaches wanted. They wanted him to play tough and protect stars like Trottier—not put the puck in the net himself.\n\nOnce he was drafted by the Flyers in 1974 and sent down to their farm team, he did well, scoring 25 goals and being named runner-up for rookie of the year. “I had a good rookie year, but the Flyers weren’t satisfied; they wanted more toughness,” he said. “It was always the same speech.”\n\nBut after that night in Syracuse, Friesen didn’t want to fight anymore. The things his father had said about peace and living like Christ kept coming back. The following season, during training camp, he concentrated on playing, not fighting, and in one memorable NHL exhibition game scored two goals in a Flyers’ win.\n\nAfter the game, though, he was called in to meet the coach. He thought it might be to tell him how great he had played and what a great addition he was to the team. But it was the opposite. “I was told that the Flyers hadn’t drafted me to score goals, but to play tough,” he said. “That’s when I knew I couldn’t do it anymore.”\n\nHe quit. At the age of 21, his pro hockey career was over “before it had ever really started,” he said. But, he added, “hockey was not where my gift was meant to be.”\n\nAfter leaving hockey, Friesen joined the Calgary (Alta.) Fire Department, rising to the rank of lieutenant. “God has a plan for each of us,” he told the conference. “Hockey was not where my gifts were meant to be used.”\n\nAs for sports, Friesen, a member of Calgary’s Trinity Mennonite Church, said that Christian athletes need to know “the difference between winning and winning at all costs.” They also need to make sure that the drive to win doesn’t turn into “something that hurts other people.”\n\nFron Swift Current on-line\n\nNew Book Examines Tragic 1986 Broncos Bus Crash\n\nWritten by Shawn Mullin on Tuesday, 13 November 2012\n\nSudden Death book\n\nOn a cold December day in 1986, Swift Current was rocked by a tragic bus crash that took the lives of Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff. A new book tells the story of how the four young men were killed and many others were injured when the bus carrying the Swift Current Broncos lost control on Highway 1 just outside of the city.\n\nJournalist Gregg Drinnan teamed with former Bronco Bob Wilkie and crash witness Leesa Culp to put together Sudden Death: The Incredible Saga of the 1986 Swift Current Broncos.\n\nWilkie was on the bus that day and a young Culp witnessed the incident while catching a ride to Moose Jaw with a trucker. She was on the scene right after the crash and held Kresse’s hand while he died.\n\nFull Interview with “Sudden Death” co-author Gregg Drinnan\n\n“Her story is really amazing,” Drinnan said. “How she came to realize all these years later that that had been the Swift Current Broncos and how she decided to try to find out what had happened. Really that was the genesis of this book.”\n\nThe book begins with former teammates Wilkie, Peter Soberlak and Sheldon Kennedy gathering in Calgary for the drive to a reunion of the 1989 Memorial Cup Championship Team.\n\n“Their visit to Swift Current was very much like the book is,” Drinnan said. “The spectre of Graham James hangs over it. There’s no getting away from that. Those three guys were driving to Swift Current for that reunion knowing they wanted to celebrate the Memorial Cup from 1989, but because they hadn’t been back since all the Graham James stuff had happened… they really weren’t sure what they were getting into.”\n\nThe beginning of that journey for Wilkie, Soberlak and Kennedy leads into a narrative that re-lives the days surrounding the bus crash from several unique perspectives. They include the captain, a goalie who joined the team just before the crash but never played a minute for them, the trainer who was attending a tournament out of town at the time and a billet father who was also a police officer at the scene.\n\n“To have them tell readers about what happened the day of the bus accident and in the next ten days,” Drinnan noted. “The story about Kurt Lackton, he was the team captain at the time, having to stand up and do a eulogy in front of 3000 or 3500 people in the arena that day was certainly heartbreaking.”\n\n“(Bob Harriman) is doing forensics for the RCMP so has to go to the bus accident and investigate while he was looking to see if he could find (his billet son) Bob Wilkie.”\n\n“I just thought there were so many stories… that were so compelling that really it should be told.”\n\nThe book not only recounts those moments, but catches readers up with where life has taken many of those involved in the events surrounding the crash. Some players have gone on to careers in the game, while others have taken completely different paths such as piloting commercial flights to Hawaii or becoming educators.\n\nSudden Death also chronicles the triumphant run only a short time after the crash to the 1989 Memorial Cup and the shocking revelation that Coach Graham James had been sexually assaulting some of the players.\n\n“Graham James was… definitely a dominant figure in the story of the Swift Current Broncos those days,” Drinnan noted. “You couldn’t ignore that, you can’t change history, but I didn’t want the book to end up being about Graham James.”\n\nJames pleaded guilty to different charges of sexual abuse in both 1997 and 2011. He was initially paroled in 2001 and was then sentenced to two more years in prison on March 20, 2012.\n\nKresse, Kruger, Mantyka and Ruff all had their numbers retired by the Broncos. They and other Swift Current hockey teams wear a four-leaf clover crest as a tribute to the four young men.\n\nSudden Death: The Incredible Saga of the 1989 Swift Current Broncos is now available in stores and online from Dundurn Press.\n\nSC Broncos Remembered\n\nTrent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka, & Brent Ruff Memorial Service – Jan. 4, 1987On December 30, 1986 midway through their first season back in the Western Hockey League, the Swift Current Broncos were involved in a tragic accident. While on the way to Regina to play the Pats, the Broncos team bus slid off the highway and rolled. Four members of the team passed away as a result."
