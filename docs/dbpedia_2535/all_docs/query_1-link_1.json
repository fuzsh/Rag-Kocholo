        "text": "The CBC Board re-confirmed its recommendation for Frontier City Broadcasting’s application for a 250 watt radio station on 1400 kHz, at Swift Current. Another applicant, Swift Current Broadcasting Co. Ltd., had asked that the hearings for the applications be re-opened. The CBC refused the request.\n\nThe call letters CKSW were assigned for the new station.\n\nCKSW began broadcasting on June 1.\n\nFrontier City Broadcasting was formed by broadcast entrepreneur W.D. (Bill) Forst and a group of local shareholders. Forst held a quarter of the company’s shares. Since 1947, Forst had been chief engineer of CJDC Dawson Creek, CKRD Red Deer and then CKOM in Saskatoon. At each station he designed the complete studios, control rooms, transmitter set-up and directed all building construction. He was general manager and technical director of CKSW.\n\nCKSW operated as an independent station with no network affiliation. Ownership of Frontier City Broadcasting Co. Ltd.: D. W. Scott 25%, H. F. Mahaffy 25%, A. A. Maxwell 25% and W. D. Forst 25%. Doug Scott was president of the company. Wilf Gilbey was manager of CKSW. He was also the farm director.\n\nBill Forst left to pursue another local project which involved bringing television to the market – CFJB-TV. Doug Scott became principal owner of CKSW after purchasing Bill’s shares, and served as general manager of the station for 17 years.\n\nCKSW has been the home of several long and successful careers in broadcasting and the 1960s marked the emergence of several personalities. One of the first to achieve success was June Smith, a popular host who became a household name to local listeners. Another who became familiar to listeners was Wilf Gilbey, who spent a total of 25 years with the station. Art Wallman, however, holds the record for longevity. Art joined CKSW in 1960 and began a remarkable on-air career that lasted for 36 years. “Art Wallman Country” featured regular interviews with friends, listeners and recording artists, and drew fans to the station from across the province.\n\nLenn Enns became general manager. Along with the change in management, the station received national attention when Bev Lockhart hosted the on-air broadcast of a Swift Current Broncos hockey game. This was a major accomplishment, as she became the first female announcer in history to do play-by play of a sports event.\n\nOn January 27, CKSW was authorized to move from 1400 to 570 kHz and to increase power from 1,000 watts day and 250 watts at night, to 10,000 watts day and night (directional) from a new transmitter site.\n\nThroughout its existence, CKSW was a model of consistency. The studios were located at 134 Central Avenue North in Swift Current, and the station operated from this location from the time it first received its licence. Local programs including “Trading Post” and “Nite Watch” aired for decades in the same time slot. In an era of continued format and ownership changes, CKSW maintained a consistent and successful balance of programming. The station served as the voice of the Southwest for almost five decades and was familiar to listeners in Saskatchewan for its unique blend of news information, country music and inspirational programming.\n\nIn February 2008, CKSW marked 50 years of broadcasting."
