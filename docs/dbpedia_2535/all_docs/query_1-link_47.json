When her brother Peter was left a widow with two young girls - Betty (5 ½ yrs) & Margaret (1 ½ yrs) Lavina came to the farm to help Peter raise his two daughters and took on a mothering role for them. She was a very hard worker and instilled that same work ethic in us. After Lavina and Peter sold the farm in 1965, they moved into Swift Current. Lavina again did the house work for a while and then when the Swift Current Nursing Home was built she started working there as a Nursing Aide. She worked there for fourteen years. After she retired she hooked many a rug. Always made a garden every year and canned a lot of the fruit. But mostly in her spare time and at night when she couldnt sleep she would spend time praying for family members, especially Betty & John and their family and for Margaret. In the evening you would always hear the radio on CKSW listening to the gospel programs. She loved the Lord and the many songs that spoke about him and his love. We will miss her but we are thankful she is at peace in the care of Christ Jesus our Lord.
