Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 If Anyone Asks ^ Twenty years have passed since the first UFO sighting was reported in June 1947 by Kenneth Arnold who, in his description of what he saw, was to give the objects the name by which they have become popularly known, Fly- ing Saucers. During that twenty years hundreds of other sightings have been reported in this country and abroad, by sober minded persons of excellent reputation and often professional training who were willing to risk ridicule to bring attention to a phenomenon they knew deserved skilled and authorized investigation. There also have been numerous other reports from persons with over-stimulated imaginations and by irresponsible jokesters perpetrating out- right hoaxes. Unfortunately the latter took precedence and the general public, heedless of those sources which could not be challenged and of the impressive body of carefully re- searched material that was growing, sneered at the possibility that interplanetary craft could and probably does exist. It is only within recent years that the subject has been treated with an element of dignity and that serious con- sideration is being given to UFOs by one-time skeptics who came to laugh and stayed to cheer. Many persons, new to the proposal that interplanetary 2 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 Samples of this mark fond at rie, Pa , sighting last- Augus't,..pere, bottled and taken by Air Force for examination. ,,\" crafts may not only exist but be in successful exploratory operation are beset by questions that were answered long ago for the veteran UFOlogist. It is to these new comers that the following material is provided in answer to their questions. Cherry Creek, N.Y., August 19, 1965: A well docu- mented report, given attention by local news media, on file with Project Blue Book, NICAP, APRO, and men- tioned in Incident at Exeter, by John G. Fuller, tells of the experience of a 16-year-old farm boy whose attention was drawn from his farm chores by the noises made by a teth- ered bull \"like I never heard come from an animal before.\" Looking out in the direction of the disturbed animal, the youth saw a silvery, football-shaped object, \"like two plates, lip to lip,\" about 50 feet long and 20 feet thick, giving off a red vapor and a buzzing sound. The object disappeared briefly behind a tree and the boy ran toward it. He had not gone far when the object shot up into the clouds, turning them green from its reflected light and : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010002-9 giving off the odor of burned gasoline. The youth broadcast his sighting to everyone in the farm home and his brother raced out in time to see the red vapor disappearing into the clouds. Meantime, the mother of the boys had phoned the Fre- donia State Police Barracks to report the strange occur- rence. She was told that Trooper E. J. Haas would be right out. But before the trooper arrived, a 16-year-old girl, visit- ing at the farm home, ran in from outside to announce the Thing had returned. She and three of the boys raced off for a second look, this time at what they said was a yellow- ish object moving across the field some 700 feet away. When Trooper Haas arrived, he accompanied the 16- year-old boy to the spot where the object first had been sighted. Here they became aware of a pungent odor and saw, on the ground, a purplish substance that smelled not unlike household oil. Some of this was scraped up and given to the State Police who were said to have turned it over to the Niagara Falls Air Force Base. This substance later was said to have been a combination of three-in-one oil plus Bio-stringent (Gentian violet). Regulations forbid the Air Force to release information on such findings, but it was reported that the base did confirm that the four teen- agers \"did see something.\" The family reported that the ex- perience reduced the output of their cow from 21/2 cans to one can of milk. Erie, Pa., August 1, 1966: Equally certain that sighters had \"seen something\" were the officers who investigated a call to Beach 6 on the Peninsula of Presque Isle State Park, just outside of Erie. The initial call had come from a group of picnickers, a 22-year-old woman with two small children; an 18-year-old youth and a 16-year-old girl, all from the Jamestown, N.Y. area. Their car was stuck in the sand and they needed assistance. While they waited police arrival, they saw a star move. It got brighter, moved faster, then dimmed and came straight down, so close that the car vibrated. The object was described as being mush- roomed shaped with a narrow base rising to an oval struc- ture. There were lights on the back. It came in from the north, hovered briefly over the area, then landed. A beam of light came out from the craft and moved in a straight line along the ground, lighting up the whole woods. The object was then said to have taken off at a \"tremendous rate of speed.\" Shortly after it disappeared, Peninsula Po- lice Officers Ralph E. Clark and Robert Loeb, Jr., came on the scene, alerted by the report of a disabled car. The officers saw nothing in the area, but walked toward the spot where the object had been sighted, accompanied by the 18- year-old youth. They had been gone only briefly when they were drawn back on the run by the honking of the car horn. They found the 22-year-old mother hunched protectively over her two small children, and the 16-year-old girl so wet with perspiration her hair was stuck to her forehead. She was trembling violently and was almost incoherent. She said a featureless creature, gorilla shaped and standing six feet high had approached the car. His movements were sluggish and he moved off into the brush when she honked the car horn. Investigators from the Air Force and from a sub-com- mittee of NICAP in Jamestown, N.Y., came out to exam- ine the witnesses. They looked at .scratches on the car that the picnickers said had not been there when they ar- rived at Presque Isle, and dents in the car roof that had not been there. But their attention was focused primarily on two diamond-shaped impressions, about 18 inches wide and six to eight inches deep which were found some 350 yards from where the car was parked. Similar cone- shaped impressions were found leading down to the water. Patrolmen who examined the imprints said they appeared to have been made by claws \"as if you were to take four fingers and press hard on the sand.\" One of them thought the impressions looked as though someone had blown air into the sand \"as if you blew through a straw.\" Air Force Major William Hall, of Youngstown, took measurements and made casts of the impressions and checked for radiation. Tests were said to have been nega- tive. \"If they found anything of real value they haven't revealed it to me,\" Presque Isle Police Chief Dan Dascanio said. \"But from watching them work and their reactions to what they have looked at it appears that they did.find some- thing of interest.\" The chief was admittedly impressed by the girl's story. \"When she talked with an Air Force of- ficial . . . I could see that she made no attempt to fill in her story when she wasn't sure. When he asked her a speci- fic question, she said `yes' or `no'. It was obvious that she made no attempt to guess at any of the answers.\" He de- scribed her as a \"very credible\" person and added \"I've got to believe they saw something. . . .\" He did not accept the suggestion that the girl had seen a bear since bears were uncommon to the region. But there was more serious con- sideration given to the UFO sighting than the \"featureless creature.\" Samples from three spots of wet sand were bot- tled for analysis by the Air Force. The liquid was described as colorless, odorless and sticky to the, touch. It was pointed out that most soft drinks, coffee, water etc., evaporate quickly on the beach. These spots remained for a day. One officer gave some of the wet sand to a relative who is a chemist for analysis. The report came back that when dry, the substance formed a colorless material that could be bent without breaking, like plastic. Material was believed to be silicon. Pretoria, South Africa, September, 1965; Two police- men, Koos de'Klerk and Jochn Lockem out on routine call on asphalt highway saw what appeared to be a \"sea of flames\" ahead of them. Ten seconds later, a top-shaped object took off at tremendous speed and disappeared in the northwest. They heard no noise but saw jets of flame spurting from two openings on the underside of the object. Examining the road, they found a circular area, six feet in diameter, still burning and gras's scorched on both sides of. the road. Samples of the asphalt were examined by a tech- nician in the Public Works Department in Pretoria who said a gasoline fire could not possibly have caused the burn- ing of the road surface. continued on next page Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 3 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010002-9 Perhaps most significant, and certainly most aggravat- ing, is the common occurrence of electro-magnetic effects in those areas where UFOs are sighted. Single cars, blocks of houses and sometimes whole areas have suffered severe caprices of current when UFOs were overhead. The dis- turbance may be reflected in no more than a stalled motor or heavy static on the radio, but in Hammond, Ind., in 1957, while police chased a UFO, there was a TV black- out in the city. And in 1963, in Australia at the same time an unidentified object danced over the town of Won- thaggi, TV interference was recorded in three towns. There was a city light failure in Rome, Italy in 1958 at the same time a UFO passed over the city and in Brazil in 1959 the automatic keys at a power station flipped off as a UFO was spotted over the trunk line. After the ob- ject had passed the power station functioned normally. These are only a few of the instances and serious considera- tion is still being given by some students of the power line theory that UFOs played a role in the disastrous blackout along the Eastern Seaboard in November, 1965.

Source: Incident At Exeter, John G. Fuller Gulf of Mexico, December 6, 1952. One of the most fascinating accounts of radar tracked objects was reported in Major Keyhoe's Flying Saucers from Outer Space based on information released to him by Al Chop. The sighting was first made by a bomber pilot at 5:24 a.m., 100 miles south of the Louisiana coast. The pilot called his radar officer at the Texas base and asked him to check the coast- line on the auxiliary scope in the cockpit. Suddenly a blip appeared at one edge of the screen of the officer's main ra- darscope. In the next revolution, the unidentified craft had gone 13 miles. Its third appearance indicated the object would meet the B-29 headon. The radar officer yelled for the flight engineer to help track the object. Between the two of them they computed the object's speed at 5,240 mph. Such speeds seemed impossible to both the bomber pilot and the radar officer, who took time to recalibrate his set. He found no malfunction and by this time there were four UFOs on his screen and also seen by the pilot. During the first six minutes, five such saucers were sighted, all moving at more than 5000 mph. Then the scopes cleared. For one minute the airmen saw nothing. Then two blurs of blue-white whizzed by and five saucers raced in behind the bomber, cut across its course, then headed straight for the B-29. Disaster was imminent. Abruptly the UFOs slowed to the speed of the bomber and hung behind it for ten sec- onds. When they left, it was to join a huge mother ship that sloshed across the radar scope and was gone, at 9000 mph. Intelligence officers questioned the experienced air and radar men over and over again, receiving always the same unshakeable reports on speed, design and maneuvers. The experience could be explained in only one way: In- teplanetary machines. Custer, Wash., January 12, 1965: A farm family re- ported a glowing round object had landed on a snow cov- ered field briefly. After the object took off, the family checked and found the snow melted in a 30 foot circle and the earth scorched. Shortly before this brief landing, radar officers at Blaine Air Force Base had been tracking a 30- foot disc that had buzzed an automobile being driven by a federal law enforcement officer a few miles from the field. This officer's signed statement is on file with NICAP (Na- tional Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, in Washington D.C.) The farm family was quoted as having been instructed by the Air Force not to discuss the inci- dent. Source: Flying Saucers-Serious Business, by Frank Edwards On three occasions radar equipped F-94s locked on aeri- al targets only to have the lock-on broken by apparent vio- lent maneuvers of the target. Source: The Report on Unidentified Objects, by Edward J. Ruppelt, former head of the Air Force Project Blue Book. In Frank Edwards' highly informative Flying Saucers- Serious Business, he quotes Frank Halstead, Curator of the Darling Observatory, Duluth,. Minn. in an interview with the author: Edwards: \"A little while ago you stated that you believe that intelligent beings exist elsewhere in the universe, possibly, or probably, developed far beyond our intelligence levels in some instan- ces?\" Halstead: \"That is correct.\" Edwards: \"In that case they would already have solved the problems of crossing space, would they not?\" Halstead: \"I believe that is a reasonable assumption.\" Edwards: \"Such space travelers would conceivably have visited Earth, then?\" Halstead: \"This is pure speculation, or almost pure specu- lation, but I think that we should assume that we have had space visitors. . . . I feel that we have had visitors from space just as I feel that in the universe we are not alone.\" Edwards: \"In your opinion, Mr. Halstead, could the Uni- dentified Flying objects of our time be space ships?\" Halstead: \"Frankly, sir, they could hardly be anything else.\" The experience of Professor Walter N. Webb, chief lec- turer on astronomy at Charles Hayden Planetarium in Boston, who described the yellow glow that undulated over the hills at the south end of Silver Lake in Michigan in 1951 is another example of the trained eye confronted with an unidentifiable object. To the experienced astron- omer the wavey path ruled out planes and planets and ex- isting conditions ruled out inversion effect of ground based lights. The professor's conclusion : An UFO. To further substantiate the conviction of reputable astronomers that UFOs do exist, there is the account of Dr. Clyde Tom- baugh's experience in 1949. Dr. Tombaugh, discoverer of the planet, Pluto, was at his Las Cruces, New Mexico, home when he saw a cigar-shaped object silhouetted against the sky. He could make out a row of yellow lighted openings, giving the impression of portholes or windows, running continued on next page Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010002-9 from front to back. In a letter to Richard Hall, of NICAP, Dr. Tombaugh said these illuminated rectangles main- tained a fixed position in respect to each other, which sup- ported his impression of solidity. \"I was really petrified with astonishment,\" he wrote. And, in an article for Life magazine he stated that \"in all his long years of sky watch- ing he had never seen the equal of this remarkable craft.\" Greenville, S.C., May 13, 1952: Four astronomers watched four oval shaped glowing saucers flying in dia- mond-shaped formation. They were silent. They wobbled several times, then went out of sight. Source: Flying Saucers from Outer Space, Major Donald Keyhoe Cigar-shaped object is frequent sighting. This, over Anaheim, Cal., in 1957 \"flickered with reddish light.\" stated their belief in unidentified aerial objects and said that \"something beyond our ken is prowling the earth,\" and that \"we are not alone in the universe.\" Understandably, one of the first recorded sightings of a UFO, dating back to 1896 when a \"cigar-shaped\" object moving, unexplainably, into the wind was witnessed by hundreds of people on the West Coast in the San Fran- cisco area, triggered the same \"real\" and \"hoax\" response that such reports unleash today. Those who had seen it credited it as an authentic mystery ship and those who had not were quick to attribute it to pranksters in balloons. Astronomers could be found in both camps, those who at- tributed the sighting to Venus, or other planets, and those who, despite the threat of ridicule, held firmly to their convictions that the \"ship\" could not be so readily explained and that they had witnessed sound evidence of unidenti- fiable craft. The UFO Evidence quotes the late Dr. H. Percy Wil- kins, British lunar astronomer from his book \"Mysteries of Space and Time,\" in relation to that astronomer's recogni- tion that most UFOs can be attributed to conventional ob- jects: \". . . a residium remains which cannot be thus ex- plained.\" Part of this residium would logically have to in- clude the report submitted to NICAP by Dr. Charles H. Otis, professor emeritus of biology, Bowling Green State University. In his report, Dr. Otis told of sighting a num- ber of silent, wingless, high flying objects over Ann Arbor, Mich., in July, 1952. He counted 15 of what he referred to as \"ships,\" and described them as moving in the form of \"organized flotilla.\" They were identical in size and shape (elongated and split at the rear with no discernible cabin, windows or persons) and they maintained perfect position in the flotilla. Each \"ship\" gave off what the doctor de- scribed as a \"caterpillar track\" from their two pronged tails in the rear. Dr. Otis explored several possibilities that might account for these unwavering and glowing trails, but found none of them satisfactory. On the surface it may appear that astronomers who do not believe in interplanetary craft exceed those who do. The theory has been offered, however, that these astrono- mers are inclined to be more vocal than their more credu- lous colleagues. The scorn and ridicule of a nation are not easy to accept and it has been well.demonstrtaed that un- less a person has seen a UFO for himself he is inclined to be not just skeptical but downright insulting in his attitude toward believers. A man of science would be understand- ably reluctant to expose himself to the jibes of his col- leagues, employers and audience. An impressive listing of UFO sightings by scientists is provided in The UFO Evidence, supplemented by detailed reports and sketches on some of the more noteworthy ex- periences. The introduction to this section carries the The A.P.R.O. Bulletin, official publication of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, with headquarters in Tucson, Ariz., recently reported on a sighting made in 1964 by two technicians attached to the Cosmic Radiation Center at Chile University near Santiago, Chile. They had been awakened by the intense heat in their room despite the piercing cold on that November night at that altitude. One of the men went outside, found the heat there even more intense and the. mountain lighted up by a bright or- ange color. Afraid some tanks of liquid gas had caught fire, he called to his companion. The other man arrived just in time to see an object ascend from the bottom of the canyon and disappear from sight in the sky at a tremendous speed. Dr. Gabriel Alvial, Director of the center, and Professor Claudio Anguita, Director of the Astronomical Observatory of Chile University, in reporting the incident to the press, Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010002-9 Jet crewman sent up over Capital in 1952 to scout UFOs seen twice over Washington, D.C. views of three world-famous scientists among whom is Pro- fessor Hermann Oberth, pioneer in space travel, who was convinced that UFOs \"are piloted by super-intelligent be- ings from another planet.\" For those to whom acceptance of such a far out explana- tion is unthinkable, Edward J. Ruppelt in The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects reminds us that only 100 years ago two eminent members of the French Academy of Sci- ences rejected meteorites in the same way with a scathing: \"It can't be . . . stones don't fall from the sky.\" And that at about the same time our own then Chief Engineer for the Navy labeled the possibility of flying heavier-than-air craft as absurd and it was only twenty years ago that our Chief of Staff to the President said of the atomic bomb : \"It will never go off, and I speak as an expert in explosives.\" These incidents may have prompted Ruppelt to close his fine book with \". . . maybe the many pilots, radar spe- cialists, generals, industrialists, scientists and the man on the street who have told me `I wouldn't have believed it either if I hadn't seen it myself,' knew what they were talking. about.\" It was the pilot of a privately owned plane who made the first recorded sighting, Kenneth Arnold; gave it its name, Flying Saucers; and submitted information without which no history of UFOs in America would be complete. That was on June 24, 1947 in the vicinity of Mt. Ranier, Wash., when the observer watched nine disc shaped ob- jects flying in linked line, \"much like geese.\" He was a veteran mountain pilot, flying his own plane, over country familiar to him. During the less than two minutes they were in view he estimated their length at 45 to 50 feet; their speed at 1,700 mph; their distance from him at 20-25 miles away. They had a skipping motion and every so often two or three would dip or shift course and occasionally disappear behind a peak of the Cascade Mountains. The skeptics spiked away at Arnold's account, unwilling to accept the speed at which he had estimated their flight; the distance away . . . settling finally, for their own peace of mind, on jets as the explanation, although there was one school that held out for wind whipping snow over the mountain ridges. There were many others, however, familiar with Ar- nold's experience, character and knowledge of the region who were less anxious to kiss off this incident. As publicity built, Arnold was interviewed by intelligence officers from HQ of the Fourth Air Force. The interviewer stated that. in his opinion, Arnold had seen what he stated he saw. This opinion was shared by many newsmen in the area who had considered the story a hoax at inception, planned to report it as such, but came away, after intensive investiga- tion, with the same \"saw-what-he-said conviction.\" The conclusion of the Army Air Force's was that Mr. Arn- old had seen a mirage, brought about by existing atmos- pheric conditions. continued on next page Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 7 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010002-9 At that time the American public might not have been prepared for any other conclusion, but the flood of reports that followed hot on the heels of the Arnold sighting was to sew doubt in the minds of many of those who had dis- missed this initial \"saucer\" as a misconception. There was a report the next month from a test pilot at what is now Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mo- jave Desert. He watched what he thought was a weather balloon until he saw that it was going against the wind. He described it as spherical in shape, yellow-white in color. Two hours later, in the same neighborhood, a crew of tech- nicians sighted what they thought was a parachute can- opy. Then they realized it was traveling too fast for a test parachute, and against the wind. It was soundless, had no Pilots are more certain of their sightings than others. Here two swear to \"pinkish-pancake\" object. visible means of propulsion and, after 90 seconds, disap- peared behind mountains. Their ofiinions, based on the shape and functional appearance, was that the object was man-made. One year later, in July of 1948, a pilot flying a com- mercial airliner from Houston, Tex. to Atlanta, Ga., saw a bright light closing in on him so fast that he knew it could not be a jet. He nudged his co-pilot, then wheeled in a tight left turn as the object spun off 700 feet to the right. The pilots described a deep blue glowing underside, two rows of glowing windows and a 50-foot trail of red- orange flame. The only passenger who witnessed the inci- dent saw \"a strange, eerie streak of light, very intense.\" When the crew chief at the Air Force Base near Macon, Ga., reported seeing a bright light in the same vicinity, traveling at tremendous speed, and a pilot over the Vir- ginia-North Carolina line reported a \"bright shooting star\" at the same time over Montgomery, Ala., the ATIC took notice. After investigation they summed up the glowing fast-traveler as a meteor. Major Donald Keyhoe, in his Fly- ing Saucers From Outer Space, has reported that the project analyst himself was not happy with this summation and allowed that it \"seems very improbable.\" That the ultimate conclusions on what UFO sighters have seen should rest with the Air Force has proved dis- quieting to many observers and particularly unsettling to experienced pilots who feel that they are sufficiently fa- miliar with known air craft and with the constellations not to be bamboozled into easy mistakes. A case in point is that of Captain Peter Killian, flying an American Air- lines cargo plane from Newark to Detroit in February, 1959. What he saw were three brightly lighted UFOs that kept pace with his plane, changing position as they moved. What he was told he saw was a military tanker refueling some jets. Other air crews in the area had reported seeing the same objects. It is not easy to convince veteran pilots that they have been fooled into mistaking fueling tankers and jets for UFOs. So the Air Force offered another con- clusion : the constellation Orion. But how to explain the stars in Orion changing formation. For Captain Killian, those UFOs are unexplained. Coral Lorenzen, who with her husband L. J. Lorenzen, direct the activities of the highly reputable Aerial Phe- nomena Research Orgainzation in Tucson, Ariz., has cited the experience of another far from satisfied pilot in her well researched book Flying Saucers: The Startling Evi- dence of The Invasion From Outer Space. It was APRO's investigation of a 1961 sighting near Salt Lake City, Utah, that familiarized her with the aspects of Pilot Waldo J. Harris' frustrating brush with the Air Force. Harris, who from the ground had seen what he thought was a plane in the sky as he was -about to take off on a routine flight around noon of October 2, 1961, was sur- prised when he got aloft to see that the object was still in the same position as it had been when he first saw it. Puz- zled, he headed for it and saw what he described as a large disc, undulating at an altitude of some 6500 feet. His radioed report to the airport brought out several inter- ested spectators who trained their binoculars on the maneu- Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 vering pilot and the object as Harris tried to close in. Harris got within what he estimated was three miles of the object, near enough to see that its surface was not un- like \"sand blasted\" aluminum, approximately 50 feet in diameter and five to ten feet thick at the center. Although in its rocking motion it sometimes took on the look of a zeppelin, when it finally took off, going straight up, then to the south, Harris could see it was more like a disc, plates linked by their lips. The UFO hovered briefly over Lake Omni station, then with a great thrust of speed, moved west and out of sight within seconds. By the time the Lorenzens interviewed Harris, they were familiar with the conclusions of the Air Force on this sight- ing: A research balloon or Venus. The veteran pilot was familiar with the Pentagon established conclusion, too. But he had seen a gray disc, hovering, then shooting off with terrific acceleration to the south then the west, against the 'wind. This was Venus? This was a weather balloon? Two Navy commanders and several other officers from Na- val Intelligence interviewed Harris, too. They didn't try to sway the pilot's convictions. They, too, were convinced the object was real and unidentified. A concise, convincing and provocative report on Sau- cers. was submitted to Project Blue Book in 1954 by Lieu- tenant Colonel Richard Headrick, USAFR, senior pilot, and later confirmed by letter in a brief description to NICAP which reports it in The UFO Evidence, pg. 25, in the same outline the colonel presented. 1. \"Saucers exist. (I saw two). 2. They were intelligently controlled or operated. (Evasive tactics, formation flight, hovering flight.) 3. They are not propelled on any thermodynamic prin- ciple. (No contrails while jet intercept aircraft left heavy ones.) 4. They are mechanisms rather than hallucinations, op- tical illusions, natural phenomena. The Colonel's evaluation : 5. They are not U.S. secret weapons, for if they were, many contracts I am now working on would be dropped. Also they would not fly outside military test reservations: 6. They are not Russian for similar reasons. Russians have complained about their flying over their borders. They would not risk malfunction over our territory. 7. I presume they are extraterrestrial. 8. Provided they are, interstellar navigation would like- ly present little more complication than navigation within our solar system. Therefore, discussion on whether or not planets in the solar system are capable of supporting life is not material. 9. Judging from all evidence I have read, personal con- tact has not yet been established either on the ground or by the radio transmission.\" It makes sense that a sizable number of UFO reports would come from the men who make their living in the skies and who are conversant with the types of curious lights and shapes with which they may come in contact. Airline pilots have been the source of some of the most in- formative reports that are on record with the Air Force from the time of its initial organized filing, first with Proj- ect Sign then Project Grudge, and finally Project Blue Book. But in the Spring of 1950 even this usually calm branch of the service was jolted by the number and quality of reports from pilots that began to pour in. In three months, starting with April, air line crews had accounted for 35 reports on UFOs and Captain Eddie Rickbacker, in an interview, quoted in The UFO Evidence, pg. 33, said: \"Flying saucers are real. Too,many good men have seen them, that don't have hallucinations.\" It was not until the summer of 1952, however, that the very capital itself was rocked. That was with the famous sightings over Washington, D.C., sightings that hit the headlines with INTERCEPTORS CHASE FLYING SAUCERS OVER WASHINGTON, D.C., before Air Force Intelligence even knew about it. There had been forewarnings, sightings near Quantico, and Newport News, Va., another at Langley Air Force Base, another 60 miles southwest of Washington, all within a few nights of each other in mid-July. But on July 19, it was Washington, D.C., on the nose, picked up by radar at National Airport and at Andrews, and reported as 8 unidentified targets near Andrews AFB, accelerating too rapidly to be planes. Airline pilots were also sighting the unknown lights that slowed, then spurted ahead with fantastic speed. Within 14 minutes, one pilot spotted six. The grandaddy of them all was a huge \"fiery orange\" sphere that hung over the Andrews Radio range station. That many crack radar experts and veteran pilots couldn't be kissed off. They had seen something and it fell to Edward Ruppelt, then head of Project Blue Book, to decide what explanation the Air Force could release to the press. A week later, Washington had its second visit. This time the objects were spread in an are around the nation's capi- tol and jets were being vectored out to see what they were. The objects would shoot off before the jets could get near. It wasn't easy for nerve-wracked Air Intelligence to fend off the public excitement and queries engendered by such headlines as FIERY OBJECTS OUTRUN JETS OVER CAPI- TAL. One of the most sympathetic chapters in Ruppelt's excellent Report On Unidentified Objects, deals with the almost insoluble problem that confronted ATIC during that week. It was a chance remark by an ATIC official, sug- gesting that the radar targets might have been caused by temperature inversions, according to Ruppelt's account, that eventually got the press off their backs and quieted a dis- tressed nation with the headline AIR FORCE DEBUNKS SAUCERS AS JUST NATURAL PHENOMENA. Although Mr. Ruppelt acknowledged that the \"twin sightings are still carried as unknowns.\" Yes, one does find skeptics and outright non-believers among the air pilots of all nations. But one finds solid converts to the UFO legions, too, one of whom, Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding, RAF (England) was quoted in a UFO activity report released in 1965 by NICAP: \"I am convinced that these objects do exist and that they are not manufactured by any nation on earth . . . (they must) come from some extraterrestrial source.\" Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100O0V O 9n next page Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 One's inclination if he sights a strange object in the sky is to stand open mouthed and ogle.

The man who was bounced, was a sturdy Venezuelan who, in the early morning hours of November 28, 1954 was on his way from Caracas to Petare with his assistant to pur- chase produce. They stopped their truck to investigate a luminous sphere, ten feet in diameter, that hovered a few feet from the ground ahead of them. The hairy little person who ap- proached them should have been easy to overpower and take to the police. Such goings-on deserved official investi- gation. But when the produce merchant prepared to take the little man in, he became involved in a scuffle of unim- agined proportions. The helper, who at first was inclined to go to his employ- er's assistance, changed his mind when he saw two other tiny creatures come out from the bushes, carrying rocks, and enter the illuminated sphere through a side opening. The helper ran for police, leaving his employer alone with the creatures. In his effort to escape, the produce merchant drew a knife. It glanced off the hard, hairy little body as though he'd struck steel and in the next instant he was blinded by a stream of light from a small tube directed into his face by one of the other small creatures. Unarmed, disabled and outmanned, the man sank to the ground in a frenzy of fright and the sphere took off in a great blast of speed. When-help arrived, the man was given medical treatment for a long red gash in his side and subjected to extensive police questioning, but found to be completely sober and visibly upset by his experience. Pure .fiction, you say, stemming from the possible sighting of some easily explained natural phenomenon that, in the eerie predawn hours, played havoc with the imaginations of two Venezuelan working men. But hold, the above 'account which is reported in detail in Coral Lorenzen's Flying Saucers (Signet) does not stop there. A few days later, one of the doctors who had examined the victim, reported that he actually had witnessed the in- cident. He had been making a night call when he came upon the stopped truck and saw the fantastic skirmish. Not wanting to get involved in undesirable publicity, he drove off and even at the time he revealed this information he re- fused to permit use of his name. But the incident was brought to the attention of American' authorities and the doctor was invited to Washington,. D.C. to give his first hand account. Nor was this the. only instance of an encounter with \"lit- tle hairy creatures\" in that area. Less than a month later, two young rabbit hunters were set upon by four tiny manlike creatures. One of the hunters tried to fend off the assailants with his shotgun, but the weapon burst apart with the blow \"as though it had struck rock.\" The youths, scratched, bruised and close to hysteria, were questioned by police and by psychiatrists who found them to be \"sane, responsible.\" and \"badly frightened by something very unusual.\" A few days later, another man was set upon by a small, hairy person in the woods of the Ministry of Agriculture's Exposition Park. Two friends of his, one a member of the National Guard, heard his screams and came upon him un- conscious on the ground just as a hairy little man leaped into a shiny disc like craft that then took off with a deafen- ing buzz. Authorities found all three men to be extremely frightened and the actual victim in a state of shock with severe gashes on his side and back that looked like claw marks: In Coral Lorenzen's Flying Saucers, this account is mentioned as \"one of the first believable accounts of contact with occupants of UFOs.\" Less believable, but more fascinating, is the story of a 23-year old Brazilian farmer, whose experience was investi- gated in depth by APRO representative Dr. Olavos Fontes, and presented in detail in Flying Saucers (Signet),. This man was \"kidnaped\" right off his own tractor in a freshly plowed field and taken aboard a \"torpedo-shaped\" ship that was a glowing red until it settled to the ground on three metal protrusions. Then it went dark. The \"kidnap- ers\" were little creatures in striped grey suits and strange helmets from which tubes ran from top to back. The farmer, once inside what appeared to be a metal craft lighted from the ceiling, was bathed in a thick, clear liquid. Then two tubes were placed against his chin and blood was drawn off into a vessel. The experience made him nauseous and he was placed on a bed in a room from which a greyish vapor exuded through tiny holes in the wall. It was here he was visited by a blonde woman, short, well-formed and complete with all features except a mouth which was only a slit, no lips. Within short order, she had seduced him twice. Then she left and the farmer was given his clothes and taken on a conducted tour of the \"ship,\" through what appeared to be a control room. He tried to snatch up a small box he found there as proof of his experience, but it was taken from him and he was released from the ship. He found that the wires had been detached from the tractor battery, though once replaced, the machine ran all right. The farmer, however, didn't function so well the first several days after his experience. He was restless, couldn't sleep; his body itched and purple sores broke out in various places. Dr. Fontes interviewed this young man at a time when sores were still visible on the man's body and the bruise marks, reportedly left by the tubes inserted to draw blood, could still be seen on his chin. Dr. Fontes found him to be a \"healthy, normal man with no obvious psychological prob- lems,\" (The APRO Bulletin, July-August 1966). The man was reluctant to discuss the seduction but did mention that. the sound made by all of the creatures was a \"growling noise,\" and at,_.times he was \"repelled by the sounds the woman made.\" Dr. Fontes' complete report was sent to APRO in 1958 and has since been incorporated in Coral Lorenzen's Flying Saucers in a far more detailed and extensive account. Any- one familiar with the report and with the published experi- ences of Barney and Betty Hill, of New Hampshire (re- ferred to in another part of this magazine) cannot help but be struck by the resemblances, as was Mrs. Lorenzen, in the two recollections, there are references to the \"slit-like continued on next page Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 1 3 Dumb-bell shaped foot imprints suggested a waddling step rather than the stiff-legged gait of a robot. A heavy weight had made the clear im- prints. Investigators were skeptical of their value as evidence. mouths,\" the animal sounds, and the attempts to take some- thing from the ship as evidence of the experience. Mrs. Lorenzen closes her account of the Brazilian experi- ence with: \"Whhn Dr. Fontes visited Mr. Lorenzen and me during one of his trips to the United States, I asked him point blank. `Do you believe (the V-B) story, Olavo?' His reply: `It is too bizarre to believe.' \" Not all bizarre encounters with \"little hairy men\" how- ever have taken place south of the border. North America has its own recorded examples, some of which aroused enough concern to send Air Force intelligence out on in- vestigative trips of no small dimension. The first of these really shook the rafters of the Pentagon and reverberated throughout the nation. It had to do with a scoutmaster in West Palm Beach, Fla., a former Marine and a \"solid citizen.\" On the night of August 19, 1952, he was driving three scouts home from a meeting when his attention was drawn to a peculiar light about 30 yards off the road in a palmetto thicket. Ordering the boys to stay in the car, he took a ma- chete and flashlight and went off to investigate. He later reported that he had come upon a clearing over which hovered a large, saucer-shaped object with turret top and several regularly spaced vanes between each of which were nozzle-like openings. He was aware of an oppressive heat and a pungent odor, but more than that, he was annoyed by the spooky feeling that he was being watched. He wanted to strike out at what- ever this \"thing\" was, but suddenly a ball of red fire spurted out and he was enveloped in a vapor-like mist. He lost con- sciousness. Meantime the three scouts, aware that something was wrong back in the palmetto thicket, had run for help. They returned with a farmer and his wife and members of the Florida State Highway Patrol. They found the scoutmaster just climbing back onto the road, so scared he could scarcely tell his story. Advised roughly of what had happened, the group moved back into the palmettos and relocated the clearing. The grass was flattened out and the flashlight still lay there. The scoutmaster was rushed into the sheriff's office. His face and arms showed evidence of burning, his hair was singed and there were burns in his cap. The Air Force was promptly alerted. The scout leader was subjected to a thorough examination that substantiated the burnings, even to scorched nostrils. Air Force investigators examined the scene of the \"inci- dent,\" went over the ground with Geiger counters, could find no burnt matches or evidence that lightning had struck or that a fire had deliberately been set. They took the ma- chete and the cap for laboratory analysis and later indicated that their findings lent credence to the fantastic story. The cap carried strong evidence of scorching that could have been achieved by pressing with a hot iron, but there also were tiny spark burns that could not be explained in this fashion. But the most convincing evidence that the scoutmaster had, indeed, been victim of a nightmare experi- ence was contained in some sample grass clumps taken from the scene. The grass itself was undamaged, but the roots were charred.

One of the deep round depressions found af- ter third visit to Weeki-Wachi Springs cite of a \"space craft visit.\" Was it left by the landing gear, or part of an elaborate hoax perpetrated on a ready public? Objects, (Doubleday) acknowledges this was startling evi- dence in support of the scoutmaster's story. \"The only way it could have been faked would have been to heat the earth from underneath to 300 degrees F, and how do you do this without using big, cumbersome equipment and disturbing the ground? You can't.\" The Air Force through its Project Blue Book set-up was left with the unpleasant task of having to minimize this highly publicized report in the face of almost indisputable evidence to support it. The story had appeared in almost every paper in the country and had been believed by many readers. But ATIC wrote it off as a hoax. \"The best hoax in UFO history,\" (The Report on Unidentified Flying Ob- jects. ) The scoutmaster's story, now 15 years old, is being dusted off and reviewed with less skeptical eye in the light of more recent happenings. that, though they may not rattle the im- perturbable \"show me\" types, have seriously disturbed those who recognize that \"anything can happen,\" and perhaps has. As a matter of record, just a few months after the Florida story, a family in West Virginia was \"shown\" in a manner it had no desire to-be. They were investigating a glowing ob- ject that appeared to have landed on a hill behind their home. One of the youths carried a flashlight and in its beam he saw a shape which he first believed to be a woods animal. Moving closer, he made out what was later described as a huge monster with glowing body and bulging eyes. The family raced home to safety, but found some of their bodies to be covered with an oilish substance and during the night all of the youngsters became ill, their throats swelled and one of them went into convulsions. Local authorities investigated the scene the next morning and found matted grass and bits of black plastic. The inci- dent might have been dismissed as an example of imagined horrors in the wake of sighting some unexplained night time light of eerie dimension. But that same day hundreds of other reports filtered in from other people in the surrounding area who had sighted strange lights and objects in the sky the previous evening. Among these was a member of the schoolboard who said he had seen a strange craft take off from the hilltop. The Air Force wrote the light off as a meteor; the monster as a clump of shrubbery given spooky shape by a boy's over stimulated imagination; the glowing=eyes as those of an owl. Moreover, ATIC claimed it was making no investigation of the incident. Monster stories would'have to be expected in view of the temporary excitement generated by the series of sightings in 1952, and ATIC could not give its time to every scare story that hit the papers. Local investigators were less inclined to kiss-off the inci- dent, and it was later disclosed that despite the claims of ATIC that the story was not of enough value to warrant investigation, a team of plain-clothes investigators, passing themselves off as salesmen, had canvassed the area, asking questions pertinent to the \"monster\" sighting and not at all pertinent to the product they were peddling. Several per- sons suspected these salesmen actually were representatives from Army intelligence, working in secret to avoid rousing public panic over the possibility that the Pentagon did lend credence to the story. The allegation has been denied by the Air Force. continued on next page Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010002-9 15 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010002-9 Similar allegations were denied again in 1957 when an incident of equally chilling proportions was reported along the Indiana-Kentucky border. This, too, involved a family who had gone out to investigate a glowing object that had set their dog to barking. They claim to have been confronted by a tiny creature under four feet high, dressed in an aluminum suit and pos- sessed of web-like hands. Two male members of the family were said to have fired on the thing which fell back and ran off. Later the creature was said to have been seen clinging to the screen of a window in the home and glaring at the fright-numbed residents through wide-slit eyes. Again the men fired on it, driving it away. There was a third visit that night, and a third firing. This time the shots were heard to strike metal and there were confirming reports from people in the neighborhood who said they heard the shots and the \"hits.\" Whatever appeared at that home that night threw a para- lyzing fear into the tenants, as was attested to by the local police chief when the family appeared in the neighboring town that night to tell of its hair-raising experience. The Air Force sent investigators out for a brief interview with the victims and then was said to have dismissed the incident as without value to them. But local residents were aware, two weeks later, of a team of door-to-door peddlers who seemed more interested in the tale of the tin-suited visitors than they were in selling their products. A much more recent encounter with \"humanoids\" was reported in detail in The APRO Bulletin, March-April 1965. The experience deals with the Florida \"landing\" in- cident near Weeki-Wachi Springs and is one that is viewed with a skeptical eye by the directors of APRO for reasons they mention in their report. But with their commendable caution and researchists' instinct for waiting until all of the answers are in, they announce that they are not yet closing the books on the case. Much of the following material was drawn from the ac- count appearing in the above mentioned issue of the APRO Bulletin. The meeting occurred about a mile and a half from the Weeki-Wachi Springs home of a 65-year-old Florida man who was out walking in the sand dunes that afternoon of March 2, 1965, when his attention was attracted to a strange space-ship some 150 feet away. While he was studying this most unusual saucer-like craft, a robot-like creature emerged from the brush, walked to within 15 feet of the man, pulled a rounded black object from his pocket and flashed it once, \"like lightning at night.\" Then ran off. The man, as one might expect, fled too. But in his haste he stumbled against a bush, knocking loose his glasses. When he bent to retrieve them, he lost his hat. While he was trying to recover these dropped articles, the \"robot\" re- appeared, placed the little black object against his chin again, flashed the light once more, then raced to the craft and took off at high speed. The \"witness\", relieved that the visitor and his funny flying macine were gone, was curious by this time and went back to examine the spot where the \"ship\" had been. He found two folded sheets of paper of tissue texture which he pocketed for closer scrutiny. Then he went home to examine his experience under calmer conditions. He waited overnight to report the incident, claiming that he did not think he would be believed. But when .finally he did appear in the office of a radio station in Brooksville, it was to give a remarkably detailed description of the robot he had seen. \"Roughly five feet tall and clothed in a silver-gray, stiff- appearing suit atop which was a helmet much like a glass bowl inverted over its head and resting on its shoulders. The head inside was covered by dark material which covered the hair area. The ears, mouth and nose appeared normal, but the eyes were large and very wide set, with a \"flat-area\" between. The hands were covered by mittens which ap- peared to be very pliable and the same color as the suit.\" The space-ship, shaped like a soap bubble, was of irri- descent cast with reddish-purple and greenish-blue predom- inating. Slats circled the airfoil and when the craft took off these opened and shut with a rumbling noise. The landing gear folded up into the belly of the ship. The ship moved in a vertical direction at high speed and was gone within 15 seconds. APRO's Florida investigator was in touch with the man from Weeki-Wachi Springs soon after word of his experi- ence was made known. He extracted much information from the man that had not been released to the press and he was at first impressed with the witness' seeming reliability and powers of observation. But the same afternoon that the man appeared at the radio station, Air Force personnel ar- rived from MacDill Field to scrutinize the scene and the subject and representatives from magazines and entertain- ment media moved in to see in what fashion this latest re- port on \"humanoids\" could best be exploited. More than a day had passed since the time of the en- counter; rains had washed out what physical evidence might have existed and it was reported that a lie-test had tended to discredit some of the man's story. A carnival at- mosphere surrounded the section, attracting sightseers, pho- tographers, feature writers and souvenir hunters. Those who were there for the purpose of extracting facts, including a second APRO representative, came away with the impression that the whole thing was a hoax. Those who were there to milk the incident of its human interest value had a field day. The notes, hieroglyphics penned on tissue-thin paper, were turned over to the Air Force and it was later reported that simple deciphering had broken the code on 18 letters of the alphabet and that the notes were the work of an ama- teur. Analysis has established that the paper itself was made of commonly found fibers used extensively in the manufac- ture of certain tissues. The Air Force concluded that fur- ther analysis from that quarter would be an unnecessary expense and unrewarding procedure. From other sources it was learned that the man from Weeki-Wachi Springs had in some manner assimilated a 16 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : Cl message from his visitor on March 2 that the robot would be baek.in 29 days. It has been reported in Saucer News, June ?111966, that the \"witness\" returned to the scene with two friends on the afternoon of March 31 and that the three of them did see the saucer-shaped ship come in over the dunes but that it was intercepted by an Air Force jet and disappeared from sight in five seconds. The Air Force denies that such an incident occurred. The subject was to make still a third trip to the sight of his initial \"encounter\"; this time in October, 1965, accord- ing to reports. On this occasion he was said to have found footprints, sharply defined, as though made by heavy weights (see photograph). They were \"dumb-bell shaped\" and the sequence of steps revealed what would be something of wad- dling movement as opposed to the more stiff-legged gait of the \"robot.\" At the same time that the footprints were \"found,\" four, deep, circular impressions, such as might have been left by the landing gear of the craft, were \"located,\" and photo- graphed. The consensus is that the October visit with its accom- panying \"finds\" was definitely a hoax perpetrated by local publicity seekers. There are some who believe the March 31 sighting did take place and that evidence exists to verify the \"near colli- sion\" with the Air Force jet. Such evidence has not been re- leased. There are many who accept the man's first \"encounter\" as a possibility. With characteristic thoroughness, the APRO organiza- tion deciphered the note message in its entirety in the be- lief that no piece of evidence should be dismissed without careful scrutiny regardless of dubious aspects attached to the experience. The message in toto ran : \"Planet Mars . . . are you coming home soon . . . we miss you very much . . . why did you stay away too long\". Attention is drawn to the last sentence which suggests that the writer was not too conversant with the English lan- guage. Previously the announcement had been made that the two notes appeared to have been penned by different writers. APRO directors mention the possibility that in the event the \"landing\" occurred, the occupants of the craft might have enclosed their intended message within the folds of an easily translatable phoney to muddy the path for investigators. They refer to the fact that the Air Force decoded only a part of one message and did nothing about the other. APRO holds no brief for the authenticity of the story, per se, but it does call attention to the fact that in May, 1965, a polygraph test administered to the man revealed he was a normal reactor who exhibited guilt reactions when he attempted deception and that his responses to pertinent questions in four separate tests exposed no such deception. The position adopted by APRO is that the incident may well have been a hoax, but if so, the subject had help, \"pos- sibly hypnosis was used. Whoever participated in the hoax, however, would have had to have a very intimate knowledge of UFO lore. Then we must search among ourselves.\" (The APRO Bulletin).

A green- ish vapor hung about it as it made an undulating but ex- tremely fast line for land. Watching it were nearly 100 persons, crew members of the Brazilian Navy's Almirante Saldanha, on a routine trip from Rio de Janeiro to the island. The time was just past noon on January 16 in the International Geophysi- cal Year, 1958, and the personnel of the ship, which had been participating in IGY exercises, included a retired Brazilian Air Force officer, Captain Jose Teobaldo and a a group of submarine explorers headed by Amilar Vieira Fil- ho. Also aboard, by invitation of the Navy, to photograph some of the exercises, was Almiro Barauna, professional photographer. \"Get Barauna,\" was the first thought as the amazed viewers watched the unidentifiable object. In seconds Bar- auna was there with his camera. He scanned the area sin- gled out for him by the excited crewmen, seeking his sub- ject. Then he saw it \"like the flight of a bat\" coming in to- ward a point of land named \"Galo Crest.\" He set his Rolleiflex 2.8, Model E, at 1/125 with an f/8 opening (a choice he later realized had overexposed the film), and got off two shots before the glowing, saturn- like object disappeared behind Desejado Peak. The viewers crowded in, their attention riveted on the R peak behind which the object had sped. Within seconds it was back again, lower, larger and flying in the opposite direction. Barauna got three more shots but the last two were lost; the object was traveling rapidly and the witnesses were pushing and jostling for better viewing position; cer- .tainly not ideal conditions for a photographer. Then for a moment the object appeared to stop in mid-air. Barauna took one more shot, his last. The object picked up speed and disappeared. The film was processed on the ship under the vitally interested eyes of several officers including Commander Carlos A. Bacallar. Only the negatives were available for examination at the time since there was no photographic paper on hand, but these were scrutinized by every person aboard and two days later, after the ship had returned to port, enlargements of the prints were turned over to Navy authorities who sent them to Cruzeiro du Sul Aerophoto- grammetric service to be analyzed. The report: Negatives were genuine. No evidence of a trick or falsification. Barauna was subjected to further investigation by na- val authorities, and other witnesses aboard the ship were questioned. Ultimately Barauna was told that the chief intelligence officer was convinced the photos were authen- tic and congratulations were extended to the photographer. The reports gained widespread attention but the photos were not released at the time.

Typical of the con- scientious work done by researchists and investigators for APRO, Dr. Fontes went to the Navy Ministry, was shown the four photos, plus a fifth which he learned later had been taken by another photographer at an earlier sighting in the same area. In his characteristically well documented report to APRO (later published in the January, March and May, 1960, APRO Bulletins, and incorporated in The Great Flying Saucer Hoax, by Coral E. Lorenzen, co-founder of APRO), Dr. Fontes revealed some startling and hitherto un- published information. There had been six previous sight- ings in the Trindade area before the filmed sequence taken aboard the Almirante Saldanha; one in November, two in December and four in early January. It was the sixth of these, an incident on January 6, that held the attention of Dr. Fontes. On that date a weather balloon, equipped with a full in- strument load to be jettisoned some 14,000 feet up over Trindade, was being tracked from the ground when its sig- nals suddenly became faint and its transmitter finally si- lent. The balloon was still climbing and nearing the cumu- lus cloud head when it appeared to be sucked into a cloud and disappeared from sight. Ten minutes later it reap- peared, traveling so fast that it was apparent the instru- ment load was gone. Somehow the balloon had entered the cloud with the full instrument load and reappeared ten minutes later without it. The instruments were never found; never seen coming down. Then from Coral Lorenzen's ac- The last shot as UFO seemed to stop'in mid-air.

A silvery object, the color of polished aluminum, came slowly from behind the cloud, moving in a south-west to east direction . . . it appeared to have the shape of a half-moon, and it altered its course finally, moving from east to west.\" In the seventh sighting, occurring just a few days be- fore Barauna filmed his shots, witnesses described the ob- ject they saw hovering over Desejado peak as a \"highly pol- ished flattened spheroid,\" encircled by a rapidly spinning ring. It appeared to be intelligently controlled. A photo of this is the one Dr. Fontes believes to have been the fifth photo shown him\" by the Navy Ministry. It is in her book that Coral Lorenzen brings several items to the attention of UFOlogists: (1) The unidenti- fied objects were sighted at the scene of and only after a former war base was reactivated and supplied with men and equipment. (2) One and possibly two of these ob- jects were photographed and the one set of photos that was subjected to extensive investigation and analysis by ob- jective agents, was declared genuine and without evi- dence of trickery or falsification. (3) Indication of inter- ference with a weather balloon by an unidentified object that may have absconded with meteorological instrumenta- tion equipment. (4) Only pressure from the press and public brought about publication of the photos which had been treated with utmost secrecy by the Brazilian Navy.

Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 \"I'm Still Climbing... ^ On file with Project Blue Book is. the account of an early sighting fatality that has baffled UFO historians since news of it was first flashed to a shocked public in 1948 with the words \"F-51 AND CAPT. MANTELL DESTROYED CHASING FLYING SAUCER.\" The death and the puzzling circumstances surrounding it are referred to today as The Mantell Incident, but at the moment of the first sighting, 1 :20 p.m., January 7, 1948, Captain Thomas Mantell was on a ferry mission, more than an hour away from knowledge of the tragedy which fate had in store for him.. A bright disc shaped object had been seen by the tower crew at Godman Field, Ky. Unable to identify it, the crew brought the object to the attention of the Base Operations Officer, Base Intelligence Officer and, eventually, Base Com- mander. Flight Commander Captain Mantell flew over the field at 2:45 p.m. and was requested to investigate the UFO, which by this time had drawn the attention of, and queries from, people in Maysville and Owensboro., Ky., sev- eral of whom described the object as \"circular\" as much as \"300 feet in diameter\" and \"moving at a pretty good clip.\" Mantell, accompanied by two wing men, all flying F- 51s, set off in pursuit and at 10,000 feet, Mantell called the tower to report \"I see something above and ahead of me and I'm still climbing.\" The other two wing men leveled off at 15,000 feet and turned back. Neither they nor Mantell were outfitted for flights requiring oxygen and any height above 15,000 feet could be disastrous. They had tried to contact Mantell by radio but without success and he was still climbing. His last words to the tower were: \"I'm going to 20,000 feet.\" A few minutes later, 90 miles from the tower, Mantell's plane was seen to have \"exploded in mid-air.\" It disinte- grated before it struck ground and the answer as to what had prompted Mantell's last words \"I'm still climb- ing . . .\" despite the knowledgeable pilot's awareness that death could result, was forever sealed in his lifeless body. In Major Donald Keyhoe's book Flying Saucers From Outer Space, it was reported that the Air Force refused to release photos of the wreckage and the body \"out of re- spect for the feelings of Mantell's relatives.\" But the se- crecy surrounding the crash set off a flood of rumors that the body had been \"pierced by a mysterious ray,\" and even more sensationally that, \"no body had been found at J all. Mantell had been spirited away by unknown space- men. These rumors were quickly scotched by the ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) and its report was filed with what then was known as Project Sign and is today Project Blue Book. It reads: \"It is the ATIC opinion that Captain Mantell lost consciousness due to oxygen starva- tion, the aircraft being trimmed continued to climb until Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 zoomed, Up he 5000 feet beyond what was safe, in pursuit of an Unknown. lured this experienced pilot to what What was it that mystifying proved to be his ultimate and still death? increasing altitude caused a sufficient loss of power for it to level out. The aircraft then began a turn to the left due to torque and as the wing dropped so did the nose until the aircraft was in a tight diving spiral. The uncontrolled de- scent resulted in excessive speed causing the aircraft to dis- integrate. It is believed that Captain Mantell never re- gained consciousness. This is borne out by the fact that the canopy lock was still in place after the crash, discount- ing any, attempt to abandon the aircraft. The UFO was in no way directly responsible for this accident. However, it is probable that the excitement caused by the object was re- sponsible for this experienced pilot conducting a high al- titude flight without the necessary oxygen equipment.\" But what was the object that had generated the excite- ment? Air Force Intelligence officers first suggested Venus as the answer. One of the brightest objects in the heavens, Venus had, a few weeks before, been chased by F-51s in a sighting that had some similarities to the Mantell Incident. When it was pointed out that Venus was practically in- visible on January 7 there was a flurry of backing and fill- ing and contradiction. The controversy that swirled around the Mantell Inci- dent has been carefully -documented by the late Edward J. Ruppelt, former head of Project Blue Book, in his book The Report On Unidentified Flying Objects. It was in 1952, when he was asked to assume direction of Project ItlRDE 8k1 RRt Wp RQOOugnt0 ut 9 me2e9minent scien- tist, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, then head of the Ohio State Uni- versity Astronomy Department to ask why Venus had been promoted as the logical object that had been sighted. Hy- nek explained that at the time of the sighting, Venus and the object were in practically the same spot in the sky. This, he said, was what led to what he believed to be an erroneous conclusion. Ruppelt states: \"Dr. Hynek said that he didn't think that the UFO was Venus.\" It was Ruppelt's job, however, to establish what, if not Venus, the object was. Other suggestions had been tossed into the hopper; sundogs (diffused light reflected from ice particles); experimental balloons (Skyhooks? At that time in a highly secret test stage but known to reach altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet and diameters of 100 feet); can- opy reflections? Ruppelt dismissed sundogs since descriptions of the ob- ject had mentioned rather well defined edges. Sundogs are fuzzy. He dismissed canopy reflection because Mantell cer- tainly would not have chased a reflection for over fifteen minutes. He seriously considered the Skyhook theory. De- scriptions of the UFO could fit these experimental balloons and it was subsequently determined that on January 7, 1948, the Navy had released such a balloon from Clinton County airport in Ohio that would have been in the area of Godman at the time of the sighting. Ruppelt submitted his report to the Pentagon. \"It could have been a balloon.\" Ruppelt did not deny that the Air Force and/or the Navy might have records attesting to the launching of such a balloon from Clinton County Air ?Force Base on the day of Mantell's death. He, however, did not see those records and could find no one who would state flatly that such an operation did take place on the specific date. The incident, to him, remained another of the UFO \"jigsaw puzzles.\" Answers were based on assumption and some early explanations that had been provided by Air Force Intelligence were later discarded. The theory has been advanced that the Air Force had come to suspect that interplanetary craft were reconnoiter- ing the Earth; that the mysterious aspects of the Mantell crash had strengthened these suspicions. This theory, with any specific incidents to lend it support, might generate fear and actual panic if it were to become publicly known. Could this account for the Air Force's readiness to pro- mote first Venus as the widely seen UFO; then a Skyhook? Was there an effort to simplify and to cloud the issue until a fickle public had turned its interest elsewhere. There are serious proponents of this thesis. Most of them are familiar with the conclusions drawn by the Air Force and on record in Project Blue Book: \"that Venus was probably the original cause of the sight- ing since the object remained in the area for a long period of time and was relatively stationary.\" Most of them are equally aware of the knowledgeable determinations of ex- perts who have stated that Venus would have been a pin- point of light, difficult to see on a clear day, impossible to see on a hazy one (January 7, 1948 was hazy.) The de- scriptions provided by sighters were not of \"pinpoints.\" The Mantell Incident remains, after 20 years, one of the bafflers in the minds of serious students of aerial phenomena and is cited frequently as an example of puzzling behav- iour that might not now pose so many questions had it been treated with less secrecy at the time. 23 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RD.P81 R00560R0001 00010002-9 \"Maybe I've Seen The Devil\" ^ \"Army Intelligence never pays any attention to reports of UFO landings.\" \"Is that so?

Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, Director of the Institute of Mete- oritics at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, has known Patrolman Zamora for 15 years. His summa- tion: An honest and reliable man. That sums up the pronouncements of all who know the officer professionally and socially. What did he experience? At 6:50 p.m. on the evening of April 24, 1964, Patrol- man Zamora, who had been on duty since 2 o'clock that afternoon, was pursuing a speeding motorist along Socor- ro's South Park Street when he heard a loud roar and saw a flash of blue flame off in the southwest. There was a dynamite shack in that general neighbor- hood and the officer's first thought was that someone had been fooling around there and had set off an explosion. He headed out toward the flash which took him to a small rocky hill over which there was no road and which required three runs with the car before Zamora could breast the steep incline and start down the other side. To the south of him he could see a white object that, from the distance, 450 feet, appeared to be an overturned car with two figures moving about. Zamora could not make out the figures well; children? small adults? mechanics, possibly, since they seemed to be dressed in white cover- alls. From where he was, Zamora gathered the impression that the \"persons\" were experiencing some difficulty with their machine and had been inspecting the underpart of it, but there were too many puzzling and even startling aspects to what he saw for him to want to close in alone on the disturbing situation. He picked up his mike and called Sergeant Sam Chavez, of the State Police, advising him of the peculiar circumstances, the location, and asking him to come out alone to lend assistance. The request that Sergeant Chavez come alone gave rise later to speculation, query and puzzlement, but in view of the remarkable scene to which Zamora says he was witness there can be small wonder that he preferred the audience of a single and reliable friend to that of a large group of col- leagues who might, logically, make him an object of ridi- cule if what he were seeing was gone before confirming witnesses could arrive. The call completed, Zamora drove across to the next mesa, hearing, as he went, some loud metallic banging. By this time he was close to the edge of the gully. He stopped his car, got out and walked to the edge of the slope. His nearness appeared to startle the two \"white figures,\" who clambered into the craft and, with \"an ear splitting roar,\" took off toward the southwest with a flash of brilliant blue flame, making a piercing whining sound. Zamora, thoroughly frightened, had thrown himself to the ground, but he looked up in time to see the ascent and direction in which the object was headed. He phoned head- quarters to alert people there to watch for the brilliant phe- nomena that he believed was headed their way. Just then Sergeant Chavez arrived, took one look at Za- mora and announced: \"You look like you've seen the Devil.\" \"Maybe I have,\" Zamora replied, and briefed the trooper on what had transpired. Together they examined the gully. Clumps of range grass and one mesquite bush were burning and the officers found four wedge-shaped depressions forming a rough rec- tangle. Near one of these were four small circular indenta- tions. In answer to a call from Chavez, Captain Holder of the Army contingent at White Sands Stallion Site and an FBI agent who lived in Socorro, arrived, took measurements of the depressions, outlined and protected them with rocks, and asked Zamora for a thorough rundown on what he had witnessed. Meantime Chavez, who was supremely skeptical of all flying saucer stories, had examined Zamora's car to see if it contained any equipment with which the depressions could have been made or the fires set. He had the highest regard for Zamora's reliability and unquestioned integrity and knew him to be a sober man dedicated to his work. But he had to be certain that this was not a practical joke. He was completely convinced after this examination that with the time element involved, the lack of any evidence of a hoax and Zamora's own stunned reaction, the patrolman had experienced exactly what he claimed. Zamora supplied every detail he could recall, and there were several. His description of the object suggested a long oval from which depended the landing legs, about 21/2 feet in length. The feet of these legs were what was be- lieved to have left the four wedge shaped depressions and it was theorized that the circular depressions might have been made by a ladder which, in seeking firm footing, had been placed twice in position. There were markings on the side of the craft, an erro- neous description of which appeared in the papers. But Mr. and Mrs. Lorenzen, APRO's directors, who arrived at the scene not too many hours after it was reported, having been alerted by their on-the-spot correspondent, secured the ac- curate description from Captain Holder and it was reported by Mrs. Lorenzen in her book Flying Saucers (Signet). \"The markings were in red, consisting of a vertical line topped by two slanting lines that gave the impression of an arrow. This was surrounded by a horizontal line on the bot- tom, a vertical line on each side and a semicircle over the top of the arrow.\" The theory was advanced that this may have marked a double door. The Lorenzens interviewed Zamora that afternoon, but in his talk with them he first denied having seen any \"little men.\" Then he admitted he had seen what looked like \"small adults,\" about one-third the size of the craft. His reluctance to discuss them stemmed from Zamora's wish to cooperate with FBI men who had advised him against mentioning this aspect. He also refused to discuss continued on next page Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010002-9 Closer examination revealed unidentifiable white object and what appeared to be two \"small adults\" who, apparently startled by Zamora's appearance, took off with \"ear-splitting roar.\" the markings on the object, this under instructions from Army Intelligence. But the Lorenzens already had secured this information and did not press the already put-upon patrolman. That afternoon, as the Lorenzens were leaving town, they saw Zamora back..on his job, \"standing by the door of a car which was pulled to the curb in front of his prowl. car. He had his ticket book in hand, and his pen poised. Business as usual.\" (ARPO Bulletin, May, 1964) But business as usual was not to be the case either for Zamora or for the town of Socorro in the next several days. The account had been given international news coverage and had. attracted interest from scientists, investigators and the curious. The Air Force sent out a major from its Kirt- land Base in Albuquerque and followed this up with their consulting scientist, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, head of the Astron- omy Department at Northwestern University. To Dr. Hynek has fallen the difficult task of having to minimize the importance of certain sightings in keeping with the Air Force policy of looking upon all UFOs reports as \"errors, hallucinations or hoaxes.\"' At a closed hearing of the House Armed Services Committee, in April 1966, Dr. Hynek acknowledged that this hypothesis for the Air Force had been \"very successful,\" but it could stand in the path of research for \"if one digs too intently for coal he is apt to miss diamonds. . . . And in dealing with truly puz- zling cases, we have tended either to say that, if an investi- gation had been pursued long enough, the misidentified object would have been recognized, or that the sighting had no validity to begin with.\" (The UFO Investigator, NICAP, May-June 1966.) But at the time of the Socorro incident, \"digging for coal\" was the adopted approach and one of Dr. Hynek's first ques- tions was Why, if the UFO had been seen, had it not been reported on radar \"in an area that is infested with radar.\" The APRO investigators were the ones who pointed out that the radar station in that area was not in operation at 26 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010002-9 the time. Missions involving Holloman-White Sands had ended at 5 p.m. The long range radars at the Air Base in Al- buquerque would not have been able to pick up \"an object flying at such low altitude in that hilly area.\" (Flying Saucers, Signet) Detailed investigations continued to be carried out by the Air Force and private UFO investigating groups, at the close of which it was determined that the sighting had much to recommend it as a good one, but several factors that were puzzling. In its favor were (1) the character of the sighter him- self; reliable, honest and sincere with the expert powers of observation that endow the well-trained police officer. (2) Not`a speck of evidence that a hoax had been perpetrated. (3) A flurry of reported sightings and landings (to be touched upon later) in the New Mexico area that tended to strengthen the belief that Zamora's sighting had been a genuine UFO. Working against the premise were, (1) an analysis made by Colorado State University of soil samples taken from the area said to have been touched by the blue flame. These were compared with control samples and revealed nothing significant. (2) Zamora was the sole witness. This was no reflection upon the patrolman, but any sighting with the characteristics mentioned at Socorro profits by the support of more than one witness. (3) The publicity attached to the \"little men\" who were believed to have accompanied the object was too unrealistic for the public to accept, and tended to dissuade many that the sighting had been made. Zamora himself was reluctant to mention this aspect of the experience and would have preferred that the information he submitted to the Air Force relative to this facet had not been given attention. But he affirmed his belief that he had II' ~oy2~ 88 CIRCULAR LINES ACT INTENOEO 7b 5N0IV T.YAT D/RT IY,[S MOUNDED CA'/EF/fr ?D PIE O//TS/DE OVA' THE LFPRESSIONS 14 9Yz' seen them to APRO investigators in the presence of a local deputy and a news reporter. That there was some confusion and perhaps uncertainty among Air Force personnel as to how this latest experience should be explained was apparent in some of the theories that were offered. When there appeared to be a solid ex- planation for why the object had not been picked up on radar, a leading meteoriticist identified the craft as an ex- perimental device being developed by the Army. The Army already had said it had no craft to correspond with the one Zamora had described, and the device to which the scien- tist was said to have referred had not yet been built. While controversy was still waging over the Socorro inci- dent a young man in Espanola, N.M., came upon what he described as a bluish thing as \"long as a telephone pole,\" resting on the ground near the house. His family laughed at him when he told about it, but the man took his story to the police officers who returned with him to the scene and found the ground still smoking 20 hours after the man had seen the object. The ground was hot to the touch and the officers found several good-sized indentations plus some small, circular tracks, all of which conformed in shape to those found at Socorro, though word of the Socorro sighting with the de- tailed descriptions had not yet reached the area. Not long after this, a landing with strong similarities was reported in Montana. Some youngsters had seen a lighted object make a night landing at the rear of their home. The sheriff's office investigated the next day; found rectangular indentations and signs of scorched ground still warm. It was a reported incident of far more dramatic content that was brought to the attention of the directors of APRO continued on next page 13'222.'

She relates that through one of her news sources she learned of a pilot flying a bomber near San Antonia, N.M., on a routine mission when he sighted a UFO and advised Control of his sighting. He provided a description, egg-shaped and white, then was asked by Control if there were any markings : \"The same as the one at Socorro,\" came the pilot's response. The pilot landed a few minutes later and reported that the object was on the ground. Photo crews were ordered assembled, but at that juncture all communications (the conversation up until then had been intercepted by a ham radio operator) were cut off. Newsmen and other inter- ested parties tried to gather information from the Air Force and were told \"no such thing happened.\" There seemed evidence from the many reports that were CIA-RDP81 R00560R000100010002-9 coming in, however, that this section of New Mexico had been singled out for some attention by UFOs. One youngster was said to have been severly burned at the same time he sighted a smoking metallic object that settled above his head. The object was said to have sped away out of sight within seconds. The doctor who treated the youngster said he had suffered second degree burns and required five days of hospitalization. Although the doctor did not want to comment on the possible cause of the burns, he did say that the child had felt no pain, which seemed remarkable in view of the extensive inju"
