        "text": "ORIGIN OF PROVINCE NAME: Derived from the Cree Indian word kisiskatchewanisipi, which means \"swift-flowing river,\" and was first used to describe the Saskatchewan River.\n\nNICKNAME: Canada's Breadbasket (also: The Wheat Province).\n\nCAPITAL: Regina.\n\nENTERED CONFEDERATION: 1 September 1905.\n\nMOTTO: Multis e gentibus vires (From many peoples strength). Coat of Arms: In the center, the provincial shield of arms displays a red lion, which symbolizes loyalty to the British Crown, and (over a field of green) three gold wheat sheaves, which symbolize Saskatchewan's agriculture. Above the shield is a crest with a beaver holding a western red lily and carrying a royal crown on its back. Supporting the shield are a lion on the left and a deer on the right; both wear collars made of Prairie Indian beads. Beneath the shield the provincial motto appears on a scroll entwined with western red lilies. The red signifies the fires that once swept the prairies, green represents vegetation, and gold symbolizes ripening grain.\n\nFLAG: Horizontal bars of equal width with green above (for the northern forests) and yellow below (for the southern grain region). The provincial shield of arms appears in the upper quarter on the staff side and a western red lily lies in the half farthest from the staff.\n\nFLORAL EMBLEM: Western red lily (also known as the prairie lily).\n\nTARTAN: Saskatchewan Tartan (gold, brown, green, red, yellow, white, and black).\n\nPROVINCIAL BIRD: Prairie sharp-tailed grouse.\n\nTREE: White birch.\n\nTIME: 6 AM CST = noon GMT; 5 AM MST = noon GMT.\n\n1 LOCATION AND SIZE\n\nSaskatchewan, almost rectangular in shape, is located between the two other prairie provinces, with Manitoba to the east and Alberta to the west. The Northwest Territories are to the north, and the US states of Montana and North Dakota are to the south. Saskatchewan covers some 251,700 square miles (651,900 square kilometers). It is the only province formed entirely of man-made borders.\n\n2 TOPOGRAPHY\n\nThe northern part of Saskatchewan lies on the Canadian Shield geologic formation which stretches across much of Canada. As a result, there are numerous lakes (nearly 100,000), rivers, bogs, and rocky outcroppings. About one-eighth of the entire province is covered with water. The southern part of the province is relatively flat prairie, with occasional valleys created by erosion from the glacial era. The south is where most of the population lives. The highest point is at Cypress Hills, 4,566 feet (1,392 meters) above sea level. The province has three major river systems, which all empty into Hudson Bay: North and South Saskatchewan, Assiniboine, and Churchill. Saskatoon, the largest city, is divided by the South Saskatchewan River.\n\nAthabasca Provincial Park has sand dunes 100 feet (30 meters) high and semi-arid vegetation. Nowhere else in the world are dunes found so far north.\n\n5 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\n\nSolid waste generation amounted to 828,359 tons in 2000, or 1,788 pounds (811 kilograms) per person. Saskatchewan is actively participating in efforts to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. However, as of 2002, Saskatchewan did not support the Kyoto Protocol emissions target set by the Canadian government.\n\n6 POPULATION\n\nSaskatchewan's 2001 population of 978,933 is about 3 percent of the national population. Saskatchewan's population density is the lowest among the four provinces of western Canada. As of 2001, 29 percent of all residents were under 19 years of age. The median age increased from 32.6 years in 1991 to 36.7 years in 2001. That was still younger than the national average of 37.6 years, however. Saskatoon had 196,816 residents, while Regina had 178,225 in 2001. Other large cities and their populations include Prince Albert, 34,752; Moose Jaw, 32,631; Lloydminster, 20,988; and North Battleford, 17,117.\n\n7 ETHNIC GROUPS\n\nSaskatchewan is the only province where the number of people of British or French background is smaller than the number of people from other ethnic groups. Various European ethnic groups are found here, including British, German, Ukrainian, French, Norwegian, Polish, Dutch, Swedish, and Russian. Its Aboriginal (Native Peoples) population was 102,285 in 2001, or 10.6 percent of the total. Many other non-European peoples (Chinese, blacks, Indians and other southern Asians, and Filipinos) live in Saskatchewan as well.\n\n9 RELIGIONS\n\nMost Saskatchewaners are Christian. Close to half of the population, or 449,195 people, are Protestant. The leading Protestant denominations are represented, including United Church of Canada members, Lutherans, Anglicans, Pentecostals, Baptists, and Presbyterians. Catholics—31.7 percent of the population—number 305,390. About 1.5 percent of Saskatchewaners are Eastern Orthodox. Other faiths are also represented in smaller numbers, including Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, and Jews. About 151,455 Saskatchewaners report no religious affiliation.\n\n10 TRANSPORTATION\n\nDuring the frontier era, waterways such as the Clearwater and Churchill Rivers became established fur-trade routes, as did the overland Carlton Trail.\n\nAt 150,000 miles (250,000 kilometers), Saskatchewan today has more road surface than any other province. In 2003, registered road motor vehicles numbered 709,788. There were also 3,820 buses, 5,132 motorcycles and mopeds, and 110,843 trailers. Both Regina and Saskatoon have bus systems with more than 110 buses in each fleet.\n\nSaskatchewan currently has over 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) of railways under provincial jurisdiction. International airports are located at Regina and Saskatoon.\n\n11 HISTORY\n\nFur and Farming\n\nSaskatchewan is referred to as one of Canada's Prairie Provinces because its southern geography consists of extensive plains. The first European explorers and trappers to visit Saskatchewan found established settlements of Aboriginal, or native, peoples. The Chipewyan Indians lived in the north, the nomadic Blackfoot roamed the eastern plains, and the Assiniboine inhabited the west. The territory of the Cree, who were long-time residents of the north, also extended southward to the plains.\n\nThe earliest explorer to the region was England's Henry Kelsey of the Hudson's Bay Company. Around 1690 he followed the Saskatchewan River to the southern plains of Saskatchewan, which was especially good fur-trapping country. Fur-trading companies and trading posts soon sprang up, becoming the foundation of many present-day settlements.\n\nThreats to Natives' Way of Life\n\nFor about 200 years, the Hudson's Bay Company owned and oversaw the vast Northwest Territories, including Saskatchewan. Because these regions were perfect for farming and colonizing, the Government of Canada purchased the Territories in 1870. The passage of the Dominion Lands Act in 1872 encouraged families known as homesteaders to acquire, live on, and cultivate tracts of Saskatchewan farmland. Another act was passed to help stimulate immigration, and the establishment of a new railway began bringing waves of settlers into these rich lands.\n\nAs more and more Europeans arrived in the area, the Native people began to worry that they would be pushed out and lose control of their land, their language, and their political rights. When the Métis, people of mixed French and Indian heritage, approached the federal government with their concerns, they were told that they had no legal claim to the land. This led to a long conflict known as the North West Rebellion, during which the Métis fought hard for their native land. When it was all over, the Native peoples were forced to surrender to the Canadian government's forces. Many of the Métis ended up leaving their land and moving elsewhere.\n\nThe Québec Question\n\nCanada's unity has been threatened by the possibility of Québec's secession, or separation, from the rest of the country. Québec is a French-speaking area that places high value on the preservation of its French culture. The Meech Lake Accord (1987) and the Charlottetown Accord (1992) both proposed the recognition of Québec as a \"distinct society\" within the nation. The Canadian government had hoped that these accords would alleviate Québec's fears of cultural loss and discrimination while maintaining a unified Canada, but Québec's separation issue remains unresolved.\n\nEarly 21st Century\n\nIn the early 2000s, Saskatchewan was taking steps to improve its educational system. It was also looking to improve health care, create jobs, and grow the economy. Also, steps were taken to promote a \"green\" Saskatchewan: breakthroughs in renewable energy sources, environmental technology, and energy conservation were geared to support an economy growing in harmony with the natural environment.\n\n12 PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT\n\nThe structure of the provincial government reflects that of the federal government. For example, the provincial premier, as the majority party leader of the legislature, functions much like the Canadian prime minister. Provincial legislators, like their federal counterparts in Parliament, are elected to represent a constitutional jurisdiction and pass legislation. They do so as members of the 58-seat Legislative Assembly. A provincial lieutenant-governor approves laws passed by the legislature, much like the Governor General at the federal level. There is no provincial equivalent, however, to the federal Senate.\n\n15 JUDICIAL SYSTEM\n\nThe Canadian Constitution grants provincial jurisdiction over the administration of justice, and allows each province to organize its own court system and police forces. The federal government has exclusive domain over cases involving trade and commerce, banking, bankruptcy, and criminal law. The Federal Court of Canada has both trial and appellate divisions for federal cases. The nine-judge Supreme Court of Canada is an appellate court that determines the constitutionality of both federal and provincial statutes. The Tax Court of Canada hears appeals of taxpayers against assessments by Revenue Canada.\n\nThe provincial court system consists of the Provincial Court, which hears criminal and civil cases, small claims, family and youth proceedings, and traffic violations; the Court of Queen's Bench, which hears serious civil and criminal cases, and some family law matters, including divorce; and the Court of Appeal, Saskatchewan's highest court, which hears certain appeals from the Provincial Court and the Court of Queen's Bench.\n\nIn 2002, there were 27 homicides in Saskatchewan. That year, there were 1,812 violent crimes per 100,000 persons, and 5,678 property crimes per 100,000 persons.\n\n16 MIGRATION\n\nThe Métis, people of mixed European and Aboriginal descent, were among the first settlers, many of them having migrated from Manitoba.\n\nA major wave of immigration began in 1899 and continued until 1929. By the early 1920s, over 20 percent of all Canadians lived in the Prairie provinces (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta), up from just 8 percent in 1911.\n\nIn 2001, 17.7 percent of the 47,825 immigrants living in Saskatchewan had come from the United Kingdom, and 12.3 percent came from the United States. About 13.8 percent came from Northern and Western European countries other than the United Kingdom (mostly from Germany). Some 13.6 percent came from Eastern Europe (mostly from Poland). About 9.6 percent came from Southeast Asia (mostly from the Philippines), and 8.7 percent from East Asia (mostly from China).\n\nIn 2001, 1 percent of Saskatchewan's residents age 5 and older were living abroad. Some 11.5 percent were living elsewhere in Saskatchewan, while 4.7 percent were living in another province. Alberta is the leading province of origin for incoming internal migration and the leading province of destination for outward internal migration.\n\n23 FISHING\n\nAlthough commercial fishing is not a large contributor to the provincial economy, sport fishing on Saskatchewan's 94,000 lakes is very popular. Sport fishing is important to many local economies, especially in the northern parts of Saskatchewan. In 2000, the province had 130,076 residents actively engaged in sport fishing within Saskatchewan. Popular game fish for sport anglers include walleye, perch, trout, Arctic grayling, goldeye, burbot, whitefish, and sturgeon.\n\n26 ENERGY AND POWER\n\nSaskatchewan is Canada's second-highest oil-producing and third-highest natural gas-producing province. The province has Canada's largest reserves of heavy oil, in addition to light and medium crude deposits. Saskatchewan's 14,000 oil wells produce about 20 percent of Canada's annual oil output. Of Saskatchewan's total exported crude oil, some 65 percent goes to the United States. Crude oil from both Saskatchewan and Alberta is transported to market via the Interprovincial Pipe Line (IPL). The IPL originates in Edmonton and passes through Saskatchewan on its way to eastern Canada and the United States. In 2002, 1.4 million was invested in oil and gas exploration and development. The energy sector provides around 22,000 direct and indirect jobs in the province.\n\nSaskPower is Saskatchewan's major electricity supplier. As of 2003, 78 percent of Saskatchewan's energy needs were met by thermal sources, 21 percent by hydroelectricity, and 1 percent by other sources. The province is a net importer of electricity.\n\n30 HEALTH\n\nIn 2001, there were 12,275 live births in Saskatchewan, a 1.1 percent increase over 2000. Saskatchewan was one of only four provinces or territories that had an increase in the number of live births in 2001. There were 8,740 deaths that year, a 2.4 percent decrease from 2000. Life expectancy for men in 2001 was 76.4 years, and 82.3 years for women. Reported cases of selected diseases in 2002 included gonococcal infections, 560; giardiasis, 168; salmonellosis, 161; hepatitis B, 43; and campylobacteriosis, 254. Between November 1985 and June 2003, 407 residents had become infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nSaskatchewan has over 130 hospitals and health centers. The Regina General Hospital is the largest health care facility in southern Saskatchewan.\n\n32 EDUCATION\n\nIn 2000, Saskatchewan had 208,483 students enrolled in elementary and secondary schools. That year, there were 11,473 teachers, for a student-teacher ratio of 16 to 1.\n\nThere are two major universities in the province: the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, with an enrollment of 15,368 full-time students in October 2002; and the University of Regina, with about 12,000 full-and part-time students. The First Nations University of Canada (formerly the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College) is affiliated with the University of Regina. It is the first university-level institution in North America operated by and for Native North Americans. Enrollment at First Nations University of Canada has grown from 9 students in 1976 to about 1,200 in 2003–04.\n\n34 LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS\n\nThe largest public libraries are Regina Public Library, with nine branches, and the Saskatoon Public Library, with seven branches. Seven regional systems—Chinook, Lakeland, Palliser, Parkland, Southeast, Wapiti, and Wheatland—provide public library services to other parts of the province. Regina has the Plains Historical Museum, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Centennial Museum, the\n\nSaskatchewan Museum of Natural History, and the Saskatchewan Science Centre. Saskatoon is the home of the Western Development Museum and the Ukrainian Museum of Canada. The Right Honourable Diefenbacker Canada Centre in Saskatoon maintains the collection of papers, letters, and memorabilia of the late prime minister John G. Diefenbacker.\n\n35 COMMUNICATIONS\n\nAs of 2002, Saskatchewan had 28 AM and FM radio stations, and 50 television stations. The Regina metropolitan area has 7 local AM and 9 FM radio stations (including CBC French) and 4 broadcast television stations; Cable Regina offers Canadian and American cable stations.\n\n38 SPORTS\n\nProfessional sports teams in Saskatchewan include the Saskatoon Blades and the Regina Pats of the Western Major Hockey League. Saskatoon also was home of the Saskatchewan Storm of the World Basketball League until the league disbanded in 1992. Regina hosts the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). The Roughriders are the oldest professional football team in North America and were the CFL champions in 1966 and 1989. The University of Saskatchewan Huskie football team won the national championship in 1990. Popular recreational sports include baseball, football, soccer, and curling (a game imported from Scotland in which large rounded stones with attached handles are slid down an ice-covered playing area toward a circular target).\n\n39 FAMOUS SASKATCHEWANERS\n\nAlmighty Voice (1874–97) was a famous hero/outlaw and martyr who led a Cree Indian band resisting European settlement on the Saskatchewan prairie. T. C. \"Tommy\" Douglas (1904–86) was a famous political figure who led the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) to victory in the 1940s, thus establishing the first socialist government in North America. Gerhard Herzberg (1904–99), recipient of the 1971 Nobel Prize in chemistry, was a professor at the University of Saskatchewan from 1935 to 1945.\n\nNoted Saskatchewaners in entertainment include emcee and producer Art Linkletter (b.1912) and actor Leslie Nielsen (b.1926), and singer and song-writer Buffy Sainte-Marie (b.1941). Folk singer and songwriter Joni Mitchell (b.1943) grew up in Saskatoon. Distinguished Saskatchewan authors include novelists W. O. Mitchell (1914–98), Rudy Wiebe (b.1934), L. R. Wright (1939–2001), and short story writer Guy Vanderhaeghe (b.1951).\n\nHockey legends from Saskatchewan include Eddie Shore (1902–85), Emile Francis (b.1926), Gordon \"Gordie\" Howe (b.1928), Glenn \"Chico\" Resch (b.1948), and Bryan Trottier (b.1956). Sandra Schmirler (1963–2000) led the curling team that won the first-ever Olympic gold medal in women's curling at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan."
