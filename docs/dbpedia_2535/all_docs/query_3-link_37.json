In the first place, the shield of 1998 shows a white fimbriation which is missing from the Schedule, and the height of the flower has increased from 60% of flag width (as defined by the Act) to 80%.\n\n(*) The shield was given by Warrant of H.M. King Edward VII dated 35 August 1906 (Gazetted 13 October 1906) and augmented of crest, supporters and motto by a Royal Warrant of Her Majesty signed by the Governor General on 16 September 1986 (Gazetted 4 October 1986).\n\nChristopher Southworth, 26 January 2005\n\nDesigner of the flag\n\nReported in the Regina Leader-Post, 11 May 2016, by Will Chabun:\n\nhttp://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/the-weird-and-wonderful-story-of-saskatchewans-provincial-flag\n\nThe weird and wonderful story of Saskatchewan's provincial flag\n\nAnthony Drake chuckles as he remembers his \"lucky 13.\" Through the winter of 1968-69, he worked away with coloured paper, green and yellow. Yellow for Saskatchewan's wheat fields; green for the northern forests - the western red lily and the provincial crest. Thirteen designs he sent to the Government of Saskatchewan, which had announced in 1968 it was holding a competition for a provincial flag.\n\nDrake was a Saskatchewanian by choice, at least for a while. When he was a boy, his family had emigrated from postwar Britain to Preston, Ont., now part of Cambridge. But he was homesick and, after high school, went back to the U.K. There, he entered teachers college and had married when he noticed an advertisement: Saskatchewan needed teachers and would even pay their way to Canada - and provide a house. Thus did the couple come to Ponteix for a year until, as Drake - lively and fun at 75 - puts it, his wife was \"head-hunted\" by the school in Hodgeville, southeast of Swift Current. There was also a position for him and enough time to do things like design flags.\n\nBy no means was he the only designer. Contemporary news accounts say over 4,000 designs were sent to Regina before one morning in the spring of 1969, when the young Yorkshireman was having his morning coffee break as a phone call arrived. It was CKSW Radio in Swift Current. It wanted an interview with the designer of the province's new flag - Anthony Drake. No hoax! \"I didn't think Canadians hoaxed,\" he says. \"It took quite a long time for it to register - and then it all came out and I was very pleased.\"\n\nAnd here's where this story takes one of those peculiar Saskatchewan-style twists. Drake had never seen the flag flying in Saskatchewan - until Tuesday night, when he and his wife Joan arrived in Regina after 16 hours flying from United Kingdom. In the spring of 1969, Joan became pregnant with their first child and they reasoned they'd be better off back in Britain, with two sets of grandparents to help. He found a teaching job in the U.K. - and that's where the family was when Saskatchewan officially unveiled his flag and ran it up a flagpole in the autumn of 1969. Since then, the Drakes had no reason to visit Saskatchewan, and he was \"totally unaware\" the flag was on flagpoles, mugs, baseballs, watches, cellphone cases, lapel pins, T-shirts, belt buckles and what looks, on the web, like a bikini.\n\nEnter Gail Hapanowicz. She and husband Mirek moved from Calgary to Hodgeville, bought the town's former school and renovated it into a hotel, the Hodgeville Inn. She wanted to give it a gimmick, a personality, so she started researching it - and learned it was the place in which Drake had worked while he designed Saskatchewan's flag. Finding Drake was challenging, as he had no online presence. But she found a teacher who knew him and had his address plus his phone number. The Drakes accepted her invitation to return to Saskatchewan. Based in The Hodgeville Inn, they'll tour the province over the next three weeks and meet folks like the lieutenant governor.\n\nRob Raeside, 14 May 2016\n\nLieutenant Governor\n\nimage located by Valentin Poposki, 1 June 2012\n\nSource: http://ltgov.sk.ca/protocol-matters/lieutenant-governors-standard\n\nFrom the Lt. Governor of Saskatchewan web site:\n\nSymbols\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor, as representative of the Queen, receives the marks of respect reserved for Heads of State. At official ceremonies such as the Opening of the Legislature, the Lieutenant Governor is entitled to a 100-person military guard of honour, a 15-gun artillery salute, and a musical royal salute (the vice-regal salute).\n\nStandard\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor has a personal flag called the vice-regal standard, flown on his car and on the provincial landau (used on major ceremonial occasions). It may also be flown on a building where the Lieutenant Governor is present. It consists of the provincial shield of arms surmounted by the Crown and surrounded by a wreath of ten maple leaves, on a royal blue background. The vice regal standard is not used within a building for any occasion.\n\nCoat of Arms\n\nA Coat of Arms is granted to the Lieutenant Governor by the Canadian Crown as a permanent mark of identity in honour of service to the Crown. The individual Coat of Arms is created by the Canadian Heraldic Authority at Rideau Hall featuring the prominent areas of interest as advised by the Lieutenant Governor.\n\nresearched by Jarig Bakker, 14 December 1999\n\nI think that if a connection with Scotland had been intended the lion would be rampant, as well as red. Like Nova Scotia? Perhaps it was thought that, a yellow and green shield, with red and yellow charges, looked better than, a red and green shield, with just yellow charges.\n\nDavid Prothero, 9 May 1999\n\nSee also:"
