JORDAN DOELL Son Of Art Biography amazing feeling to be in this place whee ‘This is Who I am and What I do’. Writing, singing and performing my own songs is a dream realized, music is at the centre of my focus and passion.”\n\nIn a family of six children, there was one musical passion gene and it went straight from father to his son Jordan. Performing from the age of seven as a country and gospel soloist, Jordan later moved into rock n’ roll and gained extensive experience as he toured throughout Western Canada playing the club circuit. The training of gospel proved an asset and in the mid 90’s Jordan’s powerful voice and energetic stage presence contributed to the success of popular local band, Slot 9. The band received airplay on Vancouver’s 99.3 The Fox with a tune called “Green Face Out”.\n\nThe last six years have seen Jordan rediscover his roots in country music and embrace its melodies and stories with newfound passion. “It’s the story lines that appeal to me the most” say’s Jordan, “They all have such great tales to tell”. Once rediscovering his musical passion, there was no looking back. Jordan received a grant from Factor Canada, which helped him to complete a four song, self-titled demo CD featuring ‘Hey Jones’ and ‘She Treats Me Bad’. Both songs have received airplay in Sweden on MCWC radio and in the Netherlands on BRTO Radio and Rucphen FM.\n\nTwo major influences have helped shape Jordan’s style. The first is his experience with gospel music, introduced to him as a child by his dad. The gospel background helped hone and train his vocal skills while laying the groundwork for a professional caliber career. His second great influence is country icon George Jones.\n\nJordan has traveled to Nashville, TN and performed in some of the most famous honkytonks such as Tootsies Orchid Lounge, and The Bluebird Café. As well as his regular Lower Mainland circuit, performances include the Merrit Mountain Music Festival, Wine for the Cure 2005 & 2006 and several showcases with the BC Songwriters Association.\n\nRecently, Jordan played along side the CCMA Awards in St. John, New Brunswick, and can be found entertaining crowds around the Western Canadian Coast. Locally he performs frequently at Gabby’s Cabaret, McBurnies Coffee House, and The Roxy, as well as Citta Pub and Bistro in Whistler’s Center Square.\n\ncopyright? ByC.J.Friesen\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nJohnny Cash was a poor sharecropper’s son from Arkansas who later sang to millions. Known as the Man in Black, he died of complications from diabetes in Nashville, Tennessee on Sept. 12, 2003, aged 71.\n\nKingsland, Arkansas\n\nDied September 12, 2003\n\nNashville, Tennessee\n\nOccupation Singer, guitarist and songwriter\n\nWebsite http://www.johnnycash.com/\n\nWhen Johnny Cash was recording and releasing his remarkable American Recordings albums on a fairly regular basis, I came to look forward to that new music. Now that he’s gone, that feeling of anticipation is also gone. Unlike many musical artists, Cash has never lost his hold on the imagination of listeners worldwide. Few singer-songwriters in country and popular music have had the lasting impact of the Man in Black.\n\nAnd now Cash fans have something to look forward to. It’s not cheap, but I can’t think of a better birthday or Christmas present for a true Johnny Cash aficionado than this set. Its title is The Complete Columbia Album Collection. In October, Sony and Columbia Legacy will release the huge boxed set of all of his albums from the Columbia Records label, his musical home from 1958 to 1986 when he was unceremoniously dumped from his contract because he was no longer cranking out hit songs.\n\nHow many artists are worthy of and still commercially viable enough to support a 63-CD boxed set?\n\nThe retail price for the set is $329.99, with some online sites offering advance orders for about $265. The official release date is Oct. 30. It includes 59 albums and two bonus compilations, all on 63 CDs. Many of the albums have never been released on CD. Just reading some of the album titles evoke fond memories: Blood, Sweat and Tears, Man in Black, Ragged Old Flag, I Walk the Line, Johnny 99, and Ride This Train. There are eight live albums, including the iconic Folsom Prison and San Quentin sessions, and live recordings made in Sweden, England and Czechoslovakia.\n\nAs you probably know, Cash was first signed to Sam Phillips’ Sun Records in Memphis in 1955. His first Sun recordings were all singles (although some packagers have since bundled them as albums). Such songs as “Hey Porter” sounded basic and almost primitive, but were also aimed squarely at the basic country music audience that identified closely with his basic sound and his messages of home, family, faith, hard times and good times. A simpler life.\n\nBack to Johnny Cash history: The then little-celebrated Johnny Cash was lured away from Memphis and Sun Records to Nashville and the then-stellar Columbia Records label in 1958 and launched his career there with the single “What Do I Care.” Singles ruled country music then and Cash’s first Columbia single charted at No. 7 on the Billboard country singles chart. His second release, “Don’t Take Your Guns to Town,” became his first No. 1 hit.\n\nNow, all that’s left for Cash music lovers is to await future boxed sets of all of his Sun recordings, his Mercury recordings and his American Recordings work. Giants once walked the earth. Johnny Cash was one of them.Terri Clark/Medicine Hat\n\nClark-receives-more-Canadian-honors Clark’s family settled in Medicine Hat, Alberta, where she was raised.

With a fresh, engaging sound that combines the best of contemporary country with compelling faith-based lyrics, High Valley is truly the best of both musical worlds.\n\n“We always describe ourselves as Dierks Bentley as a trio. It’s that new country kind of vibe,” says Brad Rempel, who along with his brothers Bryan and Curtis comprises High Valley “It’s not as pop as some contemporary country. Our music is a little more organic, a little more acoustic. We grew up singing harmony as a family and in church. There was always harmony and acoustic instruments, so our live show features a mandolin, an acoustic guitar, a bass guitar and three part harmony.”\n\nThe Canadian trio has opened shows for Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, LeAnn Rimes and Reba McEntire, earning a solid reputation as a must-see live act. High Valley’s last album, “Broken Borders,” was named Album of the Year at the 2007 GMA Canada Covenant Awards in the country category while their hit “Back to You” was honored as Country Song of the Year. High Valley has also been among the nominees for Group of the Year at the Nashville-based Inspirational Country Music Awards.Picture at Granum Festival,2009\n\nRichard Kalan Porter (born 11 November 1985) is a singer from Medicine Hat, Alberta, who was\n\nthe second winner of the reality television series Canadian Idol. Beating out 8,977 other contestants, Porter was crowned “Idol” on 16 September 2004 in front of a live TV audience. Idol judge Zack Werner nicknamed Porter “The Little Prince” due to his resemblance to a character in Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s children’s book of the same name.\n\nKalan’s first single “Awake in a Dream” was released on 5 October 2004. “Awake in a Dream” has become the best selling debut single for a Canadian artist to date.\n\nKalan’s debut album 219 Days, released 23 November 2004, reached number four on the Canadian charts in its first week. The album title, 219 Days, refers to the number of days from his first audition to the release of his debut CD.\n\nKalan’s fanbase is generally known as the “Kalanadians” (presumably a play on Claynadians, a name for Clay Aiken’s fans).\n\nKalan completed a cross-Canada, 65-date tour in 2005. Most of these shows were sold out.\n\nKalans second album is scheduled for release in The Spring of 2006.\n\nHall Of Fame\n\nArt Wallman\n\nInducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 2003\n\nBirth: Kelvington, Saskatchewan, July 12, 1928\n\nArt Wallman had one of the longest and most successful careers in Canadian radio. He was on air for more than 36 years at CKSW in Swift Current, where he was recognized with numerous awards and achievements, which is made all the more impressive given that he was unable to walk as a child and was unable to read until the age of 20.\n\nWallman was born with spastic paralysis, which left him unable to walk. Since his family lived in extreme poverty due to the Great Depression, he did not receive any treatment until the age of 9, when he began the first of 14 operations to straighten his legs and arms, finally leaving him able to walk but only with the use of crutches.\n\nWallman was first exposed to country music as a child, where he grew up listening to radio at home, following along to songs on his brother’s guitar. Wallman first auditioned for radio in the 1950s but his disability proved to be a factor; no one was willing to take a chance on him, but he didn’t give up his dream. On October 18, 1960 he was finally hired by Wilf Gilby at CKSW, told that it didn’t matter if he couldn’t walk, he just needed to do the job. And do it he did, remaining there until he retired in 1996.\n\nHis afternoon show became known for its call ins from listeners and interviews by artists travelling through Saskatchewan. He was awarded the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 1989; was a member of the C.A.B’s Quarter Century Club and an Honourary Life Member of the W.A.B.\n\nChannel 5\n\n1957CFB-TV was the third television station to be established in Saskatchewan and signed on the air December 23rd 1957 at 6 p.m. The opening of the station was viewed as a Christmas present for the people of Swift Current and Southwest Saskatchewan. The studio and transmitter were built on land overlooking the city (about two and a half miles north of town) and with its 360-foot tower, it became known as Television Hill. Operating power was 9,000 watts video ERP and 4,500 watts audio ERP. CJFB-TV, a CBC supplementary affiliate, was on the air daily from 4:00 p.m. to midnight in its earliest days. The station claimed to be Canada’s first television station to use automated programming. When the station was launched, it was built using state of the art equipment and with a series of transmitters located across the Southwest, CJFB-TV brought television for the first time in history to viewers in Swift Current, as well as to communities in Shaunavon, Eastend, Maple Creek, Val Marie, Pontiex, Riverhurst and Elrose.\n\nBill Forst\n\nCJFB-TV was a unique station in Saskatchewan and its original founders, Bill and Julie Forst, combined to manage the broadcast outlet from beginning to end. Bill Forst was also a quarter owner of CKSW-AM in Swift Current. Innovative and independent, the Forst family in Swift Current maintained and operated Channel 5 for a total of 45 years.\n\n1964\n\nA rebroadcast transmitter was added at Riverhurst on October 14.\n\n1965\n\nBy this time, CJFB-TV had an effective radiated power of 13,300 watts video and 6,650 watts audio and operated rebroadcast transmitters at East End (CJFB-TV-1), Val Marie (CJFB-TV-2) and Riverhurst (CJFB-TV-3). William D. Forst was president of Swift Current Telecasting Co. Ltd.\n\n1970s\n\nCJFB-TV had a long and distinct history in the community. With the leadership and foresight of its original owners, the station pioneered a number of achievements, which were adopted not only by television broadcasters in the province, but also by networks across the country.The station was the first in Canada to broadcast its own satellite weather information, through the use of antennae-tracking and facsimile equipment that was built and assembled at the station. This type of weather broadcasting was the forerunner in Canada and allowed viewers to gain important information of changing weather patterns and pending prairie storms.The station is also credited with the creation of the Kinsmen Telethon in the province, an event that has grown to become a provincially televised fundraiser called Telemiracle. This unique broadcast is recognized nationally for the tens of millions of dollars that it has raised for local individuals with disabilities in Saskatchewan.\n\n1970\n\nSlogan: CJFB-TV – a crossroads to the West.\n\n1973\n\nBy this time, CFJB-TV had the following rebroadcast transmitters: CFJB-TV-1 Eastend, CFJB-TV-2 Val Marie and CFJB-TV-3 Riverhurst.\n\n1977\n\nCJFB-TV purchased studio and portable equipment to improve local programming. The CBC was planning new facilities at Shaunavon to replace the existing CJFB-TV rebroadcaster there.\n\n1979\n\nCJFB had plans to upgrade its rebroadcast transmitters at Eastend and Val Marie.\n\n1984\n\nOn January 11, the CRTC renewed CJFB-TV’s licence until September 30, 1985.\n\n1986\n\nCJFB-TV became the only independently owned television station in Saskatchewan when Baton Broadcasting Inc. of Toronto acquired television stations in Regina, Yorkton and Prince Albert. The company already owned CFQC-TV in Saskatoon.\n\n1995\n\nOn January 23, the CRTC approved the application to amend the licence for CFJB-TV by adding to the licence the following condition of licence: In addition to the 12 minutes of advertising material permitted by subsection 11(1) of the Television Broadcasting Regulations, 1987, the licensee may broadcast more than 12 minutes of advertising material in any clock hour in a broadcast day, in order to broadcast infomercials as defined in Public Notice CRTC 1994-139 and in accordance with the criteria contained in that public notice, as amended.\n\n2002\n\nCJFB-TV raising the original transmitter to the top of the 360′ tower overlooking Swift Current. (from Fall, 1957)\n\nCJFB-TV raising the original transmitter to the top of the 360′ tower overlooking Swift Current. (from Fall, 1957)\n\nThroughout its history, the television station was a vehicle for aspiring broadcasters. The training they received at CJFB TV was the beginning of numerous careers, but it was the efforts of long term employees who kept the station active and visible in the community. These included sales manager Walter Buffam, chief engineer Gary Shepherd, news anchor Gord Foth and producer Wade Bergstrom.CJFB TV closed its local studios on May 31, 2002 and the station’s transmitters, towers and land were sold to CBC television. It operates today as a broadcast repeater. Network programming originates from its facilities in Toronto. News and Public affairs are provided through studios in Regina. The transmitter and towers remain on the original site in Swift Current.CJFB TV held an open house before its closing and invited viewers to tour the facilities for a final time and reminisce about the past. As with their official launch in 1957, people came from across Southwest Saskatchewan. The era of local television was now at an end, but remarkably, the gift that had been presented to the community in 1957 had managed to last for almost half a century.\n\nAs is customary the CRTC revoked the licence for Swift Current Telecasting’s CJFB-TV on May 31, including CJFB-TV-1 Eastend, CJFB-TV-3 Riverhurst and CJFB-TV-2 Val Marie and licences was issued to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to operate transmitters of CBKT Regina at Swift Current (Channel 5 with effective radiated power of 13,300 watts) and Riverhurst (Channel 10, ERP of 390 watts). The Val Marie and Eastend transmitters would not be recquired by the CBC.\n\nCJFB-TV Swift Current became CBKT-4 while CJFB-TV-3 Riverhurst became CBKT-5.\n\nWritten by Bill Dulmage with input from Lee Friesen (July, 2006) and source information of Swift Current Telecasting’s Julie Forst – Updated March, 2011\n\nCherny\n\nAl (Alexander Peter) Cherny (b Chernywech). Fiddler, b Medicine Hat, Alta, of Ukrainian parents, 1 Nov 1932, d Missisauga, Ont, 23 Aug 1989. As a youth he studied violin with Frank Nowak and in his teens he played country music on CHAT radio, Medicine Hat. In 1951 he joined Vic Siebert and his Sons of the Saddle, a cowboy music group in Calgary, and 1952-9 he was a featured performer on ‘CKNX Barn Dance’ from CKNX radio, Wingham, Ont. At the Canadian Open Old Time Fiddlers’ Contest he won the novelty class in 1959, 1960 and 1961, and the open class in 1960 and 1961. Cherny was a regular performer on CBC TV, first 1963-5 on ‘Country Hoedown’ and thereafter (until his death) on ‘The Tommy Hunter Show’. He also appeared with Hunter on CBC radio’s ‘Country Holiday’ and on CBC-sponsored tours during the 1960s of Europe and the Middle and Far East.\n\nConsidered one of Canada’s finest professional fiddlers of his day, Cherny had become a leading studio musician by the early 1970s, recording as a sideman with Gary Buck, Dick Damron, Hunter, Sylvia Tyson, Jesse Winchester, and others. Under his own name, Cherny had one LP released by Arc, nine (including reissues and collections) by RCA, and two (drawn from RCA material, including Golden Ukrainian Melodies) by Tee Vee Records. He recorded several of his own fiddle tunes (published by Dunbar Music). Cherny received a Big Country Award as top country instrumentalist in 1978 and was inducted posthumously into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 1989.\n\nGlen Edwards\n\nGlen Edwards (March 5, 1918–June 5, 1948) was a test pilot for the U.S. Air Force, and is the namesake of Edwards Air Force Base.\n\nHe was born in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada where he lived until 1931, when his parents moved the family to Lincoln, California. He maintained dual U.S.-Canadian citizenship throughout his life.\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in chemical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, Edwards enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces on July 15, 1941. After completing his flight training, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant at Luke Field, Arizona, in February 1942. Assigned to the 86th Light Bombardment Squadron of the 47th Bombardment Group, he departed for the North African theater of operations (Tunisia) as a flight commander in October 1942. There he led his flight of A-20s on extremely hazardous, low-level missions German tanks, convoys, troop concentrations, bridges, airfields and a variety of other tactical targets\n\nThe Beau Marks\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThe Beau Marks were a Canadian rock music group formed in 1958 in Montreal, Quebec. Their first release, the April 1959 single “Rockin’ Blues” b/w “Midnight Party”, came out under the name The Del-Tones, but the group changed their name soon afterward in a nod to the Bomarc missile. Their breakthrough hit was “Clap Your Hands”, which hit #1 in Canada and Australia,[1] and peaked at #45 on the US Billboard pop charts[2] and #15 on Cashbox.[3] The tune was also released in French as “Frappe Tes Mains”. Their debut, ten-track full-length came out in 1960; they appeared on American Bandstand and at a charity concert at Carnegie Hall soon afterwards. Two more albums followed before the group broke up in 1963; a 1968 reunion saw “Clap Your Hands” get a re-release.\n\nMembers\n\nRay Hutchinson – guitar\n\nMike Robitaille – guitar\n\nJoey Frechette – piano\n\nGilles Tailleur – drum\n\nReferences I worked with Joey at CHOO radio"
