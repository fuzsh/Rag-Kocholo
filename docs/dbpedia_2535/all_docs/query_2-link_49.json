        "text": "8 FAM 403.4\n\nPlace of Birth\n\n(CT:CITZ-85; 11-09-2022)\n\n(Office of Origin: CA/PPT/S/A)\n\n8 FAM 403.4-1 Introduction\n\n(CT:CITZ-41; 10-29-2020)\n\na. The Department’s policy on Place of Birth (POB) designations for U.S. passports, forms FS-240, “Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States of America,” and forms DS-2026, “Consular Report of the Death of an American Citizen Abroad,” is consistent with its recognition policy. The Department’s policy on POB is also generally consistent with current sovereignty policy. This means that U.S. passports, forms FS-240, and forms DS-2026 will list the POB as it was designated at the time of issuance:\n\n(1) U.S. passports, forms FS-240, and forms DS-2026 remain valid even if the POB designation has changed. A subsequent change in the POB designation does not warrant rewriting a U.S. passport or amending a form FS-240 or form DS-2026. Applicants who want a U.S. passport, form DS-240, or form DS-2026 with the new POB designation must apply for a new passport or official copy of the form FS-240 or DS-2026, and pay all applicable fees; and\n\n(2) Except as provided in 8 FAM 403.4-4(A), U.S. passports, forms FS-240, and forms FS-2026 must not be issued in a previous POB designation. Applicants who object to the current POB designation may choose the city of birth designation (see 8 FAM 403.4-5), if available.\n\nb. This subchapter provides guidance on designating the POB. Passport specialists and consular officers (hereinafter referred to as “you” unless otherwise specified) must determine the proper POB in accordance with this subchapter. You may not deviate from this subchapter without specific written authorization from the Department.\n\nc. Unless this subchapter specifies otherwise, an applicant born outside the United States who objects to the Department’s country listing of the POB may be offered the city of birth only option.\n\nd. Consular officers must advise the Bureau of Consular Affairs when place name changes occur. New guidance on POBs based on a change of the legal status or name of the location must be authorized by the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) with coordination from the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues, Geographic Information Unit, in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR/GGI), the Office of the Legal Adviser (L/CA, L/DL and the regional L office), and the regional bureau.\n\n8 FAM 403.4-2 BIRTH IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n(CT:CITZ-73; 06-09-2022\n\na. You must use the POB as provided in 8 FAM 403.4-7(A) for persons born in the United States, which is defined in INA 101(a)(38) as the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. You must use the POB as provided in 8 FAM 403.4-7(B) for persons born in the United States' outlying territories and possessions.\n\nb. The passport application instructs the applicant to provide both the city and the state of birth. However, it is not necessary to annotate the city of birth if the applicant only provided the state.\n\nc. You must ensure the correct place of birth is listed in TDIS or ACS+.\n\n8 FAM 403.4-3 birth Outside the United StateS\n\n(CT:CITZ-73; 06-09-2022)\n\na. You must use the POB as provided in 8 FAM 403.4-7(C) for persons born outside the United States.\n\nb. You must ensure the correct place of birth is listed in TDIS or ACS+.\n\nc. For forms FS-240, both the city and country of birth must be listed.\n\n8 FAM 403.4-4 Unusual Circumstances Regarding POB\n\n8 FAM 403.4-4(A) Israel, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, Jerusalem, and the West Bank\n\n(CT:CITZ-73; 06-09-2022)\n\na. Golan Heights: Per Presidential Proclamation on March 25, 2019, U.S. policy recognizes the Golan Heights as part of Israel. The POB for applicants born in the Golan Heights is ISRAEL.\n\nb. U.S. policy recognizes that Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip are territories whose final status must be determined by negotiations. As stated in the President's December 6, 2017 Jerusalem Proclamation, the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and its seat of government but continues to take no position on the boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem. The final boundaries of sovereignty in Jerusalem remain subject to final status negotiation between the two Parties.\n\nc. West Bank (including the No Man’s Lands between the West Bank and Israel):\n\n(1) The POB for persons born in the West Bank is WEST BANK; or\n\n(2) Persons born before May 14, 1948 in the West Bank may have PALESTINE listed as the POB (if requested).\n\nd. Gaza Strip:\n\n(1) The POB for persons born in the Gaza Strip is GAZA STRIP.\n\n(2) Persons born before May 14, 1948 in the Gaza Strip may have PALESTINE listed as the POB (if requested).\n\ne. Jerusalem:\n\n(1) Unless born before May 14, 1948 in locations outside Jerusalem's municipal limits at that time (see below), the POB for U.S. passports for persons born in Jerusalem should be:\n\n(a) If the applicant lists solely “Jerusalem” as the place of birth (POB) the POB must be JERUSALEM on the U.S. passport, Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA), or Consular Report of Death Abroad (CRDA);\n\n(b) If the applicant lists “Israel,” the POB must be ISRAEL on the U.S. passport or “JERUSALEM, ISRAEL” on the CRBA/CRDA; or\n\n(c) If the applicant lists “Jerusalem, Israel” you must contact the applicant to ascertain whether the applicant prefers either solely JERUSALEM or ISRAEL (on the U.S. passport) and/or whether the applicant prefers solely JERUSALEM or JERUSALEM, ISRAEL (on the CRBA/CRDA).\n\n(2) Persons born before May 14, 1948 within the municipal borders of Jerusalem at that time may elect either JERUSALEM or ISRAEL as described above in paragraph e(1);\n\n(3) The POB for persons born before May 14, 1948 in locations outside Jerusalem’s municipal limits at that time, that are now inside Jerusalem’s declared municipal limits, is listed as PALESTINE or the name of the location (area/city) as it was known prior to expansion of Jerusalem’s municipal limits at any time following May 14, 1948. Persons born in such locations after May 14, 1948, may choose the name of the location (area/city) as it was known prior to the expansion of Jerusalem’s municipal limits; and\n\n(4) Do not list Jordan or the West Bank for persons born within the current municipal borders of Jerusalem.\n\nf. Israel: List ISRAEL as the place of birth in the passport if and only if the applicant was born in Israel, or if requested consistent with the Jerusalem-specific guidance above. Do not list Israel for persons born in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, or the No Man’s Land between the West Bank and Israel.\n\ng. POB in area formerly known as Palestine: Persons born in the area formerly known as Palestine (which includes the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, or the West Bank) may object to listing their POB as something other than Palestine. In such cases, you should explain CA’s policy of listing the birthplace as the country having present sovereignty and that U.S. policy recognizes that the final status of the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, and the West Bank must be determined by negotiations. Applicants may be offered alternate entry place of birth consistent with more specific guidance in this section and in 8 FAM 403.4-5.\n\n8 FAM 403.4-4(B) Birth at Sea or In the Air\n\n(CT:CITZ-1; 06-27-2018)\n\na. Birth at sea or in the air is applicable when no country has current sovereignty over the area.\n\nb. Birth at sea: If birth or citizenship documents, such as the ship's log or a statement from the captain, show the POB at sea, annotate that the applicant was born at sea on the application and as the POB in the passport with the appropriate POB code:\n\nc. Birth in the air: If birth or citizenship documents, such as the flight log or a statement from the pilot, show POB in the air, annotate that the applicant was born in the air on the application and as the POB in the passport with the appropriate POB code:\n\n8 FAM 403.4-4(C) Disputed Territory\n\n(CT:CITZ-85; 11-09-2022)\n\na. Disputed territory is territory that is claimed by one or more countries and for which the United States does not take a position on sovereignty.\n\nb. The Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) is a disputed territory claimed by both the United Kingdom as a British Overseas Territory and by Argentina. TDIS and ACS provide birthplace codes for the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) (see 8 FAM 403.4-7(C)).\n\n8 FAM 403.4-4(D) Taiwan\n\n(CT:CITZ-73; 06-09-2022)\n\na. The United States recognizes the government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of China. Taiwan can be used as POB in the passport pursuant to the guidance below.\n\nb. If an applicant born in Taiwan writes “China” as their POB on a passport application, you must list CHINA.\n\nc. If an applicant born in Taiwan writes “Taiwan” as their POB on a passport application, you must list TAIWAN. If there is any inconsistency regarding the POB, e.g., the applicant's permanent resident card lists China as the POB, you must request the applicant's birth certificate to verify that the applicant’s city of birth is on one of the following islands: the island of Taiwan (formerly called Formosa), Penghu Dao (formerly called Pescadores), Kinmen Islands (Quemoy), or Nangan Dao (Matsu).\n\nd. If an applicant born in Taiwan writes “Taiwan, China” as their POB on a passport application, you must contact the applicant to ascertain whether they prefer either TAIWAN or CHINA as their POB (Information Request Letter 707-06).\n\ne. A passport applicant whose previous U.S. passport(s) listed TAIWAN as the POB may request that their new passport be issued listing CHINA as the POB. However, a passport applicant whose previous U.S. passport(s) listed CHINA as the POB may not request that their new passport be issued listing TAIWAN as the POB without evidence that the previous POB was assigned erroneously.\n\nf. Passports may not be issued showing the POB as “Taiwan, China,” “Taiwan, Republic of China,” or “Taiwan, ROC.”\n\n8 FAM 403.4-4(E) Special Administrative Region\n\n(CT:CITZ-73; 06-09-2022)\n\na. A Special Administrative Region (SAR) is a region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy.\n\nb. The People’s Republic of China exercises sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau, but Hong Kong and Macau are able to exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. CHINA and the city of birth option are not available. If an applicant born in Hong Kong or Macau presents a passport listing either CHINA or the city of birth, you must:\n\n(1) Request appropriate evidence of the POB (e.g., the applicant's birth certificate); or\n\n(2) Verify the information in consular records (e.g., previous passport applications, visa records, etc.--see 7 FAM 1348); and\n\n(3) List HONG KONG SAR or MACAU SAR, respectively, in the passport.\n\nc. Effective July 1, 1997, Hong Kong became a SAR of the People’s Republic of China. The place of birth for Hong Kong, regardless of the date the birth occurred, must be HONG KONG SAR.\n\nd. Effective December 20, 1999, Macau became a SAR of the People's Republic of China. The place of birth for Macau, regardless of the date the birth occurred, must be MACAU SAR.\n\n8 FAM 403.4-5 City of Birth Listing\n\n(CT:CITZ-73; 06-09-2022)\n\na. U.S. citizens born abroad may choose to list the city or town of birth if they object to the Department’s designation of the POB, and an individual who is notified of the policy may also elect the city of birth option unless this subchapter specifies otherwise. There is no requirement that the applicant document the reason for the objection, if any.\n\nb. The city of birth only option is not available for persons born in the United States or its territories or outlying possessions.\n\nc. The applicant must be advised of the possible difficulties in traveling to or obtaining visas for entry to foreign countries with only a city of birth shown on the passport (Information Notice IN-941-21).\n\nd. Many foreign city names, particularly those that use non-Latin alphabets, may have multiple possible spellings or transliterations. For example, Kyiv, Ukraine, may be spelled Kiev or Kyyiv (among others). You must determine the appropriate spelling of the city or area of birth using the United States Board on Geographic Names' Geographic Names Server (GNS) developed and maintained by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. If you cannot establish an appropriate name or spelling, contact AskPPTAdjudication@state.gov.\n\n(1) You may use the “custom search criteria” to filter the results so only “approved” or “conventional” names are returned;\n\n(2) You may select the “country name” to filter the results so only cities in the correct country are returned. This also reduces the likelihood that the database will time out;\n\n(3) Under the “feature designations” option, you may select “populated place”, or the various options for administrative division seats or capitals filter results so only cities are returned. If the applicant was born in an unincorporated area, you may select “administrative regions” so only area names are returned;\n\n(4) GeoNames search results:\n\n(a) The first (leftmost) column, “Name,” provides the spelling with “(Approved)”or “(Conventional)” if it is an acceptable spelling for the place name;\n\n(b) The second column, “Geopolitical Entity Name,” provides the country or geographic entity in which the city of birth is located. You can use this column to verify that you have selected the correct city, e.g., Neapoli, Greece or Neopolis, Brazil;\n\n(c) The sixth column, “Feature Designation,” provides geographic information about the place. You can use this column to verify that you have filtered the results appropriately; and\n\n(d) You must determine, in consultation with your supervisor and/or the applicant, if necessary, which place name is most appropriate (generally the city).\n\ne. Write out the city or town name as retrieved from the GNS in the POB field, as there are no standard codes for city birthplaces. Also, write “XXX” as the place of birth code:\n\nf. If an applicant later requests a new passport showing the country of birth, the applicant must pay the fees for the new passport.\n\n8 FAM 403.4-6 requests for no place of birth or a different place of birth\n\n8 FAM 403.4-6(A) Requests for No Place of Birth\n\n(CT:CITZ-28; 11-06-2019)\n\nAn applicant requesting that no POB be listed on a passport must be advised either at the public counter or via appropriate information notice that the United States will not issue a U.S. passport with no POB listing. The POB designation is an integral part of establishing an individual’s identity. It distinguishes that individual from other persons with similar names and/or dates of birth, and helps identify claimants attempting to use another person’s identity. The information also facilitates retrieval of passport records to assist the Department in determining citizenship or notifying next of kin or other person designated by the individual to be notified in case of an emergency. Inquirers may further be advised that:\n\n(1) A passport, as defined by section 101(a)(30) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, is “any travel document issued by competent authority showing the bearer's origin, identity, and nationality if any, which is valid for the entry of the bearer into a foreign country”;\n\n(2) For U.S. passport purposes, the Department of State has defined the term “bearer's origin” to be the bearer's POB. That entry is included to assist in identifying the individual, not the individual’s nationality. The passport very clearly states that the bearer is a non-citizen U.S. national or a U.S. citizen;\n\n(3) Inclusion of the place of birth entry in the passport is consistent with the 1980 report of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which recommended a standardized passport including the place of birth entry as an essential element;\n\n(4) Deletion of the place of birth entry from the U.S. passport has been discussed extensively among U.S. Government agencies and with Congress:\n\n(a) In 1986, Congress directed the Comptroller General to complete a study on the issue;\n\n(b) The August 1987 General Accounting Office (GAO) report (GAO 87-201) on this issue discusses two separate studies conducted by the Department of State, one in 1977 and another in 1986, to determine how the removal of the POB would affect travel by U.S. citizens;\n\n(c) Those studies concluded that elimination of the POB from the U.S. passport would cause considerable inconvenience to the entire traveling population, since a number of countries would still require POB information. Travelers would have to provide POB documentation, either when applying for a visa or when entering the country, or run the risk of being denied entry to those countries;\n\n(d) The report also confirmed that U.S. law enforcement agencies could not agree to its removal from the U.S. passport because it is a vital data element used in anti-terrorist, anti-drug, and anti-fraud programs; and\n\n(e) The GAO report reinforced previous conclusions that removal of the POB would lead to serious problems for the U.S. Government and for the majority of traveling U.S. citizens.\n\n8 FAM 403.4-6(B) Requests for a Different Place of Birth for U.S. Citizens Born Abroad\n\n(CT:CITZ-73; 06-09-2022)\n\na. A U.S. citizen born abroad may request a different POB than the POB listed on their birth evidence or other documents. You must determine whether the applicant has established the POB by a preponderance of the evidence; i.e., whether it is more likely than not that the applicant was born in the claimed location.\n\nb. If the applicant cannot obtain acceptable birth evidence from the jurisdiction where the birth purportedly occurred, the applicant must submit additional acceptable supporting evidence created near the time of birth that shows the requested POB (e.g., pre- and post-natal records, a hospital birth certificate, a baptismal certificate, etc.):\n\n(1) A Certificate of Naturalization cannot be used to change the POB. The Certificate of Naturalization does not list the applicant’s POB as such: it lists the applicant’s country of former nationality at the time of naturalization, which is usually, but not always, the same as the POB. If the applicant requests a POB that is inconsistent with the country of former nationality, you must request a foreign birth certificate showing the applicant's POB unless you are able to verify the POB in a consular system (see 8 FAM 801.1). For example, if the applicant submits a Certificate of Naturalization showing “BOLIVIA” as the country of former nationality, but requests “THAILAND” as the POB, you must request a foreign birth certificate if you are unable to verify the POB in a consular system.\n\n(2) The applicant's POB generally (see paragraph d below) must be consistent with documents issued by USCIS, such as a Permanent Resident Card or Certificate of Citizenship. If the applicant claims that the POB listed on the USCIS-issued document is incorrect, the passport cannot be issued in the requested POB unless the applicant submits a corrected USCIS issued document or an order from a Federal court changing the applicant's POB.\n\nc. If the applicant cannot, or does not wish to, provide acceptable supporting evidence of the requested POB, you must issue the passport with the POB listed on the USCIS-issued document if there is one (unless the POB is inconsistent with U.S. sovereign recognition policy as articulated in this FAM section – see paragraph d below) or, if not, with the POB that is supported by the preponderance of what evidence has already been presented.\n\nd. Nothing in this section should be interpreted to suggest that the Department of State may list a POB on a Department-issued citizenship document that is inconsistent with the Department’s position and corresponding FAM guidance on the current sovereignty of a geographic area. POB designations on Department-issued citizenship documents should always reflect the sovereign recognition policy of the United States as articulated by Department of State and reflected in FAM guidance, even if the applicant presents a Certificate of Citizenship or other non-Department of State citizenship document listing a different POB. For example, if an applicant’s birth documentation shows birth in Jerusalem after May 14, 1948, but submits a USCIS Certificate of Citizenship stating “Israel” as the country of birth, the Department must issue a citizenship document listing only “Jerusalem” as POB, or as otherwise specified in 8 FAM 403.4-4(A), consistent with this FAM section. Should questions arise on the designation of a POB not addressed in this section, please contact AskPPTAdjudication@state.gov.\n\n8 FAM 403.4-7 POB TableS\n\n(CT:CITZ-28; 11-06-2019)\n\na. The CCD converts the information from the ACS system code for POB to the TDIS system code for POB. While the POB codes for the two systems may differ from one another, passports issued by both systems reflect the same place of birth name.\n\nb. In accordance with 8 FAM 403.4-1, the tables in the following sub-sections are consistent with the Department's recognition policy and generally consistent with current sovereignty. These tables generally reflect the Bureau of Intelligence and Research's Independent States of the World and Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty tables.\n\nc. Places outside the United States and its outlying territories or possessions where few, if any, U.S. citizens/non-citizen U.S. nationals are known to have been born may not be included in the following tables. If a U.S. citizen/non-citizen U.S. national is born in a location not listed in the tables below, you must contact AskPPTAdjudication@state.gov for further guidance.\n\n8 FAM 403.4-7(A) POB Table: United States\n\n(CT:CITZ-84; 10-14-2022)\n\n8 FAM 403.4-7(B) POB Table: Outlying Territories and Possessions of the United States\n\n(CT:CITZ-28; 11-06-2019)\n\n8 FAM 403.4-7(C) Outside the United States\n\n(CT:CITZ-85; 11-09-2022)\n\nThe CCD converts the information from the ACS system code for POB to the TDIS system code for POB. While the POB codes for the two systems may differ from one another, passports issued by both systems reflect the same place of birth name.\n\n8 FAM 403.4-7(D) POB Table: Other Names of Locations\n\n(CT:CITZ-85; 11-09-2022)\n\na. Other names of locations are provided below for reference purposes only to assist you in finding the correct name when presented with a birth record reflecting the previous place name or a location with potential for confusion.\n\nb. When there are multiple, possible current names for a country, you must determine the exact location of the applicant’s POB, and thus which country is recognized/has current sovereignty.\n\nc. The chart below is not exhaustive.\n\nFormer/Unrecognized Name\n\nCurrent Name(s)\n\nNotes\n\nAbkhazia\n\nGEORGIA\n\nThe self-styled “Republic of Abkhazia” declared its independence from Georgia on July 23, 1992, but the United States considers Abkhazia to be an integral part of Georgia, not an independent state.\n\nAdmiralty Islands\n\nPAPUA NEW GUINEA\n\nFollowing Papuan independence on September 16, 1975, sovereignty was transferred from Australia to Papua New Guinea.\n\nAkrotiri\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\n\nUnited Kingdom sovereign base area on the island of Cyprus.\n\nAscension Island\n\nSAINT HELENA\n\nBritish Overseas Territory\n\nAscension Island has been a dependency of Saint Helena since September 12, 1922.\n\nAustral Islands\n\nFRENCH POLYNESIA\n\nAzores\n\nPORTUGAL\n\nBaja California\n\nMEXICO\n\nDo not confuse with CALIFORNIA, U.S.A.\n\nBalearic Islands\n\nSPAIN\n\nBali\n\nINDONESIA\n\nBechuanaland\n\nBOTSWANA\n\nFormerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name upon independence in 1966.\n\nBessarabia\n\nMOLDOVA, UKRAINE\n\nNot all of Bessarabia is in present-day Moldova.

The city or town name to be designated will be the name at the date of the passport applicant’s birth, or the current name. The appropriate transliteration of the city or town name will be established by the Office of the Geographer of the U.S. Department of State.\n\nPassport applicants who opt for the city or town of birth designation should be aware that they may encounter difficulties in traveling to, or in obtaining visas for entry into, certain foreign countries. A foreign country’s embassy or consulate may refuse to issue a visa that is required to enter that country and the applicant will effectively be barred from traveling to that country. An applicant who, having been denied a visa, requests a replacement passport with the country listed as the place of birth designation will be charged the normal issuance fee for the replacement passport.\n\nPassport applicants should also be aware that although a visa may not be required to enter a particular country, the traveler must often show a passport at the port of entry. Entry may be denied by border officials based on the city or town listed as the place of birth in the passport. The U.S. Department of State will not be in a position to facilitate entry in such cases. The only service U.S. embassies or consulates can provide will be issuance of a replacement passport with the country listed as the place of birth. The traveler will be charged the normal issuance fee for the replacement passport."
