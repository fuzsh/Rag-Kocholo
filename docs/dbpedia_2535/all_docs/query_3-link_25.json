        "text": "T-Mobile, already using Syclo’s Mobile Work Manager, adds SMART Schedule automation tool to improve operating efficiencies\n\nMarch 28, 2007 — Syclo, a leading developer of mobile computing solutions, today announced that T-Mobile has selected Syclo’s SMART Schedule product for operations in Germany. T-Mobile Deutschland started the overall operation in 1993 as an independent trading company. Today, the company is one of the most successful mobile phone operators in Europe. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile International AG & Co. KG and with 31.4 million customers at the end of December 2006, the market leader in Germany.\n\nThe addition of the SMART Schedule product follows the rollout of Syclo Mobile Work Manager almost two years earlier. The SMART Schedule product from Syclo is built in conjunction with ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. (NasdaqCM: CKSW), the leading provider of mobile workforce management and service optimization solutions.\n\nSyclo partner Ascom, an international solution provider with comprehensive technological know-how, will lead the initial installation of the Syclo mobile products and work closely with Syclo to deploy the SMART Schedule product in early 2007.\n\nSMART Schedule assists organizations who service and maintain physical assets, such as equipment, plant floor, facilities and fleets, in scheduling the best person to perform the most critical work on time. Solving this resource management issue enables significant improvements in worker productivity, customer satisfaction and asset reliability. Through preconfigured scheduling rules and business objectives, SMART Schedule provides planners and schedulers with a powerful tool for planning work, dispatching assignments and managing conflicts.\n\nHaving successfully rolled out the Mobile Work Manager for T-Mobile field workers serving and maintaining cell towers throughout Germany, Ascom Key Account Manager Domenico Carapezza stayed close to the T-Mobile team and learned of its desire to optimize key elements of the technician scheduling. “T-Mobile wanted a scheduling tool that could go to work for them essentially right out of the box and that was preintegrated into their EAM system. We called Syclo, and within a week we demonstrated the product in the T-Mobile offices,” Carapezza said.\n\n“We have worked with Ascom on a number of joint customer success stories. Ascom stays very close to their customers, working as a team to meet their operating goals and helping organizations like T-Mobile establish best practices that control costs, extend asset life and are future-protected as new devices, communications and applications emerge,” said Marc Chesover, Syclo’s EMEA general manager.\n\nSyclo mobile software solutions are deployed at over 700 organizations worldwide across a wide variety of industries. Like all SMART products built on the Agentry™ platform, SMART Schedule allows its customers to easily configure their application to meet their needs today and in the future. SMART Schedule, combined with other Syclo mobile products, enables organizations to work in and out of wireless coverage and mix and match devices to meet their needs while supporting the latest in peripherals such as RFID, GPS, GPS and remote printing.\n\nAbout Syclo\n\nSyclo is a leading developer of mobile solutions that streamline workflow, maximize productivity and drive more value from enterprise systems. Building on its flagship development platform Agentry, Syclo offers fully configurable, rapidly deployed mobile applications that run on a variety of devices and support real-time wireless and offline computing.
