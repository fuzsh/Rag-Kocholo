THE CHRONICLE 2 THE FINANCIAL SITUATION. The order, issued by the head of an outside organ­ ization, for a strike on next M onday by the operators of the Western Union Telegraph Company, is the immediate occasion for taking up the impending movement for Governmental control of wire service. The controversy came into the light of publicity some weeks ago, ostensibly starting over the action of the company in discharging some em­ ployees who, in the company’s view, had violated their working agreement by joining a union that employs the strike as a weapon. At about the same time, the company submitted to its employees, at the reported request of some oith em , a tentative plan for organizing its employees into an association of their own, to be officered and controlled by them­ selves and not by any outsiders. Inevitably, this was denounced (most loftily by the outsiders) as an attempt to interfere with individual liberty, but the question whether the company had a business and moral right to depart from the strict “ open shop” so far as to decide that it has found a necessity of making non-union a condition of employment is not one to be decided offhand and on impulse. The company says this has been for ten years its known policy; that persons who accepted its service were properly understood to know it and to have accepted it; that there has been and is no dispute between it and its employees; and that the union which is mak­ ing the disturbance is an outside one “ carrying on a propaganda to induce our employees to become members.” Apropos of this, some readers have probably not forgotten the traction trouble here, a year or two ago, which came from the determined attempt of an outside union to bring into member­ ship and control the traction line employees; then, as apparently now also, the disturbing cause was outside interference and no other. Writing to President Wilson, the head of the Western Union urges that “ the quality of telegraph service depends absolutely on the spirit of individual employees.” There is no timetable, he adds, by which the in­ dividual patron can test the expedition of handling his message, nor can even the management deter­ mine certainly whether small delays or inaccuracies are warranted by circumstances and human imper­ fections; therefore it is “ essential that every em­ ployee sustain an attitude of loyalty to the manage­ ment and of desire to co-operate with the others.” On the broad ground of liberty, it is self-evident that employer and employee are competent and should be allowed to make any terms on which they can agree. Admitting, if one pleases, that this is subject to some qualifications which need not be discussed now, the question whether the company has a right, in its own and the public interest, to say that no employee can be a member of an outside organization is not one to be decided negatively as coercive; it depends on what reasons exist for such a rule. As for the natural assertion, from the out­ sider, that the company offered a union of its own and sought to compel membership therein, no evi­ dence of attempt or desire for compulsion has ap­ peared; the terms of the tentative plan suggested are fair, resembling in spirit the recent movement in the Standard Oil Company for an inside organiza­ tion, and were offered without any hint of pressure. “ It is not a fight,” said the head of the company, ‘but an effort, to^give our people what they want [Von. 107. and what they have not had, a voice against petty tyranny and the opportunity for collective bar­ gaining.” Whatever may have been the power of employers over employees and of capital over labor in the past, in the situation of to-day the power to coerce the employee is gone, even if a desire remained; and if the employer and employee cannot get to­ gether and agree there is little good to be expected from an outside intervention. The probabilities are that the telegraph companies and their force would get on amicably if let alone. But the outside influences, now more than ever before, are not willing to let them do so. Replying to President Wilson, the head of the company says there has been no refusal to accept the award of the War Labor Board, for there has been no award, but only a ruling that the ban on the outside union be withdrawn and the discharged persons reinstated, leaving the outside disturber to continue a propa­ ganda which is regarded as certainly disturbing and destructive. Therefore the company maintains its position, and on the whole seems to be clearly right. Then came the strike order from the head of the outside union, who declares that it “ will be justified to the boys at the front” because “ it is the last resort to preserve our organization from annihila­ tion” and is necessary because of the Western Union’s “ continued determination to destroy our organization.” A similar declaration was made by the outsider in the traction lines trouble, and both agree with the proposition that a nation-wide union must be dominant or it cannot exist. Whether the strike order would be obeyed by Western Union employees nobody can say, but the situation offers the occasion (which is promptly seized) for bringing forward a resolution authorizing the immediate taking over of telegraphs and telephones. Behind it is clearly the same influence which has long been urging Governmental operation and ownership of both; the same hand is observable which seems to have been behind the recent strange incident of the vetoing of an appropriation bill in order to continue a determined opposition to the pneumatic tubes for mails-carrying within several of the largest cities. As submitted, the resolution named no date for re­ turning the property to the owners, and whether the attempt to amend by naming such a date will succeed is yet to be fought out. One wrong step leads to another and another. A drifting policy, taking the line of apparent least resistance, prefer­ ring what is easiest to-day and leaving to-morrow to take care of itself, is a step downward; each one pre­ pares for the next and makes that harder to resist. We all know this is true of individual conduct, and it is equally true of the collective conduct of a peo­ ple. Persistent mis-handling of transportation led to a situation, precipitated and emphasized by a war which nobody had thought of, and then the plunge to Governmental taking-over was made, although even then that could have been avoided. This emboldened organized labor still further, and naturally led to efforts to create a colorable pretext for seizing other public utilities. In case of the railroads, a date for returning to the right path is set, but that binds nobody and con­ cludes nothing; it is a resolution for smoothing over scruples, and can be altered or rescinded at any time. One end of a wedge is always thin; it enters and drives the easier thereby. Whether a date of return is attaehedjto the taking of the telegraph and tele- July 6 1918.] THE CHRONICLE phone may not be of importance, except that the lack of it will indicate another step already made towards reconcilement to the idea of socializing everything under cover and pretext of a war emer­ gency. The results of these bold advances may decide the question of return and of its date; now, everything is involved in clouds of uncertainty before us. We have not yet begun to learn those results, and we seem about to rush into a further step before the terms of the first are adjusted, in each case labor showing a potent influence immediately. Yet ex­ perience with Governmental expansions and inter­ ventions may perhaps convince a hitherto apathetic public. Bank clearings returns for June and for the first half of the year 1918 simply continue to reflect the business activity in this country that has resulted from the tremendous conflict in Europe now approach­ ing the end of its fourth year. But, in the huge totals of bank exchanges, high prices for almost every article, whether of major or minor importance in trade, have played no unimportant part. In some lines of industry it is to be said, of course, that there has been relatively less activity than a year ago, but easing up in production has been more than compensated for by greater financial returns. As a single example take cotton goods; our own returns, confirmed by those of the Census Bureau, show a moderately smaller consumption of the raw material than last year, and, consequently, a reduced output of finished products, but against this place the 14c. per yard now quoted for printing cloths as contrasted with 73^c. at this time in 1917 (a rise of 86 2-3% ), and it becomes clear how increased value has much more than offset decreased production and infcrentially stimulated bank clearings. It is to be noted that the latest exhibit of bank clearings exceeds that of all preceding months of 1918 except M ay, notwithstanding that a fewer number of business days were included in June than in all months but February, and the favorable show­ ing at New York is not to be credited to activity on the Stock Exchange. On the contrary, the volume of share sales for the month was much less than a year ago and even a little below that of 1916. More­ over, at other centres of speculation, the result was much the same. Time was when stock speculation and other financial transactions played an important part in the making of bank clearings, but that has not been so recently. In reality speculation as a dominant factor in these compilations has been superseded by trade and industrial activity, assisted by high prices, and this statement finds confirmation in the many very heavy gains shown in localities where stock or commodity exchanges are an un­ known quantity. For example, there are no less than 39 cities in our current compilation which for the half-year of 1918 exhibit increases of 30% or over as contrasted with the like period of 1917, and at only two or three of them is there any such or­ ganization as a stock exchange. Furthermore, 14 cities show for June the largest monthly totals in their history and the same is true of upward of 140 cities for the six months. The aggregate of clearings for the month in 1918 at 175 cities is 827,321,612,665, an augmentation of 2.2% over June of 1917 and of 32.3% over 1916, while for the first half of the current calendar year 3 there ar creases of 4.6% and 30.9% , respectively. At Ne ork the decline for the month reaches 7.7% as contrasted with last year, and there is an improvement of 18.4% compared with two years ago, with the six months’ aggregate exhibiting a loss of 3.6% and a gain of 17.3% , respectively. Outside of this city the June total is 17.2% heavier than that of last year and 54.0% above 1916, and for the six months there are increases of 16.2% and 51.7% . As regards the individual cities, it is to be stated that for the first half of 1918 all but 38 record increases over 1917 and conspicuously large gains are not un­ common. Among those showing augmentation in excess of 25% we note Baltimore, Cincinnati, Evans­ ville, Lexington, Jacksonville (111.), Owensboro, Seattle, Portland (Ore.), Spokane, Tacoma, Sacra­ mento, Bakersfield, Long Beach, Kansas City (M o.), Omaha, Denver, Sioux City, Wichita, Topeka, Sioux Falls, Fremont, Aberdeen, Lawrence, New Orleans, Richmond, Atlanta, Nashville, Norfolk, Chattanooga, Augusta, Little Rock, Oklahoma City, Macon, Columbia, Wilmington (N . C .), Columbus (G a.), Vicksburg, Tulsa, Muskogee, Meridian, Dallas, Newport News, Montgomery, Texarkana, Raleigh and Shreveport. Analyzed by groups, the six months’ totals are in all cases much heavier than a year ago. The Middle Division, exclusive of New York, exhibits an increase of 10.8%; New England, 19.5%; the Middle West, 4.7% ; the Pacific Slope, 18.1%; the “ Other Western,” 32.9% , and the South, 31.4% . Finally the second quarter of the year makes a better showing than the first three months, and, moreover, its total is the high record for any quarter in our history by some 74 million dollars, that being the gain over the fourth quarter of 1917. Stock transactions at the New York Exchange in June were of considerably smaller volume than in M ay, very much less than in June 1917 and below the totals for the like period of either 1916 or 1915. The dealings totaled 11,772,261 shares, against 19,092,653 shares last year, while for the six months the sales were only 73,769,440 shares, against 101,­ 891,387 shares a year earlier, and 85,055,650 shares in 1916. Bonds, on the other hand, were much more actively dealt in than in June of 1917, but the augmentation was due entirely to the heavy trans­ actions in Liberty Loan issues— railroad and indus­ trial securities and foreign also being comparatively neglected. The turnover of Liberty bonds alone was no less than 9 9 ^ million dollars out of a total of all kinds of 138 millions. For the six months the transactions in all classes of bonds, due to the large sales of Liberty bonds, were well above last year, reaching 742 million dollars par value, against 508 millions. At Boston the dealings in stocks were also much smaller than in 1917, covering for the month 296,311 shares, against 459,907 shares, and for the six months 1,796,920 shares, against 3,272,­ 446 shares. Canadian bank clearings in June were moderately above those for the period a year ago with all the places but eight contributing to the gain. The increase in the aggregate for the 25 cities reporting comparative figures is 5.8% over last year, while contrasted with 1916 the augmentation reaches 29.2% . For the six months since Jan. 1 the total exceeds that of 1917 by 3.1%, with Vancouver, Victoria, Edmonton, Halifax, Fort William and New Westminster leading in percentages of increase. 4 THE CHRONICLE [Vol. 107.

The British hospital ship Llando­ very Castle, bound from a Canadian port for Eng­ land, was sunk without warning early this week by a German submarine at about 70 miles from the Itish coast. Allied air machines are raiding German towns, attacking railway stations and military estab­ lishments. The Air Ministry at London announces that these raids will be continued. An official state­ ment declares that on the night of June 30-July 1, further attacks were made on the enemy airdrome at Doulay and on railroad works and stations at Thionville, Rcmilly, Landau, Zwiebrucken and Saarsbrucken. The chemical works at Mannheim have again been attacked. On July 1 the railway and workshops at Karthaus, the station at Preves, and the railway triangle at Metz Sablons were bombed with good effect. There is a widespread exodus from Rhine towns and house rents have depreciated, it is stated, 35% . The death of the Sultan of Turkey is announced. Rumors have reached London that the Turkish ruler was killed by revolutionists who are opposing the continuance of the war. It is possible that the incident may have an important bearing on the entire situation. In London the financial markets remain steady, but very quiet, awaiting, as one cable correspondent putsit, “ a renewal of the Hun offensive.” The Italian victories and the serious economic conditions in Austria-Hungary which have been accentuated by these victories, appear to have produced a feeling of underlying confidence. Nevertheless, there is not unnaturally a degree of anxiety when the extent of the] gains achieved by the enemy in his previous drives before they could be completely checked, is taken into consideration. Austria’s distress at home isjalso emphasized by the cable correspondents as an important factor in the financial situation. “ Finan­ cial, London,” to quote one correspondent, “ prefers to take the cautious view even of the Italian develop­ ments, first, because of the possibility of German reinforcements and reorganization; and, second, because all news regarding Austrian or German in­ ternal economic and political conditions is dis­ trusted.” As yet no indication appears of a determination of the Chancellor to abandon the present plan of con­ tinuous sale of war bonds for a more definite and immediate issue of a specific amount. A gradual decrease is evident in the weekly sales, last week’s total subscriptions, for instance, being £17,496,000, which compares with £22,427,000 for the week pre­ ceding. The aggregate of sales to June 29 is £817, 552,000 through the banks. The post offices for the week ending June 22, reported sales of bonds amount­ ing to £590,000, bringing the total up to £21,579,000. The previous week’s record was £601,000. It is obvious that unless the daily sales can be stimulated some new form of borrowing will soon be necessary. The national revenue return for the quarter ending June 30 suggests the same idea. It registers expendi­ tures of £728,978,000— an increase of £57,689,000, compared with the corresponding period last year. The total includes the expenditures for war pur­ chases £634,903,000, which is an increase of £23,­ 906,000 and in war debt interest of £87,731,000. This represents an increase of £33,891,000. The revenue for the quarter amounted to £155,753,000 (an increase of £39,794,000), which includes the in­ come tax of £27,237,000 (an increase of £3,283,000) [Vol. 107. and the proceeds of the excess profits tax of £62,­ 965,000 (an increase of £21,869,000). The expendi­ ture exceeds the revenue by £573,222,000, which, of course, had to be met by borrowing. There is very little in the way of corporate or other private financing in London at the present time, British financial machinery being entirely given up to the Government’s war requirements. Capital applications for the quarter ending with June, ac­ cording to the usual compilation of the London “ Economist” (as reported by cable), amounted to £222,921,000. Of this amount no less than £218,­ 278,000 represented Government borrowing. The capital issues for the preceding quarter were £475,­ 259,000, and for the second quarter of last year they were £221,254,300. The idea of an after-war boycott of Germany still continues to bristle out in English trade circles. It is more than likely, however, that the entire matter will be arranged fully in the terms of peace when that stage of negotiation finally arrives; and the various meetings and resolutions which are becoming of such frequent occurrence may, therefore, be considered more in the light of a register of trade sentiment and desire rdther than possessing any actual value of a practical character. At a general meeting of the members of the Liverpool Cotton Exchange on Tues­ day it was resolved unanimously “ that no member or members of a firm shall trade either directly or indirectly with the present enemies of Great Britain for a period of ten years after the war.” On the same day, at a meeting of the Board of Control and W ool Advisory Committee, Sir Arthur Goldfinsh, British Director of War Materials, spoke on the desirability of keeping wool prices within the British Empire at a moderate level. He said that so long as the present very high prices are paid in America it will not be possible to reduce the price of wool for civilian use in England. Sir Arthur said an approxi­ mation between American and British prices must take place sooner or later, and he hoped it would take the form of reductions in America. In his opinion a steady reduction in America would create a healthier position and would permit of a common level being established in both countries next year on a basis rather lower than the present Bradford range of prices. Bonar Law, Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced in the House of Commons early in the week that important decisions had been reached by the Imperial War Conference regarding the best methods of obtaining the command of essential war materials produced within the British Empire with a view of safeguarding the interests of the Empire and the Allies during the period of re­ construction. The speaker did not announce the substance of the decisions. There appears a possibility that the shortage of harvest hands may reduce the wheat prospects of England below the recent very favorable promises. Walter F. Roch, member of Parliament for Pem­ brokeshire, in moving the adjournment of the House of Commons on Monday night, drew attention to the serious effect of combing out for the army the agricultural laborers at harvest time. He said that he had been inundated with letters from farmers bewailing the probable disastrous effects of the Gov­ ernment’s action and threatening to turn the cattle into the harvest fields unless they got the needed July 6 1918.] THE CHRONICLE labor. Several of the members •criticised the Gov­ ernment for sending men to the front after onlythree months training. A. Bonar Law, speaking for the Government, said that the Government recognized that the men and boys wci e handicapped by having to fight with such short training, but that Great Britain throughout the war had been handi­ capped by having to create an army from its founda­ tion. Thirty thousand men representing that vital force necessary to supply three or four fighting divisions were wanted. The difficulties of securing man power were becoming greater every month. It was impossible to decide such difficulties by dis­ cussion in the House of Commons which must give the Government “ a blank check.” The Roch motion was defeated. 7 tion, which is now being restricted by increased costs. One of the difficulties is that the high cost of materials is adverse to the exchanges which are based on the gold supply. At the meeting of the Central Mining Corporation held in London last Thursday, Lionel Phillips of the Wernher Beit in­ terests, and identified for many years with the W itwatersrand gold industry in the Transvaal, said that the question of checking the diminution of the gold output of the British Empire could scarcely be further postponed without serious consequences. The Transvaal output, he said, for the first five months of 1918 had fallen £1,250,000 compared with the same period of 1917. Large quantities of ore, he urged, do not yield the same product. The speaker added that if South African mines were not allowed to sell gold at whatever price they chose, other The British Treasury statement for the week methods should be devised to prevent further dimi­ ending June 29, made a rather poor showing, there nution of production. having been a substantial increase in expenses, and only a small gain in revenue.

Banking appears to be more expensive in Germany than in Austria. Of its gross takings the Creditanstalt required 40% and the Deutsche Bank 53% for administrative ex­ penses. The percentage is a little higher for some of the other Vienna banks than the Creditanstalt, but it exceeds the percentage for the Berlin insti­ tution. On the other hand, the Austrian banks are burdened to a greater extent by taxes and dues. No less than 22% of the Creditanstalt’s gross profits was paid out in taxation, whereas the Deutsche Bank paid out 6.3 % . A bill for a fresh war credit of 15,000,000,000 marks to be covered by loans has been introduced in the German Reichstag. All the stock exchanges in Germany are abstaining from business until the question of the contemplated new duties against which they have protested to the Government has been settled. The Government proposed to increase the stamp duty on the Boerse transactions from 30 pfg. to 2 m. with an additional war duty of 2 m. on every 1,000 m. Official discount rates at leading European centres continue to be quoted at 5 % in London, Paris, Ber­ lin, Vienna and Copenhagen; 6 % in Petrolgrad and Norway; 6M>% in Sweden, and 4 ^ % in Switzerland, Holland and Spain. In London the private bank rate has not been changed from 33^% for sixty days and 3 9-16% for ninety days. Money on call in London is still reported at 3 % . No reports have been received by cable of open market rates at other Eu­ ropean centres, as far as we have been able to ascertain. A further increase in gold of £105,401 was shown by this week’s statement of the Bank of England. N ote circulations was expanded £1,228,000; hence the total reserve declined $1,123,000. Phenomenally heavy increases were announced in the deposit items, and in consequence the proportion of reserve to liabilities was reduced to 15.18%, as compared with 18.22% last week and 19.40% a year ago. In the corresponding week of 1917, there was also a sub­ stantial decline, in round numbers from 27.27% to 19.40% . The expansion in public deposits totaled £2,400,000, in other deposits no less than £23,218,­ 000, while Government securities increased £14,586,­ 000. Loans (other securities) were increased £12,­ 137,000. Threadneedle Street’s stock of gold on hand aggregates £65,333,558. Last year it was £55, 242,729, and in 1916 £60,321,767. Reserves total £28,880,000, compared with £33,498,574 in 1917 and £42,405,582 the year previous. Loans now stand at £112,936,000, in comparison with £111,080,511 last year and £95,806,787 in 1916. Clearings through the London banks for the week were £419,650,000, comparing with £387,190,000 for the same week last year.

Saturday’s statement of New York Clearing House members, banks and trust companies, which will be found in more complete form on a later page of this issue, showed further spectacular changes in principal items, due to Treasury operations and a large increase in Government deposits with the banks, these deposits having risen from $371,786,000 to $506,930,000. Both aggregate and surplus re­ serves registered phenomenal gains (in excess of $100,000,000), while the reserve of member banks in the Federal Reserve Bank showed a corresponding increase. The loan item was reduced $66,891,000. Net demand deposits expanded $27,815,000, to $3,700,076,000 (Government deposits of $506,930,­ 000 deducted), although net time deposits declined $444,000. Cash in vaults (members of the Federal Reserve Bank) was reduced $2,722,000, to $96,513,­ 000 (not counted as reserve). Reserves in the Federal Reserve Bank of member banks showed the unusually large increase of $128,844,000, thus bringing up the total to $639,725,000.

The tone was steady with sixty and ninety days’ endorsed bills receivable and six months’ names of choice character still quoted at 5 % @ 6 % . Names not so well known still require 6% . Banks’ and bankers’ acceptances were in good demand from both local and out-of-town banks. In the opinion of some brokers, the supply of prime bills is wholly inadequate to meet the inquiry. Some relief to this state of affairs, however, is expected in the agreement of the Raw Silk Association to finance current business by the use of trade accept­ ances commencing in July. It is thought that this will pave the way for a still broader use of Though call loans have continued to rule high, the money situation has responded to the deposits of acceptances.

Boston. call money rates on Wednesday to 6 % was in large measure attributable to the closing of the subscrip­ tion lists the day before for the first offering of $750,­ 000,000 certificates. Announcement is made by the Capital Issues Committee of the appointment of Dud­ ley Cates of San Francisco as Secretary and Chief Ex­ aminer of the Committee and the creation under him of a new bureau of examiners to consider applica­ tions for approval of security issues. This bureau, the announcement says, will gather “ informa­ tion of these issues from local capital issues committees in each Federal Reserve district and from the Fuel, Food and Railroad Administrations, the War Industries Board and other Government depart­ ments which can throw light on the war necessity of the project covered by proposed securities issues.” Referring in greater detail to rates, loans on call covered a range for the week of 3 ^ @ 6 % comparing with 3 @ 5 % last week. On Monday 5% was the high, 3 y2% low and 4 % for renewals. Tuesday the maximum was advanced to 6 % and the minimum to 4 % , although 4 % was still the renewal basis. There was no range on Wednesday, 6 % having been quoted all day. Thursday was a holiday (Independ­ ence D a y ). On Friday rates again touched 6% and remained at that figure throughout the day. These rates apply to mixed collateral, all-industrials being quoted higher. For mixed maturities the situation is still about the same, though towards the close of the week a further slight easing was noted, mainly as a result of the redeposit of July disbursements in the banks, and rates declined to 5 H @ 5M % for sixty and ninety days, against 5 )^ @ 6 % , and to 5 % @ 6 % for four, five and six months, against 6 % last week. Funds were in more plentiful supply than for some time, so far as shorter periods were concerned.

The expansion in aggregate reserves amounted to $128,457,000, which carried the total to $663,143,000. This compares with $692,858,000 in the preceding year. Reserve requirements in­ creased $3,630,450; hence the gain in surplus aggre­ gated $124,826,550, and the total of excess reserves now stands at $171,971,680, on the basis of only 13% reserves for member banks of the Federal Reserve system (but not counting $96,513,000 cash in vaults held by these banks). At the correspond­ ing period in 1917 surplus reserves were $104,814,320, on the basis then current of 18% reserves, including cash in vault of member banks. • 4 4 4 4 4)4 4 4 4 4 4)4 454 4 454 454 454 454 5)4 454 454 454 454 454 454 5 454 454 6 5)4 5 454 5 454 454 454 454 6 5 5 5 6)4 6)4 5 5)4 5)4 6)4 6)4 5)4 5)4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 iH 4 4)4 4 4)4 4)4 4 H 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 4H 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 454 4)4 U2a 4)4 4H 4)4 4)4 454 4)4 4)4 4)4 4)4 454 4)4 4)4 * Rato of 3 to 4 )4 % for 1-day discounts in connection with the loan operations o f the Government. a 15 days and under 4 % .

The sterling exchange situation remains a purely arbitrary one with no important changes recorded for the week. Dealings continue to be confined to merely troutine business, and speculative in­ terests are for the time being out of the market. The Independence Day holiday on Thursday, which was widely observed on both sides of the Atlantic, served to accentuate the dulness. No arrangements for imports or exports of gold are announced during the week. As regards day-to-day rates, sterling exchange on Saturday, in contrast with Friday of last week, was quiet but fairly steady; demand bills ranged at 4 75 5-16@ 4 7535, cable transfers at 4 76 7-16, and sixty days at 4 7 2 ^ @ 4 72H- On Monday no in­ crease in activity was noted; the volume of trading was light and rates remained at 4 75 5-16 and 4 7535 for demand, 4 76 7-16 for cable transfers and 4 7 2 ^ @ 4 7 2 ^ for sixty days. Dealings on Tuesday were exceptionally dull, so much so that 10 THE CHRONICLE the market at times was almost at a complete stand­ still; consequently, quotations remained pegged at the preceding day’s levels. Pre-holiday conditions ruled on Wednesday and very little business was transacted; the undertone, however, was steady, and quotations, though these were hardly more than nominal, were maintained unchanged. On Friday the market was somewhat irregular, although actual rates were still without change. Closing quotations were 4 7 2 % @ 4 72% for sixty days, 4 75 5-16@4 7535 for demand and 4 76 7-16 for cable transfers. Commercial sight bills finished at 4 75@ 4 7534, sixty days at 4 7 1 % @ 4 71% , ninety days at 4 70@ 4 70% , documents for payment (sixty days) 4 71 @ 4 71% , and seven day grain bills at 4 7 4 % @ 4 74% . Cotton and grain for pay­ ment closed at 4 75@ 4 75% . Dulness was again the outstanding feature of the week’s operations in the Continental exchanges and transactions were exceptionally light in volume, with only slight variations in rates recorded. Observance of the Independence holiday both here and abroad was an additional factor in the general inactivity. Exchange on Rome was firm and advanced another 5 points, chiefly on the increasingly favorable char­ acter of the war news from the Italian front and the successful working of the plan recently promulgated for the stabilization o f Italian exchange. The Fed­ eral Director of the Division of Foreign Exchange has ordered a further rise in the official rate for cables to 8 80. It is understood that arrangements have been made by the United States with the British Gov­ ernment for a supply of rupee exchange sufficient to finance for an indefinite period imports from India that are required for civil or military purposes. Un­ der this agreement the price will be 35.73 per rupee for telegraphic transfers. The sale of rupee exchange for the purposes above specified will be administered through the Federal Reserve Board. Francs were well maintained and remained practically unchanged. Ruble exchange has failed to reflect any of the recent changes reported in Russian affairs, the quotation being entirely nominal, with no business transacted. Quotations for German and Austrian exchange are not available, as all transactions have of necessity been suspended. A cable dispatch from Berne dated June 29 states that the German exchange rate at that centre has again been decreased, the rate now being 66.67 francs for 100 marks. The Austrian crown col­ lapsed to below 40 francs for 100 crowns. The unofficial London check rate in Paris closed at 27.16 (unchanged). In New York sight bills on the French centre finished at 5 71% , against 5 71% ; cables at 5 69% , against 5 70; commercial sight at 5 72% , against 5 72% , and commercial sixty days at 5 77% , against 5 78 last week. Lire closed at 8 81 for bank­ ers’ sight bills and 8 80 for cables, as compared with 8 86 and 8 85 in the week previous. Rubles have not been changed from 14 for checks and 15 for cables. Greek exchange continues to be quoted at 5 13% for checks and 5 12% for cables. In the neutral exchanges trading has been dull and uninteresting. Fluctuations were for the most part meaningless and confined to fractions. The under­ tone was somewhat easier, and pesetas and Scan­ dinavian rates registering slight declines. Swiss exchange was relatively firmer. As has been pointed out in this column, any favorable development likely to result in a material shortening of the duration [V o l . 107. of the war would undoubtedly be followed by a pronounced advance in all Allied exchange, which would inevitably militate toward a corresponding decline in neutral rates. Bankers’ sight on Amster­ dam closed at 50% , against 50% ; cables at 51% , against 50% ; commercial sight at 50 11-16, against 50 5-16, and commercial sixty days at 50 9-16, against 50 3-16 on Friday of a week ago. Swiss exchange finished at 3 99 for bankers’ sight bills and cables at 3 95, comparing with 4 00% and 3 96 last week. Copenhagen checks finished at 30.80 and cables at 31.20. Checks on Sweden finished at 34.90 and cables at 35.30, against 35% and 35% , and checks on Norway closed at 31.20 and cables 31.60, against 31.30 and 31.70 the week preceding. Spanish pesetas finished at 27% for checks and 27% for cables. The previous close was 27.45 and 28. In South American quotations, the rate for checks on Argentina is now 44.90 and cables 45.00, against 44.85 and 45.00. For Brazil the check rate is 25.15 and cables 25.25, against 24.90 and 25. The Chilean rate has not been changed from 17 9-32 and for Peru 57. Far Eastern rates are as follows: Hong Kong, 78.65@78.85, against 79@79.15; Shanghai, 113% @ 114% , against 114@114% ; Yokohama, 53@ 53% , against 53@53.15; Manila, 49% @ 5 0 (un­ changed); Singapore, 5 6 % @ 5 6 % (unchanged); Bom­ bay, 36% @ 37 (unchanged), and Calcutta (cables), 35.73 (unchanged). The New York Clearing House banks, in their oper­ ations with interior banking institutions, have lost $1,708,000 net in cash as a result of the currency movements for the week ending July 5. Their receipts from the interior have aggregated $5,588,000, while the shipments have reached $7,296,000. Adding the Sub-Treasury and Federal Reserve operations, which together occasioned a loss of $116,463,000, the com­ bined result of the flow of money into and out of the New York banks for the week appears to have been a loss of $118,171,000, as follows: Week ending July 5.

THE AMERICAN ARMY IN FRANCE. The stirring celebrations on the Fourth of July, at home and abroad, found for their theme a host of considerations, all bound up with the momentous decision of the United States in participating in the European war for the future of civilization, and with the manner in which our Government’s pledge of April 1917 has been redeemed. But nothing could possibly have contributed more meaning to the cele­ bration than the news that our army in and on the way to Europe had crossed the million mark. Ju l y THE CHRONICLE 6 1918.] The announcement regarding the number of our soldiers transported to France, made by the Secre­ tary of War in his letter to the President last Tues­ day, gives the specific data of an achievement unprece­ dented in history. Transportation of troops in large numbers across the ocean is of itself an episode familiar enough. The British attack on Napoleon by way of Spain and Portugal necessitated transfer of what were then considered large bodies of troops from England to the peninsula, and this was done in the face of hostile frigates on the sea. Transport of armies by the long sea route was the primary con­ sideration in England’s Crimean war against Russia, and in the war of 1899 with the Transvaal. In this present war also, military forces running well up towards the million mark have been carried across the ocean from Canada and Australia to France, and from England and France to the Eastern Mediter­ ranean. In all these previous episodes, as in that of our own army’s during the past fourteen months, losses of transport ships and of the soldiers on them were extraordinarily small. But the achievement described by Secretary Baker stands for many reasons in a place of its own in military history. The armies transported overseas in earlier wars were small enough to detach only a few vessels from the Admiralty service. Transportation of the Canadian and Australian troops in this war occupied in all a period of two or three years, and a large number of those troops were carried over at a time when German submarine activities had not developed to their present stage. In the case of our own army the problem was such as seemed, even six months ago, to render physically impossible the placing of more than a million American soldiers in Europe almost within a year after our own declara­ tion of war. The submarine campaign was at its height of achievement at the time. The supply of shipping available for army transport was heavily curtailed through losses by submarines, and what was left appeared to be inadequate even to carry the urgently needed food to Europe— this irrespective of ship­ ments of munitions and of the ordinary commercial service. Yet what our Army and N avy Depart­ ments have done in the face of these formidable handicaps may be seen by the following numerical table, submitted this week by the War Department, of troops embarked in each month since our declara­ tion of war in April 1917: 1017- —M a y _____________ J u n o _____________ J u ly .........................

As will be seen from the above table, the rate of shipment, prior to the beginning of the German offensive the present year, in March, was comparatively small. By the end of last Octo­ ber, when we had been at war six months, only 11G,072 troops of all sorts had been sent abroad; by the end of 1917 only 187,928; at the end of last February, after ten months of belligerency, only 282,731. The number sent out in any one month of that ten-months period had never exceeded 50,000, and on an average below 1,500 per day. Such was the speeding-up process after that time, however, that in May 7,882 men per day were sent out for Europe, and in June, 9,212 per day; the total for the four past months being two and a half time 11 as great as in the ten months which preceded them. This occurred not only during the acute shortage of shipping, but in face of a submarine activity extended even to American waters. Yet of this great total of more than a million men transported, only 291 were lost at sea, and those on returning transports. It is entirely probable that even our own Govern­ ment regarded any such achievement as impossible until the urgent need for it developed last March. Among the military critics it had been the common estimate that one million trained American troops could not be placed in France until well on in 1919. A very few months ago, Secretary Baker informed the Congressional Committee, as his best estimate, that half a million men could be placed in France early in the present year, and, perhaps, 1,500,000 by 1919. But it is now known that the War Department is prepared, if necessary, to have the million and a half of troops at the front before September. That Germany was wholly skeptical as to the possibility of anything of this sort has been proved not only by official and semi-official comments on the American effort, but by the well known fact that Hindenburg and Ludendorff expected to complete their campaign by 1918 before American reinforcements of any magnitude could arrive. The fact that our troops had reached the front in any number was never admitted publicly in German official circles until last week’s speech by Foreign Secretary von Kuehlmann and that was based on an estimate that 700,000 were accounted for. The two questions now uppermost in the matter are, first, how troops could have been transported with such immunity from attacks by the enemy, and second, just how much their arrival means to the rest of the campaign in France. The answer to the first question is that the problem of naval escort has been solved with unprecedented efficiency. That our destroyer fleet has absolutely driven away the submarines from the transport convoys— in some of which 10,000 men or thereabouts were carried on a single ocean ship— illustrates not only the skill and care of our naval service, but the fact that the submarine commanders, however bold in the general risks which they take, are in mortal terror of an armed destroyer. For that state of mind their own experience has given abundant reason, and the pub­ lished narratives and memoirs of German submarine officers provide additional proof of their attitude. It is, perhaps, too early to say with confidence how far these American reinforcements will serve to turn the scale of battle. The general estimate is that 700,000 out of the million men already sent constitute the strictly fighting units; the others being various classes of auxiliary forces. Even if we take the largest estimate of Allied losses in the present campaign through killed, wounded and prisoners— which is 500,000— it would then appear that the Allied army is now stronger than on March 21. The German losses can hardly have been less than the figure named for the Allies; as the attacking force, they have probably lost much more, and it is quite impossible that half a million new and effective troops could have been added to the German forces during the past four months. Apparently, then, the statement of Lloyd George in March that the Allies were numerically the stronger on the Western front— a statement not borne out by immediately subsequent events— is 12 THE CHRONICLE now actually correct. It would remain, however, to determine just how effective as fighting men the American reinforcements are. Thus far they have stood the test brilliantly and in some particulars— such as coolness, dash, accuracy of rifle and artillery fire— have attracted the warmest public approval of the French commanders. It is also true that the responsibility placed on the American troops and the actual defensive positions assigned to them show that a far greater reliance on their fighting efficiency is now being taken by the Allied commanders than any one had supposed possible within so short a time. No doubt, the achievements at Cantigny and at Chateau-Thierry and at Vaux, in which the Germans were repeatedly worsted by the American attack, were helped by the fact that our best troops— the men with the longest training, such as the marines— were the first to be assigned to responsible positions. Nevertheless, it is evident that many of the men enlisted last autumn have taken part in these success­ ful engagements and have individually acquited themselves with notable distinction. This is suffi­ ciently proved by the record of medals and distinc­ tions conferred, in which case the names can be identified. Furthermore, even in the case of divi­ sions not yet adequately trained for active service at the battle-front, it must be remembered that their presence in France or England releases a given number of Allied troops which have had a longer and more thorough preparation. ' It is best not to expect too much at once, and the policy of the defensive, pursued by General Foch ever since the German attack began in March, is not likely to be abandoned until our entire reinforce­ ment can be classed as seasoned troops. But the men are there, we have more to send, and in any event, the chance of Hindenburg’s army driving its way through, by pure force of numerical superiority, from the present line to Paris or the Channel ports, appears to have vanished with the new American man-power in the ranks. THE MILITARY PRODUCTION OF FRANCE. As, after some delay, America has now got her stride in the production of war material, it is in­ teresting to see what France is doing. We have before us the semi-official report made last Decem­ ber in Boulogne by Lieutenant Maury of the Commit­ tee on “ The Work of France and Her Allies.” It covers the earlier and most distressing period of the war, the three and a half years following the passion­ ate uprising of the nation to preserve its existence, a period during which it has shown a strength of purpose, a fertility of effort and an abundance of resources which have surprised the world. The German army entered Belgium with an un­ paralleled equipment; “ infantry with a long train of machine guns and cannon of every kind; cavalry with automatic rifles and guns mounted for recon­ naissance and advance-guard actions; engineers pro­ vided with every implement for destruction and construction; artillery of every calibre with both horse and automatic traction,; aviation with all the apparatus for assembling, taking apart and repairing; signal corps with balloons and dirigibles.” T o meet this France sprang to creating her material of war. In September 1914 the Government gath­ ered the heads of the metal industries for conference in Bordeaux. The invasion had already deprived [Vol. 107. France of three-fourths of her resources and indus­ trial plants; the coal mines of the Departments of the North and the East, the military shops of Douai, the great factories of Lille, of the valley of the Marne and of the region of Brey. In January 1915 the Germans boasted that “ of the 127 chief furnaces which were at work in 1913, out of the 170 existing in all France, not less than 95 were in the war zone and in German possession. The remaining 30 could hardly supply France.” France had lost 50% of her coal, 90% of her iron ore, 80% of her furnaces and her steel. Despite the terrible losses France organized her industries to meet the need. Vast establishments were improvised or re-created on all sides. Even though England could send only 100,000 soldiers to her assistance, and Italy had not entered the war, she called back her skilled workmen from the front and, in face of the German hordes, set herself to produce all the materials of war not only for herself, but for the Belgians, the Serbs and the Russians, for all of whom she had from that hour to set apart a considerable portion of her production. Her soldiers faced the enemy in 1914 with the minimum of even the most necessary material; with­ out barbed wire, with but few machine guns, with­ out trench mortars, without fuses and search-lights to guard supplies, with a limited supply of airplanes and balloons, with only the aid of their effective “ 75s,” and of some heavy guns mounted in their forts. They saw in the months following a stream begin of barbed wire, machine guns, trench mortars, shells, search-lights, aeroplanes, balloons, hand grenades, self-operating bombs, anti-airplane guns, and, above all, of heavy field guns, and at last monster cannon and tanks. To-day her equipment for observa­ tion and destruction is not inferior to that of the enemy. For every 100 machine guns of 1914 her infantry had 9,000 in 1916. For each 100 bombs available for the artillery in 1914 there were 3,000 in 1916. Since that date her resources have not ceased to grow. A few facts may be given. At the opening of the war she produced 13,000 shells for the 75s a day, in June 1917 she was making 250,000 daily, besides 100,000 heavy bombs. To understand the significance of these figures it may be said that in some of the battles of last year every metre of Ger­ man trench received the shock of 1,500 kilos of pro­ jectile, 200 discharged by the trench guns, 450 by the 75s, 700 by the heavy artillery, and 150 by the great guns at the remote rear. The discharge of shells, necessarily small at the opening of the war, has attained to from six to seven millions monthly. In a great offensive prolonged through seven weeks it rises to double that number. This is required by the weight of the enemy’s attack. The loss of men by the French has diminished as the use of shells has increased. The size of the French army has grown in marked degree. To what has been said is to be added the list of small arms by the million automatic rifles and pistols, 37’s, &c., made for the infantry, enormous amounts of munitions and supplies, metal helmets, gas masks, and, not less all the chemicals of war, of which the development and production have been mar­ velous. All this has been possible only because the women of France have entered the factories by the hundreds of thousands. Ju l y 6 1918.] THE CHRONICLE Furthermore, since the opening of 1915,. France has re-equipped the infantry, artillery and aviation of Russia with rifles by the 100,000, machine guns, automatic pistols, cannon of all sizes by the thousand, aeroplanes by the hundred, motors by the thousand and munitions unlimited (of which unfortunately Russia has made pitiful use). At certain periods the mass of material sent to Russia has represented in weight more than sixteen million kilogrammes, and in volume more than 20,000 cubic metres. For a long time France has supplied Italy also with a vast amount of war material. She has given her an important stock of implements for aviation, and a not less important quantity of material of heavy artillery, with hundreds of trench mortars; and she keeps up the supply of shells and bombs necessary for these guns. She has contribu­ ted also to the replacement of the enormous loss of material on the Isonzo and the Tagliamento. Be­ sides all this she has not ceased to send her a great tonnage of coal, of steel, of aluminium and of chemicals, and all the supplies necessary for the conduct of war. To the other Allies, Serbia and Rumania, France has supplied all sorts of war material, arm"
