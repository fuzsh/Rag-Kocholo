However, the actual shipping charges may vary. If the difference is more than 15%, we will contact you via phone or email and obtain your consent before finalizing the purchase.\n\nShipping Addresses\n\nTo keep the shipping costs as low as possible and to provide you with the best possible service, here are some guidelines:\n\nMake sure that the delivery address is accurate.\n\nIf you want the shipment delivered to your business address, you must mention the name of the business so that the carrier knows where the merchandise is being delivered to.\n\nPO boxes shouldn't be specified as shipment addresses.\n\nFreight carriers do not deliver to PO Boxes.\n\nBusinesses operating from home must use residential addresses and are charged accordingly for delivery.\n\nWhen you are placing an order online, make sure to include the right phone number. If something happens to your shipment, we will inform you. Carriers also frequently contact you beforehand so that you are available at your location to receive your order. If the carrier is unable to reach you, they may be unable to deliver your belongings.\n\nIf you choose to modify your delivery address after placing your order, extra carrier charges will be applied and will be communicated to you. However, it is not possible to modify the shipping address if you placed your order using the Credit option.\n\nIn case of an unsuccessful delivery attempt, the redelivery fees can be incurred in addition to any reconsignment fees,\n\nMultiple Items\n\nIf you have multiple items in one order, we will dispatch your order once the items get restocked.\n\nShipping Partners\n\nYour orders are delivered through our selected shipping partners.\n\nAll unused and regularly stocked items can be returned, except those included in the \"Final Sale & Non-Returnable Items\" list below. To do this, contact our customer support team within 30 days of purchase. Our representative will authorize a return and provide additional information for completing the return process. Each return is subject to a 15% restocking fee subtracted from the refund amount. The buyer is also responsible for arranging for a shipping agency to return the product and paying any shipping fees incurred.\n\nAll returned items must be in brand-new condition, unused, and in original packaging.\n\nOther Types of Returns\n\nPlease be aware that \"special order items\" such as customized fabrications and other furniture items are not refundable. Items delivered directly to you from the supplier must have return permission from the manufacturer. A member of our customer service team may assist you in obtaining such authorization. Please contact us at 1 (800) 598-5889, sales@thehorecastore.com.\n\nFinal Sale & Non-Returnable Items\n\nUsed supplies and equipment.\n\nCustomized order items.\n\nCloseout products.\n\nPerishable and edible items, such as foods, and disposable items like lids, plates, and cups.\n\nProducts available in aerosol cans\n\nItems containing flammable liquids\n\nHazardous products\n\nFurniture.\n\nProducts shipped to U.S. territories and areas outside the United States.\n\nItems delivered outside the contiguous United States, including Hawaii, Alaska, and all U.S. territories.\n\nFees\n\nRestocking fees\n\nThere are numerous charges associated with processing a return. To keep them low, we charge a 15% restocking fee on all returned items.\n\nAdditional Restocking Fees\n\nIn some cases, additional handling and shipping charges will be applied throughout the return procedure. Please ensure that \"Free Shipping\" only applies to anything shipped directly from The Horeca Store to you. Free delivery does not apply to returns. These fees will be deducted from your refund."
