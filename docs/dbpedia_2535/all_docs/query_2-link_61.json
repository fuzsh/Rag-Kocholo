This also includes Scandinavia because researchers often extrapolate from Sweden’s experience while ignoring important differences related to actual policies in core areas of the welfare state and when policies are similar, the underlying historical and socioeconomic conditions that favor outcomes that are similar to Sweden.

Contrary to critiques, Esping-Andersen argues that there is nothing wrong with this state of affairs since multiple fields of studies have an ethnocentric reference point. As an example, he mentions the study of bureaucracy and its Weberian/Prussian roots. See Esping-Andersen, Gosta, “The Comparative Macro-Sociology of Welfare States,” in Social Exchange and Welfare Development, ed. Moreno, Luis (Madrid, 1993).Google Scholar\n\n7. The Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) was created in 1932. The CCF changed its name at the federal level to become the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1961. Saskatchewan followed suit in 1967. When discussing both eras, I employ the acronym CCF/NPD. Otherwise, I refer to the party name within its historical context.\n\n105. National Council of Welfare, Medicare: The Public Good and Private Practice (Ottawa, 1982), 47–51. A potential explanation for this outcome may be due to the large number of aboriginals residing in Saskatchewan (roughly 12 percent). They have noticeably lower socioeconomic outcomes than nonaboriginals and are covered mostly by federal social programs. In fact, Blakeney states in his memoirs that improving relations between aboriginals and nonaboriginal people is the greatest challenge facing Saskatchewan’s future.
