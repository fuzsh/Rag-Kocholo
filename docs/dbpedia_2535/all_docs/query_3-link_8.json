The family-owned business has been an integral part of Swift Current, providing reliable insurance services to residents and businesses since 1913.  Speaking about the momentous occasion, Owner, William Smith, expressed his gratitude for the trust and support the community has shown his family's business over the years.  “We're just so grateful that we're able to stick around and still be part of the community and we've got a lot of great staff here that work really hard to keep this business growing,” he stated.  W.W. Smith Insurance Ltd was established in 1913 by William Smith's great-grandfather, William Wensley Smith.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { if($(document).width()<900) { s = googletag.defineSlot('/50748803/scol-all-bigbox', [300, 250], 'div-gpt-1648064098496-bbm1'); s.setTargeting('URL', [window.location.pathname]); s.setTargeting('position', [1648064098496]) s.addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().refresh([s], {changeCorrelator: false}); } });  The company was then passed down to William’s grandfather, Jerry Smith, before being passed to Gord Smith, and now William himself.  Smith added that the secret to their longevity comes down to hard work and the ability to constantly adapt.  “My dad put in a lot of work into this business, so, for me to come in about 10 years ago, we've really tried to take the reins and begin to start pushing the envelope as far as technology in the office,” he elaborated. “It's an honour having lasted this long, it's pretty phenomenal.”  As part of the anniversary celebrations, W.W. Smith Insurance Ltd was the featured business at the first Market Square of the season over the weekend.  “We had a little prize wheel set up with a number of prizes, including a cash prize and found that we had a lineup to do that, and it was kind of fun being able to give ten dollars cash,” he elaborated. “Our big prize was 110 dollars, a play on our anniversary, and it was fun seeing people win that and then be able to spend it on the vendors that were there, we had a blast being a part of that.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { if($(document).width()<900) { s = googletag.defineSlot('/50748803/scol-all-bigbox', [300, 250], 'div-gpt-1648064098496-bbm2'); s.setTargeting('URL', [window.location.pathname]); s.setTargeting('position', [1648064098496]) s.addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().refresh([s], {changeCorrelator: false}); } });  As a part of the celebration on Saturday, W.W. Smith also made a significant donation to the Doctor Noble Irwin Regional Healthcare Foundation.  Smith noted that the 25,000-dollar donation to the foundation has deep roots in the company’s history.  “We always love to support Doctor Noble Irwin and to take it back a little bit, Doctor Noble and my grandfather, Jerry, were actually pretty good friends, so, it's fun to have that connection as well, but we really like to support that foundation,” he explained.  Reflecting on the future, Smith hopes to remain a pillar of the Swift Current community.  “We're obviously happy to be a part of Swift Current and you know we want to continue to be a strong business in the heart of Swift.",
