BOX 6, REGINA, SASKATCHEWAN Ten years ago, at the time of Saskatchewan's Golden Jubilee, there were indications that this great agricultural province was beginning to move forward. Now, as Saskatchewan observes its Diamond Jubilee and looks to Canada's Centennial in 1967, many of those signs have been justified. No longer can Saskatchewan be termed a \"have-not\" province. On many fronts it is advancing into national significance. Its prosperity is no longer based almost entirely on agriculture. It now ranks fourth in mineral production, second in oil products, and its industrial horizons are steadily widening. Hotelmen and the Hotels Association of Saskatchewan are glad to have participated in the expansion and development which has characterized the last decade. It has been a period of good times, a period which has made many heavy demands on the hotel industry as it endeavored to cope with the pressure for better accommodation and- the modern way of life. Hotels in the larger centres attract great conventions and cater to the increasing tourist trade. In the smaller centres, the hotel remains the hub of community life, still required to provide attractive amenities. Today, in this Diamond Jubilee year, the hotel industry stands ready to meet the future, determined to face any challenge and prepared to continue its important role under changing conditions . Hotelmen everywhere congratulate Saskatchewan and its people on their meritorious achievement since the province was established. The hotel industry pledges itself to play an integral part, to grow with the province, in the years ahead. 1 Pxecait Concrete Company, Jtyd. 950 Winnipeg Street' (L. M. Dowie) PHONES: P.O.

LYONE - PUBLISHER ESTABLISHED 19 4 8 304 GLENGARRY BLOCK Telephone 652-8433 SASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN This book, commemorating Saskatchewan’s Diamond Jubilee, is the logical successor to the book Western Canada Directories Ltd. published in 1955 when the province was observing its 50th anniversary. That book, the largest ever produced in this province, received fine public response, and demand for copies originated from many countries. It is the belief of the producers and editors that this edition will be equally well recognized. A few changes in format have been introduced, and some features of the previous edition have been eliminated, but Western Canada Directories believes that this Diamond Jubilee edition will prove even more valuable in giving publicity to the really surpris¬ ing developments in Saskatchewan. The last decade has been one of marked expansion and growth and, on all sides, confidence has been expressed that the next decade will be even more amazing in the variety and extent of the province’s economic development. Government leaders have spoken recently in most optimistic terms of the future — and a quick glance at the changed landscape of Saskatchewan emphasizes the giant strides of recent years. The management of Western Canada Directories Ltd. wishes to thank the civic officials and individuals who co-operated so willingly in supplying information abouit their communities. Some very fine material was forthcoming from some centres, and this is gratefully acknowledged. On the other hand, a few communities failed to provide any information, despite numerous requests for some statistics on which to base stories. The management regrets that in these cases, the story may either be inadequate or non¬ existent. Attempting to produce a book of this size entails a terrific amount of effort and the finished product has been made possible in great measure only through the assistance of those who desired to ensure that their communities received merited publicity. To all these, the sincere thanks of the management of Western Canada Directories Ltd. It is virtually impossible to obtain copies of our Golden Jubilee edition and it is suggested that persons wishing copies of this latest book should send in orders at once to assure receiving copies, for the initial printing is naturally limited, due to the great size of the publication. Inevitably, in an undertaking of this nature some errors will occur. Every effort has been made to assure accuracy, but where errors are found the publishers ask the indulgence of all concerned. Western Canada Directories Ltd. expresses best wishes to the province and its people in 1965, and trusts that in the years immediately ahead Saskatchewan will progress and develop on all fronts and in every phase of activity.

SASKATOON — REGINA — RED DEER — VANCOUVER 7 History of Saskatchewan By GRANT MAXWELL SASKATCHEWAN is such a young province that one might assume that its history could not be very inter¬ esting. Nothing could be further off the mark. Saskatche¬ wan is marking its first 60 years as a self-governing mem¬ ber of Canadian Confederation — only a moment, his¬ torically speaking — but in actual fact its story is much older than that, centuries old. And that story is a fabulous one, even if we restrict ourselves to the events and per¬ sonalities which have been outstanding in the brief span of half a century. The province of Saskatchewan has already associated with it the memory of such men as La Verendrye, Kelsey, Tache, McLean, Riel, Laird, Laurie, Haultain, Laurier, Scott, Wheeler, Murray and countless others. The story of Saskatchewan is the story of mass immigration and mass settlement, of great crops and successive failures due to drought, rust, grasshoppers and other natural ene¬ mies, of free-spending prosperity and abject, bitter poverty, of the fur-trade and the building of the railway, of pioneer exploits and the Riel rebellion, of riots and triumphs of brave missionaries and crusading newspaper publishers. It is impossible, all too obviously, to summarize Sask¬ atchewan’s story. Perhaps, though, some idea, some reali¬ zation of the scope of the province’s history can be gained by a capsule review chronologically of some of the most representative events which have occurred in the last 300 years. This “calendar” at least should whet appetites for more detailed accounts of our province’s story down the years. A CALENDAR OF REPRESENTATIVE EVENTS 1665 — Radisson and Groseilliers travelled to Hudson’s Bay from Lake Superior. The two Frenchmen subsequently were won over to the English cause in the Anglo-French rivalry then rife in Canada. Their explorations led to the formation of the Hudson’s Bay Company. 1670 — King Charles II ceded to the Hudson’s Bay Company much of the region which now makes up Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. 1690 — Henry Kelsey is said to have penetrated the prairie region from the Bay. 1735-50 — La Verendrye, French explorer, his sons and their brave lieutenants made several trips into the great north¬ west. They crossed that region which is now southern Saskatchewan and sighted the Rocky Mountains in 1743; they may have been the first white men to have travelled so far west. A number of French missionary priests ac¬ companied them and several of the expeditionary force were massacred by marauding Indians. 1753 — Fort a la Corne was established on the Saskatchewan river east of what is now Prince Albert by a relation of La Verendrye. The fort was a receiving centre for furs. 1754 — Anthony Henday (Hendry), member of the Hudson’s Bay Company, visited Fort a la Corne where he was momentarily detained by the French. Subsequently, he travelled across what is now central Saskatchewan and is believed to have been the first white man to see the future site of Saskatoon on the South Saskatchewan River. It has been claimed that he was the first white man to have seen the Rocky Mountains north of Color¬ ado. 1813 — The Presbyterian parish of Kildonan, which went without a minister for many years, was established by the Selkirk settlers on the Red River. Kildonan was the first Christian parish erected in the northwest. 1818 — Father Joseph N. Provencher established the Roman Catholic Mission of St. Boniface in the Red River colony. The next year he visited Bay forts at Qu’Appelle and Souris. 1820 — Reverend John West, Hudson’s Bay Company chap¬ lain, arrived at the Red River colony to found the first Church of England mission in the northwest. 1840 — The Wesleyan Missionary Society (Methodist) of England sent a group of missionaries into the Bay terri¬ tories. 1845 — The Anglican mission of La Ronge was established, one of the first Church of England outposts in what is now Saskatchewan. 1846 — A Catholic mission was founded at lie a la Crosse. 1851 — Bishop Tache settled at lie a la Crosse as vicar of the Oblate missions in the northwest. 1855 — -By this time — 110 years ago — the Hudson’s Bay Company was operating fur trading posts at Forts Pelly, Ellice, Qu’Appelle, a la Corne, Pitt and Carlton. Fort Garry on the Red River was the chief post. 1857 — Captain Palliser explored the prairie region. 1860 — Three Sisters of Charity joined the Catholic mission at He a la Crosse. 1866 — Reverend James Nesbit, Presbyterian missionary, founded Prince Albert on the North Saskatchewan river. 1867 — The year of Confederation; Canada became a self- governing dominion in the British Empire. 1869 — The Canadian Parliament passed an act providing for the temporary governing of Rupert’s Land, much of the great northwest, which was to be turned over to the Dominion by the Hudson’s Bay Company. 1869-70 — Louis Riel, Metis, masterminded the cause of the Metis who protested the terms of the transfer of the Red River area to the Canadian government. Riel’s “provi¬ sional government” sent delegates to Ottawa. Some of their demands were incorporated into the bill by which the province of Manitoba was created. The North West Territories at the same time were taken into Confedera¬ tion and the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba was to supervise the territories’ affairs in an ex-officio capacity. Riel eventually went into exile in Montana and many of the Metis around the Red River crossed the prairies and settled along the banks of the South Saskatchewan River, southwest of Prince Albert. 1871 — The Canadian Parliament passed a bill giving the Manitoba Lieutenant-Governor a council to help in gov¬ erning the vast northwest. The council had little to do actually, for the federal government handled all major affairs. 1873 — Eighty some Assiniboines were shot by five Ameri¬ can raiders at the Farwell trading post in the Cypress Hills. This incident led to the formation by the federal government of the North West Mounted Police who were to restore order and keep in check the unscrupulous traders and thieves who crossed into Canada from the U.S. “Wild West.” In this year a Father Andre, an Oblate priest, founded a mission at St. Laurent, the oldest of the French settlements in the vicinity of the South Sask¬ atchewan river. That year, too, a council was established for the North West Territories. 1874 — The first contingent of the North West Mounted Police made its memorable trek across the plains, suf¬ fering great hardships and considerable loss of horses and equipment. A band of telegraphers founded Battle- ford, then named Telegraph Flats; they were building a telegraph line between Winnipeg and Edmonton, then the expected route for Canada’s first transcontinental railway. Archdeacon John McLean was named the first bishop of the Anglican diocese of Saskatchewan (com¬ prising much of the present parkland and central area) and travelled overland to Prince Albert, his episcopal seat. Father Andre founded the Duck Lake Mission. 1875— Parliament passed a North West Territories act, giving the territories a lieutenant-governor and council and erecting the provisional districts of Assiniboia (in¬ cluding southern Saskatchewan today), Saskatchewan (including what is now much of the northern and central region of the province), Alberta and Athabasca. 1876— The Hon. David Laird, native of Prince Edward Island, was appointed the Territories’ first lieutenant- governor and the members of his council were Lt. Col. Richardson, Matthew Ryan, Lt. Col. McLeod, with A. E. Forget as clerk. The first seat of government was at Fort Livingstone, near Fort Pelly, in what is now east central Saskatchewan. 1877 — Battleford (no longer known as Telegraph Flats) was chosen as the capital of the territories after Governor Laird and his council had met at Fort Livingstone. That year the Reverend James Robertson founded the railway missions for Presbyterians in anticipation of the construc¬ tion of the first railway across the prairies. 8 1878 — The northwest council held its first session in Battle- ford in July. The following month an enterprising news¬ paperman and publisher, P. ,G. Laurie, who had travel¬ led overland with a printing press, published the first issue of the Saskatchewan Herald in Battleford. The weekly was the first paper published in the territories and one of the finest as well. 1879 — Bishop McLean founded in Prince Albert, Emmanuel College for the training of mission workers. About the same time the Catholic priest, Father Andre, founded St. Anne’s convent in the same centre. 1881 — Paddle-wheeling, flat-bottomed, wood-burning steam¬ boats were plying the Saskatchewan river system but their days were already numbered. They carried both freight and passengers but in only a few years, in the first of the two “railway decades,” steam engines, not steam boats would be the west’s most vital communica¬ tions link. 1882 — This year saw the coming of the railway — the Can¬ adian Pacific — then being built across the nation to the Pacific coast. The advent of steel across southern Saskat¬ chewan saw the establishment of thriving settlements overnight, chief of which were Regina (Pile O’ Bones), Moose Jaw, Swift Current, Indian Head, South Qu’- Appelle and Moosomin. The decision to build the CPR across the southern prairies and not between Winnipeg and Edmonton dashed the fond hopes of the residents of Battleford, the territorial capital. This same year John N. Lake led a resolute band of surveyors and visionaries to a point on the South Saskatchewan where it was decided to found a Temperance Colony; Lake uttered the historic words, “Arise, Saskatoon, Queen of the North.” And in 1882 a Father Hugounard at Que- Appelle brought what is believed to have been the first cord binder into the northwest — sign of things to come. 1883 — Battleford saw a rival community growing up across the valley — what is now called North Battleford. And the old Battleford lost its main claim to distinction as the capital; Regina on the CPR line was designated seat of the government of the North West Territories. Lieut¬ enant-Governor Edgar Dewdney opened the fifth session of the territorial body in Regina in August. A great journalist and future parliamentarian, Nicholas Flood Davin, founded the Regina Leader. Farther north, John Lake’s first band of adventurous temperance colonists arrived at the Saskatoon site after travelling overland from Moose Jaw, the nearest railway point. The Church of England founded the diocese of Qu’Appelle. These activities in the great northwest stimulated imaginations all around the world and resulted in some colorful in¬ cidents: witness the establishment of Cannington Manor, whene young Englishmen were to learn farming and where the Beckton brothers imported the first thorough¬ bred racers in what is now Saskatchewan. A similar venture in this period was the settling of a number of French counts around Whitewood. 1884 — Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney passed an ordinance creating the first nine rural municipalities and two towns; Regina and Moose Jaw. Only four of the RM’s were established: Qu’Appelle, Wolseley, Indian Head and South Qu’Appelle. The first school district was estab¬ lished in Moose Jaw. The main developments, however, occurred far to the north: The Metis and many other settlers in the Prince Albert district finally lost patience with Ottawa’s indifference over several years in the face of demands for justice and assistance. Economic unrest and political agitation was rife in the district among nearly all the racial and religious groups at first. In May, Gabriel Dumont, famous hunter and former associate of Riel, was asked to lead the protest movement but he declined. Then, following a mass meeting, Dumont and a few others rode south to Montana and persuaded Riel to come to Prince Albert to lead the movement. Mass meet- mgs followed and at first Riel enjoyed a wide measure of support among the settlers. 18®?T™s was ,the year of the famous “Rebellion” or Uprising,” whichever term you prefer. In response to a petition asking for liberal treatment of the Indians, granting of scrip and land patents to Metis, a measure of self-government and reduced tariffs; the government announced in January that a commission would be ap¬ pointed to study westerners’ grievances. It was too late, and to make matters worse, Riel had become progres- sively deranged, alienating many of his erstwhile follow¬ ers; he was proclaiming unorthodox religious beliefs which led to his being denied the sacraments in the Catholic church. The rebellion began March 19 in Botoche where Riel proclaimed a “provisional govern¬ ment.” Fighting began a week later outside Duck Lake, where Dumont and volunteers forced a band of Mounted Police to retreat. Soon Fort Carlton was abandoned in the same area. At Battleford, Cree Indians from the Poundmaker and Little Pine reserves pillaged the Hud¬ son’s Bay store and terrorized the settlers. Far north, Crees led by Big Bear murdered several settlers and missionaries at Frog Lake and occupied Fort Pitt. On April 6, Major General Middleton arrived at Qu’Appelle from the east with some 800 men. He set out for the north, reaching Clark’s Crossing downstream from Sask¬ atoon in mid-month. Meanwhile a force led by Colonel Otter travelled from Swift Current to Battleford, reliev¬ ing that settlement. But Otter’s men were driven off by the forces of Poundmaker in an engagement around Cutknife Hill. Middleton’s soldiers and rebel forces under Dumont clashed at Fish Creek and the Army forces were held up for several days. Then they moved on Batoche, Riel’s headquarters. The steamer Northcote was sent north from Saskatoon with armed men aboard to bring riverside fire on the rebels; this was Saskatchewan’s only naval engagement and it failed. The decisive battle of Batoche lasted three days, May 9-12, and Riel decided to surrender after his rebel forces were forced to flee from their entrenched positions. He surrendered May 15 and eight days later Poundmaker surrendered volun¬ tarily. On May 28, soldiers commanded by General Strange forced Big Bear’s men to retreat at Frenchmen’s Butte but Big Bear did not surrender until July 2, marking the final quelling of the rebellion. Subsequently, Riel was tried for treason and sentenced to death. He retracted his unorthodox religious views, was received back into the Catholic faith and was hanged November 16 outside Regina. The rebellion and his death had profound racial, religious and political consequences in eastern Canada. 1886 — The year following the Riel uprising, the territories were given the right to elect members of parliament to Ottawa. That year saw an historic crime: The Qu’Appelle- Prince Albert mail stage was held up and robbed near what is now Humboldt. 1888 — The territorial legislature was created; the 22 MLA’s to be elected .were to exercise a measure of self-govern¬ ment. The first assembly included such men (representing districts now included in the province) as Clinkskill, Mitchell, Hoey, Haultain, Neff, Plaxton, Sutherland, Davidson, Secord, Thorburn and Richardson. 1889— 90 — The Regina-Saskatoon-Prince Albert railway was built and completed. In the same period the Manitoba and Northwest Line was constructed, serving Langen- burg, Saltcoats and Yorkton. In this period Count Paul d’Esterhazy founded a Hungarian settlement, one of many such national colonies in the west. A number of Swedes, for example, settled near what is now Stock¬ holm. The next 25 years was to witness the construction of several more vital railway lines and the influx of hundreds of thousands of immigrants. 1890 — The powers of the North West Assembly were broadened to include control of most expenditures. The Catholic diocese of Prince Albert was erected with the Most Reverend Albert Pascal, OMI, the first Bishop. 1891 — Settlers founded many new communities, Rosthern, Boucher, Hague and Wakaw, to name only a few 1893 — The first secret ballots were used in a territorial by-election in the Whitewood constituency. 1897 — The year of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee saw Frederick W. G. Haultain, later knighted, become premier of the North West Territories. This spring a young Cree Indian named Almighty Voice with two companions held off for many hours more than 100 men, seeking to arrest him; six were killed near Batoche, including Almighty Voice. 1898 — A. E. Forget, clerk of the first territorial council, be¬ came the northwest’s Lieutenant-Governor. 1899 — The first DoukHobors arrived in Saskatchewan, set¬ tling around Yorkton, Kamsack, Blaine Lake and Red- berry Lake. 1902 — Premier Haultain pressed for provincial autonomy, favoring the inclusion of what is now called Saskat¬ chewan and Alberta in one province. The Saskatoon Phoenix began publishing. 9 Whatever your requirements - CONTRACTOR’S EQUIPMENT ENGINEER’S EQUIPMENT BIG MACHINERY - SMALL MACHINERY R. J. Fyfe Equipment Limited can provide Quality and Service R. J. Fyfe Equipment Limited REGINA SASKATOON 10 1903 — The Barr Colonists from England arrived in Saska¬ toon and travelled overland to Lloydminster. There Arch¬ deacon (later Bishop) G. E. Lloyd is credited with ensur- suring the colonists’s success. East of Saskatoon a group of German Americans founded St. Peter’s colony and were ministered to by priests of the Order of St. Bene¬ dict. This, too, was the era of the Saskatchewan Valley Land Company, which handled the settling of much of the unpopulated area between Saskatoon and Lumsden. Regina and Moose Jaw became cities. 1904 — Prince Albert was raised to the status of a city. The Canadian Northern that year constructed a line east to Hudson Bay Junction, serving the Melfort, Kinistino and Tisdale settlements. Prime Minister Sir Wilfred Laurier promised the west self-rule during the 1904 federal elec¬ tion. 1905 — In January, Premier Haultain journeyed to Ottawa to discuss autonomy with the re-elected Laurier govern¬ ment. At the session which opened that winter, Laurier introduced autonomy bills for the creation of the pro¬ vinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. Terms of the bills, particularly with regard to education, precipitated a nation-wide debate and the resignation from the Laurier cabinet of Sir Clifford Sifton, minister of the interior. A compromise educational clause was introduced and the autonomy bills were passed by the Commons on May 3. A. E. Forget was appointed first Lieutenant-Governor for the new province of Saskatchewan which came officially into being on September 1. The formal inaugural cere¬ monies, however, were delayed until September 4. Those attending the Regina festivities included Sir Wilfred and Earl Grey, the Governor-general. The next day, the lieutenant governor asked Walter Scott, Liberal, to form a provincial government. Scott named to his first min¬ istry Lamont, Calder and Motherwell. After a stormy campaign, the first provincial election was held in December, with the Liberals under Scott winning 16 seats and the Provincial Rights party (mainly Conservatives) winning nine ridings. That year Saskatchewan’s pioneer farmers seeded just over one million acres to wheat, which yielded an average of 23 bushels per acre, 26 million bushels in all. The average price for No. 1 Northern was 91 cents per bushel. Horses were very much in demand, naturally, and a team might cost up to $625. A stockbreeders’ association was formed in April, 1905. Sixty years ago, too, the Grand Trunk built a line through Melville, Watrous, Hanley and thence to Saska¬ toon (which was to have been bypassed at first) and on West. 1906 — The first provincial census showed the province had some 250,000 residents, 80 per cent of them rural dwel¬ lers; Indians in the province numbered only a few thou¬ sand. The settlements of Saskatoon, Nutana and River- dale were incorporated as the City of Saskatoon. Sask¬ atoon, Regina, Prince Albert and Moose Jaw had seri¬ ous typhoid epidemics. The first session of the First Legislature met in Regina on March 29. Legislation passed included a bill providing for assistance to agri¬ cultural societies, which were soon flourishing. 1906— 07 — This winter saw most Saskatchewan families suf¬ fering from a coal famine, attributable to several causes, including a prolonged strike 'at the Lethbridge mines, a strike which William Lyon MacKenzie King, future prime minister and then deputy minister of labor, suc¬ ceeded in bringing to a settlement. 1907 — Thousands of settlers from Britain, the United States, Eastern Canada and continental Europe, poured into Saskatchewan. The legislature passed an act which established the University of Saskatchewan. In October, the Hon. E. L. Wetmore, Saskatchewan chief justice, was named the university’s first chancellor. 1908— Railway construction continued at a rapid pace. The Grand Trunk line from the east and Saskatoon reached Biggar and Unity; the parallel line built by the CPR reached Wilkie and the Canadian Northern was con¬ structing a line towards the Goose Lake country. Sask¬ atchewan’s second provincial election saw 27 Liberals elected, 14 Conservatives. The University of Saskat¬ chewan’s Senate selected a Board of Governors which in August named Prof. Walter C. Murray of Dalhousie as first president of the new provincial university. There were 129 deaths attributed to the “white plague” or TB that year and 103 cases of smallpox were , reported. 1909 — On April 7 the Board of Governors chose Saskatoon as Saskatchewan’s university city. As a teaching insti¬ tution, the university opened in September; Emmanuel College moved from Prince Albert to Saskatoon and its faculty began lectures a few days ahead of the Arts and Science faculty. There were 95 deaths from typhoid re¬ ported in the province, 159 from TB. 1910 — Sir Wilfred Laurier laid the cornerstone for the university’s administration building. That year, some 27,000 homesteads were filed. More than four million acres were sown to wheat which yielded 7C million bushels. 1911 — The census showed a population of nearly 500,000 (almost doubled since 1906). Saskatchewan had 95,000 farms. Seager Wheeler was growing world championship wheat in the Rosthern district. 1912 — In the third provincial election, Walter Scott’s Lib¬ erals won 46 seats, the Conservatives only eight. Some 46,000 new immigrants entered the province. The first university buildings were opened on the U. of S. campus and the institution began its 1912-13 term “at home” for the first time. At the annual convocation, the first nine graduates received their degrees. Regina experienced a cyclone on June 30 which killed some 30 people, injured 100, left hundreds homeless and caused millions of dol¬ lars damage. 1913 — Farmers harvested 122 million bushels of wheat. 1913- 14 — North Battleford, Weyburn and Swift Current were raised to the status of cities. 1914 — The First World War began and thousands of Sask¬ atchewan residents went off to war that year and in the ensuing three years. The crop that fall averaged 12 bushels per acre. 1916 — The census showed the province had a population of 650,000. Some 300,000 had entered the province in the 10 odd years years since the province was created. Premier Scott resigned and was succeeded as head of the Liberal government by W. M. Martin. 1917 — In the fourth provincial election Premier Martin’s Liberals took 51 seats; only seven Conservatives were elected. Three Armed Services members were chosen. 1918 — The First World War ended. Saskatchewan (like the rest of the world) began to get back to the business of ordinary living. 1921 — The Liberals won the fifth provincial election, send¬ ing to the Legislature 45 members. The opposition, mostly independents, totalled 18. The census gave the ..province’s population as 757,000. There were 119,000 farms, with assets valued at one and one half billion dollars. The province’s horse population totalled over one million. 1922 — Premier Martin resigned and was succeeded as head of the government by Charles Dunning. The province’s wheat crop totalled 250 million bushels, valued at $173 million. 1924 — Harris Turner was elected leader of the opposition in the provincial legislature. Saskatchewan electors by a 39,000 majority voted out Prohibition in favor of govern¬ ment controlled beer and liquor sales. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool was organized. 1925 — Saskatchewan’s wheat crop was valued at a record $285 million. Premier Dunning’s Liberals won 51 seats in the provincial election, the Progressives six, Inde¬ pendents three and Conservatives three. In the five-year period ending in 1925, the province had known consid¬ erable prosperity; crops averaged 260 million bushels annually and it was $1 wheat much of the time. 1926 — Premier Dunning resigned and J. G. Gardiner took over as government leader. 1928 — The wheat harvest hit a record 321 million bushels; per capita income in the province averaged $578 annu¬ ally. 1929 — Following a bitter election campaign Saskatchewan voters elected 28 Liberals, 24 Conservatives, six Inde¬ pendents and five Progressives. Gardiner formed a government but his party was defeated by House vote and Dr. J. T. M. Anderson, Conservative leader, obtaining the support of the Independents and Progressives, formed “Co-operative government.” That year the Saskat¬ chewan Power Corporation came into existence. There was a partial crop failure — wheat averaged 11 bushels per acre — which came at about the same time as the great stock market crash and the beginning of the world depression. 11 Pictured here is a portion of Beaver Lumber's retail operation in Regina.

But there were some hopeful signs. Saskatchewan acquired control of public lands formerly controlled by the federal government. And hopes were high among the prairie residents for the future of Port Churchill and the Hudson’s Bay Railway. 1931 — Saskatchewan had a population of 922,000. the cen¬ sus showed, but many were to leave the province in the next few years. Half the rural population experienced drought conditions that summer and the wheat crop, averaging less than nine bushels per acre, brought only 38 cents on the average. 1932 — Wheat hit a low 32 cents on the Winnipeg market. An independent labor group and the United Farmers of Canada, Saskatchewan section, met in joint convention in Saskatoon in July and formed the Farmer-Labor party, with M. J. Coldwell chosen as leader. Delegates from the convention then journeyed to Calgary where the Co¬ operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) was formed. 1933— Grasshoppers, the continuing drought and depressed prices played further havoc with the Saskatchewan econ¬ omy; but this time the average per capita income was $135 annually, less than one-third what it was five years before. In July, the new CCF party met in Regina and adopted the Regina Manifesto, a declaration of its aims and principles. 1934 — In the provincial election, Dr. Anderson’s “Co-opera¬ tive government” was routed at the polls. Fifty Liberals under J. G. Gardiner were elected and five Farmer-Labor or CCF candidates, led by G. H. Williams. By a 30,000 majority, Saskatchewan voters favored sale of beer by the glass, with local options to follow. One third of the population lived in drought areas and grasshoppers devastated millions of acres. 1935 — The drought slackened but rust destroyed 57 mil¬ lion bushels of wheat. Relief camp strikers, mainly from B.C. and Alberta, arrived 2,000 strong in Regina on their protest “On-to-Ottawa” trek. There they were prevented from leaving the city by police, acting on the orders of the Bennett government in Ottawa. On July 1, a riot ensued when the police were arresting some of the unem¬ ployed workers’ leaders. A policeman was killed, 100 persons were injured or wounded and many were ar¬ rested: the “On-to-Ottawa” march fell through. Gardiner went to Ottawa as Minister of Agriculture; W. J. Patter¬ son became provincial premier. 1936 — Rust destroyed much of the crop which only yielded some eight bushels per acre. 1937 — The worst year of all — the drought was devastating. The wheat crop yielded little better than two bushels per acre, almost every district experienced a near-total crop failure. Some 500,000 or more than half the population was on relief and the provincial and municipal govern¬ ments were nearly bankrupt. Tax arrears were mountain- high and the provincial government found it had accu¬ mulated a cash budget deficit of $21 million; it had spent $110 million for relief purposes in eight years, of which Ottawa had paid a small part. This was undoubtedly the worst year — economically and also from a morale point of view — in the province’s history. 1938 — In the June elections, the Liberals were returned to power with 37 members. The CCF elected 11, the Social Credit two members, and the Unity party two. 1939 — Saskatchewan began to emerge from the prolonged depressed and drought-stricken period. Then came the Second World War and thousands of young men joined the armed forces. In the next few years Saskatchewan was to play host to airmen in training from many Com¬ monwealth and allied countries. 1941 — J. H. Brockelbank succeeded Major G. H. Williams as leader of the CCF opposition in the legislature. The census showed Saskatchewan had a population of 896,000. The 139,000 farms had assets valued at $896 mil¬ lion. 1944 — In the 10th province election, the CCF party led by T. C. Douglas elected 47 members and the Liberals only five. In the next few years, the new government passed hospitalization, insurance and labor legislation and entered into a number of business enterprises, bus oper¬ ations, brick-making, tanning and shoe-making, not all of which succeeded. 1945 — The Second World War ended. The provincial and municipal governments and individuals back on their feet financially and no longer held by wartime short¬ ages and restrictions, began to catch up on a tremendous backlog of building, public works improvements, neces¬ sarily accumulated over 15 years. In the next five year period, wheat production was to average 185 million bushels annually, worth $300 million each year. 1946 — Walter Tucker was chosen leader of the provincial Liberal party. 1948 — In the June provincial election, the CCF won 31 seats and the Liberals 19. One Independent-Liberal was elected and a Coalition candidate, who later joined the Liberal ranks. The long-anticipated oil and gas play be¬ gan in earnest in the province, spearheaded by some of the largest “independents” from the United States. The Saskatchewan Power Corporation launched an ambitious rural electrification program. 1950 — Farmers sowed 16 million acres to wheat, which yielded 223 million bushels, bringing in $333 million. 1951 — Another good crop matured but frost and damp weather played havoc with harvesting and caused storage and transportation difficulties. The census showed the province to have a population of nearly 832,000, half of the people living in sizeable urban areas. It was a young country, obviously for just over 50 per cent of the resi¬ dents were under 28 years of age. Fifty-five per cent of the farms were fully owned and their assets were valued at nearly two billion. The “industrial revolution” on the farm front was evident: machinery was valued at $526 million, the 300,000 horses at only $13 million. The more than one million cattle were worth some $240 million. 1952 — The foot-and-mouth outbreak around Regina elicited international attention. The CCF won the provincial elec¬ tion, sending 41 members to the house and the Liberals 11. Significant oil and gas discoveries were reported as the big “search,” in which many millions were expended, began to pay off. Saskatchewan harvested a record wheat crop of 435 million bushels. 1953 — More important oil and gas discoveries were im¬ ported. The building boom reached new highs in most areas. Another excellent crop was harvested but the fal¬ tering market and other factors saw Saskatchewan farmers unable to deliver much of their grain to the elevators. Saskatoon became the first city in the pro¬ vince to receive natural gas, piped from the Brock-Cole- ville field by the provincial power corporation and re¬ tailed by the SPC in the city. The big Smiley light oil field was discovered late in the year. Walter Tucker re¬ signed as provincial Liberal leader and successfully con¬ gested a federal seat returning to Ottawa. CCF members triumphed in most ridings in the federal election. 1954 — Saskatchewan experienced the coldest winter since 1906-07, followed by a cold, backward spring, a wet sum¬ mer and rust and hail damage. The crop marketing pic¬ ture was generally gloomy, and a sign of the times was the decision by Canadian authorities to slash the wheat export price by ten cents a bushel. The initial price, how¬ ever, stayed at $1.40. Moose Jaw was the scene of Can¬ ada’s worst air disaster when two planes collided killing 37 people. The Royal Commission on Agriculture and Rural Life brought down its long-awaited “blueprint” on farm problems. 1955 — Saskatchewan’s Golden Jubilee year: On September 1, the province began its 51st year of existence as a self- governing member of Canadian Confederation amid spe¬ cial observances all over the province. 1956 — Saskatchewan shared in the benefits of a Canada¬ wide boom, with the prairie province enjoying a bumper crop. But farmers were beset by rising costs, marketing problems and a huge backlog of unsold grain. John Diefenbaker was elected leader of Canada’s Progressive Conservative party, becoming the second national poli¬ tical chief with a Saskatchewan home-base: his in Prince Albert, while M. J. Coldwell, head of the Canadian CCF, was the veteran member for Rosetown-Biggar. 1957 — The year of the Soviet sputnik in outer space saw the political star of Saskatchewan’s John Diefenbaker soar when he formed a minority PC government after 22 years of Liberal rule. In this year Saskatchewan oil pro¬ duction doubled; and at the University of Saskatchewan postwar construction passed the $20-million mark. 1958— It was one of Saskatchewan’s dry years. Even so statistics showed the province’s residents were able to reduce consumer debt “a tremendous amount” after heavy expenditures in the mid-50’s. The mood was for some belt-tightening. Meanwhile, engineers finally started 13 Specify MADE IN SASKATCHEWAN Vitrified Clay Products \"SEVERE WEATHER QUALITY\" announcing... a new and complete line of top quality face brick in many distinctive colors \"CLAY- NATURE'S MOST ENDURING MATERIAL\" wesQlay WESTERN CLAY PRODUCTS LIMITED REGINA, SASKATCHEWAN WesBrick's colors are NEW and attractive WesBrick's are standard or modular size with a wide selection of face patterns.

It was also another election year for Can¬ ada, with Diefenbaker’s Conservatives winning the biggest majority in the nation’s history. The Tory landslide in Saskatchewan defeated such prominent parliamentarians as James G. Gardiner, former provincial premier and federal agriculture minister, and M. J. Coldwell. 1959 — Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited Saskat¬ chewan during a triumphant Royal tour. Trainloads of Saskatchewan and other prairie farmers descended on Ottawa to demand federal action on the cost-price squeeze. That fall the Saskatchewan crop was buried under early snows, and harvesting operations continued well into November. 1960 — Canada’s growth rate slackened and Saskatchewan felt the slowdown despite a good crop. But as a portend of better things to come, representatives of the Canadian Wheat Board and the Chinese Communists were dis¬ cussing possible grain sales. In provincial politics. Premier T. C. Douglas led his CCF government to re-election — winning a comfortable majority of seats on 40 percent of the popular vote. The chief issue in the heated campaign was the government’s proposed medical insurance plan. 1961 — Saskatchewan began enjoying the fruits of record- breaking wheat sales to Communist China. These sales and a short crop supply sharply reduced the once-chronic wheat surplus and boosted grain prices. Interest was in¬ creasing in Saskatchewan’s potash treasure, as the pro¬ vincial economy continued to become more diversified. Saskatoon was Canada’s third fastest-growing city; Regina exalted in new expansion plans, including a hand¬ some Regina campus for the U. of S. Meanwhile, over the objections of the medical profession, the Saskatchewan Legislature passed Canada’s first medical care insurance plan, to become effective the following July 1st. T. C. Douglas became national leader of the New Democratic Party, while Woodrow Lloyd succeeded him as provincial CCF-NDP leader and Premier. 1962 — The year of the Cuban crisis abroad and the medi¬ care crisis at home. On July 1st the medical profession withdrew normal services in a province-wide “strike” against the new medical care insurance law. The crisis eased July 23rd when the provincial government and the profession signed the Saskatoon Agreement. This led to a special legislative session and important amendments to the 1961 act. Earlier that summer the federal election saw the PC government re-elected with only a minority of MPs. But Saskatchewan voters endorsed the Diefen- baker-Hamilton policies. In Regina NDP leader T. G. Douglas was defeated. At year end Premier Lloyd said Saskatchewan could claim the title “World Potash Capi¬ tal” with the opening of the giant Esterhazy mine and with 15 other firms active in explorations. 1963 — Huge sales of prairie grain to Communist China and Soviet Russia were “the greatest stimulant” to Canada’s upsurge in growth. Besides record export sales, Saskat¬ chewan reaped a record-breaking crop. Per capita income in the province in 1963 was $2,000 — the highest in Can¬ ada. In the nation yet another federal election saw L. B. Pearson emerge as Prime Minister of a new minority government — Liberal again after six years of PC rule. But Saskatchewan elected 17 Tories — a clean sweep of the province’s federal seats. 1964 — Main event in Saskatchewan in 1964 was unques¬ tionably the change in government. In a general election on April 22, the Liberals under Ross Thatcher defeated the CCF-NDP party in one of the closest elections on the provincial record. Mr. Thatcher took office as premier on May 22. Saskatchewan farmers harvested a better- than-average crop, although the fall weather was very poor. The general economy of the province was high and business generally excellent. Economically, Saskatchewan in 1964 saw the opening of a giant chemical complex by the co-operative movement, and further growth of what promised to be a vast potash industry. 1965 — Saskatchewan’s Diamond Jubilee Year — After 60 years as a province, Saskatchewan was no longer “the poor cousin” in Confederation, but now shared in the affluence enjoyed by the older, wealthier, and more populated provinces. With a modest growth in population and with fabulous resources, Saskatchewan was confi¬ dent it could meet problems and make good use of new opportunities in the years ahead — in 1975, in 2005 and beyond.

PRAIRIE OWNED BY PRAIRIE PEOPLE / 16 SASKATCHEWAN PREMIERS THE HONORABLE WALTER SCOTT (1905-1916)— Pro¬ vincial Liberal leader and first premier of Saskatchewan, was born of Scottish parents in the Middlesex district, Ontario, in 1867, the year of Confederation. He was a suc¬ cessful printer and journalist, publishing papers in Regina and Moose Jaw. He was elected to the federal House of Commons as a Liberal M.P. for West Assiniboia in 1900 and again in 1904. In 1905 Lt. Gov. Forget called upon Mr. Scott to form this province’s first government. He was a Presbyterian. Mr. Scott retired from the leadership of the Liberal Party and as Premier of the province in 1916 be¬ cause of ill health. During Mr. Scott’s regime settlers poured in from East¬ ern Canada, from Britain, the U.S.A., Europe and Asia. During this decade of great expansion the new legislative building was erected in Regina and the University of Sask¬ atchewan opened in Saskatoon. At the end of the Scott regime in 1916 Saskatchewan was the “breadbasket of the world,” it seemed as if the good times would never end. THE HONORABLE WILLIAM MELVILLE MARTIN, B.A., was Premier from 1916 to 1922. He was born in Norwich, Ontario, August 23, 1876, and educated in Ontario and the University of Toronto. He went to the Onta.io Normal School in Hamilton and attended Osgoode Hall on a scholarship in 1902 and 1903. He held the post of Clas¬ sical Master of the Harriston High School for the years 1899 to 1901. He declined a nomination to the House of Commons for West Assiniboia in 1906 but in 1908 he was elected to the federal house as a representative of Regina and was re-elected in 1911. He resigned from the federal field to accept the premiership of Saskatchewan on the resigna¬ tion of Premier Scott. He was re-elected Premier in 1917 and remained in that capacity until 1922 at which time he was appointed a justice of the Saskatchewan Court of Ap¬ peal and also served as a federal rent controller. He was appointed Chief Justice of the Saskatchewan Court of Ap¬ peal in 1941. World War I and postwar years were prosperous years for Saskatchewan. Under the impetus of high controlled wheat price, land was broken which later experience proved might better have been left for cattle grazing. But during the Martin period of office, two small oil companies were formed, “to develop the oil fields of northern Saskat¬ chewan,” fortelling the beginning of a new era still 30 years in the future. THE HONORABLE CHARLES AVERY DUNNING (1922-1926) — Born on the 31st of July, 1885, at Croft, Leicestershire, England, he received his education in pub¬ lic schools of England and came to Canada in 1902 when a boy of seventeen, working on a farm until he was old enough to file on a homestead in Beaverdale, near York- ton, where he was joined later by his parents. Mr. Dun¬ ning was quick to make friends and he was soon caljjed upon by his fellow citizens to hold various offices. He was a director of the Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association in 1910; vice-president of the association from 1911 to 1914; organized the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company Ltd. in 1911 and was general manager of the company from that year until 1916; was appointed Royal Commissioner by the Saskatchewan government to investi¬ gate the question of agricultural credit and also the ques¬ tion of grain marketing in Europe in 1913; was a member of the Canadian Council of Agriculture, 1911 to 1916; was chairman of the Saskatchewan Committee of the Victory Loan Campaigns, 1917, 1918, 1919. He was a member of the Canada Food Board as director of food production for Canada in 1918, and was appointed provincial treasurer of Saskatchewan on the 20th of October, 1916. In 1917 he was appointed Minister of Railways and then, in May of 1918, he received the portfolio of Minister of Telephones. On the rearrangement of portfolios on Feb. 15, 1919, he became provincial treasurer and Minister of Agri¬ culture. At the time of the retirement of the Martin Cabinet Mr. Dunning held the following portfolios: Provincial Treas- surer, Provincial Secretary, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Minister in charge of the Bureau of Labour and Indus¬ tries. Upon the retirement of Premier Martin he was called upon to form a cabinet, which he did, assuming office as premier, president of the council, provincial treasurer and minister of railways on the 5th of April, 1922. These were years of recovery from the short depres¬ sions and years of relative prosperity. When the Dunning administration ended, Saskatchewan was comfortably well off, with the lowest funded debt west of the Maritimes. Mr. Dunning entered the federal field in 1926 as minis¬ ter of railways and canals and in 1929 became minister of finance, bringing down the celebrated “Dunning budget” in 1930 which was one of the hotly contested themes in the federal election that year. The Mackenzie King government was swept out of office and Mr. Dunning was defeated in Regina. He left political life to become prominent in the business world of the nation. He is still prominent in Can¬ adian business. THE HONORABLE JAMES G. GARDINER (1926-1929, 1934-1935) — On February 26, 1926, the Hon. Chas. A. Dun¬ ning, Premier of Saskatchewan since April 5, 1922, handed in his resignation to His Hpnor the Lieutenant Governor and recommended that the Hon. James G. Gardiner, Mini¬ ster of Highways, be called upon to form a cabinet. The premiership having been offered to Mr. Gardiner, he accepted the office, and the new cabinet was sworn in on the same date. Mr. Gardiner took the offices of Presi¬ dent of the Council, Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Railways. Mr. Gardiner, who represented North Qu’Appelle, was born November 30, 1883, at Farquhar, Ontario, near Exeter, the son of J. C. Gardiner and Elizabeth, both of Scottish parentage. He was educated at Thames Road Public School, Ontario; at Lincoln, Nebraska, Public School; Clearwater, Manitoba, intermediate school and the Regina Normal School and went to Manitoba College, Winnipeg. He was first elected to the Legislature at a by-election, June 25, 1914; re-elected June 26, 1917, at a general election and again in 1921 by acclamation. Upon the formation of the Dunning Ministry, April 5, 1922, he was appointed Minister of Highways and Minister in charge of the Bureau of Lab¬ our and Industries. He was re-elected without contest after assuming office, June 5, 1922. He was re-elected at a gen¬ eral election, June, 1925; called upon to form a cabinet after the resignation of Hon. Chas. A. Dunning, appointed Premier of Saskatchewan, Feb. 26, 1926. In 1928 Saskatchewan produced the “greatest Wheat crop produced in any state or province in the whole world,” according to a government spokesman of the day. In 1929 cool spring weather, drought and low prices cut crop value a hundred million dollars below the 1928 value and the great depression was begning to paralyze the world economy. The end of the first Gardiner regime was the end of the consistent myth that the western provinces would never stop prospering. Mr. Gardiner also held the Saskatchewan premiership for a short time in 1934 but moved into the federal field in 1935. Saskatchewan since its organization as a province in 1905 had consistently returned a Liberal government to power but in 1929 the Liberals under Mr. Gardiner were unable to command a clear majority and were defeated at a special session of the legislature in September, the Inde¬ pendent members who were elected voting’ with the Con¬ servatives. Mr. Gardiner led his party in opposition and for the next five years showed keen acumen in debate so that in the 1934 general election not a single Conservative was elected. Sole opposition in the 1934-39 Legislature consisted of five CCF representatives and Mr. Gardiner did not stay too long as head of the party, moving to Ottawa in 1935 as minister of agriculture, a position he held with great distinction until 1957 when the St. Laurent government was defeated. He had held the portfolio longer than any other minister in the British Commonwealth had retained one post. He was a brilliant debater, alert to shifting poli¬ tical winds, and he had a deep-rooted knowledge of the needs of western agriculture. In the 1957 general election he retained the seat for the Liberals, but was defeated in 1958. THE HONORABLE J. T. M. ANDERSON (1929-1934)— At the general election of June, 1929, the (Liberals only secured 28 seats against a combined opposition of 35 Con¬ servatives, Independents and Progressives. A Session of Legislature was called on Sept. 4, 1929, at which the Gar¬ diner administration was defeated on a vote of want of confidence. The Hon. J. G. Gardiner handed in his resig- 17 SYMBOL OF THE FINEST NAME IN CONCRETE REDI - MIX CONCRETE LTD. REGINA MOOSE JAW SASKATOON 18 nation and that of his cabinet on Sept. 9, 1929, and the Hon j T M Anderson was asked to form a Cabinet which took office on that date. Mr. Anderson took the portfolios of President of the Council and Minister of Education. Mr Anderson represented Saskatoon City in the Legis¬ lature.' He was born July 23, 1878, at Fairbank, Ontario. He was educated at Fairbank Public School in western, Ontario and attended a Toronto high school and also Mani¬ toba University. He was an educationalist and leader of the Conservative Party in Saskatchewan. He was a district governor of the Kiwanis Clubs of Western Canada in 1925, also a district commissioner of the Boy Scouts. A school inspector in Saskatchewan from 1911 to 1918 and director of education among New Canadians in Saskatchewan from 1918 to 1922. A Mason, Orangeman and Kiwanian. Author of “The Education of the New Canadian.” He was first elected to the legislature June 2, 1925; re-elected at general election of 1929, became Premier of Saskatchewan upon the defeat of the Liberal Government, Sept., 1929; re-elected by acclamation after assuming office, also Minister of Edu¬ cation. Mr. Anderson had the misfortune of leading this prov¬ ince during the first four years of the Great Depression. The Wheat Pool — one of the farmer’s bright hopes for a stable future — collapsed with thousands of other businesses the world over. Saskatchewan, with a one-crop economy was prostrate when the world price of wheat dropped far below the cost of production and shipping. The one bright spot on the horizon was that Saskatchewan gained control of her natural resources, Sept. 1, 1930. Dr. Anderson, forceful speaker and a man often too generous to his friends for his own good, campaigned in 1929 on the question of religion in schools and on the natural resources question. The first item left many scars in the province and precipitated a wild election. The years of the Anderson regime were notable for some brilliant legislative debates with the Liberals, bolstered by several former cabinet ministers who seemed to know the depart¬ ments better than some of the incumbents, showing to great advantage as the government endeavoured to fend off the crippling paralysis of the worst depression ever to hit Canada. Dr. Anderson experienced hard times after 1934, but in 1944 he was appointed acting superintendent of the School for the Deaf. THE HONORABLE W. J. PATTERSON (1935-1944)— Became Premier in 1935, following the brief second Gar¬ diner administration. Mr. Patterson was born May 13, 1886, at Grenfell, Saskatchewan, and educated there. He was an insurance and financial agent. He was first elected to the legislature at the 1921 general election. He was re-elected at general election of 1925 and on the formation of Premier Gardiner’s Cabinet, Feb. 26, 1926, was appointed Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Telephones. He was re-elected at general election of 1929; resigned with Gardiner govern¬ ment in 1929; re-elected at general election of 1934 and sworn in as Minister of Telegraphs and Telephones, July 19, 1934; in Hon. J. G. Gardiner’s Cabinet; also took the portfolios of Minister of Natural Resources and Minister in charge of the Saskatchewan Insurance Act, Fire Preven¬ tion and Prairie and Forest Fires Act. Upon the resignation of Hon. J. G. Gardiner, was chosen as leader of the Liberal party and sworn in as Premier on Nov. 1, 1935. These were the years when drifting dust obliterated the hopes and plans of a generation; when the young men of Saskatchewan “rode the rods” across the whole Dom¬ inion in search of work: when whole families from the dried out areas made pitiful treks, possessions piled on hayracks, in search of new land to the north. When prosperity did come at the end of the decade, the youth of the province, nurtured in depression, were being matured in war. Mr. Patterson was premier until July, 1944, when the Liberal administration was defeated, although he himself was re-elected in Cannington constituency. He was suc¬ cessful again in the 1948 general election but he resigned in April, 1949, to accept a commissioner’s post with the Board of Transport Commissioners. However, Mr. Patter¬ son’s real interests lay in Saskatchewan and on July 4, 1951, he was sworn in as lieutenant-governor of Saskatche¬ wan. He was the first Saskatchewan-born man to become premier of the province for which he worked to indefatig- ably for so many years.

C. DOUGLAS (1944-1961)— Thomas Clement Douglas was born in Falkirk, Scotland, on Oct. 20, 1904, and was premier of Saskatchewan from July, 1944, until November, 1961, by far the longest period one man has held the premiership. In 1961 Mr. Douglas left the provincial field to enter federal politics and he now repre¬ sents the British Columbia seat of Burnaby-Coquitlam. During Mr. Douglas’ leadership, Saskatchewan made mat¬ erial progress, developing from a straight agricultural econ¬ omy to a fairly broad base of agriculture, oil and minerals. Industry was still lacking but even ir. this field some pro¬ gress was made. He was first elected to the House of Com¬ mons in 1935 in Weyburn riding, being re-elected in 1940. He became head of the CCF in Saskatchewan and led thad party to victory in five elections between 1944-1960, acting as premier and holding various portfolios, chief of which was that of minister of health. Under his leadership the province instituted its hospitalization plan and he an¬ nounced during the 1960 general election the skeleton plans for medicare, but he left the province to take over the leadership of the newly formed N.D.P. in 1961. He is a brilliant orator and clever debater and his interests have always been closely aligned with those of the “small man.” He was a Baptist minister prior to entering politics, having graduated from Brandon College and McMaster University. THE HONORABLE WOODROW STANLEY LLOYD. Mr. Lloyd, member of the Legislature from 1944, became premier of Saskatchewan on Nov. 7, 1961, and remained as leader until the defeat of the CCF on April 22, 1964. He in¬ herited the medicare problem when he became premier and won widespread recognition as a skilful administrator when he declined to be stampeded during the hectic medicare campaign in 1962. At the time of his entry into provincial politics, when he was a school teacher, Mr. Lloyd was re¬ garded in many circles as a somewhat extreme leftist, but his views mellowed and he was quoted as saying not too long ago: “Practical experience and changing economic conditions have proved wrong many of the techniques of 1944 socialism.” Whatever the future holds, Mr. Lloyd’s brief tenure of office will be memorable for the institution in Saskatchewan of the first medicare plan in North America. Mr. Lloyd was born in Webb, Sask., on July 16, 1913, and was the second Saskatchewan-born man to be¬ come premier of his native province. A sound thinker, and convincing speaker, Mr. Lloyd was often alleged to en¬ counter difficulty in “selling” himself to the public, but he has been acknowledged to be a good administrator and much of his political history remains to be written. With a fairly numerous backing in the 1965 legislature he is cer¬ tain to remain a force in Saskatchewan politics. THE HONORABLE W. ROSS THATCHER became premier of Saskatchewan on May 22, 1964, exactly one month after his Liberal party defeated the CCF-NDP ad¬ ministration. Mr. Thatcher, after serving as an alderman in Moose Jaw, was first elected to the House of Commons in 1945 and was re-elected in 1949 and 1953, on all occasions as a CCF supporter. But he became disillusioned with the CCF and in 1955 joined the Liberals and was chosen as Liberal leader in Saskatchewan in 1959 and won a seat in the Legislature in 1960 in Morse constituency. Immediately upon being named Liberal leader, Mr. Thatcher levelled his guns against CCF socialism and in 1964 campaigned on the platform “Time for a Change” and against the creeping paralysis of socialism. He opposed all forms of compulsion, promised to reduce taxes and spread the word that free enterprise would receive every encouragement. He suc¬ ceeded in electing 32 members against 25 for the CCF and one for the Tories and his first few months in office were used to eliminate ‘bureaucracy’ and to initiate policies de¬ signed to forward the advance of free enterprise. Some of the changes he made did not win universal favor but it was generally accepted that he was carrying out the bitter policies in the first months and that the sweeteners would come along in due course. At any rate, Saskatchewan’s economy was booming in late 1964 and indications point to more of the same in 1965. Mr. Thatcher was born at Neville, Sask., in 1917, and graduated from Queen’s University with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He engaged in the hardware business and was successful in this as in the ranching enterprises which he undertook.

The occasion is Saskatchewan’s 60th anniversary as a part of the Confederation of Canada. Two years ago the wheels were set in motion to formu¬ late plans to mark the Diamond Jubilee and contribute to the national celebrations for Canada’s Centennial in 1967. Saskatchewan’s attentions are naturally focussed to the 1965 celebrations. But the more than 100 projects which will be initiated throughout the year will provide a firm founda¬ tion for the province’s contribution to the Centennial cele¬ brations in 1967. To engineer the three years of celebration, the provin¬ cial government established the Saskatchewan Diamond Jubilee and Canada Centennial Corporation to plan, de¬ velop and implement projects for the twin celebrations. To achieve the greatest participation the Jubilee and Centennial Corporation organized committees on a local level throughout the province. More than 550 committees have been organized to en¬ gineer local Jubilee activities and to assist the Corporation in implementing its numerous province-wide projects. “Local committees are a vital cog in the machinery which will contribute to significant Diamond Jubilee cele¬ bration in this province,” said Will Klein, Executive Director of the Corporation. “It is extremely encouraging to have received this unlimited co-operation from the rural and urban centres in the province,” he said. Local committees are involved with three areas of responsibility with respect to the overall program during the next three years. — they must organize local festivities for each of the celebration years, 1965 and 1967; — they are urged to assist the Jubilee and Centennial Corporation in implementing wherever possible, province-wide programs on a local level; . — they should assist their municipal council in the selection of a project under the Federal-Provincial Centennial Grants Program. All 11 cities in the province have established local com¬ mittees Close to 100 percent organization has been at¬ tained with the 120 Saskatchewan towns and about 85 percent of Saskatchewan’s 296 rural municipalities have local committees to plan Jubilee and Centennial celebra¬ tions. Last fall the Corporation held 10 regional conferences throughout the province to explain the role of local com¬ mittees for the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. This spring, 55 area workshops were held in the northern and southern regions of the province as a tune-up before final plans were prepared for the local festivities this spring and summer. Year-long Jubilee celebrations were successfully in¬ augurated with two major functions in Regina on the week¬ end of January 30-31 of this year. A two-hour ceremony on Sunday, January 31, in the Regina Armory attracted more than 2,000 persons from all parts of the province. Governor-General Georges P. Vanier was the major speaker at the Sunday “Province Day” cere¬ mony. In his speech, the Governor-General suggested that Can¬ adian unity could best be obtained through mutual under¬ standing. Referring to the present era, he said: “This is the time to know one another, to understand one another — not tomorrow. Tomorrow we may regret that we did not get together when the tide was rising and the tempers serene.” Last December, the Corporation’s Executive Committee approved the recommendation of a six-member judging committee with respect to a Diamond Jubilee flag for the year-long celebrations. The design selected, was submitted by Sister Imelda of St. Angela’s Convent at Prelate, north¬ west of Swift Current. The flag illustrates a stem of wheat on the left side and the Saskatchewan coat of arms in the upper right corner on a field of red and green. Chairman of the flag judging committee was former Saskatchewan Lieutenant-Governor W. J. Patterson. It was officially unveiled at the opening ceremonies in January. Contributing to the success of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations are more than 100 Saskatchewan daily and weekly newspapers. The provincial press indicated a wil¬ lingness to carry a series of 35 illustrated biographical sketches on men and women who contributed to the devel¬ opment of Saskatchewan during and before its first 60 years. The series entitled “The Saskatchewanians” has proven to be a popular feature with both young and old. The series will be continued in 1966 and 1967. The Jubilee and Centennial Corporation plan to re-pro¬ duce the series in booklet form. A 28-minute color film on Saskatchewan, featuring the development of the province and its people, will be released this summer. The film is being produced by Crawley Films of Ottawa, who also produced a film for Saskatchewan’s Golden Jubillee in 1955. A commemorative Jubilee coin was distributed by local committees throughout the province earlier this year. More than 300,000 souvenir coins were manufactured and distri¬ buted through the province and Canada as well as to many points in the United States and Europe. Saskatchewan pioneer couples, married for 60 years or more this year, receive from the Corporation a specially- mounted scroll honoring their contribution to Saskat¬ chewan’s development. The names of 250 couples were submitted to the Jubilee and Centennial Corporation fol¬ lowing a request that names of pioneer couples be for¬ warded to the Regina office. Extensive use of the Corporation symbol, is being used by Saskatchewan business firms on postage “meter ads.” The Diamond Jubilee has been a popular theme for a number of conventions, meetings, carnivals, bonspiels, and sports days throughout the province. Organizations and communities are utilising the Corporation symbol and the 60th anniversary theme for a number of special events in their local areas. The first in a series of long-playing record albums produced by the Corporation through Lumby Productions of Saskatoon entitled “Saskatchewan Jubilee — The Young Sound” was recently released in the province. It is the first in a series of four albums which will be produced during the next three years as part of the twin celebrations. The record features Saskatchewan youth groups. The Jubilee and Centennial Corporation earlier this year issued the first of six publications its plans to produce dur¬ ing the next three years. Entitled “Saskatchewan,” the 32- page full-color magazine featured informative articles and full-color illustrations dealing with various aspects of life and development in the province. The second issue will be released this fall. Four competitions, directed to musicians and writers in the province, were held during the first part of Jubilee year. A literary competition was divided into three cate¬ gories dealing with short stories, poems and plays. A $1,000 award was presented to a Saskatchewan musician to parti¬ cipate in an overseas music competition this year. A com¬ petition was also held for Saskatchewan music composers and music groups. A series of seven radio and eight television programs were produced by School Broadcasts Branch of the Depart¬ ment of Education. The broadcasts dealt with Saskat¬ chewan history and were shown to students in grades five to nine. A one-hour telecast was held last month (May) dur¬ ing which time all Saskatchewan students participated in a special salute to Saskatchewan’s Jubilee. Numerous national and regional sales meetings and con¬ ventions will be held in Saskatchewan this year as a result of an appeal by the Corporation to Eastern and Western 24 Canadian head offices. Last fall the Corporation sponsored several business luncheons for Saskatchewan district man¬ agers of national firms and urged them to invite their head office to consider Saskatchewan as the location for any meetings or conventions in 1965. In the area of sports, two startling achievements have already transpired, both of which were stimulated by the province’s celebration year. A Regina brewery (Molson’s Regina Limited) announced plans to investigate the establishment of a Sports Hall of Fame in Saskatchewan. Nominees to the Hall of Fame will be chosen by a committee composed of representatives of major provincial sports organizations. The Jubilee and Centennial Corporation also announced approval of a $15,000 expenditure for the construction of an indoor portable track for use by major centres in the province during the fall and winter months. The track will be completed later this fall and will be only the fourth of its kind in Canada. A Diamond Jubilee invitational track and field meet is slated for Saskatoon or Regina this win¬ ter, to inaugurate its use. As well, a number of national sports events were at¬ tracted to Saskatchewan this year. For the third time in the history of the Canadian Curling Championship, Saskat¬ chewan hosted the Macdonald Brier and established a new record attendance, 52,139, during the week-long event in Saskatoon. The last time the championship was held in Saskatchewan was in 1955, during the Golden Jubilee. Other sports events include the Dominion Weight Lifting Competition, Western Canada Fencing Championships and the Dominion Gymnastic Competitions which will be held in Saskatoon in July. One of the most ambitious projects undertaken by the Jubilee and Centennial Corporation is its Vacation Trails project which will be developed during the next three years. Purpose of this program is to provide well-marked routes inviting tourists and residents of the province to visit the many historical and recreational attractions in Saskat¬ chewan. Two Vacation Trails will be opened this summer and another nine wiil be developed during the next two years. Tc be opened this year will be the Cannington- Souris Trail in southeastern Saskatchewan and the Battle- fords-Meadow Lake-Lloydminster Trail in the northwestern part of the province. As another means of kindling the already increasing tourist trade in the province, the Jubilee and Centennial Corporation co-operated with many of the province’s paper product firms and advertising specialty concerns in striking a Jubilee theme in the production of numerous souvenirs and consumer products. As well, the Corporation has produced and distributed more than 250,000 lapel pins, automobile window stickers and store window decals publicizing the province and the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. The 1965 Saskatchewan vehicle licence plates also bear a “Diamond Jubilee” legend. A gift of $60,000 will be presented by Saskatchewan this year to a food processing, packaging and storage centre in Mysore, India, as “a birthday gift in reverse” to mark the province’s 60th birthday. The gift will be forward by the province through the United Nations Freedom from Hunger Campaign. The funds will provide equipment, qualified teachers and support students at the training centre in India. The centre trains students to preserve and distribute food to the hungry in under-developed countries. One of the major special events being conducted by the Corporation this year will be the Anniversary Day cere¬ mony to be held at the Legislative Building in Regina, Sept. 6. The date will officially mark Saskatchewan’s 60th anni¬ versary as a member of Confederation. Special ceremonies on Labour Day will involve many Canadian dignitaries and will pay tribute to the former Saskatchewan legislators. Canadian-born actor and television star, Lome Greene, the Stars Festivals which will be staged in Saskatoon and will be the feature entertainer at the two Gala Night Under Regina, June 11-12. The shows are produced by Scott Peters, a former Saskatchewan resident, who was invited back to the province by the Jubilee and Centennial Cor¬ poration to highlight the summer activity in the province. Saskatchewan talent for the shows was selected through a series of auditions earlier this year. A “Saskatchewan Diamond Jubilee Star” will be selected following the two performances and will receive a trip to Hollywood, Calif., and an appearance on the television series Bonanza. The runner-up will receive a trip for two to Diamond Head, Hawaii. Another award will be made to a Saskatchewan performer enabling he or she to attend the Pasadena Play¬ house summer course, a training session directed to the advancement of an individual in the performing arts. The Saskatchewan Jubilee and Centennial Corporation was established by a Provincial Act in 1962 to promote the observance of Saskatchewan’s Diamond Jubilee this year and to plan the province’s celebrations for the Centennial of Confederation in 1967. Project plans for these two celebrations are funnelled through a 50-member General Committee, 14 Sub-Commit¬ tees, a 12-member Executive Committee and a 16-member staff located in Regina. The General Committee was selected by the Lieutenant- Governor in council and its members represent a cross- section of Saskatchewan interests and organizations.. This committee meets twice a year, considers and recommends programs for the two celebrations, but does not exercise any policy or program decisions. Chairmen of the Corpora¬ tion’s sub-committees form part of the General Committee membership. The Executive Committee meets monthly. Saskatchewan’s Golden Jubilee provided the basis for the Sub-Committee structure in planning for Saskat¬ chewan’s Diamond Jubilee this year. These sub-committees serve as advisory groups with respect to program plans which will be undertaken by the Corporation during the two celebration years. It was the responsibility of each sub-committee, last year, to submit an effective and inclu¬ sive program of events. Sub-Committees include Historic Sites and Publications with Allan R. Turner of Regina, chairman; Creative Acti¬ vities with Dr. Carlyle King of Saskatoon, chairman; Tourist Promotion, C. I. McIntosh, from North Battleford, chair¬ man; Exhibitions, T. H. McLeod, Regina, chairman; Saskat¬ chewan Film, with T. L. Hill, Regina, chairman; Indian Par¬ ticipation, John Tootoosis of Cut Knife, chairman; Sports Activities, C. R. Bligh and John M. Wilkie of Regina, serv¬ ing as co-chairmen; Publicity, Alex Cameron of Regina, chairman; Community Activities, L. S. Nicks of Grand Coulee, chairman; Inter-Faith Activities, The Very Reverend William Sewell as chairman; Special Events, Judge Mary Batten of Saskatoon, chairman and People-to-People Pro¬ ject with Mrs. R. H. Milliken of Regina, the chairman. Functioning as a committee within the Corporation is the Youth Activities Sub-Committee. Following the establishment of the Jubilee and Centen¬ nial Corporation, Moose Jaw businessman, J. W. McCaig, was appointed chairman of the Crown Corporation in Janu¬ ary of 1963. Executive Director of the Corporation is 33-year-old Will Klein, who, for 10 years, was associated with the com¬ munications media in the province. The 12-member Executive Committee was selected through appointment by the Provincial Government and the General Committee. Members include: Hon. J. W. Gar¬ diner, Public Works Minister and Vice-Chairman of the Corporation; Hon. G. B. Grant, Minister of Highways and Industry and Economic Development; J. W. McCaig; A. P. Gleave, Saskatchewan Farmers Union; Judge Mary Batten, Saskatoon; T. H. McLeod, manager, Regina Exhibition Association; Jack Hamilton, Immediate Past President, Sask¬ atchewan Association of Rural Municipalities; Mrs. T. Jane- son, Saskatchewan Co-operative Women’s Guild; C. I. Mc¬ Intosh, North Battleford, managing Editor, North Battleford News-Optimist; J. D. Connor, Executive Secretary, Saskat¬ chewan Urban Municipalities Association; Allan R. Turner, Provincial Archivist and David Dombowsky, Administrative Assistant, Treasury Department, Provincial Government. The Executive Committee is the decision and policy mak¬ ing body of the Corporation. It handles the approval of projects for the twin celebrations and reviews applications under the Federal-Provincial Centennial Grants Program, a joint cost-sharing program for the construction of pro¬ jects to commemorate the Centennial of Confederation. Jubilee business is everyone’s business in 1965. It is hoped that a maximum residual value will be attained from the many Jubilee projects within the pro¬ vince following the year-long festivities. It is also hoped that the activity generated this year will provide a solid foundation on which can be built the contribution of Sask¬ atchewan in celebrating Canada’s Centennial in 1967. 25 Self-Help Finance in Action More than 220,000 rural and urban people have built Saskatchewan's credit unions to serve their financial needs. From a humble beginning in 1937, credit unions have expanded to serve the saving, borrowing and other financial needs of groups in cities, towns and villages and in industry. Farmers, workers and professional people of all ages, nationalities, religions and political beliefs work together in this practical way. Result? Combined savings of the ever-growing membership of the province's 295 credit unions have passed $230,000,000. This money stays at home to benefit Saskatch¬ ewan people.

Canadians are rightly concerned that a major portion of their manufacturing capacity and natural resources are owned by foreign investors — a larger proportion than for any other developed country in the world. At the other end of the scale, co-operative busi¬ ness — whether retail, refining, manufacturing, farm marketing, insurance or finance — is owned and con¬ trolled by the people it serves. All benefits go to them and their communities. An important reason for co-operative and credit union growth in Saskatchewan has been the combi¬ nation of local ownership and centralized financial strength. The Saskatchewan Co-operative Credit Society mobilizes credit union and co-op dollars to provide the capital funds needed for progress.

MCDONALD, Minister of Agriculture AGRICULTURAL land remains Saskatchewan’s most im¬ portant source of wealth, in spite of great strides in mineral and industrial development in the last decade. Net value of agricultural production during the last ten years has averaged slightly less than fifty percent of the total value of provincial production. Saskatchewan has the largest agricultural area of any Canadian province and is one of the richest farming areas of the world. In the last ten years, Saskatchewan’s wheat crop averaged 285 million bushels — more than half of all the wheat produced in Canada. Although grain production is still king, livestock pro¬ duction is expanding, adding stability to farm income. In 1963, Saskatchewan’s cattle population was 2,300,000 — an all time high and one of the. largest in Canada. In addition there were 505,000 swine, 6,050,000 poultry, 705,000 tur¬ keys and 165,000 sheep in the province. Gross farm income from livestock and livestock products is about 28 percen"
