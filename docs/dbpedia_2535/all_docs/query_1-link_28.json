        "text": "Remembered for your contributions to the broadcasting industry\n\nGary Russell (Norm Vidler), 67, in White Rock, BC. His 41-year broadcast career began at CKYFM Winnipeg, then owned by Moffat Communications, as an operator/booth announcer. He grew at Moffat into programming and management responsibilities. Later, he joined Standard Broadcasting in Vancouver and, when Astral Media purchased Standard in 2007, Russell became VP/GM of Astral’s 95 Crave (CKZZ) and CISL. Late in 2007, he announced that his retirement would take effect Feb. 1, 2008. In 2008, he was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcasting’s Hall of Fame. During his broadcast career, Russell also served on the boards of BBM, the British Columbia Association of Broadcasters, the National Advertising Benevolent Society, ABS West, Music BC and on the British Columbia Institute of Technology’s advisory council. His post-radio days included being vice-chair of the City of White Rock Cultural Committee. Gary Russell was the brother of two other accomplished broadcasters, Jeff Vidler and Chuck McCoy.\n\nPaul Dorazio, 74, in Edmonton. Known on-air as Paul Revere, he was a programmer and a rock jock at such far flung locales as St. John’s, NL, Hamilton, Thunder Bay and at CKRM Regina. He was a jock at the old CFGM-AM Toronto, then a powerhouse of country music and located above a Richmond Hill drug store. He rocked at CKPR-AM Thunder Bay in the early ‘70s. Revere owned 10-thousand 45 RPMs and five-thousand LPs. As he delved into the musical past he’d say, “I’ll bring back memories you never thought you had”. Revere had also been active in Regina community radio.\n\nBrian Sawyer, a month short of his 76th birthday, in Montreal. Known on the broadcast technical side countrywide, Sawyer‘s career began in 1962 at Maple Leaf Broadcasting, then the owner of CHML-AM and CHCH-TV Hamilton.

The early-days DJ at CHOM FM and, later at Mix 96 in Montreal, introduced listeners to the likes of Van Morrison, Boz Scaggs and Jackson Browne. Mackay was part of the re-invention of FM, taking the frequency from Classical music programming to Rock. He was doing CHOM afternoons when the station was taken over by FLQ extremists who insisted on broadcasting their demands. He and other staffers allowed the takeover. After a few minutes of airing their grievances, they got distracted and started playing music. Said Mackay, “It was just amusing to see the whole disintegration of their political agenda and how it evolved into a teen beat dance party”.\n\nJohn Harvard, 77, in Winnipeg. The Liberal MP served 16 years in Parliament from 1988-2004, and was Manitoba’s 23rd lieutenant governor from 2004-2009. He was a broadcast journalist from 1957 to 1988, working at CBC for 18 years and as the host of CJOB Winnipeg’s Talk Back.
