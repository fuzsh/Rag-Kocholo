We send to our subscribers to-day the February number of our “ Railway Earnings” Section. In this publication we give the figures of earnings and ex­ penses for the latest month of every operating steam railroad in the United States required to file monthly returns with the Inter-State Commerce Commission at Washington. This Earnings Supplement also contains the com­ panies own statements where these differ from the Commerce returns or give fixed charges in addition to earnings, or where they have a fiscal year different from the June 30 year, as is the case with the New York Central Lines, the Pennsylvania R R . and others. ^ THE FINANCIAL SITUATION. [ V o l . X C V I. The employees never fail to vote in favor of a strike. The percentage of those favoring the strike is always high in the nineties. In the present instance it varied on the different lines from 92.07 to 100. The men could do nothing else but declare in favor of a strike, as the vote is meant to strengthen the hands of the labor leaders. It is not really a strike vote at all. If it were a case where all negotiations had been definitely and finally concluded, and there was no likelihood of their again being resumed, and the question presented for the consideration of the men was, whether to go on strike and run the risk of losing their jobs, or abandoning their demands altogether, the outcome, we imagine, would be quite different. There would then be no ninety per cent, registered in favor of quitting work. As it is, these strike votes possess no significance whatever as an indication of the feeling of the men on a strike per se. After the vote the labor leaders are expected to take up the matter again with the railroads, but with the additional advantage of being able to say that there will surely be a strike in the event that no basis of agreement can be arrived at. In other words, ihe strike vote is simply an added club to force con­ cessions from the railroads. 1 I he railroads in the territory between Chicago and the seaboard, north of the Ohio River, and with them the entire business world, are again confronted with the possibility of a great strike, crippling the roads in their daily operations, and incidentally paralyzing the country’s industrial activities to a larger or smaller extent. These threats of a strike, by one class of railroad employees after another, are getting to be such a common occurrence and ar proving In the present instance, both sides have been will­ so disturbing to the whole community, that the time ing to submit the questions at issue to arbitration, seems to have arrived for determining whether some but the firemen have insisted on a small arbitration effective remedy is not available for dealing with the board, composed of only three men, while the rail­ matter so as to avoid constantly recurring troubles roads have demanded a board of the size of that which of that kind.

With a board of three only, the deciding increased pay. The present year it is the locomotive vote is in the hands of the one man selected by the iremen and enginemen that are demanding increased other two, and the railroad managers claim there is pay and threatening, as the only alternative, the too much at stake to let the issue be determined by usual dire consequences— a strike on the whole fifty- a single individual.

The alternative we have in mind is for the Depart­ ment of Justice to proceed against labor combinations just as it has been legally proceeding against other combinations. We hardly expect the suggestion to be acted upon, because of the influential character of the labor vote at political elections; but labor com­ binations in preventing competition in the price of labor are as truly a violation of the Anti-Trust Law, as construed by the U. S. Supreme Court, as any of the combinations that have been legally condemned by that judicial tribunal. It is quite possible that some day we will have a fearless Attorney-General, indifferent as to the political consequences of his acts, who will enforce the Anti-Trust Law as against railway labor organizations that seek to hold the railroads, the whole community and the trade and commerce of the entire continent in subjection to are doing what is forbidden by law and what our highest Court has over and over again, particularly during the last two years, condemned. We believe that railway managers in dealing with such violators of the law are themselves transgressing the law and we also believe that the presiding Judge of the Com­ merce Court and the Commissioner of Labor are winking at a violation of the law when they help the labor organizations to attain their purpose through such illegal means. The Anti-Trust Law in the economic policy that it enforces has become such an established feature, it is time every one were made acquainted with its binding character. And if it were enforced as against labor unions it is possible that the country might achieve real indus trial freedom of the kind President-elect Wilson delights so much in talking about. their will. We are well aware that there are certain advan­ tages to the carriers in having a common organization of labor employees to deal with, but the policy of the law is against combinations of all kinds and employees are as surely amenable to the provisions of the law as any other class of citizens. Woodrow Wilson was expressly elected President on a platform of princi­ ples declaring in favor of the restoration of competi­ tion and of freedom in commerce and trade. We wonder whether President W . S. Carter of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Engineers, when he spoke of a “ move on the part of the people that own the railroads to put fear into Woodrow Wilson’s heart,” had in mind this vulnerable position of labor organizations as offenders against the Anti­ Trust Law, and the possibility that the new AttorneyGeneral may not yield to the dictates of labor lead­ ers, but take action against labor combinations with the view to breaking them up. As already stated, the policy of the law is against combinations and against price agreements of every kind. Whether we like it or not, this is a law that every one must obey. In the enforcement of this law the Supreme Court has insisted that offending com­ binations must be resolved into units. Suppose this policy and this rule were applied in the case of railway labor organizations? Would not the result be highly beneficial, and would not the public be an immense gainer? In such an event each railroad would have only its own employees to deal with. The labor units would be the separate bodies of employees of the different roads. With the labor organizations re­ solved into units in that way, and each railroad obliged to consider only the situation on its own particular road, each road would decide the question in accordance with its own circumstances. Some might deem it possible to make wage advances and others not. There could then be no general strike and no paralysis of the whole transportation activities of an entire section of the country. For ourselves we cannot see why each particular road should not decide the question according to its own circumstances, entirely irrespective of what its neighbors or rivals may do. But at all events, that is the policy and the theory of the law to which we must all conform. The labor leaders when they get into a high dudgeon because they cannot have their own way, should remember that in undertaking to fix a common price for labor and seeking to force that price upon the employers of labor, they are interfering with competition in the price of labor, While the most troublous orator of the times was repeating, on the anniversary of the birth of Lincoln, his misrepresentation of Lincoln as having been the pioneer advocate of the recall of judicial decisions, President Taft was using the memories of the day in a loftier and juster manner which we may well pause a moment to join. With some touch of sadness, Mr. Taft said he had himself had, of late, somewhat of Lincoln’s own feeling in the White House, for he also has had his “ dark days,” and his successor will will surely have some, a foreboding to which the present outlook upon our Southwestern borders gives emphasis. We have had a licking, said M r. Taft, but sometimes a licking does us good, for the per­ manence of the Republican Party depends upon a democratic, representative government. Here he spoke as a party man and a party leader, although in present defeat, but then he rose above that to say what ought to be remembered: “ We are a great, strong people, and we can stand a great deal and the lesson may have a healthy effect. It may be that those who left us will come back to the sound Constitutional principles of gov­ ernment and the sound view of economic policies. “ We ought to make a declaration with reference to the basic principles that we cannot surrender, and I refer to those Constitutional principles, the institu­ tions of liberty regulated by law, the Constitutional self-restraints imposed by a great intelligent people upon themselves, in order that government shall not yield and be overcome by the momentary passion of the mob. These principles we cannot depart from, and those who insist on tearing down the Constitu­ tion and destroying these institutions that represent self-restraint are permanently out of the Republican Party.” Mr. Taft passes from office becomingly and with an unimpaired title to the respect of his countrymen. But more than any one man, and immeasurably larger than the personal ambitions for power by any one man, are the Constitutional principles which represent and embody self-restraint. The restless­ ness which easily is led to assume that inequalities in worldly position are due to injustices in practice has been adroitly played upon by clever adventurers with the lust for power until “ the passion of the mob” is the loudest and therefore, temporarily, the dominant force. It is not an organized mob, gath­ ered visibly in one place with torch and shout; but its clamor is not less unreasoning and unreflecting, its fury against existing institutions is not the less, and its desire to do something quickly and to tear 440 THE CHRONICLE [ V o l .

The yield for January 1913, as cabled, is 789,390 fine ounces, a daily average of 25,464 fine ounces and an increase of 419 fine ounces over the per diem output of December 1912. A year ago (in January 1912) the daily average was 23,776 fine ounces, in 1911 it was 21,001 fine ounces and in 1910 but 19,399 fine ounces. There is nothing to be said about this latest return of gold production in the Transvaal except that it marks a continuance of the progressive expansion in the yield of the mines that has so long been a feature of the monthly reports. The gain of a little more than 7 % recorded by January 1913 over 1912, if maintained during the succeeding months, would give for the full year a production close to 10 million fine ounces from this, the premier gold field of the world. Latest advices indicate a favorable labor situation in the mines, holding out promise of even further development. The cotton-manufacturing establishments at Fall River, judging of conditions by the dividends de­ clared since the opening of the new year, have of late done better for the shareholders, notwithstanding the hampering effect of a somewhat serious shortage of operatives and the inefficiency or lack of energy of many of those at work. At the same time the situ­ ation is, all in all, less satisfactory than in most recent periods. For upwards of a year now curtail­ ment of production, to a greater or lesser extent from week to week, has been forced by the inability to secure an adequate labor force and the problem of fully manning the machinery of the mills is still un­ solved. Moreover, many skilled operatives in the mill^fail to turn out as much work as they might. They are satisfied with the money they can make without much exertion and are reluctant to work hard. I hey are without fear of discharge for loafing, as their places would be hard to fill. This, of course, 8508,400, or 1.90% . During each of the three years, 1907 to 1909 inclusive, the first quarter’s distribution was in excess of 2 % , but in 1905 it was only 0.32% and in 1898 was 0 .26 % . The commercial failures exhibit for the month of January 1913, while a little more favorable than that for the corresponding period a year ago so far as number of insolvents is concerned, covers a notice­ ably larger volume of liabilities than then. This seemingly anomalous situation is explained, however, by the exceptional size of some of the disasters, twenty-eight failures, or a very small percentage of the total, comprising in the aggregate liabilities of over iy 2 million dollars, or almost one-third of the whole amount. Consequently the defaults for less than 8100,000 were not only smaller in number than last year but showed a slight reduction in combined liabilities. Compared with either 1911 or 1910 this year’s January indebtedness exhibits a more or less pronounced falling off. Of the large failures referred to no less than 18 for 85,322,634 were in the manu­ facturing division and 8 for 81,398,391 among traders. Messrs. It. G. Dun & Co.’s compilation of com­ mercial disasters for the month of January 1913, which is the basis for our remarks, shows that during the period mentioned there were 1,814 failures in all, with indebtedness of 822,972,969, against 1,897 for 819,770,530 in 1912 and 1,663 for 824,090,649 in 1911. The manufacturing division made the least satisfactory record in this latest month. Both num­ ber and liabilities were much in excess of 1912, the comparison being between 395 for 88,762,357 and 374 for 85,804,353. Furthermore, the January in­ debtedness was the heaviest for very many years, excepting only 1911 and 1908. The poor showing of the month did not extend to all the various branches of which this division is made, but liabilities in ma­ chinery and tools jumped about a quarter of a mil­ lion dollars last year to over Vyi millions this year, miscellaneous lines, classed as “ all other,” more than doubled their debts and printing and engraving made a somewhat similar exhibit. In the trading group seven of the 15 various branches had debts greater than last year, but generally not much in 441 THE CHRONICLE Fe b . 15 1513.] e x c e s s , a n d in s u c h lin e s a s h o t e ls a n d r e s t a u r a n t s , p r e p a r a t io n s h a v e a ls o b e e n m a d e f o r p r o m p t a c t io n d ry s h o u ld t h e n e c e s s it y b e c o n s id e r e d s u ffic ie n t ly a c u t e goods and ca rp ets, je w e lr y and c lo c k s and m is c e lla n e o u s th e s h o w in g w a s d is t in c t ly b e t t e r t h a n to fo r t h e r e fo r e , n o w m a in t a in in g a w a it in g a t t it u d e . 1912 or 1911.

T o understand the existing situation, some recent events must be reviewed. In the early months of 1910, signs were multiplying that the regime of old President Diaz was losing its hold. The President himself was apparently succumbing to advanced age; eighty years old, and apparently in feeble health, he was surrounded by a group of advisers who were little else than political intriguers. No one had a clear and distinct idea as to whom he would name as his successor, or whether the people and the rival politicians would assent to such a choice. It was then, in June of 1910, that Francisco Madero, a man then not forty years of age, and with somewhat advanced ideas on the possibilities of popular government in Mexico, stood against old President Diaz in the Presidential election, and was defeated. Some of his methods during that campaign were made a pretext for imprisoning him, after the elec­ tion, on the charge of sedition. He escaped in October of that year to Texas; whence, in November, he re-entered Mexico, making terms with the tur­ bulent military and political leaders of the north. Among others whose support he secured, on the basis partly of their desire for any sort of change, and partly doubtless of their hope for plunder, were two notorious guerilla chieftains, Orozco and Villa; with them came Gomez, the civil governor of the Province of Chihuahua. Active campaigning against the Diaz government followed. The defections from the aged President increased, the campaign was fought with hesitation on his side, and in May of 1911, when Madero had captured the important city of Juarez, the old dictator of Mexico fled from the capital and embarked for Europe. In June of that same year, Madero entered Mexico City with the enthusiastic plaudits of the people. In accordance with his avowed purpose, the Presi­ dency was then submitted to a popular election. As a candidate, Madero stood against Reyes and Gomez, and the result was an overwhelming Maderist majority— largely based, without question, on the hopes of the restless politicians and military men as to what they had to gain under the new regime. Where hopes of this sort were so widely entertained, trouble was bound to come at once. The new Ad­ ministration had hardly taken office when revolts began all over Mexico. The bandit chieftains, who had espoused Madero’s cause in the preceding year, promptly took the field against him when they saw what his notions were regarding the character of government, ltcyes himself abandoned the Presi­ dent’s cause, and in the autumn of last year young Diaz led a temporarily successful revolt at Vera Cruz, capturing that city. Of this exploit, however, the Government was warned. Diaz was captured in October, tried by a military court, found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to be shot. A court writ, however, prevented the execution and he was left in prison, whence he escaped last week. When it is asked more definitely what is the reason for this week’s revolt, there will be several answers. The revolutionary spirit which pervades Mexico, and the ignorance of the people, serve now, as always, to make such a movement easy. Beyond all that, however, the manner of Madero’s own succession 447 in 1911 clearly suggested the possibility of another counter-revolution along similar lines; for, no matter how much stress is laid on the fact that Madero was in form the country’s choice for President, the fact would always remain that, but for this revolt against another elected President and his success against that President in the field, he would never in all probability have reached a point where his election, even by a small majority, would have been possible. Aside from that consideration Madero, during his eighteen months of control of Mexican affairs, has failed to secure that prime essential under circum­ stances of the sort— peace and order for the people governed by him. Whatever might be said regard­ ing the manner and methods of old Porfirio Diaz’s long regime, there has been no disagreement as to the fact that he, first in a long succession of dicta­ tors, had brought peace with the opportunity for material prosperity to Mexico. Some of the reasons why Madero failed in this achievement we have already stated. There has been no sign of a strong hand in the Central Administration. Uncertainty of action— possibly caused by a conflict of military instincts with humane aspirations for parliamentary government— has repeatedly prevailed on critical occasions. If it be true that Madero’s Administra­ tion has been crippled in efficiency through his trust in the Mexican people, one would at least have to ascribe to him more of amiable aspirations than of robust power for action suited to a real emerg­ ency. Even after allowing for the political weaknesses and vices inherent in such a population as that of Mexico, it must be remembered that in every coun­ try where the form and personnel of government is, or has been, in dispute, the essential consideration is the guaranty of peace and order. That principle is not limited to Mexico; it is as old as civilized history. Napoleon was, to all intents and purposes, an usurper; so, as regards his larger powers, was Cromwell; but their respective nations acquiesced in the power seized by each through the bayonets of his soldiers, because each brought political and social order out of chaos. Had either of those two great dictators failed in that specific purpose, he would ^beyond any question have been shortly cast aside. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that Madero, tried by this severe test of political history, has been weighed in the balance and found wanting. Conceivably he may even yet demonstrate possession of the necessary powers; if not, then the logic of the situation indicates that some one else must try the experiment. The situation of our own Government, in the face of this week’s events at Mexico City, is extra­ ordinarily difficult. Our nation’s responsibility under the Monroe Doctrine— when other foreign govern­ ments, whose citizens are threatened in the Mexican disorder, are warned by our Government not to interfere— is heavy enough. Nor does our present unfortunate position in relation to the other SpanishAmerican States, whose people doubt and suspect our motives in the matter, simplify the situation. Again, if our Government were at this time to inter­ vene, not only would a problem of formidable diffi­ culty be raised as to our future relations to the Mexi­ can domain, but an extremely critical problem would 448 THE CHRONICLE at once be created in regard to the Americans now in Mexico. That this critical situation should have arisen only two or three weeks before a change in our National Administration, leaves the problem infinitely complex. In the nature of the case, this fact will require the Taft Administration to avoid, unless under absolute stress of circumstances, between now and the 4th of March, any such action as should commit the incoming Wilson Government. In the end, our action must be regulated by the progress of events. We can"
