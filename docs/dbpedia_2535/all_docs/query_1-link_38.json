We send to our subscribers to-day the October number of our “ Railway Earnings” Section. In this publication we give the figures of earnings and expenses for the latest month of every operating steam railroad in the United States required to file monthly returns with the Inter-State Commerce Commission at Wash­ ington. This Earnings Supplement also contains the com­ panies’ own statements where these differ from the Commerce returns or give fixed charges in addition to earnings, or where they have a fiscal year different from the June 30 year, as is the case with the New York Central Lines, the Pennsylvania R R ., and others. THE FINANCIAL SITUATION. The most sensational event of this week, the attempt on the life of Mr. Roosevelt, has elicited expressions of horror and regret all over the civilized world, and all right-minded men are as one in deploring it, but rejoicing that it was unsuccessful. There is not a shred of evidence to justify the deduction that the assault was anything more than the act of a disordered person, brooding over imagined wrongs and seized by the delusion that he was called to protect the coun­ try from the third term. From that, as from all possi­ ble evils, the country must protect itself by its own good sense; an individual intervention is un-American and exotic. Yet there is one moral which the country ought not to fail to perceive and ought not to shrink from con­ templating: It is that this shocking incident of a political campaign may be traced back to the haste, the impulse and the excess which have long been Mr. Roosevelt’s characteristics in both deed and word, especially in his public deliverances. In language which inevitably stirs class hatreds, exaggerates pres­ ent evils and suggests to superficial persons violent remedies, Mr. Roosevelt has been sowing dragon’s teeth, though he may not have realized it. Appeals to the passions rather than arguments addressed to the reason are always dangerously exciting to weak minds; and it should not be thought strange that the intense glare of notoriety which Mr. Roosevelt so delights in and has been carried by him nearly to the breaking-point in the past eight months has moved one unbalanced person to imagine himself called to be a national deliverer. We shall miss the best lesson of this affair if we fail to see that too sudden and violent remedies and too strenuous methods of urging them are not adapted to a representative and popular government. There is a suggestiveness in the prompt announce­ ment that the Taft and Wilson central bureaus had canceled the dates of their speakers, pending Mr. Roosevelt’s complete recovery, and that henceforth the campaign will probably avoid invective and adhere closely or more closely to the principles involved. This means that heretofore it has resembled a gladia­ torial combat rather than an exposition of principles, for the latter need not be withheld from presentation because one combatant has been withdrawn. There has been a flinging of epithets, and there have been bitter personal attacks, as there were in 1884] for ex­ ample. Has it been a public urging of national policies, or have we been hearing such terms as liar and thief bandied about? Confession that in the little time left there shall be more calmness and more reason seems to confess a lack of those thus far, andjpossibly [VO L. L X X X X V . the remarkable falling off thus far of registration in this State indicates both disgust and apathy. If the latter, the soberer part of the people do not believe much which has been vehemently said; if the former, the methods of the campaign seem condemned already. Is there not a lesson for most of us, when we consider the matter calmly? What may be called the “ new” , and is plainly a fast­ growing movement for better, agricultural work gets a fresh reminder by the issue of an octavo volume of 1G0 pages by the University of Chicago, “ Agricultural Development in the Public Schools.” This “ study of its development, with particular reference to the agencies concerned,” is by Mr. Benjamin Marshall Davis, professor of Agricultural Education in Miami University, and it has prefixed an introductory note by Mr. Charles Hubbard Judd, director of the School of Education in the University of Chicago. One is a little surprised to read in the first sentence of the book that the movement for agricultural education in this country dates back to 1785, “ when associations for the promotion of agriculture began to be formed; a few years later, in 1792, mainly in response to the agitation of these associations, colleges undertook to provide for instruction in agriculture— first Columbia, and then Harvard and Yale.” Instruction then could hardly have gone much be­ yond this in substance: scratch the soil, plant seeds, keep down the weeds, gather the crops. The author refers the real movement for scientific agriculture to the year 1862, when the Federal Department of Agri­ culture was founded, and he says it is estimated that in the last twenty years nearly 100 millions have been spent for agricultural research and education, mainly through this Department. The first remark of Mr. Judd’s introductory note is that “ agricultural educa­ tion is the most widely and energetically cultivated form of industrial education in this country at the present time.” A table showing “ attitude of States towards agricultural education in elementary and secondary schools” names 18 in which it is required by law, and 26 are named in which summer courses for teachers were given in the agricultural colleges in 1911. As men in professional or mercantile life in cities reach advanced years, a desire to get on the soil is common with them; with the children this desire is almost universal, as proved by the eagerness with which the city child is turned to amateur farming and the cheerfulness which the country school child dis­ plays when inducted into cultivating. A school teacher in Iowa says that “ my boys who would not go across the road for a song-book went two miles in the snow to get some sawdust for a germinating box” ; and one writer declares that every school-house ought to have its laboratory room, for if the teacher cannot do it, “ the room itself will teach.” Now, lie says, we see children carrying only books to school; “ some day they will also carry twigs and potatoes and animals and tools and contrivances and other personal objects.” Creation of a Boys’ Corn Club movement was under­ taken in 1909 in a few counties in some Southern States; over 12,000 boys were enrolled and in the next year the total reached 46,225. In one Mississippi county 48 boys averaged 92 bushels of corn per acre; in one South Carolina county 20 boys grew 1,700 bushels on 20 acres; another club of 142 averaged 62 bushels per acre, several going above 100 and even above 150. In 1910 Jerry Moore, of Winona, S. C., a boy not fifteen years old, grew 228% bushels on one acre, this OCT. 19 1912.] THE C H R O N IC L E being said to be the second largest yield in the history of corn production; on Dec. 12 1910 the prize-winners from eleven Southern States had their trip of honor to AVashington. These accounts of the new movement which follow one another are cumulative. We groan over the cost of food; we deplore the drift to the cities, and there is no direct and speedy mode of counteracting that; some of us imagine that laws can transfer people from one occupation and place of choice to another, and some of us are liable to be deluded into trusting the unspeci­ fied assurances of aspirants for high offices that they can solve all the problems of living. Agriculture will attract men only so fast as its rewards in money and comfort increase. It is helpful to note evidences on every hand that the first and most necessary line of human labor is beginning to really “ find itself” in respect to comparative powers of invitation. Our foreign trade statistics continue to furnish evi­ dence of expansion in both imports and exports. The merchandise exports for September were a little heavier even than in the month of last year, notwith­ standing a very noticeable decline in cotton ship­ ments. In the imports there was a very considerable increase over 1911. In both cases, of course, the figures constitute new records for the period. Cereal produce makes a much more satisfactory showing in the latest export statement than for many months past, the aggregate value of the shipments having been the greatest of any month since October 1908, and in excess of September of any year since 1902. This is due entirely, however, to the increased outflow of wheat, as corn and flour went out less freely than a year ago. The combined value of the breadstuffs exports was 2 0 ^ million dollars, against only a little over 1 3 ^ millions in 1911 and 9% millions in 1910. Meat and dairy products shipments, on the other hand, showed considerable diminution in value from a year ago, cotton went out much less liberally and the cattle and hogs outflow was almost nominal. Mineral oils recorded a somewhat important gain this year and cottonseed oil a moderate increase. Still, these vari­ ous items, covering all the commodities for which advance figures are given, furnish a total of only $88,879,458, which compares with $97,480,781 for September of last year. Contrasting with this decline, we have a notable gain in the aggregate of other articles of export (consisting largely of manufactures or ma­ terial to be used in manufacturing), the total shipments of which in September were $110,822,184, against $98,317,866 a year ago. The grand aggregate of the merchandise exports reached $199,701,652, against $195,798,647 in September 1911, and for the nine months of the calendar year they were $1,616,183,859, against $1,455,501,334. The September merchandise imports were $144,­ 862,343 and compare with only $125,171,644 in 1911. the former record for the period; and the total inflow for the nine months of 1912, at $1,333,125,577, exceeds the aggregate for the like period of 1911 by 201 million dollars. Needless to say, the large augmentation in value of importations here shown occurred principally in crude materials for use in manufacture, the gain in which during the elapsed portion of 1912 reaches approximately 80 million dollars, hides and skins and India rubber being the most prominent contribu­ tors thereto. The net result of our foreign trade in September was a balance of exports of $54,839,309, increasing to $283,058,282 the balance for the nine 1003 months of 1912. This compares Avith $70,627,003 and $322,584,149, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 1911. The record nine months’ export balance Avas that of 1908 ($432,269,181), the year of depression here, Avhen imports were very much re­ stricted . Turkey did not await a declaration of Avar by the Balkan States, but on Thursday, Oct. 18, itself issued a formal declaration of hostilities against Servia and Bulgaria. Greece Avas not mentioned in the official communications delivered to the Servian and Bul­ garian legations at Constantinople, and the Greek Minister Avas in fact not requested to leave the Turkish capital. This Avas at first interpreted as an indication that Greece had determined to resign from the Balkan league. All speculations in this direction were, Iioay ever, set at rest on Friday morning when the announce­ ment came from Athens that not wishing to detach herself from her allies, Greece had sent instructions to her Minister at Constantinople to communicate a declaration of Avar to the Porte. Greece at the same time sent a fraternal greeting to the allied States. Thus we have apparently the full measure of the real Avar in the Balkans before us, Avith Turkey on the one hand and Bulgaria, Servia, Montenegro and Greece on the other. An important factor in the AveekV developments Avas the signing of a final treaty of peace by Italy and Turkey and the formal termination of the Tripolitan war, Avhich, of course, removes Italy as an ally of the Balkan States. Having been unable to prevent the war, the efforts of the European PoAvers are iioav being concentrated on the task of preventing any spread of the conflagra­ tion or the growing up of any untoward development s which may involve other nations and create interfer­ ence Avith the general European situation, Avhich is so delicately balanced at the present moment. The chief source of danger appears to be the attitude of AustriaHungary, Avhich is shoAving a disposition to reserve full liberty of action and will not, according to reports that have reached St. Petersburg, proclaim neutrality. On the other hand, France has proposed to the other European Powers an immediate conference to deal Avith the war. There is reason to believe that the in­ vitations to this conference will be in all cases accepted. The reports from the various theatres of action are of the usual character incidental to the opening of hostilities. All contestants are sending forward the customary reports of “ glorious victories,” and the press arrangements are evidently not yet sufficiently com­ plete to furnish accounts of an independent character. The important factors in the war will undoubtedly be the approach of winter and also the financial pressure. All the Balkan States are so weak financially that they may hardly be expected to stand the strain of prolonged military operations. We discuss this latter feature, in an article on a subsequent page. The opinion pre­ vails in London that very little of a practical char­ acter is likely to be heard of the European conference until some important engagement has taken place. Then, doubtless, the European Concert will reneAV its ef­ forts to bring about peace on broad lines. Turkey has withdraAvn a large sum of money, reported to be $17,500,000, from Germany, according to a special dispatch from Bucharest, Roumania. The money it is alleged was deposited in Germany during the reign of the Sultan Abdul Hamed, and Avas ear-marked ex­ clusively for a war fund. Germany has consented,, says the correspondent, to its delivery to the Ottoman 1004 THE C H R O N IC L E Government, and the gold is now on the way from Kustendje, Roumania, to Constantinople on board the steamer Regele Carol I. The official declaration of war deprives Greece of the services of the Chinese cruiser she had arranged to buy at Newcastle. Four destroyers which Greece purchased at Liverpool shipped naval crews at Algiers and have started for Greece as convoys to the steamer Macedonia, which has on board Greek reservists from New York. On Tuesday, Oct. 15, Turkish and Italian pleni­ potentiaries signed at Ouchy, Switzerland, the proto­ col of a treaty of peace, and yesterday (Friday) at half-past three o’clock in the afternoon the final draft of the treaty was signed, thus terminating the war be­ tween Italy and Turkey. Such details as are to be allowed to become public will soon be announced. It is believed, however, that the treaty provides for, first, absolute sovereignty of Italy in Lybia, without formal recognition there of Italy by Turkey; second, free exercise of religious authority by the Khalif; third, Turkey to withdraw her regular troops from Lybia; fourth, Italy to pay an indemnity equivalent to Lybia’s contributions to the Ottoman treasury; fifth, restitution of the captured islands to Turkey, with guaranties for the Christian peoples; sixth, no indem­ nity payable by either side toward the cost of the war; and, seventh, re-establishment of former diplomatic and commercial relations. Italy under the agreement is, it is said, to associate herself with the Powers in trying to end the war in the Balkans speedily. She will also pay an annual sum to Turkey, but the amount has not yet been fixed. Kiamil Pasha, President of the Turkish Council, in an interview at Constantinople on Tues­ day evening declared that Turkey owed its defeat to Egypt’s neutrality. “ If,” he added, “ we had been able to send troops to Bengnazi across Egypt we should have conquered.” The interviewer remarked that the signing of the peace preliminaries would have a great effect on the Balkan war. To this Kiamil re­ plied: “ It comes too late. But for the Italian fleet we might have been bringing troops from Syria to Smyrna all these last weeks. Now the Greek fleet replaces that of Italy.” Cabled advices from Tientsin state that a renewal of financial negotiations between China and the SixPower group is possible on condition that the amount of the loan be reduced from $300,000,000 to $100,­ 000,000; that the salt revenue be administered in a manner similar to that of the Chinese customs, and that China be permitted to nominate a financial adviser and a foreign inspector. In return for the foregoing, China, the dispatch states, will guarantee not to bornow anywhere else until the bonds are sold out. Charles Birch Crisp, the head of the $50,000,000 Chi­ nese loan group, in an address at a meeting of the directors of the Anglo-Russian bank in London, of which he is Chairman, declared that the second half of the loan would be issued after the disturbances in the Balkans had quieted down. Referring to the movement to compel China to pay up the arrears on the Boxer indemnities, Mr. Crisp said: “ If the British Minister at Peking continues to press China for the $20,­ 000,000 arrears on the Boxer indemnity, we will find the money.” Mr. Crisp stated that part of his arrange­ ment with China was the organization of a State Bank with a capital of $10,000,000. One-half of this capital s to be subscribed by the Chinese Government and [VOL. L X X X X V . the other half by five nations. There would be nine directors, four nominated by China and five by sub­ scribers to the capital of the Bank. “ If Great Britain, the United States, France, Germany and Russia subscribed,” continued Mr. Crisp, “ each would be per­ mitted the appointment of a director, and this with an English President would be an ample guaranty.” This was evidently a reply to Sir Edward Grey, the British Foreign Secretary, who, in response to a ques­ tion in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon, said there was no intention of forcing China to borrow more than it wants, or at all, and how added: “ Loaning to China without a guaranty for the proper expendi­ ture of the money would impair the Chinese credit and lead to bankruptcy and the intervention of the foreign Powers.” The revolt against Madero rule in Mexico has taken new life and has again grown to threatening pro­ portions. General Felix Diaz, nephew of Porfirio Diaz, former President of Mexico, who is now exiled in Paris, has taken the field against the Government and has rallied around himself a large part of the Mexi­ cans who are opposed to President Madero. It is rumored, though not confirmed, that Orizaba, the largest industrial centre in Vera Cruz, and Corbobo and Jalapa have revolted and declared their intention of joining the Diaz movement. The young general, who is only 32 years of age, is reported to be in su­ preme command of the country about Vera Cruz, and is displacing Federal officers with his own men. Five regiments, the bulk of Federal troops in that section, have, it is stated, joined the Diaz colors and the new leader is declared to have 3,000 troops under his com­ mand, while the rebel troops loyal to his cause are within forty miles of the City of Mexico. Doubts as to the specific object of the Diaz revolt were removed when he was proclaimed Provisional President by Colonel Jose Diaz Ordaz, his cousin, and Commander of the 21st Infantry stationed at Vera Cruz. After a stormy session of the Mexican Congress on Wednes­ day evening, during which Deputy Moheno demanded the resignation of the Cabinet and was balked by the President of the Chamber refusing to permit discus­ sion, Moheno again on Thursday afternoon attacked the Government and insisted that peace could come to Mexico only through the resignation of Madero or the intervention of the United States. His motion was defeated. President Madero in an interview minimized the movement under young Diaz and reiterated his oft-repeated declaration that he would not resign. He said: “ Undoubtedly the news of the uprising under Felix Diaz has caused great alarm, but it should not be given more importance than it has, which in my judgment is not great. The discontented will take occasion to call for my resig­ nation from my post, but, as I have declared on other occasions, the legality of the Government is undeniable. Therefore I shall never resign before my term expires. Only death can remove me from the Presidency be­ fore that time.” Building construction operations in the United States in September 1912, while upon the contracting scale usually witnessed in the fall of the year, never­ theless indicate considerable activity in many sections of the country. It is true, of course, that the esti­ mated outlay for work projected in September this year at 134 leading cities falls some 9 million dollars below that for the corresponding period in 1911, but almost Oct. 19 193 n ] THE C H R O N IC L E half of the decrease is accounted for by a special opera­ tion last year at Kansas City. We refer to the plans filed for the erection of the Union Depot at that point and calling for the expenditure of over 4 million dollars. Then, too, the month lately closed witnessed a marked decline at Boston from the extreme activity of earlier recent periods, a statement equally true of the Borough of Manhattan of Greater New York. These three points account for more than the whole of the decline this year, leaving the net result for the re­ maining 131 cities a slight gain over 1911. This, obviously, is a very satisfactory showing, especially when antecedent activity is considered. Our returns from 134 cities furnish an aggregate of contemplated outlay of $69,339,560, or $9,000,823 (11.5%) less than for the month of 1911 but $2,732,871 (4.1%) in excess of 1910. Manhattan Borough, as already stated, records an important decline from a year ago—but this is in large part offset by gains in all other boroughs, so that for the whole city the com­ parison is between $14,447,378 and $15,991,624. Outside of New York the prospective disbursements under September permits total $54,892,182, as com­ pared with $62,348,759 last year and $53,420,009 in 1910. At a number of the larger cities somewhat conspicuous gains over 1911 are observable, notably at Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Cleveland, In­ dianapolis, Newark, Memphis and Oakland, and a few of the smaller municipalities report intended expendi­ tures much more than double those of last year. On the other hand, the returns rom Kansas City, Boston, Washington, Portland (Ore.), St. Paul, Cincinnati, Los Angeles and Buffalo . evoal more or less heavy percentages of decrease. Interesting as the monthly exhibit is as an indicator of the current trend of affairs in the bui ding industry, it is of but slight importance as compared with the showing for an extended period. The month’s total falls below that of last year; the year’s to date is moderately in excess of 1911 and greater than for any earlier year. For the nine months of 1912 the antici­ pated outlay at the 134 cities is, according to our compilation, a little more than 741 million dollars, as against 715 millions in 1911 and 682 millions in 1910. For Greater New York the respective figures are 176% millions, 152% millions and 162 millions, and for the other cities collectively 565 millions, 562 millions and 520 millions. The results in the various sections of the country, likewise, are quite encouraging. Twentyone New England cities show an aggregate gain over 1911 of 9 million dollars, thirteen on the Pacific Slope an increase of over 10 millions, twenty-four at the South an augmentation of a little less than a million; and, notwithstanding less activity this year at such important points as Philadelphia, Washington, Balti­ more, Syracuse and Troy, the decline from a year ago for the thirty cities (not including New York) that make up the Middle section is barely three-quarters of a million. In the Middle West (24 cities) a loss of 8 mi lions is shown, but excluding Chicago (where operations were inordinately swelled last year in August to get the advantage of an old building law) a gain of 7 millions is seen. The loss of 3% millions in the “ Other Western’ ’ section (21 cities), moreover, is more than accounted for by the special operation in 1911, to which reference has already been made. Canadian building operations continue on the same active scale as tor many months past and present no unusual feature. We have returns for September from 22 cities in the Eastern Provinces and 20 in the 1005 newer Western country, and combined they furnish an aggregate of projected outlay of no less than $20,412,­ 735, or $7,522,817 (58.4%) greater than a year ago. For the identical 42 cities for the nine months an esti­ mated outlay of $150,582,360 ($57,791,207 in the East and $92,791,153 in the West) is reported, this comparing with $107,285,581 ($44,440,048 East and $62,845,533 West) in 1911 and 80% millions in 1910— this latter being about equally divided between the two sections. The week has witnessed a substantial recovery in the European markets, especially in Paris and Berlin, where concert of action by the banks and bourse offi­ cials has restored a condition of calmness and some degree of confidence. Vienna seems the weakest spot that is left after the world-wide disturbance, and, to quote a usually conservative press corre­ spondent, the market there is “ strewn with industrial wreckage” caused by the fear of Austria becoming involved in war with Russia. Saturday last, when our own markets were closed for the Columbus holiday, will long be known as a day of wild excitement and severe losses on the European exchanges, though hap­ pily without causing, on the surface at least, import­ ant financial embarrassments. In London all classes of securities were summarily sold, and there was a repetition of recent experiences in which American securities were heavily liquidated as a result of their effective salability to provide funds for taking care of securities that were less salable. Canadian Pacific, which is held very largely in Berlin and on the Dutch market, was under special pressure, and declined 13 points (expressed in New York equivalent) on the London market, while on the same basis Union Pacific declined 3% , Atchison 2% , Baltimore & Ohio 2% , St. Paul 2% , Reading 2% , United States Steel 2% and Amalgamated Copper 3 points. Fortunately an active —in fact, almost complete—recovery took place on Monday in the London market before the New York Stpck Exchange opened. Thus the new week both at home and abroad started under improved condi­ tions and, while a considerable amount of nervousness remained, the final result shows that actual progress for the better has been made in the general financial situation in New York and at the foreign monetary centres. At both Paris and Berlin the banks intervened to support the investment market. On Monday, according to press dispatches, the panicky tendency on the Berlin Bourse was checked by the energetic action of the leading banks, which, after a meeting, announced their intention of taking over as far as possible all securities of a legitimate character thrown on the market. This step at once led to recoveries, notwithstanding the contemporaneous news of the Turkish invasion of Servian territory. At Paris on Monday there was also concerted effort of French financial leaders and of the Government to check what was called an unjustified panic. Combined support by the French banks relieved the Paris Bourse’s posi­ tion at the mid-monthly settlement, and Paris cable advices announced that a prohibition had been placed by the Bourse authorities upon short selling to the extent that it became obligatory upon the sellers to show the scrip or evidence that they had in their possession the securities they were offering for sale. Russian industrials were among the chief sufferers, but later St. Petersburg banks relieved the situation by their activity in taking care of this section of the 1006 THE C H R O N IC L E market. French rentes on Monday fell below 88 (87.973^), which is the lowest quotation recorded since the German war scare of 1890. British consols declined to 72)^, thereby establishing a new low record on their present basis. In Berlin on Saturday the fall in prices ranged from one to four points in Gov­ ernment stocks, 2 points in bank stocks and from 20 to 25 points in industrial shares. While semi-official assurances on Monday that the Balkan war would be localized and not permitted to involve the European Powers were largely responsible for the improved conditions, the official news on Tuesday that peace preliminaries had been signed between Italy and Turkey was a more effective in­ fluence. It was recognized at once that this develop­ ment would have a potential influence in limiting the spread of the Balkan disturbances. So long as Italy continued at war with Turkey, it necessarily became an ally of the Balkan States that are in revolt. But with the removal of Italy none of the Great Powers is actively participating in the Balkan conflict and the movement of the Powers to localize the contest and seek means of securing a satisfactory compromise can proceed, therefore, without irritation. In financial circles in New York, as a result of this reasoning, the Balkan troubles fell to a very minor position as an influence in stock market calculations. It seemed to be argued quite generally that European selling of American securities had run its course and that if this proved to be the case, then the only interest that the American market could reasonably have in the general foreign situation, aside from the sympathetic movement which always prevails among the financial centres of the world, would be the return of conditions that would mean the re-purchase of the securities that Europe since the outburst of the Balkan troubles has so freely sold. There does not, it must be con­ ceded, appear at the moment prospect of such action. European official discounts were generally advanced this week, the Bank of Belgium starting the movement by an advance to 5% from 4% , on Wednesday. The Bank of England formally announced a 5% rate on Thursday— an advance from 4 % —though the increase for all practical purposes was in effect on Tuesday as the Bank at that time refused to take bills at lower than the new rate. The Bank of France followed the Bank of England on Thursday by an advance of 33d>% from 3% and private cables from very high German sources have been received in this city stating that the Imperial Bank of Germany will shortly name a 5% rate in place of 4J4% that is now current. All these advances, of course, testify to the acute strain that has developed throughout Europe. Private bank discounts are also correspondingly higher. In Lombard Street the market rate for short bills, as reported by cable yesterday, was 444%, while for ninety day bankers’ acceptances the closing quotation was 4)4 @ !%%• A week ago the quotation for sixty day bills was 3 % % @ 4 % and ninety day bills 4@ 4 % % . Bills to arrive are now quoted at virtually the same as the spot figures .A week ago the forward rates were 434@ 4)4% for sixty day and 4% % for ninety days and these rates were conditional upon the bills arriv­ ing in advance of any increase in the Bank of England rate. As they could not arrive before next Monday, however, bills that were forwarded by last Saturday’s steamer will, in most instances, be subject to an additional )4 % discount, representing, as we ex­ plained in the “ Chronicle\" last week, a division of the L XXX \\ 1% advance by the Bank between the contracting parties. In Paris the open market rate, as reported by cable yesterday, was 3)4% for spot bills, which is above the new rate quoted by the Bank, while bills to arrive were 3 % % - Last week the private rate, as well as the official rate, was 3% . The open market rate in Berlin closed yesterday at 434% for sixty day bills and 434% for ninety day bills with quotations for bills to arrive 34% above these figures. A week ago 434% was the spot rate for all maturities. Amster­ dam quotes 334% as the open market rate while Brussels closes at 4)4% • The market rate in Vienna has advanced 44% during the week, to 5% , which is also the official rate. The official bank rates at the leading foreign centres are London 5% ; Paris 334%; Berlin 434%; Vienna 5% ; Burssels 5% ; Amsterdam 4% ; Bombay 4% , and Bengal 3% . The weekly statement of the Bank of England showed a further release of cash to the market, repre­ sented by a decrease of £998,000 in public deposits. There was also an increase of £650,000 indicated in the loan item. This brings the total amount of out­ standing loans up to £34,105,000, which compares with £28,242,725 one year ago and £28,961,771 in 1910. A loss of £347,689 was shown in gold coin and bullion, but the Bank still is in a strong position in this respect, as it holds £37,565,796, comparing with £37,360,921 at this date last year and with £31,985,­ 352 in 1910. The total reserve was increased by £195,000, bringing the total up to £27,387,000, com­ paring with £27,141,706 one year ago and £22,802,172 in 1910. Notes reserved registered an increase of £236,000, notes in circulation a decrease of £543,000, while ordinary deposits increased £1,498,000. The proportion of reserves to liabilities is now 48.75%, against 48.84% last week and 52.40% one year ago. Our special correspondent furnishes the following details of the movement of gold into and out of the Bank for the Bank week: £486,000 (of which £6,000 Bank for the Bank week: Imports, £486,000 (of which £6,000 from Australia and £480,000 bought in the open market); exports, £1,238,000 (of which £325,000 to Egypt, £400,000 to Brazil, £100,000 to France, £113,000 to Bremen, £280,000 to Continent and £20,000 to miscellaneous destinations), and re­ ceipts of £401,000 net from the interior of Great Britain. The Bank of France reported a decrease of 4,308,000 francs in gold and 2,619,000 francs in silver. That the higher Bank rate was necessary is clearly suggested by an increase of 186,200,000 francs in the discounts. General deposits registered an expansion of 143,700,000 francs, treasury deposits increased 22,675,000 francs and advances decreased 14,625,000 francs. Comparing with last year, the Bank still remains in a strong posi­ tion, although in contrast with the year preceding the showing is not quite so favorable. The stock of gold is 3,230,774,000 francs, as against 3,123,­ 775,000 francs at this date in 1911 and 3,339,700,000 francs in 1910. The silver stocks are lower than both years, amounting now to 753,585,000 francs against 799,500,000 francs in 1911 and 837,150,000 francs in 1910. Paris cables state that both the official Bank and all the large French institutions are con­ tinuing their recent policy of refusing to pay out gold except for unusual purposes. The French Bank’s out­ standing circulation now amounts to 5,442,577,000 francs, comparing with 5,418,602,350 francs and 5,­ 257,909,015 francs in 1911 and 1910. respectively. Oct. 19 1912.] THE C H R O N IC L E General deposits are 072,923,000 francs, against 587,328,174 francs and 577,714,705 francs in the two preceding years. The Bank’s discounts aggregate 1.517.321.000 francs, comparing with 1,542,903,077 francs in 1911 and 1,026,237,016 francs the year pre­ ceding. The weekly return of the Bank of Germany, which was promulgated on Thursday, was an exceptionally strong document in view of the strain in the general European financial situation. The gold on hand regis­ tered an increase of 31,677,000 marks and gold andsilver combined of 54,078,000 marks. Meanwhile there was a decreasein thediscounts of 158,487,000 marks and a com­ paratively small increase in the loans of 2,603,000 marks. Notes in circulation indicated a contraction of 163,­ 009,000 marks and treasury bills a reduction of 39,000 marks. The aggregate of the stocks of gold and silver is now 1,197,909,000 marks, which compares with 1.041.720.000 marks in 1911 and 950,840,000 marks in 1910. The loans and discounts together are 1,509,­ 487,000 marks. A year ago they aggregated 1,359,­ 880,000 marks and in 1910 1,280,100,000 marks. The outstanding circulation is 1,942,244,000 marks, against 1,897,580,000 marks in 1911 and 1,719,520,000 marks in 1910. The local money situation, while evincing no im­ portant relaxation, has nevertheless not shown evidence of particular strain or nervousness on the part of borrowers. The interior demand has not been as active on New York as was the case last week; although at Chicago New York funds are again quoted at a slight discount, namely 15c. per $1,000. The South is continuing to require funds for the cotton movement, but there is no indication thus far of any important withdrawals of Canadian money, although New York exchange at Montreal is again at par, which compares with a premium of 31 }4C- a week ago. The steamship “ Adriatic” , which arrived last Satur­ day, proved to have on board $2,275,000, instead of $1,120,000 in gold bars, as had been reported by cable last week. In addition the steamship “ Caronia” , which arrived on Monday, brought $805,000 in gold thus making the total of the current inward move­ ment $7,480,000 and, so far as has been reported, com­ pleting the importation. The new arrivals will, of course, appear in this week’s bank statement,which, in view of the favorable sub-Treasury movement, should be a fairly satisfactory one unless loans have been again permitted to run up. Of course, with the higher bank rates abroad and the necessity of paying for the large volume of American securities that has been sold by foreign holders, there is no likelihood of additional engagements of gold at London for New York account and New York was not interested in the South African gold, amounting to £613,000, offered in the London auction on Monday. Of the total, £150,000 was obtained for India and the remainder apparently went to the Bank of England, as no other outside bids were reported. The range covered by call money this week has been 3 @ 5 % , the higher figure being quoted each day. On Monday 4^g% was the lowest and 5% the ruling rate; on Tuesday 4)^% was the lowest and tlie renewing basis; on Wednesday and Thursday 3% was the minimum on each day, while 4 % % continued the renewal rate on Wednesday, but was reduced to 4M % 011 Thursday. Friday’s range \\.x/ i@ 5 % , with 4 % % remaining the ruling figure. Time money closed fractionally higher for the week for the earlier 1007 maturities. Final quotations were 5 F £ @ 5 ^ % for sixty days; 5 % % f ° r ninety days; 5F£@ 5% % for four months; 5jdj% for five months, and 5 }4 @ 5 }4 % for six months. Boston and Philadelphia banks have been lending rather freely at this centre this week. Mercantile paper is not offering with any degree of activity, although out-of-town institutions have been available as buyers on a moderate scale. Discounts continue on a 6% basis for choice six months' names and also for sixty and ninety day endorsed bills re­ ceivable. In exceptional instances 5 % % may available. Names not classed as choice remain at The market for sterling exchange has been erratic and highly nervous. This is not surprising in view of the general advance in foreign official discount rates and the early-week intimations that such an advance was to come. There has been quite an amount of manipulation in buying and selling demand bills. One local institution in particular has succeeded in upsetting conditions, seemingly for the purpose of covering short commitments. It would bid for ex­ change quietly and after securing a fair supply would spectacularly sacrifice a part of its purchases. This process it repeated several times during the week. But notwithstanding the higher discounts abroad and the active demand for remittances in connection with the sales of American securities by foreign holders, the market has not advanced very sharply. On Mon­ day and Tuesday there were substantial gains, but the trend during the latter part of the week was down­ ward. Grain and cotton bills are now offering freely, and there is a disposition in sterling exchange circles to operate on the theory that we are this year to have an early and protracted outward movement of both grain and cotton. Our exports are continuing at record-marking proportions; but so are our imports. Therefore the net influence on the market for sterling exchange is not marked on either side. Demand sterling in Paris, after declining to 25.21 francs on Monday, closed at 25.25 francs, comparing with 25.26Yz francs a week ago and the London check rate in Berlin closed at 20.50]4 marks, which represents an advance of 34pf •for the week. The Berlin check rate in Paris closed at 123.12 francs, a further reduction of 13 centimes net for the week, indicating a continued movement in favor of France. Paris is reported by cable to have been selling St. Petersburg exchange very freely in Berlin in connection with the movement of the Russian banks to aid the French market to care for the Russian industrial shares that have been under such distinct pressure. Compared with Friday of last week, sterling ex­ change on Monday (Saturday was a holiday) was very firm; the market was feverish and excited, with an early advance of about F£c. on the complications in the Balkan situation and the prospects of an advance in the Bank of England rate; before the close there was a slight reaction, owing to large offerings of grain and cotton bills and the final range was 4 8595 @ 4 8605 for demand, 4 8635@4 8645 for cable transfers and 4 8170@4 8180 for sixty days. Sterling opened strong on Tuesday and the advance was continued, with demand at 4 8605 @ 4 8615, cable transfers at 4 8645@4 8655 and sixty days at 4 8190@4 82. The upward movement was checked on Wednesday; there was a weaker undertone and rates declined, on the easing of London discounts, due to more favorable conditions abroad and heavy offerings of bills, to 1008 THE C H R O N IC L E 4 8580@4 8590 for demand, 4 8630@4 8640 for cable transfers and 4 8175@4 8185 for sixty days. A further decline attended the opening Thursday on the continued large offerings of cotton and grain bills, although later the market rallied on buying by a prominent national bank; the rise in the Bank of England rate to 5% had little effect, having been discounted earlier; demand closed lower at 4 8575 @ 4 8585 and cable transfers at 4 8625 @ 4 8635; sixty days was unchanged. On Friday there was an irregular tone, and closing quotations indicated a further loss of 5 points. Final quotations were 4 8170@4 8180 for sixty days, 48570@48580 for demand bills and 4 8620 @ 4 8630 for cable transfers. Commercial on banks closed at 4 79% @ 4 81% and documents for payment 4 8 1 % @ 4 82% . Cotton for payment ranged from 4 81% to 4 81%, grain for payment from 4 8 1 % @ 4 82. The New York Clearing-House banks, in their oper­ ations with interior banking institutions, have gained $137,000 net in cash as a result of the currency movements for the week ending Oct. 18. Their re­ ceipts from the interior have] aggregated [$9,464,000, while the shipments have reached $9,327,000. Adding the Sub-Treasury operations and the gold imports, which together occasioned a gain of $1,100,000, the combined result of the flow of money into and out of the New York banks for the week appears to have been a gain of $1,237,000, as follows: Into Banks.

The war in the Balkans, which had already in effect broken out last week, through the demonstrations of Bulgaria and Montenegro against Turkey, has now begun in form. The conclusion of peace between Italy and Turkey last Tuesday was the signal for open declaration of hostilities in the other conflict. On the following day the Turkish Government submitted to the three Balkan States and Greece a demand that within twenty-four hours they withdraw and apolo­ gize for their note of last week to the Porte, which was characterized as insolent. Obviously, nothing else was expected than refusal of the smaller Powers to accede to this demand, and, in fact, Bulgaria’s imme­ diate response, on reception of the note, was formal declaration of war against Turkey. This was followed within twenty-four hours by the declaration of hos­ tilities between Turkey and Servia, Montenegro and Greece. Fighting has already begun on the borders of these various States, and small battles, with varying results, have occurred, not only on the Montenegrin [VOL. L X X X X V . and Servian frontiers but along the boundary line of Greece. The war is therefore fairly under way, and in due course an engagement of some real consequence is to be expected. The war situation is undoubtedly simplified by the peace with Italy— a fact recognized by the European stock exchanges, where prices of the bonds of the various governments, belligerent and non-belligerent, had fallen two to nine points during the fortnight of war preparations (they touched their lowest figures last Monday), but where a recovery of two to three points ensued on the first clear intimation of the peace with Italy. It is noteworthy that the Italian terms of peace were not altered from those submitted weeks ago to the Turkish negotiators in the conference in Switz­ erland. Those terms in substance provide for the au­ tonomy of the contested province of Tripoli, for the sovereignty of Italy over that province, and for the payment of a moderate indemnity by Italy to Turkey in exchange for this territorial cession. That Italy allowed its terms of peace to remain un­ changed is undoubtedly to be explained by the atti­ tude of the neutral Powers. On general principles, one might have imagined that Italy would have im­ posed some new exactions; indeed, the curious fact that the King of Italy is the son-in-law of the King of Montenegro had led some people to infer that Italy might actually lend a hand to the Balkan principali­ ties. But the obvious truth was, that continuance of Italy in the field as a belligerent would have inevita­ bly caused grave complications, especially if, as would not have been improbable, Italy had demanded of the Powers the right to land on the Turkish coast and as­ sist the Balkan armies in their campaign. This would have directly involved European Powers, both in the struggle and in the after negotiations. As matters now stand, this danger is averted. Italy is undoubt­ edly glad to be rid of a vexatious military campaign, while Turkey, on her side, is free for operations in the Mediterranean. Turkey will, in fact, be benefitted not only by its better control over its military re­ sources, but through its opportunity for demonstra­ tions against Greece on that country’s exposed seacoast. When one considers the outlook for military results in the campaign which has now begun, there are the usual uncertainties and perplexities. The prevalent London estimate concedes an available force of about 1,025,000 men for the Turkish army and a total of something like 700,000 men for the four States of Bulgaria, Servia, Greece and Montenegro, with nearly half a million more in the doubtful case that Roumania were also to ally herself with them. Both Turkey and its antagonists have in hand an accumulated armament whose quality remains to be tested. The armies on each side are reported to be in a fair state of discipline and training. The handicap of the Balkan States lies undoubtedly in the fact that they are con­ ducting offensive warfare, and must therefore appar­ ently maintain their troops in the enemy’s country. The handicap of Turkey lies in the fact that its mili­ tary forces are scattered throughout the Empire—in Europe, Asia and Africa— and cannot readily be concentrated. If the question were to arise of power to draw further on the ultimate reserve forces, Turkey on paper enjoys a great advantage; its population of some 24,000,000, all told, comparing with not much more than 10,000,000 in the Balkan States and Greece. But presumably the problem has to do, not with popu­ lation, but with militar forces efficient at the moment. O c t . 19 1912. j THE C H R O N IC L E Again, there remains to be considered the extremely important problem of financing the war. In some re­ gards, the aspects of this problem in the present in­ stance are unique. No fixed sum can be named as the necessary cost of war. In recent wars it has ranged as low as $150,000 per day for one belligerent and as high as $1,000,000 per day. The cost of any campaign would necessarily be determined by its character, and in the present case the probability would seem to be that the expense of conducting the Balkan war will lie somewhere midway between the cost of such a war as that in Manchuria and the cost of the much cheaper Turco-Italian campaign. All the belligerents in this case are \"poor nations,” in the sense of having little or no reserve of available capital on their own markets for use in war. All must apparently rely for the most part on the European money markets. But in this respect the extremely singular situation exists that, with the exception of Bulgaria, every one of the present belligerents is virtually in the hands of its creditors. In Turkey, Servia and Greece the public debt is administered by an international commission; that having been the requirement under which advances were made by foreign markets at a time of practical Government bankruptcy. Bulgaria has fair credit on the Conti­ nental markets, Greece has all but none. Servia has been a borrower very recently, but only on the explicit pledge of certain State resources, and on the explicit understanding as to the kind of expenditure to which the proceeds of its loans should be devoted. Here is an odd enough situation as regards the problem of raising further loans for a heavy and con­ tinuous war expenditure. The problem is certainly not diminished by the fact that the great European Powers and the great European financiers are alike united in disapprobation of the policy of the Balkan provinces in provoking war. The Turkish Empire, too, has its finances largely under the supervision of a foreign commission; but in this case, as in the case of the Italian war, it is not an unimportant considera­ tion that the war was provoked by Turkey's antago­ nists, not by Turkey itself. It is not as easy or logical to deny credit facilities for the conducting of defensive war as it is to refuse them to an obsti­ nate aggressor. It is too early for any intelligent conjecture as to what must be the effect of this singular fiscal situation. On general principles, it has long been recognized that, in one way or another, any government can carry on war and raise the money for it. As a rule, the experience of the Transvaal Government is pointed to. But the difference between a defensive cam­ paign such as that of the Transvaal Bepublics, waged in a territory familiar to the defenders and Avholly unfamiliar to the invaders, and a contest such as is now under way in the mountains of Macedonia, is sufficiently obvious. One natural enough inference would be that the present war must be short and soon decided, unless the financial question is to become a serious handicap. But this is to assume that certain results will be achieved at once, either by Turkey or by its oppon­ ents. The problem of the Balkan armies is three­ fold— to capture the garrisoned frontier positions of the Turkish Empire; to advance far enough to make serious demonstrations on the Turkish cities; or to capture a really important Turkish army. As modern warfare goes, the third achievement would be the most effective. The surrender of a large and power­ 1009 fully organized army force would mean a settlement of the war. Entire rout of a Turkish army would accomplish the same result, as it did in the case of Greece in 1897. As to just what the probability is of any of these results, the next few weeks will show. In a military sense, the immediate problem of Turkey clearly enough is, first, to prevent the conjunction of the Bulgarian and Servian armies, and then to fight a defensive campaign until the arrival of its outstanding re-enforcements. The reassuring fact in the situation as it stands is that the neutral States are acting con­ certedly to keep their hands off, and are determined to localize the area of the war. There is no reason to suppose that this attitude of the larger Powers is pursued in anything but the best of mutual good faith. Friction and trouble undoubtedly may follow when the time comes to arrange the terms of peace. But that is looking pretty far ahead. PRAGMATISM IN BUSINESS AND IN POLITICS. We are indebted to the late Professor William James of Harvard University for a term which after having had a rather long and somewhat shadowy and sub­ liminal existence, has now found wide acceptance. Pragmatism, his new term in philosophy, exalts the actual and effective value of forces or phenomena in the material world above all theory or matter of detail. It emphasizes the fact that no phenomenon can appear, become mighty, and persist, unless it develop in accordance with natural law, and be for the ultimate good; and that the proof that it has this character is to be sought in its obvious usefulness. It will be found to work, and to work beneficently. Otherwise, it has no validity, and will prove to be unsound and futi c. This is not a mere iteration of the brutal aphorism that \"nothing succeeds like success” . Nor does it mean that \"whatever is, is right.” if it only has existed a good while and has prospered. It does mean that the plan of the universe is progressive; that cause lies everywhere1 close to effect; and that the best way to estimate both methods and forces is to wait for results, and then as quickly as possible to gather them up and study them in re ation to their p ace in the general scheme of things. The air is full of new economic and political doc­ trines; some are refurbished old ones, many are brandnew. All are pressed with the heat of a great political campaign, and all alike crowded upon a business community driving ahead at a tremendous pace, with perils on every side, anxious chiefly to be un­ disturbed. Because the business world cannot stop; because the decisions that are to be made by the whole people are so critical, responsible men want to know to what to commit themselves. They need light. Here is where Pragmatism comes to our help. It sweeps away the cobwebs and windy sophistries of the politician and the doctrinaire. We have been making history so fast that, happily, we have already no lack of results with which to test most of the new schemes. We know pretty well, for example, what the big industrial corporations and trusts can do, and what they cannot do. They can not secure their own success and existence except by meeting substantially the same conditions as apply in all business. That is, no mere bigness or extent of combination will guarantee success. Of the thousands of listed \"industrials,” how many have long since passed out of existence? And what notable failures 1010 THE C H R O N IC L E [VOL. LXXXXV. some of the biggest have made!

For the latest instance, the Kentucky rating board Traction situation in Chicago. The lesson of all this is that the “ pragmatic” test has issued its first order, which, it says, is expected will surely be recognized in time, and will be effectively to make an average cut of 25% on dwelling property applied in the whole country. We may have “ crazy in city or country and save a quarter-million annually doctrines” proclaimed in the political platform and to the insuring public. This order is to take effect made plausible by voluble orators, but the people arc Nov. 1, and in promulgating it the Chairman of the learning.

The effect has been to deny relief to the roads, while their employees, with vir­ tual, if not positive, assistance from the general public, and often with the aid of some member of the Com­ merce Commission, have been forcing wage advances upon them. It is merely a statement of primary arith­ metic (which has been made over and over, and perhaps fails to impress people because of its very simplicity) to say that this pressure from one direction, and this barring of escape along what is naturally the line of least resistance, weakens the roads financially, and impairs their ability to provide the new capital needed for their development and that of the country. This is a financial view of the situation, and it un­ happily seems that a considerable part of the whole public takes small concern whether the roads are financially thriving or the opposite; but they do rather strenuously demand that the roads shall keep up service and increase it as needed, and this pre­ sents an aspect to which nobody can profess indiffer­ ence. Under a financial pressure, the roads find diffi­ culty in keeping up (not to mention increasing) their physical resources for carrying; moreover, the larger work they have to do the more new equipment they need for doing it and the more the existing equipment wears out. Here we are congratulating ourselves on the huge crops of the year, and so much so that the Taft campaign begins to read encouragement in the ex­ pected aid of the feeling of “ prosperity” ; but along with it come questions and doubts, which seem to grow week after week, whether the carriers will be able to handle the product. Suppose not; should any reason­ able person be surprised or have difficulty in under­ standing why? The soil stands loyally by the United States; the elements stay friendly, even the frosts holding off; but what are we to do in our embarrassing abundance? Here is the practical side of the subject which not even the non-capitalist can pretend does not concern him. How is the nation to use its powers and grow, if, in obedience to the cackle of political adventurers, it shackles its own bodily members? GREAT NORTHERN’S FAVORABLE RESULTS. The Great Northern Railway Co. in its annual report for the year ended June 30 1912 makes a strikingly good showing, both as regards gross and net results, and particularly in comparison with the twelve months preceding. This is the more note­ worthy as conditions were by no means altogether favorable. The spring-wheat crop of last season in the territory traversed by the lines of the system was, doubtless, somewhat larger than in the previous sea­ son, but the crop was short in both of those years, and the traffic from the same, presumably, less than the normal. It is evident, too, from the statement in the report to the effect that the lumber traffic decreased as compared with the year preceding, that traffic con­ ditions were not altogether satisfactory, in some other directions. Doubtless, the wonderful revival of the iron and steel trade added greatly to the company’s tonnage in iron ore, though the haul on this is not very long, such traffic moving mainly from the ore beds in Minnesota to the head of the Great Lakes. 1011 Then, also, the system had increased competition to contend against on the part of the Puget Sound line of the Milwaukee & St. Paul. The Northern Pacific would be apt to suffer more seriously from that cause than the Great Northern by reason of the closer proximity of its lines to the route of the new com­ petitor, but the Great Northern could not escape because the new extension touches its line at a number of important points. In the previous fiscal year the Chicago Milwaukee & Puget Sound cut into the freight traffic of the two older systems, but had not yet begun to develop its passenger traffic to any great extent. In the year under review it made inroads also upon the passenger traffic of the older systems, as is is evident from the fact that the passenger earnings of the Puget Sound line increased from $1,003,596 in the fiscal year 1911 to $2,631,901 in the fiscal year 1912. As supporting the idea that this gain was in part, at least, at the expense of the older roads, it is to be noted that the Great Northern passenger revenue for 1912 shows only a slight increase ($200,952, or 1)/ 2% ) as compared with the year preceding, and the passenger traffic itself records a decrease. The number of passengers moved fell off 193,825, or 2.31%, while the number carried one mile records a contraction of 42,722,688, or 7.23%. The average length of the haul decreased 5.03%, while the average revenue per passenger per mile increased from 2.273 cts. to 2.487 cts. In other words, there was evidently a falling off in the number of through passengers carried, with the effect of diminishing the average length of the haul, and an increase in the local traffic, on which rates are better, with the effect of improving the average rate received and increasing the aggregate of passenger earnings. This decrease in the passenger traffic in 1912 is the more noteworthy as it follows large losses in the previous year. The passenger earnings then fell off no less than $889,743, or over 6% , and the number of passengers carried one mile then decreased 58,751,307, or over 9% . There was a special reason, however, for the shrinkage then in the fact that comparison was with 1909-10, when the Alaska-Yukon Pacific Exposition at Seattle had brought a temporary large increase in travel. The chief point we wish to make, however, is that the passenger business of 1912 was not up to the best of previous years. In face of the several drawbacks above enumerated, the Great Northern is able to report an increase in aggregate gross earnings for the twelve months of nearly $5,000,000—in exact figures, $4,940,186. The bulk of the increase has been in the freight revenues, and of this $2,793,352 was contributed by products of agriculture and $1,351,806 by products of mines. It is to be noted, too, that the expansion in freight revenues was made in face of declining rates. In tiie late fiscal year the average realized on the entire freight traffic of the system was only 7.688 mills per ton per mile, as against 8.096 mills per ton mile in 1911 and 8.219 mills per ton mile in 1910. The report tells us that this decline in the average revenue per ton mile resulted in part from an increase in the tonnage of lowrate commodities, such as grain, iron ore and coal, but in part also from certain rate reductions. Not all of the late year’s gain in aggregate gross earnings represents a recovery of what was lost the previous year. In fact, while the gain in 1912 was $4,940,186, the loss in 1911 was only $3,207,737, so the 1912 earnings are $1,732,449 in excess of those of 1910, and to say that is to say that they are to that 1012 THE C H R O N IC L E extent in excess of the largest previous earnings in the history of the company. This result has been achieved, as we have already seen, in face of the fact that a number of the conditions were not altogether favorable in the year under review. In the last analysis, however, it is the success of the management in holding down expenses that gives to the year’s results their distinguishing characteristic. The gain in gross earnings might have been attended by an augmentation in expenses of almost equal amount, leaving little or no gain in the net earnings, as has happened so frequently in recent years with large railroad systems generally throughout the United States. Instead of that, expenses were only increased a mere trifle, leaving practically the whole of the gain in the gross to be carried forward as a gain in the net. In other words, while gross revenues were in­ creased from $61,257,632 to $66,197,818, expenses moved up only from $37,600,391 to $37,662,547, leaving the net for 1912 $28,535,271, against only $23,657,241 for 1911. The Maintenance of W ay expenses were actually slightly reduced, following a large reduction in the previous year, the amount so expended for 1912 being $9,220,285, against $9,654,776 for 1911 and $11,773,314 in 1910. In explaining the large contraction under this head in the previous year, Louis W . Hill, who was then President, took occasion to point out that the smaller expenditures in that way did not indicate neglect of the property or unwise economy, but reflected the benefit of permanent work done in former years. Under the other leading heads, the expenditures of the late year show moderate increases. The trans­ portation expenses for 1912 were $18,200,010, against $18,052,818 in 1911. That the increase under this head should be so slight in face of higher wage schedules and in face of the fact that the number of tons of freight carried one mile was increased by 718,374,098 ton miles, speaks volumes for the steady advance in operating efficiency which is being maintained on this important railroad system. Turning to the train statistics, we find that this largely increased traffic, representing an addition of over 11% (and if we confined ourselves to the revenue freight traffic the increase would be over 16%), was handled with addition to freight-train mileage of only 1.34%, the miles run by the freight trains in 1912 having been 9,523,132, against 9,396,993 for 1911. The Great Northern has always been distinguished for its high average train-load, and in the late year its noteworthy record in this respect was carried a step further. The lading of the trains was increased by over 77 tons, or 14.81%, bringing the average up to above 600 tons— 601.113. In 1911 the average load was 524 tons, in 1910 518 tons and in 1909 502 tons. Thus, in three years there has been an addition, roughly, of 100 tons to the average train-load. Not only is the present average of 601 tons exceptionally high standing by itself, but it is the average, it should be remembered, on merely the revenue tonnage. If the freight moved for the company’s own use were included, the amount would be raised so as to bring the average train-load up to about 700 tons. Because of the larger average loads, the freight trains earned $4 62 per mile run in 1912, against $4 24 in 1911, notwithstanding that the rate realized in the latest year was only 7.688 mills per ton mile, against 8.096 mills per ton mile in 1911. With the expansion in net earnings, the income account for the twelve months presents a highly favor­ [VOL. LXXXXV. able exhibit. After providing for fixed charges, the income available on the operations of the twelve months was $21,654,254, while the 7% dividends on the com­ pany’s stock called for only $14,698,981, leaving a surplus above the dividend requirements in amount of almost $7,000,000. Out of this, $750,000 was appropriated to cover depreciation of steamship property and $3,502,000 was appropriated for the benefit of the fund for permanent improvements and betterments. Even after these deductions there remained $2,703,273, which was transferred to the credit of profit and loss. Besides the $750,000 charged against income for depreciation of steamships, a further sum of $2,650,000 was written off profit and loss for the same purpose, or more specifically, to cover depreciation of steamships of Great Northern Steam­ ship Co. and Northern Steamship Co. and net loss on steamship “ Dakota,” wrecked in 1907. There was no increase in the outstanding amount of stock or bonds during the twelve months. On the contrary, the funded debt in the hands of the public actually decreased $574,000 during the year; $6,818,­ 000 of refunding mortgage bonds were issued against construction and acquisition of property and securities, but the whole amount was added to the company’s treasury holdings, making the aggregate of these treasury holdings June 30 1912 $16,823,000. Though outstanding debt was not increased, $7,426,936 was expended in the construction of new lines, $2,317,990 was spent for additions and betterments, $2,052,237 was added to the company’s investments in Canadian companies, and some other purchases were made, such as the acquisition of the Everett & Cherry Valley Traction Co., at a cost of $1,056,600. Cash on hand, however, June 30 1912, was only $12,829,424, against $21,460,917 June 30 1911. In preceding years, it will be remembered, large additions were made to stock and debt. In 1911, for example, $35,000,000 of refunding mortgage 4*4$ were sold and in 1907 and 1908 no less than $60,000,000 new stock was issued. The year will remain noteworthy because with its close Mr. James J. Hill ended his active participation in the conduct of the property, which owes its existence to his indomitable pluck, energy and foresight. On July 1 1912 Mr. Hill resigned as Chairman of the Board and Mr. Louis W . Hill, previously President, was elected as his successor. Mr. James J. Hill at the same time delivered an address which is in the nature of a valedictory and a review of past achieve­ ments and what has been done to prepare the company for the needs and requirements of the future. The address is printed in full in the report, but we cannot forbear to quote a few very striking passages from it. We observe, for instance, that Mr. Hill has never accepted any salary for his services as President, or Chairman of the Board of Directors. Nor can the reader fail to be impressed with Mr. Hill’s statement— a statement which cannot be controverted— that the Great Northern Railway Co., including its predecessor, the St. Paul Minneapolis & Manitoba, “ never failed, never passed a dividend, never was financially inse­ cure in any time of panic” ; furthermore, that “ the success and prosperity that attend the company to-day have not been purchased either by any doubtful trans­ actions in the stock market or at the cost of one dollar ever committed by man or woman to this company in trust.” Starting with the bankrupt St. Paul & Pacific as a nucleus in 1878, it has grown into a trans­ continental system of about 7,500 miles of road. O ct. 19 1912 ] THE C H R O N IC L E The stock of the St. Paul Minneapolis & Manitoba was limited by its charter to $20,000,000. When the Great Northern lly. was organized in 1889 it took over the charter of the Minneapolis & St. Cloud Railway Co. The capital stock was made $20,000,000, which was afterwards increased to $40,000,000. There was a further increase to $45,000,000 in 1893 and to $75,­ 000,000 in 1898. In 1899 the amount became $99,000,000, in 1901 $125,000,000, in 1905 $150,000,­ 000 and in 1906 $210,000,000, though the new stock was not actually issued until 1907 and 1908. Mr. Hill says, with pardonable pride: “ Every dollar of this represents honest value received. But the problems of its issue and disposal, the creation of a market for its securities, the safeguarding of it against attack and its maintenance as an investment attractive and secure were difficult and slow of solution. The company has now acquired a standing which nothing in the ordinary course of events can impair.\" As to the future needs of the company provision for the same, as is known, has been made on a most comprehensive scale by the authorization of a refunding mortgage for a total authorized amount of $600,000,­ 000, the largest mortgage ever made by any corpora­ tion in the country. “ This issue of $600,000,000.in all,\" says Mr. Hill, “ stands to the big systems of to-day as a $50,000,000 of consolidated bonds did to the small system of twenty-eight years before.\" He adds further: “ It (the mortgage) creates a financial clearing house through which its several outstanding securities may be converted into one of standard form and value; and it forms, in addition, a reservoir of authorized credit so carefully guarded by the conditions of the mortgage that it cannot be abused or dissipated, yet so ample that it will supply all needs for probably fifty years to come.\" Dilating upon this latter point, Mr. Hill goes on to say: “ No private estate in this country is more carefully provided against the future than is the property of the Great Northern Railway Co. All prior mortgages become closed, and more than onehalf of the total $600,000,000 is to be used to redeem bonds issued under them and those issued by the com­ pany’s interests in the Burlington. Nearly $123,­ 000,000 may be used to cover the cost of other proper­ ties acquired or to be acquired; while $100,000,000 may be issued at not to exceed $3,000,000 per annum to cover the cost of future construction, acquisition and betterments.\" In closing it will be proper to quote the followingparagraph, which indicates the confidence felt by Mr. Hill in the continued prosperity of the property and his sublime faith in the future of the undertaking, which owes its existence so largely to his efforts. He says with much eloquence: “ The financial outlook of this company is as well assured as that of most govern­ ments. It has a provision made now, deliberately and not under any pressure of necessity, for the work of years to come. That provision may be utilized in lean years and held in suspense in fat years so as always to realize the best prices for securities and to keep the credit of the company unimpaired. No emergency can surprise it. It is financed for a period beyond which it would be fanciful to attempt to provide. And the development of its business throughout every part of the practically half a con­ tinent which it serves makes the payment of dividends on the stock as certain as that of its bond coupons. There has never been a default in either. There has never been a dollar’s worth of stock or bonds issued that was not paid for in cash, property or services 1013 at its actual cash value at the time. The stock has paid a dividend ever since 1882, and since 1900 the rate has remained steadily at 7 % .\" What gives particular value to this noteworthy declaration by Mr. Hill when yielding up his duties as the responsible head of the enterprise, is that it is absolutely impossible to gainsay any of the statements he here makes. RAILROAD GROSS AND NET EARNINGS FOR AUGUST. Our elaborate compilation of railroad earnings for the month of August makes an even better showing than did the similar compilation for the month of July. It is evident^that, aided by the present season’s bounteous harvests, we have now entered upon a period of recovery in railroad revenues following the long antecedent period of decline— a decline which was not so noticeable in the case of the gross as it was in the case of the net, owing to the augmentation in expenses caused by higher wage-schedules and the general rise in expenses. How long the recovery will last no one can tell, since so much depends upon the treatment the railroad carrying interest is to re­ ceive at the hands of the Inter-State Commerce Com­ mission and the influence of legislation upon general business conditions. The recovery should, in any event, continue until the end of the current fiscal year ending June 30 1913, unless the outcome of the Presi­ dential election next month shall have a disturbing or retarding effect, or some other untoward event now unforeseen should happen. What is especially encouraging about the present August statement is that there is satisfactory improve­ ment in the net earnings as well as the gross earnings. Heretofore, rising expenses have consumed the greater part of the gains in gross and often the additions to expenses have exceeded in amount the additions to gross revenues. That is still true even in August as far as some important roads and systems are con­ cerned. It is not true as concerns the roads col­ lectively. Briefly speaking, our tabulations to-day for the month of August, covering 239,230 miles of road show that gross earnings have increased no less than $25,860,384, that of this, $14,434,918 was con­ sumed by augmented expenses, leaving, therefore, an increase of $11,425,466 in net. In ratio the im­ provement in gross is 10.30% and in the net 13.03%, as will be seen by the following summary: /n c .(+ ) or DccX—) August (457 roads)— 1912. 1911.

In addition many Western roads had the advantage of a larger grain movement, though, on the other hand, some of the Southern roads suffered from a contraction in the cotton movement. As already stated, comparison is with unfavorable results in the yearn immediately preceding. In August last year there was a falling off in both gross and net earnings, though not very large in either case. Our statement, then, comprising 230,536 miles of road, registered $1,967,695 decrease in gross and $595,069 decrease in net. In August 1910 the results were satisfactory enough as far as the gross was concerned but the net recorded a decrease, owing to the great rise in expenses. According to the summary furnished by the Inter-State Commerce Commission'and covering THE 1014 C H R O N IC L E 238,493 miles of road, there [was a gain of $18,279,972 in gross but attended by an increase of $18,939,835 in expenses, thus producing $659,803 loss in net. In August of the year before (1909) there was material improvement in both gross and net, but this followed from the circumstance that in the previous year (1908) succeeding the panic of 1907, there had been tre­ mendous losses. According to the tabulations of the Inter-State Commerce Commission, the gain for August 1909 reached $29,682,863 in gross and $15,­ 065,001 in net. In August 1908 the decrease in gross, by the figures of the Inter-State Commerce Commission, reached no less than $34,366,578 and there was also a decrease of $9,222,389 in net. In the table we now present we furnish the August comparisons back to 1896. For 1910, 1909 and 1908 we use the Inter-State Commerce totals, but for preceding years we give the results just as registered by our own tables each year — a portion of the railroad mileage of the country being always unrepresented in the totals, owing to the refusal of some of the roads in those days to furnish monthly figures for publication.
