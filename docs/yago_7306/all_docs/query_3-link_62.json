        "text": "Nathan Lane\n\nAmerican actor\n\nQuick Facts\n\nOriginal name:\n\nJoseph Lane\n\nBorn:\n\nFebruary 3, 1956, Jersey City, New Jersey, U.S. (age 68)\n\nAwards And Honors:\n\nTony Awards\n\nTony Award (2018): Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role in a Play\n\nTony Award (2018): Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role in a Play\n\nTony Award (2001): Best Actor in a Musical\n\nTony Award (1996): Best Actor in a Musical\n\nNathan Lane (born February 3, 1956, Jersey City, New Jersey, U.S.) is an American stage, film, and television actor, best known for his work in musical comedies, notably the Broadway production of The Producers.\n\nLane discovered his flair for musical comedy when he appeared in a high-school production of No, No, Nanette, and after graduation he embarked on a career in theater. Among his early productions was a dinner-theater staging of Guys and Dolls, in which he played Nathan Detroit. When he was about to join Actors’ Equity and learned that there was already a Joe Lane in the membership, he took that character’s first name.\n\nEarly career\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nLane moved to New York City in the late 1970s. There he appeared in some Off-Broadway productions, and—in addition to taking odd jobs to help support himself—put together a comedy act with another actor, Patrick Stark. The team, known as Stark and Lane, spent more than two years performing in nightclubs and as the opening act at concerts in Los Angeles, before Lane returned to New York.\n\nLane had a part in a short-lived 1982 television sitcom, One of the Boys, and shortly thereafter he was cast in a Broadway production of the Noël Coward play Present Laughter. Such plays as Love and She Stoops to Conquer (both in 1984) followed, and in 1987 Lane made his motion picture debut in Ironweed. An Off-Broadway role in Terrence McNally’s The Lisbon Traviata (1989) attracted critical praise, as did his performances in McNally’s Lips Together, Teeth Apart (1991) and the film Frankie and Johnny (1991). In 1992 he reprised his role in Guys and Dolls, this time on Broadway. The following year Lane’s stage performance in the Neil Simon comedy Laughter on the 23rd Floor received rave reviews.\n\nThe Lion King, The Birdcage, and The Producers\n\nLane further charmed audiences with his voicing of the meerkat Timon in the animated film The Lion King (1994), his performance in McNally’s play Love! Valour! Compassion! (1994), and his role as the drag queen Albert in the movie The Birdcage (1996), opposite Robin Williams. Lane then went on to play the lead character Pseudolus in a Broadway revival of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1996), a performance that garnered him his first Tony Award. In 1999–2000 he provided a voice for the animated television series George and Martha, and in 2000 he appeared onstage in The Man Who Came to Dinner as well as in television productions of that play and of Laughter on the 23rd Floor.\n\nLane came out publicly as gay in 1999, shortly after the brutal murder of Matthew Shepard, which drew calls for an expansion of federal hate crime law to protect LGBTQ+ victims. He later recounted that Shepard’s death “was an incredibly sobering moment” for him, reflecting, “I’d already come out on a personal level, why not come out publicly now that I was the so-called public figure if it might be meaningful to others in the struggle. So I did, and I’m glad I did.” In 2002 Lane received the GLAAD Vito Russo Award for his outstanding contribution in combating homophobia.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The production, which also starred Matthew Broderick, broke sales records, and Lane received a Tony for his performance; he also starred in the 2005 film adaptation. After a year, Lane left the Broadway production but later returned (with Broderick) in 2003–04. His subsequent theater work included Trumbo (2003), Butley (2003, 2006–07), and Dedication or the Stuff of Dreams (2005).\n\nStage productions\n\nFrom 2005 to 2006 Lane appeared in a remake of Simon’s The Odd Couple, and in 2008 he starred in David Mamet’s November, portraying a president on the eve of an election. The following year Lane played Estragon in a well-received Broadway revival of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, and in 2010–11 he starred in the musical The Addams Family. The next year Lane played Theodore Hickman in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago; the show traveled to New York in 2015.\n\nLane returned to Broadway in The Nance (2013) as a closeted gay man in the 1930s who performs a caricature of homosexuality as a burlesque routine. In 2014–15 Lane and Broderick appeared in an updated production of Terrence McNally’s It’s Only a Play, which explored the dynamics of Broadway theater production. Lane next starred as a pugnacious newspaper editor in a revival (2016–17) of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur’s The Front Page.\n\nHe then was cast as controversial lawyer Roy Cohn in Angels in America, a revival of Tony Kushner’s drama that centers on the AIDS epidemic. Lane starred in the play’s London staging (2017) before reprising the role on Broadway (2018). For his work in the latter production, Lane won his third Tony Award. In 2019 he starred in the Broadway production of Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus, a dark comedy set in the aftermath of William Shakespeare’s first tragedy.\n\nLater film and television credits\n\nLane’s additional film credits in the 21st century included The Nutcracker in 3D (2010), based on Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s popular ballet, and Mirror Mirror (2012), a comedic version of the Snow White tale. Although a pair of sitcoms in which he starred (1998–99, 2003) were short-lived, he enjoyed recurring roles on the television series The Good Wife and Modern Family in the 2010s. He played defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey in the television serial drama The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story (2016), about the titular trial of former professional gridiron football player O.J. Simpson for the murder of his ex-wife and her friend in 1994.\n\nLane later appeared as a detective investigating the murder of a family in Penny Dreadful: City of Angels (2020), a noirish horror series set in Los Angeles in 1938. He later had recurring roles on Only Murders in the Building (2021–) and The Gilded Age (2022–).\n\nIn 2024 Lane was honored with the career achievement award at the Critics Choice Association’s inaugural Celebration of LGBTQ+ Cinema & Television.\n\nBarbara Whitney"
