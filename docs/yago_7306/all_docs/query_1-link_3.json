A chiseled, heroic action figure, Speed saves lives on paper, but when a young girl is kidnapped and her sister (Karen Kopins) begs the real-life Speed for help, he must find a way to be as gallant as the book hero whose creation he's inspired. Accompanied by the victim's sibling, Speed flies to Africa to see if he's up to the task.",

        "text": "When his granddaughter goes missing, an old man's tenuous grasp on reality melts away, as he fantasies about her rescue by a character from one of his pulp adventure books... in reality she is long dead, and the form of dementia he's suffering from means he'll be joining her shortly.\n\nThey don't return to the grandfather character from the opening minutes (or character actors Millie Perkins, Monte Markham, Barry Primus, Leon Ames or Ken Lerner - it has a really wonderful cast in this one scene) but its as likely a scenario as fading to white meaning that Quaid was lobotomized. Its safe to say I'm a pretty cynical viewer, and the premise for this film requires some fairly large…\n\nPOTENTIALLY TAKES PLACE IN THE SAME UNIVERSE AS REMO WILLIAMS THIS IS ENORMOUS NEWS\n\nSo it's kinda like a dimestore Romancing the Stone meets a G-League Last Action Hero, set in a world where Doc Savage, Mack Bolan, and Remo Williams (aka The Destroyer) exist. Presumably Dirk Pitt and even Richard Camelion (aka the Death Merchant) are out there getting up to shit. Maybe even my man Court Gentry (aka the Gray Man) was toddling around, waiting until he was old enough to start snapping bad guy necks. It begs the premise of The Paperback Avengers. The possibilities are endless.\n\nExhibit 266-C in my ongoing litigation against digital color correction and compositing: This totally forgotten fourth-rate Indiana Jones cash-in made…\n\nRomancing The Stone rip-off.\n\nJake Speed : Sometimes you do things the hard way.\n\nMargaret Winston : Why?\n\nJake Speed : Reads better.\n\nJake speed (Wayne Crawford) is a mixture of the novelist Joan Wilder and adventurer Jack from Romancing the Stone. Jake and his sidekick Sid (Dennis Christopher - the Danny DeVito character from Romancing the Stone) are looking for adventures. To cash in on their efforts, they create novelizations of their own adventures. This time around they engage Margaret (Karen Hopkins - the rest of Kathleen Turner's character) to look for her abducted sister Maureen (Becca C. Ashley). Margaret at first has a hard time believing that the character from the pulp novels her grandfather likes, is real.…\n\nYou've all heard of hybrid vigor, right? The phenomenon that describes the amplification of genetic traits through the combination of parental DNA. Right. Jake Speed is a character born from the DNA of Indiana Jones and James Bond. And the result of this hybrid vigor is Simon Baker without any charm, wit or charisma. Wayne Crawford might be the poor-man's Bryan Brown. Except worse than that.\n\nThe sets look like a high school stage production, and the dialogue is filled with zippy nonsensical one-liners like:\n\n“Why do you think bad things happen? So you can have something good to look forward to.” #JakeSpeedWisdom\n\nIt's not only that Wayne Crawford's more of a socially-awkward mailman when he's supposed to be Michael…"
