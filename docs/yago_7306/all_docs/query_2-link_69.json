        "text": "“Sure he’s real. Everybody knows that. In fact, I play cards with him every Thursday night. Me, Jake Speed, Batman – thanks – oh, Sherlock Holmes and, once in a while, Superman stops in. ” – Newsstand Attendant\n\nNumber of Times Seen – 3-5 times (cable in the 80’s and 1 Mar 2016)\n\nBrief Synopsis – After her sister is kidnapped while vacationing in Europe, a woman enlists the help of a fictional adventurer to help her find and rescue her.\n\nMy Take on it – This is a movie that I recall really enjoying as a kid and was quite disappointed that it didn’t live up to my memories of it.\n\nThis movie feels too often like it’s trying too hard to be a modern Indiana Jones type of adventure but it comes across as too campy to work. It might have worked much better for an 80’s crowd, but it doesn’t stand up so well after 30 years.\n\nI have to still give this movie credit for an interesting premise which could possibly be reused now to better effect.\n\nBottom Line – Not as fun as it was when I saw this as a kid. The premise is interesting tho. Has a very 80’s vibe to it which doesn’t quite hold up 30 years on.\n\nMovieRob’s Favorite Trivia – A novelization, written under the pseudonym Reno Melon, Jake and Des’ writing nom de plume, was published on June 1, 1986, by Gold Eagle/Harlequin (From Wikipedia)\n\nRating – BAFTA Worthy\n\n_______________________________________\n\nCheck out my *updated* movie stats here\n\nTo see my reviews of Oscar Winning Performances check out this link\n\nTo see my reviews of all Oscar Best Picture Winners click here (now complete)"
