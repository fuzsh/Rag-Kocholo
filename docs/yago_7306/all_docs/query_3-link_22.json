        "text": "Andrew Lane\n\nAndrew Lane is the author of the best-selling Young Sherlock Holmes books. These have been published around the world and are available in 37 different languages. Not only is he a life-long fan of Arthur Conan Doyle's great detective, he is also an expert on the books and is the only children's writer endorsed by the Sherlock Holmes Conan Doyle estate. Lost Worlds, the second series Andrew has written for children, is inspired by another famous Conan Doyle novel, The Lost World. Andrew's main character, Calum Challenger, is the grandson of Conan Doyle's protagonist, Professor George Edward Challenger.\n\nAndrew also writes outside the genre, including adult thrillers (under a pseudonym), TV adaptations (including Dr Who) and non-fiction books (about things as wide-ranging as James Bond and Wallace & Gromit). He lives in Dorset with his wife and son and a vast collection of Sherlock Holmes books, the first of which he found in a jumble sale over forty years ago."
