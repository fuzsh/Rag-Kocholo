        "text": "The “Anna’s Wish” actress will be honored on May 4, 2014, during a ceremony in Los Angeles. Berry, who has already made a name for herself starring in a film “Cry From Within” to be screened at Cannes Film Festival, will be feted for her standout achievement as a actress in the short film. “Anna’s Wish” was featured at the Calgary Underground Film Festival in 2013 and was recognized for superior acting performances.\n\nBerry, 12, expresses her gratitude for the nomination in a statement that reads: \"Acting has always been my first passion, so receiving this nomination is a true honor for me. I've been pursuing a career as actress since I was little, and I’m so excited to be coming to Los Angeles for these awards.\"\n\nReferred to as the Oscar Awards for kids, the Young Artist Awards have honored other famous young actors including Drew Barrymore, Jason Bateman and Jackie Coogan.\n\nBerry recently appeared on CityTV Calgary to promote her films and her spoken word debut CD release in June 2014 and was also the cover of Avant Garde Magazine in February 2014.\n\nAngel Berry is no stranger to success and has already accomplished more than most adults. She published a children’s book called “Ladybug” in April 2014. In 2013, she signed with multi-platinum music producer, Andrew Lane, and partnered with him to write and produce a song dedicated to those who suffered from damage sustained in the recent tsunami in the Philippines. The song is called “Strong.” Her music video “Today I Learned” was just published and has garnered over 11,000 views on Angel's YouTube.\n\nAndrew Lane is a pop/hip-hop/R&B songwriter and music producer who has worked with artists such as the Backstreet Boys and Irene Cara. As a producer and songwriter, Lane has received gold and platinum accreditations for his work with R&B artists Keith Sweat, Speech and Mary J. Blige. He was also a major contributor to the platinum-accredited records High School Musical, Hannah Montana and Disneymania. Lane also won a Billboard Award in 2012.\n\nFor more info on Angel Berry, visit:\n\nOfficial Web Site"
