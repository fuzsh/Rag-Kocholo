While the Freddies still lay down an acoustic foundation, World Come Clean builds a bigger sound with layers of drums, electric guitar & bass, and string quartet. And while Jake Speed’s songwriting will always hearken back to Woody Guthrie, the 11 selections on this album speak in a less literal, more metaphoric voice.\n\nRead more…\n\n0:00/???\n\nRed-Haired Girl 2:38\n\nYour price\n\nRed-Haired Girl\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/2:38\n\nWorld Come Clean 3:55\n\nYour price\n\nWorld Come Clean\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:55\n\nGoodnight Moon 3:34\n\nYour price\n\nGoodnight Moon\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:34\n\nA Midsummer's Nightmare 4:41\n\nYour price\n\nA Midsummer's Nightmare\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/4:41\n\nAin't Saved Enough 3:48\n\nYour price\n\nAin't Saved Enough\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:48\n\nDevil In My Backyard 3:19\n\nYour price\n\nDevil In My Backyard\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:19\n\nGrinnin' In Your Face 3:53\n\nYour price\n\nGrinnin' In Your Face\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:53\n\nJohn Hartford Waltz 2:56\n\nYour price\n\nJohn Hartford Waltz\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/2:56\n\nNew Hands of Change 2:19\n\nYour price\n\nNew Hands of Change\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/2:19\n\nThe Mines 3:19\n\nYour price\n\nThe Mines\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:19\n\nRube Waddell 4:10\n\nYour price\n\nRube Waddell\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/4:10\n\nLosantaville\n\nJake Speed & The Freddies\n\nDownload\n\nLosantaville\n\nAlbum download\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\nVISIT THIS LINK TO PURCHASE FULL ALBUM: https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/jakespeed4\n\nLosantaville, a collection of 6 original Freddies Christmas tunes and 4 Santa-suited carols, jingle-jangles with Jesus-free images of top-of-the-steps Christmas Day excitement.

(including local Bluegrass all stars, Katie Laur and Ed Cunningham) gives the album a chance to cheer in so many different voices. One minute, it’ll round third and head for home with “Old Man Joe,” while the next minute it’ll serenely sail along the banks with “Ohio River Waltz.” It’ll poke fun at politics on “First Street Fell,” and then pray peacefully on “Fare Thee Well.” Typewriters, Watering Cans, and Washboards strike up with the rest of the band’s fiddles, guitars, banjos, basses, and harmonicas, making Huzzah! the most tossed around sound Jake Speed & the Freddies have struck so far.\n\nRead more…\n\n0:00/???\n\nOhio River Blues 5:12\n\nYour price\n\nOhio River Blues\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/5:12\n\nOhio River Waltz 4:23\n\nYour price\n\nOhio River Waltz\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/4:23\n\nLeaving Cincinnati 3:19\n\nYour price\n\nLeaving Cincinnati\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:19\n\nTalkin' F-Word Blues 9:08\n\nYour price\n\nTalkin' F-Word Blues\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/9:08\n\nMarvelous You 3:34\n\nYour price\n\nMarvelous You\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:34\n\nVolvo Girl 4:38\n\nYour price\n\nVolvo Girl\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/4:38\n\nFare Thee Well 4:56\n\nYour price\n\nFare Thee Well\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/4:56\n\nStreetvibes Rag 3:16\n\nYour price\n\nStreetvibes Rag\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:16\n\nFirst Street Fell 3:36\n\nYour price\n\nFirst Street Fell\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:36\n\nSong for Libba 2:58\n\nYour price\n\nSong for Libba\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/2:58\n\nYour price\n\nSittin' On Top of the World\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/2:16\n\nTear It Down Rag 2:39\n\nYour price\n\nTear It Down Rag\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/2:39\n\nPoor Johnny 4:14\n\nYour price\n\nPoor Johnny\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/4:14\n\nYour price\n\nHard Times Come No More\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:09\n\nYour price\n\nHard Times At My Door\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:12\n\nThe Cincinnati Legends of Jeremiah Schmidt\n\nJake Speed\n\nDownload\n\nThe Cincinnati Legends of Jeremiah Schmidt\n\nAlbum download\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\nVISIT THIS LINK TO PURCHASE FULL ALBUM: https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/jakespeed2\n\nThe Cincinnati Legends of Jeremiah Schmidt is a collection of songs based on the handwritten stories of a long-dead Cincinnati native named Jeremiah Schmidt. Schmidt’s legends (found by Speed and later adapted into songs) highlight such Cincinnati tales as the ghost of the subway, the tragedy of the 1937 flood, the heroism of brewer Christian Moerlein, and the witch in the Mill Creek. The song arrangements range from solo guitar and vocal to full bluegrass ensemble. While some of the Freddies are present on the album, this project is a solo one for Jake Speed.\n\nRead more…\n\n0:00/???\n\n0:00/5:40\n\nPeanut Jim 2:36\n\n0:00/2:36\n\nYour price\n\nThe Ghost of Henry Thomas Hunt\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:59\n\nAnderson Ferry 2:27\n\nYour price\n\nAnderson Ferry\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/2:27\n\nMaggie, Don't You Weep 3:52\n\nYour price\n\nMaggie, Don't You Weep\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:52\n\nAnderson Ferry 2:27\n\nYour price\n\nAnderson Ferry\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/2:27\n\nCruel, Cruel World 3:15\n\nYour price\n\nCruel, Cruel World\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:15\n\nFlood of '37 4:58\n\nYour price\n\nFlood of '37\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/4:58\n\nThe Great Moselle 3:57\n\nYour price\n\nThe Great Moselle\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:57\n\nMaggie, Don't You Weep 3:52\n\nYour price\n\nMaggie, Don't You Weep\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:52\n\nRailroad Penny 4:59\n\nYour price\n\nRailroad Penny\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/4:59\n\nRun Jacob Run 3:01\n\nYour price\n\nRun Jacob Run\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:01\n\nRunnin' & Roamin' 3:14\n\nYour price\n\nRunnin' & Roamin'\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/3:14\n\nYour price\n\nWitch of the Mill Creek\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\n0:00/5:50\n\nQueen City Rag\n\nJake Speed & The Freddies\n\nDownload\n\nQueen City Rag\n\nAlbum download\n\nPlease choose a price: $ USD ($0.00 or more)\n\nPlease choose a price:\n\nOut of stock Download\n\nVISIT THIS LINK TO PURCHASE FULL ALBUM: https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/jakespeed1\n\nThe songs that my banjo picks and my washboard kicks and my harp hums and my guitar strums are songs that hop freights, run rivers, ride ferries, and hit hard roads.

They're songs that can fistfight, jig dance, whiskey sip, belly flip; songs about hard times, good times, just-sorta-in-between times, times when you can't quit laughing even though you ain't got a dime to dip out of your pocket. These songs that I sing in and around and up and cross-legged and eastbound and right-side-up are about honest folks who are trying to keep out of jails, fights, blackjack hands, drunken head stands, gunslings and nooserings, busted lips and broken hearts. Some of the songs ain't got no other job than to make your outsides wiggle, your hips jiggle, your lips sizzle. And some of the songs need to curl up on the thinkingest, contemplatingest, debatingest, worryingest, opinionatedest part of your brain that you oughtn't let rot away (you'll be needing it someday, I'll say). I never have tried to sing the down right prettiest song or cuddliest song or obscure lyric kind of a song. I don't aim to confuse misconstrue lead astray cast away or engage in any other discriminating way that winds up dividing me the singer from you the person.
