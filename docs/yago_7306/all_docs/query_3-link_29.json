        "text": "Hero Fiennes Tiffin is set to play a young Sherlock Holmes, and we are ready for it. In case you didn’t already know, this writer is a fan of Tiffin, and I will watch anything he’s in because he’s a great actor. I am also a fan of Sherlock Holmes’s world. I’ve seen a few movies and shows here and there. But I must admit I have not read the books (Don’t shame me). I have them on my TBR and have planned to read them for a long time, and this just gave me a fantastic excuse to crack them open finally.\n\nThe series, Young Sherlock, is based on Andrew Lane’s eight-book series of the same name and has been ordered by Amazon Prime Video. According to Deadline, Young Sherlock is described as an action-packed origin story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s beloved detective in an explosive reimagining of this iconic character. At age 19, Sherlock Holmes is disgraced, raw, unfiltered, and unformed when he finds himself caught up in a murder mystery at Oxford University, threatening his freedom. Diving into his first-ever case with a wild lack of discipline, Sherlock unravels a globe-trotting conspiracy that will change his life forever.\n\nThis already sounds very exciting to us. We love a good origin story because who wouldn’t want to see how Sherlock Holmes became Detective Sherlock Holmes? Guy Ritchie, with whom Tiffin previously worked on The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, will direct and executive produce the series. Ritchie is no stranger to Sherlock Holmes, having directed two films about the detective, with Robert Downey Jr. starring as Holmes in the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes and the 2011 film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Matthew Parkhill (Deep State, Rogue) will act as writer, showrunner, and executive producer."
