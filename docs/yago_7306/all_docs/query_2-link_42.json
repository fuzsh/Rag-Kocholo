In this case, I think Jake Speed's the man for the job.\n\nJake Speed:\n\nIf all this were about money, I'd be working for the wrong side most of the time.\n\nMargaret Winston:\n\nI didn't know you had that!\n\nJake Speed:\n\nThat's why they call it a concealed weapon.\n\nMargaret Winston:\n\nWhat if you sold me to the wrong Gus?\n\nJake Speed:\n\nThat would make a piss-poor story, wouldn't it?\n\nMargaret Winston:\n\nIf you're such a big deal, why haven't they ever made a movie?\n\nJake Speed:\n\nEver try to deal with those people?\n\nJake Speed:\n\nWe were gonna fight our way through enemy territory. Scale the highest mountain in this goddamned place. Traverse a bridge that was about to collapse. And then if we were lucky, I mean really lucky, we were gonna fight our way through two thousand extremely poisonous snakes.\n\nMargaret Winston:\n\nThere are thousands of snakes around here?\n\nJake Speed:\n\nThere's gotta be if you look hard enough!"
