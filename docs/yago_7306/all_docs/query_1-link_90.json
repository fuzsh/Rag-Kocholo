I had totally forgot about Jake Speed. That was a great B-flick. :thumbsup I think his side arm was a saw off, pistol gripped Remington 1100.\n\n[/b]\n\nCorrect, it was a conversion of a Remington 1100, that was made for military and law enforcement. They named it the Sidewinder. The recoil assembly was moved from the shoulderstock to the front of the shotgun. It was very popular in movies, and tv shows in the 80s. It was Sam Jones's 'pistol' in \"The Highwayman\", and it was Clarence Boddicker's shotgun in \"RoboCop\", although his had an extending shoulderstock. They also made one with a removible box magazine.\n\nI really liked \"Jake Speed\", and was sorry that they didn't make any others.\n\nDavid."
