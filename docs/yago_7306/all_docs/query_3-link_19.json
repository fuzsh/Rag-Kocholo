        "text": "Book Synopsis\n\nIn Fire Storm by Andrew Lane, young Sherlock's friend and her father have vanished. Their house looks as if nobody has ever lived in it; the neighbors claim never to have heard of them. Sherlock begins to doubt his sanity, until a clever clue points him to Scotland. Following that clue leads him into a mystery that involves kidnapping, bodysnatchers, and a man who claims he can raise the dead. Only the budding detective Sherlock can untangle the mind-bending--and dangerous--puzzles that ensnare his friends. Think you know Sherlock Holmes? Think again!\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"Fans of the previous books will devour it; new readers to the series will have no problem diving in.\" --Kirkus Reviews\n\n\"Purists will applaud.\" --The Wall Street Journal on Death Cloud \"Action-packed and detail-oriented.\" --Los Angeles Times on Death Cloud \"Remarkable.\" --The New York Times Book Review on Death Cloud \"For a reader who has outgrown the Hardy Boys' adventures but still seeks mystery-solving plots.\" --Chicago Tribune on Death Cloud \"A rollicking good read.\" --Kirkus Reviews on Death Cloud \"What a blast.
