        "text": "December 19, 2011\n\nI'm going to put this book in the 'not bad, but could have been better' classification. I have my own perceptions about how young Sherlock Holmes would be and this one isn't real close to my ideas. Yeah, I'm not sure I can clarify that right now, so I won't try. I just found the book disappointing in how it did craft young Holmes.\n\nI did like the fact that Holmes has a mentor in an American who brings to mind a cross between Mark Twain and Wyatt Earp/Doc Holiday. Mr. Crow helps to develop Holmes' signature traits, deductive reasoning and a keenly analytical mind. It was interesting seeing how Holmes went from being a 'whatever/why is this important?' kid to the man who has an insatiable curiosity about the world and the burning desire to solve any puzzle that he encounters. I also liked Holmes' sidekick Matty Arnett. I have a feeling he will be accompanying Sherlock on more adventures in this series, and I'm very cool with that. I'd also like to see more of Mr. Crow. His daughter, Virginia, doesn't have quite as concrete a role, other than the horse-mad hoyden, would-be love interest, and perhaps, her tendency to bring out the impulsive adventurer in Sherlock.\n\nWhat surprised me was how violent this book is. Personally, I would be wary about letting a child younger than thirteen read this. There are some fairly descriptive acts of brutality that I think would be a bit much for a younger reader. I was concerned that the exceedingly villainous bad guys who would torture a kid with a bullwhip in a book for a younger audience. It's a pretty drawn out scene too. Not to mention a nasty fist fight that Sherlock finds himself involved in, along with numerous altercations with the Big Bad's minions who have no qualms about murdering youngsters.\n\nThe main bad guy is suitably majestic, and really quite outre' in his madness and character quirks, almost over the top, in fact. I guess that could be fun, but his bombastic speech about wreaking vengeance against the British Empire was a bit tedious. Sometimes I get impatient with the \"I am an Evil Overlord\" speeches.\n\nA big issue I did have was the pacing. I don't know. It just seemed uneven. I liked the action bits, for the most part, but I wasn't keen on how long it took Sherlock to figure things out. I realize that he's a young kid and he's just in the beginning of his long career as a detective, but I think he could have been a bit brighter in some circumstances. Happily, there is a good progression in his character over the course of the book.\n\nYeah, I know it, it's a problem of having too high expectations. Why do I do that to myself? That can burst a bubble or two for a reader. Would I recommend this? Hmmm, only if you really want to read about a young Sherlock Holmes, and your expectations aren't too grand. If you happen to be at the library and you can't find another book with a young detective to read, then you could reach for this one and it wouldn't be too much of a waste of your free time to read.\n\nOverall rating: 3.25/5.00 stars.\n\nMarch 19, 2018\n\nIch glaube ich hatte einfach zu hohe Erwartungen an dieses Buch. Ich liebe Sherlock Holmes einfach und dieser junge Sherlock konnte dem richtigen einfach nicht das Wasser reichen. Der Schreibstil hat mich nicht überzeugt und mir hat dieser typische Sherlock gefehlt. Der junge Sherlock muss wohl erst noch zu dem SHerlock werden, den wir kennen, aber auch so war er mir leider zu blass und konnte mich nicht so richtig von sich überzeugen. Auch Spannung kam leider nur wenig auf, daher werde ich diese Reihe leider nicht weiterlesen und mich lieber wieder Büchern widmen, in denen Sherlock schon erwachsen ist und seine typische Art schon vorhanden. :)\n\nMay 16, 2016\n\nA book recounting the childhood of Sherlock Holmes should be fascinating, witty, clever, and interesting. Death Cloud is none of those things. Sherlock Holmes has endured in popularity because of his unique personality--but Andrew Lane doesn't give his Holmes any personality at all. In my mind, a young Sherlock would be much like Alan Bradley's Flavia de Luce: brash, brilliant, and imaginative with a thirst for knowledge and adventure. According to Lane, however, Holmes never showed any particular affinity for fact-gathering curiosity until he was fourteen. This Sherlock Holmes is not only unrecognizable from Sherlock Holmes, but also undistinguishable from any other hero in any other teen detective story.\n\nTo make matters worse, Lane feels the need to pad the novel with repetitive fights, duels, kidnappings, and other action movie set pieces. Parts of the book feel like reading the walkthrough to a particularly weird video game. While Death Cloud could have been something special, it turns out to be elementary in all the wrong ways.\n\nShelved as 'to-not-read-ever'\n\nFebruary 24, 2011\n\n[image error]\n\nIt's elementary, my dear Usher.\n\n\"To Justin Bieber she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Robyn Rihanna Fenty. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his swooping, precise but admirably balanced bangs.\n\nHe was, I take it, the most perfect grin flashing and eyelash-fluttering machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a 'oh, that's cool, you know, girl' and a blush. They were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for drawing the veil from Bieb's motives and actions. But for the trained media icon to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted image was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his marketability.\n\nGrit in a tight-fitting white leather pantsuit, or a crack in one of his own prepubescent vocal runs, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was Robyn Rihanna Fenty, of dubious and questionable memory, and she is like a million years older than him anyway.\"\n\nRead\n\nMay 17, 2016\n\nОсвежаваща смесица от юношеските романи от детството ми и съвременен YA подгод на писане :) Не очаквах нищо от книгата, а получих една приятна доза носталгия и отмора :)\n\nApril 12, 2012\n\nI find Sherlock Holmes MUCH more interesting as an extremely educated, arrogant drug-using eccentric than as a smart, highly coiffed, but not-particularly-peculiar teenager. But then, what can you expect when Sherlock appears to be a Justin Bieber clone on the cover of the book? I know Sherlock, and the Bieb is not him.\n\nThe set up: Fourteen-year-old Sherlock is left to his own devices when he is sent to spend school holiday with a distant aunt and uncle. He explores the surrounding woods and meets a boy, Matty, whose only home is a canal boat. And there are a couple of mysterious deaths that require investigation.\n\nThe story doesn't get interesting until an unconventional American with tracking skills comes onto the scene as a tutor for Sherlock. You know things aren't working when the adult characters are more interesting than the teen ones in a YA book.\n\nThings pick up in the last third of the book, when the plot thickens and the mystery reveals a wonderfully weird villain. Again, more interesting than Sherlock Bieber.\n\nMy main complaint was how ordinary teen Sherlock was here. You'd expect this kid to have some quirks, but no. He's a good listener and resourceful, but I didn't see any sign of the adult Sherlock's personality. Where was the impatience with those less quick on the uptake? The misogyny? The love of disguise? The book does hint at how Sherlock later took to using drugs recreationally, but other than that, I sensed nothing of the famous detective's character.\n\nNot bad, there was reasonable action, and some fun chase scenes around London, but not great, either.\n\nDecember 9, 2018\n\nHave you ever met a Sherlock who is dumb as a doorknob? No? Well, this is your chance!\n\nSherlock is sent away to spend the summer holidays with his aunt and uncle, because his entire family is too sick, too busy, or too AWOL to bother with him. He makes friends with a random street boy, Matty Arnatt. He also gets an American tutor called Amycus Crow and falls for his daughter, Virginia. When two men die under similar circumstances, the game is afoot. All this sounds like good stuff, but it isn't really.\n\nSherlock is dumb as a brick and can't string two thoughts together. At the age of 14, I was much, much smarter and more knowledgeable than this idiot. And I am nowhere compared to the real Sherlock! Every other character in the book appears to be smarter than Sherlock. In fact, his main skill appears to be a tendency to fight his way out physically out of trouble. Not interested! Sherlock, as envisaged by Lane, appears to be a lower than average teenager with neither wit, intellect, knowledge, or the thirst for it. He also has the personality of a sheep.\n\nMatty is another wasted character. As the sidekick of Sherlock, I expected him to be interesting and somewhat sympathetic in contrast to a witty and acerbic Sherlock. But what happens when Sherlock is dumb and boring? Then the sidekick is slightly smarter but annoying. He too has no personality worth speaking of.\n\nIn Sherlock Manor, Sherlock makes the acquaintance of Mrs. Eglantine - a delightful character you believe would turn out to be relevant and interesting. But no, that just goes nowhere. All she does is stand in dark corners and glare at Sherlock. And behaves in the most un-housekeeper-like manner. Anyone who properly understood British class structure of this period would have had her thrown out with no references right away. But obviously not Andy Lane.\n\nThe only two slightly decent characters are American. The bounty hunter turned tutor, Amycus Crowe and his daughter. Amycus Crowe could actually have been Sherlock as he has the required intellect and the thirst for knowledge.\n\nAnd finally, the plot. Hee hee haw haw! Please! What an insult to our intellect. So there is this broken man pulled by strings by his servants so that he can move around. WTF? He is using bees to bring down the mighty British Empire. WTF again? For one thing, this is really impossible. For another, why are said servants so loyal to him? Where is he getting all this support to overthrow an Empire? Why isn't a more able-bodied person taking over if it has developed into such a large movement? The Baron takes the cake for being the most ridiculous villain ever.\n\nAnd mostly, I was in favour of the downfall of the Empire. Why not? Most people would have been in sympathy with the Baron's motives. He would be a hero if he succeeded. This notion would have worked in Conan Doyle's time but most emphatically fails to arouse sympathy with Sherlock and his cohorts when its a modern author writing for modern audiences. So, fuck off, Sherlock! Yay, Baron!\n\nI must admit I glance read through large parts of the book. There was too much action with people chasing after Sherlock and beating him up, and he beating them back, and running away. This kept happening for no reason throughout the novel. I skipped all this stuff, which left me with very little to actually read. Too much action, too little detecting! The most mind-numbingly boring book ever.\n\nMay 24, 2020\n\nThe journey through this book was really amazing. I couldn't even imagine Sherlock Holmes as a teenager. But Andrew Lane has written novels about it. It was thrilling and full of suspense and adventures. I understood now why Sherlock Holmes was so intelligent in his adulthood. It was just because of the things he learned in his childhood and teenage period. The characters were also well chosen. And I highly recommend this book to those who are Sherlockian but are craving for more. And of course, if you are a mystery lover, this book is for all of you also.\n\nOctober 3, 2012\n\na fitting tale of young Sherlock... i could hear sherlock's 'voice' quite well and fell into the tale quite easily... the new characters (matty, amyus, virginia) were fleshed out well and I loved their personalities.\n\nThe 'case' Sherlock and company were solving was fairly exciting in parts and when the conclusion was revealed I wanted to turn and smack the villain and utter a few choice words, devious but also an idiot he was.. but I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of him as of yet.\n\nIt was interesting to see how Sherlock started out and how became the 'consulting detective' we all know and love... who helped shaped into the man he is. Mr Lane has done a wonderful job of making everyone and everything vivid, I felt like I was there with Sherlock dodging the ruffians and fighting the Baron.\n\nThe humor, drama, action, mystery were all balanced out very well... a hard to put down adventure... eager to get my hands on the next book in the series (and to read mr lane's version of Sherlock first meeting Lestrade hehe)\n\nNow if the BBC show could update this somehow for a Sherlock flashback ep, even a mini one... that'd be fascinating to see how it would be adapted for modern times. (I'm a sort-of newbie to the conan doyle novels/stories, haven't read all yet)\n\nif you can't tell from my rambling ;-) haha, I really enjoyed myself would this one, highly recommend it!\n\nJune 6, 2020\n\nΤο πρώτο βιβλίο του Λέιν με τις περιπέτειες του αγαπημένου μου Σέρλοκ Χολμς σε νεαρή ηλικία, με άφησε με μια περίεργη γεύση... Από τη μια γνωρίζουμε τον Σέρλοκ Χολμς όπως ήτανε στην εφηβεία του, πριν γίνει ο πιο διάσημος ντετέκτιβ στην ιστορία. Βλεπουμε τα πρώτα του βήματα στην επαγωγική σκέψη υπό την καθοδήγηση του καθηγητή Αμάιους Κρόου, και μαθαίνουμε την πρώτη περιπέτεια της ζωής του, που θα είναι και η αρχή για το τι θα επακολουθήσει! Μέχρι εδώ όλα καλά και ωραία, αλλά... Το μεγάλο αλλά, που αλλάζει τα πράγματα!\n\nΗ γραφή...θα την χαρακτήριζα μέτρια, και φυσικά απέχει παρασάγγας από τον σερ Κόναν Ντόυλ. Φυσικά δεν περίμενα να φτάνει σε τέτοια επίπεδα, αλλά περίμενα κάτι καλύτερο. Επίσης, το χειρότερο χαρακτηριστικό του βιβλίου, είναι η υπερβολή (της υπερβολής, ω υπερβολή!)!!! Ένιωσα σε πάρα πολλά σημεία ότι δεν διαβάζω τις περιπέτειες του νεαρού Σέρλοκ Χολμς, αλλά τις περιπέτειες του νεαρού Τζέισον Στέιθαμ!!! Πράγμα που φυσικά με ξενέρωσε απίστευτα πολύ!\n\nΣε γενικές γραμμές, θα χαρακτήριζα το βιβλίο μέτριο.\n\nΣίγουρα, επειδή αγαπώ Σέρλοκ, θα δώσω άλλη μια ευκαιρία και θα διαβάσω και την επόμενη περιπέτεια.\n\nΗ βαθμολογία είναι κάπου μεταξύ 2 και 2.5, αλλά θα του δώσω τρία αστεράκια λόγω της συμπάθειας που τρέφω για τον Σέρλοκ, και επειδή μου άρεσε και ο χαρακτήρας του Αμάιους Κρόου, που μαθαίνει στον αγαπημένο μας ήρωας πως να σκέφτεται! Ελπίζω στο επόμενο να υπάρχει πάλι ο Αμάιους, και να έχει λιγότερες υπερβολές, που δεν ταιριάζουν στον \"χαρακτήρα\" του Σέρλοκ όπως τον έχουμε γνωρίσει μέσα από τα έργα του Ντόυλ και άλλων μετέπειτα συγγραφέων.\n\nJuly 3, 2020\n\nΈνα μυθιστόρημα που μπορεί ο αναγνώστης- ιδιαίτερα ο έφηβος- να ευχαριστηθεί. Ένα σημαντικό μειονέκτημα, όμως, είναι ότι δεν υπάρχει σύνδεση του ήρωα του Lane με αυτή του Ντόιλ. Δλδ δεν βρήκα ένα Σέρλοκ Χολμς στο βιβλίο αυτό.\n\nMarch 31, 2016\n\n¿Qué tipo de persona era Sherlock Holmes de adolescente? ¿Cómo se convirtió en ese hombre brillante pero un tanto disfuncional. En la serie ‘El joven Sherlock Holmes’, Andrew Lane utiliza varias pistas dejadas en las novelas de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle para responder a todas estas preguntas y algunas cosas más.\n\nYa desde las primeras publicaciones de sus primeras aventuras, y salvo por las historias originales y otras historias posteriores, Sherlock Holmes había permanecido un tanto al margen de la literatura. Con un mercado de libros para adolescentes en constante crecimiento, en 2010, los herederos de Arthur Conan Doyle creyeron que era el momento para una serie basada en la juventud del detective, una serie de libros bien escritos y con personajes fuertes. Con su amplia colección de libros sobre Holmes y una comprensión única del personaje, Andrew Lane fue la elección perfecta para escribir la historia de un joven Sherlock Holmes. En su colección -de hasta ahora 6 libros publicados- sobre El joven Sherlock Holmes, Lane explica dónde obtuvo el personaje algunos de sus talentos ocultos: el boxeo, la esgrima, la lucha y la destreza con el violín, así como el desarrollo de su firme y áspero carácter. Tomando como inspiración a las novelas de Conan Doyle y la comprensión de Lane sobre el Holmes original, los libros nos llevarán a través de días de escuela del detective y hasta el comienzo de la primera novela de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nEn el primer libro, La nube de la muerte, ambientado en 1868, nos muestra a un Sherlock de catorce años deseando dejar el internado para ir a su casa y pasar allí las vacaciones de verano. Por su hermano Mycroft se entera que su padre ha sido enviado a la India, su madre está mal de salud y que tendrá que pasar el verano con unos peculiares tíos. Pero las cosas no van a ser aburridas por mucho tiempo, Sherlock se hace amigo de Matty, un chico de la zona quien ha visto un extraño humo junto con un cadáver cubierto de forúnculos. Matty sirve como una versión más joven de Watson ayudándolo en sus investigaciones y además también es acompañado por su tutor norteamericano y su independiente hija Virginia. Sherlock pronto se ve involucrado en una serie de incendios, secuestros y asesinatos, y serán sus crecientes poderes de deducción los que le ayuden a resolver su primer asesinato, mientras descubre un plan maligno para derrocar al Imperio Británico.\n\nA pesar de ser una novela corta, es entretenida y mantiene un buen ritmo a lo largo del relato, presentado una visión muy realista de la Inglaterra victoriana. Sherlock todavía no demuestra sus grandes dotes de investigación, pero a lo largo del libro su tutor es uno de los encargados de adiestrarlo en esos menesteres. Los personajes que acompañan están bien tratados, aunque sus historias de fondo apenas se describen; quizás todo esto se vea en las novelas posteriores. El villano, que no aparece hasta el clímax de la novela, es original y peligroso, pero demasiado chato en sus intenciones. De más está decir que es una novela dirigida a los más jóvenes siendo un buen comienzo para introducir a estos lectores hacia el personaje y así pudiendo hacer que se interesen en los relatos originales.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@mchristian/el-jov...\n\nSeptember 26, 2015\n\nOkay I have seen these books listed and displayed in numerous places but never really thought about reading them until i was presented with an offer too good to resist - (how many books have I bought with those very lines I wonder) but I was about to buy the entire series - in paperback - for the price of a single title.\n\nAnyway I do love a good Sherlock story however there are so many of them around - based on every aspect and era of his life including those not mentioned in the Doyle originals as well as every combination and connotation going, that makes me a little reluctant to read them. After all there are so many other unique stories out there to explore?\n\nAnyway I thought I will give it a go - and at first I struggled - but I now know why - and with good reason.\n\nWithout going in to the storyline - all I will say is that it didn't feel like a Sherlock - I mean none of the trade mark traits were there - the only thing that really hinted at what was going on was the odd name drop and reference to historical events. It wasn't the Sherlock we all know and love - and that made the story hard going - what was this person pretending to be Sherlock Holmes and exhibiting none of the style or abilities we have come to expect from the Consulting detective.\n\nThen in one of those moments where I was wondering what to make of the book I read the authors notes at the end of the novel and this really gave me an insight in to what and why things were as they were. Andrew Lane the author wanted to show to us where the man we know as Sherlock Holmes was forged what made him pick up those skills and how did he become the man we all know so well. Now I started to realise that only through this series will we start to see the legend come together - and yes this will be through trials and adventures, lessons learnt both in the school room and at the hands of others.\n\nSo suddenly I realised I was seeing a gifted individual start to be moulded and formed in to the character we recognise so well. So rather than seeing the previous interpretations of a young Sherlock (basically the same Sherlock but with acne and a few pounds lighter) we are seeing a typical teenager start on his rites of passage and that is where they story really takes off - so do not pick up this book expecting to see the same Sherlock but with a squeaky pre-pudescent voice but rather see it is as jigsaw of adventures that will lead you to the doorstep of 221B Baker street ready to hand over the story to Mr Conan Doyle.\n\nJune 5, 2024\n\nSherlock Holmes mal ganz anders als Teenager\n\nDas Buch Young Sherlock Holmes - Der Tod liegt in der Luft von Andrew Lane ist super spannend und ich konnte es kaum aus der Hand legen. In dem Buch geht es um Sherlock Holmes als Teenager und wie er seine Sommerferien bei seinem Onkel und seiner Tante verbringt. Was ihm nicht gefällt aber es bleibt nicht dabei, denn er findet einen Freund und eine Leiche mit seinem Lehrer, der ihn in den Sommerferien unterrichtet. Sherlock findet seine Talente heraus und untersucht seinen ersten Fall mit seinem Freund und seinem Lehrer. Was der erste Fall ist und was Sherlock und seinen Freunden passiert, solltet ihr selber herausfinden.\n\nDer Schreibstil des Buches hat mir gut gefallen. Mir ist nur ein kleiner Fehler im Buch aufgefallen, der für mich nicht schlimm ist. Sherlock und sein Freund Matty, sowie sein Lehrer Amyus und seine Tochter Virginia wurden gut ausgearbeitet und ich habe einiges über sie herausgefunden. Der Schurke wurde auch gut beschrieben sogar wie er zum Schurken wurde. Das Buch wird außerdem aus der Sicht von Sherlock erzählt, also ich Perspektive.\n\nIch kann das Buch nur weiter empfehlen. Außerdem habe ich auch etwas im Buch gelernt.\n\nApril 19, 2011\n\nThis review contains spoilers.\n\nThe book was okay, but I did have some issues with it. First of all, it wasn't much of a mystery. It was a mystery for Sherlock to figure out but there was nothing for the reader to figure out. Second, the author kept repeating himself and I would have expected an editor to catch it but apparently not. There were a couple of times where Sherlock turned away and then in the very next paragraph he turned away again.\n\nThere were other things that made me feel like the author wrote a paragraph and then later wrote a paragraph and inserted it in without making sure everything flowed together. In the scene where Sherlock and Ginny are trying to get away from the Baron, Ginny runs to the windows and pulls down the draperies but a couple of paragraphs later she is sitting next to Sherlock on a chair. What did she do - run across the room and yank down the drapes, then decide she should go sit back in the chair like a good prisoner? It didn't make any sense.\n\nThen there was the whole scene with the Baron and his little marionette thing. He has servants who pull on ropes that are tied to him to make him move around, because he was trampled by horses and he's paralyzed. No, he's not paralyzed, he can move his arms and is a master swordsman. No, he can only move his arms because his servants interpret what move he wants to make and then operate the ropes to make it happen. Because they've had so much practice, which is mentioned three times during that scene, in case you missed it the first time.\n\nIt also felt unfinished. Obviously there is going to be a sequel, but there were so many unanswered questions it felt more like the book ended in the middle rather than had a proper ending. What's the deal with Mrs. Eglantine? Why is she no friend to the Holmes family? Why was she seen with some of the murder victims? Is she part of the plot, or just a shady character lurking about staircases in the foyer?\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but the American Amyus lets his daughter wander around wearing only riding breeches? This is Victorian England. I think there was a stricter dress code for the ladies, no matter what country they are from. I realize she is the spunky love interest who will probably die in a future book, unless she disguises herself as Dr. Watson because she becomes so fond of men's attire. And we know she is spunky because she wears riding breeches and rides her horse through the country unsupervised. May I have another cliché, please? Maybe she will grow up and go off to live in a romance novel someday.\n\nI didn't hate the book. It just had some editorial issues and realism issues. I found Amyus to be an interesting character and I wanted to know more about him. In fact, I think I liked all the secondary characters better than Sherlock, and wanted to know more about them. Why does his aunt talk to herself? What is Matty's back story? What does Mycroft really do? But Sherlock just left me kind of cold.\n\nProduct Description\n\nIt is the summer of 1868, and Sherlock Holmes is fourteen. On break from boarding school, he is staying with eccentric strangers—his uncle and aunt—in their vast house in Hampshire. When two local people die from symptoms that resemble the plague, Holmes begins to investigate what really killed them, helped by his new tutor, an American named Amyus Crowe. So begins Sherlock’s true education in detection, as he discovers the dastardly crimes of a brilliantly sinister villain of exquisitely malign intent.\n\nFebruary 23, 2011\n\nHave you seen the cover of this YA novel? It appears to me that Justin Bieber is Sherlock Holmes. I am not hating on the Bieb’s mind you, I am just trying to say I was a bit surprised. The only two people left sporting such a hair do left were, I thought, the Biebs and Tom Brady. But I digress. Having said absolutely nothing at all constructive about the novel, I turn the post and the blog over to daughter number five as she took one look at the cover and said, ”What the hey, I’ll give it a shot for you Oldhead!” So off she went with it.\n\nHere is what is between the covers:\n\n“It is the summer of 1868, and Sherlock Holmes is fourteen.

Some background, I am a twenty two year old female, the fifth of the seven Gelati sisters. The cover took me a back but once I got past it, the novel flew. The avant-garde quirkiness of the young Holmes drew me in and took me away. I have had the good fortune of visiting England and the descriptions of the towns and the settings were well done.\n\nAndrew Lane wrote this in the tone and pace for the age group; I was not bored, it kept my attention, and the speed of the plot and the dialogue fit like a glove. Not knowing the details of Holmes did not exclude me from enjoying the novel, in fact I think it made my enjoyment of it stronger; I had no preconceptions. My Holme’s freak friends, the club members and purists, were sour on me reading this. I am glad I didn’t listen to them; they are the ones missing out on a fun, entertaining novel.

I recommend it for all Sherlock Holmes fans.\n\nJanuary 31, 2022\n\nThe last YA Holmes book I read was SECRET LETTERS, and it was a real piece of crap. This book is not perfect, but it's got lots of action, and a great supporting cast.\n\nSherlock Holmes is a teenager and he gets sent to live with his aunt and uncle in the country. People are dying horribly with boils all over, and there are small dark clouds seen hovering above them. Young Sherlock has to solve the mystery, with the help of a rugged local lad named Matty Arnatt, his mysterious tutor Amyus Crowe, and Crowe's beautiful and high-spirited daughter Virginia.\n\nIt really shocked me how much I liked the two Americans, Amyus Crowe and his daughter Virginia. They were a lot more interesting than Holmes! And Matt the poor boy with his own canal boat was a classic sidekick, one part Sam Gamgee and one part Huckleberry Finn. Come back to the canal boat again, Sherlock honey!\n\nI give this book four stars because Virginia and Sherlock have really nice chemistry, and his tutor and his best friend are both really fascinating characters. I look forward to the next book in the series. But I have to say there were a lot of things that did not really work in this story. Not one character has a convincing British accent. The American characters talk like modern teenagers. (Virginia calls the boys \"you guys.\" In 1868?)\n\nBut the worst thing of all was the villain, who was absolutely silly and stupid and almost ruined the book for me. He was really, really low, one of those cheesy maniacal types who's always planning to take over the world and insists on telling the hero *everything* he's going to do. And yes, there are at least three occasions when he could have killed the boy Holmes easily, but he doesn't. This guy was no Professor Moriarty! I'd say he'd be lucky to make to the level of Dr. Evil in Austin Powers. Or maybe Loveless in the Wild Wild West. Or maybe Professor Chaos on South Park. He's that bad!\n\nApril 12, 2020\n\nEine Empfehlung. Super Jugendbuch, Schriftsteller und der 2 Teil wird mit Freude gelesen.\n\nNovember 19, 2010\n\nCanny writers/publishers/producers have been cottoning on to the notion that there's money to be made in mining the adolescent and teen years of male heroes -- witness The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones or the Young Bond series. And since Sherlock Holmes is in all likelihood the most pastiched fictional character in history, it came as little surprise to come across this first in what will likely be a lengthy series of \"Young Sherlock Holmes\" books. Although I do enjoy the Sherlock Holmes canon, I am far from being a true Sherlockian and am perfectly happy to dip into the occasional Holmes pastiche for some light reading. This book, which seems to be aimed at adolescent readers, is rather lighter than most.\n\nIn it, we met 14-year-old Sherlock as his elder brother Mycroft packs him off to the countryside to live with some distant relations during the school holidays. It seems that their father is away with the army in India, and their mother is bedridden with some kind of mysterious nervous breakdown. Once at his relatives, he left mostly to his own devices, and before too long, he's fallen in with a kind of homeless boy of his own age, who introduces him to \"real\" life. Meanwhile, a colorful American tutor is engaged for Sherlock's education -- an education mainly in learning how to think and observe. Soon enough, a body is discovered, suspicious behavior is observed, and young Sherlock is knee-deep in his first intrigue.\n\nWhile it's all fairly fun there isn't much sense of the adult Sherlock in this portrayal of teen Sherlock. He's a pretty blank slate without much character at all, more a plucky kid action hero than anything else. There's a great deal of action, much more so than deductive reasoning, and it's hard to tell whether that's a case of the writer playing to his presumed audience of adolescent boys, or simply being unable to come up with anything that clever. There are plenty of insider references to keep the Sherlock buffs happy, but the essential character of the young detective seemed completely absent. The period feel is generally quite good, and full of interesting details, but the dialogue occasionally drifts into phrases or words that feel wrong for the era. There's also a cheesy romantic interest in the form of his American tutor's tomboyish daughter. Overall, probably not worth it for adult readers, but not a bad way to try and get kids interested in the original stories.\n\nAugust 4, 2014\n\n\"Всяка история си има начало...\"\n\nКогато за пръв път Артър Конан Дойл ни запознава с безсмъртния си герой Шерлок Холмс в първата история за него - \"Етюд в червено\", то пристрастеният към лулата, цигулката и кокаина велик детектив е в Христова възраст с установени навици, развити умения и изграден стил на работа. Но какво е било преди това? За това ще ви разкаже авторът Андрю Лейн.\n\nГодината е 1868-а и 14-годишният Шерлок Холмс с разочарование научава, че през ваканцията няма да остане у дома заедно с родителите и брат си Майкрофт. Вместо това е принуден да прекара лятото при своя чичо и леля, които не е виждал никога. Ваканцията му се оказва всичко друго, но не и отегчителна, когато в гората внезапно се натъква на труп... Шерлок е твърдо решен да разследва връзката, а в деянието му помагат негови нови приятели.\n\nОстанах много доволен от работата на Андрю Лейн. Авторът знае какво прави, голям е фен на Шерлок, чел е всичко, изучавал го е, подготвил се е, с една дума - професионално изпипана работа. Романът е написан грамотно, увлекателно, с талант и страст, за да не посрами учителя. Попадение без съмнение.\n\n\"Облакът на Смъртта\" е без съмнение четивна книга, интересна и достъпна не само за тийнейджъри, а и за по-големи. Отдавна не бях попадал на заглавие, което така да ме грабне, книга която да разгръщам страница след страница и да не се успокоя, докато не я изгълтам цялата. Макар Шерлок да е едва на 14, макар това да е първият му случай, на крехките му младежки плещи тегне огромен товар - защото злодеят в романа се цели директно в Британската империя...\n\nНамерението ми за книгата, която държите в ръцете си, бе да разкрие какъв е бил Шерлок Холмс преди Артър Конан Дойл за пръв път да го представи на света. Какъв е бил като тийнейджър? Къде е ходил на училище и кои са били приятелите му? Къде и кога е усвоил уменията, които демонстрира по-късно – логичния ум, бокса и фехтовката, любовта към музиката и свиренето на цигулка? Какво е изучавал в университета? От какво се е страхувал? Обичал ли е някого и ако да – кого? „Облакът на смъртта“ пресъздава наново култовия детектив като брилянтен и симпатичен тийнейджър и в същото време запазва духа на оригиналните книги.\n\nИма и други книги, общо са към 5-6, тази е първата, другите въпреки че са поредица не са свързани и спокойно могат да се четат поотделно, понеже всяка проследява отделно приключение. С нетърпение очаквам следващите приключения на младия Шерлок Холмс! Вярвам, вие също.\n\nOctober 8, 2016\n\nDeath Cloud, by Andrew Lane, is the start of a new series of Sherlock Holmes as Sherlock is a teenager. This mystery thriller kept me up all night just to find out what happens next. Death Cloud was never a boring read and I am glad to have of read it. A mysterious \"cloud\" has been seen by some to be the cause of two deaths. This book is about Sherlock and his first ever impressive mystery, and of many new people he meets.\n\nDeath Cloud takes place in various cities throughout England, mostly in Farnham, Guildford, and London. They travel rapidly along the countryside on carriages, bikes, boats, and even just straight up horseback. Sherlock Holmes is very young and curious which helps him dive deep into this mystery. Sherlock has just moved in to his aunt and uncle's house and was expecting it to be terrible but, contrasting with his opinion, it was not so.\n\nYour friends will build you or break you. Sherlock needs some friends. Everybody needs at least one friend. Early in the book we find out that he doesn't have many friends if any. \"Mycroft patted Sherlock on the shoulder. 'If there was an alternative I would take it, believe me. Now, do you need to say goodbye to any friends?' Sherlock looked around. There were boys he knew, but were any of them really friends? 'No,' he said. 'Let's go'\" Sherlock ends up finding a couple of friends. How will his friends determine how he makes his decisions? I recommend reading to find out.\n\nDecember 3, 2019\n\na travesty. I was gonna be mild and give this a 1.5* but then buzzsaw hand (yeah u read that right) happened and also implying instant addiction in a 14 year old is fucked up so uh ? we’re here.\n\nthe problem with this was that it tried too hard to work future Sherlock stuff into the story to make sure we got the clue instead of successfully de-aging modern Sherlock into his teenage self. the result was a character that felt nothing like Sherlock Holmes but pretended to be him. An imposter, if you so will. As if someone read a lot about Sherlock and then wrote a book about him as a kid, which admittedly, is exactly what happened. The line is fine I’m sure but when you set out to write a series on one of the most iconic characters of all time, you should at least know what you’re doing writing-wise and andy lane really doesn’t have a fucking clue what the fuck he’s doing, not with his plot, not with his implications, and certainly not with his main character.\n\nit felt too young and too old, too violent and too boring, much to ludicrous to not feel cheap. it was so obviously written by an adult one does wonder whether the standard for kids lit went down or whether the stories were always such bullshit and you just didn’t notice.\n\nobnoxious and self-satisfied this work wields purported skill with an arrogance that makes the entire piece insufferable.\n\npoint is, it was bad and I’m just really glad it’s over.\n\nMarch 12, 2011\n\n\"Death Cloud\" is the first in a series of the adventures of young Sherlock Holmes. The book has been approved by the Sir. Author Conan Doyle estate, so you know it's going to be good! This book is really the perfect combination of action/adventure and logical explanations. I love the logic Sherlock is starting to cultivate, and it's great to see everything explained in a detailed way. The explanation of the Death Cloud itself is quite intriguing.\n\nI loved the characters, Sherlock is so lovable in that he's not perfect, but he's learning to see his own flaws and wants to better himself. Sherlock's partners in logic are fun and likable as well, including Matty the street urchin and Sherlock's mentor, Amyus Crowe.\n\nThis is such a fun read, packed with action, and logical thinking that makes you ask \"why didn't I think of that?\"\n\nARC sent by publisher in exchange for honest review\n\nreviewed for http://inthehammockblog.blogspot.com\n\nJune 19, 2015\n\nI can see why young readers would like this book- adventure, creepy bad guys, mysterious and cool little facts about things,(Like bees and history)but this genre and this book were not for me. It took me forever to finish this one because the characters felt flat and the plot bizarre.\n\nI think I like my fiction a bit more realistic, my characters a bit more dysfunctional and awkward and the writing a bit more crafted. Not much on theme or craft here, but it is a fun ride for those of you who like this type of thing.\n\nBut remember, just cuz I don't like it, doesn't make it bad. Take it for a ride and if you like it try the Sherlock stories by Doyle as well.\n\nJune 8, 2021\n\nFoarte abracadbradantă, mai curînd literatură pentru (pre) adolescenți decît polițistă. Din păcate, titlul e mai interesant decît cartea\n\nApril 1, 2022\n\n2,5 bis 3 Sterne\n\nNetter Sprecher, es plätschert so vor sich hin, aber es hat nicht wirklich viel mit Sherlock zu tun.\n\nFebruary 12, 2011\n\nI was absolutely thrilled when I received my ARC of Andrew Lane’s Young Sherlock Holmes: Death Cloud. From Dr. House to the new BBC adaptation, we are culturally inundated with Sherlock Holmes characters so I was excited to see a different perspective on Holmes’ past. Death Cloud follows Sherlock during his summer vacation from boarding school. With his father sent to India with the Royal Navy and his brother Mycroft working in the busy city of London, Sherlock is shipped off to relatives who he has never met and seldom heard of. Fearing that his summer will be full of tedious boredom, Sherlock is pleasantly surprised when Mycroft engages a tutor, the American Amyus Crowe, who supplements his education in rather unorthodox ways. But when Sherlock stumbles over a corpse on the grounds of his uncle’s estate, what he learns becomes even more bizarre.\n\nIn most adaptations, Sherlock Holmes’ background is relatively obscured, leaving him the guise of tortured, Byronic hero with a penchant for tobacco and violins. Lane gives us one interpretation of how Sherlock developed into the figure we know today. Lane’s Sherlock is a keen observer and analyst but lacks the depth of knowledge we have come to expect from his character. This allows for characters like Mycroft and Amyus Crowe to be role models for the burgeoning detective. By invoking elements of the school story, mystery novels, and the bildungsroman, Lane successfully creates a story that both young adults and older fans of the Sherlock Holmes franchise should enjoy."
