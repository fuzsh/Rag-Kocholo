        "text": "“Hot thoughts beget hot deeds,” said Shakespeare, who had it right on the money as usual. That line is quoted in Mortal Passions, a new movie full of words and deeds, some of which are hot, most of which are silly.\n\nIt’s Double Indemnity time, as a scheming young wife (Krista Errickson) plans to kill her wimpy husband (Zach Galligan, the kid from Gremlins). He’s inherited a large Hollywood house, and he’s got a pile of money in the bank, but he still makes her work nights as a cocktail waitress. When she asks him to pull a bit of the $240,000 in his safe-deposit box, he says, “Honey, that’s rainy day money.” (No wonder she wants to kill this dope.)\n\nShe’s met a sleazehound (Luca Bercovici) who will help her murder hubby. But then Galligan’s drifter brother (Michael Bowen) strolls into the picture, and manages to alter the chemistry considerably.\n\nThe film contains a lot of heavy breathing, some of which is fun to watch. In general, this sort of skulking around is pretty irresistible, and Alan Moskowitz’s screenplay keeps in touch with its film noir origins. But there’s also a goodly amount of the sort of dialogue that makes you wonder if Moskowitz had his tongue in his cheek.\n\nAnd the inclusion of a psychiatrist (David Warner) to whom husband and wife are telling their problems comes off as a totally irrelevant touch. Why is he there?\n\nThe movie’s other crucial weakness is its cast. The actors are in their mid-twenties, and the film lacks gravity because of this; these people come off as kids play-acting. The exception is Sheila Kelley, who glides into the movie halfway through as a kooky character with some important information. Kelley, who also appeared in Some Girls and Breaking In, has a radiance that really lights up the screen. Keep an eye out for her.\n\nOther than her presence, director Andrew Lane, who also made the abysmal Jake Speed, doesn’t show much spark. He’s as lost as his characters, and the “hot deeds” are rarely stoked into anything resembling fire.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, January 29, 1990\n\nDid not see this coming: Leading lady Krista Errickson, who had been in Little Darlings and a regular on TV’s Hello, Larry, got out of acting in 1994 and became a distinguished journalist and producer in Italy. Some of the other actors in this thing did pretty well for themselves, and as you can see, this was from the period when I was loudly declaring that Sheila Kelley was going to be the next big thing. I’m sorry to say I did not keep up with the directing work of Andrew Lane, but in description his other films sound pretty hotsy."
