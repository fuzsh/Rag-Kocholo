Lane is an author and journalist and doubtless one of few authors who have immense knowledge on the Sherlock Holmes character. Andrew Lane was born in 1963 and is a British citizen. Andrew studied Physics at Warwick University and there he met Justin Richards and Craig Hinton. This is probably where his passion of writing was ignited. Andy Lane wrote his first series in 2010 and it was instantly a hit. Previously, Macmillan had announced that Andrew was going write a series featuring the early life of Sherlock Holmes. This series was to be developed together with the estate owned by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Arthur is the creator Sherlock Holmes, the most famous fictional detective in the world. Andrew has always been a Sherlock Holmes fan, maybe because he imagined that Sherlock looked like him even when he was a boy. His favorite Sherlock Holmes story is ‘The Hound of the Baskerville.’ Apart from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Andrew Lane was also influenced by Tim Powers, Jonathan Carrol, Stephen Gallagher and David Morrel. Andrew was an avid reader when he was young and always loved science fiction and fantasy. Andrew loves authors who can build a character and make the character vivid in the minds of the readers.\n\nRobert Kirby who is at United Agents is the one who sparked Andrew into writing the Sherlock Holmes series. Although there were many writers who specialize in Sherlock Holmes, there was none who made Sherlock Holmes relatable to the young adults. Andy has also written several spin off novels and even audio dramas that are based on the series Doctor Who (a BBC science fiction television series) Andrew has also written scripts and storylines for the science fiction series called Space Island One. After Young Sherlock Holmes series, Andrew did another Series called Lost Worlds which also got some attention. Andrew has a wife and a son and lives in Dorset, England.\n\nThe first book in the series entitled Young Sherlock Holmes is known as Death Cloud. Sherlock Holmes is a teenager and it shows his life before he becomes a famous detective. Sherlock’s brother Mycroft hires for Sherlock an American tutor during the holiday. Sherlock notices that his new tutor is quite unusual. Sherlock has a friend whose name is Matty. During his first lesson with his tutor, Sherlock finds a dead body in their estate and a cloud surrounding the body. Matty had also previously seen this cloud. Young Sherlock also notices a yellow powdery substance around the dead body and takes some to find out what it is. Although he is a young boy, Sherlock is curious and wants to catch the killer and solve the mystery. Sherlock needs a sidekick and employs the help of Matty. Matty helps Sherlock find the warehouse which he believes one of the deceased had visited and the criminals set the warehouse on fire. Sherlock almost dies but this makes him even more determined to solve the crime. He then decided to travels to Guidlford to look for an expert in rare diseases who could help them figure out what the yellow substance is. Sherlock is then lured to a carnival where he unwillingly participates in a boxing match and is then kidnapped by Baron Maupertuis. He is interrogated by his unseen captor but is finally rescued by Matty. The two of them then decide to go to the tutor’s home. Sherlock then asks for the help of the tutor and his daughter and the four of them try to locate the Baron. They find out that the Baron is shipping a weapon but this discovery leads to Sherlock and Virginia (tutor’s daughter) being kidnapped. They are interrogated but finally escape and meet up with the rest of the team. The Baron seeks to destroy the British army and Sherlock and his trio vow to stop his plan. They find one of the Barons men, Mr. Sturd in the fort. Sherlock fights with Mr. Sturd and pushes him into a beehive. Mr. Sturd is continuously stung by bees and dies. The Baron is still at large and Sherlock has to stop him.\n\nThe second book in the series is called Red Leech. The events take place a few months after Death Cloud. Sherlock Holmes is still under the care of his tutor Amyus Crowe. Mycroft comes to visit at Holmes Manor and although Sherlock is pleased to see his brother, he realizes it is not a leisure visit. Mycroft informs Amyus that John Wilkes Booth is suspected to be in England under the alias John St. Helen. Sherlock decides to take matters into his own hands and catch Booth. Sherlock asks for Matty’s help and goes to Godalming, where he suspects Booth is hiding. Sherlock investigation leads him to a particular house that Booth may be staying. He is kidnapped by a man with a scarred face. Sherlock realizes that this man may be Booth and notices he is being guarded by three men. Matty helps Sherlock escape and they speedily return to Holmes Manor. They inform Mycroft and Amyus of their short ordeal but they are disappointed that the criminals now know that they are being hunted. The next day, Mycroft informs Amyus that the criminals are heading to America and that he intends to follow them. The criminals then kidnap Matty and Amyus, Sherlock and Virginia chase them but they are unfruitful in recovering Matty. Sherlock is then asked to accompany Amyus and Virginia to America as he is the only one who can identify the criminals. On arrival to America, Sherlock finds out where Matty is being held and they follow the captors as they move Matty to a train. The kidnappers spot Sherlock and Virginia on the train and after a dangerous fight, the two are captured and the train changes its destination to the criminals’ headquarters. Sherlock finds out that the criminals have a plan to invade Canada and make it the Confederate stronghold. Sherlock will stop at nothing to ensure that their plan is made null and void.\n\nAndrew describes young Sherlock as lonely and he does not make friends easily. The rest of the Young Sherlock Holmes series is equally captivating."
