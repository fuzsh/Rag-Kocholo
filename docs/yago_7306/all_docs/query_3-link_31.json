        "text": "Athena is regarded as a powerful female figure within Greek mythology; Athena's iconic state as a powerful goddess is shrewdly depicted in Aleigh O'Sullivan's debut music video \"Al Fine.\" Multi-platinum and Billboard award winning music producer, Andrew Lane, creates a masterful synergy of female empowerment through use of dramatic and energetic symphonic arrangements (featuring the Salt Lake City Symphony Orchestra) to support the incredible vocal prowess of Aleigh O'Sullivan.\n\nDirected by award-winning female director, Bayou Bennett of Dolce Films, this music video transcends traditional notions of female inferiority and the need to be rescued. \"Al Fine\" (translated means \"to the end\") is revealed as a short film (running time is 4 minutes 38 seconds) in ancient Greek epic style containing powerful story telling, stunning visual effects and sword fighting.\n\nAndrew Lane is a multi-platinum and Billboard Music Award winning music producer. Lane has produced some of the biggest names in the music industry including Mary J. Blige, Keith Sweat, Backstreet Boys, and is currently working with the youngest Grammy winner Miguelito. Lane's songs have been included in many movie soundtracks including Disney's Hannah Montana, High School Musical and Bring It On - In It To Win It.\n\nMr. Lane signed Aleigh O'Sullivan in January 2013 and describes her as \"...one of those artists who will stand the test of time...her voice is a voice that will change the music industry.\""
