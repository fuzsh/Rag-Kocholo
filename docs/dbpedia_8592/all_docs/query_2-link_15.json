        "text": "Unfortunately, Communities/Collections *always* show up in Browse by Community/Collection. However, you can access restrict a Collection to Administrators, so no one else can access the Collection homepage, etc. We have an example at https://demo.dspacedirect.org/handle/10673/337\n\nSAFBuilder is a commandline tool, and as such, it requires a few prerequisites to run. These are all listed in the SAFBuilder instructions at: https://github.com/DSpace-Labs/SAFBuilder/blob/master/README.md\n\n1) Install Java JDK (version 7 or 8). Here's the Java 8 JDK (download a Windows version and install): http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html\n\n2) Maven should also be installed. https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi Good guide for installing on Windows at https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/\n\n3) Git is optional. You can use it to download SAFBuilder (or just download the Zip of it, as I show below)\n\nAfter the above are installed, just download SAFBuilder to any directory, this \"installs\" it.\n\nBack on your Google Sheets file, select an empty column that will be used for script results. On the first row with data (usually row 2) add this to the cell, replacing \"Y2\" with the cell ID where the URL to be checked can be found, then hitting enter. (This is also where you can choose to use the getStatusCode function rather than getStatusCodes.)\n\n=getStatusCodes(Y2)"
