The tools included in the chapter are diverse in focus and functionality—some such as the PREMIS Event Service were specifically designed to support PREMIS; others such as MediaInfo, were not designed to address PREMIS specifically but can be used to output values that could be transformed into PREMIS values; still other tools included, such as Fedora, are large repository platforms that provide some support for PREMIS along with its many other functions. For many of these tools, specific examples for how they could be run on a command-line interface are shown."
