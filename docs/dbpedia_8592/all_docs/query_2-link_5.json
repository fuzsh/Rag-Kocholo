        "text": "Replication Task Suite\n\nThe Replication Task Suite is a DSpace Add-On which provides a set of curation system tasks to assist in performing replication (backup/restore/audit) of DSpace contents to other locations.The DSpace content is packaged in containers known as AIPs (OAIS speak: 'archival information packages'). By default, AIPs are generated in the default DSpace AIP Format (the same format used by the AIP Backup and Restore tool). If desired, there is an option to generate BagIt-based AIPs instead of using the default DSpace AIP format.\n\nThis Add-On also integrates DSpace with DuraCloud for users that wish to easily back up their content into DuraCloud directly from their DSpace administrative interface.\n\nInstallation\n\nSupported DSpace and Java Versions\n\nThe Replication Task Suite currently supports the following versions of DSpace software:\n\nInstallation instructions for each version are included below:\n\nInstallation on DSpace 7.x\n\nInstallation on DSpace 6.x\n\nInstallation on DSpace 5.x\n\nInstallation on DSpace 3.x or 4.x\n\nInstallation on DSpace 1.8.x\n\nUser Interface Compatibility Notes\n\nAs the Replication Suite is just a suite of Curation System tasks, it may be called (like any Curation Tasks) from the following locations:\n\nFrom the Command Line\n\nFrom the Admin UI (In DSpace 7.x or XMLUI in DSpace through 6.x)\n\nFrom Item Approval Workflow\n\nFrom custom Java code\n\nFor more information see the Curation System details on Task Invocation.\n\nInstallation on DSpace 7.x\n\nInstallation in the DSpace 7.x server (backend)\n\nIn your DSpace Source directory ([dspace-src]), you will need to modify the following POM file:\n\n[dspace-src]/dspace/modules/additions/pom.xml (This POM will ensure that the \"dspace-replicate\" dependency is made available to commandline and ALL DSpace interfaces)\n\nFor this pom.xml file, add the following <dependency> section at the end of the existing <dependencies> section (just before the closing </dependencies> tag).

In most cases, your existing configurations should function perfectly, but you should review the differences just in case.\n\nConfiguration\n\nConfiguration of the Replication Task Suite is based entirely on your local institution's backup, restore and preservation needs.\n\nEnabling Replication Task Suite\n\nIn order to enable the Replication Task Suite, you need to create / edit several configuration files.\n\nA copy of all configuration files utilized by the Replication Task Suite (RTS) can be found in the following locations:\n\nConfigs for RTS version 1.x : https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-replicate/tree/dspace-replicate-1_x/config/modules\n\nConfigs for RTS version 3.x : https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-replicate/tree/dspace-replicate-3_x/config/modules\n\nConfigs for RTS version 5.x : https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-replicate/tree/dspace-replicate-5_x/config/modules\n\nConfigs for RTS version 6.x : https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-replicate/tree/dspace-replicate-6_x/config/modules\n\nConfigs for RTS version 7.x : https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-replicate/tree/master/config/modules\n\nCopy the following configuration files to your DSpace's [dspace]/config/modules/ directory:\n\nreplicate.cfg - This file contains the base settings for the Replication Task Suite\n\nreplicate-mets.cfg - This file provides a few additional replication options specific to METS-based AIPs (see below for more details)\n\nreplicate-bagit.cfg - This file provides additional configuration for BagIt AIPs (see below for more details)\n\nduracloud.cfg - If you'd like to replicate/backup your content to DuraCloud, this file holds your DuraCloud account information\n\nEdit your [dspace]/config/modules/curate.cfg configuration file to define & enable all tasks. The list of tasks to add to this configuration file depends on which type of AIP (METS based or BagIt based) you wish to use. Please see the AIP Format Options section below for the details of what should be added to your curate.cfg file\n\nA sample, fully enabled curate.cfg configuration file is provided alongside the other Replication Task Suite config files listed above. This sample file is preconfigured to use METS-based AIPs.\n\nRecommended (but not required): Edit your [dspace]/config/modules/dspace.cfg and enable the Replication Task Suite 'listener' to perform automatic synchronization of your AIP backup store with what is in DSpace (see Automation Options for more info).\n\nOverview of Configuration Options\n\nBefore getting started, you may wish to determine the answers to the following questions:\n\nAIP Format Options: Does you institution want to backup using the default DSpace AIP format (METS packaging)? Or would you rather utilize the new BagIt AIP Format?\n\nStorage Options: Does you institution plan to use the Replication Suite to backup to a local/mounted drive? Or would you like to connect it to a DuraCloud account?\n\nAutomation Options (Recommended): Do you want to automatically sync your AIP backup store with what is in DSpace? (this is highly recommended, but not required)\n\nAdditional Options: Do you plan to use Checkm manifests for checksum auditing?\n\nAIP Format Options\n\nOne of the first questions to ask yourself is the format you wish to utilize for your AIPs.\n\nThere are two options:\n\nDSpace AIP Format (METS-based) (default) - This is the same AIP format utilized by the DSpace AIP Backup and Restore feature, so it is 100% compatible with that DSpace feature. In fact when using this format, the Replication Task Suite just \"wraps\" calls to the AIP Backup and Restore feature itself.\n\nBagIt AIP Format (beta) - This is a new AIP format provided by the Replication Task Suite. It generates AIPs in the BagIt File Packaging Format. Institutions which already are familiar with BagIt or use it elsewhere may find this format preferable. (Please note that this AIP format does not yet support all DSpace objects. See the below table for more information.)\n\nThese two AIP formats are not identical. The below table seeks to describe some of the differences.\n\nFor more information on the tasks available based on your AIP format choice, please see the Problem Statement and Usage Examples section below. This section also provides good examples of how to use each of the tasks available to you in the Replication Task Suite.\n\nConfiguring usage of DSpace default AIP Format (METS-based)\n\nThis section goes through the steps of configuring the Replication Suite to use the default DSpace AIP format, which utilizes METS packaging. This is the default & recommended setting.\n\nGeneral Curation Configuration: First, in your [dspace]/config/modules/curate.cfg you will want to enable & configure the METS-based replication tasks. (NOTE: there is a sample curate.cfg file provided in https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-replicate/tree/master/config/modules which is pre-configured to use METS-based AIPs).\n\nEnable the Replication Tasks: In the list of \"Task Class implementations\" (plugin.named.org.dspace.curate.CurationTask), add the following.\n\nREMEMBER to add a comma and backslash (\", \\\") after each line (except the final line).\n\nplugin.named.org.dspace.curate.CurationTask = \\ ... (YOUR EXISTING TASKS) ... , \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.EstimateAIPSize = estaipsize, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.ReadOdometer = readodometer, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.TransmitAIP = transmitaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.TransmitSingleAIP = transmitsingleaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.VerifyAIP = verifyaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.FetchAIP = fetchaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.CompareWithAIP = auditaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.RemoveAIP = removeaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.METSRestoreFromAIP = restorefromaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.METSRestoreFromAIP = replacewithaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.METSRestoreFromAIP = restorekeepexisting, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.METSRestoreFromAIP = restoresinglefromaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.METSRestoreFromAIP = replacesinglewithaip\n\n(Only for RTS versions prior to 7.0) Give Each Task a Human-Friendly Task Name: Under the ui.tasknames setting, give each of the above Tasks a human-friendy name. Here are some recommended values, but you are welcome to tweak them.\n\nREMEMBER to add a comma and backslash (\", \\\") after each line (except the final line).\n\nui.tasknames = \\ ... (YOUR EXISTING TASK NAMES) ... , \\ estaipsize = Estimate Storage Space for AIP(s), \\ readodometer = Read Odometer, \\ transmitaip = Transmit AIP(s) to Storage, \\ verifyaip = Verify AIP(s) exist in Storage, \\ fetchaip = Fetch AIP(s) from Storage, \\ auditaip = Audit against AIP(s), \\ removeaip = Remove AIP(s) from Storage, \\ restorefromaip = Restore Missing Object(s) from AIP(s), \\ replacewithaip = Replace Existing Object(s) with AIP(s), \\ restorekeepexisting = Restore Missing Object(s) but Keep Existing Objects,\\ restoresinglefromaip = Restore Single Object from AIP, \\ replacesinglewithaip = Replace Single Object with AIP\n\n(Only for RTS versions prior to 7.0) Optionally Create a Task Group: Finally, if you'd like to create a Task Group for these tasks, you can create a group named \"replicate\" and add them all to it. The below is just an example for how you may wish to set the ui.taskgroups and ui.taskgroup.* settings. It creates two Task Groups: (1) a \"General Purpose Tasks\" group for a few default DSpace Curation Tasks, and (2) a \"Replication Suite Tasks\" group for all these new Replication tasks.\n\n# Tasks may be organized into named groups which display together in UI drop-downs ui.taskgroups = \\ general = General Purpose Tasks, \\ replicate = Replication Suite Tasks # Group membership is defined using comma-separated lists of task names, one property per group ui.taskgroup.general = profileformats, requiredmetadata, checklinks ui.taskgroup.replicate = estaipsize, readodometer, transmitaip, verifyaip, fetchaip, auditaip, removeaip, restorefromaip, replacewithaip, restorekeepexisting, restoresinglefromaip, replacesinglewithaip\n\nReplication Suite Configuration: Next, in your [dspace]/config/modules/replicate.cfg you will want to ensure it is setup to properly use METS-based AIPs. Under the \"AIP Packaging Settings\" you'll want the following settings enabled:\n\n# Package type. Permitted values: 'mets', 'bagit' # mets = Generate default DSpace AIPs as described in: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC18/AIP+Backup+and+Restore # bagit = Generate AIPs based on the BagIt packaging format: https://wiki.ucop.edu/display/Curation/BagIt packer.pkgtype = mets # Format of package compression. Permitted values: 'zip' or 'tgz' # for 'mets' packages, only 'zip' is supported packer.archfmt = zip # Whether or not the name packages with a DSpace type prefix. # When 'true', package files are named [type]@[handle].[format] (e.g. ITEM@123456789-1.zip) # When 'false', package files are named [handle].[format] (e.g. 123456789-1.zip) # Defaults to 'true'. For 'mets' packages, this must be 'true'. packer.typeprefix = true\n\nOptionally tweak the AIP Restore/Replace settings: Optionally, you can decide to tweak the way AIPs are restored or replaced (using AIP Backup and Restore options). These settings normally should not need to be tweaked, but are available in the [dspace]/config/modules/replicate-mets.cfg configuration file. See that configuration file for more details.\n\nThis section goes through the steps of configuring the Replication Suite to use BagIt-based AIPs. The Replication Suite uses the BagIt Profiles specification in order to provide additional guarantees about the BagIt AIPs which are exported and ingested. The following profiles are supported:\n\nIf no BagIt Profile is specified the beyondtherepository profile will be used by default. For more information on the BagIt packaging format, see: https://wiki.ucop.edu/display/Curation/BagIt; the BagIt Profiles implementation used is DuraSpace's bagit-support.\n\nGeneral Curation Configuration: First, in your [dspace]/config/modules/curate.cfg you will want to enable & configure the BagIt-based replication tasks. (NOTE: there is a sample curate.cfg file provided in https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-replicate/tree/master/config/modules which provides example settings, though they are all commented out by default).\n\nEnable the Replication Tasks: In the list of \"Task Class implementations\" (plugin.named.org.dspace.curate.CurationTask), add the following.\n\nREMEMBER to add a comma and backslash (\", \\\") after each line (except the final line).\n\nplugin.named.org.dspace.curate.CurationTask = \\ ... (YOUR EXISTING TASKS) ... , \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.EstimateAIPSize = estaipsize, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.ReadOdometer = readodometer, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.TransmitAIP = transmitaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.VerifyAIP = verifyaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.FetchAIP = fetchaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.CompareWithAIP = auditaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.RemoveAIP = removeaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.BagItRestoreFromAIP = restorefromaip, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.BagItReplaceWithAIP = replacewithaip\n\n(Only for RTS versions prior to 7.0) Give Each Task a Human-Friendly Task Name: Under the ui.tasknames setting, give each of the above Tasks a human-friendy name. Here are some recommended values, but you are welcome to tweak them.\n\nREMEMBER to add a comma and backslash (\", \\\") after each line (except the final line).\n\nui.tasknames = \\ ... (YOUR EXISTING TASK NAMES) ... , \\ estaipsize = Estimate Storage Space for AIP(s), \\ readodometer = Read Odometer, \\ transmitaip = Transmit AIP(s) to Storage, \\ verifyaip = Verify AIP(s) exist in Storage, \\ fetchaip = Fetch AIP(s) from Storage, \\ auditaip = Audit/Compare against AIP(s), \\ removeaip = Remove AIP(s) from Storage, \\ restorefromaip = Restore Missing Object(s) from AIP(s), \\ replacewithaip = Replace Existing Object(s) with AIP(s)\n\n(Only for RTS versions prior to 7.0) Optionally Create a Task Group: Finally, if you'd like to create a Task Group for these tasks, you can create a group named \"replicate\" and add them all to it. The below is just an example for how you may wish to set the ui.taskgroups and ui.taskgroup.*settings. It creates two Task Groups: (1) a \"General Purpose Tasks\" group for a few default DSpace Curation Tasks, and (2) a \"Replication Suite Tasks\" group for all these new Replication tasks.\n\n# Tasks may be organized into named groups which display together in UI drop-downs ui.taskgroups = \\ general = General Purpose Tasks, \\ replicate = Replication Suite Tasks # Group membership is defined using comma-separated lists of task names, one property per group ui.taskgroup.general = profileformats, requiredmetadata, checklinks ui.taskgroup.replicate = estaipsize, readodometer, transmitaip, verifyaip, fetchaip, auditaip, removeaip, restorefromaip, replacewithaip\n\nReplication Suite Configuration: Next, in your [dspace]/config/modules/replicate.cfg you will want to ensure it is setup to properly use BagIt-based AIPs. Under the \"AIP Packaging Settings\" you'll want the following settings enabled:\n\n# Package type. Permitted values: 'mets', 'bagit' # mets = Generate default DSpace AIPs as described in: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC18/AIP+Backup+and+Restore # bagit = Generate AIPs based on the BagIt packaging format: https://wiki.ucop.edu/display/Curation/BagIt packer.pkgtype = bagit\n\nBagIt Configuration: Finally, in [dspace]/config/modules/replicate-bagit.cfg, you will need to configure settings for the BagIt tasks:\n\nConfigure the BagIt Profile: Set the BagIt Profile which will be used\n\n# The Bag Profile setting allows you to select a BagProfile which the RTS # will create and read bags for. The RTS will check the conformance of a # bag to a profile as part of both the packaging and restoration processes. # # See: https://github.com/duraspace/bagit-support/ for more information # # Available Options: aptrust, beyondtherepository # Default: beyondtherepository replicate-bagit.profile = beyondtherepository\n\nConfigure the Bag Metadata: Under the replicate-bagit.tag, set appropriate values for additional bag metadata to be packaged with your DSpace AIPs. Each configuration property of this section follows the format of replicate-bagit.tag.tag-filename.metadata-key: metadata-value. See section 2.2.2 of the BagIt specification for more information on bag metadata.\n\nNote: depending on the BagIt Profile specified there will be different required fields for the bag metadata files, so it is important to know what profile you're working with.\n\n#### BagIt Bag Metadata Settings #### # These settings allow you to customize the bag-info.txt which # is written by the BagIt packaging tools. By default no fields # are used which will produce Bags which do not conform to any # BagProfiles. replicate-bagit.tag.bag-info.source-organization = dspace replicate-bagit.tag.bag-info.organization-address = localhost\n\nStorage Options\n\nWhere your AIPs will be stored is the next decision to make. There are three options currently available:\n\nLocal Storage: Replicate/Backup content to another location (folder) on your local filesystem.\n\nMountable Storage: Replicate/Backup content to a mounted external filesystem (e.g. NFS-mounted drive).\n\nDuraCloud Storage: Replicate/Backup content to an existing DuraCloud account.\n\nConfiguring Local Storage\n\nBefore configuring a local storage option, please ensure you have enough space available on your local hard drive (or mounted drive/SAN if your local folder is actually remote storage). You can use the \"Estimate Storage Space for AIP(s)\" (estaipsize) task to estimate the amount of new storage space you will need.\n\nTo configure local storage, please change the following settings in your [dspace]/config/modules/replicate.cfg configuration file:\n\nEnable Local Storage Plugin: Ensure the Replication suite is setup to use the 'LocalObjectStore' plugin\n\n# Replica store implementation class (specify one) plugin.single.org.dspace.ctask.replicate.ObjectStore = \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.store.LocalObjectStore\n\nConfigure Local Storage Folder: Configure the location where you want all AIPs to be stored on your local filestystem. This defaults to the [dspace]/repstore folder. However, we recommend changing this to at least a separate hard drive from your existing DSpace installation directory! This ensures that all your content will not be lost in the case of a hard drive failure.\n\n# Location of local (e.g. local, mountable, sync) object store # ignored for non-local stores (e.g. DuraCloud) store.dir = ${dspace.dir}/repstore\n\nOptionally Configure Subfolder Settings: Optionally, you can configure the sub-folder names (under store.dir) which will be used to store AIPs, checkm manifests (if enabled), etc.\n\n# The primary storage group / folder where AIPs are stored/retrieved when AIP based tasks # are executed (e.g. \"Transmit AIP\", \"Restore from AIP\") group.aip.name = aip-store # The storage group / folder where Checkm Manifests are stored/retrieved when Checkm Manifest # based tasks are executed (org.dspace.ctask.replicate.checkm.*). group.manifest.name = manifest-store # The storage group / folder where deletion records are kept when an object deletion occurs # and the ReplicationConsumer is enabled (see below). Each time an object is deleted in DSpace, # a DELETION-RECORD@[handle] file is written to this location. The deletion record is always in # BagIt format. It details basic info about the deleted object (along with any deleted child/member objects) # This deletion record may be used to restore those deleted object(s) at a later time (using \"Restore from AIP\" tasks), # or may be used to permanently remove their AIP(s) from storage (using \"Remove AIP\" task). group.delete.name = deletions\n\nUsing Subfolders\n\nYour \"group.aip.name\", \"group.manifest.name\" and \"group.delete.name\" settings also support subfolder paths. For example:\n\ngroup.aip.name = dspace-backup/aip-store\n\ngroup.manifest.name = dspace-backup/manifest-store\n\ngroup.delete.name = dspace-backup/deletions\n\nWith the above settings in place, all your DSpace content will be stored in the \"dspace-backup\" folder (under store.dir). AIPs will all be stored under the subfolder \"aip-store/\". Manifests will all be stored under the subfolder \"manifest-store/\". And any object deletion records will be stored under the subfolder \"deletions/\".\n\nConfiguring Mountable Storage\n\nBefore configuring a mounted storage option, please ensure you have enough space available on your external, mounted drive/SAN. You can use the \"Estimate Storage Space for AIP(s)\" (estaipsize) task to estimate the amount of new storage space you will need.\n\nTo configure local storage, please change the following settings in your [dspace]/config/modules/replicate.cfg configuration file:\n\nEnable Local Storage Plugin: Ensure the Replication suite is setup to use the 'MountableObjectStore' plugin\n\n# Replica store implementation class (specify one) plugin.single.org.dspace.ctask.replicate.ObjectStore = \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.store.MountableObjectStore\n\nConfigure Mounted Folder: Configure the location where you want all AIPs to be stored. The folder should already be mounted on your local filesystem. This defaults to the [dspace]/repstorefolder.\n\n# Location of local (e.g. local, mountable, sync) object store # ignored for non-local stores (e.g. DuraCloud) store.dir = ${dspace.dir}/repstore\n\nOptionally Configure Subfolder Settings: Optionally, you can configure the sub-folder names (under store.dir) which will be used to store AIPs, checkm manifests (if enabled), etc.\n\n# The primary storage group / folder where AIPs are stored/retrieved when AIP based tasks # are executed (e.g. \"Transmit AIP\", \"Restore from AIP\") group.aip.name = aip-store # The storage group / folder where Checkm Manifests are stored/retrieved when Checkm Manifest # based tasks are executed (org.dspace.ctask.replicate.checkm.*). group.manifest.name = manifest-store # The storage group / folder where deletion records are kept when an object deletion occurs # and the ReplicationConsumer is enabled (see below). Each time an object is deleted in DSpace, # a DELETION-RECORD@[handle] file is written to this location. The deletion record is always in # BagIt format. It details basic info about the deleted object (along with any deleted child/member objects) # This deletion record may be used to restore those deleted object(s) at a later time (using \"Restore from AIP\" tasks), # or may be used to permanently remove their AIP(s) from storage (using \"Remove AIP\" task). group.delete.name = deletions\n\nUsing Subfolders\n\nYour \"group.aip.name\", \"group.manifest.name\" and \"group.delete.name\" settings also support subfolder paths. For example:\n\ngroup.aip.name = dspace-backup/aip-store\n\ngroup.manifest.name = dspace-backup/manifest-store\n\ngroup.delete.name = dspace-backup/deletions\n\nWith the above settings in place, all your DSpace content will be stored in the \"dspace-backup\" folder (under store.dir). AIPs will all be stored under the subfolder \"aip-store/\". Manifests will all be stored under the subfolder \"manifest-store/\". And any object deletion records will be stored under the subfolder \"deletions/\".\n\nConfiguring DuraCloud Storage\n\nHow DuraCloud storage works\n\nThe Replication Task Suite includes a DuraCloud Storage plugin which utilizes the DuraCloud REST API to send/retrieve content to/from DuraCloud. This allows one to backup & restore DSpace via DuraCloud.\n\nBefore you can use the DuraCloud Storage plugin, you first must signup for a DuraCloud account (or signup for a trial account).\n\nOnce you have a DuraCloud account, you can configure the Replication Task Suite to use your DuraCloud Account Settings (as detailed below).\n\nIn DuraCloud, you will also want to create one (or more) \"DuraCloud Spaces\" in which to store your DSpace AIPs. You'll then need to configure those space(s) in the DuraCloud Storage Settings of the Replication Task Suite (as detailed below). The DuraCloud Space represents the location in your DuraCloud account where you want to DSpace to store its content. Having a separate DuraCloud Space for your DSpace content is recommended (though not required), as it allows you to separate your DSpace content from any other content you may wish to store in DuraCloud.\n\nWhen you backup (transmit) DSpace content to DuraCloud via the Replication Task Suite, the following general steps occur:\n\nFor each DSpace object (Community, Collection, Item), an AIP zip file is generated on the server running DSpace. The AIP is temporarily stored in the server's [dspace]/replicate/[group.aip.name] directory, where \"[group.aip.name]\" is the value of the \"group.aip.name\" setting in your \"replicate.cfg\" configuration file (see DuraCloud Storage Settings below for more info). This \"group.aip.name\" setting also corresponds to the ID of the DuraCloud Space where the AIP will be stored.\n\nOnce the AIP is generated, the Replication Task Suite determines whether a file of this same name already exists in the DuraCloud Space.\n\nIf this file does not exist in DuraCloud, the locally generated AIP is uploaded to DuraCloud.\n\nIf a file of this name already exists, then the Replication Task Suite checks to see if it differs from the locally generated AIP. It does so by verifying the DuraCloud reported checksum with the locally generated checksum.\n\nIf the AIP checksums differ, the locally generated AIP is uploaded to DuraCloud and it replaces the version that was previously in DuraCloud.\n\nIf the AIP checksums are identical, then the AIP is skipped. Nothing is uploaded to DuraCloud as the files are identical. This ensures that unnecessary uploads to DuraCloud are avoided.\n\nOnce the local copy of the AIP is no longer needed, it is removed from the server's temporary location.\n\nIf an upload to DuraCloud occurred, the local \"odometer\" is incremented to ensure it always details the total amount of content that has been uploaded (see Keeping Score section for more info on the \"odometer\").\n\nWhen you restore/replace DSpace content from DuraCloud via the Replication Task Suite, the following general steps occur:\n\nFor each DSpace object (Community, Collection, Item), that object's AIP is downloaded from DuraCloud to the server running DSpace (the appropriate AIP is located in DuraCloud via its filename). The AIP is temporarily stored in the server's [dspace]/replicate/[group.aip.name] directory, where \"[group.aip.name]\" is the value of the \"group.aip.name\" setting in your \"replicate.cfg\" configuration file (see DuraCloud Storage Settings below for more info). This \"group.aip.name\" setting also corresponds to the ID of the DuraCloud Space where the AIP is stored.\n\nOnce the download completes, the local \"odometer\" is incremented to ensure it always details the total amount of content that has been downloaded (see Keeping Score section for more info on the \"odometer\").\n\nThe AIP is then \"unzipped\", and the DSpace object is restored/replaced as needed.\n\nOnce the local copy of the AIP is no longer needed, it is removed from the server's temporary location.\n\nWhether you are backing up content to DuraCloud or restoring content from DuraCloud, the Replication Task Suite helps to ensure that these tasks are as seamless as possible. As moving content in/out of the cloud can sometimes result in extra costs, the Replication Task Suite also ensures it avoids unnecessary uploads. Finally, the Replication Task Suite helps you better estimate what those costs may be by keeping a running total of uploads/downloads in the \"odometer\".\n\nDuraCloud Account Settings\n\nIn order to configure DuraCloud Storage, you first must have an existing DuraCloud Account (or a trial account). This account's settings should be configured in your [dspace]/config/modules/duracloud.cfg file as follows:\n\nDuraCloud HostName: This is the location of your DuraCloud instance (the URL you tend to access for your account). Just provide the hostname.\n\n# DuraCloud service location (just the hostname) host = demo.duracloud.org\n\nDuraCloud Service Port: This is the port that DuraCloud is running on. It is almost always \"443\", unless you have installed DuraCloud yourself and configured it differently.\n\n# DuraCloud service port (usually 443 for https) port = 443\n\nDuraCloud's \"DuraStore\" path: This the path to DuraCloud's \"DuraStore\" service. It is almost always \"durastore\", unless you have installed DuraCloud yourself and configured it differently.\n\ncontext = durastore\n\nDuraCloud Username & Password: Finally, fill out your account username & password in these settings. Please note, as this file now contains your DuraCloud account information, we recommend securing it (if possible). Just ensure it is still readable by the system user that DSpace runs as.\n\n# DuraCloud user name username = myduraclouduser # DuraCloud password password = passw0rd\n\nDuraCloud Storage Settings\n\nNow, to configure DuraCloud as your storage location please change the following settings in your [dspace]/config/modules/replicate.cfg configuration file:\n\nEnable DuraCloud Storage Plugin: Ensure the Replication suite is setup to use the 'DuraCloudObjectStore' plugin\n\n# Replica store implementation class (specify one) plugin.single.org.dspace.ctask.replicate.ObjectStore = \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.store.DuraCloudObjectStore\n\nConfigure DuraCloud Primary Space to use: Your DuraCloud account allows you to separate content into various \"Spaces\". You'll need to create a new DuraCloud Space that your AIPs will be stored within, and configure that as your group.aip.name (by default it's set to a DuraCloud Space with ID of \"aip-store\").\n\n# The primary storage group / folder where AIPs are stored/retrieved when AIP based tasks # are executed (e.g. \"Transmit AIP\", \"Restore from AIP\") group.aip.name = aip-store\n\nOptionally, Configure Additional DuraCloud Spaces: If you have chosen to utilize Checkm manifest validation, you will need to create and configure a DuraCloud Space corresponding to the group.manifest.name setting below. Additionally, if you have chosen to enable the Automatic Replication, you will need to create and configure a DuraCloud Space corresponding to the group.delete.name setting below.\n\n# The storage group / folder where Checkm Manifests are stored/retrieved when Checkm Manifest # based tasks are executed (org.dspace.ctask.replicate.checkm.*). group.manifest.name = manifest-store # The storage group / folder where deletion records are kept when an object deletion occurs # and the ReplicationConsumer is enabled (see below). Each time an object is deleted in DSpace, # a DELETION-RECORD@[handle] file is written to this location. The deletion record is always in # BagIt format. It details basic info about the deleted object (along with any deleted child/member objects) # This deletion record may be used to restore those deleted object(s) at a later time (using \"Restore from AIP\" tasks), # or may be used to permanently remove their AIP(s) from storage (using \"Remove AIP\" task). group.delete.name = deletions\n\nUsing File Prefixes instead of separate DuraCloud Spaces\n\nIf you'd rather keep all your DSpace files in a single DuraCloud Space, you can tweak your \"group.aip.name\", \"group.manifest.name\" and \"group.delete.name\" settings to specify a file-prefix to use. For example:\n\ngroup.aip.name = dspace-backup/aip-store\n\ngroup.manifest.name = dspace-backup/manifest-store\n\ngroup.delete.name = dspace-backup/deletions\n\nWith the above settings in place, all your DSpace content will be stored in the \"dspace-backup\" Space within DuraCloud. AIPs will all be stored with a file-prefix of \"aip-store/\" (e.g. \"aip-store/ITEM@123456789-2.zip\"). Manifests will all be stored with a file-prefix of \"manifest-store/\". And any object deletion records will be stored with a file-prefix of \"deletions/\". This allows you to keep all your content in a single DuraCloud Space while avoiding name conflicts between AIPs, Manifests and deletion records.\n\nAutomation Options (Recommended)\n\nPerforming a backup of DSpace is one thing..but ensuring that backup is always \"synchronized\" with your changing DSpace content is another.\n\nThe Replication Task Suite offers several options to automate replication of content to your backup storage location of choice.\n\nAutomatically Sync Changes (via Queue) : Any changes that happen in DSpace (new objects, changed objects, deleted objects) are automatically added to a \"queue\". This queue can then be processed on a schedule (via cron).\n\nScheduled Site Auditing/Replication : You may also wish to perform a full site audit or backup on a scheduled basis.\n\nAutomatically Sync Changes (via Queue)\n\nThe Replication Task Suite includes an 'event consumer', that can 'listen for' any changes to objects in the repository. The job of this 'consumer' is to ensure that anytime an object is added/changed/deleted, it is added to the queue of objects that need to be replicated to your backup storage location.\n\nActivate the Sync Consumer\n\nIn order to enable/activate synchronization, you will need to add a new consumer to the list of DSpace consumers (in dspace.cfg).\n\nMETS-based AIP Replicate Consumer: This consumer will listen for changes to any DSpace Communities, Collections, Items, Groups, or EPeople. It should be utilized if you have chosen to use METS-based AIPs. See AIP Format Options above for more details.\n\n#### Event System Configuration #### # ADD the \"replicate\" consumer to the end of the list of 'default.consumers' (This enables the consumer) event.dispatcher.default.consumers = versioning, discovery, eperson, replicate .... # Configure consumer to manage METS AIP content replication event.consumer.replicate.class = org.dspace.ctask.replicate.METSReplicateConsumer event.consumer.replicate.filters = Community|Collection|Item|Group|EPerson+All\n\nIn human terms, this configuration essentially means: listen for all changes to Communities, Collections, Items, Groups and EPeople. If a change is detected, run the \"METSReplicateConsumer\" (which adds that object to the queue).\n\nBagIt-based AIP Consumer : This consumer will ONLY listen for changes to DSpace Communities, Collections and Items as those are the only types of objects which are stored in BagIt-based AIPs. See AIP Format Options above for more details\n\n#### Event System Configuration #### # ADD the \"replicate\" consumer to the end of the list of 'default.consumers' (This enables the consumer) event.dispatcher.default.consumers = versioning, discovery, eperson, replicate .... # Configure consumer to manage BagIt AIP content replication event.consumer.replicate.class = org.dspace.ctask.replicate.BagItReplicateConsumer event.consumer.replicate.filters = Community|Collection|Item+Install|Modify|Modify_Metadata|Delete\n\nIn human terms, this configuration essentially means: listen for any new, modified or deleted Items, Collections and Communities. If you do not care about Community or Collection AIPs, just remove 'Community' or 'Collection' from the list. When one of the specified changes is detected, run the \"BagItReplicateConsumer\" (which adds that object to the queue).\n\nYou will need to restart DSpace for this new Consumer to be recognized.\n\nHow the Sync Consumer works\n\nWhen the activated ReplicateConsumer detects a change on an object (Community, Collection or Item) in DSpace, it will do the following:\n\nObject is created/added in DSpace: If the event is an addition of a new DSpace object (for items this only occurs once the item exits approval workflow), then a request for an AIP transmission is queued.\n\nObject is changed/modified in DSpace: The same occurs whenever an object has changed (so-called modify events). The modified object is queued for AIP transmission.\n\nObject is deleted from DSpace: When an object is deleted, a 'record' of the deletion is transmitted to the replication service. The deletion record is stored in your configured \"group.delete.name\" (in replicate.cfg) and named DELETION-RECORD@[handle].zip. The deletion record is a BagIt package which simply lists all the objects that were deleted: if an item, then just the handle of the item, if a collection, then all the item handles that were in it. This way, if the deletion was a mistake, the \"deletion record\" can be used to recover all the contents. This represents the default behavior of the consumer. However, you may configure it in [dspace]/modules/replicate.cfg.\n\nIt is worth noting that when you delete an object in DSpace, the Sync Consumer will NOT delete that object's AIP from storage. All it does is write a \"DELETION-RECORD@[handle]\" file to your configured storage location. This ensures that you can review those \"deletion records\" at a later time, and decide whether to permanently delete the AIP(s) from storage, or alternatively restore the deleted object(s) in DSpace from their AIP(s).\n\nHow to restore deleted objects: Simply run one of the \"Restore from AIP\" commands available in the Replication Task Suite, passing it the handle of the deleted object. That command will locate the associated \"DELETION-RECORD\" file and appropriately restore any objects listed in that deletion record. Once the restoration is complete, the associated \"DELETION-RECORD\" file will be removed.\n\nHow to permanently delete objects' AIPs from storage: If an object deletion was found to be valid, you may wish to permanently remove the deleted object's AIP from remote storage (to save storage space). Simply run the \"Remove AIP\" command, passing it the handle of the deleted object. That command will permanently delete the object's AIP along with any associated \"DELETION-RECORD\" file from your storage location. (WARNING: once an AIP is deleted, you will be unable to restore that object to DSpace in the future.)\n\nConfiguring the Sync Consumer\n\nThe actions of the activated ReplicateConsumer (i.e. both METSReplicateConsumer and BagItReplicateConsumer) is configured within the [dspace]/modules/replicate.cfg. Below are the default options (which normally need no modification)\n\nAs you can see in the default configuration above...\n\nBoth \"add\" and \"modification\" events add the \"transmitsingleaip\" task (which will regenerate & transmit the object AIP to replica storage) to the queue of tasks to perform. Please ensure you are scheduling this queue to be processed, as detailed in Processing the Consumer Queue below.\n\nThe \"delete\" event triggers a special \"catalog\" task. This \"catalog\" task does the following:\n\nFirst, it creates a plaintext \"catalog\" file which lists all the objects that were deleted.\n\nSecond, it moves the AIPs for those deleted objects to the \"group.delete.name\" storage area (this is essentially putting them in a \"trash\" folder, where they can be cleaned up later, or potentially restored if the deletion was accidental).\n\nBy default, the queue used for all replication events is located at : [dspace]/ctqueues/replication (this is a plaintext file which just lists all actions that should be performed the next time the queue is processed)\n\nProcessing the Sync Consumer Queue\n\nOnce you've setup your Consumer & restarted DSpace, you'll start to see a (plain text file) queue of tasks (in the location specified by the consumer.queue setting in \"replicate.cfg\") that need to be performed in order to synchronize your AIP backup with what is in your DSpace instance. This replication queue is just a normal DSpace Curation System queue, and it can be processed via command line or a cron job (recommended).\n\nProcessing this queue is as simple as scheduling a cron job (or similar) to run on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (how frequently you want this to run is up to you). For example, here's a cron job which will process a queue named \"replication\" every Saturday at 1:00AM local time and places the results into a \"replication-queue.log\" file (NOTE: you may need to modify the paths to DSpace below if you wish to use this example):\n\nThe \"-r -\" part of this command ensures that the results of the sync are reported back to you on the command line, rather than being logged to the main dspace.log file.\n\nThen the \"> replication-queue.log 2>&1\" takes those reported results (success & errors) and writes them to a \"replication-queue.log\" file.\n\nAlthough this example is a weekly sync, some institutions may wish to perform a more frequent (daily) or less frequent (monthly) sync based on local policies (especially based on whether AIPs are the sole form of backup, or acting as more of a \"secondary\" safety backup)\n\nIn case it is not obvious, you can also process this queue manually via the command line by simply running: [dspace]/bin/dspace curate -q replication\n\nDuring the processing of the queue, the existing queue file is \"locked\", but any new changes are logged to a separate queue file. In other words, changes that happen in the DSpace system during the processing of the queue will still be captured in a separate queue file (which will be processed the next time you execute the above script).\n\nEnhancing the Performance of the Queue Processing (optional)\n\nFor large or highly active repositories, the \"replication\" queue may grow rather large as each change in the system adds (at least) one task to the queue. In addition, if the same object is modified multiple times (e.g. several small tweaks to an item), it will cause duplicate entries to appear in this queue.\n\nIn DSpace, by default, duplicate tasks in a Curation System queue will each be processed individually. So, that means if an Item is updated 10 times, it will appear in the queue 10 times, and its AIP will be (re-)generated and (re-)transmitted to storage 10 times when that queue is processed. (DuraCloud Note: Some storage platforms, e.g. DuraCloud, provide a way to determine whether a newly generated AIP actually differs from the one in replica storage. So, in the case of DuraCloud storage, the AIP will be re-generated 10 times, but it will only be transmitted to DuraCloud ONCE. The other 9 times, the DuraCloud storage plugin will determine that the checksum of the new AIP is identical to the one in DuraCloud and skip the transmission step. See How DuraCloud storage works section above for more info.)\n\nTo help resolve this issue of potentially running many duplicate tasks when you process the replication queue, the Replication Task Suite provides a specialized \"FilteredFileTaskQueue\" (org.dspace.ctask.replicate.FilteredFileTaskQueue) which can be enabled. The \"FilteredFileTaskQueue\", acts similar to the default \"FileTaskQueue\" (used by the DSpace Curation System), but it first filters out any known duplicate entries (lines) before the queue is processed. A duplicate entry is one that performs the exact same task(s) on the exact same object.\n\nFor example, given a queue file that looks like (note, the format of each entry in the queue is: \"[username]|[timestamp]|[tasks]|[obj-handle]\")\n\nThe default \"FileTaskQueue\" will execute all four entries in this queue, whereas the \"FilteredFileTaskQueue\" will only execute the first two entries (as entries #3 and #4 would be considered duplicates of entry #1).\n\nTo enable the FilteredFileTaskQueue, you would need to change the queue class specified in the [dspace]/config/modules/curate.cfg file and restart DSpace:\n\nPlease note: this change to curate.cfg will cause the entire DSpace Curation System (not just the Replication Task Suite tasks) to utilize the FilteredFileTaskQueue for queuing. This should not cause any issues with other tasks, as the FilteredFileTaskQueue is an extension of FileTaskQueue, but it's worth noting that this change will effect all curation tasks.\n\nScheduled Site Auditing/Replication\n\nWhether you decide to automatically synchronize your replica (backup) store or not, you may also wish to schedule some occasional auditing or even a full \"refresh\" of your backup. Note that you need not necessarily perform both tasks, it's really up to you. Refreshing your backup (transmitaip) also performs its own internal \"audit\" by ensuring that only AIPs which have changed will be transmitted to your backup location (thus potentially cutting down on I/O costs for hosted backup locations).\n\nAuditing for site differences: Running an audit will check if there are differences between DSpace Content and AIP backup content. A full site AIP audit can be run from the command line, or scheduled via a cron job (or similar). For example, the following command will run a site-wide audit for a DSpace site with a handle.prefix of \"10673\" (and writes the results of the audit to a \"siteaudit.log\" file).\n\n[dspace]/bin/dspace curate -t auditaip -i 10673/0 -r - > siteaudit.log 2>&1\n\nThis command runs the \"auditaip\" task on your entire site (The identifier \"[handle-prefix]/0\" refers to the entire DSpace Site...in this case we used the example handle-prefix of \"10673\")\n\nThe \"-r -\" part of this command ensures that the results of the audit are reported back to you on the command line, rather than being logged to the main dspace.log file.\n\nThen the \"> siteaudit.log\" takes those reported results and writes them to a \"siteaudit.log\" file.\n\nA refresh of your full backup: Whether or not you decide to use the sync queue for automated backups (as described above), you may want to ensure that you are re-running your entire site backup on a scheduled basis. For example, the following command will regenerate & transmit AIPs for every object in a DSpace site with a handle.prefix of \"10673\" (and writes the results of the audit to a \"sitebackup.log\" file). It's nearly identical to the \"auditaip\" command above, except that you are executing \"transmitaip\" and writing to a different log file. Please note: only AIPs which have changed (i.e. have a different checksum) will be transferred to your backup location. So if you are also running automated syncing, this command may just act as way to double check that all your AIPs are up-to-date in your backup location.\n\n[dspace]/bin/dspace curate -t transmitaip -i 10673/0 -r - > sitebackup.log 2>&1\n\nAdditional Options\n\nConfiguring usage of Checkm manifest validation\n\nThis section goes through the steps of configuring the usage of Checkm manifest tasks. These tasks provide a capability to store DSpace content checksums external from DSpace in the Checkm Manifest format. Some institutions may find this to be a useful replacement for the default DSpace Checksum Checker/Validator, which only stores/validates checksums internal to the DSpace system.\n\nHowever, as this is an optional set of tasks, they are disabled by default. Should you wish to enable these tasks, just do the following:\n\nGeneral Curation Configuration: First, in your [dspace]/config/modules/curate.cfg you will want to enable & configure the Checkm Manifest tasks. (NOTE: there is a sample curate.cfg file provided in https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-replicate/tree/master/config/modules which provides example settings, though they are all commented out by default).\n\nEnable the Checkm Tasks: In the list of \"Task Class implementations\" (plugin.named.org.dspace.curate.CurationTask), add the following.\n\nREMEMBER to add a comma and backslash (\", \\\") after each line (except the final line).\n\nplugin.named.org.dspace.curate.CurationTask = \\ ... (YOUR EXISTING TASKS) ... , \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.checkm.TransmitManifest = transmitmanifest, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.checkm.VerifyManifest = verifymanifest, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.checkm.FetchManifest = fetchmanifest, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.checkm.CompareWithManifest = auditmanifest, \\ org.dspace.ctask.replicate.checkm.RemoveManifest = removemanifest\n\nGive Each Task a Human-Friendly Task Name: Under the ui.tasknames setting, give each of the above Tasks a human-friendy name. Here are some recommended values, but you are welcome to tweak them.\n\nREMEMBER to add a comma and backslash (\", \\\") after each line (except the final line).\n\nui.tasknames = \\ ... (YOUR EXISTING TASK NAMES) ... , \\ transmitmanifest = Transmit Checkm Manifest to Storage, \\ verifymanifest = Verify Checkm Manifest exists in Storage, \\ fetchmanifest = Fetch Checkm Manifest from Storage, \\ auditmanifest = Audit against Checkm Manifest, \\ removemanifest = Remove Checkm Manifest from Storage\n\nOptionally Create a Task Group: Finally, if you'd like to create a Task Group for these tasks, you can create a group named \"checkm\" and add them all to it. The below is just an example for how you may wish to set the ui.taskgroups and ui.taskgroup.* settings. It creates two Task Groups: (1) a \"General Purpose Tasks\" group for a few default DSpace Curation Tasks, and (2) a \"Checkm Validation Tasks\" group for all these new Replication tasks.\n\n# Tasks may be organized into named groups which display together in UI drop-downs ui.taskgroups = \\ general = General Purpose Tasks, \\ replicate = Replication Suite Tasks, \\ checkm = Checkm Validation Tasks # Group membership is defined using comma-separated lists of task names, one property per group ui.taskgroup.general = profileformats, requiredmetadata, checklinks ... ui.taskgroup.checkm = transmitmanifest, verifymanifest, fetchmanifest, auditmanifest, removemanifest\n\nProblem Statement and Usage Examples\n\nWe can suppose our data curator has identified a collection of items in her DSpace repository consisting of high-value, born-digital, and unique/irreplaceable (not held elsewhere) content (called the 'Amazing Images' collection). She prudently wishes to insure against catastrophic local loss of this content by keeping a copy or replica of this collection elsewhere (e.g. either on a backup drive, or even in the cloud via a service like DuraCloud). She'd prefer to replicate all her DSpace content, but realizes that storage costs over long periods has made her administration wary, so decides to begin with this collection.\n\nFirst Steps - Estimation\n\nIn order to budget for replication storage, she needs to know the 'size' of the collection. When she asks her sysadmin, he replies that it is easy to give her figures for the whole DSpace asset store, but since collections aren't stored separately, she would have to add up each item's bitstreams in the collection, a rather tedious process. Thus the first task: a reporting tool which operates on natural DSpace objects, rather than storage volumes. The \"Estimate Storage Space for AIP(s)\" (estaipsize) task will give her this ability.\n\nAs this is the first task we are introducing in the Replication Task suite, let's take quick look at how each task is configured/enabled. Each enabled task in this Suite is defined in[dspace]/config/modules/curate.cfg . So, this estaipsize task has its own definition in the file as follows:\n\nIn that same file, each task is given a human-readable \"name\", which is what is displayed in the DSpace Administrative UI:\n\nOf course, both the name of the task ('estaipsize'), and the human-readable name can be easily modifiable in this file. You are free to rename them as you see fit.\n\nNow, getting back to our curator. To utilize this task (or any other task in the Replication Task Suite), she logs in to DSpace, navigates to her collection, and chooses the \"Edit Collection\" option in her administrative interface. From that edit screen, a 'curate' tab provides her with a dropdown list of various curation tasks. Among those tasks, she will find the \"Estimate Storage Space for AIP(s)\" task listed, which she selects and clicks \"Perform\". On the page, the results will display:\n\nID: 123456789/1 (Amazing Images) estimated AIP size: 4 gigabytes\n\nWe should warn that the estimates from this task are rather crude, in that they do not measure the actual size of all AIPs. Rather they just total up the bitstream (file) sizes (and do not include metadata files). However, even this crude estimate should provide a decent idea of overall storage needs.\n\nReplicating\n\nHaving secured approval to replicate 'Amazing Images' collection, our curator obviously needs a task to generate the AIP representations of each item in the collection, and transmit these archive files to the replication storage site (which may be service-backed, local, in the cloud, etc, as will be explored below). This task is the \"Transmit AIP(s) to Storage\" (transmitaip) task.\n\nSince we are now working with AIPs, we should examine how they are configured to the tasks. Most configuration specific to the replication task suite is found at [dspace]/config/modules/replicate.cfg. There are two main properties to set (or accept default values):\n\nThe default values will create a METS-based AIP in the default DSpace AIP Format, compressed into a 'zip' archive. The other alternative supported by the replication task suite is Library of Congress 'Bagit' packaging, which may compressed either into a 'zip' file or a 'tgz' ('gzipped tar'), a compression standard more common in Unix systems.\n\nOur data curator may elect to perform this task in the DSpace Admin UI, or, if the collection is rather large, she may instead 'queue' the task for later execution by using the queueing facility available in the curation system. We should note that the 'transmitaip' task, like all other replication tasks, operates on whatever DSpace object(s) they are given. Thus, if the object is a collection, the task creates (and transmits, of course) an AIP for the collection object itself (metadata and logo), as well as AIPs for each item in the collection. If the task is given an identifier for a single Item, then only one AIP will be created and transmitted.\n\nVerifying Replication\n\nWhile the 'transmitaip' task will report on whether or not it was successful in generating and transmitting AIP(s) to the replication service, our data curator wants the ability (within DSpace) to check whenever she likes that the AIP(s) which were transmitted are still there. A simple task \"Verify AIP(s) exist in Storage\" (verifyaip) can perform this function.\n\nEnsuring Replica Integrity and Accuracy over time\n\nThe 'Amazing Images' collection is comparatively static, meaning that few new items are likely to be added, and most of the metadata in each item is not routinely changed. However, over longer periods of time, cataloging errors are discovered and corrected, perhaps formats become obsolete and new bitstreams are added. If the curator is fastidious about each change, and performs the 'transmitaip' task on each item that has changed, then in general the set of AIP replicas will always be 'in sync' with the repository. However, it useful to have the means to ensure that the replicas agree with the repository without having to create and transmit entirely new ones. Thus the task: \"Audit against AIP(s)\" (auditaip), which can also be thought of as a simple, quick auditing task. When performed on an Item, the task does the following:\n\ngenerates an AIP for the DSpace object locally (but does not transmit it)\n\ncomputes an MD5 checksum on the local AIP\n\nrequests from the replication storage service an MD5 checksum for the AIP in storage\n\ncompares the 2 checksums\n\nThe task will thus fail only if the checksums differ, which can only happen if some part of the DSpace Object (metadata or bitstream) itself differs. If the version of the item that is believed to be authentic is the repository (local) one, then a simple performance of 'transmitaip' task on the item will restore synchrony. For collections and communities, this task also does an 'extent' comparison, which means that it will determine whether the replica store has an AIP for every item known (locally) to be in the collection or community.\n\nRepairing Damage\n\nThe AIPs in the replica store represent an insurance policy, and when 'claims' against that policy are filed, they can cover two situations:\n\neither the repository object is completely missing, and we want to restore it,\n\nor it is damaged and we want to repair the damage with data from the replica store AIP.\n\nA set of replication tasks perform these functions, as described below.\n\nRestoring Object(s)\n\nIf the curator should ever find the need to restore a deleted object, a variety of restoration based tasks are available. The base task is the \"Restore Missing Object(s) from AIP(s)\" (restorefromaip) task.\n\nThis \"Restore Missing Object(s) from AIP(s)\" (restorefromaip) task will do the following:\n\nfetch the replica store AIP for the given object identifier\n\ndecompress it and create a new DSpace object\n\ninstall the object into the repository, including restoring its state (withdrawn, embargoed, etc.)\n\nif the object is a collection or community, all child objects (e.g. items) will also have their AIP fetched, decompressed and restored\n\nNOTE: This restorefromaip task will fail if there is already an object in the repository bearing the identifier given. In other words, it will report a failure if an object is found to already exist.\n\nWhen utilizing METS-based AIPs, two additional restoration tasks are available:\n\nRestore Single Object from AIP (restoresinglefromaip)\n\nThis task acts the same as the default \"restorefromaip\" task, but it does NOT restore any child objects. So, if it is run on a collection, just the collection itself will be restored (items in that collection will not be restored).\n\nRestore Missing Object(s) but Keep Existing Objects (restorekeepexisting)\n\nThis task acts similar to the default \"restorefromaip\" task, but it attempts to skip over any objects which already exist in the repository. In other words, an error is not thrown if an object already exists – rather that entire object (and all its child objects) are skipped over during processing and left unchanged. This mode is identical to the \"Keep Existing\" mode of the DSpace AIP Backup and Restore tool.\n\nReplacing Object(s)\n\nIf the curator should ever find a need to replace a corrupted object or revert an existing object back to the version in remote storage, a variety of replacement tasks are available. The base task is the \"Replace Existing Object(s) with AIP(s)\" (replacewithaip) task.\n\nThe \"Replace Existing Object(s) with AIP(s)\" (replacewithaip) task expects to replace an existing DSpace object. This task will do the following:\n\nfetch the replica store AIP for the given DSpace Object\n\ndecompress it\n\nlocate the existing DSpace object to be replaced & clear out all its existing metadata, files, access rights, etc.\n\nreplace the existing DSpace object metadata, files, access rights, etc. with the information found in the AIP (thus \"overwriting\" or replacing all information in the existing object)\n\nif the object is a collection or community, all child objects (e.g. items) will also have their AIP fetched, decompressed and existing objects replaced\n\nNOTE: When using BagIt-based AIPs, this task will fail if the DSpace object is not found or no longer exists. When using METS-based AIPs, this task will instead perform a restoration of any DSpace object that is not found or no longer exists.\n\nIf you are using METS-based AIPs, an addition replacement task is available:\n\nReplace Single Object from AIP (replacesinglewithaip)\n\nThis task acts the same as the default \"replacewithaip\" task, but it does NOT replace any child objects. So, if it is run on a collection, just the collection metadata will be replaced (items existing in that collection will not be replaced).\n\nCleanup\n\nOrdinarily, a replication arrangement is long standing: the preservation function cannot be fulfilled unless the replicas (here, the AIPs) are always kept and available. However, some collections (or items within them) may be removed for a variety of reasons: legal challenge, de-accession, etc. When the repository no longer locally wants to hold the object, the replica AIP ceases to have value. The task 'Remove AIP(s) from Storage' (removeaip) will permanently delete the replica store AIP for its identifier. As will other replication tasks, if the identifier points to collection or community, all the AIPs of all the members will also be permanently deleted.\n\nKeeping Score\n\nMany storage providers have cost structures that are more complex than simple functions of the total stored bytes: particularly cloud providers have costs associated wth the use of the network to upload and download the stored object. An object that occupies 2 megaBytes might cost far more over time than a 1 gigaByte object, if the former is downloaded 1000 times for every time the latter is. The replication system provides a very rudimentary task to help manage and track these factors: 'Read Odometer' (readodometer). This task simply displays the readings from the replication system that records cumulative use. The statistics are:\n\ntotal number of objects (AIPS, typically) in the replica store\n\ntotal size of all objects\n\ntotal number of bytes downloaded from the store\n\ntotal number of bytes uploaded to the store\n\nThese figures can be used as a means of checking and validating service charges from storage providers.\n\nAutomation (Recommended)\n\nWhile the coordinated use of the tasks described above can provide the basis for a solid replication strategy and practice, there are several processes that could necessitate a fair amount of curatorial work. For example, in the discussion on ensuring integrity of AIPs over time, we remarked that vigilance was required by the curator to transmit new AIPs whenever Items change. It is possible to leverage existing facilities in DSpace to substantially reduce this effort through automation.\n\nThe Replication Task Suite includes a so-called 'event consumer', that can 'listen for' any changes to objects in the repository. When this consumer detects that a change has occurred (e.g. object added/changed/deleted), it will automatically queue specific AIPs to be regenerated.\n\nUsing the event consumer, the curator can essentially operate replication in 'auto-pilot' after the first complete transmission of AIPs. This provides a \"set it and forget it\" option for your backup solution.\n\nMore information about setting up automation is available in the Automation Options configuration section above.\n\nReplica Storage / Backup Location\n\nFor the replication of AIPs to be of any significant value, they must be stored in a safe, persistent, reliable, accessible, and available location. The replication tasks of transmitting, fetching, etc all rely on the storage provider configured.\n\nThe Replication Task Suite provides three storage provider options:\n\nSystem Folder: The default configuration (LocalObjectStore) simply writes the AIPs to the local directory configured by the 'store.dir' property in replicate.cfg. This is not intended to be a production-grade solution, since a failure in the DSpace asset store could likely also affect this storage (unless it is on a separate physical drive). This base option is provided mostly as a way to begin to work with the replication tasks without worrying about finding a storage provider.\n\nDuraCloud: For replicating in earnest, a service like DuraCloud is recommended (DuraCloudObjectStore). Such a service has the additional benefits of providing offsite storage/replication while also providing additional preservation management tools. Note that this service must be established and provisioned prior to use. For more information on DuraCloud see: http://www.duracloud.org\n\nMounted Drive: Alternatively, a MountableObjectStore option may be used if you wish to keep your AIP storage more \"local\" (e.g. on a local SAN or storage network). This option acts similar to the default configuration (in that it writes to the local directory configured by the 'store.dir' property in replicate.cfg). But, the expectation is that directory is actually a mounted storage drive, so AIPs are written in such a way as to support more complex storage architectures (e.g. an NFS-mounted store).\n\nMore information about each of these storage options (and how to configure them) is available in the Storage Options configuration section above.\n\nCodebase / Development\n\nThe following are notes for developers on how to checkout the Replication Task Suite code & build it from source."
