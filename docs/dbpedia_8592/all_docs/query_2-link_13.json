        "text": "#Rethink Web Literacy!\n\nThis project seeks to invigorate a whole new concept of “Pact” model in Web literacy among local young people in Cape Town, South Africa by providing an enabling environment, multidisciplinary and safe space for informal learning and exchange of experiences around the digital space. The aim is to provide young people with the skills they need to become digital players, content producers and leaders so they can advance in their personal and professional lives.\n\nOarabile Mudongo\n\nCape Town, South Africa\n\nOpen source enthusiast voluntarily, product specialist professionally. I have been contributing to Mozilla projects for the past 6+ years now. Started off as an FSA and climbed all the way to being a Mozilla Rep. Currently focusing on building a better local Mozilla community and volunteer retention.\n\nCohort A\n\n@omudongo\n\n@oarabilemudon\n\nActivismo Lenguas: a online resource exchange for language digital activism\n\nThe project is a part of Rising Voices' indigenous language digital activism initiative that seeks to collaboratively create a portal for peer learning and exchange for and with indigenous communities participating in an open and linguistically diverse web. Built upon the shared experiences of indigenous language digital activists in Latin America, the portal will document existing initiatives, resources to start a project what tools to use, and what strategies to follow to make your project of language digital activism sustainable.\n\nMónica Bonilla\n\nBogotá, Colombia\n\nHello! My name is Monica Bonilla, I am from Colombia and I am a linguist and researcher. I have worked on projects of inclusion, empowerment and digital literacy with different communities, especially with speakers of indigenous languages from several Latin American countries.\n\nCohort A\n\n@Gutemonik\n\n@Gutemonik\n\nCommons Platform (Mycelium?)\n\nThe Commons Platform is an open source, decentralised commons-owned social network for community organising, activism, resource-sharing, crowd-sourcing, open access research and data, independent media, ethical commerce and a new economy. Mission: to create a network that every person who wants to can access by 2025, which will enable them to collaborate to create solutions for themselves, their communities and the wider world, by harnessing and developing new open source technologies.\n\nNick Wood\n\nLondon\n\nI live in London and I work largely on a group of collective projects with Sophie Varlow. My area of interest in relation to them ranges from building Consentful and open working cultures, accessibility and diversity, to clear communications and organisational systems. In tech terms I’m interested particularly if concepts of consent and safety and the needs of the marginalised can be successfully considered in software development. I’ve worked most of my life in fields where diversity, accessibility, organisational and community development meet occupational psychology and open communication. Often from surprisingly different angles. On the other hand I have a degree in Military Studies (specialising in the psychology of revolutionary warfare and the organisational evolution of military organisms) and am currently developing a talk for a group in London on the RAFs Strategic Bombing of Germany as an example of the incrementalism of evil.\n\nCohort A\n\n@Nickwood225\n\nfloWeaver\n\nMany kinds of data can be thought of as 'flows': energy and materials moving through industry, money flowing through the economy, telephone lines moving between providers, voters moving between parties. floWeaver is an open-source framework for analysing and visualising flow data using Sankey diagrams. In my research, I'm particularly interested in physical flows of materials, aiming to reduce the 20% of global industrial carbon emissions due to making these materials. My vision is build common tools with other researchers for analysing and visualising data about physical stocks & flows, so researchers can effectively share data and communicate results; I hope to grow this project beyond my research group to be a core tool for this analysis.\n\nRick Lupton\n\nCambridge, UK\n\nI'm a researcher at the University of Cambridge, using data science to understand the environmental impacts of the way society uses resources, such as energy or steel. At the moment I'm particularly interested in ontologies and data integration, modelling uncertainty, and open tools for visualising the results.\n\nCohort A\n\n@ricklupton\n\n@ricklupton\n\nIndia.data: Indian data analysis and inference for the wide open world\n\nIndia.data is an open source initiative with two aims: 1) to aid government decision making and policy framing through knowledge and trends drawn from data based visualizations, graphs, maps and charts; and 2) knowledge dissemination to the citizens of India and everyone else on the internet by analysing, cleaning, segregating and visualizing the vast troves of data made public through OGD, the open Goverment data initiative.\n\nKaran Sapolia\n\nJammu\n\nAm a Computer Science undergrad at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, India. Love coding, Photography and Physics. Author of the 'v8codecov' npm package. Global finalist of the Youtube Spacelab competiton. Currently studying web browsers and JS compilers/interpreters like V8 and Webkit. Javascript, Machine Learning and Web Technologies are my thing. Am lately in love with Rust, Node, PWAs, React, Web Components and the connected JS ecosystem. OSS enthusiast. Working on positive, impactful and open tech disruption really motivates me.\n\nCohort A\n\n@karansapolia\n\n@karansapolia\n\nKickstart the city (working title)\n\nBirmingham, the UK’s second largest city, has few options for public discussion of online privacy and security, with most work focused in London. I want build my research and experience into a collaborative community that kickstarts the West Midlands conversation (2.5 million pop.). I hope to find collaborators (activists, artists, technologists) to develop new projects leading to long-term impact. End documentation will inspire other regions to kickstart their own hubs of activity.\n\nFiona Cullinan\n\nBirmingham\n\nFiona Cullinan is a writer/editor from Birmingham, UK. She took a sabbatical last year and ended up working at The Glass Room London and MozFest. Vital stats: has three semi-famous rabbits @bunminster, 70+ journals, and thinks she might be the oldest in the cohort as she has just turned 50. Always curious.\n\nCohort A\n\n@katchooo\n\nMaker Learning Curriculum for Rapid Prototyping\n\nMy first exposure to hardware prototyping was because of a rapid prototyping class at Georgia Tech where I worked on a Arduino Weather Lamp as seen here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubEovpiNTng. And while the project itself was not very sophisticated or hi-fidelity it served as an amazing training ground for learning hardware hacking. My project aims to capture the curriculum taught in the class and make it available to instructors so they can appropriate it to their own context of teaching.\n\nMBac - Computer vision tool for bacterial motility assays\n\nBacterial surface colonization and biofilm formation depends on motility in surface environments. Therefore studying bacterial motility is very important to better understand bacterial virulence and persistence. Unfortunately setups vary quite a lot and the reproducibility of bacterial motility assays is comparatively low. For this reason I want to develop an open source imaging setup and computer vision based software to perform and analyse bacterial motility assays!\n\nMethod Cards: Bringing Web Literacy Curriculum into UX\n\nWeb literacy is important for all people, but what about the researchers and designers who dedicate their careers to user-centered products and services? What tools do they need to ensure an open, accessible web? Reading, writing and participating on the web are the foundations of literacy. Once achieved, how do we know we are designing and shipping accessible products and services? This project aims to bring Mozilla’s Web Literacy curriculum into the domain of UX.\n\nOpen Apparel Registry (OAR)\n\nMy company - Sourcemap (sourcemap.com) - is working with the C&A Foundation to design and build an online open map + database of all apparel factories worldwide. The OAR aims to create one standardized registry of factory names and addresses that will a) eliminate issues with matching factories across multiple, inconsistent databases, and b) facilitate collaboration across all kinds of stakeholders working in the apparel industry - from brands and suppliers to civil society organizations.\n\nRhea Rakshit\n\nMumbai\n\nI'm a user experience / product designer interested in the intersection of design, behavioral science and social impact. I work as the VP of Product for a New York based technology company called Sourcemap, which enables companies to achieve greater transparency and increase visibility into their supply chains, by using Sourcemap's proprietary supply chain mapping software. I currently split my time between New York and Mumbai.\n\nCohort A\n\n@rrakshit\n\nParliamentary Debates Open\n\nThe tool aims to make parliamentary speeches open and accessible covering Hungarian parliamentary debates since 1990. The scraped speeches are processed using Natural Language Processing, ElasticSearch is used for search backend, and Kibana will be applied for data visualization. The minimal viable product is a filterable dashboard for name, topic, party, and date, returning the relevant speeches. Additional features will include top lists, histograms and comparisons.\n\nBorbala Toth\n\nBarcelona / Budapest\n\nI work as a data analyst and project manager, and also studying Data Science and Big Data at the University of Barcelona. My background is in Political Science and Economics. I am interested in current affairs and data science. In my free time I like to mingle these two.\n\nCohort A\n\n@borbota\n\n@borbota\n\nTeaching & Learning on/with the Open Web Expertise Hub - TLOWEH\n\nIn a media environment where we have increasingly lost control of our personal data and commodifying spaces are so ubiquitous, it is essential to nurture and understand the value of those digital ‘oasis’ that allow people to take more ownership of their online presence. TLOWEH aims to gather insights, inspiring examples and models contributed by educators and learners from all over the world who have incorporated the Open Web into their teaching and learning practice (e.g Domains of One's Own).\n\nDaniel Villar-Onrubia\n\nCoventry\n\nI work at Coventry University's Disruptive Media Learning Lab (DMLL) as Principal Innovation Lead. My work focuses on the adoption of digital practices and cultures within Higher Education, with a special interest in Open Education, online media literacies and Internet-based intercultural collaborations. One of the most interesting things I am doing as part of my current role is to lead on the development of a Domains of One's Own (DoOO) initiative.\n\nCohort A\n\n@drdvo\n\n@villaronrubia\n\nLuca Morini\n\nCoventry\n\nI am a Research Associate at the Disruptive Media Learning Lab of Coventry University. I hold a Master's Degree in Psychology and a Doctorate in Education and Communication, obtained researching into the social, cultural and pedagogical dynamics which occur in Do-It-Yourself amateur game design communities. My main areas of interest are participatory cultures (especially game cultures), critical pedagogy, and systems thinking.

We were awarded a microgrant from HOT in June and are organising a 3 day training conference in Dar in December.\n\nJanet Chapman\n\nLondon\n\nI'm the founder of Crowd2Map Tanzania, a crowdsourced mapping project aiming to put rural Tanzania on the map. Since 2015, we have been adding schools, hospitals, roads, buildings and villages to OpenStreetMap, an open source map available to all, with the help of over 4000 volunteers worldwide and 200 on the ground in Tanzania. With minimal budget and no staff we have so far added over 2 million buildings and mapped over 70,000 sq kilometres. In June we were awarded a microgrant by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap to train community mappers in 8 areas of Tanzania, and presented a community webinar for them. We have also been featured on Al Jazeera, The Guardian and Missing Maps.\n\nCohort C\n\n@jachapman82\n\n@jachapman82\n\nIGNITE\n\nThis project aims to put up a training and incentive program in Science Communication to young scientists. The first step would be to gather information about scientists’ needs and worries when they are asked to do SciComm. The next step will be to put up (fun and not much time consuming) training modules focused on these information. We will also look for international applications for funding, so we could offer a fellowship for the trainees or a prize in a contest at the end of the training.\n\nlab.js\n\nWe're trying to make building browser-based behavioral experiments easy and accessible. To this end, our project provides a visual interface for constructing studies (e.g. in psychology, economics, or cognitive- and neuroscience) without code.

This is an exciting opportunity given the popularity of our existing resources. The community team is a small group of individuals, the content team even smaller, so we plan to engage the community to help us achieve our goals.\n\nBeyond Activismo (BA)\n\nIs exciting because it aims to document the experience and stories of activists in causes related to Human Rights around the world. Our purpose is to understand how people from different cultures, religions and countries have in common the activism. In addition, we are trying to share the experiences of these activists with others to serve as a source of inspiration. How? doing interviews, photos, videos, then translating the content into different languages and publishing them in the BA website\n\nDanny Rayman Labrin\n\nBerlin\n\nLawyer from Chile, in 2017 I moved to Berlin. I study a LL.M. of International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law. I had worked and I still work for NGOs in research and litigation about human rights, in particularly in digital rights. I also worked as Photographer making interviews and photos for different webzines. The above both are my interests that mark my path and I try to combine them.\n\nCohort D\n\n@dannyrayman\n\n@dannyrayman\n\nCitizen's Proxy\n\nWith this project I'm trying to make a digital place and physical experience that connect the citizens, teacher in particulars, with the importance of learn and teach about Net Neutrality, privacy an Open Web for the defence of our rights and a collective constructions of a healthy Internet.\n\nDigital Grassroots\n\nDigital Grassroots is a program formed by 2017 Internet Society Youth@IGF fellows, all of whom are below 25 years old. Our program aims to actively engage youths in addressing internet problems at a grassroots level with a bottom-up approach.

Scholars who wish to work openly do not have time to investigate the topic in addition to their already full teaching and research schedules. Few online resources exist to address these issues in an academic context. We hope to empower researchers/instructors to take charge of their own digital safety through the creation of an online toolkit that can be used at point of need and incorporated into higher education coursework.\n\nETER || open educational resources on citizen science & environmental monitoring for teachers\n\nOur project aims to disseminate open source practices among high school teachers by co-prototyping with them an open air quality monitor, publishing open air quality data they can reuse with students and documenting the experience in an OER kit. We want teachers to experience the potential that open practices have to address local community issues. Teachers can play a key role in influencing students towards local social innovation, but most of them feel 'outdated' regarding ICTs.\n\nJulieta Arancio\n\nBuenos Aires, Argentina\n\nPhD candidate at Universidad Nacional de Quilmes & CENIT (Buenos Aires, Argentina), studying the Open Hardware movement in Latin America. I have a background in Environmental Sciences and in my free time I'm either at R’lyeh, a local hacklab where I participate in citizen science projects, or playing the clarinet or the flute. Feminist!\n\nCohort D\n\n@thessaly\n\n@cassandreces\n\nFlyCAGE\n\nFlyCAGE is a web application that allow users to search for genes in fruit flies that follow a specific expression pattern. The user can either enter a known gene name to find other genes with similar expression profiles, or the user can enter a custom expression pattern based on experimental data to find genes that follow the pattern. FlyCAGE would be useful in identifying candidate genes involved in a given process and discovering regulatory interactions in genetic networks.\n\nGirlsGetGeeky\n\nThe project will take ladies through programming skills. This will be done through Ruby On Rails. We will have weekly meet up every Saturday. The main aim of the project is to bridge the gap in women in tech which has been decreasing in the past decades. At the end of the program each attendee will have a working web application. It will also open doors for the attendees to the many women in tech opportunities.\n\nStellaMaris Njage\n\nNairobi, Kenya\n\nStella is a great lover of tech. She enjoys learning new things and solving problems.

Tons of programs are fully featured and yet little documented. An HACKccessibility wizard will help developers to document undocumented code and a webapp populated by data from an analysis of git repositories will provide insight on pieces of code with regards to their documentation and code patterns. A set of free software projects exposing little documentation will be contacted and proposed to use the wizard for documentation sprints.\n\nJibé Bohuon\n\nParis\n\nI am a science lover, fascinated by how tools and methods enable progress in knowledge and how their absence prevent us from doing what we dream of. Involved in improving the conditions of independants scholars in France. Currently employed as a research software engineer in a public lab, soon independant worker in a co-op of independant workers.\n\nCohort D\n\n@jibe-b\n\n@jibe_jeybee\n\nInformation Activism Student Group\n\nMy project draws on our students’ activist nature and commitment to addressing social inequities and empowering students to be open leaders. Our students tend to be very interested in engaged when discussing information privilege. Thus, the purpose of an information activism student club would be twofold: students will lead campus efforts to 1) to promote Open Access and reduce barriers to information by supporting openness and 2) to advocate for OER adoption across the institution.\n\nCynthia Mari Orozco\n\nLos Angeles\n\nCynthia is the Librarian for Equitable Services at East Los Angeles College, a community college that serves over 30,000 students in the East and Southeast Los Angeles areas. She is interested in bringing conversations around openness to local community colleges, specifically engaging students into these conversations.\n\nCohort D\n\n@cynthinee\n\n@cynthinee\n\nMoney Talks and So Should We: Personal Assessment Tools for Finance Education\n\nAt Pockets Change we’re changing the way money is taught. We combine Hip Hop, Finance, and Design Thinking to build financial capability in K-12 and early adulthood. Our workshops and lessons are a start but useful and accessible finance personal assessments are severely lacking in education. Those that exist do little to support the development of self-efficacy and understanding, rather they focus on calculating compound interest and other out of date skills. Let’s build them!!\n\nAndrea Ferrero\n\nSanta Barbara, CA\n\nI’m the co-founder of Pockets Change, we work with students, families, and teachers across the country to change the way finance is taught. I’m based in Santa Barbara, California but call coffee shops and learning communities in cities around the world home too. I have over a decade of experience in education, business, and tech.\n\nCohort D\n\n@AndreaPocketsChange\n\n@PocketsChange\n\nNewbook Digital Texts\n\nThe project that I co-direct aims to publish lesser known yet significant historical texts. The scope of our work has included 19th century Nile and Iraqi travel journals, Georgian literature, and Ottoman poetry.We aim to bring these important works to a global audience by publishing them openly online, along with the digital tools that we are developing to assist us with our work.\n\nSarah Ketchley\n\nSeattle\n\nI’m an Egyptologist with an interest in Digital Humanities. I’m based at the University of Washington in Seattle, and manage Newbook Digital Texts, an undergraduate internship program transcribing, encoding and publishing a selection of historical material from the Near East, the Baltic States and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nCohort D\n\n@ketchley\n\n@sarahketchley\n\nNoConnect\n\nNoConnect is a project to connect the unconnected part of the world. It is an android application (for now)which enables chat & message passing without any network, off the grid. It creates a decentralized, end to end encrypted scalable peer to peer mesh network.It can use a combination of wifi and bluetooth interchangeably to create the mesh network. It is not bound to any one of them, can use both separately or mixed in a network. Also if 1 node has Internet that can be shared among everyone\n\nRabimba Karanjai\n\nHouston, TX\n\nRabimba Karanjai is a graduate student studying at Rice University, Houston - Texas.

Many researchers view Open as a potential risk and they may not see their fields represented in well-known Open advocates. By collecting Open success stories and making them discoverable by storyteller location, discipline, career level, and language, we can better represent the success stories of open practitioners and encourage other researchers to go Open.\n\nOpen Yeast Engineering Project (OYEP)\n\nWould you drink a GMO beer? What if you brewed it yourself? The open yeast engineering project (OYEP) at BosLab is an open-ended exploration into yeast engineering. We get together, run experiments, do analyses, and engineer yeast strains to produce flavors, fragrances, and small molecules with the hopes of dextinctifying forgotten flavors or using some resultant strains to produce glowing banana flavored chocolate stout and artificial rosé.\n\nOpenHeart Project\n\nThe OpenHeart Project aims to improve research practices within the field of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) to improve quality of life for heart failure patients. We aim to promote collaboration and standardization through an open-source research platform.

As lines between ‘online life’ & ‘real life’ become increasingly irrelevant, we're realizing how much data is generated by--and about--each of us. This data may be about me, but whose is it, really? What rights over it & its use do I have? Whose Data aims to make it easier for everyday Canadians to know the answers to those questions and participate in related discussions that affect our lives & livelihoods.\n\nSam Burton\n\nToronto\n\nI'm trying to make sense of our connected world and find ways to make it work for humans (instead of the other way around).
