        "text": "The first scholarly use of the term “cloud computing” was in 1997 by Ramnath Chellappa though the concept originated in 1960s. Cloud computing is a new concept of computer and information science especially in IT services industry which can be termed as third revolution after Personal Computers and Internet. In cloud, the information is stored on the internet and distributed via network at any large network environment. The main concern is data sending, receiving, storing and dissemination of data whenever required by the users. The hardware and software are integral parts of cloud computing, without these we can’t imagine services provided by cloud environment. This paper also discusses about the characteristics, types, layers, merits and demerits of cloud computing, adopting cloud computing and impact of cloud computing in libraries and concludes that the cloud computing model will encourage libraries and their users to participate in a network and community of libraries by enabling them to reuse information and socialize around information. It can also create a powerful, unified presence for libraries on the Web and give users a local, group and global reach."
