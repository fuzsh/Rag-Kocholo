This problem has become more important in the Web era with the consequential information explosion the Internet has brought to our lives. Lack of interoperability and information explosion make it much more difficult to retrieve, disambiguate and integrate information coming from a wide variety of sources. The common characteristic among all these sources of information is that they can be represented using lightweight ontologies, which provide the formal representation upon which it is possible to reason automatically about hierarchical structures such as classifications, database schemas, library catalogs, and file system directories.\n\nSemantic matching is a fundamental technique applicable in areas such as resource discovery, data integration, query translation, schema and ontology merging, peer to peer networks, data migration, and agent communication. Semantic matching is a type of ontology matching technique that uses semantic information encoded in lightweight ontologies. It operates on graph-like structures and finds the nodes that are semantically related. It has been proposed as a valid solution to the semantic heterogeneity problem, namely managing the diversity in knowledge.\n\nS-Match is an open source semantic matching framework that provides several semantic matching algorithms and facilities for the development of new ones. It includes components for transforming tree-like structures into lightweight ontologies, where each node label in the tree is translated into a propositional description logic (DL) formula, which unambiguously codifies the meaning of the node. S-Match contains the implementation of the basic semantic matching, minimal semantic matching, and structure preserving semantic matching (SPSM) algorithms. The basic semantic matching algorithm is a general purpose matching algorithm, very customizable and suitable for many applications. The minimal semantic matching algorithm exploits additional knowledge encoded in the structure of the input and is capable of producing minimal mapping and maximal mapping at almost no extra cost. The SPSM is a type of semantic matching that produces a similarity score and a mapping preserving structural properties: (i) one-to-one correspondences between semantically related nodes; (ii) functions matched to functions and variables to variables.\n\nThe key contributions of the S-Match framework are:\n\na working open source implementation of semantic matching algorithms;\n\nseveral interfaces ranging from easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI) to Application Program Interface (API), suitable for different purposes varying from running a quick and easy experiment to embedding S-Match in other projects;\n\nthe implementation of three different versions of semantic matching algorithms, each suitable for different purposes, and the flexibility for integrating new algorithms and linguistic oracles tailored for particular domains;\n\nan open architecture extensible to work with different data formats with a ready-to-run implementation of the basic formats.\n\nOn the semantic matching project home page you can find the project documentation and downloads, subscribe to our S-Match Announce mailing list, leave us feedback or request a feature in S-Match Trac system, and stay up to date with the S-Match news feed.\n\nLaunch of the University of Central Lancashire Research Repository: CloK\n\nContributed by:\n\nHelen Cooper\n\nRepository Manager\n\nLIS, University of Central Lancashire\n\nPreston, United Kingdom\n\nCLoK@UCLAN.ac.uk\n\nIn September 2010 the University of Central Lancashire Learning and Information Services will be launching the Research Repository for UCLAN with CloK  a repository service designed to complement scholarly workflows, policies and practices. This is part of an ambitious project to develop a culture of digital preservation and self archive at UCLAN, with institutional commitment to Open Access at the heart of the University Community.\n\nThe objectives of the initial JISC start-up funding were to create:\n\nan operational and sustainable institutional repository for UCLAN hosting a variety of digital assets to consistent and interoperable standards\n\na robust technological and governance infrastructure according to national and international information-environment standards\n\na culture that accepts the principles of an Open Access approach to the management of research and learning\n\nThe main thrust of the start-up phase of the project has been to support the UCLAN Research Strategy in providing a tool that will \"boost the quality, scope and capacity of our research activities; ... (supporting) ... genuine evidence-based claims to be world-class (and) focusing especially on the enhancement of each member of staff's abilities and range of activities,\"\n\nWith the first two targets already achieved, by March 2011 we will have the post Research Assessment Exercise 2008 research publications from all schools and units across the University recorded on the repository, with a large proportion of full-text included. This includes an opt-out mandate for post graduate theses in place from September 2010, moving to an e-only submission requirement in 2011.\n\nThe third part of the project, to engender a culture that adopts Open Access archiving of all digital intellectual products, is already being developed. Digital preservation of the archive has moved up the teaching and learning agenda at UCLAN, and later this year we will be developing a learning resource repository to complement the research archive.\n\nDetails of the CLoK project can be found at http://www.uclan.ac.uk/clok/ and the repository is at http://clok.uclan.ac.uk.\n\nLogins for Life Project\n\nContributed by:\n\nLeo Lyons\n\nAnalyst, Logins for Life Project Team\n\nUniversity of Kent\n\nKent, United Kingdom\n\nL.Lyons@kent.ac.uk\n\nThe University of Kent is running a JISC-funded project, Logins for Life, to explore the provision of lifelong digital identities and online services to staff and students. Inherent in such provision is a method for dealing with the changing roles  and possibly multiple roles  of the id holder during his/her relationship with the University.\n\nCreating a relationship with prospective students  maybe whilst still at school  is beneficial for both parties. Maintaining a relationship beyond graduation or retirement also has benefits.\n\nMaking it easier during initial enquiries to find and bookmark information is an obvious way in which the relationship with prospects can be enhanced. Similarly, providing targeted suggestions, links and opportunities for discussion with other enquirers, with current students and alumni through forums, may be attractive and improve recruitment rates. Hard facts about courses and facilities are not the only criteria, and a chance to learn something about the culture of a place might come from joining an online community.\n\nProviding lifelong email  some HEIs (Higher Education Institutions) are already doing this  helps maintain contact with graduates and may influence their choice of post-graduate studies. It enhances links with alumni, allows them to keep their contact details up to date, and ensures their addresses on published papers do not become obsolete as soon as they leave the university. However, there is obviously a cost involved.\n\nSome suggestions are more controversial  and could have a higher cost. Is there a case for providing alumni, some of whom may have gone on to post-graduate studies elsewhere, with continuing access to online resources? What are the licensing implications for such a move and who pays?\n\nIf HEIs are to attract people to engage at an earlier age, we need to explore how they might want to do that. The project will examine how the integration of social networking applications (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and protocols like OpenID might be appropriate at different stages of a user's relationship with HEIs. Are registration forms and usernames and passwords essential in order to get a prospectus, or could we accept a Facebook account or OpenID credentials?\n\nThe Logins for Life project is a collaboration between teams from the Information Services department (led by John Sotillo) and the School of Computing (led by Professor David Chadwick). David's team are building a linking application, using Open Source protocols, that allows users to 'marry' existing digital identities to a University account, enabling access, with a predetermined level of assurance, to online resources via Facebook, OpenID, etc.\n\nInformation gathering for the project is drawing on interviews with stakeholders both externally and internally. Library staff in particular and all staff managing and administering systems are informing the project, and the team are also looking at best practice in other HEIs and beyond. The views of students already at Kent and the new intake in the autumn will be sampled via an online survey.\n\nContact from interested parties is welcome via the Logins for Life blog. Further information is available on the project web pages.\n\nThe National e-Infrastructure for Social Simulation (NeISS) Project\n\nContributed by:\n\nMark Birkin\n\nProfessor of Spatial Analysis and Policy\n\nUniversity of Leeds\n\nLeeds, United Kingdom\n\nm.h.birkin@leeds.ac.uk\n\nSocial simulation is an increasingly important and valuable technique in both research and policy-making. In particular, methods involving the use of individual 'agents' have been used to study problems such as the formation of economic markets, transmission of diseases, social and political negotiations, criminal behaviour, and housing preferences. In practice, however, realising the full potential of social simulation is often hampered by one or more of the following factors: lack of appropriate data; access to suitable models; availability of computation; and the ability to understand, visualise and share results. Crucially, individual users will rarely have the full range of skills or access to supporting technologies for the whole social simulation process. The National e-Infrastructure for Social Simulation (NeISS) is a project that aims to address these problems through development and application of the latest computational technologies.\n\nSupported by JISC for three years as part of its Information Environments programme, the project leader is Professor Mark Birkin of the School of Geography, University of Leeds. In addition to geographers, the participants include sociologists, computer scientists, and e-health specialists from the Universities of Glasgow, Stirling, Southampton, Manchester, University College London and Daresbury Laboratory.\n\nDevelopment work so far has concentrated on linking together the processes of data extraction, simulation, visualisation and analysis as e-research 'portlets'; on publishing the resulting simulation experiments and workflows as objects that may be edited, transferred and shared; and on combining these portlets into web-enabled portals that can support social simulation research, policy analysis and decision-making. Applications have focused on the deployment of social simulation to support health care delivery, housing, land-use and transport policy. Whilst a process of requirements gathering and evaluation with prospective users has already begun, the NeISS team is eager to hear from individuals or groups who desire to engage more closely with this exciting research agenda. For more information, see the NeISS website (http://www.neiss.org.uk/) or contact the project leader (m.h.birkin@leeds.ac.uk).\n\nThe Xpert Project: A Distributed Repository for OER\n\nContributed by:\n\nPatrick Lockley (Learning Support Development Officer)\n\nand Steve Stapleton (Open Learning Support Officer)\n\nThe University of Nottingham\n\npatrick.lockley@nottingham.ac.uk and steven.stapleton@nottingham.ac.uk\n\nXPERT (Xerte Public E-Learning ReposiTory) was a JISC-funded project to explore the potential of delivering and supporting a distributed repository of e-learning resources, created and seamlessly published via the commonly used web technology of RSS Feeds. RSS feeds are common across newspaper and magazine style websites, allowing a subscriber to receive updates when new content is added to the site.\n\nWith the addition of RSS feed generation to the Xerte suite of tools, this allows several partner institutions to jointly produce content for publication in the open-access Xpert repository. Xerte Online Toolkits is a suite of open-source browser-based tools that allow content developers to develop rich, interactive and highly accessible learning content quickly and easily, and to seamlessly publish that content online. Collaboration with other content developers is supported, and it is easy to share and re-use content with other users. The system is extensible by developers and provides a proven, flexible and powerful solution, and it is in use all over the world.\n\nThe Xerte tools have been designed to make the addition of metadata to the learning resources easy and to expose them for harvesting by open-access repositories. Using RSS, carrying the richer Dublin Core metadata, allows more metadata to be searched and learning objects to be categorised easily in the repository. Crucially, resources remain with the institution that developed them, removing many of the barriers to repository use that other initiatives have encountered when requiring that the content itself be submitted (usually via uploading a file).\n\nBuilding on the work done with a number of partner institutions, creators of learning resources can contribute to XPERT via RSS feeds, either created seamlessly (and automatically) through local installations of Xerte Online Toolkits, or through alternative RSS (or OAI) feed generators. Learners and educators can use XPERT to search a growing database of open learning resources suitable for students at all levels of study in a wide range of different subjects. XPERT also includes RSS feeds from many Open Educational Resources (OER) sites worldwide and therefore provides a rapidly growing rich resource of high quality e-learning resources from multiple institutions. To date (Summer 2010) the Xpert repository contains over 66,000 items.\n\nUseful links\n\nThe Xpert repository: http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/xpert\n\nThe Xerte project pages: http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/xerte\n\nPresentation on Xerte and Xpert at the Open Learning Conference November 2009: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LewfluR6leg&feature=PlayList&p=1ADDE924D7A740F2&index=5\n\nI N T H E N E W S\n\nSeptember/October 2010\n\nIntroducing 'DuraCloud Open Source': Preservation in the Cloud\n\nSeptember 9, 2010 announcements from Carol Minton Morris, DuraSpace:\n\n1) \"The DuraSpace organization is pleased to announce the release of DuraCloud version 0.6. This latest version of the DuraCloud software, a platform which utilizes commercial cloud infrastructure, is now available for download from subversion: https://svn.duraspace.org/duracloud/tags/duracloud-0.6.0/.

For background information see 'About PADI', http://www.nla.gov.au/padi/about.html.\"\n\n\"As is to be expected with any portal to Web based documents maintenance of web links becomes progressively more demanding over time. Websites are redesigned, migrated to new platforms, URLs are changed, projects and their websites cease, so called persistent identifiers are not, and even when web documents or pages are archived in a web archive, questions arise as to which version of an archived page to link to (which date or even which archive as copies may be held in multiple web archives with different levels of completeness). The current structure of PADI requires the Library to commit around 0.5 of a fulltime staff member to locate, describe and enter links to new information sources and to maintain links to existing resources. Although originally conceived as a cooperative contribution model, increasingly the burden of adding material to PADI has fallen to the NLA as input from elsewhere has almost ceased.\"\n\n\"The information-seeking and information-providing mechanisms of a community also change over time. After reviewing the gateway service the Library has concluded that the existing website, database and list no longer meet the current needs and that the Library's resources are best invested elsewhere. While there may be more efficient ways of building a service like PADI today, using Web 2.0 tools, the Library is unable to make the investment in converting the existing service.\"\n\n\"Reluctantly  because we still find PADI useful ourselves  we believe we cannot sustain PADI and have decided to cease maintaining it.\"\n\n\"A copy of the website has been archived in PANDORA, Australia's Web Archive. The existing live website will remain available until the end of 2010; however no new resources have been added since the start of July 2010 and the existing links will not be actively managed. The archives of the padiforum-l list will continue to be available, however no new postings will be accepted from 30 September 2010.\"\n\nFor more information, please contact PADI (Preserving Access to Digital Information) at padi@nla.gov.au.\n\nEyes on the Prize Interviews: The Complete Series Collection\n\nSeptember 2, 2010 announcement from Cassandra Stokes, Washington University St. Louis,  \"This summer, the Washington University Libraries are making available a vast collection of complete, unedited transcripts of nearly 300 interviews recorded for the award-winning PBS documentary series Eyes on the Prize.\"\n\n\"The transcripts, many of them never before seen, document the memories and first-hand accounts of hundreds of men and women who served on the front lines of the American Civil Rights movement.

This Recommended Practice defines an XML schema to facilitate the exchange of financial information related to the acquisition of library resources between systems, such as an ILS and an ERMS.\"\n\n\"CORE identifies a compact yet useful structure for query and delivery of relevant acquisitions data.\"\n\n\"CORE was originally intended for publication as a NISO standard. However, following a draft period of trial use that ended March 2010, the CORE Working Group and NISO's Business Information Topic Committee voted to approve the document as a Recommended Practice. This decision was in part based on the lack of uptake during the trial period as a result of recent economic conditions, and was motivated by the high interest in having CORE available for both current and future development as demand for the exchange of cost information increases. Making the CORE protocol available as a Recommended Practice allows ILS and ERM vendors, subscription agents, open-source providers, and other system developers to now implement the XML framework for exchanging cost information between systems.\"\n\nFor more information, please see the full press release.\n\nIMLS Seeks Comments on Public Library Survey\n\nAugust 27, 2010  \"In a Federal Register notice published on Monday August 23, 2010 (see http://www.imls.gov/pdf/PLS_60-day_notice_2010.pdf), IMLS issued a call for comments on its Public Library Survey.
