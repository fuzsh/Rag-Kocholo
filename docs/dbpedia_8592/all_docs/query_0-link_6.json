        "text": "Erin, (@eeohalloran), is a librarian by training. She’s into open source software, digital asset management, and preservation. She works for the US-based non-profit, DuraSpace. She lives in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada.\n\nBill works at DuraSpace in the development and operations of hosted software services based on open source technology and is interested in sustainable models which allow open source software projects to be built and expanded. He lives in Florida.\n\nErin and Bill were selected to join the current round of Mozilla Open Leaders with their project Open Sourcing DuraCloud: Beyond the License.\n\nI interviewed Erin and Bill to learn more about Open Sourcing DuraCloud: Beyond the License and how you can help at Mozilla’s Global Sprint 2018.\n\nWhat is Open Sourcing DuraCloud: Beyond the License?\n\nOur goal is to build up a community around DuraCloud, which is a suite of open source software for managing long-term digital preservation. Digital preservation impacts everyone. The software (and service of the same name) is used today to preserve academic, cultural heritage, and research data. DuraCloud connects curators of digital content (like librarians and archivists) to storage providers (like Amazon Web Services, the Digital Preservation Network and Chronopolis). It duplicates content across providers and performs integrity checking to verify that stored content remains unchanged and undamaged over time.\n\nWe want to make DuraCloud and digital preservation practices more accessible in general. To do so, we want to develop materials to explain why this is important, build up a community of users, empower existing users, and create ways for people to be a part of the future of DuraCloud in whatever capacity makes sense to them.\n\nWhy did you start Open Sourcing DuraCloud: Beyond the License?\n\nDuraCloud’s first major release came out in 2011. The same year we launched a DuraCloud service. The service has seen steady growth but a community to support the software never materialized. Then, in 2017, two organizations asked for assistance installing and using DuraCloud. We were thrilled! We used these new installations as catalysts in our efforts for DuraCloud community building.\n\nAlthough we have a lot of experience managing open source projects (we are involved in the Fedora, DSpace and VIVO projects) we wanted to start our community building efforts as part of the Mozilla Open Leadership Training Series. We had heard wonderful things about the training series from Kaitlin Thaney (one of our board members) and wanted to learn more about Mozilla’s community building best practices. We knew we’d learn some great tips that could be applied to DuraCloud and our other open source projects as well.\n\nWhat challenges have you faced working on this project?\n\nFinding time to dedicate to the project is always a challenge. We work for a small non-profit and are involved in many wonderful initiatives. One great thing about being involved in the 12-week training series is that there is a defined period of time to dedicate to kicking the project off right. To do so we made a time commitment and stuck to it. I think that will carry forward after the training series is complete.\n\nWhat challenges are you facing to make DuraCloud project open?\n\nThere’s an education component to digital preservation that has been a challenge for us. We know how valuable DuraCloud is for long term digital preservation but we need to get outside of our bubble and explain it to people who aren’t in our field.\n\nWhat kind of skills do I need to help you?\n\nAny and all skills! Our communities typically include librarians, archivists, and technologists but we want to underline that anyone is welcome to spend the Global Sprint with us.\n\nWe are looking for people who are new to DuraCloud from any field as well as current DuraCloud customers/users and people who are interested in Java development.\n\nAs a starting point for working together, we created Github issues describing tasks such as reviewing and improving documentation, testing DuraCloud, creating instructional videos, brainstorming new marketing ideas, and more.\n\nHow can others join your project at #mozsprint 2018?\n\nSo many ways! We created a Mozilla Global Sprint page in our DuraCloud Github repository listing all of the ways people can participate: https://github.com/duracloud/duracloud/blob/master/MOZSPRINT.md\n\n#1 If you are new to DuraCloud, you’ll want to start by checking out the README, which will give you an introduction to the project.\n\n#2 Introduce yourself, let us know who you are and how you’d like to get involved\n\n#3 Join the conversation on Gitter.\n\nWas there something in the README or about the project you didn’t understand or want to know more about? Just ask.\n\nDo you have contribution ideas you’d like to discuss with the project leads? Just mention @bbranan, @heathergreerklein, or @eeohalloran_twitter.\n\n#4 Review the issues to find a place to jump in and help. If you have questions, leave a comment on the issue or ask in Gitter.\n\n#5 Not sure where to start? Try one of these:\n\nReview the README\n\nTest the DuraCloud interface\n\n#6 Join one of our Sprint Standup calls. These will be used for status updates and to get answers to questions:"
