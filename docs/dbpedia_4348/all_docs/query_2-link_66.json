        "text": "Through its Watching newsletter, What to Watch page and many curated lists, The New York Times looks to guide readers through the chaotic world of streaming services and offer recommendations of the best films and TV shows to watch.\n\nHappy Valley\n\nWhat is it about? In the modest northern metropolis of West Yorkshire, the police sergeant Catherine Cawood finds herself pursuing cases that have ties to her own troubled past.\n\nWatch… if you like character-driven crime stories. There’s a strong procedural element to “Happy Valley,” as Catherine finds clues, asks questions and tracks her prey. But the show’s creator Sally Wainwright is just as interested in her heroine’s complicated home-life (where she lives with her emotionally unstable grandson and her ex-junkie sister), as well as the social conditions that fostered this series’ cast of drug-dealers, kidnappers, rapists and serial killers. “Happy Valley” is mostly about this community, where beautiful landscapes are marred by pockets of extreme poverty, and where everybody seems to know everybody else’s business.\n\nWatch… if you like dark British mysteries. “Broadchurch” is not reinventing the wheel — it’s still centered on a murder that takes the entirety of Season 1 to solve — but the location (gorgeous British coastline) and committed actors (David Tennant and Olivia Colman are fantastic) are what raise the bar here. The murder sets off a series of revelations that unearths deep secrets, and this layered approach gives the show more than enough plot points for viewers to enjoy.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
