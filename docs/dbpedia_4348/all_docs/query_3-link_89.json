        "text": "Not only is Lancashire the best place to live in the UK, but it is also known as home to an impressive number of celebrities.\n\nNot counting the exceptional list of reality stars and internet creators to be bred out of the red rose county, there are 10 big name celebrities who call Lancashire home.\n\nAnd what? You might think, what’s that got to do with anything?\n\nREAD MORE:Tyson Fury's dad walks out of Tommy Fury camp over wedding row\n\nLancashire’s celebrity stamps prove its a hotspot for building talent, adding to the endless list of reasons we already had proving it the best place to live in the UK.\n\nWelcome to our very comprehensive guide to the celebrities that call Lancashire home.\n\nTyson Fury\n\nSo he might be fond of a quick trip to the casino, but Tyson Fury, our Gypsy King, is the first to let the world know he calls Lancashire home.\n\nHe loves a walk down Morecambe Bay and has lived in Morecambe since 2011. His face is even seen on electrical boxes on the main roads.\n\nIf you didn’t know he lived in the area, I’d be surprised. He even loves a trip to Lancaster’s Crafty Scholar.\n\nJordan North\n\nHappy place, happy place, Turf Moor.\n\nJordan North did not only provide every single ounce of entertainment on last year’s I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here - he headed into the castle to let everyone know that Burnley, Lancashire is the place to be.\n\nSpecifically, Burnley Football Club’s home pitch, Turf Moor.\n\nSince then, Jordan North has returned to Blackpool to share his love of the Fylde Coast with his thousands of Instagram followers, showing his fellow southern radio presenters exactly what they’ve missed out on down the other end of the country: £1 burgers and world-changing piers.\n\nSir Ian McKellen\n\nThird on our native list is Sir Ian McKellen. Born in 1939 in Burnley, Ian McKellen is best known for his role as Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\nLike Gandalf once said, “it is the everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay.”\n\nThat’s why Sir Ian McKellen has a blue heritage site plaque outside the place he was born, to keep the darkness at bay.\n\nEveryone loves Ian McKellen, he’s been in everything from X-Men, Beauty and the Beast to the memorable 2019 re-make of Cats. He’s one of Lancashire’s finest.\n\nJenna Coleman\n\nJenna Coleman is best known for her role as Queen Victoria in the ITV series, Victoria. But when it comes to her regal roots, the crown falls on Blackpool.\n\nJenna Coleman was born in Blackpool in 1986 where she attended Blackpool’s Arnold School and played an active role in the regional theatre company In Yer Space.\n\nJenna’s professional career began on Emmerdale where she played Jasmine Thomas in 2005. She later joined Waterloo Road in 2009 before her big break in 2012 in Doctor Who, where she played the companion of the Eleventh Doctor Matt Smith.\n\nNick Park\n\nWallace and Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, Chicken Run. Preston’s Nick Park is the genius behind all the greatest animations you’ve seen on screen.\n\nThe Prestonian had a keen interest in drawing cartoons from a young age and went on to study at Preston’s College.\n\nPreston College even named their library the Nick Park Library Learning Centre.\n\nNick won an Oscar in 1990, and bagged his second one for his film Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit which was released in 2005.\n\nHe’s got four Academy Awards, six BAFTAs and a gold Blue Peter Badge.\n\nRanvir Singh\n\nThe Good Morning Britain host and former Strictly Come Dancing star, Ranvir Singh, is known for her down to earth moments on TV.\n\nRanvir was born in Preston and went on to study at Lancaster University.\n\nRanvir’s time on Strictly has even whirred up a dedicated following for the Preston-born presenter with fans constantly praising the presenter for her humble anecdotes and charming humour.\n\nAndrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff\n\nAndrew Flintoff, also known as Freddie Flintoff, is a TV and Radio presenter from Preston, probably more well known for his position as an international cricketer.\n\nFreddie first represented Lancashire at an under 11s level before making his way to play for Lancashire Cricket Club.\n\nHe’s known as a sporting hero but is also proud of his red rose heritage, becoming a Lancashire Ambassador in 2019.\n\nZoe Ball\n\nRadio and TV Presenter Zoe Ball hosted Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two and also greets listeners on her morning breakfast show on Radio 2.\n\nZoe was born in Blackpool in 1970, before moving to Farnham Common in Buckinghamshire.\n\nHer move out of the county doesn’t prove Lancashire isn’t the best county though - in fact, Zoe Ball sat down with the Lancashire Hotpots in 2019. Lancashire life will never escape you, even if you leave.\n\nSteve Pemberton\n\nActor Steve Pemberton is best known for his work in the League of Gentlemen. But he’s also a Chorley original.\n\nHe attended Saint Michaels Church of England High School, before going on to win a BAFTA for Inside No.9 in 2019. He's funny, he's charming, he's well acclaimed - sounds like Lancashire to me.\n\nJon Richardson\n\nWhen Jon Richardson isn't telling grumpy-toned jokes on TV, he can be found on the zipwire on Williamson Park.\n\nJon is known for his appearances on 8 Out of 10 Cats and also does 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown. He is the presenter of Jon Richardson: Ultimate Worrier and also featured with his wife in Meet the Richardsons.\n\nHe is Lancaster born and raised, having attended Ryelands Primary School and Lancaster Royal Grammar School.\n\nThis impressive list of Lancashire’s most famous shows one thing: the red rose county bleeds national, and even global, talent.\n\nVote Lancashire in the 2Chill campaign to see the county crowned as Best Place To Live in the UK.\n\nDownload the LancsLive app for free oniPhone here andAndroid here.\n\nTo keep updated, followLancsLive on Facebook and@LiveLancs on Twitter.\n\nHave you got news for us?
