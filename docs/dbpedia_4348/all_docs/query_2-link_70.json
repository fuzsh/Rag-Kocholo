The discussion went on for some time.\n\nSome time later, a newbie said \"Who do you think should play Rincewind in a Discworld movie?\". The discussions went on for some time.\n\nLater still, a different newbie said \"Who do you think should play....\" and was promptly pounced upon and beaten severly until they promised never to mention casting again.\n\nThese pages have been created in an attempt to increase the general level of happiness and understanding on a.f.p. They contain all of the suggestions for Discworld casting from the members of the alt*pratchett newsgroups (including material orginally archived by Stewart Tolhurst and Len Oil) and by direct email to esmi@lspace.org.\n\nThis page contains the main list of suggestions for casting a live action movie with the Discworld characters listed alphabetically by surname. Where suggestions have been for anything other than a real actor, these have been highlighted with *. Links have also been included to the relevant Who's Who Section for those characters that have descriptions.\n\nYou will find additional location and casting suggestions on the Discworld Locations and Extras page, suggestions for casting for an animated movie on the Voice Casting page and even a Muppet Cast List.\n\nThis page of L-Space is maintained by esmi@lspace.org and Ssirienna"
