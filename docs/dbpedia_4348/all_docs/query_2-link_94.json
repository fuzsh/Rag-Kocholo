        "text": "As mentioned previously, the ‘Kindle Monthly Sale’ has been subsumed into their generic Kindle offers, consequently there is no designated ‘Monthly’ sale as we used to know it. What we now have is a variety of different ‘offers’ bundled together.\n\nI’ve decided to still feature a monthly offers post but will try and be more selective (famous last words). I’ll continue to concentrate on more recent titles (within the last year or so), largely on the assumption that the longer a book has been around it’s more likely to have hit your radar already. Where I’ve been selective is that I’m only including my top picks rather than including ALL the books I’ve bought, read or would read. This will hopefully help to focus my mind! That said I’ll still throw in a few golden oldies that I’ve read and love. As ever, it’s a list that’s skewed towards my prevailing reading tastes so feel free to look at the complete list on Amazon here.\n\nWhat I will also do over the course of the month is post additional titles over on my Facebook page here . These will be titles which on the whole are less recent but well worth a look.\n\nGenres have been allocated by me and have been generously applied especially as some books are a mix of genres. I don’t like to pigeon hole but it helps to give the post a bit more structure.\n\n(NB As an Amazon Associate, Bookshop and Hive Affiliate I earn a small commission from qualifying purchases)\n\nIndex\n\nCrime, Thriller and Mystery\n\nFeel Good Fiction and Romance\n\nGeneral Fiction\n\nHistorical (I tend to take this as pre 1960’s ie not in my lifetime!)\n\nNon-Fiction\n\nCrime, Thriller & Mystery\n\nThe Hiding Place by Jenny Quintana\n\nSome houses have their secrets. But so do some people . . .\n\nAbandoned as a baby in the hallway of a shared house in London, Marina has never known her parents, and the circumstances of her birth still remain a mystery.\n\nNow an adult, Marina has returned to the house where it all started, determined to find out who she really is. But the walls of this house hold more than memories, and Marina’s reappearance hasn’t gone unnoticed by the other tenants.\n\nSomeone is watching Marina. Someone who knows the truth . . .\n\nHer Sister’s Child by Alison James\n\nSixteen years ago my sister died. Her baby disappeared on the same day. And I’ve never stopped searching for her…\n\nLizzy’s life was complicated and she had so many secrets. Secrets I kept for her. Maybe if I’d done things differently, she’d still be here now and the little girl she gave birth to wouldn’t have gone missing…\n\nIn all these years, I’ve never stopped looking, but I’d almost given up hope. Until now.\n\nBecause today I encountered an old school friend, Johnny, and it all came flooding back to me.\n\nThat day. The terrible discovery.\n\nAnd something he said made me realise the shocking truth: I’ve always known who took Lizzy’s baby. I just didn’t want to admit it. Because then everything that happened would be my fault…\n\nUnbound Ties by Liz Mistry\n\nWhen the past unravels, all that’s left is death.\n\nLavender’s blue, dilly dilly,\n\nWhen DI Gus McGuire is called out to the murder of a pregnant woman, the crime scene tells him that this killer is not only taunting them … he’s also just getting started.\n\nLavender’s green,\n\nWith ritualistic precision, the killer has placed a series of clues beneath the victim’s feet. Gus soon realises that these clues link back to his mother’s past as a child in foster care in Scotland.\n\nWhen I am king, dilly dilly,\n\nTroubled by his mum’s secrets, Gus is in a dark place. Side-lined from the main investigation, Gus works another murder, not realising that the two are linked and that the killer is closer than he realises … Dangerously close.\n\nYou shall be queen.\n\nThen the killer begins to target people near to Gus. Angry and determined Gus races to unravel the past and catch this sadist before the loss is too much for him to bear.\n\nAfter the Fire by Jo Spain\n\nNobody was supposed to get out alive.\n\nOn a Dublin city street, packed with afternoon shoppers, a young woman appears, naked, traumatised and bearing burn marks.\n\nTom Reynolds, now Chief Superintendent, is no longer head of the murder squad. But when it transpires the woman escaped from a house fire started deliberately and that there are more victims, Tom is sucked in. What begins as a straightforward case of arson, soon becomes something much more sinister.\n\nThe people in that house never wanted to be there in the first place. Now more of them are missing. Tom is faced with a ticking clock as he tries to locate the others and as he does, a terrifying spider’s web of domestic and international crime unfolds.\n\nAnd not everybody will survive the fall-out.\n\nCut to the Bone by Roz Watkins\n\nA beautiful young social-media star goes missing.\n\nBut who took her?\n\nWhen controversial internet celebrity Violet Armstrong vanishes in the middle of a scorching Peak District summer, the case sparks a media frenzy.\n\nThe clock is ticking for DI Meg Dalton and her team to find Violet before online threats explode into real-life violence. And then the blood and hair of a young woman are found in an empty pig trough at the local abattoir…\n\nThe more Meg finds out about this unnerving case, the more she becomes convinced that something very, very bad has happened to Violet. With temperatures rising and the press demanding answers, the case is about to take a terrifying turn…\n\nThe Missing by Daisy Pearce\n\nA missing girl. A loving mother who never gave up. A betrayed wife who doesn’t know who to trust.\n\nTeenager Edie Hudson was nobody’s little darling, which made vanishing all too easy. Two decades later, she’s been forgotten by everyone except her mother, Samantha.\n\nAnd the person who knows what happened to her.\n\nSamantha has had a long time to remember, and to regret. Having seen how little her daughter mattered to the community in the months following her disappearance, she wonders if Edie was lost before she was even gone. Or was it guilt, not indifference, that made the locals turn a blind eye? When she meets Frances, she at last starts to hope for answers.\n\nBecause Frances is obsessed with the mystery too, after finding a photo of her husband with the girl who disappeared.\n\nWhat really happened all those years ago?

But it is far more than that. In this book, social historian and TV presenter Ruth Goodman tells the story of how the development of the coal-fired domestic range fundamentally changed not just our domestic comforts, but our world.\n\nThe revolution began as far back as the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, when London began the switch from wood to coal as its domestic fuel – a full 200 years before any other city. It would be this domestic demand for more coal that would lead to the expansion of mining, engineering, construction and industry: the Domestic Revolution kick-started, pushed and fuelled the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThere were other radical shifts. Coal cooking was to change not just how we cooked but what we cooked (causing major swings in diet), how we washed (first our laundry and then our bodies) and how we decorated (spurring the wallpaper industry). It also defined the nature of women’s and men’s working lives, pushing women more firmly into the domestic sphere. It transformed our landscape and environment (by the time of Elizabeth’s death in 1603, London’s air was as polluted as that of modern Beijing). Even tea drinking can be brought back to coal in the home, with all its ramifications for the shape of the empire and modern world economics.\n\nTaken together, these shifts in our day-to-day practices started something big, something unprecedented, something that was exported across the globe and helped create the world we live in today.\n\nParallel Lives by Phyllis Rose\n\nIn every relationship there are two narratives; more often than not these narratives do not converge.\n\nThis is the basis for academic and writer Phyllis Rose’s cult classic Parallel Lives, a book that examines five literary Victorian partnerships, from Charles Dickens’s disastrous marriage to Catherine Hogarth to George Eliot’s joyful and unwed union with George Henry Lewes.\n\nIn an age where divorce was scandalous and ‘until death do us part’ was taken literally, the subjects of Rose’s book were forced to find inventive and surprising ways to coexist. As she tracks the shifting tides of power within these parallel lives in fascinating detail, Rose shows how desire, fantasy and control play out in our most intimate relationships.\n\nParallel Livesis an engrossing group biography and an essential work of feminist non-fiction that continues to resonate, compelling us to reflect on how we live now.\n\nI Love the Bones of You by Christopher Eccleston\n\nBe it as Nicky Hutchinson in Our Friends In The North, Maurice in The A Word, or his reinvention of Doctor Who, one man, in life and death, has accompanied Christopher Eccleston every step of the way – his father Ronnie. In I Love The Bones Of You, Eccleston unveils a vivid portrait of a relationship that has shaped his entire career trajectory, mirroring and defining his own highs and lows, from stage and screen triumph to breakdown, anorexia, self-doubt, and a deep belief in the basic principles of access and equality denied to generations. The actor reveals how his background in Salford, and vision of a person, like millions, denied their true potential, shaped his desire to make drama forever entwined with the marginalised, the oppressed, and the outsider.\n\nMovingly, and in scenes sadly familiar to increasing numbers, Eccleston also describes how the tightening grip of dementia on his father slowly blinded him to his son’s existence, forcing a new and final chapter in their connection, and how ‘Ronnie Ecc’ still walks alongside him today. Told with trademark honesty and openness, I Love The Bones Of Youis a celebration of those on whom the spotlight so rarely shines, as told by a man who found his voice in its glare. A love letter to one man, and a paean to many.\n\n‘My father was an “ordinary man”, which of course means he was extraordinary. I aim to capture him and his impact on my life and career.’ – Christopher Eccleston\n\nTill the Cows Come Home by Sara Cox\n\nTill the Cows Come Home is DJ and TV presenter Sara Cox’s wonderfully written, funny coming of age memoir of growing up in 1980s Lancashire.\n\nThe youngest of five siblings, Sara grew up on her father’s cattle farm surrounded by dogs, cows, horses, fields and lots of ‘cack’. The lanky kid sister – half girl, half forehead – a nuisance to the older kids, the farm was her very own dangerous adventure playground, ‘a Bolton version of Narnia’.\n\nHer writing conjures up a time of wagon rides and haymaking and agricultural shows, alongside chain smoking pensioners, cabaret nights at the Conservative club and benign parenting. Sara’s love of family, of the animals and the people around them shines through on every page. Unforgettable characters are lovingly and expertly drawn bringing to life a time and place.\n\nSara later divided her childhood days between the beloved farm and the pub she lived above with her mother, these early experiences of freedom and adventure came to be the perfect training ground for later life.\n\nThe Five : the Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper by Hallie Rubenhold\n\nPolly, Annie, Elizabeth, Catherine and Mary-Jane are famous for the same thing, though they never met. They came from Fleet Street, Knightsbridge, Wolverhampton, Sweden and Wales. They wrote ballads, ran coffee houses, lived on country estates, they breathed ink-dust from printing presses and escaped people-traffickers.\n\nWhat they had in common was the year of their murders: 1888.\n\nTheir murderer was never identified, but the name created for him by the press has become far more famous than any of these five women.\n\nNow, in this devastating narrative of five lives, historian Hallie Rubenhold finally sets the record straight, and gives these women back their stories.\n\nThe Wild Remedy by Emma Mitchell\n\nEmma Mitchell has suffered with depression – or as she calls it, ‘the grey slug’ – for twenty-five years. In 2003, she moved from the city to the edge of the Cambridgeshire Fens and began to take walks in the countryside around her new home, photographing, collecting and drawing as she went. Each walk lifted her mood, proving to be as medicinal as any talking therapy or pharmaceutical.\n\nIn Emma’s hand-illustrated diary, she takes us with her as she follows the paths and trails around her cottage and further afield, sharing her nature finds and tracking the lives of local flora and fauna over the course of a year. Reflecting on how these encounters impact her mood, Emma’s moving and candid account of her own struggles is a powerful testament to how reconnecting with nature may offer some answers to today’s mental health epidemic. While charting her own seasonal highs and lows, she also explains the science behind such changes, calling on new research into such areas as forest bathing and the ways in which our bodies and minds respond to plants and wildlife when we venture outdoors.\n\nWritten with Emma’s characteristic wit and frankness, and filled with her beautiful drawings, paintings and photography, this is a truly unique book for anyone who has ever felt drawn to nature and wondered about its influence over us.\n\nBack to Index\n\nSo that’s it for this month, hopefully enough for you to discover a new, bargain read."
