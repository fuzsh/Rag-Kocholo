        "text": "In the heart of England's vibrant cultural tapestry (and in the North West of the country, geographically speaking) lies our fine city of Manchester, a city steeped in history, innovation, and a rich artistic heritage. From the cobbled streets of the Northern Quarter to the terraces of Old Trafford, this industrial metropolis has birthed an array of luminaries who've left a lasting mark on the world.\n\nIn our exploration of \"60 Famous People From Manchester*\", we'll give our take on the 60 most famous mancunians, and we'll delve into the lives and legacies of these 60 individuals who've shaped this city's identity. We've put them in our own personal order (after much deliberation in the Manchester Shop office!) - but do you agree with our order? Probably not - so let us know in the comments!\n\nFrom the Madchester music scene to the silver screens of Hollywood, from breakthroughs in science to brushstrokes on canvas, these are the remarkable figures who we think embody the spirit of Manchester. From the south in Stockport, to the north in Nimble Nook, we’ve covered all that Greater Manchester has to offer.\n\nJoin us on this journey through the lives of those who've not only called Manchester home but have also played a pivotal role in making it the extraordinary city it is today.\n\nMany of our famous mancs are unsurprisingly musicians - check out our Manc Gifts for Music Lovers collection if you're looking for a Madchester related gift!\n\n*Quick caveat - we're including not only famous people from Manchester who were born in this great city, but also people from Greater Manchester, and those who have simply lived here but made an impact on either the city or the world as a whole.\n\n1. Noel Gallagher\n\nGo anywhere in the world, and the first things people will normally say back to you when you tell them you’ve from Manchester are “Manchester United! Oasis! Gallagher Brothers!”. Well we can’t put Utd top because it’s a football club, not a person.. So here’s our Noel at #1. Yes, Liam would likely be miffed to be #2 to his big bro, but we think Noel just pips him to 1st place.\n\nNoel Gallagher, the celebrated Oasis guitarist, was a pivotal figure in the britpop movement alongside his brother Liam. Hailing from Burnage, he spearheaded the band after honing their craft in Manchester and the North West. Gallagher's musical prowess is underscored by his writing credits for eight UK chart-toppers and a co-authored number one hit. Additionally, he's the primary or sole composer of ten UK number-one studio albums. His profound influence on British rock is acknowledged by a generation of artists who followed in his footsteps. Despite global fame, Gallagher maintains a deep affinity for Manchester, a city that played a significant role in his journey, both with Oasis and his band High Flying Birds.\n\nSpeaking to the Mancunion , he said “when I go back to Manchester, on the surface, there’s a new street here, there’s a new thing in the Northern Quarter there, but it never really changes because the people are the same.” His ties to Manchester are also strengthened through his devotion for his beloved team Manchester City.\n\n2. Liam Gallagher\n\nNot one to be overshadowed by his older songwriter brother, Liam Gallagher is one of the most recognisable figures in British rock music, noted for his distinctive vocal style and outspoken, arrogant, and volatile personality. A combination of Liam the swaggering Manc on the microphone and Noel’s guitar stylings inspired by Beatles and T. Rex, Oasis were unstoppable on their journey to the Britpop top. Liam has remained in the limelight since Oasis’ split in 2009 with his solo material, his band Beady Eye, playing at 2017 benefit concert One Love Manchester and his often bizarre tweets.\n\nLiam’s love for his birth city is still strong, also devoted to Manchester City and recently voicing the Metrolink tram voice overs as part of the Beyond the Music festival and conference in the city. His fans in Manchester have been getting excited about his tour in 2024 to celebrate the 30 year anniversary of the Oasis album Definitely Maybe.\n\n3. Tyson Fury\n\nTyson Fury, the formidable heavyweight boxer, has deep roots in Manchester. Born in Wythenshawe, Fury's connection to the city is profound. His meteoric rise in the boxing world is a testament to his skill, boasting an impressive record of 33 wins and 1 draw out of 34 fights to date. Beyond the ring, Fury wears his Manchester pride on his sleeve as an avid Manchester United supporter, aligning himself with the fervent football culture of the city. His journey began at the renowned Jimmy Egan's Boxing Academy in Wythenshawe, where he honed his formidable boxing skills. This academy not only played a pivotal role in Fury's early career but also highlights the rich sporting heritage embedded in the very fabric of Manchester.\n\n4. Ian McKellen\n\nSir Ian McKellen (or Gandalf to Tolkein lovers!) started his acting career treading the boards around the North West. Born in Burnley, lived in Wigan, schooled in Bolton, McKellen still fondly calls Manchester his home. His parents, nurturing an early love for theatre, whisked him away to a family outing at the Opera House in Manchester to witness Peter Pan when he was just three years old. This experience ignited a lasting fascination with the stage.Not one to shy away from who he is, McKellen often makes his way to Manchester for the city’s annual Pride weekend, taking part in the iconic parade through the streets of the city centre and stopping to take pictures with fellow members of the LGBTQ+ community. With the knighthood he received in 1991, and two Oscars to his name for Gods and Monsters and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Sir Ian McKellen is truly one of the North West’s finest actors and a full fledged national treasure.\n\n5. Steve Coogan\n\nA self described \"defiant northerner,\" Coogan hasn’t let his portrayal of Norwich’s finest Alan Partridge taint his Manchester roots. Born in Middleton and studying at Manchester Polytechnic School of Drama, Coogan initially started as an impressionist before developing Partridge with Armando Iannucci. Later in his career, he cemented his connection to the North when he played Factory Records boss Tony Wilson in the iconic 24 Hour Party people, about the Monchester music scene centred around the record label and the Madchester rave scene. Director of the film Michael Winterbottom (from Manchester neighbour Blackburn) continued to work with Coogan on future projects, including The Trip series with Rob Brydon and Greed.\n\n6. Gary Neville\n\nA football icon, Gary Neville has deep ties to Manchester. Born in nearby Bury, he embodies the spirit of the region. As a right-back, Neville dedicated his entire playing career to Manchester United, earning him the distinction of a one-club man. His tenure, lasting until 2011, saw him become one of the club's longest-serving players, even captaining for five years. Neville's trophy-laden career boasts an impressive 20 titles, including eight Premier League and two Champions League victories.\n\nBeyond the field, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Salford in 2014, further solidifying his connection to the city. In his post-football journey, Neville transitioned into property development in Manchester, leaving an indelible mark on the city's landscape. He's also a prominent sports pundit, based at MediaCity in Salford, contributing to the vibrant sports culture of the region.\n\n7. Mick Hucknall\n\nMick Hucknall, a true Mancunian, has deep-rooted connections with Manchester. Born in Denton, he later honed his artistic talents at Manchester Polytechnic's School of Art, residing in Hulme during his academic years. Hucknall's cultural immersion in Manchester's music scene is noteworthy. He was present at the iconic Lesser Free Trade Hall in 1976, a historic event that featured seminal acts like the Sex Pistols, Morrissey, and members of Joy Division.\n\nHucknall's ardour for football shines through his unwavering support for Manchester United. Yet, it's as the frontman of Manchester band Simply Red that he truly left his mark. Their remarkable achievements include selling over 50 million albums, with the 1991 release 'Stars' standing as one of the highest-selling albums in the United Kingdom. Hucknall's journey is intricately interwoven with Manchester's vibrant artistic and musical legacy.\n\n8. Peter Kay\n\nA beloved figure in British comedy, Peter Kay has deep ties to Manchester. Born in Farnworth, he pursued higher education at the University of Salford, cementing his connection to the city. Before his comedic career took off, Kay worked various jobs across Manchester, from a toilet roll factory to the bustling Manchester Arena.\n\nIn a poignant moment, he played a key role in the \"We Are Manchester\" benefit concert in 2017, symbolising resilience after the tragic terrorist attack. This event marked the reopening of Manchester Arena, and Kay's presence was a testament to his solidarity with the city. Additionally, Kay's stand-up comedy shows have been a recurring event in Manchester, with a staggering 40 shows scheduled in the city throughout 2023, 2024, and 2025, further demonstrating his enduring bond with the vibrant heart of Manchester.\n\n9. Emmeline Pankhurst\n\nBy Unknown author - The New York Times photo archive, via their online store, here, Public Domain, Link\n\nManchester has a lot of pride in its role in the birth of the suffragette movement, and it’s all down to Mosside’s own\n\nEmmeline Pankhurst\n\n. Her political activism and determination helped women win the right to vote, through protest and occasional extreme action. In 1903, she established the Women's Social and Political Union. It was founded at Pankhurst's home on 62 Nelson Street in the Victoria Park area of Manchester. The Grade II Victoria Villa is now home to the Pankhurst Centre who ensure the powerful story of the women who won the vote continues to inspire us all to challenge gender inequality, and to ensure that those suffering from domestic violence and abuse get the confidential help they need. Emmeline’s tenacity and perseverance is still felt today through those who use protest to stand against inequality and the freedom for all to vote regardless of gender. She truly makes us feel proud to be mancunian!\n\nLove all things Emmeline? Our Womanchester collection donates 15% of sales to the Pankhurst Trust.\n\n10. Danny Boyle\n\nYou don’t have to be a film buff to have heard of Danny Boyle’s work. Radcliffe’s own Boyle has directed films that have been nominated for 19 Academy Awards and won 8 for his 2008 rags to riches drama Slumdog Millionaire. Trainspotting, 28 Days Later, 127 Hours and all his films are critically acclaimed modern classics. Boyle’s work has moved from beyond the silver screen too, from the iconic London Olympics 2012 opening ceremony to the dance adaptation of The Matrix, titled \"Free Your Mind,\" which debuted in Manchester this year. Through this performance and events around Manchester, including frequent involvement with independent cinema HOME and delivering talks and taking part in roundtables at Manchester Metropolitan University, Boyle has solidified his connection to the North.\n\n11. Anthony Burgess\n\n“I loved the fish and chip shops – there has been nothing like them since those days – and the United Cattle Product restaurants which served tripe and cow heel. I loved Lancashire hotpot, meat and potato pie, potato cakes and Eccles cakes.” - Anthony Burgess reminisces about Manchester, ‘I Am A Mancunian’, first published in the Manchester Evening News in December 1984.\n\nBorn and raised in Manchester, the writer of dystopian masterpiece A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess's formative years in the city ignited a lifelong passion for literature, music, and learning. The tough industrial backdrop of Manchester, coupled with its independent spirit, profoundly influenced his creative journey.\n\nFrom Harpurhey to Moss Side, Burgess's family moved around Manchester, each location leaving an imprint on his artistic development. His exposure to music, from local pubs to orchestral concerts, further fuelled his creative flame. His academic path led him through Bishop Bilsborrow Memorial School and Xaverian College, and at Manchester University, he discovered his love for English Language and Literature.\n\nWhile military service took him away in 1940, Burgess's connection to Manchester endured. He returned periodically, even creating documentaries about the city. Despite the physical traces fading, plaques and murals stand as poignant reminders of the profound influence Manchester had on this literary luminary.\n\n12. Maxine Peake\n\nPeake’s connection to Manchester and the Northwest is magnetic. The Westhoughton born actress lived in London for 13 years, with it’s great connections to film and TV, perfect for her roles in dinnerladies, Silk and Little Dorrit. However, after moving back to Salford, she has been able to further her creative career and strengthen the cultural landscape of Manchester. With her regular performances during the bi-annual Manchester International Festival and multiple plays at venues throughout the city including John Rylands Library, Stoller Hall and the Royal Exchange Theatre, Peake has truly left her mark on the stage performance scene in Manchester. She is known for thinking outside the box when it comes to her acting abilities, providing vocals for Eccentronic Research Council albums and playing the title character in a radical re-imagining of Hamlet.\n\n13. Caroline Aherne\n\nShe might have been born in Ealing, but this honorary Manc moved to Wythenshawe when she was two. A character comedian, Aherne made her name around the Manchester comedy circuit before debuting the persona she’s most well known for on a Frank Sidebottom album in 1988. Mrs Merton started to make appearances across TV and radio in the Northwest, alongside other broadcasting legends like Jon Ronson and Craig Cash. She worked with Cash to create beloved british comedy The Royle Family, known for its comic portrayal of working-class family life at the turn of the millennium and it's Christmas specials.\n\n14. Victoria Wood\n\nBrought up in Bury, beloved actress Victoria Wood has spoken about the tough time she had as a child. But when she joined Rochdale Youth Theatre at the age of 15 she said \"it was like the sun came out.”\n\n\"I was in the right place and knew what I was doing. When people have despised you for having the wrong socks and name tapes on your shirt, being somewhere where your personality is of value is fantastic.\"\n\nFrom Rochdale Youth Theatre, on to dinnerladies, 62 night stand-up tours, and composing and directing her own musical for the Manchester International Festival in 2011. Since she died from cancer in 2016, several tributes have been made in her honour, including seven part TV series Let's Do It: A Tribute to Victoria Wood starring long-term collaborator Julie Walters and Richard E. Grant, and a statue of her near the library in her home town of Bury.\n\n15. Morrissey\n\nMorrissey's current relationship with Manchester is very complex, but he owes his success to the songs he wrote and the bands he saw while he grew up here. Raised in Hulme and Salford, his writing was encouraged by his librarian mother, and he would often write storylines and scripts for Coronation Street (all rejected.) History was made at Manchester’s Apollo Theatre in August 1974 at a Patti Smith gig when he briefly met a 14 year old Johnny Marr, who later turned up on his doorstep and asked if he wanted to join a band called The Smiths. Morrissey was also said to be in attendance at the infamous aforementioned Sex Pistols concert at Manchester’s Lesser Free Trade Hall in June 1976 (possibly the only time he was in the same room as Mick Hucknell?) After five years with The Smiths releasing four albums, Morrissey has released 13 solo studio albums and continues to inspire great artists and musicians, including Suede, Blur, Oasis, Jeff Buckley and Thom Yorke. Noel Gallagher called Morrissey \"the best lyricist I've ever heard\".\n\nThe Bee Gees\n\nThe Bee Gees, born on the Isle of Man to English parents, initially found their musical roots in Chorlton, Manchester. In 1955, they formed the Rattlesnakes, a skiffle/rock and roll group, marking the beginning of their extraordinary musical journey. Their pinnacle came with the acclaimed \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack, winning them five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year.

Andy Gibb\n\nAndy Gibb, the youngest of the Bee Gees, was born in Stretford in 1958. Although his early years were spent in Brisbane, his passion for music led him to tour Ibiza and the Isle of Man.

Mark Owen\n\n“Recently I’ve been back to Manchester a few times and it’s funny because there is something about the place. I don’t know whether I'm at that point of my life, but I’ve been sort of getting a calling. Manchester has been calling me. It’s strange because I never expected it.\" - Mark Owen talking to the Manchester Evening News.\n\nLife could have looked very different for Take That’s Mark Owen. Born in Oldham, he spent his youth playing for Chadderton FC and had trials for Manchester United and Rochdale FC. Luckily he auditioned for a New Kids on the Block style boy band, where he met his bandmates Gary, Howard, Jason and Robbie to form Take That. From there the band rocketed to stardom, with 28 top-40 singles, 20 top-10 and 17 top-5 singles on the UK Singles Chart, 12 of which have reached number one.\n\nDuring the band’s split from 1996-2005, Owen found time to grow a more indie-focused solo career and also won Celebrity Big Brother in 2002. 2023 has seen Mark performing and King Charles’ III coronation with the two remaining Take That members Gary and Howard, and are due to release that ninth album with a tour in 2024.\n\n21.

This monumental role not only marked a pivotal moment in Kingsley's career but also cemented his status as one of the finest actors of his generation. Beyond the glitz of Hollywood, his roots in Manchester serve as a testament to the city's rich artistic legacy, which continues to inspire and nurture talent that resonates on a global stage.\n\n22. Ian Brown\n\n“Manchester’s got everything except a beach.” — Ian Brown\n\nIan Brown's roots in Manchester run deep, not only as a lifelong supporter of Manchester United but also as a key figure in the city's musical history. Hailing from Timperley, Brown's journey began in school, where he united with future bandmates to form The Stone Roses, a pivotal group in the Madchester movement. Their music resonated far beyond Manchester, making them legendary figures in the music scene.\n\nBrown's creative journey didn't stop with The Stone Roses; he went on to craft seven solo albums, showcasing his artistic evolution. His influence transcends borders, with performances in 45 countries and even a cameo in the Harry Potter film series.\n\nIan Brown's connection to Manchester is a testament to the city's ability to nurture exceptional talent, and his impact on both the music industry and popular culture solidifies his place as a Mancunian icon.\n\n23. Ian Curtis\n\nPhoto © David Dixon Ian Curtis Mural, Port Street, Saturday, 10 October, 2020\n\nAvailable for reuse under this Creative Commons licence\n\nThe aforementioned 1976 Sex Pistols gig at Manchester’s Lesser Free Trade Hall was important for the attendance of many of Manchester’s talented musicians, but it could be argued that it was most important for the formation of Joy Division.

Within 4 years of this chat they released “Love Will Tear Us Apart,” a song which is often hailed as one the greatest indie singles ever made.\n\nCurtis’ stamp on Manchester spread all over the city - born in Stretford, lived in Chadderton, worked in Piccadilly Gardens, recorded in Stockport and died tragically in Macclesfield.

This connection runs deeper as his father, Harry McShane, actively played for the team from 1950 to 1954, creating a familial tie to the renowned football club.\n\nAlthough McShane eventually ventured to London to attend the prestigious RADA, it was in Manchester where his foundations were laid. His experiences in Stretford and later interactions with esteemed actors like John Hurt, with whom he shared a residence in London, played crucial roles in shaping his career.\n\nFrom his roguish portrayal of the antiques dealer, Lovejoy, to his iconic roles in Deadwood and American Gods, Ian McShane's illustrious career is marked by a distinctive Mancunian influence.\n\n27. Shaun Ryder\n\n“All our fans want to come and see us in Manchester, not Liverpool or London. Manchester shows are crazy, and I feel like it's not really changed. My rock and roll life has changed over the years, but Manchester is still like that, it’s like it was in the 80s and 90s.” - Shaun Ryder talking about performing in Manchester, Manchester World 2023\n\nAlthough a proud Salfordian, Shaun Ryder’s connection to Manchester is undoubtable. A leading figure in the Madchester scene with his band Happy Mondays, he, his brother and their mates created a unique blend of baggy, psychedelia and rave that made them a band like no other when they signed to the infamous Mancunian record label Factory.\n\nRyder has seen success in other non-Happy Mondays ventures, musically with his band Black Grape and a feature on Gorillaz single “Dare,” and on TV as runner up on the tenth series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! and hilarious appearances with his bandmate Bez on Celebrity Gogglebox.\n\n28. Johnny Marr\n\nResponsible for the iconic light and jangly pop riffs that contrasted Morrissey’s rich baritone that made The Smiths a legendary indie band, Johnny Marr formed The Smiths when he was 19.
