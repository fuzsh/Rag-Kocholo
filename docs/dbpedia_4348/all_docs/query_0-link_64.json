        "text": "The new Doctor Who is Broadchurch actor Jodie Whittaker, who has shaken everything up by being named the first Yorkshire incarnation of the Time Lord.\n\nWhile Lancashire has been the birthplace of three doctors (Tom Baker, Paul McGann and Christopher Eccleston), no one from God’s own county has taken on the iconic title. Enter Whittaker.\n\n“It’s more than an honour to play the Doctor. It means remembering everyone I used to be, while stepping forward to embrace everything the Doctor stands for: hope. I can’t wait,” said the actor following the announcement.\n\n‘Doctor Who represents everything that’s exciting about change’\n\nShe also insisted fans should not fear change, presumably out of worry that this may start a second War of the Roses.\n\n“Because this is a really exciting time, and Doctor Who represents everything that’s exciting about change,” she said, adding: “The fans have lived through so many changes, and this is only a new, different one, not a fearful one.”\n\nDoctor Who writer Jenny Colgan added “I can’t imagine what it’s like for Jodie: she must be so scared and excited all at once, but I couldn’t be happier, and 100% can’t wait to write for her.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mrchristr/status/886614139325566978\n\nWhittaker came to prominence in the 2006 drama Venus alongside the late Peter O’Toole.\n\nSince then she has played a variety of roles with a strong focus on complex women living on the South Coast including roles in Tess of the D’Urbervilles and Broadchurch.\n\nThe Huddersfield-born actor also happens to be the first woman to play the Doctor."
