        "meta_description": "In this chapter, Andy Spinoza describes his time at the Manchester Evening News, where he contributed to the Diary page and became its editor. This was his first taste of working for a mainstream publication, and it gave him the opportunity to meet celebrities such as Muhammad Ali, Bill Wyman and Ray Davies, as well as Coronation Street actors and professional footballers. Much of his work consisted of covering events in the evenings, from theatre opening nights to company launches and author Q and As. Over the years he witnessed a punch up involving Peter Hook, gate-crashed a celebrity party during a U-2 concert at the G-Mex and got thrown against a car bonnet by an enraged Christopher Eccleston.",
