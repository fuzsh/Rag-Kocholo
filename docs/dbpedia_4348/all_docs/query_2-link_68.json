        "text": "One of the most unique and charming characteristics of the UK has to be the sheer range of accents heard across the country.\n\nFrom Scouse to Cockney, Brummie and Manc - the UK's dialectology is vast, as are dialects within regions too. Despite this, according to a study last year, the strong Rs specific to Lancashire accents could be dying out.\n\nThe same can be said for more hyper-local dialects too, as one social media discussion has sparked. Over on the History of Blackpool Facebook page, one local has questioned whether or not Blackpool has a local accent.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nBlackpool tramway extension launch date set with free tickets up for grabs\n\nBritish Empire Medals to be handed to East Lancashire heroes in special ceremony\n\nPosted by Lucas Webster, the simple question was asked: \"Why does Blackpool not have a local accent?\" An open-ended question, but people can't seem to agree.\n\nLinda Cook says there may not be an existence of a Blackpool accent \"because very few locals live there now.\" Ian King has also suggested why this may be, saying: \"Interesting question, I've often wondered that myself.\n\n\"I think it is because over the years Blackpool was a complete melting pot. People came to Blackpool from all over, by way of example my own Blackpool ancestry is part local (really local, in the area since the 1700's), part German, part Scottish. I think the way Blackpool people talk reflects our mixed heritage.\"\n\nLynn Avis agrees with this too, commenting: \"It's funny because I always say to people if you guess where my accent is from, I'll give you a million pounds! I'm nearly 60 and nobody has ever guessed correctly so far, the closest someone got was Morecambe!\n\n\"Although it does has a northern accent, it doesn't seem pronounced enough for people to recognise it. Probably due to the fact Blackpool has always had a very transient population.\"\n\nHowever, other comments seem to think Blackpool does in fact have a distinct accent of its own. Most agree it can be seen as similar to a Mancunian accent, one of the closest major cities to Blackpool.\n\nChris McCulloch wrote: \"It definitely does. I always thought we didn't have one until I moved out of Blackpool. I'd say its more similar to the Manc accent than any other.\"\n\nRay Ward suggested: \"It does, it's a sort of \"Mid Atlantic Manc.\" You only need to go inland as far as Kirkham and the accent becomes a more familiar Lancashire one.\"\n\nAmy Groves-Gottfreund agreed: \"I’ve lived here for 20 years since I was 13 and it definitely does have an accent. I’m from Manchester and my partner sometimes sounds more Manc than me but was born and bred here.\"\n\nOthers believe the accent is strikingly similar to other dialects in Lancashire. Jimmy Gilliard commented: \"I think we definitely do, although it is fairly subtle in its difference to other accents in the Lancashire or Northern vicinity. All I can say is I can recognise a Blackpool accent when I hear it even when abroad. If unsure, if they say 'sands,' as opposed to 'beach,' you know they are probably Blackpool.\"\n\nInterestingly, Darren Cremona said the accents in Blackpool was even more hyper local than originally thought. Darren wrote: \"I think you can hear different accents from what part of Blackpool your from. Bispham people sound different from South Shore and Fleetwood accent is well different.\""
