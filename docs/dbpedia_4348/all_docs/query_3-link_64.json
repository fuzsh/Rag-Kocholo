        "text": "John Mahoney, the gravel-voiced, Tony Award-winning, British-born actor who came to embody all-American grass-roots fatherhood on the hit sitcom “Frasier,” died on Sunday in Chicago. He was 77.\n\nThe death, in a hospital, was confirmed by Paul Martino, his longtime manager, who did not specify the cause.\n\nMr. Mahoney was trained at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago and worked frequently onstage. But he was best known as Martin Crane, the blue-collar father of two painfully pretentious white-collar sons on “Frasier,” seen on NBC from 1993 to 2004."
