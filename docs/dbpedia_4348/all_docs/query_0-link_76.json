        "text": "Former Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston is being lined up to star in Thor 2.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the British actor is “in final negotiations” to play the villain in the superhero sequel. Plot details are being kept under wraps, but it is believed that Eccleston’s character would be Malekith The Accursed, a well-known supervillain in the Marvel Universe.\n\nThe original Thor film, starring Chris Hemsworth as the titular Norse warrior, opened in cinemas last May and has since grossed $450 million (£290 million) worldwide. The sequel is scheduled for release on November 8, 2013.\n\nThor director Kenneth Branagh will not return for the sequel, which will instead be helmed by Alan Taylor, who has worked on Game Of Thrones and Mad Men. Hemsworth will reprise his role from the first film, while Natalie Portman will return as Thor’s love interest, scientist Jane Foster. Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins are also contracted for the sequel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this month (July 2), Stellan Skarsgård also confirmed that he has signed for Thor 2 and revealed that he begins shooting in August (2012). However, castmate Kat Dennings – who appeared in Thor as Jane Foster’s hapless co-worker Darcy Lewis – has yet to confirm her role in the second film."
