        "text": "Christopher Eccleston saw his intelligent “alpha male” father broken by dementia.\n\nAs reported in the M.E.N he opened a new centre in his home city of Salford this week, which he hopes will by a catalyst for providing more support and hope for families touched by the disease.\n\nToday in a revealing and heart-breaking interview he tells how his father, Ronnie, threw him out a a family gathering on Christmas Day, not recognising his own son.\n\nHe also explains why Whitehall must do more to finance reserch into a heartbreaking condition.\n\nHis father died in 2012, aged 83, spending the final year of his life in a home.\n\nHe had left school at 14 and worked for 25 years as a forklift truck driver at Colgate Palmolive, in Ordsall.\n\nIt was from his father that Christopher inherited a passion for language which would eventually lead to a career as a celebrated actor.\n\n“My father, Joseph Ronald, Eccleston, Ronnie Ecc, as he was called, was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2000. Once he had been diagnosed we realised he had been exhibiting symptoms since 1997. So he lived with dementia for 15 years. My mum cared for him for 14 of those years, so I have first hand experience of family members suffering the disease. Suffering is not a word that all people with dementia like - they prefer to say they are living with it.\n\nWhat is dementia? Important questions answered by Alzheimer's Research UK\n\n“My dad’s dementia started with problems with short-term memory, He became obsessed for instance with the length of the grass at my house. He used to come and tell me that we needed to cut the hedges. He would say that again and again in a loop, and I used to snap at him because at the time I did not understand dementia. He would forget season tickets when we went to the game at Old Trafford.\n\n“My father threw me out of his home on Christmas Day, which upset my mother, Elsie, deeply. He didn’t know who I was. He felt I was on his territory. I made him paranoid. I made him afraid, so he basically got me out of the house, what I mean is, I understood I needed to leave, so he could be more comfortbale. My mum was very upset by that and I had to gently say to my mum ‘look that wasn’t my dad. My dad would never throw me out of his house, that was his condition’.\n\n“The most traumatic experience is when people with dementia realise they are ill. I saw my father pass through that and fight it with all his will. Once he was at a party, at my brother’s house, and knocked over a cup of tea. My brother said it was fine, but my father’s embarrassment and anxiety escalated to the point where he was on his knees, repeating: ‘What’s happening to me, what’s happening to me? I am Ronnie Eccleston.’ It was devastating.”\n\nDr Who actor, Christopher learned to step inside his father’s world in order to maintain a loving relationship, as ‘friend’. “If I said ‘Duncan Edwards’ to him there would be a flicker in his eye, and I would quote Shakespeare to him. My father was an intelligent man, but he had been denied an education as men of his background were made for the factory or cannon fodder. He taught himself. It was incredibly painful to see his personality dismantled. I think about him every day.\n\n“Elsie cared for Ronnie for 14 years, and she would be embarrassed, and think I was being over the top, by using a word like devoted, but she was. She married the man and felt it was her job to care for him. And I know for a fact that if the boot was on the other foot he would have done the same for Elsie. My father was very fastidious about his appearacne and personal hygiene. He lost the ability to do that for himself. So my mum did those things for him, and she was happy to do it. He was stripped of his identity,\n\n“Elsie needed support. She needed understanding. She said the saddest day of her life was not when my dad died but when she had to put him in a home. She will go with that to her grave. Salfordians are very loyal people. A part of my mum still feels that she turned her back on her husband - which she did not.\n\n“She is the most caring person on the planet, but it was an emotional, practical and physical grind, too. Carers are not recognised enough for the financial and practical support they provide. My mother did get some respite, but it’s difficult because he always wanted her and she would suffer when they were apart, wondering whether he was eating or if people were being kind to him. One day, she asked him, “Ronnie, do you know who I am?” and he said, “I don’t know, but I love you.\n\n“The government will only support the NHS with research into dementia if we apply pressure. Unfortunately we are more and more dependent on charities to fund things like this because as a nation the option that we should care for our citizens is no longer there and it should be. In 1945 we decided we would care for our citizens and that has slowly been eroded.\n\n“If you are in a caring role you need support from the government, community, and social services, and that support will only improve if things like the Salford Institute for Dementia at Salford University are publicised and spoken about. The government needs to have an iniative where carers are paid and celebrated and acknowledged.\n\n“The knowledge of carers or supporters is huge. My mother’s knowledge is enormous, so we have to access that knowledge and use it and listen. We have to listen to people living with dementia and to people who are supporting them and normalize the condition.”\n\nChristopher, 53, who was born in Langworthy and raised in Little Hulton, opened the £300,000 Salford Institute for Dementia at the University.\n\nIt aims to be an outreach centre for people to access the latest research and ideas about living well with dementia, which is set obe the 21st century’s biggest killer.\n\nIt contains a special kitchen built to demonstrate the latest dementia friendly designs, with a glass fronted fridge and cupboards as well as other design features such as colour cues to help people with dementia understand the environment.\n\nPeople with dementia and their carers can visit to take part in activities such as gardening and dance and to get guidance from others who have experienced the condition, while researchers from across the University will also be able to work there.\n\nProf Anthea Innes, Director of the Institute,said: “The new hub will put the University of Salford at the heart of the community and provide a real focal point for people living with dementia as well as their carers.\n\n“The events taking place here to mark Dementia Awareness Week will provide a great opportunity for anyone who’s been affected by dementia to find out about the work being done here in Salford, as well as across the North West and further afield, to help people living with the condition. We look forward to seeing as many members of public as possible on both days.”\n\nDr Doug Brown, Director of Research and Development at Alzheimer’s Society, said research into the disease had been “chronically underfunded”.\n\nAnalysis in 2015 revealed that for every £10 dementia cost the economy only 8p was spent on research. The equivalent spend on cancer research was £1.\n\nDr Brown said: “When it comes to dementia, the numbers and statistics can be frightening. This devastating condition is expected to affect one million of us by 2021.\n\n“It’s the only one of the top ten causes of death in the UK that we can’t prevent, cure or even slow down.\n\n“Researchers across the globe are working together to tackle the many questions that surround dementia.\n\n“One of the questions we get a lot at Alzheimer’s Society is ‘why isn’t there a cure for dementia yet?’ The answer is that dementia is a collection of dizzyingly complex conditions each with multiple potential causes, very few of which are clearly known.\n\n“Another reason for the lack of a cure is that historically, dementia research has been chronically underfunded.\n\n“The good news is that the tide is beginning to turn. The number of dementia researchers has doubled in the last six years.”\n\nThe Medical Research Council,Alzheimer’s Society and Alzheimer’s Research UK have come together to invest £250m in a new UK Dementia Research Institute.\n\nAround 850,000 people in the UK have dementia and that number is expected to reach 2m by 2051, to grow as the population ages.\n\nThere is currently no cure for any of the neurodegenerative conditions that give rise to dementia."
