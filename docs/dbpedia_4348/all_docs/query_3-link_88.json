        "text": "Plymouth is well known as Britain's Ocean City, but some might say the South West tends to get forgotten about when it comes to individuals that have pursued a career in the spotlight.\n\nBut there are in fact plenty of locals that have gone on to have extremely successful careers.\n\nFrom actors, singers, Olympians and reality stars, Plymouth is home to a number of well known faces that boast a range of fantastic achievements.\n\nHere is a list of some of the city's biggest successes, and those that make us proud to be from Plymouth.\n\nTom Daley\n\nOne the most obvious faces for the top of our list, Tom Daley is one of the most successful British divers of our time.\n\nBorn and raised in Plymouth, Tom is a 2012 Olympic bronze medalist, double World Champion and winner of the 2009 FINA World Championship at the age of just 15, also earning the same title in 2017. He also won two gold medals for England at the 2010 Commonwealth games. Most recently Tom won gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games with partner Daniel Goodfellow for the men's synchronised 10 metre-platform.\n\nTom started diving at the age of seven as a member of Plymouth Diving Club and his talent in the sport was soon recognised as he started taking part in national and international competitions from the age of just nine.\n\nTo add to his extensive list of achievements, in 2013 Tom Daley was also approached for a role in ITV celebrity diving reality show Splash, as a mentor to the celebrities taking part.\n\nCurrently, Tom Daley is married to American film director and producer Dustin Lance Black and the two live together in London. In June 2018 they announced the birth of their first child through surrogacy, Robert Ray Black-Daley.\n\nRosie Huntington-Whiteley\n\nAnother of Plymouth's most famous celebrities, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is an English model, actress, designer and businesswoman. She is best known for her supporting roles in Transformers: Dark of the Moon and Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nShe is also well known for her work for Victoria's Secret as one of their brand \"Angels\", working with large retailer Marks and Spencer, and becoming the face of Burberry's 2011 brand fragrance.\n\nRosie, 31 was born in Plymouth, growing up on a farm in Tavistock where she attended Tavistock College. She first got into modelling after undertaking a work experience placement at London based model agency Profile when she was just 15 years old.\n\nShe was signed to Victoria's Secret in early 2006 and went on to land her first solo British Vogue cover, walking runways for Givenchy, Burberry, Michael Korr's and Louis Vuitton to name a few. She landed her role in Transformers after previously working with the film's director Michael Bay on a Victoria's Secret commercial.\n\nRosie has been in a relationship with actor Jason Statham since 2010 and has been engaged since 2016. Jack Oscar Statham, the couple's child, was born in June 2017.\n\nCharlotte Holmes\n\nCharlotte Holmes was crowned Miss England back in 2012 and has gone on to become a successful English commercial model and TV Presenter.\n\nShe attended Torpoint Junior school and Devonport High School for Girls. Her modelling career also began locally when she was 19, when she won The Face of Plymouth.\n\nIn the years that followed she moved to London to pursue her career and went on to gain eighth place in the Miss World contest and placed fourth on Britain and Ireland's next Top Model back in 2010.\n\nShe is also known for her charity work, completing the London Marathon in April 2011, and raising £2,000 for children's charity Variety GB.

Although Charlie was only there for a few days, he made an impact on the villa and received lots of positive feedback from fans who thought he made his departure far too early.\n\nAn already successful model, Charlie previously lived in Plymouth before moving to London to pursue his modelling career before he was approached by the Casting Directors of Love Island.\n\nCharlie was dumped from the villa when his fellow islanders chose him and Hayley Hughes as the least compatible pair.
