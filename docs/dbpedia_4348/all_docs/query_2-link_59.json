        "text": "VOLUME ONE\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS FOR ALL 5 VOLUMES\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis book has been written to tell the story of our Utah Dalton family who traveled from far away across the sea to finally settle in the Great State of Utah.\n\nOur pedigree tells us that our first Dalton come from Normandy France and was given land for service to his King somewhere in the area of Dalton, Lancashire, England that was called ÒDale-TunÓ, or of a little town in the Òdale.Ó From that time on he was called ÒLe Sieur de Dalton.Ó Le Sieur is a French name, probably from the word Sieur, which is something like lord or ruler (from the old word seigneur, lord.) This may also mean either an occupational name for someone in the service of a great lord.\n\nThe word Le Sieur is also meant to be ÒLe Sire.Ó It is from Old French, from Latin; senior, older; Father; male ancestor; a man of rank or authority, especially Lord. Also means ÒMisterÓ- ÒdeÓ means of a place. Surnames were not used in England until around the 13th, Century. Just by the spelling and meaning of the name le Sieur, we can see he was in fact from Normandy as told.\n\nDalton family tradition tells us he may have been named Walter de DÕAliton and was with King Henry II during the invasion of England in 1154 and also with either the ÒEarl of Strongbow\" Ó or with King Henry II during the invasion of Ireland in Oct., 1171. Read the story of his reported Irish DÕAlton line in chapter two.\n\nFrom this very first ÒDaltonÓ there is evidence that most people with the Dalton surname in the world today are descendants from this first Ò DaltonÓ man.\n\nAs you read through these chapterÕs of our Dalton family lives, remember that somehow they survived many hard and troubled times and conditions ----Wars, famine, plagues, the trip to America, another war, frontier Indian battles, mob justice, crossing the plains more Indian wars and then living in the wild, wild West. You wonder how they all survived to this day, but they did!\n\nWith Photo's - Maps - Documents - Pedigree's - Histories – Stories.\n\nI am sorry to announce that we have lost 2 more Dalton family members.\n\nMy son, Scott Rodney Dalton passed away of cardiac arrest on Friday January 10th 2003 in Ogden Utah. He was only 41 years of age and left his wife, Brenda and 5 Children, ages 7 to 21. He was a very successful businessman and was an Elder in the LDS Church.\n\nI am very grateful to Scott for asking me sometime in 1998, where our Dalton family was from and if we were related to the \"Dalton Gang\" of outlaws. That question started me on my quest to find out just who our Dalton family really was. The rest is history as they say. His family, friends and I will miss him dearly.\n\nThis book is dedicated to my son, Scott Rodney Dalton, September 7 1961 - January 10 2003.\n\nOn January 29th 2005, my wife, Tracy Lindsey Dalton passed away from a long fight with brain cancer, she also being only 41 years of age. Her story is written, along with mine in volume number two of this Dalton Family history.\n\nWhy Genealogy?\n\nPart my thoughts and part of something I read at one time in the past.\n\nWhy would anyone be interested in spending so much time researching and hunting down the stories, names, and information about family members whom they never even knew?\n\nWell, maybe that is the reason I started -- I never knew them.\n\nWhen I was young, I remember being fascinated by history. All my life I have only read true life stories about people and places.\n\nI guess it also intrigues me to see how much of a trace my ancestors left behind. What kind of legacy or lasting impression did they leave behind? What did they do with their lives? Almost every time I sit down to enter a batch of newly discovered names into my computer file, I start to think about lives and how they must have lived. I can input several generations in just a matter of minutes... first name, last name, born on, married to, died on, buried at... and yet in the few seconds it takes to summarize a life in this way, I wonder, \"how much more was there to this person's life than these cold facts?\"\n\nI hope that the photos, stories, notes, names and charts I have assembled for this book will tell my descendants a little about the people who came before them. I hope this collection will be an example that will stir their hearts to do something significant with their own lives. They may not make it into the history books, but if they allow God to use their life to influence others, they will have left an indelible mark on generations to come!\n\nGenealogy is a means to retrieve the lost souls of the dead and bring them back into our memories and to set down a permanent record to show future generations how they can have a dramatic impact on families that come after they are long gone.\n\nAs a member of the L.D.S. Church it is a duty of mine to find every departed member of my family and submit their name into our Temple records.\n\nRodney Garth Dalton\n\nPREFACE\n\nLet me explain on how this Dalton Family History book is laid out. I decided that there has been not enough written about the descendent's of Le Sieur de Dalton and that I would write about my Dalton family history in chronological order; i.e. from the years of 1100 AD to 2008 and beyond.\n\nSome of our Dalton cousins here in America have wrote their own Dalton Family histories that gives some information on the earliest Dalton's from England, but most of their books deal with their own line of Dalton's that start with Thomas Dalton, our first ancestor to come to America.\n\nThe book that we in the Utah Dalton family call the ÒOur Dalton BibleÓ is, ÒThe John Dalton Book of GenealogyÓ published in 1965 and written by Mark Ardath Dalton, who was a descendant of one of the three Dalton brothers that come to Utah with the pioneers in 1848. In this book there are a few pages about the early Dalton history in England. Most of it is pedigree lines of the America Dalton's starting with Thomas Dalton.\n\nOn the next page you will find the 5 chapters in this Vol. 1 book of histories about many subjects of interest to all DaltonÕs and theyÕre extended families.\n\nWe start out with the history of the first Dalton, whom we assume was Le Sieur de Dalton, and who is said to be the founder of our English and Irish Dalton family lines.\n\nIn the first chapter, Volume 1, Le Sieur de Dalton is labeled as number 1 and highlighted in blue. His son or heir is listed as number 2 and so on down to my own family who is listed as number 30 in Volume 2, chapter number 9. I am listed as number 27.\n\nMy son Scott and Grandson Jason and his son Gage make over 900 years of Dalton history.\n\nIn each generation I have added as many histories and stories of their lives and times as I could find. I think you will find its very interesting!\n\nSome of you English readers will probably find mistakes I have made in research or quoted of your early Dalton ancestors and for that I am truly sorry. I hope in the future I can correct these mistakes.\n\nRodney Garth Dalton\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\n\nVOLUME I\n\nCHAPTER ONE – Our Dalton family in Lancashire England\n\nCHAPTER TWO – Our Dalton family in Ireland\n\nCHAPTER THREE – Our Dalton Family in Oxfordshire England\n\nCHAPTER FOUR – Our Dalton Family in South Wales\n\nCHAPTER FIVE – Thomas Dalton Comes To America From Wales\n\nVOLUME II\n\nCHAPTER SIX - John Dalton Sr. born in America\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN - The History of John Dalton’s Sons\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT - The History of the Dalton Family in Utah\n\nVOLUME III\n\nCHAPTER NINE - The Dalton family settles in Circleville Utah.\n\nCHAPTER TEN - Garth C.

Our Dalton family spent time in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nauvoo Ill. and finally went West to the Great State of Utah!\n\nOur Dalton family tradition tells us that the first Dalton man was from Normandy and maybe was with Duke William during the battle of Hastings in late 1066. On Christmas day 1066 the Duke was crowned King of England. King William I had now owned all the land in England so he allotted certain portions of it to his deserving followers as tenants. The holders of these great lands were tenants-in-chiefs or Barons and under them were their Knight's. Thus there were about five thousands Knight's at the King's call. In the year 1087 there were about two hundred thousand Normans and French in England.\n\nI believe one of these Knight's was our own le Sieur de Dalton. He would have been made a Knight and given land for his service to the Duke during the battle of Hastings. There is with the above statement a time line problem because of the dates between 1066 and the second invasion of England by the future King Henry II that our Dalton tradition tell us about. So there probable was a few more generations of Dalton's ancestors of the le Sieur de Dalton we tell you about in1154.\n\nThere also has been an ongoing debate about the origins or race of this first Dalton man. A few say he was original British, being of true Celtic nationality and the rest say he was a Norman, which is a true Viking or Northmen as they say. Remember our tradition tells us he was from Normandy. Some researchers say that the Vikings or Normans were also Celtic so the debate is without merit. Maps will show this as fact. With all my research and reading after 15 years i personally feel that our le Sieur de Dalton was Norman and he was also Celtic and did come over to England during one of the invasions as told above.\n\nThis history was compiled from many genealogical sources and histories, family records and bibles, written articles and genealogy research by Dalton Family members and other interested people. Some of this early history of our Dalton Family in Lancashire, England has been copied from a book written by Mrs. Frances Edith Dalton Leaning of England. Mrs. Leaning did extensive research on the Dalton family in England from 1935 to 1951. Her book has been distributed to many Dalton family researchers.\n\nThe Internet played a large part in this book because you can access millions of files from around the world. But you also find much inaccurate data, so please use the Internet only as a guide to your research.\n\nAlso we must give special thanks to ÒThe Dalton Genealogical SocietyÓ of England, founded by Michael Neale Dalton in November of 1970. I have a 100% DNA match with Mr. Dalton, which proves both of us are from the same Dalton line from Pembrey, Wales. Some of the history of our Dalton family would not be possible without their knowledge of early Dalton genealogy. Remember that there are many of our Utah Dalton family who are not members of the DGS and therefore have and never will read the hundreds of articles that is published in the DGS Journal twice per year. In this chapter I have quoted many Dalton informational articles that were published since about 1970. I hope Michael and the other members of the DGS will give me permission to quote from their Dalton material.\n\nAlso many thanks to our cousin, Leslie Dalton Crunk in Oregon for supplying information from her own Dalton history books and sending them to us for review. I have taken the liberty of adding some of LeslieÕs work to some of the later chapters in our Dalton history. She also helped me edit some chapters.\n\nOther major sources were:\n\nMillicent Craig, Vice President Dalton Genealogical Society.\n\nThe LDS Family History Library in Salt Lake City Utah.\n\nThe Harold B. Lee Library on the campus of Brigham Young University in Provo Utah.\n\nThe Carmarthenshire Family Historical Society of Wales.\n\nThe Pipe Rolls. Also called GREAT ROLLS OF THE EXCHEQUER.\n\nMany articles from the Dalton Genealogical Society Journal.\n\nThe ÒJohn Dalton Book of GenealogyÓ by Mark A. Dalton\n\nMrs. Edith Leanings ÒDalton BookÓ\n\n(Disclaimer)\n\nThis is addressed to any reader who is a ÒNay SayerÓ There are no endnotes in this book, only source notes that are listed where necessary.\n\nWhat I have found during my research is that the most difficult part of Genealogy is how to ÔdocumentÕ the information I found. And, even more important, was how to evaluate a particular source accuracy. Thirty years ago, it was much simpler, because most of the information you found was ÔpublishedÕ, usually in book form, and this is easy to document. In todayÕs world, with the Internet, there are genealogies all over the place and many are not documented at all. So the obvious question most people will have about my book is - Where did all the information come from? This is not easy to answer. First off, I must apologize to all the persons, living and dead, who I have shamelessly copied from, without giving the proper credit. Originally, I started by adding information from the ÒJohn Dalton Book of GenealogyÓ This is my first genealogy book, and while looking for my ancestors, I started to add other names from other sources and never stopped until I got to the end of the book.\n\nFrom this basic information, I have used every source I could find to confirm, modify, add to and refine my book. One of the first problems I found was that many sources contradicted each other. My philosophy was to compare, combine and adjust the information in each to match whatever historical documents I could find - such as Wills, birth announcements, marriage listing, and census lists. So that now, much of the information in my book comes from a combination of sources. Many details come from other genealogies that I found either on the Internet, or at Historical Societies.\n\nYou will also notice that I have done very little traditional 'source documenting' for my information. I am sure I will get my '20 lashes' from Traditional Genealogists. I would just like to take a minute to defend my actions. First, I am guilty of both being naive and of being lazy. I initially did not think of ever publishing this book, and so did not know how, nor did I attempt to educate myself on how to properly document my information. So, I initially listed sources to my original documentation. But as I learned that I should be documenting everything, I discovered that this was not necessarily of any special use to me in my work. Just because I found something in one ÔsourceÕ did not mean it was correct, nor did the ÔsourceÕ tell me where 'he' got the information from. Other historical genealogists do not list for every person, and every birth, death, marriage, maiden name, etc. where they received the information. They would just list it, and you would have to judge for yourself whether the information was accurate or not. I would like you to look at my Dalton book in the same way.\n\nWhat I have done, is when I found an original piece of documentation, such as a census listing, a marriage listing, a cemetery listing or headstone transcription, Last Will and Testament, etc., I have noted that information in my 'sources'. I will also note when I find a source that contradicts other information I have found and I will sometimes arbitrarily decide which source I will 'accept' as most accurate. For some of my entries, you will probably not see any 'sources'. This means that the information was found on someone's family genealogy, and there was no 'original source' mentioned. My assumption is that if someone took the time to publish something, or add it to their genealogy, I will accept it as truthful, until I find information to the contrary, at which time I will try to find some original sources to help me decide which information is more accurate.\n\nSo, if I have no 'end notes' that show where I got my information from, you can assume that I found it as you did, with no source or documentation, and it must be accepted or rejected by you.\n\nI do understand that this is not the correct way to write a Genealogy History book, but if I put endnotes for every item, there would be far to many pages to print this book. I wanted to put everything I could find pertaining to all Dalton families, not only of our Utah line. Some of the information was obtained after many years of searching for the Dalton name. Some was obtained by searching the LDS Family History library in SLC Utah. This means hundreds of books, film and microfilm to look at! Some information was taken from past research of other Dalton family researchers that did a lot of research before I got started. I hope the committee members of the Dalton Genealogical Society will forgive me if I have made some errors in quoting theyÕre material, but there is information in this first chapter that IÕm sure they are reading for the first time.\n\nRodney Garth Dalton - 2008.\n\nI joined the Carmarthenshire Family Historical Society of Wales in 1998 and paid to have the owners, Richard and Pauline James search for our Dalton and any related families in every record they could find. They did in fact find hundreds of records! I have these on file. If anyone needs further proof of whatÕs in this book, please feel free to call me and I will discuss it with them. There is no standard LDS style family group sheets, but there is photoÕs that is in every standard library book.\n\nThe following are sources of our pedigree used by Mrs. Leaning in her Dalton Book. The Dalton Book was written between 1935 and 1951 in two books. Book one relates to the early history of the DaltonÕs of Bispham & Thurnham Hall, of the Senior Dalton line. Book two relates to the history of the Junior Dalton line, of which our Utah Dalton family is descended.\n\nMrs. Frances Edith Dalton Leaning was an English lady related to our DaltonÕs in England who spent many years researching and writing about her Dalton line.\n\n1 - A roughly made pedigree, compiled by F.M. Deane, wife of Dr. Benjamin Neale Dalton of Norwood (1844-1914), identifies the first four ancestors beginning with Le Sieur de Dalton.\n\n2. The Norroy records, a collection of papers known as the Harleian Manuscripts, and printed by that Society in Vol. XVI, p. 85 of their publication, are used predominantly in this compilation. The Norroy publication gives few dates, but does give genealogical information of great value as to the family's descent.\n\n3. Burk's Peerage was used to confirm (or conflict) the Norroy publication in some instances.\n\n4. An early Dalton family Bible was also used as another source of the pedigree, Which is also known as ÒFBÓ\n\n5. The Victoria County History of Lancashire, or VCHL. This is the standard history of Lancashire County, in eight great volumes, with hundreds of illustrations, views, plans, and of course, coats of arms. Every statement is documented with references to the sources of information. As you read this history, bear in mind that the differences in spelling are of no consequence; the old forms of spelling were so freely changed that the same name could be spelled in several different ways by the same writer within the same paragraph.\n\nWhat are the Harleian Manuscripts or the Harleian Society Series? Briefly, they are the genealogistÕs dream world to early English families. Over 20,000 families registered their lineage from the Conquest down to the 17th century. They are a record of the \"Visitations\", the peripatetic investigation of heralds and pursuivants of English and Welsh families from about 1530 to the close of the 17th century. Also included are some Irish and Scottish families who were picked up because they had arrived and settled in England and Wales from their original domains in those countries. They are recorded in Manuscripts and their folios and are now held in the British Museum in London, England.\n\nConcerning our family's origin, VCHL. Vol. IV page 98 reads: \"The Dalton family who took their name from this township, but who are better known as the lords of Byspham in Leyland, and afterwards of Thurnham, probably held under the de HollandÕs and their successors.\"\n\nThe following items are extracted from the Domesday Book:\n\n\"In the manor of Crakehill, Dalton, Asenby, Skyeton, Bernulf had 26 carucates of land to be taxed, where they may be 15 ploughs.Ó\n\nÒThe ancient parish of St. AndrewÕs included the four constabularies or townships of Dalton-le-Dale, Morton-in-the-Whins, Cold Hesledon, Dalden (or Dawdon) and outlying farms. The largest of these and the parish seat was Dalton-le-Dale, described in c. AD 700 by the Venerable Bede as a cluster of 'ten households round the Guildhall of Witmar, Saxon and Soldier of Christ'. In 1155 the boundaries between the possessions of the Church of Dalden and those of the Lords of Dalden were decided by arbitration. St. Andrew's at Dalton-le-Dale has been tentatively dated at c.1150, but this was in the turbulent reign of King Stephen, 84 years after the Conquest, when a civil war over the throne was in progress and the Scots had taken the opportunity of English disunity to seize most of the north of England.Ó\n\nAs you can see from these items from the Domesday Book, the name of Dalton was mentioned.\n\nOrigin of the name Dalton:\n\nA Think piece from Millicent V. Craig - Vice President, Dalton Genealogical Society\n\nA \"desperate\" plea by a reader to learn the origin of the name, Dalton, led your editor to ponder the question. One popular explanation is that Dalton is Norman in origin and refers to people who lived in a high place. Often referred to, yet unconfirmed, is the village of Hauteville in Normandy as a possible site.\n\nThere are a few recorded facts or clues in the Domesday Book, assembled in 1086 by William the Conqueror. It was the first census of lands and ownership so recorded. Listed in the book are several towns by the name of Dalton and, in fact, there are up to 20 hamlets in England that bear the name, Dalton. There is one on a hill in Cumbria, Dalton-in-Furness. There are many Dalton towns or villages in what is Yorkshire today. One is named Dalton le Dale, a name that runs counter to the general hilly descriptive. There is Dalton south of Wigan in Lancashire, from whom the Bispham, Croston, Thurnham, and the Welsh Dalton's claim title.\n\nSurnames were not in use in the 11th and 12th Century and people were often identified according to the town in which they lived. For example, a name on a document might appear as Bernard de Dalton or Ethelbert de Dalton, meaning Bernard of the town of Dalton and Ethelbert of the town of Dalton. It does not necessarily follow that there was a biological relationship between the two men or that their surname was originally Dalton. Gradually the \"de\" was dropped and in succeeding centuries a name might read Bernard Dalton or Ethelbert Dalton. When one examines the ethnic disparity of the given names, one gathers the impression that the roots of these Dalton's may be quite varied. The same is true for the cluster of de Dalton's who is cited in medieval documents in what is now Yorkshire. According to our expert, Dr. Lucy J. Slater, the senior line of Dalton's was located in Yorkshire as evidenced by the unadorned crest. Lancashire Dalton's were of the cadet line and distinguished by the addition of crosslets on the crest.\n\nLucy also reminds us that on 20th of Sept 1066, King Harold of Norway landed with 9000 men on the north East Coast of England, east of York. Although many were killed or returned to Norway, it is also likely that some remained and married into the local population. But even before the NormanÕs arrived, the Romans had gone to York. A Latin dictionary shows \"De\" means of, \"Altus\" means height, \"Onus\" means single. In Latin the word, Dalton, means of a single hill and is similar to the meaning in Norman French. Roman soldiers also married into the local populations wherever they went, so there very well could have been people of Roman blood on single hills near York in these hamlets named Dalton.\n\nWhen researching the Lancashire Dalton's, whom we know most about, we find that de Dalton was in use in the 13th Century in the town of Dalton near Wigan. In addition, when examining early data in southern England, de Dalton appears and reportedly stems from late comers from Normandy. On the Scottish Island of Islay there is a Church and a Celtic cross that bears the name, Dalton. It was reportedly erected between the 11th and 13th Centuries. Buried there are 17 members of a community. Where did this group originate? Was it from across the Irish Sea? We think of the Irish Dalton's stemming from one Anglo/Norman, Walter de Aliton, although we still have no documentation of his existence. The high concentration of Dalton's in County Westmeath was certainly evidence of a Dalton founder. Yet there was another Dalton, Roger, who originated in Yorkshire and emigrated from Wales and settled in Waterford. How many more were there from other places?\n\nK. T. Mapstone has noted that the proper name, Dalatun or Dalatune has been transcribed as Dalton. Although many scholars attribute these words to the Gaelic language, she notes that is the name of a town in Iceland and of one in Norway. Viking in origin?\n\nSo how do we answer the question of the origin of the name, Dalton? There is no one answer. The best we can say is that it relates to a town or geographical area. As we continue our research we are learning that there appear to be many founding fathers in the Dalton lines and only a serious archaeological DNA study may ever produce answers.\n\nAnother source of the origin of the Dalton surname is from the following article:\n\nÒWe refer people interested in tracing ancestry of American families to a collection of ninety folio volumes of more than four hundred pages each, compiled by Col. Joseph Lemuel Chester. These volumes are extracts from parish registers. The English were so grateful to Col. Chester for his genealogical work in compiling \"The Marriage, Baptismal and Burial Registers of the Collegiate Church, or Abbey of St. Peter, Westminster\" that they made Col. Chester one of the four Americans to whom they have placed memorials in Westminster Abbey. Source unknown.\n\nThe name Dalton in the days of William the Conqueror was written D'Alton. Yorkshire fell to the lot of Count D'Alton, one of the henchmen of William the Conqueror. From this Count D'Alton the American family of Dalton in Virginia descends. This according to Dr. Robert Hunter Dalton's family record that is filed in the library of the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis. Dr. Hunter is from the early No. Carolina Dalton's.\n\nDuring one of my recent trips to the LDS Family History Library in Salt Lake City, Utah, I discovered some very early Dalton names. We canÕt as yet connect these names to Le Sieur de Dalton, but it is entirely possible that he was in England long before the date our history tells us he was. These new names could be his descendants that we donÕt know about. Further research is needed to prove a connection. These Dalton names have been added to our pedigree chart. Now that I have said this above, please note that these new names could also be just Òof Ò Dalton and not of our Dalton line.\n\nSome new names and sources found are as follows:\n\nRogero de Daltuna (The Latin spelling for Dalton)\n\nBernard de Daltona\n\nErenbald de Daltona\n\nPhillip de Dalton\n\nBenedictus de Dalton\n\nEuro de Daltona\n\nRichardus de Dalton\n\nPetrum de Dalton\n\nWillelmo de Dalton\n\nWillimus de Dalton\n\nSource:\n\nTHE LANCASHIRE PIPE ROLLS of 31 Henry 1, AD 1130 and of the reigns of Henry II, AD 1155-1189 and Richard I AD 1189-1199 and King John AD 1199-1216.\n\nAlso Early Lancashire Charters of the period from the reign of William Rufus to that of King John.\n\n\"Writ - March 20 Edward III\n\nLincoln. inq.

The first draft was completed in August 1086 and contained records for 13,418 settlements in the English counties south of the rivers Ribble and Tees (the border with Scotland at the time). It contains; general survey of the lands in the kingdom, their extent in each district, their proper tenures, value, the quantity of meadow, pasture, wood and arable land which they contained, and in some countries the number of tenants, cottages and slaves of all denominations who lived upon the land.\n\nDuring the last years of his reign, King William (the Conqueror) had his power threatened from a number of quarters. The greatest threats came from King Canute of Denmark and King Olaf of Norway. In the Eleventh Century, part of the taxes raised went into a fund called the Danegeld, which was kept to buy off marauding Danish armies.\n\nThe Domesday survey is far more than just a physical record though. It is a detailed statement of lands held by the king and by his tenants and of the resources that went with those lands. It records which manors rightfully belonged to which estates, thus ending years of confusion resulting from the gradual and sometimes violent dispossession of the Anglo-Saxons by their Norman conquerors. It was moreover a 'feudal' statement, giving the identities of the tenants-in-chief (landholders) who held their lands directly from the Crown, and of their tenants and under tenants. (Our le Sieur de Dalton was a landholder in Dalton at this time)\n\nThe fact that the scheme was executed and brought to complete fruition in two years is a tribute of the political power and formidable will of William the Conqueror.\n\nSource:\n\nThe Encyclopedia Britannia.\n\nUnder the feudal system, everyone who did not hold directly from the Crown, as most of the high nobility did, held from some member of that class. The Hollands or Holands were a great family in the Hundred. (A Hundred is a division of a county in England, originally supposedly containing a hundred families, warriors or manors.) In one MS pedigree, drawn up by an unknown hand, our pedigree is prefaced by several of the Hollands one of them, Adam, being the immediate progenitor of the first de Dalton. An Adam de Holland is often referred to in the VCHL, and there were several Roberts in the 13th, century. The Arms of Holland only varied from the Daltons by having fieurs-de-lis instead of cross-crossiets, the design and colours being the same.\n\nWhen William of Normandy became king of England, his fellow Normans became the \"nobility\" of their new land. They were the barons who were given land and in return swore to defend William's kingdom. The \"nobles\" became rich and over the years they and their kings sought more wealth in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Not as successful in these Celtic lands as they were in England, they had to settle for the East Coast of Ireland.\n\nAttire of the Nobility:\n\nBrightness of color and length of clothing was a sign of status. Velvet, silks and furs were used.\n\nMen wore: Tunics fitted close to the hips, reached the knees or ankles, secured by a belt. Silk hose. Robes of silk and fur.\n\nWomen wore: Dresses with long, trailing sleeves with gold embroidery and pearl beadwork.\n\nMantle - A loose, trailing cloak, fur lined with silk tassels. Worn with a cape.\n\nPelisse - A long, fur-edged winter garment.\n\nUnderwear - made of white linen.\n\nHeaddress -Chaplets, worn on gala days, a thin, gold wreath of floreated design or studded with pearls. Women also wore brightly-colored velvet or cloth bonnets. Some had flattened, square tops called mortiers. Braided hair intertwined with linen. During bad weather a chaperon was worn, a cape with a peaked cap.\n\nGloves - Made of chamois (soft deer leather).\n\nBelts - Leather studded with jewels. Women's belts of linen or silk. Women also wore outer girdles embedded with agates or sapphires.\n\nOuter girdles -embedded with agates or sapphires.\n\nPurse - Made of silk, held by silver chain at belt.\n\nShoes - leather or cloth, could be plated with gold or studded with jewels.\n\nAlso - Rings, jewels, brooches, gold pins, necklets, buckles and women wore mascara.\n\nThe Diet of the Rich:\n\nBest food eaten, but the meats and desserts negated the nutrition of the vegetables. Drank wine, strawberry, raspberry mulberry drinks, and verjuice and honey. Verjuice was the sour juice of apples or grapes. Desserts included gillyflower comfits, pudding, apple and quince tarts and marmalade. Ate fish, fowl, and meats from their livestock and the game animals that were forbidden to the peasants.\n\nChildren of the Nobility:\n\nSons would stay at home until they were 8 years old. They would then become the Page of a knight or another nobleman. At age 16 they would become a squire, and a knight at age 20. Boys age 7 or 8 learn fencing with wooden and blunted swords. Age 10 learn how to ride a horse, use hawks, train dogs and go into the forests to develop resourcefulness, sense of direction and woodcraft. Learn how to read and write. Play chess, checkers and backgammon. Play harp and sing. Shoot with arbalist (crossbow), fence, use lance and shield. The squire kept his lord's sword, lance and shield. He would be given weapons and a coat of mail and learn to joust. He would rise at dawn to curry his master's horse. Then to castle to help his master wash and dress. He would wait on his lord and lady at table and carry his lord's banner when out riding. The squire was also responsible for the guests, and had to learn courtesy. He was also a messenger, and carried a purse and keys for his lord's coffers and also accompanied the seneschal on his last rounds and slept at his master's door. His jousting skills were developed by practicing with the ring and quintain, putting lance through ring while riding, and striking quintain with lance. The quintain was a post with two revolving arm, one which held a club. If the lance missed the post and struck the arm, the other arm would swing around and hit the rider. Girls would learn how to read and write, do arithmetic, astronomy and medicine.\n\nSource:\n\nThe Encyclopedia Britannia.\n\n**************************************************\n\nThere are three places I found where the name of ÒLe Sieur de DaltonÓ is listed.\n\nThe first is in the notes of John Luther Dalton who started his genealogy research during his L.D.S. Church mission from 1863 to 1866.\n\n(Read John LutherÕs history in chapter 6)\n\nThe second is from ÒThe John Dalton Book of GenealogyÓ by Mark Ardath Dalton.\n\nThe third place in from the ÒDalton BookÓ by Mrs. Frances Edith Leaning (Dalton).\n\nThe below is copied word for word from page 25, Chapter 9 ÒThe John Dalton Book of GenealogyÓ.\n\nPedigree of the Dalton Family as compiled by JOHN LUTHER DALTON:\n\nA copy was obtained from Voyla Dalton Smith, the daughter of John Luther Dalton and a copy of the Dalton pedigree chart sent to Sarah Cedenia Dalton of Parowan, Utah, by John Luther Dalton.\n\nIn a letter sent to me, dated March 19, 1960, Mrs. Voyla Dalton Smith has this to say: \"Father left on a mission to England the 28th of April 1863 and returned 1866. He also made a subsequent trip to England for genealogical research in 1888 and compiled his findings in 1889. Father never put down the source of his information as I have indicated but Mother said that he searched histories, deeds, wills, cemetery records and etc.\"\n\nListed below are only the first 2 names that is quoted from pages 231 & 232 of the ÒJohn Dalton bookÓ\n\n-- 1 --\n\nLe Sieur or Sire de Dalton came from Normandy, France, in 1153 AD with King Henry II of England.\n\nThe eldest son John was granted on the death of his father, the Manors of Dalton and Byspham in Lancashire, England. He executed a deed in favor of his eldest son John 1193 AD. He had two sons. (We have since learned that Le Sieur de Dalton had a third son, Phillip, who went to Ireland with his father. Remember all this must be proven by records as we search for the true Descendants of Le Sieur de Dalton.)\n\n-- 2 --\n\nJohn Dalton or Doldon was given a deed 1193 AD Lancashire, England. Simon de Dalton was mentioned in a deed 1190 AD Lancashire, EnglandÓ\n\nJohn Luther Dalton at the age of 19 was called on a mission to England by President Brigham Young, departing the 28 April 1863. While in England he did an extensive amount of research work in the fields of genealogy. He also met the girl that was to become his wife, Elizabeth Mary Studer. She with her family emigrated to America and Utah in early September 1866, and they were married on the 21st of September 1866.\n\nIn 1888 he made another trip to England, this time for himself. The Dalton families are indebted to him and the efforts he put forth, leaving no stone unturned to gather data as far back as could be found on the Dalton progenitors. He found that Le Sieur Dalton had two sons, John and Simon de Dalton, and came from Normandy about 1153 A.D. at the time of King Henry II. (Note: We have since have found a third son, Phillip, who went to Ireland with his father)\n\nSo according to John Luther Dalton, the first Dalton that he found was Le Sieur de Dalton who came from Normandy, France, in 1135 with King Henry II. But how can this date be true. Henry II would only be about 2 years old in 1135 if he were born in 1133. (See below) I believe John Luther got the date wrong, it should be 1153.\n\nHenry Plantagenet, King Henry II, King of England, was born March 25 1133, in Le Mans, France and died July 6 1189 in Chinon, England. He is buried at Fontevrand Abbey.\n\nSo this date of 1135 is wrong. The probable date is closer to 1153, which would make King Henry II, 21 years old.\n\nNote: Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England on December 19th 1154 at Westminster Abbey, Middlesex, London, England. Henry was raised in the French province of Anjou and first visited England in 1142 to defend his mother's claim to the disputed throne of Stephen. His continental possessions were already vast before his coronation: He acquired Normandy and Anjou upon the death of his father in September 1151, and his French holdings more than doubled with his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitane (ex-wife of King Louis VII of France). In accordance with the Treaty of Wallingford, a succession agreement signed by Stephen and Matilda in 1153, Henry was crowned in December 1154. The continental empire ruled by Henry and his sons included the French counties of Brittany, Maine, Poitou, Touraine, Gascony, Anjou, Aquitane, and Normandy. Henry was technically a feudal vassal of the king of France but, in reality, owned more territory and was more powerful than his French lord. Although King John (Henry's son) lost most of the English holdings in France, English kings laid claim to the French throne until the fifteenth century. Henry also extended his territory in the British Isles in two significant ways. First, he retrieved Cumbria and Northumbria form Malcom IV of Scotland and settled the Anglo-Scot border in the North. Secondly, although his success with Welsh campaigns was limited, Henry invaded Ireland and secured a English presence on the island.\n\nThe period following the death of Henry I in 1135 and the rule of Henry II were some what chaotic in England, dominated by the struggle between King Stephen and his cousin, the Empress Matilda, who was the daughter of Henry I and the mother of Henry II. Local nobility used the conflict to usurp power in many areas, an especial practice being that of castle building.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Encyclopedia Britannia: Medieval Sourcebook.\n\nThe below copied word for word from page 7, Book 1, of the Dalton Book by Mrs. Leaning:\n\nÒAlthough FlowerÕs pedigree begins with a Sir Rychard, a roughly made MS. Pedigree, coming into my hands long after this book was begun, shows apparent four generations preceding him. The first is ÒLe Sieur de Dalton Òwho came with King Henry II, 1153, whose son was Dalton of Byspham, who had a son John Dalton, father of Sir Richard, a Crusader in 1187 who killed a Saracen in the Holy Land and from that the family takes a green griffin in its crest, buried at Dalton. This is interesting, but without assigned evidence or source must be regarded as legendaryÓ\n\nSo the way I see it is that we descendants of the first Dalton must have a starting place to begin. Here is my interruption of the history of the descendants of this first Dalton.\n\nWe believe the first of our Dalton line is a Le Sieur de Dalton from what we think is the ancestral home of our Dalton family in Hauteville-Sur-Mer, Normandy, France.\n\nThe article below was copied from the Dalton Genealogical Society Journal:\n\nSource: HAUTEVILLE-THE ANCESTRAL TOWN OF THE DALTONS, By Miss P.N. Simpson\n\nThe DGSJ, Vol. 3, 1972.\n\nDuring the summer of 1971, Philippa Simpson visited France with her family for a holiday and had the opportunity of investigating the town of Hauteville in Normandy, from where it is thought that Le Sieur de Dalton came. This is her report.\n\nÒThere is very little information available about the early Dalton's. This means that what follows is based more on clues than on facts, in conjunction with a visit to two places in Normandy with the name of Hauteville. However, in spite of the lack of any very positive conclusions, I hope that it will be of interest to readers and possibly provoke further comments of investigations on the subject.\n\nLe Sieur de Dalton, who was probably the great grandfather of Sir Rychard Dalton of Byspham and came over to England from Normandy with King Henry II in 1153. I am unable to ascertain whereabouts he decided to settle, but his son was said to have been possessed of the Manors of Dalton and Byspham in Lancashire; so he might have decided to settle in one of these places. I think that the Manor of Dalton is around the village of Dalton in the South part of the County of Westmoreland. Several places around there have the name of Dalton, such as Dalton Crags, Dalton Hall and Dalton Park Woods.\n\nLe Sieur de Dalton was said to have come from a area called Hauteville in Normandy. I do not know if he was an important person in Hauteville for Sieur is merely the French word for Mister. It is interesting to note that the Kings of Jerusalem were said to have been of the House of Hauteville so the DaltonÕs could have married into their family.\n\nBoth of the Hautervilles, which I visited, were on the Cherbourg peninsular. Hauteville sur la Mer was on the West Coast and the other Hauteville was approximately in the centre.\n\nNearby there is a ruined castle which I am sure was standing in the 12th Century. Perhaps the DaltonÕs, if they were near neighbors, went visiting there or possibly they even married into the family that lived there.\n\nThe other Hauteville is also old, but it is impossible to tell whether it was there in the 12th Century. Unlike Hauteville sur la Mer it is difficult to reach. We got lost on many tiny country roads trying to find it.\n\nComparing the Hautevilles to places like Thurnham and Cockersand Abbey which I have also visited, I would like to think that our ancestors came from Hauteville sur la Mer. Both Hauteville sur la Mer and Thurnham are about a mile or two inland from the sea. Both are fairly accessible and they are both built on flat ground. The other Hauteville is quieter and more remote.\n\nThe largest mystery which remains for me is why Le Sieur de Dalton decided to come to England as I think that Normandy has more to offer than Lancashire, both in scenery and climate.\n\nSir Rychard Dalton, or de Dalton is supposedly the first Dalton that is at the head of the Flower's Visitation Pedigree which is generally taken as the starting point of the Dalton family history (see chart on page 7 of Volume 1 of the D. G. S. Journal). However there appear several variations in the details of this early part of the pedigree and different sources of information indicate differing numbers of generations between Le Sieur de Dalton and Sir Rychard of Byspham. One thing is reasonably certain though and that is that we are descended from a Dalton who accompanied King Henry II across the English Channel in 1154.\n\nIt is interesting to recall the circumstances of this channel crossing. Settling on the English throne at the time was Stephen, an unpopular king who had banished Matilda, daughter of Henry I and mother of Henry II, from the land. Henry, ruler of Normandy, Anjou and Maine, Guienne and Poitou, had decided to invade England.\n\nAn expedition to England undertaken by Henry in 1153 resulted in signing the treaty of Winchester (6 Nov 1153). Stephen retained the kingship for his lifetime and Henry was acknowledged as heir to Stephen by a charter issued at Westminster on 25 Dec 1153.\n\nThe outcome was a compromise with the agreement that Stephen should rule England until his death whereupon Henry would succeed to the crown. In the event, Stephen died the following year and so Henry began his reign as the first of the House of Plantagenet in 1154.\n\nOne wonders exactly what role Le Sieur de Dalton might have played in all this. One can only conjecture, but he presumably fought for Henry and perhaps he, along with many others, was granted lands in Lancashire as a reward for his part in successfully putting Henry on the throne. It seems a fitting start to our family history but unfortunately it can never be more than a speculation.Ó\n\nSource: Philippa Simpson -1971.\n\nSo as we read in the about the story by Philippa, I also believe that Le Sieur de Dalton did come into England about December of 1154 from Normandy in the service of the Henry, future King of England. Was Le Sieur de Dalton in service to the King, or a soldier who fought along side him? Whatever his position was, some how he obtained lands in Lancashire, probably because of his service to King Henry. Did Le Sieur de Dalton give his name to the land or manor he lived in, or did his name come from the area he settled on? We will never know for sure, but we do know that he was the start of our great line of DaltonÕs as far as can be traced.\n\nDalton Township, Lancashire, England:\n\nSource:\n\nVictoria County History Publication: A History of the County of Lancashire: Volume 4.\n\nDALTON MANOR, DALTON\n\nDaltone, Dom. Bk.; Dalton, 1212.\n\nDalton occupies hilly ground south of the River Douglas. The highest point is Ashhurst Beacon, known locally as the 'Beetle,' 569 ft. above sea level. From it the land slopes away gradually on every side. The district is extensively cultivated, fields of corn, potatoes, and other root-crops alternating with pastures. Plantations of trees appear more especially on the north-east under the lee of the hill and away from the assault of westerly sea winds. A few insignificant brooks find their way towards the Douglas, which forms the northern boundary of the township and divides the Hundred of West Derby from that of Leyland. The view from the top of the hill near the Beacon is an extensive one, affording a fine panorama of the surrounding country. The preponderance of holly trees and hedges on the sheltered side of the district is a noticeable feature. There are many picturesque stone-built houses in the neighborhood. The soil appears to be loam and clay, over solid sandstone rock. The area is 2,103½ acres. The population in 1901 was 422.\n\nThe road from Upholland to Newburgh crosses the township in a north-west direction, ascending and descending; Ashhurst Hall and the church lie on the western slope of the ridge; to the north are Hawksclough and Dalton Lees, and to the south lies Elmer's Green. Prior's Wood is in the north, and Cassicarr Wood on the eastern boundary.\n\nThere is a colliery. The township is governed by a parish council.\n\nAshhurst Beacon was erected a century ago, when a French invasion was regarded as imminent. Watchers were stationed day and night to be ready to light the beacon fire, and thus give notice of the enemy's landing.\n\nDALTON MANOR:\n\nAt the death of Edward the Confessor, DALTON was held by Uctred as one plough-land; its value was the normal 32d. On the formation of the Manchester fee Dalton was included in it, and probably about 1150 Albert Grelley the elder enfeoffed Orm son of Ailward, of Kirkby Ireleth, of a knight's fee in Dalton, Parbold, and Wrightington, in marriage with his daughter Emma. The heirs of Orm held it in 1212. Dalton was reputed part of the Manchester fee down to the 17th century.\n\nThe descent of the mesne lordship it is not possible to trace clearly. The descendants of Orm were the Kirkbys of Kirkby Ireleth, who long retained an interest in part of the fee of Dalton, Parbold, and Wrightington. Dalton and Parbold as half a knight's fee seem very early to have been granted to the Lathom family, and Parbold and part at least of Dalton were in turn granted to younger sons. In the 13th century Dalton was held by Richard de Orrell, Richard le Waleys of Aughton, and Henry de Torbock, but how their interests had arisen there is nothing to show, though the Torbocks no doubt held their quarter of the manor by a grant from the Lathoms.\n\nThe Orrell portion, called a fourth part of the manor, was like Orrell itself acquired by the Holland family, (and descended in the same way to the Lovels, and, on forfeiture, to the Earls of Derby. The latter sold it about 1600 to the Orrells of Turton, who soon afterwards sold all their rights to the Ashhursts.\n\nThe Dalton family, who took their name from this township, but who are better known as lords of Bispham in Leyland and afterwards of Thurnham, probably held under the Hollands and their successors.\n\nThe Waleys portion was divided, half being given to a younger branch of the family. Richard le Waleys had a brother Randle, whose son Richerit was a benefactor of Cockersand Abbey. Adam the son of Richerit sold his quarter share to Robert, lord of Lathom, who granted it to the priory of Burscough.\n\nThe priory continued to hold this quarter of the manor to the Suppression, after which its fate has not been ascertained; but all or most was probably acquired by the Earls of Derby, and remained with this family till the sale of Lady Ashburnham's estates.\n\nThe fourth part retained by the Waleys family descended like Uplitherland to the Bradshaghs, (and was sold in 1546 to Matthew Clifton, and then apparently to the Ashhursts, who before that seem to have been the tenants under Waleys and Bradshagh.\n\nThe remaining quarter, that of the Torbocks, descended for some time with the principal manor of Tarbock; but this portion of Dalton became, like Turton, the share of the Orrell family. The estate was often called the manor of Walton Lees. A family named Lascelles, of long continuance in this township and Upholland, appear to have been the immediate holders.\n\nIn 1598 William Orrell of Turton was called lord of 'three-fourths' of the manor, holding his hereditary share and that of the Holland family; and William Ashhurst lord of 'one-fourth,' i.e. probably the Waleys share. (fn. 21) The Burscough quarter does not seem to be accounted for. Shortly afterwards, as stated above, the Ashhursts acquired the Orrells' lands and rights, and became sole lords of the manor. In 1751 they sold it to Sir Thomas Bootle, and it has since descended with Lathom, the Earl of Lathom being lord of the manor.\n\nIn the absence of records it is not possible to give a satisfactory account of the Ashhurst family. The earliest known is Simon de Ashhurst, who about the end of the reign of Henry III granted to his son Robert all his land in Dalton, and to his son John all his land in Ashhurst. ( Robert son of Simon next occurs; and in 1300 Richard son of Robert de Ashhurst made a release of lands in Pemberton. This Richard acquired lands about the same time from Henry the Miller of Skelmersdale, whose daughter Alice afterwards released her right in the same. Richard's son Adam was the most distinguished member of the family until the Commonwealth period. He fought in the French wars under Edward III and was knighted, receiving also a grant of lands in Essex and Hertfordshire. He was succeeded by his son John, who married Margery, daughter of Henry de Orrell, and had a son Roger. This Roger about 1385 married Maud, daughter of Henry de Ince, leaving a son Robert, whose son John de Ashhurst about 1437 married a daughter of Roger de Dalton. From this date there is an absence of documentary evidence until the middle of the 16th century, about which time, as already stated, William Ashhurst acquired, probably from the Bradshaghs of Aughton, a quarter of the manor, and afterwards acquired the remainder from William Orrell.\n\nThis William Ashhurst was in 1590 reported to be 'soundly affected in religion'; and the family continued Protestant, adopting Puritan and Presbyterian tenets. William Ashhurst died in 1618, and was succeeded by his son Henry, who married Cassandra Bradshaw, and had several children, including Henry, the draper and alderman of London, a wealthy man and a consistent Puritan. The eldest son William was a member of the Long Parliament, and also of Cromwell's Parliament of 1654. He died in January 1656–7, and was succeeded by his eldest son and heir Thomas, who recorded a pedigree in 1664. John Ashhurst, the brother of William and Henry, took an active part in the Civil War on the Parliamentary side, having a commission as captain and major. He engaged in the second siege of Lathom, and was present at the surrender in December 1645; he was subsequently governor of Liverpool.\n\nThomas Ashhurst, aged twenty-five in 1664 was succeeded in 1700 by his son Thomas Henry, who made a settlement of the manor of Dalton in 1706, and about thirty years later succeeded also to the manor of Waterstock in Oxfordshire, which had been bought by the above-named Alderman Henry Ashhurst. In 1751 the manors of Dalton, Upholland, and Skelmersdale, with various lands, were sold to Sir Thomas Bootle by Henry Ashhurst, son of Thomas Henry, and apparently an elder brother of Sir William Henry Ashhurst, the judge.\n\nFamilies named Arrowsmith, Prescott, and Holland also held lands in Dalton. In 1600 William Ashhurst and William Moss were the only freeholders recorded.\n\nAbout 1400, 2 acres of land in Dalton, granted without royal license for the repair of Douglas Bridge, were confiscated, but restored.\n\nFor the adherents of the Established Church John Prescott of the Grange, owner of the great tithes of the township, turned the tithe barn into a place of worship; a district was assigned to it in 1870, and it was consecrated in 1872; but five years later the present church of St. Michael and All Angels was built on an adjoining site, and the old one destroyed. The patronage is in the hands of Mrs. Prescott.\n\nFootnotes:\n\nRobert de Dalton is mentioned as early as 1293; Inq. and Extents, 276. In 1305 Robert de Dalton was claiming common of pasture from Ellen, widow of Henry de Lathom, and from the Prior of Burscough; De Banco R. 154, m. 252 d.; 156, m. 119. There was another family bearing the local name, who held of the Torbocks; thus Gilbert son of Alan de Dalton speaks of 'my lord, Henry de Torbock'; Kuerden MSS. iii, T, 2, no. 15. Robert de Dalton allowed the Prior of Burscough to approve in the hey of Dalton; Burscough Reg., fol. 34b.\n\nThe most conspicuous of the early members of the family was Sir John de Dalton, kt., whose exploit in carrying off Margery de la Beche in 1347 has been mentioned in the account of Upholland. Robert de Dalton, his father, was then living. Sir John died in 1369 holding 40 acres in Dalton of Roger La Warr, lord of Manchester, in socage, by the rent of 9d. yearly; Inq. p.m. 43 Edw.

There is a tradition that he went from England to France as an emissary of King Stephen to arrange Henry II return to England on StephenÕs deathÓ.\n\nA little Norman History:\n\nIf the legend of Le Sire de Dalton is true and he was from Normandy as his history tells us, then below is a little history of his people. It may be true that he had Viking ancestry!\n\nThe NormanÕs were primarily of Viking origin, descended from Duke Rollo and his Viking pirates. Duke Rollo was at one time Jarl or Earl of Orkney and after being kicked out of northern Norway by the King, landed in northern France and claimed a chunk.\n\nThe NormanÕs of mainland France cast their beady eyes on the English island paradise so full of promise, an island base often envied and sullied by the Vikings. The islands to the north of England were devastated by the invading ripples of Danish and Norwegian Vikings who now held much of the land -- the Orkneys, Hebrides and the Isle of Man. Weak Saxon Kings found it more convenient to pay bounties and to demand hostages from the Viking marauders, buying short lived peace for the islands.\n\nKing Cnut had Denmark and Norway to look after, and the Swedes were pounding on his back door. He was smart and left government in England to the Saxon Witan -- the ruling body suitably seeded with Danish Earls from the north. He milked the Saxons with kindness, and left them and the Witan, to their own devices, but very poor. Not wanting a direct confrontation with Cnut, a fellow Viking, the Normans bided their time, and infiltrated with friendly implants. They set the table for the Norman invasion of England.\n\nUnlike the previous Viking bounty hungry marauders who flitted around the oceans with fleets of up to one hundred ships, stinging here, ravaging there, wintering, gathering treasures which would help them gain power in their home domains, the Normans had achieved a new territory and converted the Vikings who had firmly planted their roots in northern France. They became skilled military commanders who did not confine themselves to naval warfare and allied strategies, although these basic skills never left them. They developed a hierarchical network of top down intermarriage, betrothals and cross-pollination that always seemed to work to their advantage.\n\nWhen King Malcolm Canmore of Scotland finally declared himself to be Duke William the Conqueror's man in 1072 (after the Duke had ravaged as far north as the Forth) the Norman Empire would stretch from the Orkneys to the tip of Sicily and later to Greece and Jerusalem. By 1072 they'd also beaten up the Frisians, the Germans (Emperor Otto of Germany was a nephew of the Norman King John in 1215) and even their friends and kin the Flemings. 1172 saw the same Norman conquest and ownership of Ireland when Strongbow, the Earl of Pemroke engineered the occupation of Leinster for Henry II. The seeding of lowland Scotland followed the same pre-Conquest Norman pattern.\n\nSource: History copied from the internet. (ItÕs also in most Norman History books)\n\nA connection between the de Lacy Families and our Dalton Family?\n\nBoth Walter de Laci and Ilbert de Laci came from Normandy with William the Conqueror In 1066.\n\nWALTER AND ILBERT DE LACY\n\nThe Conqueror and His Companions\n\nby J.R. Planch, Somerset Herald. London: Tinsley Brothers, 1874.\n\nLacie, now called Lassy, the place from which this great Norman family derived its name, is on the road from Vere to Auvray. Of its earlier lords we know nothing, and Wace's \"Cil de Lacie\" and \"Le Chevalier de Lacie,\" do not enlighten us. Neither do we receive much assistance from his French or English annotators, who refer us to Dugdale and the English genealogists.\n\nFrom them we learn that a Walter and an Ilbert de Lacy were certainly present at Senlac, though how related to each other they have no evidence, nor can we venture to suggest which was the \"Sire de Lacie\" of the poet, and which \"the Chevalier,\" if we are to consider them two distinct personages. That they were brothers, however, is fairly presumable, from the fact that the mother of Ilbert de Lacy, Emma, is named in a charter, and Walter had a daughter Emma, named according to custom after her grandmother. No particular deed of arms is attributed to either; but the Sire de Lacie is named as one of a party of seven or eight knights who charged the English in company, \"fearing neither prince nor pope. Many a man did they overthrow, many did they wound, and many a good horse did they kill.\" As early as the third year of William's reign, 1069, Walter de Lacy was sent into Wales with William Fitz Osbern and other tried soldiers, against the people of Brecknock, led by their Prince of Wales, Rhys ap Owen, Cadogan ap Blethyn, and Meredith ap Owen, whom they attacked and defeated with great slaughter.\n\nSubsequently he assisted Wulstan, Bishop of Worcester, and Urso d'Abitot, then sheriff of that county, in preventing the passing of the Severn by the Earls of Hereford and Norfolk, with the object of effecting a junction of their forces.\n\nHis death, however, was not on the field of battle, nor was he shorn a monk in some abbey according to a prevalent custom of the period.\n\nHaving founded the Church of St. Peter at Hereford, and taking much interest in the building, when the work was nearly finished, he mounted a ladder to inspect some portion of it, when his foot slipping, he fell and was killed on the spot (6 kalends of April, 1084).\n\nHe was buried in the chapter house of the Cathedral at Gloucester, to which Emmeline, his wife, for the health of his soul, gave five hides of land at Duntesborne.\n\nBy this lady, whoever she was, he left three sons, Roger, Hugh and Walter, the last a monk in the Abbey of St. Peter at Gloucester; and two daughters, Ermeline and Emma.\n\nDying before the compilation of Domesday, we cannot be certain what was his reward in lands and honours for the services he had rendered his sovereign; but in that precious record we find his son and successor, Roger, in possession of ninety-six lordships, sixty-five of which were in Gloucestershire, besides four carucates of land lying within the limits of the Castle of Civia, which King William had bestowed on his father. Conspiring, however, against William Rufus, first with Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and afterwards witli Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, he was banished the realm and all his lands given to his brother Hugh, the founder of Llanthony Priory, who, dying without issue, left his great inheritance between his two sisters above named. Ermeline had no children; but Emma, [An Emma de Lacie, probably the aunt of this Emma, took the veil in the Convent of St. Amand de Rouen before 1069.] by a husband unnamed, had issue, a son, Gilbert, who assumed the name of Lacy and became the ancestor of the great lord of Ulster and conqueror of the largest part of Ireland.\n\nILBERT DE LACY\n\nThe other companion of the Conqueror received for his services at Senlac, the castle and town of Pontefract and all that part of the county of Lancaster then as now called Blackburnshire, with other lands of vast extent, so that at the time of the general survey he possessed one hundred and seventy lordships, the greater portion of them in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and Lincolnshire, and obtained from King William Rufus a confirmation of all those customs belonging to his Castle at Pontefract, which he had enjoyed in the time of King William his father.\n\nBy his wife, a lady named Hawise, he left two sons, Robert and Hugh, the former of whom completed the building of the Abbey of St. Oswald at Nostell, the foundation of which was commenced by his father, and amply endowed it.\n\nThis true line of Lacy terminated with the grandson of the above Robert, and the Constables of Chester and the Earls of Lincoln, who assumed the name, inherited the lands and honours, but not a drop of the Lacy blood, as it would be inferred from the polite peerages in which the reader would naturally look for information. As frequently we find it to be the case, they need not the flattering unction applied to them, being descended from equally ancient and valiant progenitors, the families of the De Lizures and the Fitz Nigels, barons of Halton, united in the persons of Richard Fitz Eustace, Constable of Chester, in right of his mother Agnes, the first wife of Henry de Lacy, by her former husband, Eustace Fitz John, and of Albreda, daughter of Robert de Lizures, by the second wife and widow of the said Henry.\n\nIlbert was given the task by \"William the Bastard\" of quelling the Anglian insurrection in the district during \"The Harrying of the North\". At this time English nobles were disposessed of their lands and titles, de Laci, Warrene, Marmions [Stansfield] and others were given the spoils.\n\nPontefract Castle -\"The key to the North\" originally called Kirkby by the Danish invaders but later the town had a name change under the Normans to Pomfret or \"Broken Bridge\". From Pontefract was administered the vast Duchy of Lancaster.\n\nThe Pontefract lands held by the de Lacis were purposely interwoven with the lands granted to the Warrenes of Wakefield Manor by William I. Both de Laci and Warrene were present at the Battle of Hastings and were consequently rewarded with such estates, the latter family having their main seat at Lewes in Sussex.\n\nTownships [villages] held in the district by Ilbert de Laci [d. 1089] were Penistone, Thurlstone, Denby, Scissett, Skelmanthorpe, Clayton, Cawthorne, Silkstone, Chevet, Crofton, Snydale, Whitwood, Heath, Altofts, Newlands, Carlton, Methley, East Ardsley, Lofthouse, Middleton, Morley, Batley, Southowram, Elland, Greetland, Heckmondwike, Mirfield, Nether Midgley, Over Midgley, Middleton, Thornhill [manor built in 1236], Kirkheaton, Highburton [Birton], Deighton, Fixby, Bradley, Huddersfield, Almondbury.\n\nROBERT DE LACI, 1089-1121, who was certainly lord of Blackburnshire, though it is now impossible to discover by what means he became possessed of it. [2] As, however, the Hundred of Blackburn at the time of Domesday constituted a part of those vast possessions which the Conqueror granted to Roger de Busli and Albert de Greslet, the probability is that Lacy acquired this free from them, and held it under them. This opinion is strengthened by a charter of Henry I granting Boeland to this Robert, son of Ilbert, to be held of the Crown in capite, as it had heretofore been of Roger de Poitou.\n\nHugh de Laval 1121-1131\n\nWilliam Maltravers 1131-1136\n\nIlbert de Lacy (2nd) 1136-1141\n\nWilliam de Romare, Earl of Lincoln 1141-1146\n\nHenry de Lacy 1146-1187\n\nRobert de Lacy 1187-1193\n\nRoger (Fitz-Eustace) \"Helle\" de Lacy 1193-1211\n\nJohn de Lacy 1211-1240\n\nLords of the Honor of Clitheroe the DeLacys:\n\nIlbert was given the task by \"William the Bastard\" of quelling the Anglian insurrection in the district during \"The Harrying of the North\".

This opinion is strengthened by a charter of Henry I granting Boeland to this Robert, son of Ilbert, to be held of the Crown in capite, as it had heretofore been of Roger de Poitou.\n\nSire de Lacy of Ireland:\n\nAs descendants of the great Walter de Lacy of the Conguest of England, Gilbert de Lacy (d:1150) in tradition named a son, Hugh de Lacy. Hugh became the first Viceroy of Ireland, Governor of Ireland and the Lord Palantine of Meath.\n\nHugh was one of the conquerors of Ireland during the Norman conquest of Ireland. In 1172, he was chartered by the King of England to receive the submission of the Irish High King, Rory O'Connor.\n\nIn March of that same year, King Henry granted to Hugh the service of 50 knights and placed in charge of Dublin Castle. In addition he was granted the whole of the ancient Meath Province (the de Lacy Kingdom of Meath), totaling 900,000 acres, which included what is know as Meath and WestMeath, plus portions of other surrounding counties. In total then his possessions included Westmeath, Castlenock, Carlow, Longford, Offaly, Offelana, Kildare and Wicklow. Within this territory, he built many castles including: Castle of Screen, Navan, Trim Castle, Kileen Castle, Durrow and Castle of Leighlin in Carlow.\n\nHugh angered King Henry II by his marriage to Rose O'Connor, the daughter of the last of the native Kings of all Ireland. But, because of his liberal and just conduct he won the hearts of the Irish, making it his first care to preserve the native Irish in the possession of their lands. The suspicions by Henry though that Hugh had intentions of creating a separate Kingdom of Ireland independent of English jurisdiction and to be ruled solely by the de Lacy family, are evident by the Kings pleasure of Hugh's death in 1186 as reported by William of Newburg.\n\nThe following is a copy of the Royal grant made to Hugh de Lacy by King Henry II:\n\n\"Henry by the grace of God King of England, Duke of Normandy and Aquitain, and the Earl of Anjoy, to the Archbishops, Abbots, Earls, Barons, Justices, and all his ministers and faithful subjects, French, English, Irish, of all his Dominions, greeting: Know ye that I have given and granted and by this my charter confirmed unto Hugh de Lacy, in consideration of his services, the land of Meath with its appurtenances, to have and to hold of me my heirs, to him and his heirs by the service of fifty knights, in as full and ample a manner as Muirchard Hu-Melaghlin held it or any other person before or after him: and as an addition I give all the fees that he owes or shall owe me above Dublin while he is my baliff, to do me servcies in my city of Dublin. Wherefore I will strickly command that the said Hugh and hisheirs shall enjoy the said land and shall hold all the liberties and free customs which I have or may have therein by the aforesaid service from me and my heirs, well and peacefully, freely, quitely, and honourably, in wood and plain, in meadow and pasture, in water and mills, in warren and ponds, in fishing and hunting, in ways and paths, in seaports and all other places appertaining to the said land, with all liberties which I have therein or can grant or confirm to him by this my charter.\"\n\nSIRE DE LACY WAS OF FRENCH DESCENT AND SO MOST OF HIS BARONS\n\nHere is a list :\n\nTyrrell, Baron of Castleknock\n\nNangle, Baron of Navan\n\nDe Musset, Baron of Lune\n\nPhepoe, Baron of Scryne\n\nFitzThomas, Baron of Kells\n\nHussey, Baron of Galtrim\n\nFleming, Baron of Slane\n\nDullard, or Dollard, of Dullenvarty\n\nNugent, Baron of Delvin\n\nEarl of Westmeath\n\nTuite, Baron of Moyashell;\n\nRobert De Lacy's descendants, Barons of Rathwire;\n\nDe Constantine, Baron of Kilbixey;\n\nPetit, Baron of Mullingar;\n\nFitzHenry of Magherneran, Rathkenin, and Ardnorcher.

In the Heraldic language it is: a shield azure propre, or crussely, a lion, rampant, guardant, argant and the crest is a dragon's head vert, between two wings.\n\nAlso look at the list of Barons that served under Sire de Lacy, was our Le Sire de Dalton, a Knight serving under one of the names?\n\nGo to:\n\nhttp://www.aboutlancs.com/delacys.htm\n\nhttp://www.gengateway.com/genealogy/lacysite.htm\n\nhttp://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/history/norman_invasion.html\n\nThough this name is not Irish in origin it is on record in Dublin and Co. Meath as early as the beginning of the thirteenth century, the family having been established in Ireland following the Anglo-Norman invasion. Its Norman origin is more apparent in the alternative spelling, still sometimes used, viz D'Alton I.e. of Alton, a place in England. According to family tradition the first Dalton to come to Ireland was one Walter, who had fled to England from France, having incurred the wrath of the French king by secretly marrying his daughter. The early settlers became powerful, having acquired lands in Teffia, Co. Meath, under Henry II. There and in Co. Westmeath (part of which subsequently became known as Dalton's Country) they erected castles and founded religious houses. In the fourteenth century they spread into Counties Tipperary and Cork, but it was not until the middle of the seventeenth century that a branch of the family went to Clare, with which county they were afterwards closely identified. The head of the family was known as Lord of Rathconrath (Co. Westmeath); but as territorial magnates they were broken by the Cromwellian and Williamite devastations, having in the course of time completely identified themselves with the native Irish. The humbler families of the name, however, remained in Westmeath and their descendants are there today.\n\nI have read somewhere that the Irish Dalton coat of arms was copied after the de Lacy Coat of arms because Sir Walter De Aliton (Dalton) was a Knight under de Lacy.\n\nThe Dalton's of Lancashire:\n\nA lecture/talk given by Dr. Lucy Joan Slater, former Editor and Secretary, Dalton Genealogical Society, Cambridge, England.\n\nÒIn 1086 in the Doomsday Book there are three places called Dalton. Dalton near Wigan. Dalton-in-Furness and Dalton near Kirkby Stephen. The name Dalton only occurs as a place name, not as a surname. It simply means \"of the hill village.\" The earliest Dalton we hear of as a named man is Michael of Dalton, the Abbot of Furness Abbey in 1136.\n\nThere is a tradition that there was a man known as Le Sieur de Dalton, who was the head of the village of Dalton. He had two sons, one known as Dalton of Byspham and a second son, Symon, and a grandson, John Dalton, who was still alive in 1193. Also Le Sieur went with the Earl of Manchester, on behalf of King Stephen to treat with Henry II in France for his return to England in 1154. This man may have been called Walter and there is a tradition that when he had finished his business in France, he got the King of France's daughter into trouble and had to do a quick exit to Ireland. There he settled and founded the Irish Dalton's, who call themselves Daliton or Daton.\n\nAnother tradition says that three brothers, sons of John, went to the Crusades in the late 1100's. One of them, Sir Richard Dalton, killed a Saracen in the Holy Land and was given the green Griffen on the crest of the coat of arms, which the family carried for their services to King Richard.\n\nThe Flower's Visitation of Yorkshire in 1563-4 gives the main pedigree of the Dalton family. It started with Sir Rychard of Byspham born about 1230 and holding the manors of Byspham in Lancashire and Kirkby Misperton in Yorkshire. He had two sons, Sir Robert and Sir John. Sir John held the manor of Kirkby in 1332 and founded the Yorkshire line of Dalton's. Sir Robert was born in 1284 and died in 1350. About 1320, he married Mary, the daughter of Sir Thomas Lathom and she bore him a son, Sir John Dalton. Sir Robert had sided with the Earl of Lancaster who was beheaded in 1322 and Sir Robert was confined to Pontifract Castle for a time. However, his friends raised a ransom for him, so he was released and allowed to go back to his home at Byspham Manor. In 1327, when Edward II came to the throne, the fine was returned to Sir Robert and he was made Keeper of the Royal Forests and then the Constable of the Tower of London.\n\nIn the spring of 1346, King Edward prepared to invade France. He assembled the greatest army seen in England up to that date. With the King were his son Richard, the Black Prince, 12 Earls, over 1000 Knights, 4000 esquires, 20,000 archers and an unnumbered host of yeomen, blacksmiths, messengers, masons, cooks, minstrels and other camp followers. So we can imagine Sir Robert riding from his home in Byspham, clad in his best armour, wearing his plumed helm and carrying his great broad sword, his lance and with his shield in azure blue with the silver lion on his chest. He would be riding his great war horse which would be clad in armour. By his side was his son, Sir John, also in his best armour and behind them an esquire carrying a banner with the full coat of arms embroidered on it, complete with the green Griffen. They were also accompanied by a priest who bore a portable altar and some new winding sheets, just in case things did not go too well. [Winding sheets were burial sheets or palls.] The party rode down through Lancashire gathering more men of arms at every town and joined the Earl of Manchester. Then they brought the French to face them at Crecy, one of the most historical battles of all time. The English had the new technology of the day, bows and arrows, and of course easily won the battle.Ó\n\nNote: There is an on going search for evidence that this ÒLe Sieur de DaltonÓ of Lancashire and theÓ Walter DÕAlitonÓ of Ireland are the same man. (Read about the Irish branch of DaltonÕs in Chapter two.)\n\nThe ancient Saxon/English Dalton name, means ÒDale-TunÓ described as a Òfarm settlement in the little valley or town in the daleÓ.\n\nThe Dalton name is or has been spelled in various ways over the years; DÕAlton, de Dalton, Dolton, Dolten, Daulton, Daletonne, Dallton, de DÕAliton and Dealiton.\n\nThe place name of Dalton, from which our family derives from, occurs frequently in the six northern counties of England and in southern Scotland. Since there are many places called Dalton, there may have been as many people or families not related to each other, and yet bearing the same description, Òof DaltonÓ. Although they all could be of the same descendants of the first Le Sieur de Dalton!\n\nThere is in fact an immense variety of men and women with the ÒDaltonÓ surname, from highly placed ecclesiastics, scholars, scientists, titled and landed gentry, soldiers, merchants and lawyers, right down to the highway men in Great Britain, to that gang of ruffians in the USA, ÒThe Dalton GangÓ In Missouri, to the Mormon DaltonÕs in Utah and in the Western USA.\n\nThere are several Dalton pedigrees to serve us as a guide to our Dalton family history. There is in particular one of great extent, which arises in Yorkshire and another one in Lancashire. Both of these families have a very similar Coat of Arms, but the Lancashire branch is on record as the earlier of the two. The earliest description of the ÒDalton Coat of ArmsÓ is as follows:\n\nIn the ranks of the Knights of King Edward 1: ÒSir Robert de Dalton, Knight, dazur ove i dargent pouree de croiseletz dorÓ which is in Latin. It is a Lion rampant, and the date is 1322. This Sir Robert bore this ÒCoat of ArmsÓ at the battle of Boroughbridge and at the siege of Calais.\n\nThis means that on a ground of azure, powdered with gold crossiets, is a silver \"lypard\", or as it is put in all the later descriptions, a Lion rampant, and the date is 1322. This Sir Robert was the founder of the Lancashire family, but in Foster's great book of pedigrees of Yorkshire family, the Arms are the same with the addition of \"a chief barry nebulae, arg. and sa.\" - that is, across the top of the shield are three wavy lines in black and silver. These Arms are of the next century; but it seems very unlikely that two families of the same name should have had Arms so much alike and yet have been unrelated to each other.\n\nThe Dalton Crest used by the Dalton Genealogical Societ\n\nIn a rare list of crests, collected by Thomas Wall in the reign of Henry VII, and printed in the ÒAncestorÓ, ours is No. 17: \"Dalton beryffi to his crest a green dragons hede vert langued geulesÓ\n\nThis crest, of a green dragons head, but with open wings in gold, is the one which was used by John Dalton of Stanmore and Peckham, who died in 1851, and whose monument has this crest sculptured on it in the old disused churchyard of St. Giles, Camberwell. The above Crest is the one used by the DGS of England.\n\nCrests are a survival of the old fighting times when a mans face was concealed and he wore on his helmet a sign by which he could be recognized in battle, and the shield was adorned for the same reason with some device which proclaimed his identity. Although anyone nowadays who can afford the fees can have \"arms\" devised for him by the College of Heralds, it is not the same thing as belonging to a family who can prove that they had knightly ancestors in the far past; and so I am putting down the references, in many places, which can be verified, as evidence of the family's existence.\n\nLets now talk about the early KnightÕs of England of whom many of our early DaltonÕs were. We think the first was Sir Richard Dalton, born about 1200 AD, the son of John de Dalton of Byspham, Lancashire.\n\nThe Great KnightÕs of England:\n\nThe story of the Great Knights of England goes back to the time of the Plantagenet Kings. Under which everyone with a certain income was required to take up the status of a Knight. It was an indirect form of taxation. In this way the Crown had the full support of these Knights and all theyÕre many men and wealth.\n\nThese Knights were given a great amount of land and titles for theyÕre many services they provided to whichever King was in power. The title of Sir was one, which implied possessions as well as knighthood. And from the fact that from the beginning we find our \"DaltonÕs\" owners of lands, holding good positions, forming good family alliances, and bearing fashionable Norman names, it looks more than likely that they were of Norman origin. They took their titles from Old Saxon manors or lordships.\n\nHistory of Knights:\n\nLike most periods in history, the era of knights evolved gradually. The term \"knight\" originates from the Anglo-Saxon name for a boy: \"cniht\". Indeed, most early knights were not much more than hired \"boys\" who offered military service and loyalty to whatever well-to-do nobleman or warlord that offered the most promise of money or war booty.\n\nIn the chaos and danger of post-Roman Western Europe, the population had very little protection from brigands and conquering warbands. It soon became apparent there was safety in numbers, and local lords (who could afford it) gathered around them young, fighting-age men to fend off rebellious vassals or conquering neighbors. These men, in turn, were rewarded with war booty for their service and loyalty. Soon, grants of land were made so the young soldiers could receive an income from those lands and afford the high cost of outfitting themselves with the accoutrements of war, such as horses, armor, and weapons. The era of the medieval knight had begun.\n\nIt wasn't long before knights began to treat their land grants as hereditary rights (usually transferring ownership to the eldest son upon death), and thus began the rise of knights as a \"landed\" class whose importance went beyond simply being a military \"free-agent\". Knights soon found themselves involved in local politics, the dispensation of justice, and numerous other required tasks for their sovereigns, or liege lord.\n\nOn becoming a Knight:\n\nTo become a knight, you had to go through three stages; page, squire, and knighting. When a boy turned 7, they would leave home and start their training for knighthood. As a page, he joined the household of another knight or a nobleman. There they would train him how to use and handle small weapons. They also taught him manors, and behaviors of a knight. Then at 15 or 16 they would advance to squire. In this position he would be a servant to the knight who had become his master. Training progressed and advanced to that of a mounted soldier. This would come in handy when he was called to assist his knight in battle. This would usually last around five years. Then the squire was eligible for knighthood. Any knight could bestow knighthood on another.\n\nTaken to his lord and kneels, and a knight dubs the new knight by tapping him on the shoulder with his sword, then delivers the accolade by saying something like: \"In the Almighty's name, I dub you a knight. Be worthy, valiant and humble\". Led out of church, hailed with cheers and the new knight eats breakfast. Later in the day the new knight goes to the courtyard, where the others await him. Two loud trumpets, singers, priests and monks, Knight followed by all present to the grounds by the garden to a platform covered with carpets. Sponsor kisses knight, puts spurs on him. 2nd and 3rd sponsors put on his steel hauberk and helmet. 4th sponsor puts sword on the knight and says, \"use it worthily\". Moral instruction and encouragement offered and the new knight takes the oath of knighthood, declares his commitment to justice and faith. Music begins. Leaves platform, runs to horse and leaps onto its saddle. Crowd applauds; his squire brings his lance and shield. There is a jousting tournament in his honor the next day.\n\nFeasts were held in his honor, with singing and music. His attire laid out for guests to see: Spotless white shirt, costly robe of ermine, golden spurs. Bathes and dresses: white shirt, brown silk hose, white outer-girdle and crimson robe. To chapel of parish church and prays all evening, stands or kneels for 10 hours. Lamp on altar, large candles beside alter. Weapons and armor on alter. Mass the next morning. Knight put on sword and spurs.\n\nIn medieval history, the knight was an armed and mounted warrior belonging to the nobility. The incessant private warfare that characterized medieval times brought about a permanent military class, and by the 10th century the institution of knighthood was well established. The knight was essentially a military officer, although with the growth of feudalism the term tended to denote the holder of not only a position in the ranks of nobility but also in the ranks of landholders. The knight generally held his lands by military tenure; thus knight service was a military service, normally expected by an overlord in exchange for each fief held by a knight. All military service was measured in terms of knight service, and a vassal might owe any number of knight services.\n\nAlthough all nobles of military age were necessarily knights, knighthood was earned through some exploit involving the use of arms. In the late Middle Ages the son of a noble would serve first as page, then as squire, before being made a knight. Knighthood was conferred by the overlord with the accolade (a blow, usually with the flat of the sword, on the neck or shoulder); in the later period of feudalism, the ceremony was preceded by the religious ceremony of a vigil before an altar. A knight fighting under another's banner was called a knight bachelor; a knight fighting under his own banner was a knight banneret. Knights were ordinarily accompanied in battle by personal attendants (squires and pages) and by vassals.\n\nTournaments provided a means for knights to practice warfare and build their strength in times of peace. Tournaments were essentially mock battles with audiences. The audience was usually made up of \"fair damsels\". This was another way in which a knight was expected to act chivalrous. The tournaments had different rules that had to be followed. They were judged by umpires that watched for dishonest play. Tournaments were usually fought between either two people or two teams. If two people fought a tournament, it was usually by jousting. The two knights would gallop across the playing field at each other. They carried long, blunt poles and shields. The objective was to knock the other person out of his saddle. Team play was conducted with fierce mock combat between two bands of fighters. They fought with wooden or blunted weapons so as to reduce the risk of getting hurt. However, this was often not the case. Many people did get hurt or die by accident.\n\nLife of a Knight:\n\nThe new knight now served his liege lord (which may or may not be the king himself), bound to offer military service up to 40 days a year in peace time, more, as needed, in war time. Military duties included castle guard, serving in the lord's \"bodyguard\", and participating in battle.\n\nApart from military duties the knight could also participate in administering justice, managing his estates (which was his prime source of income), and continuing to hone his combat skills in tournament.\n\nHeraldry (symbols identifiable with individuals or families) originated as a way to identify knights in battle or in tournaments. With the advent of the \"great\" or \"barrel\" helm (ca. early 13th century) an individual's face became concealed. It therefore became necessary to create a method to distinguish ally from enemy.\n\nHeraldic symbols were often worn on the knight's surcoat (thus the term \"coat of arms\"), shield, helmet, or on a banner (standard) that could serve as a rallying point for knights and others scattered in the chaos of battle. The standard was always to be elevated as long as the battle continued, and therefore was guarded well. A standard taken down would signal the allied combatants that the cause was lost and it was time to flee the field of combat.\n\nThe career of a knight was costly, requiring personal means in keeping with the station; for a knight had to defray his own expenses in an age when the sovereign had neither treasury nor war budget at his disposal. When land was the only kind of riches, each lord paramount who wished to raise an army divided his domain into military fiefs, the tenant being held to military service at his own personal expense for a fixed number of days (forty in France and in England during the Norman period). These fees, like other feudal grants, became hereditary, and thus developed a noble class, for whom the knightly profession was the only career. Knighthood, however, was not hereditary, though only the sons of a knight were eligible to its ranks. In boyhood they were sent to the court of some noble, where they were trained in the use of horses and weapons, and were taught lessons of courtesy. From the thirteenth century, the candidates, after they had attained the rank of squire, were allowed to take part in battles; but it was only when they had come of age, commonly twenty-one years, that they were admitted to the rank of knight by means of a peculiar ceremonial called \"dubbing.\" Every knight was qualified to confer knighthood, provided the aspirant fulfilled the requisite conditions of birth, age, and training. Where the condition of birth was lacking in the aspirant, the sovereign alone could create a knight, as a part of his royal prerogative.\n\nKnights associated in-groups, which they called orders. They vowed loyalty to the king they fought under and formed military organizations to defend his land and property against the enemies. The knights would go on crusades throughout the land to assure this freedom for the king. Any knight in those days who became a knight also had to take religious vows to live as monks as well as defending the king.\n\nSo as you have read in the above article about, our early Dalton's had the great fortune to be Knights and therefor-upper class gentry.\n\nThe Dalton pedigree was recorded by William Flower, Norroy, King-of-Arms, at the ÒVisitation of YorkshireÓ in 1563-4. It was a survey of all people and lands in the County of Lancashire and is among the collected papers known as the Harleian Manuscripts.\n\nThe ÒVisitation of YorkshireÓ gives genealogical information showing the Lancashire Dalton's and the Yorkshire Dalton's united by the common ancestor, and as there is confirming evidence about the earliest members, we can safely accept the pedigree as being more or less true.\n\nIn this chapter there is a complete pedigree of the Dalton Family in Lancashire County, starting with Le Sieur de Dalton, whose son was John Dalton of Byspham, which was at this time the name of the land on which the DaltonÕs owned. John Dalton 1st, whose son was also named John Dalton, and who was the father of Sir Rychard Dalton of Byspham, a crusader who killed a Saracen in the Holy Lands. From this act the Dalton family takes the Green Griffin in its Crest. Rychard is buried at Dalton Manor at Byspham.\n\nThe name of ÒDuchy of LancashireÓ played a very large part in our Dalton family history through out the greater part of time in England and later on in South Wales.\n\nThe origins of Lancashire England:\n\nSources:\n\nThe following history of Lancashire was copied from numerous books that are on deposit at the Harold B. Lee Library on the campus of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.\n\nThe name of Lancashire is said to be derived from the Saxon Lancasterscyre, after the county town. Antiquarians say that the name of the county town itself came from Alauna, Lancaster being situated upon the River Lan.\n\nLancashire, at the time of the taking of the Domesday Book in 1086, held a very different profile. It extended from the northern shore of the River Mersey, north to the River Ribble. North of the Ribble was officially Yorkshire in the Domesday Survey. Lancashire was almost wholly the domain of Count Roger of Poitou, third son of the great Earl Roger de Montgomery II, the seignior of Montgomerii in the arrondisement of Lisieux in Normandy. Roger of Poitou (sometimes Pictavencis, Pictavis or, in the West Riding, known as Roger le Poitevin). Those extensive and rich holdings in the West Riding of Yorkshire were grants made by Duke William of Normandy in reward for his father's, Roger de Montgomery's assistance at the Battle of Hastings. Roger de Montgomery II was in command of a wing at the Battle of Hastings, but returned to Normandy with Queen Matilda, and the young Duke Robert as Duke William's representative. He became head of the council that governed the Duchy of Normandy in Duke William's absence in England. The Norman Montgomery family ancestry was closely interwoven either by blood or marriage with the Duchy of Normandy. Roger de Montgomery had four sons. Eldest was Robert, Count of Alencon, and his successor in Normandy. He was followed by Hugh, who inherited the Earldom of Arundel, Chichester and Shrewsbury, the life custodian of the main family domains granted in England. These would eventually go to Robert in 1098, purchased from William Rufus for 3000 pounds. Next youngest was Count Roger de Poitou who was made the first Earl of Lancaster by Duke William of Normandy, a less magnanimous grant which befitted the third youngest son. Philip, the youngest, remained in Normandy and accompanied Duke Robert on the first crusade to the Holy Land, and died there in 1094.\n\nAt the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066 the County of Lancashire had not yet been defined, but its subsequent components already existed as administrative areas.\n\nSix or seven years after the conquest (1072/3) King W"
