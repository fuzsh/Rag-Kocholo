        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfession Actor\n\nBritish nationality\n\nBirth February 16, 1964 (Salford – England)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBorn in England, Christopher Eccleston studied at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. He made his acting debut on prestigious stages such as the Old Vic in Bristol and the Royal Court Theatre . In 1991, Peter Medak offered him his first film role in L’Age de vivre , but it was Petits Meurtres entre amis which revealed him in 1994 – a cynical comedy about friendship and money crowned with a Bafta in 1995 which also propelled Ewan McGregor and director Danny Boyle to the forefront.\n\nHis early career alternated local television appearances ( Cracker , Our Friends In The North ) with increasingly important roles on the big screen. In the cinema, he distinguished himself in 19th century England with Jude (1996, Michael Winterbottom ), a drama adapted from Thomas Hardy ‘s final novel , then played the role of Duke of Norfolk in the historical fresco Elizabeth (1998, Shekhar Kapur ), project manager of the mind-blowing eXistenZ (1999, David Cronenberg ), life companion of Debla Kirwan in With or Without You (id., again directed by Michael Winterbottom ) and rabbi in Sonia Horowitz, l’insoumise (2000, Boaz Yakin ).\n\nThis year 2000 saw him move from the small, intimate British film to the Hollywood blockbuster in 60 Seconds Flat , where he rubbed shoulders with Angelina Jolie and Nicolas Cage (2000, Dominic Sena ), then make a foray into the disturbing The Others by Alejandro Amenábar ( 2001). Moving with ease from one register to another, he took on roles on television ( Strumpet , Othello , The King and Us ), dabbled in rock ‘n’ roll for his friend Michael Winterbottom ( 24 Hour Party People , 2002 ), returns to the 19th century in Dina (id., Ole Borneal ), embarks with Jordana Brewster on an initiatory journey ( The Invisible Circus , 2003) before radically changing setting and era in the horrific 28 Days Later (id.), for which he found Danny Boyle .\n\nIn 2005, his popularity took a leap forward when he agreed to lend his features to the ninth incarnation of the Doctor, hero of the fantasy series Doctor Who , a real institution in Great Britain subject to a reboot that year . But the following year, he left the key to the Tardis with David Tennant and crossed the Atlantic to play in a few episodes of Heroes (2007).\n\nHe then opposed Channing Tatum in the first opus of GI Joe (2009), then disappeared alongside Hilary Swank in Amelia , a drama based on the true story of aviator Amelia Earhart (2010, Mira Nair ) . That same year, he appeared on the BBC, decked out in round glasses, in the immaculate clothes of the great John Lennon for the needs of Lennon Naked , then was awarded an Emmy Award for his role in the pilot of the series Accused ( id.). Attached to the small screen, he played in 2011 in the choral series The Shadow Line and starred in the mini-series Blackout on Los Angeles .\n\nOn the cinema side, Christopher Eccleston appears two years later in the dramatic comedy Song for Marion where he plays the offspring of Terence Stamp , and in the sequel to Thor , where he takes on the costume of the supervillain Malekith the Accursed."
