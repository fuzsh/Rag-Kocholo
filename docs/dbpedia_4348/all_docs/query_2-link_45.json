        "text": "I wish they started the episode with either a \"Previously On...\" or just went straight into the episode, because that intro with him talking to us was so awkward. The mixing of SD and HD footage was jarring as well and, more importantly, made me feel like on old bitch.\n\nDL fave Miriam Margolyes did fantastic voice work as Meep, but she's always excelled at that, so no surprise there. The twist was obvious from the start, like r5 said.\n\nI really wish they treated the trans and nonbinary stuff more organically, especially because these people themselves say they don't want to be presented (only) in preachy PSAs. Feels so '90s and that's unfortunately just RTD showing his age. Same for the disabled stuff. It's not doing anyone any favours, it just serves to give the showrunner the false impression that he's changing the world. Hopefully they got it out of their system now and we can have more subtlety going forward, especially with the black gay Doctor entering stage soon. I don't want pushback from the haters because they feel they're being lectured to.\n\nPreachiness aside, the episode felt like quintessential RTD Doctor Who – nowhere near as polished and convoluted as Moffat, not as boring and clunky as Chibnall, but rather just campy and fun. Which isn't bad and I think I might start watching the show again.\n\nThis is the most I've enjoyed Who in years. Tennant and Tate didn't miss a beat. If anything, I'm only sad we're only getting two more of these.\n\nI actually think the pronoun stuff and the binary/non-binary bit wasn't so much about being a PSA, it was kind of there to intentionally troll the people who would post angry missives about how the show just raped their childhoods on Twitter.\n\nIt's clear the BBC put Disney's money to really good use. The look of the special was a level beyond even the highest production values we've seen before.\n\nAll Hail the Meep!\n\nLooking around online, people seem to have loved the episode, heavy-handedness notwithstanding. It's quite the feat for RTD to pull people back to his era of Doctor Who so quickly and seamlessly. Fingers crossed this isn't just down to Tennant's and Tate's chemistry and continues even after Gatwa's arrival.\n\n[quote]The look of the special was a level beyond even the highest production values we've seen before.\n\nI agree when it comes to the street battle and the sonic screwdriver stuff, but I think Moffat's episodes looked... glossier somehow? Or maybe the set design was just more twee during his tenure and that's what's throwing me off.\n\n[quote]I also have no memory of the lottery arc.\n\nIt's not an arc. It's like one snippet of a scene.\n\nSo, Ten goes around and interacts briefly with all his companions--He saves Martha and Mickey from a Sontaran, keeps Luke from getting hit by a car and says goodbye to Sarah Jane, arranges an introduction between Jack and (the extremely masculine) Russell Tovey's character Alonso from \"Voyage of the Damned,\" visits the great-granddaughter of the woman he romanced in \"Human Nature\"/\"Family of Blood\" (who is named Verity Newman after Verity Lambert and Sydney Newman), has a brief moment with Rose shortly before she meets Nine, and gives Wilf the lottery ticket for Donna.\n\n[quote]So, Ten goes around and interacts briefly with all his companions--He saves Martha and Mickey from a Sontaran, keeps Luke from getting hit by a car and says goodbye to Sarah Jane, arranges an introduction between Jack and (the extremely masculine) Russell Tovey's character Alonso from \"Voyage of the Damned,\" visits the great-granddaughter of the woman he romanced in \"Human Nature\"/\"Family of Blood\" (who is named Verity Newman after Verity Lambert and Sydney Newman), has a brief moment with Rose shortly before she meets Nine, and gives Wilf the lottery ticket for Donna.\n\nThank you - I remember this now.\n\nI have a desire to watch Turn Left now. And Blink. And the one with Tracy Ann Oberman as Yvonne Hartman.\n\nr34 Dear lord, that was abysmal. And I'm not just talking about the writing, but the whole package. Not even the dreamy Sacha Dhawan with his velvety voice and the beautiful hair and the perfectly-trimmed beard could sell that horseshit to me, and I once lobbied hard on DL for him to be cast as the next Doctor AND the next Bond.\n\nI mean, just laughable. Chibnall did that one trauma porn show – relying on shock value of paedophilia before the whole QAnon hysteria – that took off among the fraus and suddenly he gets the reins to Doctor Who? They should have left the show rest for a couple of years instead.\n\nWell only 4 weeks and a day until The Church on Ruby Road.\n\nI was a casual fan as a child (Peter Davison regenerating into Colin Baker was my era) and enjoyed the Eccleston series. The Tennant era got better and better and Matt Smith was enjoyable but by the time of Capaldi it all felt like it had been done before. Cybermen again. Daleks again.\n\nThe quality of the writing but also the calibre of the actors made the series. Simon Callow, Annette Badland, Penelope Wilton, Pauline Collins, Shirley Henderson, Carey Mulligan, Derek Jacobi, Sarah Lancashire, Miss Kylie Ann Minogue, Alex Kingston, Lindsay Duncan, Gemma Chan, David Harewood, Timothy Dalton and Clare Bloom. That's just the RTD era and I know I've forgotten some.\n\nThe Michael Gambon Katherine Jenkins Christmas Carol episode was one of the most beautiful pieces of TV.\n\nFirst look at Christmas special. New companion was obviously cast to make him appear taller, which is smart. Both their jackets give off a comforting vibe, this is going to be so damn cosy, I can feel it already.\n\n[quote]During an appearance on the BBC's Morning Live, Davies teased what viewers can expect from the Christmas Day episode: \"It's really exciting, it's thrilling, it's explosive, it's brilliant. You've seen Ncuti in Sex Education, he is just the most phenomenal human being. Christmas Day is a new start again, come and join a brand new adventure.\"\n\nOkay, don't oversell it, babe.\n\nI *just* found out that Tenant and Tate were back for three episodes. I tapped out during Capaldi’s tenure because it got boring as hell and never saw any of Whittaker’s but I had to watch this because Ten and Donna are my favorite Doctor and companion and I really felt like they ruined her ending. I was absolutely convinced that Donna Noble was “The Woman” regenerated after thousands of years and was actually the Doctor’s mother. Somewhere along the line it was said he was half human. Her name was Donna Noble Temple which literally translates to Lady Time Lord! And when The Woman kept appearing it was to Donna’s grandfather Wilf. All signs pointed to Donna=the Doctor’s mom, and they went out of their way to make it clear there was never any romantic feelings between the two.\n\nBut a friend told me that theory was explained away in the seasons I missed. I’m guessing that was the Timeless Child?\n\nI mean if River Song can regenerate simply because she was conceived by two humans on the TARDIS, surely Doctor Donna can.\n\nBut I was confused by the ending of this episode. Did Donna and Rose give up their Time Lord power or just whatever it is that would kill them?\n\nI actually liked Rose and the actress playing her. And loved Donna’s fierce protectiveness.\n\nSo I have no idea what the hell is going on, but it was great to see Tenant and Tate back together. Surely they’re the most popular Doctor and companion of the modern series.\n\nI’ll watch the next two specials, but I may tap out again. It sounds like they’ve taken the story so off the rails that it’ll be impossible to ever fix.\n\nBut who knows. If you have a machine that can travel through time AND space, I guess any problem can be corrected.\n\nThere were heaps of gay jokes in the Eccleston and Tennant Doctor Who, before Torchwood existed. It was very clear in Who that Captain Jack was not only rampantly bisexual but fancied Tennant. There was also the more serious storyline about the little gay boy amidst the celebrations of the Coronation in 1952. So all of that was very woke, considering that Who was considered a show that children would watch.\n\nTrans issues were not the Zeitgeist, but they always existed (cf Priscilla Queen of the Desert). If they had been relevant to one of his plots, as they were to this one, he'd have included them then for sure. You're right however that \"non-binary\" per se was only invented recently.\n\nI wasn’t bothered at all by the Rose character or actress, but it seemed kinda like they were implying that all the suppressed memories Donna had of her time with the Doctor came out in life by doing things like giving away all the lottery money and having a daughter named Rose.\n\nBut wouldn’t have Rose chosen that name for herself? I guess they could argue that some of those memories ended up in Rose along with the Time Lord energy and knowledge (which I still think that just “letting go” of was a stupid way to end that problem!)\n\nR65, it is stated that Rose DID choose that name for herself.\n\nIf I've understood correctly, the reason Donna didn't die when she recognised the Doctor was that back when she had Rose or whatever his name was (I missed the male name on my one viewing) part of the Time Lord in her passed to Rose. \"They\" (meaning Rose, not Rose and Donna) thus started to do things like choose that name, make stuffed toys that looked like aliens Donna had met, etc. Because it was spread out across the two, the effect wasn't strong enough to kill either of them. That's where the \"binary/non-binary\" joke came in, although if we look closely the cure is in the binary, and the non-binary mentions are just for wokeness.\n\nI look forward to the day IT gets attacked for being binary.\n\nI was (stupidly) sure they were going to end it without him realizing before they left. It’s not like ANY of the Doctor’s companions end up living happily ever after their encounters with him. They may ultimately get some small reward somewhere down the road. Rose was left in tears in an alternate dimension and thought she’d never see him again until they gave her a human Doctor years later. Donna’s whole memory was wiped. Poor Amy and Rory had to live the rest of their lives in a small apartment in Brooklyn in the 1920s reliving the same day for eternity, Clara is a millisecond away from death and has to spend the rest of her life traveling the universe with Arya Stark AFTER they killed her boyfriend in a car accident(!), and I don’t even want to talk about what they did to Bill! I couldn’t even watch the 13th Doctor, so I just assume something awful happened to her companions as well. Even his own WIFE died the very first day he met her.\n\nMartha and Mickey ended up married, but they also ended up working for UNIT, so I’m guessing it’s more likely that one or both of them died during an alien invasion when the Doctor wasn’t around and never got to have kids much less grandkids to hold.\n\nBasically, meeting the Doctor sounds like the worst thing that could possibly happen to you.\n\nIf a Brit of any age, gender, or race pops out of a big blue police box, and asks you if you want a ride, the answer should be a stern NO.\n\nSee all of time and space? No. I’d rather still be alive and on earth after 13 episodes, thank you very much.\n\nGreen screen and some of the CG looked really iffy towards the start, but I don't know whether it improved later on or if I just got used to it. Definitely doesn't look like your Doctor Who of old. Fun episode, I enjoyed it even more than last week's. Neither have felt particularly like 60th anniversary specials, although I have a suspicion that was always just a marketing gimmick; the real purpose of these is to be the least awkward bridge possible between Whittaker and Gatwa. Some acknowledgement of Chibnall's arcs here and there, but also a very palpable desire to move on.\n\nRTD ever so slowly working the gay/bisexual/ pansexual angle in, did you catch that remark by Donna?\n\nI enjoyed it, although that intro was so rushed and its editing choppy (Charlie de Melo is a handsome fucker). The music was so loud throughout, I struggled to hear the dialogue at times. I suppose this is what NPH meant by the series being super gay – confetti and lipsyncing to Spice Girls and doing snow angels in rose petals. We'll see if that sort of sensibility carries on into the next season as well. Gatwa is sporting a skirt in that Christmas special trailer, so I suppose that'll very much be the case. I just hope he's more fun now after letting Tennant deal with all the past trauma. Clean slate.\n\nBasically no payoff to the fact that everyone in the real world was cancelling each other, RTD just used that bit for a throwaway line. No mention of the fact that Donna put her own mother on cancellation notice for misgendering Rose that one time.\n\nReally not a fan of how disabled people were presented in these two episodes. Everyone was policing their language and constantly asking whether she was offended. That hasn't been my experience with wheelchair-bound people at all. In fact, they all fucking hate that patronising bullshit that centres their disability in their interactions with others.\n\nWhat was going on with Gatwa's Rs? Some of them were rhotic and some of them were not? It was jarring, I'm sure there's a creative reason behind it. Perhaps he's still transitioning?\n\nThe actor playing Ibrahim is tall and handsome, but he walks quite doily – not so much like a seasoned special ops guy, more like a male model sashaying down the catwalk. So that made me laugh. Here pictured smelling cookies with Joanna Lumley and a Stevie Nicks knockoff of some kind. His hair looks much nicer here than that horrid greasejob they gave him on the show.\n\nHe sounds bitter. And it probably had more weight if others agreed with him. But nobody does. Not only had David Tennant the best time ever with Davies, Tranter, Collinson and Gardner as Ten; he even came back to work more with them. Maybe it's you, Chris. Besides, didn't Davies even apologize for not being the best and most protective producer in 2004/2005? I guess that wasn't enough for an apology, or there was more.\n\nIt's a shame really. I liked Eccleston's Nine a lot. It was such a unique version of the Doctor.\n\nI knew some people working on the reboot series of Doctor Who in 2004 and it was a shitshow as has been documented by others. Chaotic, unprofessional and very, very unhappy.\n\nEccleston had been in countless big budget movies and prestige tv productions by that point - Our Friends In The North, Cracker, Hillsborough, Clocking Off, Othello and The Second Coming were all BAFTA nominated with most winning - and he was appalled by what was going on. Yes Eccleston can be pompous but he was the voice of calm and experience on the set.\n\nBillie Piper was only 21 but making a \"comeback\" and as famous for her drug use and failed marriage as she was for her music career. Cast in a major acting role with limited acting experience. The definition of vulnerable, but she wasn't supported by the mostly gay male crew and production team.\n\nJohn Barrowman's behaviour on set was not just well known but encouraged by some senior members of the production team. David Tennant commented about the culture on set and how he and Steven Moffat were often the only two straight men, and they'd go off together and talk about straight things. Phil Collinson left the set for a period during one of the later series.\n\nBut back to Eccleston, a statement was released by the BBC saying he was \"tired\" after the filming of the first series and that's why he wasn't returning. The BBC apologised after threats of legal action, something the BBC rarely does.\n\nDespite that, the rebooted series won Best Drama Series at the 2006 BAFTAs.\n\nThe series is not being received well by those who are actually watching it. On IMDb, “The Star Beast” received a 5.2 rating out of 10. “Wild Blue Yonder” has a 6.5 out of 10, and “The Giggle” currently has a 7.5 out of 10.\n\nOverall, the series has a 6.6 out of 10 rating.\n\nDoctor Who ratings on IMDb\n\nThe series fares even worse on Rotten Tomatoes. The show currently has a 43% average audience score.\n\nDoctor Who ratings on Rotten Tomatoes\n\nThe series has also been lampooned by previous fans of the series. Pop culture expert and lover of old Doctor Who, Gary Buechler, the host of the YouTube channel Nerdrotic savaged “The Star Beast” episode noting it was “sacrificed on the altar of agenda” and that “the now third reboot of Doctor Who was murdered in its crib.”\n\nRELATED: Showrunner Russell T Davies Promises Ncuti Gatwa’s Run As The Doctor Will “Unroll A Whole New Doctor Who Mythology,” Admits New Fantasy Focus “Will Annoy People”\n\nIt’s unlikely the series viewership will recover, but will instead continued its continued decline. In fact, showrunner Russell T. Davies announced that upcoming episodes of the show will “annoy people.”\n\nHe told Radio Times, “The show is taking a sly step towards fantasy, which will annoy people to whom it’s a hard science-fiction show.”\n\nDavies added, “Episode two next year is wildly fantasy. Completely making up scenarios on-screen that we’ve never been able to show before. But the following episode is proper hard science-fiction.”\n\nShowrunner Russell T Davies Promises Ncuti Gatwa’s Run As The Doctor Will “Unroll A Whole New Doctor Who Mythology,” Admits New Fantasy Focus “Will Annoy People”\n\nIt’s unlikely the series viewership will recover, but will instead continued its continued decline. In fact, showrunner Russell T. Davies announced that upcoming episodes of the show will “annoy people.”\n\nHe told Radio Times, “The show is taking a sly step towards fantasy, which will annoy people to whom it’s a hard science-fiction show.”\n\nThis episode had a pretty wonky feel to it, I wonder if that's due to the nature of it being a special or if this is how the whole season will feel like.\n\nI've noticed this in The Giggle as well, but there is a thing where snappy editing – which I normally enjoy – can be too snappy. There are very few quiet moments in this that would allow for the dynamic moments to pop more. The worst example of this was Ruby being shown bored at a bar for two or three seconds before she sees the Doctor. The music is blaring throughout, so there's no contrast between her state and the moment of her seeing the Doctor. Very shoddy direction, editing, but I suspect also storyboarding by RTD. The whole thing felt like it was hastily assembled together. The goblins were cute, but also had that naff CG feel that doesn't really go with Doctor Who.\n\nThe refurbished Big Ben looks so good, although it now makes even more apparent the sad state of the Parliament building.\n\nThe lady at the end is older Ruby? Why did she look into the camera, what am I missing here?\n\nLoved the singing, should be a regular occurrence.\n\nIs the lady at the end older Ruby? They didn’t do a good job making it clear who she was or why she knew what a TARDIS was.\n\nI just thought Ruby was too wide-eyed and happy while discovering that goblins were about to EAT her new baby sister!!\n\nAnd nothing in the whole story even hinted at why she was important or what the significance of being born at 2 pm on Xmas eve was. Or what they’re going to do about crack, who her mother (or whoever left her) was or why she’s so drawn to the Doctor and he to her.\n\nI could excuse a few unanswered questions if I thought they’d be answered during the season’s episodes, but they didn’t even give a single hint to ANYTHING that was going on! She was just a too happy young woman who was overly excited by a baby getting eaten and her apartment cracking in half!! So frustrating!!!\n\nAfter this season, two seasons tops with the 15th Doctor, I want a 16th Doctor played by Martin Freeman or Jason Isaacs and at least ONE full season where River Song is his companion and we get to see the great romance that they’ve hinted at but never actually shown. I don’t think this is the right Doctor, him being young and gay and all.\n\nI demand it!!\n\nI'll be contrarian. I've only watched \"Space Babies\" thus far, but I quite liked it. Not so much for the actual plot, but I enjoy them establishing the dynamic between the Doctor and Ruby. And while I know the whole Timeless Child bit was universally hated, I give then credit for both A) not sweeping it under the rug, and B) using it to create a parallel between Fifteen and Ruby.\n\nAlso, it looks GREAT.\n\nThey couldn't be telegraphing the Big Bad being the Rani harder, could they?\n\nI enjoyed the baby episode, it was cute, but occasionally felt like a primer for newbies, what with all that background info. The \"oh, by the way, this episode is about refugees\" bit when they were talking to the nanny felt really forced. My one real complaint is that there was just this constant music playing over every single scene, there wasn't a single quiet moment where we could catch a break, so that the dramatic moments could land harder. What's up with that? And it's not particularly good score either, it's muzak-adjacent.\n\nGatwa feels more natural here than in his first appearance, I didn't for a second feel like he was cosplaying as the Doctor, he *was* the Doctor. I like that he revealed the Tardis to Ruby's parents in the premiere, that felt fresh.\n\nSecond episode was enjoyable as well. Jinxx was great, although maybe overdid the ham here and there. Actor playing Lennon was way cuter than the actual Lennon. The \"twist\" musical number at the end had no real purpose, they had one because they wanted to have one.\n\n[quote]Jinxx was great, although maybe overdid the ham here and there.\n\nI was expecting it to be completely gimmicky, but I thought she was great. She definitely have them their money's worth.\n\n[quote]The \"twist\" musical number at the end had no real purpose, they had one because they wanted to have one.\n\nDavies clearly has no fucks to give about anyone who's going to be triggered by the show being so damned queer, and I'm here for it. I'm not saying that I agree with every creative decision, but there's something incredibly refreshing about him doing whatever the hell he wants.\n\n[quote] I'm not saying that I agree with every creative decision, but there's something incredibly refreshing about him doing whatever the hell he wants.\n\nMy issue with that is he should have done whatever the hell he wants with a new property instead of leeching the goodwill out of a well established mythos beloved across so many generations.\n\nThe Time Lords were mean to the Doctor when he was a little black girl? C'mon.\n\nThe Tennant series were the best - RTD had a vision that spread over several series and was complimented by other writers.\n\nThere were forgettable episodes from RTD and other writers but the Simon Callow as Dickens, ARE YOU MY MUMMY, Blink. River Song and Agatha Christie were all fantastic.\n\nAnd it helped that they had a revolving door of fantastic actors making guest appearances.\n\nI liked elements of the Matt Smith era - the Christmas Carol one was one of the greatest ever episodes - but lost interest with Peter Capaldi. Nothing personal about him or Jenna but it was just repetitive. I watched a few Jodie episodes and sat through the Aisling Bea one because I thought it finished with regeneration and it was ok but Daleks again.\n\nIt's 20 years now since it came back - the original series ran for 26 years. There's only so much road you can cover and trying to reinvent the wheel by claiming its a black queer wheel is self defeating.\n\nYeah, I think I prefer the Moffat era as well. The episodes were so nicely structured – you had the beginning, the buildup, the climax, and the resolution. It's like RTD watched the Chibnall episodes and jotted down \"too quiet\" and then over-corrected, so now everything is at an 11 all the time, hectic and needlessly overlaid with action music.\n\nAnd is it just me or did the show look more lush under Moffat as well? I don't know if they paid more attention to set design or it's because the camera lingered on the shots more, but Moffat's worlds always looked so tactile and immersive. These two episodes looked pretty flat to me.\n\n[quote]Everybody here writes like a TV critic. Everything gets dissected and evaluated. Those were the days when people just got comfortable with a snack and a drink and just enjoyed what was coming. And then they moved on. Now each and every episode needs to function as a quality standard for Perfect TV. No wonder that people are more aggravated nowadays when even an hour of Space Babie gets people out of shape.\n\nThere is a particular fandom issue with Doctor Who where many of the fans seem to actively loathe the show.\n\nBut this show is now 19 years in to its current run and the quality drop is noticable.\n\nWhat's especially irritating at the moment is those involved are taunting the viewers telling them that if they don't like the current run they're somehow backwards or not embracing the new progressive regime. No hun, it's just boring.\n\nForgot to mention another thing I really enjoyed about the premiere – the way the babies' mouths were animated! I love how far CG and AI have come that this is now possible and also doable on a TV budget. Even five years ago, an episode like this either wouldn't be made at all or random mouth movement would be passed off as dialogue, and it would look boring as hell. I noticed the same with the cat in Dead Boy Detectives and it makes me feel excited about all the future possibilities of this technology.\n\nGreen Screen: The Episode. At the beginning, when Ruby steps out of the Tardis, there's green screened Tardis behind her, which is in turn green screened onto the alien planet. It's like Disney gave them their Volume tech and told them to go nuts. Just foul looking, zero depth to anything.\n\nAnd I can't believe Moffat wrote this dreck. Why was everything constantly at an 11, like it was an RTD episode? At one point, the hysteria was so overpowering with everyone shouting over each other, I had to mute the whole thing. My god, enough action, give us some quiet dramatic moments already.\n\nInspirations behind this episode were obvious – Outlander meets Raised by Wolves meets Black Mirror.\n\n[quote] What's especially irritating at the moment is those involved are taunting the viewers telling them that if they don't like the current run they're somehow backwards or not embracing the new progressive regime. No hun, it's just boring.\n\nDisney had responded to woke Star War's critics with the same sort of arrogance so now Disney is a partner in Doctor Who it's unsurprising they would follow the same dismissive philosophy.\n\nps -- Disney stock value is down almost 50% from just three years ago\n\nThat was a decent episode, if a bit too Black Mirror-ish with its central premise. That twist at the end though, wow. Not gonna have many fans here on DL, I presume. However, it would have landed even harder without the fake tears, which were flowing almost cartoonishly in that last shot.\n\nThat pee doctor was weird.\n\nIs it just me or was Ricky September not that hot at all? His acting debut was opposite Minnie Driver in Hunky Dory, how quaint is that? Did some theatre with Ben Whishaw as well, a decade ago.\n\nThat felt like a Catherine Tate filler episode updated from the late 00s. Good enough.\n\nTom Rhys Harries is a curious looking man. When he was younger he was so skinny and twinky and very pretty and almost androgynous. He now looks like a 30 year old twink who has filled out. He's a fairly posh middle class actor who was over hyped based on his looks but has worked consistently without being especially famous.\n\nHe was good enough in Hunky Dory but was overshadowed by last week's Doctor Who guest Aneurin Barnard who had already won an Olivier when he appeared in the movie. But the teenager actor from Hunky Dory who went on to have the most prestigious career was George MacKay.\n\nFun episode. Doctor's sexy dancing to Kylie is perfect for Pride time, but I don't know how well it'll go down with the genpop.\n\nIt was interesting seeing how much simpler the costumes were compared to Bridgerton, but of course it's expensive to have period costumes just for one episode. And the costumes and the jewellery in Bridgerton are comically overdone anyway.\n\nFirst gay kiss in Doctor Who? Groff's character didn't have that much personality, he was kinda just a blank slate. Performance seemed phoned in, Groff's usually more expressive with his face. He should've played him more rugged, I think.\n\nThe issue with Dr Who is that it was always a rather silly and fantastical show for children. It was never intended to be a cornerstone of primetime mainstream culture. Like the centrality of superhero films in Hollywood, it's a sign of the continued infantilisation of popular culture. Dr Who is not serious, nor should it ever need to be: but it can't both didactic entertainment and nuanced, sophisticated drama. It has to be one or the other, and this is something that Russel T Davies has never been able to reconcile.\n\nNo wonder the series seems to be having a perpetual identity crisis.\n\nAfter three pretty decent episodes, we get this overwrought mess? The final couple of minutes were laughable, like a parody of Doctor Who. The masks and the CG looked so naff.\n\nNothing specific was ever mentioned about that software Sue was about to release to the world for free. And a tech genius at 70? Sure, that tracks. RTD's boomerism was on full display here, and painfully so. It's like the editing of the show is snappy enough (even too snappy at times), but everything else about it is dated. I think RTD is just spent, creatively.\n\nAt least we got to see the cute Colonel Ibrahim again, voguing with his insane cheekbones all over the place. And his hair isn't slathered in gel anymore, so that's nice. Though I wish he smiled more, just look at his bright homosexual smile at r123.\n\nRussell T Davies has broken his silence on the series' declining ratings, explaining that the goal was always for the long-running sci-fi drama to attract a much younger audience.\n\n\"In coming back, I wanted to make it simpler and I wanted to make it younger,\" he explained. \"Those two things are often not discussed - you read reactions to it and people are missing that. It’s simpler and younger - and it is working.\"\n\n\"The under-16s and the 16-34 audience as well is massive. It’s not doing that well in the ratings, but it is doing phenomenally well with the younger audience that we wanted.\"\n\nr303 You can fuck right off with that homophobic language about a gay showrunner on a gay message board. That sort of rhetoric was used for decades to deny us our rights, you ought to be embarrassed. I sure am embarrassed that your mother shat out someone like you.\n\nTargeting a younger audience is nothing new in showbiz because those people are the fucking future. You don't want to be like cable news where the median age is 70, that's a moribund medium. Do I think RTD is coping by cherry-picking his stats? Yes. But he's not wrong in prioritising younger audiences.\n\nWhat I don't understand with the \"BUT THE KIDS LOVE IT\" argument is why RTD would reposition Doctor Who as a kids show with constant references to things that happened in the show 45 years ago or whenever.\n\nSure it appeals to the hardcore fans but \"the kids\" are just going to ask why was a black smoke dog puppet on the top of the TARDIS?\n\nOther than that this series has been enjoyable enough. 45 minutes a week doesn't feel like a waste of time.\n\nCInemas in the UK are hosting screenings on Friday night for the finale. They'll show yesterday's episode at 11ish and then the new episode \"live\" at midnight when it drops online.\n\nI'm not sure those 8 hours of tv have been a huge success. I'm sure the old queens loved the Tom Baker and Susan clips and references to old episodes but RTD's assertion they're doing it for the kids doesn't convince me.\n\nNcuti Gatwa has been ok although his DRAMATIC SCENES are so over the top and not in a good way. Millie Gibson however has been excellent. It is hard to believe she only turned 20 this week. She's much better than the show and will go on to great things.\n\nAnd I can suspend my believe to think this evil dog thing can turn the entire population into dust but the idea that no one in Ruby's mother or father's family would spit into a tube for Ancestry.com (hi Davina!) is just too ridiculous.\n\nYeah, this wasn't very good. And I think I've finally figured out why – it's mostly the lazy execution. There is zero directorial panache to anything on the screen. Moffat could turn that mediocre writing into a spectacular finale with proper camerawork and clever editing. But everything here is flat and rushed and uninspired. The Doctor occasionally shouts out a monologue and even those don't land.\n\nGod damn it, I wanted this to succeed so much. But if the first season with RTD full of fresh energy was this mid, I imagine it's only going to get worse going forward. Sigh.\n\nAnalysis by Deadline. Dark clouds on the horizon...\n\n[quote]Those lucky enough to attend May’s Disney‘s upfronts at the North Javits Center were treated to clips, teases and appearances from some of the world’s biggest stars. But almost completely absent from the upfront festivities was Doctor Who, the iconic British sci-fi series that Disney+ now co-produces with the BBC following what was undoubtedly one of the biggest global TV show deals of the past decade. Doctor Who was handed a minor bit of real estate at the North Javits, but its lack of front-and-center placement may spin a yarn about the series’ position in the Disney priority log nearly three years on from the deal being struck.\n\n[quote]Noises that it may not last beyond its initial two seasons are already reverberating around international TV circles, and one source close to the production tells us that they feel its future hangs in the balance already."
