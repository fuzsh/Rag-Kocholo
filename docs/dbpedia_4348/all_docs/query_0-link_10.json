        "text": "Christopher Eccleston is an English actor, who, for Disney, played Raymond Calitri in the 2000 Touchstone Pictures film Gone in 60 Seconds, Malekith in the 2013 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Thor: The Dark World, and Jabez Wolffe in Young Woman and the Sea.\n\nEccleston was born in 1964 and attended Joseph Eastham High School before going Salford Tech for a two-year Performance Foundation Course and then went on to train at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Underemployed as an actor for some years after graduating from college, he took a variety of odd jobs at a supermarket, on building sites, and as an artist's model.\n\nHe soon established himself in the industry with films such as Let Him Have It, Our Friends in the North, Jude, 28 Days Later, Elizabeth, The Others, and Revengers Tragedy. He eventually became best known for his role as the Ninth Doctor in the BBC sci-fi series Doctor Who in 2005, although he only stayed for the first season due to a strained relationship with higher-ranking members of the production team, and was succeeded by David Tennant. Following Doctor Who, Eccleston went on to other television shows such Heroes, The Shadow Line, Blackout, The Leftovers, The A Word, Dodger, and True Detective.\n\nRoles[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nEccleston, along with fellow Doctor Who actors, David Tennant, Matt Smith, and Peter Capaldi, have all played a comic book villain sometime after their tenure on the series.\n\nHis characterization of The Doctor was parodied in The Muppets Take the O2 when Rizzo appeared dressed as the Ninth Doctor.\n\n[]"
