        "text": "Editorial\n\nThe library week was dominated by first the horror at the setting ablaze of Spellow Lane Library during the far-right/racist/opportunist riots and then by the hope caused by a huge local, national and international response to a fundraiser for it. Famous authors and celebrities donated large amounts of money (the largest being Â£5,000 from author Matt Haig) as did loads of library lovers and locals. The result was that, as of now, Â£239,000 has been raised compared to the initial Â£500 target.\n\nThis should give all of us hope. There is something visceral about an attack on a public library and it has given nearly a thousand people a chance to register their disgust at what went on. What will be done with the money is quite the question: the building will have insurance but this amount of money can make a difference even then. One hopes that something really positive, that helps those in the local area, comes from this.\n\nIn other news in this week’s post, I had not noticed before but there are no less than eight libraries under threat in the London borough of Enfield and another in Peterborough. Additionally, Cheshire East has reported initial success in getting local councils to help fund the libraries it has announced it did not have sufficient money for. Finally, there are a couple of criticisms of current public library culture, both suggesting a move back to focusing on reading, quiet study and education.\n\nOooh, and also there is the first ever book giveaway for this newsletter. The first five readers who email Neil Jurd OBE at neil@neiljurd.com will get sent a copy of “The Leadership Book” by Neil Jurd OBE. Gosh.\n\nChanges by local authority\n\nEnfield – Bullsmoor, Enfield Highway, Enfield Island Village, Bowes Road, Southgate, Winchmore Hill, Oakwood and John Jackson librariesÂ may close in 2025.\n\nPeterborough – Woodston Library may close\n\nNational news\n\nThe Concept, Experience and Inspiration of Bibliotherapeutic Service in British and American Public Libraries – Library Journal.\n\nGreen Libraries Week 2024 â the map – Libraries Week. “Library partners, spread the word and let people know what your library is up to for Green Libraries Week by adding your library to the map”\n\nStop-Verify-Correct: How to combat misinformation online and beyond – CILIP.\n\nWhy It’s Time for Libraries to Step Up and Help Young People – Shout Out UK. “Unfortunately, in areas such as the North East of England, libraries appear to have become hubs for computer use rather than reading. While free access to digital resources is vital, so is access to traditional print novels and a quiet place to read â something which children may not have at home.”\n\n“The Public Library system [needs to be]revised to back the education system rather than being a social centre. This was its original purpose following on from the Mechanics Institutes, the Chartists and the Luddite era. Library history shows that the Public Library has moved from a working-class to a middle-class institution in its development.Â Education, Information, Research and Recreation are still at the heart of Public Library purpose. The emphasis on these four services changes according to the times we live in. Public Libraries need to move from the current emphasis on recreation to support education and provide information for society. I see no prospect of this being implemented by CILIP, the Arts Council or the DCMS all of whom misunderstand Libraries at a fundamental level. The Library Profession has also contributed to its own downfall to which the irrelevant CILIP conference bears testimony. Furthermore, the fragmented, volunteer run and unstaffed libraries are in no position to respond to the changing social circumstances. The problems are more sociological and anthropological than political.”\n\nGlyn, received via email\n\nSpellow Lane Library\n\nBooks for Spellow Lane Library – Go Fund Me.

The violent actions of this extreme minority group illustrate the need for exactly the kind of services provided by trained staff in public libraries such as Spellow – informing citizens with a broad range of trustworthy information and helping develop literacies for the modern world. We hope the new government invests in such services and reverses 14 years of funding cuts”\n\nCity vows ‘we will not let hate win’ after riots – BBC. “Cousins Esme Mullen and Connie Brown, who live in Walton, have placed posters and drawings on the boarded-up library which read: “We will not let hate win – Walton is stronger when we stand together”. Esme told the BBC she wanted to help build the library again because she likes to read books while Connie said “we should never live in hate”. Frank Brady, who lives over the road from the library, said it was an important part of the community. He said: “It is so important that it keeps going because of the road itself.””\n\nFar-right rioters loot shops and set fire to library and food bank in shameless day of disorder – Independent.

Jonathan Reynolds visited Spellow Library in Walton, Liverpool which was set alight amid violence and disorder last Saturday.” … “A 69-year-old man, who armed himself with a wooden cosh and joined a “mob” which took part in the destruction of the library,Â was jailed on ThursdayÂ for two years and eight months.”\n\nMother thanks judge after sons jailed over library burglary during riots – Sky News. “The pair pleaded guilty to burglary with intent “to steal from the Spellow Lane Library Hub, in Walton, which was opened last year to provide support for one of the most deprived communities in the country and included a food bank.” … “She said they just got “carried away” and their behaviour was “very out of character”, adding: “We’ve never had riots before.”\n\nShameless thugs set a library and foodbank ablaze, target middle eastern cafes and set fire to looted shops as anarchy descends in flashpoints across Liverpool, Hull, Manchester and Belfast – with more violence expected today – Mail. “Shocking photos from this morning show the burnt out interior of the library, with bookshelves tipped on their side, and glass surrounding the remaining computers.Â ” [No mention of where all the anti-immigrant hate came from – Ed.]\n\nSpellow Lane Library sees hundreds of authors donate backlists after riots destruction – BookSeller. “Over 150 members of the books community â including Tracy Chevalier and Diana Beaumont â are donating backlist copies to the riot-hit Spellow Lane Library as part of crime writer Marnie Richesâ Reading Not Rioting campaign.” … “âThereâs certainly going to be tens of thousands of pounds of stock sent in.. Itâs been an enormous response,â she said. âIn tandem with the crowdfunder itâs been a good way for the bookish community to express their outrage at the rioters and sympathy with the library and its readers.âÂ “\n\nâWe are not the far-rightâ insist protesters setting fire to libraries and migrant hotels – News Thump. “As violent protests entered their third night across the UK, many of those who took to the streets have insisted that this is not a âfar-right protestâ, and any similarity to the tactics of the Nazis is purely coincidental.” … “the Nazis burned books,Â notÂ libraries. Which is very different. If you canât tell the difference, I canât help you.”\n\nInternational news\n\nPublic librariesâ role in supporting Ukrainian refugees: A focus on Hungary and Poland – Journal of Librarianship and Information Science. “The study underscores public librariesâ role in addressing community needs, rooted in their core values of inclusivity and community engagement.

But they all cost money â hence the fund-raising element of the fun day.”\n\nEditorial\n\nThe power of local public protest to cuts in public libraries never ceases to amaze me. A campaign to save libraries in Lanarkshire managed to get 8,500 signatures, which is quite amazing by the way, resulted in Cambuslang staying open and smiling pictures of local people in the newspaper. Kirklees also has a petition in the thousands but it’s less clear if there will be a happy ending there for the 47 library staff who may lose their jobs if the cuts go ahead. But if there’s no protest then such reductions certainly will go through, so it’s worth a placard or two.\n\nIn other news, it looks like the change of computer system in LibrariesWest has caused big problems, resulting in official apologies being issued. There’s pretty big investment announced in Australia, a country which appears to genuinely value their libraries. Then there’s the sad stories of cuts in Birmingham and other councils. Finally, the two articles about what to do with old Carnegie Libraries prompts some sadness. There are 660 such libraries, or were, in the UK but with closures and moves, quite a few are undergoing changes of use. But there’s hope at last for at least one in Bradford, which has been derelict for a while. Can’t see that happening in Australia.\n\nChanges by local authority\n\nRotherham – Swinton Library and Civic Hall “neighbourhood hub” opens.\n\nRutland – Â£950k to turn Oakham, Ketton, Ryhall and UppinghamÂ Libraries into “community hubs”\n\nNational news\n\n2024 Yoto Carnegies Ceremony Highlights – 2 minute video.\n\nBasic dataset for Libraries – Arts Council England.

One can be ordering books, delivering training, planning events, organising stock rotations, partnering with different organisations and be in a murder mystery all in one week. That last one stuck out to me last week as I hosted an evening using the excellent free Ann Cleeves scripts (see an example here) to a sold out audience. We do several of these per year and get excellent feedback from them, all using library staff. Back when I started even doing a rhyme-time was a controversial idea which I remember arguments doing. And, amazingly, the Summer Reading Challenge too. Heaven knows what those people that argued against those in the 1990s would think about doing murder mysteries. But we have a problem. We’ve run out of free scripts to do. So, Ann, if you’re reading, could you us another one? You’d get a free invite to the first performance and everything.\n\nThe change in government hasn’t notably affected the public library sector yet and any such changes would likely take ages anyway. Everything has inertia, not least this one. But the challenge will be to do anything at all considering that there is a commitment to keeping within a very tight budget. Indeed, even a slightly above inflation increase for public sector workers who, lest we forget, have had a significant pay decrease in terms of spending power since 2010, seems questionable. So we’re not out of the woods yet. But at least the job is fascinating. And there’s always another event to do.\n\nThanks to everyone who got in touch last week.

Cardiff Council are running a trial where trained volunteers work on shifts to deliver key library and hub services including serving customers, using the internal catalogue system and running story times for children. There are concerns that a volunteer dependent service will not be able to deliver the same service to Cardiff residents.\n\nPaid employees who have training and experience bring professionalism, knowledge and consistency to their roles. These things are essential to an effective and inclusive library and hub service. Another concern is that library and hubs will become more exclusive in terms of staffing as people from lower income backgrounds and BAME people who are more likely to come from lower income backgrounds cannot afford to volunteer. Libraries and hubs, it is suggested, will become members clubs for retired professionals. While wanting to help the service continue âin the face of budget cutsâ some volunteers themselves have said they do not want to be âjob blockersâ, that is filling what should be a paid role and so preventing younger people from getting the opportunity to join the service and so ensure its future.\n\nMore simply, residents comment that Cardiff people deserve a dependable, professional library and hub service … The most recent development in this story is this trial using âprofessionalâ volunteers, who will be expected to take part responsibility for delivering library and hub services.

The first is the Summer Reading Challenge. By far the most popular promotion that any public library normally puts on, the Challenge is aimed at those in primary school, created by the Reading Agency and voluntarily bought into, or not, by library services. The format of it has not seriously changed since its introduction a quarter of a century ago. Probably the biggest change many have noted in that time is the replacement of the shiny “gold-looking” metal medal by a more environmentally friendly wooden one. Some library services, though, have got bored with this medal, sorry, model, or can no longer afford buying into it, or feel very independent, leading to some individual council designs, ranging from sub-SRC knock-offs to some genuinely impressive examples that must have taken a considerable amount of staff time and funding. This causes a problem because the more that go it alone then the more expensive it is for everyone else due to economies of scale. And more may go it alone in response. A vicious circle. So, something that was a great example of a national promotion is quite literally in danger of losing its shine. Which would be a tragedy.\n\nSomething else that happens nationally is the CILIP Conference, which was on this week. The vast majority of those working in public libraries, including many managers, may not have been aware of this at all. The cost of attending is prohibitive – several hundred per day – so only few can attend and the sessions themselves are not recorded or shared outside of the lucky few who can attend. This is not to decry the event. Like the Summer Reading Challenge, I strongly support the idea of bringing library workers together and have been in the privileged position myself of attending more than a few. I find them very useful and it’s a great way of getting people learning about what is going on nationally (other than reading Public Libraries News of course, naturally). But there is now something demonstrably improvable, at least for the public library contingent, about a conference that now attracts only a handful from that sub-sector and has little impact other than for the tiny handful of public librarians who can attend. And I hope it is fixed.\n\nDo you agree on this, got suggestions or want to comment about something else? If so, lease email your views to me at ianlibrarian at live dot co dot uk.

With such a majority, they have five years now to do what they can before the next election and, given the volatility of the electorate, the possibility of another change in government. There are huge challenges for Labour, including a distinct lack of money and economic weakness, and promises about not increasing taxation made pre-election. This will make it very difficult for them to follow the impulse, more natural to them than the Conservatives, to send money the way of local government and libraries. But it needs to be done. Local councils are on the verge of bankruptcy and public libraries have not had significant investment since, well, the last Labour Government. Hopefully, the capacity of libraries to do all sorts of things all over the country, not least boosting literacy, at cheap prices, means that the needed investment will be made. We can hope so. And perhaps the easiest low-cost maximum-impact way to start would be to find a way of removing late fees for all public libraries. Now that would be fine.\n\nAnd then we have the problem of staff-less libraries. Back in the old days, a library was staffed by paid human beings. Since that Golden Age, increasing numbers of paid staff have been replaced by either volunteers or by technology, in terms of the ever expanding number of PIN-entry libraries. This lack of labour in libraries removes that chance of social interaction, and of unbiased expert help, that is one of the key selling points of the sector. It was done initially, mainly in other countries, as a way of expanding opening hours but, being the budget for UK libraries is what it is, is increasingly be done here to replace costly human beings. This has led to the Guardian writing an article called “The end of the librarian?” which is worth looking at. I’ve also collated information on the staff-less phenomenon here. If there’s still any human beings out there who wants to look.\n\nNational news\n\nEnd of the librarian?

Sixty years ago the Public Libraries and Museums Act of 1964 upgraded that law to made it a requirement for local authorities to provide the service.” … “In this anniversary year, it is a tragic irony that the system is now facing one of the most severe challenges in its history.” … “One solution?

You already know the impact that the Conservatives have had. What will happen is unclear. Last general election, Labour’s manifesto was full of promises for public services including a likely bonanza for public libraries but it was all kind of moot because Labour stood no chance of being elected. This time around, everyone is more certain of Labour being elected than any other time I can remember in my 53 years, but there is not a single mention of libraries in their manifesto. So it’s unlikely to be a bonanza.\n\nBut I will most definitely vote. I read somewhere that a general election is better thought of as voting for a bus and not a marriage partner. You’re not voting for someone who you completely love and want to spend the rest of your life with. You’re voting for the one that gets you nearer to your desired destination. Which is why I will be voting for the party for that will take me closer to what is desired, rather than the one which most agrees with my beliefs (which stands no chance of being elected here). Because we live in a country with the first-past-the-post system and not proportional representation. Any other vote other than the one for a party likely to win is therefore, in this harsh winner-takes-all world, a wasted vote. It may make you feel better and principled and that’s great, do what you will. But for me, 14 years of Conservative Prime Ministers has taught me pragmatism. Public libraries need a vote. And not voting, or voting for someone with no chance of getting in, is not going to help anyone. So vote to make a real difference if you can. And heaven knows, many people think we need that.\n\nPlease email any news or comments to ianlibrarian at live co uk. Thank you.
