Her performance in the series won her critical acclaim, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2002 and five Emmy Award nominations. Her early journey into acting started with studies at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art before making her film debut in the 1975 movie Rosebud. Cattrall's career spans over four decades, encompassing not only the world of film and television but also stage performances. Though she reached international fame through Sex and the City, Cattrall's earlier work in movies like Big Trouble in Little China, Mannequin, and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country established her as a versatile actress adept at both comedy and drama.

Despite the challenges and controversies she has faced, Kim Cattrall remains an icon in the entertainment industry, lauded for her pivotal role in changing the perception of women on television and beyond.\n\nRobert Smith is best known as the frontman of the influential rock band, The Cure. His iconic appearance, replete with smeared red lipstick, black eyeliner, and disheveled hair, has become emblematic of the post-punk era, and his musical contributions have cemented him as a major figure in alternative music. Born on April 21, 1959, in Blackpool, England, Smith's musical journey began at an early age. His brother Richard introduced him to the guitar when he was just six, sparking a passion that would guide the course of his life. Initially, Smith didn't intend to be a musician; he was more focused on his studies. However, in 1976, together with school friends Michael Dempsey, Laurence Tolhurst, and Porl Thompson, he formed The Easy Cure, which would later become The Cure. The band quickly gained traction, with their debut album Three Imaginary Boys receiving critical acclaim. Smith's poignant lyrics and distinctive voice became the band's signature, creating an immersive soundscape resonating with fans worldwide. Over the years, The Cure has released several albums, with noteworthy ones like Disintegration and Wish, solidifying their status as one of the most iconic bands of the 20th century. Despite numerous lineup changes, Smith remained the consistent face and creative force behind the band's enduring success. His contributions to music have been widely recognized, earning him and the band a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Beyond The Cure, Smith has also worked with other notable artists, including Siouxsie and the Banshees and Billy Corgan, further demonstrating his versatility and influence in the music industry.\n\nProfessor Sir George Grenfell-Baines OBE DL was an English architect and town planner. Born in Preston, as George Baines, his family’s humble circumstances forced him to start work at the age of fourteen. Both George and his younger brother, Richard, were prodigiously gifted mathematicians and draughtsmen. George left a secure, but limiting, job in the Lancashire County Architect’s Office to work for the prestigious private firm of Bradshaw Gass & Hope in Bolton in 1930. During the 1930s, George became aware of Modernism, particularly the work of Le Corbusier and Gropius, through the architectural press and was determined to practice it himself. He studied at Manchester University for two years from 1934. It was at this time he adopted the name George Grenfell Baines at the suggestion of fellow student Gerald Hayforthwaite. Later this was hyphenated as Grenfell-Baines: Grenfell being his mother’s maiden name. He was known to friends and colleagues as “GG”. In 1935, he was awarded the Heywood prize for the design of reinforced concrete flats."
