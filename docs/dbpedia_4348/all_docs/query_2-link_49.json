        "text": "The best TV shows of 2024 are already coming in thick and fast. We've had Baby Reindeer sending the discourse machine into overdrive, meanwhile Amazon's Fallout series has continued the trend of truly great video game adaptations, making the long wait for The Last of Us season 2 a little bit more bearable.\n\nBut there's still much more to look forward to – from more Star Wars spin-offs to long-awaited seasons like The Diplomat, Heartstopper and Squid Game, plus new gems like British crime thriller Black Doves starring none other than Kiera Knightly.\n\nWhether you're someone who likes to fill out their calendar with shows to keep a chart of or you simply need some light at the end of the tunnel to get you over the finish line of spring, here are all the best and most anticipated TV shows of 2024.\n\nTrue Detective: Night Country\n\nRelease date: 14 January\n\nAs 2023 kicked off with a bang with The Last of Us, 2024 gave us the goods early on in True Detective: Night Country, the brilliant fourth season of our premier hit-and-miss crime anthology series (by that we mean it hasn't been very good since the first McConaughey-Harrelson season blew our tiny little minds). In retrospect, the recipe was always there: Jodie Foster low-key reprising Clarice from The Silence in the Lambs, the ominous Alaskan setting, Christopher Eccleston and supreme character actor John Hawkes on the cast sheet. Its mystery unfurled like a the hand of a thawing corpsicle, with a twist ending that served up thrilling, chilling justice. You can watch True Detective: Night Country on NOW.\n\nOne Day\n\nRelease date: 8 February\n\nOne moment you're rolling your eyes, thinking “well, this is a bit cheesy” and the next your trying not to physically sob, deeply emotionally attached to fictional characters Dexter and Emma (Leo Woodall and Ambika Mod) and unable to imagine a life in which you're not following their lives. When One Day came out in February it was an instant hit, in part for shallow reasons: the good-looking cast, the wall-to-wall ‘80s and ‘90s bangers, the fact it's a will-they-won't-they romance. But the David Nicholls adaptation was more than all that, tackling themes from male loneliness to substance issues to what it feels like when you still feel directionless in your 30s and beyond. You can watch One Day on Netflix.\n\nConstellation\n\nRelease date: 24 February\n\nTV shows set in space aren't always the most riveting are they? I mean, look, once you've seen one astronaut floating about while having a crisis, you've seen them all right? Even so, Apple TV+’s sci-fi venture Constellation – starring Noomi Rapace as a mega smart astronaut who swaps bodies with herself in a parallel universe after a space trip gone wrong – will appeal to even the most sci-fi weary among us. Most of it's action takes place back down on earth and it's more of a philosophical spider web than anything else. While it's not been renewed for a second season, there's more than enough to feast on in the first, and (nearly) everything gets neatly tied up anyway. You can watch Constellation on Apple TV+.\n\n3 Body Problem\n\nRelease date: 21 March\n\nYou'd forgive David Benioff and D.B. Weiss for feeling as though they had nothing to prove after the barnstorming success of Game of Thrones, but that flop of a final season did a lot to harm their TV cred. Their follow-up 3 Body Problem, then, emerged under more scrutiny than you'd usually expect of a showrunner-pair's sophomore production, unhelped by the fact that readers of the original book broadly considered it unadaptable. Fortunately for our daring duo, the show mostly worked, not least helped by a coterie of Thrones alum on the ensemble, John Bradley, Liam Cunningham and Jonathan Pryce all putting in shifts that called back to the best of their Westerosi days. We deliberately haven't talked about the plot yet because it's a bit bonkers, defies spoiler-free explanation, and reader, you should go in blind. You can watch 3 Body Problem on Netflix.\n\nBaby Reindeer\n\nRelease date: 11 April\n\nRemember that, like, week-long period when everyone was having a bit of love-in about how good Baby Reindeer was? ‘Ah, what a nice surprise this is — a calling card for an exciting new voice in British TV, as Fleabag announced Phoebe Waller-Bridge to the world,’ we all said. And then people had to go and ruin it by being weird, tracking down the real-life woman that inspired creator Richard Gadd to write this notionally autobiographical story about a comedian stalked in London. Don't let the noise take away from it: rich, gripping, dark, eerie, staggeringly empathetic, and quite sad all-round, Baby Reindeer remains a TV debut that would be the envy of any budding dramatist. You can watch Baby Reindeer on Netflix.\n\nFallout\n\nRelease date: 12 April\n\nJust over a year after The Last of Us blew common preconceptions about the quality of video game adaptations out of the water, Fallout arrived to nuke them for good; no longer shall we presume such films and shows to be dead on arrival. With its canny combination of fidelity to the game series it serves as a sequel to, a top-of-the-class ensemble of actors new (Ella Purnell, rising star) and old (Walton Goggins reclaiming his throne as king of the character actors), sexy zombie cowboys and mutated monstrosities, Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet's post-nuclear caper cemented itself as one of the shows of the year. Fans loved it, normies did too. And when does that ever happen? You can watch Fallout on Prime Video.\n\nEric\n\nRelease date: 30 May\n\nIt's 1980s New York and Vincent (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Cassie Anderson’s (Gaby Hoffmann) son has gone missing. What follows is a twisty, turny crime thriller that dabbles in the absurd as Vincent, a puppeteer, tries to recreate a puppet from his missing son's drawings (a monster named ‘Eric’) in an attempt to lure him home (I told you it was absurd). “Eric is a dark and crazy journey into the heart of ’80s New York – and the good, bad, and ugly world of Vincent,” creator Abi Morgan (The Hour, The Iron Lady, The Split) told Netflix. With it's hyper-saturated visuals and high-calibre cast, this one's got to be good. Bring on the Cumberbatch TV renaissance. You can watch Eric on Netflix.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nRelease date: 4 June\n\nHere comes another one of those Star Wars spin-offs on Disney+, then, ready to transport us to a world beyond the stars, in a galaxy far, far away. We're yet to see whether The Acolyte will be more Andor (brilliant) or The Book of Boba Fett (peak doomscrolling background TV), but with a cast boasting the likes of Bodies Bodies Bodies's Amandla Stenberg, Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae and The Good Place's Manny Jacinto, they certainly have our attention. You can watch The Acolyte on Disney+.\n\nQueenie\n\nRelease date: 4 June\n\nAfter a messy break-up with her long-term boyfriend Tom (Jon Pointing), Queenie (Dionne Brown), a 25-year-old living in South London, “seeks comfort in all the wrong places” AKA has several ill-advised flings with men who all exist somewhere on the “not good” to “bad” spectrum. Based on the smart, funny 2019 novel by Candice Carty-Williams of the same name, Queenie essentially looks like a quarter-life crisis bottled in TV form. And, as with the upcoming Supacell and last year's Rye Lane, it's always fun to see South London depicted on screen. You can watch Queenie on Channel 4.\n\nPresumed Innocent\n\nRelease date: 14 June\n\nOur expectations are high for Presumed Innocent, as it finally managed to lure Jake Gyllenhaal to the small screen. Yep, that's right, Hollywood's premiere purveyor of weird hunk roles has never been charmed into the world of prestige TV – until now. The 8-part limited series is based off the 1987 novel of the same name, which was also adapted into a film in the 90s starring Harrison Ford. Gyllenhaal will play Rusty Sabich, a prosecutor accused of killing his colleague. The spin is that he was the one who was investigating the murder in the first place. If you can't wait until the final episode, you can find out the ending in multiple ways already. You can watch Presumed Innocent on Apple TV+.\n\nHouse of the Dragon season 2\n\nRelease date: 16 June\n\nPerhaps the most welcome surprise of 2022 was a return to form for Game of Thrones apropos of Matt Smith, Emma D'Arcy and Paddy Considine's delightful scenery chewing – the latter putting in the single most under-appreciated TV shift of the year as the waning King Viserys. (That final monologue!! Chalk it up as one of the greatest Emmy snubs of all time.) Whether they can keep it up for a second, Considine-less season is an open question, but all signs point to continued dominance on the fantasy front. You can watch House of the Dragon on Amazon Prime.\n\nSupacell\n\nRelease date: 27 June\n\nWhat at first looks like a nice, good vibes romance set in South East London quickly descends into an incredibly tense race against time in Supacell, this new time-bendy supernatural sci-fi thriller from Netflix and directed and created by Rapman. The premise goes like so: a group of people randomly develop superpowers, with no connection between them besides being Black. From the trailer, it essentially looks like a mix between 2000s series Misfits and Raine Allen-Miller's Rye Lane. In other words: pacy, twisty and bucketloads of fun. You can watch Supacell on Netflix.\n\nThe Bear season 3\n\nRelease date: 27 June\n\nA show releasing a new season at regular intervals and not making its audience wait years for its next instalment? TV is so back, baby. The Bear, which is surely one of the biggest small-screen success stories of the past decade, is heading back into production for season 3 this month with an eye on a June release date. We ended season 2 of the Chicago-based series at Carmy's restaurant's friends and family night, meaning season 3 will most likely revolve around its actual opening. Not to mention all the personal drama that goes alongside all of the chef drama, like Carmy still potentially being locked in a walk-in freezer while seemingly every relationship around him is close to crumbling. You can watch The Bear on Disney+.\n\nEmily in Paris season 4\n\nRelease date: Part 1 — 16 May, Part 2 — 13 June\n\nMaybe you love Emily in Paris. Maybe you can't stand it. Or, maybe, like the majority of people, you just love getting mad at it and will definitely fire up the fourth season when it arrives on Netflix later this summer. For those not in the know, Emily in Paris landed on our screens in October 2020 – a year in which we were all, let's be honest, watching loads of weird things. But the show – about a chirpy aspiring marketing executive from Chicago joining the team in Paris – somehow outlasted every other lockdown trend and is still, for better or worse, still with us.\n\nThe Man with 1000 Kids\n\nRelease date: 4 July\n\nBasically, there’s a guy in the Netherlands who just won’t stop donating sperm. His name is Jonathan Jacob Meijer, and they reckon he might have 1000 kids. In the world of sperm donation, for reasons including but not limited to a massively increased risk of accidental incest, that’s a big no-no. Jonathan knows that, but he keeps doing it anyway. As the series follows the families affected by this apparent Genghis Khan complex, you’ll find yourself yearning for the answer to a question so many great documentaries provoke: why, on God’s green earth, would someone do this? You can watch The Man With 1000 Kids on Netflix.\n\nSpent\n\nRelease date: 8 July\n\nLast Friday night I got an Uber without realising until it was too late that it was going to cost me thirty seven whole pounds and it kind of ruined my weekend. But at least I’ve never spent $14,000 on crystals! Spent’s protagonist Mia, played by Michelle de Swarte, has. She lands back in London with something of a thud at the tail-end of a successful modelling career in the US, and in failing to adjust to the decline in income that’s accompanied her decline in work, she’s ended up in debt. And not just pretend make-believe student debt, either. This is the real stuff. That you feel so on-side with someone who’s spent $14,000 on crystals is a testament to the strength of de Swarte’s writing and performance, which makes this series absolutely worth forking out (on your TV licence) for. You can watch Spent on BBC iPlayer.\n\nSunny\n\nRelease date: 10 July\n\nSunny isn't the first TV series about an A.I. robot with sentiency and it certainly won't be the last (why can't we get enough of humans with scary little robot friends?), but it does look like an interesting take on the tried-and-test genre. The 10-episode Apple TV+ series, which has been described as a “mystery thriller with a darkly comic bent” follows an American woman living in Kyoto, Japan “whose life is upended when her husband and son disappear in a mysterious plane crash.” As a sort of “grief gift” she's given unny, the A.I. robot in question. Together, they “uncover the dark truth of what really happened to Suzie’s family.” You can watch Sunny on Apple TV+.\n\nThe Jetty\n\nRelease Date: 15 July\n\nFeaturing Jenna Coleman in the lead role alongside I May Destroy You’s Weruche Opia and the-man-with-a-bag-of-Yorkshire-gravel-for-a-voice Ralph Ineson (that’s intended as a compliment by the way), this four-part series from the BBC follows Coleman’s Detective Ember Manning as she investigates a fire in a pretty little village in Lancashire and how it connects to a true crime podcaster and a guy in his 20s who’s in a relationship with two underage girls. One of those detective dramas where – and you won’t see this coming – the detective themselves gets wrapped up in the case. Eek! Messy!\n\nLady in the Lake\n\nRelease date: 19 July\n\nIt's always a treat when a capital ‘F’ film stars lends their talents to the small screen (see above: Presumed Innocent), so we're looking forward to Apple TV+’s Lady in the Lake starring Natalie Portman as an investigative journalist who becomes completely obsessed with two unsolved murders: that of 11-year-old Tessie Fine and a bartender named Cleo Sherwood (Moses Ingram). The film is based on a novel by Laura Lippman, which is in turn loosely based on two real-life murders in the 1960s. If this won't convince you to finally subscribe to Apple TV+, then I don't know what will.\n\nThose About to Die\n\nRelease date: 19 July\n\nIn December of last year, Iwan Rheon popped up in the lead role of the sensitive and gentle BBC TV Movie Men Up, playing the demure Meurig (or “Demeurig”, if you will), a man tentatively participating in one of the first ever trials of Viagra, in 1990s Swansea. It was a far cry from how we first came to know him, as Game of Thrones sadist-in-chief Ramsay Bolton. But perhaps Rheon had left his days of nasty antiquated violence behind him?\n\nPerhaps not. He stars as crime boss Tenax in epic sword-and-sandal drama Those About to Die, which comes out on Amazon Prime in the UK this July. Chuck in Anthony Hopkins and some brutal arena battles, and you’ve got a recipe that brings Rheon back to his big bastardy best.\n\nTime Bandits\n\nRelease Date: 24th July\n\nIt’s got to be one of the funnest-sounding professions. Bandit. Sort of a rascal, maybe breaking the rules a bit but probably not doing too much harm. What kind of bandit would you most like to be? Maybe a sea bandit – well that’s just a pirate. Or you could be a bandit of the road – one of those old-school highway robbers. That might be fun. Or, maybe, you’d like to apply your banditry to the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, and into the future? If so, that would make you a Time Bandit. And you’d be the subject of Jermaine Clement, Taika Waititi & co’s upcoming TV series based on Terry Gilliam’s 1981 fantasy adventure film of the same name. Silly funny people applying their talents to the revival of a silly funny concept. Should be good.\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader\n\nRelease date: 1 August\n\nLong-gone are the days when a series being animated meant it wasn’t taken seriously, but if you find yourself unable to shake any lingering doubts then a look at the frankly rather beautiful trailer for Batman: Caped Crusader and a reminder that J.J. Abrams is involved with this one should do the trick. Yes we've been drowning in iterations of the DC hero in recent years, but if it's good enough, it's good enough and, well… just look at the trailer. It's good enough.\n\nIndustry season 3\n\nRelease date: 11 August\n\nHoly moly did Industry season 2 end on one nuclear-grade banger of a cliffhanger or what, when [redacted for spoilers] was sacked, unceremoniously, from Pierpoint, presumably with nowhere to go and their career in the mud. Whomp whomp! We can only expect (and hope) that the third season will be as brutal, sexy and vicious as the first and second, which combined made for some of the best TV drama we've seen in ages, with the frenetic thrills of Uncut Gems and robust character work of a Sopranos, or any other heavyweight small screen classic worth its salt. We demand more Ken Leung.\n\nBad Monkey\n\nRelease date: 14 August\n\nNo, it’s not a series of monkeys being told off for various forms of misbehaviour (although that does sound great and I will be starting a GoFundMe to get that off in the ground in the very near future, watch this space and also let me know if you have access to monkeys and/or professional scolders). Instead, it’s a series where Vince Vaughan plays a detective who’s been relegated to the restaurant inspection circuit, until the discovery of a severed arm sends him after much bigger baddies than chefs ignoring hair net regulations. Creator Bill Lawrence is the guy behind Scrubs, which certainly makes this worth a more-than-cursory glance.\n\nPachinko season 2\n\nRelease date: 23 August\n\nAnd here with have another gorgeous offering from Apple TV+ that a lot of people won't have heard of (but those who have are obsessed with). The series – based on the Min Jin Lee's best-selling novel about a Korean family trying to survive through Japanese occupation, societal pressures and poverty through the years 1915 to 1989 – might sound a bit complex and cerebral, but trust me when I say this sumptuous epic, with it's sweeping strings and acclaimed cinematography, is worth the ride. The second season comes out late August, which'll give you plenty of time to cram in all eight hour-long episodes of the first.\n\nOnly Murders in the Building season 4\n\nRelease date: 27 August\n\nOver the past few years, the deliciously smart whodunnit Only Murders in the Building – starring Steve Martin, Martin Short, Selena Gomez and yes indeed Meryl Streep – has quietly become the biggest comedy on TV, with a cast so stacked it makes The White Lotus look like a low-key indie production. And guess what? It's not been cancelled! A fourth season arrives at the tail-end of summer, just in time for cosy autumn viewing.\n\nKAOS\n\nRelease date: 29th August\n\nJeff Goldblum is Zeus. Oh, what? More information? Ok… well Jeff Goldblum is Zeus in a new Netflix series by The End of the F***ing World creator Charlie Covell, where Zeus develops an obsessive paranoia about the end of his reign at the top of the mythological hierarchy, without realising that Prometheus is in fact using three unsuspecting humans to execute a crafty plot to bring about the end of his reign at the top of the mythological hierarchy. Jeff Goldblum is Zeus. C'mon!\n\nLord of the Rings: The Rings of Power season 2\n\nRelease date: 29 August\n\nLord of the Rings nerds rejoice! For not only is a reboot of films reportedly on the way (Do we need them? Does it really matter if we don't?), but a brand new season of Prime Video's The Rings of Power is also set to land this year, in August. The last season, mercifully, ended up being a crowd-pleaser (a relief considering it was apparently one of the most expensive TV shows ever made). This new season will take place in the Second Age of the Lord of the Rings universe and will depict the early adventures of returning characters like Galadriel (Morfydd Clark), Elrond (Robert Aramayo) and the rise of the Dark Lord Sauron (Charlie Vickers).\n\nSlow Horses\n\nRelease date: 4th September\n\nTerrible news for perhaps the grumpiest character on TV – Gary Oldman’s unsuccessfully-retired spook Jackson Lamb – Apple have confirmed a season 4 is in the works, out later this year. He’s going to have to do more stuff. People will probably try and kill him, and he’ll probably have to try and kill some of them back. This ‘being a spy’ thing never stops, eh? Lucky for us, we just have to watch. Go on, Gary! Get him!\n\nFrasier season 13\n\nRelease date: 20th September\n\nCheers is an excellent tv programme set entirely within a bar in Boston. You should watch it. It’s really very good indeed. So good, in fact, that in 1993, it pulled a rather late 2010s/early 2020s move and spawned a spin-off show, Frasier, which was successful enough to actually eclipse Cheers in renown. Its titular Frasier Crane was a psychiatrist who hosted his own radio show in Seattle, and it ran from 1993 until 2004 and everybody loved it very much. And then, last year, in a rather late 2010s/early 2020s move, it was announced that Frasier was coming back. Many shuddered. But upon seeing the new series, most relaxed. Kelsey Grammar’s class hadn’t faded a shade, and Only Fools and Horses legend Nicholas Lyndhurst brought a lively freshness to the latest iteration. We cautiously suggest the new series will be more of the same…\n\nHeartstopper season 3\n\nRelease date: 3 October\n\nMaybe Heartstopper is a little sickly sweet for you. Or maybe you're of the mindset that the world's bleak enough and it's heartening to watch some little angels experience queer love for the first time. If you're in the second camp then fear not, for Heartstopper season 3 is finally arriving in October. Last season ended with Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor) further solidifying their feelings for each other in a heartfelt convo in which Nick nearly told Charlie he loves him. According to series creator Alice Oseman, this new season will veer away slightly from its saccharine tone: “While Heartstopper will always celebrate the joyful and point towards hope, I’m really excited that we are allowing the tone of the show to mature alongside our beloved characters growing up. Mental health, sex, university ambitions, and more.”\n\nYellowstone season 5, part 2\n\nRelease Date: 11th November\n\nKevin Costner’s got his cowboy hat on again. Returning for what’s likely to be its final (or rather, final part of its final) season, the drama that brought the Western back to TV is sure to be worth seeing out. For the uninitiated, rural Montana’s Dutton family navigate the territorial complications of owning an enormous ranch that borders on land that’s owned by, and/or is of interest to; native americans tribes, Yellowstone national park, property developers and oil barons, among others. The politics of rural America, with a capital and a lower-case P, have been long underserved by television. Yellowstone has gone some way to redressing that. You can watch Yellowstone on Paramount +.\n\nLandman\n\nRelease date: 17 November\n\nSort of picking up where he’ll soon be leaving off with Yellowstone, Taylor Sheridan creates another world of rural American empire-making in Landman. Think modern-day Dallas. Or maybe modern-day There Will Be Blood. Or maybe… well it’s a show about oil rigs in Texas, so think about it however you’d think about that. Based on the hugely-successful Boomtown podcast, Landman looks at oil from all angles – the wealth, the desperate scramble for it, the winners and the losers. It also features the Billy Bob Thornton and the Jon Hamm, so we’re in safe, slick-black hands here one would think.\n\nThe Penguin\n\nRelease date: Autumn\n\nColin Farrell is packing himself back into the prosthetics to reinhabit his role as Gotham's greatest crime lord from 2022's The Batman. Landing on HBO's Max, the series will explore Oswald Cobblepot's rise to the echelons of the city's criminal underworld and consist of eight episodes. Not much is known about the series yet, but that's just the way the shadows of organised crime works, you know?\n\nOriginally slated for an early 2024 release, The Penguin was pushed back by the actors' strikes that hit Hollywood and put everything on ice for six months last year. A preview of Max's slate in November suggested that we'll now see The Penguin by autumn. But let's see how that bears out.\n\nDune: Prophesy\n\nRelease date: Autumn\n\nDune will be the latest sci-fi franchise to get its own TV spin-off in a series which should land this Autumn, though that's yet to be concreted, and will cover the origins of sectarian sisterhood the Bene Gesserit (funnily enough, it was originally subtitled The Sisterhood). We have no idea what it'll be about at this juncture but presume that the updated subtitle is in reference to the prophecy around Paul Atreides, portrayed by Timmy Chalamet in Denis Villeneuve's two films. But who knows?\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude\n\nRelease date: at some point in 2024\n\nIf you’re the kind of person that goes a bit mad after maybe half a day of not talking to anyone, then a cool hundred years of solitude probably sounds pretty bad. But it’s actually a multi-generational epic novel about two cousins who get married and flee the place of their upbringing to establish a utopian colony where their ancestors will live happily (but also sadly) ever after, that sold over 50 million copies and pretty much won its author the Nobel Prize for Literature, so… probably pretty good? Probably also worth a look if turned into a 16-episode series by Netflix, set to be released this autumn? Yeah? Well you’ll never guess what…\n\nBrassic season 6\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nThis is England’s Joe Gilgun has been a more than capable captain at the helm of his own show for 5 years now, and what a refreshing run it’s been. Working-class northerners are sorely under-represented on British TV, and when they’re as fun as they are on Brassic, it’s hard to understand why. Rumours recently circulated that the end could be near for the lovably laddish comedy, only for Sky to announce that season 7 had been confirmed. Long may it reign.\n\nFuturama season 12\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nMatt Groening had an enviable 2023. The Simpsons finally got some of its mojo back, and then, in a move that not many were asking for but quite a few ended up being very pleased about, Futurama made a surprise return with its 11th season. It went well – so well, in fact, that we’re now getting season 12 on Disney+ later this year. It's like it never left.\n\nRivals\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nHere’s everything we know about Disney+’s hotly-anticipated Rivals thus far: It's about the television industry in the 1980s. It stars David Tennant and Aidan Turner. It's based on a sexy Jilly Cooper novel (for those not in the know, Cooper is essentially the UK's answer to Jackie Collins). And, according to show notes, it'll bring “a 2020s lens to the 1980s, offering a raw exploration of a complicated moment in British history when class, race, sex, wealth, and sexual liberation meant that, for the very privileged few, there were no limits to what they could achieve.” Oh, and it'll be out later this year – inject it!\n\nThe Veil\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nElisabeth Moss? Peaky Blinders’ Steven Knight? An international spy thriller set in Istanbul, Paris and London? Deadly secrets and lies? Honestly, we couldn't be more excited for this tense, glossy-looking new series, in which Moss plays Imogen Salter, an MI6 agent who speaks a gazillion languages and is used to going undercover, alongside Yumna Marwan (Little Birds, Heaven Sent) as Adilah El Idrissi, the woman she's after, who's believed to be an ISIS commander. Those across the pond will be able to watch The Veil on Hulu from 30 April, but a UK release date is yet to be announced.\n\nThe Boys season 4\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nThe bloodiest (non-animated; we see you, Invincible) superhero series on air returns for its fourth season in 2024, in which we can expect Homelander to go full fascistic-homicidal-Nazi-dad mode and commit a genocide or two with his eye lasers. That's unless Butcher has anything to do about it (before he, er, kicks the bucket). The Walking Dead fans will be excited to see the introduction of that series' very own Negan, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, seen here without his signature baseball bat. Not that it'd be any use against a coterie of megalomanic killer supes, anywho.\n\nBlack Doves\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nWe simply must get a handful of spy capers each year for the world to keep spinning on its axis. It's just science. Black Doves stars Keira Knightley, Ben Whishaw and Sarah Lancashire and revolves around a secret spy who hides her identity from her new partner, only for him to get roped into the grim reality of London's underworld. At just six episodes long, this'll likely be a mini-series.\n\nThe Listeners\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nProduced by the same team that gave us Normal People, upcoming BBC drama The Listeners is centred on an English teacher called Claire (Rebecca Hall) who starts randomly noticing a low humming sound that nobody else around her can hear (and no, it’s not tinnitus). Eventually the mysterious hum begins to upset the balance of her life (well it would, wouldn’t it?), causing tension between her and her husband and daughter. But, get this, she's not the only person who can hear The Hum. There are others, many of whom believe they are “the chosen few”.\n\nNightsleeper\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nAll of the best thrillers take place on planes, trains and automobiles (Strangers on a Train! Murder on the Orient Express! Hijack!) so the BBC’s upcoming Nightsleeper is already a few points ahead in that regard. The official logline describes the series as a “real-time thriller about the hacking of a sleeper train travelling from Glasgow to London, and a government agency’s frantic efforts to intervene in the rapidly-escalating events onboard.” I didn't even realise trains could be hacked! What happens to them? Do they swerve onto entirely different destinations? Either way, expect a lot of adrenaline and people frantically running around platforms.\n\nSquid Game season 2\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe biggest show that Netflix ever released is, of course, getting a second series. How couldn't it? It's a good thing the first series, about a deadly game inflicted on the most debt-ridden people in society, ended on a cliffhanger. After taking home the massive winnings, Gi-hun has his sights set on the game masters who want nothing more than for him to keep quiet so they can keep playing their evil games. Season 2 looks set to crack the whole thing wide open, but we still have to wait some time before a release date is delivered (hopefully not through ominous playground speakers).\n\nThe Umbrella Academy season 4\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe most dysfunctional family in the universe are getting one last adventure. The fourth and final season of The Umbrella Academy, based on the Gerard Way comic book of the same name, will hit our small screens sometime this year, wrapping up a huge plot twist that shocked fans at the end of its last run. Season three ended with the enhanced siblings sans their superpowers, meaning season four will revolve either around them getting them back or trying to work out life without them. According to Netflix, this final season will also see them face a bigger and worse enemy than ever before, one that wants them out of the picture for good.\n\nThe Diplomat season 2\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe Diplomat's first season became an overnight success when it launched on Netflix last year, so it's no surprise they're raring to get its second outing out the door. At the end of season one, the titular diplomat, Kate Wyler (Keri Russell), who is on deployment in London to prevent all-out war, is left reeling from the potential death of her husband Hal (Rufus Sewell) in an explosion ordered by the Prime Minister (Rory Kinnear) who is trying to cover up his international faux pas. Clearly, we're going to start season two with a bang. The streamer has also announced that Allison Janney will make her political drama return after The West Wing by joining for season two.\n\nAgatha: Darkhold Diaries\n\nRelease date: At some point in 2024\n\nIt was Agatha all along! Well, actually, at first it was Agatha: House of Harkness, then it was Agatha: Coven of Chaos and now it's Agatha: Darkhold Diaries. The standout supporting character from the shining jewel of Marvel's TV series offerings, WandaVision, played by Katherine Hahn will be joined by Aubrey Plaza, Heartstopper's Joe Locke and theatre legend Patti LuPone for this spin-off of everyone's favourite meddling witch next door. Not much is known about what the series is about, or even when it's going to be coming out, but we can probably expect a fair amount of spooks and spells along the way.\n\n2024 releases to be confirmed:\n\nThe Night Manager season 2\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nThe world fell to its knees when the first season of The Night Manager hit our screens in 2016, introducing us to Tom Hiddleston's former military officer Jonathan Pine. Based on the John le Carré novel, it was a slick and sexy spy offering and one we thought we'd left back in the ‘10s. However, last year it was announced that the series would be coming back with Tom Hiddleston, and now it's been confirmed by Deadline that the show has been given a second and third season and that it will be kicking off filming later this year. It might be tight to get it before the year is out, but if we don't get the second outing by the end of 2024 it will likely be early 2025.\n\nWednesday season 2\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nThe moodiest girl in the world will be back for round two. Wednesday's first season broke Stranger Things season 4's viewing records at lightning speed, so it's only natural the Addams Family spin-off will be back for more. Jenna Ortega's take on the sullen sibling sees her at Nevermore Academy, a boarding school for outcasts. After fending off a literal beast in season 1, there are plenty more monstrous and familial battles in store for round two.\n\nYou season 5\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nHello, you, again (and again and again and again). You just can't get rid of Joe Goldberg – stalkers are like that, after all. Coming back with one final season, season five of You, the series about a stalker slash hopeless romantic slash murderer slash book enthusiast, will land is back where it all started in New York City. Joe is happily settled down with Kate, who knows (most of) his dirty little secrets, but homecomings always entail a few reunions. According to Netflix, a familiar face is back to haunt Joe, and with the mammoth list of victims left in his wake, the avenger could be anyone's guess. Goodbye, you.\n\nThe show was originally slated to drop in 2024, but the writers' and actors' strikes may see it pushed back to 2025. Only time will tell.\n\nAlien\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nThere's a lot of Alien to look forward to on the horizon. Not only are we getting a new film, Alien: Romulus, but a TV series as well. With so many Alien timelines all over the place, you'd be forgiven for being confused about where exactly this show is going to fit. While most details are being kept under wraps, we do know that it's set 70 years in the future, meaning it fits somewhere between the original franchise and the prequel films (Prometheus and Alien: Covenant). It will also be taking place on Earth, somewhere the Xenomorphs so far haven't been. The series is being headed up by Fargo and Legion showrunner Noah Hawley, so at least the notoriously variable-in-quality property is in good hands.\n\nHijack season 2\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nIdris Elba might just be the unluckiest passenger of all time. After successfully negotiating a hijack of a flight mid-air in season one of Hijack, it's been announced that the Apple TV+ series will be coming back for a second run. Will he have to prevent the hijacking of a bus this time? A train? A boat? Who knows! It's slightly unlikely that Hijack season 2 will hit our screens this year, but remain hopeful that this flight will arrive at its destination ahead of schedule.\n\nDoomsday Machine\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nAnother year, another deep dive into the inner machinations of our tech overlords. In Doomsday Machine, Claire Foy will star as Sheryl Sandberg, who held the position of COO of Meta (first Facebook), before stepping down in 2022. The show is based on Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang’s book An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook’s Battle for Domination, which delved into how Facebook became a key name in political and social upheaval and how its relentless pursuit of growth and impact has shaped our current cultural and geopolitical climate. The limited series will run on HBO sometime this year.\n\nThe Day of the Jackal\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nThis year's roster of spy thrillers is filling up nicely with the addition of The Day of the Jackal. Following in the footsteps of Bond and The Night Manager, the series takes inspiration from one of the most seminal pieces of spy fiction, written by Fredrick Forsyth in 1971 (which also had a famous film adaptation a couple of years later). Eddie Redmayne will star as ‘The Jackal’, a mysterious assassin hired to take down a global leader, while Lashana Lynch will play an MI5 agent tasked with taking him down. The 10-episode series will air on Sky sometime later this year.\n\nDeath by Lightning\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nThe likelihood of this one landing in our laps before the end of the year is slim, but with as stacked a cast as it has, can you blame us for trying to rush it along? Michael Shannon and Matthew Macfadyen will star respectively in Death by Lightning as early US president James Garfield and Charles Guiteau, one of his greatest supporters and who ended up being the man who killed him. Nick Offerman and GLOW star Betty Gilpin have also recently been announced in the series which will be executive produced by Game of Thrones creators (and the people behind the upcoming Netflix series 3 Body Problem) David Benioff and D.B. Weiss.\n\nFirebug\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nThe Taron Egerton x Apple TV+ relationship remains strong after his 2022 prison series Black Bird (which was tragically overlooked when it was released). He's teaming back up with the streamer for Firebug, a series loosely based on the serial arsonist John Leonard Orr. Orr was an arson investigator and fire captain thought to have set more than 2,000 fires over the decades before being arrested in 1991. Egerton will play the Orr proxy (as well as executive produce the series) while Jurnee Smollett co-stars as his rising star detective.\n\nMurderbot\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nAlexander Skarsgård has always managed to embody characters that have a rogue, sometimes sinister oddness to them, as if you don't quite know what they're thinking (Lukas in Succession, James in Infinity Pool, Eric in True Blood). To that end, his upcoming role as a self-hacking android who simply loves to spend his days watching trash TV feels tailor-made for the actor. The show in question is Murderbot, based on the book series The Murderbot Diaries by best-selling author Martha Wells. Another Apple TV+ big-budget sci-fi punt no less, so you know it's going to be good.\n\nThe Miniature Wife\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nWe will have no shortage of Matthew Macfadyen on our screen in months to come, which is a good thing for anyone still trying to fill the hole left by Succession. He'll be starring alongside Elizabeth Banks in The Miniature Wife, a dramedy about a married couple dealing with strife and power imbalances in their relationship. If that all sounds very Tom and Shiv, just wait for the high-concept twist that the title teases – the wife is shrunk. This show is literally about a miniature wife. In all seriousness, though, the series is based on the critically acclaimed short story by Manuel Gonzalez, which picked up heaps of praise when it was released in 2013.\n\nDown Cemetery Road\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nFrom the same production that gives us Slow Horses (probably your dad's favourite show) and Hijack (probably also your dad's favourite show) will come Down Cemetary Road, starring Emma Thompson and Ruth Wilson. The series, which will launch on Apple TV+, will see Wilson star as a woman obsessed with the disappearance of a young girl in the aftermath of a freak house explosion and Thompson as the private investigator she hires to figure out the truth once and for all. It will be based on a novel by Mick Herron, whose book also inspires Slow Horses (seriously, ask your dad about it).\n\nLions\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nRichard Gadd is the most buzzy man on television right now as his darkly confessional series Baby Reindeer dances around the top spot of the Netflix charts. We'll be seeing more of him in the future, with his next series, Lions, which he's also written and will star in, coming to the BBC. The six-part series will follow Niall and his estranged ‘brother’ Ruben, who reunite at a wedding. When chaos ensues, their tumultuous decades-long relationship is stirred up. The show will follow almost 40 years of their highs and lows and reflect on what it means to be a man.\n\nDear England\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nJoseph Fiennes will reprise his Olivier-nominated performance in a TV adaptation of Dear England, the play about Gareth Southgate and the England men’s football team. It may have seemed like a bit of a bonkers premise to take to the theatre, but the play was an almost immediate hit. The show, which kicked off at the National Theatre before making its West End debut last year, is a fictionalised dig into the highs and lows of the nation's biggest sport, with extensive research conducted into how the England manager navigates various struggles.\n\nThe Four Seasons\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nIf you saw everyone sharing 30 Rock clips a few months back and thought, ‘Man, I wish we had another show like that’, well, you might be in luck. The team behind 30 Rock – Tina Fey, Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield – are coming together again to reboot the 1981 film The Four Seasons for TV. If that line-up wasn't already good enough, Steve Carrell is also on board to star. The film follows three couples who vacation together every season and starred Alan Alda and Carol Burnett. There aren't many details about whether the adaptation will stick true to the original or treat the concept as a jumping-off point, and so far there aren't any other hints at casting. Let's hope the roll-a-dex of 30 Rock cameo stars is being whipped out as we speak.\n\nFind all of the most anticipated movies of 2024 here."
