        "text": "Ian David McShane (born September 29, 1942) is a British actor who portrayed Al Swearengen in HBO's Deadwood, and later reprised his role in Deadwood: The Movie. Him and Timothy Olyphant (Seth Bullock) were also listed as Executive Producers for the latter. McShane won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Television Drama and a TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama for his role on the show, and furthermore was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, a Satellite Award, a TCA and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nBiography[]\n\nMcShane was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, the only child of Irene (née Cowley; born 1921) and professional footballer Harry McShane (1920–2012). His father was Scottish, from Holytown, Lanarkshire, and his mother, who was born in England, was of Irish and English descent. McShane grew up in Davyhulme in Lancashire (now part of Greater Manchester), and attended Stretford Grammar School. After being a member of the National Youth Theatre, he studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), alongside Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt. McShane shared a flat with Hurt, whom he called his \"oldest friend in the business\", and was still a student at RADA when he appeared (along with Hurt) in his first film The Wild and the Willing (1962).[1]\n\nHe is known for his television performances, particularly the title role in the BBC series Lovejoy (1986–1994), Al Swearengen in Deadwood (2004–2006) and its 2019 film continuation, and currently portrays Mr. Wednesday in American Gods (2017–present). His film roles include Harry Brown in The Wild and the Willing (1962), Charlie Cartwright in If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium (1969), Wolfe Lissner in Villain (1971), Teddy Bass in Sexy Beast (2000), Frank Powell in Hot Rod (2007), Tai Lung in Kung Fu Panda (2008), Blackbeard in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011), and Winston in the John Wick film series (2014–2019).[1]\n\nCredits[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\n\"Deadwood\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Deep Water\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Reconnoitering the Rim\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Here Was a Man\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"The Trial of Jack McCall\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Plague\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Bullock Returns to the Camp\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Suffer the Little Children\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"No Other Sons or Daughters\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Mister Wu\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Jewel's Boot Is Made for Walking\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Sold Under Sin\" Al Swearengen\n\nSeason 2[]\n\n\"A Lie Agreed Upon: Part I\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"A Lie Agreed Upon: Part II\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"New Money\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Requiem for a Gleet\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Complications\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"Something Very Expensive\" Al Swearengen\n\n\"E.B.
