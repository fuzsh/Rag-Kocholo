        "text": "So, what's the big fascination with Dr Who?\n\nAndy May: Doctor Who appeals to a wide audience. It's the combination of exotic locations and hideous and scary monsters that are both frightening and a little silly at times. The Doctor appeals to all of us who harbour a secret desire to be heroic and provides a safe escapism where we can battle with enemies, but safe in the knowledge that we'll always win, if not always getting the girl...\n\nDo you really believe in time travel?\n\nKevin Fishwick: Time travel will happen in the future or has it already happened ? I'm always turning back the clock!\n\nHow do you feel about Star Trek fans, are they friend or foe?\n\nMike Clarke: The consensus is that they are foe and we don't really have any time (pun intended) for them!\n\nKen Moss\n\nIf you went to a fancy dress party, which Doctor Who character would you go as?\n\nKen Moss: The Eighth Doctor, Paul McGann - best costume ever.\n\nWhat's the big news in Doctor Who land at the moment then?\n\nMike Clarke: Friday 26th September 2003, what's so special about that then? Well, It's just an ordinary day right? Well not exactly, because it's a date of particular Whovian importance because that's when the BBC announced that Doctor Who was to return to our TV screens in a full 13 part series! There could a concern that it won't be taken seriously however the amount of money being spent and the wealth of talent that is involved gives no cause for concern. The best thing at this time was the new feeling of excitement and the exhilaration, over night all round the world the media sprang into life and began reporting again about Doctor Who and it seemed to me like every journalist scrambled to get the story first on who would play the part of the Ninth Doctor. The Mirror incorrectly said it would be Bill Nighy, there is nothing wrong with this choice because Bill is a well renowned actor with good credentials. Monday 22nd March 2004, yes another important date. Newly appointed executive producer, Russell T Davis had other ideas and realised his dearest wish by announcing that Salford born thespian Christopher Eccleston was to play the part. We can be rest assured that Doctor Who is indeed in safe hands once again and to quote Mr Davis \"It's going to be a magnificent, epic, entertaining journey\".\n\nMike getting rather friendly with India Fisher, the Eighth Doctor's Assistant\n\nIf you're a Dr Who fan in Lancashire what can you do to meet with fellow Who-ies?\n\nMike Clarke: The Time Meddlers are an affiliate club of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society (DWAS). Membership of the Time Meddlers is currently free (DWAS membership optional). We meet monthly, the first Wednesday of the month at The Black Horse pub on Orchard Street in Preston and the meetings start at 8pm; Activities can vary, usually focusing on discussions that revolve around everything imaginable about Doctor Who, the TV Series, audio plays and novels. We always provide a warm welcome to any one wishing to attend out meetings. There is also the chance to go on outings to venues such as the Doctor Who exhibition in Blackpool (opened last April 2004) and events and conventions featuring celebrities from the shows history. These events are an ideal place to touch base with like minded people. I have never met a nicer bunch of people since I became actively involved with the fan scene. My message to those who are convinced that these things are full of geeks in anoraks. \"You couldn't be more wrong!\" Besides this, most of our members have internet access and many fan activities takes place there. When you are on line please visit our well kept website by pointing your mouse to: http://www.prestondoctorwho.com\n\nWe have also have an excellent Doctor Who forum hosted by PNE-on line.\n\nhttp://www.pne-online.co.uk/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=51"
