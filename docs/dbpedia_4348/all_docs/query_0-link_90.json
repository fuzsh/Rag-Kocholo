        "text": "Christopher Eccleston has insisted that he has no interest in returning to Doctor Who.\n\nThe Lancashire native portrayed the ninth incarnation of The Doctor when the sci-fi series was revived in 2005, but departed after only one series. He was succeeded by David Tennant.\n\nDuring an interview on Graham Norton's BBC Radio 2 show, Eccleston expressed pride over portraying the Time Lord and admiration for Doctor Who's former executive producer Russell T. Davies.\n\n\"I heard Russell was going to do Doctor Who and I thought, 'That's quite strange',\" the actor admitted. \"When I heard he was writing it, I emailed him and said I'd like to play the part. I went after the part.\"\n\nEccleston added: \"I'd done a lot of television for adults. I actually think the most intelligent and the most difficult audience are children. They will be not patronised... I wanted to front a big series like [Doctor Who], which I felt was going to be intelligent.\"\n\nThe star went on to profess that he was drawn to the role of the time-traveling alien because of the character's belief in not judging others.\n\n\"The thing about The Doctor is, he's very inclusive. He doesn't see the alien in aliens and I loved that about him,\" he added. \"Also the fact that he's never at home. He's a Time Lord and he's always, always falling though the universe. When I thought about that, I thought I could play that.\"\n\nAfter insisting that his only intention was to do one series to \"make that show a success\", Eccleston balked at Norton's question as to whether he'd reprise the role of the Ninth Doctor for Doctor Who's 50th anniversary in 2013.\n\n\"No, I never bathe in the same river twice,\" Eccleston said.\n\nLast week, current showrunner Steven Moffat teased that John Barrowman could return as Captain Jack Harkness in a future Doctor Who episode, and John Simm later expressed openness to re-emerging as The Master.\n\nDoctor Who returns with new episode 'The Curse of the Black Spot' this Saturday on BBC One in the UK and on BBC America in the US.\n\n> Rate last weekend's episode 'Day of the Moon'\n\nListen to Christopher Eccleston discuss Doctor Who below:"
