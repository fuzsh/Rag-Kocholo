        "text": "Of course, many great films and TV shows have been set and shot in our wonderful county. But can we surprise you with a few familiar names that spent their formative years here? We’ve collected 10 famous people who you might not have known were either born or raised in Cornwall. Did we miss someone? Let us know in the comments!\n\nFlorence Cameron\n\nMost of us have noticed that David Cameron and family are rather partial to visits to Cornwall, but did you know little Florence Cameron was born at the Royal Cornwall Hospital? She was several weeks premature and was born in the county during the Camerons’ summer holiday. Her middle name is even Endellion after the Cornish village."
