Peshawari Karahis are one of a kind! Many Karahis are famous from Peshawar with different names including Namkeen Karahi, Shinwari Karahi, Namak Mandi Karahi (Namak Mandi is a famous eating place in Peshawar), and Peshawari Karahi.

4. DUM PUKHT

Dum Puht is a cooking technique in which meat and vegetables cook over a low flame, generally in dough-sealed pots. Due to the long cooking time and low flame, the contents of the dish turned out to be very succulent and full of flavor. In Peshawar, locals cook mutton with various vegetables such as whole potatoes, tomatoes, ginger, salt, and whole spices. People enjoy it on its own or with naan bread and rice. We have covered Dum Pukht’s cooking style under the Balochi Cuisine section as well.

5. LAMB CHOPS

Peshawari Lamb Chops are a delightful treat for meat lovers. These kebabs have a marination of raw papaya, ginger and garlic paste, ground chili, fennel, and yogurt. The lamb chops rest for 8-10 hours or overnight so that they are tender and absorb all the spices thoroughly. They are cooked in a tandoor oven (clay oven) for a remarkable grilled taste. Yogurt chutney and naan bread make great accompaniments to the chops.

6. NAMKEEN TIKKA

Namkeen Tikka, Namkeen Boti, Shinwari Tikka, whatever you call it, it’s a classic tikka dish from the regions of KPK. Tikka is meat pieces with only salt marination. The cooking process involves searing them over charcoal after securing them on skewers. They are mostly presented with yogurt chutney and fresh garden salad. Namkeen Boti is a popular desi food among Pakistanis and is available everywhere. Every bite is heavenly and you must try Namkeen Tikka if you still haven’t.
