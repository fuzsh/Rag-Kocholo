        "text": "This section has safety advice for regions of Pakistan. It only covers regions where The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.\n\nYou should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa Province\n\nFCDO advises against all travel to these districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province:\n\nBajaur\n\nBannu\n\nBuner\n\nChārsadda\n\nDera Ismail Khan\n\nKhyber\n\nKohat\n\nKurram\n\nLakki Marwat\n\nLower Dir\n\nMohmand\n\nOrakzai\n\nPeshawar, including the city of Peshawar\n\nSwat\n\nTank\n\nNorth Waziristan\n\nUpper South Waziristan\n\nLower South Waziristan\n\nFCDO advises against all but essential travel to:\n\nArandu town\n\nthe road between Mirkhani and Arandu\n\nFCDO advises against all travel to much of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province because of military or militant activity in many of the districts. There is frequent militant violence in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Local curfews could be imposed at short notice. There can be cross-border attacks in the surrounding areas of Arandu to the south and west of Chitral.\n\nN45 Highway between Mardan and Chitral\n\nFCDO advises against all travel on the N45 Highway, from the north of the Mardan ring road, to the edge of the city of Chitral because of terrorism incidents.\n\nBalochistan Province\n\nFCDO advises against all travel to Balochistan Province, except the southern coast of Balochistan.\n\nThe situation at the Pakistan-Iran border can be extremely tense. In January both Iran and Pakistan conducted missile and drone strikes targeting militant groups on either side of the border.\n\nFCDO advises against all but essential travel to the southern coast of Balochistan. That is:\n\nthe area south of (and including) the N10 motorway\n\nthe section of the N25 from the N10/N25 intersection to the Balochistan-Sindh border, including the port city of Gwadar\n\nThere is a high risk from kidnapping and militant activity in much of Balochistan. If you plan to visit the southern coast of Balochistan, get permission from the authorities and have security arrangements in place.\n\nPakistan-administered Kashmir\n\nFCDO advises against all travel to within 10 miles of the India-Pakistan border area within Pakistan-administered Kashmir, known as the Line of Control.\n\nThere is regular military activity on the Line of Control. Although there is a ceasefire in place, there are significant tensions between India and Pakistan. There is a serious risk of small arms fire and occasional mortar fire.\n\nMake sure you have the necessary permissions to travel. Check the latest requirements before you travel as they can change.\n\nSindh province\n\nFCDO advises against all but essential travel to all areas of Sindh province north of and including the city of Nawabshah.\n\nThere are high levels of lawlessness in the north of Sindh province. There is a very high risk of crime and kidnapping. Criminal gangs and bandits with access to heavy weaponry are active in the area. In 2022, a large criminal gang attacked police in Ghotki, northern Sindh, killing several officers and taking other officers hostage.\n\nGilgit-Baltistan region\n\nFlight schedules schedules to Gilgit and Skardu Airports in the North of Pakistan may be unreliable and may change at short notice. You should consult your airline or travel agent.\n\nRoad routes are also likely to be restricted by seasonal weather, with the Babusar Pass liable to close due to snowfall.\n\nThe terrain in Gilgit-Baltistan is mountainous, with remote and isolated locations that are difficult to police. You are strongly advised to get local security advice and make appropriate personal security arrangements before you visit.\n\nAll foreign nationals must register with the local authorities when visiting Gilgit-Baltistan. You might need a permit for mountaineering or trekking, in particular for mountains over 6,000 metres. The permission process can take up to 2 months and is best organised through a travel company. The validity of your travel insurance policy may be affected if you do not have the correct permits.\n\nUse reputable trekking agencies, stay on established routes, and always walk in groups. Do not trek alone.\n\nKarakoram Highway (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan)\n\nThe Karakoram Highway runs from Hasan Abdal in north Punjab towards Gilgit and the Chinese border. FCDO advises against all travel on the Highway between Mansehra and Chilas via Battagram, Besham City, Dasu and Sazin up to the junction with the N15.\n\nAvoid travelling on the Highway at night, as the road can be narrow with steep drops. All sections of the Highway north of Battagram up to the Chinese border have experienced landslides.\n\nIslamabad\n\nPolice and security agencies have a significant presence in Islamabad. Exercise caution in the outlying districts, such as I-8, I-9, I-10 and areas further west, where security forces have led operations against suspected criminals and terrorists.\n\nAvoid all protests. Crowded areas such as the Red Mosque (Lal Masjid) and Aabpara Market in G-6 have been a focal point for protests.\n\nKarachi\n\nLevels of violence can vary but there has been a recent increase in armed robbery. The safety of daily activity can be unpredictable. Criminal and political violence is common, including armed carjacking, robbery, kidnap and murder. Strikes called by religious and political parties can cause significant disruption and sometimes lead to violent civil unrest. Smaller-scale labour strikes are also common and cause regular disruptions locally.\n\nThere is a risk of violence in parts of the city which include government offices. Major hotels and the financial district are generally seen as more stable, though there remains a risk of violence, particularly after Friday prayers.\n\nYou should:\n\nplan any travel in the city carefully\n\ntake advice from hosts or trusted contacts, follow instructions from law enforcement officers and be prepared to cancel or cut back your plans\n\nbe especially vigilant in Lyari, Malir, Quaidabad and Orangi Town – they have a greater risk of violence based on past activity\n\nThere’s a high threat of terrorism throughout Pakistan, including Karachi. Attacks in Karachi have included:\n\nFebruary 2023 – militants attacked a police station in the city killing police officers\n\n2022 – a suicide bomb at the University of Karachi targeted Chinese nationals and killed 4 people\n\npublic service and health officials have been attacked while working on health programmes\n\nLahore\n\nLahore is the capital of Punjab and attracts large numbers of tourists and business travellers. While the city has a widespread police presence, there have been recent terrorist attacks. These have targeted public places and government or security forces. Avoid religious events or gatherings, public events and large crowds of people.\n\nPunjab\n\nIf you travel to southern Punjab take advice about the local security situation in advance. There is a high level of crime and public order incidents.\n\nBorder areas\n\nExcept for official border crossing points, foreigners are not allowed to travel within certain distances of Pakistan’s international borders. This includes:\n\ntravel to within 5 miles of Pakistan’s border with India and within 10 miles of the Line of Control\n\n10 miles of the border with China\n\n10 miles of the border with Afghanistan\n\nIf you travel to these areas you may be arrested and detained."
