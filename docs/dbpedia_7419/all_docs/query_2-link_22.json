        "text": "Safety and security\n\nThe Government of Canada may not be in a position to provide consular assistance to Canadians in areas where:\n\nthere are serious security concerns\n\nthe Government of Pakistan prohibits entry\n\nadvance permission is required for entry\n\nSecurity situation and elections\n\nThere have been ongoing political demonstrations since November 2022. Federal elections took place on February 8, 2024.\n\nSecurity forces continue to be on high alert in the following cities:\n\nIslamabad\n\nRawalpindi\n\nLahore\n\nKarachi\n\nThe security situation is evolving and remains unpredictable.\n\nCommunication networks may be disrupted\n\nRoadblocks could lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation, including transit routes to airports\n\nIf you are in Pakistan:\n\navoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place\n\nalways be aware of your surroundings when in public places\n\ncarry photo identification at all times\n\nexpect an increased presence of security forces\n\nbe prepared to change your travel plans on short notice\n\nmonitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation\n\nfollow the instructions of local authorities, including curfew orders\n\nBorder area with India\n\nThe level of tension between Pakistan and India is susceptible to sudden changes. You could experience difficulties when travelling between the two countries and may be subject to scrutiny if officials from either country become aware that you have recently travelled to the other.\n\nThe security situation in the Kashmir region, especially along the Line of Control (LoC), which separates India-administered Kashmir in the south from Pakistan-administered Kashmir in the north, and along the working boundary that continues south toward Sialkot, remains volatile. Since September 2016, cross-border gunfire and shelling have been occurring sporadically along the LoC.\n\nAlthough the Wagah border crossing linking Lahore, Pakistan, to Amritsar, India, is regularly used by international travellers, it remains vulnerable to attack. Security measures are in place. Visitors may experience long delays.\n\nBorder areas with Afghanistan, China and Iran\n\nBorder areas with Afghanistan, China and Iran often experience terrorist activity, smuggling and violence. With the exception of official border crossings, foreigners are prohibited from travelling within 50 kilometres of the border with Afghanistan.\n\nBandits in border areas with Afghanistan and Iran are usually involved in drug trafficking.\n\nSistan-Baluchistan in Iran, which borders Pakistan, is regularly affected by ethnic conflicts and is also a known route for smugglers. Foreign nationals have been the target of kidnappings.\n\nTerrorist attacks may also occur in this province.\n\nIf you decide to travel overland to Iran and Afghanistan despite this warning:\n\ntravel only on main roads\n\ntravel in organized groups\n\navoid travel after dark\n\nBalochistan\n\nThe security situation in the province of Balochistan remains unstable, due to a long-standing nationalist insurgency and government counter-insurgency operations. Insurgents and militants may target commercial spaces and foreigners, in particular those associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Attacks on police and security forces occur frequently. Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, is also a known route for smugglers.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa Province\n\nThe security situation in Central and Western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province, including its capital Peshawar is unstable due to terrorism, sectarian and political violence and high levels of crime. North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and the Khyber District are particularly volatile and continue to be impacted by the security situation in Afghanistan. Attacks on security and military forces occur frequently. Civil unrest also takes place regularly.\n\nKarachi\n\nCertain sectors of Karachi experience high levels of violence. These include:\n\nLyari\n\nMalir\n\nQuaidabad\n\nOrangi Town\n\nExtremist groups are present in some parts of the city and there have been terrorist attacks in recent years on high-profile targets, including the Stock Exchange and Chinese Consulate. Carefully plan any travel to, or in the city. Strikes and protest marches tend to take place in central areas of Karachi. These events may cause travel disruptions throughout the city and lead to violent civil unrest. Other criminal activities and violence that can occur in Karachi include carjacking, armed robbery, kidnapping and murder.\n\nGilgit-Baltistan\n\nClashes between protesters and security forces have occurred. Past demonstrations have led to traffic and public transport disruptions. Do not travel by road to Gilgit-Baltistan province.\n\nChitral\n\nMany parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province are unstable due to terrorism, violence, and crime rates, including Upper and Lower Chitral districts. Do not travel by road to this area.\n\nTerrorism\n\nIncreased terrorist threat\n\nOn May 7, 2024, the U.S. Consulate General in Karachi issued the following security alert: \"The U.S. Consulate General Karachi is aware of a threat of a terrorist attack at Karachi Port. In response to such situations, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates sometimes restrict access to certain areas for official U.S. government personnel. Karachi Port is temporarily restricted for official U.S. government personnel.\"\n\nIf you are in Karachi:\n\navoid the port and the surrounding area\n\nalways be aware of your surroundings when in public places\n\nmonitor local media for the latest information\n\nSecurity alert – United States Consulate General in Karachi\n\nThere is a high threat of terrorism in Pakistan. The security situation is fragile and unpredictable. Several terrorist groups are present and operate across the country. Incidents are typically attributed to extremism, ethnic divisions, sectarian strife, regional political disputes and the situation in neighbouring Afghanistan. Bombings, shootings and other terrorist attacks have been directed at a wide range of targets and have caused many deaths and injuries.\n\nIn the formerly Federal Administered Tribal Area (FATA) and in the province of Balochistan, attacks are frequent and are often directed at security and military forces.\n\nFurther attacks are likely. Attacks can take many forms, including:\n\ntargeted killings and kidnappings\n\narmed assaults\n\nsuicide bombings\n\nimprovised explosive devices\n\nSome attacks involve detailed planning to maximize casualties through multiple and consecutive explosions. Targets could include:\n\nsects or minority groups\n\ngovernment and military assets and personnel\n\nplaces of worship\n\nairports and other transportation hubs and networks\n\npublic areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners\n\nelections-related events and polling stations\n\ncivil aviation facilities, including aircrafts\n\nThere is an increased risk of attack during religious holidays and days of national significance, such as:\n\nNational Day (March 23)\n\nIndependence Day (August 14)\n\nthe Islamic month of Muharram (particularly on the day of Ashura)\n\nthe Muslim holidays of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha\n\nExpect heightened security measures and associated disruptions during these periods.\n\nIslamabad\n\nIn Islamabad, you should:\n\nkeep a low profile, particularly in areas regularly frequented by foreigners\n\navoid the Lal Masjid Mosque (also known as the Red Mosque)\n\nbe particularly cautious in or around western-style restaurants and shopping centres\n\nonly stay in hotels that have stringent security measures in place, including metal detectors and closed security perimeters\n\nMilitary activity\n\nStay away from areas where military or militant activity is taking place.\n\nCrime\n\nKidnapping\n\nThe risk of kidnapping for ransom is high, especially in Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh. Pakistani citizens are particularly at risk. Express kidnapping also takes place.\n\nUse varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when moving from one place to another\n\nMaintain a high level of vigilance at all times\n\nPetty crime\n\nPetty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Cell phones, credit cards and passports are favourite targets. Credit card fraud is common.\n\nEnsure that your personal belongings, passports other travel documents are secure at all times\n\nAvoid showing signs of affluence\n\nIf travelling by car, keep valuable belongings out of sight, windows closed and doors locked\n\nAvoid travelling after dusk, particularly in rural areas where road conditions are unsafe\n\nMake arrangements to be met at the airport, especially if arriving after dark\n\nVerify flight and airport operation details before travelling\n\nRemain aware of the security situation on routes to and from airports\n\nDemonstrations and civil unrest\n\nDemonstrations take place regularly. Demonstrations can take place without warning, and some may take on an anti-western tone. They have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Deaths, injuries and widespread violence have occurred at such events. Demonstrations can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.\n\nAvoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nMonitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations\n\nMass gatherings (large-scale events)\n\nWomen's safety\n\nWomen travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Gender-based violence is common in Pakistan. Honour killings and forced marriages are frequently reported.\n\nIf you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to the nearest Government of Canada office.\n\nAvoid travelling alone, especially at night\n\nRemain particularly vigilant in less-frequented areas\n\nBe careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances\n\nAdvice for women travellers\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics. Human rights organizations have reported discrimination and violence being committed against 2SLGBTQI+ persons in Pakistan, including the denial of basic rights and services, sexual violence and murder. Many hotels and similar establishments may only allow “married couples” to stay together, and same-sex couples should be prepared to stay separately while travelling.\n\nForced marriages\n\nForced marriage affecting foreigners occurs. It sometimes occurs without the affected person's prior knowledge or consent.\n\nSome Canadians have been forced into marital arrangements and have been detained against their will. They have been subjected to threats, intimidation and violence by family members.\n\nIf you're in Canada\n\nIf you're in Canada and you believe that you're being forced to travel overseas or to marry, you should call your local police for assistance.\n\nIf you're in Pakistan\n\nIf you're in Pakistan and you believe that you're being forced to marry, contact the High Commission of Canada to Pakistan in Islamabad. You may also contact the Emergency Watch and Response Centre.\n\nFamily members may retain passports to prevent victims from returning to Canada.\n\nKeep digital or physical copies of your travel documents in a safe place\n\nGeneral information and advice about forced marriage\n\nFraud\n\nBusiness deals can involve extortion and corruption. All business disputes, including those involving criminality, are subject to Pakistani legal proceedings. The High Commission of Canada cannot intervene on a Canadian's behalf in a private legal matter.\n\nOverseas fraud\n\nTrekking and climbing\n\nNo trekking is allowed in the closed zones located near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and near the Line of Control between Pakistan- and India-administered Kashmir. Trekking permits are required by the Government of Pakistan for peaks over 6000m, and in most national parks. Access to roads are limited, and often in very poor condition.\n\nOnly experienced climbers should go to the northern mountains of the Himalayas, Hindukush or Karakoram. Because of their great height, the Karakoram Mountains experience heavy glaciation, particularly on the southern, more humid slopes.\n\nIf you intend on engaging in trekking activities:\n\nnever do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company\n\nbuy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation from remote areas\n\nconfirm that the air ambulance firm contracted has a local agent in Pakistan who can ensure that local rescue teams provide the required emergency services\n\nensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity\n\nensure that you're properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard\n\ninform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp\n\nknow the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal\n\nobtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and don't venture off marked trails or slopes\n\nIn case of air evacuation, advance payment of the total evacuation cost is required from the insurance company before rescue teams will perform rescue operations. The Government of Canada is unable to intervene, provide, or pay for rescue services.\n\nRoad travel\n\nRoad conditions\n\nIn many urban areas, roads may be narrow, crowded and poorly lit, with limited signage and poor maintenance. Outside major highways and main cities, roads are mostly unpaved and four-wheel drive vehicles may be necessary.\n\nMountain roads may have steep drops and lack safety barriers.\n\nWeather conditions can change quickly, particularly during winter. Snow, ice, fog, rain can lead to dangerous driving conditions and disrupt travel. Landslides caused by heavy rain can block or wash away roads.\n\nCheck local news and weather reports along your route before you travel\n\nDriving habits\n\nDrivers can be aggressive and reckless, and they do not respect traffic laws. Accidents are common. If an accident occurs and you feel that your safety is threatened, leave the area and report the accident to the nearest police station.\n\nCheckpoints may be set up without warning.\n\nKarakoram highway/Northern region\n\nSections can be very narrow with precipitous drops and are sometimes partially obstructed by rock and earth slides.\n\nTravel on mountain roads only during daylight hours\n\nConsult local authorities regarding road openings, particularly during the monsoon rains and winter seasons\n\nAvoid the section of the Karakoram Highway from Mansehra to Chilas\n\nIf you chose to drive in Pakistan:\n\navoid driving after dark\n\nkeep doors locked and windows up at all times\n\nleave a travel itinerary with a third party\n\ncarry photo identification to present at police checkpoints\n\nbe well prepared and equipped with gasoline, water, food and a cell phone\n\ncall the police if involved in an accident\n\nPublic transportation\n\nThere are frequent rail accidents due to low safety and maintenance standards. Railways have been targets for riots and terrorist attacks.\n\nAvoid using public transportation including taxis and trains. If you must use public transportation:\n\nuse bus lines that provide two drivers if you're travelling long distances\n\nuse radio-controlled taxis from reputable companies\n\nconsider using taxi hailing apps in major cities\n\nAir travel\n\nWe do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.\n\nInformation about foreign domestic airlines\n\nEntry and exit requirements\n\nEvery country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.\n\nWe have obtained the information on this page from the Pakistani authorities. It can, however, change at any time.\n\nVerify this information with the Foreign Representatives in Canada.\n\nPassport\n\nEntry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.\n\nBefore you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.\n\nRegular Canadian passport\n\nYour passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave Pakistan.\n\nPassport for official travel\n\nDifferent entry rules may apply.\n\nOfficial travel\n\nPassport with “X” gender identifier\n\nWhile the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries.

Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nJapanese encephalitis\n\nJapanese encephalitis is a viral infection that can cause swelling of the brain. It is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Risk is very low for most travellers. Travellers at relatively higher risk may want to consider vaccination for JE prior to travelling.\n\nTravellers are at higher risk if they will be:\n\ntravelling long term (e.g. more than 30 days)\n\nmaking multiple trips to endemic areas\n\nstaying for extended periods in rural areas\n\nvisiting an area suffering a JE outbreak\n\nengaging in activities involving high contact with mosquitos (e.g., entomologists)\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Travellers going to countries in South Asia should speak to a health care professional about getting vaccinated.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.\n\nMalaria is a risk to travellers to this destination.\n\nAntimalarial medication is recommended for most travellers to this destination and should be taken as recommended. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:\n\nCover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.\n\nExclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.\n\nUse insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.\n\nWear permethrin-treated clothing.\n\nIf you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is no risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of vaccination is required if you are coming from or have transited through an airport of a countrywhere yellow fever occurs.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is not recommended.\n\nDiscuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.\n\nContact a designated Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nPolio – WHO Temporary Recommendations\n\nPolio (poliomyelitis) is an infectious disease that can be prevented by vaccination. It is caused by poliovirus type 1, 2 or 3. Wild poliovirus (WPV1) and/or circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV1 or cVDPV3)) is/are present in this destination.\n\nThis destination is subject to Temporary Recommendations under the World Health Organization’s polio Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\n\nPolio is spread from person to person and through contaminated food and water. Infection with the polio virus can cause paralysis and death in individuals of any age who are not immune.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nBe sure that your polio vaccinations are up to date before travelling. Polio is part of the routine vaccine schedule for children in Canada.\n\nOne booster dose of the polio vaccine is recommended as an adult.\n\nMake sure that the polio vaccinations are documented on the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. This is the only document accepted as proof of vaccination. It is provided at Yellow Fever Vaccination Centres.\n\nCarry the certificate as proof of vaccination.\n\nProof of vaccination:\n\nTravellers who are visiting for longer than 4 weeks may be required to receive a dose of polio vaccine 1 to 12 months before they leave this destination. This may be required even if you have previously received all the recommended polio vaccine doses as part of the routine vaccine schedule in Canada.\n\nMake sure that the polio vaccination is documented on the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis.\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated.\n\nAvoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs.\n\nCholera\n\nRisk\n\nCholera is a risk in parts of this country. Most travellers are at very low risk.\n\nTo protect against cholera, all travellers should practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nTravellers at higher risk of getting cholera include those:\n\nvisiting, working or living in areas with limited access to safe food, water and proper sanitation\n\nvisiting areas where outbreaks are occurring\n\nVaccination may be recommended for high-risk travellers, and should be discussed with a health care professional.\n\nTravellers' diarrhea\n\nTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nRisk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nThe most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids).
