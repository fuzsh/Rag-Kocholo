        "text": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan – Land of the Valiant Pashtuns is bounded by Afghanistan to the west and north, Azad Kashmir and the Northern Areas (the Pakistani-administered areas of the Kashmir region) to the east and northeast, Punjab province to the southeast, and Baluchistan province to the southwest. Sloping down from the breath-taking beauty of the Hindu Kush to the sun-baked plains of the Derajat, the province is located at the continental-continental collisional boundary that had resulted in an endless treat of mineral resources. The province is blessed with almost all varieties of mineral resources that include but are not restricted to exploration and exploitation of precious base metals, metallic and non-metallic minerals, dimension stones, precious and semi-precious gemstones and varieties of minerals having potential value and worth in the construction industry.\n\nThe government is keen to ensure the provision of equitable opportunities and an enabling business environment for both local, international and foreign direct investments. At the heart of such initiatives, the Minerals Development Department (MDD) is playing a commendable role by introducing a simplification of procedures and the introduction of technology by deploying a Mining Cadastre Portal to bring investors one step closer to the mineral resources of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nThe Mining Cadastre Portal provides an e-Government platform for all stakeholders in the mineral sector to engage directly with the MDD. The aim of the Portal is to ensure international standards of transparency with an emphasis on improving the ease of doing business in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nThe Portal is open for registrations for existing mineral title holders who will have a period to verify and validate their individual mineral titles. Once verified, registered users will be able to view their portfolios and provide feedback on title data. Online applications and other portfolio management functionality will commence after the inauguration of the system.\n\nRegistrations\n\nClick on the ‘Registration’ link to register on the Portal. You will be required to submit your particulars with supporting documents. An email will be sent to verify your email address, but your account will be restricted until it has been authorised by a MDD representative."
