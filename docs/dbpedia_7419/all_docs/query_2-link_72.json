        "text": "Whether it is a traditional dish close to your ethnic roots, or a delightful home-made take on your favourite fast food, we all recognize that a grandmother's affection is best expressed through her culinary creations.\n\nMore than the recipe itself, a grandmother’s home-cooked meal has an entire set of nostalgic, loving emotions tied to it, which cannot be replicated anywhere else.\n\nPakistani grandmothers are renowned for their fantastic cooking, - an ability they seem to be born with - something every Pakistani grandchild will swear by. What sets a Pakistani grandmother apart from the rest of the world’s culinary expertise.\n\nMrs Azra Syed held a prominent place in Pakistan’s culinary history, becoming one of the first chefs in Pakistan who learnt to cook foods from all over the world as well as successfully preserving and passing on her pre-partition recipes from her mother after she settled in Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nWith appearances on various platforms and on television channels such as ARY Zauq and was featured in many publications including DAWN and The News, Azra Syed set many culinary trends in Pakistan in her time.\n\nAzra had an illustrious career full of awards and plaques of recognition. She had earned national acclaim and been invited as a judge and demonstrator on shows and for several clubs such as the Karachi Gymkhana, Memon Foundation Club and the Horticulture Club.\n\nAzra always listened to her students’ requests and strived to create easy and simple recipes, and continued to give cooking classes till she was able, thus securing her a place as a caretaker of genuine Pakistani cuisine.\n\nOver the years Azra had taught and inspired a generation of young chefs such as Naheed Ansari, Sarah Riaz and Shirin Anwar, thus ensuring that the culinary heritage of Pakistan is not forgotten.\n\nMore than just a skilled chef, Azra touched the lives of those around her with grace and the beauty of life.\n\nKnown as the \"national dish of Pakistan\", the word 'nihari' is derived from the Arabic word “nahaar” (morning), implying that this dish was meant to be eaten as the first meal of the day. Learn more.\n\nThis dish evokes the spirit of Balochistan, a province in southwestern Pakistan. The process of cooking meat is elaborate and requires an intense fire. Learn more.\n\nThis dish's history dates back to the 10th century. Today recipes vary from region to region, consisting of wheat, rice, whole pulses, meat, and spices. Learn more.\n\nMustard, locally known as 'sarson', is one of the easiest crops to grow in Pakistan during the winter and early spring. From the crop, mustard greens are harvested and used to cook this dish. Learn more.\n\nAlthough mutton is produced in smaller quantities in Pakistan, in Multan and the Punjab region, it remains the most popular choice of meat by far. It is cooked into chops, known as 'chaamp'. Learn more.\n\nLocal produce, cultural practices, weather and topography all influence Pakistan's eating habits to a great extent. It is a country divided into four provinces, each boasting distinct regional cuisines and specialities.\n\nBeginning with the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the consumption of meat stands out as a prevalent culinary tradition in the region.\n\nDue to the colder climate, in the mountainous northern regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, people make heartier food with fattier cuts of meat such as dumba to stay warm.\n\nIn Sindh, the province located in the south, the culinary scene takes on a delightful turn as an abundance of fresh and readily available seafood graces the bustling city of Karachi.\n\nThen come the desert areas of Sindh, such as Thar, where seasonal produce during the short monsoon months is pickled and preserved, focusing more on a vegetarian diet as Hindu and Muslim communities co-exist in harmony.\n\nThe province of Punjab has fertile ground, making it ideal for agriculture and livestock, subsequently making dairy products and a mix of vegetables, meat, wheat and rice a routine part of local eating habits.\n\nBalochistan is an extensive plateau of rough terrain divided into basins by ranges of sufficient heights and ruggedness. It has the world's largest deep sea port\n\nIn Balochistan, dates, wild fruits and vegetables are part of the routine diet staples. In the coastal areas, the most commonly consumed dishes are fish-based. And in the Northern region, it is replaced by vegetables or chicken.\n\nThe similarities of each region lie in the meal structure: three meals are consumed daily throughout most of the year.\n\nThe use of various spices and herbs also differs from region to region, with the northern areas consuming simpler and less spicy food, but as one travels south, food becomes spicier and richer.\n\nThe population of the city increased manifold due to the influx of Muslim immigrants who traveled to the erstwhile capital city after Pakistan became an independent country in 1947. Although the state capital is now Islamabad, Karachi remains Pakistan’s largest city and retains its importance as a business and economic hub.\n\nAromatic herbs, fragrant spices, subtle and sharp flavors; a variety of sweet, spicy, savory and everything in between is available in abundance throughout the city.\n\nAlong with different traditions and languages also came a vast array of cuisines from all over the subcontinent; a melting pot of recipes and flavors shared with love and joy.\n\nIn fact, if travelers wish to familiarize themselves with Karachi, the best way to do it is to trust your taste buds and eat your way through the city, fortified with a strong constituency and a sheer passion for food. From street food to fine dining, Karachi has something for everyone.\n\nThe people of Lahore represent the culture of this old city, welcoming weary travelers with open arms, hot cups of tea, delicious food and delightful conversations. A city as large and old as Lahore is bound to have a strong bond with food, especially traditional, ethnic cuisine.\n\nThrough the winding narrow lanes of the Old Walled City of Lahore, there are distinctly discernable aromas of various food items being cooked, baked and fried.\n\nThe sweet and savory scents of sweet meats and fried samosas and jalebis waft through the air depending on the time of day and the weather.\n\nLahore truly has a little bit of something for everyone, and there is no wondering why this historic city is so beloved by all who visit.\n\nThis of course translates into a assortment of all sorts of cuisines, which differ depending on the area. Within the walls of the androon sheher (inner city) where strong influences of ancient Multan can be found, ingredients are locally sourced and third-generation shop owners occupy their spaces, cooking delicious ethnic recipes passed down from their forefathers. While the most famous food items recognized from Multan are lamb chops or chaamp...\n\nPictured: doli roti is a Multan special.\n\nWith agriculture being a huge part of Multan seasonal fruit such as mangoes and guavas are also incorporated into daily life, with street cart vendors serving raw mango known as kairi and fresh, green guavas with their own spice mix blend.\n\nEven though the people of Thar live off the land with limited resources, relying on their livestock and the crops during the rainfall season from August to October, it is this very scarcity that helps them to create innovative, delicious and hearty meals entirely from locally sourced organic ingredients.\n\nA trip to Pakistan is incomplete without visiting this peaceful and indigenous region.\n\nThis market is a hub for all things associated with Multani culture and local traditions. The bazaar is located in the heart of the old city, where traditional hand embroidered and block-printed fabrics take center stage.
