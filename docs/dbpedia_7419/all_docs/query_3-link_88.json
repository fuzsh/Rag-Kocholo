Many foreigners and travel enthusiasts are now looking to visit Pakistan, which has recently been listed as the top tourist destination in the world for 2020 by an international travel magazine, Conde Nast. Also, Forbes has declared Pakistan as one of the top 10 under the radar tourist destinations for 2020. So much for a country that was considered unsafe up until a few years ago. Since we have covered some of the best places to visit in Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan, it is now time to explore the wondrous and historic province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa not only shares its border with Afghanistan but also has a deep influence of its culture on the province, which is reflected in its language, dresses, food and also in cultural events. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is blessed with breathtaking beauty, mesmerising crystal clear blue lakes, pristine valleys, natural forests and historical landmarks, some of which date back to the Gandhara civilization. In fact, KP was the centre of the ancient kingdom of Gandhara and still has some of its archaeological remains. KP is also a good reservoir of water dams and the government is making efforts to turn five dams in Haripur, Kohat, Swabi, Nowshera and Abbottabad into picnic spots for tourists and domestic travelers.\n\nLet’s take a look at the best tourist attractions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nBest Tourist Attractions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n\nSince there are plenty of attractions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa we have divided the content into four parts. First, we will explore some of the most prominent cities and valleys of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and then we will take a closer look at the top attractions in KP. The last two sections will focus on the top cuisine in KP and the souvenirs you can buy from KP. But first, let us take a look at the cities you must visit in KP.\n\nTop Attractions in KP – Valleys and Cities\n\nPack your bags and explore the beautiful cities and valleys in KP.\n\nChitral\n\nSituated towards the west of River Kunhar, this veritable piece of heaven on earth is nestled at the base of the Hindu Kush mountain ranges. Chitral is known for its captivating landscapes, fruit-laden trees, snow-peaked mountains and lush green meadows.If you really want to make the most of your time at Chitral, then visit the valley during the summer months when you will see fruit-laden trees of cherries, apricots and pomegranate.\n\nChitral is known for its picturesque Kalash Valley where you will find women dressed up in the traditional embroidered dresses and men with feather caps. Other places to visit in Chitral are the enchanting valleys of Broghil, Barmoghlast, Goleen and Ayun Valley. Garam Chashma is a refreshing river flowing freely through the valley and if you are a history buff, then you shouldn’t miss visiting the Shahi Qila, which is also known as Chitral Fort. It was built during the time when Chitral was a princely state, before partition. It housed the barracks of the guards of the rulers – Mehtars in local terms.\n\nThe best time to visit the valley is in between April and October. During the winter season, the valley is covered in deep snow. You can either visit Chitral by air and take a flight from Islamabad to Chitral or take a road trip to Chitral. If you are traveling by road, remember that it would take almost 10 hours to reach the valley via N-45 motorway.\n\nSwat Valley\n\nSwat is a picturesque valley with gushing waters of Swat River cutting through it. You will find plenty of resorts just next to Swat River that offer breathtaking views both at sunrise and sunset. You can visit Swat anytime of the year but most travelers plan a trip during the summer season to enjoy the refreshing waterfalls and cold river streams.\n\nAlso dubbed as the East Switzerland, it is a delight for international tourists thanks to the free flowing rivers, natural waterfalls, gushing river streams, tall pine trees set against the snow-capped mountains. From the Buddhist stupas, White Palace and Takht-i-Bahi that depict rich history to the picturesque blue waters of the Mahodand Lake, snowy ski resort at Malam Jabba and the lush green meadows and pine forests of Kalam, everything seems right out of a fairytale!\n\nNaran and Kaghan\n\nPeople visiting northern areas visit Naran, Shogran and Kaghan Valley which is about 240 km away from Islamabad. It has some picturesque tourist attractions such as Siri Paye, which is a mesmerizing place with lush green meadows set against the mountainous backdrop.\n\nThe special bit about Siri Paye are the floating clouds that stoop to a low level, where you can actually pass through them like a ghost. Tourists also visit Lake Saif-ul-Malook, 9 kms from Naran in Mansehra District, where you can view the image of Malika Parbat in the blue waters. Another top attraction in Naran is Babusar Top, which is a mountain pass, 70 km from Naran and connects Thak Nala with Chilas.\n\nThe list does not end here as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is blessed with unsurmountable beauty and pristine landscapes. Malam Jabba is one such place, but in recent years it has been developed into a winter destination and numerous winter sports activities, events and festivals take place at Malamjabba Resort.\n\nMalam Jabba\n\nMalam Jabba is a beautiful valley and also a ski resort in the winter season. It is situated in the Hindu Kush range of Swat Valley, located more than 9,000 ft. above sea level. The spot offers some of the best avenues for professional and amateurs skiers in the region. During winters, when the snow is thick and firm, skiers enjoy snow tubing, skiing and skating on top of the snow-clad peak. There are a couple of 800 meter ski runs and well-maintained pistes that offer various difficulty levels both for amateurs and professionals.\n\nThe skiing season in Malam Jabba usually begins from January and ends in March and is a major attraction for tourists visiting Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The resort is also accessible via road from Islamabad, which is almost a 6-hour drive.\n\nAbbottabad\n\nAbbottabad serves as a transit city for tourists visiting the northern areas such as Nathiagali and Naran etc. Apart from being a stopover, Abbottabad is a beautiful tourist destination with many tourist spots such as Harnoi, which is located about 11 kilometers away from the main city center.\n\nIt is surrounded by tall green mountains and cold water streams that flow through the city. People who stop even for a day or two in Abbottabad, visit Thandiani, which is 31 km from Abbottabad and 2,700 metres above sea level. It is surrounded by lush green pine forests and the weather is bone chilling cold – hence the name Thandiani. If you are into history, then visiting St. Luke’s Church won’t disappoint you. Established in the 1860s, the building was established during the colonial times. The Lady Garden Public Park predates the partition era, when British ladies from the elite group used to visit the park to enjoy some relaxed time during the evenings. That is why many tourists who visit KP, explore the park because of its historical significance.\n\nKumrat Valley\n\nUnexplored and well-hidden from the world, Kumrat Valley is one of the best places to visit in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It is surrounded by tall, dense pine forests, gushing waterfalls and refreshing river streams. Located in Upper Dir, Kumrat Valley was not open for tourism up until now due to security concerns. However, the government of Pakistan has made efforts in bringing tourism to those areas which were previously neglected.\n\nYou will find this on Dir-Chitral road and it would take roughly about four hours from Timergara to reach Thall Town, where you will want to stop at the 19th century wooden mosque and explore the beautiful mosque made from Deodar trees with intricate carvings and detailed artwork. From Thall Town, around half an hour to one hour, you will reach your destination. From Kumrat Valley, tourists also trek to Jahaz Banda meadows and waterfalls, Katora Lake and Kaala Chashma.\n\nGaliyat\n\nIt is a narrow strip between Abbottabad and Murree. Basically, the Galiyat region comprises a hill tract featuring green meadows, chilly weather and tall pine trees. Ghora gali, Nathiagali, Changla Gali, Dunga Gali are all part of the Galiyat region in KP. In a recent bid to promote tourism in Pakistan, many fast-food chains, 3-star resorts are also being constructed here. In 2019, Galiyat saw an unprecedented hike of 139% in the influx of tourists.\n\nPeshawar\n\nThe capital of the province, Peshawar is one of the oldest cities in Pakistan, which dates back to 539 BC. Peshawari people are hospitable in nature and the streets are always buzzing with people casually roaming around buying stuff they like from roadside markets.\n\nSince it is an old city, you will find various historical buildings, relics and archaeological sites that reflect the Mughal era and rich history. Among the top tourist attractions in Peshawar are Qissa Khwani Bazaar, Bala Hisaar Fort, Mahabat Khan Mosque, Sethi Houses and Peshawar Museum. Ghanta Ghar or Clock House was built in 1990 to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.

The fort resembles Mughal architecture and was set up along the same style as that of the Lahore Fort.\n\nThe fort is made of mud-bricks with a lavish use of deodar wood and consists of three portions – the barracks of the troops, secretariat and a residential area that opens up to the garden on the riverside. In the secretariat the then rulers used to hold up open kutcheris and a special seating arrangement was put in place in this area amidst tall chinar trees.\n\nIf you hire a guide, he will tell you some interesting stories about Chitral Fort.

It is a fortified compound with two gates – one in the east and the other one on the west. The Gorakhnath Temple is situated in the centre of the caravanserai under a banyan tree, well-maintained by the Hindu community living in Peshawar. The government has built a museum in one of the buildings where important relics and artefacts can be found. There are also small shops in the premises where artisans display handicrafts and hand woven Peshawari shawls.\n\nInterestingly, the excavations that were done in 2007 at Gor Khatri further push Peshawar’s age to a few centuries back, making it one of the oldest cities in South East Asia. Archaeologists that have done excavations at the site have found around 13 layers belonging to different civilisations, dating from the colonial era and going all the way to the Indo-Greek period in 200 BCE.\n\nSethi House Complex\n\nWhen you walk out of the western gate of Gor Khatri, you will enter Bazaar Kalan, which is one of the oldest parts of Peshawar. Next to it is the Sethi Mohalla, comprising 6-7 residences and having a main haveli built by Karim Bakhsh Sethi.
