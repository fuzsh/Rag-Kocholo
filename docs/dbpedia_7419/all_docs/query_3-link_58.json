        "text": "Reissued with updates to health information.\n\nReconsider travel to Pakistan due to terrorism. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.\n\nDo not travel to:\n\nBalochistan province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to terrorism and kidnapping.\n\nThe immediate vicinity of the India-Pakistan border and the Line of Control due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict.\n\nCountry Summary: Terrorist groups continue to plot attacks in Pakistan. Terrorism and ongoing violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian, as well as local military and police, targets. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities. Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past.\n\nTerrorist attacks continue across Pakistan, with most occurring in Balochistan and KP, including the former FATA. Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nPakistan’s security environment remains fluid sometimes changing with little or no notice. There are greater security resources and infrastructure in the major cities, particularly Islamabad, and security forces in these areas may be more readily able to respond to an emergency compared to other areas of the country. While threats still exist, terrorist attacks occur less frequently in major urban areas than other parts of Pakistan.\n\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security environment. Travel by U.S. government personnel within Pakistan is restricted, and additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel outside of U.S. diplomatic facilities may occur at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.\n\nThe U.S. Consulate General in Peshawar is unable to provide any consular services to U.S. citizens.\n\nRead the country information page for additional information on travel to Pakistan.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Pakistan:\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nRemain aware of your surroundings and local events.\n\nVary travel routes and timing, especially for routine trips.\n\nBe cognizant of your surroundings, particularly around public markets, restaurants, government and military institutions, and other locations.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive security alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nReview the Country Security Report for Pakistan.\n\nU.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergencies. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nBalochistan Province – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nDo not travel to Balochistan province. Active terrorist groups, including an active separatist movement, have conducted deadly terrorist attacks against civilians, religious minorities, government offices, and security forces.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nKP Province, including the former FATA – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nDo not travel to KP province, which includes the former FATA. Active terrorist and insurgent groups routinely conduct attacks against civilians, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government offices, and security forces. These groups historically have not discriminated between government officials and civilians. Assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, including the targeting of polio eradication teams and Government of Pakistan security service (police and military) personnel.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nVicinity of Line of Control – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nDo not travel to the India-Pakistan border, including the Line of Control. Militant groups are known to operate in the area. India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border. The only official Pakistan-India border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the province of Punjab between Wagah, Pakistan, and Atari, India. Travelers are advised to confirm the status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel. An Indian visa is required to enter India, and no visa services are available at the border."
