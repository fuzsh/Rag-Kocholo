        "text": "New born children to Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards are registered by NADRA in the Afghan National Registration (ANR) database. In February 2017, the Federal Cabinet approved the extension of the validity of Proof of Registration (PoR) cards until 31 December 2017 and endorsed the comprehensive management policy for Afghans.\n\nFive PoR Card Modification centres countrywide support the modification and replacement of existing cards, registration of children up to age five, the issuance of official birth certificates to all children and the provision of individual PoR cards to registered children who have reached five years of age and are now entitled to their own cards. In 2017, Mobile Registration Vans (MRVs) were utilized for the provision of PCM centre services in remote areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Balochistan provinces. The processing of MRVs has been significantly improved due to the fact that UNHCR requested NADRA to provide MRVs with satellite connectivity which enables the MRV to process a larger number of applicants in an efficient manner. The same facility will also be utilized in 2018. A Mobile Delivery Van (MDV) will also be deployed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan for the delivery of modified PoR cards. MRVs and MDVs will be deployed to remote areas to ensure all registered Afghan refugee populations have equal access to birth registration. In 2018, UNHCR and NADRA will ensure that all PCM centres have adequate resources and are moved to appropriate locations to address the needs of the increased number of refugees seeking PCM centre services.\n\nIn 2018, UNHCR estimates that 50,000 children will be registered and issued with birth certificates. In Pakistan, the provision of birth certificates is available to all Afghan refugee children under the age of 18 years, not just new born children. Moreover, according to the agreed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), NADRA is required to issue official birth certificates to all registered new born children on the same day of registration and provide duplicate birth certificates if birth certificates have been lost or have degraded over time. Due to limited staff resources at the PCM centres, birth certificates were not always issued to children at the time of birth registration in 2017. It is also noted that MRVs are not equipped for the issuance of birth certificates due to operational reasons and technical difficulties, despite the agreement with NADRA. These challenges require parents to (re-)visit the nearest PCM centre to collect their childâ€™s birth certificate and lead to an increased gap in the issuance of birth certificates. In 2018, efforts will be made by UNHCR and NADRA to minimize these gaps in 2018, implement improved measures (e.g. ensuring the delivery of birth certificates through MDVs and enhancing the capacity the MRVs to issue birth certificates) and ensure that all children who are newly registered in the ANR database are provided with birth certificates on the day of registration. In 2018, UNHCR will also continue to conduct mass information campaigns on birth registration to ensure that all populations are informed of the procedures and the importance of documentation."
