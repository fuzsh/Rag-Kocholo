        "text": "In compliance with the directions of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan dated 11-10-2018 in HR Case No. 18200-K/2018, the Hon’ble Chief Justice of Peshawar High Court was pleased to appoint Mr. Justice Mohamamd Ibrahim Khan, Hon’ble Judge of Peshawar High Court as “Commission” on 12-10-2018 to probe into the despicable tragedy of APS incident which dismayed not only the whole nation but attracted condemnation from the people all over the world. It was the heartrending APS incident of December 16th, 2014 in which, the blooms and blossoms of Army Public School and College Warsak Road Peshawar were besieged and ruthlessly massacred by a group of maniac terrorists. 147 innocent souls, including 132 children, besides teachers and staff, embraced martyrdom in appalling manner, while 180 were injured.\n\nThe commission conducted extensive probe and examined 102 aggrieved people/complainant(s) besides, recording the statements of government functionaries of all ranks and honour from the Armed Forces, Bureaucracy and Police. They include, besides others; Lt. General Rtd. Hidayat-ur-Rehman, the then Corps Commander 11-Corps, Maj. General Inam Haider, the then Brigadier who conducted the “Court of Inquiry” and Maj. General Innayat Hussain, the then commander 102 Infantry Brigade who conducted the operation in APS. It was in fact, Maj. General. Shakirullah, then Brigadier-102, 11Corps who had offered himself as a Focal Person from Military’s/MoD side and his services facilitated appearance of the top notch Army officers before the Commission for their statements.\n\nThe Commission delved deeply into the grievances and submitted its detailed and all-encompassing report of 525 pages to the Hon’ble Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Pakistan."
