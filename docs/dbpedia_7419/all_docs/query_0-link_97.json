        "text": "PCB confirms schedule of 266-match 2021-22 domestic season\n\n• Season to commence with the T20 tournaments, followed by red-ball versions of the game before culminating with 50-over Pakistan Cup\n\n• Cricket Associations to field two sides each in the U16 and U19 competitions as the PCB aims to provide maximum exposure and opportunities to future stars; U13 event returns\n\n• 2021-22 season matches to be held in Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Multan, Muridke, Quetta, Rawalpindi, Sheikhupura and Sialkot\n\n• “With the amount of international cricket across all three formats scheduled in the 2021-22 season and beyond, the upcoming domestic season will prove to be a pathway for all those aspiring to serve Pakistan cricket and making a name at the international level,” says Director – High Performance, Nadeem Khan\n\nLahore, 9 August 2021:\n\nPakistan Cricket Board today announced the schedule of 2021-22 domestic cricket season in which it will hold 10 tournaments, comprising 266 matches. In the 2020-21 season, the PCB had organised 220 matches in nine tournaments to become the only cricket board to deliver a complete domestic schedule.\n\nDomestic competitions in the 2021-22 season are separate to the home international matches against New Zealand, England, West Indies and Australia, and the HBL Pakistan Super League, which will be held between September 2021 and March 2022.\n\nNot added to the 2021-22 domestic matches are the ongoing two-day CCA tournament matches, which commenced on 16 July and will conclude on 22 August, and the CCA U19 tournament that will begin on 1 September. The two tournaments are designed to provide opportunities to the outstanding performers to graduate to the Cricket Association sides for the senior and pathway competitions in the PCB Domestic Season 2021-22.\n\nThe additional matches in the forthcoming domestic circuit have been added in pathways cricket for which the PCB has allowed the six Cricket Associations to field two sides each in the U16 and U19 tournaments.\n\nThis means 12 sides will feature in the 62-match National U19 three-day championship and One-Day Cup, which will run side by side, from 3 October to 12 November in Gujranwala, Islamabad, Muridke, Rawalpindi and Sialkot.\n\nAnother 12 sides will take part in the 31-match National U16 Cup from 8 to 19 March 2022 with Rawalpindi hosting the single-league competition.\n\nThe National U13 One-Day Cup has returned to the national circuit after missing out last year due to Covid-19 pandemic. This single-league event will be held in Faisalabad from 8 to 18 February 2022.\n\nDirector High Performance, Nadeem Khan: “For the 2021-22 age-group cricket season, each Cricket Association will be allowed to field two U16 and U19 sides so that we can increase the pool of players at the grassroots level with a focus on providing more opportunities and exposure to our next generation of cricketers.\n\n“This strategy is aligned to the Cricket Associations planning of reviving clubs, schools and universities cricket within their jurisdictions with the best players getting opportunities to express their talent in national tournaments.\n\n“In the U16 and U19 competitions, the players will be provided the same environment as in senior cricket which will help in their overall development as professional cricketers.”\n\nThe 2021-22 season will kick-off with the eight-day Cricket Associations T20 tournament on 15 September in which the six second XI Cricket Association sides will go head to head in the shortest format of the game in Quetta.\n\nThe National T20, featuring country’s best shortest format players, will be held from 25 September to 13 October. Eighteen first round matches will be held in Multan, while the remaining 15 matches, including the two semi-finals and the final, will be held in Lahore.\n\nQuaid-e-Azam Trophy, a jewel in the crown of Pakistan’s domestic events, will commence on 20 October. The first half of the 10-round single-league competition will be held in Multan, Faisalabad and Lahore. The event will then move to Karachi where it will culminate with the five-day final from 29 December.\n\nThe three-day double-league Cricket Associations Championship for second XIs will be held from 28 September to 14 November, while the 50-over single-league Cricket Associations Challenge for second XIs will be played from 19 to 27 November. Both the tournaments will be held in Faisalabad, Lahore and Sheikhupura.\n\nCurtains will fall on the 2021-22 season in Lahore on 30 March 2022 with the final of the Pakistan Cup One-Day Tournament, which will get underway on 25 February and will be played on a double-league format. The other two event venues will be Faisalabad and Multan.\n\nNadeem Khan: “We are excited to confirm a quality-based and competitive cricket season, which will not only test the skills, technique and fitness of professional cricketers but will help the selectors and coaches identify top performers for their inclusion in the national framework.\n\n“With the amount of international cricket across all three formats scheduled in the 2021-22 season and beyond, the upcoming season will prove to be a pathway for all those aspiring to serve Pakistan cricket and making a name at the international level.\n\n“This, like the previous season, will be a tough one that will test the cricketers to their limits. But that’s exactly what we want. We want to see our domestic system produce mentally and physically tough players who can perform in any condition against any opposition.\n\n“Most of the first XI matches will be televised and promoted digitally, meaning no performance can be ignored or overlooked.\n\n“Like the previous season, the PCB will not only create playing opportunities for these players but will also provide them quality playing facilities as well as international standard lodging and boarding so they can produce their best performances. If we want our domestic system to be robust, competitive and valued, then we need to make sure we cater for all these basic requirements, which in the past have fallen through the cracks.”\n\nDetails on the tournament schedule, squads and match official appointments will be released in the lead up to the events.\n\nSchedule (subject to any late changes):\n\nFirst XI competitions\n\nNational T20 (six teams, 33 matches) – 25 September-13 October\n\nQuaid-e-Azam Trophy (six teams, 31 matches) – 20 October-29 December\n\nPakistan Cup (six teams, 33 matches) – 25 February-30 March 2022\n\nSecond XI competitions\n\nCricket Associations T20 (six teams, 15 matches) – 15-22 September\n\nCricket Associations Championship (three-day) (six teams, 30 matches) – 28 September-14 November\n\nCricket Associations Challenge (50 overs) (six teams, 15 matches) – 19-27 November\n\nPathway competitions\n\nNational U19 Championship (three-day) and Cup (one-Day) (12 teams, 62 matches) - (3 October--12 November)\n\nNational U16 Cup (One-Day) (12 teams, 31 matches) – 8-19 March 2022\n\nNational U13 Cup (One-Day) (16 matches) – 8-18 February 2022\n\nI cannot understand how do you expect a tournament having \"6\" teams to play 12 matches each.\n\nExplanation:-\n\nIf there are \"n\" teams in a tournament and each team plays against other once, then each team will play a maximum of \"n-1\" matches (not considering semi final and final).\n\nThe same if each team plays the other twice then it would have to play \"2*(n-1)\" matches.\n\nNote- A team cannot play against itself in a tournament.\n\nThere are 6 teams in QeA, each play \"6-1=5\" matches, since it is a double header they play \"2*(6-1)=10\" matches, in addition to the final.\n\nThe only thing that can be done is have a semi final and a final in the tournament, that way the top 4 teams play the semi final and the top 2 then compete in the finals. This would make the top 2 team play 12 matches, next 2 will play 11 and the bottom 2 would play 10.\n\nHope this helps, if i have made a mistake correct me.\n\nFair point. However, if required there are a couple models which exist (mostly in limited overs domestic cricket) where you can increase the number of matches while maintaining the same number of teams.\n\nWe can take example of the latest league (The hundred itself). There are 8 teams and each team will be playing 9 matches. Single round robin and then two matches (Home and away) against the closest rival. Australia has employed something similar in few editions of their one day cup as well.\n\nIts application in QAE would be something like; after the double round robin two closest rivals will play each other twice on home and away basis. Northern vs KPK, SP vs CP, Sindh vs Bal (2 matches against each other). That can take the total to 12 matches.\n\nIf it is required or PCB will look into that is something to be seen however, it can be practically possible.\n\nFair point.

A number of coaches who had favourable performance assessments are rewarded with promotions, while some coaches have been awarded the opportunity to step up to head coaching at various levels.\n\nThe coaches were primarily assessed around two key objectives\n\n• Putting their team in contention to win\n\n• Development of players\n\nAfter leading Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to all three titles – Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, National T20 Cup and Pakistan Cup – in the 2020-21 season, former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq has been tasked with leading the coaching staff of Central Punjab’s First XI, which includes former Pakistan internationals Akram Raza and Humayun Farhat – both promoted to First XI from Central Punjab’s Second XI coaching set-up – as assistant and fielding coaches.\n\nShahid Anwar, who coached Central Punjab First XI in the last season, has been appointed as the head coach of Southern Punjab First XI. His staff includes Aizaz Cheema and Irfan Fazil as assistant and fielding coaches.\n\nFor the 2021-22 domestic season, Abdul Rehman has moved to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after heading the Southern Punjab coaching staff. The seasoned coach is joined by Riffatullah Mohmand and Muhammad Siddiq as his assistant and fielding coaches.\n\nIjaz Ahmed Jnr is appointed as the head coach of Northern’s First XI team. Ijaz, a former international batter with more than 13,000 runs and 171 scalps in first-class cricket, has coached Central Punjab First XI in the 2019-20 domestic season. He is joined by former Pakistan fast bowler Samiullah Niazi, who was the assistant coach of Central Punjab First XI last season, and Fahad Akram, who earns promotion to Northern First XI after serving as assistant coach of the Cricket Association’s U19 team last season, as a fielding coach.\n\nFormer Pakistan batters Basit Ali and Faisal Iqbal will continue in their roles as head coaches of Sindh and Balochistan First XI teams.\n\nAt Sindh, Mohammad Masroor replaces Iqbal Imam, who moves to Southern Punjab Second XI as a head coach, as the assistant coach and Hanif Malik, last season’s Sindh U19 assistant coach, has earned a promotion and will be the fielding coach of the First XI team.\n\nBalochistan’s assistant coach, along with the head coach of Southern Punjab’s U19 and U16 sides, will be appointed following a merit-based, robust recruitment process. Hussain Khosa will continue as Balochistan First XI’s fielding coach.\n\nThe 360-degree review process was carried out by Grant Bradburn, the head of high performance coaching at the National High Performance Centre, following which he submitted his recommendations to Director – High Performance, which were subsequently approved by the Chief Executive.\n\nGrant Bradburn: “It is very important that we continue to upskill our coaches by providing them constructive feedback regularly, while challenging them in different environments, which we are hopeful will continue to grow our coaches to become contenders for Pakistan roles in the future.\n\n“This will not only help us in boosting our pool of Pakistan coaching candidates, but also develop strong self-reliant players by learning from multiple coaches who are ready to take on different challenges from the early stages of their careers.\n\n“Abdul Razzaq had a fantastic debut season as a head coach and as such he has been asked to take up the coaching role of the Central Punjab’s side. This move will bring new challenges for Razzaq and I have no doubts that he will embrace them.\n\n“The same logic was behind our decision to appoint Shahid Anwar and Abdul Rehman, who are the two experienced, valuable assets in our coach pathway, with the Southern Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sides, respectively. Under the guidance of Shahid, Central Punjab scripted one of the most incredible tales in first-class cricket by staging an epic comeback in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy to share the silverware with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Under Rehman, Southern Punjab played the final of the National T20 Cup after putting up a miraculous run-chase in the semi-final and he had been with the side for two years.\n\n“Basit Ali and Faisal Iqbal coached the First XI teams for the first time in the last season and have been given another season with Sindh and Balochistan as they continue to build their sides. We remain invested in supporting them, while they establish themselves as coaches who can create a winning environment, while exposing our players to rich learning.”\n\nDirector – High Performance Nadeem Khan: “I want to congratulate everyone who has been appointed as a coach for what promises to be an exciting and action-packed 2021-22 domestic cricket season. These merit-based appointed have been made after considering the demands of our ever-evolving sport.\n\n“Many coaches have earned promotions based on their performances in the 2020-21 season.

In the 2020-21 season, the PCB had organised 220 matches in nine tournaments to become the only cricket board to deliver a complete domestic schedule.\n\nDomestic competitions in the 2021-22 season are separate to the home international matches against New Zealand, England, West Indies and Australia, and the HBL Pakistan Super League, which will be held between September 2021 and March 2022.\n\nNot added to the 2021-22 domestic matches are the ongoing two-day CCA tournament matches, which commenced on 16 July and will conclude on 22 August, and the CCA U19 tournament that will begin on 1 September. The two tournaments are designed to provide opportunities to the outstanding performers to graduate to the Cricket Association sides for the senior and pathway competitions in the PCB Domestic Season 2021-22.\n\nThe additional matches in the forthcoming domestic circuit have been added in pathways cricket for which the PCB has allowed the six Cricket Associations to field two sides each in the U16 and U19 tournaments.\n\nThis means 12 sides will feature in the 62-match National U19 three-day championship and One-Day Cup, which will run side by side, from 3 October to 12 November in Gujranwala, Islamabad, Muridke, Rawalpindi and Sialkot.\n\nAnother 12 sides will take part in the 31-match National U16 Cup from 8 to 19 March 2022 with Rawalpindi hosting the single-league competition.\n\nThe National U13 One-Day Cup has returned to the national circuit after missing out last year due to Covid-19 pandemic. This single-league event will be held in Faisalabad from 8 to 18 February 2022.\n\nDirector High Performance, Nadeem Khan: “For the 2021-22 age-group cricket season, each Cricket Association will be allowed to field two U16 and U19 sides so that we can increase the pool of players at the grassroots level with a focus on providing more opportunities and exposure to our next generation of cricketers.\n\n“This strategy is aligned to the Cricket Associations planning of reviving clubs, schools and universities cricket within their jurisdictions with the best players getting opportunities to express their talent in national tournaments.\n\n“In the U16 and U19 competitions, the players will be provided the same environment as in senior cricket which will help in their overall development as professional cricketers.”\n\nThe 2021-22 season will kick-off with the eight-day Cricket Associations T20 tournament on 15 September in which the six second XI Cricket Association sides will go head to head in the shortest format of the game in Quetta.\n\nThe National T20, featuring country’s best shortest format players, will be held from 25 September to 13 October. Eighteen first round matches will be held in Multan, while the remaining 15 matches, including the two semi-finals and the final, will be held in Lahore.\n\nQuaid-e-Azam Trophy, a jewel in the crown of Pakistan’s domestic events, will commence on 20 October. The first half of the 10-round single-league competition will be held in Multan, Faisalabad and Lahore. The event will then move to Karachi where it will culminate with the five-day final from 29 December.\n\nThe three-day double-league Cricket Associations Championship for second XIs will be held from 28 September to 14 November, while the 50-over single-league Cricket Associations Challenge for second XIs will be played from 19 to 27 November. Both the tournaments will be held in Faisalabad, Lahore and Sheikhupura.\n\nCurtains will fall on the 2021-22 season in Lahore on 30 March 2022 with the final of the Pakistan Cup One-Day Tournament, which will get underway on 25 February and will be played on a double-league format. The other two event venues will be Faisalabad and Multan.\n\nNadeem Khan: “We are excited to confirm a quality-based and competitive cricket season, which will not only test the skills, technique and fitness of professional cricketers but will help the selectors and coaches identify top performers for their inclusion in the national framework.\n\n“With the amount of international cricket across all three formats scheduled in the 2021-22 season and beyond, the upcoming season will prove to be a pathway for all those aspiring to serve Pakistan cricket and making a name at the international level.\n\n“This, like the previous season, will be a tough one that will test the cricketers to their limits. But that’s exactly what we want. We want to see our domestic system produce mentally and physically tough players who can perform in any condition against any opposition.\n\n“Most of the first XI matches will be televised and promoted digitally, meaning no performance can be ignored or overlooked.\n\n“Like the previous season, the PCB will not only create playing opportunities for these players but will also provide them quality playing facilities as well as international standard lodging and boarding so they can produce their best performances. If we want our domestic system to be robust, competitive and valued, then we need to make sure we cater for all these basic requirements, which in the past have fallen through the cracks.”\n\nDetails on the tournament schedule, squads and match official appointments will be released in the lead up to the events.\n\nSchedule (subject to any late changes):\n\nFirst XI competitions\n\nNational T20 (six teams, 33 matches) – 25 September-13 October\n\nQuaid-e-Azam Trophy (six teams, 31 matches) – 20 October-29 December\n\nPakistan Cup (six teams, 33 matches) – 25 February-30 March 2022\n\nSecond XI competitions\n\nCricket Associations T20 (six teams, 15 matches) – 15-22 September\n\nCricket Associations Championship (three-day) (six teams, 30 matches) – 28 September-14 November\n\nCricket Associations Challenge (50 overs) (six teams, 15 matches) – 19-27 November\n\nPathway competitions\n\nNational U19 Championship (three-day) and Cup (one-Day) (12 teams, 62 matches) - (3 October--12 November)\n\nNational U16 Cup (One-Day) (12 teams, 31 matches) – 8-19 March 2022\n\nNational U13 Cup (One-Day) (16 matches) – 8-18 February 2022\n\nNot enough 4 day games for the 1st X1s\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board today announced coaches for the 42 sides across six Cricket Associations for the 266-match 2021-22 domestic season.\n\nThe appointments have been made after carrying out a 360-degree comprehensive performance review process, keeping in view the needs of the upcoming players across all rungs of the game and to further upskill the coaches by challenging them in different environments. A number of coaches who had favourable performance assessments are rewarded with promotions, while some coaches have been awarded the opportunity to step up to head coaching at various levels.\n\nThe coaches were primarily assessed around two key objectives\n\n• Putting their team in contention to win\n\n• Development of players\n\nAfter leading Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to all three titles – Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, National T20 Cup and Pakistan Cup – in the 2020-21 season, former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq has been tasked with leading the coaching staff of Central Punjab’s First XI, which includes former Pakistan internationals Akram Raza and Humayun Farhat – both promoted to First XI from Central Punjab’s Second XI coaching set-up – as assistant and fielding coaches.\n\nShahid Anwar, who coached Central Punjab First XI in the last season, has been appointed as the head coach of Southern Punjab First XI. His staff includes Aizaz Cheema and Irfan Fazil as assistant and fielding coaches.\n\nFor the 2021-22 domestic season, Abdul Rehman has moved to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after heading the Southern Punjab coaching staff. The seasoned coach is joined by Riffatullah Mohmand and Muhammad Siddiq as his assistant and fielding coaches.\n\nIjaz Ahmed Jnr is appointed as the head coach of Northern’s First XI team. Ijaz, a former international batter with more than 13,000 runs and 171 scalps in first-class cricket, has coached Central Punjab First XI in the 2019-20 domestic season. He is joined by former Pakistan fast bowler Samiullah Niazi, who was the assistant coach of Central Punjab First XI last season, and Fahad Akram, who earns promotion to Northern First XI after serving as assistant coach of the Cricket Association’s U19 team last season, as a fielding coach.\n\nFormer Pakistan batters Basit Ali and Faisal Iqbal will continue in their roles as head coaches of Sindh and Balochistan First XI teams.\n\nAt Sindh, Mohammad Masroor replaces Iqbal Imam, who moves to Southern Punjab Second XI as a head coach, as the assistant coach and Hanif Malik, last season’s Sindh U19 assistant coach, has earned a promotion and will be the fielding coach of the First XI team.\n\nBalochistan’s assistant coach, along with the head coach of Southern Punjab’s U19 and U16 sides, will be appointed following a merit-based, robust recruitment process. Hussain Khosa will continue as Balochistan First XI’s fielding coach.\n\nThe 360-degree review process was carried out by Grant Bradburn, the head of high performance coaching at the National High Performance Centre, following which he submitted his recommendations to Director – High Performance, which were subsequently approved by the Chief Executive.\n\nGrant Bradburn: “It is very important that we continue to upskill our coaches by providing them constructive feedback regularly, while challenging them in different environments, which we are hopeful will continue to grow our coaches to become contenders for Pakistan roles in the future.\n\n“This will not only help us in boosting our pool of Pakistan coaching candidates, but also develop strong self-reliant players by learning from multiple coaches who are ready to take on different challenges from the early stages of their careers.\n\n“Abdul Razzaq had a fantastic debut season as a head coach and as such he has been asked to take up the coaching role of the Central Punjab’s side. This move will bring new challenges for Razzaq and I have no doubts that he will embrace them.\n\n“The same logic was behind our decision to appoint Shahid Anwar and Abdul Rehman, who are the two experienced, valuable assets in our coach pathway, with the Southern Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sides, respectively. Under the guidance of Shahid, Central Punjab scripted one of the most incredible tales in first-class cricket by staging an epic comeback in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy to share the silverware with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Under Rehman, Southern Punjab played the final of the National T20 Cup after putting up a miraculous run-chase in the semi-final and he had been with the side for two years.\n\n“Basit Ali and Faisal Iqbal coached the First XI teams for the first time in the last season and have been given another season with Sindh and Balochistan as they continue to build their sides. We remain invested in supporting them, while they establish themselves as coaches who can create a winning environment, while exposing our players to rich learning.”\n\nDirector – High Performance Nadeem Khan: “I want to congratulate everyone who has been appointed as a coach for what promises to be an exciting and action-packed 2021-22 domestic cricket season. These merit-based appointed have been made after considering the demands of our ever-evolving sport.\n\n“Many coaches have earned promotions based on their performances in the 2020-21 season.

These courses were not recognised by the current Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) but during the tenure of Director National Cricket Academies Mudassar Nazar, many of these suspicious courses were approved in order to fast-track former cricketers into the coaching setup. Many individuals benefited from the move and are still enjoying roles in domestic teams.\n\nRecently, the National Cricket Academy was renamed the National High Performance Center (NHPC) and Nadeem Khan replaced Mudassar Nazar as the director. Sources have claimed that the Director of the NHPC, Nadeem, had failed a level-three course in 2012 after not submitting an assignment.\n\nMeanwhile, Samiullah Niazi had failed the second assignment of a level-two course and could not succeed in a second attempt either. He is currently occupying a coaching role in the Northern Association first XI.\n\nAbdul Rehman does not have extensive experience in first-class cricket but was appointed as the head coach of Peshawar due to his level-four coaching credentials.\n\nOn the other hand, Abdul Razzaq holds a level-two coaching qualification and occupies the head coach position in the Central Punjab first XI.\n\nLevel-four coaching qualification holder and former cricketer Wasim Haider, meanwhile, was given the charge of a second XI side.\n\nhttps://cricketpakistan.com.pk/en/n...coaching-courses-taken-by-pakistan-cricketers\n\nCricket Association squads for 2021-22 season announced\n\n• Local player representation in Balochistan’s squad increased to 55pc\n\nLahore, 4 September 2021:\n\nThe six Cricket Association squads for the 2021-22 domestic season have been unveiled. Each squad was selected by the head coach, chairperson and chief executive of the respective Cricket Association in the presence of national men’s chief selector Muhammad Wasim, Nadeem Khan, High Performance Director, Junaid Zia, Domestic Cricket General Manager and chief executives of the other Cricket Associations as observers.\n\nEach Cricket Association squad comprises 40 players – 32 of which will be awarded domestic contracts, to be announced in due course – along with 10 additional players. Every Cricket Association will name 16 players ahead of the First XI and Second XI tournaments, and these players can be transferred between the two teams.\n\nWhile majority of players from the 2020-21 domestic season were retained, the gaps in each of the six sides were plugged with top performers of the City Cricket Association tournaments, after head coaches had a close look at them in the pre-season training camps that were held last week at each of the six Cricket Associations.\n\nThe selected players are:\n\nBalochistan – Aftab Ahmed (Loralai), Fahad Hussain (Jaffarabad), Mohammad Idrees (Quetta), Mohammad Javed (Pishin), Sana Ullah (Loralai), Shoaib Ahmed (Lasbela), Syed Zainullah (Pishin) and Tariq Jameel (Loralai)\n\nCentral Punjab – Asad Ali Jnr (Hafizabad), Gohar Hafeez Butt, Haider Ali (both Lahore), Mohammad Faizan (Faisalabad), Mohammad Tabraiz (Sialkot), Mohammad Waheed (Lahore) and Mudassar Riaz (Faisalabad)\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa – Aitzaz Habib Khan (Mardan), Farhan Khan (Mohmand), Khayyam Khan (Swabi), Mashal Khan (Haripur), Mohammad Ibrahim (Swabi), Mohammad Tahir (Bannu), Niaz Khan (Swat) and Yasir Khan (Bannu)\n\nNorthern – Aqib Liaqat (Poonch), Asad Raza (Faisalabad), Hamza Arshad, Kashif Ali (both Rawalpindi), Sadaqat Ali (Faisalabad), Sarmad Hameed (Jhelum) and Zaman Khan (Mirpur)\n\nSindh – Asif Mehmood (Hyderabad), Imtiaz Leghari (Khairpur), Junaid Ilyas, Khuzaima Bin Tanveer, Mohammad Afzal, Mohammad Shahid Mihrani (all four Karachi), Mushtaq Ahmed Kalhoro (Sukkur) and Usman Khan (Karachi)\n\nSouthern Punjab – Ali Majid (Khanewal), Humayun Altaf (Lodhran), Kaleem Ullah (Layyah), Mohammad Sharoon Siraj (Sahiwal), Mohammad Jahangir (DG Khan), Mohammad Shahriyar and Mohammad Sudais (both Muzzafargarh) and Moin-ud-Din (Bahawalpur)\n\nThis move is in line with the PCB’s policy of incentivising and rewarding top performers at each rung of domestic cricket and setting a clear pathway for graduation to the next level.\n\nThe head coaches of the six Cricket Associations, who served as lead selectors of their sides, retained the core players, following which the remaining players were sent to a selection pool from where they were picked by other teams.\n\nBalochistan’s squad includes 55 per cent local players, which is a jump by 10 per cent from the last season as the PCB continues its efforts to develop the game in the province and provide opportunities to the youth to establish their careers as cricketers.\n\nIn line with the promotion of the sport in the province, the PCB will commence the 2021-22 season from Quetta’s picturesque Bugti Stadium with the Cricket Associations T20 tournament starting on 15 September.\n\nThe six squads will gather at the major centres in their jurisdictions for the pre-season camp from Sunday.\n\nBalochistan will have their camp at Quetta’s Bugti Stadium, Central Punjab’s will be conducted at LCCA Ground, Lahore, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s at Abbottabad Cricket Stadium, Northern’s at House of Northern, Islamabad, Sindh’s at National Stadium, Karachi and Southern Punjab’s at Multan Cricket Stadium.\n\nBalochistan head coach Faisal Iqbal: “The CCA tournament provided a great opportunity to me to watch the upcoming cricketers of Balochistan and it helped me in further increasing the percentage of players in the squad. Last year, we had 45 per cent local players, which has now gone up to 55 per cent, which is a great sign for Balochistan cricket.
