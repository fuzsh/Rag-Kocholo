The project will focus on promoting entrepreneurship and reducing poverty among Chitral and Swat youth. The signing ceremony took place at the department of higher education archives and libraries and was attended by several notable individuals, including the Secretary for higher education Dawood khan, Chief Coordination Officer of KP Center for excellence on countering violent extremism Dr. Ayaz Khan, Dr. Ihasanullah Mir senior advisor Hashoo Foundation, Ms. Khalida Director Hashoo Foundation, and others. Under the project, many of households in the identified villages of Chitral and Swat will be provided with loans to set up their own indigenous business startups, benefiting around 2,000 youths, both male and female. The universities of Swat and Chitral will provide training facilities to facilitate the process, while the Hashoo Foundation will conduct skill needs assessments, technical assessments, and mentoring for at least three years. The project is a pilot initiative in the Malakand valley and is expected to have a significant impact on the youth of the region by promoting entrepreneurship and reducing poverty, ultimately helping to prevent and counter violent extremism.\n\nEvent On: 06-03-2023"
