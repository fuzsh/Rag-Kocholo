        "text": "Senator Salma Ataullahjan was born in Mardan, Pakistan, in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Senator Ataullahjan was appointed to the Senate in the summer of 2010 as a representative for the province of Ontario. As the first Canadian Senator of Pakistani origin, she stands for the ethnic diversity of all Canadians. Senator Ataullahjan is deputy chair of the Senate Committee on Human Rights and a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade.\n\nWho inspired you to get involved in public life?\n\nGrowing up in a family that was involved in public life meant that politics were always part and parcel of my daily reality. My father was a senator in Pakistan, who was imprisoned after opposing the military coup d'état and martial law. Being exposed to this from a young age instilled in me a deep understanding of the importance and value of service to the community and standing up for one’s beliefs.\n\nWhat do you think are the biggest public policy issues facing Canada today?\n\nThere are a number of issues that Canadians face today, including the implications of an aging population, the challenges of our economy and increased personal debt, as well as the growth of human trafficking within our borders. We’re also facing a crisis due to a number of issues within our Indigenous communities.\n\nWhy should more Canadians care about what happens in the Senate?\n\nAs the upper house of Parliament, the Senate plays an important role in every legislative decision that is made. The quality of debate and the work of Senate Committees are of the highest standard. This is because we are able to look at the issues from a non-partisan perspective and ask the tough questions.\n\nSenators, themselves, are also very impressive and have wide-ranging expertise. Our commitment to functioning as a house of sober second thought is as strong today as when it was first envisioned.\n\nWhat legislative or committee work are you most proud of participating in to date?\n\nI’m most proud of my work as a member and deputy chair of the Standing Senate Committee on Human Rights, where we focus on the topics that I’m most passionate about, such as issues affecting women, children and other disenfranchised persons.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Rana Plaza (an eight-storey commercial building in Dhaka’s garment district that collapsed and killed 2,500 in 2013), I visited the site in Bangladesh and experienced the devastation first hand. I was deeply moved while standing amongst the ruins surrounded by parents and family members still looking for their children and loved ones. Consequently, I felt compelled to suggest a study on the human rights of garment workers in Bangladesh and how Canada’s corporations played a role in what took place there.\n\nI am also particularly proud of the studies I proposed and completed on cyber-bullying and the re-settlement process of Syrian refugees in Canada.\n\nWhat is a hidden gem in your region that more Canadians need to know about?\n\nOne thing we enjoy in many areas of Toronto is the diversity and quality of ethnic food, which serves as a testament to our multicultural community. This is particularly true of Scarborough, where we have some of the best ethnic food in the world — the list of restaurants and cuisines one could enjoy in my neighbourhood is almost endless.\n\nAnother thing Toronto is not often recognized for by other Canadians is actually the natural beauty we have to offer. The Scarborough Bluffs and in particular Bluffers Park, is one of the most beautiful spots in the country, especially during the monarch butterfly migration when the park is filled with butterflies.\n\nCan you name a guilty pleasure song / album that always makes you smile and why?\n\nThe song \"Work\" by Rihanna and Drake is a guilty pleasure song that I enjoy. Rihanna has a beautiful voice, Drake is one of the best artists to come out of Toronto and the addition of Caribbean reggae and dancehall beats gives the song a really fun energy.\n\nWhat is the last book you read or movie you saw which you recommended to someone else and why?\n\nThe last movie I saw that I recommended was a Canadian movie called ‘Remember’, starring Canadian legend Christopher Plummer. It’s a poignant story with superb acting and a powerful ending.\n\nThe last book I recommended to someone was 'The Last Mughal' by William Dalrymple. It details an uprising against the British Empire that started in the army and became the first war of independence. The uprising shook the British Empire with the last Mughal King, Bahadur Shah Zafar, bearing the brunt of the fallout.\n\nIt’s an important read because through learning of Zafar's imprisonment, the looting of libraries, the destruction of their seat of culture in Delhi, and the mighty Mughal Empire, we’re able to better understand the forces that have shaped and continue to shape the region today. As Dalrymple states in the book: \"As we have seen in our own time, nothing threatens the liberal and moderate aspect of Islam so much as aggressive Western intrusion and interference in the East, just as nothing so dramatically radicalizes the ordinary Muslim and feeds the power of the extremists; the histories of Islamic fundamentalism and Western imperialism have, after all, often been closely, and dangerously, intertwined.\"\n\nWhat sports team (amateur/professional) do you support?\n\nI’m a Senator from Toronto so of course I support the Blue Jays. I remember watching the World Series in the early 90s with my brother from Boston who roots for the Red Sox — but even his son couldn’t resist cheering for the Jays instead. The Jays gave Canadians so much to be excited about and proud of, both then and now.\n\nWhy are you proud to be Canadian?\n\nEvery day, in ways both large and small, I am reminded of how proud I am to be a Canadian. There is no other place in the world like ours. Visiting other countries and speaking to friends and relatives living in other parts of the West, I am regularly reminded of how Canada upholds global human rights and serves as a model of an inclusive and welcoming society that other nations strive towards.\n\nSenator Salma Ataullahjan was born in Mardan, Pakistan, in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
