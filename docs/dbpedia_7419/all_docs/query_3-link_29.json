        "text": "ABOUT KHYBER-PAKHTUNKHWA\n\nKhyber-Pakhtunkhwa at one time the North-West Frontier Province, or NWFP, runs for over one, 100 kilometers along the border with Afghanistan.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa’s provincial capital and largest town is Peshawar, with Mardan being the second-largest. It shares borders with the Federally Administered tribal Areas to the west; Gilgit–Baltistan to the northeast; Azad Kashmir, Islamabad and Punjab to the east and southeast. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa doesn’t formally share a border with Balochistan, that instead borders Federally Administered tribal Areas. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa conjointly shares a global border with Afghanistan, to that the province is joined via the historic khyber pass.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa is the site of the traditional kingdom Gandhara, together with the ruins of its capital, Pushkalavati, close to modern-day Charsadda, and therefore the most distinguished center of learning within the Peshawar valley, Takht-i-Bahi. It has been beneath the suzerainty of the Persians, Greeks, Mauryans, Kushans, Shahis, Ghaznavids, Mughals, Afghanistan, Sikhs, and British Empire at various points throughout its long history.\n\nGeographically the province might be divided into 2 zones: the northern one extending from the ranges of the mountain range to the borders of Peshawar basin and the southern one extending from Peshawar to the Derajat basin.\n\nThe northern zone is cold and snowy in winters with significant precipitation and pleasant summers with the exception of Peshawar basin that is hot in summer and cold in winter. it has moderate rainfall. The southern zone is arid with hot summers and comparatively cold winters and scanty rainfall.\n\nThe major rivers that criss-cross the province are the Kabul, Swat, Chitral, Kunar, Siran, Panjkora, Bara, Kurram, Dor, Haroo, Gomal and Zhob.\n\nIts snow-capped peaks and luxurious green valleys of bizarre beauty have huge potential for tourism.\n\nThe climate of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa varies vastly for a locality of its size, encompassing most of the various climate varieties found in Pakistan. The province stretching southward from the Baroghil Pass within the mountain range covers nearly six degrees of latitude; it is primarily a mountainous region. Dera Ismail Khan is one amongst the most popular places in South Asia whereas in the mountains to the north the weather is mild in the summer and intensely cold in the winter. The air is mostly terribly dry; consequently, the daily and annual vary of temperature is sort of massive. Rainfall also varies widely. though massive parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are generally dry, the province conjointly contains the wettest elements of Pakistan in its eastern fringe specially in monsoon season from middle June to middle Sept.\n\nUrdu, being the national and official language, serves as a language for inter-ethnic communications, and generally Pashtu is the language among communities that speak alternative ethnic languages. English is co-official and conjointly employed in education, whereas Arabic is employed for religious purposes and education. there is some population in Peshawar town World Health Organization speak Persian since nineteenth century.\n\nHindko and Pashtu ethnic music are in style in Pakhtunkhwa and have a rich tradition going back many years. the most instruments are the rubab, mangey and harmonium. khowar folk music is in style in Chitral and northern Swat. The tunes of khowar music are terribly totally different from those of Pashtu, and therefore the main instrument is the Chitrali sitar. A sort of band music composed of clarinets (surnai) and drums is popular in Chitral. It is played at polo matches and dances. A similar sort of band music is played within the neighbouring Northern Areas.\n\n[divider style=”normal” top=”20″ bottom=”20″]\n\nPLACES OF INTEREST\n\n[toggle title=”MALAM JABBA” state=”close”]\n\nMalam Jabba the fairytale land of romance and beauty, offers unlimited sights that the eye can behold, mighty ranges of Hindu Kush, the Karakuram and black mountains, gentle slopes, placid plains, torrential streams, lush green meadows and thick green forests of pine. Come over for an exciting experience to this nature’s art gallery and you will never forget.\n\nStands on top of a mountain of the Hindu Kush range, at a distance of 40 Kilometers north east of Saidu Sharif. Surrounded by wonderful panorama of scenic splendor and mighty mountains, Malam Jabba is much more than just a ski resort. It is a holiday resort that holds great fascination for tourists and is also home to the remains of ancient civilization. Malam Jabba is 314 Kilometers from Islamabad and 51 Kilometers from Saidu Sharif airport.[/toggle]\n\n[toggle title=”LAKE SAIF-UL-MALOOK” state=”close”]\n\nLake Saiful Muluk has a touch of the unreal about it, nestling 3,200 meters high in the shadow of the Malika Parbat (Queen of the mountains) 5,291 meters high.\n\nWords can hardly be just to this place’s attraction. The sea green, clear as crystal, freezing water surface amid gigantic glaciers is one part of it. A classic fable goes about this area of a prince and a fairy queen still residing and dancing above water surface every month on 14th of lunar calendar. Should you get along with a local inhabitant by chance, they would certainly run you through this tale.[/toggle]\n\n[toggle title=”NATHIAGALI” state=”close”]\n\nYou must have heard about this one a lot. It is more about seeing this one rather, anyway. It is simply said that this area is a maze of scenic beauty. It’s a host of hiking and great weather that is a lot cooler because of its magnificent altitude. Nathiagali is located midway and an hour’s drive away from Abbottabad and Murree; double the time if you’re driving from Islamabad. Head out during May, June, July, and August, it would be best suited, since during these months the temperature is tolerable for a visitor generally in KPK. However, when you hear about fog here, take your steps back because visibility is reduced to a few feet only. Nothing like your hometown’s fog. Top attractions Pakistan can be scattered in hazards.[/toggle]\n\n[toggle title=”MUSHKPURI” state=”close”]\n\nPresenting nature; nothing like anything or anywhere you have seen before. Known to be the second highest hill of Galyat and located in the hilly areas of Abbottabad. Although there is an arduous journey of nearly 3 hours to the top, which takes your breath away – ascend like you have never had experienced before. Another trek follows from Dungagali to Mushkpuri, however, this one is more amiable and boasts an appealing sight of Ayubia National Park in KPK. Must explore the water pond at the top which casts a remarkable reflection of sky and trees. That is not it yet because a beautiful sight of Kashmir valley can also be seen from Mushkpuri top. So, basically, not only this breathtaking location offers you its intrinsic beauty but also glimpses of surrounding places – so much to offer in one place.[/toggle]\n\n[toggle title=”AYUBIA NATIONAL PARK” state=”close”]\n\nCovering an area of approximately 3128-hectare acres, this place is specifically one in KPK that is home to migrating birds and animals prone to extinction threat. The black bear and leopards dangle in common sight. Two species: Koklass Pheasant and Kalij Pheasant – specifically subjected to extinction – are found here. One’s inner child and sense of adventure come into play upon adventure because it is surprising to witness such animals here. If you happen to be keen of hiking, tramp along the pipeline which leads to Dunga Gali after passing through Ayubia National Park. However, one must be sure since this 45-minute voyage can overwhelm with picturesque beauty of River Jhelum and hills dressed in pine.[/toggle]\n\n[toggle title=”SWAT VALLEY” state=”close”]\n\nSwat was once the cradle of Buddhism of all its schools- Little Vehicle, Great Vehicle and the Esoteric sects where once 1,400 monasteries flourished. It was the home of the famous Gandhara School of Sculpture which was an expression of Graeco-Roman form in the local Buddhist tradition.\n\nSwat was also the historical land where the Muslim conquerors, Mahmud of Ghazni, Babur and Akbar fought their battles preparatory to the conquest of the South Asia.The ruins of great Buddhist stupas, monasteries and statues are found all over Swat. The valley of Swat sprawls over 10,360 sq. kms at an average elevation of 975 meters. The maximum temperature in July is 38 C and minimum (during January) is 1 C. The normal temperature is maximum 21 C and minimum 7 C. Located in the monsoon belt, it receives more rain than most northern areas, so the land is particularly fertile and green. The Swat River and its tributaries gush through rocky gorges and are particularly known for trout fishing. The houses of the small villages in the area are stacked one on top of the other up the mountainsides, with the roofs of one level of houses used as a front street for houses on the next level.\n\nThe hillsides abound with forts, a testament to the region’s strategic importance. Alexander the Great and his army marched through Chakdar, and subsequent invaders left their mark: the town still has remains of Buddhist monasteries from the 1st to 7th centuries, while Hindu forts from the 8th to 10th centuries loom on the hilltops. Worth visiting are the valley’s graveyards, which have been used for 3,500 years.\n\nMount Ilam (2,811m, 9,222 ft) has been considered sacred since prehistoric times. A trek to the top brings visitors to a group of massive square blocks of stone, which archaeologists guess were used as an ancient altar.\n\nThe Greek fought for its beauty, the Buddhist inhabited it because of its eternal beauty and peace, the Moguls envied its lush green valleys and fast flowing rivers and today it is coveted by the pathans, the Kohistanis and the Gujars. Over two thousand years ago, this prosperous valley of Swat originally known, as Udyan was the home of well-settled people, living with magnificently planned towns. In 327 BC, Alexander the Great fought his way to Udigram and Barikot and settled a good part of his army here. Later, the Buddhists came, they preached, converted, fought and stayed to worship. Graphic remains of Buddhist culture date back to the 2nd century. In the 11th century Muhmud of Ghazni invaded Swat after having advanced through Dir, and defeated Gira, the local ruler, near Udigram. After him followed Moguls, under Babar and his grand son Akbar, yet they were unable to conquer the valley. There is evidence that by then the Yusufzai pathans – fierce, proud and resolute warriors – defended their soil against all invaders, including the British. Winston filled slopes, meandering rivers, and tumbling streams and is surrounded by the mighty ranges of the Hindukush and the Karakurams. The valley is 3250 feet above sea level and Saidu Sharif and Maingora are the towns that form the twin capital of this area. The Museum in Saidu Shariff has a large collection of Gandhara sculptures collected from some of the Buddhist sites in Swat. In the ethnographic section there is some local embroidery, carved wood and tribal Jewelry. There are also a few coins on display. Butkara- the remains of one of the most important Buddhist shrines in the valley. This site consists of a main stupa around which jostle 215 votive stupas in apparently glorious disarray. The main stupa was believed to contain some ashes of Lord Buddha and to have been built by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka. It is difficult to imagine it, as it must have been once, all painted and gilded and topped by stone umbrellas. You can still see the statues of lions crouching on the tall columns, which once stood near the stupa.[/toggle]\n\n[toggle title=”KALASH VALLEY” state=”close”]\n\nOne of the major attractions of Chitral are the Kalash valleys- the home of the Kafir-Kalash or “Wearers of the Black Robes”, a primitive pagan tribe. Their ancestry is enveloped in mystery and is the subject of controversy. A legend says that five soldiers of the legions of Alexander of Macedonia settled in Chitral and are the progenitors of the Kafir-Kalash.\n\nOver 3,000-strong Kafir-Kalash live in the valley of Birir, Bumburet and Rambur, south of Chitral. Bumburet, the largest and the most picturesque valley of the Kafir-Kalash , is 40 kms. from Chitral and is connected by a jeep-able road. Birir, 34 kms. away is accessible by a jeep-able road. Rambur is 32 kms from Chitral.The Kalash women wear black gowns of coarse cloth in summer and hand-spun wool dyed in black in winter. Their picturesque headgear is made of woolen black material decked out with cowry shells, buttons and crowned with a large coloured feather.The Kalash are fun loving people who love music and dancing particularly on occasion of their religious festival like Joshi Chilinjusht (14th & 15th May-spring), Phool (20th – 25th September) and Chomas (18th to 21st December for a week).[/toggle]\n\n[toggle title=”SHOGRAN” state=”close”]\n\nThis location finishes a league apart. Along the standards of valleys, one may not find anything like Shogran. It opens an array of awe-inspiring features, from flora and fauna to primeval surroundings, making it a heart of greenery in KPK. Shogran is hardly a destination for trekker and encourages constant sightseeing via local facilities provided here. In order to reach here safe and sound, heading from Islamabad and through Kawai is a viable option. However, one must be concerned about conditions of vehicles for commuting and also required to be driven by experienced personnel.
