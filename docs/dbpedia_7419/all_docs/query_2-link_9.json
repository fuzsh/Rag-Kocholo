        "text": "Reissued with updates to health information.\n\nReconsider travel to Pakistan due to terrorism. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.\n\nDo not travel to:\n\nBalochistan province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to terrorism and kidnapping.\n\nThe immediate vicinity of the India-Pakistan border and the Line of Control due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict.\n\nCountry Summary: Terrorist groups continue to plot attacks in Pakistan. Terrorism and ongoing violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian, as well as local military and police, targets. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities. Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past.\n\nTerrorist attacks continue across Pakistan, with most occurring in Balochistan and KP, including the former FATA. Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nPakistan’s security environment remains fluid sometimes changing with little or no notice. There are greater security resources and infrastructure in the major cities, particularly Islamabad, and security forces in these areas may be more readily able to respond to an emergency compared to other areas of the country. While threats still exist, terrorist attacks occur less frequently in major urban areas than other parts of Pakistan.\n\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security environment. Travel by U.S. government personnel within Pakistan is restricted, and additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel outside of U.S. diplomatic facilities may occur at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.\n\nThe U.S. Consulate General in Peshawar is unable to provide any consular services to U.S. citizens.\n\nRead the country information page for additional information on travel to Pakistan.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Pakistan:\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nRemain aware of your surroundings and local events.\n\nVary travel routes and timing, especially for routine trips.\n\nBe cognizant of your surroundings, particularly around public markets, restaurants, government and military institutions, and other locations.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive security alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nReview the Country Security Report for Pakistan.\n\nU.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergencies. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nBalochistan Province – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nDo not travel to Balochistan province. Active terrorist groups, including an active separatist movement, have conducted deadly terrorist attacks against civilians, religious minorities, government offices, and security forces.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nKP Province, including the former FATA – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nDo not travel to KP province, which includes the former FATA. Active terrorist and insurgent groups routinely conduct attacks against civilians, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government offices, and security forces. These groups historically have not discriminated between government officials and civilians. Assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, including the targeting of polio eradication teams and Government of Pakistan security service (police and military) personnel.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nVicinity of Line of Control – Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nDo not travel to the India-Pakistan border, including the Line of Control. Militant groups are known to operate in the area. India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border. The only official Pakistan-India border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the province of Punjab between Wagah, Pakistan, and Atari, India. Travelers are advised to confirm the status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel. An Indian visa is required to enter India, and no visa services are available at the border.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nThe Government of Pakistan requires all travelers age 12 and over to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nAll travelers are subject to random COVID-19 testing at all points of entry/exit. This policy is in effect until further notice and affects all international airports. U.S. citizen travelers are not exempt from this requirement and may be tested for COVID-19.\n\nThose testing positive for COVID-19 with the rapid test at the point of entry to Pakistan will then have a sample taken for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and be given home isolation instructions. Travelers should not expect to be returned to their previous destination, nor quarantined at the Port of Entry/Exit.\n\nRequirements for entry and exit:\n\nValid passport\n\nValid Pakistani visa\n\nDual nationals only: National Identity Cards for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP)\n\nObtain your visa at the Pakistani Embassy or a Consulate prior to initiating travel to Pakistan. Visit the Embassy of Pakistan website for the most current visa information, and please understand that the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Pakistan cannot assist you with Pakistani visa issues.\n\nAll U.S. government employees and immediate family members on U.S. government orders must follow appropriate procedures for official and personal travel to Pakistan. All official U.S. government travel requests must be submitted via the normal country clearance process and will be limited to mission-critical travel only. U.S. government employees wishing to conduct unofficial travel to Pakistan must contact the appropriate office in their home agency to determine whether there are any limitations or restrictions. Official U.S. government travelers must be aware that operational and personal security policies for official U.S. government personnel change frequently.\n\nDual Nationals: Be aware that different visa requirements may apply if you hold both U.S. and Pakistani citizenship. For more information see the Embassy of Pakistan’s information regarding National Identity Cards for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) and Pakistan Origin Cards (POC)\n\nU.S. citizens are subject to the local laws of the foreign countries they visit or reside in. If you travel to Pakistan on a NICOP or POC card, you will be considered a citizen of Pakistan, which may limit the amount of assistance and communication we can provide should you be arrested. For more information see Government of Pakistan Directorate General of Immigration and Passports.\n\nYou must obtain advance permission from local or federal authorities to travel in:\n\nProvince of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)\n\nVarious districts in Azad Kashmir\n\nProvince of Balochistan\n\nStay in compliance with Pakistani immigration regulations. If you overstay your visa or violate the terms, you may be detained, arrested, fined, and/or imprisoned. For further details see the Ministry of Interior website or call +92-51-920-7290.\n\nKeep copies of your U.S. passport data page, Pakistani visa or ID card, and Pakistan immigration entry stamp with you at all times. Consider downloading these documents to your mobile phone in case of emergency.\n\nVaccinations: With the exception of a COVID-19 vaccination, no routine vaccines are required when entering Pakistan from the United States, but proof of polio vaccination within one year may be required to exit Pakistan. See the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for recommended vaccinations and health tips for travel to Pakistan. For further updates, contact the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination, telephone: +92-51-910-7307, or email: contact@dra.gov.pk.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Pakistan.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction, and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nTerrorism: Violent extremist groups within Pakistan continue to seek opportunities to attack locations where U.S. citizens and other Westerners are known to congregate or visit, including:\n\nHigh-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)\n\nGovernment facilities\n\nSchools and universities\n\nShopping malls and markets\n\nHotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by Westerners and tourists\n\nPublic transportation hubs/stations\n\nMinority neighborhoods\n\nOutdoor recreation areas.\n\nTerrorists also target Pakistani officials, government facilities, security forces, and religious minorities.\n\nWe recommend you limit the frequency of travel and minimize the duration of trips to public markets, restaurants, and other public locations.\n\nAttacks have included armed assaults on heavily guarded sites, including Pakistani military and police installations, and airports. Primary tactics of terrorists include suicide operations, shootings, and bombings (including vehicle-borne explosives and improvised explosive devices), while other actions include but are not limited to assassinations, carjackings, kidnappings, and assaults. The Government of Pakistan maintains heightened security measures, particularly in major cities, and these measures can vary from day to day. However, the U.S. government is aware of narcotics smuggled onto flights from Pakistan, which may indicate broader security vulnerabilities at Pakistani airports.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy and Consulates regularly assess security situations and restrict the movements of official personnel as necessary. Depending on ongoing security assessments, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates sometimes place areas such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls, and restaurants off-limits to U.S. government personnel under Chief of Mission (COM) security responsibility. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates prohibit personnel under COM security responsibility from using public transportation or taxi services. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates also prohibit such personnel from visiting houses of worship.\n\nOfficial U.S. government personnel visiting Pakistan are authorized to stay overnight in certain local hotels in Islamabad, and some other areas of the country. Avoid hotels that do not apply stringent security measures. Depending on ongoing security assessments, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates sometimes place areas such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls, and restaurants off-limits to official U.S. government personnel on official travel/orders.\n\nFollow media coverage of local events and maintain good situational awareness and operational security wherever you travel in Pakistan. If you feel that your life is in danger in Pakistan, we advise you to report the threat to local police authorities and consider immediately changing locations or departing Pakistan.\n\nFor more information, see our Terrorism page.\n\nCrime: All travelers are advised to dress conservatively, with arms and legs covered, and to avoid walking alone. We recommend avoiding travel on the streets late at night. Urban crime can be organized or opportunistic and conducted by individuals or groups. It can include fraud, theft, robbery, carjacking, assault, and burglary. Incidents of crime and levels of violence are higher in low-income residential and congested commercial areas but are seen in wealthier areas as well. Pickpocketing, theft, and larceny are common on buses and trains at all hours of the day.\n\nTake precautions to avoid crime, including:\n\nLocking home and vehicle doors\n\nVarying routes and schedules\n\nKeeping bags or valuables under your legs away from passing vehicle traffic and ensuring that bag straps are not visible\n\nTraveling in groups\n\nBeing accompanied by someone with the ability to speak the local language if you travel outside urban areas\n\nCarrying your mobile phone\n\nIf you are assaulted, flee to a safe area and report the situation to local authorities by going directly to a police station or dialing 15.\n\nDemonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to local, national, or international current events, including on politically significant holidays.\n\nDemonstrations can be unpredictable; avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.\n\nPast demonstrations have turned violent.\n\nCheck local media for updates and traffic advisories.\n\nDemonstrations, political rallies, or large religious gatherings intended to be peaceful can become confrontational and possibly escalate into violence. We advise U.S. citizens to avoid areas where large crowds of any kind gather. U.S Embassy and Consulate personnel are routinely instructed to avoid areas of any demonstration. During demonstrations or periods of civil unrest, the Pakistani government has in the past disabled cellular telephone and internet service, making it difficult for individuals to contact each other or the U.S. Embassy or Consulates.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General generally do not message or post information about routine demonstrations but will disseminate known information regarding demonstrations or unrest that pose a potentially specific threat to U.S. citizens, including U.S. government personnel in country.\n\nCelebratory gunfire may occur at any time but is most likely to occur during wedding celebrations, which are frequent from October to May, and on holidays such as New Year’s Eve. Although the likelihood of being struck is remote, falling rounds can cause injury or death.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.\n\nVictims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\n\nReport crimes to the local police at 15 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(92)(51) 201-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\n\nPolice responsiveness varies widely, and crimes often go unsolved or unprosecuted.\n\nDual U.S-Pakistani nationals may not be recognized as U.S. citizens by local authorities and may be treated as Pakistani nationals by the police and the courts.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nHelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nAssist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\nContact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nProvide a list of local attorneys\n\nProvide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.\n\nProvide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nHelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nReplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or the Consulates in Karachi or Lahore for assistance.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not regularly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage\n\nCriminal Penalties: U.S. citizens are subject to the local laws of the foreign countries they visit or reside in. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. The U.S. government does not intervene with local authorities or advocate for particular outcomes on behalf of private individuals in legal matters.\n\nFurthermore, certain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States even if they are not illegal under the local laws. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nIt is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings or structures, particularly sensitive places like military installations, cantonments, and nuclear sites, but the law on this subject is vague and applied inconsistently.\n\nIt is illegal to import alcohol into Pakistan without prior coordination with the government and even then, it is permissible only under very specific circumstances. Travelers entering Pakistan with alcohol face potentially severe penalties. Additionally, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could result in imprisonment and other severe penalties.\n\nPenalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Pakistan are severe, and those convicted can expect lengthy imprisonment, heavy fines, and possible capital punishment.\n\nExit controls, or bans on departing the country, are frequently used as a condition of bail.\n\nCivil Matters: The Embassy often receives reports of property disputes and cannot become involved in civil matters.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nPakistani law enforcement authorities will typically not notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulates if a foreign citizen is arrested or detained, unless you request they do so. Pakistan’s regulations governing the travel of foreign diplomats and the procedures for gaining access to arrested individuals have delayed consular access in the past. In some cases, a consular officer may not be able to visit due to security-related travel restrictions.\n\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods: Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up the counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website and the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nInternational Volunteers:\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTQI+ Travelers: Same-sex sexual conduct is a criminal offense in Pakistan. While the government rarely prosecutes cases, society generally shuns LGBTQI+ persons, and violence and discrimination against LGBTQI+ persons occur frequently.\n\nThe penalty for same-sex relations is a fine, imprisonment (sentences ranging from two years to life imprisonment), or both. No laws protect against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics, and LGBTQI+ persons rarely reveal their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression.\n\nSee our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers with Disabilities: Even in major cities, accessibility for persons with physical disabilities is difficult. Pakistani law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is unevenly enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Do not expect public transportation, lodging, communication/information, or general infrastructure in Pakistan to have the same accessibility standards found in the United States. The availability of rental, repair, and replacement parts for equipment and devices is limited, especially outside major population areas. Services for persons with disabilities may also be limited outside the largest cities.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General often receive reports of U.S. citizens subjected to domestic violence, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, and forced marriage in Pakistan. There are also cases of individuals having their own and their children’s passports confiscated by spouses, parents, or other family members and having their freedom of movement severely restricted. Local police are not consistently responsive to reports of such cases. Nonetheless, if you find yourself in a life-threatening situation, you are encouraged to call the police immediately and follow up with a call to the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. We can sometimes connect you with a Pakistani non-governmental organization that may be able to provide assistance.\n\nIf you are victimized overseas, you may be entitled to receive compensation for counseling and/or other services such as relocation back to the United States. For further information, visit the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women.\n\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime committed in Pakistan\n\nSee our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nThe Government of Pakistan requires travelers age 12 and over be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pakistan reports Pakistan has endemic Wild Polio Virus. The government of Pakistan requires polio vaccination for some longer stays. Healthcare facilities and infrastructure is poor, especially outside major cities. Travelers are advised to have medevac insurance, to include repatriation of remains. Both medevacs and repatriations of remains for non-Pakistani citizens require Pakistani government permission.\n\nBasic medical care is available in major Pakistani cities but is limited in rural areas. Facilities in cities vary in quality and range of services and may be below U.S. standards; facilities in rural areas are consistently below U.S. standards. Medical facilities require pre-payment for services, and most do not accept credit cards.\n\nEffective emergency response to personal injury and illness is virtually non-existent in most of Pakistan. Ambulances are few, lack medical equipment, and are not necessarily staffed by medical personnel.\n\nIf you are hospitalized, a friend or family member will be expected to attend to your basic needs. There is generally no nursing staff or equivalent. For this reason, it is recommended never to travel alone to Pakistan. Outside major cities, English is not spoken by most medical providers and hospitals.\n\nPakistani hospital officials will typically not notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulates if a foreign citizen is hospitalized. Even if made aware of a medical situation, in some cases, a consular officer may not be able to visit due to travel restrictions.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals. However, we do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\n\nWe highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health webpage and general Traveler Advice for Pakistan.\n\nA CDC Level 1 Travel Health Notice regarding extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid in Pakistan is in place. Review the Travel Health Notice Typhoid.\n\nA CDC Level 1 Travel Health Notice regarding global increase in the number of cases of measles including in Pakistan is in place. Review the Travel Health Notice Measles.\n\nA CDC Level 2 Travel Health Notice regarding global polio is in place. ReviewTravel Health Notice Polio.\n\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\n\nTuberculosis\n\nThere is a risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other communicable diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV, in Pakistan. Travelers are urged to use the same cautionary and protective health measures they would in their own country. For emergency services in Pakistan, dial 15.\n\nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\n\nMedical Insurance: Travelers to Pakistan should obtain supplemental insurance to cover possible medical evacuation and repatriation of remains. If you plan to engage in high-risk outdoor activities in Pakistan, it is essential that you engage the services of a travel risk and crisis management provider.\n\nCare providers in Pakistan do not accept insurance. With the exception of State and military hospitals, providers will require payment before treatment. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\n\nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPharmaceuticals:\n\nVisitors and foreign residents should bring sufficient supplies of prescription and commonly used over-the-counter medications. Many U.S.-brand medications are not available, there is a high incidence of fake pharmaceuticals, and the quality of locally produced medications is uneven.\n\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Government of Pakistan to ensure the medication is legal in Pakistan.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information.\n\nFurther health information:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nAir Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\n\nAir pollution is a significant environmental problem across Pakistan. Throughout the country, air quality varies considerably by city and fluctuates greatly depending on the season and local weather patterns. We encourage you to consult with your doctor prior to travel and consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. It is typically at its worst during the winter in Pakistan. Anyone who travels to areas where pollution levels are high is at risk. People at the greatest risk from pollution exposure include:\n\nInfants, children, and teens;\n\nPeople over 65 years of age;\n\nPeople with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema;\n\nPeople with heart disease; and\n\nPeople who work or are active outdoors.\n\nAir quality data for major cities in Pakistan can be found on the U.S. Embassy’s website.\n\nWater Quality\n\nThroughout Pakistan, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.\n\nSanitation in most restaurants is inadequate. Diarrheal illnesses are common. Travelers to Pakistan are at risk for other infectious diseases as well. More information about these illnesses and how to protect against them can be found on the CDC webpage for Pakistan\n\nAdventure Travel: Pakistan’s mountains and glaciers make it a tempting destination for adventure enthusiasts. Despite the best efforts of local authorities, assisting visitors lost or injured in such remote areas can be difficult. In recent years, several U.S. citizens, including expert climbers, have lost their lives while climbing in the Karakoram mountain range, where rescue missions are often difficult or impossible to execute. Costs for emergency rescues start at $15,000, and payment is required prior to commencement of a search operation.\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel.\n\nAltitude: Some areas in Pakistan, especially K2 (Mount Godwin-Austen) in the Karakorum mountain range in the Gilgit-Baltistan region, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Travel to High Altitudes.\n\nRoad Conditions and Safety:While in Pakistan, you will encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Road infrastructure outside major cities is subject to weather and poor maintenance. The information below about Pakistan is provided for general reference only, and it might vary in a particular location or circumstance.\n\nTraffic Laws: Traffic in Pakistan moves on the left; the opposite of U.S. traffic. Roads are crowded, drivers are often aggressive and poorly trained, and many vehicles, particularly large trucks and buses, are poorly maintained. Local drivers may drive head-on in your lane of traffic if they believe it helps them get to their destination more quickly. Animals, horse carts, bicyclists, and pedestrians can pose roadside hazards in some areas. Roads, including most major highways, also suffer from poor maintenance and often have numerous potholes, sharp drop-offs, and barriers that are not sign-posted. Drivers should exercise extreme caution when traveling at night by road, since many vehicles do not have working headlights or dimmers, and many roads are not illuminated or signed. We recommend driving with experienced local drivers or guides.\n\nPublic Transportation: We recommend travelers remain cautious if using trains, taxis, and other forms of public transportation or online ride hailing services. For security reasons, U.S. government personnel are prohibited from using all forms of public transportation. See the Safety and Security section above.\n\nSee our Road Safety page for more information. Visit the website of Pakistan’s national tourist office and Pakistan’s national highway authority.\n\nAviation Safety Oversight: As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Pakistan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA’s safety assessment page.\n\nMaritime Travel: Mariners planning travel to Pakistan should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts. Information may also be posted to the U.S. Coast Guard homeport website, and the NGA broadcast warnings website."
