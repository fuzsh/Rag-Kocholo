The Federal Ministry of Health (MoH) has been dissolved and now the overall responsibility for health services policy direction and planning has been devolved to the provinces. Government responsibility for health aid coordination is now under the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination.\n\nAs of August 2019, we had located 20 of the 30 indicators for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Please see the table below for more details on each indicator.\n\n** Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Outdated\n\nâ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Available but percentage unknown\n\nThe table below presents more information on each indicator.
