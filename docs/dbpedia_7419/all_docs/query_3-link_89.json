        "text": "Crossing the Khyber has always been something of an adventure. Even in peacetime, this was a fairly wild region where banditry and tribal warfare were part of local history and almost every adult male went armed. Today, with the region in the center of an ongoing armed conflict, it is clearly far too dangerous for most.\n\nThe area is inhabited by Pathans or Pashtuns, rather fierce Pashto-speaking hill tribes. On the map, it was a border region of the British Raj and is now part of Pakistan, but neither the British nor the Pakistani government have ever fully controlled it; Pathan tribal chiefs run everything. Pashtun territory spans the border. 60% of them live in Pakistan, 40% in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, they are the largest ethnic group at 40-odd% of the population and have often dominated government and business.\n\nThe Pashtuns have twice defeated the greatest armies of their day. When Alexander the Great wanted to cross the pass, he could not manage it until he bribed some Pashtuns to assist him against others. Later the pass was the border of the British Raj; Britain fought several wars in the area and never completely subdued it. In the first Afghan war (1839-1842), at the height of British power in Queen Victoria's reign, a force of 16,000 (4500 soldiers plus grooms, cooks, etc.) went in and one man came out alive. Flashman is a fine historical novel about the campaign.\n\nPashtuns were also recruited into the British military, where many of them were excellent soldiers. There were several famous regiments, mainly cavalry, that were entirely Pathan except for the British officers. Today, the Pakistani military includes many Pashtuns.\n\nThe Pashtuns provided most of the adherents of Taliban. That movement originated in Pakistan and only later — with help from the CIA and Pakistani Intelligence, who saw it as a counter to Mujahideen warlord power — took over Afghanistan. Among its strongest influences are the traditional Pashtun code of ethics, Pashtunwali, and the Deobandi branch of Islam. Deobandi is a fundamentalist Sunni movement emphasizing Shari'a Law which arose in India in the 19th century and is now common among Pashtuns. At one time it was heavily funded by Saudi Arabia because it resembles their own Wahhabi style of Islam and was seen as a counter to the influence of Shi'a Iran, especially in Afghanistan.\n\nSince 1980, Pashtuns have been fighting Russians, various other Afghans, American and allied forces, the Pakistani army, and sometimes each other. Many — both pro and anti-Taliban, and on both sides of the border — are still (2019) fiercely resisting various efforts by US and allied forces and/or the Afghan and Pakistani governments to control their area."
