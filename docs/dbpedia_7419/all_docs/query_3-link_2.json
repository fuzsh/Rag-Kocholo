        "text": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa - The land of the Pashtuns, Pakistan's smallest province by land area but hosting unbelievably beautiful landscapes, drawing adventurers and explorers from all over .\n\nThis is a weekly series in which I share some information about each of the regions in Pakistan and share a specialty recipe from the area.\n\nThis week, we'll be concluding this series with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nLocation\n\nThe province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, often abbreviated to KP or KPK, is located in the northwest of Pakistan. It borders Afghanistan, the Islamabad Capital Territory, the provinces of Punjab and Balochistan, and the Pakistani-administered territories of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nKP is is the smallest province by land area and third largest by population (17,9% of the national population).\n\nThe Provincial Capital is Peshawar. Other major cities in KP are Mardan, Kohat and Abbottabad.\n\nEtymology\n\nKhyber is the major pass between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and 'Pakhtun' refers to the major ethnic group of the region, so the name means 'The Khyber side of the land of the Pashtuns'.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa was formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). This name was given by the British when the area was established as a province, naming the province after its literal geographic location in British India (very boring, I know!).\n\nOnly in 2010 was the province renamed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with the consensus that other ethnicities in Pakistan had their province named after them i.e. Punjabi. Sindhi and Balochi people. Note there was resistance to the name as other minor ethnicities, like Hindkowans, live in the province, hence 'Khyber' was included in the name to not single out Pashtuns.\n\nThe province is colloquially known by other names like:\n\nSarhad, deriving from province's Urdu name, meaning frontier\n\nGandhara, the ancient name for this area\n\nLahinda Punjab/Western Punjab (the province was part of Punjab during British Rule)\n\nAfghania\n\nPakhtunistan/Pashtunistan/ Pathanistan\n\nAbasin\n\nKhyber\n\nOr a combination of these and other names.\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the time of the Indus Valley Civilization (3300 - 1300 BC), the Khyber Pass provided a major trade route to merchants.\n\nThis region was part of the Gandharan Civilization (6th to 1st centuries BC), which is mentioned in the Mahabharata, the Hindu epic poem. The ancient region of Gandhara comprises the modern day Kabul, Peshawara Swat and Taxila areas (northwest Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan). The region was known to be a great center of learning, being rich in literature and home to ancient universities.\n\nDue to its location, a gateway to the subcontinent, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region has seen many invasions by those who sought the riches of India, starting with the Indo-Aryans in 1500 BC. The Persians conquered Gandhara in 6th century BC followed by the Alexander the Great in 327 BC. Although the reign of the Greeks and Macedonians was short, Greek culture influenced this region for a thousand years. After the Macedonians, Gandhara was part of the Mauryan empire. Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta (founder of Mauryan dynasty), made Buddhism the dominant religion of the region. After Ashoka's death, the Greeks held some power in the area but they were defeated by the Kushan clan of the Yuek Chi who were nomads from Central Asia.\n\nHindu Shahis were placed into power (843 AD) and with their rule, trade flourished with gems, textiles, perfumes and other goods exported west. The Shahis built Hindu temples in the region, the ruins of which can be found today in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There were struggles between the Hindu Shahis and Ghaznavids over the years but the Ghaznavids succeeded in 1001. This marked the beginning of the Islamic rule with many people converting to Islam and Hindu temples and Buddhist monasteries being looted and destroyed.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Ghaznavid rule the Delhi Sultanate Period emerged. Several Muslim dynasties ruled during this time: the Mamluk dynasty (1206–90), the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1413), the Sayyid dynasty (1414–51), and the Lodi dynasty (1451–1526).\n\nIn 1505, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa became part of the Mughal Empire. They were briefly challenged by Pashtun Emperor, Sher Shah Suri, who began the construction of the famous Grand Trunk Road, which links modern day Kabul in Afghanistan with Chittagong in Bangladesh. The Yusufzai and Afridi (Pashtun) tribes also revolted against the Mughals, In 1738, Peshawar was captured as part of the Persian invasion of the Mughal Empire under Nadir Shah. The area subsequently fell under the Afghan Durarani Empire, followed by the Sikh Empire under Ranjit Singh in 1818.\n\nIn 1849, the British took control after Second Anglo-Sikh War. Parts of the region were merged into the province of Punjab during the British rule. Local Pashtun tribes generally remained neutral or in support of the British mainly because they detested the Sikhs in contrast to other part of British India which rose up in revolt.\n\nThe region was still undefined in the late 19th century and claimed by the Kingdom of Afghanistan. In 1893, the British established a border with Afghanistan known as the Durand Line. The British separated the northwest portions of Punjab to form the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) in 1901. During the time of the independence and partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the British held a referendum, whether the province join India or Pakistan. Pashtun Nationalists were in favor of an independent state of Pashtunistan but the British refused this third option. Out of the two the majority voted in favor of Pakistan.\n\nThe princely states of Swat, Dir, Chitral and Amb were allowed to maintain certain autonomy after independence but were eventually merged into the province in 1969. During the 1960s and '70s, the region was part of the Hippie trail overland from Europe to India. As a result of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, millions of Afghans migrated to Pakistan mostly choosing to reside in NWFP.\n\nFollowing the attacks of 11 September 2001, the region has been a site of major conflict, militancy and terrorism. Armed conflict began in 2004 and there have been 50,000 Pakistani deaths since the war on terror with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa being the site of major conflict.\n\nIn 2010, the province was renamed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa succeeding the Northwest Frontier Province. More recently in 2018, the Federally Administered Tribal areas (FATA), a semi-autonomous tribal region, has been merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTopography & Climate\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa has mountain ranges (some of the tallest mountains outside the Himalayas), submontane areas and plains surrounded by hills. The mountains generally run from north to south, dividing the province from east to west.\n\nKP is divided into two geographic zones, the northern and southern zones:\n\nThe northern zone ranges from the Hindu Kush to the borders of the Peshawar basin. The climate of the northern zone is snowy and cold with heavy rainfall in winters. It has pleasant summers with moderate rainfall excluding the Capital Peshawar which is hot in summer.\n\nThe southern zone scopes from Peshawar to the Derajat Basin. It has hot summers with relatively cold winters with minimal rainfall.\n\nThe climate varies with elevation.

This region has seen a lot, and it breaks my heart what the people have been through over the years (and centuries) due to the strategic location of this region. Nevertheless they are strong and committed to their roots and traditions and I love that they are always willing to extend a helping hand and be hospitable, which is such a beautiful tradition to uphold! I really hope I get to visit one day and experience all the province has to offer!\n\nWith this, I'd also like conclude this series on Pakistani regional cuisine. These last few weeks have been eye-opening, heart-wrenching, healing and so enjoyable for me. I know I've just scratched the surface but that is what I needed to do for now, since I knew so little about this beautiful and complex land of my ancestors. I have learnt so much and I hope you have too. This has been a great way for me to get a better understanding of why things are the way they are, it's sparked a desire to visit some of these absolute gems and has given so much inspiration for new recipes to try out from all over the country! I hope you've enjoyed taking this journey with me!\n\nToro tyaro pase rana razi.\n\nAfter every darkness, there is light."
