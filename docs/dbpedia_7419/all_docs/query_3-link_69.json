It is now shown in Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa.svg.\n\nValentin Poposki, 28 June 2011\n\nPrevious Version\n\nby Arfan Hashmi, 23 May 2005\n\nThe previous version lacked the dove, placed the star and crescent inside the circle, and had the Roman letters NWFP on the ribbon.\n\nGovernor's Flag\n\nby Joe McMillan\n\nGovernor's House in Peshawar has three flagpoles, the center one a bit higher flying the Pakistani national flag. The one on the right was empty the day we were there, while that on the left flew a green flag with a device on the center in yellow. A former minister of the Northwest Frontier Province government told me that all Pakistani governors have green flags with the provincial emblem. However, I noted that the emblem on his business card (and seen at http://www.nwfp.pak.gov) was slightly different from that on the paper napkins at Governor's House. The governor's flag appeared to have a wreath encircling the emblem, and it made sense for the governor's flag to have the governor's seal on it, so I scanned the emblem on the image (above) from the napkin that I liberated from the house. The emblem shows Jamrud Fort at the bottom, the historic fortification at the Pakistani end of the Khyber Pass, mountains across the middle, and crossed sabers above the mountains. Above the circle surrounding the above design is the crescent and star.\n\nOn the minister's card, the crescent and star are inside the circle, taking the place of the swords, and the initials \"N.W.F.P.\" appear on a scroll at the bottom.\n\nJoe McMillan, 2 February 2002\n\nFrom the image one could conclude that the crescent points to hoist. Is that really so?\n\n≈Ωeljko Heimer, 2 February 2002\n\nI don't really know. The wind was very light and, as I say, I couldn't even tell absolutely for sure whether the emblem on the flag was as shown on the napkin or on the minister's card. So you'll have to take this as an approximation. There are flags in Pakistan, however, that have the crescent facing the hoist when it's part of a seal or similar emblem, such as the flags of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and of the Joint Staff Headquarters.\n\nJoe McMillan, 2 February 2002\n\nLakki Marwat\n\nSome of the flags of Lakki Marwat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan can be viewed at www.umarmarwat.com/lakki.\n\nSee also: Marwat flags\n\nTariq Saleem Marwat, 5 October 2003\n\nSangota Swat\n\nimage located by Vanja Poposki, 4 May 2022"
