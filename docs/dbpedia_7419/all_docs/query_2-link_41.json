THIS SEGEMENT STILL TO ABRUPT. I’m Adam Ellick, a reporter for the New York Times- And I knew MALALA before she was a star. Insert beat of nat I made two documentaries about Malala in 2009 - This is the backstory. It’s the story OF A YOUNG GIRL, her AMBITIOUS father, and the media- - and the role we all played in her rise- and in the tragedy that almost took her life. Credit: The Making of Malala By Adam B. Ellick and Gabe Johnson Oct 2013 Nat: mountain shots of swat valley, sequence leading into her home Mat: I love her. I really love. When she was born, I looked into her eyes. When we met, malala LIVED IN THE SWAT Valley- in NW Pakistan. WHICH WAS BEING OVERRUN BY THE TALIBAN. Malala was shy and quiet, she only spoke when spoken to, But when she answered, she was articulate and poised. NAT: CHANGE NAME OF YOUR FILM. She told me she wanted to be a doctor In the time I spent with Malala and her family, It was clear that her father, ziaudin, was the most influential person in her life. NAT: zia: // I have the greatest ever born in the world. I have the greatest daughter ever born in the world. (malala blushes) Zia was a self-made man a poet, an idealist. He was also a man of contradictions: He owned a girl’s school in a region where only one out of five girls are educated. yet his wife was illiterate, and because of their conservative culture, she would not take part in my documentary. Zia nat: All of the look after is done by the wife. Outside of the home for example: earning money, or doing job. That is done by the man. When I met him, Zia was scrambling to save the family business ... When I first met him, he was scrambling to save his business The weeks before, the Taliban made an announcement banning girls from going to school in swat valley. TALIBAN RADIO ADDRESS: “Otherwise, the guardians and the school will be responsible.” I had many discussions with my editors in NY, with a pak journalist colleague, and with Zia himself about whether this story might put the family in danger? Zia: if I die for it, there would be no better chance for me to die, better then this. Nat: fiery presser of zia Zia [however] was ALREADY A KNOWN as an activist in the region. ZIA: In the fight against terrorism, I can say for sure that the people in SWAT and Malakan have sacrificed more than any other place in the world. ZIA’S GAOL WAS TO GET THE PAK army to take on the Taliban IN SWAT. HE WAS QUICKLY AWARE OF how HIS TELEGENIC DAUGHTER could bolster his cause in the media. Malalal yousefiay...your name!!! zia: she is there to speak for the students especially, to speak for education and, uh, her role is very much powerful and effective in this regard. I admired Zia’s revolutionary zeal ZIA TO MALALA (pointing to the paper in her hand). “YOU IGORE THAT. YOU SHOULD SAY THIS.” But THE WAY HE pushed MALALA TO JOIN THE FIGHT sometimes reminded me of a parent Pushing their child to be the next tennis star or beauty pageant winner- Nat: malala at press, voice trails off, forgets her line. My first DOCUMENTARY, Class Dismissed, was released in Feb 2009- AND IT ENDED WITH MALALA’S APPEAL TO THE WORLD. Nat break - MALALA :This is our request to our world, save our school, save our world, save our Pakistan. Save our Swat. Nat: war A few months later, war broke out between the Pakistani army and the Taliban. MALALA PT2 Suddenly, there was huge firing and missiles, so we quickly get our clothes and I was weeping why we have to leave swat, what is our, we are innocent, what is our sin? A MILLION PEOPLE, Malala’s family INCLUDED — WERE forced into exile. It was pure chaos . Malala WENT WITH HER MOTHER AND BROTHER TO STAY WITH RELATIVES NEAR abbotbod. Nat: this is your new home? Yes Zia’s WENT SIX HOURS AWAY- TO THE regional cap"
