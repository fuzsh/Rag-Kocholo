        "text": "Pakistan—Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governance Program (KPG)\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) is Pakistan’s smallest province, but it ranks third in population and economic activity. KP’s relative vitality and diversity are offset by unstable public services and its vulnerability to militancy. The province, though, has seen incremental gains in stability in the past few years.\n\nThe Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governance Program (KPG) assisted the provincial government and civil society organizations to improve local government service and better serve citizens. It managed a mechanism for supporting activities that reinforced stability, counter extremism, and promoted democratic inclusiveness, including for women and other marginalized groups.\n\nSample Activities\n\nLeverage current KP government initiatives and systems with government taking the lead role.\n\nDeliver integrated assistance packages in areas such as training government units to improve services and accountability.\n\nImprove government’s publicizing of its successes, services, and opportunities available for its citizens—especially women and vulnerable groups—as well as its receptivity to community input.\n\nIncorporate a rigorous system for adaptive learning and management in areas such as grant making, procurement, operations, and monitoring and evaluation.\n\nSelect Results"
