        "text": "Introduction: Day to day atmospheric conditions of an area is referred to as weather, whereas, the statistical expression of weather events in an area over a period of minimum 30 years is called climate. Due to the global warming, weather across the globe has started changing from time to time. As a result, the climate change in different areas have taken rise. Pakistan is amongst the top ten countries that are likely to be affected by the climate change.\n\nStudy Objectives: This study focuses on highlighting the impacts of climate change on various sectors in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan. The research objectives of this report are (1) to explain, in simple words, the concept of climate change and other associated phenomena. (2) To identify the possible impacts of climate change in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (3) To highlight any possible adaptive and mitigatory measure that could minimize the impacts of climate change.\n\nMethodology: To achieve the aforementioned objectives, a detailed literature review was carried out using the keywords; climate change, impacts of climate change on forests, humans, agriculture, and water, climate change in KP, Climate change in Pakistan. The manuscripts were studied and then paraphrased to avoid plagiarism. This study is entirely based on the secondary data as it is based on review of published articles.\n\nConclusion and Recommendation: Amongst the most noticeable impacts are the seasonal shift and extreme weather events in the entire country, particularly in the KP. As a result, the agricultural productivity will decline, forests elevation up to 500 mm will occur. The surface and ground water bodies will be deteriorated and human behavioral changes like anger will increase. Therefore, there is need to cope this challenge by adopting anticipated approaches to combat the adversities."
