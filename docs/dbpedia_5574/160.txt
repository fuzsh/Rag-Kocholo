The Queen will mark her 63 years on the throne quietly today at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk.

She is set to become our longest-reigning monarch on September 9, taking the title from Queen Victoria, who served for 63 years, seven months, two days.

The Queen, 88, paid a visit yesterday to a charity in Dersingham, close to her Norfolk retreat, but will spend today privately as it also marks the death in 1952 of her father, King George VI.

He passed away at the age of 56 after suffering from lung cancer.

The Queen was just 25 at the time and was spending the night in the Treetops hotel in the Kenyan safari.

She immediately returned home to take over as Sovereign and was crowned 18 months later in Westminster Abbey.
