        "text": "The surprising and ancient royal connection\n\nDid you know that Tower Bridge was funded by the Bridge House Estates?\n\nMany of London’s bridges owe their existence and ongoing maintenance to this organisation and the man who created it in the thirteenth century, Peter de Colechurch. Aware of the cost of maintaining infrastructure, de Colechurch set up the fund to ensure (the original) London Bridge was looked after. This fund would later be known as the Bridge House Estates.\n\nThirteenth century England was a tumultuous place. One of the results of a long civil war was that five of the arches on London Bridge collapsed. The blame fell on the Queen, Eleanor of Provence, who was managing the Bridge House Estates fund at the time. (Some say that she is the ‘fair lady’ mentioned in the song ‘London Bridge is falling down’.)\n\nHer son, King Edward I, realised that without a bridge, London could not trade and with no trade, there would be no taxes. So, in 1282, he granted the City of London a Royal Charter, handing them management of the Bridge House Estates funds. Without this royal intervention, it’s likely that the City’s bridges as we know them would be very different.\n\nImages: Portrait, thought to be King Edward I.

Queen Victoria signed the Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) Act on 14 August 1885.\n\nLess than a year later, Queen Victoria’s son, the Prince of Wales (and future King Edward VII) laid the foundation stone to commemorate the start of the Bridge’s construction. The stone, located at the northern end of the Bridge, is decorated with the royal coat of arms and is engraved with the names of those present at the ceremony, including John Wolfe Barry and Horace Jones.\n\nOn 30 June 1894, the Prince of Wales returned to formally open Tower Bridge. This time he was accompanied by his wife, Princess Alexandra, and his son, the Duke of York (the future King George V). It was a celebration like no other, which took a whole week to tidy up after!\n\nImage: Prince of Wales opening the bascules. The Graphic, July 1894\n\nThe second Elizabethan era\n\nIn 1954, Her Late Majesty The Queen Elizabeth II finished her world tour with an unforgettable Bridge Lift – sailing through Tower Bridge on the Royal yacht with the words ‘welcome home’ on the walkways.\n\nAnd in 1977, to celebrate her Silver Jubilee, the Bridge was painted red, white and blue - it was originally chocolate brown, rumoured to have been Queen Victoria’s favourite colour.\n\nIn 2010, for the first time ever, a reigning monarch visited inside Tower Bridge. It was a truly amazing occasion for the Tower Bridge team. Her Late Majesty The Queen made the day particularly memorable by taking the time to speak to each member of the team, although none of them would ever tell you what she said to them!\n\nImage: Her Late Majesty The Queen visits Tower Bridge in 2010 © Clive Totman\n\nA new King and Queen\n\nThe coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla took place on 6 May 2023 at Westminster Abbey. Charles III ascended to the throne on 8 September 2022, upon the death of his mother, Her Late Majesty The Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe service at the Abbey was followed by a grand procession to Buckingham Palace. The royal family then appeared on the Palace’s balconies.\n\nThe festivities dominated London and culminated in a new bank holiday on Monday 8 May. Tower Bridge was lit up red, white and blue on Saturday 6 and Sunday 7 May. We celebrated the occasion with a commemorative ticket, colourful bunting, and crown and sash-making family activities.\n\nImage: Tower Bridge lit up for the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla ©Kate Green"
