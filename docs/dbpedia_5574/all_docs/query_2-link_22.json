At her Diamond Jubilee, in 2012, it had increased to 63.2 million.\n\nVICTORIA oversaw an empire, measuring a quarter of the globe, and some 400 million people.\n\nELIZABETH is head of state of the UK and 15 Commonwealth realms, with a combined population of about 139 million.\n\nVICTORIA made her first official visit to Ireland in 1849.\n\nELIZABETH has visited 116 countries on official trips, covering 43,618 miles in her coronation tour, in 1953.\n\nVICTORIA was given Â£385,000 a year by Parliament after taking the throne, later buying Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, and Balmoral Castle.\n\nELIZABETH is estimated to be worth Â£340m.\n\nVICTORIA's reign included 10 UK prime ministers. She outlived all but two.\n\nWilliam Gladstone was prime minister on no less than four occasions during her monarchy.\n\nELIZABETH has overseen 12 prime ministers.
