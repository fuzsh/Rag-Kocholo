        "text": "The Queen has thanked well-wishers at home and overseas for their \"touching messages of kindness\" as she becomes Britain's longest-reigning monarch.\n\nSpeaking in the Scottish Borders, the 89-year-old monarch said the title was \"not one to which I have ever aspired\".\n\nAt 17:30 BST she had reigned for 23,226 days, 16 hours and approximately 30 minutes - surpassing the reign of her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria.\n\nDavid Cameron said the service the Queen had given was \"truly humbling\".\n\nDressed in turquoise with her trusty black handbag at her side, the Queen spoke briefly to the gathered crowds earlier.\n\n\"Inevitably a long life can pass by many milestones - my own is no exception - but I thank you all and the many others at home and overseas for your touching messages of great kindness,\" she said.\n\nIn the day's main events:\n\nBusiness in the Commons was postponed for half an hour so that MPs, led by Mr Cameron, could pay tribute to the Queen.\n\nThe prime minster said she had been a \"rock of stability\" in an era when so much had changed, and her reign had been the \"golden thread running through three post-war generations\".\n\nHe said it was \"typical of the Queen's selfless sense of service\" that she thought today should be a normal day.\n\nActing Labour leader Harriet Harman said it was \"no exaggeration\" to say the Queen was \"admired by billions of people all around the world\".\n\nMinisters are to present the Queen with a bound copy of cabinet papers from the meeting in 1952 when Sir Winston Churchill's government approved the content of her first Queen's Speech.\n\nIn the House of Lords, leader Baroness Stowell said the Queen had served the country with \"unerring grace, dignity and decency\", adding: \"And long may she continue to do so\".\n\nThere have been glowing tributes and much talk about the significance of this moment. No such words were uttered by the subject of all the attention.\n\nShe undertook a run-of-the-mill engagement on a far from run-of-the-mill day. And in her brief remarks - her lengthy reign hasn't lessened her aversion to making speeches - she displayed some classic British understatement.\n\nOvertaking her great-great-grandmother wasn't something she'd ever aspired to, she said. She was simply the beneficiary of a long life.\n\nIn Scotland - and indeed in other parts of the United Kingdom - that life and her reign have been celebrated very publicly.\n\nPrivately, later, the Queen will mark the moment she enters the record books. Prince Philip will be with her - her husband of 67 years has been the one constant in a reign of sometimes dizzying change.\n\nOne of those prime ministers, Conservative Sir John Major, rejected any suggestion the Queen had been too passive as head of state: \"The monarchy wouldn't be as popular if they were part of politics - they're above and beyond it.\n\n\"But when the Queen meets her prime minister she has the opportunity to question, to ask, to counsel. Nobody knows and no prime minister is going to tell you exactly what happens at those meetings. So those who say she's been too passive, how can they possibly know?\"\n\nThe Queen is Head of the Commonwealth and sovereign of 15 Commonwealth realms in addition to the UK, and the organisation's Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma, sent his congratulations.\n\n\"As a symbol of continuity during decades of unprecedented change, and by drawing our people together in their rich diversity, Her Majesty has embodied all that is best in the Commonwealth,\" he said.\n\n\"With vision and dedication her example has encouraged successive generations of leaders and citizens to embrace the promise of the future.\""
