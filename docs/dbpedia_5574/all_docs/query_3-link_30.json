        "text": "It’s been 86 years since the United Kingdom crowned a king, so let’s take a moment to look back on George VI and his portrayals in movies and TV. Born Albert Frederick Arthur George and called “Bertie,” he was the second son of then-Prince George, Duke of York, and a great-grandchild of Queen Victoria. He succeeded to the throne after his elder brother Edward VIII abdicated, less than a year into his reign, so he could marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. Bertie himself was happily married to Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, and their eldest daughter was Queen Elizabeth II, mother of Charles, whose coronation is on May 6.\n\nGeorge VI’s place onscreen tends to be at two main points: his brother’s abdication crisis in 1936 and World War II, the later often with Winston Churchill. More recently, he’s popped up in relation to stories about a young Elizabeth (he died in 1952).\n\nThis king has only gotten a couple flicks that focus on his own story, which admittedly isn’t the most dramatic, but is interesting because of the national and world crises George VI endured and the legacy he passed on. He also just seemed like a nice, rather unassuming person, trying to do his best for others, an attitude that definitely carried on to his daughter.\n\nThere are a bunch of smaller appearances of King George VI on TV that I just can’t find images for, so they aren’t included. Here’s the highlights that I did discover.\n\nAndrew Ray in Crown Matrimonial (1974)\n\nJames Wilby in Bertie and Elizabeth (2002)\n\nMick Rose in Ike: Countdown to D-Day (2004)\n\nIain Glen in Into the Storm (2009)\n\nColin Firth in The King’s Speech (2010)\n\nLaurence Fox in W.E. (2011)\n\nSamuel West in Hyde Park on Hudson (2012)\n\nRupert Everett in A Royal Night Out (2015)\n\nJared Harris in The Crown (2016)\n\nJohn Sackville in Royal Wives at War (2016)\n\nJames Purefoy in Churchill (2017)\n\nJonathan Cullen in SS-GB (2017)\n\nBen Mendelsohn in Darkest Hour (2017)\n\nWhich onscreen version of George VI have you noticed?\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMore Frock Flicks"
