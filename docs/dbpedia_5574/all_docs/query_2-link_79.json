        "text": "Trains are not just any means of transport; even the British monarchy used them and continues to do so, especially when weather conditions are not conducive to air travel. Contrary to what some might think, the British royal train is neither particularly luxurious nor modern. It has remained without any significant modifications since 1977.\n\nFor a long time, the train was the primary means of transport for the British royal family during their travels. The inaugural royal train journey took place on June 13, 1842, and lasted just 25 minutes. Queen Victoria was the first monarch to use the train. At her behest, the train was not allowed to exceed a speed of 64 kilometers per hour. Every two hours, the train had to stop to allow Queen Victoria to use the restroom. As the train passed through slums, the queen would draw the blinds to avoid being seen.\n\nThis unique mode of transport also served the late Queen Elizabeth II, who was the longest-reigning monarch of the monarchy. The special train was definitely not the most luxurious or modern, but it remains one of the rarest. It was utilized by the entire royal family for various official trips around England when the weather was unsuitable for air travel.\n\nThe compartments in this special carriage, called saloons, included a bedroom, bathroom, and waiting room for Queen Elizabeth, while the late Duke of Edinburgh's saloon was similarly furnished but also had a kitchen. Additionally, there was a room used for business meetings. The train's schedule was carefully planned to avoid disrupting regular train services.\n\nThe train had a maximum of nine carriages, which were used in normal traffic when not needed by the royal family. In 1977, the carriages were modified and renovated to meet all the needs of Queen Elizabeth II. Since then, they have not undergone any further modifications. Interestingly, the annual operation of the train still costs over a million euros.\n\nInteresting Facts About the Train of the British Royal Family:"
