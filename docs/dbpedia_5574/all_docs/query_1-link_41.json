        "text": "JUMP TO\n\nSchedule of Classes\n\nHISTORY DEPARTMENT SYLLABUS ATTACHMENT\n\nHOW TO SUCCEED IN THIS CLASS\n\nWelcome to Tudor England!\n\nThis course will introduce you to the political, social, and cultural history of England from the Wars of the Roses to the end of the reign of Elizabeth I (1455-1603). We will be focusing on social history in this class, with a special emphasis on examining how people theorized the social order and attempted to naturalize and maintain the social hierarchy. We will also cover the interaction between economic and social movements, how order was imposed after a change of dynasty, how the Tudor monarchs used political propaganda to legitimize their rule and undermine their enemies, the unfolding of the English Reformation, English literature and culture, witch beliefs and witch trials in Early Modern England, and the role of political rebellion in shaping this period of English history.\n\nThis course carries a W credit.\n\nCourse Format:\n\nThis will be a synchronous, in-person class. I will be recording the in-person lectures using Panopto in case you miss any lectures or need to review them, but my expectation is that we will all meet in class for lecture unless you are ill (then please stay home). If you have to miss section, you should let your TA know by email. Also, just be aware that there are sometimes glitches with Panopto recordings and that you can't really rely on them as a perfect substitute for coming to class. I'll do my best to ensure that all of the recordings have good audio and clear video, but I can't always control what happens.\n\nI will also post my Powerpoints to the course website AFTER each lecture. You can find them under the Files tab in the Powerpoints folder.\n\nIf I need to cancel class due to illness, I'll notify you through a Canvas course announcement. Please make sure you check your UW email on a regular basis, since all important class announcements will be sent to it.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nThis class focuses on developing your critical thinking and argumentative writing skills, under the guise of teaching you about Tudor history. In addition to acquiring an understanding of the historical development of England during the Tudor period, you will learn to:\n\nAnalyze primary sources for the historical evidence they provide.\n\nConstruct persuasive, historical arguments using evidence from primary sources.\n\nEvaluate competing historical arguments using primary and secondary sources.\n\nAppreciate the distinction between the evidence found in primary sources and historians' interpretations of that evidence.\n\nAppreciate the role of contingency in historical events.\n\nInstructor Contact Info:\n\nProfessor Urbanski (she/her)\n\nOffice:\n\nOffice Hours:\n\nEmail: urbanski@uw.edu\n\nTA:\n\nOffice:\n\nOffice Hours:\n\nEmail:\n\nYou can email us to make appointments or for quick questions, but you should come to see us during office hours or after lecture for anything that requires more than a one or two sentence response.\n\nOffice hours are periods that we set aside specifically to meet with our students. You should come to office hours if you need help with an assignment, have questions that require a detailed response, or just want to chat about the course, medieval stuff, monsters, or cats. You can even come to office hours with a friend from class if you like.\n\nWe check our email regularly during normal business hours (M-F between 8 am and 5 pm).\n\nWe will reply to emails within a reasonable time-frame (within 24 hours during the week and by the afternoon of the next business day for emails received over the weekend or on holidays).\n\nRequired Books:\n\nAlec Ryrie, The Age of Reformation (textbook; you may use either the first or second edition)\n\nGeorge Cavendish and William Roper, Two Early Tudor Lives\n\nAnthony Fletcher and Dairmaid McCulloch, Tudor Rebellions (fifth or sixth edition)\n\nAll other required readings are PDFs embedded in the schedule of classes below.\n\nWe will be reading all of the required books. I have put one copy of each of them on 2 hour reserve in Odegaard, but in a class this large it will be difficult to do all of your reading from the reserve copies. I know that cost is a real concern for many of you, so keep in mind that you can also purchase used copies of all of these books either at the University book store or through Amazon.\n\nRecommended Books:\n\nJohn Guy, The Tudors: A Very Short Introduction (this is a great resource if you have no or very limited knowledge of the Tudor period)\n\nJules R. Benjamin, A Student's Guide to History (this is a really helpful guide to the study of history, evaluating and analyzing historical evidence, writing history papers, and taking history exams)\n\nRequirements:\n\nReading:\n\nAll readings should be completed BEFORE the class for which they are assigned. You should bring the reading assigned for discussion section to class with you on Fridays.\n\nLectures:\n\nYou REALLY need to attend lecture if you want to do well in this course. Lectures will not just repeat material covered in the textbook, but will introduce new material that will appear on our exams. I will also be building upon information given in lecture, and you will have difficulty understanding later lectures if you miss too many of the earlier ones.\n\nLectures will be in-person but I will be recording them so you can review them or catch up on any you missed. They will be posted under Panopto Recordings.\n\nI will also post my lecture Powerpoint for the day after each class meeting (under Files in the folder marked Powerpoints).\n\nSection:\n\nSections are an essential part of this course – they are not optional. They are where you will discuss our primary and secondary sources, learn how to analyze those sources, and learn how to construct your own historical arguments. We will also focus on teaching students how to write a history paper in the first few weeks of section. You should come to section having done the reading for the week and prepared to contribute to discussion. You should bring the reading with you.\n\nYour performance and assignments in section will count for 20% of your final grade: on a 4.0 scale, that is .8. That is a lot. It means that if you earn a 4.0 on every paper and exam, but earn a 0.0 in section, your final grade in the class will only be a 3.2.\n\n* Everyone will be allowed to miss one section and one weekly writing assignment without penalty.\n\nExams and Papers:\n\nThis course requires two exams and two 5-6 page argumentative papers.\n\nThe midterm and final exam will focus on testing your knowledge of material from lecture and our textbook. The exams are intended to test you on information you learned IN THIS CLASS, not what you may have learned in another class, or from Wikipedia or any other website, so plan to come to lecture and do the reading if you want to do well. The midterm will cover all material up to the midterm, and the final will cover all material from the midterm to the end of the class.\n\nStudy guides for the midterm and final will be posted on the course website at least one week in advance of the exam.\n\nExams will be administered through Canvas; both the midterm and final will be open for two days - you can choose when to take the exam within the open period.\n\nOne of the major goals of this course is to help you improve your ability to read and analyze historical sources and to write persuasive historical essays. It is a fundamental premise of this class that writing is a means of learning; to that end, we will be writing two papers focused on analyzing primary sources that we have read for section. Paper topics, detailed instructions, and resources for help with the writing process will be posted under Assignments.\n\nPapers will be submitted through Canvas.\n\nGrading: (grades for the course will be posted in the Canvas Grades page; you can find the link to Grades in the column on the left of your screen)\n\n15% - Midterm Exam\n\n20% - First 5-6 page paper\n\n25% - Second 5-6 page paper\n\n20% - Final Exam\n\n10% - Participation in Section\n\n10% - Weekly Writing Assignments\n\nYou must complete both papers and both exams in order to pass this course.\n\nLate Assignments and Extensions\n\nAll assignments are due by the stated date and time. No late work will be accepted unless an extension request is made prior to the assignment deadline. I have a “no questions asked\" policy for extensions. If you are asking for an extension, I will presume you have good reasons and will grant the extension as long as it is:\n\nsubmitted to me by email (urbanski@uw.edu) before the due date/time, and\n\nyou tell me in your email when you will turn in the work (it should be within two days at most unless there are extenuating circumstances)\n\nIf you submit frequent requests for extensions, I will reach out to see what is going on and reserve the right to grant them or not.\n\nAny assignments that are submitted late (i.e. after the original due date/time if you have not received an extension, or after your extension expires if you have received one) will be automatically docked 5% per day (including weekends and holidays).\n\nGrades will be assigned as percentages on individual assignments and exams and converted to the 4.0 scale for the final course grade.\n\n4.0 = 95-100%\n\n3.5 = 90%\n\n2.5 = 80%\n\n1.5 = 70%\n\n0.7 = 62% (lowest passing grade)\n\nACADEMIC STANDARDS AND CONDUCT\n\nHonesty, ethical conduct, and academic integrity are expected in this course. Academic integrity includes a commitment to not engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception. Acts of dishonesty include cheating or copying, plagiarizing, submitting another person's work as one’s own, submitting AI generated work as one's own, using Internet sources without citation, having another student take your exam or working together with other students on your exam, tampering with the work of another student, facilitating other students’ acts of academic dishonesty, etc.\n\nUnless I specify otherwise, all assignments and exams are to be completed by the student alone, without inappropriate assistance of any kind (including the use of AI programs like ChatGPT).\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI):\n\nTwo of the main goals of this course are to hone your critical thinking skills and your argumentative writing skills. These skills are incredibly important for getting through life. In fact, they're far more important than your ability to recall things like what year the Norman Conquest happened. Relying on AI to produce assignments for you not only deprives you of valuable opportunities to practice these skills, the technology tends to turn out papers and writing assignments that are bland, forgettable, lacking in specific detail, and slightly off-topic. In other words, using AI deprives you of the chance to think for yourself, and it won't even get you a very good grade. It is also important to remember that text generators like ChatGPT are sometimes wrong, and that they are not familiar with our textbook or my lectures. If an AI tool gives you incorrect information and you use it on an assignment, you will be held accountable for it.\n\nYou should never use AI as a substitute for your own thought or your own writing, but there are two circumstances in which you are allowed to use AI in this class (your other professors will likely have very different policies, so do not assume that my policies will apply in your other classes).\n\nThe use of AI is allowed in this class under the following circumstances only (any other use is prohibited):\n\n1. You may use AI to provide you with explanations of concepts or to organize your notes. I would much prefer that you ask me for clarification if you are having trouble with any of the material in this course, and I am happy to answer questions after class or during my office hours, but I recognize that some of you will want to use AI for this. However, if the AI gives you incorrect information and you use that information on an assignment or exam, you will be held accountable for it.\n\n2. You are allowed to use tools like Grammarly or Quillbot to proofread or edit writing that you have produced yourself. Just be aware that using these tools to edit your work comes with the risk that it may change your original writing so much that it no longer reflects your original thought, so make sure you are using it for simple grammar and spelling checks, not to substantially rewrite your work.\n\nThe unauthorized use of artificial intelligence (AI) can be a form of academic misconduct at UW. Tools that use AI and large language models to generate text or images, such as ChatGPT, GPT4, Bing Chat, and \"Write with AI\" in Google Docs (the \"help me write\" feature now in beta testing in Workspace Labs), are usually prohibited by instructors in Department of History courses. Unless your instructor has expressly permitted the use of such tools, check with your instructor beforeusing them. The unauthorized use of such tools may constitute academic misconduct and could result in serious disciplinary action.\n\nPENALTIES FOR SUSPECTED PLAGIARISM OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF AI\n\nI know that most of you are honest, hard-working, and would not dream of cheating. I see you and I appreciate you. You are the reason I love this job. However, there are always a couple of students who try to see what they can get away with. This policy is for them.\n\nAll assignments containing suspected plagiarism or AI use will receive a 0 and be sent to the Office of Community Standards and Student Conduct for investigation and the enforcement of appropriate sanctions.\n\nAny student reported to the Office of Community Standards and Student Conduct after a second instance of suspected plagiarism or AI use will fail the course.\n\nTECHNOLOGY SUPPORT\n\nIf you experience issues with Canvas, here is a basic troubleshooting guide.
