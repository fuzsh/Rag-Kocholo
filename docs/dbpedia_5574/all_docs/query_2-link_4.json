        "text": "1760-1820\n\nGeorge III\n\n59 years, 96 days\n\nHaving ascended to the throne at just 22, George III’s dramatic reign included the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and expansion of the British Empire. However, it is often most remembered for the illness that plagued his later life. He was declared unfit to rule in 1810, when his son George IV – one of 15 children – became Regent.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nGeorge III was the first king to study science as part of his education (he had his own astronomical observatory), and examples of his collection of scientific instruments can now be seen in London’s Science Museum.\n\nLearn more about George III in How Mad Was King George?\n\n1820-1830\n\nGeorge IV\n\n10 years, 148 days\n\nGeorge IV was known for his extravagant spending, gambling and womanizing. Once married in secret to a Roman Catholic, his only legitimate heir with his second wife Caroline, Princess Charlotte, died in 1817 while he was still on the throne.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nGeorge hired the artist responsible for the creation of Regent’s Park in London, as well as transforming the modest Buckingham House into the grand Buckingham Palace.\n\nLearn more about George IV in Young Victoria.\n\n1830-1837\n\nWilliam IV\n\n6 years, 359 days\n\nThe brother of George IV, William never expected to become king. As a young man he served in the Royal Navy during the American War of Independence, and as king he oversaw major parliamentary reform. He was determined to live long enough to see his niece, Victoria, reach her majority, ensuring she would accede the throne directly.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nWilliam was often seen as a rather silly man in his youth as he could be both erratic, over-excitable and tactless. Initially popular when he ascended the throne in 1830, William became embroiled in the Reform Crisis of the 1830s which turned many people against him, leading him to be described as out-of-touch, dithering and silly, earning the name Silly Willy.\n\nLearn more about William IV in Young Victoria.\n\n1837-1901\n\nVictoria\n\n63 years, 216 days\n\nInheriting the throne through her father Edward, the fourth son of George III, Victoria’s was the second longest reign in British history. Remembered for her strict moral values, she oversaw further expansion of the British Empire and the Industrial Revolution, and with her beloved Prince Albert, had nine children.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nVictoria proposed to Prince Albert on October 15, 1839 and they were married February 10, 1840, in the Chapel Royal of St. James’s Palace in London.\n\nLearn more about Victoria in Queen Victoria and Her Nine Children.\n\n1901-1910\n\nEdward VII\n\n9 years, 104 days\n\nThe first-born son of Queen Victoria, Edward was a popular king who helped modernize the monarchy. However, his love of fine dining, fashion, and socializing stood in stark contrast to the values of his parents. Known to his family and friends as Bertie, he married the Danish Princess Alexandra, with whom he had five children.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nEdward was born “Albert Edward” and often referred to himself as “Bertie,” a nickname he would share with his grandson, the future King George VI. However, he had another nickname that he didn’t share due to his debaucherously ways—“Dirty Bertie”.\n\nLearn more about Edward VII in Edward VII Prince of Pleasure.\n\n1910-1935\n\nGeorge V\n\n25 years, 259 days\n\nThe second son of Edward VII, George V re-invented the monarchy for the modern age alongside his beloved wife, Queen Mary. He oversaw the early transformation of the British Empire into the Commonwealth, and in 1917, with anti-German sentiment running high, he changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nIn July 1914, the First World War broke out and the king visited military hospitals and the front. He was seriously injured during a trip to France during the war when his horse fell on him and broke his pelvis.\n\nLearn more about George V in King George and Queen Mary: The Royals Who Rescued the Monarchy.\n\n1935-1936\n\nEdward VIII\n\n326 days\n\nWhen George V died, Edward flew to London from Sandringham, becoming the first monarch to take an aircraft in the history of monarchs. Edward V, Edward VIII and Lady Jane Grey are the only monarchs who were never crowned.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nHandsome and debonair, Edward VIII’s failure to settle down strained his relationship with his strict father, George V. He caused a constitutional crisis when he abdicated the throne to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallace Simpson, and further strained family ties by meeting with Adolf Hitler in 1937 and supporting appeasement.\n\nLearn more about Edward VIII in Edward VIII: Britain’s Traitor King.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nGeorge VI was the first member of the royal family to learn to fly and in 1939, became the first reigning British monarch to set foot on American soil.\n\nLearn more about George VI in King George VI: Brother, Husband, King.\n\n1953-2023\n\nElizabeth II\n\n70 years, 214 days\n\nBritain’s longest reigning monarch, Elizabeth inherited her father’s strong sense of faith, duty and family. She married Prince Philip in 1947, with whom she had four children. Her reign saw the end of the British Empire, the rise of multiculturalism and age of the internet, and she is remembered as one of Britain’s best-loved monarchs.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nQueen Elizabeth was the only person in the UK allowed to drive without a license and first sent an email back in 1976. Her first Instagram post came 43 years later in 2019.\n\nLearn more about Elizabeth II in Elizabeth: The Unseen Queen.\n\n2023\n\nCharles III\n\nOn the Throne\n\nBritain’s longest serving heir apparent, Charles became the oldest monarch to accede to the throne, at age 73. He has taken steps to make the monarchy more accessible to the public, and is known for his interest in environmentalism, climate change and organic farming. He married Camilla Parker Bowles, now the Queen Consort, in 2005.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nA former royal chef disclosed Charles’ typical breakfast includes plums from Charles’ own garden and granola. He also shared that one of Charles’ favorite meals is lamb with mushroom risotto.\n\nLearn more about Charles III in Born to Be The King.\n\nHeir Apparent\n\nPrince William\n\nHeir Apparent\n\nThe eldest son of King Charles III and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, William attended the University of St. Andrews, where he met his wife, Catherine Middleton. He served in the British Army, and is also known for his charitable work, particularly in the areas of mental health and wildlife conservation.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nPrince William loves to surf. This is one of the surprising hobbies the British royal family does in their spare time. You might not think of Britain as a great place to surf, but Prince William has been known to don a wet suit and hop in the chilly water on his board.\n\nLearn more about William in Born to Be King."
