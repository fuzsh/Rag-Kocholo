        "text": "Gifts to Queen Elizabeth II\n\nQueen Elizabeth II took a keen interest in horses and knew much about them. We presented her with 8 horses as gifts.\n\nBurmese (1969)\n\nIn the autumn of 1968,Staff Sergeant Ralph Cave, the RCMP's riding master in Ottawa, suggested we present 1 of our horses as a gift to Queen Elizabeth II. On April 28, 1969, we presented her with the gift of Burmese, a Musical Ride service horse.\n\nBurmese became one of her favourite horses. She rode Burmese at the annual Trooping of the Colour, an impressive display of military pageantry to mark her birthday, for 18 years. Burmese passed away in 1990. Queen Elizabeth II didn't ride a horse at that event since 1987.\n\nCentenial (1973)\n\nWe presented Queen Elizabeth II with another police service horse during our centennial celebrations in 1973. This time, she chose Jerry, a 3-year-old black gelding. She picked him from a group of 5 horses during her visit to the RCMP stables in Ottawa on August 2, 1973.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II wanted this horse to have the same training Burmese had received as a part of the Musical Ride. Jerry stayed in Canada until 1977 to complete his training as a saddle horse and for use in the RCMP Musical Ride.\n\nWhen we presented the horse to Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle on May 15, 1977, Jerry's name changed to Centenial (with 1 \"n\"). He then went to the Mounted Division of the London Metropolitan Police. There, he received crowd-orientation training.\n\nJames (1998)\n\nOn October 27, 1998 we presented Queen Elizabeth II with the gift of James. This was part of our 125th anniversary celebrations.\n\nHe was an RCMP service horse and a trained Musical Ride horse, named after St. James Palace in London. The Prince of Wales (now His Majesty King Charles III) used to ride him for the annual Trooping the Colour.\n\nHe was also the veteran champion at the Royal Mews Horse Show in 2012. He went on to be National Champion at the Christmas show at Olympia.\n\nGeorge (2009)\n\nWe presented Queen Elizabeth II with the gift of George, an RCMP service horse, during the Royal Windsor Horse Show at Windsor Castle on May 16, 2009. This was to mark the 40th anniversary of our presenting Burmese to her.\n\nDuring the presentation, Canadian actor Leslie Nielsen narrated a 2-minute video on the RCMP. Nielsen's father was a member of the RCMP.\n\nSince 2009, The King (in his prior role as The Prince of Wales) has ridden George for the annual Trooping the Colour.\n\nElizabeth (2012)\n\nWe presented a young mare, Elizabeth, to Queen Elizabeth II as a private gift. The gift was in commemoration of her Diamond Jubilee. It also coincided with her accepting the honorary title of Commissioner-in-Chief of the RCMP.\n\nBorn on April 24, 2007, Elizabeth was named in honour of the Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth. The RCMP riding master and Queen Elizabeth II's stud groom selected Elizabeth for her. The RCMP's riding master trained the mare before we sent her to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nUpon receiving Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth II said she wanted to breed her. She also promised she would gift us Elizabeth's first foal. In 2018, she fulfilled that promise with 2-year-old filly, Victoria.\n\nSir John (2016)\n\nCommissioner Bob Paulson presented Queen Elizabeth II with Sir John, an 8-year-old gelding, on May 12, 2016. This was in honour of her 90th birthday.\n\nWe presented the gift to her in front of Windsor Castle during the Royal Windsor Horse Show. As part of the festivities, the Musical Ride also performed nightly at Windsor Castle from May 12 to 16.\n\nThe Princess Royal rides Sir John for the Trooping the Colour.\n\nKluane and Darby (2019)\n\nOn April 3, 2019, we gifted 2 horses to Queen Elizabeth II. We selected these horses to join her stables based on their ideal:\n\nsize\n\ncolour\n\ntemperament\n\nKluane was a 5.5-year-old Hanoverian gelding that was in training for the Musical Ride. But as a young, untested horse, he needed more training and wasn't ready to be a charger for the Royal Family. For this reason, we took Kluane back in June 2022 to begin his Musical Ride training.\n\nDarby, a 13-year-old Hanoverian gelding, was an experienced horse. He had toured for many years with the Musical Ride.\n\nWe gifted the 2 horses to mark 2 milestones:\n\nThe 80th anniversary of our breeding program\n\nThe 50th anniversary of presenting Queen Elizabeth II with her first RCMP horse, Burmese.\n\nCommissioner Brenda Lucki and Minister of Public Safety Ralph Goodale attended a private ceremony at Windsor Castle to present Canada's gift."
