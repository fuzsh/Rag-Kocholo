        "text": "The George Cross (GC) is the highest civil decoration of the United Kingdom and other member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. It is second as a decoration only to the Victoria Cross. The George Cross is the highest gallantry award for civilians, as well as for military personnel in actions which are not in the face of the enemy, or for which purely military honours would not normally be granted.[1] The George Cross was officially constituted on 24 September 1940 by King George VI, during the height of the Blitz, as a way to award civilian courage. It is granted in recognition of \"acts of the greatest heroism or of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme danger\".[1]\n\nInitially, the Empire Gallantry Medal recognised acts of the highest bravery but was never considered equal to that of the Victoria Cross. The George Cross succeeded the Empire Gallantry Medal and all those living that had been awarded the medal, and all posthumous awards from the outbreak of World War II, were obliged to exchange their medal for the George Cross. In 1971, the living recipients of either the Albert Medal and Edward Medal, that recognised the saving of life and bravery of miners and quarrymen respectively, were invited to exchange their medals for the George Cross; 24 recipients elected not to exchange their medal.\n\nCertain Commonwealth Realms have instituted their own indigenous honours systems, replacing the GC and other Commonwealth awards. The Queen of Canada has awarded the Cross of Valour to Canadian citizens since its establishment in 1972.[2] The Queen of Australia has likewise awarded the Cross of Valour to Australian citizens since 1975.[3] Both allow the wearer to use the postnominal letters CV.[2][3] The Queen of New Zealand has awarded the New Zealand Cross to New Zealand citizens since its institution in 1999, which grants the wearer the postnominal letters NZC.[4] Those issued a George Cross have not been issued an indigenous order as substitution, but remain recipients of the George Cross.\n\nThere have been 406 George Cross awards including two collective awards but no honorary awards although some recipients serving in British forces were foreign born including Albert Guérisse (Belgium), Violette Szabo (France), and Noor Inayat Khan (Russia). All three served within the Special Operations Executive during World War II. There are currently 20 living recipients.[5]\n\nIndividual Awards[]\n\nThis list contains all George Cross recipients including former recipients of the Empire Gallantry Medal, the Albert Medal or the Edward Medal who exchanged their earlier award for the George Cross.\n\nThe table defaults to sorting alphabetically by name. When sorting by the heading \"Rank (or Role)\", military ranks take precedence, followed by police ranks and then all civilian roles. Military ranks are sorted by the comparative rank of the recipient within the British Armed Forces, where the Royal Navy takes precedence, followed by the British Army and then Royal Air Force.\n\nIt is customary for Indian and Nepalese names to be written with the family name first, which is followed below unless their citation dictates otherwise.[6]\n\nThis along with an * (asterisk) indicates that the gazetted award was posthumous.\n\nGeorge Cross recipients Name Rank (or Role) Organisation Award Date gazetted Image Alderson, Thomas Hopper ZZZDetachment Leader[7] Air Raid Precautions[7]

In a letter to Malta's Governor (Lieutenant-General Sir William Dobbie) dated 15 April 1942, King George VI awarded the George Cross \"to the Island Fortress of Malta to bear witness to a heroism and devotion that will long be famous in history\". Dobbie replied: \"By God's help Malta will not weaken but will endure until victory is won.\"\n\nIn a similar manner, Queen Elizabeth II awarded the Royal Ulster Constabulary the George Cross on 23 November 1999. Buckingham Palace announced that it was awarded \"to honour the courage and dedication of the officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and their families who have shared their hardship\". Queen Elizabeth II presented it in person at Hillsborough Castle, County Down. On 4 November 2001, the Royal Ulster Constabulary was renamed the Police Service of Northern Ireland.[79]\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of Australian George Cross recipients\n\nLists of Victoria Cross recipients\n\nBritish and Commonwealth orders and decorations\n\nReferences[]\n\nSpecific[]\n\nGeneral[]\n\nThe Register of the George Cross (2nd ed.).
