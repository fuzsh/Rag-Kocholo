        "text": "This article demonstrates that two films of the 1990s portraying historical figures central to the mythologies of their respective nations - Neil Jordan’s Michael Collins (1996) and Shekhar Kapur’s Elizabeth (1998) - present their contentious versions of history analogically, via the conventional modes of encoding and representing gender identified by Laura Mulvey and others. Michael Collins can make an argument about the fate of twentieth-century Ireland in terms enabled by contemporary discussions about gender and desire in homosocial configurations. The character Michael Collins is understood as the bearer of spectatorial gaze and will; murdered, he represents the extinguishing of the spectatorial identity and of a potential future for the new-born Irish state. The character of Elizabeth I likewise embodies the fate of England. Woman’s ‘natural’ filmic place is the frozen, two-dimensional realm of the fetish, and so the final image of Elizabeth represents a relief that is both narrative and symbolic: woman rightly placed - the Queen be-fetished - implies the success of the nation beyond the film. The historical argument made in Elizabeth is therefore made in quintessentially cinematic terms: the story of the young female ruler becomes an illustration of the fate of woman herself in narrative cinema.\n\nThe book investigates the representations of Canada circulating at the heart of the British Empire, in the \"metropolis\", during the three decades preceding Canadian Confederation. The author uses Canada as an epitome for the \"white\" Empire. Readers will be interested in discovering which representations the Victorian public read and conceived about Canada, at the beginning of the “second” British Empire, through popular women’s travelogs and emigration narratives. The book analyses the general debate on empire building circulating in the public sphere, by taking into account its Canadian margins and their representation, through books published by well-known London publishing houses whose involvement in such “colonial” works is also examined in the course of the book.\n\nElizabeth I of England has been portrayed many times in film history. She has been portrayed, in specific historical contexts, as an icon of democratic values and religious tolerance. The discourse used in the movies remits to that paradigm. The rhetorical devices used in the films, however, tend to contrast with the outcome of the stories, a characteristic also used by the historical queen to enhance her and her country's achievements. In both cases, in the movies or in the queen's speeches, undermining one's importance later confirms exceptionality. RESUMO Isabel I de Inglaterra tem sido retratada muitas vezes na história do cinema, em contextos históricos específicos, como ícone de valores democráticos e tolerância religiosa. O discurso usado nos filmes remete para esse paradigma. Os mecanismos retóricos usados nos filmes, no entanto, têm tendência para contrastar com desfecho das estórias, uma característica igualmente usada pela rainha histórica para realçar os seus feitos bem como os do seu país. Em ambos os casos, em filme ou nos discursos da rainha, enfraquecer a sua importância mais tarde confirma a sua excecionalidade.\n\nAt the height of the British Empire, England was in the midst of major social, economic and moral upheaval. Arising from this commotion was the figure of the late Victorian and Edwardian ‘New Woman.’ Her appearance on the domestic front provoked further confusion and ambiguity about gender that had repercussions for empire. Building on a previous article that explored how the many vitriolic attacks on the British New Woman in the popular press and in popular and bestselling fiction were linked to anxiety about the future of the Empire, this essay examines, not the threat to nation and empire represented by the British New Woman , but rather the New Woman in the colonial peripheries. It turns to two very different models of British colonialism – Ireland and Australia – and asks how differently the New Woman was presented to the general reading public at the end of the nineteenth- and beginning of the twentieth century. Was the colonial New Woman represented as less of a threat to the reading public than the British New Woman? Or vice versa? Was the presentation of an Irish and an Australian New Woman very different? Did they each signify an equally potent threat to the British Empire...or otherwise? This paper will argue that although there were important similarities in the fictional representations of each of these New Women, there were also significant differences and these differences were due, for the most part, to the respective positions of these countries on the imperial spectrum.\n\nMargaret Cavendish appropriated images of Elizabeth I in order to show her support for an imperialist England and to question the status Restoration society awarded to women. During the seventeenth century hagiographic representations of Elizabeth I were increasingly used to criticise the policies and personalities of the Stuart monarchs. William Cavendish, for example, harked back to England’s glorious past under Elizabeth in order to inculcate in Charles II’s government expansionist and imperialist policies. Margaret Cavendish in The Blazing World demonstrates similar concerns but Cavendish’s work is also interested in using representations of Elizabeth I as a way of exploring both the disenfranchisement of women and, I argue, the possibility of female empowerment."
