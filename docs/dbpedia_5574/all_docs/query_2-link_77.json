        "text": "QUEEN VICTORIA - The accession of our young queen is a circumstance full of hope and promise. Humanly speaking, it is perhaps desirable that the event should have been postponed a few years, that her character might have become more fixed, and her acquaintance with the world and with those branches of knowledge which are peculiarly appropriate to her situation and her duties, more enlarged. But it has been ordained otherwise, and, we have no doubt, ordained for the best.\n\nFrom all that we have read and heard, her majesty's conduct hitherto seems to have been marked by great propriety both of feeling and demeanour. Her address to the privy council, on the day of her accession, which will be found in a subsequent column, was every thing that could be wished; and there is not a true Englishman who will not warmly respond to her prayer, that \"Providence may give her strength for the performance of the work to which she has been thus early called.\" The declaration, beautiful in its composition, and constitutional in its spirit as it is, has been savagely criticised and misrepresented by the Times. We trust, however, and believe, that very many even of the tories recoil with unmingled disgust from the hateful spirit which that journal so perseveringly evinces.\n\nIt cannot excite surprise, that, though surrounded by her illustrious mother and other friends, her majesty, during the ceremony of her proclamation on Wednesday, at St. James's Palace, should have been affected, even to tears, by a sense of the novelty and responsibility of her situation. Those tears, however - to adopt with a little variation the language of a noble poet with respect to another young and accomplished princess, -\n\n- \"were virtue's tears\n\nauspicious to those much-loved isles.\"\n\nAnd we add the wish,\n\n\"Oh! be each drop in future years\n\nRepaid her by a nation's smiles!\"\n\nDISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT - The terms of her majesty's message, conveyed on Thursday to the two houses of parliament, by Lord MELBOURNE, and Lord JOHN RUSSELL respectively, render evident (what, indeed, was previously pretty well known from private correspondence), that the session will be curtailed as much as possible; and that, so soon as the money bills and the most pressing business before the house of commons have been disposed of, a dissolution will take place.\n\nWe shall at once state our opinion, that no appeal to the people, more pregnant with future good or evil consequences to the nation, has ever been made. The question which the electors of this kingdom have to decide is, whether we shall continue in that peaceful and well-considered course of progressive reform which it is the peculiar, and will be the lasting, glory of the late king to have sanctioned and encouraged; or whether, by a dogged resistance to further measures of improvement - by a standing and pertinacious effort to cheat the people out of the legitimate consequences of the reform act, the future tranquillity of the nation is to be placed in imminent hazard. That we shall have reforms; that the great principles of political and religious liberty will finally be established in this kingdom; that government will be compelled to be more economical; that a higher standard of civilization will ultimately be adopted amongst us; that legislation will be made more sound in its principles, and more comprehensively beneficient in its operation - these are all articles of faith which we hold with a firm and undoubting trust. But it depends much upon ourselves - it is now to be decided by the constituency of the kingdom - how soon or how easily these wished-for changes shall be effected. The sovereign and the parliament of Great Britain have a glorious course before them, if the electors do their duty. We are, it may be said, at the commencement of a new era. We gave a queen whose age and whose education alike secure her being unversed in the old maxims and the corrupt practices of courts and cabinets. As the first sovereign who has acceded to the throne since the time of our great political regeneration, her feelings, it seems to us, must be much identified with that important measure, and her principles inclined to the furtherance of those objects which were looked to as its natural results. It depends upon the people how far those feelings shall take root. Let us give the queen a reforming house of commons; and she will give us, and support for us, a reforming ministry.\n\nWe know it may be said, that this will not cure the hostility of the house of peers, and that good measures will be obstructed and strangled there again, as they have been heretofore. We are not, however, of this opinion. With a decidely liberal parliament, and a liberal ministry, \"the queen's name will be a tower of strength.\" And we do not believe that, under such circumstances, the majority of the house of peers will long venture to continue their resistance to measures known to be in accordance alike with the wishes of the people, and of the two other branches of the legislature. We believe that they must, and will, yield to the force of public opinion. If we should turn out to be mistaken - if their former resistance should still be maintained - the tories well know, that means perfectly in unison with the spirit of the constitution may be found to overcome it. Of their sensibility to this fact their journals have already given note.\n\nWe call, therfore, upon every friend to improvement in the institutions of his country, upon every true reformer, to be up and doing. There is no time for hestation and delay. Our opponents will be united, active, zealous, and many of them, unscrupulous. In union, zeal, and activity, let us be at least their equals; and, whilst we use no waepons but such as we can employ with a good conscience, let us wield these with a decision, vigour, and effort proportioned to the goodness of our cause, and the importance of the objects we have in view.\n\nWe repeat - there is no time to lose. In Manchester we hope to announce in our very next number, that the committees of Mr. THOMSON and Mr. PHILIPS are organized, and prepared for action. In Salford, we believe, the friends of Mr. BROTHERTON are already in motion, and an address from him to the electors appears in our first page. We trust that not a single week will elapse before we shall be enabled to state, that effectual steps are being taken in all the neighbouring boroughs to secure the return of sound liberal representatives, and to rescue South Lancashire from the reproach of being represented by two conspicuous anti-reformers.\n\nTHE LATE KING - In subsequent columns will be found a variety of details connected with the death of his late majesty, WILLIAM the FOURTH, and an abridgement of an impartial and well-written memoir of his life, which we have taken from the Morning Chronicle.\n\nThough not as we have always understood, a prince of brilliant and commanding talents, we have the authority of all of all the leading ministers who have enjoyed his confidence for saying, that WILLIAM the FOURTH was well acquainted with the duties of his high station; that he was methodical and industrious in the performance of his functions; that he entered with spirit, interest and intelligence, into the consideration of the business which came before him, freely expressing and defending his own opinions, but ultimately acquiescing on all occasions in the only proper and constitutional method of terminating such discussions, viz. the adoption of those views which his responsible advisers had recommended and enforced.\n\nThere are some circumstances which impart to the period of his government a peculiar interest. He is the only British monarch (for virutally the PRINCE REGENT was a monarch), during whose whole reign the nation has been preserved from suffering by the crimes and calamities of war. And this period of foreign and internal peace has been distinguished by domestic changes of so vast and fundamental a kind, that there is probably not another country in the world where they could have been carried into effect without exhibiting the characteristics of a revolution. There can be no occasion, and indeed our time and space forbid that we should at present enumerate these: they will be sufficiently in the recollection of those of our readers who feel a material interest in political affairs.\n\nWe have always deemed it a fortunate circumstance, that the sovereign under whose reign these mighty changes were introduced was one who had been educated and passed through a good portion of his life, without any near prospect of acceding to the throne. He had a knowledge of the world, formed not exclusively at home but also in various foreign countries, which no prince standing in the relation of an immediate heir to the throne could have had the means of obtaining; and being engaged in the (in many respects) equalizing service of the navy, and not standing so decisively above or apart from his associates as he might have done in the land service, he acquired a frankness and affability of demeanour which have accompanied him through life, and which, if they detracted something from the ordinary prestige of royalty, more than compensated for the want of it by the personal regard which they inspired. His habits, at any rate, for many years past, were (keeping in mind his exalted station) simple, regular, and domestic. And we believe there is abundant evidence of the reciprocal and affectionate regard which existed between himself and his queen, during the whole period of their union.\n\nIt is often said that the public has no concern with the private lives of princes. We are not of that opinion. For whilst we would neither seek to create nor to gratify a prurient appetite for scandal, in relation to a subject with respect to which that appetite is so easily excited as the vices or follies of the great, we do feel that it is a circumstance which strongly conduces to the welfare and interest of a nation, when the monarch, instead of being an insulated and selfish voluptuary, is known to be constant and unostentatious in the fulfilment of domestic duties, and the natural displayof tender and virtuous affections.\n\nIt is still, however, in his public relations, that the character of the late king deserves to be chiefly considered; and, viewed in reference to these, it is deserving of great applause. He has been mainly the friend of civil and religious liberty; and the memory of WILLIAM the Reformer will long be cherished by the British public with a feeling, of affectionate respect and veneration, which it has been the lot of very few, if any, of his royal predecessors to inspire in an equal degree."
