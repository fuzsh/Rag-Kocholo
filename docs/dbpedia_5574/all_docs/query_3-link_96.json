        "text": "The Boy They Thought Never Wanted To Work is an emotional account of how we see each other when we appear to be different. In many ways the life of Gus Namdoog is an uplifting guide to help understand the importance of respect whether it relates to parents, family members, friends, educators, clergy, or any organisms that's living, breathing, sick, or oppositely different.\n\nThe young man in this story shows an uninterrupted determination to make his own decisions without any likelihood of disrupting his beliefs. This book is easy to read, it's a wonderful mentoring tool, and it helps develop young and enthusiastic vocabularies. But most of all, this book opposes criticisms to destroy any notions of judging others before it's too late.\n\nSometimes when we are at the lowest point in our lives, we look for achievable choices that are, most of the times, found right in our mist if only we took time to look in the directions that we've never looked before. We don't have to customarily leave home to find happiness. There is an old saying that says, \"We do our best fighting in our own back yard.\" This means: There are people around us that care; it's wise to pay attention to their advice, heeds their warnings, and remember the positive upbringings that were passed on to us.\n\nDuring our lifetime, our positive teachings will stay with us and will also be used in our everyday life. This book is not an introductions to religion, ethnic traditions, genetic fault findings, nor does it criticize any walk of life. It test the power of determination in addition to providing a wholesome way of learning just by simply having a good book to read. It has a happy, mysterious ending that I know you'll love. So, while reading this book, Don't let the green grass fool you. But most of all, do what you want to do, but be what you are."
