Over time, various members of the family have been involved with Red Cross fundraising appeals and events, and raised awareness of our life-saving work.\n\nSupport from the Royal family remains strong today. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II championed our work for over 70 years, first as patron of the Junior Red Cross and later as patron of the British Red Cross when she ascended to the throne in 1952.\n\nThroughout her life, she showed her enduring support for the work of the Red Cross and gave recognition to the contributions of our inspirational volunteers."
