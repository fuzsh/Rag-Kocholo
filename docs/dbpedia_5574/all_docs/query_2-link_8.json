        "text": "Queen Victoria is associated with Britain's great age of industrial expansion, economic progress and, especially, empire. At her death, it was said, Britain had a worldwide empire on which the sun never set.\n\nVictoria was born at Kensington Palace, London, on 24 May 1819. She was the only daughter of Edward, Duke of Kent, the fourth son of George III. Victoria's father died shortly after her birth and she became heir to the throne because the three uncles who preceded her in the line of succession – George IV, Frederick, Duke of York, and William IV – had no surviving legitimate children.\n\nIt was during Victoria's reign that the modern idea of the constitutional monarch, whose role as Head of State remained separate to political parties, began to evolve.\n\nThis page highlights the varied opportunities to explore more about Queen Victoria and her life through the Royal Collection’s objects, paintings, drawings, photographs and works of art."
