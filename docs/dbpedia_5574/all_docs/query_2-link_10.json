        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: Buckingham Palace, London - with its 775 rooms, Buckingham Palace has been the main royal residence for British monarchs since Queen Victoria moved into it in the 19th century. The Queen reigned during a time of great economic prosperity, when the power of the British Empire was at its peak. Queen Victoria ruled for 63 years, from 1837 to 1901, enjoying a longer reign than any monarch before her. Her name is synonymous with an entire era, and she was one of the most powerful women in history. She was a good mother to her nine children. Queen Victoria had 40 grandchildren and 88 great-grandchildren - due to her numerous offspring she was affectionately called the Grandmother of Europe. Throughout her life Queen Victoria was always above criticism.\n\nGILES MILTON: \"Queen Victoria was a caring mother to her own children but also a difficult one, a slightly strange mother. But she viewed all the subjects of her empire somehow as her own children whatever their class, color, race, creed. She wanted to improve their lot. But, of course, it wasn't necessarily the way in which the people wanted it to be improved themselves.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Queen Victoria ruled a global empire. The British have huge colonial territories in Africa and India. A third of the world's population was under the rule of the British Empire during her reign. But, with the passing of time, opposition movements took root in her colonies. The calls for independence grew ever louder. Queen Victoria has become emblematic of an entire epoch. We call it the Victorian era. The Queen died in 1901 at the age of 81. In 1911 the Victoria Memorial was erected in her honor in front of Buckingham Palace."
