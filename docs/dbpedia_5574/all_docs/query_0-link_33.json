        "text": "I admit it, I am totally a (historical) royals geek. Of course, I understand that royalty are just people, some of whom aren’t very interesting or nice. But especially when I was younger, I read numerous “Queens of England” books and biographies of various queens. I always think about doing social media theme days with images of different queens, then get disappointed when I realize that there aren’t enough movies/TV series to make it worthwhile. So instead, I’m compiling a bunch of the lesser known/depicted queens into a series of three posts, focusing on the medieval era, then the Renaissance through the 19th century, and finally the 20th century.\n\nBEFORE YOU FREAK OUT, I am consciously skipping these people who are worthy of (or already have) their own posts:\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine\n\nElizabeth Woodville\n\nAnne Neville\n\nElizabeth of York\n\nCatherine of Aragon\n\nAnne Boleyn\n\nJane Seymour\n\nAnne of Cleves\n\nCatherine Howard\n\nCatherine Parr\n\nHenrietta Maria\n\nJane Grey\n\nMary I\n\nElizabeth I\n\nCatherine of Braganza\n\nMary of Modena\n\nVictoria\n\nElizabeth II\n\nI’m mostly working with Wikipedia data here, so if you know of a movie or TV series that has included any of English/British queens, please feel free to add it in the comments! If they’re not listed here, it’s because I can’t find any onscreen portrayals. Also, I don’t wanna hear any bitching about the term “lesser.” I mean “less frequently depicted.” Breathe.\n\nHere’s my post about medieval English queensÂ and about Renaissance through 19th century English/British queens. Onwards!\n\nAlexandra of Denmark (1901-10)\n\nDaughter ofÂ Christian IX of Denmark, she married the future Edward VII. She was incredibly fashionable and a real style setter. She wasn’t given any political powers, so was mostly focused on her children and charitable works.\n\nShe was played by Ann Firbank inÂ Lillie (1978), but I can’t find any pics.\n\nShe was played by Julia Blake in Passion (1999), but I can’t find any photos.\n\nMary of Teck (1910-36)\n\nBorn and raised in England, although her father was the Duke of Teck; her mother was Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, granddaughter of George III. She was married to the future George V, and was mostly notable for supporting her husband through World War I, ill health, and major political changes.\n\nShe was played byÂ Rebecca Slater inÂ Edward the Seventh (1975), but I can’t find any pics.\n\nPhyllis Calvert played her inÂ The Woman He Loved (1988), but I can’t find any pics.\n\nPlayed byÂ Margaret Tyzack in, but no photos, inÂ Wallis & Edward (2005).\n\nValerie Dane has an uncredited part as Mary inÂ Downton Abbey (2010-15) — maybe in the court presentation scene?\n\nQueen Elizabeth (1936-52)\n\nDaughter ofÂ Claude Bowes-Lyon,Â Lord GlamisÂ (later the 14thÂ Earl of Strathmore and KinghorneÂ in Scotland), she married the future George VI (who took over as king after his elder brother, Edward VIII, abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson). She was a major inspirational figure during World War II, and the matriarch of the British royal family until her death at age 101.\n\nMarion Bailey will play her in the next season ofÂ The Crown (2016- ).\n\nWhoâs your favorite on-screen 20th century British queen/empress?"
