        "text": "Kate Middleton’s genealogy is fascinating. I’m getting ready for the royal wedding by reading up on her family tree. My husband thinks I’m crazy, but I love a good royal wedding.\n\nYes, I watched Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling’s wedding on the Web last summer. He’s from the same province as my ancestors, so I was obligated, of course. And they were nice enough to put his family tree up at Svensk Arkivinformation (SVAR). (No, unfortunately we’re not related.)\n\nSo I was happy to hear about Prince William and Kate Middleton getting engaged. I know there was a little flap last summer when a biographer found a link to a black sheep member of the Middleton family tree.\n\nSince the engagement announcement, genealogists have been quick to establish that William and Kate are 12th cousins once removed through their common ancestor – the 16th century soldier Sir Thomas Leighton. (By contrast, William’s grandparents, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip are third cousins, descended through Queen Victoria.)\n\nSomeone left this Middleton lineage on the comments section of a wire story, so I cannot provide attribution, but it’s interesting indeed:\n\nEdward III, King of England (b. 1312 d. 1377) m. Philippa of Hainault (b. 1314 d. 1369)\n\nJohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster (b. 1340 d. 1399) m. Catherine Roet (b. 1350 d. 10 May 1403)\n\nRalph Nevill, Earl of Westmorland (b. Abt 1364 d. m. Joan Beaufort\n\nHenry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland (b. 3 Feb 1393 d. 23 May 1455) m. Eleanor Nevill (d. 1463)\n\nHenry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland (b. 25 Jul 1421 d. 29 Mar 1461) m. Eleanor Poynings (b. Abt 1422 d. Abt Feb 1483)\n\nSir William Gascoigne of Gawthorpe (d. 4 Mar 1487) m. Margaret Percy\n\nSir Thomas Fairfax (d. 1520) m. Anne Gascoigne\n\nWilliam Fairfax m. ?\n\nWilliam Fairfax m. Lucy Goodman\n\nJohn Fairfax m. Mary Birch\n\nBenjamin Fairfax (1592-1675) m. Sarah Galliard\n\nBenjamin Fairfax (d 1708) m. Bridget Stringer\n\nJohn Meadows (d 1697) m. Sarah Fairfax (1654-1688)\n\nPhilip Meadows (1679-1752) m. Margaret Hall (1691-1765)\n\nDavid Martineau (1726-1768) m. Sarah Meadows (1725-1800)\n\nThomas Martineau (1764-1826) m. Elizabeth Rankin (1771-1848)\n\nThomas Greenhow (1792-1881) m. Elizabeth Martineau (1794-1850)\n\nFrancis Lupton (1813-1884) m. Elizabeth Greenhow (1821-1892)\n\nFrancis Lupton (1848-1921) m. Harriet Davis (1850-1892)\n\nRichard Middleton (1878-1921) m. Olive Lupton (1881-1936)\n\nPeter Middleton (1920-) m. Valerie Glassborow (1924-2006)\n\nMichael Middleton (1949-) m. Carole Goldsmith (1955-)\n\nCatherine Middleton (1982-)\n\nUpdate: A probable direct line from Henry VIII to Catherine Middleton has been established."
