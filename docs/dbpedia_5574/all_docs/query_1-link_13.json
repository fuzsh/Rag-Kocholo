        "text": "William Blake All citations of Blake are from The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, ed. David V. Erdman, newly rev. ed. (New York: Anchor–Random House, 1988). References to the Bible are to the Authorized (King James) Version; those to Paradise Lost are to the edition by Merritt Y. Hughes (New York: Odyssey Press, 1935).resorted to the use of allusions with great frequency, for allusions as silent signifiers enabled him to say more than was overtly expressed. They provided the poet with an additional dimension of meaning (and counter-meaning), and my argument explores these protean factors as they relate to Blake’s condemnation of royalty.\n\nDuring the intensely repressive English political climate of 1792 (and thereafter), it became dangerous to criticize the government and King George III, a condition that culminated in Prime Minister William Pitt’s own “Reign of Terror” in response to the revolutionary tumult in France. Thus, in 1793 any person could be imprisoned without charge or trial, while in 1795 it became a crime to speak or write against government policy. Despite such severe restrictions, the libertarian Blake repeatedly attacked the king with clandestine subtlety. Such condemnations are primarily concealed within Miltonic and biblical allusions.\n\nThe Annual Register for 1793 (“Chronicle,” p. 4) reported a remarkable incident that occurred on 19 January, when the sun made an “extraordinary appearance”: about noon “a fog arose, by which the sun, as is usual, appeared like a red globe.” The sphere enveloped by mist was unusual in that it had a pronounced “oblong opake body nearly on its centre,” and “even when the fog dispersed, and the sun became very luminous, the spot was still visible, although the power of light was so great upon the eye as to dazzle and weaken the sight.” The Gentleman’s Magazine (January 1793, p. 8) further observed that “those whose minds are affected by superstition may be led to believe it a sign of some tremendous event.” Coincidentally, on 21 January Louis XVI was beheaded, and in February France declared war on Britain. Marie Antoinette, the queen of France, was guillotined on 16 October 1793.\n\nThe Times (12 January 1793) had contrasted England’s secure Queen Charlotte, “surrounded by a numerous progeny, the pledges of connubial love, and the offspring of matrimonial chastity [monogamy],” with the unfortunate Marie Antoinette, confined by revolutionaries and “treated like the veriest street-walker that ever inhabited the walls of a prison.” In a private Notebook poem (c. late 1792), Blake satirically questioned the virtue of “the beautiful Queen of France,” who demanded that “the Brothels of Paris be opened” (E 499-500), a disparagement not unusual for republicans. The author of The Greatest of All the Joys of the Père Duchesne, a scurrilous work that violently repudiated the French monarchy, recorded exhilaration as he witnessed the head of Marie Antoinette being separated from the “fucking tart’s neck.” This writer also denounced Louis XVI as a “sham father” and a “fat cuckold.”\n\nJerusalem copy E, pl. 63. Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection. B1992.8.1(63).\n\nBlake’s continued rejection of royalty may be catalogued in his enigmatic design for Jerusalem plate 63, which depicts a blasting crescent (presumably the beams of the morning star) above a polyp-enwrapped female with exposed breasts. This puzzling iconography finds its parallel, in part, in a caricature of 2 November 1790. Gleaming rays surround the head of Marie Antoinette, whom Edmund Burke idealized in Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) as the morning star or Venus, a planet that briefly presents its crescent near the earth at dawn. Burke embellished his memory of almost two decades before: “I saw the queen of France, then the dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move in—glittering like the morning star.”\n\nIn ironic derision of Burke’s text, Blake responded with the following quatrain (E 500): “The Queen of France [as Venus, the goddess of love] just touchd this Globe / And the [sexual] Pestilence darted from her robe / But our good Queen quite grows to the ground / And a great many suckers grow all around.” Blake’s crescent of Venus in Jerusalem 63, warping the details of Burke’s description, potentially signifies the genitals of the queen of France, Venus disrobed, while the “great many suckers [that] grow all around” Queen Charlotte on earth suggest her extensive offspring. Charlotte delivered fifteen infants in twenty-two years, and a contemporary witticism concluded that she appeared as if she were bearing all of her children at one pregnancy.\n\nBlake’s context is also addressed in A Vision of the Last Judgment (E 562), where the “good … Queens [of England],” adorned with “Crowns,” are “calld in the Bible … Nursing Mothers.” These “queens” are the “nursing mothers” in Isaiah 49.23, abject royalty who must “bow down … with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet.” Blake excoriated Queen Charlotte as a polyp-like tree of genealogy that “quite grows to the ground,” for “just such a tree [is] at Java found”—the deadly upas tree.\n\n“London” (E 26-27) in Songs of Experience (1794) circumspectly denounces the tyrannical attitude of George III. Though Blake investigates the trepidations of London’s earthly avenues, these thoroughfares also expand upon the heavens in what he later describes as “Londons opening streets” (Jerusalem 34[38].43, E 180). “London,” one of Blake’s most challenging compositions, clearly functions at one level as an astronomical poem.\n\nIn relating heaven to earth in the manuscript version (probably written in late 1792, as the Notebook placement tentatively indicates), Blake hears the “german [Hanoverian] forged links” (see E 796), because the laws initially were cried about the streets of the metropolis. He envisioned these proclamations as rotating laws of the universe, a starry chain of reasonings cast upon the Mundane Shell/brain. (Compare the “Prince of Light bound in chains [stars] of intellect” in The Four Zoas [57.16, E 339].) In Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes identified such mental chains as “Artificiall Chains, called Civill Lawes” (2.21). Possibly because of the oppressive political climate of the period, Blake amended “german forged links” to “mind-forg’d manacles.” The thought remained in his imagination, however, for in a poem of September 1800 he speaks of “Rending the manacles of Londons Dungeon dark”; London stands “Ghastly pale,” a “City in fear.”\n\n“London” finds additional relevance in Joel Barlow’s Advice to the Privileged Orders, an anti-monarchical work published by Joseph Johnson in early 1792. Barlow remonstrates that in England “the people at large” are “ignorant of the acts of parliament,” for “they are printed by one man only, who is called the king’s printer,—in the old German character, which few men can read.” He refers to the fact that English law was traditionally printed in Gothic typeface, known as German blackletter or Old English script. (Gothic typeface was used in Germany until the beginning of the twentieth century.) Barlow protests that if one wishes to have knowledge of English legalities one must “find out the king’s printer, pay a penny a page for the law, and learn the German alphabet.” He cynically concludes that the abstruse Gothic/German “laws of the land” represent a “fathomless abyss,” and thus Blake saw Barlow’s laws of the abyss as a starry chain of words forged in the heavenly dungeon of the mind. These words of law, printed in Gothic typeface, become in the allegory of Blake’s “London” the “german forged” manacles of the mind.\n\nThe monarch in “King Edward the Third” from Poetical Sketches (1783) observes that “the enemy fight in chains, invisible chains, but heavy,” for “their minds are fetter’d” (1.13-14, E 424), and Blake’s laws of Hanoverian oppression find their extension in America (1793), where “a heavy iron chain / Descends link by link from Albions cliffs” to bind the minds of the revolutionary “sons of America” (3.7-9, E 52). English “Governors,” threatening the American colonists, “Shak[e] their mental chains” (13.1-3, E 56), which relates to the stars as German-forged links encircling the heavens. (Compare the caricature of 1 March 1776, The State Blacksmiths Forging Fetters for the Americans.)\n\nIn Blakean allegory the divine right of kings is of satanic origin. Hence, the starry typography of God’s statutes, taken from the “brazen Book” of the fallen prince of light (Jehovah, who codified the Ten Commandments), is “copied on Earth” (in Gothic type) by Hanoverian “Kings & Priests” (Europe 11.3-5, E 64). This “Lawful” deceit “forges fetters for the mind” (E 472), which is applicable to the “mind-forg’d manacles” in “London.”\n\nBlake’s antinomian and heretical Orc in America will “stamp to dust” God’s (that is, the devil’s) “stony [starry] law” of morality (which the poet equates with the decrees issued under George III). In this passage (8.3-9, E 54), Blake envisions the Decalogue as starry words circulating upon the dark voids, the cyclical rote of God’s stony law, allegorically forming a repetitive mill of hell (see There is No Natural Religion, E 2). In The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790) a revolutionary “wonder” (later identified as Orc in America) rejects such restriction and “stamps the stony law to dust” (pls. 26-27, E 44-45). He eradicates the fallen heavens of morality by “loosing the eternal horses [of the sun] from the dens of night”; in this context, godly and kingly “Empire is no more! and now the lion [Leo] & wolf [Lupus] shall cease,” translating earth to the heavens.\n\nEarly on, Blake expressed anti-royal sympathies in Poetical Sketches: “O what have Kings to answer for, / Before that awful throne!” of God (“Gwin, King of Norway,” E 420). In his design “Our End is come,” issued a decade later, he portrayed a crowned king with two nefarious ministers (holding spear and sword respectively); they are subjected to sublime terror and fear, reminiscent of the pitiful state of Zion in Lamentations—“our end is come” (4.18). In “Our End is come” no one can avoid divine judgment: “For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?” (Revelation 6.17). The question “Who can stand?” appears four times in the prologue to “King Edward the Fourth” from Poetical Sketches (E 439), which speaks of God’s awful wrath to be visited on “The Kings and Nobles of the Land.” In America, Blake writes that “their [kings’ and nobles’] end should come, when France reciev’d the Demons light” (16.15, E 57)—that of fiery Orc, whose flames instigated the French Revolution (engendered by the revolution in America).\n\nThus, in Europe, “terrible Orc, when he beheld the morning in the east,” descended with “the light of his fury” “in the vineyards of red France” (14.37, 15.2, E 66). Appropriately, the new French calendar was initiated at the moment the sun entered the sign of Libra, and the first month was known as Vendemaire—the vintage month, a time of reaping the harvest (Annual Register for 1793, “Chronicle,” pp. 41-42). The balances or scales of justice weigh the equatorial heavens in plate 5 of America, an equinox where kings presumably will meet their judgment.\n\n“Albions Angel,” first introduced in that plate, may be presumed to be analogous to George III, cunningly converted by Blake into the devil, his satanic majesty. Star-soldiers “must’ring in the eastern sky” (America 13.13-16, 15.4-6, E 56-57) are envisioned as slaves of the king in vocabulary that emulates book 1 of Paradise Lost (657-66), where “Millions” of “Celestial Spirits in Bondage” (slaves to Milton’s vengeful God) draw their “flaming swords” to illuminate the darkness of hell (an ironic simulation of morning). The “num’rous hosts” of the king (see the “numerous Host” of devils that fled through the “deep” in Paradise Lost 2.993-94) number “forty millions”; as stars fading in the light of the rising sun, they throw off “their hammerd mail, / And cast their swords & spears to earth,” seeking liberation in the new dawn as a “naked multitude.” They are naked in part because those who “walk in the flesh … do not war after the flesh,” for the “weapons of our warfare are not carnal” but spiritual, and therefore result in “casting down imaginations [glossed as “reasonings”], and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God” (2 Corinthians 10.3-5). Blake’s imagery also reflects Romans 13.12-13: “The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting …, not in chambering and wantonness.” In consequence, Blake’s revolutionary edicts presume sexual satiety.\n\nBlake’s phrasing also mocks Burke’s political perspective. In his Discourse, which commemorated the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Price empathized with the “nations panting for liberty” and noted that he had “lived to see Thirty Millions of people … spurning at slavery,” a number derided by Burke in his Reflections. As noted, Blake deliberately increased the number in question to “forty millions” and converted these panting slaves into a “naked multitude.”\n\nIn America Orc is the devilish spirit of the revolution, opposing devilish George III: thus devil confronts devil. Aptly, Orc occupies a Miltonic hell where “heat but not light” pervades the “murky atmosphere” (4.11, E 53); this alludes to the furnace-like “Dungeon” in book 1 of Paradise Lost (61-63), in which “on all sides round / … flames / [emit] No light, but rather darkness visible.” (Recall that in Miltonic cosmology, hell is located in the southern hemisphere, abstractly represented on the title page of The Marriage.) As an awful “Wonder” of the revolution, Orc arises in “red clouds” “o’er the Atlantic sea,” and “The King of England looking westward trembles at the vision” (4.7-12, E 53). In the shifting layers of America, Orc is described as a “Devourer of thy parent” (the monarchy) (9.20, E 54), reflecting Milton’s specter-like Death, who “his Parent [Sin] would full soon devour” (Paradise Lost 2.804-05). (Note also Blake’s language in The Four Zoas, in which Orc “Concenterd into Love of Parent Storgous Appetite Craving” [61.10, E 341].) Blake’s genealogy additionally addresses the issue that royal tyranny gave birth to revolution; hence, George III is envisioned as the metaphorical satanic father of fiery Orc, who is associated with Death, a creature born from Milton’s Sin.\n\nBlake’s anti-government posture is further revealed in a cancelled plate for America (b, E 58), where “George the third holds council” with “his Lords”; in view of the relentless severities of the period, Blake possibly rejected this plate because of its implied derogation of the monarch. In the passage privileged lords sit on “Angelic seats” in a “hall of counsel” in which Albion’s angel comes “Shut out from mortal sight.” Unmistakably Blake once more transforms the king into Satan; in Paradise Lost Milton speaks of the “Council” of infernal “Peers” (to Blake the House of Lords) on “golden seats” in a “spacious Hall” of hell (1.755-62, 796), while Satan “exalted sat” on a “Throne of Royal State” (2.1-5). In a later sequence (10.444-46) Satan comes “invisible” to his “Plutonian Hall” and “Ascended his high Throne, which under state / [is] Of richest texture spread.”\n\nBlake was obsessed with the “terrors” that appeared in heaven and hell when the “American War began” (lines to John Flaxman, E 707-08), and (as the revolution was ending) he approached the subject in “King Edward the Third,” where “war [shall] stain the blue heavens with bloody banners” (5.63, E 437), allegorically reflecting comets and meteors as omens streaming across the darkness. He converts these astronomical events into a declaration against royalty, with George III in mind.\n\nIn another cancelled plate for America (pl. a) a large interlinear design depicts a nude (Miltonic?) warrior holding a spear-staff, from which flies a huge banner of war. As discussed above, these banners are, at one level of interpretation, comets or meteors, projectiles often portrayed as “flags” waving in the air. Warlike “terrors” are also seen “at the flapping of the folding banners” in plate b (19-20, E 58). Blake continues to explore the idea in The Four Zoas (91 [second portion].26, E 364), which mentions “the flappings of the folding banners” in the voids. Later, Tharmas speaks of hell’s belligerence, exclaiming, “Lo darkness covers the long pomp of banners on the wind” (134.14, E 402). The phrasing once again alludes to Paradise Lost (1.531-37): a “mighty Standard” from a “glittering Staff [is] unfurl’d,” displaying an “Imperial Ensign” that “Shone like a Meteor streaming to the Wind.”\n\nIn America Orc is described as a “terror like a comet, or more like the planet red [Mars] / That once inclos’d the terrible wandering comets in its sphere” (5.2-3, E 53). The allegorical plague-sigh (11.13, E 55) is a royal sigh of blood running down the palace walls of heaven in the form of a comet, a pestilential product of state religion. The “voice of Albions Angel” causes “plagues” to fall upon America as a “blight” (14.3-6, E 56); “then rolld they back with fury / On Albions Angels” (14.20-15.1, E 56), reflecting Milton’s Comus, where “evil on itself shall back recoil” (line 593; see also Paradise Lost 7.56-58 and 4.15-18). In plate 15 (E 56-57), “plagues creep on the burning winds driven by flames of Orc,” with “ensigns sick’ning in the sky” and “banners seard”—fiery comets/meteors as flags or ensigns are viewed as veins cauterized, to stanch the flow of blood. The flames, associated with comet-like plagues, are characterized by Blake as leprosy (“spotted … plagues”). Orcan fires of war inflict George III with “Pestilence,” “in [comet] streaks of red / Across the limbs of Albions Guardian.” Fires of passion break out in the form of pestilence when nature (macrocosmic Orc) is inhibited, so “Over the hills, the vales, the cities” of Albion “rage the red flames fierce” of the revolutionary fires of Orc (America 16.1, E 57).\n\nBlake continues the idiom near the end of Europe (14.37, 15.2-5, E 66), where Orc appears amid “furious terrors,” among “golden chariots raging,” their “red wheels [as comets] dropping with blood.” (Compare The Four Zoas [75.29-31, E 352], in which Urizen’s “Comets” “with wheel impetuous” are envisioned as orbs “gorgd with blood” surrounding “red Orc.”) In Europe “the voice of Albions Angel” is heard “howling in flames of Orc” (12.12, E 64). The king was renowned for his ruddy complexion; Peter Pindar admonished that one of Benjamin West’s portraits made the monarch “A very Saracen” (Pindar’s emphasis), so much so that he looked as if he had “a fire-ship in his belly.” Pindar concluded that the populace was “anxious for his [George III’s] life.”\n\nIn America (pl. 11, E 55) a colonial angel, aflame with the fires of Orc, threatens the destruction of George III (for militancy creates counter-militancy) and disingenuously inquires, “What pitying Angel lusts for tears, and fans himself with sighs[?]” Blake again covertly associates the king with Milton’s weeping and sighing Satan in Paradise Lost: “Thus wept the Angel voice & as he wept the terrible blasts [or sighs] / Of trumpets, blew a loud alarm” (10.1-2, E 55). In Paradise Lost, “Thrice [Satan] assay’d” to speak before his “Peers,” but in vain; “Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last / Words interwove with sighs found out their way” (1.612-21). In further acknowledgment, when Urizen, the degenerate prince of light, questions his beast-formed constellations, his words are “but an inarticulate thunder”; no “voice / Of sweet response could he obtain tho [he] oft assayd with tears” (The Four Zoas 70 [first portion].39, 43-44, E 347). “In vain the voice / Of Urizen in vain the Eloquent tongue” (71 [first portion].3-4, E 348), for he is afflicted like Satan in Paradise Lost. (Compare Blake’s Tiriel [c. 1789] [4.46, E 281], where “eloquent tongues were dumb.”)\n\nBlake uses related imagery in Europe—Albion’s “red limb’d Angel” attempts to blow “The Trump of the last doom; but he could not blow the iron tube!” though “Thrice he assay’d presumptuous to awake the dead to Judgment” (13.1-3, E 65; compare 12.12-13, E 64). The guardian “Angel” of England cannot awake those in their graves. Such phrasing ironically relates to 2 Peter 2.9-10: “The Lord knoweth how … to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government [state religion]. Presumptuous are they, … they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.” Similar irony is present in America plate 7 (E 53), where “Albions Angel wrathful burnt” in fires punctuating the heavens; he denounces Orc as a “Blasphemous Demon, Antichrist, hater of Dignities.” Blake’s imagery establishes that both Albion’s angel (George III) and Orc are warlike creatures, one as an angel-tyrant enforcing repression and the other as a revolutionary energy that rejects any curtailment of liberty. The matter is assessed in “A Song of Liberty” (The Marriage pl. 27, E 45), where no longer will the curse of morality rule mankind, nor the “brethren” whom, erroneously, the tyrant “calls free,” reflecting Galatians 4.31: “So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.”\n\nThe king’s sighs and tears of state religion allude, in further irony, to Milton’s “Upon the Circumcision,” where “flaming Powers, and winged Warriors bright” are dejected soldiers whose “fiery essence can distill no tear.” (Note also Blake’s peace-loving Grey Monk, whose “eye was dry no tear could flow / A hollow groan first spoke his woe” [E 489].) Milton’s angel kings (like his weeping Satan) breathe forth upon the wind as they expansively “Burn in [their] sighs, and borrow / Seas wept from … deep sorrow.” These angels are an order of ethereal spirits associated with the planets of heaven, a celestial hierarchy mentioned by Blake in his inscriptions to Dante (E 689). In a constructive sense, Blake deduced that “a Tear is an Intellectual thing” and “a Sigh is the Sword of an Angel King” (Jerusalem 52.25-28, E 202) —hence the ironic association with Albion’s angel, the devil as George III.\n\nSuch are Blake’s disparate allusions attacking royalty, the “bad” queen of France (as a beaming crescent of the heavens), the “good” queen of England (quite growing to the ground), and red-flushed George III, his satanic majesty."
