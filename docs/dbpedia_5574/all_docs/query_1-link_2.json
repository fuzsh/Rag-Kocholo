        "text": "It's a story of love, power and politics. George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, a favourite and reported lover of King James I, son of Mary Queen of Scots would end up becoming one of the most highly regarded, influential men in early 17th-century England.\n\nGeorge Villiers was born in Brooksby, Leicestershire, on 28 August 1592. The son of Sir George Villiers (played in the series by Simon Russell Beale) and Mary Villiers, his father died when he was 14 in 1606 and it was his mother, Mary, who saw potential in him and prepared him for a courtier’s life. Although she was penniless, Mary found the money to send George to French court, where he learnt to dance elegantly, fence well and speak a little French, all of which were essential for English high society in the early 1600s. Having found the funds to deck him in a suitable wardrobe, George was sent to English court by his mother. Godfrey Goodman, who became the bishop of Gloucester, described him at the time as ‘the handsomest bodied man in England; his limbs so well compacted, and his conversation so pleasing, and of so sweet a disposition’.\n\nIt was in 1614 that George caught the eye of King James I, at a hunt in Apethorpe, a village in Northamptonshire. Though James was married to Queen Anne (played by Trine Dyrholm), George soon became the King’s favourite at court, replacing the Earl of Somerset (Laurie Davidson). George was appointed as Royal Cup-bearer, a position that allowed him to make conversation and grow in friendship with the King. Until the King died in 1625, Buckingham was his constant companion and closest advisor. The King was completely enamoured with George, and nicknamed him ‘Steenie’, after St Stephen who was said to have had ‘the face of an angel’.\n\nRead More\n\nThe curse of ‘King Charles’? The tumultuous history of His Majesty’s predecessors\n\nKing Charles III is poised for a spectacular reign. But King Charles I and King Charles II were less fortunate\n\nUnder the King’s patronage, Villiers grew in power: in 1615, he was knighted as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. In 1616, he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Whaddon, Viscount Villiers, and made a Knight of the Garter. The following year he was made an Earl, and finally in 1623, he was named Duke of Buckingham. This appointment marked him out as the only duke who was not a member of the Royal Family, and it meant that he was allowed to dance with the royal heir, King Charles I.\n\nIn a letter to George in 1623, James wrote, ‘God bless you, my sweet child and wife, and grant that ye may ever be a comfort to your dear father and husband’. Buckingham reciprocated the King’s affections, writing back to James: ‘I naturally so love your person, and adore all your other parts, which are more than ever one man had’, ‘I desire only to live in the world for your sake’ and ‘I will live and die a lover of you’. Villiers commissioned portraits from the time to depict himself as clean-shaven, and with long, elegant legs prominently displayed in an attractive manner.\n\nRead More\n\n‘Real-life Bridgerton’ painting shines light on racial diversity in Georgian London\n\nThe painting, on display at a Buckingham Palace exhibition, has drawn comparisons to Bridgerton thanks to its representation of race\n\nAs George grew in power, so did his mother, who became Countess of Buckingham in 1618. She was often at court, riding with King James. In 1618, the King reportedly said that he lived to no other end than to advance the Villiers family. Mary was also said to have arranged the marriage of George to the richest woman in the land, Lady Katherine Manners, the great heiress and daughter of the 6th Earl of Rutland, in 1620. Those who hated Mary claimed that she had trapped Katherine into marriage by forcing her to spend the night under the same roof as George, therefore tarnishing her reputation and forcing her to marry.\n\nRead More\n\n‘Deluxe captivity’: newly-unearthed documents reveal Mary, Queen of Scots’ lavish lifestyle\n\nFrom feasting on geese, veal and marmalade to riding her own horses, the pretender to the English throne was kept under surprisingly lavish conditions\n\nWhen King James I was dying in 1625, Mary had an argument with a physician over the correct treatment for the dying monarch. Such was her influence that the physician was removed from court. Three years after the King’s death, Buckingham was stabbed to death by John Felton in 1628, who felt he had been overlooked for promotion by the duke. On hearing the news of his death, it was said that the Duke of Buckingham’s mother did not seem surprised, but instead it seemed as though she had long expected this news. Mary died four years after her son in 1632, they are both buried in Westminster Abbey."
