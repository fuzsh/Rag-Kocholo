        "text": "My strongest early memory is of my mother weeping in our garden. When I asked why, she replied: ‘Because the King is dead.’ I was five years old, but somehow I knew that this was an important moment. It was 6 February 1952, and the Queen’s father, George VI, had just died in his sleep.\n\nFor at least a month thereafter, my mother, like many millions of others, wore a black armband in mourning. This was my first glimpse of the bond between Crown and people, an enduring link that had been reforged in the furnace of the Second World War, and which was strengthened during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nSeven decades later, with a new reign upon us, the bond between monarch and nation remains steadfast. The joyful Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla should be a moment of gratitude: not just for our extraordinary system of constitutional monarchy that has symbolised and upheld national unity for centuries, but for our new monarch, the gifted – and undeniably well-tested – King Charles III.\n\nThis is a role for which the King has had a lifetime of training. Since the day of his birth, 14 November 1948, the King has been in the spotlight. The world watched as he evolved from shy young prince to husband, from father to grandfather, and finally from Prince of Wales to head of state, the position he was destined to inherit. We have watched as the then heir to the throne found himself embroiled in the complexities of life, love, marriage and grief, with his mistakes and personal tragedies broadcast to the nation.\n\nBut the King has been blessed with a strong spiritual core that has always grounded him. He has dedicated himself unceasingly to understanding, loving and serving this great country.\n\nHis spiritual heart and mind are broader than most. His love of the Christian gospel – God is Love – was taught to him above all by his grandmother, the Queen Mother, and, in different ways, by his parents. Their examples have encouraged him to treat other people’s religions with respect and infinite curiosity. In the 1990s, he suggested that rather than ‘Defender of the Faith’ – of the Church of England – he wanted to be ‘Defender of Faith’ upon his accession. This was controversial at the time, but in 2012 the Queen accepted the concept, saying that the role of the Church of England ‘is not to defend Anglicanism to the exclusion of other religions. Instead the Church has a duty to protect the free practice of all faiths in this country.’\n\nHis spirituality and religious faith pervade his attitude to everything. The King is the only monarch in recent times to have displayed passions for Shakespeare, fine arts, classical music and architecture.\n\nThe perception that the King has somehow been perpetually waiting in the wings for this moment, searching for purpose, is misguided. He has always known that his was likely to be a long apprenticeship, so as a young man he drew up a list of the areas and problems that particularly interested him, and on which he thought he could add value. He dreaded that he would not have enough time to realise all his hopes and plans before becoming King.\n\nThe Prince was, however, aware that his apprenticeship could be brought to a close at any time. The threat of accidents and terrorism were ever-present – so for decades he was included in the Queen’s red box duties, learning the format of these daily official documents so that, whatever happened, there could be a seamless transition of power (as, at the end, there was).\n\nIn more recent years, Charles held weekly meetings with then Prime Minister David Cameron. ‘I had audiences with Prince Charles when Queen Elizabeth II was on the throne because he wanted to start thinking about how to conduct those audiences… From what I saw he will be brilliant at that job. Brilliant at listening, brilliant at asking questions, giving wise advice and sage counsel,’ Cameron said in 2022.\n\nBut to ascertain what sort of King he will be – and whether he will reign in the same fashion as his mother – is not a straightforward exercise. In terms of what his version of the monarchy will look like, one only has to look at the present: the ‘slimming down’ seems already to have begun. He is anxious to reduce the cost of the monarchy to the taxpayer but there is a risk of it becoming too slight to carry out all its charitable duties.\n\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles tried, at times less successfully than others, to avoid straying into the forbidden fields of politics. He was straightforward when asked in a 70th birthday interview whether his public campaigning would continue after his accession, stating: ‘No, it won’t. I’m not that stupid.’\n\nThe King’s reign will no doubt be marked by the strong work ethic for which he has became known. As the Duke of Sussex said of him in one interview: ‘He does need to slow down, this is a man who has dinner ridiculously late at night. And then goes to his desk later that night and will fall asleep on his notes to the point of where he’ll wake up with a piece of paper stuck to his face.’\n\nOf all the qualities he has inherited, from his parents and previous generations of his family, that sense of duty is the most important. And like his mother, grandfather, great-grandfather and others, the King’s unwavering duty will guide how he seeks to preserve and enhance our constitutional monarchy, which some historians, rightly in my view, consider a system of genius.\n\nIn 2002, the King said he had come to realise that his entire life was ‘motivated by a desire to heal’.\n\n‘To heal the dismembered landscape and the poisoned soul; the cruelly shattered townscape, where harmony has been replaced by cacophony; to heal the divisions between intuitive and rational thought, between mind and body, and soul, so that the temple of our humanity can once again be lit by a sacred flame.’\n\nHe understood early on that for all such ambitions he should harness Britain’s powerful charitable traditions to deliver huge improvements to individuals’ lives. Perhaps one of his most significant charitable endeavours has been the creation of the Prince’s Trust, which he established in 1976, to support 11- 30-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds. His work encompassed more than 400 charities of which he was president or patron as Prince of Wales. Initiatives he established include The Prince’s Wool Project and The Prince’s Rainforests Project.\n\nThe King’s desire to heal came with a personal sense of anxiety, though. In a 2013 interview with Time magazine, he said: ‘I feel more than anything else it’s my duty to worry about everybody and their lives in this country, to try to find a way of improving things if I possibly can.’\n\nAmong his other abiding passions are protecting both the countryside and the urban environment. He grew up in Norfolk and Scotland and inherited his love of nature from his parents. He has painted and written stories about his favourite places – such as The Old Man of Lochnagar, a story for children about the mountain that rises out of the moor in sight of Balmoral.\n\nHe carries out much of his work discreetly. Thus, for example, in February 1983 he spent a week on a small Duchy-owned dairy farm run by the Hutchings family on Dartmoor. Only after the week was over did the Palace announce that he had been there. The visit moved him and he wrote to a friend that it had reinforced for him man’s ‘dependence on natural things’. Life, he said, ‘suddenly took on its true meaning’.\n\nA few years later, he went to stay – equally privately – with a crofting family on the Hebridean island of Berneray. In both places he lived and ate with the family, learning more of the relationship between man and nature that has always preoccupied him.\n\nHis passionate espousal of the countryside and the vital part nature plays in the health and wellbeing of mankind has sometimes been mocked, never more than when he admitted talking to plants and trees. Nowadays he has been vindicated by many environmentalists.\n\nIn Country Life, he has endorsed the words of Octavia Hill, the co-founder of the National Trust, that ‘the sight of sky and of things growing seem human needs, common to all’.\n\nOur countryside is ‘as precious as any ancient cathedral’, he said in 2013. He has continually championed the move to organic farming and landscape regeneration at his own home and on royal estates such as Sandringham. He applauds the sentiment of Wordsworth, in that ‘nature never did betray the heart that loved her’.\n\nThe King’s passion for nature is matched by his dismay with architects and planners who ignore the concept of harmony in building. In 1984 the then Prince Charles famously denounced a proposed extension to the National Gallery as ‘a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend’.\n\nHis fierce words meant it was swiftly replaced with a much more sympathetic addition. He has made numerous other such interventions, which have been welcomed by many – but at the same time drawn criticism from the modern architectural fraternity and their allies (with a number of leading architects writing to The Sunday Times in 2009 to criticise him for ‘using his privileged position’ to intervene in plans regarding the former Chelsea Barracks).\n\nAbout as far as possible from the ugly, depressing glass and steel monsters of modern London is the model traditional village of Poundbury, an extension of Dorchester in Dorset, whose planning the Prince oversaw in the 1990s.\n\nMany critics think it’s a chocolate-box pastiche, but Dominic Richards, former executive director at The Prince’s Foundation for Building Community, who has worked with him extensively, recalls that the Prince once said to him: ‘All I wanted was to give people a happy place to live with their neighbours.’\n\nIn that sense Poundbury has worked well; all the houses have their own gardens, none is identical and, perhaps because of such unusual features, all have sold. People want to live there, and a similar village is now being constructed, under Richards’ supervision, in West Sussex.\n\nThe artist Catherine Goodman, Charles’s friend and adviser for almost 30 years, says of all his work: ‘He is essentially a romantic. But he also has a huge creative spirit. He loves painting his watercolours. But he is even happier with big projects like rescuing and restoring the glories of Dumfries House and its unique collection of Chippendale furniture.’\n\nDistressed by the direction of many modern art schools, where even the ability to draw is no longer always considered essential, he and Goodman started The Prince’s Drawing School in 2000. Since then it has become the Royal Drawing School and has grown apace, offering courses to adults and children.\n\n‘He is a very good listener,’ says Goodman, ‘especially to women, whose company he loves. He is incredibly funny, charming and persuasive. But, most importantly, kind.’\n\nHe is also a good correspondent. As Prince of Wales, he was known for his handwritten ‘black spider’ letters, which set out his many concerns to ministers and others. However, many more of them are personal. He always writes thank you letters, even if some of them are slightly tardy. Far from perfunctory, they are thoughtful and filled with his news and views, frustrations, excitements – and quips.\n\nHe has always had a riotous sense of humour, growing up loving The Goon Show and Spike Milligan. He is still an ace mimic and is impressively able to keep a straight face when telling jokes!\n\nBishop James Jones is another who speaks of the King’s spirituality and kindness. He saw him distributing Maundy Money for the first time as King this Easter, to elderly members of the church, in York Minster. ‘He did it with such gentleness, engaging in brief but sincere conversations with the recipients.’\n\nLike his grandfather King George VI, his temper can rise quickly. He has had a lot of provocation in that regard, perhaps especially during the painful break-up of his marriage, the appalling death of his former wife, Diana, and the more recent fracture with his beloved son Harry and his daughter-in-law Meghan.\n\nGoodman says his sense of humour, his love for music and a walk in his garden with Queen Camilla all help to pull him out of the slough of despond. Their love for each other is absolutely crucial.\n\nOur late Queen came to the throne in 1952, a beautiful young woman whose exposure to the public had until then been limited. By contrast, when King Charles acceded to the throne in 2022, he was already public property. Over the decades, he has had to endure the most intimate details of his life being spread across the world’s media, often accompanied by cruel comments and lies.\n\nHe has tried to ignore the abuse over the years, but it is persistent. One of his loyal supporters, the Iranian poet Shusha Guppy, marvelled at how his detractors invariably ignore his many charitable commitments. ‘I wonder how he finds the sheer moral strength to carry on with it,’ she wrote, ‘through the perennial sneers and brickbats of the more ignoble elements of the press.’\n\nFor 70 years, Queen Elizabeth provided the nation with a calm and comforting presence. At her funeral procession the pain of the nation was clear on millions of faces. But suddenly the old adage: ‘The King [or Queen] is dead, Long live the King’ came into force. It was astonishing to experience the seamless transition from one monarch to the other.\n\nOn the death of a monarch, his or her successor is proclaimed throughout the land. The new sovereign must take the Oath of Accession, before the peers and elder statesmen and women on the Accession Council in St James’s Palace.\n\nIt was different in 1952, when the Queen had to rush back from Kenya after the death of her father. This time, the new King was on hand – indeed, he and his siblings were gathered around their mother’s bed as she lay dying in Balmoral. The accession was immediate.\n\nThe speed with which we accepted the new sovereign seemed almost callous, but the late Queen would have rejoiced that the ancient mechanism, stored in a constitutional cupboard for seven decades, worked perfectly for her son – and for the world’s cameras. We even saw the new King battling with his fountain pen.\n\nThe moment Charles III acceded to the throne, he seemed to become imbued with a new strength, and appeared instantly assured in his new role.\n\nOn 9 September 2022, only a few hours after her death, he gave a powerful speech to the nation – a moving tribute to his mother and her life of service to the British people and those of the Commonwealth.\n\nIn the 70 years of his mother’s reign, the King said, the country had been transformed. ‘We have seen our society become one of many cultures and many faiths… But through all changes and challenges… our values have remained, and must remain constant.’\n\nHe spoke of the Queen’s close relations with the Church of England ‘in which my own faith is so deeply rooted’. Those Christian values had taught him to cherish ‘a sense of duty to others, and to hold in the greatest respect the precious traditions, freedoms and responsibilities of our unique history…’\n\nHe ended by thanking the millions who had grieved so sincerely for his mother, and he saluted her with ‘as you begin your last great journey to join my dear late Papa… May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.’\n\nThe new King and Queen embarked on an exhausting series of visits to all quarters of the kingdom, quickly followed by a successful state visit to Germany.\n\nThe coronation ceremony is ancient and has always been considered holy. The oaths taken by the new monarch are in effect a statement of the principles by which the UK is governed. The coronation is thus the nearest thing we have to a written constitution.\n\nThe first two oaths embody a commitment to ensure that the laws of the land are upheld and the country is ruled according to mercy and justice.\n\nThe third is more controversial and has often changed because it deals with religion – which itself has often changed in Britain too. The Queen swore in 1952 to uphold Protestantism and to preserve the settlement of the Church of England ‘as by law established’.\n\nThere have since been calls to broaden this wording to make it more appropriate to our multi-faith and more secular society. But any such change would require an act of Parliament, which has not yet happened.\n\nSo the King will still take an oath that pertains to the Church of England. But it seems likely that the service will also include acknowledgement of the other major faiths – now such an intrinsic part of our national life – which he has said he also seeks to protect.\n\nThe music promises to be superb. The King has worked this out with the conductor John Eliot Gardiner, a friend. He has personally commissioned 12 new pieces of music, including a Coronation anthem by Lord Lloyd Webber. There will be performances from Sir Bryn Terfel and a special Coronation orchestra conducted by Sir Antonio Pappano.\n\nThe earliest version of the coronation service we have dates back to the 10th century. It already contained the elements that are still regarded as essential today – the anointing of the King (and the Queen), the delivery of the emblems of power, the enthronement and the oaths of service taken by the monarchs.\n\nDetails of the ceremony have often been adapted, but its essence has remained much the same for over a thousand years. The distinguished historian A L Rowse pointed out in 1953 that this continuity was ‘a thing to be proud of in a world without much sense of order or of the past’.\n\nInevitably, there have been many coronation mishaps over the centuries. In 1838, Queen Victoria was ill-served by many of her attendants who did not know the etiquette. The ruby ring was made too small for her finger and the archbishop had to force it on. Then Lord Rolle fell down the steps as he came up to pay homage – the Queen left her throne to help him. Her kindness made a very good impression.\n\nIt was an altogether happier occasion for King Charles’s beloved grandmother, Queen Elizabeth. She was crowned with George VI in May 1937 after the abdication of his brother Edward VIII, and when Europe was on the brink of war.\n\nA devout Christian all her life, she was deeply affected by the religious core of the service. She immediately thanked the archbishop ‘with a very full heart’, saying, ‘I was more moved and more helped than I could have believed possible.’\n\nShe hoped that ‘the feeling of service and goodness’ that came from the Abbey ‘will result in strength and good feeling in individuals all over the world, and be a calming and strengthening influence on affairs in general.’\n\nThe King will doubtless hope that his own Coronation today has a similar effect.\n\nMonarchy has proved crucial to the governance of this nation. To the inevitable critics, I would offer the wisdom of Simone Weil, a young French philosopher who fled the Nazi occupation of France in 1942. She lived in Ashford before she died of tuberculosis in 1943, aged only 34. In her book The Need for Roots, she wrote that she had finally understood how Britain had avoided revolution and dictatorship in recent centuries. It was because the most important person in Britain, the monarch, was the person with the least formal power.\n\nIt is a great advantage to have a head of state who transcends party politics, represents civil society, and reminds us that there is more to public life than elections and political struggles. As the historian Nigel Biggar has pointed out, a healthy political system cannot be entirely democratic. A hereditary monarch ‘symbolises the accountability of the whole nation, rulers and ruled, kings and people, to the given principles of justice’.\n\nA monarchy is not – as some on the Left often complain – reactionary. On the contrary, by embodying continuity and stability, monarchy makes it easier for a society to cope with change. That was certainly true of Elizabeth II’s smooth and lengthy reign during a time of great societal upheaval. And when hereditary monarchy works well, it helps to counter the forces of disunity.\n\nQueen Victoria came to the throne in 1837.
