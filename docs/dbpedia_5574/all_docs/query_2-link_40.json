        "text": "1. Why use this guide?\n\nThis guide will help you to find records of and relating to the Royal Household which are now held at The National Archives. These records are a window on the life of the British and (formerly) English monarchy, and are particularly illuminating for studies of the medieval and early modern periods. The records provide insights into the administration, lifestyle, tastes and inner-workings of the monarchy and the royal court surrounding it, and include details of:\n\nofficials and other personnel\n\nroyal expenditure and patronage\n\nroyal piety and religiosity\n\nroyal dress and diet\n\narmoury, weaponry and the conduct of war\n\narchitecture and the arts\n\nmaterial culture at court\n\ntransport\n\n2. What is the Royal Household?\n\nFrom the Anglo-Saxon period onwards, the monarch employed a variety of officials and other personnel to maintain the running of their household and tend to their person, possessions and affairs. Originally these would have been their kinsmen but gradually this collection of servants was divided into a more organised structure, consisting of a number of official departments which together made up the Royal Household.\n\nMany of these departments emerged during the medieval period, when offices within the Royal Household gained their own identity, among them the Royal Wardrobe, which became the main accounting office of the monarch’s household, and the departments of the Lord Chamberlain and Lord Steward.\n\nThe majority of the surviving records for the Royal Household are from these three departments.\n\n2.1 Royal Wardrobe\n\nThe Royal Wardrobe was a department within the Royal Household, responsible not just for the cloth, clothing and accoutrements worn by the monarchy in their official business and used to adorn royal buildings and furnishings but also for their expenditure and financial accounts.\n\n2.2 Lord Chamberlain’s department\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain’s department was in charge of the ceremonial (royal christenings, marriages, funerals and coronations, and supervision of regalia), social, and artistic life of the monarch and royal court.\n\n2.3 Lord Steward’s department\n\nThe Lord Steward’s department was responsible for the domestic side of the Royal Household, including the catering, the chapels royal, grounds and gardens of royal palaces.\n\n3. Online records\n\nSearch for a Royal Household employee from 1526–1924 using the Royal Household establishment lists and Royal Household index sheets (£) on findmypast.co.uk. Each record includes an image, or multiple images, of original documents held at the Royal Archives.\n\nThere are over 386,000 records covering staff employed at Royal residences across the UK. The date range includes the reigns of King Charles I, Queen Victoria and King George V.\n\n4. Royal Wardrobe records (c.1154-1830)\n\nThe surviving records of the Royal Wardrobe provide detailed material for studies of royal administration, expenditure, patronage and the life of the royal court in general.\n\nThe Royal Wardrobe often drew funds from the Exchequer (E), the main financial department of the medieval and early modern English state, and this is reflected in the records held by The National Archives.\n\n4.1 Exchequer accounts: records of expenditure and revenue\n\nOne of the primary sources for records of the Royal Household and Wardrobe is the series of Exchequer records in E 101. These records, often rich in detail, include:\n\nDocuments sent to the Exchequer, minutely detailing expenses\n\nDaily summaries of the expenses of individual household departments with totals for each day and each week\n\nForeign expense rolls recording the extraordinary expenditure of the Wardrobe, and usually divided into separate sections for alms, gifts, necessaries and messengers\n\nLists of household personnel under the details of summer and winter robes given as livery to royal servants\n\nWar wages, horses, munitions and garrisoning\n\nAccounts and indentures from individual household officers, such as tailors or armourers, giving very detailed descriptions of their expenses for particular occasions, such as tournaments or coronations, and descriptions of garments and decorations for the royal family\n\nInventories of the royal treasure, and great wardrobe accounts listing purchases of cloth, fur, precious metals and jewels, spices and other flavourings, wax, and exotic foods\n\nWine details found in the butlerage accounts\n\nTo find specific document references (for example, E 101/531/2) in series E 101, which you will need before you can see the documents themselves, consult the following published finding aids:\n\nLists of various accounts and documents in the Exchequer and now in the Public Record Office (Volume 35 of Lists and Indexes, 1912) – use the subject and name index to get an E 101 reference\n\nList of documents relating to the household and wardrobe, John-Edward I (Public Record Office Handbook, no.7, 1964).\n\nOther useful Exchequer records include:\n\nMiscellaneous Treasury of the Receipt records in series E 36\n\nTreasury books in series E 315\n\nMiscellaneous books in series E 407\n\nMiscellaneous accounts relating to significant events and substantial sources of revenue in series E 358\n\nNames of members of the royal household, separately listed for 1523–1696 in the taxation returns – search for these in the E 179 database\n\nSummary information of wardrobe and household expenditure, often supplying or supplementing information in the accounts of individual household and wardrobe officials from 1257–1548 in series E 361; before this date and during the reigns of Henry III (1216–1272) and Edward I (1272–1307), the information is usually found in the pipe rolls in series E 372\n\nDetails of royal expenditure in the warrants for issues and wardrobe debentures in series E 404 and the issue rolls, where payments were recorded in series E 403\n\nA number of stray household accounts in series E 364\n\nSeveral series of household accounts of royal children in series E 351\n\n4.2 Payments to staff\n\nConsult the following publications, all available at The National Archives, for names of many of the servants and officials who received payments:\n\nIssues of the Exchequer by Frederick Devon (three volumes, 1835–37)\n\nWarrants for issues 1399–1485 (List and Index Supplementary Volume 9, 1964)\n\nAppointments and offices in the Exchequer (two manuscript volumes compiled in 1827)\n\n5.

Royal warrants were issued to suppliers of goods for which the Lord Steward’s department was responsible.

Today the issue of royal warrants to tradesmen is carefully controlled by the Royal Household. The grant of such a warrant entitles the holder to use the phrase ‘by appointment’, and to display the royal coat of arms.\n\nThe records include:\n\nDates Description Series 1761–1782 Some original warrants to purveyors and other tradesmen e.g. cork cutter, wine chest maker, cake maker LS 13/246-250 1627–1820 Enrolled copies of warrants.
