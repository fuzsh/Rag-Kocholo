        "text": "King George VI and The Queen Mother witness Blitz aftermath\n\nWednesday marks 100 years since the Queen Mother wed the future King George VI, a marriage that unknowingly marked the beginning of the Royal Family we see today.\n\nPrince Albert, Duke of York, married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon at Westminster Abbey on April 26, 1923.\n\nThe wedding was not the lavish royal affair befitting a future King and his Queen Consort because, at the time, nobody knew that he was to ascend to the throne.\n\nWhile George and Elizabeth are now known for their stoicism, remembered fondly for leading the country through World War Two and forming a close-knit Royal Family, they once had a far less prominent role in the Firm and, as a royal author discovered, led lives much freer of royal constraint.\n\nGet the latest royal news straight to your phone by joining our Whatsapp community!\n\nSally Bedell Smith, author of the recent book George VI and Elizabeth: The Marriage That Shaped the Monarchy, was a guest on an episode of the To Di For Daily podcast earlier this month.\n\nShe recalled the early days of Bertie and Elizabeth’s marriage, noting their habits before becoming King and Queen.\n\n“It was astonishing to me to read in the diaries that they were party animals,” Ms Bedell Smith said. “They would go out dancing until three or four in the morning and she [Elizabeth] would say, ‘fell asleep at 5am and got up for brekkie late.’”\n\nKinsey Schofield, host of the podcast, added: “I just love to hear that, [about] that long, blissful love — the kind of love you only have in youth. It's so fun to imagine these two characters, that are so regal and sophisticated, actually getting to enjoy that.”\n\nREAD MORE: Queen Elizabeth II's last words as monarch was aware 96th birthday 'might be her last'\n\nThe eight biggest bombshells in new royal TV series as Harry deemed dispensable by Queen\n\nA new ITVX documentary is jam-packed with new hair-raising claims and insights into how the Royal Family has operated for the past few decades.\n\nIt includes how Prince Harry’s life was seen as dispensable, whereas his older brother Prince William was to be more heavily protected.\n\nHere Express.co.uk takes a look at the eight biggest bombshells revealed in the documentary.\n\nAt the time, Ms Bedell Smith notes, both Bertie and Elizabeth shared close relationships with Prince Edward, then the heir to the throne and later King Edward VIII.\n\n“When Elizabeth and Bertie married, they had a good relationship with the then Prince of Wales, whom they called David,” Ms Bedell Smith said, before revealing the three young royals would go out partying together.\n\nBertie, who was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary, was the ‘spare’ to heir Prince Edward and was never supposed to be crowned King.\n\nBoth he and Elizabeth were perfectly happy with their lives in the shadow of Edward, who was first in line to the throne.\n\nAs historian Andrew Lownie, who authored Traitor King, told Express.co.uk: “Bertie was happy to stay under the radar and the men remained close throughout the Twenties. The Duke and Duchess of York, after their marriage in 1923, regularly visited David at his home Fort Belvedere in Windsor Great Park.”\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But she loved social drinking and, of course, her life was very social…Of course, the social wheels were also lubricated by large amounts of alcohol.”\n\nHe recalled the Queen Mother’s story about “dancing with Fred Astaire and, with a glint in her eye,” she’d say: “‘He was quite a good dancer, you know.’”\n\nThe Queen Mother died on March 30, 2002, at the Royal Lodge on the Windsor Great Park estate, with her eldest daughter at her side.\n\nAt the time of her death at the grand age of 101 years and 238 days, she was the longest-living member of the British Royal Family in history.\n\nIn her obituary, in the Sydney Morning Herald, writer and commentator Graham Turner described the Queen Mother as “the party girl to end all party girls”."
