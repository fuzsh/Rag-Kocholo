This is a list of people who held general officer rank or the rank of brigadier (together now recognized as starred officers) in the British Army, Royal Marines, British Indian Army or other military force.

It does not include English Army generals or Scottish Army generals. Neither England nor Scotland has had its own army since the Acts of Union in 1707. Generals promoted by the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707–1800), United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801–1922) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1922-present) are included.

See also Category:British generals - note that a "Brigadier" is not classed as a "general" in the British Army, despite being a NATO 1-star equivalent rank.[1]

Hence, in the lists below:

1* = Brigadier General/Brigadier

2* = Major General

3* = Lieutenant General

4* = General

(dates after the name are birth and death)
