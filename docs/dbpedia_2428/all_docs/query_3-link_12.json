        "text": "Quotes\n\nA collection of quotes, excerpts, and memorable credos from film, television, books, and miscellaneous sources. Some are well-known, others less so, a few quite original.\n\nI’ve done the best I could to fully and accurately cite each source; when I cannot do so, I have tried to make that clear as well.\n\nDanielle Sucher\n\nI don’t like hurting people. Is that so hard to understand? When I go to bed at night, I can sleep easily, knowing that I fought for freedom, and for less suffering rather than more. That I stood by someone accused so that he would not have to stand alone.\n\nI can’t know whether anyone is truly guilty or innocent, or what they deserve, and frankly, I don’t care. We all deserve at least one person on the damn planet willing to stand there next to us and fight on our behalf.\n\n[Legal Agility blog (now unavailable), on why she chose criminal defense law]\n\nMary Shelley\n\nAre you, then, so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honorable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honor and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.\n\n[Frankenstein]\n\nRafael Sabatini\n\nHe was born with the gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad.\n\n[First line of Scaramouche, and the author’s epitaph]\n\nIain M. Banks\n\n(Once, in a market in Robunde, he had brought her a caged bird because it sang so beautifully. He took it to the room they were hiring while she completed her thesis paper on temple acoustics.\n\nShe thanked him graciously, walked to the window, opened the cage’s door and shooed the little bird out; it flew away over the square, singing. She watched the bird for a moment until it disappeared, then looked around to him with an expression that was at once apologetic, defiant and concerned. He was leaning against the door frame, smiling at her.)\n\n[Look to Windward]\n\nAbraham Verghese\n\nShe felt the familiar calmness of an emergency, but she understood the falseness of that feeling, now that it was her life at stake.\n\n[Cutting for Stone]\n\nRoyal Humane Society\n\nSuppose but one in ten restored, what man would think the designs of the society unimportant, were himself, his relation, or his friend—that one?\n\n[Early days of the Royal Humane Society, dedicated to rescuing drowning victims in Britain]\n\nRoyal Humane Society\n\nlateat scintillula forsans\n\n[“a small spark may, perhaps, lie hidden.” Motto of the Royal Humane Society.]\n\nBertrand Russell\n\nThree passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.\n\nI have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy—ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness—that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what—at last—I have found.\n\nWith equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.\n\nLove and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.\n\nThis has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.\n\n[Autobiography]\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson\n\nThe problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation.\n\nFor me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You’d be surprised how far that gets you.\n\n[From a Reddit AMA]\n\nTecumseh\n\nAlways give a word or sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, or even a stranger, if in a lonely place.\n\n[Unknown]\n\nKelly Grayson\n\nYou should bother, because EMTs are privileged to play in life’s great game. Too many unlucky people watch the action thunder by, stuck at a desk, or watching it on television at home.\n\n[“A Pep Talk...”]\n\nRichard Bausch\n\nYou touch one part of it, and the whole thing shivers, from one end to the other. It’s such a delicate thing, revision, and revision is where the artistry is; and so you have to be ruthless, and put away anything—even parts you like the sound of, even the matters that speak from your secret self to who you hope you are—put away anything that does not contribute to the whole thing. And God damn it is hard.\n\n[Unknown]\n\nThom Dick\n\nAn EMT’s most basic job is to notice stuff and then wonder about it.\n\n[“Small Talk”]\n\nGeorge Santayana\n\n. . . until the curtain was rung down on the last act of the drama (and it might have no last act!) he wished the intellectual cripples and the moral hunchbacks not to be jeered at; perhaps they might turn out to be the heroes of the play.\n\n[On William James, quoted in Linda Simon’s William James Remembered]\n\nRobert M. Sapolsky\n\n[1] Soon we’re forgoing immediate pleasure in order to get good grades in order to get into a good college in order to get a good job in order to get into the nursing home of our choice.\n\n[2] A relationship is the price you pay for the anticipation of it.\n\n[Assorted, from Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers]\n\nJames Boswell\n\nDEMPSTER: We have hardly a right to abuse this tragedy; for bad as it is, how vain should either of us be to write one not near so good.\n\nJOHNSON: Why no, Sir; this is not just reasoning. You may abuse a tragedy, though you cannot write one. You may scold a carpenter who has made you a bad table, though you cannot make a table. It is not your trade to make tables.\n\n[Life of Johnson]\n\nDrew Anderson\n\nDepression is an indicator that your life sucks.\n\n[Word of mouth, reportedly paraphrasing Neil Jacobson]\n\nBarry Eisler\n\n“The City. Can’t you hear it? People. Machines. Even thoughts so thick your bones feel it and your ear almost catches it.”\n\n[Rain Fall]\n\nGregory David Roberts\n\nIt took me a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant, while I was chained to a wall and being tortured. I realized, somehow, through the screaming in my mind, that even in that shackled, bloody helplessness, I was still free: free to hate the men who were torturing me, or to forgive them. It doesn’t sound like much, I know. But in the flinch and bite of the chain, when it’s all you’ve got, that freedom is a universe of possibility. And the choice you make, between hating and forgiving, can become the story of your life.\n\n[Shantaram]\n\nChristopher Logue\n\nCome to the edge.\n\nWe might fall.\n\nCome to the edge.\n\nIt’s too high!\n\nCOME TO THE EDGE!\n\nAnd they came,\n\nand he pushed,\n\nand they flew.\n\n[“Come to the Edge.” Usually misattributed to Guillaume Apollinaire.]\n\nGilmore\n\nHe surprises me with beauty.\n\n[By the electronic composer Gilmore, in reference to the work of Aphex Twin. Quoted in an academic paper.]\n\nKarel and Josef Capek\n\nAnd to flash from the forge for a moment, and perish, is all our desire.\n\n[The Insect Play]\n\nRay Bradbury\n\nThe good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.\n\n[Fahrenheit 451]\n\nUnknown\n\nThere’s a parable about a woman who goes to a psychiatrist. The shrink says, “What’s the problem?” The woman says, “I’m dead.” The shrink tries to explain to her: no, you can’t be dead, you’re walking around, talking, you’re obviously alive. But he can’t convince her. Finally, he gets her to agree that dead people don’t bleed. He whips out a pin and jabs her in the hand. She looks at the blood welling up from the wound and says, “Son of a bitch! Dead people do bleed!”\n\n[Unknown]\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\n\nThrough our great good fortune, in our youth our hearts were touched with fire.\n\n[Speech to a veteran’s group on Memorial Day, post Civil War]\n\nNorman Maclean\n\n“All there is to thinking,” he said, “is seeing something noticeable which makes you see something you weren’t noticing which makes you see something that isn’t even visible.”\n\n[A River Runs Through It (novel)]\n\nUnknown\n\nNo sé. No hice el mundo.\n\n[Spoken by a lizard, as I recall, in a Spanish-language children’s story]\n\nEdward Albee\n\nThere is chaos behind the civility, of course.\n\n[The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?]\n\nUnknown\n\nFiat justitia ruat caelum\n\n[“Let Justice be done though the Heavens fall.” Unclear original source. Alternately Fiat iustitia, et pereat mundus (Let Justice be done, though the world perish), purportedly the motto of Ferdinand I.]\n\nC.S. Lewis\n\nIn a sense a child does not long for fairy land as a boy longs to be the hero of the first eleven. Does anyone suppose that he really and prosaically longs for all the dangers and discomforts of a fairy tale?—really wants dragons in contemporary England? It is not so. It would be much truer to say that fairy land arouses a longing for he knows not what. It stirs and troubles him (to his life-long enrichment) with the dim sense of something beyond his reach and, far from dulling or emptying the actual world, gives it a new dimension of depth. He does not despise real woods because he has read of enchanted woods: the reading makes all real woods a little enchanted. This is a special kind of longing.\n\n[The Chronicles of Narnia, afterword]\n\nJohn Steakley\n\n“He’s the best of us. The best of our best, the best that each of us will ever build or ever love. So pray for this Guardian of our growth and choose him well, for if he be not truly blessed, then our designs are surely frivolous and our future but a tragic waste of hope. Bless our best and adore for he doth bear our measure to the Cosmos.”\n\n[Armor]\n\nHerman Melville\n\n[1] It is not down in any map; true places never are.\n\n[2] God keep me from ever completing anything.\n\n[3] Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!\n\n[4] A laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer\n\n[5] Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves!\n\n[Assorted, from Moby Dick]\n\nWilliam Shakespeare\n\nFOOL: If thou wert my Fool, nuncle, I’d have thee beaten for being old before thy time.\n\nLEAR: How’s that?\n\nFOOL: Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.\n\n[King Lear]\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin\n\n“ . . . she obeys me, but only because she wants to.”\n\n“It’s the only justification for obedience,” Ged observed.\n\n[Tehanu]\n\nEric Shaver\n\nI haven’t gotten to the point of wanting to jump off a building, but there have been a few days where it sounded pretty interesting. At least then I’d know if I could fly.\n\n[Personal correspondence]\n\nGregory Benford\n\nIf you are losing at a game, change the game.\n\n[“A Hunger for the Infinite”]\n\n“Mister Skin”\n\nDyson spheres need great big walls\n\nTo keep the world from spilling out\n\nThey make them out of buckyballs\n\nAnd use gravitons for grout\n\n[Unknown; quoted here]\n\nRevelation\n\nand his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.\n\n[Revelation 1:15, from the New International Version of the Bible]\n\nSimon and Garfunkel\n\n“Kathy, I’m lost,” I said, though I knew she was sleeping.\n\n[“America”, written by Paul Simon, from Bookends]\n\nOscar Wilde\n\nAfter the first glass, you see things as you wish they were. After the second, you see things as they are not. Finally you see things as they really are, which is the most horrible thing in the world.\n\n[Purportedly in reference to absinthe. Possibly apocryphal.]\n\nBlaise Pascal\n\nWhen we wish to correct with advantage and to show another that he errs, we must notice from what side he views the matter, for on that side it is usually true, and admit that truth to him, but reveal to him the side on which it is false. He is satisfied with that, for he sees that he was not mistaken and that he only failed to see all sides. Now, no one is offended at not seeing everything; but one does not like to be mistaken, and that perhaps arises from the fact that man naturally cannot see everything, and that naturally he cannot err in the side he looks at, since the perceptions of our senses are always true.\n\n[Pensées, section 9]\n\nMaurice Baring\n\nBright gifts and festal crowns to him they bore.\n\nThe brave, the wise, the mighty and the fair\n\nAcclaimed him lord of the unconquered air.\n\nBut he who, thanks to more than mortal lore,\n\nThe albatross, the eagle could outsoar\n\nNow stripped of his large wings, and unaware\n\nOf the loud jubilee, in mute despair,\n\nWithdrew to weep alone on Cumae’s shore.\n\nTo one who asked he spoke: “My son to-day\n\nWas drowned; he flew too near the burning ray,\n\nThat struck his wings, and from the empty sky\n\nHe was hurled headlong to the envying sea:\n\nHe nevermore shall climb the skies with me,\n\nAnd I no more shall have the heart to fly.”\n\n[“Daedalus,” anthologized in Icarus: An Anthology of the Poetry of Flight (1938, by “R de la Bere”—perhaps Rupert De la Bère?—and cadets of the Royal Air Force academy, World War I era).]\n\nCuthbert Hicks\n\nI am blind: I have never seen\n\nSun gold nor silver moon,\n\nNor the fairy faces of flowers,\n\nNor the radiant noon.\n\nThey speak of the dawn and the dusk,\n\nAnd the smile of a child,\n\nOf the deep red heart of a rose,\n\nAs of God, undefiled.\n\nBut I learnt from the air to-day\n\n(On a bird’s wings I flew)\n\nThat the earth could never contain\n\nAll of the God I knew.\n\nI felt the blue mantle of space,\n\nAnd kissed the cloud’s white hem,\n\nI heard the stars’ majestic choir,\n\nAnd sang my praise with them.\n\nNow joy is mine through my long night,\n\nI do not feel the rod,\n\nFor I have danced the streets of heaven,\n\nAnd touched the face of God.\n\n[“The Blind Man Flies” anthologized in Icarus: An Anthology of the Poetry of Flight (1938, by “R de la Bere”—perhaps Rupert De la Bère?—and cadets of the Royal Air Force academy, World War I era).]\n\nChristian Hamilton\n\nGods: I have flown!\n\nAll my young body is broken on the rocks\n\nAnd all the red cliffs swim before my eyes—\n\nThe summer haze, perhaps—or my sight fails—\n\nDim world, these eyes of mine shall open soon\n\nOn great Olympus.

One of two things must happen: either the greater will give way and fly at the approach of its opposite, the less, or it will perish. It will not stand its ground, and receive smallness, and be other than it was, just as I stand my ground, and receive smallness, and remain the very same small man that I was. But greatness cannot endure to be small, being great. Just in the same way again smallness in us will never become nor be great; nor will any opposite, while it remains what it was, become or be at the same time the opposite of what it was. Either it goes away or it perishes in the change.\n\n[“Phaedo,” 102e–103a (Ancient Philosophy, Bard and Kaufmann 5th edition, Cornford translation)]\n\nSocrates\n\nWe are just in that state; we dwell in a hollow of the earth, and think that we are dwelling on its surface; and we call the air heaven, and think it to be the heaven wherein the stars run their courses. But the truth is that we are too weak and slow to pass through to the surface of the air. For if any man could reach the surface, or take wings and fly upward, he would look up and see a world beyond, just as the fishes look forth from the sea, and behold our world. And he would know that that was the real heaven, and the real light, and the real earth, if his nature were able to endure the sight.\n\n[“Phaedo,” 109d–110a (Ancient Philosophy, Bard and Kaufmann 5th edition, Cornford translation)]\n\nParmenides\n\n[13] First of all the gods she devised Love.\n\n[14] Shining by night with a light not her own, wandering round the earth.\n\n[Fragments.

From too much love of living,\n\nFrom hope and fear set free,\n\nWe thank with brief thanksgiving\n\nWhatever gods may be\n\nThat no life lives for ever;\n\nThat dead men rise up never;\n\nThat even the weariest river\n\nWinds somewhere safe to sea.\n\n[“The Garden of Proserpine”]\n\nBruce Cockburn\n\nGot to kick at the darkness ’til it bleeds daylight\n\n[“Lovers in a Dangerous Time”]\n\nNiccolò Machiavelli\n\n[1] There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things.\n\n[2] Hence it comes that all armed prophets have been victorious, and all unarmed prophets have been destroyed.\n\n[Assorted, from The Prince]\n\nCraig Douglas\n\nSeek safety at the heart of danger.\n\n[SDF forums (no longer available)]\n\nRobert Nozick\n\nOne way to determine if a view is inadequate is to check its consequences in particular cases, sometimes extreme ones, but if someone always decided what the result should be in any case by applying the given view itself, this would preclude discovering it did not correctly fit the case. Readers who hold they would plug in to the machine should notice whether their first impulse was not to do so, followed later by the thought that since only experiences could matter, the machine would be all right after all.\n\n[“Happiness”]\n\nMatthew Woodring Stover\n\nEach of us is the sum of our scars.\n\n[Blade of Tyshalle]\n\nTex\n\nIf my memory ever gets wiped I hope the recollection of my former self doesn’t depend on you people.\n\n[Old IBO IRC]\n\nPierre Bosquet\n\nC’est magnifique, mais ce n’est pas la guerre\n\n[“It is magnificent, but it is not war.” Reportedly spoken during the Crimean War by the French Marshal Bosquet, upon hearing of the events of the infamous “Charge of the light brigade.”]\n\nLouis XIV\n\nUltima ratio regum\n\n[“Last argument of kings.” Stamped on French cannons during the reign of King Louis XIV.]\n\n“MBCook”\n\nNT is a weak form of unix like a doughnut is a weak form of a particle accelerator.\n\n[Slashdot]\n\nSamuel Shem\n\nOnce, when I mentioned this to second-year medical students, one raised his hand, “We learned empathy already.” What? “Yes, last year in interviewing. Empathy is when you repeat the last three words the patient says and nod your head.”\n\n[Harvard Medical School commencement, 2009]\n\nSamuel Shem\n\n[1] I make my patients feel like they’re still part of life, part of some grand nutty scheme instead of alone with their diseases. With me, they still feel part of the human race.\n\n[2] You’ve always perched yourself at a slight angle to the universe.\n\n[Assorted, from The House of God]\n\nJoe Connelly\n\nI usually try to imagine what a regular person would do, someone more in tune with the supplies and demands of human nature, and once I realize a regular person would never find himself in this position, I try to think like a hero in the movies.\n\n[Bringing Out the Dead, novel]\n\nPaul Schrader\n\nIt’s not your fault. No one asked you to suffer. That was your idea.\n\n[Bringing Out the Dead, film]\n\nAtul Gawande\n\nAt times, in medicine, you feel you are inside a colossal and impossibly complex machine whose gears will turn for you only according to their own arbitrary rhythm. The notion that human caring, the effort to do better for people, might make a difference can seem hopelessly naive. But it isn’t.\n\n[Better]\n\nUnknown\n\nThe modest merits of this good citizen may, so far as the public are concerned, be summed up in the simple statement that he has saved upwards of 30 lives from drowning. When we consider what are the awards usually apportioned by mankind to the destroyers of their species, the presentation of a gold watch and chain, accompanied by a framed parchment from the Royal Humane Society, in the precincts of a disused School Room, must appear an inadequate acknowledgment of services so signal. But we are new at the business and shall improve as we go forward.\n\n[Town of Sunderland, recognizing Harry Watts for the individual rescue of thirty-six near-drownings. Quoted in Life of Harry Watts: Sixty years sailor and diver]\n\nAlfred Spencer\n\nThere is a hackneyed platitude to the effect that virtue is its own reward, but it is safe to say that the average man does not find such a result sufficient. It might be so in an ideal world inhabited by ideal people, but in this work-a-day world, in addition to the approval of our conscience, we love to have the approval of our fellows and to know that our acts are appreciated, and especially is this the case when we are actuated by altruistic motives. This is, of course, a form of vanity, but then vanity is almost a universal failing.\n\n[Life of Harry Watts: Sixty years sailor and diver]\n\nJeph Jacques\n\nMaturity is knowing you were an idiot in the past. Wisdom is knowing that you’ll be an idiot in the future. And common sense is knowing that you should try not to be an idiot now.\n\n[Questionable Content]\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche\n\nHow much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray?\n\n[From Beyond Good and Evil, on Spinoza]\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche\n\nTwo different things wanteth the true man: danger and diversion. Therefore wanteth he woman, as the most dangerous plaything.\n\n[Thus Spake Zaruthustra]\n\nAnais Nin\n\nI want to leave a scar on the world.\n\n[Henry and June]\n\nRichard Linklater\n\n[1] As the pattern gets more intricate and subtle, being swept along is no longer enough.\n\n[2] Giacometti was once run down by a car, and he recalled falling into a lucid faint, a sudden exhilaration, as he realized that — at last — something was happening to him.\n\n[3] Exercise your human mind as thoroughly as possible, knowing it is only an exercise. Build beautiful artifacts, solve problems, explore the secrets of the physical universe, savor the input from all the senses.\n\n[4] The trick is to combine your waking, rational abilities with the infinite possibilities of your dreams — ’cause if you can do that, you can do anything.\n\n[5] I have but recently returned from the valley of the shadow of death. I am raptorously breathing in all the odors and essences of life. I’ve been the brink of total oblivion. I’ve remembered and ferment a desire to remember everything.\n\n[Assorted, from Waking Life]\n\n!Kung bushman\n\nWhy should we plant, when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?\n\n[Quoted in Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers]\n\nMalcolm Gladwell\n\nHe’d had to make his way alone, and no one — not rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses — ever makes it alone.\n\n[Outliers]\n\nJohn L Parker\n\nYou don’t even get to play unless you have already won the genetic lottery. Then you have to win the nurture lottery, then the happenstance lottery, and then just in general be incredibly lucky in every conceivable way, and then you will have earned the right to work your ass off like most civilians could never possibly imagine. Then you might — might — get to stand up there like a dodo all teary-eyed pretending you knew the words to your anthem.\n\n[Again to Carthage]\n\nWilliam Faulkner\n\nthey kilt us but they ain’t whupped us yit\n\n[“Wash”]\n\nLeonardo DaVinci\n\nWhen once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always want to be.\n\n[attributed to Leonardo DaVinci]\n\nUnknown\n\nIn an apparently non-political case of imitation of Thich Quang Duc, the young son of an American officer based at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire. He was seriously burned before the fire was extinguished and later could only offer the explanation that “I wanted to see what it was like.”\n\n[Wikipedia on Thich Quang Duc]\n\nEric Weinberg\n\nI love you and there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it.\n\n[Scrubs, “My Words of Wisdom”]\n\nPrentice Penny\n\nWhy do I want to be a doctor? Well... because doctors give people second chances. And we all deserve a second chance.\n\n[Scrubs, “Our Couples”]\n\nRichard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy\n\nYou need to resign yourself to the awkwardness of life. Only if you find peace within yourself will you find true connection with others.\n\n[Before Sunset]\n\nChris Adrian\n\nIt seemed a marvel to her that any mortal should suffer for lack of love, and yet she had never known a mortal who didn’t feel unloved. There was enough love just in this ugly hallway, she thought, that no one should ever feel the lack of it again. She peered at the parents, imagining their hearts like machines, manufacturing surfeit upon surfeit of love for their children, and then wondered how something could be so awesome and so utterly powerless.\n\n[“A Tiny Feast,” The New Yorker, April 20, 2009]\n\nCarolyn Delaney\n\nHe always said if there was any way he could help someone, he would.\n\n[On her late husband Joe Delaney, killed rescuing three children from drowning; quoted by CollegeFootball.org (now unavailable)]\n\nJoe Posnanski\n\nHe had track-star speed, but what caught you was the way he attacked bigger men, ran fearlessly through tiny fractures of daylight.\n\n[On Joe Delaney, from NepaChiefs.com (now unavailable)]\n\nAnonymous\n\nI think I am in love.\n\nAnd I don’t know if I want to be.\n\nI am kind of scared.\n\n[PostSecret]\n\nMichael Allin\n\nIt is difficult to associate these horrors with the proud civilizations that created them: Sparta, Rome, the knights of Europe, the samurai... they worshipped strength, because it is strength that makes all other values possible. Nothing survives without it. Who knows what delicate wonders have died out of the world, for want of the strength to survive.\n\n[Enter the Dragon]\n\nDavid Mamet\n\nThose who have “something to fall back on” invariably fall back on it. They intended to all along. That’s why they provided themselves with it. But those with no alternative see the world differently.\n\n[Unknown]\n\nWilliam James\n\n[1] We find hope satisfactory.\n\n[2] As they stand, they remind one of Hegel’s man who wanted “fruit,” but rejected cherries, pears, and grapes, because they were not fruit in the abstract. We offer them the full quart-pot, and they cry for the empty quart-capacity.\n\n[Assorted, from The Meaning of Truth]\n\nNeil Gaiman\n\nHe was close enough that Shadow could see his face: old but contented, the face of a man who had sipped life’s vinegar and found it, by and large, to be mostly whiskey, and good whiskey at that.\n\n[American Gods]\n\nMark Twight\n\nCan you feel how empty and hollow your days are, how devoid of meaning? Have you forgotten what it’s like to really live a day that fulfills you deeply as a human being?\n\n[From the old Gym Jones website]\n\nJoe Simpson\n\nIt seemed, sometimes, fleetingly, you could come close to the ineffable edge of perfection when it all goes to glory for the briefest of moments, an inarticulate moment, that leaves you with a vulnerable shattered sense of wonderment. It was life enhancing: pure emotion.\n\n[On mountaineering, from The Beckoning Silence]\n\nEli Attie\n\nI would rather spend my life close to the birds than waste it wishing I had wings.\n\n[House, “Dying Changes Everything”]\n\nDavid Shore\n\nThere’s no cure for dying.\n\n[House, “One Day, One Room”]\n\nUnknown\n\nMay I never see in the patient anything but a fellow creature in pain.\n\n[Oath of Maimonides]\n\nMax Ehrmann\n\nAnd whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its shams, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.\n\n[“Desiderata”]\n\nSamuel Gross\n\nThe person, although severely injured, congratulates himself upon having made an excellent escape, and flatters himself that he is not only in no danger, but that he will soon be well; in fact, to look at him one would hardly suppose, at first sight, that there was anything serious the matter with him; the countenance appears well, the breathing is good, the pulse is but little affected, except that it is too soft and frequent, and the mind, calm and collected, possesses its wonted vigor, the patient asking and answering questions very much as in health. But a more careful examination soon serves to show that deep mischief is lurking in the system; that the machinery of life has been rudely unhinged, and the whole system profoundly shocked; in a word, that the nervous fluid has been exhausted, and that there is not enough power in the constitution to reproduce and maintain it.\n\n[A System of Surgery, on shock]\n\nWilfred Trotter\n\nDisease often tells its secrets in a casual parenthesis.\n\n[The Collected Papers of Wilfred Trotter]\n\nEric Roston\n\nCarbon structures life. Oxygen ignites it.\n\n[The Carbon Age]\n\nUnknown\n\nIt was a common practice to light a bonfire close to any shipwreck that could not be rescued immediately. This was done to let the surfmen have enough light to see the shipwreck, help keep the watching surfman warm, and let the survivors of the shipwreck know that they had not been abandoned.\n\n[Wikipedia article on Joshua James]"
