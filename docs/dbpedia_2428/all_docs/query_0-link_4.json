        "text": "At the beginning of the First World War junior officers for the volunteer ‘New Army’ units of the British Army were often recruited from outside of the traditional officer class, with local commanders being given considerable discretion in awarding commissions. This was the case with the 36th (Ulster) Division were many of the officers, along with the rank and file were recruited directly from the Ulster Volunteer Force. From 1916 a new system of officer selection was introduced with the creation of Officer Training Battalions. This paper looks at the experience of William Oswald who was commissioned into the 36th Division in 1914, was subsequently forced to resign his commission, served in the ranks, and was commissioned again in 1918. By examining his experience, it provides an insight into how the commissioning process worked in the early and later stages of the War.\n\nThis is a study of the development of the tactical and operational methods of the 12th Division of the British Expeditionary Force in France in the First World War. It seeks to explore the development of the tactical and operational practices of the 12th Division, and by extrapolation the BEF, during the course of the war. ‘Tactics’ and ‘operations’ (the latter is admittedly an anachronism) are ill-defined words, particularly in the case of the First World War. Exactly where the dividing line between tactics and operations lies is not of great importance: this study simply examines the way in which the 12th Division sought to achieve the objectives laid down for it by higher commands. This obviously removes from consideration matters in which the Division had no say, such as the debate over whether attacks should aim for a ‘breakthrough’, or ‘bite and hold’. Tactics and operations range from the use of individual weapons, such as hand grenades and rifles, by small groups of men, to the detailed plans of artillery bombardments and infantry formations drawn up for major offensives. This study does not attempt to give a narrative account of the service of the 12th Division during the First World War. Nor, for reasons of space, can it consider every offensive and defensive action made by the 12th Division. Analysis therefore focuses on the major battles of the Division. The focus is on offensive rather than defensive action, since the BEF was on the strategic and operational offensive for the majority of the war. In addition, the soldiers of the BEF trained primarily for offensive action. Space restrictions also mean that this study concentrates on the infantry and artillery of the 12th Division. It must, however, be observed that many other branches of the Division also played important parts in the preparation for, and the conduct of, the Division’s war service: for example, the pioneers, Royal Engineers, Royal Army Service Corps and Royal Army Medical Corps.\n\nMICHAEL DUREY For the past thirty years historians have focused on examining the processes involved in turning the British Army into a war-winning force by the second half of 1918. The trajectory of the army's development as it discovered and implemented a successful combined arms strategy has sometimes been described as a 'learning curve'. This concept embraces much more than battlefield tactics and includes analysis of the development of military doctrine and training programmes; logistics; the use of new technology; and command and control at the higher echelons of the BEF (divisions, corps and armies). 1 The learning curve has had its critics and even some of those who accept its basic premise see it as more like a rollercoaster than a smooth upward curve. 2 All, however, acknowledge that the process accelerated with the Battle of the Somme, when the enormous quantities of military hardware essential for success-not just shells for the artillery but Lewis guns and trench mortars for the infantry, tanks and better aeroplanes for the RFC-became available and the \"new\" British Army underwent its first major trial in an offensive campaign on the continent. 3 Moreover, the full arsenal of military arms required to achieve battlefield success only arrived in the middle"
