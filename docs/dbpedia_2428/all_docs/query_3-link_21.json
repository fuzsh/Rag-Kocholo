        "text": "Glasgow Lord Provost G0.\n\nGlasgow also has V 0 at its disposal, having inherited it when Strathclyde Regional Council was abolished in 1996.\n\nSeems Edinburgh set the trend for '0' plates north of the border, when S 0 was specially issued for the Lord Provost's official car after they missed out on S 1 to motoring pioneer Sir John MacDonald at its initial release in 1904. (S 1 remained in the MacDonald family until last September, when it was sold for just under £400k.)\n\nNot to be outdone, Glasgow later secured G 0 after failing to persuade the then-owner, a Mr A Anderson, MD of local car dealership James H Galt Ltd, to part with G 1.\n\nOther Scottish '0' plates include:\n\nHS 0 - East Renfrewshire\n\nRG 0 - Aberdeen\n\nSY 0 - Midlothian\n\nVS 0 - Inverclyde\n\nIncidentally, we have a former Lord Provost of Edinburgh to thank for the fact that the Lord Mayor of London's official car is registered LM 0. Sir James Miller was appointed Lord Mayor of London in 1964, and promptly arranged for the City of London to be issued with a '0' plate of its own. Twelve years earlier, his predecessor Sir Rupert de la Bere (or Bôre) had acquired the plates LM 1 and LM 2 to mark his appointment as Lord Mayor, but chose to retain them upon leaving office.\n\ni didn't know that we had V0 as well.\n\nCouncils are bloody good to themselves with our money.\n\nTop be fair, in most cases councils either reserved these plates when they were first issued or were subsequently issued with them free of charge for their exclusive use. To that extent, they have not actually squandered public money on acquiring them. You could also argue that many of them would actually have been better off investing in number plates rather than depositing their reserves in shaky Icelandic banks...\n\nHowever, bearing in mind the prices that the more attractive registrations attract these days, there is mounting public pressure for civic plates to be surrendered for sale (regardless of whether the proceeds would go to the council or to the government via the DVLA's coffers). The other issue is that in some cases it seems the DVLA is effectively leasing plates to councils. Where this is the case, many are now opting to hand the plates back at the end of the term and replacing them with Select registrations.\n\nIt's not just the plates, of course. The once de rigueur Rolls-Royce, Daimler or Coleman Milne is now likely to be replaced with a Lexus or Prius hybrid or a value-conscious Skoda Superb when the time comes. Doubtless some would like to go much further, and get rid of the cars – or even the officials themselves – altogether.\n\nPersonally speaking, I don't have a problem with mayors/provosts having the use of a distinguished official car with a distinctive plate, provided the council itself is being run efficiently. When the City of Westminster needed to replace their well cared-for but ageing Daimler DS420, they opted for a secondhand Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph and also secured a significant discount on the advertised price. That was around 7 years ago, yet it never fails to look resplendent, while its WE 1 plate - which in a former life was assigned to West Indies High Commission - lends the car an ageless grace.\n\nBearing in mind the recent posts about ST 1 and provosts' registrations, just thought I'd mention that when The Saint TV series was being filmed in the 1960s, the real ST 1 plate was securely attached to the Bentley of solicitor Robert Wotherspoon, who had served as Provost of Inverness from 1955-61. He was reportedly \"unconcerned\" at its use in the series, suggesting that his permission had not actively been sought. Incidentally, with ST originally being an Inverness-shire combination, one of Mr Wotherspoon's successors, Bill Fraser (provost from 1992-96), currently has SST 500 on his Rolls-Royce.\n\nMr Wotherspoon died in 1968, and I believe his widow granted permission for ST 1 to be used in 1970s series The Return of The Saint, which also occasionally featured a BMW R100RS motorbike with the just-for-show number ST 2.\n\nBy the time of the next TV outing for the Saint in 1989, Mrs Wotherspoon had long-since passed away and ST 1 had been bought by London-based solicitor Mrs S Tosswill for £15k. This time the producers could not obtain permission to use the plate on Simon Dutton's Jensen Interceptor, so instead resorted to using the then-unissued alternative 1 ST by special arrangement with Swansea. Not surprisingly, within a couple of years 1 ST was offered for sale in one of the early DVLA auctions, making a very reasonable £24k.\n\nMrs Tosswill presumably later had a change of heart (or perhaps a better offer) as ST 1 was back in use on Val Kilmer's Volvo C70 in the 1997 film The Saint. Fast forward to 2005, and ST 1 hit the headlines when it was offered for sale at a cool £150k. Not sure whether there were any takers, but it was still reported to be with Mrs Tosswill as recently as last year, although we know that in the meantime it has migrated from a Mini to a blue 2002 5-door Mercedes-Benz A190 Elegance. Its counterpart, 1 ST, is currently on a blue 2006 Mercedes-Benz S500. Still no sign of ST 2...\n\nThere are several sites out there that use data from the DVLA database to provide basic details.\n\nI tend to use http://www.tyre-shopper.co.uk/ts/search/VRMSearch.aspx, as it allows you to search by just entering the registration and it doesn't care whether they're taxed/insured/sorn'd/etc. It also often returns data that doesn't show up elsewhere, which suggests they are archiving older datasets rather than overwriting them. For instance, it returns my own cars' details whether I search on their original registrations or their private plates.\n\nWord of warning, though: it does also seem to contain some frankly bonkers info. For instance, WV 1 is shown as being on a \"5-door Austin Mini 1000 hathcback\". It's actually on a Volvo V50...\n\nNo sign of 129 DXD, by the way.\n\nI think the wrong info in most cases is the previous car the plate was on."
