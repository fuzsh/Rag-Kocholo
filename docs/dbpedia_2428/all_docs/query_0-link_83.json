During their time with us, the students were invited to write blog posts documenting their experience.\n\nRead below about what they learned in our Glass Studio.\n\n“We met Glass Technician Philippa Beveridge in the glass studio. Philippa introduced us to the two wonderful Glass Fellows, Mils Bridgewater and Valentino Vannini. They spoke about their inspirations and their pathways to getting to the stage they are at now. Valentino started in the fashion industry and Mils started in the painting industry, and they both decided to explore glass-making in their practice. They mention that glass is a ‘liquid of finite viscosity’ which describes the resistance of the flow of glass and really interested us as a group.\n\nPhillipa spoke about her projects and what interested her. She discussed one of her works, where she used a breastplate that acted as a canvas which reflected and mirrored the glass pieces while distorting them like memories. Mils showed us a recent piece she is working on, and explained the process of how she made it. She started by pouring wax on a spherical object, and created different textures by layering the wax. She then placed a mold, and heated the wax until it melted to remove it from the mold. She poured the hot glass in the mold until it cooled, and then took it out of the mold. This created a nice texture on the glass that looked like marbled stone. It was fascinating that she mentioned glass being flexible, which is different from the way it is seen as a hard surface, but it’s a nice material to work with.\n\nAnother member of the Art School who can be found tinkering with glass is Valentino Vannini. Originally having worked in the fashion industry in Italy, Valentino moved to the UK looking for a change. Interested in representing the tangible weight of objects, Valentino decided to develop his drawing skills, which are crucial in nearly all art disciplines, at the Royal Drawing School. Ironically, Valentino’s first response to glass as a medium was not a necessarily positive one – it didn’t sit well with him. However, the task in trying to manipulate and change glass’s state, no matter how difficult, challenged Valentino’s skills, and soon he became obsessed. Recently, Valentino has utilised glass to its fullest by investigating the idea of boundaries, specifically breakable boundaries. The idea of a wall or fence being constructed from the most delicate of materials is poetic in a sense, raising questions of inclusivity and sensitivity. Valentino’s process for this project is simple – using a regular tealight, he bends strings of glass in a way that they can be meshed to form a fence, then interlaced with pink, flower-like objects. This showed us how accessible glasswork is for people, and that you could make something beautiful like Valentino’s glass fences in the comfort of your own home.\n\nHearing the stories of Philippa, Mills and Valentino has been really intriguing; the complexity and precision, and yet unpredictable experimentation that goes into glassware is incredible, and I would highly encourage anyone to look into this field if you haven’t already.”\n\nWords and Images by Work Experience Students, Summer 2024\n\nWork Experience | The Wood Workshop\n\nLast month, a group of students joined us for Work Experience at City & Guilds of London Art School. During their time with us, the students were invited to write blog posts documenting their experience.\n\nRead below about what they learned in our Wood Workshop.\n\n“During our work experience at the City & Guilds of London Art School, we spent a day touring the various workshops, including the wood workshop. Here, we met the Wood Workshop Technician, Art School alumna and sculptor Ana Kazaroff. Ana began studying psychology at university in Argentina, but after discovering her passion for art, she completed a Masters in Fine Art at City & Guilds of London Art School, where she also trained in woodwork and decorative surfaces. Her practice involves teaching students how to create sculptures with wood and supporting the other departments at the Art School, such as making boxes, processing logs and providing necessary materials for the students.\n\nThe woodwork studio is equipped with several machines and tools, that are used for many tasks from processing raw logs to carving and refining, that would be hard to access elsewhere. Ana also explained that there are no more than around five students working in the studio at a time, creating an easy-going atmosphere, as the studio isn’t crowded and allowing for more one-to-one time with the technician.\n\nOutside the Art School, Ana creates large wooden sculptures, painted to mimic different textures such as marble, and less conventional textures like salami and terrazzo. Preferring to work with wood rather than alternatives like metal or glass, she finds wood a more simple and calming material due to its flexibility, as she doesn’t have to follow exact measurements and can take away from or add to it at any time. A large part of her technique involves compromising between making the wood light enough to sculpt, but also strong enough, usually opting to hollow it out. She also uses more specialised techniques such as burning the wood to leave a glossy finish.\n\nAfter asking about Ana’s biggest challenges with woodwork, she explained that wood, being a natural material, can be unpredictable and slightly change its shape after it is cut, which could be a problem when aiming for precision. Sometimes, the design has to be adapted to the material rather than the other way round. There are also more technical challenges such as health and safety and managing space.”\n\nWords and Images by Work Experience Students, Summer 2024\n\nBA Fine Art Years 1 & 2 Interim Show 2024\n\nLast month, our First and Second year BA (Hons) Fine Art students showcased their latest body of work at their Interim Show, ‘Salon’. The exhibition ran from 20th-22nd June, hosted at Stokey Popup, Stoke Newington.\n\nFeaturing work by 40 students, the exhibition demonstrated their variety of disciplinary styles and practices, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, performance and installation.\n\nThe Professional Practice Programme on the BA (Hons) Fine Art course sets out to prepare students for life after art school through a range of study visits, seminars and artist talks by art world professionals and competitions and prizes to apply for. In addition, this student led offsite exhibition project offers a valuable opportunity for students’ part-way through their studies to collaborate on all aspects of putting on a show, developing the adjacent skills required for a career as a professional artist.\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us for the BA Interim Show 2024.\n\nWork Experience | Gallery Visit\n\nAt the end of June, we were delighted to be joined by a number of Work Experience students at City & Guilds of London Art School. As part of the experience, the students were invited to write blog posts documenting their time at the Art School.\n\nRead below about their experience visiting Tate Britain.\n\n“We visited the Tate Britain and saw many paintings and sculptures. We really enjoyed the room ‘A Room of One’s Own’. You could see the oil paint in the paintings; the layering of paint and the surface varying from flat and smooth, to thick layers. In this room, we explored new representations of female identity. It showed us the changing relationships between men and women in society. We also visited the room with the artists Francis Bacon and Henry Moore. A lot of us really enjoyed the Henry Moore sculptures since they were quite abstract and not something we had been exposed to before, which really drew our eyes towards them. Back in the studio, we learned how to use oil paint since we weren’t all used to using it, and a few of us just did drawings in pencil. We either replicated a painting or sculpture we liked in Tate Britain or came up with our own ideas. We started adding oil pastels to our work to make our drawings and paintings more dramatic and add texture to them.” Elijah\n\n“We visited Tate Britain on the second day of our work experience. It was great to see some of the contemporary arts, but the paintings that caught my attention the most were the ones in the historical part of the gallery. The paintings by Philip Wilson really were really interesting, not only because of the concepts but also because of his painting technique of having very visible brushstrokes in the painting. I used this technique for my painting in the afternoon.” Isabella\n\n“On today’s trip for work experience, we visited the Tate Britain which I enjoyed, as we saw various works; sculptures, paintings, abstract and realism. I enjoyed seeing the nineteenth century paintings, most of which I think were from the aestheticism movement as they were meticulously detailed and captured lighting incredibly well. We then returned to the studio where I spent a few hours on an acrylic painting. I found it quite tricky, since acrylic is new to me, but I learned some useful tips from Hope about canvas priming and using it as a translucent wash. I also enjoyed that the group was small, since it felt more friendly and connected with the others.” Adrianna\n\n“We visited the Tate Britain and we saw a vast variety of pieces ranging in material and style, such as surrealist paintings and statues and paintings from the Renaissance. A notable work for me was a statue by Frederic Leighton – An Athlete Wrestling with a Python (1877). Another was from the room ‘A Room of One’s Own’ at Tate Britain: Philip Wilson Steer’s ‘Seated Nude: The Black Hat’ (1900). Both pieces left a strong impression on me. I was inspired by the dynamic shadows cast on Frederic’s statue, and I was immediately attracted to the silhouette of Phillip’s painting. I tried to be experimental with my work and use simple blocky shapes to communicate a more telling story, using the intense shadows from the statue (Leighton) and the figure’s silhouette (Steer, and from Herbert Draper’s ‘The Lament for Icarus’). I took one figure from Herbert’s work and one from Steer’s.” Jazz\n\n“We spent the day visiting Tate Britain and sketching the work there. It was interesting to talk as a group about specific artworks. Personally, my favourite work we saw was ‘The Mirror’. I enjoyed challenging myself by attempting acrylic painting, and working in the studios was pretty cool. It was a really interesting day and I’m looking forward to next week.” Joseph\n\nCelebrating our graduates at the Degree Show 2024\n\nOn Friday 21st June, the City & Guilds of London Art School community came together to celebrate our BA Fine Art, Carving and Conservation graduates at their end of year Ceremony and Prize-Giving.\n\nThe Deputy Chair of the Board of Trustees, Laurence Benson, opened the evening and introduced the Art School Principal Dr. Lois Rowe, who congratulated our graduating students and welcomed our guests.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Board of Trustees, Laurence Benson\n\nThis year, we were delighted to award an Honorary Art School Fellowship to former Vice Principal, Magnus von Wistinghausen, in recognition of his significant contributions to the Art School, from leading major improvements to the campus and facilities, to expanding the student bursary programme, which now provides support to 40% of the student body.\n\n“A great source of strength and resilience is the sense of community this school exudes – a community respectful and caring of each individual and their contributions, across generations and at different stages of creative life journeys. Something very special and palpable, and not all that often found.” Magnus von Wistinghausen, Honorary Art School Fellow and former Vice Principal\n\nDr. Rowe welcomed London-based artist Sokari Douglas Camp CBE, who recently joined the Art School as one of our new trustees, to give an address to our graduating students. Sokari generously shared insight into her most recent commission, and words of advice for our students.\n\n“Continue your intuition, and be as positive as you can, because this world is here for conversation.” Sokari Douglas Camp CBE, Art School Trustee\n\nThe Heads of Department, Tom Young (Head of Carving), Dr Marina Sokhan (Head of Conservation) and Andy Bannister (Acting Course Leader – Fine Art) presented the certificates and prizes to the graduating students, and each thanked their teams for their hard work.

The winner receives three days access to our Print Room, where they can explore and develop their printing skills alongside our tutors, fellows and students.\n\nOur warmest thanks to Jack for visiting us and for an inspiring talk.\n\nBA Fine Art student featured in a-n Degree Shows Guide 2024\n\nWe were thrilled to see third year BA (Hons) Fine Art student Eleanor Cunningham featured in this year’s a-n Degree Shows Guide.\n\nStudents are selected from the guide by open call, and Eleanor was amongst 31 artists from 28 UK art schools featured this year.\n\nEleanor Cunningham, Laura Wearing the Pigeon Mask, 112 x 44cm, papier-mache and acrylic paint, 2023.\n\n“Using simple papier-mache techniques, Eleanor Cunningham creates garish masks, often of animals and recognisable characters. In works such as Laura Wearing the Pigeon Mask, there is a playfulness that perhaps belies a darker undercurrent, with Cunningham saying the masks are designed to be “worn by anyone brave enough to be immersed into a state of performance while wearing them, which I then photograph and use to draw and paint from”. The resulting paintings take on a much more unsettling version of the masks, which have begun to take over the participant’s body in the form of a ‘second skin’.”\n\nThe full a-n Degree Shows Guide 2024 can be accessed here.\n\nOur Degree Show is open from 22-28 June 2024. Please see full visiting information and our opening hours on our event page.\n\nSenior Woodcarving Tutor interviewed in Woodcarving Magazine\n\nTom Ball, de Laszlo Senior Woodcarving Tutor and professional carver, was recently featured in the 200th edition of Woodcarving Magazine.\n\nInterviewed by Guest Editor Steve Bisco, Tom discussed how he began his career, his training at City & Guilds of London Art School and his work in carving, conservation and restoration, including restoration work on Grinling Gibbons carvings.\n\nThe interview concluded with Tom asked, as a tutor, what advice he would give to someone thinking of pursuing a career in carving.\n\n“Become as diverse as possible – woodcarving is a great skill but also concentrate on other areas like joinery, gilding, casting and letter cutting. Why also limit yourself to wood? Stone carving follows a very similar process and is a great way to increase your reach. I would also add that City & Guilds of London Art School is the go-to if you are serious about carving as a career. It is now the only place left in the country that offers full-time three-year courses in wood or stone carving and you can even do an MA in carving there. Finally, draw, draw and then draw. It really is the fundamental skill to get your head around understanding complex forms and movement. Best of luck and keep chipping away.”\n\nCheck out the 200th edition of Woodcarving Magazine to read the full interview.\n\nLondon Craft Week 2024 at the Art School\n\nLast month, we were delighted to host our annual London Craft Week event.\n\nOver Friday 17 and Saturday 18 May, visitors joined us for our exciting two-day programme of activities celebrating specialist craft skills.\n\nThe programme kicked off on Friday morning with the start of the Annual Carving Competition. First year woodcarving and stone carving students are challenged to complete an original work within 12 hours, split across the two days. Each year, the competition is centred around a different theme, which this year was ‘Under the Sea’.\n\nAnnual wood and stone carving competition\n\nWe were thrilled to be joined by 2013 carving alumna and distinguished stone carver Anna Rubincam and Miranda Lowe CBE, Principal Curator of Crustacea at the Natural History Museum and Chair of Culture&, as our judges for this year’s competition. During the prize-giving, Anna and Miranda commended the level of work created by our students in the time allocated, and the diversity of subject matter. Well done to all those who took part, and a huge congratulations to our winners:\n\nFirst Prize Stone Carving, sponsored by the Mason’s Company – Mark Thompson, BA (Hons) Carving: Architectural Stone\n\nFirst Prize Woodcarving, sponsored by Dick Onians – Alec Stevens, BA (Hons) Carving: Woodcarving & Gilding\n\nSecond Prize Stone Carving, sponsored by the Mason’s Company – Charlotte Ellery, BA (Hons) Carving: Architectural Stone\n\nSecond Prize Woodcarving, sponsored by Dick Onians and the William Wheeler’s People’s Choice Award – Joss Trevena.

The students were joined by Decorative Surfaces Fellow Eloise Dethier-Eaton, who demonstrated Trompe-l’œil painting techniques.\n\nConservation Demonstrations\n\nDecorative Surfaces Demonstrations\n\nOver in our historic print room, visitors had the opportunity to take part in printmaking workshops with Print Fellow Ben Topping. Ben ran a series of workshops on the traditional process of Intaglio printing, where participants were taught how to create beautiful debossed prints using a variety of materials to create texture and without using ink.\n\nPrintmaking workshops\n\nA number of exhibitions were on display throughout the Art School over the weekend. Visitors were greeted in the atrium by an exhibition of work by our National Saturday Club members, who have been learning 2D and 3D heritage craft skills at the Art School every Saturday this academic year. Our members had a range of their work on display, including carved frames, prints, examples of paper marbling and verre églomisé. Visitors also enjoyed an exhibition of entries for the Art School’s Taylor Pearce Drawing Prize, open to students on our Carving and Conservation degree programmes, and the Roger de Grey Drawing Prize.\n\nExhibition of work by National Saturday Club members\n\nOur sponsors and artisan beer company, Fabal Lager, held a free Talk & Tasting in the Art School café, where visitors learned about their locally-sourced ingredients, commitment to sustainability and championing of craftsmanship.\n\nTalk & Tasting with Fabal Lager\n\nThank you to our sponsors, The Masons’ Company Craft Fund, The Carpenters’ Company, Dick Onians and Fabal Lager, and thank you to everyone who visited and took part.

Pippa introduced us to her art practice, methods, and concepts. It was very exciting for our members to see the day-to-day operations of an artist – our thanks to Pippa for an inspiring visit.\n\nWe then looked around the 40 studios on site. It was a great opportunity for our members to meet artists working in Deptford and find out how they began a career in the arts. The day ended with a visit to the Drawing Open exhibition at no format Gallery, where we discussed curation, framing and drawing techniques.\n\nOur members have been continuing their work in stone and glass, and we are excited to see them installed in Somerset House for the National Saturday Club’s end of year celebration. Thank you to tutors Mark Frith and Pippa Beveridge, Glass Fellow Mils Bridgewater, and student assistants Alex Stone, Louis Power and Six Alyss Hotchkiss.\n\nCelebrating our 2024 Foundation Graduates\n\nLast week, we were delighted to celebrate the hard work of our Foundation Diploma in Art & Design 2024 graduates at their end of year show, which ran from 15-18 May.\n\nOn Tuesday 14 May, friends and family of the students were invited to preview the show, before which we hosted the end of year prize giving.\n\nDeputy Chair of Trustees Laurence Benson welcomed those in attendance before introducing the Art School Principal, Dr Lois Rowe. Addressing the students, Dr Rowe thanked and commended the students for their work in the show, commenting:\n\n“The work is ambitious, and what I found fascinating was the focus on materiality and really diverse process. Some of you use found objects… and the thing which is important about this kind of work is its energy. It isn’t driven by how it might look on a plinth or a wall – a lot of the work in this show demonstrates this creative energy, and it has been such a pleasure to witness. We are so impressed by what everyone has achieved this year.”\n\nDeep thanks were given to the Foundation Teaching Staff and Technicians, who have supported the students in achieving the outstanding outcomes as seen in the show.\n\nThe 2024 Prizes were awarded to:\n\nThe Skinners’ Company Vargas Eyres Design Prize – Harry McCallum\n\nPrize for an Outstanding Foundation 2D Fine-Art Student – Joné Esterhuysen\n\nPrize for an Outstanding Foundation 3D Fine-Art Student – Ester Haward\n\nPrincipal’s Prize for Outstanding Work at the Foundation Show – Hannah Jose and Georgia Gundy\n\nCity & Guilds Of London Art School Scholarship – Delia Madden\n\nThank you to everyone who visited the Foundation Show 2024, and please join us again soon for the Degree Show 2024.\n\nLATE APPLICATIONS\n\nThere are a few last spaces on our 2024/25 Foundation Diploma in Art & Design, with full fee bursaries available.\n\nFind out more and submit your application via the ‘Apply’ page of our website.\n\nFoundation Show 2024\n\nYou are warmly invited to our Foundation Show 2023, taking place from Wednesday 15 May – Saturday 18 May 2024.\n\nThe show is a celebration of the outstanding work of our 2023 graduates studying Foundation Diploma in Art & Design.

Held on Saturday 20 April at London Building Crafts College, the participants each carved a low relief panel of scrolling foliage.\n\nCongratulations Henry and Alice!\n\nPhoto credit: Worshipful Company of Joiners & Ceilers\n\nExploring new techniques in glass and stone\n\nThis week, our National Saturday Club members continued their exploration of historical stone lettering techniques and glass cutting.\n\nOur 2D members, led by Tutor Pippa Beveridge and Glass Fellows Roberta De Caro and Holly Hooper, worked in our glass studio.\n\nMoving on from clear glass cutting, our members began their coloured creations. Our members based their artworks upon real or imagined buildings and used various glass techniques, such as grinding and oil cutting. Next week we will be moving on to soldering each individual piece together to create the finished work.\n\nOur 3D members continued making great progress with their stone letting. Thank you to tutor Mark Frith and students Louis Power (BA Carving: Architectural Stone) and Six Alyse Hotchkiss (Graduate Diploma Arts: Carving) for their wonderful guidance.\n\nStone, glass and cityscapes\n\nThis week, our 3D members, led by tutor Mark Frith and students, Louis Power (BA Carving: Architectural Stone) and Six Alyse Hotchkiss (Graduate Diploma Arts: Carving) continued their works in stone.\n\nHaving chosen the word ‘illusion’ last week, our members began transferring their sketches to their stone blocks. Chisels hit limestone, and the carving began.\n\nOur 2D members, led by Tutor Pippa Beveridge and Glass Fellows Roberta De Caro and Holly Hooper, were introduced to our glass workshop.\n\nTaking inspiration from last week’s trip to Two Temple Place, our members began making fused glass cityscapes. Influences raged from iconic London buildings, such as Big Ben to local pubs. The group sketched their buildings and then were taught how to cut glass and fuse it together. We can’t wait to see how the works look once they’re out of the kiln.\n\nExploring Stained Glass and Stone Carving\n\nLast Saturday was our National Saturday Club’s first week back after the Spring break. Each group is now studying a new subject, with our 3D members learning the art of lettering and our 2D members exploring the Tiffany technique of stained glass.\n\nTo introduce our 2D members to stained glass, we enjoyed a tour of ‘The Glass Heart’ exhibition at Two Temple Place. Ranging from 19th century to contemporary experimental glass work, the exhibition examines how glass-making in the UK contains and expresses stories. Our members engaged with the artworks, planning their cityscapes for the following weeks and creating sketches of the works in the exhibition. A huge thank you to Two Temple Place and to Fay for hosting us, and for an enlightening visit.\n\nOur 3D members, led by Lettering Tutor Mark Frith, Graduate Diploma Arts: Carving: Architectural Stone student Six Alyse Hotchkiss, and BA (Hons) Fine Art student Louis Power, were introduced to stone carving. Members worked together to choose an eight-letter word, and each will carve a single letter using a variety of carving techniques. Our members traced the outline of their limestone block, and, using medieval lettering for inspiration, began to plan their artwork. Watch this space!\n\nStudent success in British Art Medal Society Student Medal Project\n\nWe are delighted to share that four of our students had their work accepted for this year’s British Art Medal Society Student Medal Project, with first year BA (Hons) Carving: Woodcarving and Gilding student Jocelyn Trevena winning the Michael Robert Memorial Prize for her medal ‘Agatha’. This prize is awarded for ‘subtle portraiture, with details that reflect on earlier traditions of making, an edge that links the two sides, and a reverse with an effective change of scale’.\n\nDr Dora Thornton, Curator of the Goldsmiths’ Company Collection and one of the judges of this year’s prizes wrote in her introduction in the BAMS Student Medal Project Catalogue 2024:\n\n“One medal that impressed me for its sense of taking its place in a long European tradition was by Jocelyn Trevena of City & Guilds of London Art School. This presents her take on the legend of Saint Agatha, with the agonised saint portrayed on one side and one of her breasts, cut off at her martyrdom, on the other. This medal could easily be placed alongside Italian Renaissance medals on similar themes in the way that it presented the story of an individual. It was no surprise that it should have won the Michael Roberts Memorial Prize.”\n\nJocelyn discussed her work and process: “My medal depicts Saint Agatha, who was martyred via the sexually violent act of having her breasts torn off after refusing the advances of a Roman prefect. I was fascinated by depictions of Agatha that were sexualised, her breasts often taking centre stage, while also idealising her as a virgin. I wanted to pose a question of how we respond to such a distant yet distinct tale of sexual violence, while also trying my best to do justice to Agatha. On one side of my medal, you hold Agatha in your hand, in her torment and unrelenting faith. On the other side, you hold Agatha’s severed breast.\n\nThe project was a very rewarding experience for me, and I learnt a lot about my burgeoning practice. This was my second ever relief model, and my first time working with wax, working in miniature, and my first time working with metal. Learning so much at once made me grow very attached to my medal and it’s subject, I’m so pleased it’s been a success, and hugely thankful for the opportunity.”\n\nThree more of our undergraduate Carving students, Helen Aitchison, Thomas Stainer and Alec Stevens, also had their work accepted for the exhibition. Please read their Catalogue entries below.\n\nHelen Aitchison (First Year BA (Hons) Carving: Architectural Stone), Conquer\n\n‘The medal is a grounding object, something to hold at times of great anxiety to steady your heart. In turn, the medal will hold you; protected by its outer shell, you can conquer your fear and find the courage to carry on. As a psychotherapist, I understand that people use grounding objects, things we picked up and treasured as children. My intention is that this feels familiar in some way.’\n\nThomas Stainer (First Year BA (Hons) Carving: Architectural Stone), Same Old Story\n\n‘This medal’s motif and aesthetic is based on the enduring theme of sibling rivalry, and pays homage to the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh. It shows the figures Enkidu and Gilgamesh, who appear on the front, parallel with the biblical verses from the story of Cain and Abel on the reverse, thus exploring the associations with Christian and Islamic religions.’\n\nAlec Stevens (BA (Hons) Carving: Woodcarving and Gilding), Meddling with History\n\n‘Inspired by dystopian science fiction, such as 1984 and Metropolis, I’ve made a cautionary tale medal that warns of the dangers of Meddling with History when building future societies. As a contemporary sculptor, working within heritage locations, I am always curious as to how and what is represented throughout history. My medal sits within this curiosity of what artefacts survive.’\n\nSee information on all of our students’ entries on pages 25-27 of the Project Catalogue.\n\nSixteen colleges within the UK, joined by two guest academies, produced 106 medals for this year’s project. The exhibition is open at Birmingham School of Jewellery until Friday 26th April.\n\nParis Medieval Study Trip 2024\n\nOn Monday 26 February, 36 first year students from our BA (Hons) Carving and BA (Hons) Conservation courses embarked on the annual Paris Medieval Study Trip. Our Conservation students were accompanied by Jim Bloxam (Head of Book Conservation), Sophie Barton (Conservation Tutor) and Sophie Ambelas (Conservation Technician), and our Carving students were joined by Tom Young (Head of Carving) and Ghislain Puget (Senior Stone Carving Tutor).\n\nThis study trip, generously supported by the Stuart Heath Charitable Settlement, greatly enriches the learning experience of our first year students by contextualizing their studies and enabling them to engage directly with the art and architecture of Paris.\n\nDay 1\n\nAfter checking into accommodation, the trip’s activities started straight away. Our Carving students walked to Île Saint-Louis, stopping at Notre Dame on the way, to look at the baroque churches Église de St Louise and Église de Saint Paul. Later in the afternoon, they visited Places des Voges, one of the oldest squares in Paris, and the nearby Hôtel de Sully. The day ended with a trip to see the contemporary art at Palais Tokyo. Meanwhile, our Conservators spent the afternoon at the Louvre, where our BA (Hons) Conservation: Books & Paper students discussed the restoration of The Wedding Feast at Cana by Paolo Veronese.\n\nPhoto credit: Sophie Barton\n\nPhoto credit: Sophie Barton\n\nDay 2\n\nThe first full day in Paris began with our Carving students visiting the Gothic church Église St-Séverin and the medieval church Église Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre. Afterwards, they walked to the Cluny Museum, where our BA (Hons) Conservation: Stone, Wood and Decorative Surfaces students had spent the morning. Meanwhile, our Books & Paper Conservation students visited the Conservation Studio of the Sorbonne School of Art History and Archeology, kindly hosted by conservator Dr Élodie Lévêque.\n\nIn the afternoon, our Carvers visited the Pantheon and the 17th century Église Saint-Étienne-du-Mont. The group then headed over to the Parc du Luxembourg, where they saw the Carpeaux Sculpture and the Bartholdi maquette for the Statue of Liberty. Afterwards, they visited the nearby Musée Zadkine, dedicated to the 20th Century sculptor Ossip Zadkine, and the Musée Carnavalet, a museum of the history of the city.\n\nOur Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces Conservation students also visited the Musée Carnavalet, in addition to spending time at the Musée Rodin, the Places des Vosges and the Hôtel de Sully. Our Books & Paper Conservation cohort went to the Bibliothèque nationale de France for the afternoon, where they visited the Manuscripts Conservation Studio with Nathalie Trion, Head of Conservation. The rest of the day was spent at the conservation study and library at the Mazarine Library with conservator Alizée Lacourtiade.\n\nPhoto credit: Lottie Ellery, BA (Hons) Carving: Architectural Stone\n\nPhoto credit: Lottie Ellery, BA (Hons) Carving: Architectural Stone\n\nDay 3\n\nOur third day in Paris began with a trip to the Musée d’Orsay for our Carving students, whilst our Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces students visited the conservation studios of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, stopping en route at Notre Dame and Sainte-Chapelle. Our Books & Paper Conservation students headed over to the Palace of Versailles, where they spent the whole day.\n\nIn the afternoon, our Carvers visited Musée Rodin to see the work of 19th Century sculptors including Camille Claudel. This was followed by visits to the Musée Bourdelle and Musée Maillol. Our Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces conservators spent the afternoon at the Musée Guimet, followed by a visit to the exhibition ‘From Builders to Restorers’ at the Cité de l’architecture et du patrimoine on the construction and restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral.\n\nPhoto credit: Sophie Barton\n\nDay 4\n\nThe morning started with a visit to the Cité de l’architecture et du patrimoine for our Carving students, where they saw architectural casts by Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, before heading over to the Musée de la Marine. Our conservators across both courses spent the morning at Institut National du Patrimoine.\n\nOur Carvers then visited Villa La Roche, designed by 20th Century Architect Le Corbusier, before ending the day at the Louvre. The students admired Lead Stone Carving Tutor Ghislain Puget’s sculptural heritage in the Cour Puget! Meanwhile, our Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces Conservation students visited the Conservation studio at the Musée National d’ Archaeologie, and ended the day at the Musée d’Orsay. Our Books & Paper conservators spent the afternoon at the Sorbonne Conservation Studio with Sylvie Struyve.\n\nPhoto Credit: Lottie Ellery, BA (Hons) Carving: Architectural Stone\n\nFriday\n\nFor the final morning in Paris, the students had time for independent exploration. There was an optional visit for all students to École Boulle, a college of fine arts, crafts and applied arts, and our Carving students were also given the opportunity to visit Père Lachaise Cemetery and Josef et Fils toolshop.\n\nThe End of the Spring Term\n\nIn the final two sessions of the Spring Term, our members continued their explorations of glass artwork and printing.\n\nOur 2D members have been enjoying working in our historic print room. Led by Print Tutor Kristina Chan and Print Fellow Benjamin Topping, half of the group worked with Intaglio printmaking, and learned the art of soft ground, hard ground and aquatint. The other half of our group, led by Print Tutor Niamh Clancy and Print Fellow Angela A’Court, were introduced to Screen Printing. Our members created beautiful multi layered prints, with influences ranging from animals to landscapes, to comic books.\n\nOur 3D cohort continued the glass sculptures that they began working on in the Autumn Term. The members completed the casting of their sculptures, before moving on to pouring the works. In the final week of term, they unveiled their finished sculptures! Thank you to our Glass Tutor Anne Petters and Glass Fellows Roberta De Caro and Mils Bridgewater for running these fantastic sessions in the Glass Studio over the last two terms.\n\nWell done to all of our members and thank you for your hard work!\n\nMaster Craft Certificates awarded to two members of the Art School community\n\nNina Bilbey with the Rt. Hon.

We were delighted to return to the city in late November 2023, kindly hosted once again by the Cini Foundation.\n\nThe trip’s activities started straight away on arrival into the city. Once we had checked into our rooms, we were given an introduction to the themes of the week before travelling to St Mark’s Square to visit the Basilica. This was followed by an orientation walk around Venice center towards the Dorsoduro and seeing some of the Baroque churches en route.\n\nThe second day started early, with the whole group taking a train out of the city to Padua. There, we visited the 13th century Church of the Eremitani, which was badly damaged by aerial bombardment during World War II. We discussed the conservation issues and restoration process, and why the church has deliberately not been restored to a pristine state.\n\nWe then split into two groups for the rest of the day. BA (Hons) Carving and BA (Hons) Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces students visited the 16th-century Palazzo Bo, before seeing the Padua Baptistry and San Antonio Basilica. Our BA (Hons) Conservation: Books and Paper students visited the Abbazia di Praglia, a Benedictine monastery founded in 1080 with a center for book restoration. After their visits, students had the opportunity to spend the evening in Padua before catching the train back to Venice.\n\nPalazzo Bo\n\nPalazzo Bo\n\nAbbazia di Praglia\n\nOn Day 3, we were given a tour of the Cini Foundation and library, where we saw works on paper, a Palladian building and carvings. Late morning, we travelled to St Mark’s Square, where we split into the same groups as the day before. Our Books & Paper Conservation students visited Marciana Library, one of the earliest surviving public libraries in Italy. Meanwhile, the rest of the group studied the artefacts in St Marks Square, considering their material properties and meanings from both a carving and conservation perspective, and learned a little about the history of Venice.\n\nCini Foundation\n\nCini Foundation\n\nCini Foundation\n\nMarciana Library\n\nMarciana Library\n\nAfter a break for lunch, the carvers went to the Scuola San Rocca and the Santa Maria dei Carmini Church to see the stunning wood carvings, and our Books and Paper Conservation students visited the San Francesco della Vigna library. All students came together at the end of the day with a trip to the Ca’ Rezzonico museum.\n\nThe fourth and last full day of the trip began again in St Mark’s Square. BA (Hons) Carving and BA (Hons) Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces students visited the Church of San Zaccaria, the Basilica dei Santi Giovanni e Paolo, the Scuola San Marco and Santa Maria dei Miracoli. Books and Paper Conservation students visited the Armenian Monastery of San Lazzaro, home to one of the oldest printing and publishing houses in Venice, and their archive. After lunch, students were then given an afternoon free to explore the city.\n\nSan Lazzaro\n\nSan Lazzaro\n\nOur last morning in Venice was spent at the church of San Nicolo dei Mendicoli, followed by a visit to the Frari – the largest church in the city. Our Books and Paper Conservation students had the special opportunity to visit Mario Berta Battiloro, the last artisan gold beater in Venice.\n\nMario Berta Battiloro\n\nMario Berta Battiloro – Earrings of 24 ct gold over oyster shells\n\nWe then returned to the Cini to collect our bags and say goodbye to our hosts before heading to the airport.\n\nInterested in studying on one of our BA Carving or BA Conservation courses?

Her work is on display at the RBA Annual Exhibition at the Mall Galleries until 9 March 2024.\n\nThis is the second year in a row that Natalia has received an award from the RBA, having won The Michael Harding Prize for her painting ‘In the Artist’s Studio’ last year.\n\nNatalia Glinoer, iPad, Oil on Linen, 24 x 18cm\n\nNatalia is an artist based in Brighton. She studied at City and Guilds of London Art School, 2014-2016 and at the Heatherley school of Fine Art, 2018-2021. In 2017, Natalia won the RBA Rome Scholarship where she travelled to Rome for one month, studying the High Renaissance, Baroque paintings and sculptures that helped inspire her current work. Natalia also won the 2023 Royal Society of British Artist’s Michael Harding Award and The Surgeon’s Prize in 2024. She is predominantly an oil painter and a printmaker. She has and continues to work on private commissions and models for life drawing.\n\nNatalia has also exhibited across the UK, notably at the Green and Stone Gallery, The Royal Society of British Artists, The New English Art Club, ING Discerning Eye, The Society of Women Artists at the Mall Galleries and The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition.\n\nArtist Talk: Kelvin Okafor\n\nLast Friday we were delighted to be visited by Kelvin Okafor, 2005 alumnus of our Foundation Diploma in Art & Design (pictured above with Acting Course Leader, Joshua Uvieghara).\n\nKelvin is an internationally renowned and award-winning drawing practitioner and pencil artist, with a community of over 385k followers on Instagram and regular solo exhibitions in the UK.\n\nIn his talk, Kelvin shared his career journey, in which he reflected on his year at City & Guilds of London Art School, and how important it had been to him. He discussed his drawing process and his current body of work, ‘Drawing Awareness’.\n\nThe purpose of his latest project is to engage and educate the audience by learning through art about people with visible differences. Its narrative is based on acceptance and inclusion whilst promoting positive change in people’s attitudes towards people with skin differences. The theme of acceptance and inclusion is visually captured and documented throughout. Each drawing conveys a story; a non-fiction of truth told by the sitter to steer change. Each sitter has openly shared their personal story of their difference or skin condition and journey so far.\n\nKelvin most generously donated a limited edition print of his drawing of Bob Dylan and his catalogue from the Albemarle Gallery to the Art School. We are most grateful to Kelvin for the gift and for taking the time to visit us and speak with our students.\n\nStudent Blog – What to expect in your first term studying on the Foundation Diploma in Art & Design\n\nHello there! This is Zahra Nawal, an international student hailing from Pakistan who packed her entire life in a suitcase to experience the journey of an art school in one of the most amazing cities in the world, London.\n\nWhat has this art school been for me in these past three months? Everything.\n\nIt was a seamless decision for me to make City & Guilds of London Art School my first choice for a Foundation year. This was primarily because of the reviews by the previous students who I interacted with, but equally importantly because of the facilities and faculties this place offers. From open spaces for students, to a wide range of workshops and an array of exceptional tutors, City & Guilds of London Art School has everything an art enthusiast like me desires.\n\nFrom the outset of my classes, the entire Foundation Diploma in Art & Design course seems to be strategically designed on how to encourage students to venture into unexplored territories. It began with manipulating an open space, laid back sessions of life drawing and delving in the intricacies of geometry. Throughout the first week, we were shuffled into different groups with different people and introduced to most tutors through these one-day classes. As the term progressed, the classes continued with a fresh mix of student groups. This propelled me to get out of my comfort zone and become familiar with as many new students as possible. Engaging in insightful discussions, and offering and receiving critiques, has been a humbling yet rewarding experience to delve deeper into the realm of art alongside making great connections with people.\n\nThe first term provided me with a structured pathway that I could rely on with clear instructions given to me in the form of a brief. These briefs are really the pivotal elements if used appropriately, as they are the core of your projects. Despite the provided guidelines, you are given the opportunity to explore. This is a versatile part of the course that primarily makes you learn how to research and develop ideas. Each project is about a week long, and you get a well-informed overview in terms of Fine Art and Design and, to some extent, Architecture, which can help you evaluate your choices for future career. This term is also a vital time to seek insight about different workshops and get a sense of different materials.\n\nEach week was a whirlwind of activity with projects that kept me totally engaged. Fridays, however, brought a welcome change of pace as they were dedicated to Art History. Divided into two separate groups, each week we concluded our work with a tour to different art galleries to explore different Art History themes and write about it in our essays. Through these visits, we had the opportunity to test into various themes and concepts alongside fellow students, engaging in discussions that encompassed diverse viewpoints during these tours.\n\nFinally, the term concluded with the transposition project that students work on for two days. Furthermore, we have to make sure to upload everything onto the school’s electronic portfolio software. Regular evaluation and feedback helps students to maintain their work and prevent tasks from accumulating towards the end. Additionally, we each get assigned a pastoral tutor, to help us explore various courses and start our research for applications for our next step.\n\nCarving alumni featured in House & Garden magazine\n\nWe were thrilled to see three of our Carving alumni featured in the latest edition of House & Garden magazine.\n\nCheck out the March edition to read Christabel Chubb’s profile on London Stone Carving, founded in 2018 by Stone Carving alumni Tom Brown and Tom Nicholls, along with Josh Locksmith and Sam Lee. In the article, they discuss their careers since graduating from the Art School, their processes and commitment to the use of traditional stonemasonry techniques, and the variety of commissions and projects they have taken on.\n\nWoodcarving & Gilding alumna Silje Loa’s limewood and limestone sculpture ‘Draped in Wood’ is featured in the ‘Decorate’ section of the magazine, where Ruth Sleightholme looks at interiors featuring trompe-l’oeil.\n\nImages 2-4 below from Silje Loa via Instagram.\n\nArt School launches new BA (Hons) Illustration\n\nCity & Guilds of London Art School is delighted to be launching a new undergraduate course in Illustration.\n\nThe Art School has a deep association with illustrative practice dating back to its origins in the 19th century. Artisans at nearby Royal Doulton came to train at the Art School, including two of Doulton’s celebrated designers Hannah and Florence Barlow, whose work can be seen in the V&A Museum. Arthur Rackham, one of the leading figures of the ‘Golden Age of Illustration’, siblings Clemence and Laurence Housman, founders of the Atelier that produced much of the campaigning artwork of the Suffrage Movement, and much-loved children’s author and illustrator Lauren Child, number amongst the prominent illustrators who have passed through the Art School.\n\nAbout the course\n\nThis BA (Hons) Illustration course will challenge students to develop their own visual language in a collaborative and dynamic Art School that is renowned for mark-making practice. Using traditional drawing skills and historic lettering as a foundation for contemporary practice, students will learn to approach illustration as a diverse tool of communication and build their skills by experimenting with new technologies. Throughout the development of practical work, our learners will benefit first hand from the Art School’s clients, designers and curators across the sector and be supported in their professional and contextual understanding of illustration as it relates to industry.\n\nUnderstanding illustration as a catalyst for accessible communication is a fundamental part of the course ethos and will be tested directly through practice. Taking ‘traditional’ discipline as its starting point, material processes and live projects will be utilised to develop new approaches to illustrative literacy, drawing on the specialist learning and facilities that the Art School is well renowned for. In this way, the course will support the development of a basis of skills and knowledge, informing experimentation, invention and the questioning of orthodoxy.\n\nOver the duration of the course, students will experience a unique creative learning environment and will be supported by their tutors in becoming a pro-active participant in their own learning in preparation for the challenges of further study and/or a range of professional futures. Some elements of the course have a specific focus based on choice of illustration, while group tutorials, workshop time, live projects and other sessions, such as professional practice, are shared more widely across the Art School.\n\nOur focus on material creation is informed by in-depth engagement with the critical contexts of art, design and illustration. Due to our central location, the students will have London’s rich cultural heritage at their feet to educate and inspire them.\n\nFind out more\n\nSee full information about our BA (Hons) Illustration on the course page of our website.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact our Admissions Team.\n\nCredit: Artwork in header by MA Fine Art alumna Annie Farrer\n\nConservation students use X-Ray analysis in their final year projects\n\nA mobile X-Ray service recently came to the Art School to support our Third Year BA (Hons) Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces students in the analysis of their objects as part of their final year projects.\n\nRead more about Ally, Yingzhen and Julieta’s experience below.\n\n“My third-year wood project is a Baroque style table that has a large, carved and gilded putto as a central column. The body of the putto shows extensive structural damage with several cracks visible on the left side and back of the drapery. The table appeared to be structurally stable and a metal detector confirmed that metal hardware was used in previous repairs, however, the condition and age of these repairs was unknown and needed to be checked as the table must be functional when it leaves the studio. The repairs were not designed to be dismantled, so it would have been too intrusive to do so unless absolutely necessary. In this case, x-ray analysis was the perfect technique to assess the condition of these repairs to inform the treatment proposal.\n\nX-ray images showed that the metal hardware was still intact and providing the necessary support. They also revealed that four different types of nails and screws were used, with the earliest type, a large hand wrought nail, not widely used since the 19th century, alluding to several repairs to the same area over time. X–ray images also revealed more detail about the original and later joinery, fills, and the unusual construction of the base which was built to house the putto, confirming the theory that he was repurposed into this table from a different original location.”\n\nAlly Wingate Saul, Third Year BA (Hons) Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces\n\n“In my third year, I embarked on a wood project, a table casket in the Renaissance style. This casket is constructed from wood, embellished with carved alabaster. It boasts a rectangular design, with architectural motifs and structurally stable. Upon opening, it reveals an array of five secret compartments, accessible through vertically sliding panels on both sides.\n\nFor a comprehensive assessment of the casket’s condition and to inform the methodology for its hinge conservation phase, I utilized the Amadeo M-DR X-ray imaging system. The resultant imagery detailed the heterogeneous assemblage of nails affixing the hinges to the casket body. This assortment ranged from slender to robust, spiral-textured nails, with one particular nail exhibiting deformation likely attributed to external stress. This irregularity might compromise the hinge’s stability. Furthermore, the variance in nail morphology intimates a blend of original and subsequent additions, ostensibly for enhancing the structural robustness of the hinge attachment.\n\nThe radiographic evidence necessitated a re-evaluation of the initial strategy to rectify the bent hinge. The removal of the deeply embedded nails posed a risk of inflicting further damage, potentially jeopardising the secure union of the casket lid and body.”\n\nYingzhen Liu, Third Year BA (Hons) Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces\n\n“A plaster cast of the Medici Venus is one of my third-year projects in the BA (Hons) Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces course. The main concern was the structural stability; cracks on the knees and ankles suggested the sculpture might be at risk of collapse. Given that these objects are regularly used by students at the school, ensuring their mobility without causing further damage is of a great importance.\n\nAs part of the analysis to assess its condition and inform the treatment proposal, a mobile X-Ray service came to school to capture images of the sculpture. The images revealed that the armature inside the legs is not broken; it initiates at the base and extends to the knees, measuring 30 mm. The angles of inclination could be discerned using the software. Additionally, the dolphin features an armature made from a 2 mm wire, which is weaker than the main body, explaining the semi-detached fin and the missing end tail.”\n\nJulieta Herrera, Third Year BA (Hons) Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces\n\nInterested in studying on one of our BA (Hons) Conservation or MA Conservation courses?\n\nFind out more by visiting us at one of our upcoming Open Days.

After four weeks of learning woodcarving from BA (Hons) Carving: Woodcarving and Gilding alumnus Tom Buchanan and Graduate Diploma Arts: Carving: Woodcarving & Gilding student Henry Brown, our members have created intricate frames with unique designs. Well done to our 3D cohort!\n\nOur 2D members continued working in the Print Room. Led by Print Tutor Kristina Chan and Print Fellow Benjamin Topping, half of the group learned the art of hard-ground etching, part of which involved working with fire. Influences ranged from landscapes, butterflies to plague doctors.\n\nThe other half of our group was led by Screen Print Tutor Niamh Clancy and Print Fellow Angela A’Court. Members worked quickly creating multiple screens, multi-layered screen prints and printing onto fabric, all in one workshop.\n\nSkill Share Workshop: Julie Hayashi\n\nWe were delighted to be joined recently by Artist Julie Hayashi, who ran a demonstration on Nihonga (traditional Japanese Painting) at one of our student Skill Share events.\n\nWith a PhD in Japanese Painting (Conservation) from Tokyo University of the Arts, Julie gave a generous presentation on her work in the conservation and the mounting of paintings, the research of painting techniques, the reproduction of cultural property and Nihonga painting. Julie discussed the transformation and styles of Japanese painting, from 8th century to contemporary, and how contemporary Japanese painters use traditional methods and materials of Nihonga. She shared insight on the materials used, such as pigments, paper, ink and dye, and where they can be found. Following the presentation, Julie gave a demonstration on the techniques discussed, which the attendees were given the opportunity to try out.\n\nStudents from across all our courses and disciplines were invited to the workshop, and the room was packed out.\n\nOur warmest thanks to Julie for her time and for visiting us.\n\nAn Introduction to the Print Room\n\nLast Saturday marked our 2D members’ first experience in our historic Print Room. Divided into two groups, one half of our members were guided by Print Tutor Kristina Chan and Print Fellow Benjamin Topping, and delved into the world of intaglio print. The other half were led by Screen Print Tutor Niamh Clancy and Print Fellow Angela A’Court, who introduced our students to Screen Printing. The members created beautiful works influenced by a range of themes, from nature to domestic interiors.\n\nOur 3D cohort continued to work on their carved frames. The members’ designs are now down, and they are well and truly immersed in the woodcarving. Our young creatives have swiftly embraced this craft, and the resulting works are looking magical.\n\nMarbling and Carving continues\n\nLast weekend, our National Saturday Club members continued their work in paper marbling and woodcarving. Our 2D group were led by Decorative Surfaces Fellow Elosie Dethier-Eaton and BA (Hons) Conservation: Books & Paper student Mariia Ivanelo and continued exploring paper marbling techniques. The club member produced stunning examples of Spanish Wave Marbling, Bouquet and Nonpareil.\n\nThe 3D group were led by BA (Hons) Carving: Woodcarving and Gilding Alumnus Tom Buchanan and Graduate Diploma Arts: Carving: Woodcarving and Gilding student Henry Brown. The members began to carve the patterns and forms they designed last week, starting with a test carving before carving their frames. The pieces are beginning to emerge and the results are already looking incredible.\n\nAn Introduction to Global Conservation: Commonwealth Summer School\n\nThis summer, the Commonwealth Heritage Forum and City & Guilds of London Art School are delighted to be offering ‘Introduction to Global Conservation’, a Commonwealth Summer School.\n\nThis Summer School will run for two weeks from 22 July – 2 August 2024.\n\nLevel: Beginner to Intermediate.\n\nBe inspired by this rare opportunity to learn historic conservation skills in one of the few art schools in Britain still teaching traditional craftsmanship. In the first week, you will learn a range of stonework and masonry skills offered at the City & Guilds of London Art School.\n\nIn the second week, you will learn the specific skills that are relevant to the preparation and use of lime mortar, lime render, lime plaster, lime wash and limecrete.

After three years of hard work, we graduated from the City and Guilds of London Art School, with a BA (Hons) Conservation: Stone, Wood, and Decorative Surfaces. Following this, we were selected to carry out a 10-week stone conservation internship in Venice, held in collaboration with Abbazia di San Giorgio Maggiore – Benedicti Claustra Onlus and funded by the Venice in Peril Fund.\n\nThe beautiful Palladian Basilica is located on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, across the lagoon from mainland Venice and our accommodation was situated in the Benedictine monastery next to the church.\n\nThe area we were assigned to work on was The Altar of Saint Lucy situated on the North Wall of the Basilica. Following assessment of this space we implemented a programme of cleaning to remove and reduce heavy layers of dirt, dust and surface deposits that had accumulated over many years. Before attending the internship, we took part in the PASMA training course, organised by City and Guilds of London Art School, to equip us with the knowledge that would help us erect and deconstruct a mobile scaffold tower to enable us to reach the high areas. At the end of our internship, the difference that our conservation had made to the area was clear to see, confirming that this collaboration between City and Guilds of London Art School and Abbazia di San Giorgio Maggiore is very worthwhile.\n\nJosh’s experience:\n\nFrom the moment I received this award I knew it would be the most significant challenge in my career to date. I was very excited to learn about the monastery and the lifestyle in San Giorgio Maggiore Abbey as it seemed such a contrast to my life in London. It was nerve-wracking to think I would be there for 10 weeks with no understanding of the Italian language as well as the adjustment of both working and living with my friend Carla and managing each other’s stress and anxieties of being away from home.\n\nThat being said, the experience was wonderful. Everyone we met working at the church was very friendly and super helpful – I truly felt a part of the place within the first month. The lunches with the monks and the staff were a lovely part of the working day, not only for the tremendous food cooked by chef Fiorello but a great place for learning Italian phrases and feeling like part of the family. The work went smoothly thanks to my lovely colleague Carla and support from Carmelo. It was an honour to be a small part in the history of this incredible Palladian church.\n\nOutside of the monastery I enjoyed two weekends with my family and also proposed to my partner on San Giorgio! The pace of life and the fortunate weather we experienced gave us some of the most relaxing days in such a beautiful setting. It will always have a place in my heart. A big thank you to City & Guilds of London Art School for awarding this to me, it has been life changing. Another thank you to Venice in Peril for your support and finally a thank you to everyone on the Island of San Giorgio for making it the most unforgettable experience.\n\nCarla’s experience:\n\nIf someone had told me that in 2023, I would be spending 10 weeks living in a Benedictine monastery in Venice, carrying out stone conservation on a Palladian Basilica, I would never have believed them. Now in my early fifties, with a husband and two adult children, I felt it was time to try something different. So, I sent in my application form without thinking too deeply about the fact I would be away from home for so long adopting a mostly solitary lifestyle.\n\nAfter the initial jubilation when I found out I had been accepted, the enormity of the situation began to dawn on me. Would I crumble after the first week away? Would I gel with the people working in the Abbey? Would my good friendship with Josh remain intact? Well, I’m happy to say that all my fears were unfounded. To say that the 10 weeks spent in Venice were life changing would be an understatement. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel like part of the San Giorgio Maggiore family. From Carmelo our supervisor, to the lovely Paola who took care of our washing, every person that worked at The Abbey was very special. Despite the language barrier we all managed to communicate, and the communal lunches were a highlight of the day. It would not be unknown for the whiskey and limoncello to make an appearance!\n\nI was lucky enough to have visits from friends and family that helped stave off the feelings of homesickness that popped up every so often. The Venice in Peril Fund organized some amazing trips for us whilst we were there, including visits to The Misericordia Conservation Labs and a performance at the church of San Nicolo dei Mendicoli.\n\nBeing able to carry out conservation work on such a historic building whilst being in such beautiful surroundings is a memory that will stay with me forever. I’m just glad that I was able to share it with my good friend Josh. Thanks must go to City and Guilds of London Art School and the Abbazia di San Giorgio Maggiore -Benedicti Claustra Onlus for facilitating this amazing experience and of course The Venice in Peril Fund for providing the funding to enable me to take part, and the great support we received from their representative in Venice, Susan Steer.\n\nWords and Images by Carla Learoyd and Josh Horsfall.\n\nThe altar of Santa Lucia following conservation\n\nStarting the new year with woodcarving and paper marbling\n\nOur National Saturday Club members enjoyed their first session of 2024 last week. Our 2D cohort were joined by Decorative Surfaces Fellow Eloise Dethier-Eaton, assisted by Third Year BA (Hons) Conservation: Books & Paper student Mariia Ivanelo, to explore the world of paper marbling. The members used carrageenan, alum-coated paper and acrylic paint to create swirling patterns, with magical results. Next week we will use these techniques to accomplish even more complex and traditional patterns.\n\nOur 3D cohort were led by BA (Hons) Carving: Woodcarving and Gilding Alumnus Tom Buchanan and Graduate Diploma Arts: Carving: Woodcarving & Gilding student Henry Brown to learn the art of woodcarving. Each member will undertake a project to carve an intricate frame of their own design, using inspiration ranging from historical carving techniques, to nature, to video games and book covers. They began by drawing their designs on paper to map out their plans, before moving onto transferring them to wood. We are excited to see what they do next!\n\nLaunching the Conservation Umbrella Fund\n\nA new Umbrella Fund for the Conservation Department at City & Guilds of London Art School has recently been established, with the aim to raise financial support for our specialist provision. These funds will contribute to sustaining the widely recognised excellence of our Conservation Department, and allow us to build further on its national and international reach.\n\nAt a time when many of the UK’s conservation courses have now closed or are threatened with closure, we are one of the few institutions still offering conservation courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level. This is made possible due to our small scale and independence. However, as an independent, specialist and not-for-profit organisation, we are ineligible for public subsidy. This means that our teaching is delivered without public sector support or any other form of core funding, and is reliant on tuition fee income and private donations.\n\nThe curriculum learning on our BA (Hons) Conservation and MA Conservation courses is densely packed, with intensive one to one tuition, as well as significant use of materials and specialist equipment. Therefore, it is not feasible to teach more than 50 students (8 on each pathway, per year of study) at any one time. This makes the per student cost relatively high at any time, but particularly now given the current significant increase in energy and material costs.\n\nIn order to support our Conservation Department in continuing its vitally important work, we have set up this new fund to actively seek support from the industry, professionals and all those who are interested in the teaching of Conservation.\n\nPlease see full information on how you can support the Conservation Umbrella Fund here.\n\nWith thanks to those who have already become supporters of the Conservation Umbrella Fund:\n\nShepherds Bookbinders Ltd\n\nMuseum Conservation Services Ltd\n\nDr Timothy Schroder\n\nIf you would like to discuss any other forms of support, please contact Natasha Hastings, Development & External Relations Manager: n.hastings@cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk\n\nStudent Blog – What to expect in your first term studying BA (Hons) Carving\n\nThe first term of BA (Hons) Carving: Architectural Stone is all about introducing new students to a range of skills that you will build on in the next term and years to come. The curriculum includes drawing, clay modelling, art history and stone carving which are staggered and mixed over the timetabled weeks so we are always doing something new. For example, one week will consist of clay modelling with one tutor for the first two days then switch to two days of letter carving with another tutor and the week after might change to two days of modelling and the two days of drawing. We always have two art history lectures on Friday, the final in the form of a walking tour somewhere in London to discuss a specific type of architecture and ending at a pub for a well-deserved drink.\n\nTeaching is between 9:30-4:30 every day so the perfect time for me is to arrive at 9am, which allows me to set up and enjoy a coffee before jumping into the day. As we can’t take our work home with us, it is usually better to stay a little longer than the teaching hours. On Tuesdays, I will stay for life drawing which finishes at 8pm. These days are excellent for improving drawing, as we get the benefit of even more one-on-one teaching from the Tutors. The biggest challenge can be the workload. We are so lucky to have constant access to teachers and resources, but this means the days can be long and require sustained attention. I would say you should expect your quality of sleep to improve instantly because you’ll be wiped out each day for the first few weeks. Fear not, your tolerance builds up quickly, but it can sometimes be a shock if you’re unprepared.\n\nOutside of teaching, there are plenty of opportunities to expand your experience at the school. As the Art School is in London, we get the benefit of extracurricular activities all the time. Exhibitions, lectures and museum visits are always happening, so it helps to ask the tutors if they have any recommendations.\n\nAs for your experience with other students at the school, you can expect to meet a close group of fascinating people. Many of them have already had time and experience in a separate field before attending the school, so you should bring helpful insights and the maturity to try hard and be accepting of new challenges. My year is a particularly big cohort, and has people from various life experiences and skillsets. There are stonemasons, art students, history students, and people from established careers in psychology and the civil service. No one student has the same experience, and will often have strengths in one particular area. This means that each person has the chance to feel confident whilst also feeling challenged and motivated to progress in areas that are out of their comfort zone. We swap ideas and help each other to improve our carving and academic skills. I had almost no experience carving before the course, so the stonemasons will give me tips and encouragement on basic skills to help me in the carving lessons and I try to give back in our art history lectures and portfolio note-taking.\n\nThe carving studio is open plan, so we mingle with different year groups of woodcarving and stone carving throughout the day. This is particularly good for first years, as we can see both the second and third-year stone carvers working on their projects. These are typically longer and more intricate than anything we produce as first year students. We are lucky as they are often keen to discuss their work, answer any questions and give encouraging stories about their experience as first years. It’s a great opportunity to keep yourself motivated to improve and excited to reach the next year of the course. First-year woodcarvers and stone carvers attend classes in drawing and clay modelling together and the conservationists join us for our art history lectures on Fridays. The carvers are tasked with organising the Christmas party at the end of term which includes deciding on a theme, making decorations and organising music. My favourite social event happens every other Thursday where all the carvers from each year group are invited to a communal lunch, the Head of Department bakes a mountain of different types of bread, and we bring food for everyone to share.\n\nWords and Photography by Charlotte Ellery, First Year BA (Hons) Carving: Architectural Stone\n\nStudent Blog – What to expect in your first term studying BA (Hons) Conservation\n\nMy course, BA (Hons) Conservation: Stone, Wood & Decorative Surfaces, started on the 25th of September 2023. Usually, the first week of a new term is considered easier than the rest, as a week to get to know the school and the other students, and try to maintain conversations without giving anyone an awkward impression of oneself. The thought of a first week in an entirely new environment fuelled my anxiety. But luckily, City & Guilds of London Art School does not have a chilled first week!\n\nAfter having just arrived, we were introduced to Stone Lettering by Tom Young, Head of Carving. My natural reaction was of brief relief mixed with excitement, and then followed by a new rush of anxiety. I had never held a chisel in my hand, or even spelt the word (I’m Austrian), and I had never carved a letter into stone before.\n\nThroughout this course, and thanks to the kind and very patient support of Tom, my lettering improved daily, even experiencing small moments of proudness! It did not give me time for social anxiety, but rather reassured my curiosity in craftswomanship and the course ahead, and allowed us new students to bond through our shared emotional ups and downs of learning Lettering.\n\nOur first-year class of Stone, Wood and Decorative Surfaces Conservation contains nine people, all of different ages and backgrounds. In an interesting way, this mixture of characters allows oneself to be an individual in a group. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, but, rather than competing, our approach has been to ask each other for help or share ways to improve our work together. Although different in certain aspects, what we have in common as students is an interest in conservation and the willingness to learn and to become better in a nourishing environment.\n\nAnd this was only the first few days! In the last few weeks, I have undertaken courses in plaster casting and moulding, technical drawing, joinery, history of decorative styles and architecture, observational drawing and conservation science, as well as an introduction to conservation.\n\nWhat I have enjoyed so far about my first year at City & Guilds of London Art School is that we are taught to approach Conservation in a very sensible way. Because you are interested in conserving or restoring an object, it is important for you to be aware of how something is made and how to handle different objects in regard of their material, heritage, etc. As a student with little knowledge about conservation, it has been very helpful to get to know wood and stone as working materials in the first place, and then later as materials to conserve. Understanding them as their own entity, and getting familiar with their possibilities and also their boundaries, will come in handy as soon as you are confronted with an actual finished object, which is placed in your capable hands to conserve.\n\nIn conclusion, the course has tak"
