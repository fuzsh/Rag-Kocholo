Since Windebank's flight to France at the beginning of December 1640 he had been without a colleague in the Secretaryship. He is usually spoken of by Nicholas as “ Mr. Threasurer.”\n\npage 1 note b\n\npage 1 note b The letters throughout are addressed to Nicholas unless it is otherwise stated.\n\npage 2 note a\n\npage 2 note a The original warrant, with instructions, signed by Charles, is in Eg. MS. 2541, f. 264. It is printed in Hoare's Wilts, Alderbury Hundred, p. 89.\n\npage 2 note b\n\npage 2 note b The imposition of this oath against the covenant, &c. was made the ground of art. 19 of Strafford's impeachment (Rushworth, viii. p. 489), according to which Hen. Steward and his wife were fined £5,000 each and his two daughters £3,000 each, with imprisonment for default. In the letter, however, to which Nicholas refers (Eg. MS. 2533, f. 113b) the amounts are stated to have been £3,000 and £2,000 respectively. Compensation was ultimately made out of delinquents' estates. (Commons'-Journals, iv. p. 630.)\n\npage 2 note c\n\npage 2 note c Henry Bourchier, succ. as 5th Earl in 1636.\n\npage 2 note d\n\npage 2 note d Sir Francis Leigh, 1st Bart., cr. Baron Dunsmore in 1628, and Earl of Chichester in 1644.\n\npage 3 note a\n\npage 3 note a Francis Seymour, 2nd son of the Earl of Hertford, cr. Baron Seymour of Trowbridge, 19 Feb. 1641.\n\npage 3 note b\n\npage 3 note b Edward Lyttelton, cr. Baron Lyttelton of Mounslow, 18 Feb. 1641 ; made Lord Keeper on the impeachment and flight of Lord Finch, 18 Jan. 1641, having previously been Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.\n\npage 3 note c\n\npage 3 note c Henry Montagu, cr. Earl of Manchester in 1626 ; Lord Privy Seal since 1627.\n\npage 3 note d\n\npage 3 note d James Stuart, 4th Duke of Lenox, cr. Duke of Richmond two days before, 8 Aug. 1641.\n\npage 3 note e\n\npage 3 note e Oliver St. John, appointed 29 Jan. 1641.\n\npage 3 note f\n\npage 3 note f Sir William Bellenden, of Broughton, cr. Baron Bellenden in 1661.\n\npage 3 note g\n\npage 3 note g William Fiennes, Viscount Saye and Sele.\n\npage 4 note a\n\npage 4 note a M.P. for Boroughbridge, co. York.\n\npage 4 note b\n\npage 4 note b Sir William Armine, or Armyn, of Osgodby, cr. Bart, in 1619, M.P. for Grantham, co. Linc.\n\npage 4 note c\n\npage 4 note c Sir John Clotworthy, M.P. for Maldon, co. Essex.\n\npage 4 note d\n\npage 4 note d It is evident from this that Nicholas had no seat in the Long Parliament. Both Carlyle (Cromwell, ed. 1871, iii. p. 256) and Prof. Masson (Life of Milton, ii. p. 159) enter his name as Member for Newtown, co. Hants, confounding him apparently with Nicholas Weston (see the Blue Book, Members of Parliament, 1878, p. 493, note 8). The “ Mr. Nicholas ” whose name occurs in the Journals is Anthony Nichols, M.P. for Bodmin, or Robert Nichols, M.P. for Devizes.\n\npage 4 note e\n\npage 4 note e This and most of the other draft letters of Nicholas are partly in shorthand.\n\npage 5 note a\n\npage 5 note a Mary de' Medici, mother of Queen Henrietta Maria. She had lived in England since Oct. 1638, but being now “ moved to depart the kingdom,” retired to Cologne, where she died 3 July, 1642.\n\npage 5 note b\n\npage 5 note b Of Bromham, co. Wilts, M.P. for Chippenham. He did not die until 1657.\n\npage 5 note c\n\npage 5 note c Richard Rogers, of Brianston, co. Dorset (Hutchins, Dorset, i. p. 250), and M.P. for the same county. His wife was Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Cheke, Knt., by his second wife, Essex, dau. of Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick. She afterwards married her cousin Robert, 3rd Earl of Warwick (Morant, Essex, i. p. 61).\n\npage 6 note a\n\npage 6 note a The king's answer to this letter, with further correspondence between him and Nicholas, will be found in Bray's Diary and Correspondence of John Evelyn, ed. 1850–52, iv. p. 49.\n\npage 8 note a\n\npage 8 note a Alexander Leslie, commanding the Scotch army in England ; cr. Earl of Leven in October following.\n\npage 9 note a\n\npage 9 note a Since Bishop Juxon's resignation on 19 May the Treasury had been in commission, the Commissioners being Lord Keeper Lyttelton, the Earl of Manchester, Chief Justice Bankes, Lord Newburgh, and Sir H. Vane.\n\npage 10 note a\n\npage 10 note a Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, 1603 ; Earl Marshal since 1621.\n\npage 10 note b\n\npage 10 note b Aubrey de Vere, 20th and last Earl of Oxford, succ. in 1632 ; at this time a youth 15 years of age.\n\npage 11 note a\n\npage 11 note a M.P. for Bury St. Edmund's, and late Comptroller of the Household; father of Henry Jermyn, who, as Lord Jermyn, figures so frequently in the correspondence further on.\n\npage 11 note b\n\npage 11 note b Sir John Bankes, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, acting Speaker of the House of Lords in the absence of Lord Keeper Lyttelton.\n\npage 11 note c\n\npage 11 note c Secretary to the Duke of Richmond; the same probably as the Thomas Webb, M.P. for West Romney, who was expelled from the House as a monopolist in March, 1641.\n\npage 12 note a\n\npage 12 note a The Duke of Richmond, who was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.\n\npage 12 note b\n\npage 12 note b Richmond and Lenox. He and the rest signed the covenant and took their seats on the 18th and 19th. (Balfour, Annals, iii. p. 44.)\n\npage 12 note c\n\npage 12 note c James Hamilton, 3rd Marquis of Hamilton, succ. in 1625 ; cr. Duke of Hamilton in 1643.\n\npage 12 note d\n\npage 12 note d William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton, succ. in 1606.\n\npage 12 note e\n\npage 12 note e Robert Ker of Cessford, cr. Earl of Roxburgh in 1616.\n\npage 13 note a\n\npage 13 note a The committee of Parliament so called appears to have been first formally instituted in 1369 for the purpose of preparing bills to be laid before the House. As, however, the bills were put to the vote in the mass, it gradually usurped the whole power of Parliament. Its constitution varied at different times, but in 1633 it was ordered to consist of eight members of each of the four estates, together with eight officers of state nominated by the king. It was not finally suppressed until 1689. See Acts of Parl. of Scotland, i. p. 16, v. p. 9, &c.\n\npage 14 note a\n\npage 14 note a Passed by Commission, 16 Aug. (Lords' Journals, iv. p. 365.)\n\npage 15 note a\n\npage 15 note a This letter to Pym is referred to in the Com. Journ. 16 Aug. (ii. p. 259), when it was ordered that one Savage, arrested on suspicion of being a priest, should be released as belonging to the retinue of the Queen Mother, but that a young man taken in his company should be examined by the Committee for Recusants.\n\npage 15 note b\n\npage 15 note b Capt. James Wadsworth, notorious for his activity in tracking out recusants. He had himself been a Roman Catholic, and was described by Sanderson (Reign of James I., 1656, p. 491) as “ a renegado proselyte turncote of any religion and every trade, now living, 1655, a common hackney to the basest catchpole bayliffs.” See also Wood's Athenœ Oxon., iii. p. 1077.\n\npage 15 note c\n\npage 15 note c Edward Howard, a younger son of Thomas, 1st Earl of Suffolk, cr. Baron Howard of Escrick in 1628. Like the rest of the Commissioners he was opposed to the Court party.\n\npage 16 note a\n\npage 16 note a Henry Rich, cr. Baron Kensington in 1622, and Earl of Holland in 1624 ; general of the English army in the North. Clarendon attributes his enigmatical letter to pique at the king's refusing him “ the making a baron, which at that time might have been worth to him ten thousand pounds.” (History, ed. 1843, p. 115.) The letter found its way into print, for which Thomas (or Matthew) Symonds, the publisher, got into trouble with the House (C. J., 20, 24 Aug. ii., pp. 266,268). The extract quoted by Nicholas differs somewhat from the printed text.\n\npage 16 note b\n\npage 16 note b Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl in 1603, Lord Chamberlain of the Household.\n\npage 17 note a\n\npage 17 note a Philip Burlamachi, Master of the Posts.\n\npage 17 note b\n\npage 17 note b Nathaniel Fiennes, M.P. for Banbury, 2nd son of Viscount Saye and Sele. Though his name and Sir W. Armyn's were only added “ in case of mortality or sickness” (C. J., 18 Aug., ii. p. 262), all four commoners actually served on the commission. (Balfour, Annals, iii. p. 92.)\n\npage 19 note a\n\npage 19 note a Addressed to the Scotch Parliament, 17 Aug. (Balfour, Annals, iii. p. 40.) See also Rushworth, iv. p. 382.\n\npage 20 note a\n\npage 20 note a John Elphinston, 2nd Baron Balmerino, a strong Covenanter; elected President unanimously on 18 Aug. (Balfour, iii. p. 45.)\n\npage 20 note b\n\npage 20 note b James Livingston, cr. Baron Livingston of Almond in 1633, and Earl of Callendar, 6 Oct. 1641.\n\npage 21 note a\n\npage 21 note a Printed in the Lords' Journals, 20 Aug., iv. p. 372.\n\npage 22 note a\n\npage 22 note a Mountjoy Blount, Earl of Newport, cr. in 1628. See the order in the Lords' Journals, 18 Aug., iv. p. 369.\n\npage 22 note b\n\npage 22 note b Since 11 June he had been confined in the Castle of Edinburgh on a charge of plotting against Argyll and the Covenant. He was not released until Jan. 1642.\n\npage 23 note a\n\npage 23 note a In Northumberland, 13 miles south of Berwick.\n\npage 23 note b\n\npage 23 note b John Campbell, Earl of Loudoun, cr. in 1633. Having been sent as Scotch Commissioner to London in 1640, he was committed to the Tower as privy to the intercepted letter from some of the leading Covenanters to the King of France. He was now on his way home with the Treaty of Pacification.\n\npage 23 note c\n\npage 23 note c William Russell, 5th Earl, succ. 9 May, 1641. Though named one of the Commission to Scotland, he was excused “ in regard of his great occasions.” (L. J., 13, 19 Aug., iv. pp. 362, 371.)\n\npage 23 note d\n\npage 23 note d According to Baillie (Letters, etc., i. pp. 213,255), he preached to some purpose when the Scots invaded England in 1638 and 1640. “ We were much oblidged to the toun of Edinburgh for moneyes. Harie Rollock by his sermons moved them to shake out their purses.” And again, “ Rollock had so sweetlie spoken to the people's mindes on the Sonday, that the women afternoon and to-morrow gave freclie great store of that stuffe [linen for tents] almost sufficient to cover all our armie.”\n\npage 24 note a\n\npage 24 note a Alexander Henderson, minister at Edinburgh and rector of the University, the famous leader of the Scotch presbyterian clergy.\n\npage 24 note b\n\npage 24 note b Alexander Livingston, 2nd Earl of Linlithgow, succ. in 1622.\n\npage 24 note c\n\npage 24 note c Robert Dalzell, 2nd Earl of Carnwath, succ. in 1639.\n\npage 24 note d\n\npage 24 note d Patrick Murray, succ. as 3rd Earl of Tullibardine on his brother's resignation in 1629.\n\npage 24 note e\n\npage 24 note e Robert Monro, or Munro, general-major of the Scotch army under Leslie. Like the latter he had gained his military experience in the German wars of Gustavus Adolphus.\n\npage 26 note a\n\npage 26 note a John Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes, succ. in 1621; an active Covenanter and chief of the Scotch Commissioners in England. His death, however, at this time, was a serious misfortune for Charles, who had succeeded in gaining him over. (Clarendon, History, p. 112.)\n\npage 26 note b\n\npage 26 note b Or Roe, ambassador to the Diet at Ratisbon and Vienna concerning the affairs of the Palatinate. A large number of his letters, dated Dec. 1641-Oct. 1643, are among The Nicholas Papers. Correspondence of Sir Edward Nicholas, Secretary of State. Vol. I. 1641-1672 (Eg. MS. 2533, ff. 258–380).\n\npage 27 note a\n\npage 27 note a Algernon Percy, succ. as 10th Earl in 1632; Lord High Admiral in 1636.\n\npage 27 note b\n\npage 27 note b John Stewart, cr. Earl of Traquair in 1633; Royal Commissioner to the General Assembly and the Scotch Parliament in 1639. He was at present under impeachment as chief of the “Incendiaries.”\n\npage 27 note c\n\npage 27 note c At Broughton, where, according to Wood (Athenœ Oxon., iii. p. 546), the Puritan party were wont to hold secret meetings.\n\npage 27 note d\n\npage 27 note d The rest of the letter from this point is scored through for omission.\n\npage 28 note a\n\npage 28 note a Formally ratified on 26 Aug. (Acts of Parliament of Scotland, v. p. 335).\n\npage 29 note a\n\npage 29 note a In spite of a letter from the king stating that he was too far engaged to the Spanish ambassador to draw back, the Houses refused their assent. (L.J.,24,28 Aug. 9 Sept., iv. pp. 374, 381, 394.)\n\npage 30 note a\n\npage 30 note a Sir William Parsons, Master of the Court of Wards, Lord Justice.\n\npage 30 note b\n\npage 30 note b Sir John Borlase, Master of the Ordnance, Lord Justice.\n\npage 30 note c\n\npage 30 note c Robert Dillon, Lord Dillon, afterwards 2nd Earl of Roscommon.\n\npage 30 note d\n\npage 30 note d Sir Adam Loftus, Vice-Treasurer.\n\npage 30 note e\n\npage 30 note e Sir John Temple, Master of the Rolls.\n\npage 31 note a\n\npage 31 note a On the execution of Strafford, Robert Sidney, Earl of Leicester, had been appointed to succeed him as Lord Lieutenant, but he never crossed the Channel to assume the government.\n\npage 32 note a\n\npage 32 note a Jerome Weston, succ. as 2nd Earl in 1634. He was Governor of the Isle of Wight.\n\npage 33 note a\n\npage 33 note a John Maitland, Lord Maitland, succ. as 2nd Earl of Lauderdale in 1645, cr. Duke of Lauderdale in 1672; at this time a zealous Covenanter.\n\npage 35 note a\n\npage 35 note a Admiral of the Narrow Seas, and Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, styled by Clarendon “a very honest gentleman and of unshaken faithfulness and integrity to the king.” (History, ed. 1843, p. 272.) He was an intimate friend of Nicholas, and in his will, dated 14 July 1640 (Eg. MS. 2533, f. 95), the latter is named an executor, with a legacy of 500l. From the same document, which contains much information as to his family connections, it appears that Alderman Isaac Pennington, M.P. for the City of London, and conspicuous for his zeal on the Parliamentary side, was his cousin.\n\npage 35 note b\n\npage 35 note b See the Lords' Journals, 28 Aug., iv. p. 381.\n\npage 36 note a\n\npage 36 note a Ferdinand, son of Philip III. of Spain, Cardinal-Archbishop of Toledo, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands since 1634.

With the natural exception of. art. 3, they are referred to both in the answer of Sir E. Herbert to his impeachment, and in the King's letter on his behalf to the Lord Keeper (Rushworth, iv. pp. 490, 493). It appears from the erasures that Kimbolton's impeachment was an afterthought, the original intention being to call him as a witness with the other peers named, whom it was thought advisable to prevent by this device from serving on the examining committee. Although Clarendon states (ed. 1843, p. 144) that it was Lord Digby who particularly named Kimbolton to Charles, we are almost tempted to explain the surprise and perplexity which Digby showed when the articles were read by his ignorance of the King's change of purpose.\n\npage 63 note a\n\npage 63 note a Eldest son of Sir Edward; afterwards Sir John Nicholas, Clerk of the Council.\n\npage 63 note b\n\npage 63 note b Of Deptford; cr.

He was Dutch plenipotentiary at Munster, and, according to Bougéant, Hist, du Traité de Westphalie, 1767, vol. iii. p. 126, was “l'âme de la faction contraire aux desseins de la France.”\n\npage 73 note a\n\npage 73 note a This letter is written in lemon-juice or sympathetic ink on the inside of a sheet, the first page of which contains a fictitious letter respecting a consignment of serge. Though it professes to be from “Rob. Thomson, sen.” to “Gyles Robinson,” the hand is that of Nich. Oudart, and it is evidently addressed to Sir E. Nicholas. The cipher used in it has fortunately been preserved in Egerton MS. 2550, f. 52. The writer, who was a native of Mechlin, came to England with Sir H. Wotton, and took the degree of M.A. at Oxford 13 Aug. 1626. After being secretary to Sir W. Boswell, Resident at the Hague, he returned to Oxford, and was made M.B. 30 Jan. 1642. He then became Secretary to Nicholas, and remained with him until the surrender of Oxford, when Nicholas gave him a flattering testimonial, 20 June, 1646 (B. M., Add. Ch. 4892). His exact position at this time does not appear, but later in 1647 he was acting as secretary to Charles (Bray, Evelyn, iv. p. 183), and he attended him in 1648 in the Isle of Wight, where ho was employed to write the King's confidential letters to his son (Warwick, Memoirs, 1703, p. 325). His Diary of the Newport conferences in Oct.—Nov. 1648, is printed in Peck's Desiderata Curiosa, 1779, ii. p. 387. Subsequently he was Secretary to Mary, Princess of Orange (who made him one of her executors), Latin Secretary to William, Prince of Orange, and Charles II., and Clerk of the Signet. He was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey, 21 Dec. 1681 (Chester, Westin. Abbey Registers, p. 204).
