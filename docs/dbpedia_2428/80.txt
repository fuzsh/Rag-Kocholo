This is a list of military commanders. These include the "great captains" of history, as they were styled by military historian Liddell Hart; the major leaders of the armies in the most decisive battles of world history. Also included are those who were notoriously flamboyant, incompetent or otherwise famous, such as General Custer.

Napoleon advised military men to study the campaigns of Alexander, Hannibal, Gustavus, Turenne, Eugene and Frederick.[1] Hannibal, after his defeat by Scipio, said that Alexander was the greatest of generals and that Pyrrhus was next to him in greatness.[1] Many others since then have discussed who was the greatest. In 2011, a poll of experts considered who was Britain's greatest general and divided between the Duke of Wellington and William Slim.[2][3]
