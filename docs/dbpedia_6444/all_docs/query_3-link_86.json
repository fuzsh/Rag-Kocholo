        "text": "After many tears, they finally relented, and he was enrolled in Miss Clarice James’s Dancing Academy where lessons were held in a house on Hove sea-front although she actually lived at 119 Church Road. She also held classes at Hove Town Hall. Dolin attended every Friday night, and soon it was twice a week. He learned the basic five positions, wrongly it seemed, and the waltz and polka. He prided himself in being able to hold his position for longer than the girls. Dolin’s first public performance took place at Hove Town Hall in one of the Academy’s Displays when he danced the sailor’s hornpipe.\n\nDolin’s next step was to go to the Oddfellows Hall in Brighton where he had his first real taste of dancing under the jurisdiction of the Misses Lillie and Grace Cone who started to come down from London to take dancing classes in Brighton. Another pupil was also to become famous, and she was Evelyn Laye with flaxen hair, and Dolin always made sure he stood next to her at the barre.\n\nA Dancing Display put on by the Cone sisters at the Brighton Hippodrome changed the course of Dolin’s life because the manager, Mr Boardman, told Mrs Kay that her boy had real talent and ought to go to London to be properly trained. Grandpa Healey died on 4 November 1915, leaving everything to his daughter, but Dolin’s family stayed at Hove until his affairs were settled up. Probate was granted on 6 January 1916, and there was nothing to keep them at Hove, so to London they went.\n\ncopyright © Royal Pavilion & Museums, Brighton & Hove\n\nPatrick Kay's ballet teachers in Brighton\n\nIt is interesting to note that Dolin’s first dance creation was arranged in a room at Belsize Crescent, London, while listening to a recording of Rimsky-Korsakov’s Hymn to the Sun played by the talented Isolde Menges, who was of course born at Hove.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1921, Anton Dolin appeared in Bluebell in Fairyland, Peter Pan, The Hundredth Chance, Betty at Brighton’s Theatre Royal and The Man Who Knew the Future at Brighton’s Palace Pier.\n\nAt a comparatively youthful age Dolin became principal dancer in Diaghilev’s Ballet Russes, and in following his career abroad he soon became fluent in French and Russian. Dolin later became the first artistic director of the London Festival Ballet. He had an enthusiastic following in Brighton and Hove and when the company was at the Hippodrome for a week, he appeared after the final curtain on 2 March 1957 to make a speech. Later on in the same year he even danced at Brighton, although he was 53 by then, and the special performance was in honour of his mother’s birthday. The audience clapped and clapped.\n\nCoincidently also in 1957, on the 9th October the world-famous ballerina Alicia Markova (1910-2004) was just a few miles away in Portslade to officially opened the new Kayser Bondor factory. (Her stage partnership with Anton Dolin lasted 30 years, she along with Anton co-founded Markova-Dolin Ballet in 1935, London's Festival Ballet in 1950, which eventually became the English National Ballet).\n\nDolin was very close to his mother who understood him so well and always encouraged him. She died at Brighton in 1960 and was buried there, and when Dolin died, his ashes were laid to rest in her grave.\n\ncopyright © J.Middleton\n\nAnton Dolin, artistic director and star perfomer, at Brighton's Hippodrome, February/March 1957.\n\nDolin’s honours include the following:\n\ncopyright © Brighton & Hove Bus Company\n\nThe 'Sir Anton Dolin bus' in 2004\n\n(this bus was removed from service in 2014)\n\n1954 – Royal Academy of Dancing Queen Elizabeth II award\n\n1959 – The Order of the Sun (from Peru)\n\n1981 – He was awarded a knighthood\n\nAn extract from an obituary printed in the New York Times, 27 November 1987, by Anna Kisselgoff; 'Sir Anton Dolin, whose early career in Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes led him to become the first internationally acclaimed British male ballet star and who was a founding member of major ballet companies in Britain and the United States, died Friday in Paris. Sir Anton became known as an excellent partner in the many companies in which he was a guest artist. A witty raconteur, he was the author of six books, including several memoirs'.\n\nHouse Notes\n\nNumber 35 (formerly number 34)\n\ncopyright © Royal Pavilion & Museums, Brighton & Hove\n\nBrighton Herald 16 September 1916, Anton Dolin\n\nwould have known this ballet teacher living in his road\n\nNumber 51 (formerly number 26)\n\ncopyright © Royal Pavilion & Museums, Brighton & Hove\n\nBrighton Herald 12 December 1914,\n\nAnton Dolin's Grandfather's next door neighbour, the\n\norganist at the Church of the Sacred Heart, Hove\n\nNumber 53 (formerly number 25) – John Henry Chippindall Healey lived in this house from 1894 until his death in 1915. Today his main claim to fame might be that he was the grandfather of the celebrated Anton Dolin, who, sensibly decided to cast aside the complicated family names he inherited for his more simple stage name.\n\ncopyright © J.Middleton\n\nNumber 53, the home of Anton Dolin's\n\ngrandfather - Captain John Healey\n\nBut his grandfather was a fascinating man in his own right, with varied interests, and wide experiences. He was born in 1842 at Brocklesby, Lincolnshire, being an only child. He decided on a military career, and joined the 11th Regiment of Foot, the year 1861 finding him stationed at Portsmouth, while in 1863 he was in Dublin and by then held the rank of lieutenant. While he was stationed at the Royal Barracks, Dublin, he fell in love with Fanny from County Kildare, and married her. Their daughter, Helen Maude Chippindall Healey, was born in 1869 at Dublin; she was to become the mother of Anton Dolin.\n\nIt seems that Healey became fond of Ireland, or perhaps his wife did not wish to leave the Emerald Isle, but at any rate after retiring from the Army with the rank of Captain, he decided to stay put. He joined the Irish Prison Service, serving as Governor of Maryborough Prison, Leinster, from April 1869 to June 1871, and as Governor of Ennis Prison from 1871 to 1877. It is possible that he might have stayed longer at Maryborough where he had enjoyed playing cricket with his own Captain Healey’s Eleven, but when the penny-pinching Board decided to reduce his annual wage from £200 to £150, he decided it was time to move on.\n\nIt is not known why Captain Healey came to Hove, while also having another home at Old Mill House, Bedhampton, near Havant. It is a remarkable coincidence that he came to live in Lorna Road where Richard Jefferies once lived – Jefferies died in 1877. But Healey must have known all about Jefferies because he was honorary secretary of the Richard Jefferies (Worthing Branch) of the Selborne Society, which was an early conservation society – in fact the oldest one in Britain. He was also honorary secretary of the Havant branch, and later Hove branch, of the RSPB, as well as being a member of the Sussex Archaeological Society. It is pleasant to record that during his declining years, his only daughter and her family came to live in Lorna Road to keep him company. He died on 4 November 1915.\n\nNumbers 69 & 67 (formerly numbers 16 & 17) – From 1905 until 1914, Augustin Albert von Metz ran a private school from these two premises, which he named Pembroke, after the College at the University of Cambridge where studied for his degree. Augustin von Metz was born in London in 1887 to a Prussian father and English mother and had lived in Brighton & Hove since the 1890s. Locally he was involved in amateur dramatics with Brighton's Green Room Club and appeared on stage in various productions at Hove Town Hall and Brighton’s Theatre Royal, he was also a keen tennis player and took part in Sussex County Championships.\n\nThe 1911 Census gave his occupation as an Army and University Tutor, his wife was Lillyan and they had two servants. The census shows von Metz had three students from Spain, two from England and one each from France, Canada and the USA. By the autumn of 1914 von Metz had disappeared from Lorna Road and the ‘school’ was taken over by John Lees Armit. It is probable, because of his German heritagevon Metz was interned on the Isle of Man for the duration of the First World War.\n\n(On 5 August 1914, the Aliens Restriction Act was passed by Parliament the day after war was declared on Germany requiring foreign nationals (aliens) to register with the police, and where necessary they could be interned or deported).\n\nNumber 77 – Mrs B. S. Greensmith lived in this house for some years and in May 1936 she died at the age of 69. She had moved to Hove for health reasons some 26 years previously. She had a son and two daughters – one daughter died aged twelve, and the other went to Ontario, becoming the first female barrister to qualify in Canada. Her son, Laurence Cuthbert Greensmith served during the Irish Rebellion and the First World War. He was seriously injured in France, and when he recovered he was sent to Palestine where he became the first man to enter Jerusalem with a heliograph. He received a personal letter from Lord Allenby congratulating him on his courage. But his health was permanently undermined by his war experiences and he spent the rest of his life as an invalid.\n\ncopyright © J.Middleton\n\nScaffolding covers the house where Richard Jefferies once lived. The plaque is a stone rectangle under the window\n\nNumber 87 (formerly number 8) – The house has a plaque to commemorate the fact that the naturalist and prose poet Richard Jefferies (1848-1887) once lived here. He gave the name Savernake to the house (Savernake is a forest south of Marlborough).\n\ncopyright © J.Middleton\n\ncopyright © Royal Pavilion & Museums, Brighton & Hove\n\nBrighton Graphic 19 December 1914\n\nNumber 91 (formerly number 6) – The West Brighton Estate Company owned this house when in 1928 they applied to Hove Council for permission to convert the premises into flats.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nLorna House – In June 1991 it was stated that Lorna House was the latest office building to be completed at Hove. It was a five-storey air-conditioned building with a total of 16,500 sq-ft of office space. It was on offer for around £2.5 million. In April 1995 the freehold interest in the property was sold by Quistheads Ltd for around £700,000 to Brightacre, part of the Bellerby College Group. Lorna House offices was built on the site of the former Morgan & Smith organ factory.\n\ncopyright © J.Middleton\n\nThe new Lorna House covers the site once occupied by Morgan & Smith\n\nMorgan & Smith – was an organ factory situated in Lorna Road, the company had moved from Brighton to Hove in 1910. The organ factory was built at the western end of Lorna Road, although its address was also known as Wilbury Bridge (telephone Hove 4524).\n\nThe firm manufactured organs for churches and chapels all over the UK and many countries abroad, in Brighton alone in the 1920s there were nineteen churches and chapels with Morgan & Smith built organs.\n\ncopyright © Royal Pavilion & Museums, Brighton & Hove\n\nFrom the Brighton Herald 3 August 1912 (the organ is still in use at St Barnabas Church)\n\nMorgan & Smith was still listed in the Directories until 1940 but by 1947 it was located at 1A Steine Street, Brighton. By the 1950s it had returned to Hove once more, and was to be found first at 2 Livingstone Road, and by 1956 it was at 37 Payne Avenue where it was still in existence in the 1970s.\n\ncopyright © Royal Pavilion & Museums, Brighton & Hove\n\nMr ‘Railway’ Ralph Stent – He lived in the road, and was a leading authority on steam trains, and he was also a nephew of the William Stroudley, the great locomotive engineer.
