        "text": "Appendix\n\nThanhouser Films - British Releases\n\nThanhouser-Princess-Falstaff\n\nRELEASE DATES IN GREAT BRITAIN\n\n(selected films)\n\nThanhouser films are listed alphabetically, then the release date in the United States is given, followed by the release date in Great Britain. Releases in 1910 were through The Gaumont Co., Ltd. (which secured the Thanhouser agency in October 1910). Most 1913 releases were through the Western Import Co., Ltd., while most released from 1914 onward were by Thanhouser Films, Ltd. PathÃ© FrÃ¨res Cinema, Ltd., a branch of the French firm, also distributed certain Thanhouser subjects in England. Much of the information presented below is from Mr. Tony Fletcher of The Cinema Museum, London.\n\nThe listing below does not represent all Thanhouser films distributed in Great Britain, but only those whose release dates could be confirmed by the time the present work went to press. Dates are listed the American way, in order by month, day, and year.\n\nOccasionally British film journals would misattribute a film to Thanhouser. Examples include these Thanhouser listings printed in The Biograph and elsewhere: Loves Toll (actually a Lubin film), Renas Pet Pirate (actually a Thistle film), Tillies Tomato Surprise (actually a Lubin film), and Soul of a Thief (actually an American film). A modern reference, The British Film Catalogue 1895-1985 (by Denis Gifford; David & Charles; Newton Abbot and London; 1986) states that a serial produced by Hepworth, The Exploits of Tubby, was distributed in Great Britain by Thanhouser; if this was so, there was no connection with the Thanhouser interests in America.\n\nA\n\nAcross the Way (Princess) (February 12, 1915) (British release date: July 5, 1915)\n\nActor and the BUMPKIN, The (Falstaff) (British release title for The Actor and the Rube) (April 16, 1915) (British release date: September 30, 1915)\n\nActor and the Rube, The (Falstaff) (British release title: The Actor and the Bumpkin) (April 16, 1915) (British release date: September 30, 1915)\n\nAdrift in a Great City (January 13, 1914) (British release date: April 13, 1914)\n\nAdventure of Florence, The (February 23, 1915) (British release date: July 8, 1915)\n\nAdventures of a Diplomatic Free Lance Series, The.
