        "text": "To.day the membership of \"The\n\nChildren's Corner\" has reached the\n\ngrand total of 2763. New members en\n\nrolled: Kathleen Wilkins (9d), June\n\nRodman (11), Letitia Rodman (10),\n\nSprent; Patricia Williams (11), Upper\n\nBurnie; Judith Brett and Gerald Brett\n\n(121-4), twins, Gunn's Plains; Pam\n\nSaltmarsh (102), N. Motton.\n\nThe monthly prize (6-11 years), goes\n\nto Ila Willcox (9),' Gawler, for \"Mus\n\ntard and Cress,\" a quaint little piece\n\nhoe copied, highly commended on Oc\n\ntober 0, and published to-day. To sow\n\nvery carefully the seeds of tiny plants\n\nsuch as mustard and cress, or better\n\nstill, those of gay and low growing\n\nflowers. to spell a name later on, is an\n\nold anl very charming custom. Try\n\nit in your own garden! Make the soil\n\nvery fine, mark the name with a stick,\n\nthen scatter the seed of \"mustard and\n\ncress,\" Virginia stock or lobelia.\n\n\"'Elizabeth,\" the name of the little\n\ngirl in the winning verses, is rather\n\nlong, so try \"Ann,\" \"Beth.\" \"Jim\"\n\nor ' Bill\" to begin with! The weekly\n\nprize (6.16 years) has been awarded for\n\n\"To the Lark,\" verses copied by Eric\n\nCooper (8}), \"Mawbanna). The E]ng\n\nlish skylark with its lilting note is\n\nheard quite often now. It is a joy to\n\nlisten to the little bird, singing in the\n\nsunshine as it wings its way to the\n\nblue skies. It trills all the way back\n\nto the ground below, too.\n\nTwo entries of copied verses, \"She's\n\nEngland Yet\" from June Rodman (11)\n\nSprent, ndal \"Gate of the Year\" from\n\nLetitia Rodman (10), Sprent, two new\n\ncomers to \"The Corner,\" are highly\n\ncommended today. These highly com\n\nmended entries, as well as those held\n\nover from previous weeks, will be pub\n\nlished as space permits.\n\nOnce more I have to remind members\n\nthat requests for pen-friends should\n\nnot be made in their letters, also that\n\nentries should he written in ink, not\n\nin pencil. Address all correspondence\n\nto \"Lorna Doone,\" \"The Advocate\"\n\nOffice, Ulverstone (not to Burnie or\n\nDevonport). Love to all girls and\n\nboys of \"The Corner\" . . . LORNA\n\nDOONE."
