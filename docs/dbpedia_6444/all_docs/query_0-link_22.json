        "text": "American actor and film director\n\nFor the judge, see William Lockhart Garwood.\n\nWilliam Davis Garwood, Jr. (April 28, 1884 – December 28, 1950) was an American stage and film actor and director of the early silent film era in the 1910s.\n\nBetween 1911 and 1913, Garwood starred in a number of early adaptions of popular films, including Jane Eyre and The Vicar of Wakefield (1910), Lorna Doone (1911), The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1911), David Copperfield (1911), The Merchant of Venice (1912), and Little Dorrit (1913), and Robin Hood (1913). In total, he starred in more than 150 short and feature films.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nWilliam Davis Garwood, Jr. was born in Springfield, Missouri.[1] He attended public schools in Springfield before moving to New Mexico at the age of 15.[1][2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nGarwood left American Studios after eight months and signed a two-year contract with Universal Film Manufacturing Company in late May 1914. Garwood's first picture for Universal was On Dangerous Ground, released in 1915. By this time, Garwood's popularity had risen and he became a popular leading man with a sizable female fan base.[1] During this time, he worked exclusively with a popular actress of the time, Violet Mersereau, with whom he starred in a number of short films.[3] They worked together in many one-reel comedy film that year, including You Can't Always Tell, Destiny's Trump Card, Uncle's New Blazer, The Adventure of the Yellow Curl Papers, Wild Blood and The Supreme Impulse. During his time at Universal, Garwood also starred as the title character in Lord John in New York (now considered lost).[4] Based on the short story by C.N. and A.M. Williamson, the film proved to be popular with audiences and Garwood starred in four more Lord John films over the following months.[3]\n\nLater years and death\n\n[edit]\n\nBy the late 1910s, Garwood's career began to falter because of his chronic alcoholism.[5] He made his final screen appearance in 1919's A Proxy Husband, which he also directed after which he retired. Garwood reportedly lived off of the fortune he made through various investments.[6]\n\nGarwood was a lifelong bachelor and had no children. On December 28, 1950, he died of cirrhosis due to alcoholism in Los Angeles at the age of 66.[5][7]\n\nSelected filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nShort subject Year Title Role Notes 1909 The Cowboy Millionaire Alternative titles: Fell Heir to a Million Dollars\n\nThe Millionaire Cowboy 1911 The Pasha's Daughter 1911 Baseball and Bloomers 1911 For Her Sake Confederate Soldier, Lover 1911 Cally's Comet Jack 1911 The Railroad Builder 1911 The Colonel and the King 1911 Flames and Fortune The Rescuer 1911 The Coffin Ship 1911 Courting Across the Court The Lover 1911 Won by Wireless Wireless Operator 1911 That's Happiness The Wealthy Old Woman's Son 1911 The Smuggler The Smuggler 1911 The Buddhist Priestess The Naval Officer 1911 The Higher Law The Minister 1911 David Copperfield 1912 A New Cure for Divorce The Groom 1912 Conductor 786 The Conductor's Son 1912 At the Foot of the Ladder The Society Leader 1912 Please Help the Pore The Poor Father 1912 A Six Cylinder Elopement John Henderson, Gray's Daughter's Sweetheart 1912 Put Yourself in His Place Henry Little 1912 The Little Girl Next Door The Husband 1912 Petticoat Camp 1912 Frankfurters and Quail 1912 The Thunderbolt The Poor Couple's Son, as an Adult 1912 Standing Room Only The Cook's Sweetheart 1912 Aurora Floyd 1912 With the Mounted Police The Mounted Policeman 1913 The Heart of a Fool Sir Roger Motley 1913 The Evidence of the Film The Broker 1913 Some Fools There Were First Unsuspecting Bachelor 1913 Her Gallant Knights 1913 For Her Boy's Sake The Son 1913 The Caged Bird The Prince 1913 The Oath of Pierre Pierre Dorchet – a Young Trapper 1913 Beautiful Bismark The Real Estate Agent 1913 The Lady Killer 1913 The Shoemaker and the Doll The Shoemaker 1913 A Mix-Up in Pedigrees Bob Brown 1913 Through the Sluice Gates John Browning 1913 The Oath of Tsuru San Ned Winthrop 1913 Article 47, L' 1913 The House in the Tree Jack – age 20 1913 Rick's Redemption Rick 1914 The Ten of Spades Ralph West – the Prospector 1914 A Ticket to Red Horse Gulch Jack Oliver 1914 A Turn of the Cards John Richards 1914 Fate's Decree John Graves 1914 The Green-Eyed Devil 1914 The Hunchback Tom Carson – a Young Prospector 1914 Imar the Servitor Imar 1914 The Body in the Trunk 1914 The Lost Sermon Rev.
