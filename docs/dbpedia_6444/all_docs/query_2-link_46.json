Having worked for André Antoine as an actor and producer, he joined the Eclair Film Company in 1912 and travelled to their American Studios at Fort Lee, New Jersey, in 1914. There he directed films based on successful stage plays. In The Wishing Ring it is possible to see the charm and visual beauty he brought to his work. His team consisted of John van der Broek, the cameraman who later tragically drowned during one of Tourneur's productions; Ben Carré, the art director; and Clarence Brown, his editor, who would later achieve fame as Garbo's favorite director.\n\nTourneur was most literate in his pronouncements on the cinema, individualistic and iconoclastic at times. He saw the cinema in perspective and would not concede it a status equal to the other arts. He stated: \"To speak of the future development of the art of the cinema is futile. It cannot be. It costs a great deal of money to produce a motion picture. The only way the financial backer can get his money back, to say nothing of a profit, is to appeal to the great masses. And the thing that satisfies millions cannot be good. As Ibsen once wrote, it is the minority which is always right.\" In practice, however, Tourneur's own work belied this statement. To everything he did he brought a sense of beauty and great responsibility to his audiences.\n\nTourneur directed Clara Kimball Young in Trilby, Mary Pickford in Pride of the Clan and Poor Little Rich Girl, the latter a very successful film. He made three films with Olga Petrova. In 1918 five memorable films came from his hand: Elsie Ferguson appeared in his The Doll's House; two other stage plays, The Bluebird by Maeterlinck and Prunella by Granville Barker, gave Tourneur full scope for his visual style; Woman was a series of episodes that dealt with Adam and Eve, Claudius and Messalina, Heloise and Abelard, a Breton fisherman and a mermaid. and a Civil War story; and Sporting Life was significant for its absence of stars and its depiction of a fog-ridden London, anticipating Griffith's Broken Blossoms of the following year.\n\nIn 1919 Tourneur made Joseph Conrad's Victory for Paramount. A year later, he unveiled a delightful Treasure Island with Shirley Mason (as Jim Hawkins) and Lon Chaney, who also starred in While Paris Sleeps. For Associated Producers he made The Last of the Mohicans, which many consider to be his masterpiece, although Clarence Brown took over direction when Tourneur fell ill during production.\n\nTourneur's remaining Hollywood films included Lorna Doone, The Christian, The Isle of Lost Ships, The Brass Bottle, The White Moth, Never the Twain Shall Meet, and Aloma of the South Seas. During the production of The Mysterious Island for MGM, however, Tourneur grew resentful of a producer's interference. He walked off the set and returned to France. He continued to work in films in Europe, his first being L'Equipage. In 1929 he made Das Schiff der Verlorene in Germany with Marlene Dietrich. This was his last silent film, but he accepted the coming of sound and, before his death in 1961, he had made over 20 sound films. The most important of these were Les Deux Orphelines, the delightful Katia with Danielle Darieux, Volpone with Harry Baur and Louis Jouvet, La Main du diable, made from a story by Gerard de Nerval and featuring Pierre Fresnay, and his last film, L'Impasse des deux anges. Tourneur was a man who had no illusions about working in films. He realized the limitations of Hollywood and the films he was given to direct. However, he brought his considerable talent as a designer to bear on his work, and did not hesitate to experiment. He stylized his sets and was influenced by new movements in the theater, but he also used the effects of nature to heighten his dramas. His awareness of the potentialities of the camera was profound, giving strength to his images.\n\n—Liam O'Leary"
