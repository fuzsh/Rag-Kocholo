It was filmed twice before in 1912 in England for Clarendon, and in 1915 for the American Biograph Company.[3] Other later adaptations include 1934 and 1951 films, and 1990 and 2001 television movies.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMadge Bellamy as Lorna Doone\n\nMae Giraci as Lorna as a Child (credited as Mae Giracci)\n\nJohn Bowers as John Ridd\n\nCharles Hatton as John as a Child\n\nFrank Keenan as Sir Ensor Doone\n\nJack McDonald as Counsellor Doone (credited as Jack MacDonald)\n\nDonald McDonald as Carver Doone\n\nNorris Johnson as Ruth, John's Cousin\n\nGertrude Astor as Countess of Brandir (uncredited)\n\nJames Robert Chandler as Frye (uncredited)\n\nIrene De Voss as Lorna's Mother (uncredited)\n\nJoan Standing as Gwenny Carfax (uncredited)\n\nRestoration\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001 a digital restoration of the film was financed by Georgia cinephile Jesse Sharp and released on DVD by Kino International. Japanese singer/songwriter Mari Iijima composed an all-new musical score for the film.[4]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a contemporary review, Variety wrote, \"Madge Bellamy has just the right wistful quality of beauty for Lorna...the histrionic honors, however, go to that best of character portrait makers, Frank Keenan, as Sir Ensor Doone...The scenic features of the picture have been splendidly managed. The stagecoach inn might have been lifted from an authentic print of the times. The spirited passage of the coach robbery on the seashore is a smashing bit of pictorial emphasis and the action in the robber's village is scenically impressive.\"[5]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
