        "text": "1. Trouble at Fort LaPointe by Kathleen Ernst (1999)\n\nI couldn’t put this book down! Originally part of the series of American Girl History Mysteries, this short but fascinating novel is set on Madeline Island in 1732, in which a young Métis girl sets out to solve a puzzling mystery. I found the historical elements wonderfully engaging, and Kathleen Ernst is a fabulous writer (I love several of her other American Girl mysteries, including Midnight in Lonesome Hollow).\n\n2. Runaway Alice by Frances Salomon Murphy (1951)\n\nThis story of a foster child in the 1950s is a powerful, poignant MG novel—and, in my opinion, a retelling of Anne of Green Gables. Alice is unsuccessful in finding the right family until a kind couple on a farm usher her into their home. The way Alice’s life and happiness blossom is beautiful to read, and it’s a meaningful and moving read that will stay with you long afterward.\n\n3. Miss Billy Married by Eleanor Porter (1914)\n\nOh! The joy of a vintage series where you can’t recall how many proposals the heroine has received! This spring I breezed through the Miss Billy trilogy, which culminates in the humorous Miss Billy Married (the best in the series!), in which a young woman struggles to adjust to married life (but I will not give the spoiler of which suitor she ends up choosing). I always enjoy Eleanor Porter’s books, and this one is a particular delight.\n\n4. The Light at Tern Rock by Julia Sauer (1951)\n\nI was surprised by this book for several reasons. Firstly because of its slim size—a mere 62 pages!—and secondly, because despite its short length, it won the Newbery Medal! But once you begin to read, you understand why it won the medal: its descriptions are luminous, the illustrations captivating, and the message compelling. The perfect holiday tale, The Light at Tern Rock tells the story of a boy and his aunt who agree to look after a lighthouse until its keeper returns for Christmas—but when he doesn’t come, they have to make do on their own.\n\n5. The Cabin Faced West by Jean Fritz (1958)\n\nI’d heard of this book many times before (Goodreads was constantly recommending it to me), so I decided to give it a try—and quickly fell in love with the sweet story and vividly warm characters. Centering around a little girl who is unhappy with her family’s move to the Pennsylvania countryside in 1784—but who gradually comes to appreciate her new home and friends—this is even more fun for me because it’s based on a true story.\n\n6. A Gathering of Light by Amanda Dykes (2020)\n\nThis novelette is brand-new, just released to Amanda’s email subscribers on December 22nd! I read it immediately and adored its Christmassy feel and lovable cast. The story will be especially delightful to fans of Amanda’s novel Whose Waves These Are, as it takes place in the same Maine village and features some of the same characters.\n\n7. Once on This Island by Gloria Whelan (1995)\n\nI greatly enjoyed this first novel in the Mackinac Island trilogy by Gloria Whelan, which features a resourceful teenager who comes up against numerous challenges during her father’s absence from the island during the War of 1812.\n\n8.Chronicles of Avonlea by L.M. Montgomery (1912)\n\nL.M. Montgomery’s classic short story collection was an unexpected joy, because somehow I always forget that Montgomery’s brilliant writing shines even in shorter forms. I loved reading new tales involving Anne Shirley, and also discovering the inspiration behind episodes of the Road to Avonlea TV series.\n\n9. Cherry Ames, Boarding School Nurse by Helen Wells (1954)\n\nI’ve read most of the Cherry Ames mysteries, and this one was a particular favorite! This one details Cherry’s search for a long-forgotten perfume formula secreted away in a historic boarding school.\n\n10. The Cottage at Bantry Bay by Hilda van Stockum (1938)\n\nThis is the first time I’ve tried one of Hilda van Stockum’s books outside of the Mitchell family trilogy, and this one was a lovely mixture of humor, heart, and fun featuring a close-knit family (and their mischievous dog!) in 1930s Ireland."
