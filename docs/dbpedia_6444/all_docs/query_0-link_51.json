        "text": "Hello, BaWers! I hope you're all healthy and safe.\n\nI've read 29 books since my post on May 3, which puts me at 104 for the year. The order of the books in my posts is roughly that in which I finished reading the books, although I do sometimes cluster related titles to remark on them as a set. The object is to gather the mental slips of paper I’ve tucked into each book — passages I hope to remember, articles and / or images I sought while reading, my reasons for choosing this volume or that, etc.\n\n■ After I’m Gone (Laura Lippman; 2014. Fiction.) RFS\n\n■ I’d Know You Anywhere (Laura Lippman; 2010. Fiction.) RFS\n\nIn 2008, I read Lippman’s What the Dead Know (2007). Although I do not remember much about it, the fact that I read it is all that explains the two additional Lippman titles on my shelves. In a different time, After I’m Gone would have been an adequate poolside companion.\n\n■ The Journalist and the Murderer (Janet Malcolm; 1990. Non-fiction.) RFS\n\nMost know this book’s first sentence, which is also its argument: “Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.” Related links here and here.\n\n■ Tales from the Loop (Simon Stålenhag; 2014. Graphic fiction.) LIB\n\nI had thought the stories would be too slight, but, in fact, they amplify the weird beauty of his paintings. Related article here.\n\np. 77\n\nThe one thing he was admired for was his accurate penalty shots when we played soccer during recess, so his stories may have been designed to get some attention during the winter months, when the soccer field play frozen and empty. What follows is what he told us.\n\n■ Mother Night (Kurt Vonnegut; 1961. Fiction.) RFS *\n\nRevisiting my Vonnegut collection requires reassurance, “Ah, it holds up,” as if I were crossing a footbridge that readily supported my younger, lighter self but might buckle under the weight of my older, solid self. This book argues strongly for the bridge’s inherent reliability.\n\n■ Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (J.K. Rowling; 1999. Fiction.) RFS *\n\nA comforting reread.\n\n■ The Nickel Boys (Colson Whitehead; 2019. Fiction.) RFS\n\nWhat can I add to the chorus (e.g., here, here, and here) that has praised this and his earlier The Underground Railroad?\n\n■ Bartleby, the Scrivener (Herman Melville; 1856. Fiction.) RFS *\n\nFrom “Herman Melville’s Bartleby and the steely strength of mild rebellion” (The Guardian; January 9, 2017):\n\nThere are very few stories that, on re-reading after re-reading, seem to become impossibly more perfect, but Herman Melville’s eerie, aching story Bartleby, the Scrivener is one such. Like a parable without an obvious moral, it is defiance raised to the metaphysical.\n\n■ Chaos: Charles Manson, the CIA, and the Secret History of the Sixties (Tom O’Neill; 2019. Non-fiction.) RFS\n\nRelated link here.\n\np. 84\n\nI was writing a story about Charles Manson that had, so far, very little Manson in it. It was more about the way that events, in all their messy reality, boiled down to canonical fact; the way that a narrative becomes the narrative.\n\n■ The Metamorphosis (Franz Kafka (1915); Bantam ed. 1972. 201 pages. Fiction.) RFS *\n\nHave seven years passed since I read this with my daughters?\n\n■ Kafka (Robert Crumb; 1993 / 2013. Graphic non-fiction.) RFS\n\n■ James Joyce: Portrait of a Dubliner (Alfonso Zapico; 2011. Graphic non-fiction.) RFS\n\nExcellent, both.\n\n■ The Underground Railroad (Colson Whitehead; 2016. Fiction.) RFS\n\nRelated link here.\n\n■ The Book of Delights (Ross Gay; 2019. Non-fiction.) ATY\n\nFollowing Melissa’s recommendation, I finished this collection of essays in 1.5 sittings. Related link here.\n\np. 32\n\n[T]he process of thinking that writing is, made disappearable by the delete button, makes a whole part of the experience of writing, which is the production of a good deal of florid detritus, flotsam and jetsam, all those words that mean what you have written and cannot disappear (the scratch-out its own archive), which is the weird path toward what you have come to know, which is called thinking, which is what writing is.\n\np. 49\n\n“What if we joined our wildernesses together?” Sit with that for a minute. That the body, the life, might carry a wilderness, an unexplored territory, and that yours and mine might somewhere, somehow, meet. Might, even, join.\n\np. 195\n\nI’m from the Northeast, I hear myself say. Or, I’m a Northeasterner. Meaning, linguistically, that the appropriate plural of “you” in certain contexts is “yous.” Meaning the beach is called the shore, and you go down to it. To swim in the wooder.\n\nAside: If I had a dollar for every quizzical look I have endured when asking for a glass of water, I could buy a large house on the shore.\n\n■ The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents (Terry Pratchett; 2001. Fiction.) RFS\n\nPart of an informal summer book club with my older daughter.\n\n■ A Very Easy Death (Simone de Beauvoir; 1964. Non-fiction.) RFS\n\nA friend recently shared that she thought her mother might be making surreptitious cigarette runs to the corner store. It wasn’t that the woman, who is in her late seventies, had resumed the habit that so upset my friend; it was that she was venturing out during the pandemic and not letting the people in her circle know.\n\nI listened, because in such conversations, that is all that is generally required. When her anger had abated a bit, I ventured, “You have officially entered the ‘parenting your parent’ stage, eh?” Later, in one of those odd moments of serendipity / synthesis / synchronicity, I realized that Beauvoir’s memoir of her mother’s illness, hospitalization, and death was the book I planned to read next.\n\np. 92\n\nWell-intentioned readers urged, ‘Disappearing is not of the least importance: your works will remain.’ And inwardly I told them all that they were wrong. Religion could do no more for my mother than the hope of posthumous success could do for me. Whether you think of it as heavenly or as earthly, if you love life immortality is no consolation for death.\n\np. 98\n\nEveryone knows the power of things: life is solidified in them, more immediately present than in any one of its instants.\n\n■ Providence of a Sparrow (Chris Chester; 2002. Non-fiction.) RFS\n\nUnfinished business from last year. Related link here.\n\np. 7\n\nBaseline for me has always been slightly below sea level. Too modest a depth in which to drown but deep enough to suggest what life must be like for those truly debilitated by anxiety and sadness that doesn’t go away. I suspect my mother and I have this in common and that her rather non-specific complaints of “not feeling well” I recall from childhood were tendrils snaking out from that buried route. She died of cancer when I was twenty-three, long before I developed enough compassion and insight to know her better. A pity, it’s likely we’d have found lots to discuss.\n\np. 182\n\nThe realization that we volunteer for many of our sorrows has helped me a good deal. We acquire them in seed form with each new attachment and shouldn’t be surprised when they sprout one day. Speaking as a person whose biochemistry manufactures gloom as a matter of course, it’s taken me years to understand that fate has never singled me out. The universe has better things to do than plague me with loss or go out of its way to make my life miserable. A perverse egotism is one of the problems with free-floating depression. It sits on your psyche calling attention to itself until you have to believe you’re important enough and special enough for the gods to persecute.\n\n■ The Blue Castle (L.M. Montgomery; 1926. Fiction.) RFS\n\nThis had been in my shelves for a decade. Thanks to Jeanne’s review, I finally read (and loved) it.\n\n■ Alexander’s Bridge (Willa Cather; 1912. Fiction.) RFS\n\nIt is difficult to believe that this was her first novel.\n\n■ Breakfast at Tiffany’s (Truman Capote; 1958. Fiction.) RFS *\n\nI first read this book more than thirty years ago, but I actually read it last week. Capote was a genius.\n\n■ I, Juan de Pareja (Elizabeth Barton de Treviño; 1965. Fiction.) RFS\n\nThis satisfied my Children’s / YA RFS sub-challenge. From the Metropolitan Museum of Art:\n\nVelázquez most likely executed this portrait of his enslaved assistant in Rome during the early months of 1650. According to one of the artist’s biographers, when this landmark of western portraiture was first put on display it “received such universal acclaim that in the opinion of all the painters of different nations everything else seemed like painting but this alone like truth.” Months after depicting his sitter in such a proud and confident way, Velázquez signed a contract of manumission that would liberate him from bondage in 1654.\n\n■ Incident at Vichy (Arthur Miller; 1965. Drama.) RFS *\n\nThis fit in so well with recent (re)reading: The Plot Against America (Philip Roth; 2004), Man’s Search for Meaning: An Introduction to Logotherapy (Viktor E. Frankl; 1946), and Mother Night (Kurt Vonnegut; 1961).\n\n■ Gilgamesh: A New English Version (Stephen Mitchell; 2004. Poetry.) RFS *\n\n“Gilgamesh is the story of a hero’s journey,” writes Stephen Mitchell in the introduction; “one might say that it is the mother of all heroes’ journeys, with its huge uninhibited mythic presences moving through a landscape of a dream.” He explains:\n\nThe archetypal hero’s journey proceeds in stages: being called to action, meeting a wise man or guide, crossing the threshold into the numinous world of the adventure, passing various tests, attaining the goal, defeating the forces of evil, and going back home. It leads to a spiritual transformation at the end, a sense of gratitude, humility, and deepened trust in the intelligence of the universe. After he finds the treasure or slays the dragon or wins the princess or joins with the mind of the sage, the hero can return to ordinary life in a state of grace, as a blessing to himself and to his whole community. He has suffered, he has triumphed, he is at peace.\n\nSo Gilgamesh is a quest story, maintains Mitchell, but on close inspection, it’s a “bizarre, quirky, and postmodern” one.\n\nRevisiting Mitchell’s remarkable version of “the oldest story in the world, a thousand years older than the Iliad or the Bible,” I was again undone by Book VIII. Enkindu, Gilgamesh’s best friend, has died. “Hear me, elders, hear me, young men,” laments Gilgamesh,\n\n[M]y beloved friend is dead, he is dead,\n\nmy beloved brother is dead, I will mourn\n\nas long as I breathe, I will sob for him\n\nlike a woman who has lost her only child.\n\nO, Enkindu, you were the axe at my side\n\nin which my arm trusted, the knife in my sheath,\n\nthe shield I carried, my glorious robe,\n\nthe wide belt around my loins, and now\n\na harsh fate has torn you from me, forever.\n\nAs they did sixteen years ago, the cadences of his profound grief recalled to me W.H. Auden:\n\nHe was my North, my South, my East and West,\n\nMy working week and my Sunday rest,\n\nMy noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;\n\nI thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.\n\nThe stars are not wanted now: put out every one;\n\nPack up the moon and dismantle the sun;\n\nPour away the ocean and sweep up the wood.\n\nFor nothing now can ever come to any good.\n\n■ Einstein’s Dreams (Alan Lightman; 1993. Fiction.) RFS\n\nPatterns often emerge in my reading, and I find that this oddly complements Flatland, which I read last month.\n\nAside: When I pulled the book from the shelves, I noticed a bookmark. I figured it was from the bookstore, but it was a commemorative item from a wedding, which meant I purchased this book used — perhaps at a library sale or a Half Price Books location? Of course, I Googled the couple and found that they had purchased a house in Illinois a few years after marrying. A yen to mail them their bookmark with a note about how awesome it was that they distributed bookmarks — bookmarks! — as a reminder of their special day seized me and would not let me go — until I realized that while the discovery may have delighted me, the reminder might not necessarily delight them. I wonder how many moments of joy are aborted by “On second thought…”?\n\n■ The Odd Woman and the City (Vivian Gornick; 2015. Non-fiction.) RFS\n\nI began this several years ago but apparently never finished it (although much to my chagrin, it appears in my 2016 books read list). I removed the bookmark and began again, finishing in one sitting. This reading experience reminded me of the deep delight (that word again!) I experienced when I first read Diana Athill’s Stet: An Editor’s Life nearly twenty years ago: More! I want to hear more of this voice! Related article here.\n\np. 20\n\nOne’s own best self. For centuries, this was the key concept behind any essential definition of friendship: that one’s friend is a virtuous being who speaks to the virtue in oneself. How foreign is such a concept to the children of the therapeutic culture! Today we do not look to see, much less affirm, our best selves in one another. To the contrary, it is the openness with which we admit to our emotional incapacities — the fear, the anger, the humiliation — that excites contemporary bonds of friendship. Nothing draws us closer to one another than the degree to which we face our deepest shame openly in one another’s company. Coleridge and Wordsworth dreaded such self-exposure; we adore it. What we want is to feel known, warts and all: the more warts the better. It is the great illusion of our culture that what we confess to is who we are.\n\np. 100\n\nGood conversation is not a matter of mutuality of interests or class concerns or commonly held ideals, it’s a matter of temperament: the thing that makes someone respond instinctively with an appreciative “I know just what you mean,” rather than the argumentative “Whaddaya mean by that?” In the presence of shared temperament, the conversation almost never loses its free, unguarded flow; in its absence, one is always walking on eggshells.\n\n■ We Have Always Lived in a Castle (Shirley Jackson; 1962. Fiction.) RFS\n\nAlthough it received mix reviews, I may watch the film later this week. From NPR:\n\nBut calling Castle [the novel] “horror” would be a misrepresentation of the work, which is really a Gothic psychodrama that eats itself from the inside. The story centers around the peculiarities of the Blackwood sisters, the ones in the giant gabled manor up on a hill. They were orphaned years ago after their parents succumbed to a dinnertime poisoning. Who poisoned them?\n\n■ The Ocean at the End of the Lane (Neil Gaiman; 2013. Fiction.) RFS\n\nFrom A.S. Byatt, writing in The Guardian (July 3, 2013):\n\nGaiman is a master of fear, and he understands the nature of fairytales, the relation between the writer, the reader and the character in the tale.\n\n■ Vincent and Theo: The Van Gogh Brothers (Deborah Heiligman; 2017. Non-fiction.) RFS\n\nBy the author of the lovely biography Charles and Emma: The Darwins’ Leap of Faith, this satisfied my Art RFS sub-challenge.\n\np. 50\n\nThey promise to always be close, to keep the bond between them strong and intimate. They will always walk together. They will be more than brothers, more than friends. They will be companions in the search for meaning in life and meaning in art. Together they will achieve lives filled with a purpose. And they will, when needed, carry each other’s parcels.\n\n■ Cassandra at the Wedding (Dorothy Baker; 1962. Fiction.) RFS\n\nThis satisfied my NYRB RFS sub-challenge and completed my Goodreads goal of 104 books, and now Cassandra and Merricat, the unreliable narrator of Jackson’s We Have Always Lived in the Castle are paired in my readerly imagination. From Nicholas Lazard’s review (The Guardian, October 30, 2012):\n\nThanks to the tireless raising of the point by Howard Jacobson and others, it seems just possible that the notion is sinking in that not to like a novel because one does not find the central character likeable is not, actually, a sophisticated way of reading. I need hardly add that I wholly endorse this view – but this doesn’t mean that I think there’s something immature or unworthy in taking pleasure in the characters a writer creates, whether you’re the reader or the writer.\n\np. 81\n\nI love our bedroom, but it was designed for us as we once were, not as we are now.\n\n—————————————\n\nATY Acquired this year\n\nLIB Borrowed from library (including Hoopla and Overdrive)\n\nOTH Other\n\nRFS Read from shelves\n\n* Denotes a reread\n\nSince several of the chapters of book 1 are long, I'm dividing up my comments over 2 posts 😄 -- here is 2 of 2:\n\nFELLOWSHIP OF THE RING - BOOK 1\n\nchap. 11: “A Knife in the Dark”\n\nOff into the Wild, with Aragorn as guide and servants of the Dark Lord pursuing... And may I just say: I think I have encountered these midges and \"neeker-breekers\" on past backpacking trips... 😵\n\n__________\n\nMotif of Horns / Blowing Horns\n\nHorns, traditionally used for war troop signaling or for hunting, were also used by medieval people as a way of summoning/mustering the people for sudden emergencies or action. Horns in The Lord of the Rings are used as a signal in war for attacking or standing against the enemy, or coming to the rescue of those besieged... In Book 2, we will encounter a character who is known for the heirloom horn he carries. And in the Shire, horns alert to a community danger or need; here, Frodo's hobbit friend Fatty Bolger who has been \"keeping up the pretense\" that Frodo is still at the cottage in Crickhollow, runs to tell the village of the invading evil Black Riders:\n\n“...a horn rang out. It rent the night like fire on a hill-top: ‘awake! fear! fire! foes! awake!’ “\n\n__________\n\nHistory lesson...??\n\nRight in the middle of the rising tension and suspense of this chapter, we get---- some of Middle-earth’s past history!! We learn a little of some of the First and Second Age events: the Last Alliance of Elves (Gil-galad) and Men (Elendil), from Sam’s song fragment from the lay of The Fall of Gil-galad, and then Beren and Luthien (Aragorn’s lay of the Tale of Tinúviel), and Aragorn's summary of how they stood against the Dark Lord. Why do we get this here and now? Because Middle-earth's past is intersecting with its present, the end of the Third Age. Aragorn is a descendent of the historical figures in these two lays; the hobbits are at Weathertop, the site of an ancient tower of defense against the Dark Lord; and they are attacked by the Ring Wraiths, the ancient servants of the Dark Lord.\n\n__________\n\nLuthien and Beren\n\nWhile Tolkien never directly called his wife Edith “Luthien”, he has written that “…she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of The Silmarillion”— a story he also includes here in the trilogy. After Tolkien returned from WW1 service in France to recover his health, he and his wife went, just the two of them, on a picnic, and black-haired, sparkling-eyed Edith, who was a talented singer, danced and sang for Tolkien in a hemlock grove. That was the inspiration for the story of Beren and Luthien, which was the first of his tales in The Silmarillion, and the work that began the creation of Middle-earth. At his wife’s death over 50 years later, he had the name “Luthien” added to her tombstone, and the name “Beren” was added to his tombstone on his death just 2 years later. 💕\n\nThis image of the other-worldly, dancing/singing, sprite-like female character shows up several times in Tolkien’s storytelling:\n\nLuthien (Elven princess) is dancing and singing in the woods when she is met by Beren (Man prince)\n\nArwen (Elf) and Aragorn (Man) — both descendants of Luthien and Beren -- in the Appendix at the end of The Return of the King, we can read about how Aragorn hears Arwen singing in the woods of Rivendell, meets her and calls her \"Tinuviel\" (nightingale) like Beren did with Luthien\n\nGoldberry — seeing her dancing on a hill is one of their very last sights of her, as the Hobbits go to say farewell\n\nAnd in Tolkien's short story “Smith of Wooton Major\", a human traveler into the realm of Faerie meets the Queen of Faerie as she is singing and dancing on a green spring-time hilltop\n\n_______________________\n\nchap. 12: “Flight to the Ford”\n\nCharater development\n\nQuests have a way of bringing forth virtues or qualities that previous were dormant: Sam, already stepping up to the plate as a loyal servant and guard, after having just encountered true evil (Frodo attached by the Black Riders), and now because Aragorn left so quickly after the Black Riders, that Sam “... plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider… [Aragorn] returned, appearing suddenly out of the shadows. They started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo…”\n\n__________\n\nHands of Healing\n\nAragorn and healing comes into play again later in the trilogy... Here, the first thing Aragorn does before treating Frodo’s wound is to first neutralize or counter the evil words on the Morgul blade through singing, and then he speaks words [prayer? blessing?] over Frodo:\n\n“…taking the dagger-hilt laid it on his knees, and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue. Then setting it aside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch…”\n\n__________\n\nTrolls!! 😉\n\nLOVE the “forgetting our family history” — Bilbo’s long (nearly 80 years) ago encounter with trolls in The Hobbit shows up here with his relatives! And the scene lightens the mood a little:\n\n\"Strider walked forward unconcernedly. 'Get up, old stone!' he said, and broke his stick upon the stooping troll.\"\n\n[Strider]: “You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew about trolls... It is broad daylight with a bright sun, and yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for us in this glade! In any case you might have noticed that one of them has an old bird's nest behind his ear. That would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll!” 😂\n\n\"Frodo felt his spirits reviving: the reminder of Bilbo's first successful adventure was heartening...They... took their mid-day meal right under the shadow of the trolls' large legs.\"\n\nSam’s comic troll song, about a character named Tom who ends up “lasting lame” from kicking the troll in his stony butt — ’Well, that's a warning to us all!' laughed Merry. 'It is as well you used a stick [to hit the stone troll], and not your hand, Strider!'\" 😂\n\n__________\n\nForeshadowing… ??!!\n\nWhen it comes out that Sam himself created the comic troll song -- he's a poet, too! 😄 -- and that leads to this rather prescient exchange:\n\n[Pippin]: ‘Where did you come by that, Sam? ... I've never heard those words before.\"\n\nSam muttered something inaudible.\n\n[Frodo]: \"It's out of his own head, of course... I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this journey. First he was a conspirator, now he's a jester. He'll end up by becoming a wizard—or a warrior!'\n\n[Sam]: \"I hope not... 'I don't want to be neither!\"\n\n__________\n\nBook vs. Movie version...\n\nWhile there are MANY things about all 3 of The Lord of the Rings movies that anger me and drive me crazy 😡, the streamlining of the book in the Fellowship of the Ring film in two places worked very well to make the film a stronger movie. The first is the cutting of chapters 6-8 (Old Forest, Tom Bombadil & Goldberry, and the Barrow-Downs/Wights) -- sad to lose these parts, but they are a big rabbit-trail off of the main plot, which movies do NOT do well with. And the second is the blending all of the Elf-lord Glorfindel's parts into the character of Arwen. Not only does that streamline by removing a character that we don't really see much of again after this (thus reducing confusion), this also simultaneously strengthens the character of Arwen, who has very little to develop her character in the books. (There is a bit more with Arwen and Aragorn in the Appendix at the end of The Return of the King.)\n\nEdited June 3, 2020 by Lori D."
