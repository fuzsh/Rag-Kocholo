Not having television means I miss out on many of the gorgeous adaptations that the BBC features. Thank goodness I have a public library that is well-stocked in DVD classics. Lorna Doone is one such classic I have yet to read, but fully intend to do so after watching this stunning romantic adventure film. I had not realized the film was over two hours long, and I remained rooted to my laptop screen the entire time. I did not expect such a magnificent film. What could have been a predictable Romeo and Juliet tale had enough twists to make it plausible and more than satisfactory.

While the other reviews speak to the plot and applaud the fine acting, I would like to address the authenticity and rapport. There was trueness to the actors, as if they had become the characters. The Ridd family truly seemed to care for another, and displayed genuine family dynamics. The only actors I recognized were Martin Clune who did such an unforgettable portrayal as Mr. Chips, and then there was the soldier who was Mr. Tumnus from Narnia. The principal actors were unknowns to me. Lorna did carry a regal air about her, even when she was thought to be a Doone and not a Lady. John Ridd had the earthy, honest nature of a farmer who had the soul of a poet. The mother was excellent in her ability to see past opinion and look into her children's hearts. I properly loathed the villainous Carver. Slimy and psychopathic, and terribly pathetic, right up to the end.

I can't wait to read the book, because it's rare to find that a movie is better than its written counterpart. This might be the exception...
