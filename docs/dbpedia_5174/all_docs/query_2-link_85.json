        "text": "Part of a series of articles on Connolly: workersliberty.org/connolly\n\nBy Emil Vandervelde\n\nThis article by the Belgian socialist Emil Vandervelde, printed by De Leon in the Weekly People, started the controversy, together with the People’s promotion of German Marxist August Bebel’s book Woman And Socialism.\n\nIn the United States, where religion is a private matter, an affair of conscience, where no religious sect dominates, or pretends to dominate others, it must be difficult indeed to realise the bitterness of the contest that rages in most of the countries of Western Europe between the Roman Catholic Church and its opponents. It is not alone in France that this contest grows in intensity.\n\nDuring the last few years throughout Western Europe there has been a marked reaction toward clericalism. The Catholics have organised themselves into powerful and well-disciplined parties. The covert authority of the convents which had been abolished by the Revolution has been developed under new forms, and religious associations have attained a greater control over education, while the political influence of the Church since the beginning of the pontificate of Leo XIII has made itself felt on all sides.\n\nIn our little Belgium the Conservative party, made up in large part of the supporters of the Church, has been a power for the last nineteen years. In the Netherlands the majority in the States-General (the two legislative houses) belongs to a truly extraordinary coalition of Catholics and Protestants — of disciples of Loyola and of Calvin. In Germany the Centre (the Catholic section of the Reichstag), though it declines in influence among the working class, appears more and more the hub of the Government majority, Protestant Conservatives pay their court to it; while the Lutheran Emperor betakes himself to Rome to bow before the Pope. In England, where frequent conversions to Catholicism are loudly advertised and where the Established Church reveals a growing disposition to imitate the Roman Church, Mr. Balfour’s Ministry grants equal appropriations to all the religious sects in the Education bill and makes important concessions to Rome in order to conciliate the Irish Catholics.\n\nIn short, all the countries of Western Europe, in Germanic or Anglo-Saxon as well as in the Latin countries, clericalism gains, or at least seems to gain, ground. When in the minority its opposition becomes more aggressive; when in the majority, or holding the balance of power, its domination waxes heavier.\n\nBut, by a natural reaction, anti-clericalism, which had been relegated to the background on account of the pressure of socio-industrial issues, has again appeared, and is spreading in every direction. In France, in Italy, and even in Catholic Spain, the old cry of “A bas la calotte!” [priest’s skullcap] resounds on all sides. The veterans of former battles return to the ranks. The youth are divided again into Catholics and anti-Catholics.\n\nBut it would be an illusion to believe that nothing is changed, and that the reviving struggle between the clericals and the anti-clericals has the same meaning as had that of the epoch of Pius IX and his syllabus. First of all, it is clear that since the rise of Socialism the efforts of the Catholic Church are not directed against the same enemies as of old. From having defended the nobles and the kings of “l’Ancien Regime” against the liberal, republican, revolutionary middle class, it turns to-day to defend the middle class, which has become conservative, and even reactionary, against the assaults of the Socialist proletariat.\n\nFifty years ago Catholics denounced Liberalism as “a pest and a frenzy!” To-day clericals chant the Marseillaise, since it has become, through strange vicissitudes of things, the national hymn. Clericalism calls itself liberal when, as in France, it is the minority. It disdains, or, at most, uses the Liberals when, as in Belgium and Holland, it is in the majority. But always and everywhere it attacks Socialism, and by cunningly encouraging the fears which Socialism inspires in the classes which have property to lose, it succeeds in holding its old positions, and even advancing to further ones.\n\nIt would be a great mistake — and far-seeing Catholics have no illusions on this subject — to suppose that the present revival of clericalism means an awakening of religious faith, even among Catholics. Doubtless, a certain number of persons of conservative religious instincts, fearing the logical consequences of rationalism, return to the Church, and by interpreting symbolically the old articles of faith, construct a new creed, which contents them. But these are only superficial drifts; they are but eddies of the great tide that bears the people of Europe in a diametrically opposite direction.\n\nOne of the heads of the Belgian Catholic party, M. Woeste, acknowledged this in an article published some time ago. “The Roman Church in Europe may gain voters,” he says, “but it continues to lose souls”. Even in Belgium where the Church reigns through intermediaries; where the Government, in its complete subservience, chooses magistrates and functionaries, imposes a religious teaching in the schools and grants appropriations as authority and wealth command, there is no doubt that the masses reveal a growing disaffection to the ecclesiastical power.\n\nIt is an indubitable fact that, notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, Europe is decatholicising herself. One might even go further with safety and say that she is dechristianising herself. Slowly but surely, with the irresistible movement of a geological subsidence, faith is waning among the industrial workers, and even among the peasants. One can safely assert that about twenty years ago nearly every one held to some religious creed. Free-thinkers were few and to be found only in the middle class. Societies for promoting secular marriages and burials existed only in the larger cities. To-day we see them spreading and multiplying throughout the industrial centres, and wherever mining and manufacturing are carried on. In Belgium, in France, in Germany, the workmen who follow no particular creed number hundreds of thousands — yes, millions — and as their hopes of a heavenly kingdom dissolve other hopes assert themselves with a growing intensity. Wherever free-thought penetrates, Socialism enters also. We know, it is true, many workmen who become Socialists without relinquishing, or without totally abandoning, their religious convictions; but aside from yellows and blacklegs, acting solely from mercenary motives, we neither know nor can conceive of any freethinking workman who is not at the same time a Socialist.\n\nWhat wonder, then, that this conservative middle class, instinctively antagonistic to Socialism, should become more and more antagonistic to free thought! Just as the coming of spring in the mountains dissolves the glaciers and sends down floods of icy water, which cools the atmosphere of the lowlands, so under the sunshine of free thought the breaking up of the religious creeds of the proletariat chills the rationalistic tendencies of the middle class. Frightened by the socio-industrial consequences of free thought, an increasing section of the rich class leans toward the Church, and especially toward the Catholic Church, which is regarded by all as the strongest bulwark of the capitalists’ interest. The terror of revolutionary ideas drives this section to at least the pretence of believing; and sometimes, thanks to the efforts of the Jesuits, it succeeds in inculcating belief in its children.\n\nIt is thus that the apparent clerical reaction is explained. Far from its corresponding to general awakening of religious faith, it is, in fact, a corollary of the decline of faith among the masses. But it is, nevertheless, true that the alliance of priest and capitalist, the coalition of spiritual and temporal power, against Socialism and free thought, furnishes the conservative and reactionary parties with formidable means of action and constitutes the most redoubtable threat against the immediate future of European civilisation. Progressists have not only clericalism to fight, but also, under different forms and labels, militarism, protectionist imperialism, and, in most countries, a marked tendency on the part of the sovereigns to enlarge their personal power to the detriment of the sovereignty of the people.\n\nWhat else than proletarian power can we oppose to this reactionary power? Can we depend upon the middle class as a class, or on Liberalism as a party? Facts answer. In Belgium, in Holland, in Germany, the Liberals are terribly weakened; the fear of Socialism demoralises them. It is only too often that the reactionary majority in the election is due to their votes. In England the division and melting away of the Liberal opposition made possible the South African war, and rendered possible, if not probable, the success of Mr. Chamberlain’s fiscal plans.\n\nJustice forbids, however, to reproach English Liberalism as a body with the reactionary complaisance of the right wing. In France, too, there is a distinction to be made. The Republican middle class and the radical democracy do hesitate to accept the help of the Social Democracy in the fight against the Catholic Church by enrolling Millerand in the Ministry and electing Jaures Vice-President of the Chambers of Deputies.\n\nFrance\n\nBut we must not lose sight of the fact that France is, above all, a country of bourgeois and small landholders. The industrial centres are far apart, except in the territory bordering on the Belgian and German frontiers. The organisation of the working class is, therefore, comparatively weak. Socialism itself is often in France but the idealistic expression of an advanced radicalism. It thus seems natural enough that the middle class parties should not show it, but should be anticlerical rather than anti-Socialistic. But let industry develop on a large scale, let the antagonism of the classes accentuate itself, let the French proletariat strengthen and extend its organisation, and we shall see in France, as in the rest of Western Europe, the middle class facing about and asking pardon of the Church for the ills it has suffered through her.\n\nThus it is, in the Old World, that two gigantic coalitions are formed by the elimination of intermediaries — the Black International and the Red International. On the one hand are all those who hold that authority should descend from above and who find in the Catholic Church the most perfect expression of their ideal, the most inflexible guardian of their class privileges; on the other hand are those who insist that authority shall come from the people, and who, by the logic of circumstances, can found their hopes on nothing but Social Democracy.\n\nBetween these two extremes Protestantism hesitates and Liberalism shifts from place to place. One may see clearly the truth of the prediction that was made fifty years ago by the Catholic writer, Donose Cortes:\n\nThe Liberal school honours equally darkness and light. It has undertaken — extravagant and impossible undertakings — to govern without the people and without God. Its days are numbered. One sees already on the two opposite points of the horizon, the rising sun that proclaims God and the ominous cloud that announces the mad rage of the people. In the terrible day of battle, when the whole arena shall be filled with the Catholic and Socialist phalanxes, no one will know where to find the forces of liberalism.\n\nOne may welcome or deplore, the fact of this coming concentration of forces about the Catholic Church on the one side, the Social Democracy on the other. But none can deny that this concentration is inevitable, and that the future struggles will have to be fought out between these two armies. To those, therefore, who are interested in the social movement of Europe, we say: Observe, above all else, if you wish to consider only the essential factors, the political activities of the Roman Catholic Church and those of International Socialism.\n\n• Weekly People, 19 March 1904\n\nIntroduction\n\nBy Sean Matgamna\n\nThis is a “full-dress” rehearsal of Connolly arguing on religion, and for the monogamous form of marriage, sex and the family, against a Marxist, Daniel De Leon, and in the first part of Connolly’s life as a revolutionary militant. Connolly debated with De Leon on three subjects in 1904: on whether trade unions could make real wages rise, on the family, and on religion. He developed an important difference on the need for, nature and role of a revolutionary party, but he did not, as far as I know, explicitly argue on that with De Leon.\n\nTwo of the three subjects are dealt with here. The third, that trade unions can raise real wages, is no longer controversial in the labour movement, and is omitted here.\n\nIt is worth remembering the account of his thinking on these questions which Connolly gave to his Scottish De Leonite friend, John Carstairs Matheson, in a letter of 30 January 1908:\n\n“In reference to the question you ask about [an encyclical from the Pope about] Modernism. Theoretically it was not ex cathedra, therefore was not binding. For myself tho’ I have usually posed as a Catholic I have not gone to my duty for 15 years, and have not the slightest tincture of faith left. I only assumed the Catholic pose in order to query the raw freethinker whose ridiculous dogmatism did and does annoy me as much as the dogmatism of the Orthodox. In fact I respect the good Catholic more than the average freethinker”.\n\nConnolly’s defence\n\nBy James Connolly\n\nConnolly wrote a polemic, which we reprinted in Solidarity 624; Daniel De Leon, editor of the Socialist Labor Party’s Weekly People, responded, and went on to have Connolly “investigated” by the SLP. The following are the sections on marriage and the Church from Connolly’s “defence” in the “investigation”. The whole exchange is online at bit.ly/c-del.\n\nI stated that I believed in monogamic marriage and disagreed with Bebel who taught otherwise; also that I thought his book was too prurient to do good as a propagandist work, although there was valuable propagandist material in it. I repeat all that. Bebel not only unnecessarily introduces long drawn out tales of sexual excesses but often explicitly approves of them. It has been said that his work is based upon that of Morgan but the most delicate minded could read Morgan without a blush and the same cannot be said of Bebel. Thus on page 65 after telling of the brutal lusts and sexual outrages of the kings and knights of the Middle Ages he speaks of them approvingly as “a healthy sensualism, that sprung from a rugged and happy native disposition among the people.” A fine summing up of a period of unbridled lust and outrage! Healthy sensualism indeed; brutal animalism would be a better characterisation. On page 323, he says “The satisfaction of the sexual instinct is as much a private concern as the satisfaction of any other natural instinct.” This from the man whose book is supposed to be based upon that of Morgan, although Morgan expressly teaches that the satisfaction of the sexual instinct is a social act intimately related to and acting upon the economic conditions of society at large. On page 19 (Bebel) says: “If with monogamy paternity is often doubtful, it is impossible of proof with polygamy.” What does that mean? I do not know. I have read it backwards and forwards and up and down and diagonally. I have studied it when the sun was high in the heavens at noonday and have wrestled with it through the weary watches of the night and it seems to me that if it is not absolute indecency then it must be blithering idiocy. Why should polygamy make proof of paternity impossible? Or perhaps we will be told, that like the omission of an important negative from Vandervelde’s letter, this also is a typographical error. On page 37, Bebel says: “It is the custom in the Netherlands when the host has a dear guest that he lets his wife sleep with him on faith.” This is introduced out of all bearing to its intent, clarifies no obscure point and is told apropos of nothing in particular. It was probably some more “healthy sensualism.” I have used the word “pruriency,” let me make it stronger and say indecency, and explain what I mean by indecency in this respect. I consider that whosoever tells of the sexual act needlessly or in any other manner, but as a scientist would speak of his investigations or a surgeon of his operations, is acting indecently. Bebel declares openly and avowedly that under Socialism the modern monogamic marriage will collapse, and yet his work we are told is based upon that of Morgan, and Morgan declares as unreservedly his belief in the beauty and permanency of modern marriage. Let me quote Bebel, page 346, “Bourgeois marriage is the result of bourgeois property relations.” In future society there is nothing to bequeath. The modern form of marriage is thus devoid of foundation and collapses. He might as well say: “The concentrated tool of production is the result of bourgeois property relations; in future society these relations will have disappeared, therefore the concentrated tool of production will collapse.” Comrade De Leon also believes that the monogamic marriage will remain, yet he declares that the book he disagrees with is the best aimed shot at the existing social system. Either De Leon has not much faith in his own marksmanship or else he believes the best aimed shot is that which proceeds from correct premises to wrong conclusions.\n\nComrade De Leon says it was superfluous for the S.L.P. to vote upon the merits of this book, one of whose most important conclusions he himself rejects. But surely we all have a right to reject as well as De Leon. If it is permissible for De Leon to reject one conclusion drawn by Bebel, surely every other member of the party has the same right, and has even the right to accept the conclusions De Leon rejects. I personally reject every attempt, no matter by whom made, to identify Socialism with any theory of marriage or sexual relations. I believe that no matter what may have been the force which gave birth to any institution, its permanency will and must be tested not by its origin but by its adaptability to the institutions — the economic institutions, of the future.\n\nComing next to the question of religion. I must first correct a totally wrong impression which has been sedulously fostered by The People and by some correspondents. This is the impression that I have stated that the S.L.P. attacked theology or religion. One correspondent puts it bluntly that the question to discuss is not whether we should attack theology or not, but, he says, whether we do; Connolly, he adds, says we do. This I most emphatically deny. I never made any such statement and would be the first to contradict such a statement if made by others. What I did say and what I repeat, is that there is a tendency in the party to attack religion when Socialism is criticised by clerics. The mere fact that some correspondents have written to The People saying that we should attack theology proves my point as to the tendency.\n\nComrade Janke of Indianapolis, and Comrade Twomey of New York City say we should. Comrade De Leon says it is never done, and Comrade Janke says it is and should be done. Comrade Twomey says I am wrong and then quotes a number of instances in which he says it was done, and finds fault with De Leon for taking up a different attitude now. Both these comrades deny my case, and then proceed to prove it by their arguments. A little more reflection on the value of a word would save our comrades a lot of blunders. If I had said in 1898 that there was a tendency in the S.L.P. to play fast and loose with Socialist principles, our comrades would probably have said I was attacking the party and was telling a falsehood. Yet there was such a tendency, and it came to a head in the Kangaroo attempt to capture the party. To say that there is a tendency in the party to attack theology, as theology, is not declaring that the party does so, but that some of its members do, and the truth of that statement is by at least Comrades Janke, and Twomey volunteering themselves as “horrible examples” so to speak. As the three principal witnesses on my behalf I present Janke, Twomey and De Leon. In my second letter to The People — I mean the one Comrade De Leon thought the members could not be trusted to read — I quoted where some priest had fired off the usual foolishness about Socialism, and our comrade answered him by telling about Catholic belief in miracles. In the same letter I answered his question as to whether his attitude or the religion of Czolgosz and other anarchists was an attack upon theology by saying it certainly was, and faulty logic into the bargain, if not absolute misstatement. But as our comrade promises to lay all correspondence before the National Convention, I will not go more fully into it at this stage, except to say that the statement that I left all the questions unanswered was worthy of the spirit that inspired it.\n\nDe Leon\n\nI now propose to wind up my defence by quoting a few of the opinions expressed by De Leon in the past, and in the present. I propose to show you that he has completely changed front, and that the head and front of my offending is that I would not change with him. In other words, to use a classic expression which he would understand, I propose to appeal from Philip drunk to Philip sober.\n\nLet us take the Vandervelde article, but for which I may say my first article in this controversy would never have been written. In that article Vandervelde quotes a string of utterances against Socialism by leading Catholic writers, and in his reply to my article, De Leon asks me triumphantly: “What about the allegations of fact?” “If the allegations of fact are ‘absurd’ why not expose them by counter allegations so that the reader may verify the allegations on both sides, and see on what leg the ‘absurd’ boot lies”. Of course the thoughtful readers of The People were not taken in by such clap-trap as this; they realised that my allegations of “absurd” was applied not to the “fact”, but to the inference Vandervelde drew from the fact. The supporters of Capitalism and Socialism have both the same set of facts to go upon, but how opposing are the inferences drawn therefrom! The inference Vandervelde drew, and I characterised as absurd, was that the Catholic Church was a barrier to Socialism and should be fought as a church. De Leon champions that in his reply. But listen to him in The People, Saturday, April 26, 1902.\n\nThere is quite extensively a notion that the organised Catholic Church is a barrier to Socialism. The language of many a dignitary of the Catholic Church justifies, and the language of the Depews “The Catholic Church is the best police” tends to strengthen the notion. [Chauncey Depew was a US Republican politician]. Probably the attitude of the Catholic or clerical party in Belgium may be quoted as further confirmation. We hold otherwise. What is going on in Belgium is proof that the Catholic Church, much as it would like to, cannot for all times control the masses to their injury. The masses in Belgium now out on a general strike, and the many more in sympathy with them, have been brought up as Catholics, at least most of them. A time was when these clericals controlled all these people. Do they to-day? Obviously no priestly or other influence can for all times dominate the masses. The “police” upon which the Depews lean to scuttle Socialism will at the right moment be found by them a hollow reed to lean upon.\n\nThus you see that in 1902 our comrade ridiculed this very inference which he finds fault with me for styling absurd in 1904. That inference being that it is necessary to fight the Catholic Church as a church — the central idea of Vandervelde’s letter. Now, take up the article written in reply to mine [The People 9 April 1904] and see how our comrade describes theology.\n\nTheology or religion is a delicate and occult thing. No man of sense and surely no man of feeling will hit back at that tender vein.\n\nJudaism\n\nNow see how the editor of The People, July 5, 1903 treats that “tender vein.” He speaks of Judaism as “The idea of being a preselected and sole supporter of gods and their pursuivants,” and of Christanity he says, “Such a monstrous, preposterous conception as Gentile theology breeds ‘semitism’ as inevitably as cheese breeds maggots.” In other words for the purpose of scoring a point against your humble servant he describes as “delicate,” “occult” and “tender” that which he had previously branded as “monstrous” and “preposterous.” But listen further:\n\nThe whole Catholic hierarchy in chorus slandered the socialists as murderers of rulers, and disturbers of the State at the time of the Czolgosz affair. They never ‘hit back’ by citing a long list of murderers of rulers down to the present days, including Czolgosz himself, all of whom were Catholics, and by showing that their theory of society, terrestrial society ... was, under given conditions, a natural breeder of assassins of rulers as the long list showed.\n\nThis is definite enough. Here he states that the Catholic theory, that is to say the theory taught by the Catholic creed, of terrestrial society, breeds assassins. Now, take up The People of October 5, 1901 and in the Letter Box answer to ‘H.R.H.’, Providence, R.I., we read as follows: True enough Czolgosz was born and brought up a Catholic. You might go further. The last four political assassinations in Europe; that of the Austrian Empress by Lucini, that of President Carnot of France by Santos, that of King Humbert by Brescia, and that of the Spanish Prime Minister Canovas Del Castilio, by a fellow whose name now escapes us — all were committed by Roman Catholics. But not for that is there any reason to impute assassination by reason of them to the Roman Catholic Creed.\n\nLet not the immorality of false reasoning in which Archbishop Corrigan has set the pace to so many Catholic priests, by inducing them to commit the immoral act of imputing Czolgosz to Socialism, take you off your base.\n\nSo that in October 5, 1901 our comrade declares a man would be “off his base” if he attributed the acts of the assassins mentioned to their religion and in his lectures on Anarchism and Socialism he apparently goes off his base on that very point, and again on April 9, 1904. First, he said there was no reason to attribute these assassinations to Roman Catholic teaching, then he deliberatly attributes them to such teaching. I think such a change of mind as that justifies the charge of a ‘tendency’ to attack theology.\n\nNow try and reconcile these two opinions on Marriage. In the translation preface to Woman De Leon declares as already quoted : “Bebel’s work Woman is the best aimed shot at the existing social system, both strategically and tactically considered. The Woman Question is the weakest link in the capitalist mail.” Now listen to the “best shot”. “In future society there is nothing to bequeath, therefore the modern form of marriage is thus devoid of foundation and collapses,” page 346. In The Weekly People of June 22, 1901, I find this Letter Box answer to ‘F.H.’, Troy, N.Y.,\n\nIs it not queering Socialism to take the position that justifies the notion that the sexual or matrimonial question is a cardinal Socialist question, when in fact Socialism has nothing to do with it.\n\nHere we find that a work which declares that under Socialism the modern form of marriage will collapse, is styled in 1904, “the best aimed shot at the existing social system”, and this is written by the same man as he who in 1901 declared that Socialism has nothing to do with the sexual or marriage question...\n\nFinally here are my last words. I claim that the demand of the S.L.P. for absolute unity in all things essential can only be maintained when linked with absolute freedom of opinion on all things nonessential. And if I am asked how are we to know a non-essential principle, I reply that any principle which we would not feel it to be our duty as Socialists to establish by force of arms if necessary is nonessential. Such principles are those of theories of Marriage and Religion. On these, therefore, I claim the fullest and most absolute freedom of opinion."
