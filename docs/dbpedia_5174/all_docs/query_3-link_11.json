        "text": "It's probably a good idea to accept only one name from your user, and allow them a \"nickname\" or a \"public name\". That gives them the freedom to have a legal name, perhaps for mailing or billing, and a public-viewable name for interaction on your site.\n\nBeyond that, I don't think I would allow my users to have multiple names, unless my system required it. If I did, I'd split it up into two tables:\n\nUsers:\n\nuserid (ex: 1821)\n\nUserNames:\n\nuserid (ex: 1821)\n\nfirstName (ex: Jonathan)\n\nlastName (ex: Sampson)\n\nIn addition, you could add a field in the usernames table called 'isPrimary'. This would be a boolean value that will tell you which name to treat as the primary name for the user. This is similar to how wikipedia store a history of data/changes. They keep all, but mark which is \"active\", or in your case \"primary\".\n\nI agree with the first 3 posts on how to structure your schema.\n\nIn regards to the UI I would allow a field for the persons legal first,middle and lastname which should change very rarely.\n\nThen allow nickname(s) depending on your application requirements.\n\nHaving their full legal name can come in handy for billing/financial/HR situations too.\n\nYou could always make a AKA table, where you could have the prefer name to AKA name. So if someone uses the name Bill, you can always replace it with William.\n\nI have never personally used this concept for names, but I do support a project that does something similar with Movie Titles, which can varied for different countries."
