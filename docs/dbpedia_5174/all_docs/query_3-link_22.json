        "text": "Should an assumed name certificate be rejected if there is a certificate already on file for the same or a similar name?\n\nNo. Chapter 71 of the Texas Business & Commerce Code does not authorize rejection of an assumed name certificate on the basis of a name conflict. Therefore, there may be multiple assumed name certificates on file with the secretary of state for the exact same name. An assumed name certificate provides information about the underlying business's identity and location. It does not give the registrant any right to use the assumed name in a way that violates the law, infringes on the rightful use of the name by others, and it does not prevent anyone else from filing the same assumed name or using the name to form a new entity with the secretary of state. It is up to each business entity to protect its name and good will.\n\nMust an assumed name certificate have an original signature and be notarized?\n\nWhen filing with the secretary of state, you do not need to submit an assumed name certificate with an original signature. Faxed copies and photocopies of signed certificates are acceptable for filing. Assumed name certificates filed with the secretary of state do not need to be notarized. Form 503 (Word, PDF) may be used for purposes of filing with the secretary of state.\n\nCan I amend an assumed name certificate to change incorrect or dated information?\n\nNo. However, the law requires an assumed name registrant to file a new assumed name certificate when the information contained in the certificate is or becomes materially misleading. Certain events can cause the information in a certificate to become \"materially misleading.\" For example, a change in the registrant's name, address, or business structure would be considered a material change. If a material change has been made, a new assumed name certificate must be filed within 60 days. See Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code §71.152.\n\nHow often do I have to file an assumed name certificate?\n\nAn assumed name certificate must include a stated term or duration for the filing, which cannot exceed 10 years from the date of filing. The certificate expires at the end of the stated term or 10 years from the date of filing. If the registrant decides to continue using the same assumed name, a new assumed name certificate must be filed prior to the expiration of the current certificate.\n\nWhat if I am no longer using an assumed name for my business?\n\nIf you have filed an assumed name certificate with either the secretary of state or with a county clerk and you are no longer conducting business under that assumed name, you may file a statement of abandonment.\n\nThe statement of abandonment must include the following:\n\nThe assumed name which is being abandoned;\n\nThe offices with which the assumed name certificate was filed and the date of filing;\n\nThe office where the statement is being filed; and\n\nEach registrant’s name and residence or office address.\n\nThe secretary of state has a statement of abandonment form (Form 504 Word, PDF) that may be used to file an abandonment of an assumed name certificate recorded with the secretary of state. If you filed an assumed name certificate with the county clerk, and want to file an abandonment of the assumed name certificate, do not use Form 504. Different execution requirements apply when filing a statement of abandonment on the county level.\n\nFees\n\nThe secretary of state is required to collect $25 for each assumed name certificate and $10 for each statement of abandonment of an assumed name certificate filed with this office.\n\nAre there restrictions on the assumed names I can file?\n\nYes. An entity may not file an assumed name for its exact legal name because this does not meet the definition of an \"assumed name\" under Chapter 71 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code (B&CC). This is true for both domestic entities and foreign entities that are required to register with the secretary of state under a fictitious name.\n\nExample: If the legal name of your business is ABC, Inc:\n\nYou may not file an assumed name certificate for ABC, Inc.\n\nYou may file an assumed name certificate for ABC.\n\nYou may file an assumed name certificate for A.B.C., Inc.\n\nYou may file an assumed name certificate for Austin Boating Club.\n\nAn assumed name certificate is not required to include an organizational identifier such as Incorporated, Inc., LLC, Limited, etc.\n\nAdditionally, effective September 1, 2023, SB 1514 (PDF) (88th Reg., 2023) amended § 71.002(2) of the B&CC to confirm that a protected series of a series LLC does not have an assumed name if its name includes the name of the LLC which established the protected series.\n\nIf I have an assumed name on file, when/how can I use the assumed name?\n\nBy filing an assumed name certificate, you are notifying the public that a particular business entity intends to conduct business under a name other than its legal name. This means that generally an entity may advertise under the assumed name, use the assumed name on business cards and letterhead, etc. However, if you have a question regarding how to sign any contracts or legal documents, or other uses of the assumed name, you should consult with a private attorney. The secretary of state's office cannot offer advice on how any entity should use its assumed name.\n\nWhere do I file my assumed name certificate?\n\nRegardless of where in Texas you are using an assumed name, an assumed name certificate must be filed as follows:\n\nThe following types of persons are required to file an assumed name certificate with the county clerk in each county in which a business office is or will be maintained. If the person does not maintain a business office in Texas, then in each county in which the person conducts business.\n\nSole proprietorship\n\nGeneral partnership or joint venture\n\nEstates\n\nReal Estate Investment Trusts\n\nAny other type of business entity not included above or those listed below as filing with the secretary of state.\n\nPersons who file on the county level should contact the applicable county clerks’ offices for information on fees and on filing a certificate.\n\nThe following types of Texas or foreign business entities are required to file an assumed name certificate with the secretary of state.\n\nCorporations (for-profit, nonprofit and professional) or other incorporated entities\n\nLimited liability companies (including professional limited liability companies)\n\nLimited partnerships\n\nProfessional associations\n\nLimited liability partnerships\n\nForeign filing entities\n\nBusiness entities that file an assumed name certificate with the secretary of state are not required to file an assumed name certificate with the county clerk. House Bill 3609 (PDF), which became effective September 1, 2019, amended Chapter 71 of the Texas Business & Commerce Code to eliminate the county-level filing requirement for such entities.\n\nI filed an assumed name certificate, but another business is using a name that is similar/the same as mine. What should I do?\n\nYou should contact a private attorney about what steps can be taken to protect your business name and good will in commerce. Filing an assumed name does not give you any right to use the assumed name in a way that violates the law, including the laws of unfair competition, unfair trade practices, copyright, and trademark, and it does not prevent anyone else from filing the same assumed name or using the name to form a new entity. The secretary of state will file an assumed name certificate without determining what rights, if any, you have to use the name. Consequently, more than one person can have the same assumed name on file.\n\nI have a limited partnership (LP) that is registered as an LLLP. How does the partnership file an assumed name certificate with the Secretary of State?\n\nWhen a limited partnership (LP) that has registered as a limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) uses an assumed name in Texas, the partnership must file two assumed name certificates with the secretary of state. The LP must file a certificate, and a second certificate must be filed for the LLLP registration. See Form 503 (Word, PDF). The partnership must also file assumed name certificates at the county level. Tex. Bus. & Com. Code §§ 71.101, § 71.103(b)-(c).\n\nIf a protected series or registered series does business under a specific name, should an assumed name certificate be filed?\n\nMaybe. A protected series or registered series may transact business under an assumed name by filing an assumed name certificate in compliance with Chapter 71 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. If the name of each or any protected series does not include the full legal name of the \"parent\" LLC and the series is conducting business, then the “parent” LLC must file an assumed name certificate on behalf of the protected series. (See SB 1514 (PDF), effective 9/01/23). If a registered series conducts business under a name other than the name stated in its certificate of registered series, then the registered series must file an assumed name certificate for that name. A registered series is not required to file an assumed name certificate under the name of the registered series as stated in its certificate of registered series. (See SB 1523 (PDF), effective 6/01/22). If you need to file an assumed name associated with a protected or registered series, please contact us for assistance."
