        "text": "What about making batches of certificates with multiple names in one go? Certificate generators make it easy (if you have the right tools in your hands).\n\nIn today's article, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide and describe how to automatically insert names in certificates with such tools as Certifier, Microsoft Word, Photoshop, Canva, and Google Slides.\n\nHere we go!\n\nCertifier is a professional certificate maker, and with its help, you will be able to craft, manage, send, share, and verify your online certificates in bulk. But what’s most important today is that you will finally be able to generate dozens of certificates with different names without manually filling them.\n\nManaging the certificate configuration and distribution process is a breeze with Certifier – a comprehensive credential management system that offers the ability to generate different credentials with various names. This process is simple, as you basically need to:\n\nadd dynamic attributes to your certificate design\n\nupload a spreadsheet with recipients’ data (for example, in XLSX, XLS, or CSV file)\n\ngenerate and send PDF certificates to all recipients in seconds\n\nNow, let's get into the details.\n\nStep 1: Prepare the certificate template\n\nSign up to Certifier (it’s free!) and head to the Designs tab.\n\nClick the “Create Design” button and choose the template. Add dynamic attributes to your certificate design.\n\nThe dynamic attributes are the elements that automatically insert names on certificates according to the recipient's data, such as the certificate ID or the recipient's name. Thanks to that, Certifier will automatically generate certificates without your manual work. You can choose from default attributes or create custom ones.\n\nAdd and remove certificate elements with editing tools. Customize the template however you want to.\n\nStep 2: Upload the recipients' data\n\nIf your certificate design is ready, you should now create a new course group in Certifier by going to the Groups tab and then clicking the “Create Group” button. Add all the necessary info and choose the certificate design that you want to generate multiple names on.\n\nAt this point, we will upload a list of participants in CSV, XLSX, or XLS file format. Go to the Credentials tab and click the “Issue Certificates or Badges” button. Verify that the data are accurate.\n\nYou can make such a certificate list yourself or generate it automatically by exporting the audience’s data directly from, for example, a webinar platform. Make sure you have all the necessary information so they can be uploaded correctly.\n\nStep 3: Make multiple certificates with different names and send them out\n\nIf finished, you can now choose the list of recipients and click the “Publish” button to send them out. You can also export the documents to PDF files and print certificates out. It’s your choice!\n\nThis is all it takes. By using these steps, everything is organized.\n\nAnd the features? Well, there are a bunch of them, both basic and advanced certificate options. This tool will allow you to build amazing awards thanks to, among other things, customizable and dynamic attributes, custom branding, multiple fonts, etc.\n\nDo you want to see the whole process in detail? Check this video on how to make multiple certificates with different names:\n\nMicrosoft Word is not a professional generator like Certifier, but it also has some auto-generation tools. See how to make multiple certificates with different names in Word.\n\nBut first, you need to design your beautiful certificate. You can do it manually with Microsoft Word tools or with a template – you can find manyfree Microsoft Word certificate templates. Once the design is ready, it's time to upload the certificate list automatically.\n\nStep 1: To do this, you will also need a list with your participants' data, such as one prepared in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. Save it in a convenient place, such as on your desktop.\n\nStep 2: In Microsoft Word, go to Menu, Mailings, and then Select Recipients and Use your existing certificate list. Next, find the saved list in Excel and click Open.\n\nStep 3: Highlight the place on the certificate where you want the names of the participants to appear.\n\nStep 4: Then go to Menu, Mailings, Insert Merge and select the file with participant data. The participants' names should now be uploaded to the future certificate.\n\nStep 5: If everything is correct, go to Menu, Mailings and click Finish & merge, Edit individual certificate documents, Merge all records, and save.\n\nThis way of generating multiple awards with different recipient data may not be very intuitive, but it works.\n\nYou can also create a batch of certificates in Photoshop from Adobe company. It has many supporters, but unfortunately, it is among the more expensive tools. It has very advanced design features, although, remember, it is not typical software for creating personalized certificates.\n\nThis tool may seem too challenging to use, but that doesn't have to be true. Let's see how to generate credentials with different names in this program.\n\nWe won't tell you today how to create a credential from scratch in Photoshop or what certificate templates to use, but you have a lot of possibilities with this tool. Instead, we will cover how you can quickly add the names of course participants to multiple documents.\n\nStep 1: Well, once again, you will need a ready-made list of participants made in Excel or Google Sheets. Save it in a visible place.\n\nStep 2: In your project in Photoshop, select the layer on which you will work. The names of the participants will be loaded into it.\n\nStep 3: Go to Menu, Image, select Variables, and then the Define option. Then, select Text replacement and click Next.\n\nStep 4: Now click Import, find the previously saved certificate list of participants, confirm your activities, and confirm again.\n\nStep 5: Now go to Menu, choose File, go to Export and select Data sets as Files. Choose the folder on your computer where the saved files will go and confirm. A message will appear asking for permission to make changes – select Apply to all, and then click Replace.\n\nStep 6: Next, go to Menu, File, Scripts, and select Image processor. The option that interests you is Select the images to process. Click Select folder and indicate the place on your computer where you want to save the images. Also, click below Select in the same location, and Save as JPEG options below. Confirm.\n\nThis way, you will have certificates saved in PSD and JPG form. And that's how the whole process goes – it's not very difficult, although it will be helpful for you to practice a bit to memorize it.\n\nYou can also consider the Canva program for generating multiple personalized certificates, but here you will go a little slower. Canva’s free pricing plan does not give you the possibility to upload a ready-made list of participants. Therefore, you will have to duplicate your credentials. If you need a few documents, this solution may pass. But if you need hundreds of files, this is not a good option.\n\nOne way or another, here’s how to make multiple certificates with different names in Canva.\n\nCanva also has a lot of design options, templates, and elements that are ready to use. Once you're done with your design, it's time to customize the participants’ names. To do this:\n\nStep 1: Complete the first name on the certificate. Once you do that, click above the top right corner of the design, and find Copy page symbol, which duplicates the design.\n\nStep 2: A duplicate certificate is shown under the output project. Now manually change the name in this document.\n\nStep 3: Repeat this action as many times as you need, and your work is done.\n\nOur last suggestion for generating multiple documents with individualized certificate names is similar in scheme to Canva. We are talking about Google Slides and the fact that you can also duplicate a project many times in this system.\n\nAlthough Google Slides has fewer capabilities than Certifier, Canva, or Photoshop, it is also suitable for designing diplomas.\n\nAfter you finish designing, customize the names of your participants. How? Let’s see.\n\nStep 1: First, design the appearance of the future certificate. If it is ready, still enter the name of the first participant.\n\nStep 2: Thanks to the previous step, you can now duplicate the prepared slide. To do this, right-click on the slide and click Duplicate slide.\n\nStep 3: A new slide will appear, which will look identical to the first one. Change the name of the participant manually - just like in Canva, as many times as you need, and you're done.\n\nThese are all our suggestions. Each of them speeds up your work in some way - some more, some less, so make a wise choice.\n\nSo, as you can see, there is a difference between auto-filling names in personalized certificates and doing it manually, as in Google Slides. You, however, don't have to worry about that because you have Certifier, which was specifically created as an automation tool for this type of task. It is intuitive, uncomplicated, and suitable for everyone, even individuals.\n\nTo create a bulk of certificates, choose our program. Visit Certifier for more information and create free account!"
