        "text": "Hello.\n\nI consider myself a heavy music listener and I remember most of the songs I like and keep a big playlist with an history of all the music I like on the platform.\n\nToday I was going through my Discover Weekly playlist and I started listening to a song that I knew the lyrics for and I absolutely had heard it plenty of times before. However when looking at the name of the song, artist and cover (Witnesses by Genesis Sparta) I couldn't recognize any of them, which is very strange.\n\nI then tried to identify the song using Shazam and guess what, Shazam identified the song as being another one: Nature Purple by Sensitive Kratos. I again have never seen the cover of this song or heard about its name or artist.\n\nI went ahead and played the song identified and guess what, it is exactly the same as the one on my Discover Weekly playlist. It even has the exact same length, 2:22 minutes.\n\nI checked both artists and both only have one song, released 1 Sep 2019. I googled them and the internet doesn't seem to know anything about them.\n\nI am 100% sure I didn't hear this song first from one of these artists or with any of these names so there are already at least 3 copies of the same song on the platform (I couldn't find the other in my history playlist yet). Is this some form of spam? Can someone look into it?\n\nSolved! Go to Solution.\n\nI am experiencing the same issue.\n\nI am using Spotify MOSTLY due to amazing Discover Weekly feature. However the last few lists were literally spammed by fake songs. These are very similar songs, which last about 0:58, and the author is a fake person, having 3 similar songs, with no description. I will give you a few examples from my current Discover Weekly, but if you would check my account you would find at least 20 such songs which I am constantly marking as: \"I don't like it\" but they are comming back.\n\nI am convinced that some BOT is spamming your service. I guess there is a lot of similar songs created from some fake accounts.\n\nPlease get rid of this.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/7fypZUaroLTSRzmZJ8R1kY?si=0bdbe0e667b84d92\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/4fWw4zKbNFjb0vhuI42l46?si=aebfb2705d134294\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/5Vl96agC8vtDQk1QXecUT5?si=fe2d501c43bf4d60\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/378qztzIfoAegucMs0VW5L?si=2fb8065e12434673\n\nFor several weeks if not even months I am getting the same song with different titles and from different artists into my Discoer Weekly playlist. The dislike button does not seem to have any function. Neither for these songs, nor for the playlist in general since the same songs and songs of other genres that I don't want to hear re-appear over and over.\n\nThe following songs appeared in my Discover Weekly. Sometimes even multiple of them. Some of the linked songs are just some sort of variations but one can clearly hear the similarity. Heck, even the \"song radio\" algorithm knows, that these songs are similar ...\n\nThis is obviously just some scheme to generate revenue by flooding Spotify with the same low-effort song.\n\nAm I the only one who has noticed that? Why is this still a thing after several months?\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/4bITGAOvG6yZM5U6absNGN\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/1IB39bZLNFef6JN5l1eTOL\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/1IB39bZLNFef6JN5l1eTOL\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/63mq6HKwoHotk030xFPTfq\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/5XB7HBvQD07urrMMrD0A1u\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/2ovHKYFW6ADUARTA1NFTwE\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/5dJS1221AhAkuZoIi5ehs1\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/1QSyZMDBbO9huegoZ3sVVm\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/3Pj8CqbpujMeFegYiCNZ5U\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/2vjwczm60mXUG2NcI1xoEJ\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/4lwas7n37esIrAcg1BrPXL\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/5dJS1221AhAkuZoIi5ehs1\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/0erFtU1TinR9nw9jCefBoH\n\n- https://open.spotify.com/track/3Pj8CqbpujMeFegYiCNZ5U"
