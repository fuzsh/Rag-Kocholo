        "text": "Ok... so I just got the question of the day...maybe not. But I've never heard of this before... I just got a clearance letter for a 510k submission. Can I sell the same device under 2 different names in the U.S? And... Do I need to file a traditional 510k for a different company for the same device that I just got cleared under a different name with my device as the predicate even though it's actually the same product (and not another predicate)? I know it's confusing but here's some background... My company wants to sell device \"123\" under the conditions to which it was cleared. But they also want to sell the exact same device, under a different name, \"456\". So the only difference would be the name on the label. Same indications, same technology, exactly the same device, packaging, everything... except the name. On the other question, this other company wants us to file a 510k for them for (again) the exact same device, same indication, same intended use, same everything; but under their labelPlease HELP!!!! Thank you all.\n\nYou can market a device under any name you want, or multiple names, as long as the indications for use are correct and complete.\n\nHas the other company that wants to sell the same device considered selling it as a Distributor? In the US, the label would say \"Manufactured for (XX Company)\", and wouldn't need to mention your company as the actual manufacturer. That's the common approach to avoid getting multiple 510(k)s for the same product.\n\nSo, just to clarify... I wouldn't have to file another 510k to add another name to it, right?\n\nAs far as the other company... I'm not sure why, but they want their own 510(k). From what I know, the manufacturer that owns the 510k also owns the design, so how can we keep proprietary information confidential if the other company will own the design?\n\nSo, just to clarify... I wouldn't have to file another 510k to add another name to it, right?\n\nAssuming that indications for use aren't changing, a marketing-name change (or addition) is not significant.\n\nAs far as the other company... I'm not sure why, but they want their own 510(k). From what I know, the manufacturer that owns the 510k also owns the design, so how can we keep proprietary information confidential if the other company will own the design?\n\nIn the general case, you can't.\n\nIn the general case, two-510(k)s-on-the-same-product makes neither regulatory nor business sense.\n\nBut if they insist, and you don't mind providing them with technical information, you could make the product for them as a contract manufacturer. They then would file for their own 510(k), as the Manufacturer of their version of the product. Their 510(k) would cite your product name-version as their predicate.\n\nI just got off the phone with the FDA and they informed me that I cannot market the same device under 2 different names. They told me if I want to market under 2 different names, those would be 2 distinct devices and therefore I'd have to file a traditional 510(k) for the \"new\" device name. I talked to 2 different people and got the same information.\n\nI know of probably hundreds of examples of just that practice in the current marketplace.\n\nIt's very common for a device maker to sell a given device to multiple private label distributors, each of which markets it under their own device name.\n\nIt's also very common for a given company to sell a device as (for instance) XXX to cath labs, and YYY to electrophysiology suites. In this hypothetical case, of course, each marketing application would be within the device's total range of intended uses. The customer-specific marketing, though, would be tailored to emphasize each user-type's procedural practices and needs, so as to discuss benefits and clinical considerations that are of maximum interest to that user.\n\nWe, for instance, have certain product-group brands for patient positioning devices...one for diagnostic imaging, another for surgical and interventional. There's a lot of product overlap between those two brand lines, with individual products sold under two different names.\n\nOf course, our FDA product listing (in the internal database) includes all of our brands, in relation to our listing of manufactured product codes.\n\nPerhaps there is some difference between these commonplace situations and the specific language that you are using to the FDA in asking your question. I only know of your situation what you have posted in this thread. Maybe I'm not understanding your intent adequately.\n\nI understand those scenarios and I completely agree with you that in those cases it sounds very appropriate. I think the reason why we can't do it is because, in our case, this particular device, has only one intended use. The device is a topical adhesive for skin approximation of wounds of surgical or trauma nature, so it's not like we can market them for different groups, if you know what I mean. They didn't say that a private label manufacturer couldn't do it. They said we, as the legal manufacturer, can not sell the same device, with the same intended use and indication under our own label with 2 different names. Honestly, I have no idea what the heck kind of strategy my company's upper management is trying to accomplish with this, because it doesn't make any sense to me . But, I guess I just work here, so..."
