        "text": "Listen to this article\n\nDo you have a different name version on your passport, education degree, and other visa and legal documents?\n\nIf yes, then you can create a ‘One and Same Person Affidavit‘ and get it notarized to prove that all names belong to the same person.\n\nThis affidavit is also known as the ‘same name affidavit form’ and can be submitted for legal purposes such as immigration, Green card application, or PR for Australia, Canada, the UK, and other such countries.\n\nYou can either write this affidavit yourself or use an app to fill it out for you.\n\nAffidavit for Multiple Names on Different Documents\n\nOpen App in new Window\n\n#1 Enter your Details\n\nEnter your Primary name as per your current passport and then birth details.\n\nYou are also required to enter your current residential address. This address can be anywhere in the world irrespective of your birthplace or home country.\n\n#2 Enter Other Names\n\nYou can enter different versions of your name for yourself. This is the same as entering your alias name.\n\nMake sure that you do not make any mistakes in the name spelling as they will be written on the affidavit PDF.\n\nShould I consider Social media names as ‘Other Names’?\n\nA lot of people get confused with respect to choosing which names are considered other names especially when we use different alias names on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and others.\n\nThe rules for what is considered ‘other names’ vary by country and purpose. We suggest writing all the names that you think people (your friend circle and family) know you along with your social media names.\n\nExamples:\n\nIn the USA, it is expected and required by law that you consider all names like maiden name, social media names that people know you with, and names on all legal documents like passport, birth certificate, education documents, and others mentioned on this same name affidavit form.\n\nOther countries may have different requirements and may or may not require you to mention your name that you are not on any legal document.\n\nOur suggestion is to use all names if you are not sure about the actual requirement to make the document universally acceptable.\n\n#3 Enter Father’s Name\n\nThe last step in data entry is to fill in your father’s name. Once you are done, you can click the ‘validate and save’ button to check all your data.\n\nIf there are any errors, the app will automatically ask you to fix them.\n\nIf there are no errors, you can purchase (if applicable) the document and your affidavit will be sent to your registered email address within minutes.\n\nEmail with Affidavit\n\nNotary\n\nThe notary will be required from your local notary to make it a legally valid document. You must sign this affidavit in front of the notary.\n\nThe notary service may be known by a different name in your place of residence like ‘Justice of peace’ in Australia, ‘Commissioner of Oaths’ in England / Wales, etc.\n\nThere are options for online notaries as well in the USA where they connect and see you sign via video call. Not all states in the US accept online notaries though.\n\nExample:\n\nThe state of Texas in the USA allows online notaries while some counties in California accept documents notarized by online communication.\n\nPlease check with your local state/county law before getting online notary services:\n\nDocVerify\n\nNotarize\n\nNotaryCam\n\nPavaso\n\nSafedocs\n\nSIGNiX\n\nPhoto on Multiple Name Affidavit\n\nThe photo is not required but highly recommended to avoid forging documents.\n\nWe recommend pasting a passport-size photo (according to the passport photo rules) of your country of residence and then signing across the photo so that half of the signature appears on the affidavit.\n\nSample Same Name Affidavit\n\nThis is a sample affidavit that arrives by email.\n\nThe app automatically adds the most recent tried and tested legal language based on your country and state of residence. All such country and state-specific formats have not been shown here due to limited space.\n\nExample:\n\nThe same name affidavit in New York, US may have a slightly different language than the one created for a person living in Edinburg, UK.\n\nSimilarly, the language of the same name affidavit may be edited by the app based on the purpose of use like immigration or real estate purchase, or a civil/criminal court case proceeding.\n\nThe address on the final affidavit is also printed based on the residence address, and the address format requirements along with country-specific date formats.\n\nThe self-help app will always provide you with the most recent and updated PDF document that’s currently being accepted by your local government and the purpose.\n\nThe app provides LIVE text chat support in case you have questions and a full refund policy.\n\nCreate One and same Person Affidavit Online\n\nUse this affidavit sample to fill in your different name combinations on various documents to verify that they all belong to the same person.\n\nFAQ\n\nCreate One and same Person Affidavit Online"
