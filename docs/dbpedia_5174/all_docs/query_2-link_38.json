        "text": "Archives: News Stories\n\nFive Trinity students have been named recipients of the prestigious Maurice VanderVelde Junior Scholarship Awards for 2019-20. These scholarships support outstanding junior or senior students in collaborative research with a Trinity professor in their chosen disciplines. Serving as a colleague, not as a paid assistant, each Junior Scholar produces a scholarly product for publication or presentation.\n\nThe finalists for 2019-20 are:\n\nEmily Homman – Dr. Abbie Schrotenboer (Biology) – Tracking Water Quality from Smaller Streams to Urban Waterways\n\nLaura DeVries – Dr. Clay Carlson (Biology) – Gut Microbes and Brain Genes\n\nJames Beyer & Ross Barz – Dr. Michael Bosscher and Dr. Jon VanderWoude (Chemistry) – Fluorescent Protein Lanthanide Binding Affinity\n\n“These projects are important because they demonstrate student and professorial attention to their topics’ relevance in our time and place,” said Professor of Communication Arts Craig Mattson, Ph.D., co-director of the Honors Program. “Emily’s project, for example, along with James’s and Ross’s proposed research suggests a close attention to ecological concerns. Laura’s project builds on past VanderVelde scholars’ work as well as her own assiduous data-gathering with Dr. Carlson regarding deficits in microbiota.”\n\nSaid Assistant Professor of Sociology Lenore Knight Johnson, Ph.D., co-director of the Honors Program, “These scholars are ambitiously and realistically laying out projects that require their best efforts and their hard-won competencies as researchers. Their clear focus, their articulateness, and their commitment to collaborative research enact values deeply held in our community.”\n\nAs a community committed to scholarship, the VanderVelde Junior Scholars award helps make possible collaborative research between faculty and students that strengthens and extends our communal concentration on God’s word and God’s world.\n\nThe College is excited to announce new leadership in the Office of Alumni and Family Engagement and the Office of Admissions. After 16 years in the Admissions Department, most recently as Executive Director, Jeremy Klyn ’02 has been named Trinity’s new Director of Alumni and Family Engagement. With Klyn’s transition, Jeanine Mozie has been promoted to Director of Admissions.\n\n“We are fortunate to have these talented individuals who will help us increase enrollment, strengthen connections, continue to develop our systems, refine our message, and guide our staff,” said President Kurt D. Dykstra. “These are wonderful opportunities for Jeanine and Jeremy and this is great news for the Trinity community.”\n\nIn his new role, Klyn will serve as a key connector between alumni as well as families of current students regarding opportunities at Trinity, including the Troll Nation Network and Legacy Program.\n\nMozie, who joined Trinity in 2016 as an Admissions Representative, was most recently Director of Admissions Operations for the College. She also spent five years in Jos, Nigeria, as a guidance counselor and teacher for Hillcrest School. Mozie leads a talented Admissions team that is moving forward with significant momentum and an aggressive plan for the next year.\n\nTrinity is pleased to be recognized as a 2019-20 “College of Distinction.” The College was recognized for its exemplary commitment to the four distinctions identified by the Colleges of Distinction organization: engaged students; great teaching; vibrant community; and successful outcomes.\n\nTrinity was also recognized in several other areas, including: a Christian College of Distinction; Education College of Distinction; Business College of Distinction; and a Nursing College of Distinction.\n\nColleges of Distinction was founded on the premise that there are hundreds of remarkable colleges across the United States, each with a unique strength to offer the next generation of college-bound students.\n\nThe Athletics Department at Trinity Christian College has named Allie Paluchniak ’16 as the new head coach of the women’s and men’s golf programs. Paluchniak comes to Trinity from Wheaton College where she served as the head coach for the women’s golf team for the past two years while also providing coaching support to the men’s golf team and to the women’s basketball team.\n\n“We are elated to name Allie as the new coach for our golf program and also to welcome her back home,” stated Athletics Director Mark Hanna. “From her own experience as a former student-athlete and coach, Allie has a keen understanding of the unique life of an athlete. She has the leadership, character, and vision to grow our golf program and she will join a strong staff of coaches that are cultivating an environment where student-athletes flourish!”\n\nIn her two seasons as head women’s golf coach at Wheaton, Paluchniak led the Thunder to a top three conference finish and coached a conference medalist and two additional all-conference golfers. She handled all operational aspects of the program as well as hosted tournaments and events for the team.\n\nAccepting the coaching position at Trinity, Paluchniak is returning to her alma mater where she received her bachelor’s degree in exercise science in 2016 and was a student-athlete on the women’s basketball team for three seasons. After graduating, she completed a master’s degree in physical education and athletic administration from the University of Mary in Bismarck, ND while also serving as a graduate assistant for their women’s basketball program. In 2017, she was hired by Wheaton College to serve as their head women’s golf coach and assistant women’s basketball coach.\n\n“I am beyond excited to come back to coach at Trinity,” said Paluchniak. “I know first-hand what an incredible part of the college experience Trinity Athletics can play and I can’t wait to get started working with our athletes! The golf teams have great potential and I look forward to partnering with the athletes as they grow in their faith, on the golf course, and in the classroom.”\n\nIn addition to her head coaching responsibilities, Paluchniak will join the women’s basketball coaching staff as an assistant. As a basketball assistant coach at Wheaton, she helped the team to a conference championship title, two NCAA III Tournament bids, and a Top 25 ranking. At the University of Mary, a NCAA II member, she was a part of a program that posted a couple of Top 25 victories and advanced to their conference tournament.\n\nTrinity Christian College is looking forward to welcoming our incoming freshmen students and their families to Blueprints this weekend, June 21-22. Blueprints is a wonderful opportunity to meet other students, faculty, and staff. Incoming freshmen will experience campus life, sleep overnight in the residence halls, sign up for classes, and begin friendships with other new students that will last a lifetime.\n\nBlueprints gives our students a taste of all aspects of the college experience, and they can spend time arranging class schedules, meeting with faculty advisors, and enjoying the range of planned activities.\n\nHere’s the schedule of events:\n\nFRIDAY | June 21, 2019\n\n3:30 pm – 4:30 pm: Arrival and Check-In Jennie Huizenga Memorial Library\n\n2:00 pm – 5:00 pm: Financial Aid Office Open\n\n2:00 pm – 5:00 pm: Business Office Open\n\n3:30 pm – 5:00 pm: Trinity Bookstore Open\n\n3:30 pm – 5:45 pm: Drop in and Take ID Photo\n\n4:00pm – 5:20pm: Break-Out Sessions\n\nHow Do Financial Aid and Financing Work?\n\nHow Do I Study Abroad?\n\nI’m a Diversity Scholar: What Is My Role?\n\nMy First Class at Trinity: What Is Thrive?\n\nI’m Living in the Residence Halls: How Can I Live Well With Others?\n\nI’m a Commuter: What Do I Need to Know?\n\nWhat Is Chicago Semester?\n\nI’m Interested in the Honors Program: What Does that Mean?\n\nI’m Participating in the Bridge Program: What Does that Mean?\n\nWhat is Semester in Spain?\n\n4:45 pm – 5:45 pm: Chicago-Style Dinner\n\n6:00 pm – 6:30 pm: Opening Welcome\n\n6:30 pm – 7:00 pm: Parent Session\n\n6:30 pm – 7:00 pm: We are Trollnation (Students Only)\n\n7:00 pm – 7:30 pm: Doughnut Truck and Refreshments\n\n7:45 pm – 8:30 pm: Blueprints Praise\n\n8:30 pm – 11:00 pm: Late Night Events (Students Only)\n\nSATURDAY | June 22, 2019\n\n7:30 am – 8:20 am: Breakfast\n\n7:45 am – 8:30 am: Check-in for Saturday Arrivals\n\n8:30 am – 9:00 am: Academic Kick-Off\n\n9:00 am – 10:00 am: Academic Overview Sessions\n\n9:00 am – 1:00 pm: Financial Aid Office Open\n\n9:00 am – 1:00 pm: Trinity Bookstore Open\n\n10:00 am – 11:00 am: Drop in and Take ID Photo\n\n10:00 am – 10:50 am: All-Athlete Meeting\n\n11:00 am – 1:00 pm: One-on-One Advising and Registration\n\n11:00 am – 1:00 pm Play NAIA Eligibility Station\n\n11:00 am – 1:00 pm Registrar’s Office Drop-In\n\n11:00 am – 1:00 pm Study Abroad Drop-In\n\n10:00 am – 12:20 pm: Break-Out Sessions\n\nCounseling and Academic Support: What Services Are Available to Me?\n\nHow Do Financial Aid and Financing Work?\n\nI’m Living in the Residence Halls: How Can I Live Well With Others?\n\nImmunizations, Insurance, and Illinois: What Do I Need?\n\nMy First Class at Trinity: What Is Thrive?\n\nHow Do I Get a Job and Pay My Bills?\n\nHow Do I Stay on the “Right” Path?\n\nHow Do I Study Abroad?\n\nStudent Leadership, Internships, and Involvement: What Do Employers Want?\n\nWhat Should I Expect on Move-In Day?\n\nHow Do I Access My Student’s Information?\n\nHow Do I Get the Most Out of My Trinity Experience?\n\nI’m the First in My Family to Attend College: What Support is Available to Me?\n\n11:00 am – 1:00 pm: Model Suites Open House\n\n11:00 am – 1:00 pm: Taqueria Lunch\n\n1:00 pm – 1:30 pm: Closing Session and Farewell\n\n1:30 pm – 2:00 pm: ID Pick-Up\n\nLearn more about Blueprints here!\n\nTrinity’s entrepreneurial spirit can be found everywhere on campus, and it stretches far beyond Palos Heights. One example is the Innovation Club, which hosts meetings and events throughout the academic school year.\n\nThe Innovation Club wrapped up a busy year, according to co-president Haley Heeg ’20. That included a field trip to downtown Chicago on April 8. About 20 Trinity students toured 1871, the number-one university affiliated tech incubator in the world, where Trinity is a University Partner. The group also visited two other incubators, The Chicago Connectory and Relish Works.\n\nThe group on the field trip represented a variety of majors, which is a hallmark of Innovation Club, Heeg said. “We have people from all different types of programs, from computer science to nursing, along with business majors,” Heeg said.\n\nAbout 25-30 people typically participate in Innovation Club meetings, which are held twice a month in Fusion 59, Trinity’s on-campus innovation center.\n\nHeeg served as co-president with Josh York ’20, and the two plan to continue leading Innovation Club. They are already planning events for next year, Heeg said.\n\nThe Dean’s List is Trinity Christian College’s highest academic honor. Congratulations to all our traditional undergraduate students and adult programs students who met this distinction for the Spring 2019 semester.\n\nTraditional undergraduate students who attend Trinity full-time and earned a 3.5 grade point average earn this honor:\n\nMahlet Sirahbizu Akele\n\nAlexander Alcauter\n\nAaron Alderden\n\nChristine Arcos\n\nGraciela Armstrong\n\nKyli

Jeremy Klyn ‘02 has been named Director of Alumni and Family Engagement. He has worked at the College for the past 16 years, most recently serving as Executive Director of Admissions and Financial Aid.\n\n“It is hard to think of someone better suited to this role than Jeremy,” said President Kurt D. Dykstra. “This is a wonderful new challenge for Jeremy, wholeheartedly endorsed by the leadership of our Alumni Board, and great news for our ongoing efforts to better stay in touch with the more than 10,000 Trinity alumni.”\n\nIn this role, Klyn will serve as a key connector between our alumni as well as families of current students regarding opportunities at Trinity, including the Troll Nation Network and Legacy Program.\n\nA native of Oskaloosa, Iowa, Klyn graduated from Trinity in 2002 with degrees in theology and church/ministry leadership.\n\nCoyote Run Golf Course in Flossmoor, Ill., was the perfect setting for the Annual Alumni Golf Outing on June 1. The event raised $11,500 for the Alumni Excellence Scholarship Fund, which benefits the children of alumni.\n\n“We were blessed with a sunny, breezy day which created a great setting for good fellowship, a lot of fun on the course, and some great golf as well,” said Rick Van Dyken ‘83, Vice President for Advancement. “The Alumni Board was very helpful in raising significant scholarship support for Trinity students of alumni parents. The course was great, the food was delicious and the fellowship was fantastic. I hope we will get more alumni out next year to experience this great event.”\n\nFor Jeremy Klyn ‘02, the event marked the first time he attended the golf outing in his new role of Director of Alumni and Family Engagement. “While so many things have changed in our nearly 60 years of existence, the one constant has been the rich relationships that develop on campus and continue beyond graduation,” said Klyn, who recently transitioned from his previous position as the College’s Executive Director of Admissions. “The passion our alumni have for this place helps ensure that the next generation of Trolls can afford Trinity and leave this place ready to impact our world.”\n\nThanks to the generous support of event and hole sponsors, the funds raised by the outing will go directly to the Alumni Excellence Scholarship Fund.\n\nEvent Sponsors\n\nClarence Davids & Co.\n\nEvenhouse & Co., P.C.\n\nFutureCeuticals\n\nHomewood Disposal Service\n\nOzinga Bros, Inc.\n\nProven IT\n\nVan Drunen Farms\n\nHole Sponsors\n\nAspen Group\n\nColonial Chap\n\nEdward Jones\n\nIn His Image Prints\n\nLambert Kamp, CPA\n\nLegacy Insurance Group\n\nMedia Resources, Inc.\n\nMidwest Insurance\n\nPDJ Inc.
