But anyway, I feel more male sometimes, but not quite a man, and more female other days but not quite a girl.\n\nWhen I feel girly (biologically i am) everything is great, I like dress's and make up etc very stereotypical, and Tara (my original name) suits me and I like it alot, I'd be pretty devastated to not be Tara when I feel girly.\n\nBut when I feel masculine, I hate being referred too as she, and wearing girls clothes, I want to be referred to as he/him (or they is always ok) and be called Morgen, which to me, feels like it suits me in a masculine way (I know it's a unisex name, but it does not suit me as a girl). I don't know what to do. I've tried to be in the closet and just be Tara, but I realise I can't be happy when I'm not being me, so I need to just be me, whatever that is that day.\n\nCan I have 2 names? is that 'allowed'? Will people be able to 'get' that or should I just go with Morgen all the time as it's more unisex, or Tara, as that's what everyone calls me already?\n\nIf people knew I was gender-fluid(ish), would I be ok with Tara, so long as I knew they saw me as a guy when I feel more like one? Has anyone tried 2 names, or anyone gender-fluid going by one name?\n\nAlso I know Morgen and Tara are very different names, maybe more similar names would be better for people, but I just can't find a name I like as much as Morgen, and as I said when I'm a girl I love being Tara.\n\nI use my birthname at work and for official stuff. I chose my own name to use with friends and wherever I want to be more open.\n\nIt definitely could help to simply come out as genderfluid (it definitely sounds like genderfluid to me). Maybe it's sufficient that people see you as whatever your current gender is, without a different name to go by. The strangest things can give validation, and everyone is different.\n\nI change more or less on the spectrum of male and agender (over-simplified) and never want to be gendered or labeled as male (or female obvs). The fact that people don't use gendered language for me is really important to me. And maybe having people use whatever gendered terms apply to you at the time, would really help your dysporia. Maybe that's all the validation you need. So I'd suggest you try this out?"
