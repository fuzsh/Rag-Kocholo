        "text": "Promising Practices for Collecting and Managing Names, Gender, Pronouns, Honorifics, and Sexual Identities\n\nThis resource page was developed by the Gender and Sexuality Campus Center staff team at Michigan State University and is intended to provide information for LGBTQIA2S+ inclusive practices to campus partners. These recommendations are based in current and emerging better practices in the field of LGBTQIA2S+ inclusion.\n\nName\n\nA name is a person’s chosen form of address. A legal name is the name listed on a person’s legal documentation.\n\nTerms to avoid:\n\nPreferred name implies that a person’s name is optional.\n\nNickname implies that a person’s name is a casual substitute for their legal name.\n\nTerms to use:\n\nUse Name when asking for the name a person goes by. If it isn’t possible to use Name, consider using Chosen Name.\n\nUse Legal Name only when you need to use a person’s legal name. In most cases, you should be able to use Name\n\nNames for University Systems\n\nAllow students, faculty, and staff to select their name for internal university systems, regardless of its alignment with their legal name.\n\nName changes should not require legal documentation, such as a legal name change.\n\nName changes should be made upon request through one centralized process and shared across university systems.\n\nUpon entering a new name to university systems, the University should provide information to the user about where those changes will and will not be reflected.\n\nFor example, upon changing their name, a student should be notified that while the updated name will be used across university systems, the legal name will continue to be used when legally required.\n\nWhere not specifically prevented by law, use names, rather than legal names, in all contexts and university systems.\n\nNames for Surveys and Assessment\n\nAllow students, faculty, and staff to select their name, regardless of its conformation to their legal name.\n\nDo not collect data on legal names if that information is neither legally required nor relevant.\n\nRequesting name information\n\nWhen asking for a person’s name:\n\nFirst ask for their Name\n\nThen, only if you need this information and cannot access it another way, ask for their legal name. Do not ask for legal name if you do not need it.\n\nPossible models include:\n\nName: ______________________\n\nWhat is your name? _______________\n\nName: _____________________\n\nLegal Name: _____________________\n\nName (if different from legal name): __________________\n\nLegal Name: ___________________\n\nGender\n\nGender is the socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, identities, and attributes that a given society deems masculine or feminine. For the purposes of this document, when we refer to gender we are focusing on gender identity, a person’s internal understanding of their gender and the language they use to describe this understanding. This is distinct from their sex.\n\nLegal gender refers to the gender marker on a person’s legal documents (such as birth certificate or personal identification). This is frequently, but not always, the same as their birth-assigned sex.\n\nBirth-assigned sex, legal gender, and gender are not interchangeable terms.\n\nTerms to avoid:\n\n“Preferred gender” implies that gender is a personal preference rather than an identity.\n\nMale and Female should not be used as gender terms; they refer to birth-assigned sex.\n\nTerms to use:\n\nUse gender when asking for a person’s gender. In most instances, you should prioritize gender over legal gender or birth-assigned sex.\n\nUse legal gender when asking for their legal gender marker, but only ask this if it is necessary. The University already captures the legal gender of staff, faculty, and students.\n\nUse birth-assigned sex when asking for the sex they were assigned at birth, but only ask this if it is necessary. In general, it is best to avoid asking this question.\n\nGender for University Systems\n\nAllow students, faculty, and staff to self-report gender(s) for internal campus records and University systems.\n\nWhen asking users to self-report their gender, include definitions (in writing or as hover-over text) of terms.\n\nChanges to gender should not require legal or medical documentation.\n\nChanges to gender should be made through one centralized request and shared across University systems.\n\nUpon entering new gender information to university systems, the University should provide information to the respondent about where those changes will and will not be reflected.\n\nFor example, on changing their gender with university systems, respondents should be notified that their legal gender will still be reported to the federal government.\n\nLegal gender information should only be visible to people for whom that information is legally required.\n\nBirth-assigned sex information should only be visible to people for whom that information is legally or medically required.\n\nIf you include the identity term “transgender,” you should also use the term “cisgender.”\n\nGender for Surveys and Assessment\n\nAllow students, faculty, and staff to self-report gender(s) for surveys.\n\nProvide people with a fill in the blank or an expansive list of genders to select from, including a fill-in-the-blank option and the opportunity to select more than one gender term.\n\nWhen providing a set list of gender terms to select from, include definitions (in writing or as hover-over text) of terms.\n\nIf you choose to include “Two-spirit” in your list of gender terms, please state the two-spirit identities are from native and indigenous communities and are an identity term that should only be claimed by native people.\n\nIn analyzing demographic data, gender should be prioritized over legal gender.\n\nFor example, in analyzing responses from women students in a departmental survey, we should isolate respondents who have listed their gender, not legal gender, as “woman.” Both Trans Women and Cisgender women would be considered “Women.”\n\nIf you do not plan to break out your data based on gender, do not ask for gender in your demographics section.\n\nDo not collect data on legal gender if that information is neither legally required nor relevant.\n\nAgain, if you include the identity term “transgender,” you should also use the term “cisgender.” Not including cisgender implies that cisgender identities are more real and valid than transgender identities.\n\nRequesting gender information\n\nWhen asking for gender:\n\nFirst, ask for their gender.\n\nWhen possible, use a text-limited box.\n\nIf you need to provide terms, please use the model below and allow people to select as many options as apply.\n\nThen, only if you need this information and cannot access it another way, ask for their legal gender. Do not ask for legal gender if you do not need it. Please remember the University already captures legal gender.\n\nPossible models for asking gender:\n\nWhat is your gender? _________________\n\nGender? _____________________\n\nGender: (Please select all that apply)\n\nwoman\n\nman\n\ncisgender\n\ntransgender\n\nnon-binary\n\ngenderqueer\n\ngender non-conforming\n\nagender\n\ntwo-spirit\n\nprefer not to specify\n\nenter your own: _____________________\n\nPossible models for asking legal gender\n\nLegal Gender: _________\n\nSelect your legal gender:\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\nX\n\nPronouns\n\nA pronoun is a word that refers to a person in place of their name.\n\nPronouns for University Systems\n\nAllow students, faculty, and staff to self-select the pronouns they use for themselves within campus records and university systems.\n\nChanges to pronouns should not require legal or medical documentation.\n\nChanges to pronouns should be made through one centralized request and shared across university systems.\n\nPronouns should appear on course and grade rosters and advisor lists and should be used in all contexts and university systems.\n\nPronouns should not be included in the campus online directory without the permission of the individual.\n\nPronouns for Surveys and Assessment\n\nDo not collect data on pronouns if that information is not relevant.\n\nRequesting Pronouns\n\nDo not ask for “preferred pronouns.”\n\nInstead, ask for “pronouns” or “personal gender pronouns.”\n\nPossible models for asking gender:\n\nWhat are your pronouns? (Please select all that apply)\n\nShe/her/hers\n\nHe/him/his\n\nThey/them/theirs\n\nEnter your own: __________________\n\nHonorifics/Salutations\n\nAn honorific or salutation is a title denoting respect and is sometimes aligned with a person’s gender. We will use the term honorific for the remainder of this section.\n\nDo not automatically populate an honorific for a person based on their gender identity. For example, if Jill (she/her/hers) has selected “woman” and “cisgender,” do not automatically assign “Ms.” to Jill. If Guillermo (they/them/theirs) has selected nonbinary, do not automatically assign “Mx.” to Guillermo. Allow Guillermo and Jill to select the honorific that best suits each of them.\n\nSee the appendix for examples of gender terms that may be used in university data collection.\n\nHonorifics for University Systems\n\nAllow students, faculty, and staff to select honorifics for internal campus records\n\nBecause some people do not feel comfortable being addressed with honorifics, provide them the option of using no honorifics.\n\nChanges to honorifics should be made through one centralized request and shared across University systems.\n\nRequesting honorific information\n\nDo not assume someone’s honorific based on their gender or pronouns.\n\nPossible models for asking honorifics:\n\nWhat is your honorific? __________\n\nWhat is your honorific?\n\nMs.\n\nMrs.\n\nMr.\n\nMx.\n\nDr.\n\nRev.\n\nEnter your own: ____________\n\nSexual Identity\n\nSexual Identity refers to the language a person uses to describe themself as a sexual being. This is the preferred term for sexual orientation. One’s sexual identity may or may not align with one’s sexual behavior or sexual attractions. Sexual identity is distinct from gender identity, and an individual may use multiple sexual identity terms in different contexts. If collecting demographic data on sexual identity, allow for multiple responses.\n\nRequesting sexual identity information\n\nPossible model for asking for sexual identity information:\n\nSexual Identity (select all that apply):\n\nAsexual\n\nBisexual\n\nDemisexual\n\nGay\n\nLesbian\n\nPansexual\n\nQueer\n\nQuestioning or unsure\n\nSame-gender loving\n\nStraight\n\nPrefer not to specify\n\nEnter your own: _________\n\nResources"
