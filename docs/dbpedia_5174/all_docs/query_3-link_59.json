        "text": "The first step in the name change process is filling out court forms.\n\nUse different instructions if you're changing your name as part of a divorce or to match your gender identity.\n\nThere are different steps to change your name to a former name as part of a divorce, or to change your name to match your gender identity.\n\nBefore you start\n\nYou need the name of a newspaper to publish your request in\n\nThe court requires you to publish your request in the notices section of a newspaper. If you live in California, you need the name of the newspaper where you plan to publish to complete these forms. You must publish in a newspaper of general circulation that publishes legal notices in the county where you file your case (the county where you live). Ask the court where you will file your case if they have a list of newspapers you can choose from.\n\nContact the newspapers to find out the cost. The cost to publish can vary a lot. Call several papers to find out the cost and what works best for you. If you change your mind later and want to change newspapers, you will have to re-do your forms and may need to postpone your court date.\n\nIf you live out of state, you have it published where you live. You will need to find out what newspapers qualify as a newspaper of general circulation that publishes legal notices where you live. But, you do not need to list the name of the paper on the form.\n\nHow to fill out forms to change your name\n\nFill out forms\n\nYou will need to fill out these forms:\n\nPetition for Change of Name (form NC-100)\n\nName and Information about the Person Whose Name is to be Changed (form NC-110) (and attach it to the NC-100)\n\nOrder to Show Cause—Change of Name (form NC-120)\n\nCivil Case Cover Sheet (form CM-010) (some courts do not require this form)\n\nDecree Changing Name Form (form NC-130) (fill out the boxes at the top and Item 3)\n\nIf you are changing your name and you're in the:\n\nState Witness Program, or\n\nSafe at Home address confidentiality program and are changing your name to avoid domestic violence, stalking, or human trafficking, or are a victim of sexual assault,\n\nthen, you can ask the court to keep your name change confidential. Talk to your Self-Help Center to find out options.\n\nHere are some instructions to ask for a confidential name change:\n\nInformation Sheet for Name Change Proceedings Under Address Confidentiality Program (Safe at Home) (form NC-400-INFO)\n\nIf you're worried about safety, there are people that can help you come up with a safety plan to keep you safe at home, work, school, other places that you go, and online. To learn more about creating a plan, go to the National Domestic Violence Hotline or call 1-800-799-SAFE.\n\nYou can download the forms or you can use an online program to fill them out.\n\nFill out forms online\n\nYou will need to pay a fee when you file the forms ($435 - $450).\n\nIf you can't afford the fee, fill out another form to ask for a fee waiver.\n\nFind out if you have any local forms to fill out\n\nSome courts also have local forms you have to use.\n\nContact your court clerk’s office, check your court’s website, or talk to your Self-Help Center to ask if they have any local forms you need to use. Your Self-Help Center may also be able to review your forms before you file them.\n\nMake Copies\n\nMake at least 2 copies of all of your forms. When you file them, the court will keep the original and return the copies to you, stamped.\n\nKeep one of the copies for yourself. The other copy is to publish the request in the newspaper.\n\nName change for an adult\n\nWhat's next?\n\nOnce you’ve completed the forms, you’ll file them with the court clerk.\n\nGo back to an overview\n\nReturn to an overview of the whole process for legally changing the name of an adult.\n\nSend this page to yourself\n\nGo to the next step\n\nGet step-by-step instructions for filing your forms with the court."
