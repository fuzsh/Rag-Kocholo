        "text": "Thank you!\n\nVersion 3, and your guidance helped me clean-up all of the messes from the past few years. Photos is definitely temperamental when it comes to assigning names to People. It did appear that, for me, the \"bad\" names no longer appeared as options in auto-fill once I corrected/removed all of them. I didn't reset, so I'm unsure if it really was removing them or not. Either way, I'm very happy and appreciate your taking time to help me.\n\nRelated question: Now that all the errors are corrected and my people only appear once in People, I do notice one thing: when I type in a person's name that exists in Photos already, I get 2 options to click. One is the name that correctly adds it to the main group for that person. The other has an email address appear below it, and if I select it then only the First Name of the person appears to be assigned to them. Since there is an email (their correct email per my Contacts), it appears that this 2nd photo is a lingering part of a feature in previous versions where we could basically connect a Contact record to a People record in Photos. Does this make sense? I don't seem to see any current application of that feature (as in, I can't find a method of intentionally connecting 2 such records together like we used to be able to do), so my guess is it is gone? I can definitely live without that feature if it's gone, but I did like to use it for my Contacts/People when we had it.\n\nThanks, again!"
