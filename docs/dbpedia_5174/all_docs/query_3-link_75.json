        "text": "A single company can operate under different names through the use of fictitious names. Whether you use a single fictitious name or dozens, as long as you remain a single company, you can use a single Employer Identification Number.\n\nHow is a Fictitious Name Different From a Legal Name?\n\nAs the term suggests, a fictitious name is a name you use to conduct business but is not the official, legal name of your company. A fictitious name is also referred to as an assumed name, trade name or DBA (for \"doing business as\"). According to Entrepreneur, fictitious names are extremely common in business. If they weren't available, then a person who owned three restaurants, for example, would have to either operate them all under the same name or set up a separate company for each restaurant. Even if a name is fictitious, it is a good idea to select names that are not in use by another business.\n\nHow to Register a Fictitious Business Name\n\nThe Small Business Association has a wide variety of useful tools for registering your fictitious business name. Registration will vary based on your locality and state. There are four primary ways to register a business name.\n\nEntity Name, this is the name of your business as it is registered with your state. Typically, you cannot select a name that is already in use within your state.\n\nTrademark, this entails registering your business name with the Trademark and Patent Office. It provided national recognition and protection for your business name.\n\nDBA, This is the name of your business as it is registered locally with your city, county or state. There is little protection offered, it simply allows you to operate locally under the DBA.\n\nDomain Name, this is your website address. It is a way to support your brand and protect your business name from being publicly used by someone else.\n\nHow to Obtain an Employee Identification Number\n\nAny company that is incorporated, has employees or meets certain other criteria set by the Internal Revenue Service must have an Employer Identification Number. An EIN identifies the company to the IRS in the same way a Social Security number identifies an individual. Even companies that aren't required to have an EIN can choose to get one. The IRS assigns these numbers based on the official legal name of a business – not whatever fictitious names it may be using. If you need an EIN name change, you will have to file the new name with the IRS.\n\nCan I Use Multiple Fictitious Business Names?\n\nA company can use a single EIN across multiple units with multiple fictitious names, as long as those units aren't set up as legally separate businesses. The IRS is concerned with the financial affairs of the overall company – the wages it pays its employees, the taxes it withholds from their wages and the taxes it pays on its own – not with whatever names it uses on the front of its store or on its business cards. You can have multiple DBA under one sole proprietorship, or multiple business names under one corporation.\n\nFictitious names are a state matter, not a federal issue; most states require businesses to register their DBAs so consumers, regulators and others can identify exactly who owns a business.\n\nWhen do I Need a New EIN?\n\nWhen a company changes its official name, it must update its information with the IRS, but it won't necessarily need a new EIN. A new EIN becomes necessary if the business is changing its organizational structure, such as a sole proprietorship becoming a corporation, and under certain other circumstances defined by the IRS. If a company opens new divisions, stores or branches, a new EIN generally isn't required. However, if it creates a subsidiary – a separate, legally distinct entity – then that subsidiary will need its own EIN, even if it's wholly owned by the parent company."
