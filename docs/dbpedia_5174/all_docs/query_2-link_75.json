        "text": "William (Bill) Clark was a Non-Traditional Student, who returned to school two decades after graduating High School. He received his BA in History at Texas State in December of 2014. He followed this by completing his Masters at University of Cambridge in England, completed in 2016. He accepted a position the Doctoral program at University of Missouri in 2017. His studies focused on early 19th century foreign relations and decolonization with an effort to recognize transnational influences between the Latin- and English-speaking Atlantic world of the period.\n\n“I remember coming back to school as a forty-year-old auto mechanic. I was terrified, and not even sure how to be a student. Texas State was the perfect place for me because it was so accessible, welcoming, and diverse. I left there with life-long skills, friends, and mentors. I feel really lucky that’s where I landed.”\n\nBill left the Doctoral program in 2019, after receiving an invitation to join the U.S. Foreign Service. He is now enjoying his second posting at the U.S. Embassy in Canberra, Australia. His first tour was Mission Mexico, during which he worked in Nuevo Laredo and Mexico City, as well as spending six weeks in El Salvador, helping with the Immigrant Visa crisis in 2021. He is nearing completion of his fifth year in the Foreign Service and looking forward to seeing where in the world he will end up next.\n\n“My wife and I are hoping to go to Chile or Argentina. It’s crazy and amazing to live such a fluid kind of life. I love my job. I love being able to live in and visit places that I’d never have imagined before going back to school. It’s never too late to reinvent yourself and your place in the world.”\n\nJames Bernsen always wanted to write history books, but he didn’t know how. Writing was never a problem for him as that’s what he did for a living. But he wondered how to research, document, and put it all together. He needed help. So, after serving as a military intelligence officer in Iraq in 2016, he used his GI Bill to get his master’s degree at Texas State.\n\nJames’ thesis, Origins and Motivations of the Gutiérrez-Magee Filibusters, focused on the joint Anglo-American and Mexican force that briefly liberated Texas from the Spanish Empire before being defeated at the Battle of Medina in August, 1813. As James started to delve into early 19th Century filibusters, it occurred to him that there were commonalities between them and modern insurgencies like those he had fought in the Middle East. This gave him a unique insight and clues into new ways to study them.\n\nIn his research, James placed particular focus on the individuals involved and the networks that connected them. By initially studying the trees and not the forest, he learned who these people were, what made them tick, and why they fought. Then when he did turn back to the forest and saw some glaring holes in the traditional accounts, he knew he had more than just a thesis.\n\nAfter graduation, James again deployed, this time to Afghanistan – and took his research with him on a hard drive. By day he wrote reports on the Taliban, by night, on the Republican Army. After returning, he spent the next year on the archival trail, and finished his book in 2021. The Lost War for Texas: Mexican Rebels, American Burrites and the Texas Revolution of 1811 (Texas A&M University Press, forthcoming), will shed much-needed new light on this fascinating story of what was truly Texas’ first revolution. James credits Texas State as an essential part in making this book a reality.\n\nAmy Bushong | History Department Graduate Student\n\nAmy Bushong is a third-year graduate student with Texas State’s History Department. A former dance teacher, Amy has let her past experiences fuel her current academic pursuits, exploring how popular media such as music and television reflect their historical time periods. Particular areas of interest include areas of pop culture that are seen as “uncool” or “not serious” and analyzing the ways that they are, in fact, very cool and extremely serious. The biggest influences on Amy’s academic interests at Texas State have been Dr. Mellard, Dr. Valencia-Garcia, and Dr. Bishop for their tireless passion and constant validation that listening to music and watching movies counts as historical research.\n\nAmy has written reviews for Texas Books Review, published by Texas State’s Center of the Study of the Southwest, winning the Free-Tailed Bat Award for her 2022 review on Marissa Moss’s debut book, Her Country. She also helped lead the coordination of the History Department’s first podcast, “For Example”, available for streaming on Spotify and YouTube. The current president of Phi Alpha Theta, Amy enjoys organizing events and creating a welcoming space for everyone to discuss their historical research.\n\nOutside of school, Amy spends her time dancing, running, and singing karaoke. Her favorite artists are Stevie Nicks and Billy Joel, and her favorite authors are Steven King and Sylvia Plath. When not analyzing the socio-political implications of Love Island, Amy loves to hang out with her friends, her husband, and her cat Winnifred.\n\nGabriel Odom is a History Graduate student who loves American Military History and specializes in the history of American foreign relations, generally focusing on the Cold War period. While he is still working out what he wants to research for his thesis, he’s certain that it will have something to do with American interventions abroad and grand strategy.\n\nGabriel was recently published by the Syria Studies Association on the Syria Crisis of 1957 and this summer is presenting at the Agricultural History Conference on Kennedy's decision to use herbicides in Vietnam. He has also presented work on the Korean DMZ Crisis and on the history of Anheuser-Busch in Texas.\n\nGabriel is a Kenneth and Patricia Margerison Graduate Research Fellowship which allows him to dedicate most of his time to his research.

Due to the value he places in education he decided to become a high school social studies teacher in the Houston area following his graduation. After teaching for a few years, Evan wanted to further pursue his own education and began considering graduate school. Evan had a wonderful experience with Texas State’s history department during his undergraduate program eventually earning a minor in history along with his bachelor’s degree. This experience, as well as the history department’s highly regarded reputation, motivated him to return to Texas State to pursue a graduate degree in History.\n\nEvan’s father is a union member and mother worked as a public educator. Their occupations and outlook influenced him to pursue a career in academia through studying U.S labor history. His primary focus is violence and repression in labor struggles during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era in the American West, specifically the Mountain States and Texas. Thus far in his time here he is confident that he made the right decision returning to Texas State instead of attending a different school because of the amazing faculty and staff of the department. The biggest influences on him so far have been Professors Jessica Pliley, Ellen Tillman, Kenneth Margerison, James Selcraig, Ronald Brown, and Thomas Alter. Their advice, guidance, and passion have inspired him to pursue his own interests in history and higher education.\n\nSteven Bradford is currently a fellow of the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians whose goal is to address one of the central challenges that the discipline of history faces: declining enrollment, particularly as it is shaped by the discipline’s poor performance recruiting and retaining women and students of color and by students questioning the value of historical work. As the Texas State Chapter, they are working on a number of projects to include a collaboration with university departments such as Institutional Inclusive Excellence to host a series of panelist conversations to discuss how a history degree, or minor, can contribute numerous career paths outside of the traditional academic profession. Steven will be discussing these projects as a panelist at the 2023 Annual Conferences of the American Historical Associations and the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians and will be joined by fellow Bobcats: Anh Adams (a Senior and history major) and Dr. Jessica Pliley.\n\nSteven’s academic research includes the discourse on human rights that emerged after WWII. Specifically, how the African Americans’ everyday experience as soldiers and POWs shifted Black American activism on human rights. He is also interested in the how crossroads of war forces sex work and patriotism, which includes understanding why, historically, men were told that dying for their country is patriotic while women were told that sex work was their contribution to patriotism.\n\nOutside of class Steven enjoys road cycling, smoking Texas-style barbecue, exploring and discussing international cuisines (as frequently discussed with fellow graduate students!), and spending time with his family and friends.\n\nBobcat alumna, Heather M. Haley, earned her Ph.D. in History and her Public History certification from Auburn University in December 2021. She minored in Women’s and Gender Studies, as well. Her first manuscript—Queer in the Cold War—explores Gay Liberation through the eyes of the servicemen and women who sued the Air Force and Navy, respectively, to serve as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual military personnel. The mid-1970s, Dr. Haley concludes, was a moment when broader social change forced the American military to confront, and perhaps relax, its exclusionary personnel policies. The services, however, doubled-down, reinforcing their commitment to bar gay, lesbian, and bisexual people from active duty. She is currently working on her book proposal.\n\nDr. Haley is an historian for the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) at the Washington Navy Yard in D.C. Her employment began in August 2022 and her supervisor quickly tasked her with a series of short-form articles centered on surface actions of the Guadalcanal campaign. Dr. Haley is also responsible for responding to requests for information from researchers within the Navy and the Department of Defense. She is also a member of the Department of the Navy’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion LGBTQI+ Advisory Board, which works to address and correct inequality in the Navy. Dr. Haley lives in Lorton, Virginia with her husband and tabby cat, Sherlock.\n\nAvery Armstrong earned her Bachelor’s degree from Texas State, majoring in History, minoring in Anthropology and Geography, and becoming certified to teach 7th-12th grade. She then returned for her M.A. in Public History and graduated in December of 2022. As Public History graduate student, Avery completed two internships: one with the Center for Archaeological Studies, where she helped to excavate a historic farmstead in New Braunfels and curate artifacts, and one with the Austin Museum of Popular Culture, where she planned exhibits and organized museum events. She was also an Instructional Assistant for the History Department and was awarded their Liddle Fellowship in both 2021 and 2022. This fellowship gave her the opportunity to teach History 1310/1320 labs, plan curriculum, and lead weekly discussions with students.\n\nAlthough she grew to love developing exhibits and historical preservation, she discovered her true passion was in Texas Music History. In 2021, Avery began a research project on Jerry Jeff Walker, a singer-songwriter who was foundational in the formation of the progressive country scene in Austin, Texas. This project grew into her Master’s thesis, which used oral history interviews to tell the story of Walker’s band, the Lost Gonzo Band, and their distinct role in transforming Austin into the Live Music Capital of the World. Avery’s thesis illuminated the band’s anti-commercial attitude, free-wheeling approach to recording and preforming, and commitment to their local scene.\n\nSince graduation, Avery has begun working as the Administrative Assistant for the Center for Texas Music History at Texas State. This role has given her the opportunity to meet important individuals in the Texas music scene and expand her professional network. Over the next year, she plans to publish a portion of her thesis about the Lost Gonzo Band as an article in the 2024 edition of The Journal for Texas Music History.\n\nEmma Beard is a Public History Graduate Student whose academic interests focus primarily on memory studies, but who has also done work in 20th century Texas history, and archival issues. Her thesis examines roadside memorials, viewed through the lens of memory studies, their regulation, how they fit into the memorial landscape, and how they can be preserved.\n\nEmma is currently working on an exhibition with the Alkek Library set to debut during the spring semester. It includes a timeline showcasing roadside memorials in Central Texas over the centuries, and a map of various memorials found in the Central Texas region. She has also been invited to present her work at Center for the Study of the Southwest in April, giving her a chance to share her research with a wider audience.\n\nEmma states that Texas State has been full of opportunities that have helped her grow as an academic. Working as an IA and being part of the Liddle Fellowship program allowed her to step outside her comfort zone and hone her skills in teaching history to non-historians. In addition, joining Phi Alpha Theta connected her with peers, and became a great place to share ideas and discuss everyone’s unique interests within history.\n\nEmma’s goal following graduation is to work within collections or record keeping in a museum or state agency. In the end, she aims to keep sharing history with the public, and to continue working in the Public History field.\n\nÁnh Adams is an undergraduate senior double majoring in History and Geography and has been selected as the 2022 History Department Outstanding Undergraduate Student.

Austin entered the Public History program in Spring 2012 unsure of what he wanted to pursue both intellectually and as a career. He knew he did not want to become a professor but was unfamiliar with alternative career options.\n\nDuring his first year in the program, Stephen was given a taste of what it meant to be a field historian. While writing a paper on the history of Houston’s hip-hop scene for Dr. Mellard, he had the chance to attend an academic conference and interview artists such as Devin the Dude. Stephen was also enrolled in Public History courses with Mr. Utley and Dr. Denton which helped further his understanding of research methods and shape his goals for the project.\n\nWhen Dr. Denton approached him about an internship, he requested something that would allow him to conduct filed work and he was soon surveying bridges and writing a National Register Nomination for the Texas Department of Transportation. Dr. Dedek, through his American Architecture course, helped him understand the field of Historic Preservation and develop the necessary knowledge base to succeed in the field.\n\nMr. Utley and Drs. Denton and Dedek oversaw Stephen’s thesis research on the preservation of historic dams in Texas.

He is grateful for the support and mentorship he still receives from the Public History faculty and says it is clear to him that he would not be where he is today without the guidance and education he received at Texas State University.\n\nDuring the summer of 2022, Isabel Gonzalez participated in the Latino Heritage Internship Program (LHIP) and was assigned to work as the Interpretive Design Intern at Fort Raleigh NHS in Manteo, NC. This site, while being known for its interpretation of the history of the English Lost Colony, was also home to North Carolina’s first Freedmen’s Colony which saw over 3,500 residents at its peak. Despite the large population, the history of the colony is not as recognizable as the English colony, and thus is often overlooked by visitors. As the park’s intern, Isabel’s primary responsibility was to assist in the development of the site’s interpretation of this important narrative.\n\nDuring her internship, Isabel created two permanent wayside panels which will be put on display in the park later this year, as well as developed pop-up and informative Ranger programs that she ran throughout the summer. Isabel was also granted the honor of representing the park at several community events where she educated and advocated for the vibrant history of the Roanoke Island Freedmen’s Colony. Upon completing her internship, Isabel decided to continue her work within the National Park Service by renewing my membership in the Texas Young Leaders Advocacy Council, an organization under the National Park Conservation Association, and began volunteering at Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, where she will help development interpretive programming for the park and its visitors.\n\nA 2014 graduate of the History Department’s MA program, Brian recently defended his dissertation, “‘With Misery buy Honor’: Social Class Interaction in the Public Markets of Oaxaca City, Mexico, 1870 to 1970,” and graduated from Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey in October 2022. The son of Texas State History Professor Ron Brown and his wife Judy, Brian spent much of his childhood in and around Taylor Murphy Hall. However, in the early 2010s Brian returned to the department as a student. During his time in the MA program Brian had the privilege of working with the department’s exceptional faculty such as Paul Hart, Anadelia Romo, José Carlos de la Puente, Jeff Helgeson, Mary Brennan, and James McWilliams. These professors inspired Brian to consider the importance of studying those groups and individuals whose perspectives are absent from larger historical narratives.\n\nThe lessons he learned at Texas State combined with the guidance of Camilla Townsend, Brian’s advisor at Rutgers, to inspire a dissertation that examined archival records pertaining to Oaxaca City’s ubiquitous markets as a means of enhancing scholarly understandings of the lived experience of the people of Oaxaca and the class-based alliances Oaxacans created to advance their interests in these same markets. More specifically, Brian’s research uncovered a rich history of advocacy amongst the city’s vulnerable population of female market vendors and demonstrates the ways in which Oaxaca’s female vendor-advocates relied on collective activism as means of defending their interests against the encroachment of the Oaxaca City Council.\n\nPeter Sutherland attended Texas State University as both an Undergraduate and a Graduate Student, being initially admitted through the Texas State Emerging Stars Program. His time as a undergraduate student inspired him to focus on the field of History while also pursuing a minor in International Studies.\n\nAs a graduate student, Peter worked as an Instructional Assistant for the duration of his program and also spent a year as a Liddle Fellow before graduating in the Fall of 2020. Peter’s research focus has been on the aftermath of World War I as well as on the various services available to Texas veterans.

Last fall she also worked on collecting data and oral history accounts for the Freedmen's Bureau project and participated in a separate archaeological survey and excavation projects.\n\nSherelle takes a very active role in her education and also gives back to her community. She was a 2018 Terry Scholar, is a current member of the history honors society Phi Alpha Theta, and the current President of the Texas State History Club. She has also made the Dean's List for four consecutive semesters. In her free time, she volunteers for nonprofit organizations such as the Lion's Club, the Hays County Food Bank, and the Elgin Community Cupboard. Sherelle plans to continue her education after her undergraduate degree and eventually obtain a Ph.D. in History so she can teach at the university level and become an active member of the academic community.\n\nMary is a graduate student in the Public History program, with interests in oral history, environmental history, and historic preservation. She is currently conducting an oral history project on the founding and early development of the Save Our Springs (SOS) Movement, a citizen-driven campaign in the early 1990s to protect Austin’s Barton Springs. As an important touchstone in the environmental history of Central Texas, the SOS Movement continues to inspire conservationists and ordinary citizens alike. Texas State University Archives will be the repository for the project’s recordings and transcriptions.\n\nMary has also volunteered with the Austin History Center Association’s oral history initiative, giving her the opportunity to interview subjects with a wide range of backgrounds, from business and politics to entertainment and graffiti art.\n\nMary became involved in historic preservation in Austin through research projects on the Broken Spoke dance hall, the Rainey Street Historic District, and the Austin State Hospital (ASH). She currently serves on the working group for historic preservation at ASH, where her interest lies in architecture as a function of historical trends in the treatment of mental illness.\n\nMary also serves on the board of the Texas Oral History Association, the City of Austin Ethics Review Commission, and the leadership of several other community organizations. She credits her Public History professors with inspiring her to see the myriad ways in which everyone interacts in some way with the creation and interpretation of history, whether through music, the built environment, or a passion for our natural resources.\n\nJason Jonathan Rivas is a high school dropout who recently earned his Master's degree from the Texas State Public History Program where he focused on oral history, historic preservation, and public memory. His Master's thesis, Scripting Memory: Hollywood, the Federal Government, and Public Memory in WWII, concerns the role of the federal government and Hollywood in creating an artificial memory of WWII through feature films. After graduation, Jason went to work for the Texas Department of Transportation as a Historic Preservation Specialist.\n\nAt Texas State, Mr. Rivas worked with Mr. Dan Utley and a group of graduate students on a public history project concerning the historical significance of the Shield Ranch, located southwest of Austin. He then interned at the Texas Historical Commission as a Preservation Scholar, working with the Cemetery Preservation and Historical Markers Programs. There, he highlighted grassroots, cemetery preservation efforts through physical and online articles and inscribed historical markers concerning \"undertold\" African American, Latino, and local histories. Afterward, Mr. Rivas rejoined AmeriCorps as a VISTA volunteer for Lockhart State Park. There, he produced virtual programming, literacy projects, and historical narratives that presented many aspects of the park through online interaction. He also assisted in expanding their community outreach through social media.\n\nBefore Texas State, he worked in the nonprofit sector as an AmeriCorps service member where he collaborated with the University of Houston-Downtown, the Houston Metropolitan Research Center, and Avenue CDC, coordinating a two-year project collecting oral histories of residents in the predominately-Hispanic Greater Northside, Houston community.\n\nFor fun, Jason and his fiancée Courtney manage an Instagram page where they visit historic sites for an #ExtraShotOfHistory. He shares these final thoughts on his Texas State experience: “We all took different roads to Texas State. Mine started with a GED; yours began with something you're proud of too. From there, we took control of our destinies as best as we can and made the most of it. We did it; we made it, so take pride in it. We belong here: read it, know it, remember it, and never let anyone tell you otherwise.”\n\nLezlie Hernandez is a History undergraduate student who interned during summer 2020 as a Preservation Scholar with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and is interning this summer with the Smithsonian Institution’s American Women’s History Initiative.\n\nAt the THC, Lezlie worked with the Historical Marker Program to research, write, and edit inscriptions. Topics for these inscriptions included community figures, state-wide organizations, and memorable events. These inscriptions will soon be cast in aluminum and displayed in their designated locations all across Texas.\n\nAlso while at the THC, she created a Google-map of over 120 historic schoolhouses throughout Texas. Many of these buildings are Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks and some are still in use today. This interactive map includes grand universities, mainstream public schools, and classic one-room schoolhouses.\n\nIn her upcoming internship with the Smithsonian Institution, Lezlie will use primary documents and historical analysis to create biographical resources for a digital exhibition highlighting the voices and stories of revolutionary women in STEM fields. She will also be working on a group project with a cohort of other interns and mentors.\n\nLezlie states that her internships opportunities have been invaluable and rewarding experiences, and that with every new class and experience, she finds herself gravitating towards historic preservation, public engagement, women’s history, underrepresented voices, and anything that exists at those intersections. In the coming year, Lezlie hopes to begin a graduate program and continue to engage in valuable opportunities.\n\nDerek joined the Public History Program in Fall of 2018 and has focused on local and community history as it relates to rural, lost, and/or dying communities and their citizens, as well as the general practice of oral history.\n\nIn the Public History program, Derek has developed a wide variety of writing, interviewing, and research-based skills using methodologies and best practices that have helped him in several individual and group projects during graduate school. In Fall 2019, he served as the leader of a research team on a project that resulted in the publication of a National Park Service report, Creative Conservation: The Environmental Legacy of Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson, 1963-1969, produced for use by LBJ National Historic Park for promoting the exploration of President Johnson's environmental conservation record.\n\nDerek also had the opportunity to interview nationally renowned Red Dirt country musician, Cody Canada, about his life and career, as well as an conduct an oral history project with one of the oldest living citizens in Martindale, TX, about the difficulties that both time and socioeconomic change brought to the town in the mid-to-late 20th century.\n\nDerek recently served as an intern with the Star of the Republic Museum located at Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Site. In this internship, Derek assisted with the transcription of numerous historical documents from the mid-to-late 1800s, worked with social media postings, and researched various aspects of Washington County's local history.\n\nThrough historical research, Derek’s hopes to explore the realms of daily domestic and social life from decades past to better navigate the rural and urbanized terrain of both Texas and the American South. He hopes to follow in the footsteps of those before him by capturing the essence of past and present community life through recorded stories, oral histories, historical markers, and research into unique topics that resonate with citizens from all walks of life.\n\nJames McReynolds is an experienced museum professional and proud graduate of Texas State University. He earned a Master's Degree from the Public History Program while working full-time at the Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin, Texas. After graduation, he worked his way up to Head of Public Programs at the Museum in 2019. In that position he works to develop, implement, and evaluate a variety of programs and projects that seek to increase the public's understanding of Texas history and culture. He oversees the team of educators responsible for programming for adult, family/youth, and film audiences as well as the Museum's volunteer department. Guided by Museum exhibitions, partnerships, and audience goals, the team creates offerings that position the Museum as a dynamic and participatory place where visitors can engage in their own learning and discovery. James balances scholarship, accessibility, and guest experience to create offerings that serve the needs of the central Texas and statewide Museum audience, including oversight of public programs and events, involvement in exhibition development, and interpretive messaging. When he's not working James enjoys cooking, hiking, and traveling with his wife Tanya and two daughters, Betsy and Caroline.\n\nJames | \"My experience at Texas State was great and the balance in the curriculum has helped my career in so many ways. American history coursework exposed me to new scholarship and taught me valuable research and critical thinking skills that I rely on to do my job. The public history courses gave me the kind of practical hands-on experience that made for an easy transition to the day-to-day work at the museum and with peer public history institutions. A big thank you to the faculty, past and present, who are excellent scholars and teachers who are truly invested in the success of their students.\"\n\nRailey Tassin is a second-year graduate student pursing a Master’s in Public History at Texas State University. A southeast Texas native, she received a B.A. in History from Texas Christian University where she graduated with honors. Her research interests are twentieth-century U.S. women’s and gender history, particularly as it intersects with race, sexuality, and class. In the fall, Railey will be submitting an application for an undertold Texas historical marker for the Manhattan Club in Austin, Texas with her research partner, Amber Leigh Hullum. In the future, Railey would like to continue working at public history sites dedicated to documenting the history of underrepresented groups and engaging the public with diverse stories.\n\nLast summer, Railey held an internship at Kreische Brewery and Monument Hill State Historic Sites in La Grange. The site encompasses a tomb which holds the remains of 52 Texas men who died during the Dawson and Mier expeditions, a 19th-century home built by German immigrant Heinrich Kreische, and the ruins of Kreische's stone brewery (~1870-1884) which was the 3rd largest commercial brewery in Texas for a time. Along with assisting with admissions at the Visitors’ Center, she also offered guided tours on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Additionally, Railey is conducting research on several facets of the site which she will use to help update and supplement the docents’ manual and other materials. One aspect of her research centers on adding the history of indigenous groups to expand the diversity of stories at the site. She is also working to uncover more information on Kreische’s early years and the activities of the Bluff schuetzenverein (German shooting club) which gathered for years at a pavilion located on Kreische’s property.\n\nAfter earning his BA in history in the fall of 2013, recent master’s recipient Jake Dromgoole returned to the hallowed halls of Taylor-Murphy in August 2018 in an effort to earn his masters while focusing on a subject he’d spent years obsessing over: Texas music. After learning the basics of public history from instructors Mr. Dan Utley and Dr. Nancy Berlage, Jake applied his newfound skills to nearly every project assigned, including oral histories with Austin record proprietors and a team project with Texas barbecue legend Tootsie Tomanetz.\n\nMusic remained on the budding historian’s mind and in the fall of 2019, Jake enrolled in Dr. Mellard’s History of Texas Music class. It was in this Wednesday night course that Jake developed the idea that would evolve into his thesis “Heavy on the Air: Radio and Promotion in the Heavy Metal Capital of the World.” Focusing on the history of San Antonio’s legendary KMAC/KISS radio stations, the story follows the musical journeys of three highly influential San Antonians as they placed the city at the center of the heavy metal universe. Also, during this time, Jake began writing for KTSW’s music blog, covering concerts in Austin and writing pieces dedicated to late musicians Gram Parsons and John Prine.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, Jake began an internship with the Texas Dance Hall Preservation where he, along with a team of dedicated researchers, poured through newspaper archives in an effort to find information on dance halls affected by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Along with his efforts with the TDHP, Jake partnered with former professor Mr. Utley and fellow classmate Helen Johnson to write an article titled “A Drama on Life’s Stage: Tracing a Family’s History from Two Rescued Letters” for the Texas Heritage Magazine.\n\nRobert’s work in archives has consisted of working with the Foreign Relations Papers of the United States, the FDR Presidential Library, and various newspaper archives. In January 2020 he traveled to London for two weeks to conduct archival work in British government archives, focusing mainly on the British Foreign Office. He also hopes to visit the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library once its renovations are complete in early 2020 to access the records of the Hoover kept regarding the distribution of food and aid to Finland in 1919, but also the records of the Finnish-American relief fund, and organization he started and led following the outbreak of the Winter War in November 1939.\n\nHe is currently self-teaching himself Swedish, with the goal for his Ph.D. work to be able to access archives in Sweden and Finland. Access to these archives will further Robert’s research and help him paint a more wholistic picture of the dynamic geopolitical situation that Finland found themselves in during the early to mid-twentieth century. Robert’s major research goal is to highlight the importance of Finland in the larger frame of World War II, which is largely overlooked by modern scholars, and how it influenced not only US policy makers, but also explain why Finland was the only country to border the Soviet Union that maintained complete independence at the conclusion of the Second World War.\n\nSince graduation, Evaliza Fuentes has been busy promoting her thesis, “Música Tejana and the Transition from Traditional to Modern: Manuel “Cowboy” Donley and the Austin Music Scene,” with presentations at the Museum of South Texas History in Edinburg over summer and also as part of a one-day Texas Music symposium organized by the Central Texas Historical Association at the Sophienburg Museum in New Braunfels coming up on Saturday, November 16. In addition, she is now part of the Visitor Services department at the Witte Museum in San Antonio where she began in Public Programs as an interactor and program presenter. As part of her job at the Witte, she performed as “The Chili Queen” on multiple occasions and can be seen inside the “Jacal” exhibit in the South Texas Heritage Center. This museum experience continues to build on the foundation she received in the public history program. A recent Saturday found Evaliza at the University of the Incarnate Word Music Industry Workshop and trade show sharing her knowledge of Texas Music history, content creation, repertoire enhancement, archival storage, and oral history, with attendees. The future looks bright and the best is yet to come. Her profile is available on Academia.edu.\n\nKrista Pollett graduated in December 2019 with an M.A. in Public History with a focus on memory, commemoration, and African American history. Her M.A. thesis, “Memorializing the Black Freedom Movement, 1991-2018,” explores three place-based memorials that are dedicated to preserving and contextualizing the history of the black freedom struggles within their respective historical landscapes. The sites include the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail (NHT) in Alabama, and the Equal Justice Initiative’s National Memorial to Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama. Her analysis of these three sites not only revealed the shifting trends in the practice of American commemoration towards abstracted monument forms and community engagement, but also how the increasingly complex historiographical trends of Black Freedom Studies influenced (and continues to influence) localized, site-specific commemoration.\n\nWhile completing her degree Krista has worked for the National Archives and the National Park Service. She interned and volunteered at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Library and Museum in Austin, Texas in the Museum Collections department where she worked to digitize non-paper artifacts. During 2019, she worked in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. on various internship projects for the Telling All Americans’ Stories initiative and Park History Program Oral History Project. Krista documented a portion of her Telling All Americans’ Stories internship experience for the National Council for Public History’s (NCPH) History@Work blog with the National Historic Landmarks program national social media team, which you can read here.\n\nIn 2020, Krista will be returning to Washington, D.C. to work for the Park History Program’s ongoing oral history projects until April when she will embark on a new position as the oral historian for Zion National Park and Cedar Breaks National Monument’s ongoing oral history project.\n\nWesley Moore is an undergraduate History major with minors in both English and German who will be graduating with honors in May 2020. While his main historical focus has been modern Europe, he has also studied exciting topics such as the interrelation of race and comics in America. His eclectic interests are reflected in his honors thesis and capstone project, The Funnies of August: American Editorial Cartoons in the Opening Months of the Spanish Civil War, which he completed during the Spring 2020 semester. While working on this project, Wesley combined his research in Spanish history with his interest on the power of comics as a meaningful source of study, as well his fascination with public history projects. Wesley’s project is slated to be on display in the Taylor Murphy building when classes resume in Fall 2020.\n\nIn addition to the outstanding work with his honors thesis, Wesley is also this year’s recipient of the Dennis and Margaret Dunn Scholarship. This scholarship will come in handy in the Fall when he returns to the History Department as a graduate student to pursue a Masters of Arts in Public History.\n\nAfter graduating from the public history program in August 2017, Lindsey Waldenberg moved to Raleigh, North Carolina. Currently, she manages the UNC Visitors Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she creates public programming, oversees daily visitor experience and helped create and launch the new visitors center, which opened in March 2020. Along with her work at UNC, Lindsey serves on the boards of the North Carolina Museums Council and the National Emerging Museums Professional Network. She also volunteers with the Friends of Oberlin Village, a non-profit organization that works to preserve, protect and honor the establishment of Oberlin Village, one of Raleigh’s earliest freedmen communities. Lindsey was recently admitted to the Public History Ph.D. program at North Carolina State University for Fall 2020.\n\nAs a doctoral student, she will study the history, preservation, memory and legacy of public housing programs in North Carolina, building on the research and themes she explored in her graduate studies at Texas State University. Lindsey is very grateful to the department and its incredible faculty for their support through her professional endeavors and as she begins the next phase of her academic career.\n\nRayanna Hoeft is a second year graduate student in the Public History program, planning on a May 2020 graduation. Her focused research while at Texas State includes object-based learning in education programming and decolonization processes in cultural institutions.\n\nDuring the summer of 2019, Rayanna studied abroad in Chester, UK then completed research in France and Italy. While in Europe she visited over thirty museums and historic sites researching how collections are incorporated into all ages programming. While at the British Museum she was introduced to the Benin Bronzes, artifacts stolen by the British in 1897 during colonization processes in Nigeria. Rayanna noticed the colonizing narrative and lack of Nigerian voice present in the interpretation of these beloved artifacts, which inspired research into the importance of decolonization processes in Western cultural institutions, especially related to ethics and repatriation. Rayanna believes in the importance of addressing provenance and inclusion in a museum’s narrative and programming. She hopes to focus future education and career endeavors on these topics.\n\nRayanna also serves as an education intern at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, where she creates content, assists with events, and leads tours. She recently co-authored an educator’s curriculum guide for the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historic Park titled “Creative Conservation:” The Environmental Legacy of Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson 1963-1969. Rayanna recently accepted a board position with the Calaboose African American Museum in San Marcos, Texas, and looks forward to helping this museum expand outreach and education initiatives.\n\nI graduated summa cum laude from Texas State University with undergraduate degree in history in 2015. Prior to attending Texas State, I served in the Texas Army National Guard and deployed to Afghanistan on an Agricultural Development Team. This unique experience piqued my interest in one day crafting U.S. foreign policy. Throughout my studies in the history department at Texas State I developed the goal to work as a foreign affairs officer at the Department of State and centered my studies on South Asia, U.S. foreign policy, and diplomacy. Additionally, during my undergraduate degree I staunchly advocated for student veterans, serving as the President of the Veterans Alliance at Texas State in order to increase the student veteran retention rate and support system. Texas State professors were extremely instrumental in encouraging my return for a graduate degree, which I completed in the political science department in 2019. Growing up in East Texas, I never considered completing anything beyond a bachelor’s degree. If it was not for the encouragement, kindness, and excellence of the Texas State staff I would not be where I am today. During the last year of my graduate program I was selected for a Pathways Internship at the Department of State and relocated to Washington, D.C. This opportunity led directly to my dream job, working as a foreign affairs officer on political-military issues in the Office of Pakistan Affairs. Due to the excellent opportunities and encouragement from Texas State University, I was equipped to compete with the best students in the nation and achieve my professional goals. I am extremely honored to be a Texas State Bobcat!\n\nAustin earned his B.A. in History in 2010. After graduation he entered the U.S. Army as an Officer and over the last ten years has been stationed three times in Europe, twice at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, and spent a year deployed to Afghanistan. In 2018, he was accepted to become a U.S. Army Foreign Area Officer specializing in the regional area of Europe and the former Soviet Union where he was tasked with advising senior U.S. military leaders and policy makers on regional defense issues. As part of his training, Austin also completed an intensive one year Russian course at the Defense Language Institute and has recently finished a year of regional travel across Europe including short term assignments at the US Embassies in Sofia, Bulgaria and Vilnius, Lithuania.\n\nCurrently, Austin accepted entrance into the M.A. program at Harvard University's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies during Fall 2020 where he will complete the necessary requirements of his Foreign Area Officer training. After graduate school, Austin hopes to serve as a military attaché at a US Embassy in Eastern Europe.\n\nAustin credits the History Department for allowing him to explore his passion in history. His academic experience at Texas State, and his involvement organizations as the Model Arab League and the Middle Eastern Culture Club, fostered a fascination and appreciation for foreign cultures and languages and led to a direct impact on his career choices and goals.\n\nDavid was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After graduating high school, he joined the U.S. Air Force and served at Spangdahlem AB, (then) West Germany, where he spent most of his free time exploring historic sights, primarily those relating to World War 2. After his honorable discharge in 1989, he enrolled at (then) Southwest Texas State University and received his B.A. (Magna Cum Laude – English Major, Philosophy Minor) in 1994.\n\nWhile in the Air Force, David worked part-time in sports broadcasting which led to a full-time career after graduation. His career in sports broadcasting allowed him to work with every sports network on every sport, highlighted by his 15 years travelling with MLB and NBA teams as the lead producer of game telecasts. In his career, David worked over 3,500 events at 95 different universities and almost every professional arena and stadium. He spent countless hours on airplanes and in hotels, and once the travel became too much, he retired and decided to enroll in grad school at his alma mater.\n\nAlong with David’s Master’s work, he is a volunteer for the United Way, and along with his wife Terry, co-founded Blossom Fields, a non-profit organization inspired by their late daughter Olivia that is dedicated to providing opportunities to young adults with autism and other special needs.\n\nDavid is currently enrolled in the Public History Program and hopes that combining his broadcasting background with his lifelong love of history can bring a unique approach to the past and bring history alive to new generations…including my his grandchildren!\n\nEmily Glankler is entering her 10th year teaching high school history in Austin and along the way has taught everything from 6th grade World Cultures to Geography and International Relations, claiming, however, that her favorite class to teach is AP World History (affectionately known as WHAP.) Recently, she’s been hired as the AP World History consultant for Marco Learning to develop curriculum and support for teachers and students around the world. Emily’s passion project over the past few years has been her podcast, website, and YouTube channel called Anti-Social Studies. What began as a few episodes to get her friends and family to stop asking her questions about Genghis Khan at parties has grown into a community of students, teachers and others who love history. Emily is proud that teachers are using the episodes and materials that she creates around the world and that she gets to share her love of history with thousands of students beyond her classroom.\n\nA few years into her teaching career, Emily started driving to San Marcos each week for evening classes, earning her Master’s Degree in History in 2015. Her grad school experience was intentionally disjointed because, as a world history teacher, she wanted to learn a little bit about a lot, from Roman History with Dr. Cagniart to the Mexican Revolution with Dr. Hart and African American History with Dr. Johnson. Two years ago, when she was looking for new teaching opportunities, Emily stumbled across the school of her dreams: Griffin School. Looking at the website she saw a former classmate from grad school, Jeff Capra. He helped her get an interview and now they are working together to co-teach AP U.S. History. This past year they conspired to bring Dr. Johnson to their school to help them celebrate MLK Day and it was the highlight of the school year! Emily is glad she’s found a way to turn her passion for history into a more-than-full-time career and the knowledge and connections she has gained through Texas State have made a huge difference in her life.\n\nYou can learn more about Emily on her website and Instagram pages.\n\nKyle Walker is a second-year student in the Public History program. Kyle earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Texas at Austin in Anthropology and Geography. As an undergraduate, he participated in archaeological field schools in central Texas and also interned with the Texas Historical Commission’s Archaeology Division where he assisted in cataloging artifacts from the shipwreck of the LaBelle and conducted research for Presidio La Bahia in Goliad. Before enrolling at Texas State, he worked for five years with the Texas State Preservation Board in Austin at historic sites such as the Texas State Capitol, the Capitol Visitors Center in the Old Land Office, the Texas Governor’s Mansion and the Texas State Cemetery.\n\nAs a graduate student his studies have coincided with his previous work experience, focusing on local and community history, historic preservation, museum management, exhibit design, digital history and material culture. In the fall of 2019, he participated in the Public History Project class which conducted research for the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historic Park. He served as the primary editor for the project titled “Creative Conservation:” The Environmental Legacy of Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson 1963-1969. That same semester, Kyle was inducted into the honors society of Phi Kappa Phi.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, Mr. Dan Utley approached him to write a short article about the Green Book houses of east Austin based on research conducted in Utley’s Local and Community History class the year before. The article was published in the June 2020 edition of Texas Heritage Magazine. Recently his research focused on slavery at the Texas Governor’s Mansion, an idea inspired by his previous work at the historic home. In the coming semester while completing his comprehensive examinations and internship, he hopes to publish his research in an academic journal.\n\nIn the Fall of 2017 Kimi Diedrich graduated with her Master’s in Public History with a concentration on historic preservation. While in the program Kimi focused on heritage and identity, and how these aspects influenced the built environment. Her thesis, Make El Paso Great Again: Correcting Alternative Memory in the Border City, analyzed the historic narrative prescribed to the Manhattan Heights historic district in El Paso, Texas and how the narrative created a prosthetic memory regarding the participation of Mexicans and Mexican Americans with the development of area. After graduating from Texas State University, she joined the Cultural Resources Program with Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) as an architectural historian. While working for ODOT, Kimi has worked on Historic Preservation Resource Identification (HPRI) Forms and Historic American Engineering Record documents. She frequently uses her research skills to determine if sites and buildings are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nKimi hopes to further her career in historic preservation by implementing environmental justice practices to counter the disproportionately high and adverse effects that minority and low-income individuals face. She hopes to bring cultural awareness through data analysis and community outreach to promote healthy and sustainable communities and equitable distribution for all.\n\nThrough my studies in the Texas State Public History Program, I developed research interests in UNESCO, tourism, identity, and intangible heritage. These interests gradually merged into my thesis topic. The Public History Program enabled me to examine how international stakeholders apply heritage management policies and allowed me to conduct case studies for my thesis through the Department’s Study Abroad in Chester Program and as a graduate participant in UTSA’s COLFA Semester Abroad in Urbino, Italy. While abroad, I learned a variety of approaches to site management, observed resident and tourist reactions to site interpretation and utilization, and gathered a vast array of perspectives on UNESCO along with strategic uses of heritage to assist with the preservation and economic development of communities.\n\nMy coursework, my time abroad, and research into UNESCO, heritage management, and tourism led to an internship with the City of San Antonio’s World Heritage Office. During that internship, I learned the practical application of research when assisting with the design and implementation of heritage related economic development initiatives, how US stakeholders leverage the various UNESCO programs in their communities, and how to execute community outreach projects. The internship paired with my education opened the door to becoming a contracted heritage consultant for the World Heritage Office since I graduated. Additionally, I am one of the first certified World Heritage Ambassadors for the City of San Antonio’s Certified Tourism Ambassador Program.\n\nTexas State’s Public History Program provided a strong foundation for me to transition into a new career field. The program grew my worldview, broadened my understanding of the complex challenges communities face over the expanse of time, and how history and heritage can help overcome those challenges. Department faculty regularly found ways to say yes to innovative projects along with readily helping students explore various opportunities within the historical field. My graduate student peers further assisted in creating an energized learning environment through regularly supporting each other and lifting one another up when moments of doubt arose. Graduate school is a rewarding and challenging journey that is so much more enjoyable when surrounded by peers, professors, and mentors who truly want to see everyone succeed.\n\nMaximilian Hall completed his MA in Public History from Texas State University in 2017. During his time as a graduate student, he recognized the importance of diversifying his interest within the field. To explore his options he served as an Instructional Assistant for History 1320, Research Assistant for the Oral History Project, and as Curation Volunteer at the Center for Archaeological Studies. Additionally, he completed collections management internships with the Texas Historical Commission (2015) and the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library (2016-17).\n\nCurrently he serves as the Curatorial Assistant and Assistant Lab Manager at the Texas State University Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS). His primary focus is the management and curation of records and objects for state and federal held-in-trust archaeological collections. Additionally, Maximilian collaborates with student military veterans to rehabilitate archaeological collections received by the United States Army Corp of Engineers Veterans Curation Project.\n\nAs a member of the Texas State University Integrated Cultural Resource Team, he participates in archaeological and architectural survey projects. Recent trips have included site visits in Texas, Colorado, and Alaska. His work includes photographic documentation, archaeological excavation, and digital historic structure mapping. His experience with the cultural resource management industry has sparked an interest in the study of archaeology and geographic information systems (GIS).\n\nHis plan is to continue working within the curation sector while gaining further experience in the world of cultural resource management. Maximilian wants current and future students to know that finding work within public history is tough and therefore striving to become a multifaceted resource of practice and knowledge is crucial. His advice is to seek out volunteer/internship opportunities, participate in workshops, and network with professionals in the field before leaving Taylor-Murphey Hall.\n\nFollowing the completion of her undergraduate degree in History and Anthropology from Texas State University, Jamie Ross began the Public History program while also working on a graduate cognate in Texas State’s Anthropology department. While in the program, she focused on the intersection of agricultural labor, public policy, and the rise of convict leasing in the 19th-century United States. After graduating in 2014, Jamie worked in archives and public policy at the Department of State Health Services and the Department of Family and Protective Services for the State of Texas. She has also done work in collections management, object conservation, and curriculum development for archives and institutions across the state. The instruction that Jamie received in research, project development, and pedagogy from the Public History program at Texas State University has worked to prepare her for the challenges she has faced in each of her positions.\n\nJamie is currently employed by the Texas Historical Commission in the Historic Sites Division as their Archeological Collections Manager. In this position, she works with interpretive staff, archeologists, historic site directors, and educators to ensure that all archeological collections from the 22 state historic sites managed by the THC are documented, researched, and appropriately stored. Working in archeological collections has allowed Jamie to help to provide insight into the lives of underrepresented populations which may have been excluded from the written historical record and to make space for their stories.\n\nWhen I entered the history MA program at Texas State in 2009, I knew I wanted to be a history professor because, from my perspective as an undergraduate, the job looked cool, laid back, and fun. I had no idea what the job really entailed or how difficult it was to get a PhD or employment as a history professor. The great thing about the history faculty at Texas State is they are open to working with students like myself that larger programs would never (and as my rejection letters from LSU, Texas A&M, and UH confirmed) consider. Dwight Watson, Angela Murphy, Mary Brennan, Frank de la Teja, Rebecca Montgomery, Dan Utley, and Paul Hart all went above and beyond in their efforts to transform me from someone who liked history into someone who understood how historians do their jobs. After completing my MA thesis on racial violence in northeast Texas, I applied for several PhD programs. To my surprise, I received several offers of full-funded PhD programs (including Texas A&M and UH, places I was rejected just three years prior), and ultimately decided to attend the University of Florida. Since leaving Texas State, I received my PhD, published several articles (including all my MA thesis chapters) in peer-reviewed journals, won two awards for those articles, received book contracts for a manuscript and an edited volume, won a university-wide teaching award, was awarded the William Nelson Cromwell Early Career Scholar Fellowship, worked as a Visiting Assistant Professor at Rollins College, and recently accepted a position at Florida Southwestern State College. Much of my success is due to the dedication and mentorship of the faculty at Texas State University. It was there and through them that I learned how to be a historian.\n\nBrooke joined the graduate Public History Program in 2018, focusing on historic preservation. In that program she obtained the skills to complete preservation projects through classes such as Dr. Dedek’s Historic Preservation and Mr. Utley’s Local and Community History. In addition to her focus on preservation, she completed coursework pertaining to material cultural, public memory, and early American Atlantic history.\n\nLast summer, Brooke interned at Burns and McDonnell, an engineering consulting firm, as part of their cultural resource management team. The majority of her summer was spent working on a rural schoolhouse project in North Dakota. She had the opportunity to work in the field documenting various historic schoolhouses' architectural styles, distinctive architectural features, the schools’ playground equipment, and the school’s outbuildings. The remainder of her time was utilized researching the histories of the schools through deed records, census data, and compiled local histories.\n\nThe skills acquired from the summer internship prepared her for work on a current contracted National Park Service project through the public history department. Brooke’s current research includes accessing archives through National Archives in addition to sources not limited to but including locations at national parks. Moving forward, Brooke hopes to obtain employment with a state historic preservation office, applying the skills from her time at Texas State University and the completed internship.\n\nAfter graduating with a B.A. in History and English and a M.A. in History from Texas State University, I went on to complete a doctoral degree at the University of Iowa. The skills I learned through my history degrees have lead me to a successful career outside academia as a grant writer at the High Desert Museum in Bend, Oregon. This interdisciplinary museum weaves together art, science, wildlife and history to explore the High Desert region. In the past year, I have applied for over 60 grants and received over $400,000 to support everything from access initiatives and education programs to innovative exhibitions and even a gallery renovation. Since grants enable the Museum to implement programs outside our normal operations, I work closely with directors and curators to plan and develop dream projects. A good grant writer has to make a strong, concise argument for why a particular project is necessary. Therefore, I frequently use research skills to learn about the needs and benefits of each program. As a grant writer, I play a small role in programs, such as Kids Curate, which brings inspiring art experiences to underserved students, and help support the care of animals that cannot survive in the wild. A history degree teaches you not only writing and research skills, but also how to see situations from different perspectives and innovative approaches to problems—skills that enable you to uniquely contribute to your community.\n\nJustin Ball earned his Bachelor of Arts in History from Texas State University in December of 2015 and entered the MA in History with a concentration in public history the following semester. Justin’s historical research focuses on the role that Texas played as a source of arms and ammunition during the Mexican Revolution and US Imperialism in Latin America in the late 19th and early 20th century. He previously worked on the design team for the exhibit entitled Land without Borders: The Comanche Range which was on display at Brazos Hall in fall 2016. Last semester, he curated an exhibition for the 2017 Texas State Common Experience theme “The Search for Justice: Our Response to Crime in the 21st Century” entitled Catching the Chain: Life and Death in Texas Prisons 1845-2017. Catching the Chain surveys the history of the Texas prison system from Texas’ early statehood to the present and highlights how and why Texas prisons have gained a reputation for being the largest and most notorious in the nation. Catching the Chain was on view from mid-October through December 15 on the first floor of Alkek Library.\n\nCori McDonald is a second year Master’s student in the Public History program with a focus on historic preservation. In Spring 2017, Cori was one of the leaders on the Percival Whipple Letters project for Mr. Utley’s Local and Community History class. Cori helped scan, transcribe, and research a series of letters from Percival Whipple, a soldier stationed in San Antonio during WWI. Whipple's letters provided a glimpse into life at Kelly Field at the time and uncovered a story of an eager soldier who couldn’t catch a break. Whipple's perspective may have been lost to history had Mr. Utley and his class not saved the sources and examined their historical significance. The class donated the materials to the University Archives, and after the project Cori co-wrote an article for Texas Heritage magazine that was published in September 2017. This summer Cori studied abroad in Chester, UK, with the History department and became enchanted with Dublin, Ireland’s Decade of Commemorations of their independence. She questioned how the preserved sites of the 1916 Easter Rising affect national identity in Ireland and her current research explores the politics of preservation and commemoration of Rising sites in Dublin.\n\nAfter earning a B.A. in Communication Studies at Regent University, Elise entered Texas State’s M.A. in History program in 2011. Under the direction of her advisor, Dr. Ronald Angelo Johnson, she received rigorous training in the historian’s craft and developed a sustained interest in exploring how belief systems – religious, gendered, and otherwise – influence culture. Elise became particularly fascinated with how these interactions shaped the new American republic, prompting her to write a thesis on the rise of a children’s religious reform movement called Sunday schools in the early nineteenth century. She also received valuable pedagogical training at Texas State through multiple semesters working as an Instructional Assistant. Through these experiences, Elise began formulating the goal of developing into the type of professor that gives every student thorough training in the historical skills required to use the past to contextualize the present, function as informed citizens within their communities, and develop the self-awareness required for being agents of positive change.\n\nThese research interests and teaching goals animated her formation as a historian after graduating from Texas State. In 2013 she entered the History Ph.D. program at Baylor University, where she continued to hone her skills as a scholar of early American religion, gender, and childhood under the direction of Dr. Thomas Kidd. This May she successfully defended her dissertation, which analyzes the Sunday school movement from 1790-1860 to show how concepts of childhood, and young people themselves, helped transform early American religious practices while also contributing to the broader formation of a child-centric culture that persists in the modern day. Elise’s research has received grants and awards from institutions such as the Boston Athenaeum and the American Society of Church History, and her first article is forthcoming in a top-tier journal this fall. Elise also continued to develop as a teacher during her time at Baylor, and received the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award in the spring of 2017. Her Ph.D. experience was further enhanced by opportunities to expand her academic skillset outside the History Department, including two years leading the Graduate Student Association and one year serving as Special Graduate Assistant to Baylor’s president. She is excited to transition to the next stage of her academic journey as an Assistant Professor of Early American History at Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington, beginning this fall.\n\nRachel Brown graduated in December with an M.A. in American History with a focus on Women’s, Genders, and Sexualities. She is attending Tulane University this fall to begin a PhD program in Women’s History. Her M.A. thesis, titled, “Repeal Politics: Abortion in Austin, Texas, 1965-1975,” explains the development of the Birth Control Information Center at The University Of Texas in Austin. The students at the BCIC constructed an underground abortion network in which they took Texas women to Mexico for the procedure before legalization. Her oral history analyzes how a handful of UT students filed Roe v. Wade. For more details on the BCIC, see Rachel’s article for Rewire News.\n\nAt Tulane, Rachel is an Andrew W. Mellon fellow of Community Engaged Scholarship. She has been given the opportunity to develop a project of her choice in women’s reproductive health and implement it in New Orleans. Rachel is also a recipient of the Monroe Fellowship. Rachel’s dissertation topic will be a transnational, borderlands history of abortion. She will focus on how women travel to access abortion in the twentieth century due to the increase of laws regulating women’s healthcare.\n\nAfter graduation, Rachel hopes to work in academia or at a women’s health organization.\n\nMiguel Carandang is a History Major with a minor in political science and is also a member of Texas State University’s Undergraduate Research Group. In July 2018, he, along with fellow Texas State students, presented original research at the World Congress of Middle Eastern Studies (WCMES) in Seville, Spain.\n\nMiguel’s research focused on Rashid Khalidi’s book The Iron Cage, and set out to examine and critique many of the book’s claims to determine if they remain true ten years after it’s original publication.\n\nMiguel’s presentation focused on the British Mandate Period of Palestine. Contrary to modern perception of the region, in the early 1900’s Palestine was a relatively peaceful place. Prior to the British taking control of region, there were relatively few major examples of violence in the area and Christians, Jews, and Muslims lived in relative peace compared to today. This changed during the British mandate period as riots and violence began to flare up. Rashid Khalidi claims in Iron Cage,that the British utilized tactics designed to encourage local rivalries in order to prevent the region from forming a unified opposition.\n\nIf true, it could give major insight as too why relations between the Muslim and Jewish communities deteriorated into the conflict they experience today. Miguel’s objective was to study British policies, the motivations behind them, their consequences, and whether or not they have impacts on the world today.\n\nFollowing this research project, he hopes to graduate in the Spring to become an educator to future generations.\n\nAllison Robinson\n\nComing back to teach history at Texas State has been a goal of mine since I became a student here in 2009, so I was delighted to receive that opportunity this academic year. While working on my Master’s degree at Texas State, every member of the history faculty made it their job to get involved and inspire their undergraduate and graduate students. As an IA, I watched several members of the faculty give enthusiastic lectures on American history with a genuine desire to make these required courses an enjoyable experience for undergraduates. As a graduate student, I witnessed thesis committees create a challenging yet nurturing environment that pushed their students to improve and overcome every obstacle they faced. The faculty’s dedication to their students was obvious both inside and outside of the classroom as they helped students realize their full potential and assisted them in achieving their next goals, whether on the job market or in PhD programs. My experience at Texas State further fueled my drive to get a PhD and teach history at the collegiate level. There is no doubt that I would not have had the stamina to achieve these goals without the preparation I received in my Master’s program and constant support from the history faculty at Texas State. But I think the true testament to this department is the fact that they believe in and trust their former students to come back and teach as part of the faculty. They know that our time here instilled an insatiable desire to teach and improve the college experience for all students at Texas State. I am fortunate to now be a part of that mission.\n\nThomas Alter\n\nI entered the History MA program at Texas State seeking to improve my career options beyond the dead end job I had. With not knowing what to expect, I quickly realized Texas State was a perfect fit for me. The faculty is down to earth, yet at the same time rigorous in their pursuit of knowledge as they challenge students to rise to their full potential. This led me to engage in my own research of agrarian radicalism in Texas. Upon completing my Masters, with the encouragement of my professors at Texas State, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. with a focus on transnational labor history at the University of Illinois at Chicago. My time at Texas State equipped me to confront the obstacles in obtaining my degree, such as traveling to numerous archives and getting one’s work published for the first time. While working on my Ph.D. in the Midwest, I had what seemed to be an impossible dream of returning to Texas State to teach. Now that my dream has become a reality, I am incredibly happy to be teaching at Texas State with its diverse student body and accomplished faculty.\n\nHistory has fascinated me my entire life. Growing up amidst the monuments and battlefields of my hometown of Richmond bred in me a curiosity for investigating how things come to be the way that they are. A youthful desire to learn about battlefield heroics propelled me to study history seriously. From that starting point, my main focus has evolved, broadly, to center on Americans’ relationship with their government.\n\nI’ve always liked taking the scenic route, and as a 31-year-old senior, my college career stands as evidence of that affinity. I moved to Texas from my hometown of Richmond, VA in 2013 to be with my fiancée as she worked on receiving a Ph. D in educational psychology from the University of Texas at Austin while I attended Texas State University.\n\nI currently work full-time with Professional Contract Services, Inc. (PCSI), a nonprofit contractor operating under the auspices of the AbilityOne program, which works towards a general goal of providing employment for individuals with significant disabilities. I work in the organization’s IT Department, providing support to users at jobsites located all across the United States.\n\nI also volunteer with the organization CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates). CASA advocates for abused and neglected children as they weave their way through the legal system, speaking solely for the best interests of the child at every step of the way.\n\n“There is a bit of Texas State in my blood, though I suppose, in the course of pursuing two degrees and various mishaps on our far from level campus, there may be more of my blood there”\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time in Taylor-Murphy and, thanks to connections made with professors and my fellow students, have shaped a career in museums. Currently, I’m an Associate Curator at the National Cowboy and Wester"
