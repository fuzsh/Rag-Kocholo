        "text": "At Johns Hopkins University, students, faculty, and staff are provided with the option to identify themselves using a chosen first name within select university systems. Chosen name can be elected at my.jhu.edu.\n\nA chosen or preferred name is the use of a first, middle and/or last name that is different from a person’s legal name. There are many reasons why someone would use a chosen name, such as a reflection of gender identity, as a nickname, or as a westernized or Americanized name.\n\nOnce specified, a chosen name will replace legal name in select university system user interfaces unless the system requires the use of legal name. Support for chosen middle and last names will be implemented starting in the Spring 2022 semester. Chosen first name (previously referred to as preferred first name) is currently used in select university system user interfaces, usually in addition to legal first name. As systems are modified to support chosen middle and last names, chosen first name will replace legal first name in the interface, if applicable. This page will be updated as systems are modified.\n\nJHU reserves the right to remove a chosen name for any reason, including misrepresentation or the use of inappropriate, offensive or derogatory language.\n\nThis information applies to all schools and campuses at JHU, and for students, faculty and staff, except where indicated.\n\nFor more information, read the university policy on chosen names.\n\nUsing Chosen Names\n\nWherever possible, use someone’s chosen name. This includes casual conversation, email communication, and formal settings.\n\nIf you are creating a registration/signup form, allow the use of chosen name only, unless there is some specific reason you need access to someone’s legal name.\n\nDepending on which platforms you use, you may have access to a student or colleague’s legal name. Treat this as confidential data and do not employ it unless there is a specific need for it to be used.\n\nThere may be circumstances (e.g. when conducting a background check, dealing with financial records, or sending postal mail) when a legal name is required. Limit the use of that name to those circumstances.\n\nThere may be times (e.g. when contacting family members or writing letters of recommendation) when someone may not want the chosen name used. If you are hesitant about a particular context, you can ask privately if there is an exception to using the chosen\n\nIn most circumstances, someone’s JHED (e.g. jhopkin1) will stay static, so you can reliably use that to identify a record in SIS or other platforms even if the chosen name is not visible/searchable.\n\nChosen Name Use in Systems\n\nOver the last several years, Johns Hopkins University has committed to, and implemented, policies to support transgender and non-binary individuals, including the use of chosen names and pronouns in many of our information and academic systems.\n\nFor detailed information on how to specify your chosen name and obtain a JHU badge, please click here.\n\nPlease contact us if you have a question about a particular system, office, or process.\n\nUsing Pronouns\n\nPronouns are how we refer to each other in the third person. You cannot guess someone’s gender or pronouns by their appearance! Here are a few answers to questions related to pronouns.\n\nAlso, you can PDF Document: download a PDF with helpful thoughts about pronouns.\n\nWhy Care about Pronouns?\n\nWhy focus on pronouns?\n\nYou can’t always tell someone’s gender by looking at them. Using someone’s correct personal pronouns is respectful and creates an inclusive environment.\n\nWho might use gender neutral pronouns?\n\nPeople who may not identify as strictly a woman or a man, such as non-binary. It may also be good to use neutral pronouns when you do not know what the person would prefer.\n\nWhat are some examples of gender neutral pronouns?\n\nThere are many, but here are some examples: they, them, theirs; xe, xir, xirs; ze, zir, zirs.\n\nIs singular ‘they’ grammatically correct?\n\nYes. The Washington Post style guide, The Merriam-Webster Dictionary, and the Oxford Dictionary all recognize the singular “they” as a gender-neutral pronoun.\n\nWhy are gender neutral/gender inclusive pronouns important?\n\nUsing someone’s pronouns accurately shows respect and acceptance.\n\nHow to Use Pronouns\n\nWho do I ask about their pronouns?\n\nIdeally everyone. Asking people about their pronouns is an excellent practice that doesn’t single out non gender conforming, trans, genderfluid, or other gender minorities.\n\nHow do I ask which pronouns to use when speaking with or about someone?\n\nIf possible, introduce yourself first. For example, “Hi, my name is Kat and my pronouns are they, them and their. What would you like me to call you?”\n\nWhat if I ask someone their pronouns and they ask why?\n\nGive them an example, such as: someone with the name Elizabeth may go by Liz or Beth and I just want to make sure I use the right one to show respect.\n\nHow can I use pronouns in my work or academic setting?\n\nShare your own pronouns and ask others to share their pronouns with the group or you individually.\n\nHow can I support people who use multiple pronouns?\n\nSome people do use multiple sets of pronouns. Read this article from them. magazine that combines perspectives from 10 different people on their multiple pronoun usage. How To Affirm the People in Your Life Who Use Multiple Sets of Pronouns\n\nHow can I use pronouns in healthcare settings?\n\nRelationships in healthcare are unique and require a great deal of trust. Make a point of asking a patient’s pronouns and name they go by, ideally at first introduction, and use the information at each subsequent interaction.\n\nTroubleshooting with Pronouns"
