        "text": "Translate given names and family names shown on documents submitted as SSN evidence to the first and last name on the SSN application, respectively, as follows:\n\n•\n\ngiven name(s) = full first name and middle name, either of which may have more than one part; and\n\n•\n\nfamily name = full last name, surname, or family name, which may have more than one part. A suffix (i.e., Junior, II, Senior) may also be shown as part of the family name.\n\nSince a person’s middle name(s) or suffix is not considered part of the legal name by SSA, a middle name shown as part of the given name or a suffix shown as part of the family name can be omitted or entered in the middle name and suffix fields of the Enumeration system. If the applicant has a given name with multiple parts and does not allege having a middle name then the multiple parts should be entered as the first name.\n\nDifferent versions of the name, which are not the legal name, must be shown in the other name fields in the Enumeration system following RM 10205.130.\n\nA foreign-born person’s legal name is the name shown on the presented immigration document (includes hyphens and apostrophes).\n\nThe only time you may process an SSN application in a name that does not agree with the name shown on the immigration document is if the person's name was legally changed after the immigration document was issued. In these situations, the legal name is the name shown on the evidence of the name change. For information on evidence of a name change, see RM 10212.010.\n\nNOTE: For foreign students (F-1 and M-1) consider the name on Form I-20 the legal name. For exchange visitors (J-1), consider the name on the DS-2019 the legal name. For additional information see RM 10211.295 and RM 10211.375.\n\nName on immigration document and other evidence for an SSN are different\n\nWhen the name shown on the immigration document differs from the name shown on other evidence submitted for an SSN, process the SSN in the name on the immigration document as long as the name can be derived from the other evidence (e.g., foreign passport). Different versions of the name shown on other required documents must be shown in the other name fields in the Enumeration system following RM 10205.130.\n\nIf the individual has a single name, see RM 10205.130B for instructions on entering the name shown on the immigration document in the “Other name used by number holder” field.\n\nIf the required documents show clearly different names, do not accept the evidence to process the SSN application. In these situations, the applicant must submit SSN evidence showing the same name or submit evidence of a name change after the immigration document was issued per RM 10212.010."
