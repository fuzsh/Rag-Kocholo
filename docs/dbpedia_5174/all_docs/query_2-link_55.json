We have team of coaches that can help encourage you and guide you forward. Because every marriage needs help, hope and healing.\n\n“Marriage is like a game of chess, except the board is flowing water, the pieces are made of smoke and no move you make seems to have any effect on the outcome.\" — Jerry Seinfeld\n\nThis is the way many couples feel. But what many don’t realize is marriage is a blessing. It is a gift from God and He has given us the power and resources to have a good marriage.\n\nWe want you to know that it’s possible to have a healthy marriage. Not a perfect one but a healthy one.\n\nMarriage looks easier on paper. The truth is it does take work. But the work can be easy and light with the right perspective, a few tools, a little elbow grease and coach to help guide you through.\n\nPlease consider meeting with one of our marriage coaches. You will be blessed.\n\n- Pastors Dan & Emily Klotz\n\nClick the button next to a couple's name to request an appointment.\n\nSomeone will contact you to schedule a meeting time.\n\nCaleb and Jenna have been married 10 years. Coming from two very different backgrounds, having completely opposite personalities, and bringing baggage from their younger years, they found their first 6 years of marriage to be very difficult and almost gave up a time or two. But God!\n\nThrough mentorship, counseling, and much prayer, they have walked through years of deep healing and are beginning to experience the fullness of what God intended marriage to look like.\n\nCaleb and Jenna have a passion to help couples work through the messy pain of marriage especially marriages that struggle in the areas of porn, infidelity, and anger.\n\nSchedule: Thursdays or various weeknights.\n\nRequest to schedule an appointment here"
