        "text": "Driven by an ambition to prove everyone claiming the Belgian coastline is an architectural wasteland wrong I extend my trips way out west every now and then. Gathering evidence for my statement it is well worth taking train and tram to explore that part of Belgium with a focus on modernist heritage. What makes those trips connected to what I’m doing on this blog is that the architects that have designed much of the most interesting buildings there have a strong link with Brussels or have constructed a considerable part of their oeuvre in my city. As a start of a little series I will highlight 3 holiday camps that still exist, all built by architects that have realized some of their main work in Brussels.\n\nWe start in Oostduinkerke, a borough of Koksijde, where Antoine Courtens’ Pro Juventute still stands albeit not in prime shape. Now a surfing school surrounded by villa’s it started as an institute aimed at elevating the youth physically, morally as well as intellectually. Those were the days. Built by the Foundation Louis Empain pour la Santé de l’Enfance in 1939 and designed by frequent collaborator of the Empain dynasty Antoine Courtens. For Empain he built an holiday resort called L’Estérel in Laurentides, Quebec and several garden cities in Marcinelle (1955), Marseille, France (1958) and Frascati, Italy (1959). In Brussels his most well-known works are the apartment building Palais de la Folle Chanson in Ixelles, Gésu church near Botanique and House Haerens in Uccle, both built in 1928 in a far more art deco style. With the Polak family he also designed the COOVI / CERIA campus in Anderlecht, adding another Empain-link to the list.\n\nPro Juventide became De Sinjoorkes when the socialist health service took over the building in 1958 and it slowly evolved into a social tourism center until that closed its doors in 2008.\n\nSecond stop on the trip is on the other side of Oostduinkerke city center, near Nieuwpoort, where Lucien Engels built a modernist building for the Nationale Unie van Neutrale Mutualiteiten holiday camps in 1962. Next to his now demolished masterpiece Home Emile Vandervelde II. Most of the pavilions surroundings the main building are gone but what’s left still serves a similar function.\n\nLucien Engels’ work is mostly situated in Vilvoorde and will certainly be studied in detail in another post on this blog. In Brussels his main buildings are the outpatient clinic César De Paepe (nowadays hardly recognizable) on the Cellebroers street (1961) and the office building for the Brabant federation of the socialist health insurance on the rue du Midi (1973).\n\nLast stop on this trip is another building built by the socialist movement. This time by their Charleroi branch. Hence the name “Pays de Charleroi“. Now a private school and renovated, this pre-war modernist building by Gaston Brunfaut (1935) still stands proudly among the dunes. Although Brunfaut is a well-known name in Brussels architecture Gaston might be the less familiar one one among the Jules, Maximes and Fernands. Gaston was the most pure modern one of the family and built, among many houses, the Jules Bordet institute in Brussels and social housing near De Wand and in Evere.\n\nA good reason to visit Oostduinkerke. There are longer walks to be expected in further posts but as a starter a little stroll through the dunes should do. Check the instagram for photos of the referenced works in Brussels and more in the days to come."
