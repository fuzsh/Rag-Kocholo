        "text": "We've rounded up the most popular double names for boys, girls, and gender-neutral options.\n\nTable of contents\n\n​If you live in the South, double names, also known as double-barrelled names, are nothing new, and you’re probably used to hearing names like John Taylor or Mary Margaret. But if you live in another part of the country or world, this may be a new concept for you.\n\nDouble names, or double-barreled first names, are often seen in Southern naming traditions and are when you choose two names for your little one, often joined by a hyphen. It is an excellent option for those seeking unique baby names.\n\nA double name should not be confused with a first and middle name; people with a double name often still have a middle name.\n\nUsing a double name is also a way to pay homage to two relatives at once, especially if you have difficulty deciding which moniker to use. Double names are popular for boys and girls and may use classic and modern names.\n\nThe History of Double Names\n\nI'm not sure anyone knows precisely how double-barrelled (first) names got started, but double surnames (hyphenated last names) have a slightly different meaning depending on your country of origin. In some cultures, People once used it to signal social class, while in other cultures, it's simply the norm or an indicator of marriage or alliance names, mainly when used as a surname.[1]\n\nIf you choose to give your child a double-barrelled first name, a hyphen is a good practice but not a requirement. The hyphen indicates which name goes in which place instead of a first and middle name. However, in the history of double-barrelled first names, hyphens are not always used in everyday practice.\n\nChoosing Double-Barrelled Names\n\nRemember that picking a name your child that they will be called for the rest of their life is no small task. It's nice to pick a name that gives your children options as their identity grows and develops with them. Be mindful that aside from the two individual names, it can be shortened or made into a nickname. For example, you may want to give little Jenny the chance to be Jen, Jenna, or Jenny Sue.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is how the two names \"interact\" with one another. For example, can James Thomas be shortened to JT, and is James Thomas easy to say/pronounce?\n\nMaternity Concierge, HeHe (Haley-Else) Stewart says, “I always suggest that you pick two or three top names and practice using them. Practice roll call just like in elementary school, practice using the name in a scolding sentence of “Get these shoes out of the hallway!!!!\", and practice introducing your baby to people. This will give you a good sense of names that \"feel good.\" Most parents enjoy this activity and find it super helpful in making a decision.”[2]\n\nIf you are intrigued by the idea of the double name, we have compiled a list of 100 names to provide you with some name inspiration. This list includes baby boy names, girl names, and popular double names. Unlike our traditional name lists that provide you with the name's meaning, this list will highlight nicknames for each double name.\n\nDouble Names for Girls\n\nDouble-barrelled names for girls are currently pretty trendy.
