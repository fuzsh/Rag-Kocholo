        "text": "Many transgender people choose new names to go by before, during, or after their transition to their true gender, whether it’s because their dead name (given to a person at birth) is too masculine or feminine, too binary, or just doesn’t fit them anymore.\n\nThe legal name change process, depending on the state, can be tedious and frustrating. It requires financial resources to pay court fees and physically get to bureaucratic institutions, and much more. It also requires a lot of emotional energy to undergo the process, especially when you haven’t gone by your legal name in years. There are bumps in the road that someone might encounter even after they've changed their name legally.\n\nBut even before you go about changing your name on legal documents, you need to achieve the first step: actually picking a name. Of course, you don’t need to change your name legally in order to start going by a new name, but for many, changing your name is a huge step in affirming your gender identity.\n\nAnd sometimes, a new name isn’t just a new first name; it includes a last one, too. Changing your surname can represent a new type of independence, especially for transgender people who have been rejected by their families due to their identity, but most importantly, it represents who a person was always meant to be.\n\nSo how do you even begin to pick a name you’ll go by for the rest of your life? Teen Vogue asked 16 transgender people about how they chose the names they go by today. Some used baby name books while others were inspired by deeper meanings and translations behind their names. Here are their stories filled with self-love.\n\nElijah Emerson Buchanan Doss, 20, Pennsylvania\n\nThe name Elijah is deeply rooted in me. As a child, I hated my dead name and always wished for a more masculine name. In 7th grade, my best friend and I decided to give one another “boy” nicknames. I chose the name Elijah because of a book I was writing at the time with a character named Elijah, he was everything I really aspired to look like. The name was lovely to me. When I came out as transgender at 18, I went by Emerson, which is my now middle name. Some significant others told me the name Elijah did not fit me. After those relationships ended, I chose Elijah as my first name. I never looked back, the name is home to me.\n\nViolet Edgar, 36, California\n\nI got my name, as many of us do, by pretending to be someone online. In my case, it was from role playing an original character of mine — technically a gender swapped version of my character, who was originally male — in a certain fandom. I named it after her hair (purple — my favorite color) and, when I started meeting my online friends at conventions, I needed something to go by. I hadn't planned for that to become my actual name, but I discovered I had gotten used to people calling me that — and I rather liked it a lot. So, when it came time to choose a name for myself when I came out, it was really the obvious choice.\n\n‎Lucas, 22, Illinois\n\n‎I chose my name by going through lists on baby name websites and finding ones that I felt fit with me, and then I narrowed it down to a list of about five. I carried those around in a notebook for awhile before doing anything about it. Eventually, I stood in front of a mirror and said them all a bunch while i looked at myself to see if they fit with me as a person. I chose the one I did because it felt right, I liked the meaning, and it was not ambiguous (in regards to gender). I chose my Hebrew name because of the meaning and because of the loving, queer relationship between David and Jonathan.\n\nSalem Kentish, 21, Georgia\n\nI actually stopped going by my deadname before I even realized I was transgender at the age of 17! I went by Babydoll for a year until I started having indescribable gender feelings. Being genderflux, the road to realization was difficult for me At 18, I knew that I was transgender and needed a gender neutral name. I was reminded of the name Salem through Tyler the Creators album ‘Wolf’. There’s a character throughout the whole album named Salem who I oddly resonated with. ‘Wolf’ was an album I felt like I embodied somehow, it was dear to my heart. And I felt like what people usually associate ‘Salem’ with and how I personally related to it, was a perfect description of who I am.\n\nKai, 17, Germany\n\nWhen I noticed that I was trans I was fourteen years old. For about two years I went by a shortened form of my birth name, but after a while it began feeling more and more uncomfortable and wrong, so I filtered for gender neutral names on baby naming websites, until I found a few I liked. I then tried them out in failedslacker's pronoun dressing room, until I found the name I'm currently using. I was very happy and felt relieved, having finally found the perfect name, that is so very \"me.\"\n\nAlaina Leary, 25, Massachusetts\n\nAlaina found me. It was the name of someone I was close to in middle school, but she always disliked her name and went by a nickname. I often used her name when I was writing fictionalized versions of myself in stories. The name has Irish origins, which I loved because both my parents are Irish. When I tried the name on, it just felt right. It felt like me.\n\nDakota Grey, 25, Pennsylvania\n\nI came out when I was 20, within a year after moving out of my small hometown. Coming out was part of a healing process from an abusive relationship; I needed to put myself first and take care of myself. Coming to terms with being trans was part of that. I decided to change my name as my previous name was fairly feminine and I felt like an imposter using it. I gave myself a set of rules to decide on a new name: had to start with a hard consonant, like a D, T, R, 2-3 syllables, gender neutral but leans to the masculine side, something fairly uncommon but not hard to spell, something not of anglo saxon origin, and finally, no names of anyone I’ve ever been been romantically involved with. I compiled a short list, most of which I’ve forgotten now, and over a few nights would look at myself in the mirror and call myself by a name off the list. I would try introducing myself to my mirror image by that name, did it sound right? Did it feel real? Did it feel like home? Dakota was the first name that I said and it felt right, and it stuck. It's a Sioux word that means “friend” or “ally.” I decided on a color for a middle name as it followed my dead name and it was something I had in common with my younger sister. “Grey” eventually won out. I started introducing myself as Dakota in the spring of 2013, and in the fall, I sent in the paperwork to have my name legally changed as a birthday present for myself. On my 21st birthday, I went to the DMV to have my license changed. It was the best present I have ever given myself.\n\nLJ/Lucky Vogel, 22, Brooklyn\n\nI wanted to choose something that began with an “L” because of my deadname, so I started there. I had people call me “LJ” for a while (the “J” comes from my confirmation name, Jude). At one point, I actually had my Facebook friends and some family members vote on names, which was a really fun experience. My grandfather ended up becoming my inspiration. His name is Fortunato, which is Italian for “lucky.” That name in particular means a lot to me because of who it comes from, but also because I feel so lucky to be in a space where I have the freedom to choose a name and people who want to be a part of that journey.\n\nHeather Hills, 20, New Jersey\n\n“Heather,” actually came from a joke between me and a friend during my sophomore year of high school; in the very beginning of my social transition. It eventually became my name on social media. Later that year, I began to think about a lot of the teasing I had faced in the past for being black and speaking “proper,” and “white.” And what better way to reclaim power then to give myself a name with that exact connotation?\n\nPauline Carlon, 47, California\n\nIt was simple decision. Noticing that many girls choose shocking names for themselves, I wanted something familiar and I kept my last name.\n\nShannon, 32, District of Columbia\n\nI knew I was trans when I was six years old. Around 11, I kept a book of baby names with my favorite potential names circled. I hid that book in my closet because I knew I wouldn't be able to explain if anyone found it. I’m not sure I would have been able to explain it to myself either—I both knew why I kept that book and didn’t fully understand it. In my twenties I came out and asked friends to use my chosen name years before I was able to change it legally. I’m proud of the name I chose, and in a funny coincidence it ended up being the name I would have been given. My heart knew.\n\nJames Perlow, 19, Tennessee\n\nDespite not going by my birth name for almost three years now, I only started going by my current name, James, about six months ago. All of my “chosen” names had to pass an important test—did the name sound right when I imagined it being called out during a graduation ceremony, being exchanged in wedding vows, or otherwise used in a hypothetical major life event? Ultimately, I chose James because, in addition to passing the first test, it had a connection to my family, as James became the sixth first and/or middle name that began with the letter J between my father, my brother, two of my uncles and I.\n\nAsh, 25, New York\n\nThe name I chose for myself is actually a shortened version of my full name. As a non-binary femme person who isn't out professionally, I do sometimes present masculine and am okay with people using my full name, but I usually present feminine and prefer my chosen name then. It's a nickname that was sometimes used for me while growing up, and it's gender-neutral. I felt that made it easier for people to remember while fitting with being nonbinary. Plus, I really do like my full name and its meaning, and it felt weird to view it as a deadname or sort of abandon it, even if I don't prefer to be called by it.\n\nCindy Olivia Goodell, 61, Montana\n\nI had chosen Olivia as my future first name years before I was able to transition. Once I finally got there, my first step was to write letters to my (totally accepting) family announcing my decision and my new name, Olivia. My older sisters were talking the letter over, and Marcia said to Janet, \"It's too bad she didn't choose Cindy. We could be the Brady Bunch!\" After they texted me their joke, I thought cute, but no. My BFF disagreed. \"Cindy Olivia is a beautiful name. Some things are meant to be.\" My lost sisterhood washed over me and I thought, this is my place in the world. In my daily life, I go by Liv. When people are confused, I tell them about Marcia and Janet, and let them make the connection. Their laughter disarms whatever prejudice they may have about my trans status. It's perfect.\n\nJP, 24, North Carolina\n\nI was signing up for a race when I realized I wanted to change my name. I had entered my given name on the registration site, but as I looked at it I thought about how for me as a queer non-binary person, having a gendered name conflicted with my identity. I decided I'd choose something gender-neutral that started with the same letter as my given name so I could say it was just a nickname if I needed to. The registration timer was counting down so I asked my partner for help. Their first suggestion was JP and it felt like it fit me so I typed it into the box and clicked enter.\n\nSerena Sonoma, 25, North Carolina\n\nThe name Serena is a reminder of the blonde haired hero of the Sailor Moon saga. Like many trans women and femmes, when I was a child, I wasn’t allowed to express my femininity, and so I would often escape society’s binaristic expectations of me by using my imagination. I would daydream my authenticity into existence, and I would also watch a lot of television show’s, mostly ‘magical girl’ themed anime: Sailor Moon being the most affirming. My last name, Sonoma, is Native American meaning ‘valley of the moon’. It represents my intertwined identities being black, transgender, and woman. I often feel as if I’m forgotten in the dark. But then I’m reminded of what beautiful things can shine in darkness, such as the moon.\n\nRelated: Why Incorrectly Identifying Transgender People Who Have Died Is a Lack of Respect\n\nLet us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email.\n\nGet the Teen Vogue Take.
