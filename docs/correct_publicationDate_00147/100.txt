Simak, Clifford D[onald]. WAY STATION. Garden City: Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1963. Octavo, cloth. First edition. "A Civil War veteran who farms a lonely corner of Wisconsin is contacted by aliens who want him to become the keeper of their interstellar 'way station.' He agrees, and they reward him with longevity. A simply written, deeply felt pastoral which shows this author at his best." - Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, second edition (1995), p. 412. "The story gets its effect from casual juxtaposition of bizarre alien visitors and artifacts with realistic southwestern Wisconsin locale. It carries Simak's perennial message that all sentient beings can and must get along, or perish; the various galactic races face the same danger from themselves as do Earth's own warring peoples. A sentimental but effective story." - Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-1032. Winner of the 1964 Hugo award for best novel. Pringle, Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels 39. Survey of Science Fiction Literature V, pp. 2429-32. A fine copy in fine white dust jacket with thin abrasion along a portion of the top edge of rear panel (possibly from adhesive on an old dust jacket protector) and hint of minor dust soiling.
