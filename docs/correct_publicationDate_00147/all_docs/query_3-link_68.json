I'm sure it was a collection of stories and one of them contained the words \"he watched as the chair he was sat on slowly picked itself apart\" or something similar-I think it was used as blurb on the back of the book.\n\nOmphalos\n\nהדרךקפיצת\n\nJoined\n\nOct 24, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n777\n\nDec 22, 2009\n\n#2\n\nScroll down and look at the Collections section. Maybe one of the titles looks familiar. I think if you click on the links it will tell you if the work has a variant title.\n\nClifford D.

Unfortunately it could be any of those collections. Could use a site with book covers. Hmmm I wonder if a look on fantastic fiction would help…\n\ndask\n\ndark and stormy knight\n\nJoined\n\nNov 1, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n4,678\n\nLocation\n\nPacific Northwest\n\nDec 23, 2009\n\n#4\n\nChecked all my Simak books, even the novels (he doesn't seem to have all that many short story collections) and couldn't find any such blurb. Even checked the first sentence of each story (that would make a first sentence Ron Goulart would die for), but no luck. Sorry. Sounds like a story worth reading.\n\ndask\n\ndark and stormy knight\n\nJoined\n\nNov 1, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n4,678\n\nLocation\n\nPacific Northwest\n\nDec 23, 2009\n\n#6\n\nChecked it out.
