Simak is a science fiction novel composed of a series of interconnected stories, framed as historical accounts by future generations of sentient dogs. These stories examine the rise and fall of human civilization, presenting a world where humans gradually abandon cities for isolated, rural living due to advancements in transportation and communication. As humans fade away, Earth is left to other beings, including the intelligent dogs who have been uplifted by humanity's technology, and robots who continue to serve long after their masters are gone. Each tale in \"City\" explores different facets of this evolution, ranging from the philosophical implications of a sedentary lifestyle to the ethical considerations of genetic engineering. The narrative spans thousands of years, showcasing Simak's deep reflections on society, technology, and the environment. The overarching theme of the novel is a meditation on the possibility of utopia and the perpetual quest for a better world, articulated through the mythologized memories of its canine inheritors. ; 19 x 13 x 1.6 cms; 248 pages.\n\n[0-672-52036-2] [1977], 1st printing.
