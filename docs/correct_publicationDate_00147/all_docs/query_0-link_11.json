        "text": "I wanted this to be great.\n\nI have very fond memories of Way Station. It was one of the first \"hard\" science fiction stories I read as a teenager and it opened up the possibilities of the genre for me. I was captivated by the ideas in the book and it sent me on a journey through the world of science fiction that I have never abandoned. Nevertheless, I was disappointed listening to this, much as I was eight years ago when I checked it out of a local library. The story presents some fascinating ideas and conflicts as you would expect in a winner of a Hugo Award. But Simak really does not do a very credible job of developing the ideas and resolving the conflicts. In particular, his handling of the conflict with the government is unbelievable, even for someone who was writing during a time when the government was viewed much less critically. Unlike some others, I liked the narrator and it is worth a listen. But, if I am honest with myself, and rating it as if I was approaching it for the first time, it is not a five star story.\n\nA ray of hope during the Cold War\n\nThis book about a secret connection with the superadvanced Galactic group of species was written during a period of international tension at the highest point of the Cold War. Many people were pessimistic about the survival of our own species, and it shows through. The main character comes from a time long before this, having been recruited by his friend the alien he calls \"Ulysses\" back in the 19th century. The reflections he has on serving as a soldier in the US Civil War. gives the author an opportunity to muse about war and weapons, and to set up a contrast with the superadvanced technologies he encounters with the creatures who pas through his \"way station.\" It is a side effect of the station techology that causes aging to stop, which ends up providing a plausible reason for his neighbors in the country to grow suspicious. But in the end it is a strongly optimistic work, unlike Walter M. Miller Jr.'s A Canticle for Leibowitz which comes from around the same era with many of the same concerns.\n\nI had a few problems with the way the main character was set up. Despite his extraordinary origin and his more than a century in the service of Galactic Central operating the transit station on Earth, Enoch is not a fascinatingly complex character. He is content to do what he needs to do to carry out his job, learning everything he can learn about in the process, and living essentially as a hermit otherwise. I thought he sort of came off as a stand in for the author, mostly free of faults or internal turmoil. The one bad thing he does in the story is a simple bit of carelessness in planning a funeral plot, nothing worse than that, and the author has to work hard to portray this as a serious faux pas when it comes to presenting ourselves to the judgement of the Galaxy. He is always decent, courageous under stress, and inclined to ruminate over things rather than acting impetuously. Besides visits from his alien friend Ulysses on occasion, he has what amoutns to a set of imaginary friends he talks to in the evenings, and a close relation with the mail carrier he is dependent upon to provide most of his daily needs. More tenuous is a romantic attraction he has to the mysterious deaf neighbor girl Lucy who seems to symbolize the best qualities of humanity, meekness, gentleness, and a sort of mystical intuition with other living creatures. For the majority of the book, Lucy displays no agency, until a moment at the climax where she seems to seize the alien plot Macguffin, an act that essentially catapults her to cosmic significance.\n\nThe last ten or twenty percent of the novel is rather different from what went on beforehand. For me, it makes it hard for me to rate it as a four-star book. It becomes more of an action adventure story. At one point, Enoch struggles hand-to-hand with an evil nameless alien criminal, a literal rat-fink, who just happens to choose Enoch's station with essentially no forethought or planning until Enoch acts to save the day. The novel had been shaping up to be a sort of a political intrigue organized by alien factions out to consign the Earth to her own misery (because of Enoch's carelessness), but now a new opportunity to obtain some fantastic alien wisdom presents itself just at a time when we are on the brink of nuclear annihilation. I lived through the 1960s myself, and can understand this desire for a way out of our predicament, but still this felt a little too pat for me.\n\nHow Did I Ever Miss Reading This Book...\n\nWould you listen to Way Station again? Why?\n\nI would. This is a quiet book filled with some big ideas. Most of the action occurs internally, so in many ways this is both a psychological and anthropological view of man and his place in the world/universe. I loved this book and cannot believe that I never read it before. I am glad I did.\n\nWhat other book might you compare Way Station to and why?\n\nIn tone, but not subject matter it reminded me of the works of Ursula LeGuin, particularly The Dispossessed. Different subject matter entirely, but a quiet story where the action takes place within the characters and their relationship to society.\n\nIt also reminded me of some early Asimov and Ray Bradbury. This is an optimistic book and harkens back to an era when Sci Fi was optimistic as well.\n\nWhat about Eric Michael Summerer’s performance did you like?\n\nHe did a great job. He let he story unfold without hurrying and let Enoch speak in a contemplative manner that suited him perfectly/\n\nIf you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be?\n\n\"Movies Stink Read the Book\"\n\nSeriously .... this is a very well written book. Simak was a journalist by trade and it shows. The story is uncomplicated but it suites the simple nature of the protagonist and his situation. It reminded me of older Sci Fi that was written for the story itself. Devoid of fighting, hyperbolic action the story serves the intent of the narrative arch. This is not an action packed, page turner; it is a simple rumination on the human spirit.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nI have to give Audible credit, they continue to release books that are not only popular, but speak to the rich history of Science Ficiton. I consider this book to be foundation to any fan or amateur student of the genre. Highly recommend.\n\nEarth as galactic transfer station\n\nClifford D Simak's Way Station is a Hugo award winning novel from the 60's. A civil war veteran in a remote farming region becomes the station master for a transportation hub in our section of the galaxy. Given that he only ages during the one hour a day he is outside his modified \"house\", he's still around after 100 years and comes to the attention of the government. His interactions with various alien races are presented, but eventually he faces some critical decisions about the future of the whole planet as well as reorienting the galaxy with its spiritual sense.\n\nSimak offers a unique mode of travel, that is reminiscent of a Star Trek transporter. The aliens are varied, unique, and offer diversity beyond the standard humanoid-like body frame. While the engagement with government officials is a bit crude and naive, the potential solution to planetary annihilation that requires a sort of stupid bomb is novel and creative. It's clear that Simak was responding to the geopolitical situation of the the day and looking for an external solution for global strife.\n\nThe narration is first rate with a good range of character distinction. Pacing is in line with the pastoral setting of the story."
