        "text": "The Collected Stories of Clifford D. Simak\n\nVolume One: Eternity Lost & Other Stories\n\nEdited by Phil Stephensen-Payne\n\nIntroduction by John Pelan\n\nClifford D. Simak produced over 140 short stories during his long and illustrious career. Until now, there has never been an attempt to collect his entire output in book form. Darkside Press has announce the first in a projected twelve-volume series, which will at long last gather all of the short fiction of Clifford D. Simak into book form. Editor Phil Stephenson-Payne has painstakingly assembled twelve volumes with an eye toward each book serving as an overview of the great author's output. Each volume will contain approximately 125,000 words and feature a mix of the well-known and the obscure. Each volume will feature a guest introduction by a well-known author in the genre and each volume is strictly limited to 500 copies (as are all of Darkside Press titles).\n\nObviously this project will take several years for completion as these titles will be interspersed with the other Darkside Press releases. For those wishing to support this project and guard against possible price increases, Darkside Press is offering a subscription plan. $400.00 will guarantee a full set of matching numbered volumes. You get two books free and a matched set!\n\nFor payment instructions e-mail jpelan@qwest.net."
