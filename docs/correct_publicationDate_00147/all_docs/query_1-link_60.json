        "text": "I finished reading Way Station yesterday. It's one of those books I always thought I had read, back in the 1970s, when I was making an effort to read everything considered a classic - up to that time. But skimming its pages this year (when I'm again making an effort to read the classics), I realized I had never actually read Way Station - I had only read about it. Damned memory!\n\nAnyways, what can I say about the book that hasn't already been said? As fond as I am of City, I think Way Station is probably Simak's masterpiece. I actually cared about the protagonist, Enoch Wallace, and kept turning the pages to find out what happened to him next. Probably because, being in my 60s now, I found Enoch's situation to be a metaphor for aging. Though he doesn't age (or rather, ages very little), the years still pass him by, the world around him changes and becomes increasingly unfamiliar, and all his loved ones are gone. His isolation in the station, as a relatively immortal man, perfectly expresses the increasing isolation of old age. The pain of loss is a major theme of the book. There's no one left who Enoch is really, intimately close to. There are just simulacra of past loved ones whom Enoch has manufactured. Like the memories of loved ones we ourselves have lost, Enoch's simulacra are vivid for a while, then begin to fade, and eventually vanish altogether. Which only doubles his (and our) sense of loss.\n\nDefinitely the most emotionally moving book by Simak I've ever read. Younger readers might not find it so. (Simak was in his late 50s when he wrote Way Station. An age that felt more \"ancient\" in the early 1960s than it does now.)\n\nSimak is great. He is one of those who writes about normal everyday people being faced by extraordinary things, and mainly just bumbling through, no Heinlein Heroes here. Even his aliens are sometimes found just sitting on the porch with the protagonist. A publisher's agent once told him he wrote about losers, \"I like losers\" was his reply.\n\nI must read Way Station. And I'm going to reread Cemetery World, which is my favorite of his. I've given much thought of how to write something else on that concept, because I just can't think of anything more interesting\n\nThe main event for the Simak fans this year will be the appearance of the first volume of \"The Complete Short Fiction of Clifford D. Simak\" at Open Road Media.\n\nThe book has been announced for October 20 as e-books and print edition. The book can be pre-ordered on Amazon.\n\nThe Publisher is David W. Wixon who wrote an introduction to each story.\n\nVery important to mention is: This book will include a previously unreleased story of Simak: \"I Had No Head and My Eyes Were Floating Way Up in the Air\" !!! This story was written by Simak in the early seventies for Harlan Ellison's anthology \"The Last Dangerous Visions\", which, however - has never been released - until now. More than 40 years after the emergence of the story and 27 years after the death of its author it is now but still appear - that we may experience this yet!\n\nA first review on the story can be found at goodreads.com. There we also find the complete story list:\n\nInstallment plan\n\nI Had No Head and My Eyes Were Floating Away Up in the Air\n\nSmall Deer\n\nOgre\n\nGleaners\n\nMadness From Mars\n\nGunsmoke Interlude [Western story, no SF]\n\nI Am Crying All Inside\n\nThe Call From Beyond\n\nAll the Traps of Earth\n\nThose are good news!\n\nSomewhere, in a box of books in the back of my attic, lost amongst dozens of identical boxes, I have an old SF convention programme from a big American con, probably 1970s. It contains photos of Simak and some sort of biography, and I remember some mention of his dog. At least 10 years since I cast my eyes on it. Simak must have been a guest. I have been trying and failing to find the cover illustration of the prog on the internet, since turning over the attic is going to be a bit traumatic. I think the prog also had some stuff about CL Moore/Shambleau though I am not completely sure.\n\nDoes this ring any bells?\n\nSomewhere, in a box of books in the back of my attic, lost amongst dozens of identical boxes, I have an old SF convention programme from a big American con, probably 1970s.

I think the prog also had some stuff about CL Moore/Shambleau though I am not completely sure.\n\nDoes this ring any bells?\n\nHi hitmouse,\n\nI think the Worldcon that you mean, was the \"Denvention Two\" from 1981.\n\nOf course I was not there, but in my search for title images I found some time ago this:\n\nI do not remember exactly where I got the picture, it was probably an eBay listing.\n\nThe program booklet would have looked from the outside like this:\n\nIt is found more often on eBay or Amazon.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not know any photos of this Con with Clifford. There is a photo page with pictures from the Con 1981. You can see there as \"Guest of Honor\" CL Moore, however, not Clifford Simak.\n\nBest regards\n\nRalf\n\nAbout the new edition of \"City\" is remarkable , that it include the ninth story \"Epilog\" ...\n\nAfter the first publication of Epilog in Astounding: John W. Campbell Memorial Anthology (1973), the story was added to the following editions of City: Ace 1981 & 1983, Old Earth Books 2004 & 2007. Most editions after 1973, however, continued to use the original 1952 text (minus Epilog): Ace 1975 & 1976, Doubleday/SFBC 1979, Collier/Macmillan 1992, Macmillan/SFBC 1992, Easton Press 1995, SFBC 2003, Gollancz SF Masterworks 2011, Open Road 2015. This is probably because Simak himself expressed qualms about Epilog in a 1975 Tangent interview (plus the fact that the the 1952 text is the text that won the third International Fantasy Award):\n\nSimak: \"A couple or three years ago, after John Campbell died, Harry Harrison conceived the idea of putting out a memorial anthology for John. The idea was to pick some of the older writers that were writing back in the 'Golden Age' - so called - which really wasn't the Golden Age at all. The Golden Age is right now. He wanted to put out what would stand as the final issue of the old Astounding. Harry wrote to me and said I want you in it, and would you possibly write a final City story. I was very reluctant to do that because as far as I was concerned the City sequence was finished. Done. There was nothing else I thought needed to be done with it. But, because it was Harry Harrison, because it was for John, and because I was rather flattered for being included, I said I'd try. So I wrote the final City story which, I don't think, is as good as it might be. At least it's in the spirit of the tradition that I created in the City stories.\" (Tangent interview.)\n\nSimak then goes on to explain how problematic something like writing \"in the spirit of the tradition\" actually is.\n\nhttp://www.tangentonline.com/interviews-columnsmenu-166/1571-classic-clifford-d-simak-interview\n\nGreat discussion over the last day. I love all this digging into the archives and finding obscure photos and con references. Many thanks all! I'd never seen that pic from the 30's - so much life in the young Simak. If we ever can get photos from the 1981 con that would be great too. This has again whetted my appetite, and as soon as I finish my current read I shall read another Simak novel. I'm undecided between Out of Their Minds, Destiny Doll or Goblin Reservation. Opinions?\n\nGoblin Reservation.\n\nEntertaining little novel.\n\nFor five months, the first volume of \"The Complete Short Fiction of Clifford D. Simak\" is announced. This book is not yet published, but now the next five volumes have already been announced!\n\nAll books you can now pre-order on Amazon or Barnes & Noble. However, volumes 2 to 6 will initially appear only as e-books.\n\nVolume 2 and 3 (as volume 1) appear on October 20, volume 4 to 6 have been announced for March 1 2016th\n\nWhat is known about the content?\n\nVolume One: I Am Crying All Inside And Other Stories\n\n10 Stories:\n\nInstallment Plan (1959)\n\nI Had No Head and My Eyes Were Floating Away Up in the Air (197?/2015)\n\nSmall Deer (1965)\n\nOgre (1944)\n\nGleaners (1960)\n\nMadness From Mars (1939)\n\nGunsmoke Interlude [Western story, no SF] (1952)\n\nI Am Crying All Inside (1969)\n\nThe Call From Beyond (1950)\n\nAll the Traps of Earth (1960)\n\nVolume Two: The Big Front Yard And Other Stories\n\n? Stories, including:\n\nThe Big Front Yard (1958)\n\nVolume Three: The Ghost of a Model T And Other Stories\n\n? Stories, including:\n\nThe Ghost of a Model T (1975)\n\nCity (1944)\n\nVolume Four: Grotto of the Dancing Deer And Other Stories\n\n10 Stories, including:\n\nGrotto of the Dancing Deer (1980)\n\nOver the River and Through the Woods (1965)\n\nDay of Truce (1963)\n\nVolume Five: No Life of Their Own And Other Stories\n\n12 Stories, including:\n\nContraption (1953)\n\nSpaceship in a Flask (1941)\n\nHuddling Place (1944)\n\nNo Life of Their Own (1959)\n\nVolume Six: New Folks' Home And Other Stories\n\n10 Stories, including:\n\nNew Folks' Home (1963)\n\nIt seems as if Dave Wixon the project realized very quickly and leads to the end.\n\nThen there is perhaps in one year for the first time in history, a full story-collection of Clifford Simak!\n\nThat's really great on a certain level but I have to ask: he wrote over a hundred stories - maybe as many as 130, right? At 10-12 stories a pop, those six volumes can't be anywhere near the complete stories. It would take about a dozen volumes (not exactly the most bang for the buck possible, either). And having only e-books is a downer. That doesn't really count in my book (so to speak). Especially as, coming from Amazon, they'll be DRMed which I absolutely, unequivocally boycott. Also, like I've said before, after my fun with the \"complete\" Carol Emshwiller Volume One and Apparently Only, I don't believe in pre-ordering \"forthcoming\" books. Still, hopefully they'll eventually all come out and be in paper or at least non-DRMed formats - congrats to Mr. Wixon on getting it started."
