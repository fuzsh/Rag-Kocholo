        "text": "Way Station\n\nAuthor: Clifford D. Simak\n\nRelease Date: June 1963\n\nI didn’t know anything about this book before starting it. The ploy – Enoch Wallace lives by himself out in the country and hasn’t aged since the Civil War. The mystery of his life opens the book, but is quickly revealed to be the story of a gatekeeper for visiting aliens. Pretty wild stuff, and for the first fifty pages I was really enjoying it.\n\nThe plot slows down at that point but still stays interesting as it details Wallace’s daily routine. The author continued to add science fiction elements but not all of them added to a good story. The “talisman” in particular was a complete deus ex machina and the holographic love interest never entirely fit.\n\nThis book was still one of the better early Hugo award winners, with some unique alien races and protagonist, but missed out on being great with an all too tidy ending."
