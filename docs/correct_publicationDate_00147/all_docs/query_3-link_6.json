        "text": "3.25/5 (collated rating: Above Average)\n\nI’m a compulsive list maker. In the past few years I’ve gathered and submitted older science fiction short stories that depict worker unions–from Robert Silverberg’s “Guardian Devil” (1959) to Mari Wolf’s “Robots of the World! Arise!” (1952)–to the Hugo Book Club’s fantastic index. It’s about time I finally get around to reviewing a few of my submissions!\n\nClifford D. Simak’s collection Worlds Without End (1964) contains two novellas and one short story that appeared in Robert W. Lowndes’ magazines (second/third tier SF markets in the 50s). Two of three–“Worlds Without End” (1956) and “Full Cycle” (1955)–speculate on evolution of the trade union after the breakdown of the state.\n\n“Worlds Without End” (1956), 3/5 (Average): First appeared in Future Science Fiction, ed. Robert W. Lowndes (Winter 1956-1957). You can read it online here.\n\nThis story takes place in a future in which allegiance to one’s labor union has replaced patriotism. Unions are run as dictatorships–“there must be no wavering in the loyalty of any members” (20)–and create unfixable factionalism within society as “unions were the only loyalty in which a man could cling” (35). The Dream Guild, once a branch of Education, control the use of Myrt, the “great machine of dreams.” Like a 50s version of art-creating AI, Myrt weaves from sophisticated punch cards with symbols and equations, “the strange stories of many different lives” (29). Those that seek escape ask the Dream Guild to create an illusion in which to dwell for hundreds of years.\n\nNorman Blaine, Director of Fabrication within Dream, is a man on edge. Shakeup rumors swirl within the guild involving his own promotion. A strange woman named Lucina Silone appears wanting a Dream but he can’t seem to pin down the truth behind why she wants to give her body and mind over to the guild’s fabricated hallucination. And then there’s the incident with Lew Giesey, the business agent of the Dream Guild, who had ruled with “an iron fist and disarming smile” (17). Summoned, Blaine walks into his office to discover Giesey dead in his chair and Blaine’s own promotion letter on floor. There’s a conspiracy afoot!\n\nI found “Worlds Without End” an effective thriller containing an expected 50s critique of the unions–i.e. organizations designed to advocate for workers become mini-dictatorships shorn of their original purpose. There are strikingly few positive examples (no pun intended). That said, the world takes the form of a dystopic extrapolation and tentatively suggests a new future of inter-union exchange. While I won’t spoil the nature of the conspiracy, it channels growing post-WWII paranoia of government secrecy–i.e. Eisenhower’s “Military–industrial complex.” Simak seems to suggest while secretive programs might have value they must also operate with transparency.\n\nIf you’re in the mood for a functional 50s paranoid thriller, you might enjoy elements of this one. It’s not top-notch Simak.\n\n“The Spaceman’s Van Gogh” (1956), 3.25/5 (Above Average): First appeared in Science Fiction Stories, ed. Robert W. Lowndes (March 1956). You can read it online here.\n\nAnson Lanthrop arrives on an unremarkable and seldom-visited planet, with gnome-like aliens who live in “prairie dog town villages,” searching for information on the last years of Reuban Clay’s life (77). Clay, known as “The Spaceman’s Van Gogh,” spent his life avoiding “glory or acclaim” travelling from planet to planet, looking, searching, hunted by something (78). He could have amassed a fortune or put on art exhibits but sold his canvases solely to further his travels. Spurred on by his own need for purpose, Lanthrop attempts to reconstruct the last movements of Clay’s life. And on this planet of benign and caring aliens, Lanthop finds a Clay painting in a mud burrow and hints of the artist’s antiquarian beliefs that propelled him forth.\n\nI am always fascinated by Simak’s love of plots in which scholarly characters who attempt to chart and collect data on different topics–the historian Dr. Ambrose Wilson in “Full Cycle” (1955) is another example–and simultaneously learn about themselves or overcome their own traumas. While not a top-tier Simak story, I found “The Spaceman’s Van Gogh” an intriguing rumination, if a bit forced, on the role of religion in a technologically advanced future.\n\nSomewhat recommended.\n\n“Full Cycle” (1955), 3.5/5 (Good): First appeared in Science Fiction Stories, ed. Robert W. Lowndes (November 1955). You can read it online here.\n\nLike so many of Simak’s stories, “Full Cycle” traces the collapse of the City as a physical place and a central concept of civilization. Dr. Ambrose Wilson, a history professor, receives communication that his “university will cease to function at the end of the present term” (94). Within his ivory tower, he had lived in an “unreal and unsubstantial world” in which he adhered to the old way of life despite the rapidly changing American landscape (95). The city, once the center of American culture and industry, no longer exists. Instead, a “nomad population” roams in trailers from place to place with a new culture and new values (95). A few stuffies, used to relying on the labor of others, live in their once luxurious homes (97). The ties that bind man to an urban and suburban lifestyle no longer exist. Despite his advanced age, Ambrose decides to set off with his neighbor (and his family) in a brand new trailer to collect data on the cause of the transformation and find a place in the new world.\n\nAmbrose speculates that the deep fear of nuclear war created a “cleavage of the culture” as “man “had lain in bed, tensed and listening for the coming of the bomb, knowing even as he listened that he’d not hear it if it came” (99). This existential dread of annihilation meant that the federal government’s order to decentralize industry, so there’s “no target big enough for anyone to waste a bomb on” (107), is not met with protest. Large swarms of workers move across the countryside from factory to factory. Federal and national union authority disappears. Ambrose observes how trade unionism evolves: the nomadic communities create their own war chest and provide their workers assistance. Each trailer camp became “an independent, self-sufficient unit” (105). Unlike the stuffies he encounters, Ambrose sees the logic in the change: unions become “the one remaining solid thing that was left to them. Naturally, they embraced it; it took the place of government” (106). As Ambrose moves from community to community (they say they don’t need historians), he notices the appearance of strange new professions: green-thumbers, rainmakers, agronomists…\n\nThe 1950s saw the publication of multiple anti-suburbia articles, monographs, sociological studies, and science fiction satires. Television served as a “powerful normalizing” force in the promotion typical American lives, aesthetics, fashion, and spaces. Carl Abbott in Imagining Urban Futures: Cities in Science Fiction and What We Might Learn from Them (2016) briefly discusses Simak, who had fond memories of his rural Wisconsin upbringing vs. his later career as an editor in the Twin Cities, as an example of the antiurbanism common at the time. Abbott argues that for Simak, cities and suburbs “were an unfortunate transition between the rural nineteenth century and what he hoped might be a broad-acre society for the twenty-first century.” Simak’s “Full Cycle” (1955)–which isn’t mentioned in Abbott’s analysis–suggests that suburban life, and its reliance on technology, prevents the true development of the human mind.\n\nA solid ideas story with an appealing main character (at least for me) and a somewhat positive take on the vital role that local branches of workers unions might take in a decentralized future. I perpetually find that Simak’s fascination with ruralism and the need to return to it is undercut by forms of advanced technology–for example robots in A Choice of Gods (1971)–or various assorted magiks that allow one to maintain the ease of modern life.\n\nNotes\n\nFor book reviews consult the INDEX\n\nFor cover art posts consult the INDEX"
