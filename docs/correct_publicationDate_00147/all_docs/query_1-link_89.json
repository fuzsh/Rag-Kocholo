A warm blanket on a winter’s day. An icy shower on a sweltering one. ‘Way Station’ by Clifford D. Simak is about as classic as classic science fiction gets. \n\nOn the surface, Enoch Wallace looks like an ordinary 30-year-old living alone on his family’s farm. However, Wallace is actually 130 years old and even fought in the American Civil War. His unnaturally long life is because, many years ago, he was visited by an alien named Ulysses, who recruited Wallace to become the keeper of an Earth-based galactic way station—think of it as a rest stop on a highway for aliens to take pee breaks. His job is to take care of the machines, play host to the aliens, and never tell anyone about his newfound job.\n\nEverything remains hunky-dory for a century until—who else?—the CIA comes knocking on his door.\n\nThere are elements of this book that I enjoy from this era of science fiction. There is a wide-eyed simplicity to the story, and it is less about space lasers and more about humanity’s place in the universe. Wallace, too, embodies much of that earnest, optimistic outlook. He ponders over whether we as a species deserve to join the galactic brotherhood or whether we are too consumed by our primal instincts to bomb each other—this was written at the height of the Cold War—into oblivion.\n\nWhat I like less, though, is Simak’s world-building, which doesn’t make much sense. For example, why Wallace? Why is he the chosen one to represent the human race? He’s just a farmer and doesn’t do anything other than press some buttons and make coffee for aliens—so why him? Simak doesn’t have an explanation, nor does he convince us to care about Earth’s imminent disconnection from the galactic highway. I mean, sure, it’s a shame to be ignored by aliens and relegated to the backwaters of the galaxy, but isn’t that us now? Why would the local fauna care if the highway was diverted, especially when they’re ignorant of its existence in the first place?\n\nThe book also suffers from pacing issues, but it has enough quaint, pulpy ideas to carry the reader through.\".",
