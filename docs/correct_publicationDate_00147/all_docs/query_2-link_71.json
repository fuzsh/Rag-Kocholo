        "text": "EAST LIVERPOOL — A happy new chapter is being written to delight local book readers. History is to be made anew. The lack of a local used book store will be a mystery dispelled. A love story will blossom, a classic tale that true page-turners can’t put down. It’s certain to be a best-seller.\n\nThe Way Station announced it is opening a used book store next door to its 125 W. Fifth St. thrift store in East Liverpool. The opening of the yet-to-be-named book store is set for Veterans Day weekend. Patrons will have the chance for free books if they come up with a winning name for the new bookstore. (Please note that new books may be purchased at The Pear Tree Shop, a new store at 433 Broadway.)\n\nVolunteers have been working for several weeks to convert the former Turquoise Tables storefront into a cozy book nook. For the convenience of patrons, the most popular fiction authors are grouped separately, while other fiction is in alpha order by author. Section categories include non-fiction, biography, history, sports, fantasy, Christian fiction, Christian non-fiction, how-to, classics, humor, languages, art, music, large print, poetry, politics, science, cookbooks, Christmas, animals, coffee table books, children’s books, vintage magazines and others.\n\nThe prices are modest, with hardbacks selling for $1, softbacks for 50 cents, and children’s books for 25 cents.\n\nOpening sale days are set for Thursday, Nov. 9, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Friday, Nov. 10, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; and Saturday, Nov. 11, 9 to noon.\n\nAfter the opening, the store will begin a schedule of regular hours of 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. three days a week, Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays; noon to 6 p.m. Thursdays; and the first Saturday of each month from 9 to noon. The first monthly Saturday hours will be Dec. 3.\n\nDonated books may be brought to the book store or dropped off at the thrift shop during regular hours.\n\nThe organizer of the new book store is Caren Miller, who coordinated large used book sales over a recent four-year period at Northside Community Church, raising $16,000 to support a Christian mission hospital in Kenya.\n\nTammy Blackburn, director of The Way Station’s East Liverpool operations, said the thrift store has had a problem with books because it received many more by donation than it had staff to organize or space to display. Miller had been working with the staff toward the idea of holding periodic book sales in a back storage area.\n\nThat plan changed recently when Ed Sferra, a Columbiana, minister and businessman, sold to The Way Station the building which he had allowed it to occupy for a number of years rent-free, paying only utilities. Sferra had previously used the facility for a “street church” mission to minister to and address the needs of primarily downtown residents.\n\n“Pastor Ed was very generous in working with us on loan terms to make the building purchase possible,” Blackburn said. “He has a heart for the people of this town. He is just an angel.”\n\nAnother piece which fell into place, Blackburn said, was the recent bequest to The Way Station of a residential house across the street. Money from the sale of that property helped the organization to reach 75 percent of the fundraising goal for the building purchase.\n\nThe storefront that now houses the used book store was formerly home of the Turquoise Tables store.\n\n“The Turquoise Tables: A Gathering Place on Fifth, the little shop with a big heart for our community, recently decided to close to focus even more on helping those in need in our community through their ministry at The House of Grace,” stated Chaney Nezbeth, executive director of The Way Station Inc. “We were sad to see them go but know that we will continue to partner together to make a difference here in East Liverpool.”\n\nBlackburn noted that “Just before all this came about, Caren Miller said to me, wouldn’t it be great if we had our own little space for a book store?”\n\nMiller extended thanks to the people who donated books and bookshelves, and to the volunteers who cleaned, painted and decorated the new store, carried many heavy cartons of books, and arranged them on shelves and tables.\n\nThe Way Station is described as “a nonprofit organization which exists as a community resource for families and individuals in need, while reflecting the love of Jesus in practical ways.”\n\nFor information about The Way Station’s no-cost programs and volunteer opportunities, people may contact Blackburn at 330 383 6497 or stop in at the Fifth Street office and thrift shop during hours of operation.\n\nIn keeping with the book theme, Nezbeth said to remind those who are going through difficult times to have faith. “This is just a chapter in your book of life. It’s not the title,” she said."
