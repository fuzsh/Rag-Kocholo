Heinlein\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin\n\nWay Station takes place in the backwoods of Wisconsin where an ageless hermit is visited by aliens. Enoch is not like other humans as he never seems to age. The government has recently noticed this about him and they seek the truth about his existence. Enoch is a veteran of the American Civil War who has spent the time since operating a secret way station for aliens passing through Earth. His intergalactic guests gave him knowledge and immortality, but his gifts have made him more aware of humanity’s impending doom.\n\nSimak’s most famous work is City. The story takes place on an Earth that has been without humans for thousands of years. Humanity left the cities for the stars and, ultimately, for oblivion. The humans left behind their most loyal companions, dogs. The dogs were granted the power of speech long ago and now the intelligent, pacifist dogs are the last keepers of human history. The dogs all live in peace, but are now facing outside threats for the first time including the most dangerous of all: a warlike race called “Man.”"
