        "meta_description": "Novel, Manor paperback\n\tReview by CR:\n\t\"This was the Earth, he thought - a planet made for Man. But not for Man alone, for it was as well a planet for the fox and owl and weasel, for the snake, the katydid, the fish, for all the other teeming life that filled the air and earth and water. And not for these natives alone, but for other beings that called other worlds earths their home, other planets that far light-years distant were basically the same as Earth\". From \"Way Station\"\n\t\n\t\"Way Station\" (1963) can be read as a thoughtful and, at times mesmerizing science fiction novel. In fact it was winner of two prestigious awards, which attest to its popularity. It is also a story that forces one to consider our notion of human destiny and the motivating spirit that we mostly tune out as so much background noise.\n\t\n\tEnoch Wallace, during his Civil war service had contemplated the starry sky and speculated about life 'up there\". Thought serendipity circumstances he finds himself custodian on an intergalactic transfer station for varied and assorted extraterrestrial beings. This custodianship has lasted for over 100 years and comes with the benefit of greatly extended life - a mixed blessing as we find out as the story unfolds. The being that recruited Enoch tells him to consider the \"Way Station\" as a rest and recover stopover on a continuing journey. No one visits the Earth since it is considered too primitive and backwards for alien contact.\n\t\n\tWhat makes this book noteworthy, I believe, is the extraordinary narrative creativity Simak infuses into the story. Startling ideas and concepts seem to burst right out of the pages. His ideas have the ring of believability and apparent creditability and have an honest resonance with us readers in our time and place in cosmic history. It would be unfair to potential readers to wax and wan about this or that concept - after all reading and discovery are part of the guilty pleasure derived from reading fiction - so I won't be a spoiler!\n\t\n\tEnoch Wallace the station master (no, he is not called that in the story) is a very interesting character. Lets start with his name Enoch - \"Enoch walked with God three hundred years, and was seen no more: because God took him\" Gen 5.24. Simak does not attribute angelic status upon him but he does some startling things and has some unique abilities - another reason to enjoy this delightful story.\n\t\n\tThis reader has one big issue with the story, which, hopefully, will not deter you from reading it. The author intertwines several absorbing plot threads builds then to a climax only to resolve them with the most implausible coincidences. Perhaps there was no other way to close out the story but I found it disconcerting nonetheless.",
