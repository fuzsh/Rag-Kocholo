        "text": "East Lansing, MI: Way Station, 1989. First Printing. Stapled Wrappers. Signed by Diane Wakoski. This first number of the literary journal published in East Lansing, Michigan (& possibly affiliated with Michigan State University seated there) features three poems by Diane Wakoski (\"Nuns,\" \"Hobo Robert: or Driving Men to War\" & \"Fake Diamonds\"), the acclaimed, award-winning poet who at this time was Professor of English & Poet-in-Residence at MSU. On page 5, next to printed over-title & list of all three poems beginning with \"Nuns,\" Wakoski has hand-written her signature with characteristic series of vertical doodles. Also in this issue are poems, prose & illustrations by writers & artists who all appear to have been undergraduate or graduate students, or faculty as with Wakoski, of MSU. Included are contributions by Marcus Cafagna, Linda Dunlap, Gillian Ferrington, Marianne Peel & many more. A very scarce academic-literary relic; & a major Wakoski-completist collectible. In very fine condition with only a bit of wear & a few miniscule bumps at edges & corners of front, back covers & stapled spine; very short horizontal row of tiny spots near mid-spine edge of back cover. Interior very fine with only tiny bumps at upper corners of some page leaves. Very Fine. [Item #3411]"
