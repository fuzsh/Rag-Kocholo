        "text": "Enoch Wallace survived the carnage of Gettysburg and lived through the rest of the Civil War to make it home to his parents' farm in south-west Wisconsin. But his mother was already dead and his father soon joined her in the tiny family cemetery. It was then that Enoch met the being he called Ulysses and the farm became a way station for space travellers. Now, nearly a hundred years later, the US government is taking an interest in the seemingly immortal Enoch, and the Galactic Council, which set up the way station is threatening to tear itself apart.\n\nClifford D. Simak (1904-1988) worked as a newspaperman for most of his life and only became a full-time writer of sf after his retirement. His first published story appeared in Wonder Stories in 1931. His novels include Cosmic Engineers, City, Time is the Simplest Thing, They Walked Like Men and The Visitors. He received the Grand Master Nebula Award in 1976."
