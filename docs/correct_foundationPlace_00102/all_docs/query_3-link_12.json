        "text": "[TOKYO – March 21, 2024] – The Audio Engineering Society (AES) has announced Akira Yamaoka and Simon Ashby as the keynote speakers for the sold-out 6th International Conference on Audio for Games, to be held April 27-29 on the Senju Campus of the Tokyo University for the Arts.\n\nA composer, sound designer, audio director, and game producer, Yamaoka is best known for his extensive work on Konami’s Silent Hill series. An innovator in the field, Yamaoka has composed for Shadow of the Damned, Let It Die, and The Medium and has also scored an original anime production for Netflix and live-action films. After originally pursuing a career in game design, he was influenced by musicians who innovatively combined art and music, and he developed a unique perspective on game sound. Yamaoka will present Sunday evening on aural innovation, including the evolution of game audio and his philosophy on the marriage between music and sound.\n\nA co-founder of Audiokinetic, Ashby is well known for his perspective on the role of sound production and integration for video games and other interactive media. He is responsible for the product development of Wwise and Strata and has worked as a sound designer and game designer on numerous projects with Ubisoft Montréal. Ashby will take the main stage on the second day of the conference, when he will examine the evolution of artistic expression in interactive audio linked to the advancement of gaming console technology over the past 50 years.\n\nDecades ago, audio for gaming began with minimal beeps and taps. Since then, the technology has evolved into an innovative form of audio expression incorporating every facet of sound technology and dramatically enhancing the immersive gaming experience. This year’s conference in Tokyo will explore the fundamental nature of interactive sound and the possibilities that innovation holds for the future of the industry. The three-day event will be filled with educational content, with topics ranging from immersive and interactive sound design, automation and efficiency in implementation, and sound production techniques for remote work to haptic feedback and future game audio production workflows along with machine learning, deep learning, and AI for audio as applied to game audio.\n\nAttendee registration for the AES 6th International Conference on Audio for Games is sold-out. Those eager to fill a slot can join the waiting list on the event details page.\n\nAbout AES:\n\nThe Audio Engineering Society (AES) is the leading professional association worldwide for audio professionals and enthusiasts.
