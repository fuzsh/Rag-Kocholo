Yes.\n\nis it the end of the world and the worst thing imaginable of what GT has become? imo no.\n\nI think these are the growing pains which I've seen for damn near every Gaas Game and this should be fixed for most, but there will always be people where the content is never enough and the pay out isnt fast enough for them.\n\nGot it! And you're absolutely right, it's very much the same growing pains that every GaaS has as they try to find that happy medium between player satisfaction and making money. I know folks don't really like to hear about the fact that these companies are making money, but this is an industry. A business, and there are people behind the scene's who's livelihood depends on making money.\n\nWith Gran Turismo, I can't even imagine how insane the cost of a game like this must be. 400 cars, licensed real world tracks, those don't come cheap. And the fact that Sony has to ink those deals with a large number of car manufacturers really makes me wonder how profitable GT is as a series. Just licensing one individual IP/Product/etc is going to take a nice chunk out of potential revenue generated by the sales of the game. And then there's the cost of keeping the game running for their long term plans: future cars, tracks, game modes, on top of patches and fixes and game balance. All of those things have a cost to it, and that cost won't always be covered up front, especially taking into account the licensing fees they've got to be paying to the various car manufacturers.\n\nSpeaking of, IP owners are also fiercely protective of their brands, and that will absolutely add to the overall difficulty of making a game with licensed properties.\n\nLike I've mentioned before, Marvel is very, very protective of their characters, so we have to do our best to make sure that we're representing the characters in the best way possible that's true to their Marvel roots and characterization. It's always a challenge, but an enjoyable one, to be honest. Even so, some things won't fly if it's in conflict with the characters and who they are/represent. I'm sure the dozens of car manufacturers that Polyphony and Sony have licensed for GT7 have strong opinions about how their cars are portrayed.\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling, but thank you so much for the insight and clarification on the GT7 situation! I haven't really been following it, and like I said, the way I've been playing the game, I haven't experienced any of the pinch and grind others have, nor have I felt the need to spend real money. Since the last GT I played was 3 on the PS2, I don't have a ton of frame of reference for the state of GT7 in comparison to more recent titles like GT6 and Sport, but it's been a pretty enjoyable experience for me so far. I have a feeling that other casual players like myself probably haven't given much thought to the structure of the game in relation to credits, but I do think they need to find that balance, and I'm sure they will in time. The game isn't even a month old yet, and these things take time to sort out.\n\nThere's definitely a ton of hyperbole in a lot of the discussion about this game lately, though. Actually, it's not even just GT7, but in general. The constant pessimism, cynicism, and just jaded negativity is certainly exhausting, and is a primary reason why I don't engage as often as I used to these days.\n\nHote Take Time: At level 206 with 195 hours put into the game now.\n\nBloodborne > Elden Ring\n\nBloodborne had a better world, lore, gameplay, music, bosses, weapons, and memorable characters. Elden Ring is still a masterpiece and one of the best open-world games ever created. I'm now craving for a remake of Bloodborne instead of a patch after putting in so many hours in Elden Ring.\n\nI agree. I'm about 130+ hours into Elden Ring, and Bloodborne is still my favorite Fromsoft game. Elden Ring is excellent, despite a few issues I have with some of the bosses, but it's wonderful. I do hope that From continues to explore open world in future games, simply because ER is a really, really great foundation for a Soulslike in an open world. Considering this is their first attempt at it, with the time/budget/resources they had for it, it's really impressive. Give them another crack it to iterate on this new formula, and it could really be top tier. The sense of exploration is really well done, and I love finding ruins, and dungeons, and forts, and catacombs.\n\nI know a lot of people have been comparing it to Breath of the Wild, but for me, I feel like it has more in common with Ico and Shadow of the Colossus; this sense of being alone in a mysterious land dripping with history that leaves you wanting to know more. Unlike a Team Ico game, though, this one does give you a ton of lore and answers to a lot of stuff, but for me, it evokes Shadow of the Colossus and Ico more than it does Breath of the Wild. I mean, Miyazaki even cites Fumito Ueda's games as being a huge inspiration to him. Not saying there's no BotW influence in the game, but I feel like SOTC/Ico are more evocative of the tone and atmosphere than Zelda. Maybe OG Zelda from the NES as well as the Team Ico titles.\n\nThis is super obvious if you followed the studio but is still cool to have ''proper'' data. Quite the stalking to find all of this though.\n\nAnalysis: Whoâ€™s working at PlayStationâ€™s new studio Haven? | VGC\n\n33% of its employees previously worked at Stadia and 70% worked at Ubisoft Montrealâ€¦\n\nCo-founder and CEO Jade Raymond (Stadia, EA, Assassin's Creed at Ubisoft Montreal)\n\nCTO and co-founder Leon O'Reilly (Stadia, EA, Ubisoft Toronto)\n\nStudio operations lead Marco Soldano (Dead Space remake and Stars Wars Squadrons at EA Motive, Far Cry Primal at Ubisoft Montreal)\n\nCreative director and co-founder Mathieu Leduc (Stadia, EA, Ubisoft Montreal, Eidos Montreal)\n\nHead of production and co-founder Pierre-Francois Sapinski (Stadia, Rainbow Six Siege at Ubisoft Montreal)\n\nExecutive Producer and co-founder Paola Jouyaux (Stadia, EA, Ubisoft Montreal)\n\nWorld/IP director Corey May (Stadia, 2K, Ubisoft Montreal)\n\nContent program manager Julien Champagne (Assassin's Creed Valhalla and For Honor at Ubisoft Montreal)\n\nCharacter technical director Steeve Ouellet (Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs and Prince of Persia at Ubisoft Montreal)\n\nEngine architect Christian Martin (Rainbow Six Siege, Watch Dogs and Watch Dogs 2 at Ubisoft Montreal)\n\nInsights director Jonathan Dankoff (Stadia, Warner Bros.
