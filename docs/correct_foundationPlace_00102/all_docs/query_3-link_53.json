CRYTEK INDEMNIFICATION DISCLAIMER.\n\nA. In case that German law applies:\n\n7.2.1. Crytek is liable for damages, regardless on which legal basis (be it contract, tort or otherwise) only if (a) such damages are cause by violation of essential obligations of this Agreement (Kardinalpflichten) for Crytek's negligence or intent (Verschulden) which endangers the purpose of the Agreement; or (b) such damages are caused by Crytek’s gross negligence or intent.\n\n7.2.2. In case that Crytek is liable for the violation of an essential obligation of this Agreement (Kardinalpflicht) without acting with gross negligence or intent then the liability is limited to amount of payments received from the respective Licensee.\n\n7.2.3. If Crytek is liable for damages pursuant to Section (a) above for gross negligence or intent of Crytek staff other than the managing directors then the liability is also limited to the amount set forth in Section (b).\n\n7.2.4. Crytek is not liable for indirect or consequential damages (Mangelfolgeschäden), loss of profits or frustrated costs if such damages are not a result of gross negligence or intent of Crytek's managing directors.\n\n7.2.5. The exclusion or limitation of liability pursuant to this Sec. 5 also applies with respect to claims against Crytek’s staff or contractors.\n\n7.2.6. The liability of Crytek with respect to death, bodily injury or health, a guarantee by Crytek (if any) or pursuant to the Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz) shall remain unaffected.\n\n7.2.7. If the Licensee is also liable for certain damages then Crytek shall bear an amount of such damages in accordance to its contributory negligence (Mitverschulden). With respect to the User’s responsibility for reduction of damages (Schadensminderungsobligenheit) the Licensee is responsible for regular back-ups of its data and in case of an assumed bug shall take all further reasonable measures. In case of loss of data Crytek is thus liable only to the extent that such loss of data would have occurred in case of a due data back-up as well.\n\nB. In case that German law does NOT apply:\n\nINDEMNIFICATION DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT FOR INTENTIONAL ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF CRYTEK, IN NO EVENT SHALL CRYTEK BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR USE, INCURRED BY LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF CRYTEK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. CRYTEK’S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO LICENSEE IN CONNECTION WITH OR IN ANY MANNER RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE) WILL BE LIMITED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY OR ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE TO CRYTEK UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE FOREGOING ALLOCATION OF RISK IS REFLECTED IN THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPENSATION CONTEMPLATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n7.3. Licensee Indemnification: Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless Crytek against all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses) and all other liability related to any claim on Licensee’s use of the CryEngine.\n\n8. Feedback\n\nYou are not obliged to report to Crytek any feedback, bug fixes and optimizations made to the CryEngine (including the CryEngine Tools) (collectively the “Feedback”).

Crytek acknowledges that it does not obtain any rights in the Game itself.\n\n9. Term and Termination\n\n9.1. The Term of this Agreement and the license granted herein begin on the Start Date and shall terminate automatically and without notice to you or any other notice when the Subscription Period expires or the Agreement is terminated.\n\n9.2. Crytek shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement for Licensee’s breach of this Agreement of any kind with or without cure notice.\n\n9.3. Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, any and all rights of Licensee hereunder shall terminate without prejudice to any rights or claims Crytek may have, Licensee shall have no right to use the CryEngine in any manner. Licensee shall immediately destroy all copies of the CryEngine in its possession, custody or control, and all rights granted hereunder shall revert, without notice, to and be vested in Crytek.\n\n9.4. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not create any liability against Cryrek and shall not relieve Licensee from any liability which arises prior to termination or expiration. The provisions of this Agreement which by their terms or sense are intended to survive shall survive cancellation, expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n10. General Provisions\n\n10.1. Oral agreements have not been made. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements made between the Parties regarding CryEngine. This Agreement and any other general term published by Crytek reflect the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to its subject matter.\n\n10.2. This Agreement does not constitute and shall not be construed as constituting a partnership or joint venture between Crytek and Licensee. Neither party hereto shall have any right to obligate or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever, and nothing herein contained shall give, or is intended to give, any rights of any kind to any third persons.\n\n10.3. If any provision of this Agreement shall be found to be invalid or unenforceable for legal or factual reasons the invalidity or unenforceability of such provisions shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement and all provisions of this Agreement not affected by such invalidity or unenforceability shall remain in full force and effect. The parties hereby agree to attempt to substitute for any invalid or unenforceable provision a valid or enforceable provision which achieves to the greatest extent possible the economic and legal objective of the Agreement. This applies as well in case of an omission or invalidity of the whole Agreement.\n\n10.4. This Agreement shall be governed and construed by the laws of Germany. Place of performance of this Agreement is Frankfurt a.M. (Germany). If the Licensee is defendant, Crytek might, if admissible, determine as court of jurisdiction the court where the Licensee is resident or the court competent for the corporate domicile of Crytek which currently is in Frankfurt a.M. (Germany). If Crytek is the defendant the parties expressively agree on the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Frankfurt a.M. This Agreement on jurisdiction applies to all claims, be they based on contract, on tort or on any other legal basis, arising under or in connection with this agreement.\n\n10.5. CryEngine contains third party code listed at the end of this Agreement or in a READ ME file. Such code is distributed under its own license terms as indicated. These third party licenses are incorporated by reference. In case of a conflict between the third party license and this Agreement the third party license shall prevail.\n\n10.6.
