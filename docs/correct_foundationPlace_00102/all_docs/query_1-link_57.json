        "meta_description": "Research areas Faculty members at the School of Information Studies are all engaged in the broad research area of Human-Information Interaction (HII). HII research focuses on three basic elements: Information resources such as books, records, online publications, sound, images, maps, and databases. Humans who behave and interact with these resources as they create, search, manage, and use them. Technologies and services designed to create, capture, retrieve, disseminate, store, and manage information resources. These may include software applications, search engines, online catalogues, digital libraries, and repositories. HII takes its roots in librarianship and information science, as these fields have traditionally focused on the acquisition, organization, retrieval, and management of collections of information resources. A more user-oriented approach has emerged to enable a better understanding of the information-related challenges that individuals, organizations, and societies face as a result of the increasing production of digital resources and online services and the widespread use of information technologies. The interaction with information has been crucial in the history of humankind. It is now recognized that human-information interaction is a complex and multi-faceted domain that requires scientific investigation from many angles. Within the broad domain of HII, SIS professors primarily conduct research in the Human-Computer Interaction, Information Behaviour & Services, and Information & Knowledge Management. Some recent funded research projects are shown below: Human-Computer Interaction Prof. Jamshid Beheshti (PI) with Andrew Large and Charles Cole.
