        "text": "To create reports for consulting work, Audiokinetic had to go through a long process of pulling all the tasks within an epic, grouping them and double checking if the time was logged in the correct month. Until doing this, they could not see if they were going over budget.\n\nAudiokinetic would have to set up a custom query per project, to sum work done in different Epics and monitor the time logged by users on these projects. It was a weekly process for each Cost-Plus project getting close to the budgeted hours.\n\nFurthermore, the reports were only accessible to management.\n\nThe container feature is used extensively by Audiokinetic. They get the Epic Sum Up Summary Panel on the right side, but also the equivalent of the list of issues in the center section.\n\nNote that Audiokinetic activated the container link only for Epics prior to taking this to screenshot in order to keep this container implementation simple and to avoid having to add Container links in individual issues."
