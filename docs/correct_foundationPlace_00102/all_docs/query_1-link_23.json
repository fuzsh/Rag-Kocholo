The art of compositing consists in merging two or more images making them look like they have been shot at the same time with the same camera and lenses, under the same lighting conditions. Applying the physics of light in a photo-realistic environment could not always be artistically synthesized in simple formulas or fixed structures due to the complexity of the light phenomena but understanding the journey a ray of light has taken from its source to get to the screen could lead to a more scientific analysis of the image composition process to replicate and emulate the qualities and artefacts of light as the eye perceive it interpreted by the lens of the camera.\n\nIn order to log the events in the lifetime of a specific ray of light, Victor Perez proposes a Mind Mapping Analysis Structure to translate the physics of light into mathematical operations within Foundry® NUKE™ nodal-based compositor. An articulated system of observation to guide compositing artists in the fantastic odyssey into the invisible.\n\nVictor Perez\n\nVictor Perez is a renowned figure in the global visual effects industry. His career spans over 25 years so far, and he has worked in many areas. Starting as a photographer and cinematographer, extending his interest to the whole image post-production process and evolving into a visual effects artist with a special focus on photorealistic compositing of CGI. Along the way, he has worked on a number of Hollywood films, including Christopher Nolan’s ‘The Dark Knight Rises’, ‘Rogue One: A Star Wars Story’, ‘Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows’, and ‘Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides’, plus many more. Eventually, he became a Film Director, and his career naturally led him to his current role as a Visual Effects Supervisor.\n\nWhat really drives Perez is his focus on storytelling. He is fascinated by how new technologies can help filmmakers tell stories in ways never seen before. His work is a fine alchemy of Science, Technology, and Art, reflecting his passion for innovation and creativity.\n\nIn parallel and compatible with his professional career as a production visual effects supervisor, Victor Perez has built a name for himself in the visual effects industry worldwide by sharing his knowledge and work with the global community of visual effects professionals. Regularly invited to renowned events such as Siggraph, FMX, VIEW Conference, and more, he has become an influential figure in the field. His insights and accomplishments have been featured in specialised press, including Cinefex, FXGuide, The VFX Voice, and Before & Afters, to mention a few. In 2012, he was voted one of the most influential visual effects artists in the world by the specialized press of Nukepedia.\n\nActing as Brand Ambassador for ASUS®, Autodesk®, and Foundry®, Perez receives sponsorship, the latest technology, and financial support for his pioneering artistic research. Internationally regarded as a VFX compositing guru, he has delivered Masterclasses on Photorealistic Full-CGI Compositing at industry-leading institutions like Pixar Animation Studios, Dneg; and educational institutes like Escape Studios, and The Animation Workshops.\n\nIn 2016, he was invited to speak at TED, showcasing his research and its connection with his personal life, featuring a live demo of the visual effects compositing process. Perez’s publications on various facets of visual effects are available through Focal Press®, Netflix®, FxPhD®, and other outlets.\n\nVictor Perez’s multifaceted career in film making has been honored with over 50 awards and nominations. He has been recognized for his roles as visual effects supervisor, director, writer, and producer. Among these honors is the prestigious Italian Academy Award “David di Donatello,” which he received in 2019 for his outstanding work on “The Invisible Boy: Second Generation.” The same year, he made history with his experimental project “Echo,” which he also directed. It earned a nomination at the Visual Effects Society (VES) Awards for Best Virtual Cinematography, marking the first time a short film had ever been nominated for this prestigious award.\n\nThrough his extensive career, Victor Perez continues to be a beacon of innovation and enlightenment in the visual effects community, bridging the gap between technology, creativity, and storytelling.\n\nSESSION 2: USD in large scale Environments: What to do and not to do\n\nStefan Bernscherer will talk about the do’s and don’t of working with USD, when working with large scale environments.\n\nStefan Bjønfort Bernscherer\n\nWhile currently acting as the interim Head of Departement for EnvGen at Dneg Montreal, Stefan Bernscherer has had a long career in VFX, with previous positions as Environment Supervisor, Lead Environment Artist, Matte Painter and Compositor with background in 3D.\n\nStefan is both a specialist and generalist, covering all aspects of post production needs, with over 10 years of experience working as a nuke compositor, 3D generalist and matte painter with teaching and supervison experience.\n\nSESSION 3: Willow: And the Network of Magic\n\nRobert will talk about his recent work on Willow.\n\nRobert Zeltsch\n\nRobert Zeltsch already started to work in the field of 3D animation and visual effects during school- and study time.

The audience’s collective eye needs to look at the right part of the screen for each shot. The camera can elevate the emotions of the characters, as well as guide you in a lovely dance from shot to shot. We allow animation to not be confined by the image frame, so we embed a camera person in animation to continuously update the cameras the animation progresses.\n\nSandy Karpman – Pixar Animation Studios\n\nSandra Karpman has over 30 years of experience in the film industry. She spent 18 years at Industrial Light + Magic, starting in the FX animation department working on such films as Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Willow, then transferred to the newly established Computer Graphics Department. She brought her production experience to the new department, building workflows and pipelines to produce multiple shots for films such as Back to the Future II & III, DieHard II, The Mask, Flubber, Hook, Star Wars Episode 1 & 2, Terminator 2, and Twister. Sandra joined Pixar 18 years ago to work on The Incredibles as the Effects Supervisor and currently works in Camera & Staging department which creates the camera view for each shot in every Pixar film\n\nSESSION 2: Advanced Substance\n\nCreating procedural art with substance designer – workshop\n\nMike Kuhn – 3D Freelance Specialist\n\nDuring his study as Industrial Designer, Mike Kuhn came in touch with 3D software for the first time. Followed by an employment as an Application Engineer for 3ds Max at Discreet, a division of Autodesk, he fell in love with the procedural ways of creating content.\n\nEven though the Substance plugin was introduced in 3ds Max already around 15 years ago it took some more years until the average user was finally able to use this powerful tool. The cool thing about Substance Designer is that it is not only for creating textures, but also to create procedural art.\n\nSESSION 3: Production Strategies for Large FX Sequences in Animation\n\nThe discussion will be about how to manage large FX sequence with lots of fire and smoke, and the strategies we have to choose to accomplish it. The focus of the talk will be on planning and designing tools/workflows that will allow multiple artists to maintain a desirable level of craftsmanship and sequence continuity.\n\nIlan Gabai – Blue Sky Studios\n\nIlan Gabai is a Sr. FX Artist at Blue Sky Studios, and most recently was the FX show lead on the 2019 release Spies in Disguise. He has been a member of the FX team at Blue Sky for over ten years, and during his time at the studio, has worked on Rio, Ice Age: Continental Drift, Epic, Rio 2, The Peanuts Movie, Ice Age: Collision Course, Ferdinand and look development for Nimona (2022).\n\nIlan is interested in solving problems that bridge the gap between physically accurate simulations and expressive animated effects, and enjoys exploring these challenges using hand drawn and procedural techniques. He holds a BFA in Computer Animation from Pratt Institute, and has a VES Award nomination for Outstanding Effects Simulations in an Animated Feature for his work on The Peanuts Movie.\n\nHappy Summer Feast Berlin\n\nWhen: Mon Sep 14, 2020 06:00pm to 10:00pm CEST\n\nWe invite you to an extraordinary event at the rooftop of SPACES at a maximum capacity of 45 people.
