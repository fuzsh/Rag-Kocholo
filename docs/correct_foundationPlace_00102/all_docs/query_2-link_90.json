        "text": "2017 marks the 80th anniversary of the publication of Beaumont Newhall’s Photography, 1839-1937. This volume, which began as a short catalogue accompanying the Museum of Modern Art’s landmark 1937 exhibition of the same name, and which assumed its familiar form in 1949 as the History of Photography from 1839 to the Present Day, virtually invented the history of photography as a problem for American art history. Written from Newhall’s position outside academia, as a museum librarian and curator, The History of Photography emerged as a chronological narrative, technical history, and pedagogical resource that addressed a general public excited by the increasingly ubiquitous medium. Although this initially lauded book soon became the primary textbook on photography in the United States, postmodern critics all but dismissed Newhall’s work during the 1980s for its apparent privileging of photography’s aesthetic value, and his contributions have only recently begun to be reclaimed by scholars who have taken an interest in Newhall’s social context and his fascination with the camera as a technology. As such, Newhall’s book now sheds as much light on the development of photo history as a field of scholarly inquiry as it once did on the medium it promised to explain. We propose a ninety-minute colloquium whose five invited speakers, chosen by open call, will each offer brief provocations and extended discussion. We invite proposals for ten minute presentations reflecting new thinking concerning Newhall’s foundational canon, analytical framework, and/or disciplinary migrations within the United States and beyond.\n\nSince the late 1970s, when the history of photography became an academic subject, and with increasing interest in photography in the art market, there have been frequent calls by various scholars for a &#39;new kind of history&#39; of photography. These calls were part of what Rosalind Krauss and Annette Michelson described in a special photography issue of October (Summer 1978,) as a renewed scholarly &#39;discovery&#39; of the medium, characterized by the &#39;sense of an epiphany, delayed and redoubled in its power.&#39; This rediscovery carried the message that photography and its practices have to be redeemed &#39;from the cultural limbo to which for a century and a half it had been consigned.&#39;1 The calls for a new history of photography suggested that the time has come to substitute Beaumont Newhall&#39;s hegemonic modernist classic The History of Photography from 1839 to the Present with new text/s.2 Newhall was a librarian and later the first director of photography of t...\n\nThe following takes a historical look at the shifting conceptions of photography from the 1950s on, identifying foundational premises which have determined the discourse of photography into the 21st century while also creating contradictions between theory and practice. Using the controversial reception history of Edward Steichen’s The Family of Man exhibition as an example, core aspects of photography’s performativity are elucidated, which conventional theory has failed to accommodate. Further, historical as well as emerging resources are identified which facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of photography’s social significance."
