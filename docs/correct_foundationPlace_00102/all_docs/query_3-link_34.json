        "text": "Abstract\n\nIndigenous peoples have had a rich tradition of utilizing digital media to tell their stories in new ways. These stories often run counter to popular Western-centric narratives that perpetually position Indigenous peoples as only existing in the past. Indigenous peoples are regularly forgotten as participants of the technological world, but we are also both players and producers of videogames. Indigenous videogames can express something about specific Indigenous communities and cultural contexts or can be made by Indigenous individuals who wish to communicate their own unique narratives through the medium. This research-creation project studies these aspects of Indigenous videogames in detail through the production of my own videogame, ​Terra Nova​, alongside a written survey of the field, contextualization of the videogame itself, and reflections on the game and the creation process. Through the production of a videogame as its primary form of research, this project seeks to draw attention to how and why Indigenous peoples are making videogames on their own terms to answer the question of what makes a videogame Indigenous."
