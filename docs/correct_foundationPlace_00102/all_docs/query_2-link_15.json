Slogan What a creative world. Area served Worldwide\n\nOK-Clowerwood International Holdings, Inc., also known as The Clowerwood Company and OK Labs, but mostly doing business as OK Labs, Inc, was an American multinational short-lived congloremate, headquartered in Mountain View, California, founded and closed in 2015.\n\nIn December 24, 2015, OK-Clowerwood merged to the new \"Balls\".\n\nHistory[]\n\nOK Labs was officially founded as \"Balls\" Game Labs, a research & design technology division by \"Balls\" in January 2015, but the foundation actually started back in September 2014. It was founded to: employ computer scientists, video game developers, engineers, physicists, mathematicians, programmers, academic and industry researches, research on science, develop \"possibly awesome, possibly bizzare\" video games on \"weird\" platforms, like printers and calculators, \"create new ways to advertise\", and \"create cool robots, among other things\".\n\n\"Balls\" Corporation, the owner of \"Balls\" Game Labs, was bought by Apple Entertainment, Inc, in 2014.\n\nApple Entertainment spun off the company, and OK Labs merged a former subsidiary Mango to itself on May 5, 2015. It was renamed from \"Balls\" Game Labs to OK Labs, after they expanded to advertising, public relations and other entertainment ventures, in May 9, 2015. It also acquired Team Chu, Vexner Laboratories, Electrodreams and SafeHome, and created Social Labs & Neta Labs in May 9, 2015. In May 6, 2015, it was announced that Daniel Gracia is OK Labs's new CEO. In May 9, 2015, OK Labs announced a partnership with Microsoft to create \"a joint start-up\", called Novus, that will develop applications for Kinect and HoloLens.\n\nOn June 3, 2015, OK Labs and Xerox founded a joint venture called OK Xerox, to sell printers, multifunction systems, photocopiers, consulting supplies, interactive whiteboards and tablet computers under the brand. As of June 2015, Jake Richards is now a chairman, part of the board of directors of OK Labs and manages the OK Labs Medical Division and Foods Division.\n\nOn June 4, 2015, OK Labs announced to acquire and merge with Hangar Telecom (a multimedia and telecommunications company), The Clowerwood Company (a food company), Parker-Robinson Hotels & Resorts (a hospitality company and a chain of hotels, spas and resorts) and Bartholomew D.R. Apple & Co. (a pharmateucical, chemical and food processing company), with OK Labs being the surviving company and Cloverwood & OK Labs being the surviving brands.\n\nOn June 19, 2015, OK-Clowerwood recieved funding from Carnegie Corporation of New York, National Science Foundation and U.S. Department of Energy. Also on June 19, 2015, OK Labs acquired assets and patents from Northrop Grumman, Apax Partners, Ion Media Networks, Corus Entertainment, Bell Canada, Edison International, AstraZeneca and Ernst & Young.\n\nAcquisition history[]\n\nSee: List of acquisitions by Stainton Enterprises#OK Labs\n\nStainton Enterprises acquistion[]\n\nIn December 4, 2015, Stainton Enterprises announced to acquire all of OK Labs assets, including Vexner, OK Labs Invisible Works and UltraNitro/Team Chu. However, OK-Clowerwood was down-sized after the acquisiton and merged to the new \"Balls\". All assets and patents bought from Northrop Grumman, Apax Partners, Ion Media Networks, Corus Entertainment, Bell Canada, Edison International, AstraZeneca and Ernst & Young were sold back to those companies.\n\nRumored events[]\n\nThere were rumors about OK Labs Invisible Works working on a car, currently under the codename Adam[2]. In some of the images found in Beta version 0.5 of OK Labs Maps, the employees are seen testing the destructability of a blue car, which seems to bear the OK Labs logo, at rumored OK Labs Invisible Works facilities at Faroe Islands and Mountain View.\n\nThere were also rumors about OK Labs moving it's headquarters to: Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Paris in France, Zurich in Switzerland or Murray Hill in New Jersey, USA. This was rumored to happen in 2018.\n\nHowever, this was prevented by Stainton Enterprises acquisiton, that happened in December 4, 2015.\n\nThere are industries that OK Labs will participate in, after January 1st, 2016, including, but not limited to: pulp & paper, amusement parks, pharmaceutical products, pet care, food & agribusiness, biotechnology, movie theaters, coffee shops, consumer goods, renewable engery, beverage, commodity, bowling products & bowling centers.\n\nOK Labs Invisible Works was also rumored to work on radio-controlled devices and a \"mini-arcade\", when OK Labs acquired the original Greeny Arcade Development Team. However, the \"mini-arcade system\" isn't Greeny Arcade 384, although OK Labs is developing it too. The OK Labs Invisible Works's mini-arcade was codenamed Hazelbrook, and uses vector and 3D graphics, has a built-in 3d motion sensor, a \"3D vision\" option, touchscreen interface, a comfortable and slick D-pad-analog stick hybrid design, a port for another controller for multiplayer games, supported multiple programming languages and programming blocks simultaneously, is supposed to drain less battery as possible, and was expected to be priced at $199,99, and was expected to be released before 2025. Some of it's features were taken from the portable Vectrex system concept, Oculus Rift, Sega Nomad, Nintendo 3DS, and Sega Game Gear.\n\nThere were also rumors about OK Labs and Microsoft deciding to merge Neta Labs, Social Labs, Novus, Snakecore, SafeHome, and Electrodreams, to OK Labs Invisible Works. This was confirmed by an anonymous employee of OK Labs, and was expected to happen during July 2015.\n\nResearching areas[]\n\nPorting to Electronics\n\nComputer Consulting\n\nComputational Linguistics\n\nData Mining and Management\n\nComputational Science\n\nAugmented Reality\n\nEducation through Video Games\n\nData Synchronization\n\nEnabling Physical Technologies\n\nConvergence, Software and Computer Science\n\nProgramming Languages\n\nApplications for Phones\n\nMotion Capture\n\nWireless and Broadband Access Networks\n\n\"Smart Home Appliances\"\n\nSoftware, Programming Principles and Tools\n\nGovernment Research\n\nMathematical and Algorithmic Sciences\n\nOptical Transport Networks\n\nNetwork Performance, Planning and Economic Analysis\n\nSecurity Solutions\n\nUse of Wind and Solar Power\n\nAirborne Wind Turbines\n\nEconomics and Computation\n\nInformation Retrieval and Knowledge Management\n\nCloud Computing\n\n\"Smart Cosmetics\"\n\nGesture, Speech Regocnition, Synthesis and Dialog Systems\n\nMedia-Rich Experiences\n\nGraphics and Multimedia\n\nHardware and Devices\n\nComputer Architecture\n\nGraphics Chips\n\nMobile Computing\n\nComputer Processors\n\nFlash Memory\n\nMobile Security\n\nEncryption\n\nComputer Systems and Networking\n\nData Compression\n\nChip Design\n\nHardware and Device Accessories\n\nSmartwatches\n\nVideo Games Relating to and Using Health & Well-Being\n\nUser Experience\n\nMicroeconomics\n\nAsynchronous Circuits\n\nHeat-Shrink and Cold-Shrink Products\n\nDynamics\n\nPhysics\n\nAdvertising Sciences\n\nAnalytics\n\nMassive Multiplayer Online Games\n\nVirtual Worlds (under OK Labs - Kids & Family Virtual Worlds Studios)\n\nVirtual and Augmented Reality\n\n\"Social Experiments\"\n\nAdvertising design\n\nPublic relations\n\nVideo processing\n\nVisual effects for film & TV\n\nConsumer products\n\nInternet service providing\n\nGraphics APIs and GPUs\n\nCommunications & Telecommunications\n\n\"Audience sciences\"\n\nExperimental music (Music will be released under the alias OKME, which stand for OK [Labs] Music Experiments)\n\nE-commerce\n\nAlternative Reality Games\n\nAnimation experiments\n\n3-D Visualization\n\nMarket research\n\nAd Exchange\n\nUser Interface Design\n\nHigh-Altitude UAVs\n\nE-Mail Apps\n\nPersonal Assitants\n\nBroadband Internet\n\nResearch Projects/Subsidiaries[]\n\nOK Labs Maps\n\nOK Labs Camera\n\nOK Labs Chat\n\nVexner Laboratories\n\nGreenyWorld Creative Engineering\n\nAnimatronics\n\nVideo Processing\n\nComputer Vision\n\nRobotics\n\nHuman-Computer Interaction\n\nBehavioral Sciences\n\nWireless Communication and Mobile Computing\n\nMachine Learning & Optimization\n\nRadio & Antennas\n\nData Mining\n\nComputation Subsystems\n\nOK Labs - SafeHome\n\nHome Automation\n\nHome Monitoring\n\nThermostats\n\nSmoke Detectors\n\nOK Labs - Invisible Works\n\nOK Labs - Electrodreams\n\nComputer Vision\n\nRobotics & Humanoids\n\nMachine Learning\n\nDeep Neural Networks\n\nOK Labs - Neta Labs\n\nUnnamed OK Labs Browser; Codename: \"Air\"\n\nWeb Optimized Visualization\n\nTime Visualization\n\nMachine Learning\n\nAdvanced List Creation\n\nLarge Scale Data Interaction\n\nUnnamed Application Framework\n\nPanorama Stitching/360-Degree Photo Viewing\n\n\"Data Mining and Conduction\"\n\nDeveloper Toolsets\n\n\"Website Building Sandbox\"\n\nDigital Asset Management\n\nApplication Virtualization\n\nFont Creation Software\n\nLanguage Creation Software, Codename: \"Maria\"\n\nMap Creation Service (partially merged to OK Labs Maps)\n\nCollaborative, Real-Time Code Editor\n\nOK Labs - Social Labs\n\nSocial Sciences\n\nSocial Marketing\n\nWeb Conferencing\n\nSocial Gaming\n\nSocial Searching\n\nVoice Over IP and Instant Messaging\n\nApplications[]\n\nComing soon!\n\nGames developed by OK Labs[]\n\nName Platform Year Publisher Notes Game engine used Balls LCD Handheld LCD toy 2015 \"Balls\" The first project to be developed by the OK Labs.

They first were going to name their company \"Nuclear Games\", but when someone said that \"we should make games that just resets other people's perspectives on action games\", Laser responded \"it could be possible, but how can we do that\". They also contacted Ubisoft Montréal, their affiliate, to form a Montréal studio. According to one employee, when Reset Studios was founded, they started making action-arcade games but expanded business to main video games, which led to discontinuation of Consumer Games Division.\n\nWhen the studio was still known as Reset Studios, it operated 3 main studios; the main studio at Santa Monica, United States, the second studio at Montréal, Canada and the last studio in London, United Kingdom, and they acquired a Swedish game developer Fatshark. These studios still are operated, under Team Skylar, but London office was closed. The studio also recruited the former employees of other well known games developers, like Lucasarts, Ubisoft Montréal, Rare Ltd, Crytek, THQ, Activision and EA. They had plans to create a video game console \"at one point\", but plans were cancelled, because they rather publish games to other consoles, than their own.\n\nIn 2009, Reset Studios released it's first arcade game, Quest to Something.\n\nIn 2012, Reset Studios released a sequel, for their 32-bit platformer, called Super Ultimate Squad 2, under the Reset Labs label, for smartphones, Xbox 360 and Wii U. It met with mixed to positive reviews and was praised for story, nostalgic feeling and music, but was panned for difficulty and in-app purchases. Also in 2012, after the layoffs at Radical Entertainment, Team Skylar hired the lay-offed staff and formed a studio in Vancouver.\n\nIn 2013, the company was acquired by Team Chu.\n\nReset Studios announced it's game Furryous at Gamescom 2014, but few months later, Reset was announced to be re-branded and restructed as Team Skylar, as the company also expanded to comic book publishing, animation and special effects. The company was re-named after their upcoming new IP, known as Skylar.\n\nTeam Skylar Minsk, Team Skylar Nottingham and Team Skylar Salt Lake announced the development of new IP in Gamescom 2014 the day after Furryous announcement. It was also rumored that a Crash Bandicoot title was in development for PlayStation 4, with release date unknown.\n\nAt GDC 2015 and TGS 2015, Team Skylar announced to develop games for Microsoft HoloLens, first one being Illumengine-powered Hired Gun Online, which includes massive online multiplayer, \"room scanning\"-based virtual reality rendering and even motion sensoring \"for realistic gun action\". Team Skylar also discontinued, disbanded and/or merged 5 labels/development teams to other studios and closed the Abu Dhabi studio, in the same year.\n\nIn June 2015, Team Skylar soon hired employees who worked at Junction Point Studios, Crytek, Ion Storm, Midway Games and Looking Glass Studios, to create Team Skylar Austin. Also in June 2015, Team Skylar sold the Chertsey and Seattle studios to UltraNitro Studios.\n\nGames[]\n\nQuest to Something (2009; Arcade) - Developed by Team Skylar Montréal, Team Skylar Salt Lake, Team Skylar Nottingham and Team Skylar London. \"You are on a quest to rescue the princess, but you need a lot of loot.
