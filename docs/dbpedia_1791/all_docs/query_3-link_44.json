        "text": "Where to stay: any of the Viadora properties are top notch; we stayed at Casa Cleo in Condesa and hope to visit the XOMA property in Roma the next time around! The best part about the Viadora properties is that it allows you to feel like you are living like a local. You’re greeted by a friendly face, have a fully functional kitchen, and the best way I can describe it as is that it “feels like home”. We greatly enjoyed sitting on the balcony in the mornings listening to the birds chirp whilst eating our healthy fresh fruits and muesli breakfast. There’s also a lot to be said for the ‘comfort’ factor of feeling safe in a big city away from home… Viadora offers all of this and then some, with a 24/7 front staff and doorman to ensure you enter/exit the property well. And honestly, another sleeper factor? Air conditioning. I’ve stayed in other hotels in CDMX on hot weeks of the year and their air conditioning was minimal at best… this is the real deal, and I slept like a (cool) baby every single night.\n\nAnd don’t forget to chase down a paleta or 2 or 10! My favorites are consistently the pistachio and oreo ones! Just type into Google ‘paleta near me’ and it won’t let you down. I speak from experience whenever the sweet tooth hits!\n\nOne of my favorite dining experiences in CDMX was also a secret one: Esquina Comun is a pop up lunch, where you have to message them for location right before. It is so very worth it, and an incredible experience! It was even featured in the NYTimes!\n\nBookstores: Be sure to check out all of the many bookstores in CDMX, or cafebrerias - they are fantastic in that bookstores commonly act as a ‘third place’ in CDMX so most have a full service cafe/restaurant in them and are a great place to open a laptop or a book and just spend an afternoonn. My favorites: Cafebreria El Pendulo, Biblioteca Vasconcelos, Libreria Porrua, Casa Bosques, and Under the Volcano Books in Condesa.\n\nSome other cool stuff to see: Chapultepec Castle, Mooni art gallery, Esrawe studio, Mercado el 100, Arca Tierra, Decada, Tetetlan Cafe, Museo Tamayo.\n\nHonorable mentions for weekend trips out of Mexico City of you get a chance/have the time: San Miguel de Allende (and stop in wine country along the way! You can either hire a car, or work with a tour company) and Valle de Bravo (book a stay at La Casa Rodavento and do not look back… it is incredible!)\n\nAnd of course if you are *really* eager like yours truly, you can always climb the Mexican Volcanoes, with the grand finale as Pico de Orizaba! I wrote more about that trip here - and be sure to always hire a guide. I recommend Climbing the Seven Summits, always!\n\nAnd if you are willing to hop on a quick plane ride from CDMX, do not sleep on surfer paradise Puerto Escondido! Stay at Casa TO, and explore all that the incredible town has to offer. But most importantly, take the serenity here as an excuse to relax!\n\nExcellent restaurants in PE include: Atarraya, Glou Glou, Spirulina, Espadin Restaurant, Fauna Coffee & Resto, Cocofam, Chicama, Sativa, Mar Y Sol, Punta Vida, Bello Puerto, Cafe Losodeli.\n\nI’ve been heading to the Alps for the better part of the last ten years now for the winter or holiday season, and thought it would be prudent to finally put pen to paper about some of my learnings and very best experiences on these trips. I’d like to think I have started to approach more of a locals grasp on secret spots out there and it just wouldn’t be very nice to gatekeep, so without further ado… some of my favorite spots and best way to spend one wintry week in the Alps.\n\nZERMATT\n\nFun fact: up until the early 19th century, Zermatt was a poor, rural village whose inhabitants mainly worked on the land and visitors were few and far between. Zermatt is of course surrounded by some of Switzerland’s highest and most majestic mountains which attracted mountaineers and explorers in the early 1800s. As a result, tourism began to slowly develop from 1820 onwards and in 1838 the first hotel was opened in Zermatt, which still stands today as the Hotel Monte Rosa. It was from here that Zermatt started to more firmly evolve into a popular sports and mountaineering destination to what it is today: the largest and highest summer skiing area in Europe, with 25km of pistes and 8 ski lifts open all summer.\n\nSomething else that fascinates me every time I read about it is the history of Zermatt’s most prominent peak, the Matterhorn. Many people realize that Matterhorn is the 6th tallest peak in the Alps, but what is often not realized is that the peak of Matterhorn is actually an African immigrant to Europe, from when the African tectonic plate collided from the south into the European tectonic plate about 30 million years ago. Geologists studying the Matterhorn have determined that the lower 11,000 feet of its slopes are sedimentary rock from the European plate and ocean crust from the forgotten seas, while the top 3,000 feet, the mountain’s peak - is actually harder and older metamorphic rock from the African plate, pushed on top of European sediment and eroded away by glaciers. Fascinating stuff!\n\nWhy does Matterhorn Focus stand many heads above the rest? It’s honestly hard to pinpoint, but a few things that immediately spring to mind:\n\n1) The staff are incredibly attentive, kind, and consistently go above and beyond to make sure your experience is top notch. I can say this because I have now been back multiple times, and have looked for flaws, and cannot find any. In fact, I remarked to my partner on this trip that Focus makes vacation feel “like it used to be,” where they truly take a load off my shoulders and leave me feeling looked after and taken care of. In a world of bad hotels and poor hospitality experiences where customers are left feeling like they need to do all the work, be more like Focus! A special kudos to Kristina and Patrizia…bravo!\n\n2) The room quality + view quality is unparalleled. I’m tempted to make a little R(oom) vs V(iew) chart with an X and Y axis for you, with a star in the upper right hand corner, but will spare you my cheesy visuals. I’ve often pondered if there’s a better place to stay geographically within the relatively contained Zermatt, and while nearly every part of town affords you some views, I can’t imagine not being as close as humanly possible to the Matterhorn whilst in town. Waking up, making an in room Nespresso, and then being able to crawl back into bed all whilst staring at the alpenglow trickling over the Matterhorn - you just cannot beat that experience.\n\n3) Breakfast and bar quality. Look, I love a pain du chocolate (or 7) as much as the next guy whilst on vacation, but I’m also an adult and have come to realize in my late 30’s that solely subsisting on pastries while on vacation just won’t cut it. So what that means is that it’s become increasingly important to me to get a hearty and complete breakfast before heading out on a day’s worth of adventures - whether that be skiing, snowshoeing, fat biking, or simply working hard to trek through snow on the way to the afternoon’s aperol spritz(es) at Chez Vrony. I remarked to the folks at Matterhorn Focus that their breakfast is the best I’ve had at the many hotels I’ve visited around the world and I stand by it. They have a muesli/granola bar, a plethora of pastries from Fuchs bakery in town (yes, pastries can be ~a part of~ a balanced breakfast ;)), eggs, bacon, a huge assortment of breads (with my favorite pine and wild honey!), an extensive fruit bar. I can’t actually think of a single breakfast food I would have wanted that they *did not* have. Breakfast of legends, for sure.\n\n4) Perfect balance of adventure + relaxation. Being on the Matterhorn “side of town” means you are the first one to the trails or to the lifts if you so choose, and have adventure at your fingertips from your doorstep. On the other hand, there’s a plethora of opportunities to simply *relax* at Matterhorn Focus - something that I know I can be terribly bad at, unless it is almost forced upon me. Anyone else love to go go go? We had a couple of very cold and overcast days on our latest trip which meant forced relaxation, so I took the time to meander around Matterhorn Focus’ spa and pool facilities. They give you everything you need to relax, including robes, slippers and big plushy towels - and even this active gal finally enjoyed the opportunity to just sit still in a clean, beautiful atmosphere. My favorite amenity is probably the eucalyptus steam room… I could spend hours in there, and now immediately need to figure out how to replicate the experience at my home.\n\nMy top Zermatt Experiences:\n\nVisit Air Zermatt. I first learned about the innerworkings of Air Zermatt from the show “The Horn” which can be found on both Amazon and Outside TV, and have spent the better part of the last 7 years obsessed with their operation, as well as the absolute top tier example/standard they set for the rest of the emergency medicine/aviation industries.\n\nIt is important to note that while they do sightseeing tours, and in fact, they are some of the most spectacular tours in the world, their primary operations revolve around mountain support and rescues, as well as emergency medicine and rescue training, which includes a flight school, as well as fire services, water survival, critical care, first aid and first responder classes, to name a few.\n\nWe walked into Air Zermatt last week for our 40 minute sightsee over the Matterhorn, but truth be told, we were just as interested in “sightsee”-ing their operations in action.\n\nThe second person we saw upon entering the facility was Simon, who we had observed perform meticulous and miraculous rescues on The Horn, and who we soon learned had also in the interim 7 years since the show become an active pilot for Air Zermatt as well. If ever there was a ‘celebrity’ I wanted to meet (not a big fan of fawning over a Kardashian!), Simon would be it.\n\nNow people like Simon give us a real reason to recognize someone as a legend and hero! Humble and unassuming - but exuding a quiet confidence … this embodies the ethos of Air Zermatt exceptionally well.\n\nEverything at Air Zermatt gives the impression of a meticulous attention to detail, perfection, and the highest standard of excellence - from the communication from the front of office, to the detailed maintenance of their fleet of helicopters, to the carefully curated selection of the most impressive staff around. I know if I needed to trust someone with my life on a mountain, these guys would be at the top of my list to call.\n\nAs a testament to their reputation, when I shared some stories from our flightseeing adventure on my Instagram, I had tens of helicopter pilots send me messages sharing sentiments to the effect of, “I’ve been flying helicopters 30 years around the world, and Air Zermatt’s operation is the gold standard,” and then thanked me for highlighting their organization. They are very clearly highly respected for every angle of their work - and one not need to look far to understand why. An elite operation in every way.\n\nEat a meal at Sonnmatten. I’ve been coming back to Sonnmatten for the better part of the last 7 or 8 years and have never had a bad meal. Better news is that if you take my advice and stay at Focus Matterhorn, Sonnmatten is a quick 5 minute walk away, and a perfect cozy escape on a cold wintry night.\n\nThe best part about Sonnmatten is the small, family-run style of their restaurant and accommodations. The same faces have greeted me over the years, as well as help me picked a cozy meal to strike my fancy (gnocchi and scallops this time around… yum!) as well as a perfectly paired cocktail or glass of wine. Not to forget my forever favorite unique drink around the world which can be tasted and purchased aplenty: a unique hay schnapps, which feels like it was cultivated from the land and curated just for your palette. You’d think they’d screw up the recipe somewhere over the years, but they just never miss. Chefs kiss!\n\nHang out at Chez Vrony for an afternoon. There are many mountain huts and apres skis in Zermatt, and plenty of good food, but for me, nothing ever beats Chez Vrony. This is hands down my absolute favorite place in the world to enjoy an aperol spritz, and I don’t see it being unseated from the top spot anytime soon.\n\nYou simply take the Sunegga lift up to walk in, or ski in, and are greeted by incredibly well meaning and attentive staff and an extensive and equally impressive wine and food menu. I’m always partial to an incredible burger - and indeed theirs is one of the best - but their carpaccio and gnocchi dishes caught our attention as well and paired quite kindly with our overindulgence of aperol spritz. Every time I sit under a blanket, looking over the railing and out at the Matterhorn on the Chez Vrony patio, I find myself asking to every companion in listening distance, “is this place really real? Can you believe where we are right now?” How can a place be so perfect? That’s not for me to say… it really never gets old.\n\nCHAMONIX\n\nIn 1741 two Englishmen, Windham and Pococke, discovered the 'Chamouny' valley and its glaciers. Their expedition was met by a rural population of mountain farmers, and a humble monastery. This community lived off animal husbandry and a sparse harvest of oats and rye. After their initial discovery, Windham and Pococke explored the valley and visited the Mer de Glace (Sea of Ice). A few short decades later, the first guest house was opened in 1770 and in 1786, two local men made the first ever ascent of Mont Blanc. Not until 1901 was a railway line finally inaugurated into the area, which finally opened the town to winter visitors, and thus the touristic seasons begun.\n\nAs we lay in bed and listened to the booming of avalanche dynamite between 5am and 6am every day from our cozy well appointed chalet bedroom at La Sapiniere, we felt like we had officially arrived in Chamonix. The town and it’s people make you feel well looked after, from dynamite to dusk.\n\nGo up the Aguille du Midi. There are views pretty much everywhere you look in Chamonix, but none quite like the ones you get from the top of the Midi. This cable car holds the world record for the highest vertical ascent, from 1035m to 3842m.\n\nSpend a spa day at QC Terme. There’s plenty of time for adventure and relaxation both in Cham and I’m a big fan of the yin yang. The same way you run 10 miles through the Alps to follow it up with an evening of raclette… you also must reward all the movement time with a bit of relaxation, as well. The spa at QC Terme is a great place to do so. Give yourself four hours or so.\n\nSkiing/Riding the Chamonix Valley. It’s world class for a reason, with more vertical than you know what to do with. Towering peaks expand into a freerider’s paradise of chutes, cliffs and untouched snow. From Chamonix, you can take the lift up Brevent and transfer seemlessly to the Flegere area. There are mid station apres for all to enjoy, and they even take reservations! Up the valley, Les Grandes is the largest area with the biggest terrain, accessible via bus, shuttle and train. For the extreme thrill seekers, book a guide to gain access to the complete Vallee Blanche. The most inclusive pass is the Mont Blanc Unlimited which includes access to all the ski resorts in the valley, plus the Aigulle du Midi, Mer de Glace and more.\n\nDon’t Ski/ Ride? You can still access the mountains multiple ways. You can buy individual roundtrip tickets to: Aigulle Du Midi, visit the Mer De Glace, join your friends for apres at any of the resorts with individual round trip tickets available at any ticket office. If you plan to do a few items listed, check out Pedestrian Pass which even allow for reservations for the Aigulle du Midi and the Mer de Glace! For the adventurous, check out paragliding!\n\nHang out at Les Caves. A trendy nightclub but without the pretentious vibe. Insider tip: you can ask for the extended wine menu which comes from Le Cap Horn upstairs and drink a beautiful beaujolais whilst hanging in a more laid back venue. Win, win.\n\nHead for breakfast at Arcus Coffee. By far the best breakfast in Chamonix. They are one of the only places I’ve ever been that has an extensive menu and actually does everything on the menu well. We switched it up day over day from eggs to omelettes to avocado toast to pancakes to acai bowls and none of them disappointed. The staff were also exceptional and the atmosphere welcoming and cozy.\n\nGo for a glass of wine at Le Bistrot des Cristalliers. What better place to drink wine than in a cave? The wine menu and ambiance is impressive.\n\nSome other honorable mentions: We loved the take out Mediterranean food at ELA (even the tahini brownie had me drooling), interesting/unique dishes at MUMMA, forever were picking up pastries and baguette/cheese sandwiches at Nicholas, and find that stopping at the Super U in town to pick up the basics/snacks is always a good idea. Also, if you’re anything like us, you need to find the occasional smoothie or vegetable while traveling to maintain some, ahem, regularity, Arctic Juice & Cafe is a great spot to find all the healthy things your heart desires.\n\nA few additional travel and logistics notes:\n\nWe found that flying into Amsterdam from the U.S. was a great landing place to acclimate to the new time zone and enjoy some food and city scenes. Not to mention Schiphol is a hugely accessible airport, so a good bet. We recommend spending a New Years Eve there if you ever get the chance! From there, train travel is king.\n\nWe found that buying a 4 day Eurostar pass was the most cost effective and efficient way of moving around for our travel plans. BUT be wary you you need to pay slightly more for reservations for high-speed trains. Also, despite their best efforts, the travel planning apps don’t have every single option. I highly recommend reviewing the regional and local train tables because there can be more options than the app may show.\n\nAlso, Geneva is a great starting ground for access to the Alps. We used to visit there often and loved the opportunity to go back. Our favorite hotel there is Hotel Edelweiss. Super clean, spacious, and great views from the room… not to mention easy walking to all kinds of restaurants and bars, very centrally located.\n\nWHERE TO STAY:\n\nInn the Ground (Carlton): A nine-room luxurious bed-and-breakfast built into the hillside of a regenerative agriculture farm in Carlton. This property was a labor of love by its owners, both sharing passions for regenerative farming and homesteading, and you can feel that love emanating through it’s walls. When we arrived late at night after a day of wine tasting in Newberg, we were weary and ready to tuck in, and Inn the Ground created the perfect place to unwind. Even at night, we walked into a burning toasty fire, a plethora of cookies and salty popcorn and other assorted snacks to choose from, and my favorite amenity: a massive bowl of uncracked walnuts to crack at a moment’s delight. There’s something so simple about holding one’s own food, even if just a 2 foot wide bowl of walnuts, and I happily cracked away well into the evening. Was I hungry? No. Was I having the time of my life? Absolutely.\n\nThe next morning was a treat, waking up and browsing around the stellar architecture of the Inn itself. We visited in November, so the leaves were still a vibrant shade of yellow, and a bald eagle paid us a visit as we walked the grounds with our morning coffee. We were given a wide selection of breakfast options paired with fresh scones and morning coffee as we peered out over the 440 acres of property belonging to the Ground (220 acres of which are pasture!) which we were about to explore.\n\nThe tour brought us all over the property where we learned how their animal stock has different roles for reinvigorating the old pastures. Cows graze the pastures, pigs till and rut the soil and then chickens come clear out the bugs and pests, thus keeping The Ground in a clean cycle of regeneration. They even have llamas guarding the chickens!\n\nOne of the most impressive feats we learned about is the water retention system. It was designed to take advantage of the natural slopes, ridges, creeks and even roads to maximize every droplet of water to refill the water table from the ground up. Here is a video explaining the depth of this project, which required the convincing of regulators to approve the project after it was complete!\n\nOf note is that The Ground is not just restricted to the property on which we stayed; in fact, they are an evolving collection of destinations and experiences throughout Yamhill County, designed to help species connect in harmony with one another. If you’ve ever heard of the famous Tabula Rasa farm, or stopped in the Source farm stand in Oregon wine country, then you’ve been part of The Ground’s ethos and experience. You can learn more about all of their different accommodations here. I have no doubt that this is just the beginning of this endeavor for its owners Brenda and Frank.\n\nAbbey Road Farm (Carlton): A working 82-acre farm, bed & breakfast, event venue and winery… so yes, it’s possible to do it all. I’ll admit: we weren’t quite sure what to expect when driving out to Abbey Road on a late rainy evening in November. Having stayed on some farms in the past which were “rustic” to put it nicely, we knew to expect different here - but not sure how different. We cruised up a tree-lined street adorned with holiday lights, and pulled up to our silo accommodations, also adorned with cute lights which made them easy to find as we worked our way through the dark night. We settled into our suite, aptly named the “Gamay” suite, which somebody must have secretly told Abbey Road is my favorite type of wine.\n\nWe awoke the next morning to a note that breakfast would be waiting for us just up the road, beyond the veggie patch. As I stepped out the door that morning, my eyes were filled with stunning shades of green, orange, yellow and red. Lots of oohs and ahhs and general feelings of delight emanated from our party as we strolled up the hill and said hello to our neighboring chicken and llama friends. Upon entering the breakfast room, we were greeted by Chef Andrew, who invited us to grab some coffee and take our seats so that our meal could begin. What followed for the next hour was an absolute surprise and delight: house made granola over fresh yogurt with stewed fruits, a raddichio salad with parmesan cheese and a citrus olive oil dressing, a fully gluten free (much appreciated by me!) homemade chicken and waffles with a maple cream reduction. I wanted to stop myself, but I couldn’t. Each dish was unique and yet also simple in showcasing the region’s God-given ingredients. I’ll be thinking about that meal for a long time to come, and it redefined what is possible for *breakfast*!\n\nDon’t sleep on Abbey Road’s wine tastings! We made sure to pop by the tasting room on our second night staying at the farm and enjoyed some beautifully complex pinots and especially enjoyed their Chardonnay.\n\nRed Hills Market (Dundee): Open 8am to 8pm daily, this is one of the coolest local markets I’ve ever been to. We desperately needed some incredible and hearty food after a day turned evening of wine tasting, and popped into Red Hills, where we were able to not only pick up a snickerdoodle cookie for my sweet tooth, a final night cap bottle of red, but also some hearty food: the “Famous Roast Beef” sandwich and “Autumn Love” pizza have been heavy topics of conversation since they were consumed back at our hotel that evening. My only regret is not actually staying at the market to enjoy our food, as the vibes were high and people seemed to be truly enjoying themselves and the atmosphere. We already plan to go back in a few weeks, and I’d be lying if I didn’t say it was largely driven by our drive to try more things on the menu. Lastly, I always feel it important to mention when you have a really great experience with people and waitstaff, too, and Red Hills did not disappoint. Both the owners and the folks running ops and day to day operations were incredibly friendly, helpful, and ensured we ordered something that would fill our bellies and hearts with glee. Take a look at their menu yourself and we dare you not to drool!\n\nBrick Hall (Dayton): A historic church in Dayton has been beautifully restored and is now a restaurant and event space called Brick Hall 1886. This restaurant is an absolute must, but be aware they are only open Saturday - Monday (and hopefully Fridays soon, too!)\n\nAnother hugely important part of Brick Hall are its people. We were the first ones in for a 4:30pm reservation (I may have wanted to catch the last light of the day to be able to showcase/photograph the food properly) and had a chance to hang out with the wait staff and Chef Nick. Upon arriving home from the trip, we reflected that Chef Nick was the person we both appreciated most of everyone we met while traveling during our trip and the reason was clear: he cared… something which can be hard to find in the hospitality industry these days. He was eager to tell us about his process, the background behind the pickling jars on the shelves near the kitchen (when asked how to find the bathroom, he replied with a smirk “hang a right at the pickles”), and ensure we ordered something we loved. It’s rare to find someone like him, but explains so much about the wild success and popularity of Brick Hall.\n\nAlso of note, one of our favorite communities, Tournant PDX, known for their seasonal farm-to-fire cooking, immersive dining experiences, and workshops, co-hosts events at Brick Hall. We had just missed an oysters event the weekend prior, and a Croatian dinner feast was happening on the day we left Dayton. Tournant are creating something really special and immersive in Oregon communities, so it’s of no surprise that they have found a true collaborative partner with a shared vision in Brick Hall.\n\nWHERE TO DRINK/WINE TASTE:\n\nNicolas Jay (Newberg): A heavily French influenced vineyard (Nicolas is French, Jay is Cali-American turned Oregon obsessed). Book a tasting and you won’t regret it. My favorite reds were their L’Ensemble and our greatest surprise was the uniqueness of their Chardonnay. As someone who has lived many years in the Bay Area in a past life and done many a Napa wine tasting involving a buttery Chard, this was a lovely surprise and opened my eyes to the variety available beyond the buttery Chard you may have become used to. The tasting team / staff were also incredible to learn from and interact with and you could see the passion in their eyes for the Nicolas Jay story. They even inspired us to sign up for a volunteer list for next year’s harvest, so catch us out there stomping grapes!\n\nI would be remiss if I didn’t give a shout out to Taste Newberg here as well (Hi Kayt!), as they and their app were a great resource for helping us find the best spots in wine country. Highly recommend using their website, taking a look at some of the suggested itineraries, and then using their Plan My Visit feature here.\n\nArtist Block (Dundee): Two words: holy shit! I’d say my wine tastes are either traditional French Gamays, or funky natural organic new age wines - either orange or chilled reds, and this place exceeded all of our expectations. We were fortunate enough to also meet the owner, Anna Sweet, and learn a bit about the winemaker (the only woman Master Somm in the PNW… we stan a successful queen!), and were very intrigued and enthralled by their vision. Not only is this beautiful space set in the Dundee Hills an incredible venue to enjoy some of the best wines around, but it also boasts a 2000 sq ft art gallery, inspires one’s creative juices by way of events and art, and creates a real communal gathering “third” place in a place where I think one is still needed. Our only regret is missing the screening of The Big Lebowski the night after we left.\n\nAs a fellow ex-pat myself (the owner’s former city residencies which she called home may be longer than mine), it’s sometimes hard to figure out where you belong in a place like Oregon, but they are taking risks and trying new things and we love them for it. The natural wines are some of the best I’ve ever tasted, truly, but the idea and concept is something to admire.\n\nThey also do a great job of curating community and events in the Dundee Hills community so it’s worth checking to see what’s upcoming when you are planning a visit.\n\nFlâneur Winery (Carlton): One of the most interesting places we’ve visited in Oregon with impeccable wines and a one-of-a-kind venue (built in a heavily renovated old grain mill!). They also run many wine educational events, host enchanting dinner parties, and have the kindest staff around. Flaneur crafts site-specific & vintage-driven Oregon wines from their estate vineyards in the Ribbon Ridge and Chehalem Mountain AVAs.\n\nI’m not sure if I have ever been so aligned with a winery ethos before either. Do you know what a Flâneur is? I didn’t either. But once I read the way they define flaneur and their brand, on the walls of their tasting room, I was sold, and knew I’d be a forever fan.\n\nA flâneur is, quite simply, a leisurely wanderer, a worldly explorer, a connoisseur of life. The word, hailing from 19th-century France, captures the idea that the mind functions best at a slow pace, and that curiosity can uncover a life of significance. It is, as Charles Baudelaire wrote so eloquently, a life of juxtaposition: alone yet surrounded by bustle, slow yet continuously moving forward.\n\nFor the perfect flâneur, for the passionate spectator, it is an immense joy to set up house in the heart of the multitude, amid the ebb and flow of movement, in the midst of the fugitive and the infinite. To be away from home and yet to feel oneself everywhere at home.\n\n-Charles Baudelaire, “The Painter of Modern Life”\n\nWe consider ourselves to be flâneurs at our core, passionate artisans joined together by the desire to slow down, observe the world, and create delicious wines.\n\nAt Flaneur Wines we live by the idea that some of the best things in life are uncovered without intention, and that life—like a good wine—should be enjoyed and appreciated.\n\nSign. Us. Up.\n\nEvergreen Aviation & Space Museum (McMinnville): One of the world’s best and home to the Spruce Goose, well worth the price of admission for the Spruce Goose alone! The museum is an independent, 501 non-profit, aviation museum in McMinnville, Oregon. Its exhibits include the Hughes H-4 Hercules and an impressive collection of more than fifty military and civilian aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and spacecraft. There’s an entire aviation wing, and an entire space wing, and there are even about 20 planes adorning the grounds outside the museum for those that only have time for a drive by. The museum was built by Evergreen Aviation founder Del Smith in 1999 and 2000 and remains an icon for the region, though has since been purchased by Bill Stoller, owner of Stoller Family Estate, who saved the museum from liquidation following Smith’s death in 2014. “It’s preservation of the history; it’s preservation of the people who took part in piloting those planes and in working in the museum, and all that they’ve done,” Stoller said upon the acquisition. The Evergreen Museum is lucky to have an owner whose heart is in the right place.\n\nPORTLAND AREA\n\nFirst things first: there are an endless amount of things to do in Portland area, from hiking to exploring to eating to your hearts content, to catching a show at one of the many small, cool and quirky live music venues in town. I saw SYML at Revolution Hall on this trip, and Finneas at the Crystal Ballroom on another trip and both shows were amongst some of the best I’ve ever seen live. Highly recommend googling your planned Portland dates ahead of the trip to see if there are any good shows on (there almost always are).\n\nFor brevity’s sake, this is primarily food and wine focused as we only had a couple quick days in town - but we hit some of the best spots and have visited a few other honorable mentions below on previous trips, and can full heartedly recommend you check out each and every one of these reccs.\n\nWHERE TO STAY:\n\nHotel Vance: perfectly located in the Cultural district, walkable to virtually everything (we didn’t move our car the entire trip, and simply walked or Ubered everywhere). When we first arrived to our room, we were delighted by the scenic views outside our window, and then focused our eyes on the abundantly spacious and clean room itself. The amenities were well appointed, and there was more than enough room for 2 of us to spread out and get some work done, chat, and relax in our own space. The bathroom was clean, the water pressure and temperature was divine, and the crab tiling in the shower wall gave me a chuckle every time I looked its direction.\n\nFun fact: the cafe BEASTRO downstairs is owned by Marshawn Lynch, and based on our firsthand experience, Marshawn knows his coffee!\n\nBookstores, bookstores, bookstores! Of course, you can’t go wrong by spending an entire day roaming around the classic Powell Bookstore, but there are so many others worth checking out as well, especially for those with niche interests. Also loved walking into Daedalus Books in the Northwest Portland district.\n\nCOLUMBIA RIVER GORGE\n\nWHERE TO STAY:\n\nArtBliss Boutique Hotel: A stunning and private getaway on the other side of the river from Hood River, perched up on a slope in Stevenson, WA. Every detail is attended to with precision, and one can even enjoy an outdoor bubble bath in the privacy of one’s own cabin backyard. A great option if you’re OK with not staying right in Hood River or White Salmon but want some privacy while still being close to the action. Artbliss is labor of love and a collaboration between Stevenson locals Tom Sikora and Tabatha Wiggins. Long time Stevenson locals, the two take pride in their community and love being able to share that love with others. Tom is a professional photographer and cinematographer having artwork in featured in galleries and publications has covered hundreds of weddings and corporate events. Tabatha is the Owner of Walking Man Brewing, a pillar of the Stevenson downtown district – known for brewing unique craft beers, serving amazing food and hosting unique events for over two decades. Together Tom & Tabatha (and many friends and professionals from the community) designed and built the cabins from the ground up!\n\nWHERE TO DRINK:\n\nHiyu Wine Farm: Hiyu Wine Farm's rustic wood, low-slung tasting room sits nestled unobtrusively against a small hillside among a riot of wildflowers. Their wines are by far our favorite from the Columbia River Gorge, and I think the secret is starting to get out about Hiyu as they have recently been featured by some major publications. I hope to keep it a secret for as long as I can, but will tell you, dear reader, it is fantasic.\n\nConde Nast Traveler describes Hiyu better than I ever could:\n\nHiyu Wine Farm’s rustic wood, low-slung tasting room sits nestled unobtrusively against a small hillside among a riot of wildflowers. It’s like a half-hidden log you might come upon while walking through a meadow, one that invites you to take a seat. Step inside, however, and the space feels far more spacious than it seemed from the outside. It’s one big, expansive, wide-open room, with an open kitchen set toward the back, and distinct seating areas throughout—romantic two-tops on one wall, a long communal table with benches on another, a fireplace flanked with cozy chairs off to the side. The décor reflects the winery’s biodynamic ethos, lots of rustic, reclaimed and repurposed and natural materials. Even the watercolor-like mural of vines and leaves looks like a detail lifted from one of the labels on the bottles. In summer, the outdoor patio is the place to be, a pocket of a side yard strewn with tables under shade sails that flap gently in the wind, beautifully unkempt vines stretching up the hill on one side and wild berry brambles and pollinator-friendly flowers filling in the other.\n\nThe wines here are complex, elegant, aromatic, and always a surprise. Bottles don’t hold just one varietal, they can hold nearly a dozen, depending on what’s growing in that particular block. They’re not meant to be pure expressions of one particular grape, they’re much more complex than that. That’s why they’re simply labeled “red wine” or “white wine” and named after the vineyards. Consider the Eventyr block, a half-acre site that grows vines of Blaufrankisch, Kadarka, Pignolo, Schiopettino, Corvina, Gamay, Vugava, and several clones of heirloom Zinfandel. It all goes into one bottle. Clearly, you can nerd out on obscure varietals all you want here—or just sit back and enjoy them.\n\nSoča Wine Shop & Bar: Well, this place feels like tripping and falling into heaven. The most incredible wine selection in the state of Oregon, without a doubt, and an incredible ambiance both in and out. Order up tapas style dishes and a fantastic wine, and take it out onto their outdoor patio where there is often outdoor music, and always incredible views. Not to be missed!\n\nTamanawas Falls hike: One of the best in the area albeit ever so slightly touristy in the ‘on’ season. Be sure to snag a permit before you get here as you will need one to park in the lot on the side of the road. Tamanawas Falls forms a broad curtain where Cold Spring Creek thunders over a 110-foot lava cliff near the eastern base of Mount Hood. This hike along scenic Cold Spring Creek has been a traditional trek for families and can be enjoyed any time of the year with the right preparation. The waterfall is reduced to a thin veil in late summer and fall, but summer wildflowers and fall colors make the hike up the creek a worthy excursion. It's possible to see the falls in winter, when the spray freezes over and forms a massive ice grotto in the amphitheater, but snowshoes may be required.\n\nWestern Aero Museum: The Western Antique Aeroplane and Automobile Museum is located in Hood River, Oregon, United States, adjacent to the Ken Jernstedt Memorial Airport. WAAAM is a nonprofit 501 organization committed to the preservation of, and education about aviation, automobile, and other historic transportation-related relics.\n\nLaurance Lake hike: This trail provides an incredible view of Laurance Lake. The trail is fairly open, leading to some great views of Mt. Hood and the surrounding area. The hike begins on the shores of the crystal-clear Laurance Lake—in and of itself a fantastic destination for swimming and SUPping. After crossing the dam, the trail begins climbing in earnest, switchbacking back and forth as it winds its way up a steep-sided ridge. The hiking is very aerobic in the first section, and a few rocky bits and steep ascents could prove tricky to the uninitiated. Yet with reasonable fitness, you'll press ahead, and make for the ridgeline.\n\nUpon arriving at the ridge, you'll, unfortunately, find yourself shrouded in trees. The grade mellows out, though, the trail rolling up and down as it continues to ascend along the top of the ridge. Occasional views toward Mount Adams will open up through the trees, but Mount Hood remains obscured. Keep hiking until the end of this route, as mapped. Here, you'll find a break in the trees, and the promised unobstructed vistas of Mount Hood will open up grandly before you! About 6.5 miles RT.\n\nI’ve been to Jackson Hole in every season, and so far, none beats October, when the leaves are changing and the crowds are low.\n\nI stayed at Anvil Hotel and I can’t imagine a better home base than there. It’s two blocks from the famous Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, all the best restaurants, and provides cozy vibes which seem to suit no matter what the season. Not to mention, their restaurant Glorietta is also *chefs kiss*. During my visit, they even had a guitarist playing oldies tunes on the patio in the evening, which I sat in my room and listened to for over an hour, glass of wine in hand. It was the perfect top off to an already incredible stay."
