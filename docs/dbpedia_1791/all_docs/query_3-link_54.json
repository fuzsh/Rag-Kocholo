        "text": "As I mentioned in my previous post, I crossed the Golden Gate Bridge into San Francisco for the first time after midnight. Then I crossed the Bay Bridge into Oakland where my motel was located.\n\nThe next day, I set out to see some of the city before our conference started. I saw some houses, mostly in variations of Spanish Colonial Revival style.\n\nIn San Francisco, you can see rows and rows of houses when you look out in the distance, because of the hills the city is built upon.\n\nI went to the Palace of the Fine Arts, which is home to the famous Exploratorium science museum.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the first Pi Day was celebrated at the Exploratorium, so you know I had to visit there while I was in SF!\n\nI also saw the city hall, which was not far from our hotel for the conference.\n\nWith my school colleagues (who had flown in — they’re not crazy like me), I saw San Francisco’s famous Fisherman’s Wharf. We ate there, at two different restaurants, twice during our visit.\n\nWe saw the island of Alcatraz in the distance.\n\nAnd, from the Fisherman’s Wharf, we saw the sun setting over the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nAnother evening, we drove up to the top of Telegraph Hill, where stands Coit Tower.\n\nApparently, Telegraph Hill is so named not due to the (electric) telegraph, but instead because there used to be a semaphore tower that would signal at a distance to the townspeople by different arm positions [far-away writing, i.e. a ‘telegraph’], about the ships coming in to port.\n\nFrom the top of Telegraph Hill, you can see beautiful views of the city.\n\nFrom Telegraph Hill, we drove down the “Crookedest Street in America”, a one-block section of San Francisco’s Lombard Street. Click that link to see a photo or read a description, as I didn’t take any pictures while driving Lombard Street 🙂\n\nAfter the conference was over and my colleagues were on their way back to 115°-heat index Baltimore, I stayed in the Bay Area an extra day (it didn’t get above 75° my whole visit). I went to see Golden Gate Park that day, which you can see as the green area in the middle of this photo, down the steep hill from where I’m standing.\n\nI saw a windmill and some turtles, and walked around about half the park.\n\nMore pictures from San Francisco can be found here. Next post: Yosemite National Park\n\nRoads\n\nI spent four days driving along the west coast. Some sections I drove I-5, when I needed to arrive someplace quickly. Other pieces I drove Highway 101, which traces just about the entire coastline through all three (contiguous) Pacific states, from Olympia to Los Angeles.\n\nU.S. Route 101 is a scenic byway in places:\n\nIn California, starting in Leggett, State Route 1 hugs the coast closer than U.S. 101, so I left the highway for that two-lane coastal road as soon as it began.\n\nSights\n\nIn Oregon, traveling north from Newport, I visited Pacific City.\n\nCape Kiwanda in Pacific City is a state park. You can see the cape at right in the above photo. Up close, you can see caves, passages, and pillars.\n\nI climbed the sand dunes into the state park area (climbing a sand dune requires some work, as the sand gives way at every step). Here you can see the other side of the cape’s point jutting out into the sea.\n\nAfter traveling north to Seattle, I headed south again. Here is a nice view of the Pacific Ocean, from US Route 101, in Port Orford, Oregon.\n\nIn northern California, I spent some time in the Redwoods National and State Parks, where I saw some of the tallest trees on earth!\n\nNear Crescent City, the road through Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park was very narrow:\n\nAt times, the scenery made me think this is what a dinosaur landscape must have looked like:\n\nI took a picture of myself in front of one of the biggest trees in that area:\n\nIn between redwoods parks, I saw more glimpses of the Pacific:\n\nDuring a scenic detour off Highway 101, Newton B. Drury Parkway through Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, I saw both a corkscrew redwood tree,\n\nand some Roosevelt Elk:\n\nNotice both the one grazing in the foreground, and the antlers of more resting in the shade.\n\nFurther south in California, after joining Route 1, I saw another Westport Beach.\n\nI saw the sun set over the ocean:\n\nThat night was a full moon (or close to it):\n\nCalifornia 1 is very winding and hilly. Most of the time you are going under 25 miles per hour because there are so many sharp curves and switchbacks. The good side to that is you get to see more of the ocean, and there’s no chance of falling asleep at the wheel because the driving is so active! The bad side is that it added several hours to my trip, and mostly at night. So I didn’t arrive in San Francisco until about 1:00am. More on SF in my next post.\n\nHere’s the first view I had of San Francisco from the north — can you see the city lights in the distance?\n\nThe Pacific coast is beautiful, and I was glad I got to see so much of it! I write this now from back in Baltimore, not far from that other ocean. Though it is good to be back home!\n\nMore pictures can be found in these three albums.\n\nAfter reaching Oregon on Route 20, I headed up north to visit my friend Brett in Seattle. Here is the view I saw of Seattle’s skyline driving in from the south:\n\nMost states have a simple square, rectangle, or circle as background for their state route numbers. Some have the state’s outline. But Washington is unique: it has an outline of George Washington’s head:\n\nBrett and I walked around the campus of the University of Washington, and saw the world’s largest book.\n\nWe visited two well-known tourist destinations of Seattle: Pike’s Place Market and the Space Needle.\n\nAt the Space Needle, I got to learn about the 1962 World’s Fair for which it was built. And saw views of the city, Puget Sound, and mountains in the distance. Here is (one of) the view(s) from the Space Needle:\n\nUpon entering the Space Needle, they took a picture of the two of us in front of a green screen, then allowed us to pick a background with the Space Needle to create a fake photo:\n\nIt was great to see my friend and catch up with him, as well as to tour a new city with a local expert! A few more photos from that day can be found here.\n\nBefore I begin to describe the west coast and my return journey (I am now outside Kansas City), I thought I would provide a quick look back at my trip on U.S. Route 20, including links to all the posts describing my travels.\n\nAfter leaving Baltimore and spending several days visiting friends and family, I started off at Route 20’s eastern endpoint in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nI took two weeks to get to the western end of 20 in Newport, Oregon.\n\nThe endpoints of Route 20 are also documented here, by US Ends.com.\n\nTen days were spent traveling westward along Route 20, with the legs of the trip as follows:\n\nBoston, MA –> Sloansville, NY\n\nSloansville, NY –> Buffalo, NY\n\nBuffalo, NY –> Cleveland, OH\n\nCleveland, OH –> Chicago, IL\n\nChicago, IL –> Sioux City, IA\n\nSioux City, IA –> Merriman, NE\n\nMerriman, NE –> Glenrock, WY\n\nGlenrock, WY –> Yellowstone, WY\n\nYellowstone, WY –> Boise, ID\n\nBoise, ID –> Newport, OR\n\nI also spent a few days exploring cities and parks along Route 20:\n\nBuffalo, NY\n\nChicago, IL\n\nYellowstone National Park, Wyoming (plus a tiny bit of Montana)\n\nBadlands National Park in South Dakota is not along Route 20, but close enough that I decided to take a trip up there to see it.\n\nSeveral sections of Route 20 follow or cross parts of the Oregon Trail, so I wrote a separate post about that.\n\nWithin the space of sixteen days, I visited both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\nRoute 20 goes an official distance of 3,365 miles, making it the longest road in the United States. With side trips, I traveled a total of 4,325 miles from the start of Rte 20 until its end.\n\nRoute 20 goes through twelve states, six of which were new to me. Here are the states, as well as towns and cities which are either major cities or of note because of what I did there. [Population numbers listed are from Wikipedia; states are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand; towns/cities are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless the total is under 1000 in which case it is given exactly.] I decided not to link the descriptions to the posts I wrote about them, as that would create a solid wall of links. Instead, refer to the above linked posts — it should be pretty easy to associate a city or activity with the right post.\n\nMassachusetts (pop. 6,500,000)\n\nBoston (pop. 618,000), capital and largest MA city; beginning of Route 20 at Kenmore Square\n\nWatertown (pop. 32,000), where I stopped at my friend Matt’s restaurant\n\nSpringfield (pop. 153,000), third largest city in MA\n\nLee (pop. 6,000), where I left Rte 20 and took a side trip into Tyringham Valley\n\nTyringham (pop. 350), home of the Gingerbread House\n\nPittsfield (pop. 45,000), city nearest to my alma mater Williams College\n\nNew York (pop. 19,400,000)\n\nNew Lebanon (pop. 2,000), entrance to New York along Rte 20 and where my aunt used to teach\n\nAlbany (pop. 98,000), capital of NY and where many of my relatives live/lived\n\nEsperance (pop. 2,000), town of which Sloansville village is a part, and where I left Rte 20 to visit my grandmother\n\nCazenovia (pop. 6,000), has a historic downtown with many old storefronts facing Rte 20\n\nSeneca Falls (pop. 9,000), where the First National Women’s Rights Convention was held in 1848 and home to the associated Women’s Rights National Historic Site; also where I left Rte 20 for a side trip to Taughannock Falls State Park\n\nBuffalo (pop. 261,000), where I visited the Botanical Gardens and ate at the home of the original Buffalo Wings\n\nPennsylvania (pop. 12,700,000)\n\nErie (pop. 104,000), where I took a side trip to Presque Isle and Lake Erie\n\nOhio (pop. 11,500,000)\n\nMentor (pop. 50,000), where I visited the home of President James Garfield\n\nEuclid (pop. 49,000), town named after the Greek mathematician\n\nCleveland (pop. 397,000), second largest city in OH; Rte 20 goes right through downtown\n\nOberlin (pop. 8,000), home of Oberlin College\n\nToledo (pop. 287,000), fourth largest city in Ohio\n\nIndiana (pop. 6,500,000)\n\nLaGrange (pop. 3,000), town not named after the French/Italian mathematician\n\nSouth Bend (pop. 101,000), fourth largest city in Indiana and home to the University of Notre Dame\n\nGary (pop. 80,000), suburb of Chicago near Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore\n\nIllinois (pop. 12,800,000)\n\nChicago (pop. 2,696,000), third largest city in the USA, where I visited Grant and Millennium Parks, saw Lake Michigan, and ate a deep dish pizza\n\nGalena (pop. 3,000), a town with nice views down into a valley\n\nIowa (pop. 3,000,000)\n\nDubuque (pop. 58,000), the first city I entered after crossing the Mississippi River\n\nSioux City (pop. 83,000), city on the Missouri River\n\nNebraska (pop. 1,800,000)\n\nMerriman (pop. 118), where I departed from Rte 20 to go visit South Dakota’s Badlands\n\nChadron (pop. 6,000), last city I traveled through in Nebraska\n\nWyoming (pop. 500,000)\n\nGlenrock (pop. 2,000), where I climbed to the top of the Rock in the Glen and carved my name beside travelers of the Oregon Trail\n\nCasper (pop. 55,000), where I visited the National Historic Trails Interpretive Center\n\nThermopolis (pop. 3,000), at the north end of Wind River Canyon and home to a famous hot springs\n\nCody (pop. 9,000), last city before Yellowstone\n\nYellowstone National Park (3,640,000 visitors in 2010), which divides Rte 20 officially into two disjoint segments, and where I saw hot springs, geysers, steam vents, a mud volcano, lakes, rivers, waterfalls, and a canyon\n\nMontana (pop. 1,000,000)\n\nWest Yellowstone, MT (pop. 1,000), town on the western edge of Yellowstone National Park\n\nIdaho (pop. 1,600,000)\n\nIdaho Falls (pop. 57,000), largest city in eastern Idaho\n\nArco (pop. 995), town near Idaho National Laboratory and Craters of the Moon National Monument; home to the Arco Number Hill; and town where I ate an “Atomic Burger”\n\nBoise (pop. 206,000), capital and largest city of Idaho\n\nParma (pop. 2,000), last town I traveled through in Idaho, adjacent to the Snake River\n\nOregon (pop. 3,800,000)\n\nNyssa (pop. 3,000), first town I entered in Oregon, adjacent to the Snake River\n\nDrewsey (pop. 18), where I entered the Pacific Time Zone for the first time ever\n\nBend (pop. 77,000), largest city in central Oregon, near forests and mountains\n\nAlbany (pop. 50,000), has the same name as another city along Rte 20\n\nToledo (pop. 3,000), has the same name as another city along Rte 20\n\nNewport (pop. 10,000), end of Route 20 at the junction with US Rte 101 near the Pacific Ocean\n\nThe last day of my Route 20 journey took me from Boise, Idaho, to Newport, Oregon, where Route 20 vanished into the ocean.\n\nSoon after leaving Boise, I crossed the Snake River into the state of Oregon.\n\nUnfortunately, like Illinois and Iowa, Oregon did not welcome me to the state. Perhaps there had been a welcome sign but someone took it down? This was the first sign I saw to mention Oregon.\n\nSoon after seeing that watercraft sign, the town of Nyssa did welcome me in the form of an Oregon-shaped sign. I guess that’s as good as it gets!\n\nI again saw signs for the Oregon Trail. Then, about 100 miles into the state of Oregon, I entered Pacific Time for the first time in my life!\n\nOregon has an amazing variety of different landscapes. When I entered Nyssa, I saw cacti growing in people’s front lawns. From there, Oregon got hilly:\n\nI went through many forests:\n\nThen snow-capped mountains:\n\nAnd finally, the ocean shore, which made me feel right at home (I grew up near the Massachusetts south shore, and now live in Baltimore, near Chesapeake Bay and its Maryland shores):\n\nAlong the way, Route 20 is a scenic byway through parts of Oregon. One piece is called “Over the Rivers and Through the Woods”:\n\nOutside Bend, I saw the Three Sisters mountains:\n\nI saw several town/city names for the second time. Route 20 goes through both Albany, NY, and Albany, OR. Same for Toledo, OH, and Toledo, OR.\n\nAt last, I was entering the town of Newport, Oregon. The last town on U.S. Route 20.\n\nRoute 20 ends not quite at the ocean, but at its intersection with U.S. Highway 101. Route 101 goes most of the way north and south along the Pacific coast, from Olympia, Washington, through San Francisco, to Los Angeles.\n\nAnd, at 8:46pm local time, on July 11, 2011, I arrived at the end of U.S. Route 20. Or was it the beginning?\n\nAlthough it was no longer Rte 20, a road continued straight through the intersection. Taking it, I arrived at a City of Newport park / beach, and a view of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis was my first time on the United States west coast (I had been to the Pacific once before, in Nicaragua). I took several pictures.\n\nThen I dipped my feet in the waters.\n\nThe water was very cold! Of course, it was 9:00 at night and the air temperature was 59° Fahrenheit. So I might have expected that! Still, I had to experience the Pacific Ocean without delay, at the end of two weeks of travel across the country from the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIt has been a fun two weeks, with lots of incidental stops and side-trips, and I have completely traversed the longest road in the country! Hooray!\n\n——————————————————————-\n\nA bit of a postscript: as many of you know, I am well past Newport now. I arrived in Newport, Oregon, on the evening of July 11. I am finishing this post from Richfield, Utah, on the return trip back to Baltimore. All pictures are from that day, and more are here.\n\nI will continue to post some snippets from the road on my way back, but not a day-by-day description like I did for Route 20. I plan to write about my travels up and down the Pacific coast, visiting with my friend Brett in Seattle, seeing the sights in San Francisco, the conference in SF, and Yosemite National Park so far. My route back, following I-70 and U.S. Rte 40, will be less meandering and more direct. It will take me through Denver, Kansas City, St. Louis, Indianapolis, and Columbus. Let me know if there’s anything I should absolutely see or do in any of those places.\n\nI hope everyone had a wonderful International Pi Approximation Day today, 22/7! If it slipped your mind [and for those of you on the east coast, 22/7 is already over], you can always celebrate tomorrow, 23/7, as Not-A-Very-Good-Pi-Approximation-But-Still-Somewhat-Approximate-To-Pi-Day. Happy mathing to all!\n\nThe penultimate leg of my Route 20 journey was from Yellowstone to Boise, Idaho.\n\nYellowstone National Park, while mostly in Wyoming, spills over a tiny bit into Montana. This is the sign for Montana while still in the park:\n\nRoute 20 only cuts through about ten-fifteen miles of Montana that protrudes south, including mainly just the town of West Yellowstone, MT, so I didn’t get to see much of the state. Here is the more traditional Montana welcome sign:\n\nVery shortly thereafter, I was entering Idaho:\n\nRoute 20 goes through a portion of the Idaho National Laboratory, much of which is top secret.\n\nOne section I was allowed into was a museum about the first ever nuclear power plant, the Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I):\n\nEBR-I proved that it was possible to generate electricity from nuclear power, first by powering a string of light bulbs, then by generating enough to power the whole building. It never powered a whole city or anything that large, it was (as it says in its name) experimental, not built for large-scale practical use.\n\nThe other major accomplishment of EBR-I was that it bred nuclear fuel. The process is explained in the diagram below. It took a sufficient quantity of Uranium-235, which is highly radioactive, to sustain a chain reaction. Extra neutrons from the reaction combined with the more-stable (and thus less-useful as fuel, but also more common) U-238, which then became the more-useful Plutonium-239.\n\nIn the nearby town of Arco, ID, I ate an Atomic Burger at Pickle’s Place. It had sauteed mushrooms and onions on top.\n\nNot far from there, Route 20 goes by the Craters of the Moon National Monument. I guess the difference between a National Monument and a National Park is that the former is created by executive order of the president, while the latter takes an act of Congress. It is co-managed by the National Parks Service, and my National Parks pass still got me in there though!\n\nHere is the region from a satellite photograph: you can see how different the black lava flow area looks, compared to the green and tan areas surrounding it.\n\nApparently, people in the 19th century believed the area looked like how the surface of the moon. However, the craters there are not caused by meteor impacts but by volcanic activity instead. I learned the difference between some different types of rocks formed by cooling lava.\n\nThese pictures were taken walking near North Cone, from which they had flowed several thousand years ago.\n\nI took another walk, around the Devil’s Orchard.\n\nAn interesting phenomenon had occurred to the limber pine trees there. Parasitic mistletoe had attached to the branches, causing the tree to direct more of its resources there and overstimulating branch growth into what is known as “witch’s broom”:\n\nI climbed Inferno Cone, which is quite steep. You can’t actually see the top in this photo:\n\nAt the top, you can see for miles. Here is the 360 degree view:\n\nIn Idaho, Route 20 is called the Peaks to Craters Scenic Byway.\n\nAlso in Idaho, significant portions of 20 follow Goodale’s Cutoff from the Oregon Trail, which many settlers traveled in the 19th century.\n\nMore pictures from today can be found here.\n\nOn Thursday last week, I traveled along U.S. Route 20 in Wyoming from Glenrock to Yellowstone National Park.\n\nMy first stop was at the Glen Rock of Glenrock, WY, which I climbed to the top of:\n\nAfter climbing up the Rock in the Glen, I climbed back down and around it, searching for the names of people who stopped by on the Oregon Trail. This was made harder because there was no trail to climb up or walk around the rock, and people’s private properties (with fences) came right up to the edge of the rock in some places, so I had to do some climbing to get around.\n\nIn Casper, I stopped at the National Historic Trails Interpretive Center, where I learned more about the Oregon Trail and three other trails that came through Casper. [See my Oregon Trail post for more details on this and the Glen Rock.] They also had some artwork created by American Indian students at a reservation high school.\n\nAlong Rte 20 in a northward stretch from Shoshoni to Thermopolis was a scenic byway through the Wind River Canyon. There were some great views:\n\nThere were some tunnels through mountains on today’s trip, which is a very different experience than driving an Interstate tunnel, like the one under Baltimore’s harbor!\n\nComing out of the Wind River Canyon, there was a lot of red-colored rock, which was beautiful!\n\nA bit further on, Thermopolis claims to have the world’s largest mineral hot spring.\n\nJust east of the entrance to Yellowstone National Park, I saw some buffalo by the side of the road.\n\nMore pictures from today are here. My next post will be about what I saw and did inside Yellowstone National Park.\n\nSince Route 20 ends in Oregon, I figured I would cross the Oregon Trail at some point. I did; in fact, several times!\n\nThe first time was in Glenrock, Wyoming.\n\nTravelers on the Oregon Trail carved their names in the rock.\n\nSome had years next to their names.\n\nI added my name.\n\nNear Glenrock, in Casper, Wyoming, there is a museum about the Oregon Trail, so I stopped there.\n\nFour different trails converged near Casper, as it was a good place to cross the North Platte River.\n\nI watched a multimedia presentation about the four trails: the Oregon Trail, the California gold rush trail, the Mormon Trail, and the Pony Express Trail. It had video, voice actors reading from diaries, and it lit up sections of the large diorama.\n\nI sat in a covered wagon that moved up and down and back and forth while a video played, the whole experience meant to simulate fording a river (including its dangers — like drowning, losing supplies, losing oxen). This reminded me of the Oregon Trail computer game that we often used to play in elementary school computer class. [Click the pictures to go play the game yourself for free online!]\n\nFurther along on my drive, a few days later, Route 20 followed the same path as a piece of the Oregon Trail. Not the main trail, which passed to the south of where I was, but a piece called Goodale’s Cutoff which was taken by some settlers hoping to avoid confrontations with American Indians on the main trail.\n\nRoute 20 traced the path of Goodale’s Cutoff more than 100 miles in Idaho, roughly from Arco to Boise. More info on Goodale’s cutoff can be found here and here.\n\nThe next day, I (and Route 20) crossed the Snake River from Idaho into Oregon near where settlers traveling the Oregon Trail crossed.\n\nIt was fun to follow along (some pieces of) the Oregon Trail!"
