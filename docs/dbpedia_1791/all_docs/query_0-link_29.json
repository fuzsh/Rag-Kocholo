        "text": "Mothman?? Jack the Ripper?? Just cancel it if you're not even going to try, Netflix.\n\nThis reboot has been such a letdown\n\nThe first couple seasons were SO fucking good!\n\nI didn't even know another one was coming out. I must have missed the third one too then.\n\nI feel like all of the seasons have had a couple duds\n\nThis show is so hit and miss. Like, Mothman? Jack the Ripper? Don't fuck me around.\n\nThe one about the girl who jumped in front of a train was heartbreaking because it wasn't really a mystery, it was just a tragedy because even if the parents had been correct, there was no hope of there ever naming a perpetrator.\n\nThere's so many unsolved cases and mysteries that could benefit from some attention too.\n\nThe train one left out SO MANY details of what happened between the girl and her parents which would have her committing suicide make so much more sense than foul play.\n\nI read an article afterwards that talked about that, yeah. I guess they made a decision to focus on the parents' argument, which is part of what made it such a tragedy to me. To me, it doesn't seem like focusing mostly on her parents' delusions will help anyone in the long run.\n\nEdited at 2024-08-03 07:50 pm (UTC)\n\nit really is a whole new world compared to the older robert stack seasons, because they also did a mothman episode and it scared the shit out of me when i first watched it as a kid. the supernatural episodes were what really paid the bills for the show to exist, something stack himself noted with disdain. it's what drew in the audience. nowadays, there's a lot more dedication to true crime than before, so i get why people are a little weirded out by the mothman episode. still, not the worst thing the show's ever done.\n\ni don't mind the talk on jack the ripper, but i recently read The Five which were about his five canonical victims, and i think it would have been better if the episode dispelled a lot of the lies and myths that surround them.\n\nthe five was so amazing!\n\nMy first thought was that OG UM had a lot of silly stories. (Remember when \"spontaneous combustion\" was a thing - a thing that went away after we stopped smoking cigs?)\n\nAnyways, I will probably still watch.\n\nLast season was absolute trash. Please tell me this is better.\n\nit's worse. a jack the ripper episode as told by tour guides, and some mothman sightings all of which are obviously just predatory birds with red eyes.\n\nthe murder/mystery episodes were serviceable, but there are only 5 episodes total this season which is like why the rush to turn this shit out? i feel bad for wanting more murder cases, but also like....i want more murder cases.\n\nNo.\n\nShoddy ghost stories/urban legends have always been part of Unsolved Mysteries though\n\nand they're always my fave! i literally have a playlist of just unsolved mysteries UFO episodes\n\nis it true the most likely profession of jack the ripper was policeman\n\nbecause i can believe it\n\nThat's one major theory. I highly recommend the Last Podcast on the Left series on the murders. They cover that one and others, as well as the political aspect of it. It's a great series!\n\nok keeping that in mind\n\nthe netflix crime docs all are pretty bad\n\nThe first season was trash anyway\n\nWell this first one on Jack the Ripper is stupid as hell. I'm stopping there.\n\nLol I‚Äôm lame I watched the Mothman one and got spooked. I‚Äôm dog sitting and I had to take her out to pee before bed and I was watching the skies lmaoooo üëÄ\n\nLoved Jack the Ripper and mothman as someone who never watched anything of them lol"
