        "text": "County in Oregon, United States\n\nCounty in Oregon\n\nMultnomah County is one of the 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. As of the 2020 census, the county's population was 815,428.[1] Multnomah County is part of the Portland–Vancouver–Hillsboro, OR–WA metropolitan statistical area. The state's smallest and most populous county,[2] its county seat, Portland, is the state's largest city.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area of the lower Willamette River has been inhabited for thousands of years, including by the Multnomah band of Chinookan peoples long before European contact, as evidenced by the nearby Cathlapotle village, just downstream.[4]\n\nMultnomah County (the 13th in Oregon Territory) was created on December 22, 1854, formed out of two other Oregon counties – the eastern part of Washington County and the northern part of Clackamas County. Its creation was a result of a petition earlier that year by businessmen in Portland complaining of the inconvenient location of the Washington County seat in Hillsboro and of the share of Portland tax revenues leaving the city to support Washington County farmers. County commissioners met for the first time on January 17, 1855.[5]\n\nThe county is named after the Chinookan word for the \"lower river\", multnomah, matlnomaq, or máɬnumax̣ being interpretive English spellings of the same word. In Chinook jargon, Ne-matlnomaq, means the \"place of matlnomaq\" or the (singular) Ne-matlnomag, \"the lower river\", from the Oregon City Falls toward the Columbia River. Alternatively, Chinookan máɬnumax̣ (also nímaɬnumax̣) \"those toward water\" (or \"toward the Columbia River\", known in Chinookan as ímaɬ or wímaɬ, \"the great water\"). Explorer William Clark wrote in his journal: \"I entered this river...called Multnomah...from a nation who reside on Wappato Island, a little below the enterence\" (quoted from Willamette Landings by H.M. Corning).(see:Portland Basin Chinookan Villages in the early 1800s, Boyd and Zenk,) Although Clark refers to the Willamette River as Multnomah, he may not have understood the meaning. Simply put, Multnomah (\"down river\" or \"toward the great water\") is the shortened form of nematlnomaq/nímaɬnumax̣.\n\nIn 1924, the county's three commissioners were indicted and recalled by voters \"in response to 'gross irregularities' in the award of contracts for construction of the Burnside and Ross Island bridges\"; since all three had been supported by the Ku Klux Klan, their recall also helped reduce that organization's influence in the city.[6]\n\nVanport, built north of Portland in 1943 to house workers for Kaiser Shipyards, was destroyed by a flood five years later.\n\nIn 1968, the Oregon Legislative Assembly referred a bill, Ballot Measure 5, to voters that would amend the state constitution to allow for consolidated city-county governments when their populations are over 300,000.[7] The 1968 voters' pamphlet noted that Multnomah County would be the only county in Oregon affected by the measure and voters approved the referendum in the 1968 general election.[7][8] Since the approval of Measure 5 in 1968, an initiative to merge the county with Portland has been considered and placed on the county ballot several times.[9][10][11]\n\nSince 2000\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2000 presidential election, Multnomah county played a decisive role in determining the winner of the state's electoral votes. Al Gore carried the county by 104,764 votes, enough to offset the 97,999 vote advantage that George W. Bush had earned among Oregon's 35 other counties.[12] The Democratic tilt was repeated in 2004, when John Kerry won by 161,146 votes,[13] and in 2008, when Barack Obama won by 204,525 votes.[14]\n\nIn February 2001, the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners unanimously accepted the recommendation of the Library Advisory Board and authorized the library to enter into a lawsuit to stop the Children's Internet Protection Act.[15] The US Supreme Court ultimately decided in 2003 that the law was constitutional in US v. ALA. However, the library chose to turn down $104,000 per year of federal funding under CIPA to be able to continue to offer unfiltered Internet access.[16][17]\n\nFaced with decreasing government revenues due to a recession in the local economy, voters approved a three-year local income tax (Measure 26–48) [18] on May 20, 2003, to prevent further cuts in schools, police protection, and social services.[19] Multnomah County was one of the few local governments in Oregon to approve such a tax increase.[citation needed]\n\nOn March 2, 2004, Multnomah County Chair Diane Linn announced the county would begin granting licenses for same-sex marriages, pursuant to a legal opinion issued by its attorney deeming such marriages lawful under Oregon law. Her announcement was supported by three other commissioners (Serena Cruz, Lisa Naito, and Maria Rojo de Steffey), but criticized by Lonnie Roberts, who represents the eastern part of Multnomah County and was left out of the decision.[20][failed verification] Within a few days, several groups joined to file a lawsuit to halt the county's action.[citation needed]\n\nAfter that, though, Linn and the three commissioners developed a public feud, with the latter becoming known as the \"mean girls\".[21] The county government has also faced significant budget issues, including not being able to open the Wapato Corrections Facility since it was built in 2003.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 466 square miles (1,210 km2), of which 34 square miles (88 km2) (7.4%) are covered by water.[22] It is the smallest county in Oregon by area. It is located along the south side of the Columbia River.\n\nThe county includes a number of extinct volcanoes in the Boring Lava Field. The Oregon side of the Columbia River Gorge forms the eastern portion of the county's northern border.\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nI-5\n\nI-84\n\nI-205\n\nI-405\n\nUS 26\n\nUS 30\n\nUS 30 Byp.\n\nUS 99 (decommissioned)\n\nOR 10\n\nOR 43\n\nOR 120\n\nOR 213\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nColumbia County – northwest\n\nClark County, Washington – north\n\nSkamania County, Washington – northeast\n\nHood River County – east\n\nClackamas County – south\n\nWashington County – west\n\nNational protected areas\n\n[edit]\n\nColumbia River Gorge National Scenic Area (part)\n\nMount Hood National Forest (part)\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18604,150—187011,510177.3%188025,203119.0%189074,884197.1%1900103,16737.8%1910226,261119.3%1920275,89821.9%1930338,24122.6%1940355,0995.0%1950471,53732.8%1960522,81310.9%1970556,6676.5%1980562,6401.1%1990583,8873.8%2000660,48613.1%2010735,33411.3%2020815,42810.9%2023 (est.)789,698[23]−3.2%\n\nRacial and ethnic composition since 1960\n\n[edit]\n\nRacial composition 2020[28] 2010[28][29] 2000[29] 1990[29] 1980[29] 1970[29] 1960[29] White (non-Hispanic) 65.7% 72.1% 76.5% 85.3% 88.4% – – Hispanic or Latino 12.7% 10.9% 7.5% 3.1% 2.0% 1.5% – Asian (non-Hispanic) 7.5% 6.5% 5.7% 4.6% – – 1.2% Black or African American (non-Hispanic) 5.4% 5.4% 5.6% 6.0% 5.3% 3.9% 3.0% Native American (non-Hispanic) 0.7% 0.8% 1.0% 1.1% – – 0.2% Pacific Islander (non-Hispanic) 0.7% 0.5% 0.3% – – – – Mixed race (non-Hispanic) 6.8% 3.6% 4.0% – – – –\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nMultnomah County, Oregon – Racial and ethnic composition\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic)\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

The median age was 35.7 years.[34]\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $49,618 and for a family was $62,956. Males had a median income of $45,152 versus $38,211 for females. The per capita income for the county was $28,883. About 11.3% of families and 16.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 21.1% of those under age 18 and 12.1% of those age 65 or over.[37]\n\n2000 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2000 census, there were 660,486 people, 272,098 households, and 152,102 families in the county. The population density was 1,518/sq mi (586/km2). There were 288,561 housing units had an average density of 663.sq mi (256/km2).

About 32.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.6% had someone living alone who was 65 or older. The average household size was 2.37, and the average family size was 3.03.\n\nIn the county, the age distribution was 22.3% under 18, 10.3% from 18 to 24, 33.8% from 25 to 44, 22.5% from 45 to 64, and 11.1% who were 65 or older.

Out of the total population, 15.40% of those under the age of 18 and 9.80% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.\n\nLaw and government\n\n[edit]\n\nMultnomah County was a strongly Republican county for much of the first half of the 20th century, but since 1964, it has been the strongest Democratic bastion in Oregon. The Democrats have failed to win a majority in the county only two times since then, in 1972 and 1980.\n\nAs Multnomah County is by far the most populous county in Oregon, Democratic majorities in the county are often enough to swing the results in statewide elections. In 2008, Democratic challenger Jeff Merkley unseated incumbent two-term Senator Gordon Smith, though Smith carried 28 of Oregon's 36 counties. Merkley carried Multnomah County by over 142,000 votes, however, enough to allow him to defeat Smith by 59,100 votes.\n\nThe county courthouse is located in downtown Portland. The Multnomah County Central Courthouse opened in 2020, replacing a century-old building nearby that was in need of seismic retrofitting.[38]\n\nElected officials\n\n[edit]\n\nCounty Commission\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict Name Notes Chair Jessica Vega Pederson [39][40] Commissioner, District 1 Sharon Meieran [41][42] Commissioner, District 2 Jesse Beason [43][44] Commissioner, District 3 Julia Brim-Edwards [45][46] Commissioner, District 4 Lori Stegmann [41][47]\n\nCounty officials\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice Name Notes District Attorney Mike Schmidt [48] Sheriff Nicole Morrisey O’Donnell [49] Auditor Jennifer McGuirk [50]\n\nAppointed officials\n\n[edit]\n\nElections: Tim Scott\n\nFinance: Mark Campbell\n\nSurveyor: James Clayton\n\nState legislators\n\n[edit]\n\nMap of Multnomah County Senate-Representative District Maps\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Multnomah County, Oregon[51][52] Year Republican Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 82,995 17.90% 367,249 79.21% 13,415 2.89% 2016 67,954 17.03% 292,561 73.30% 38,588 9.67% 2012 75,302 20.65% 274,887 75.37% 14,533 3.98% 2008 75,171 20.61% 279,696 76.69% 9,843 2.70% 2004 98,439 27.14% 259,585 71.57% 4,670 1.29% 2000 83,677 28.20% 188,441 63.52% 24,567 8.28% 1996 71,094 26.33% 159,878 59.22% 38,989 14.44% 1992 72,326 24.25% 165,081 55.34% 60,884 20.41% 1988 95,561 36.50% 161,361 61.63% 4,921 1.88% 1984 119,932 45.17% 144,179 54.30% 1,428 0.54% 1980 101,606 39.23% 120,487 46.53% 36,875 14.24% 1976 112,400 44.40% 129,060 50.98% 11,699 4.62% 1972 118,219 46.73% 125,470 49.60% 9,269 3.66% 1968 106,831 43.87% 124,651 51.19% 12,036 4.94% 1964 81,683 33.51% 161,040 66.07% 1,016 0.42% 1960 127,271 50.53% 124,273 49.34% 338 0.13% 1956 129,658 52.80% 115,896 47.20% 0 0.00% 1952 132,602 55.01% 107,118 44.44% 1,339 0.56% 1948 86,519 45.77% 93,703 49.57% 8,806 4.66% 1944 78,279 42.04% 105,516 56.66% 2,423 1.30% 1940 73,612 42.72% 97,595 56.64% 1,106 0.64% 1936 41,405 27.18% 106,561 69.96% 4,353 2.86% 1932 47,201 35.56% 78,898 59.44% 6,644 5.01% 1928 75,731 61.64% 45,177 36.77% 1,951 1.59% 1924 48,866 49.98% 21,733 22.23% 27,165 27.79% 1920 44,806 58.06% 27,607 35.77% 4,761 6.17% 1916 41,458 51.67% 35,755 44.56% 3,022 3.77% 1912 9,212 23.05% 13,894 34.76% 16,862 42.19% 1908 17,819 59.82% 9,850 33.07% 2,118 7.11% 1904 13,692 73.88% 2,324 12.54% 2,518 13.59% 1900 9,948 65.46% 4,436 29.19% 814 5.36% 1896 11,824 63.53% 6,453 34.67% 334 1.79% 1892 8,041 48.29% 2,040 12.25% 6,572 39.46% 1888 6,250 59.83% 3,996 38.25% 201 1.92% 1884 5,058 55.99% 3,880 42.95% 95 1.05% 1880 3,211 54.14% 2,720 45.86% 0 0.00%\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe principal industries of Multnomah County are manufacturing, transportation, wholesale and retail trade, and tourism. Since Oregon does not have a sales tax, it attracts shoppers from southwest Washington.\n\nThe Port of Portland, established in 1891 and combined with the City of Portland's Commission of Public Docks in 1971, ranks third in total waterborne commerce on the West Coast, and 31st in the nation for total tonnage according to the 2009 American Association of Port Authorities' Port Industries Statistics.[53] Portland is one of the five largest auto import ports in the nation and is the West Coast's leading exporter of grain and lumber.[citation needed] The Port of Portland is also responsible for Portland International Airport (PDX) in the northeast section of Portland, the Troutdale Airport a few miles east of PDX in Multnomah County, the Hillsboro Airport to the west in Washington County, and Mulino State Airport to the south in Clackamas County.\n\nOut of the 199 cities and counties located in the five West Coast states, Multnomah County ranked 198th in private sector job creation from 1997 to 2009.[54]\n\nTourism\n\n[edit]\n\nThe county is home to a number of Portland-area attractions and venues, including Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, Portland Art Museum, Memorial Coliseum, Oregon Convention Center, Moda Center, Providence Park, Washington Park, Oregon Zoo, International Rose Test Garden, Lan Su Chinese Garden, Portland Japanese Garden, Hoyt Arboretum and Pittock Mansion.\n\nIt is also home to the Historic Columbia River Highway, Multnomah Falls, and Oxbow Regional Park.\n\nCommunities\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Portland, Oregon neighborhoods\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nCensus-designated places\n\n[edit]\n\nCedar Mill (part)\n\nDunthorpe\n\nOrient\n\nWest Haven-Sylvan (part)\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\n[edit]\n\nFormer communities\n\n[edit]\n\nVanport\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nSchool districts include:[56]\n\nPortland Community College serves western portions of the county and Mt.
