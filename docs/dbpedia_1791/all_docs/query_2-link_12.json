        "text": "Portland Family Photo Pricing\n\nWHERE\n\nMy family sessions take place on location at nearby parks and open spaces in the Portland, Oregon metro area. We can shoot at a location of your choice or I’m happy to make some suggestions.\n\nWHEN\n\nThe majority of my family sessions in Portland take place during the late Spring to early Fall and are roughly 1 hour in length. Since most of my sessions take place on location, this is a good time of year to ensure warmer, sunnier weather. Use the booking form below to schedule your session.\n\nWHAT’S INCLUDED\n\nYou will receive the final edited high resolution digital files with unlimited downloads, sharing, and personal printing rights. Your photos will be delivered via a fast and easy to use online gallery that allows for sharing on social media. It’s also connected to a professional print lab. You can expect to receive around 40 to 60 final edited high resolution photos.\n\nMy family photo sessions are $400.\n\nCommon Questions\n\nDo you offer mini sessions?\n\nYes! Every fall I open a few dates for mini family photo sessions in Portland.\n\nDo you shoot maternity and newborn photos?\n\nYes! I love these types of sessions too. My newborn sessions happen within the first month after birth and can take place at your home or outside.\n\nWhat should we wear?\n\nMy main concern is that you are comfortable and are wearing outfits that you feel good in, as this really shows through in the final images. I find that casual tends to work a lot better than formal and having different accessories (hat, scarves, jackets) to play with can bring some variety and fun into the session. I’ve also had lots of families bring a large, comfy blanket to their sessions, which I recommend.\n\nDo we have to come ready with poses and ideas for our session?\n\nYour creativity is definitely welcome but by no means required. I won’t just put a camera in your face and wait for you to do something cute. I’ll give you plenty of direction along the way."
