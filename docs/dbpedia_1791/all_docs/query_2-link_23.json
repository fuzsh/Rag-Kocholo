        "text": "My family planned a similar trip 6 years ago and we simply did the following:\n\nTake the 101 straight up through Northern California (stop at Trinidad CA for a few photos of the city/ocean). Up through the Redwood Forest and then stay on 101 along the Oregon Coast. The River Rafting Opportunities on the coast have been listed by others above and are nice options. The entire Oregon coast is simply stunning and IMO can NOT be missed by a first timer to the state of Oregon. Research the Sand Dunes Park on the coast (cool sand buggy rides on the ocean) and the Sea Lion Caves to see if that is your type of thing. Google Cape Perpetua which I think is the nicest lookout point in the entire west coast. Research lighthouses and if that is your thing pick one to visit along the coast. Go all the way to either Newport or Lincoln City and go inland to Portland and I-5. At Portland visit the Columbia River Gorge and all the waterfalls along there (such as Bridal Veil Falls).\n\nNow depending on time enter into Washington on I-5 and visit Mt Saint Helens (a 3 hour diversion). Very interesting movie and visit. The visitors center overlooks the Mountain and you feel you can almost reach out and touch it. Head up to Seattle and spend some time in and around Seattle. The best waterfall in all of Oregon/Washington IMO is Snoqualmie Falls which is about a 30 minute drive from Seattle. Hike down to the base for a nice perspective.\n\nThe itinerary above does not allow you to see the interior of Oregon that much but it is such a nice intro to Oregon that it will make you want to go back and visit places such as Ashland/Medford/Grants Pass or Bend or all the inland National Forest areas.\n\nQuote:\n\nI highly recommend that you try driving 78 from Burns to McDermitt, or 140 from North of Lakeview to Winnemuca (NV) then. I-5 will never seem boring to you again.\n\nThe high-plains desert is often fascinating for an hour or so to someone who has never seen that kind of landscape before... then it gets a bit more tedious, to say the least.\n\nSome people claim that it's best to drive those routes at night. It's not as hot (especially in the summer), and there are a lot of reports of \"creepy\" or \"unexplained\" lights and atmospheric effects out there during the nighttime hours. It might make things more interesting."
