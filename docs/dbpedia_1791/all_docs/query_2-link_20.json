        "text": "CASCADE LOCKS, Ore. â€“ The most iconic view in Oregon's Columbia River Gorge, Multnomah Falls, is expected to reopen sometime this week after being closed for nearly two months due to wildfire damage.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area hosted a tour of the Multnomah Falls area, which was among several Gorge recreation areas closed when the Eagle Creek Fire started in early September.\n\nMuch of the work around the lodge is complete, however, they say some trail conditions around the falls are still too dangerous for visitors. New rockfall barriers are in place behind the lodge to protect visitors from falling debris.\n\nLast Wednesday, ODOT opened a 6-mile stretch of the Historic Columbia River Highway (Hwy 30). That included access to Vista House, Guy Talbot State Park, Latourell Falls and Bridal Veil, but does not extend all the way to Multnomah Falls.\n\nThe only access to the lodge is from the I-84 parking lot. Officials said that once the 186 parking spots fill up, they'll close the highway exit to the parking lot.\n\nVisitors can only get up to the lodge from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Anyone visiting after hours can only view the falls from the lot.\n\nAn ODOT spokesperson said they are still clearing trees from along the Historic Columbia River Highway, and it could be months before they reopen it through the Multnomah Falls area."
