        "text": "Known as the gateway to the Snake River, Twin Falls lies in Southern Idaho not far from the Nevada border. It has a population just shy of 50K and is home to many amazing attractions.\n\nWe recently paid a visit to this cool little city, spending a few days admiring its beautiful scenery and eating delicious food at a handful of its amazing restaurants.\n\nAfter our trip, we were asked by family members (who were planning to visit) which attractions we would recommend the most as they were only going to be there for one day. That gave us the idea of putting this guide together.\n\nThe format will assume you’re spending a full day here. You’ll get a hotel or Airbnb the night before, spend the next day out and about, stay one more night, and head out the next day.\n\nFor simplicity sake, we’re going to skip our usual “how to get there” section as there are too many to list (depending where you’re coming from). We’ll also assume you’ll be driving in or will rent a car on arrival.\n\nLet’s get into it!\n\nTime: 1.5 - 2 hours\n\nEasily the most popular attraction in Twin Falls is the natural wonder known as, “Shoshone Falls”. It’s dubbed the, “Niagara of the West”, as it surpasses the height of its New York counterpart at 212-feet.\n\nDue to its popularity, we recommend making it your first stop of the day (after breakfast) so you can beat the crowds. If you’re a sunrise or sunset person, this would make a great spot for either as well.\n\nFor information on how to get to the falls and when the best time to go is, read our complete guide here.\n\nTime: 1 hour or more (depending how much you do)\n\nOn September 8th, 1974, famed Daredevil Evel Knievel attempted to launch himself across the mile-wide chasm of this section of Snake River Canyon. The stunt failed, as the parachute malfunctioned and caused Evel to plunge into the canyon below.\n\nFast forward to present day and thanks to the generosity of current land owners, the ramp Evel used has been preserved as a monument, enabling visitors to see both it and the sheer magnitude of this attempted stunt for themselves.\n\nThe jump site is part of a local trail that zig-zags along the rim of Snake River Canyon and connects this to other area attractions like Shoshone Falls, Perrine Bridge, and the Visitor Center.\n\nTime: 1 hour or less\n\nGet out of the sun for a bit and pay a visit to the city’s namesake Visitor Center. It’s a small but beautiful building that features local photography, art displays, an information booth, and gift shop.\n\nIf you’re looking for more information about the area, the employees are very knowledgable and can give you great tips and advice.\n\nOutside, just beyond the parking lot, you’ll find a stone monument for Evel Knievel and a deck to view the Perrine Bridge. If you’re a Tesla owner, there are half a dozen or so charging stations here as well.\n\nTime: 1 - 2 hours\n\nJust a stone’s throw from the visitor center is Perrine Memorial Bridge. The bridge is named after L.B. Perrine who is considered to be the main founder of Twin Falls.\n\nIt spans 1500-feet across Snake River Canyon and stands at 486 feet above the river. Viewing decks are located on each side connected by pedestrian walkways offering epic views of the river and canyon features.\n\nThe south side viewing area is the easiest to access from the visitor center but the one on the north side was our favorite (pictured above). You can either walk across or drive to the small parking lot on the north side.\n\nWhen you’re done here, simply pick and choose where you want to have lunch. There are many options nearby including Chick-Fil-A, Habit, Texas Roadhouse, and more.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere it is. Your full day itinerary for Twin Falls. Obvisouly, these are just our suggestions. Feel free to tweak it to your preference and interests. After all, it’s your trip.\n\nWe hope this article about Twin Falls has inspired you to visit this wonderful place. If so, please support our website by sharing it with you friends and family on social media. You can further show support by staying on and reading one or more of the articles below."
