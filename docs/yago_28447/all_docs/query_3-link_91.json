        "text": "By Ward Dekker\n\nThe ‘madwoman’ is a recurring theme in medieval and early modern chronicles, especially when these women were in positions of power. Besides Richilda of Hainault and Jacqueline of Bavaria, one of the most well-known examples is Juana of Castile. Her posthumous nickname, ‘the Mad’, is probably not based on a condition that we would now classify as a mental illness. Many historians have argued that the framing of Juana’s mad persona was the result of negative propaganda, designed by her husband, father and even her own son, in order to delegitimise her claim to the Spanish throne.\n\nIt has become clear that the popular image of Juana as a madwoman is distorted, and this is due to the fact that the powerful men around her wanted it to be that way.\n\nJuana’s story seems exemplary: she became one of many women who ended up in history as ‘mad’, ‘hysterical’ or ‘not fit to rule’ as a result of power-hungry men. This could lead us to think that in medieval and early modern times, women in power were not accepted at all, apart from a few exceptions. Interestingly, when a seventeen-year-old Juana arrived in the Low Countries in 1496, the values her subjects hoped their new duchess would possess were quite, in our sense of the word, ‘progressive’. In a lot of ways, Juana’s new subjects expressed their desire for a dauntless, emphatic and assertive duchess.\n\nJuana of Castile in her book of hours, accompanied by Saint John the Baptist and her guardian angel. The scene is surrounded by the coats of arms of Habsburg and of Trastámara, Philip’s motto: ‘Qui vouldra’ (Who wants it?/Who dares?) and Juana’s motto: ‘Je le veus’ (I want it/I do) implies Juana’s subordinated position in their relationship. Furthermore, Juana and Philip’s initials are entwined by a ‘love knot’, symbolizing their marriage. London, British Library, BL Add. MS 18852, Anonymous, Book of Hours, Use of Rome (the ‘Hours of Joanna I of Castile’ or the ‘Hours of Joanna the Mad’) Low Countries, 1486-1506.\n\nA beautifully illustrated book of hours containing prayers and church teachings, now kept in the British Library, was given by Philip the Handsome to Juana as a wedding gift. The values expressed in this book reflect our stereotypical idea of what was expected from women in the Middle Ages and Early Modern times. The messages Philip and his advisors wanted to convey to Juana are, in our modern understanding, quite ‘traditional’. In the first picture with Juana’s image, her marital obligation to Philip is accentuated, as well as the fact that she is the subordinate in the relationship. Moreover, the sinfulness of women in particular is expressed through text and image.\n\nThis very traditional interpretation of the role of women is somewhat surprising, considering the history of women at the Burgundian court. Juana followed in the footsteps of eminent predecessors. Isabella of Portugal and Margaret of York had impressed their husbands and other contemporaries with their independence and competence in local politics.\n\nFurthermore, Juana’s late mother-in-law, Mary or Burgundy, was one of the most powerful women on the continent. Some chronicles describe her as a duchess who asserted her power through symbolism and action. Firstly, she decided to marry Maximillian of Austria without consulting her councillors. Secondly, Mary was very well aware of the ways that she could express authority through symbolism.\n\nWhen she gave birth to Philip the Handsome, she intentionally placed a sideboard of five shelves in her chamber, a privilege only reserved for the queen of France. Mary was, according to etiquette, only entitled to place a sideboard of four shelves in her bedchamber. The size and wealth of her realms could rival that of the king and queen of France, and in this way, she displayed not only her ducal grandeur, but also the royal ambitions of the earlier dukes of Burgundy.\n\nIn addition, in her Great Seal, Mary depicted herself on an armoured horse, holding a falcon. The choice for this imagery was highly emblematic, as this was the manner in which all previous dukes of Burgundy were pictured. Mary was the first woman to be represented in this fashion, and this was how she asserted her ducal authority.\n\nMary of Burgundy riding an armoured horse, holding a falcon and surrounded by the coats of arms of her lands. From De excellente cronyke van Vlaenderen.\n\nBesides the values and ideas in chronicles, intellectuals also had their ideas about the position of women. The famous Dutch humanist, Erasmus of Rotterdam wrote pieces that reveal his opinions about how a good woman should behave. Besides his ideas about women in general, Erasmus wrote about Juana herself in his Panegyric for Philip the Handsome. In this Panegyric, Erasmus praised Juana’s chastity, nobility and religiosity. Furthermore, he warned Philip against vices such as lust, violence and ambition, and declared that he would trust Juana to eradicate those vices from her husband.\n\nIn contrast to Juana’s book of hours, Erasmus stressed the sinfulness of men. Not only in the Panegyric did Erasmus warn Philip for sin. Some twenty years later, Erasmus wrote a treatise on marriage, dedicated to Catherine of Aragón (Juana’s sister). Here he emphasized that love had the power to make blind, and that women should never see a man’s arrogance and violence as strength, nor should they fall for a man’s rephrasing of their unbridled lust as ‘just being fond of women’.\n\nExcept for this more active role in marriage and emphasis on the sinfulness of men, Erasmus stressed the fact that not only men should be educated in Latin and Greek, but women as well. Last but not least, in his works Erasmus praised the virago, a woman that would not stand by idly and act passively, but who would take matters in her own hand and behave actively.\n\nSometime after her marriage, Juana had her Joyous Entry in Brussels, her de facto hometown for the coming years. Joyous Entries were important celebrations of ducal authority and urban liberty. Juana entered Brussels with an impressive pageant, and clergy, guilds, magistrates and other townspeople presented Juana with different sorts of entertainment, the most important of which were the tableaux vivants. The tableaux were staged performances of biblical, mythological or historical scenes.\n\nThese scenes conveyed examples of values and competences which the inhabitants of Brussels hoped Juana would possess or strive to attain. The first scene shown to Juana was a based on the Old Testament. The display of the story of invention of music by the metalworker Tubalcain was not only a reference to Juana’s fondness of music. The forging of the metal by Tubalcain was also an allegory of how Juana would unite her subjects under an ‘accord of peace’.\n\nA different tableau referenced antique mythology, and depicted the judgement of Paris. The three Greek goddesses, Athena, Hera and Aphrodite represented wisdom, magnificence and sensuality respectively. The townspeople of Brussels expressed with this scene that they hoped Juana would endow Philip with these three gifts.\n\nTableau vivant presented to Juana during her Joyous Entry in Brussels, showing Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons. She holds a sword in her hand and is surrounded by servants who hold her banner and her helmet. Manuscript in the Kupferstichtkabinett of the Staatliche Museen in Berlin. Scan made by prof. Remco Sleiderink,University of Antwerp.\n\nAnother important element in the tableaux were strong, heroic women; the virago who Erasmus had mentioned as well. These strong women came from a variety of traditions. For example, the biblical story of Judith who killed the giant Holofernes was displayed in a tableau. Other strong women who played an important role in the Joyous Entry came from antique mythology.\n\nTwo of the mythological women represented during Juana’s entry were Penthesilea, the warrior queen of the Amazons and Semiramis, the empress of Babylon who undertook military campaigns from India to Ethiopia. These women were dressed in full armour and rode horses in armour as well. Even Juana’s mother, queen Isabel of Castile was represented in a tableau. Being the daughter of the conqueror of Granada, the townspeople of Brussels apparently hoped that Juana would bring the same prowess and competence her mother had displayed.\n\nUnfortunately for Juana, she would never be able to show her subjects that she could be a virago. After she inherited the kingdom of Castile, she fell victim to the political plots of her husband, father and even her own son. Was Juana truly destined for madness? After the inheritance, her destiny had been set in stone; the stones of the castle in Tordesillas where she would be locked up for forty years to come.\n\nIt has become clear that the popular image of Juana as a madwoman is distorted, and this is due to the fact that the powerful men around her wanted it to be that way. On the other hand, it is evident that not all people during Juana’s age thought the same way about women in power. It would not be entirely anachronistic to replace her degrading nickname. The Spanish historian Manuel Fernández Álvarez once called Juana la Desventurada or ‘the Unfortunate’. This nickname seems more appropriate, considering recent historical research, our modern values and the opinions expressed by her contemporaries.\n\nSources and further reading"
