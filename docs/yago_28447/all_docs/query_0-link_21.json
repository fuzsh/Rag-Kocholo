        "text": "Amboise has always been a favourite stopping off place for travellers from the north making their way south through France on their way to Spain. In 1501 one such traveller was Princess Joanna of Castile.\n\nJoanna was living in Flanders with her husband Archduke Philip, when she was told that she was heir presumptive to Castile and Aragon (Salic law was not practised in Spain). This meant she had return home to be be sworn in and attend formal legal constitutional ceremonies in Toledo. Joanna's parents insisted she travel by sea. Philip said he would travel overland through France.\n\nWhat his in-laws didn't know was that Queen Anne of France (Anne of Brittany) had sent a deputation to Philip’s Court suggesting her daughter Claude marry his son Charles or that he was delighted with the arrangement. His in-laws hated France.\n\nWhen Philip said he would like to meet his prospective daughter-in-law, Anne invited him and Joanna to break their journey at the French Court in Blois.\n\nAnne was very keen that this particular marriage should come about. The only alternative was François of Angoulème. Louis XII disliked and disapproved of François whereas Anne positively loathed him.\n\nWhen Joanna, who couldn't bear to be apart from Philip, decided to go with him and travel on horseback despite the foul weather and bad roads, Queen Anne sent Madame de Vendôme with fourteen ladies of the French Court to wait on her as she travelled through France from one town to the next.\n\nJoanna and Philip arrived at Château Blois December 7 1501. They stayed in luxurious apartments richly tapestried and furnished especially for their visit. When Philip entered the king’s presence, he bent his knee three times as he neared the throne. Louis doffed his cap at each bow before rising, advancing and embracing Philip.\n\nThat was appropriate for an Archduke but Joanna was heiress to the Spanish throne. Invited to kiss the King she asked advice from her ministers. When she arrived at the door of the throne room Louis rushed over to prevent her curtseying more than once.\n\nJoanna then went to pay her respects to Queen Anne. She began making her way to the door but there was such a crush of people wanting to get a glimpse of her it took her some time to get through.\n\nAnne was on her throne in front of the fire. She and Joanna curtseyed, kissed and made small talk. Joanna saluted the women on either side of the throne and left for her private apartment.\n\nAt the door of her antechamber she was met by her future daughter in law, two year old Claude, in the arms of her governess. The toddler took one look at Juana and burst into tears. She was taken away screaming at the top of her lungs.\n\nWhen Joanna and Philip left Château Blois 15 December 1501 Louis and his courtiers went with them to Château Amboise. Their next destination, Cognac, was a hundred and fifty miles away. It was a further five hundred to Toledo, their final destination. Small wonder Joanna, who was pregnant, stayed behind when Philip returned to Flanders.\n\nIn Spain Joanna is known as Juana la Loco (Joanna the Mad). Today, she would probably be diagnosed as clinically depressed. It's hardly surprising. Her mother Queen Isabella instigated the brutal Spanish Inquisition. Joanna was terrified of her. For good reason. When she showed no interest in religion she was suspended by a rope upside down with weights until she confessed to being a heretic.\n\nShe was quickly married off to Archduke Philip, called the Handsome, of Austria who lived in the Netherlands. After a dangerous month at sea (three ships she sailed on sunk) Joanna finally arrived in a cold foreign land far away from home having suffered chronic seasickness and a fever. Philip did not meet her.\n\nShe found it very hard to adjust to life - and the cold weather - in the Low Countries. Her husband's subjects resented the Spaniards and ignored her. She looked to Philip for comfort and support but received none.\n\nJoanna had her first child at seventeen, her second at eighteen and suffered badly from severe post natal depression both times. Then came a succession of family tragedies. In October 1497, Joanna’s only brother died very suddenly. His death was followed shortly afterwards by her sister Isabella, after giving birth to a son, Miguel, heir to the thrones of Portugal, Castile, and Aragon. Miguel died shortly before his second birthday leaving Joanna heir presumptive.\n\nAlthough homesick and suffering post natal depression the most stress she suffered was Philip's rampant and blatant infidelity. When an already fragile Joanna who was deeply in love with Philip flew into jealous rages he refused to see her. She sobbed all day and night.\n\nDespite attempts to win her husband which included changing her hair styles and making love potions, Philip ordered Joanna’s treasurer to keep a detailed diary of her actions to send to her parents.\n\nThe stress was made worse when she became an heiress. Philip who wanted to rule alone as King of Spain tried to wrest her inheritance from her. He betrayed her by telling his in-laws she was not fit to rule.\n\nWhen Joanna had a complete mental breakdown, her mother had her locked up.\n\nAlthough Joanna lived to be seventy-five well past the life expectancy of the time, forty five of those years were spent in isolated imprisonment.\n\nJoanna's youngest sister Catherine fared no better with her husband. He was Henry VIII.\n\nDid Joanna's son Charles marry Claude? No. In 1506 Louis XII proclaimed in his will that Claude must marry François d’ Angoulème (François I). Charles became Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Archduke of Austria, King of Spain, Lord of the Netherlands and Duke of Burgundy.\n\nDid Philip become King of Spain? Yes, for a few months only (he died suddenly).\n\nPost by Pamela, photography by Mark."
