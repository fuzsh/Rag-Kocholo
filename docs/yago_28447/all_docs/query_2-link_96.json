        "text": "The Hours of Joanna I of Castile, Joanna the Mad\n\nc. 1500\n\nCreated by two ateliers\n\nBritish Library, London\n\nBound in brown leather embossed with gold\n\nAbout 237 x 163 mm\n\nAlthough the creator of the Hours of Joanna I of Castile is not known, much is known about Joanna herself, whom the book was created for. She had a strong character and over time became known as Juana La Loca, or Crazy Jo. Her parents, Ferdinand and Isabella, lived in Spain. She was very educated as a child and since birth was being shaped into a fit future wife. Joanna was betrothed to a man while she was still an infant. The man was Philip of Flanders, the Duke of Burgundy and also the song of the Emperor Maximillian of Rome. She met him when she was seventeen and it is said that they fell in love at first sight. Despite their attraction to each other, Philip did not remain faithful, which made her very jealous. Joanna cut off all the hair of one of his mistresses, which was unspeakable behavior from a queen. Philip also tried to overrule all of her power as Princess of Castile. By 1502, all of her family members in line for the throne passed away and she was to take the throne of Castile, but her father took her place and told others that Joanna was too unstable to rule. Philip and Ferdinand attempted to rule together when Philip died suddenly of typhoid, but some say that Ferdinand had poisoned him. Joanna was so grieved over his death, despite his disregard for her wellbeing, and some say that she set out on a lengthy trek to bury her husband, and that each night she opened his coffin to talk to him. As things started to go wrong in the kingdom, the king shut Joanna in the Santa Clara convent and continued to tell the public that she was mad. It has been said that this confinement deteriorated her mental stability if it had not been damaged already. Her son soon took over and left her confined. Her sister lived with her for some time until she was taken away to marry King Juan III. Joanna died at the age of 76. Whether or not she was actually mad has been debated for many years, but most agree that she suffered from depression and possibly bipolar disorder. It is also agreed upon that this is one of the most tragic stories among those of the Spanish queens.\n\nThis Renaissance piece of art is full of gold and other colors, which alludes to its intention for royalty. It contains prayers and pictures of St. John and Litany and Suffrages. Because of the number of Spanish saints featured, it is believed that the book was commissioned by the Spanish court.\n\nThe first image is a portrayal of the Three Living and the Three Dead, which is story that illustrates the medieval idea that death is reality for all. The center of the picture portrays a woman who is riding a horse who is being pursued by death. Because of the dogs at her side and the bird on her arm, most believe that she is being chased while she is on a hunt.\n\nSome believe that Joanna’s sister-in-law had it made for her as a gift. Joanna was said to have a devotion to the native saints of Spain, which would confirm this idea, but a few other hypothesis of its origins are debated.\n\nFaithfulness\n\nAn important emotion that results from the loving relationship with God is faithfulness. This is a tragic story that seems unfair and dark, but Joanna saw beauty and importance in the saints that came from her nation, which demonstrates her faithfulness despite the tragedy that surrounded her life. She was faithful to her country and to the saints that were important to her.\n\nHowever, faithfulness is better seen in another way. Although this story is horribly tragic, God remained faithful to Joanna throughout her life. God is always just and merciful and I believe that He was in the midst of this story despite its desperation and heartbreak.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nhttp://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/\n\nhttp://guides.wikinut.com/Real-people-from-history.-Joanna-of-Castile./14g6nlvh/\n\nhttp://www.historyandwomen.com/2013/01/the-vida-loca-joanna-of-castile.html"
