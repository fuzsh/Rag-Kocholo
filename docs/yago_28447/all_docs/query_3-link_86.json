        "text": "In 1500, in Ghent, Charles V was born, who would become Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Spain, controlling the largest domain, which included the newly conquered Americas. His father was Philip the Handsome, a German prince who married the Joanna I, daughter of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castille. The marriage was complicated, as Philip tried to consolidate his power in Spain. Then in 1506 he died. Joanna was distraught, paving her nickname \"Joanna the Mad\", and paved the way for her son Charles V.\n\nWhat if, in 1500, Joanna's gets complications during the childbirth, leading to the deaths of both the mother and the child.\n\nHow would this effect the Spanish line of succession? What happens to Philip the Handsome?\n\nassuming that Miguel da Paz dies his otl death later that year then Eleanor of Austria will be heiress to all of Spain, shipped off to be raised there, and betrothed to a Portuguese cousin (or possibly https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_de_Aragón_y_Portugal but I think a Portuguese cousin is far more likely). Philip the handsome will remarry, probably to a French proxy or a jagiellon girl, and most likely has a son by her who inherits his realms\n\nAs for long term effects I think things will be much better here for both Spain and the hre as I doubt a Habsburg emperor who isn’t bogged down with Spain will allow the religious situation to get as out of hand as it did otl and they also will keep direct control of the lucrative Low Countries. Spain will benefit without the drain of money and men to the Low Countries that occurred later in the century IOTL but watch this space cause I think the influx of gold from the new world may cause some problems anyways? Idk\n\nassuming that Miguel da Paz dies his otl death later that year then Eleanor of Austria will be heiress to all of Spain, shipped off to be raised there, and betrothed to a Portuguese cousin (or possibly https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_de_Aragón_y_Portugal but I think a Portuguese cousin is far more likely). Philip the handsome will remarry, probably to a French proxy or a jagiellon girl, and most likely has a son by her who inherits his realms\n\nFerdinand II will be the one to choose Eleanor’s husband so it could go both ways\n\nPhilip would probably remarry in short order since his father has no other sons from his subsequent marriages and his sister Margaret is equally childless so the entire Austrian and Burgundian inheritance rests on the fate of a two year girl.\n\nSince all their daughters are spoken for perhaps Ferdinand and Isabella suggest the widowed Joanna of Naples for Philip in order to preserve the Trastamara connection to Burgundy? As long as he gets a son the Eleanor can become the Spanish heiress while the boy continues the Habsburg line in Austria and Burgundy.\n\nPhilip would remarry, but would not accept another useless match forced by his father so he would not marry Joanna of Naples for sure. Either Maximilian is able to persuade his son to a Jagiellon match or he will get a match useful to Burgundy so either England or France. Unluckily René II of Lorraine has no daughter in the right age range so I would say who Philip will most likely remarry to Germaine of Foix\n\nFerdinand II will be the one to choose Eleanor’s husband so it could go both ways\n\nPhilip would remarry, but would not accept another useless match forced by his father so he would not marry Joanna of Naples for sure.

Unluckily René II of Lorraine has no daughter in the right age range so I would say who Philip will most likely remarry to Germaine of Foix\n\nEleanor can either marry Henry II of Navarre or John III of Portugal...\n\nHenry II of Navarre is not a realistic option as would be an useless match for her. She will marry either Alfonso of Ampurias or John III of Portugal, depending from what Ferdinand II will see as the best option (adding Portugal to the union of Aragon and Castile marrying his grandchildren or keeping the union of Castile and Aragon under the Trastramara dynasty marrying Eleanor to Alfonso) as either match would secure the Crown of Aragon to Eleanor\n\nAn Alfonso match is the one I would go with as he's older and would be able to cement his and Eleanor's reign faster to prevent a power vacuum after Isabella's death.\n\nSo England probably immediately starts offering Margaret Tudor to Philip - right? It's a match that makes the most sense and prevents him from ending up in an alliance with France, who will likely offer him lesser Princesses. And for James IV, Cecily is a year widowed at this point, and probably offered in lieu of Bridget the Nun. Or they might really push their luck and try and get James IV to accept a betrothal with the 4 year old Princess Mary. Most likely, James IV throws his hands in the air and marries a French proxy. Maybe Germaine of Foix.\n\nSo England probably immediately starts offering Margaret Tudor to Philip - right?

Maybe Germaine of Foix.\n\nPerhaps James marries Margaret of Austria?\n\nThe one thing I wonder about is the 'raised in Spain' proposition for Eleanor. From Philip's perspective she's still his heir until he has a son and having custody of her gives him useful leverage against Ferdinand. So wouldn't he at least hold on to her until he has a son a few years old.\n\nIf he remarried quickly and has a son born immediately, maybe late 1502 I would think he'd wait until the boy was a few years old and they could be sure he'd survive before he'd even be willing to release Eleanor to her grandparents. So that would mean she could very well still be in Brussels when her grandmother died and she becomes Queen of Castile. Philip being ambitious could he try and contest a Castilian regency with Ferdinand?\n\nSo England probably immediately starts offering Margaret Tudor to Philip - right?

And I think Philip could try to be named regent of Castile but it would never happen\n\nSo England probably immediately starts offering Margaret Tudor to Philip - right?

Germaine is older and Louis XII’s own blood niece and a more interesting match for Philip (and she would not marry James)\n\nThe one thing I wonder about is the 'raised in Spain' proposition for Eleanor.

Philip being ambitious could he try and contest a Castilian regency with Ferdinand?\n\nEither Eleanor is given to the custody of her grandparents or Maria would become heiress of Castile and Aragon. OTL Miguel was heir of Portugal and still was under Isabella’s custody\n\nIsabella’s ATL last will would name Ferdinand as regent for Eleanor’s minority or Maria as heiress if Eleanor is still in Castile\n\nCould there be support for Maria of Aragon to become heiress based on proximity of blood? Did the Iberians even care about proximity of blood, or was that exclusively a French/Imperial thing?\n\nMaria and her children would be heirs after Eleanor.\n\nIn theory, but if Eleanor is in Burgundy under her father’s custody is not unlikely who Isabella would name Maria as heiress as she was tempted to do it OTL\n\nUnlikely who Margaret would be offered to Philip or who he would accept. Germaine is older and Louis XII’s own blood niece and a more interesting match for Philip (and she would not marry James)\n\nIsn't Germaine a little young? She'd only be 12 when Joanna dies so would Philip be willing to wait a few years when he really needs an heir. Though I could see her being used in a political gambit if he's trying to ring some kind of concession out of Ferdinand. Louis and Ferdinand resumed their fighting over in Naples in 1502 so if Philip doesn't conclude a marriage before then presumably the two sides would be competing for influence.\n\nEither Eleanor is given to the custody of her grandparents or Maria would become heiress of Castile and Aragon. OTL Miguel was heir of Portugal and still was under Isabella’s custody\n\nIsabella’s ATL last will would name Ferdinand as regent for Eleanor’s minority or Maria as heiress if Eleanor is still in Castile\n\nYou're speaking of Isabella I, Joanna's mother and Miguel's grandmother correct? Not Isabella of Aragon, Isabella I's daughter and Miguel's mother. I read it as the latter at first but you're right, if its the former then Isabella I would presumably regulate the succession in her will and if Philip is being recalcitrant and holding Eleanor in Brussels then she could be disinherited in favor of Maria.\n\nI guess, regardless, its a political minefield. But with Isabella's will and Ferdinand's strength as King of Aragon any claim Philip makes could be neutralized. So if he falls out with Ferdinand and Isabella does he just make a French match and throw in his lot with Louis XII or does he heed his father and marry a Jagiellon and sulk in Brussels."
