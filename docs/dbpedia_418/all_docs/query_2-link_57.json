        "text": "The Charleston Ballet, the Official West Virginia State Ballet, was formed in 1956 by Andre Van Damme. A Belgian native, Van Damme achieved great success as the first star dancer with the Royal Opera. His vision was to provide stage experience in a professional atmosphere for West Virginia dancers and create a greater appreciation for the art of ballet. That vision still continues today under the artistic direction of Kim R. Pauley.\n\nThe troupe has been a pioneer among regional ballet companies in the United States. For 65 years, the civic troupe has enriched the cultural life of West Virginia by performing hundreds of traditional and original ballets. The company has a reputation of high quality professional performances, artistic integrity, and strong social conscience.\n\nWatch Charleston Ballet's Short Film \"Stand Up and Dance\"\n\nPurchase Your “Andre Van Damme and the Story of the Charleston Ballet” Documentary DVD NOW!\n\nThe Charleston Ballet is pleased to provide common accommodations for individuals who have challenges with vision, hearing or mobility, as well as work with individuals who have other needs by request to make performances, activities, and other services as accessible as possible."
