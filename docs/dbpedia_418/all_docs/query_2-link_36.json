It will be located at the Museum of Radio and Technology in Huntington.\n\n\"We have all this wonderful equipment in the museum, and we thought it would be good if we could show some of the people who worked with it, and who worked behind the scenes,\" said Tom Resler, chairman of the committee to develop the hall of fame.\n\nNot all of those being honored in a Sept. 16 ceremony at the museum are well known outside the broadcasting community. Many are founders or owners of the first local stations. Others are engineers or others who never appeared on camera, or on the air.\n\n\"We sent out inquiries for possible inductees, and we came up with quite a few names,\" Resler said. \"The first list is like a catch-up process to get as many as we can. We'll add more next year, and then maybe two or three a year.\"\n\nA plaque will be engraved with the names of those being honored, and displays will be added with their pictures and biographies.\n\n\"We've done a lot of research to find these people, or their family members, and contacted them,\" said Resler, a technician for Sodaro's Electric for the past 45 years who also gives tours of the museum in his free time.\n\n\"A lot of them are deceased,\" he said. \"And for some, we haven't been able to find any family. But most of the ones we have will either attend the ceremony or have a family representative who will.\"\n\nJule Huffman, who was the well-known Mr. Cartoon and weatherman on WSAZ for decades, will attend the ceremony next month.\n\n\"I'm remembered for that, and for singing,\" he said. \"I directed, too. I announced. And if they needed the floor swept, I did that.\"\n\nHuffman attended the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, hoping for a career as a classical singer. But he realized the limitations of the field, and gravitated toward the novelty and excitement of television in its early days.\n\n\"I went from one station to another, doing anything I could,\" Huffman said. \"I caught on at WCPO (Cincinnati) and did eight jobs a day, all live. And it was fun. Then I worked in Ashland, Ky., and at WSAZ for 41 years.\"\n\nMarilyn Fletcher said she can't walk through Charleston without someone remembering her face from the days when she hosted the popular children's show \"Romper Room\" on WCHS-TV.\n\n\"That was the first thing I did in broadcasting,\" Fletcher said. \"I did that for two and a half years and it went off the air. Then they brought it back and I did it again.\n\nFletcher went on to become women's director at WSAZ. She did a 9 a.m. interview show and was a talk show hostess. She is now retired and living in Sun City, S.C., where she is still active in broadcasting and has helped develop local cable channels.\n\nOf the hall of fame, she said, \"It's a nice idea, especially for honoring the ones who actually started the stations. When I heard the list, I knew a lot of those names.\"\n\nBos Johnson, whose name is synonymous with broadcasting in West Virginia, also is being inducted into the hall of fame.\n\nJohnson has taught broadcasting to many students at Marshall University and was at WSAZ for nearly 25 years as news director and anchor.\n\n\"West Virginia, a small state by any measure, has had a remarkable impact on broadcasting in news, sports and entertainment and I was privileged to know a lot of those great folks,\" he said.\n\n\"Being inducted into the hall of fame is an honor and I'm grateful for it,\" added Johnson, who got his start at WKOY radio in Bluefield. \"And it has stirred a lot of memories.\"\n\nJohnson said that one of his fondest memories is sharing a broadcast booth at a Clarksburg football game in the 1950s with Jim Thacker, Jack Fleming and Jay Randolph -- all legendary broadcasters. Thacker went on to broadcast ACC basketball games. Fleming was the \"Voice of the Mountaineers\" for more than 40 years. Randolph, the son of Sen. Jennings Randolph, was an NBC broadcaster for pro football games.\n\nShirley Love is known in his Fayette County community for his work in television and radio, and he will be among those inducted into the hall of fame.\n\nLove was a deejay in 1954 with a popular WOAY radio show called \"Juke Box Review\" from 3 to 5 p.m. daily. When the Oak Hill company added a television station shortly after that, Love emceed a program called \"West Virginia Bandstand.\"\n\nHe said, \"It was the era when rock and roll came into existence. I played Elvis, and he was controversial. The bandstand show was a spin- off of ‘American Bandstand' and we had local high school kids come dance in the studio for an hour.\"\n\nEarly on, Love's job was to run the boom mike and crank the teleprompter for the show \"Friday Night Barndance.\" When the commercial announcer quit suddenly, he stepped in to read the lines, live, and ended up with the job.\n\nOver the years, Love anchored the WOAY news, hosted a popular Saturday night wrestling show, made commercials and sold advertising. He figures he announced more than 1,100 local football and baseball games.\n\n\"I retired in 1997, but I still do some games,\" he said. \"I do the play-by-play, and the sheriff does the color.\"\n\nCharles Ryan, owner of a public relations firm that bears his name, was a fixture on local television for years. He is also one of the inductees.\n\n\"I started in my hometown of Keyser, on WKYR radio,\" Ryan said. \"I was 17 and they had a contest for a teenage deejay and I won. Then, I hung around the studio until they hired me.\n\n\"Having a 5,000-watt radio station at your command does great things to your confidence,\" he said. Ryan went on to work full time at radio stations in Morgantown while attending West Virginia University.\n\nHe came to Charleston in 1962 to work for WSAZ and was later news director at WCHS.\n\n\"Some great talent has evolved in broadcasting in this state,\" Ryan said. \"And I've been privileged to know them.\"\n\nJoe Farris II will attend the hall of fame celebration to represent his late father, Joe Farris, who is known for his 40-year career as a radio personality in Charleston.\n\nFarris said his father would have been thrilled to be part of the honorees.\n\n\"He started as a teenager before World War II,\" Farris said. \"He did a lot of Morris Harvey games and high school sports for WCHS and WGKV. He started as a disc jockey and went into sales and management, but he always kept his finger in sports.\n\n\"He loved his radio career and the people in it,\" Farris said. \"Ernie Saunders, Al Sahley, John Dickensheets -- the old guard of guys who were in the business.\"\n\nThe ceremony will be held from 5 to 7 p.m. Sept. 16 at the museum, 1640 Florence Avenue in Huntington.\n\nInductees to the West Virginia Broadcasting Hall of Fame\n\nCharles Ryan, WSAZ, WCHS and public relations\n\nBos Johnson, WSAZ, Marshall University professor\n\nChuck Woolery, game show host\n\nBob Denver, actor\n\nDagmar, actor\n\nDon Knotts, actor\n\nHerbert Morrison, WMMN, WVU professor/Heindenberg disaster\n\nGrandpa Jones, WWVA, WMMN/\"Hee-Haw\"\n\nGene Morehouse, WWNR/former voice of the Thundering Herd\n\nJack Fleming, WAJR/former voice of the Mountaineers\n\nShott Family, WHIS/Bluefield broadcasting\n\nNoah Adams, National Public Radio\n\nJim Thacker, WSAZ/various networks - sportscaster\n\nEd Rabel, CBS news, University of Charleston professor\n\nPeter Marshall, game show host\n\nSoupy Sales, comedian\n\nJule Huffman, WSAZ/Mr. Cartoon\n\nMarilyn Fletcher, Romper Room/WV Broadcasters Association executive director\n\nBill Kelley, WCHS, WSAZ photographer/videographer\n\nBill Stewart, WSAZ, ABC newscaster-correspondent\n\nBob Bowen, WSAZ sportscaster\n\nBill Richards, WCHS weathercaster\n\nCol.

Hall and the Nick Rahall family.\n\nTwenty-five new faces will be enshrined in the ceremony at the West Virginia Museum of Radio and Technology in Huntington.\n\n“These inductees have created a rich diversity of programming at radio and TV stations across the state,” committee chairman Tom Resler said.\n\n“This year’s class of 25 and last year’s class of 32 inductees, along with the initial class of 61, represent West Virginians who have been an important part of the lives of viewers and listeners in the region and even across the country.”\n\nAmong the honorees are Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., and four members of his family — his father, Nick Joe, and uncles Farris, Deem and Sam. The family created radio station WWNR in Beckley and expanded to own and operate radio and television stations nationwide.\n\n“West Virginia’s broadcasters will always be an important voice in my life,” Rahall said from his Capitol office.\n\n“Three generations of Rahalls in broadcasting spell a lot of work and passion for an industry that serves the public, our communities and local business as well. It has been a long but happy path since those first steps my grandfather took, starting his new life here in West Virginia.”\n\nRahall said he is proud of his family and humbled by the hall of fame honor, and saluted his fellow inductees for their “considerable achievement.”\n\nNow news director for WOAY-TV in Oak Hill, Brunner said no other news event in his long and storied broadcasting career, which began under the tutelage of Boz Johnson at WSAZ, affected him as much as the Feb. 26, 1972, disintegration of a coal slurry impoundment that spawned the killer flood in Logan County.\n\n“And it was because of the frustration,” Brunner recalled.\n\n“Television is a visual media. Unless you had been up that hollow in Logan County before that dam broke, you couldn’t really show people how bad this was. We took pictures and you’re kind of looking at a mud flap. There were hundreds of homes up there. There were people but you couldn’t see it. That was one story I don’t think the media did a real good job of following up on.”\n\nBrunner launched his career in 1968 and has been in on a number of major news stories in a 40-year run, among them the Marshall airplane disaster in 1970, the two trials of former Gov. Arch Moore, the Willow Island collapse and a follow-up on the Silver Bridge disaster.\n\nOver that span, Brunner also covered numerous political campaigns, among them the first showdown between Moore and Jay Rockefeller, who lost his first time out but eventually won two terms as governor before reaching the U.S. Senate.\n\nPolitics opened a career door to him for three years, serving as an executive aide to former Gov. Gaston Caperton.\n\nBrunner also has been managing editor at WCHS-TV in Charleston, from 1993-1996, and was news director for the CBS station in Montgomery, Ala., and executive editor for the CBS affiliate in Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nBrunner came out of brief retirement in 2005 to become WOAY’s news director.\n\nPersinger, a Beckley native who graduated from the former Trap Hill High School, handled Flying Eagle football and basketball games for 27 years at both WWNR and WTNJ in Mount Hope.\n\n“I guess when it comes right down to it, I probably miss every Friday night going with the Flying Eagles to do their games,” said Persinger, now with radio station WKAZ based in Charleston.\n\nWorking with Metro-News, which boasts 59 member stations across the state, Persinger has earned a new moniker with the network, “the voice of high school sports in West Virginia.”\n\n“I have a high school football program called ‘Game Night’ every Friday night on 40 radio stations,” he said.\n\n“And I still do the post-game show for the Mountaineers. I do all kinds of things still for the state tournament — basketball, football, Super Six. That kind of keeps me busy. I’m in Morgantown every weekend now in the football season.”\n\nPersinger can be heard on company-owned stations that specialize in popular music of the 1960s in both Charleston and Summersville.\n\n“What a tremendous honor,” he said of his impending induction, coming on the heels of last July’s honor as this year’s Mel Burka Distinguished Broadcaster award.\n\n“Honestly, the crew I’m going in with really makes me feel good. Probably one of my better friends in this industry was John McKinney, who passed away. He was with the Mountaineers so long. That makes it really special. And Bill O’Brien and I have been friends a long time.”\n\nO’Brien broke in as a summer fill-in announcer at WJLS in 1967, working under the tutelage of Gene Morehouse, who died in the Marshall plane crash.\n\nAfter two summer stints, O’Brien was hired full-time in 1969 and has been at WJLS ever since, ultimately purchasing it with his wife in 2002, then selling it four years later. O’Brien remains there as a consultant and still does Woodrow Wilson football and basketball games.\n\nIn his first summer job, O’Brien recalled the “incredible experience” of working with Morehouse, whom he had listened to handling Beckley athletic contests as a youngster.\n\n“He wasn’t one to give advice unless asked,” he remembered.\n\n“Here was this legend, doing Little League baseball games. He treated the Little League games as if they were World Series Game Seven. Just everything was top of the line with him.”\n\nO’Brien said he felt “thrilled” to become part of this year’s crop of inductees.\n\n“It’s just an incredible honor to be up there with all of those legends,” he added.\n\nHall once worked as a disc jockey for WRON radio station in Ronceverte and at WVRC in Spencer before his career spiraled upward as a singer and teller of tales, penning such hits as “The Year Clayton Delaney Died” and “A Week in a County Jail.”\n\nOthers to be inducted include:\n\nJanet Coleman Evans, general manager of WBTH/WXCC, Williamson; Conchata Ferrell, a Charleston actress and comedienne with a number of roles, including “Two and a Half Men”; Robert “Bob” Brown, longtime owner of WCLG, Morgantown; Lewis Ross Dobbins, country-western DJ in Weston, Clarksburg and Buckhannon; Woody O’Hara, who teamed with the late Jack Fleming at West Virginia University on football and basketball games; Daniel “Zag” Pennel, WELD radio in Fisher;\n\nMarshall Rosene, first general manager of WSAZ-TV in Huntington; Sam and Mary Sidote, co-owners of WELC radio; Ned Skaff, a radio and television announcer at WCHS in Charleston; Earl J. Ward Jr., a 40-year news photographer at WCHS-TV and WSAZ-TV;\n\nMonte Scott “Yogi” Yoder, personality at WEPM and WKMZ in Martinsburg, eventually becoming general manager at both; Thomas “Tom” Garten, management at WPAR radio in Parkersburg and WCHS radio; Joe Johns, WSAZ-TV reporter who became NBC Capitol Hill correspondent, now CNN Washington correspondent; Toufie Kassab, sales executive and general manager in a career that included WGNT, WAMX-FM, WKEE, WRVC radio in the Huntington area; Frank Lee, disc jockey 48 years and finally general manager of WMMN in Fairmont;\n\nTed McKay, WTIP and WKNA radio show host in Charleston in the 1940s and 1950s, also hosted “Goofus Orchestra” on old WKNA-TV; Paul Miles, general manager of WCAW radio in Charleston; and Jackie Oblinger, who opened her career at WHIS radio in Bluefield, then WHIS-TV, and hosted popular women’s shows on WCHS-TV in Charleston.\n\nWest Virginia Broadcasting Hall of Fame Announces the\n\n2010 Class of Inductees\n\nAugust 22, 2010\n\nThe West Virginia Broadcasting Hall of Fame will induct 13 new members in a ceremony at the Museum of Radio & Technology on Saturday, October 2, 2010 from 5:00 to 7:00 PM.
