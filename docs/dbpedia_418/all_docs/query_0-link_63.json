        "text": "West Virginia Flood Donations – A List of 10 Ways To Help\n\nMany people are wanting to help West Virginia flood victims, but there is so much information being given that decisions are difficult. Hopefully, this list will help a little. 1. Snowshoe Foundation: Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the recent severe weather and storms. Partnering with Snowshoe Mountain, we have set up a donation portal to anyone who would like to contribute to the communities of the Mountain State to help rebuild what was lost. We’ve started the ball rolling with a $10k contribution. We’ll be accepting donations through July 8, 2016. At that time, we’ll make a lump donation to the American Red Cross of West Virginia. The donations will be directly used to help rebuild and support our local communities. Thank you for any support large or small. For more information, please click on the link below: https://snowshoefoundation.org/ 2. West Virginia Flood Relief – a gofundme account set up by Brad Paisley. https://www.gofundme.com/WestVirginiaFloods On June 23rd, my home state of West Virginia experienced tremendous flooding that killed over 20 people and destroyed entire small towns. Three counties have been declared federal disasters and 44 of the 55 counties have been declared in a state of emergency. Now that the waters are receding it's time to pitch in and help in any way we can. One of the best ways I have found that hopefully will raise the largest amount of money the quickest and get it to the people in need the fastest is through GoFundMe. I have set a goal of $1 million -- this is doable and only a small portion of what is needed. All funds donated will be distributed through West Virginia Flood Relief 2016 - The Brad Paisley Foundation at WESBANCO Trust Department in Wheeling, WV. Join me as we help West Virginians together. Help spread the word! 3. Pro golfer Bubba Watson, who has a summer home near the Greenbrier Resort, pledged to donate at least $250,000 to relief and recovery. The annual Greenbrier Classic has been cancelled due to flooding, however, the PGA Tour is making a $100,000 donation to the American Red Cross to help people affected by the floods. Fans wishing to assist in the relief and recovery efforts can do so by making donations at http://pgatour.com/together. Starting on June 28, all donations will be distributed to American Red Cross West Virginia Flood Relief. - information courtesy of – Adam Schupak of Golfweek. 4.

From/by Brooke Thibodaux, WCHS/WVAH Eyewitness News: “Stuffed animal donations help brighten day of kids staying at Capital High School shelter.” http://wchstv.com/news/local/stuffed-animal-donations-help-brighten-day-of-kids-staying-at-capital-high-school-shelter J.R. Bailey and Sandy James bought $500 worth of stuffed animals, and passed out some of them to children at Capital High School—where several flood-displaced families are staying. Estimates are they $4000 more to pass them out to all affected children. Bailey explained why he thinks something seemingly so simple can help. \"Stuffed animals. How would that help? And then I thought, 'Yeah, that's what they sleep with. They're devastated. They're sleeping in a strange bed in a strange place with a lot of strange people around.\" If this is a way you would like to help, you may drop off stuffed animals at First Baptist Church in Dunbar. To coordinate donation, call 1-304-768-1822 or 1-304-542-7418. The church is open 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. 8.
