The two stations share studios on Piedmont Road in Charleston and transmitter facilities atop Coal Mountain, south of Scott Depot, West Virginia.\n\nmore ...\n\nWorld Media Directory\n\nThis World Media Directory is maintained by EIN Presswire, a press release distribution service, and is a listing of TV stations, radio stations, newspapers and blogs.
