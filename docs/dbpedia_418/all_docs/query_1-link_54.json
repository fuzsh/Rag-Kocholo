        "text": "Pittsburgh-based Meridian Communications signed WVAH-TV on the air from Charleston, W. Va., in 1982. It was the state’s first independent TV station. Broadcasting over Channel 23, it was the state’s first commercial UHF station since Charleston’s WKNA-TV signed off the air in 1955.\n\nThe area’s rugged terrain and the technical nature of UHF signals made it difficult for WVAH to cover the entire market.\n\nAct III Broadcasting bought the station in 1987 and soon applied to move the station to the VHF band. WVAH moved to Channel 11 in 1989.\n\nSinclair Broadcast Group, which owned rival WCHS-TV, acquired the WVAH-TV in 1994 when it purchased Act III’s assets. FCC regulations at the time prevented Sinclair from owning both stations, so it sold WVAH to Glencairn, which was headed by a former Sinclair executive.\n\nGlencairn became Cunningham Broadcasting, which still owns WVAH. It’s operated by Sinclair, alongside WCHS. The two stations share a facility."
