        "text": "HUNTINGTON, W.Va. -- The American Sports Network's broadcast of Saturday's Marshall-FIU game will air on FOX 11's WVAH-TV, the station announced Friday morning.\n\nASN, which added the game to its broadcast schedule last month, picked up the game for the Huntington-Charleston market only. Out-of-market fans will be able to catch the live stream of the game online at the following link: http://wchstv.com/live/news/index.shtml.\n\nFans can also hear live audio of the contest on their radio affiliates of the Thundering Herd IMG Sports Network via the Marshall Gameday app, the TuneIn app and by HerdZone.com's All-Access portal. Live scoring updates, courtesy of the @HerdFB Twitter account, will also be available.\n\nThe Thundering Herd placed 24th in the Amway USA Today Coaches poll with 153 points and 25th in the Associated Press poll with 148 points.\n\nMarshall is 6-0 and 2-0 in Conference USA and is one of just six undefeated schools remaining in the Football Bowl Subdivision. The Herd is led by quarterback Rakeem Cato, who, if he throws a touchdown pass Saturday, will break Russell Wilson's (NC State, Wisconsin, 2009-11) FBS record of 38. Cato tied the record Saturday in a 49-24 Homecoming win over Middle Tennessee.\n\nThe Herd also features a top-10 ground game that is headed by junior Devon Johnson, who is tied for third nationally with 11 rushing touchdowns and is ninth with 135.67 rushing yards per game.\n\nDefensively, the Herd gives up just 17.2 points per contest, a mark that is tied for eighth nationally.\n\nFIU is 3-4 overall and 2-1 in league play this season. Tight end Jonnu Smith continues to be a playmaker on the FIU offense, leading the squad in receptions (34), receiving yards (411) and TD catches (4). The Panthers also lead the league in total defense (327.1 yards allowed per game), pass defense (184.3), sacks (21) and turnover margin (+11)."
