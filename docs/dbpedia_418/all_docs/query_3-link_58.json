        "text": "Fun fact about \"streaming video\" these days. It doesn't necessarily mean there's no way for you to watch your local channels. In fact, a good many of the major streaming services have access to your local broadcast TV channels. Well, the big ones, anyway. Pretty cool.\n\nAT&T TV Now is one of those options. They've got a number of affiliates for ABC and CBS and Fox and NBC throughout the United States. More than 400 channels, actually, from scores of cities and affiliates. (It's actually done by \"Designated Market Areas\" and not necessarily one city for each channel, but you knew that already.)\n\nHere's the full list of local channels you can get through AT&T TV Now. This list may chance without warning, though, so we'd recommend checking out AT&T TV Now's local channels search tool before spending any money.\n\nTo see the latest updates, just skip down to the bottom.\n\nLocal channels available on DirecTV Now\n\nUpdated Aug. 15, 2018: DirecTV Now just added the following 34 DMAs:\n\nNew ABC affiliates\n\nAlbany, NY (WTEN)\n\nDes Moines-Ames, IA (WOI)\n\nGrand Rapids-Kalamazoo, MI (WOTV)\n\nHarrisburg-Lancaster, PA (WHTM)\n\nHartford-New Haven, CT (WTNH)\n\nKnoxville, TN (WATE)\n\nMemphis, TN (WATN)\n\nNashville, TN (WKRN)\n\nRichmond-Petersburg, VA (WRIC)\n\nSalt Lake City, UT (KTVX)\n\nNew CBS affiliates\n\nAlbuquerque-Santa Fe, NM (KRQE)\n\nBirmingham, AL (WIAT)\n\nBuffalo, NY (WIVB)\n\nCharleston-Huntington, WV (WOWK)\n\nFresno-Visalia, CA (KGPE)\n\nGreen Bay, WI (WFRV)\n\nGreenville-Spartanburg, SC-Asheville, NC (WSPA)\n\nLas Vegas, NV (KLAS)\n\nMobile, AL-Pensacola, FL (WKRG)\n\nPortland, OR (KOIN)\n\nProvidence, RI-New Bedford, MA (WPRI)\n\nRaleigh-Durham, NC (WNCN)\n\nSan Diego, CA (KFMB)\n\nNew NBC affiliates"
