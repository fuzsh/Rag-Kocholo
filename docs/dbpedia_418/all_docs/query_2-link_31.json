        "text": "Please Note\n\nThis information is presented by the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee (KPEPC) and is supplied by Verizon as a public service. Verizon and KPEPC assume no liability and will not be responsible for any injury which is the consequence of any action (or inaction) undertaken by any person which is in any way related to the information in the ?Know What To Do In Case Of An Emergency? Guide.\n\nBe Prepared\n\nIt may be some time before emergency responders can reach you and provide assistance, depending on the type and scale of the emergency. You can be better prepared by doing the following:\n\nPrepare an emergency kit. It should include first aid supplies, flashlight, duct tape for sealing cracks, battery operated radio, spare batteries, candles, matches, blankets, extra clothing, prescription medicine, bottled water, ready-to-eat food, pet food and other necessary items. Check the kit every six months to make sure the contents are still there and are fresh.\n\nLearn CPR and first aid.\n\nSelect a place where family members can meet if they become separated during an emergency.\n\nSpecial Assistance for the Disabled - Don?t Wait For an Emergency!\n\nDisabled persons who may need special assistance during emergencies, especially in an evacuation, should notify their local fire department of their problems and needs along with their home address and telephone number. In the event of an emergency, the needed assistance can then be provided. See the Government Pages or the Business White Pages for the telephone number of your local Fire Department.\n\nMedical, Fire, Law Enforcement Help\n\nFor any type of emergency, medical, firefighting, and/or law enforcement help, call 9-1-1. Give your name, address, including community and zip code, and the nature of the emergency. Stay on the line until told you may hang up. Stay calm and answer as clearly as possible any questions asked.\n\nNotification of An Emergency\n\nIf there is an emergency you may be given warning in one or more ways in Kanawha and/or Putnam Counties and you will be told how to protect yourself. Warning sirens are located in many of the urban areas of both counties. A steady high-pitched tone of the siren for three minutes repeated several times means that you should turn on the radio or television to a local station for information on what to do. Emergency information will be broadcast on the Emergency Alert System (EAS), which is broadcast by the radio and television stations below.\n\nEAS Stations\n\nRadio Station Channel WCAW 680 AM WVAF 99.9 FM WCHS 580 AM WKWS 96.1 FM WQBE 950 AM or 97.5 FM WVSR 102.7 FM WSCW 1410 AM WKAZ 107.3 FM WCAW 680 AM TV Station Channel WSAZ Channel 3 WCHS Channel 8 WOWK Channel 13 WVAH Channel 11\n\nEmergency Notification\n\nStay calm. Stay off the telephone including cell phones, unless you have a medical emergency. The lines may be needed for official business. Your call could keep other people from getting emergency help. Turn on your radio or television to an EAS station for information and directions, locate your emergency kit, and review your emergency plan.\n\nProtective Actions:\n\nIf you are told to Shelter-in-Place, do the following:\n\nGo inside your home, school, public building, store, or office building. Go to a room with no or few windows. Bring pets inside.\n\nStay calm. Stay off the telephone including cell phones, unless you have a medical emergency.\n\nTurn on a radio or television to a local EAS station for information and direction.\n\nStay tuned to the station until the emergency is over, or until you are given instructions to leave.\n\nIn certain cases, evacuation is one way to protect yourself. If you are told to evacuate, take the following actions:\n\nLeave immediately. Otherwise, emergency personnel may be unable to reach you later.\n\nStay calm. Stay off the telephone including cell phones, unless you have a medical emergency.\n\nListen to a radio or television tuned to a local EAS station.\n\nIf possible, turn off natural gas before leaving to prevent fires.\n\nTake the necessary clothing, medicine, portable radio, flashlight and other necessary items.\n\nLock the building that is being left. The area(s) evacuated will be secured by law enforcement personnel.\n\nDo not attempt to go to schools or other places where another family member may be. Other members may be sheltered or evacuated as part of a facility?s emergency response plan.\n\nTurn on your porch light as you leave your house or other building to let people know that structure is empty.\n\nIf you do not have your own transportation, listen to the EAS station for information about public transportation.\n\nTurn the vehicle radio to an EAS station for further instructions.\n\nWhen the emergency is over, you will be allowed to go back to your home or other location from which you were evacuated. If you came by public transportation, you will be returned by public transportation.\n\nIf the emergency involved an airborne toxic chemical leak, upon returning to your home or other location, ventilate the structure before remaining inside.\n\nYour family emergency plan should include your pets. Different emergencies require different responses. But whether the emergency is a chemical leak or a winter storm, you may have to evacuate your home. The best way to protect your pets is to evacuate them too.\n\nPlan to take your pets to a friend?s or relative?s home or to a hotel that accepts pets during an emergency. Pets are not permitted in Red Cross emergency shelters.\n\nTransport pets in sturdy carriers.\n\nHave identification, collar, leash, and proof of vaccinations for all pets.\n\nHave food and water for your pets.\n\nHave a current photo of your pets in case they get lost.\n\nFor More Information\n\nYou can get additional information about emergencies from the following organizations:\n\nKanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee\n\n(304) 414-3600\n\nhttp://www.kpepc.org\n\nAmerican Red Cross ?
