It was the second commercial outlet in the market after WKNA in Charleston; WKNA, an ABC linked station aired on UHF Ch 49 but got silent in 1955 due to very low viewership. The service was originally a CBS affiliate that shared ABC affiliation with WSAZ: Ch 3 however, it became a full time CBS affiliate when WHTN in 1995 joined ABC following its launch. It also recorded its affiliation with NTA Film Network in late 50’s for a short period of time."
