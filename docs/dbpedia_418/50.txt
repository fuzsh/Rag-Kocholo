History

WCHS dates backs its launch to Aug 15, 1954 under the original ownership of Tierney Company which also held WCHS 580 AM. It was the second commercial outlet in the market after WKNA in Charleston; WKNA, an ABC linked station aired on UHF Ch 49 but got silent in 1955 due to very low viewership. The service was originally a CBS affiliate that shared ABC affiliation with WSAZ: Ch 3 however, it became a full time CBS affiliate when WHTN in 1995 joined ABC following its launch. It also recorded its affiliation with NTA Film Network in late 50’s for a short period of time.
