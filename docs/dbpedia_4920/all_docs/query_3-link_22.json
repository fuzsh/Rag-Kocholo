Minister of Public Security\n\n3. A.L.A. Management and Operation (2005) Ltd\n\n4. Knesset\n\nThe Supreme Court sitting as the High Court of Justice\n\n[19 November 2009]\n\nBefore President D. Beinisch, Vice-President E. Rivlin\n\nand Justices A. Procaccia, E.E. Levy, A. Grunis,\n\nM. Naor, E. Arbel, S. Joubran, E. Hayut\n\nPetition to the Supreme Court sitting as the High Court of Justice.\n\nFacts: The Knesset enacted the Prisons Ordinance Amendment Law (no. 28), 5764-2004 (‘amendment 28’), which provides that the State of Israel will establish, for the first time, a (single) prison that will be operated and managed by a private corporation rather than by the state. The constitutionality of this law was challenged by the petitioners, who argued that amendment 28 disproportionately violated the rights of prison inmates as a result of the actual transfer of imprisonment powers to a private enterprise, and as a result of the concern that human rights in a private prison would be violated to a greater extent than in a state-run prison.\n\nHeld: (Majority opinion — President Beinisch, Vice-President Rivlin, Justices Procaccia, Grunis, Naor, Arbel, Joubran, Hayut) Amendment 28 violates human rights disproportionately and is therefore unconstitutional.\n\n(President Beinisch, Vice-President Rivlin, Justices Grunis, Naor, Arbel, Joubran, Hayut) The concern that human rights in a private prison will be violated more than in state managed prisons addresses a future violation of human rights, and there is no certainty that this will occur; therefore, it is questionable whether it constitutes a sufficient basis for setting aside primary legislation of the Knesset. However, the human rights of prison inmates are violated ipso facto by the transfer of powers to manage and operate a prison from the state to a private concessionaire that is a profit-making enterprise. The denial of personal liberty is justified only if it is done in order to further or protect an essential public interest, and therefore the question whether the party denying the liberty is acting in order to further the public interest (whatever it may be) or is mainly motivated by a private interest is a critical question that lies at the very heart of the right to personal liberty. Therefore, amendment 28 causes an additional independent violation of the constitutional right to personal liberty beyond the violation that arises from the imprisonment itself.\n\nWhen the state transfers power to manage a prison, with the invasive powers that go with it, to a private profit-making corporation, it violates the human dignity of the inmates of that prison, since the public purposes that give imprisonment legitimacy are undermined and the inmates becomes a means for the private corporation to make profits (Justice Grunis reserved judgment on this issue).\n\nThe main public purpose underlying amendment 28 is the economic purpose of saving the state money.\n\nThe ‘additional’ violation of constitutional rights deriving from giving imprisonment powers to a private profit-making corporation is disproportionately greater than the ‘additional’ public benefit that will allegedly be achieved by amendment 28.\n\nThe unconstitutionality of amendment 28 requires it to be set aside in its entirety, because it is a comprehensive arrangement in its structure and content, in which the granting of the powers relating to using force against the inmates is an integral part. Were only the provisions concerning the granting of the invasive powers set aside, the remaining provisions would be unable to stand independently.\n\n(Justice Procaccia) The legal justification and moral authority for violating the basic liberty of a person by means of imprisonment depend upon the exercise of authority being entrusted to organs of the state, which are the people’s representative in protecting the values of social order, on the one hand, and the basic rights of the individual, on the other. Transferring this power to a private enterprise undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and sentencing, and the moral basis for exercising institutional authority over the individual offender.\n\nThe main purpose of amendment 28, as can be seen from its legislative background and context, is to promote the welfare of prison inmates by reducing overcrowding in the prisons, improving services provided in them and expanding the treatment and rehabilitation programmes available to the inmate. However, this benefit to the prison inmate and the economic benefit to the state are not commensurate with, and are even dwarfed by, the violation of the prison inmate’s core human rights that can be expected to result from entrusting sovereign authority to a private concessionaire. In the ethical sphere, the duty of protecting the core human rights of the prison inmate against a serious potential violation overrides the positive purpose of improving the living conditions of prison inmates and increased economic efficiency for the state.\n\n(Minority opinion — Justice Levy) The state has not divested itself of its powers but merely exchanged them for supervisory powers. It is hard to see how this conflicts with the constitutional role of the government, and the mechanisms of indirect government should be examined on their merits.\n\nIt is premature to determine whether a private prison will violate human rights disproportionately. Time will tell. The law should be put to the test before the court reaches any conclusions on this matter.\n\nPetition granted by majority opinion (President Beinisch, Vice-President Rivlin, and Justices Procaccia, Grunis, Naor, Arbel, Joubran and Hayut), Justice Levy dissenting.\n\nLegislation cited:\n\nBasic Law: The Judiciary, s. 15(d)(2).\n\nBasic Law: Freedom of Occupation, s. 4.\n\nBasic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, ss. 1A, 2, 5, 8, 9.\n\nBasic Law: the Army, ss. 2, 3.\n\nBasic Law: the Government, ss. 1, 44(a).\n\nBasic Law: the Knesset, ss. 7(8), 7(9), 7A.\n\nCriminal Procedure Law [Consolidated Version], 5742-1982, s. 12(a)(1)(b).\n\nCriminal Procedure (Enforcement Powers — Arrests) Law, 5756-1996, ss. 23, 67.\n\nDeferral of Service of Full-Time Yeshivah Students, 5762-2002.\n\nEmergency Powers (Arrests) Law, 5739-1979.\n\nExecution Law, 5727-1967, s. 5.\n\nGeneral Security Service Law, 5762-2002, ss. 3, 4.\n\nInternment of Unlawful Combatants Law, 5762-2002.\n\nKnesset and Local Authorities 5730 Elections (Funding, Limits on Spending and Scrutiny) Law, 5729-1969.\n\nParole Law, 5761-2001.\n\nPenal Law, 5737-1977, art.

Beinisch\n\nThe Prisons Ordinance Amendment Law (no. 28), 5764-2004 (hereafter: ‘amendment 28’), provides that the State of Israel will establish for the first time a (single) prison that will be operated and managed by a private corporation rather than by the state. The arrangement provided in amendment 28 leads to a transfer of basic powers of the state in the field of law enforcement — imprisonment powers — the exercise of which involves a continuous violation of human rights, to a private profit-making corporation. As we shall explain below, this transfer of powers violates the constitutional rights to personal liberty and human dignity, which are enshrined in the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. The question of the constitutionality of this violation lies at the heart of the petition before us. It should already be said at the outset that, for the reasons that will be set out below, we have arrived at the conclusion that the aforesaid amendment does not satisfy the test of constitutionality.\n\nThe main facts and the arguments of the parties\n\n1. On 31 March 2004, amendment 28 of the Prisons Ordinance [New Version], 5732-1971 (hereafter: ‘the Prisons Ordinance’) was published. According to the amendment, chapter C2 was added to the Ordinance. This chapter is entitled ‘Privately managed prison.’ The amendment, which resulted in the addition of sections 128F-128BB, regulates the establishment of one prison that will be built, managed and operated by a private corporation, which will enter into an agreement for this purpose with the Israel Prison Service and act as a concessionaire in accordance with a special permit that it will receive. The amendment provides, inter alia, the procedure for granting and cancelling the permit, the qualifications that should be satisfied by the corporation and its employees, the scope of the powers of the corporation’s employees and the supervisory measures that the state is required to undertake with regard to the activity of the corporation and its employees. In the Third Schedule to the Prisons Ordinance, it is provided that the privately managed prison will be constructed in the prison compound south of the city of Beer-Sheba, and its maximum capacity will be eight hundred inmates. The Schedule also lays down the conditions that should be satisfied with regard to inmates that will be imprisoned in the privately managed prison.\n\nThe petition before us was filed on 16 March 2005. The first petitioner is an academic institution, which is acting as a public petitioner in the petition before us. The second petitioner is a retired senior officer in the Israel Prison Service. The third petitioner, who was subsequently joined as a party to the petition at his request, was, on the date that he was joined as a petitioner, an inmate of a prison managed by the Israel Prison Service. On 27 October 2005 an initial hearing of the petition took place before a bench of three justices. On 15 November 2005, the third respondent (hereafter: ‘the concessionaire’) was chosen as the winning group in the tender for the construction and operation of the private prison, and the concession agreement was signed with it on 2 January 2006. On 18 June 2006 a further hearing of the petition was held before a bench of seven justices, which was presided over by President A. Barak. Following this, an order nisi was made. On 31 August 2006, following a further hearing that took place before a bench of nine justices, and after the court was notified by the Knesset’s legal adviser that draft laws had been tabled to repeal amendment 28, it was decided to postpone the hearing of the petition in order to allow the legislative proceedings that had apparently been restarted in the Knesset to be exhausted. Since these proceedings did not progress and the legal position set out in the statute under discussion was not changed, on 8 July 2007 we heard the actual petition. While the hearing of the petition was taking place, the proceedings for setting up the privately managed prison also progressed, and the third respondent was given the permit required under the law. The construction of the prison and its preparation for the initial partial admission stage were supposed to be completed by June 2009, but on 18 March 2009 we made an interim order that prevented the prison being put into operation. It should be noted that the delay that has occurred in giving this judgment derived from the complexity of the issues under consideration, which raised constitutional questions of significant importance that have not yet been decided in our case law, but mainly from the court’s desire to allow the Knesset to exhaust the legislative proceedings mentioned above and the public debate that the Knesset wished to hold on the privatization phenomenon during the 2007-2008 winter session, as stated in the Knesset legal adviser’s notice of 28 June 2007, before we considered the complex question concerning the setting aside of primary legislation of the Knesset.\n\n2. The petition is directed at the constitutionality of amendment 28 of the Prisons Ordinance, and the petitioners’ argument is that this amendment should be regarded as a choice by the state ‘to carry out a complete privatization of prisons in Israel.’ As will be explained below, the petition has two main arguments.\n\nIn the first argument the petitioners claim that a complete privatization of the prisons constitutes an unconstitutional violation of the constitutional rights to personal liberty and human dignity. In this context, the petitioners claim that several factors combine in this respect to cause an unconstitutional violation of constitutional basic rights. The main cause of this lies in the combination of the following: the nature of the powers that are being privatized, which include the actual power of imprisonment and the powers relating to the human dignity of the inmate and his personal liberty (such as holding a prisoner in administrative isolation, carrying out an external examination of a inmate’s naked body and using reasonable force to carry out a search on an inmate); the low standards that have been set, according to the petitioners, for staffing the positions in the privatized prison in comparison to the standards in the Israel Prison Service; and the inadequate supervision, according to the petitioners, of the actions of the private enterprise that will operate the prison. The petitioners claim that this combination is likely to lead to a violation of the inmates’ rights to liberty and human dignity in the privatized prison. According to the petitioners, this expected violation of constitutional basic rights does not satisfy the limitations clause tests laid down in s. 8 of the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty.\n\nIt is argued that a violation of the basic principle that the power to enforce criminal judgments is exercised exclusively by the state, in order to achieve an economic purpose, is not a violation that is made for a proper purpose. The petitioners argue that it is also not a proportionate violation. In this respect, the petitioners claim that from the viewpoint of whether the chosen means will lead to the desired purpose, they have expert opinions that indicate that experience around the world does not show a clear connection between the privatization of prisons and an economic saving; that there are other less harmful measures that are capable of realizing the economic purpose underlying amendment 28, including the building of additional public prisons or a partial privatization that only involves powers that do not contain a predominant element of the exercise of sovereign power; and that the damage that will result from a complete privatization of prisons is disproportionate to the benefit that will arise from such a privatization (especially, according to the petitioners, in comparison to the possibility of a partial privatization of prisons).\n\n3. In the other argument, the petitioners claim that amendment 28 constitutes a violation of the constitutional rule laid down in s. 1 of the Basic Law: the Government, according to which ‘The government is the executive branch of the state.’ The reason for this is that the power of the state to operate prisons constitutes, according to the petitioners, a part of its authority to exercise executive power in order to enforce the law and maintain the peace; and as such the power lies at the heart of the basic principle that ‘The government is the executive branch of the state.’ According to the petitioners, since the Basic Law: the Government is a Basic Law, its normative status is a super-legislative one, and therefore any ordinary law that violates it should satisfy two requirements, one formal and the other substantive.\n\nFirst, in the formal sphere, the petitioners argue that the violating law should be passed by a majority of at least 61 members of the Knesset in each of the three readings, according to the entrenchment provision set out in s. 44(a) of the Basic Law: the Government. Since amendment 28 was not passed with this majority, the petitioners claim that this alone should lead to its being set aside. Second, in the substantive sphere, the petitioners claim that the violating law should satisfy the tests of the limitations clause. The petitioners argue that these tests should also be applied, by way of judicial interpretation, to laws that violate the Basic Laws that concern the organs of the state, such as the Basic Law: the Government, even though these Basic Laws do not contain an express limitations clause like the ones provided in the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and the Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation.\n\n4. It should also be mentioned that we also heard the arguments of the third petitioner, Mr Yadin Machness, who at that time was serving a custodial sentence at Maasiyahu Prison. The third petitioner’s arguments focused on the practical aspects relating to the services provided to inmates in the prisons of the Israel Prison Service, in fields such as health, food and education. According to him, there is a concern that the standard of these services will decrease in the privately managed prison as a result of the economic considerations that will motivate the concessionaire operating the prison. The third petitioner also raised in his arguments a concern that use will be made of the various powers given to the private concessionaire in such a way that will allow the concessionaire to worsen the conditions of the inmates in the privately managed prison and punish them, without it first being necessary to charge the inmates in disciplinary proceedings, for which the Israel Prison Service remains responsible, even under amendment 28.\n\n5. All of the respondents oppose the granting of the petition. Replies to the petition were filed by respondents 1-2 (hereafter: ‘the state’), the concessionaire and the Knesset. In its reply to the petition, the state says that the construction of a privately managed prison is one of the solutions planned by it for contending with the serious shortage of prisons in Israel, and this is the main purpose underlying the enactment of amendment 28. The state also claims in the affidavit in reply that in addition to an improvement of the inmates’ prison conditions, the construction of the prison that is the subject of the petition is very much in the public interest, since it will lead to an economic saving of an estimated amount of approximately 20-25 per cent in comparison to a prison of similar standards operated by the Israel Prison Service, and on the basis of experience around the world it can be estimated that the construction of a private prison may also lead to greater efficiency in state-run prisons.\n\nAccording to the state, the privatization model adopted in amendment 28 of the Prisons Ordinance is a unique and experimental model, which constitutes a ‘pilot’ test that is expressly limited to one prison and includes mechanisms to protect the rights of the inmates and effective supervision and intervention mechanisms that are available to the state and will allow it, inter alia, to reverse the process at any stage and take back control of the prison because of a breach of the terms of the permit given to the concessionaire. The state emphasizes in its pleadings that the existence of a real concern of a serious violation of inmates’ rights is one of the grounds provided in amendment 28 for the state to take away the power to manage the prison from the concessionaire. In this regard, the state further argues that amendment 28 provides measures for supervising the manner in which the concessionaire exercises the powers granted to it: these include the activity of the designated supervision unit of the Israel Prison Service inside the prison (even though the location of the supervision unit was not stipulated in amendment 28 itself, but only in the concession agreement and the permit); the supervisory powers given to the state with regard to the appointment of officers in the privately managed prison; and the extensive reporting duties imposed on the concessionaire with regard to various incidents, both under amendment 28 and under the concession agreement. According to this argument, the supervisory measures will guarantee the prison inmates’ rights. The state also points out that amendment 28 also provides that the permit for operating the prison and the concession agreement may be revoked by the state, if the permit’s conditions are breached.\n\nThe state also goes on to say that, under s. 15(d)(2) of the Basic Law: The Judiciary and according to the case law of this court, from the moment that the concessionaire receives sovereign powers, it becomes directly subject to both administrative law and the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice, without even resorting to the doctrine of the dual-nature corporation. In addition to the judicial scrutiny of the High Court of Justice to which the concessionaire is subject, the state says that an inmate in the privately managed prison, like every inmate in the Israel Prison Service, has the right to file a prisoner’s petition to the District Court under the provisions of the Prisons Ordinance. This possibility of judicial scrutiny of the prison conditions constitutes, according to the state, an independent and very powerful means of supervision and control that is available to every inmate at all times. Additional control mechanisms with regard to the activity of a privately managed prison to which the state refers are the scrutiny of the State Comptroller, since the concessionaire is an audited body within the meaning of this term in s. 9(6) of the State Comptroller Law [Consolidated Version], 5718-1958, and the scrutiny of an advisory committee chaired by a retired District Court justice. According to amendment 28, this committee will advise the Commissioner of Prisons on the subject of upholding the rights of inmates in the privately managed prison, and also on the subject of their rehabilitation, welfare and health, and it shall submit its recommendations to the Minister of Public Security, the Commissioner of Prisons and the Internal Affairs and Environment Committee of the Knesset once a year. In view of the aforesaid, the state argues that there is no basis for the claim that it has divested itself of its powers, and it adds that in the Israeli model chosen for the privatization of the prison, a significant part of the sovereign powers is retained by the state.\n\nThe state goes on to argue that the rights of the inmates will be guaranteed not merely by the mechanisms provided in the law itself but also in the administrative sphere, by the permit for constructing and operating the prison, as well as in the contractual sphere, by the concession agreement with the concessionaire. In this regard, the state says that various powers that are potentially particularly harmful and are not essential for the ongoing management of the prison (which are given to governors of prisons managed by the state) were not given by amendment 28 to the governor acting on behalf of the concessionaire. The state also says that, even if this court holds, contrary to its position, that amendment 28 violates constitutional human rights to a greater extent than the violation of prison inmates’ rights under the general law, this violation satisfies the tests of the limitations clause.\n\n6. Regarding the provisions of s. 1 of the Basic Law: the Government, which provides that ‘the Government is the executive branch of the state,’ the state claims that this provision is intended to define in a ‘ceremonial’ manner the nature and character of the government in relation to the other organs of state. According to the state, the purpose of this provision does not concern any specific executive power at all, merely the general position of the government within the democratic system. The state goes on to argue that in any case the government carries out its functions as the executive branch in a variety of ways, including by relying on private entities. Therefore the government does not stop acting as ‘the executive branch of the state’ when it carries out its functions through private entities or delegates certain powers to them. The state goes on to argue that even if s. 1 of the Basic Law: the Government can be used to set aside the delegation of powers made pursuant to a statute, there is no basis for using it to disqualifying amendment 28, since the privately managed prison will be run with the full involvement of the state, and therefore the amendment will not undermine the principle that the government is the executive branch of the state. The state further argues that even if amendment 28 can be regarded as a violation of the principle provided in the Basic Law: the Government, it is a negligible and very remote violation that lies at the margin of the principle and not at its centre.\n\nThe state also says that the Israeli model chosen for entrusting a prison to private management is based on the English model that is characterized by a regulatory approach, according to which the supervision of the activity of the private concessionaire is carried out by state inspectors who are stationed inside the supervised prison. Notwithstanding, according to the state, the Israeli model of delegating powers to manage one prison to a private concessionaire is more moderate with regard to the powers given to the concessionaire and more comprehensive, compared to similar legislative models in other countries, with regard to the powers to supervise the concessionaire, and it should therefore be regarded as an ‘improved English model.’\n\nIn view of the aforesaid, the state claims that since the petition challenges a privatization determined by law, which does not violate constitutional rights, the intervention of the court should be limited to rare and extreme cases, in which the privatization shakes the foundations of democracy and the fundamental principles of the system of government; according to the state, circumstances of this kind do not exist in the case before us.\n\n7. The concessionaire that was chosen in the tender to build and operate the privately managed prison also argues that the petition should be denied. It argues that not only will the operation of a privately managed prison not harm the liberty, dignity and rights of the inmates, but it will result in an improvement of their conditions, because of the high standards laid down by the state in the minimum requirements of the tender for the construction and operation of the prison (standards that the concessionaire claims it undertook to improve upon) and because of the extensive supervisory powers retained by the state. The concessionaire emphasizes in its reply to the petition the importance that it attaches to the social goals that the prison is intended to realize, including the rehabilitation and education of the inmates. The concessionaire further argues that there is no basis to the petitioners’ claims regarding the concern of a violation of inmates’ rights as a result of the legislation of amendment 28. In this context, the concessionaire argues that the petitioners’ claim that the running of a prison with the assistance of a private enterprise necessarily leads to a greater danger of a violation of inmates’ basic rights than a prison entirely managed by the state needs to be proved factually on the basis of research and empirical evidence; according to the concessionaire, however, the petitioners did not even attempt to discharge this heavy burden. The concessionaire goes on to argue that even if amendment 28 violates a constitutional right protected in the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, that violation satisfies the conditions of the limitations clause. With regard to the third petitioner’s arguments regarding the concern that the concessionaire’s economic motives will result in a deterioration in the inmates’ prison conditions at the privately managed prison, the concessionaire argues that these claims do not address the constitutionality of amendment 28, merely the manner in which it is implemented, and in any case they are without merit, in view of the high standard for operating the prison set out in the conditions of the tender, the concession agreement and the concessionaire’s bid.\n\nWith regard to the petitioners’ claims that are founded on the provisions of s. 1 of the Basic Law: the Government, the concessionaire argues that this provision is a declarative constitutional provision that does not prevent a delegation of powers by the government, or the state availing itself of the assistance of private enterprises to carry out its duties.\n\n8. An additional argument that is raised both by the state and by the concessionaire is the claim of laches. The state and the concessionaire say that the petition before us was filed approximately a year after the Knesset enacted amendment 28, without any justification for the delay in filing the petition. In this respect, it was argued by the state and the concessionaire that the delay in filing the petition adversely changed their position, since by the date of filing the petition they had already gone to considerable expense and invested significant work and time in the project — the state in preparing the tender and the documents of the tender, and the concessionaire in studying the documents of the tender and preparing a detailed bid for the tender. It was also argued that the cancellation of the project at a late stage would harm the foreign parties who had entered into contracts with the concessionaire and relied on the legislation of the Knesset, and it might even prejudice the attractiveness of the State of Israel to foreign investors and experts, as well as other national projects requiring large investments. We should already point out at this stage that we see no reason to dismiss the petition on the ground of laches. Even if we assume in favour of the state and the concessionaire that the rules of laches also apply to constitutional petitions, and that in the present case there were both an objective delay and a subjective delay on the part of the petitioners, in view of the constitutional importance of the issues raised in the petition — both from the viewpoint of the principles of the system of government in Israel and from the viewpoint of the effect on the human rights of prison inmates — there is no basis for dismissing this petition because of the delay in filing it (with regard to the tests for examining a claim of laches, see, for example: AAA 7142/01 Haifa Local Planning and Building Committee v. Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel [1], at pp. 678-679; AAA 2273/03 Blue Island General Partnership v. Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel [2], at paras. 86-101 of the judgment).\n\n9. In addition to the replies of the state and the concessionaire, we also heard the position of the Knesset with regard to the petition. According to the Knesset, s. 1 of the Basic Law: the Government, which it will be recalled is the basis for the petitioners’ constitutional argument concerning the state divesting itself of its powers, does not contain any provision with regard to the manner of carrying out the government’s powers; it does not contain any provision that restricts the Knesset’s power to permit the government to act in various ways to discharge its executive function; nor does the section provide criteria for examining the constitutionality of laws. Therefore, the Knesset claims that s. 1 of the Basic Law: the Government is not relevant at all when considering the constitutionality of amendment 28. The Knesset goes on to argue that there is no basis for examining the constitutionality of the amendment in accordance with the provisions of a ‘judicial limitations clause’ that is based on the limitations clauses provided in the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and the Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation. In this respect the Knesset argues that no clear case law ruling has yet been made that the Knesset’s legislative power is limited by the tests in the limitations clause even when the relevant Basic Law does not have an express limitations clause, and it adds that a substantive restriction of the kind that is found in the limitations clause in the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and the Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation is unsuited to the examination of legislation that prima facie conflicts with a provision in a Basic Law that concerns the organs of the state. It should be noted that in so far as the concrete question of the privatization of prisons is concerned, the Knesset included in its arguments a comprehensive description of the phenomenon of prison privatization around the world. The Knesset emphasized that this is a ‘hard case’ of privatization and it argued that the state needs to carry out close supervision of the private entity, and that the concessionaire should be made subject to the rules of public law.\n\nDeliberations\n\n10. Amendment 28 of the Prisons Ordinance, whose constitutionality is being challenged by the petitioners in this case, introduced a material change in the sovereign outlook of our system of government; it departs from the ordinary and accepted outlook of privatizing government activities in that it gives a private concessionaire various powers that, when exercised, necessarily involve a serious violation of human rights. In this petition we are required to decide whether granting these powers to a private concessionaire, i.e., privatizing these powers, is constitutional (with regard to the various definitions of the concept of privatization, see Y. Katz, Privatization in Israel and Abroad (1997), at pp. 23-30). On this question, our approach will be as follows: first, we shall address the nature of the arrangement provided in amendment 28. Thereafter, we shall consider in brief the scope of judicial review of Knesset legislation. Our main deliberations on the question of the constitutionality of amendment 28 will focus on the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. At the end of our deliberations we shall address the arguments of the parties regarding the constitutional scrutiny of the amendment from the viewpoint of the Basic Law: the Government. It should immediately be pointed out that in view of the conclusion we have reached, that the amendment under discussion does not satisfy the constitutionality tests in the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, various questions that arise with regard to the constitutionality of the amendment from the viewpoint of the Basic Law: the Government do not require a decision.\n\nThe nature of the arrangement provided in amendment 28\n\n11. The following are the main relevant provisions that were introduced by the aforesaid amendment 28.\n\nSection 128G(a) of the Prisons Ordinance provides that ‘The service [i.e., the Israel Prison Service] may, for the purpose of carrying out its functions as stated in section 76, rely on a corporation’ that satisfies certain minimum requirements stipulated in the section, ‘and to this end it may enter into an agreement with it to construct, manage and operate one prison’ (it should be noted that the functions of the Israel Prison Service are defined in general terms in s. 76(a) of the Prisons Ordinance, which provides that the Israel Prison Service ‘shall engage in the management of the prisons, the security of inmates and everything entailed therein’). The corporation to which s. 128G(a) of the Prisons Ordinance refers is therefore the concessionaire, which is supposed, according to the provisions of amendment 28, to construct, manage and operate the ‘privately managed prison.’ The various powers given to the concessionaire under amendment 28 are naturally derived from the scope of the responsibility imposed on it. Section 128L of the Prisons Ordinance defines the spheres of responsibility imposed on the private concessionaire in the following terms:\n\n‘Responsi­bility of the concession­aire\n\n128L. (a) The concessionaire is responsible for the proper construction, management and operation of the privately managed prison, including:\n\n(1) maintaining order, discipline and public security in the privately managed prison;\n\n(2) preventing the escape of inmates that are held in custody in the privately managed prison;\n\n(3) ensuring the welfare and health of the inmates and taking steps during the imprisonment that will aid their rehabilitation after the release from imprisonment, including training for employment and providing education;\n\nall of which in accordance with the provisions of every law and the provisions of the agreement and while upholding inmates’ rights.\n\n(b) The concessionaire shall adopt all the measures required in order to discharge his responsibility as stated in subsection (a), including measures as aforesaid that are stipulated in the agreement, and inter alia he shall appoint for this purpose the concessionaire’s governor and employees in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.’\n\nThe powers of the concessionaire and its employees, whose privatization within the framework of amendment 28 lies at the heart of the petition before us, are those powers that are derived from the spheres of responsibility provided in ss. 128L(a)(1) and 128L(a)(2) of the Prisons Ordinance, namely the responsibility of maintaining order, discipline and public security in the prison and the responsibility of preventing the escape of inmates that are held in custody in the prison. In order that the private concessionaire that manages and operates the prison can discharge its responsibility in these fields, the governor of the private prison on behalf of the concessionaire and the concessionaire’s employees (subject to several important exceptions) were given various powers, which are parallel to the powers given to the governor of an Israel Prison Service prison and the prison employees that are subordinate to him. Exercising these powers — and this petition is directed against granting them to a private concessionaire rather than against their actual existence — naturally entails a serious violation of various human rights, including the right to life, the right to personal liberty and the right to human dignity. Below we shall discuss several of the powers given to the private concessionaire’s employees at their various levels.\n\n12. The powers of the governor of the privately managed prison are defined in s. 128R of the Prisons Ordinance, which states the following:\n\n‘Functions and powers of the governor of a privately managed prison\n\n128R. (a) The governor is responsible for the proper management and operation of a privately managed prison, as stated in section 128L(a), and in this respect all of the provisions under this Ordinance that apply to a prison governor shall apply to him, subject to the provisions of this section.\n\n(b) In order to carry out his functions as stated in subsection (a), the governor shall be given the powers given to a governor of a prison under this Ordinance and under every other law, except for the powers according to service orders and the following powers:\n\n(1) Making an order to transfer an inmate because of a contagious disease, under the provisions of section 13(b);\n\n(2) Extending a period during which an inmate is held in isolation under the provisions of section 19C(a);\n\n(3) Confiscating a possession under the provisions of section 44;\n\n(4) Jurisdiction regarding prison offences under the provisions of article 8 of chapter 2;\n\n(5) The power of an examiner with regard to a letter to a member of Knesset under the provisions of section 47D;\n\n(c) In addition to the powers given to the governor under the provisions of subsection (b), he shall also be given the following powers:\n\n(1) The power given to a senior prison officer to order the holding of a prisoner in isolation, under the provisions of section 19C(a);\n\n(2) The power to order the conducting of an external examination of the naked body of a prison inmate, when he is admitted into custody, as stated in section 95D;\n\n(3) The power given to an Israel Prison Service officer to order the conducting of an external examination of the naked body of a prison inmate, under the provisions of section 95E(b);\n\n(4) The power given to an Israel Prison Service officer to approve the use of reasonable force in order to conduct a search on a prison inmate, under the provisions of section 95F(b);\n\n(5) The power given to an Israel Prison Service officer to order the taking of a urine sample from a prison inmate, an external examination of his naked body or the making of an external search, under the provisions of sections 95H(a) and 95I(c);\n\n(6) The power given to an Israel Prison Service officer to order the conducting of an external examination of the naked body of a visitor under the provisions of section 95J(b);\n\n(7) The powers given to a prison security guard under the provisions of section 128AA.’\n\nA study of the provisions of the aforementioned s. 128R shows that although the governor of the privately managed prison was not given important powers that are given to the governor of an Israel Prison Service prison (including the power to extend the period for holding an inmate in administrative isolation for more than 48 hours and jurisdiction regarding prison offences), the law still gives him powers that, when exercised, involve a serious violation of the rights to personal liberty and human dignity. These powers include, inter alia, the power to order an inmate to be held in administrative isolation for a maximum period of 48 hours; the power to order the conducting of an external examination of the naked body of an inmate; the power to order the taking of a urine sample from an inmate; the power to approve the use of reasonable force in order to carry out a search on the body of an inmate; and the power to order an inmate not to be allowed to meet with a particular lawyer in accordance with the restrictions provided in s. 45A of the Prisons Ordinance.\n\nIt should be further pointed out that in addition to all these there is a series of invasive powers that are given to the governor of the prison on behalf of the private concessionaire, which are embodied in the concession agreement rather than in amendment 28 itself.\n\n13. Additional invasive powers are also given to the concessionaire’s employees that are subordinate to the governor of the privately managed prison. Thus, for example, s. 128Y provides which powers are given to a ‘senior employee of the concessionaire,’ which is defined in s. 128F of the Prisons Ordinance as a ‘employee of the concessionaire who carried out command and management functions’:\n\n‘Powers of a senior employee of the concession­aire\n\n128Y. In order to carry out his functions, a senior employee of the concessionaire shall have the following powers:\n\n(1) The powers given to a prison security guard under the provisions of section 128AA;\n\n(2) The powers set out in section 128R(c)(1) to (6), in whole or in part, if the governor authorized him for this purpose, with the approval of the commissioner, and in accordance with the authorization;\n\n(3) The powers that are given to an examiner under the provisions of sections 47A to 47C, if the governor authorized him for this purpose, with the approval of the commissioner, and in accordance with the authorization;\n\n(4) The power given to the governor to deny privileges, if the governor authorized him for this purpose, with the approval of the commissioner, and in accordance with the authorization.’\n\nAn additional position that was created within the framework of amendment 28 is the position of ‘prison security guard.’ This position in the privately managed prison is de facto equivalent to the position of a prison officer in the Israel Prison Service. The functions of a ‘prison security guard’ are set out in s. 128Z of the Prisons Ordinance as follows:\n\n‘Functions of a prison security guard\n\n128Z. The functions of a prison security guard are:\n\n(1) To maintain public safety and security in the privately managed prison;\n\n(2) To prevent the escape of the inmates who are held in custody in the privately managed prison;\n\n(3) To maintain order, discipline and routine in the privately managed prison;\n\n(4) To discover or prevent offences that are committed within the compound of the privately managed prison or the surrounding area, when accompanying an inmate out of the privately managed prison or when chasing an escaped inmate, all of which with regard to a privately managed prison or inmate;\n\n(5) To carry out any additional function that the agreement provides shall be carried out by a prison security guard.’\n\nThe powers given to a ‘prison security guard’ in order to discharge his aforesaid functions (powers that are all also given to the governor of the privately managed prison and to a ‘senior employee of the concessionaire’) are set out in s. 128AA of the Prisons Ordinance as follows:\n\n‘Powers of a prison security guard\n\n128AA. (a) (1) When carrying out his job and for that purpose only, a prison security guard has the powers given to a prison officer under the provisions of this Ordinance, including powers to carry out the instructions of the governor or of a senior employee of the concessionaire, as stated in section 125R(c)(1), (3), (5) and (6), subject to the following changes:\n\n(a) The power under the provisions of section 95 with regard to a weapon that is a firearm, according to the meaning thereof in the Firearms Law, 5709-1949, is given to a prison security guard in the following circumstances only:\n\n(1) When he is carrying out perimeter security functions on the walls of the privately managed prison or in the area surrounding the prison;\n\n(2) When he is accompanying an inmate outside the privately managed prison;\n\n(3) In circumstances where there has been a serious violation of order and discipline in the privately managed prison, as stated in section 128AJ(a)(1), in accordance with a permit from the commissioner and according to the conditions set out in the permit;\n\n(b) He shall have the power to make an external examination of the naked body of an inmate when he is admitted into custody, under the provisions of section 95D, only in accordance with an order from the governor or from a senior employee of the concessionaire under the provisions of section 128R(c)(2);\n\n(2) In this subsection, ‘senior employee of the concessionaire’ — a senior employee of the concessionaire who has been authorized for this purpose under the provisions of section 128Y(2).\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1), a prison security guard shall not have the following powers:\n\n(1) The powers given under the provisions of this Ordinance to a prison officer who belongs to the Anti-Drugs Unit, as defined in section 95A;\n\n(2) The power to order an inmate to be held in isolation under the provisions of section 19C;\n\n(3) Jurisdiction regarding prison offences, under article 5 of chapter 2, and any other power that is given to a prison officer under the aforesaid chapter.\n\n(c) A prison security guard shall have the powers as stated in this section within the compound of the privately managed prison, or in the surrounding area, and when accompanying an inmate outside the prison or when chasing an escaped inmate; nothing in the provisions of this subsection shall derogate from the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(a).’\n\nThe aforesaid s. 128AA therefore gives a prison security guard, who it will be remembered is a employee of the concessionaire who operates the privately managed prison, powers that are given to a prison officer of the Israel Prison Service, subject to certain restrictions. These powers include, inter alia, the power to use a weapon in order to prevent the escape of an inmate from the prison, the power given to a policeman to arrest and detain a person without a warrant under ss. 23 and 67 of the Criminal Procedure (Enforcement Powers — Arrests) Law, 5756-1996 (a power that is given to a prison employee under s. 95B of the Prisons Ordinance), and the powers provided in ss. 95D and 95E of the Prisons Ordinance to carry out a search on the person of an inmate when he is admitted into custody and during his stay in the prison. Exercising these powers also leads, of course, to a serious violation of the inmates’ human rights. It should also be noted that a employee of the concessionaire who is not a prison security guard is also entitled in certain circumstances to use reasonable force and to take steps to restrain an inmate, in accordance with s. 128AB of the Prisons Ordinance, which provides the following:\n\n‘Powers of a employee of the concessionaire to use force\n\n128AB. A employee of the concessionaire that is not a prison security guard, who has undergone training as provided in the agreement, may use reasonable force and take measures to restrain an inmate, until a prison security guard or a prison officer comes, if one of the following is satisfied:\n\n(1) The inmate commits in his presence a violent offence or causes real damage in his presence to a person or property;\n\n(2) There is a real concern of harm to the health or physical integrity of a person;\n\n(3) There is a reasonable concern that the inmate is escaping or is trying to escape from the privately managed prison.’\n\nThe petition before us does not address the actual existence of the aforesaid harmful powers, nor does it deny the need for them in order to operate and manage a prison properly. As stated above, the petitioners’ claims address the constitutionality of giving the aforesaid functions and powers to a private concessionaire and its employees.\n\nThe scope of judicial scrutiny of Knesset legislation\n\n14. The premise for examining the constitutionality of amendment 28 is that it is a law passed by the Knesset that reflects the will of the representatives of the people, and as such the court is required to respect it; the court will therefore not determine lightly that a certain statute is unconstitutional (see HCJ 3434/96 Hoffnung v. Knesset Speaker [3], at p. 67; HCJ 4769/95 Menahem v. Minister of Transport [4], at pp. 263-264). Moreover, it should be recalled that a law that is enacted by the Knesset enjoys the presumption of constitutionality that imposes on someone claiming unconstitutionality the burden of showing, at least prima facie, that the statute is unconstitutional, before the burden passes to the state and the Knesset to justify its constitutionality. The presumption of constitutionality also requires the court to adopt the assumption that the statute was not intended to undermine constitutional principles (see Hoffnung v. Knesset Speaker [3], at p. 68; HCJ 6055/95 Tzemah v. Minister of Defence [5], at pp. 267-269 {663-667}). At the same time, the court should carry out the role given to it in our constitutional system and examine the constitutionality of the legislation enacted by the legislative branch. This examination should be made by striking a delicate balance between the principles of majority rule and the separation of powers, on the one hand, and the protection of human rights and the basic values underlying the system of government in Israel, on the other. This also means that the constitutional scrutiny should be carried out with caution and restraint, without reformulating the policy chosen by the legislature (see CrimA 6659/06 Iyyad v. State of Israel [6], at para. 29 of the judgment). This rule of caution and restraint when intervening in the policy chosen by the legislature is particularly applicable with regard to court intervention in matters reflecting economic policy. President A. Barak said in this respect:\n\n‘The court does not seek to replace the thinking of the legislature with its own thinking. The court does not put itself in the legislature’s place. It does not ask itself what measures it would choose, were it a member of the legislature. The court exercises judicial scrutiny. It examines the constitutionality of the law, not its wisdom. The question is not whether the law is good, effective or justified. The question is whether it is constitutional. A “socialist” legislature and a “capitalist” legislature may enact different and conflicting laws, which will all satisfy the requirements of the limitations clause. Indeed, the Basic Laws are not a plan for a specific political course of action. Nationalization and privatization can both exist within their framework. A market economy or a centrally planned economy can both satisfy judicial scrutiny, provided that the economic activity that violates human rights satisfies the requirements of the limitations clause. Therefore, where there is a range of measures, the court should recognize a margin of appreciation and discretion that is given to the legislature… Determining social policy is the province of the legislature, and its realization is the province of the government, which both have a margin of legislative appreciation’ (see HCJ 1715/97 Israel Investment Managers Association v. Minister of Finance [7], at p. 386; see also Menahem v. Minister of Transport [4], at pp. 263-264. For criticism regarding the limited scope of judicial intervention in economic policy, see B. Medina, ‘“Economic Constitution,” Privatization and Public Funding: A Framework of Judicial Review of Economic Policy,’ Itzchak Zamir Book on Law, Government and Society (2005) 583, at pp. 648-652).\n\nMoreover, it is important to clarify that when speaking of legislation that results in a serious violation of protected human rights, the fact that the motive underlying the legislation is an economic one does not decide the question of the scope of constitutional scrutiny of that legislation. In such circumstances, the predominant element in the constitutional scrutiny will be the nature and degree of the violation of human rights, as well as the existence of possible justifications for that violation. The deciding factor will therefore not be the economic aspect of the legislation causing the violation, but the question whether the legislation leads to a serious and grave violation of constitutional human rights and does not satisfy the tests of the limitations clause.\n\n15. The constitutional issue lying at the heart of the petition before us is whether and to what extent the state — and especially the government, which is the executive branch of the state — may transfer to private enterprises the responsibility for carrying out certain tasks that for years have been its exclusive concern, according to the basic constitutional principles of the democratic system in Israel, when those tasks involve a significant and fundamental violation of human rights. The question that we are called upon to decide is, therefore, whether it is possible to determine that the privatization of sovereign powers in this case is unconstitutional, even though it is done pursuant to primary legislation of the Knesset.\n\nAn examination of the constitutionality of amendment 28 in accordance with the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty\n\n16. When we examine the petitioners’ arguments that are founded on the provisions of the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, we should first decide the question whether granting the various powers involved in the management and operation of a prison to a private concessionaire, as was done in amendment 28, violates a constitutional right that is protected in the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. If we find that such a right has been violated, we should examine whether the violation is lawful, i.e., whether the violation satisfies the tests of the limitations clause in s. 8 of the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. If we ultimately arrive at the conclusion that amendment 28 violates a constitutional right that is protected by the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, and that this violation does not satisfy the tests of the limitations clause, we shall need to determine what is the appropriate constitutional remedy for the unlawful violation (regarding the three stages of constitutional scrutiny, see CA 6821/93 United Mizrahi Bank Ltd v. Migdal Cooperative Village [8], at p. 428; HCJ 4128/02 Israel Union for Environmental Defense v. Prime Minister of Israel [9], at p. 517).\n\n17. The first question that we need to decide, therefore, is whether the provisions of amendment 28 involve a significant violation of a constitutional right that is protected by the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. Our deliberations as to whether amendment 28 violates the human rights of the inmates of the privately managed prison are based on the premise that imprisoning a person and holding him in custody in itself violates his right to liberty and freedom of movement. This is the case even when the imprisonment is lawful. In addition to this premise, there is another premise that has become a rule in our legal system, that the loss of personal liberty and freedom of movement of an inmate, which is inherent in the actual imprisonment, does not justify an additional violation of the other human rights of the inmate to an extent that is not required by the imprisonment itself or in order to realize an essential public interest recognized by law (see HCJ 4634/04 Physicians for Human Rights v. Minister of Public Security [10], at para. 11 of the judgment; PPA 4463/94 Golan v. Prisons Service [11], at pp. 152-156 {501-504}). In this respect, the remarks of Justice E. Mazza are apt:\n\n‘It is established case law in Israel that basic human rights “survive” even inside the prison and are conferred on a prisoner (as well as a person under arrest) even inside his prison cell. The exceptions to this rule are only the right of the prisoner to freedom of movement, which the prisoner is denied by virtue of his imprisonment, and also restrictions imposed on his ability to realize a part of his other rights — some restrictions necessitated by the loss of his personal freedom and other restrictions based on an express provision of law’ (Golan v. Prisons Service [11], at pp. 152-153 {501}).\n\n18. On the basis of these premises, we should examine the petitioners’ arguments with regard to the violation of basic constitutional rights that arises from the provisions of amendment 28, which focus de facto on two issues. First, the petitioners argue that there is a real concern that the powers that were provided in amendment 28 will be exercised by the private concessionaire in a manner that violates the human rights of the inmates to a greater degree than the manner in which the corresponding powers are exercised in the prisons managed by the Israel Prison Service. Second, the petitioners argue that the transfer of powers to manage and operate the prison to a private concessionaire ipso facto violates the constitutional rights of the inmates in the privately managed prison to their personal liberty and human dignity.\n\nAs we shall clarify below, amendment 28, which allows the construction of a prison that will be managed and operated by a private corporation, leads to a violation of the constitutional rights to personal liberty and human dignity of inmates who are supposed to serve their sentence in that prison. This is because of the actual transfer of powers of management and operation of the prison from the state to a private concessionaire that is a profit-making enterprise. We therefore do not need to decide the arguments of great weight raised by the petitioners regarding the potential for violating the inmates’ human rights in the privately managed prison to a greater degree than the violation of the inmates’ human rights in the prisons managed by the state. It should be noted that the petitioners’ claims in this regard were mainly based on the provisions set out in amendment 28 with regard to the nature of the powers granted to the concessionaire’s employees, the state’s supervision of the private concessionaire’s actions, the economic inducements that will present themselves to the concessionaire and the state with regard to the manner in which the prison is managed and the minimum conditions determined for the professional qualifications of the concessionaire’s employees. In this context, the petitioners also raised arguments concerning the violation of human rights that has been caused by the operation of privately managed prisons in other countries, and especially in the United States.\n\n19. We have examined the petitioners’ claims that are based on the concern that the human rights of inmates will be violated in the privately managed prison to a greater extent than in state managed prisons. In this respect, we are of the opinion that the concerns raised by the petitioners are not unfounded and that there is indeed a concern that the manner of operating the privately managed prison will lead to a greater violation of inmates’ human rights than in state managed prisons, because of the fact that the private prison is managed by a corporation that is a profit-making enterprise. It would appear that the aforesaid concern troubled both the primary legislature and the granter of the concession, and for this reason broad supervision and inspection powers were provided in amendment 28 to allay this concern. Notwithstanding, we have reached the conclusion that although the concerns raised by the petitioners are not unfounded, they address a future violation of human rights and there is no certainty that this will occur; therefore, it is questionable whether it constitutes a sufficient basis for setting aside primary legislation of the Knesset. In this regard it should be noted that the petitioners’ claims regarding the ramifications of the privatization of prisons in other countries (and especially the United States) are an insufficient basis for this court to reach an unequivocal and a priori determination that the method of operating a prison by means of private management will necessarily result in a violation of human rights that is significantly greater than the violation of human rights in state managed prisons. The reasons for this are, first, that the legislative arrangements in other countries are different from the legislative arrangement in Israel (especially with regard to the degree of state supervision of the concessionaire and the scope of the concessionaire’s powers), and, second, that the comparative figures are not unambiguous (see: A. Volokh, ‘Developments in the Law — The Law of Prisons: III. A Tale of Two Systems: Cost, Quality and Accountability in Private Prisons,’ 115 Harv. L. Rev. 1838, 1868 (2002); U. Timor, ‘Privatization of Prisons in Israel: Gains and Risks,’ 39 Isr. L. Rev. 81 (2006), at pp. 85-88; D.E. Pozen, ‘Managing a Correctional Marketplace: Prison Privatization in the United States and the United Kingdom,’ 19 Journal of Law & Politics 253 (2003), at pp. 271-276). Our decision will therefore be based on the assumption that, despite the potential violations indicated by the petitioners, there is no empirical proof that the manner of operating private prisons necessarily leads to a greater violation of the inmates’ human rights than that in the state managed prisons. Notwithstanding, we have reached the conclusion that the actual transfer of powers to manage a prison from the state, which acts on behalf of the public, to a private concessionaire that is a profit-making enterprise, causes a serious and grave violation of the inmates’ basic human rights to personal liberty and human dignity — a violation that should, of course, be examined from the viewpoint of the limitations clause. Let us now turn to clarify our reasons for this conclusion.\n\nThe violation caused by amendment 28 to the constitutional right to personal liberty\n\n20. Sending someone to prison — whether it is managed privately or by the state — first and foremost violates the constitutional right to personal liberty. This right is set out in s. 5 of the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, which states the following:\n\n‘Personal liberty\n\n5. A person’s liberty shall not be denied or restricted by imprisonment, arrest, extradition, or in any other way.’\n\nThe right to personal liberty is without doubt one of the most central and important basic rights in any democracy, and it was recognized in our legal system before it was enshrined in the Basic Law. Denying this right is one of the most severe violations possible in a democratic state that upholds the rule of law and protects human rights. A violation of the right to personal liberty is especially serious because it inherently involves a violation of a series of other human rights, whose potential realization is restricted physically, mentally and ethically. The special status of the right to personal liberty and the serious ramifications arising from a violation thereof were discussed by Justice Zamir in Tzemah v. Minister of Defence [5]:\n\n‘By virtue of s. 5 of the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, personal liberty is a constitutional right. Moreover, personal liberty is a constitutional right of the first order, and from a practical viewpoint it is also a prerequisite for realizing other basic rights. A violation of personal liberty, like a stone hitting water, creates a ripple effect of violations of additional basic rights: not only the freedom of movement, but also the freedom of speech, privacy, property rights and other rights… As stated in s. 1 of the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, “Basic human rights in Israel are founded on the recognition of the worth of man, the sanctity of his life and his being free….”. Only someone who is free can realize his basic rights fully and properly. It is personal liberty, more than any other right, that makes man free. For this reason, denying personal liberty is a particularly serious violation. Indeed, a denial of personal liberty by means of imprisonment is the most serious sanction that a civilized state imposes on offenders’ (see Tzemah v. Minister of Defence [5], at pp. 261-262 {656}; see also Iyyad v. State of Israel [6], at para. 28).\n\nBut like all human rights, the right to personal liberty, despite its exalted constitutional status, is not an absolute right.\n\nFrom the provisions of s. 5 of the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, it can be seen that imprisoning a person — whether in a state managed prison or in a privately managed prison — violates his constitutional right to personal liberty. In this respect it is important to emphasize that even when a person is convicted of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment, this does not mean that he no longer has the basic constitutional right to personal liberty; however, in consequence of the conviction and the sentence that follows it, the scope of the protection afforded to this right is reduced and it is denied for the period stipulated in the sentence. This denial is justified under the provisions of the limitations clause (see CrimA 4424/98 Silgado v. State of Israel [12], at p. 550).\n\n21. The special constitutional status of the right to personal liberty and the fact that it constitutes a condition for exercising many other human rights mean that the legitimacy of denying that liberty depends to a large extent on the identity of the party that is competent to deny that liberty and on the manner in which that liberty is denied. The basic constitutional principle underlying this approach is that in a democracy that respects human rights, the basic justification for denying the personal liberty of the individual lies in the fact that denying his liberty results in the realization of some essential public interest. Of course, this condition is insufficient in itself for denying the personal liberty of the individual, but it is an essential condition. This essential public interest that may justify, and sometimes even necessitate, the denial of the personal liberty of a particular individual, can be of various kinds. Thus, for example, usually when we are dealing with the denial of personal liberty in criminal proceedings, the public interest is expressed in the various goals of criminal punishment, such as deterrence, retribution or rehabilitation. In addition to considerations of criminal punishment, the public interest in denying the personal liberty of a particular individual may also be based on the danger that he presents to state security (see, for example, the Emergency Powers (Arrests) Law, 5739-1979, and the Internment of Unlawful Combatants Law, 5762-2002).\n\n22. According to our approach, which will be explained below, since the denial of the right to personal liberty is justified only if it is done in order to further or protect an essential public interest, the question whether the party denying the liberty is acting first and foremost in order to further the public interest (whatever it may be) or whether that party is mainly motivated by a private interest is a critical question that lies at the very heart of the right to personal liberty. The answer to the aforesaid question is of importance to the very legitimacy of the denial of liberty. According to the basic principles of modern political philosophy, the violation of the right to personal liberty resulting from giving a private enterprise the power to deny liberty within the context of the enforcement of criminal law derives ipso facto from the fact that the state is giving that party one of its most basic and invasive powers, and by doing so the exercise of that power loses a significant part of its legitimacy. In order to clarify the nature of the violation of the right to personal liberty that is caused by amendment 28, let us now examine the principles underlying our aforementioned approach and the manner in which these principles apply to amendment 28.\n\n23. According to modern political philosophy, one of the main factors that led to the organization of human beings in society, whereby invasive powers — including the power to send convicted offenders to prison — were given to the authorities of that society and especially the law enforcement authorities, is the aspiration to promote the protection of personal security and public order. This approach lies at the heart of the approach of the founders of modern political philosophy. In his classic work Leviathan, which was published in 1651, Thomas Hobbes discussed the nature of the roles of ‘publique ministers’ that are employed by the ‘Soveraign’:\n\n‘For Execution\n\nPublique Ministers are also all those, that have Authority from the Soveraign, to procure the Execution of Judgements given; to publish the Soveraigns Commands; to suppresse Tumults; to apprehend, and imprison Malefactors; and other acts tending to the conservation of the Peace. For every act they doe by such Authority, is the act of the Common-wealth; and their service, answerable to that of the Hands, in a Bodie naturall’ (Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil (1651), at chap. XXIII).\n\nAn additional expression of the manner in which modern political philosophy regards the role of the ‘political society’ in enforcing the law and punishing offenders can be found in the work of the English philosopher John Locke, Two Treatises of Government, which was published in 1690. In the Second Treatise, Locke presents his position that society rather than each of the individuals within it has jurisdiction regarding offences and the punishment for them:\n\n‘But because no political society can be, nor subsist, without having in itself the power to preserve the property, and in order thereunto, punish the offences of all those of that society; there and there only is political society, where every one of the members hath quitted this natural power, resigned it up into the hands of the community in all cases that exclude him not from appealing for protection to the law established by it. And thus all private judgment of every particular member being excluded, the community comes to be umpire, by settled standing rules, indifferent, and the same to all parties; and by men having authority from the community, for the execution of those rules, decides all the differences that may happen between any members of that society concerning any matter of right; and punishes those offences which any member hath committed against the society, with such penalties as the law has established: whereby it is easy to discern, who are, and who are not, in political society together (John Locke, Second Treatise of Government (1690), at para. 87).\n\nThis outlook concerning the responsibility of society or the sovereign (and those acting on their behalf) to enforce the criminal law and preserve public order became over the years a cornerstone in the modern political philosophy of democratic states. Although, naturally, many changes and developments have occurred since the seventeenth century in the way in which the nature and functions of the state are regarded, it would appear that the basic political principle that the state, through the various bodies acting in it, is responsible for public security and the enforcement of the criminal law has remained unchanged throughout all those years, and it is a part of the social contract on which the modern democratic state is also based. An expression of the fundamental outlook concerning the nature of the basic functions of the state and the relationship between it and the citizen can be found in the remarks of Justice I. Zamir in HCJ 164/97 Conterm Ltd v. Minister of Finance [13], at p. 320 {34}:\n\n‘... the relationship between the authority and the citizen is, in practice, a two-way relationship. Therefore, in my opinion, the authority’s duty to act fairly necessitates a corresponding duty to act fairly on the part of the citizen. This requirement is deeply rooted: it springs from the social contract on which the state is based. Under this contract, as it is understood in a democratic state, the authority and the citizen are not opposing forces on different sides of a barricade but stand side by side as partners in the state. In a democracy, as Justice Silberg said, “... the government and the citizen are one and the same” ... The government (in my opinion we should say: the public administration) has a duty to serve the public – to keep peace and order; to provide essential services; to protect the dignity and liberty of every citizen; to do social justice. But the public administration, which has nothing of its own, can only give to the public if it receives from the public. The proper relationship between the administration and the public, which is in fact the essential relationship, is a reciprocal relationship of give and take.’\n\nIn principle, the dispute between supporters and opponents of the privatization of the prisons depends largely on the question of who is the authority that is competent to deprive a person of his liberty in order to enforce the criminal law, and whether it is permitted and desirable to depart from the rule that the exercise of power in this regard lies with the state in its capacity as the representative of the public, and entrust this power to a private enterprise, such as an interested capitalist. This debate has been conducted in academic and public circles, but it has not yet been decided in the courts (see: I.P. Robbins, ‘The Impact of the Delegation Doctrine on Prison Privatization,’ 35 UCLA L. Rev. 911 (1988); J.E. Field, ‘Making Prisons Private: An Improper Delegation of a Governmental Power,’ 15 Hofstra L. Rev. 649 (1987); A.A. White, ‘Rule of Law and Limits of Sovereignty: The Private Prison in Jurisprudential Perspective,’ 38 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 111 (2001), at pp. 134-145). This highlights the special role of the state in enforcing the criminal law and in managing public prisons for the aforesaid purpose. The remarks of the American scholar, Prof. J.J. Dilulio, Jr., are pertinent in this regard:\n\n‘At a minimum, it can be said that, both in theory and in practice, the formulation and administration of criminal laws by recognized public authorities is one of the liberal state’s most central and historic functions; indeed, in some formulations it is the liberal state’s reason for being… It is not unreasonable to suggest that “employing the force of the Community” via private penal management undermines the moral writ of the community itself’ (J.J. Dilulio, Jr., ‘The Duty to Govern: A Critical Perspective on the Private Management of Prisons and Jails,’ Private Prisons and the Public Interest (D.C. McDonald ed., 1990), 155, at pp. 175-176).\n\n24. According to the aforesaid constitutional principles and the basic social and political tenets of the system of government in Israel, the state — through the government and the bodies that answer to it — is regarded as the party that has the responsibility for ensuring security, public order and the enforcement of the criminal law. The various security services in Israel — including the Israel Defence Forces, the Israel Police, the Israel Prison Service and the General Security Service — take their orders from the government, and as a rule their heads are appointed by it (see ss. 2 and 3 of the Basic Law: the Army, s. 8 of the Police Ordinance [New Version], 5731-1971, s. 78 of the Prisons Ordinance and ss. 3 and 4 of the General Security Service Law, 5762-2002). When these agencies, which all constitute a part of the executive branch of the state, exercise their powers, they are acting on behalf of the state as an organized force that receives its orders from the government. Indeed, the subordination of the various security services to the elected government has always been one of the hallmarks of the State of Israel as a modern democratic state, and it is one of the basic constitutional principles underlying the system of government in Israel (for the constitutional basis for the special status of persons serving in the various security services (including the Israel Prison Service), see ss. 7(8) and 7(9) of the Basic Law: the Knesset, and the special limitations clause provided in s. 9 of the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty).\n\n25. In addition to the subordination of the security forces in the state to the government, one of the hallmarks of the great power that has always been held by the executive branch in Israel is the power given to it, through the police, the state attorney’s office and the prison service, to enforce the provisions of the criminal law in Israel. The issue before us concerns the manner of implementing one of the main elements of the criminal law enforcement mechanisms in Israel — the power to deprive of their liberty those persons who have been convicted under the law and sentenced to imprisonment. This power is one of the most invasive powers that a modern democratic state has over its subjects.\n\nIt should be noted that prima facie, in so far as imprisonment as a sentence in a criminal trial is concerned, it might be argued that the violation of the right to personal liberty caused by the imprisonment derives in its entirety from the custodial sentence imposed by the court. Indeed, from a normative viewpoint, the decision of the competent courts of the state to sentence a particular person to imprisonment is the source of the power to violate the constitutional right of that individual to personal liberty. But the actual violation of the right to personal liberty takes place on a daily basis as long as he remains an inmate of the prison. This violation of the right to personal liberty is inflicted by the party that manages and operates the prison where the inmate is held in custody, and by the employees of that party, whose main purpose is to ensure that the inmate duly serves the term of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced (subject, of course, to the provisions of the law) and complies with the rules of conduct in the prison, which also restrict his personal liberty.\n\nIn Israel the power to punish someone who has been convicted under the law and to imprison him in order that he may serve his sentence is, therefore, one of the most significant powers of the state, and under the law the body that is responsible for carrying out this function of the state is the Israel Prison Service. This power, as well as the powers of the other security services, is an expression of a broader principle of the system of government in Israel, according to which the state — through the government and the various security services that are subordinate to it — has exclusive authority to resort to the use of organized force in general, and to enforce the criminal law in particular (for a critical discussion of the question of the monopoly given to the state to use force, see C.J. Rosky, ‘Force, Inc.: The Privatization of Punishment, Policing and Military Force in Liberal States,’ 36 Conn. L. Rev. 879 (2004).\n\n26. The monopoly given to the state — through the executive branch and the bodies acting through it — with respect to the use of organized force is of importance in two spheres. In one sphere, we need to take into account that the democratic legitimacy for the use of force in order to restrict the liberty of individuals and to deny various human rights relies on the fact that organized force exercised by and on behalf of the state is what causes the violation of those rights. Were this force not exercised by the competent organs of the state, in accordance with the powers given to them and in order to further the general public interest rather than a private interest, this use of force would not have democratic legitimacy, and it would constitute de facto an improper and arbitrary use of violence. In the other sphere, the fact that the organized force is exercised by a body that acts through the state and is subject to the laws and norms that apply to anyone who acts through the organs of the state and also to the civil service ethos in the broad sense of this term is capable of significantly reducing the danger that the considerable power given to those bodies will be abused, and that the invasive powers given to them will be exercised arbitrarily or in furtherance of improper purposes. Naturally, both of these spheres are interrelated and affect one another, since the democratic legitimacy given to the bodies that exercise organized force on behalf of the state is what allows them in a substantive sense to exercise the powers given to them vis-à-vis any individual. At the same time, since those bodies act within the framework of the democratic political mechanism and are subject to its rules, their legitimacy is enhanced. Prof. Dilulio discussed the close connection between the identity of the party that uses force against prisoners and the legitimacy of the actual use of force in the following terms:\n\n‘In my judgment, to continue to be legitimate and morally significant, the authority to govern those behind bars, to deprive citizens of their liberty, to coerce (and even kill) them, must remain in the hands of government authorities. Regardless of which penological theory is in vogue, the message “Those who abuse liberty shall live without it” is the philosophical brick and mortar of every correctional facility. That message ought to be conveyed by the offended community of law-abiding citizens, through its public agents, to the incarcerated individual. The administration of prisons and jails involves the legally sanctioned coercion of some citizens by others. This coercion is exercised in the name of the offended public. The badge of the arresting police officer, the robes of the judge, and the state patch of the corrections officer are symbols of the inherently public nature of crime and punishment’ (Dilulio, ‘The Duty to Govern: A Critical Perspective on the Private Management of Prisons and Jails,’ supra, at p. 173).\n\n27. Now that we have discussed the constitutional principle regarding the monopoly given to the state to use force in general, and to deny the personal liberty of individuals in order to enforce the criminal law in particular, let us now examine the relationship between this general principle and the arrangement provided in amendment 28. The main provision of amendment 28, which will form the focus of the constitutional scrutiny and from which all of the other provisions of the amendment whose constitutionality is under consideration are derived, is s. 128L of the Prisons Ordinance. This provision defines the spheres of responsibility of the private concessionaire, who is supposed to construct, manage and operate the privately managed prison. The wording of s. 128L appears in para. 11 above, but because of its importance in this case we shall cite the wording of the section once again:\n\n‘Responsi­bility of the concession­aire\n\n128L. (a) The concessionaire is responsible for the proper construction, management and operation of the privately managed prison, including:\n\n(1) maintaining order, discipline and public security in the privately managed prison;\n\n(2) preventing the escape of inmates that are held in custody in the privately managed prison;\n\n(3) ensuring the welfare and health of the inmates and taking steps during the imprisonment that will aid their rehabilitation after the release from imprisonment, including training for employment and providing education;\n\nall of which in accordance with the provisions of every law and the provisions of the agreement and while upholding inmates’ rights.\n\n(b) The concessionaire shall adopt all the measures required in order to discharge his responsibility as stated in subsection (a), including measures as aforesaid that are stipulated in the agreement, and inter alia he shall appoint for this purpose the concessionaire’s governor and employees in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.’\n\nThe constitutional difficulty presented by amendment 28 concerns the management and operation of the prison by a private concessionaire, and in particular the responsibility imposed on it for the matters set out in the aforesaid ss. 128L(a)(1) and 128L(a)(2), namely the responsibility for ‘maintaining order, discipline and public security’ and the responsibility for ‘preventing the escape of inmates that are held in custody.’ These spheres of responsibility, from which all the other invasive powers given to the governor of the prison on behalf of the concessionaire and the concessionaire’s employees are de facto derived, are the spheres in which, according to the petitioners, the state may not delegate or transfer its responsibility to a private enterprise. Moreover, it is important to point out that the provisions of amendment 28 may also to some degree affect the length of the term of imprisonment, since the conduct of the prison inmate has a not inconsiderable effect on the possibility of his early release from prison under the Parole Law, 5761-2001. In this respect it should be pointed out that under s. 9(7) of the Parole Law, the parole board acting under the law is required to consider, inter alia, the recommendation concerning the prisoner that was given by the governor of the privately managed prison, who, it will be recalled, is appointed by the concessionaire (it should be noted that the aforesaid s. 9(7) also relates to the possibility that one of the supervisors acting in the prison on behalf of the Israel Prison Service will submit a recommendation regarding the prisoner in the privately managed prison).\n\n28. The powers involved in maintaining order, discipline and public security in the prisons and the powers involved in preventing the escape of prisoners from custody are traditionally powers that manifestly belong to the state. The sovereignty of the state and its power to use coercive force against its subjects are typified by the power given to it to imprison persons who have been convicted by the court, to supervise those prisoners strictly, continuously and closely, in a manner that seriously (but justifiably) violates their personal liberty, human dignity and privacy, and to take various steps — including the use of deadly force in a manner that endangers the right to life and physical integrity — in order to prevent the escape of the inmates from the prison. Therefore, a prison, even when it operates within the law, is the institution in which the most serious violations of human rights that a modern democratic state may impose on its subjects may and do occur.\n\nWe have already discussed the fact that according to the basic values of society and the system of government in Israel, the legitimacy for exercising powers that involve a serious violation of the constitutional right to personal liberty derives from the fact that these powers are exercised by and on behalf of the state, after the person with regard to whom they are exercised has been tried and convicted by the legal system of the state. Imprisoning a person is the culmination of the criminal proceeding initiated against that person by the state on behalf of the entire public. The power of imprisonment and the other invasive powers that derive from it are therefore some of the state’s most distinctive powers as the embodiment of government, and they reflect the constitutional principle that the state has a monopoly upon exercising organized force in order to advance the general public interest. In this context it should be remembered that when an offender who has been convicted by a competent court and sentenced to imprisonment serves his sentence, this is not merely a technical stage of implementing the criminal law; it is a significant and integral part of the criminal proceeding that the state initiates against the individual, without which the earlier parts of the proceeding lose a significant part of their significance. Indeed, just as the state through the legislature is responsible for regulating criminal legislation, so too it is responsible for enforcing the criminal law and punishing offenders according to the law through the executive branch — a responsibility that is realized, inter alia, by imposing the role of managing and operating prisons on the state (see Field, ‘Making Prisons Private: An Improper Delegation of a Governmental Power,’ supra, at p. 669).\n\n29. The scope of the right to personal liberty and the power to violate this right lawfully are derived from the basic principles of the constitutional system in Israel that we discussed with regard to the responsibility of the state and those acting on its behalf to maintain public order and enforce the criminal law — a responsibility that justifies giving them extensive powers to vi"
