        "text": "February 2024\n\n1. Governing Texts\n\nCurrently, Nepal does not have unified data protection legislation. On September 13, 2022, the Data Act 2079 (2022) (only available in Nepali here) ('the Data Act'), which came into force on October 13, 2022, was promulgated with an aim to consolidate laws relating to data collection as well as to make the task of production, processing, storage, publication, and distribution of data more reliable, systematic, and in a timely fashion. Nevertheless, the Data Act fell short of expectations to provide clarity on data protection-related matters and to include comprehensive provisions relating to data collection, processing, storage, and publication thereof as well as privacy-related issues. In contrast, it is primarily focused on regulating data collected by governmental and public entities for official purposes rather than regulating general data privacy issues. The Individual Privacy Act 2075 (2018) ('the Privacy Act') was enacted to implement and safeguard the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by the Constitution of Nepal ('the Constitution') and the Individual Privacy Regulation 2077 (2020) ('Privacy Regulation'), (only available in Nepali here), framed thereunder along with the Data Act are regarded as the primary data protection legislation. Other general laws such as the National Civil Code 2074 (2017) ('the Civil Code') and the National Criminal Code 2074 (2017) ('Criminal Code') also contain general provisions relating to privacy and data protection. Thus, in the absence of specific data protection legislation, the Privacy Act, Privacy Regulation, and the Data Act will govern all aspects of data protection and privacy in Nepal.\n\nIn recent years, incidents of data breaches have been observed frequently in Nepal wherein a large number of customers' data including their names, email, and phone numbers were leaked in public. This has raised a serious concern about data security and confidentiality among the public. However, a consolidated Bill regulating matters relating to data protection has yet to be drafted.\n\n1.1. Key acts, regulations, directives, bills\n\nThe following are the prevailing laws in Nepal regulating privacy-related issues:\n\nthe Constitution;\n\nPrivacy Act;\n\nPrivacy Regulation;\n\nData Act;\n\nCivil Code;\n\nCriminal Code; and\n\nLabor Regulations 2074 (2017) (only available in Nepali here) ('the Labor Regulations').\n\nIn the past, the Government of Nepal ('the Government') had considered Bill 2075 relating to information technology, Information Technology (2019) ('IT Bill') (only available in Nepali here) at the Parliament for discussion. The IT Bill contained provisions relating to privacy, confidentiality, and security of information or data maintained in electronic form. However, the IT Bill has been withdrawn from the Federal Parliament of Nepal ('the Parliament') and a new bill to regulate the information technology sector has yet to be proposed as of this date.\n\n1.2. Guidelines\n\nPrivacy and data protection-related laws are in the early stages of development in Nepal. Furthermore, interpretation of the provisions of the Privacy Act and the Data Act by the courts is yet to be handed down.\n\n1.3. Case law\n\nThe following are case laws from the Supreme Court of Nepal ('the Supreme Court') in relation to privacy matters:\n\nBaburam Aryal v. The Government of Nepal [N.K.P. 2074, 25]:\n\nThe Supreme Court laid down that the right to privacy guaranteed by the Constitution is a fundamental right that may not be violated by the State or third parties. The Supreme Court further ruled that under the right to privacy, matters relating to a person's body, residence, property, documentation, data, communications, and character are inviolable, except as permitted by the law. An organization or department that collects information and has undertaken the responsibility of safeguarding such information must not use such information at its discretion. Instead, such an organization or department must protect such a 'data bank' of information at any cost. The Supreme Court further laid down that such an organization or department must not allow unauthorized access to such a data bank, even as an exception in the absence of a clear legal basis.\n\nSapana Pradhan Malla v. Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers et. al. [N.K.P. 2064, 1208]:\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the right to privacy guaranteed by the Constitution must be protected. An exception to this general principle is that information relating to a person may be shared with third parties only in cases where prior consent from the concerned person has been obtained.\n\nRoshani Poudel et. al. v. Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers et. al. [N.K.P. 2077, 1232]:\n\nThe Supreme Court held that it is imperative to guarantee that the right to privacy to protect people from discrimination and condemnation. Disclosure of personal information of a person or a citizen, except for a specific and legal purpose, violates the right against exploitation of the person or citizen, the right against violence, the right to privacy, the right to live with dignity and the established jurisprudence that govern the right to non-discrimination on the basis of health as well as international laws, the Constitution, and the Privacy Act.\n\n2. Scope of Application\n\n2.1. Personal scope\n\nArticle 28 of the Constitution guarantees the right to privacy as a fundamental right granted to all individuals. The Privacy Act reading in conjunction with the Civil Code and the Criminal Code strives to protect the personal information of individuals. The Constitution, Data Act, Privacy Act, Privacy Regulation, Civil Code, and Criminal Code have imposed obligations upon the State, state entities, organizations, legal entities, and all other agencies, that collect and retain personal information, to protect and safeguard such personal information.\n\n2.2. Territorial scope\n\nThe Privacy Act and the Data Act are silent on their applicability to foreign entities not having a physical presence in Nepal but are involved in data collection, use, or processing of personal information of Nepali citizens and individuals residing in Nepal or individuals located in Nepal. Generally, laws enacted by the Parliament will have extra-territorial jurisdiction only in cases where it is specifically provided in the legislation. Thus, from a strict interpretation of the Privacy Act, it does not seem to have extra-territorial applicability and thus is applicable only to entities registered in or operating within Nepal. We are yet to see a definite ruling from courts on various aspects of privacy laws including its extraterritorial applicability.\n\n2.3. Material scope\n\nNot applicable.\n\n3. Data Protection Authority | Regulatory Authority\n\n3.1. Main regulator for data protection\n\nThe Privacy Act and the Privacy Regulation do not establish a data protection authority or regulatory authority responsible for the administration and enforcement of privacy and data protection matters in Nepal. The Data Act provides provisions for the establishment of a National Data Office ('Data Office') for the sole purpose of acting as an entity to engage in tasks relating to data or statistics, i.e., a central data bank. Nonetheless, the Data Office hasn't been empowered to act as a regulatory agency.\n\n3.2. Main powers, duties and responsibilities\n\nNot applicable.\n\n4. Key Definitions\n\nData controller: The applicable laws do not define the term 'data controller.'\n\nData processor: The applicable laws do not define the term 'data processor.'\n\nPersonal data: Section 2(c) of the Privacy Act defines the term 'personal information' as:\n\ncaste, race, birth, origin, religion, color, or marital status of an individual;\n\neducation or academic qualification of an individual;\n\naddress, telephone, or email address of an individual;\n\npassport details, citizenship certificate, national identity number, driving license, voter identity card, or other identification card issued by any public body to an individual;\n\ncorrespondence sent or received by an individual containing personal information;\n\nfingerprint, palm lines, the retina of the eye, blood group, or other biometric information of an individual;\n\ndetails of criminal background, punishment, or sentence served by an individual for a criminal offense; and\n\nviews or opinions expressed by an individual in the capacity of a professional or an expert in a decision-making process.\n\nSensitive data: Section 27(2) of the Privacy Act defines the term 'sensitive information' as:\n\ncaste, race, or origin of an individual;\n\npolitical affiliation;\n\nreligious faith or belief;\n\nsexual orientation or an event relating to one's sex life; or\n\nparticulars relating to property.\n\nHealth data: The applicable laws do not define the term 'health data.'\n\nBiometric data: The term 'biometric data' is not defined under the applicable laws. Nonetheless, biometric data is regarded as 'personal information' under the Privacy Act.\n\nPseudonymization: The applicable laws do not define the term 'pseudonymization.'\n\n5. Legal Bases\n\n5.1. Consent\n\nConsent from an individual must be obtained before collecting or processing their personal information under the Privacy Act and the Privacy Regulation. However, neither the term 'consent' nor the procedure for obtaining it is defined.\n\nRule 5(2)(b) of the Privacy Regulation provides that consent in writing must be obtained from a data subject to disclose or publish their personal data stored in electronic medium. Similarly, Section 10(1)(b) of the Data Act also requires that the Data Office or governmental agencies or entities obtain consent in writing from an individual or their legal representative before disclosing or publishing their personal information to anyone other than authorized officers or using such personal information as evidence before any agency.\n\n5.2. Contract with the data subject\n\nWhilst consent from an individual is required to be obtained before collecting or processing their personal information, there is no requirement to enter into a data processing agreement or a contract with the person. Consent in writing in any form shall satisfy the requirements of the law.\n\n5.3. Legal obligations\n\nRule 11 of the Privacy Regulation provides that unless otherwise provided in other prevailing laws, the personal data of a person collected in accordance with the Privacy Act and the Privacy Regulation shall only be used for the purposes for which it has been collected. Section 13(3) of the Data Act also provides such protection.\n\nFurther, Section 8(1) of the Data Act imposes an obligation upon government agencies or any other entities, including private entities, to obtain permission from the Data Office before collecting or publishing data representing the national level. In addition, such data must be certified by the Data Office before publishing them or bringing them in use.\n\n5.4. Interests of the data subject\n\nUnder the Privacy Act, personal information or sensitive personal information may be processed, without the consent of an individual, in the event processing is required for alleviation, identification, or treatment of disease or health condition of the individual. However, such processing can only be done under the instruction of a licensed medical practitioner which must be done without insulting or humiliating the person.\n\n5.5. Public interest\n\nGovernmental agencies may collect or process personal information under the Privacy Act and the Privacy Regulation under 'public interest' grounds which are as follows:\n\nmaintenance of national security, peace, and order;\n\ninvestigation or prosecution of a criminal offense, other court action, or for law enforcement; and\n\npublic research and studies or for collecting public opinion.\n\n5.6. Legitimate interests of the data controller\n\nThe applicable laws do not provide for a specific provision whereby personal data or information may be collected, stored, or processed for the legitimate interest of the data controller.\n\n5.7. Legal bases in other instances\n\nNot applicable.\n\n6. Principles\n\nMajor principles of data processing, recognized under the applicable laws, include:\n\nLawfulness: The collection, storage, analysis, processing, or publishing of personal information is prohibited except authorized by the law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, personal information may be collected, processed, and used after obtaining consent from an individual.\n\nPrinciple of purpose limitation: A government agency or corporate body, that collects or processes personal information with the consent from an individual, must use such personal information for the specific purposes for which it is collected.\n\nAccuracy principle: In the event, an individual submits an application to a public body to correct their personal data, which are under the responsibility, control, or protection of such body, along with sufficient evidence requiring change, then the public body must correct the information in case it deems necessary to do so. However, such correction may be done only upon request basis. There is no provision for automatic correction of personal data.\n\nPrinciples of integrity and confidentiality: The applicable laws mandate public bodies to protect personal information under their control and responsibility and also to make proper arrangements against possible risks of unauthorized use, charge, disclosure, publication, or transmission of such personal information.\n\n7. Controller and Processor Obligations\n\n7.1. Data processing notification\n\nSection 5(1) of the Data Act provides authority to the Government to issue notification for the collection of data on any subject. Further, the Chief Data Officer of the Data Office is empowered to inspect of truthfulness of data collected by the Data Office. Similarly, Section 7(1) of the Data Act provides that apart from the Data Office, any governmental agency or public entity may collect data if so, provided by other prevailing laws. Section 12(1) of the Data Act provides that the Data Office, governmental agency, or public entity must process the data within the specified time using automated and modern methodology.\n\nApart from the above-mentioned provisions laid down by the Data Act, data processing notification is not required under the laws in force.\n\n7.2. Data transfers\n\nThe Privacy Act and the Privacy Regulation do not specifically provide provisions to regulate data transfers. However, Section 12(4) of the Privacy Act prohibits the disclosing, making public, or transferring of the following data of an individual, without their consent:\n\ndetails relating to a medical examination;\n\ndetails relating to property and income;\n\ndetails relating to employment;\n\ndetails relating to family matters;\n\nbiometric data and fingerprints;\n\nsignatures or electronic signatures;\n\ndetails relating to political affiliation and voting; and\n\ndetails relating to profession and business.\n\nThe term 'transfer' as mentioned above, may signify the transfer of personal data outside Nepal thereby requiring specific consent from the individual.\n\nThe Privacy Act and the Privacy Regulation do not contain provisions for the outsourcing of data.\n\n7.3. Data processing records\n\nApart from the obligation imposed by Section 12(1) of the Data Act upon the Data Office, governmental agency, or public entity to process data within the specified time by using automated and modern methodology, neither data processors nor data controllers are obliged to maintain a record of data processing activities undertaken by them.\n\n7.4. Data protection impact assessment\n\nNeither the Privacy Act nor the Privacy Regulation nor the Data Act requires date collector or controller to conduct data protection impact assessment for cross border transfer of personal data.\n\n7.5. Data protection officer appointment\n\nThe Privacy Act has yet to establish a data protection authority or regulatory authority responsible for the administration and enforcement of privacy and data protection-related matters. The Data Act envisages the appointment of a Chief Data Officer who shall act as an administrative chief of the Data Office. Unless, a data protection officer is appointed under other prevailing laws, i.e., the Privacy Act, etc., the Chief Data Officer of the Data Office shall act as a data protection officer for matters arising under the Data Act.\n\n7.6. Data breach notification\n\nThe prevailing data protection laws neither define the term 'data breach' nor contain provisions relating to notification in the event of data breach. Nonetheless, Section 25 of the Privacy Act imposes an obligation upon public entities, that collect or process personal information, to protect personal information and also to make necessary provisions for the protection of personal information against unauthorized use, tampering, divulgence, publication, or broadcasting. Further, Section 21(1) of the Data Act classifies an act of damaging or destroying public data as a criminal offense and prescribes punishment for such offense.\n\n7.7. Data retention\n\nSection 23(1) of the Privacy Act provides authority to an officer authorized under the law or a person authorized by such an officer to store personal information of an individual. However, the Privacy Act and the Privacy Regulation do not provide for a specific procedure nor a time duration for the retention of data.\n\nRule 81(1) of the Labor Regulations provides that an employer must record name, address, family details, citizenship certificate, contact phone number, email, and other details as deemed necessary by the employer. In addition, Rule 81(3) provides that the employer must retain records relating to the remuneration and attendance of an employee for a minimum period of five years.\n\n7.8. Children's data\n\nAnyone below the age of 18 years is considered to be a minor under Nepali laws. Under the Privacy Act, if any personal information to be obtained, published, or disclosed belongs to a minor, such information may be obtained, published, or disclosed only if the consent of their guardian or the person holding parental responsibility has been obtained. In addition, there are no other separate requirements to be fulfilled while processing personal information or data of a minor.\n\n7.9. Special categories of personal data\n\nThe processing of sensitive personal information is strictly prohibited under the Privacy Act, unless:\n\nit is required for prevention, alleviation, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease, or for protection of public health provided that such processing is done under the instruction of a licensed medical practitioner or a person directed by such practitioner; or\n\nan individual to whom such sensitive information belongs has already made such information public.\n\nKindly refer to the definition section above for the details as to what includes sensitive personal information under the Privacy Act.\n\n7.10. Controller and processor contracts\n\nNot applicable.\n\nThe Privacy Act and the Privacy Regulation do not specifically include provisions for a data controller and processor, nor regulate their relationship.\n\n8. Data Subject Rights\n\n8.1. Right to be informed\n\nSection 23(1) of the Privacy Act provides that an officer authorized under the laws or a person authorized by such an officer may collect the personal information of an individual.\n\nSection 23(4) of the Privacy Act provides that an officer, who collects personal information, has the responsibility of notifying the following details to an individual from whom personal information is being collected:\n\ntime for information collection;\n\nthe subject matter of information;\n\nnature of the information;\n\nmethod and procedure of analysis of information; and\n\nother matters including the protection of collected information.\n\nSection 25 of the Privacy Act further provides that a public agency, that collects personal information, has the following responsibilities:\n\nto protect the information collected;\n\nmake appropriate arrangements to secure such information against the risk of unauthorized access or unauthorized use; and\n\nto secure such information against the risk of an unauthorized amendment, disclosure, publication, or advertisement thereof.\n\nSimilarly, Section 13(1) of the Data Act provides that a data collector must inform the data subject about the purpose of data collection and matters relating to privacy prior to the collection of the data.\n\n8.2. Right to access\n\nSection 12(4)(d) of the Data Act provides that while distributing data collected under it, users shall have access to all kinds of data. Under Section 18(1) of the Data Act, the Data Office or governmental agencies or public entities may provide partial or full access to processed data, semi-processed data, or raw (primary) data to the public without disclosing the identity of the data subject which were collected by them pursuant to the provisions thereof.\n\n8.3. Right to rectification\n\nSection 28 of the Privacy Act provides provisions for rectification of inaccurate data. In the event that personal information, which is under the responsibility, protection, and control of a public body, is found to be inaccurate, then an individual may submit a request for rectification of the inaccurate personal information.\n\nThe right to rectification under the Privacy Act and the Privacy Regulation extends only to information collected by public bodies and not by private entities.\n\nUnlike rectification provisions in the Privacy Act, the Data Act incorporates different procedures for ensuring the accuracy of collected data. Section 6(1) of the Data Act provides the Chief Data Officer of the Data Office with the authority to inspect of truthfulness of data collected by the Data Office before publishing thereof.\n\n8.4. Right to erasure\n\nThere is no specific right to erasure under the Privacy Act or the Privacy Regulation or the Data Act.\n\n8.5. Right to object/opt-out\n\nNeither the Privacy Act, the Privacy Regulation nor the Data Act provides provisions regarding the right to withdraw consent once granted.\n\n8.6. Right to data portability\n\nThere is no provision regarding the right to data portability under the Privacy Act and the Privacy Regulation.\n\n8.7. Right not to be subject to automated decision-making\n\nNeither the Privacy Act nor the Privacy Regulation nor the Data Act provides provisions relating to the right not to be subject to automated decision-making.\n\n8.8. Other rights\n\nSection 26 of the Privacy Act requires consent of the data subject before an officer provides others with the personal information relating to the data subject which had been collected by or is under the control of a public agency or body corporate.\n\n9. Penalties\n\nA person, who commits an offence under the Privacy Act, is liable for a punishment of imprisonment of up to three years or a fine of up to NPR 30,000 (approx. $230), or both. (Section 29(2) of the Privacy Act)\n\nSection 29 of the Privacy Act prescribes punishment for the following offenses:\n\nbreaching privacy rights relating to an individual's physical and mental state;\n\nbreaching privacy rights of the physical body of an individual;\n\nmaking public biometric or genetic identity, gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual relationship, pregnancy or abortion information, or physical disease of an individual;\n\nsearching an individual or goods in possession of the individual, or being used by such individual without their consent;\n\nbreaching privacy relating to reproductive health and pregnancy of a woman;\n\nentering or searching the residence of an individual;\n\nentering an individual's residence breaching the privacy of the personal life of an individual or family members of the concerned individual;\n\nsearching the house of an individual only by virtue of the individual's arrest;\n\ninstalling a CCTV camera in an individual's residence;\n\nunauthorized entrance into a house, land, vehicle, or other property;\n\npublicizing or providing others with particulars relating to the property of an individual;\n\npublicizing personal documents of an individual, which are maintained by a public agency;\n\ndisclosing or publicizing the personal data of an individual;\n\nviolating privacy rights relating to letters, correspondences, emails, or communications made through electronic means or other;\n\nopening letters belonging to an individual;\n\nbreaching the privacy of an individual's character, personal conduct, and behavior;\n\ntaking or selling pictures of an individual;\n\nexpressing confidential information;\n\nbreaching the privacy of, or providing others with messages, information, or correspondences of an individual, which are maintained in an electronic medium;\n\nlistening to, transcribing, recording, transcribed or recorded communications, or conversations between two individuals taking place through an electronic medium;\n\nsurveying or spying on the residence or of the office of an individual;\n\noperating drones;\n\ncollecting, storing, protecting, analyzing, processing, or publishing personal information of an individual save for certain exceptions;\n\ncollecting information without informing the individual regarding the purpose for which the information is being collected;\n\ncollecting personal information by an authorized officer in contravention of the Privacy Act;\n\nusing personal information without the consent of an individual; or\n\nprocessing sensitive information by a public agency.\n\nIn the event that an individual who holds a public office contravenes the Privacy Act, such an individual will be subject to departmental and other punishment, in addition to the punishments stated above.
