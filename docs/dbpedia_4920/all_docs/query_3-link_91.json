        "text": "Edward Argar was yesterday announced as the 9th different prison minister since January 2018. Indeed the job has changed hands 5 times since September 2021. This constant change may be one of the factors contributing to the fact that our prison population is at record high levels. Mr Argar’s predecessor, Damian Hinds, has moved to the Department for Education and Gareth Bacon and Laura Farris have joined the Petty France team. Here are my usual brief biographies of the new ministerial team at Petty France.\n\nAlex Chalk – Justice Secretary\n\nAlex Chalk KC MP has been the Member of Parliament for Cheltenham since 2015. He was appointed as Minister of State in the Ministry of Defence in October 2022 and was formerly HM Solicitor General for England and Wales and the Prisons and Probation Minister.\n\nPrior to being elected in 2015, Alex was a barrister and prosecuted and defended in cases concerning terrorism, international fraud, and homicide.\n\nAs Justice Minister, Alex led the Domestic Abuse Bill through the Commons. For the first time in history, the Bill includes a wide-ranging legal definition of domestic abuse which incorporates a range of abuses beyond physical violence, including emotional, coercive or controlling behaviour, and economic abuse.\n\nDuring his time as Prisons Minister, Alex announced a new scheme to provide temporary, basic accommodation to prison leavers for twelve weeks as well as overhauling the unpaid work that offenders are ordered to do as part of community service.\n\nEdward Argar – Minister of State\n\nBorn in 1977, and originally from Kent, Mr Argar attended his local state grammar school before studying for a history degree at Oriel College, Oxford. Both his parents were teachers, his mother originally from a farming family and his father from an army family.\n\nAfter university he moved to London and spent four years working as a Political Adviser to the then Shadow Foreign Secretary focusing on Middle East policy and travelling extensively in the region. After that, he spent almost a decade working for private sector businesses including Hedra, Serco and Mouchel in management consultancy and communications jobs\n\nMr Argar has been the MP for Charnwood since 2015.\n\nHe was Minister of State at the Department of Health and Social Care between 10 September 2019 and 6 July 2022. He was previously Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice between 14 June 2018 and 10 September 2019.\n\nUntil this week’s re-shuffle, he was responsible for victims & courts but he has now got the key brief of prisons and probation with the revamped title of “Minister for Prisons, Parole and Probation”. His full responsibilities are:\n\nPrison operations, policy, reform and industrial relations\n\nProbation policy and operations\n\nYouth justice\n\nParole\n\nOffender health\n\nOffender Cohorts\n\nExtremism\n\nHome Detention Curfew (HDC)\n\nRelease on Temporary Licence (ROTL) schemes\n\nDrugs\n\nReducing reoffending\n\nFemale offenders\n\nForeign National Offenders\n\nLaura Farris – Parliamentary Under Secretary of State\n\nMs Farris worked as a journalist for BBC and Reuters and also worked for Hillary Clinton when she was a United States Senator for New York. She qualified as a barrister in 2007, practising mainly in employment law. Farris was appointed to the panel of counsel operated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2015 and has been the MP for Newbury since 2019. She is the new Minister for victims and violence against women and girls. Her responsibilities are:\n\nMinister for Victims and Violence against Women and Girls\n\nVictims and Witnesses\n\nRape and Serious Sexual Offences (RASSO)\n\nViolence against Women and Girls (VAWG)\n\nCriminal Law\n\nChild Sexual Abuse\n\nMiscarriages of Justice\n\nThe Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority\n\nLord Christopher Bellamy QC, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State\n\nSir Christopher Bellamy is a barrister who originally specialised in European, competition and regulatory law, and became a QC in 1986. In 1992 he was appointed as a judge to (what is now) the General Court of the European Union where he served for seven years. At the end of 1999 he returned to the UK to set up (what is now) the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), of which he was President until 2007. In 2007 Sir Christopher retired from the CAT and became a senior consultant with Linklaters LLP, and Chairman of the Linklaters Global Competition Practice in 2011. He stepped down from Linklaters at the end of October 2020, and rejoined Monckton Chambers.\n\nHis responsibilities are:\n\nMoJ business in the House of Lords (excluding Criminal Legal Aid)\n\nEU Retained Law policy\n\nPrivate International Law\n\nLegal Aid – (ex criminal)\n\nConstitution\n\nHuman Rights\n\nJudicial Review\n\nDevolution and the Union\n\nJudicial Policy\n\nCivil Justice\n\nModern Justice System: Legal Support; Dispute Resolution\n\nTribunals Policy\n\nCourt Recovery – Civil, Family, Tribunal\n\nFamily Justice and Marriage and Divorce\n\nHMCTS admin and performance in FT\n\nIllegal Migration (Lords)"
