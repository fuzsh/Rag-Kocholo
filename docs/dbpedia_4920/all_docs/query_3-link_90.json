        "text": "Are you considering a career change? The Diploma in Legal Studies is a two-year law course leading to: âœ… a qualification in law; and âœ… being eligible to sit the Entrance Examination for the degree of Barristerâ€“atâ€“Law. Many Diploma graduates have found the qualification to be of benefit in their current career or have gone on to use the qualification to open new career opportunities for them in the public service, private sector, or in the provision of legal services. The course starts in September.

We need to openly discuss the topic of South Africa producing more law graduates than it can train after they graduate. Some might argue that a lawyer can always open their own practice. The fact of the matter is that after obtaining an LLB one needs either articles or pupilage to practice law. Without these practical qualifications, opportunities are limited. The top tier law firms mainly focus on \"top law schools\". There are a number of Unisa graduates who cannot get articles, most of those are from underprivileged societies. They had to work to put themselves through school, my cousin is one of those graduates. I tried to dissuade her from studying law because of this, but she was passionate about it, to the extent that she paid for her degree herself. She is now sitting without a job. The Law Society, the Bars and Corporates need to put initiatives together to at least assist these students complete their articles/pupilage. In the past 2 years, MultiChoice legal worked with the law firm CMS to ensure that a young lady completed her articles and became a qualified attorney. We need more of these initiatives. #jobs #Law Society #Bar #Legal Articles #Joblessness #CMS"
