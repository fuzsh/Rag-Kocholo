Open justice reforms, including those that make justice system actors more transparent and accountable to citizens, can serve as a first step to addressing issues of fairness and independence.\n\nA full set of justice reforms will need to move beyond courts.

More. As in other areas, most OGP open justice commitments focus on making justice institutions more transparent. OGP members can build on these initiatives with commitments that also guarantee accountability mechanisms that strengthen the justice system’s independence, impartiality, and integrity.\n\nThe Open Government Partnership provides an opportunity for government and civil society reformers to make government more transparent, participatory, inclusive, and accountable. Working together, government and civil society co-create two-year action plans with concrete commitments across a broad range of issues. All commitments are then monitored by OGP’s Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM).[2] Thanks to increased global activity around justice in the last few years, a growing number of OGP members have begun to use their action plans to focus on reforms in the justice sector. Among these reforms, the largest subset focuses on making justice actors and institutions more transparent and subject to public scrutiny and monitoring.\n\nWhat is Justice and the Justice System?\n\nAlthough the concept of justice itself has several definitions, this article focuses on legal justice – that is, the idea that all people should receive the benefits, protections, and rights granted by law. The justice system, then, is the network of actors and institutions tasked with ensuring that justice is upheld. At a minimum, the justice system includes courts, judicial officials, and police. However, in most countries, the justice system also includes administrative tribunals and organizations around them – whether dealing with taxPlacing transparency, accountability, and participation at the center of tax policy can ensure that burdens are distributed equitably across society. Technical specifications: Commitments related to c..., immigration, or other issues. In some countries and regions, traditional or religious leaders may be part of the justice system. This paper is largely focused on the formal elements of the justice system. Yet it is important to keep these broad definitions in mind, as some administrative bodies – such as immigration courts – might be exempted from transparency and oversight practices common in the judiciaryWhile a majority of open government reforms occur within the executive branch, OGP members are increasingly taking on commitments to increase the openness of the judicial branch. Technical specificati....\n\nThough each of these actors is equally important in the communities they serve, it would be impossible to cover them all in one paper. Instead, this paper focuses on challenges and possible solutions for six actors that tend to be universal – and universally powerful – across legal systems. These actors are:\n\nCourts and judicial officials\n\nPolice\n\nProsecutors\n\nLegal aid\n\nPretrial services\n\nCorrections\n\nWhat is Open Justice?\n\nOpen justice applies the principles of open government – transparency, civic participation, and public accountabilityAccording to OGP’s Articles of Governance, public accountability occurs when ”rules, regulations, and mechanisms in place call upon government actors to justify their actions, act upon criticisms ...

These principles are not only important for courts, but also for the many other actors that play a role in the delivery of justice services.\n\nOther Dimensions of Justice\n\nThis paper is the second of three in a series on justice released as a part of the Open Government PartnershipThe Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a multi-stakeholder initiative focused on improving government transparency, ensuring opportunities for citizen participation in public matters, and strengthen... More Global Report. While each installment focuses on a distinct dimension of justice, all three elements are closely linked. The other papers in the series are as follows:\n\nAccess to Justice: focuses on how open government can help people identify and take action to address their legal needs.\n\nJustice for Enforcing Open Government: covers the ways in which the justice system can enforce the open government values of transparency, civic participation, and public accountability.\n\nWhy Open Justice?\n\nThe principles of open government – transparency, civic participation, and public accountability – are essential to a fair and effective justice system for several reasons that can be divided into two main categories:\n\nNormative and Legal\n\nThe principles of open justice are woven through international law and standards. The right to due process is enshrined in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)[3] and Articles 9-11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).[4]\n\nAn open justice system helps ensure that other civil and political rights are respected. When justice actors and processes are opaque and closed off from public scrutiny, the public are less able to verify that they effectively uphold citizens’ rights or identify violations of those rights. An open, independent, and impartial justice system serves as a foundation for better access to justiceAccessible justice systems – both formal and informal – ensure that individuals and communities with legal needs know where to go for help, obtain the help they need, and move through a system tha... More by fulfilling all people’s civil liberties and allowing individuals to more effectively protect their rights.\n\nInstrumental\n\nOpen justice underpins the rule of law. Justice actors and processes that are transparent and subject to independent oversight enable rule by law and help ensure an orderly and fair society.[5]\n\nOpen justice supports equitable growth and development. In strengthening the rule of law, open justice can help countries achieve economic and social progress by curbing corruption, limiting abuse of power, and guaranteeing access to key public services.[6]\n\nAn open justice system allows for peaceful and reliable conflict resolution mechanisms. Open justice reforms improve the quality of justice and make justice institutions fairer, in turn, increasing their legitimacy in the eyes of the public. People can depend on these institutions to resolve conflict peacefully rather than by resorting to violence.\n\nWhat Do Open Justice Reforms Look Like?\n\nEach of the three principles of open government presents specific implications for the operations of justice system actors. OGP staff discussed the issue with dozens of OGP partners (through interviews and consultations), scoured OGP results, and undertook a significant process of review and revision. Drawing on the information uncovered through these steps, this paper identifies some of the most important reforms, examples of which follow. Each section of the paper will offer examples of these reforms from countries inside and outside of OGP. Briefly, definitions and examples of open justice reforms following each of the open government principles are as follows:\n\nTransparency: Government disclosure of information or improvement of the quality of information disclosed to the public. Provisions and activities to ensure transparency in the justice system could include the following:\n\nOpen dataBy opening up data and making it sharable and reusable, governments can enable informed debate, better decision making, and the development of innovative new services. Technical specifications: Polici...\n\nClear, publicly available operating procedures\n\nPublic access to decisions and opinions\n\nInformation about public officials\n\nCivic Participation: The ability of the public to inform or influence government processes and decision-making. Provisions and activities to ensure civic participation in the justice system could include the following:\n\nProcesses for public complaints about justice system actors\n\nCitizen and/or publicly observable independent oversight boards\n\nParticipatory budgeting processes\n\nLegal aid providers and other members of civil society that make information about the justice system and justice processes more accessible\n\nPublic Accountability: Opportunities to hold officials answerable or subject them to sanctions for their actions. Provisions and activities to ensure public accountability in the justice system could include the following:\n\nProcesses for public complaints about justice system actors\n\nCitizen and/or publicly observable independent oversight boards\n\nFair disciplinary processes that allow for sanctions and removal, the details of which are publicly available\n\nNote: In the case of justice actors, and especially judicial officials, increased accountability must be carefully balanced with considerations of impartiality and independence. Public accountability reforms must not jeopardize judicial independence.\n\nPARTNERS WORKING ON OPEN JUSTICE\n\nThe following are some of the organizations and international bodies working on open justice topics:\n\nNamati: Namati and its partners in the Legal Empowerment Network advance access to information about law and justice processes through grassroots legal empowerment.\n\nTask Force on Justice: Launched in 2018 as an initiative of the Pathfinders for Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies, the Task Force on Justice brings together UN member states, international organizations, civil society, and the private sectorGovernments are working to open private sector practices as well — including through beneficial ownership transparency, open contracting, and regulating environmental standards.

Commitments in this area may address persons with disabilities, women and girls, lesbian, gay, bisexual, tr... More.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC): UNODC’s guidance and rules set the international standard on a variety of justice system topics, including policing, judicial independence and conduct, legal aid provision, and prison conditions, especially for women and children.\n\nWorld Justice Project (WJP): WJP’s Rule of Law Index evaluates countries on a variety of indicators, including on police and criminal and civil justice institutions. Additional special reports use survey data to analyze perceptions of criminal justice institutions, for example in Afghanistan.\n\nOpen Justice in OGP\n\nJustice is one of the most common areas of focus in OGP action plans. Justice has grown as an area of focus in OGP action plans over the last several cycles thanks to growing global momentum for action and innovation in the justice sector.[7] As of July 2020, OGP members have collectively made nearly 300 commitments that focus on making justice more accessible, open, and effective.\n\nAmong justice commitments, the largest subset (137 commitments) are related to topics in open justice. To date, most of these commitments have focused on transforming the courts (see Figure I) and fewer have aimed to make improvements to other important justice system actors.\n\nOpen justice commitments are disproportionately concentrated in the Americas. Fifty percent of all open justice commitments are from members in the Americas region while the Americas only represent a third of commitments overall.\n\nOpen justice commitments tend to be more effective than other commitments. In terms of results, according to data from IRM reports, 25% of open justice commitments have led to significant improvements in government practice. This is higher than other justice commitments overall (21%) and OGP commitments overall (19%).\n\nThe majority of open justice commitments focus on the transparency of justice institutions by making information and data more accessible. This pattern mirrors trends in OGP commitments overall (see Figure 2). These reforms are too rarely coupled with measures that allow civil society and the public to monitor these actors and hold them accountable when they take actions that could harm the citizens they serve.\n\nFigure 1.

In 2020, the rule of law has declined in more countries than it has improved in, continuing a three-year trend.[8] In many countries, corruption is on the rise while respect for fundamental rights and constraints on government power continue to deteriorate.[9]\n\nOpen justice reforms can serve as an antidote to these concerning developments. As the data in the previous section indicates, OGP commitments often make significant improvements to governance outcomes. However, to continue this momentum, more governments across all regions must make justice – and in particular, open justice – a priority in their action plans. Recognizing that each justice system is different and various actors within these systems face unique challenges, the international community must propose adaptable solutions that address countries’ needs.\n\nThis paper responds to these concerns by offering emerging guidance, examples, and recommendations for the types of open government reforms justice systems may undertake to advance open justice in their institutions. The paper will be useful to practitioners and reformers in government or civil society looking for ideas to tackle some of the issues their justice system faces and case studies, as well as success stories from other countries. In the longer term, the paper seeks to encourage more OGP members to commit to open justice reforms in their action plans, so in this way, the paper is especially relevant to members of the OGP community. However, the suggestions and examples are also applicable to a broader audience of reformers interested in justice.\n\nImportantly, this paper is not exhaustive, and many examples and approaches may be missing from the pages that follow. Similarly, the guidance provided here is not comprehensive and therefore should not be viewed as an instruction manual or best practices guide for open justice reforms. Instead, this paper will be most useful to reformers as a foundation for brainstorming ideas, an entry point for peer learning, and a starting point for seeking further resources.\n\nThis paper comprises nine chapters, covering the justice system actors and topics listed in the previous section. Each chapter begins with the following:\n\nAn overview of the topic and its relevance to open government\n\nA discussion of the reasons open justice reforms stand to improve the function of the justice institution in question.\n\nThe body of each chapter includes the following sections:\n\nExamples of OGP commitments on the topic\n\nCase studies from around the world of unique and/or successful reforms\n\nRelevant international and regional guidance\n\nRecommendations and example reforms\n\nCourts\n\nOPEN COURT DATA\n\nOverview\n\nAs the branch of government that is least responsive to changing public opinion, judiciaries have also been slow to embrace the institutional transparency that has increasingly become the expectation in many countries. Efforts to maintain judicial independence and protect courts from undue political influence often result in a dearth of publicly available court information.\n\nYet as open access to government data becomes the norm across societies, the courts are increasingly inundated with data requests and are falling behind on their disclosure obligations. These requests may be better served by proactively releasing court data, for example, data related to case status, charges, pleadings, motions, judgments, and sentencing. Additionally, as more courts use algorithms to automate processes such as pre-trial risk assessments and sentencing decisions, proactive algorithmic transparency can help identify and prevent instances of bias and discrimination. Proactively publishing these data can improve the responsiveness of the justice system, incentivizing fair and efficient court activity. It also promotes public trust in judicial institutions, which is crucial for the rule of law.\n\nRecommendations and Sample Reforms\n\nThe following are actions judiciaries and governments can take to improve the transparency of their court systems, listed from simplest to implement to more advanced.\n\nPublish basic judicial data. Begin by publishing information about what takes place in the courtroom.[10] For example, a survey of open judicial data regimes finds that judicial data sets should at least include court decisions, case registers, filed document records, and statistical data.[11]\n\nEnsure operational transparency. Collect information that allows measurement of how judicial officials do their jobs. This includes information about how many cases judicial officials are assigned in a year, how quickly they process the cases on their docket, how many cases they complete in a year, how they decide cases, and how frequently their rulings are overturned on appeal.[12]\n\nEnsure algorithmic transparency. The use of automated decision-making technology and the algorithms employed should be disclosed to identify and prevent discrimination.[13]\n\nPost-case filings and decisions in proceedings. Make documentation available at the individual case level by publishing, for example, charges, transcripts from hearings and depositions, judgments, and the reasoning for judgments. Courts should take into account methods of protecting the privacy of vulnerable individuals, such as victims of crime or children, when releasing this information.[14] Courts can also publish information about processes to ensure privacy protection, for example, in family law cases.\n\nIdentify and remedy inequity. Collect, maintain, and report court data regarding race, ethnicity, geography, class, and religion that allow courts to identify and remedy racial and other disparities. See the resolution from the Conference of Chief Justices and Conference of State Court Administrators (US).[15]\n\nImprove accessibility of court data. Create a centralized portal for court data and allow bulk data downloads to enable access to all court data from a single source.\n\nStandardize court data. Ensure that courts in different jurisdictions and at different levels of the judicial system standardize the content and format of the data sets they disclose. This may include improving the linkages between data at different instances.\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nBuenos Aires criminal courts publish a repositoryAccess to relevant information is essential for enabling participation and ensuring accountability throughout the OGP process. An OGP repository is an online centralized website, webpage, platform or ... of decisions\n\nCriminal Courts 10 and 13 both created an open data repository with all judgments organized by the type of felony, the type of punishment, a description of the case, and a link to the complete decision. The court makes special efforts to anonymize the data to address privacy concerns. Court 13 also publishes plain-language versions of its decisions. Both courts open hearings to the public and publish a schedule of hearings in advance.\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nColombia improves judicial services through court transparency\n\nAfter a 2015 declaration by the Council of State (Colombia’s highest administrative court) to improve transparency and accountability in the justice system, Colombia established the Transparency and Accountability Commission, which was tasked with taking up this initiative. As part of its work, the commission led a 2015 OGP commitment through which they began to publish court data and information, including court memoranda and decisions, information about the court’s officials, and the court’s agenda.[16] As part of the commitment, the Council of State also published procedural manuals for a variety of court processes, such as the tutela, a constitutional rights protection claim available to all citizens. These measures helped the Council of State become more transparent than ever before. Still, corruption and distrust of justice institutions continued, and Colombia extended its efforts into its subsequent action plan. The Council of State’s 2017 commitment aims to implement a variety of digital tools to further increase the court’s transparency, including technological tools that allow citizens to monitor the magistrate election process, a mechanism for citizens to submit complaints and claims online, and better documentation of court processes and requirements.[17]\n\nOTHER OGP COMMITMENTS\n\nCzech Republic: Publish all district, regional, and high court decisions in a searchable online database (2018-2020).\n\nGreece: Create a publicly accessible case-law database including anonymized decisions of all administrative courts (2019-2021).\n\nParaguay: Create an open justice data portal (2018-2020).\n\nSlovakia: Create a system to ensure uniform reporting of all judicial decisions (2015-2017).\n\nUruguay: Publish video recordings of all public hearings, as well as statistical information from the judicial branch (2016-2018, 2018-2020).\n\nGuidance and Standards\n\nThe National Center for State Courts – National Open Courts Data Standard (NODS)\n\nIn 2018, two US civil society organizations – the National Center for State Courts and Measures for Justice – partnered to create the NODS .[18] The project seeks to provide publicly available standardized, case-level court data to improve court system transparency and improve public policy. NODS includes case-level reporting in a variety of areas, such as the following:\n\nCase status and details\n\nLitigant and lawyer information\n\nPleadings\n\nMotions, filings, and orders\n\nCharges\n\nJudgments\n\nSanctions\n\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Resources (UNODC)\n\nUNODC and its Global Judicial Integrity Network provide guidance on how judiciaries can improve and strengthen their systems for the management of courts and cases, maintenance of records, and transparency in the judicial system, in particular through the Implementation Guide and Evaluative Framework for Article 11 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption[19] and the Resource Guide on Strengthening Judicial Integrity and Capacity.[20] The network also promotes peer learning and information sharing on these topics through various activities, including podcasts, opinion editorials, and webinars.\n\nJUDICIAL OFFICERS – APPOINTMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n\nOverview\n\nJudicial officers – including judges, magistrates, and other officials with powers to facilitate and decide legal disputes – have the authority to protect human rightsAn essential part of open government includes protecting the sacred freedoms and rights of all citizens, including the most vulnerable groups, and holding those who violate human rights accountable. T..., make wrongs right, and resolve intractable conflicts. As such, their appointment (or election where applicable) must be transparent, based on objective criteria, and free of corruption so that the public has faith in their independence, impartiality, and integrity. Transparent appointments also help the public hold appointing authorities accountable in selecting qualified judicial officers.\n\nOnce judicial officers have assumed their role, their conduct and track record matter. Justice systems can make judicial officers’ decisions or rulings publicly available (except in cases when privacy must be considered) to ensure the fairness and predictability of the system.[21] More generally, judicial officers must abide by relevant standards of professional conduct and act with independence, impartiality, and integrity. If they fail to meet these standards, judicial officers should be accountable through a complaints procedure that allows for a review of their conduct by an independent oversight authority capable of fair proceedings and discipline, including removal. The outcomes of complaints and any disciplinary proceedings should be made publicly available and transparent.\n\nImportantly, countries considering reforms in this area should take into account that accountability mechanisms for judicial officers should not in any way threaten judicial independence and should therefore differ from accountability mechanisms for other branches of government. In particular, promotions, terminations, and disciplinary actions should never be determined on political grounds and must be shielded from undue influence by the executive branch (see Principles 11-20 of the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary referenced later in this chapter).\n\nRecommendations and Sample Reforms\n\nOGP members can take the following actions to improve meritorious, transparent judicial appointments:\n\nPublish necessary qualifications and examination standards. If recruitment occurs via examinations, they should be established by the state with common, transparent standards and given anonymously.[22] Ensure that standards are nondiscriminatory and genderOGP participating governments are bringing gender perspectives to popular policy areas, ensuring diversity in participatory processes, and specifically targeting gender gaps in policies to address gov... More and ethno-culturally neutral.\n\nPublish term limits and appointment terms. Transparent term limits, mandatory retirement ages, or lifetime appointments insulate the judiciary from political purging.\n\nRequire transparent nominations. If recruitment occurs via nomination and appointment, the procedure should be fully transparent to reveal the candidate’s qualifications vis-à-vis other publicly announced candidates to avoid political favoritism.[23]\n\nPublicly vet candidates. Consider publicizing interviews of candidates. Allow feedback on candidates from the legal profession and civil society to hear external evidence of a candidate’s fitness. Publicize reasons for final appointments.\n\nRequire judicial officials to declare assets and financial interests. This includes outside activities, employment, investments, assets, and substantial gifts and benefits from which a conflict may result.[24]\n\nPublicize and report on measures to diversify judicial officers, through recruitment, retention, and training. Take measures so that judicial officials reflect the gender balance and social diversity of the country.[25]\n\nThe following are actions judiciaries and governments can take to improve judicial accountability and independence:\n\nPublish a judicial code of conduct. Write and publish codes that support a learned, independent, and impartial judiciary. Making these codes publicly accessible allows citizens to hold the judiciary accountable by filing suit for egregious errors. See the Global Judicial Integrity Network’s “Guide on Resource Guide on Strengthening Judicial Integrity“[26] for more guidance.\n\nInvolve justices in developing standards. Invite judicial involvement in creating and updating codes of conduct. Ownership of ethical standards promotes compliance.\n\nPerform comprehensive evaluations. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) provides a list of data that should be collected[27] to assess a court system, including which sources can provide pertinent information and what questions should be asked when analyzing this information. Note: Evaluations should not include successful appeals against judicial officials’ rulings, as this might affect their decision-making.\n\nImplement and publish court self-evaluations. Self-assessment mechanisms, such as the one offered by the UNODC Implementation Guide and Evaluative Framework for Article 11 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption[28] and the International Consortium for Court Excellence,[29] can help courts maintain accessible, efficient, and innovative services.\n\nUse and publish disciplinary measures. Facilitate accountability by accepting feedback from both judicial members and the public. Ensure that disciplinary standards address all judicial integrity issues, including cases of gender bias, sex discrimination, and sexual misconduct. Disciplinary measures should be proportionate to the offense and might range from internal written warnings to public acknowledgment of ethical deviations to removal from office.[30]\n\nAdopt continuing education programs. Programs can discuss legislative developments, judicial ethics, docket management, technology use, and international developments. This education should be accessible to all judicial officials and include various learning methods (e.g., self-learning, in-person, or interactive learning).[31]\n\nFacilitate judicial integrity networking. For example, the Global Judicial Integrity Network offers networking opportunities at the local, regional, and global level. Limit initial meetings focusing on judicial integrity to only judicial officials to allow for free and open peer-to-peer discussion before inviting public participationGiving citizens opportunities to provide input into government decision-making leads to more effective governance, improved public service delivery, and more equitable outcomes. Technical specificatio....\n\nPublish judicial decisions. Access to the country’s laws and judicial decisions should be free. Some decisions may need to be withheld or anonymized to protect privacy concerns, including the identity of juveniles.[32]\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nKenya initiates judicial vetting\n\nIn 2010, Kenya approved a new democratic constitution by public referendum. In response to years of government corruption, including at high levels of the judiciary, the framers sought to enshrine democratic institutions and the rule of law in the new constitution. To do so, they included a provision that stipulates all judicial officials and magistrates appointed under the previous constitution undergo vetting by an independent board. The details of this provision are affirmed in a 2011 law that the judicial official and magistrate vetting board would comprise nine members, including six citizens, three of whom must be lawyers. Following this legislation, Kenya made an OGP commitment in 2012 to implement the newly required processes. Throughout 2012, the board vetted dozens of judicial officials at various levels of the judiciary and determined that several officials were unfit to serve. Putting the judiciary under the microscope in this way helped restore citizen trust in and legitimacy to the institution in a new era. However, while innovative, this approach was not without controversy, and civil society raised concerns that lawyers on the board were too lenient on some judicial officials alleged to have engaged in corruption while removing other judicial officials without legitimate reasoning.\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nDenmark establishes whistleblower portals for justice system employees\n\nFollowing revelations in 2018 that senior justice officials had withheld key documents in an investigation of police misconduct during a 2012 protest against Chinese President Hu Jintao’s state visit, Denmark made an OGP commitment in 2019 to improve accountability for justice system officials.[33],[34] The commitment seeks to establish a whistleblower scheme in the Ministry of Justice, prosecutor service, police, and prison service, among other justice system institutions. The new procedures will provide mechanisms through which employees or partners of any of these institutions can report individual or systemic wrongdoing. The online portal will also allow whistleblowers to file their complaints anonymously and enable the authorities investigating the complaints to communicate with whistleblowers while maintaining their anonymity. This system could allow for great accountability for justice system officials and, ultimately, the provision of fairer justice services.\n\nSlovak Republic legislates transparent selection of judicial officials\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nThe Slovak Republic used its 2017 action plan to help address weak judicial independence and a lack of public trust in judicial decisions.[35] Among other reforms, the country passed legislationCreating and passing legislation is one of the most effective ways of ensuring open government reforms have long-lasting effects on government practices. Technical specifications: Act of creating or r... that standardized selection procedures for judicial officials and established a committee that will oversee such processes in the future. Information about these procedures – including lists of candidates and their résumés – is now publicly available online, which allows for public scrutiny of the candidates as well. Over time, reforms like this one can help build public trust in judicial institutions.\n\nOTHER OGP COMMITMENTS\n\nArgentina: Publish information about selection processes, complaint mechanisms, and disciplinary procedures for judicial officials (2017-2019).\n\nCosta Rica: Develop an online “judicial observatory system,” which enables citizens to monitor how long open cases take to be concluded (2019-2021).\n\nJalisco, Mexico: Implement safeguards to avoid judicial officials’ conflicts of interest by working with citizens to review and update the system for selecting expert witnesses during trials (2019-2021).\n\nParaguay: Publish accusations and disciplinary procedures against judicial officials more transparently for citizens through an online digital system (2018-2020).\n\nGuidance and Standards\n\nThe United Nations – Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary\n\nThe UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary,[36] adopted by the UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders and endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 1985, lays out 20 principles to secure and promote the independence of the judiciary.\n\nPrinciple 10, related to qualifications, selection, and training, provides the following:\n\n10. Persons selected for judicial office shall be individuals of integrity and ability with appropriate training or qualifications in law. Any method of judicial selection shall safeguard against judicial appointments for improper motives. In the selection of judicial officials, there shall be no discrimination against a person on the grounds of race, colour, sex, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or status, except that a requirement, that a candidate for judicial office must be a national of the country concerned, shall not be considered discriminatory.\n\nPrinciples 17-20, related to discipline, suspension, and removal, provide the following:\n\n17. A charge or complaint made against a judicial official in his/her judicial and professional capacity shall be processed expeditiously and fairly under an appropriate procedure. The judicial official shall have the right to a fair hearing. The examination of the matter at its initial stage shall be kept confidential, unless otherwise requested by the judicial official.\n\n18. judicial officials shall be subject to suspension or removal only for reasons of incapacity or behaviour that renders them unfit to discharge their duties.\n\n19. All disciplinary, suspension, or removal proceedings shall be determined in accordance with established standards of judicial conduct.\n\n20. Decisions in disciplinary, suspension, or removal proceedings should be subject to an independent review. This principle may not apply to the decisions of the highest court and those of the legislature in impeachment or similar proceedings.\n\nThe United Nations – Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct\n\nThe Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct,[37] developed in 2002 by the Judicial Integrity Group and endorsed by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in 2006, establish standards for the ethical conduct of judicial officials and revolve around six values necessary for an effective and principled judiciary: independence, impartiality, integrity, equality, propriety, and competence and diligence. The Bangalore Principles are accompanied by a detailed Commentary published in 2007, which, among others, touches upon the issues of qualifications, selection, and training (paragraph 10) or conditions of service and tenure (paragraph 11).\n\nThe Global Judicial Integrity Network\n\nOfficially established in 2018, the Global Judicial Integrity Network[38] was launched by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. The network aims to promote peer learning and support activities, facilitate access to relevant tools and resources related to judicial integrity, and support the further development and effective implementation of principles of judicial conduct and the prevention of corruption within the justice system. Among its outputs, the Global Judicial Integrity Network has developed several knowledge products and tools addressing pertinent integrity-related topics, such as the development and implementation of codes of judicial conduct,[39] gender-related issues,[40] judicial officials’ use of social media,[41] and judicial ethics training.[42]\n\nCOURT MODERNIZATION\n\nOverview\n\nTo ensure accessibility and fairness and to protect against corruption, courts must be able to manage cases efficiently and reliably. Although not a requirement for an efficient court system, digital technology has become an increasingly popular tool to modernize courts and achieve these outcomes. In particular, tools such as online case management systems and the availability of virtual court proceedings can help improve access to information about court processes and simplify court services. These tools can encompass a variety of services, including e-filing, case tracking, automatic notices to appear in court and hearing date reminders, online dispute resolution services, and the publication of digital recordings of court proceedings.\n\nThese features, when integrated into an online platform, improve access to information about justice processes, allow citizens to engage with the system remotely – especially those who have traditionally lacked access to such processes – and reduce wait times by freeing up judicial officials’ and other court employees’ time. Furthermore, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, online court processes can help courts avoid inefficiencies and increase the accessibility of their services while mitigating public health risks.\n\nRecommendations and Sample Reforms\n\nThe following are actions for governments implementing or considering implementing online case management systems to ensure that they maximize the transparency and accountability of the court system.\n\nEnsure that automation is an appropriate response to court system needs. Often court backlogs can result from a variety of issues, including corruption among court officials or a lack of communication and trust between justice sector institutions. While court automation can improve efficiency, it will not solve these underlying issues.\n\nEngage potential users early on to encourage trust and transparency in the new system. Court automation often presents major changes to how courts operate. Transparency about these changes and the potential improvements that may result could help combat skepticism, among court staff, litigants, lawyers, bar associations, and the general public. User-test technology with the public during development. Verify that the system meets user needs by ensuring accessibility, use of plain language, and availability in all languages commonly spoken among the population that the system serves.[43]\n\nStandardize the collection and presentation of information. Ensure that courts across different jurisdictions and across various levels of the system collect the same information to allow for cross-comparison.\n\nProvide access to information to litigants and the public. Automated systems have great potential to lower barriers to access to public information. Records requests, information on pending litigation, and notices of disposition can be substantially streamlined by automation.\n\nExtend court modernization to other parts of the court system. Court modernization is often piloted in one or a few courts. If pilots are successful, justice systems can begin implementation across the system to specialized courts, other jurisdictions, and other levels of the court system.\n\nFocus on interagency communication and interoperability within government. Courts can conserve significant resources by designing systems that facilitate efficient communication with other courts, correctional facilities, and agencies that manage identity, financial, and land records.\n\nConsider how e-court processes can improve efficiency during the Covid-19 pandemic. Processes such as e-filing, online dispute resolution, digital case look-up, and/or remote hearings can enable courts to continue proceedings in light of the ongoing public health risks of conducting such processes in person.[44]\n\nConduct training for judicial officials and court staff. Court automation systems will work best if court staff use and maintain them properly. Comprehensive training, often including training on basic computer skills, can improve uptake.\n\nImplement effective monitoring and evaluation processes. Monitoring is an important accountability mechanism to ensure that the investment in court automation is used effectively to serve citizens by improving access to justice. These could include backlog reduction indicators and court user surveys that could help courts evaluate citizens’ engagement with the new system.\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nKenya’s commercial courts are transitioning to e-court processes.\n\nWithout a system for electronic filing, court records in Kenya have been maintained in libraries of thousands of often-disorganized paper documents. This makes it challenging for court officials to keep track of cases, leading to debilitating backlogs for judicial officials and delayed judgments for citizens. In 2012, Kenya made an OGP commitment to modernize the judiciary with the goal of improving the courts’ efficiency, transparency, and accountability.[45] Among the initiatives included in the commitment, Kenya implemented software that would allow case proceedings and judgments to be made available online, enabling Kenyans to access and download cases and judgments online for the first time. The government also hoped to implement software that would randomly assign new cases to judicial officials to avoid bias and conflicts of interest in judgments, although this was not achieved by the end of the action plan. This has allowed scholars to identify significant ethnic bias in judicial decisions, pointing to the need to improve recruitment and training in high courts.[46]\n\nBuilding on these initiatives, in 2017, Kenya continued attempts to digitize and automate certain court processes to address case backlogs and delays.[47] In a pilot carried out at the Commercial and Tax division of the High Court, the Kenyan judiciary began digitizing case files and centralizing them using case management software.[48] The system also includes a variety of other functions aimed at making court information more accessible and proceedings more efficient. For example, a public-facing case-tracking portal allows court users to check the status of their case online, and an e-payment platform helps citizens navigate the previously complex fee payment processes.\n\nOTHER OGP COMMITMENTS\n\nAlbania: Implement an online inspection, make judicial hearings available online through their integrated case management system, and digitize court files to simplify transferring information between court levels of the judiciary (2012-2014).\n\nBrazil: Implement an electronic system for judicial proceedings in the electoral courts to reduce court delays (2016–2018).\n\nCosta Rica: Create an online observatory to ensure efficient management of cases and reduce delays in delivering decisions (2019–2020).\n\nGreece: Implement an electronic system to monitor the status of all pending cases and allow electronic submission of documents for all parties (2016–2018).\n\nMontenegro: Establish the National Administrative Fee Collection System in order to simplify the payment of court fees for citizens and improve monitoring of outstanding payments (2018–2020).\n\nGuidance and Standards\n\nUnited States: The National Center for State Courts – Consolidated Case Management Functional Standards\n\nThe installation of case management software will not on its own ensure greater efficiency and openness. It must also be sustainable and user-friendly and collect the right information. The National Center for State Courts in the U.S. published its Consolidated Case Management Functional Standards in 2006.[49] These standards describe general capabilities that courts’ systems should support in a variety of categories, including the following:\n\nScheduling\n\nDocket management\n\nDocument creation and tracking\n\nRecords management\n\nCourt proceedings recording\n\nCourts – Resources and Partners\n\nResources\n\nThe International Consortium for Court Excellence publishes the Court Excellence Self-Assessment Questionnaire, which enables courts to evaluate their performance in seven areas.\n\nThe National Center for State Courts produces resources for using technology in courts and case flow management.\n\nUSAID’s Designing and Implementing Court Automation Projects outlines key considerations for court modernization.\n\nUNDP’s Judicial Integrity Self-Assessment Checklist is a useful tool to help judiciaries assess their courts.\n\nThe Global Judicial Integrity Network’s resources include a guide on How to Develop and Implement Codes of Judicial Conduct.\n\nUNODC’s Resource Guide on Strengthening Judicial Capacity and Integrity outlines best practices for a variety of court processes, including court transparency, judicial official recruitment, evaluation, selection, and disciplinary measures.\n\nOrganizations\n\nCenter for Court Innovation\n\nGlobal Judicial Integrity Network (established by UNODC)\n\nInternational Consortium for Court Excellence\n\nNational Center for State Courts (NCSC) (United States) and NCSC International\n\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)\n\nPolice\n\nOPEN POLICE DATA\n\nOverview\n\nA lack of transparent or comparable police data inhibits the public and policymakers’ ability to fully understand and address problematic police practices and their consequences. OGP members are increasingly taking the initiative to open police data with the ultimate aim of evidence-based police reform.\n\nTransparent data on police-citizen interaction is a vital tool to assess the efficacy and fairness of interactions between citizens and the police. Open data in areas like public complaints, officer-involved deaths, and use of force provides the foundation for informed research, policy reforms, and oversight. Specifically, open data enables evaluation of law enforcement’s fairness in their interactions with the public. Separately, the publication of police department budgets and expenditures ensures that public funding of law enforcement meets the needs of all citizens. Therefore, requiring police departments to provide accessible data is an essential first step toward strengthening public accountability and building public trust. Of course, police departments must also be cautious to protect individuals’ right to privacy and need to have fair, well-publicized processes for ensuring that open data respects the rights of victims, witnesses, and the accused.\n\nRecommendations and Sample Reforms\n\nThe following are actions governments can take to ensure that they maximize the transparency and accountability of the police.\n\nCodify police data collection and publication in law. Amend policing and right to informationThe legal right to request information from the government allows the public to follow government decision-making, participate in ensuring better decisions, and hold the government accountable. Techni... legislation to require greater transparency.\n\nInvolve citizens early. Convene law enforcement and public officials, civil society organizations, and members of the public to identify priority information for collection, disclosure, and privacy protection.\n\nSystematically collect and retain standardized policing data. Establish routine procedures that ensure various agencies use common terminology, categorization, and collection practices for data.\n\nPublish policing budget data. Regularly provide up-to-date data on government budgets for law enforcement as well as data on police expenditures. Aim to disclose information disaggregated at the police precinct level.\n\nRelease data through an accessible online database. Provide current data in a free and downloadable format to ensure transparency. Provide disaggregated demographic data to measure the fairness of police interactions with the public and to facilitate analysis of particular patterns.\n\nPublish data-restriction policies. Publish, in clear and accessible language, information on standards and practices that inform what police information is classified or restricted. Include the public in shaping policies that determine what information is classified or restricted.\n\nOrganize the data. Ensure that data can be downloaded, searched, and machine-read to facilitate researchers and community members’ data analysis.\n\nDevelop standards for comparison. Comparable data enables better research and policy responses. While some governments may begin with a data standard, others will have more success in working toward cross-jurisdictional consensus on common data collected and published.\n\nTranslate data into digestible formats. Provide graphics and written narratives that help the general public observe important trends and findings within the data.\n\nFacilitate data-driven publications and policy changes. Actively collaborate with civil society organizations, researchers, and other stakeholders to produce reports and recommendations based on findings from collaborative data analysis.\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nOpen Police Data Initiative in the United States\n\nThe United States government undertook the Open Police Data Initiative[50] as part of its 2015 National Action Plan to address high levels of distrust and tension between police and the public.[51] The initiative encourages local police jurisdictions to proactively extract and publish policing data. The project is managed collaboratively by the Department of Justice’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services and the nonprofit organization, the National Police Foundation. The initiative increased access to information by creating a centralized database that comprises over 130 jurisdictions and 405 data sets as of June 2020, including cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Detroit. The website also provides tools to extract, analyze, and publish data. This repository has led to published data sets in numerous areas, including on police use of force and officer-involved shootings. However, agency participation is voluntary, and the adoption rate remains low. Additionally, there is a need to improve data standardization and ensure regular updates. Recent unrest across the United States has reignited interest in open police data as reformers call for greater police transparency. This initiative demonstrates a viable process to further open police data with the ultimate aim to reduce bias and unnecessary use of force in policing tactics and increase public trust.\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nLegislating policing transparency in India\n\nIn 2009, India’s Parliament amended the Criminal Procedure Code to include a requirement that all police departments disclose information about arrests made. The law mandates that the information be published daily at the district level and include the names of arrested individuals and the names and designations of the police officers who arrested them. While this information raises concerns about privacy protections, it can be an important step for minimizing pretrial detention that does not comply with due process rights, especially in contexts where institutional protections against abuse of power and for access to justice may be weaker. Additionally, police headquarters must regularly collate this information at the state level, as well as information about the offenses for which arrested individuals were charged. All of this information is publicly available in the form of databases on the official websites of each state’s police department. For example, see Kerala State Police’s portal.[52] Separately, India’s National Crime Records Bureau has published the annual Crime in India Report since 1953, which contains crime data from across the country, including cases registered and persons arrested.[53]\n\nAustin, United States: Translate annual crime data file into accessible formats for the general public, such as written narratives and interactive maps (2019-2021).\n\nLiberia: Provide live police data on Liberia’s Open Data Portal that would include the location of police depots, actions against unprofessional police conduct, and crime maps (2015-2017).\n\nMexico: Create a standardized prisoner registration system to more effectively keep track of arrests, sentences, and time spent in detention (2013-2015).\n\nUnited Kingdom: Bring police records under legislative control through the Public Records Act of 1958 to ensure long-term preservation and access (2013-2015).\n\nGuidance and Standards\n\nThe UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) – Handbook on Police Accountability, Oversight, and Integrity\n\nThe handbook offers OGP countries several tangible actions to build a culture of transparency and accountability, as well as reliable statistics on police performance, integrity, and public confidence.[55] It encourages police reforms to be developed through public-police participation and not be simply prescriptive. Furthermore, the handbook gives guidance for external police oversight mechanisms:\n\nThe mechanism should be required to issue regular reports to the government and the public on its activities.\n\nIt should maintain a website with easily accessible information.\n\nIt should respond in a timely fashion to citizen complaints.\n\nIt should maintain detailed data on police abuses. Civilian oversight mechanisms are uniquely placed to conduct statistical or general reviews of patterns in police killings, including their causes, and should do so.\n\nIts budget and expenses should be publicly reported.[56]\n\nThe United States – Final Report of the President’s Task Force on 21st-Century Policing\n\nReleased in 2015, this report recommends that agencies should collect and make aggregate data publicly available.[57] Specific action items for police forces include the following:\n\nCollect, maintain, and report data to the federal government on all officer-involved shootings;\n\nDevelop policies on what types of information will be released, when, and in what situation, to maintain transparency;\n\nMake public the demographic data regarding the composition of their force;\n\nCollect, maintain, and analyze demographic data on all detentions (stops, frisks, searches, summons, and arrests); and\n\nDisaggregate data by school and nonschool contacts.\n\nOrganizations for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) – Guidebook on Democratic Policing\n\nThe 2007 guidebook serves as a reference for police practitioners and policy-makers working to strengthen democratic policing and covers topics such as “policing ethics, and human rights standards; the essential nature of police accountability to the law and to the society they serve; as well as the need for their co-operation with the communities.”[58] In particular, the guidebook discusses key aspects of data oversight and disposal (sections 49-51) and police oversight (sections 84-94), including through data generated by citizen complaints.\n\nOVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF POLICE\n\nOverview\n\nRecent civil unrest in the United States and around the world has exposed high levels of public distrust toward police. This distrust is particularly strong among marginalized communities, who often face discrimination and disproportionate use of force at the hands of police around the world.[59]\n\nThere are a variety of means by which civil society groups and communities can hold police accountable for their actions. These mechanisms include the following:\n\nIndependent and citizen oversight bodies give citizens a voice in how they are policed and in designing new ways to hold police accountable. They may operate at the local or higher levels. Oversight bodies may have a broad mandate, focus on controversial practices, or review police-citizen interactions and complaints.\n\nPartnerships are flexible tools that can be adapted to fit their unique context. The goal of public-police partnerships is to bring police and community organizations and individuals together in order to build trust and improve public safety. They may often be part of community-oriented policing. The partnership approach has several goals that are consonant with principles of open government — collaboration, participation, and engagement. It is the most popular type of OGP policing commitment.\n\nAdditional accountability mechanisms, such as complaints tools, ombudsman’s offices, and improving liability regimes can improve how individuals or groups seek corrective action for mistreatment by police, for example disproportionate use of force, illegal arrest, or prolonged detention.\n\nParticipatory budgeting is a process through which the public determines the priorities and functions of public offices. As public attention has shifted to the militarization of the police, budgeting processes have come to be seen as increasingly important in addressing crime, policing, and housing or mental health discrimination.\n\nAcross their various forms, oversight mechanisms need to be transparent in how members of the public can use them, who is a part of the decision-making, and the results of citizen input. They must have a clearly defined mandate to direct police strategies and practices. When granted such authority, oversight bodies provide a vital form of police accountability and can help ensure policing strategies reflect citizens’ needs and priorities.\n\nRecommendations and Sample Reforms\n\nBasic transparency\n\nOperating procedures: At a minimum, governments should make police operating procedures public, especially around practices such as use of force, search and seizure, and control of protests.\n\nSeveral non-governmental organizations in Eastern Europe are using Freedom of Information requests to gain access to police operating procedures.[60]\n\nIncident data: See the “Open Police Data” section for detailed data on incidents.\n\nIncident disposition data: In addition, internal investigations should make final determinations public and transparent. All presumptions should be toward disclosure, with narrow and rare cases for privacy protection. Policies that determine which data is cleared for publication should be publicly available and searchable.\n\nIndependent oversight bodies are local or higher-level bodies that give citizens a voice in how they are policed and in how police officers are held accountable.\n\nPractice and policy-level review\n\nCapacity buildingEnhancing the skills, abilities, and processes of public servants, civil society, and citizens is essential to achieving long-lasting results in opening government. Technical specifications: Set of ac...: Community panels may require advanced skills, such as data analysis and legal understanding, to best interpret appropriateness of policies. In other cases, training might be needed for facilitation, rule-setting, and documentation of decisions and notes. Community oversight bodies may have authority to review standard police operating procedures as well as practices that require additional scrutiny (e.g., use of force, search and seizure, and control of protests).\n\nMembership: Membership should be competitive, based on transparent criteria. Those criteria should aim for social representation, especially from groups who have historic or ongoing issues with policing and other traditionally underrepresented groups as well as those with the capacity to oversee police (such as lawyers or community organizations).\n\nExample: An example of a public commission to oversee a particular practice was the Stop and Search Scrutiny Panel in the West Midlands, UK. Commissions operate across each of the 10 local policing units of the region. These bodies meet independently and collectively.[61]\n\nComplaints and officer-citizen interaction\n\nMandate: Oversight bodies at the local level may oversee issues including excessive force, harassment, discrimination, theft, and failure to provide adequate or timely police protection.\n\nPublic complaints: Citizens can file a complaint to a citizen review board (or to internal investigative affairs) to review incidents. Barriers to do so should be low, including for individuals with few resources or low literacy. Tracking and disposition of complaints should be available to the individual.\n\nReview powers and authorities: Citizen oversight bodies may hold a mix of powers, including the ability to solicit, receive, consider, investigate, and publish determinations on public complaints. Such bodies need power to compel testimony and subpoena evidence to be fully effective. They should also be able to recommend various remedies, including mediation, arbitration, restoration, disciplinary action, or civil or criminal prosecution.\n\nMembership: Membership of such panels should be open and competitive, based on transparent criteria, which aims for social representation, especially from groups who have historic or ongoing issues with policing as well as those with the capacity to oversee police (such as lawyers or community organizations).\n\nOmbudsmen and citizen advocates. A special office can be created to advocate on behalf of the public. Representatives from this office may be members of an oversight body or may be independently or commission-appointed.\n\nExample: Newark, New Jersey’s (US) Civilian Complaint Review Board collects and investigates concerns from the public regarding the police department.[62] It also has the power to review disciplinary decisions and the department’s policies and practices.\n\nPublic-police partnerships and councils bring together police with community organizations and individuals in order to build trust and improve public safety. This may be one aspect of community policing.\n\nCommunication and interaction: One element of community policing is having the police be present within the community and operating from a decentralized location.\n\nEngagement and collaboration: Police should engage with local agencies, organizations, and institutions to ensure that policing reflects community safety goals. Engagement may focus on the safety of communities that have historically experienced discrimination at the hands of police, such as migrants, racial and ethnic minorities, members of the LGBTQI+ community, people with disabilitiesA government is not open unless it is accessible to all, and governments are working to ensure people with disabilities are afforded equitable services and opportunities to participate. Technical spec..., victims of sexual assault, youthRecognizing that investing in youth means investing in a better future, OGP participating governments are creating meaningful opportunities for youth to participate in government processes. Technical ... More, or people experiencing homelessness.\n\nExample: In South Africa, Community Policing Forums (CPFs), composed of community members, organizations, and government authorities, monitor the effectiveness of the police and promote local police accountability.[63]\n\nPolice accountability mechanisms – these can include complaints tools, ombudsman’s offices, and other liability regimes.\n\nStandards and justiciability: Clear standards for policing can be laid out as part of the legal regime governing police-citizen interaction. This may cover use of force, harassment, discrimination, theft, and failure to provide adequate or timely police protection. Clear rules and procedures on standing, materiality, forums, and the cost for bringing these complaints need to be detailed, publicly available, and easily discovered.\n\nCivil liability: Civil liability mechanisms establish processes for remedy and redress between plaintiffs and police agencies. Actions in this area would create and enhance standards and processes and allocate resources to ensure that there is accountability for agencies that cause harm.\n\nCriminal liability: Jurisdictions can establish processes to make individual officers criminally liable for serious violations of the law, especially in cases of violent crime. It is also important to establish command and control responsibility for managers and senior officers for illegal orders. Finally, governments may create special offices independent of prosecutors’ offices, as prosecutors can be conflicted by their regular reliance on the police.\n\nIndependent forums: OGP members can take steps to strengthen or establish independent forums to hear legal challenges to police operations. These will be more effective if they are independent of internal police review bodies, regular prosecutorial officers (who depend on police for investigations and prosecutions), and the executive branch. All decisions to decline or pursue charges against officers should be disclosed to the public, along with their reasoning.\n\nOpen and participatory budgeting is a process through which the public determines the priorities and functions of public offices.\n\nDetermining allocation of services: At the time of publication, there is increasing discussion on resource allocation in the United States, specifically moving resources to conflict resolution, mental health, social work, and homelessness services. Some of this is being done through open city council meetings, as has happened with the People’s Budget[64] in Nashville, (US).[65] In other cases, participatory budgeting mechanisms have been used to discuss shifting resources, as in Los Angeles, New York, and Boston.[66]\n\nIncluding affected communities: Participatory budgeting without intentional outreach might overlook those most affected. Positive examples include communities working on responding to crime in Merseyside, UK, and working with citizens reentering the community from incarceration in Canada.[67] These can empower people at the center of police-citizen interaction.\n\nAmple time for public voices: An important element of participatory budgeting is that grassroots community members can speak for the majority of budget conversations. Studies show that this significantly affects the quality and outcomes. A key part of this has been the development of people’s budgets, which are budget proposals by various grassroots organizations.\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nThere are a number of OGP commitments exclusively focused on partnerships and community-oriented policing. At this time, there are no commitments on oversight bodies (at any level), nor are there specific justice mechanisms to encourage public oversight of police actions. Examples of these mechanisms from outside of OGP are included in the previous section of this chapter (“Recommendations and Sample Reforms”).\n\nAfghanistan: Expand Public-Police Partnership Councils to all remaining provinces after initial success in 23 provinces (2017-2019).\n\nGeorgia: Establish local councils composed of representatives from law enforcement, municipalities, legal organizations, and nongovernmental organizations to coordinate crime prevention measures (2016-2018).\n\nPanama: Create advisory councils made up of the National Police, citizen security organizations, and representatives of civil society to create and strengthen new citizen security programs (2015-2017).\n\nUkraine: Train law enforcement officers in community policing practices, launch a complementary public awareness campaign, establish citizen advisory groups, create online resources for police-community coordination, and implement a “schools and police” project (2016-2018).\n\nJalisco, Mexico: Create spaces for dialogue and coordination between neighborhood councils and local police in the Lomas De Polanco neighborhood in Guadalajara, Mexico, to improve citizen trust in police (2017-2019).\n\nGuidance and Standards\n\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) – Handbook on Police Accountability, Oversight, and Integrity\n\nThis 2011 handbook covers a variety of internal and external mechanisms to strengthen police accountability, oversight, and integrity.[68] Specifically, the report offers recommendations regarding complaints against the police, independent oversight and complaint bodies, internal accountability, accountability to the state, and engaging the public. It is based on international standards and practices.\n\nUNODC and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) – Resource Book on the Use of Force and Firearms in Law Enforcement\n\nThe 2017 UNODC and OHCHR Resource Book on Use of Force and Firearms in Law Enforcement[69], which builds on international human rights law and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of

their often far-reaching authority and discretion, prosecutors’ decisions can shape a variety of trends in the criminal justice system. In addition to their role in determining which cases to prosecute, in some jurisdictions, prosecutors may also investigate crimes or supervise investigators, dictate bail and plea agreements, determine which cases are diverted to alternatives to prosecution, and influence sentencing decisions.[78] Often, this work occurs outside of the public eye to protect prosecutors’ independence and integrity. However, in at least some countries, this lack of transparency has contributed to problematic trends, such as mass incarceration,[79] disproportionate effects of prosecution on minority communities,[80] and executive capture of public prosecutors.[81]\n\nIn order to guard against these harms and in line with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s (UNODC) and the International Association of Prosecutors’ (IAP) The Status and Role of Prosecutors, prosecutors must be subject to rigorous standards of professional conduct and made accountable to the state and the public. To enable this accountability, data tied to prosecutors’ practices should be collected and made publicly available to guard against bias during points of prosecutorial decision-making. Civil society, the public, and other public officials should have opportunities to hold prosecutors accountable through clear, accessible complaints procedures that allow for a review of their conduct by an oversight authority with fair disciplinary proceedings.\n\nRecommendations and Sample Reforms\n\nGovernments can take the following steps to improve prosecutorial transparency and accountability.\n\nEnsure prosecutorial policies are written and available to the public – in particular, policies regarding training, internal oversight and discipline, and ethics compliance and policies involving the due process rights of the accused.\n\nConvene multistakeholder advisory groups. Convene civil society, experts, and members of the public to identify priority information for collection and disclosure by prosecutorial offices. Allow communities to have a say in the types of crime prosecutors prioritize.\n\nCollect and disclose case data. Prosecutors’ offices should collect and disclose data related to the demographics of defendants and prosecutors’ decisions to charge, seek pretrial detention and bail, allow for diversion or alternatives to incarceration, and offer plea bargains (where applicable) and the sentences they seek (including parole or probation).\n\nDisclose data on resource allocation. In accordance with international guidelines, require prosecutorial offices to regularly and comprehensively disclose their activities and expenditures to the legislature. In addition, make these reports publicly available.\n\nEnsure impartiality. Where relevant, prohibit elected prosecutors from accepting donations or endorsements from interested parties, including police unions.\n\nCreate an independent unit for monitoring and oversight. Establish an independent body with the power to examine cases for prosecutorial misconduct, wrongful conviction, unjust sentencing, or possible disparities in charging patterns based on particular areas or the demographics of the individuals being charged, such as race or ethnicity. Allow the body to review prosecutors’ decisions for adherence to internal guidelines.\n\nImplement a civilian oversight mechanism. The body should ensure direct accountability to the community, such as via a civilian advisory board within the office or an external civilian review board.\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania district attorney launches public data dashboard\n\nIn 2019, the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office (DAO) launched a new public dashboard for criminal justice data. The DAO Dashboard, which was created in consultation with prosecutors, data experts, and academics, is updated daily and presents data on key outcomes in the criminal justice system, including arrests, charges, bail, case outcomes, and case length. The Dashboard responds to the widespread lack of prosecutorial data that makes it hard to identify and address problematic trends in the system. In particular, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner expects that the newly available data will help his office curb mass incarceration in the district. Since the Dashboard is publicly available and user-friendly, it also enables civil society and members of the public to observe and monitor trends in the data for themselves. The DAO also encourages users to share their findings, feedback, and concerns with its office.\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nSlovak Republic improves transparency and accountability of prosecutors’ affairs\n\nSince 2014, the Slovak Republic has worked to address a lack of transparency in the Prosecutor General’s Office using its OGP action plans. In 2014, reports by the Group of States against Corruption and the Council of Europe raised concerns about the absence of publicly available information about prosecutors, including their names, and the inability of the public to request such information, even through Freedom of Information requests. In 2016, following its 2015 commitment, the Prosecutor General’s Office began publishing a regularly updated list of prosecutors.[82] Recognizing that this list is only a first step toward greater openness, in 2017, the Slovak Republic took steps to make prosecutors more accountable to citizens by conducting an analysis of selection and disciplinary procedures for prosecutors.[83] The analyses would ultimately inform draft legislation that would require these processes to be more transparent. While the Prosecutor General’s Office completed the analyses, they did not make the resulting reports publicly available. If they had done so, the reform could have increased transparency around prosecutors’ affairs and improved civil society organizations’ ability to monitor potential misconduct or corruption by prosecutors.\n\nOTHER OGP COMMITMENTS\n\nMexico: Create a criminal investigation website that electronically notifies crime victims of the status of their cases to make the process more transparent (2012-2014).\n\nMoldova: Facilitate greater access to information about electronic justice services, including through a system for recording interviews between individuals and their probation counselors to ensure transparency (2018-2020).\n\nGuidance and Standards\n\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the International Association of Prosecutors (IAP) – The Status and Role of Prosecutors\n\nIn 2014, the UNODC and IAP published a guide based principally on both of these guidelines and standards: The Status and Role of Prosecutors.[84] Building on earlier elements of international law that establish the role of prosecutors, the manual guides governments in writing prosecutorial rules based on these standards. The two key elements are independence and accountability. Requiring written instructions between the government and the prosecutor’s office can reveal influences and encourage transparency. Accountability can include filing reports, responding to inquiries, being a respondent in hearings, maintaining statistics, and cooperating with oversight committees. In turn, prosecutors must hold government officials accountable, including overseeing legal investigations and initiating proceedings against parties responsible for improper detentions.\n\nUNODC – Implementation Guide and Evaluative Framework for Article 11 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption\n\nIn 2015, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime published the Implementation Guide and Evaluative Framework for Article 11 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, which provides guidance to governments on how to strengthen integrity and prevent opportunities for corruption in the recruitment, training, and work of the prosecution services.[85] It also includes considerations for disciplinary measures for prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors – Resources and Partners\n\nResources\n\nUrban Institute’s analysis Collecting and Using Data for Prosecutorial Decisionmaking presents findings from their 2018 survey of state prosecutors’ offices in the United States.\n\nThe Vera Institute’s report, “Unlocking the Black Box of Prosecution,” discusses the ways a lack of transparency in prosecutorial offices can contribute to mass incarceration in the United States.\n\nThe UNODC and the International Association of Prosecutors’ guide on The Status and Role of Prosecutors outlines expectations for the independence and accountability of prosecutorial offices.\n\nOrganizations\n\nFair and Just Prosection\n\nGlobal Judicial Integrity Network (established by UNODC)\n\nInternational Association of Prosecutors\n\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)\n\nUrban Institute (United States)\n\nVera Institute of Justice (United States)\n\nLegal Aid\n\nOverview\n\nLegal aid is a critical component to ensuring access to justice. Indeed, it is a human right in criminal cases and a component of the fundamental right to a fair trial as recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Whether in criminal or civil matters, access to legal aid for individuals with limited means or who are in situations of vulnerability is critical to achieving fair and just outcomes. The provision of legal aid services reinforces the accountability of the justice system and safeguards the rights of individuals.\n\nThe provision and scope of legal aid services differs across countries. In some countries, legal aid is a public service provided by government-funded lawyers or private lawyers who are contracted with or appointed by a public authority to provide their services. In other instances, legal aid is provided by civil society organizations – sometimes funded by the government and sometimes by nongovernmental sources. Law school clinics, community paralegals, and community leaders might also provide services, as might private sector lawyers offering legal help pro bono. While all of these actors play important roles and can provide crucial services in their communities, this section will focus on legal aid providers in the context of the formal legal system.\n\nThe transparent and accountable administration of legal aid can help strengthen these services and ensure that they are accessible to all who need them. For example, transparency around the criteria that legal aid providers’ use to determine who is eligible for their services (also called a means test) allows individual beneficiaries, civil society groups, and the government to monitor and ensure equity in the provision of these services and see whether sufficient resources have been allocated to them.\n\nLikewise, as with other justice system stakeholders, legal aid providers should be independent and subject to rigorous standards of professional conduct. If they fail to meet such standards, disciplinary complaints should be promptly investigated and adjudicated in accordance with professional codes of ethics before an impartial body and subject to judicial review (see Principles 12 and 13 of the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, which also appear later in this chapter). Grievances or complaints related to a legal aid provider’s conduct and any disciplinary proceedings that might ensue should be handled in a fair and transparent process.\n\nRecommendations and Sample Reforms\n\nThe following list includes measures countries can take to improve access to and the quality of legal aid.\n\nEstablish or strengthen the legal aid authority.[86] Create an independent legal aid authority that can establish, fund, staff, regulate, and evaluate the legal aid scheme. Consider a multistakeholder approach, bringing in legal professionals, civil society, and representatives from underserved communities. The authority should establish a body that can impartially investigate complaints against legal aid providers and put in place a suitable mechanism for evaluating and improving the quality of services.\n\nEstablish training for legal aid providers.[87] Fund and launch training programs for legal aid lawyers, paralegals, and pro bono volunteers to improve their legal skills and knowledge to better understand the needs of low-income and underserved individuals. Providers should be trained on their professional obligations and relevant codes of conduct.\n\nEstablish minimum practice standards for legal aid providers.[88] Establish and publicly disclose minimum requirementsAll OGP participating countries are expected to adhere to the Participation and Co-Creation Standards. Each Standard includes clear and measurable minimum requirements that all OGP participating count... for training and practical experience that legal aid service providers must meet. Establish clear disciplinary procedures for violations of these codes. All procedures should be developed in consultation with legal aid providers and made public in advance of their use.\n\nEstablish a fair means test for services.[89] When a country uses a means test to determine eligibility for legal aid, the criteria should be widely publicized and consistently followed. Persons who are denied services should have the right to appeal the decision. According to the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, people in urgent circumstances, such as police stations and detention centers, or in courts should be provided legal help even when their eligibility is being determined. Importantly, children should always be exempt from a means test.\n\nExpand provision of quality legal aid. Expand access to quality civil and criminal legal aid to hold the state accountable to respect citizens’ rights by giving citizens’ access to legal help and information. This may include identifying communities or areas with disproportionate legal needs or that traditionally lack access to legal aid, expanding the provision of legal aid for problems that might not have adequate funding, and developing partnerships with civil society organizations offering legal assistance. Empower legal aid organizations to address the consequences of coming into conflict with the law, such as job loss and homelessness. Increase funding to existing legal aid services, and establish new offices and services to reach isolated or underserved communities.\n\nPublicly report on legal aid access.[90] Countries that track how many people go unrepresented each year at all levels, along with how many people qualify for legal aid and what percentage actually receive these services, will be able to better target legal aid expansion and show progress.\n\nConduct client satisfaction surveys. The satisfaction of beneficiaries should be a factor in assessing the overall quality of legal aid schemes.\n\nDeepen cooperation to address legal needs.[91] Launch working groups composed of government and civil society members to identify legal reforms needed to improve justice delivery systems through legal assistance and the courts. Strengthen and institutionalize partnerships, for example between the judicial system, legal aid providers, CSOs, academia, social services, the health-care system, and law enforcement, when appropriate, to better serve underserved communities.\n\nMake funding and budgets transparent. Budgets should be made publicly available down to the individual program level. Expand and diversify financing for legal assistance at national and subnational levels, including public sector partnerships.\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nIndonesia’s effort to increase the availability and quality of legal aid\n\nThe Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (“ILAF”) has been providing legal aid in Jakarta since the 1970s. Their services increased dramatically in the 1980s with assisting clients who were not only poor but also marginalized and oppressed.[92] The ILAF’s services include litigation, educationAccountability within the public education system is key to improving outcomes and attainment, and accountability is nearly impossible without transparent policies and opportunities for participation ... and empowerment of community members, research, and policy advocacy. In recent years, ILAF has received support from the Open Society Foundations to enhance its provision of legal aid. In 2018, Indonesia committed to creating regulations that guarantee funding for legal aid organizations, allowing them to expand their reach to more remote and impoverished communities while simultaneously strengthening the awareness and legal capacity of individuals who are poor and marginalized.\n\nLESSONS FROM REFORMERS\n\nUnited States’ efforts to develop national-level indicators on Sustainable Development Goal 16.3\n\nIn June 2016, the United States committed to developing national-level indicators on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16.3 (the call to ensure equal access to justice) through a working group connected to the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable (which was a separate OGP access to justice commitment[93]) to discuss data collection on access to justice and legal aid, including its impact on federal programs that advance efforts to promote access to health and housing, education and employment, family stability, and public safety. The working group was tasked with assisting the US government in identifying and developing national-level indicators to track achieving Goal 16, the SDG to promote the rule of law and ensure equal access to justice for all. The activities of the working group are summarized in this factsheet.[94]\n\nOTHER OGP COMMITMENTS\n\nBurkina Faso: Increase the availability of legal aid for vulnerable community members (2017-2019).\n\nColombia: Launch a web portal and mobile application called LegalApp to facilitate public access to information on justice services (2015-2017).\n\nNorth Macedonia: Establish four access-to-justice centers to provide free legal aid to marginalized communities (2018-2020).\n\nSierra Leone: Expand community-based justice services and increase transparency in local-level structures (2019-2021).\n\nSouth Africa: Integrate and strengthen Community Advice Offices as a grassroots and permanent part of the wider justice system (2016-2018).\n\nGuidance and Standards\n\nUnited Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems\n\nThe UN Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems,[95] adopted in December 2012 by the United Nations General Assembly, is a nonbinding legal document that can guide countries on how to build, fund, and structure legal aid systems, primarily in the criminal justice context. The UN Principles and Guidelines is the first tool dedicated exclusively to legal aid and based on international human rights law, as well as good practices in strengthening access to legal aid in criminal justice from all over the world. While they recognize that “states employ different models for the provision of legal aid,” they can be effective tools in strengthening and growing fairness and access to services in existing criminal legal aid systems throughout the world. Since their adoption, the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice has continued to encourage governments to strengthen the provision of legal aid through peer-to-peer exchange and collaboration.\n\nThe 14 principles include the following:\n\nPrinciple 12. – Independence and protection of legal aid providers: States should ensure that legal aid providers are able to carry out their work effectively, freely and independently. In particular, States should ensure that legal aid providers are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference; are able to travel, to consult and meet with their clients freely and in full confidentiality both within their own country and abroad, and to freely access prosecution and other relevant files; and do not suffer, and are not threatened with, prosecution or administrative, economic or other sanctions for any action taken in accordance with recognized professional duties, standards and ethics.\n\nPrinciple 13. – Competence and accountability of legal aid providers: States should put in place mechanisms to ensure that all legal aid providers possess education, training, skills and experience that are commensurate with the nature of their work, including the gravity of the offences dealt with, and the rights and needs of women, children and groups with special needs. Disciplinary complaints against legal aid providers should be promptly investigated and adjudicated in accordance with professional codes of ethics before an impartial body and subject to judicial review.\n\nThe 18 guidelines provide more practical guidance and detail on the principles, such as how to determine eligibility for legal aid and how countries can establish, fund, staff, and regulate legal aid schemes, including the following:\n\nGuideline 1.
