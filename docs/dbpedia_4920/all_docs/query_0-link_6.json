This criticism and discontent were rather eloquently demonstrated during the recent European Parliament elections, when EU citizens proved to be quite vocal in their demand for a better Europe.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras reviewed the Greek Presidency at the European Parliament plenary session, today (2.07.2014) in Strasbourg. Prime Minister Samaras also held a press conference with EP President, Martin Schulz.\n\nRead below PM Samarasâ Opening and closing statements at EP.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the Greek Presidency of the Council of the EU, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos held at Zappeion Megaron, on Monday, 30 June 2014, a press conference, during which he reviewed the main achievements of the Greek Presidency.\n\nRead below DMP & FM Venizelos' opening statements\n\nThe European Council convenes today for a two-day summit.
