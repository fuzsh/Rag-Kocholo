        "text": "One could quite happily commentate on interesting legal issues and never engage with a case which has been on the front pages.\n\nAnd one could follow ‘true crime’ stories and never come across an interesting legal issue.\n\nThere is usually not much of an overlap: ‘true crime’ and earnest, plodding legal commentary normally do not have that much in common.\n\n*\n\nThe Lucy Letby case has been prominent in the news now for some time.\n\nShe has been convicted of multiple murders and attempted murders.\n\nBut is there anything in her case which is of wider interest – or of concern – in respect of the legal system?\n\nIs there an issue here about the process of criminal justice?\n\n*\n\nSome people maintain she must be innocent; and some people insist she must be guilty; and there are many websites and social media posts setting out both of these positions.\n\nThis blogpost is not one of them.\n\nI do not know if she is guilty or innocent. That is a matter for a jury – or an appeal court.\n\nShe may be a serial killer, or she may be a victim of a miscarriage of justice; that is for others to decide.\n\nBut there is, I think, an issue here of potential wider concern.\n\nThis may be a rare example of a front page ‘true crime’ story which also raises an important issue about the legal system.\n\nAnd that issue is about the role of prosecution expert evidence in an adversarial criminal trial when the defence elects not to put in their own expert evidence (for good reason or bad).\n\n*\n\nLucy Letby was convicted, in part, on the basis of expert evidence.\n\nThe case against her was not entirely based on expert evidence; there was other evidence put before the jury.\n\nBut, on any view, it was an expert evidence heavy prosecution.\n\nAnd that is not unusual – or wrong: there are many criminal prosecutions which depend on expert evidence.\n\n*\n\nIn our adversarial system, what often happens in a jury trial when there is reliance by the prosecution on expert evidence is that there is also expert evidence put forward by the defence.\n\nIn principle, the expert owes their duty to the court – and not to the party who has instructed him or her.\n\nIn practice, of course, the prosecution will put forward expert evidence that supports their case, and the defence puts forward expert evidence which supports their case; the experts are then examined and cross-examined by lawyers; the judge sums up; and the jury then weighs the evidence of the experts in its deliberations.\n\nThis system is not perfect, and indeed no litigation process is perfect; but it generally works.\n\n*\n\nBut what happens when the defence, for some reason, does not put in their own expert evidence?\n\nThe prosecution expert evidence will still be examined and cross-examined by lawyers – and the judge will still sum up, and the jury will still deliberate.\n\nBut the questions of the lawyers – especially the cross-examination – are not themselves evidence.\n\nThe only expert evidence is that put in by the prosecution.\n\nThe jury do not get to compare and contrast the expert evidence of the prosecution and the defence; the judge gets only to sum up the expert evidence of the prosecution.\n\n*\n\nIn the first Lucy Letby trial, for some reason, there was no expert evidence put in by the defence.\n\nWe do not know that reason.\n\nWhat we do know is that the defence team continued to act for her on appeal and so it would seem that their client is not dissatisfied with the conduct of the defence. This would indicate that there was, at least for their client, a good reason for not putting in expert evidence, else – presumably – she would have instructed new counsel for the appeal.\n\nIf so, could there be a good reason?\n\nYes, indeed there could be more than one good reason – though this is supposition, for we do not know the reason.\n\n*\n\nOne possible good reason for there not being expert evidence put in by the defence has been identified by the experienced criminal barrister Adam King in a strong piece setting out why there may be a miscarriage of justice in this case:\n\n“One reason the defence might have chosen not to call Dr Hall (and I am speculating here) is if they felt they had so thoroughly undermined Dr Evans that they were better off leaving it at that. That would be a big tactical call, but covering your own back is not always consistent with protecting your client’s interests.\n\n“So, for example: if your own expert would contradict much, but not all, of the Crown’s expert’s conclusions, and you believe the credibility of the Crown’s expert has been totally destroyed, you might judge it prudent not to put your own expert in the witness box. Avoiding the potential for future criticism and hindsight regret by putting your client in what you believe will be a worse position — by calling your own expert — is not a boss move. This is all speculation, but I guarantee that careful thought went into the decision not to call Dr Hall. None of this, though, would mean the conviction is safe.”\n\n*\n\nAnother possible reason not to call expert evidence is that your client’s case is that the relevant area of knowledge is such that no actual expertise is possible. This may be because of the lack of reliable data, or because it is a novel or developing area.\n\nIf so, calling an expert on that point would contradict that position.\n\nWe do know that Letby’s defence lawyers put in a detailed submission at the end of the prosecution case in the first trial that the prosecution had shown no case to answer and that prosecution expert evidence should be ruled inadmissible. It may have been that calling expert evidence would have undermined the prospects of what may have been a successful application.\n\nWe don’t know.\n\n*\n\nIn essence, the decision not to call expert evidence may have been a perfectly legitimate one for Letby and her lawyers to make in the circumstances of her case.\n\nAnd one should remember – and this is a crucial point – it is for the prosecution to make out their case.\n\nIt is for the Crown to prove their case to the criminal standard of proof, and not for the defence to disprove it.\n\n*\n\nBut.\n\nWhile it may have been in the interests of Letby and her lawyers not to put in expert evidence, this has the knock-on effect of there being no expert evidence from the defence for the jury to consider.\n\nThat prosecution expert evidence may be subject to robust cross-examination – but the questions of the barrister are not evidence, and the jury have to decide the case on the basis of the evidence.\n\n*\n\nAt this point, many legal folk and others would say that the fault here is with Letby and her lawyers. The defence had the opportunity to put in their own expert evidence, and they did not do so. And that the convictions were the consequence.\n\nBut it may be that response avoids a key issue.\n\nIt is for the prosecution to prove their case, and not for the defence to disprove it.\n\nIt is thereby for the prosecution to ensure that the expert evidence on which it seeks to rely is as sound as possible.\n\nThe prosecution cannot shrug off this responsibility and say that it can be cured by the defence expert witnesses.\n\nAnd there is concern that the prosecution expert evidence in the Letby case was not sound to begin with.\n\n*\n\nIf that concern about the prosecution expert evidence is well-based – and this is a legal blog and not a medical or science blog, and so like many of you I have no idea – then the question is what, if anything, can and should the legal system do about it – especially when the defence (for good reason or bad) do not put their own expert evidence in.\n\nHere there are rules on what experts can and cannot do and say, and on what their duties are to the court; here there are also rules on the admissibility of expert evidence; and there will also be cross-examination of the expert by defence lawyers.\n\nThere are safeguards.\n\nBut.\n\nThe key safeguard against poor prosecution expert evidence in our adversarial system is that the defence can put in their own expert evidence for the jury to weigh against it.\n\nBut when the defence do not do that (for good reason or bad) then there is perhaps a system failure of the adversarial system.\n\n*\n\nHere one can (again) say that is the fault of Letby and her lawyers.\n\nBut even taking that (fair) point at its highest, there is a potential wider problem.\n\nA lot depends on the soundness of the Letby conviction.\n\nIndeed there is an important public inquiry which is predicated on the basis of the convictions being sound:\n\nIf, as some insist, the prosecution expert evidence in the Letby case was unsound, then any inquiry based on that expert evidence being sound will have challenges.\n\n“MD” in the current edition of Private Eye sets out the implications:\n\n“…[the] Thirwall public inquiry may inadvertently be derailed by experts who say under oath that Letby wasn’t stopped sooner because there were far more plausible reasons for the deaths than murder.”\n\n*\n\nThe cases involving Roy Meadow show that we should always be alert to the problems of expert evidence.\n\nIf – and it is an if – the prosecution expert evidence in the Letby case was unsound, then there is a hard question of what else the criminal justice system could/should have done when a defence does not put their own expert evidence.\n\nGiven her decision not to put in expert evidence, is it the case that she had the fairest trial possible in the circumstances?\n\nOr is there something else the criminal justice system could/should have done in this case – and similar cases?\n\nIt may be that there is a lacuna here – and not one which is easy, or even possible, to address in our adversarial system.\n\nIn essence: what can a criminal court do in respect of unsound expert evidence when the defence elects (for good reason or bad) not to put in their own expert evidence?\n\n**\n\nComments Policy\n\nThis blog enjoys a high standard of comments, many of which are better and more interesting than the posts.\n\nComments are welcome, but they are pre-moderated and comments will not be published if irksome, or if they risk derailing the discussion.\n\nMore on the comments policy is here.\n\nWhat would be the legal position if a parliamentary candidate did not exist?\n\nA non-existent candidate, yesterday.\n\nThis question is posed because of concerns currently expressed as to whether Reform Party candidates actually existed or not.\n\nIn this internet age, there will be suspicions that a person does not actually exist if they have no social media or other online presence. This sad fact probably tells us more about this internet age than it does about any (wise) person who has kept themselves offline.\n\nA dishonestly presented fictional candidate would be such an extraordinary event at a general election that there must be a better explanation than it having happened. On this basis, this post makes no allegations of wrongdoing in any way. Instead, this post is for the public understanding of law.\n\n*\n\nHowever, such fictional candidates are not without precedent.\n\nOne tweeter unearthed this example from 2017:\n\nThe BBC news report indicates that the defendant was convicted not of any offence under election law, but under the general fraud offence of using a false instrument with intent:\n\nAnother tweeter, however, has pointed out that there is a corresponding offence under section 65A(1)(a) of the Representation of the People Act 1983:\n\nThis provides that it is a corrupt practice if a person causes or permits to be included in a document delivered or otherwise furnished to a returning officer a statement of the name or home address of a candidate at the election which he knows to be false in any particular.\n\nA person providing a name and address of somebody who does not exist would presumably be caught by this offence.\n\n*\n\nThe one “person” who cannot be prosecuted, of course, is the fictional candidate.\n\nThis is because they do not exist.\n\nThis is not just an amusing point, for much of the Representation of the People Act (understandably) presupposes the candidate does actually exist as a person. For example, here is the power for an election to be voided for general corruption:\n\nWould this section (and other similar sections) still apply if there was not actually “any person” for the purpose of that clause?\n\nThe determination of that question would be an interesting judgment to read.\n\nWould the lack of a person as a candidate be the basis for any election to be voided? If so, how? And, in what circumstances?\n\nThe wording of various provisions of the 1983 Act may have to have (non-existent) words implied in to them (“purposeful interpretation” as it is called) so as to deal with such a (non-existent) candidate.\n\n*\n\nAnother interesting point is that it seems that proof of identity for a candidate may be now practically at a lower threshold than for an elector.\n\nHere is the Electoral Commission guidance for returning officers (hat-tip):\n\nThat footnote “2” in turn refers to a couple of cases.\n\nOf the first case from 1977, Westlaw tells us that it is authority that where there is nothing on the face of the nomination paper to raise a doubt as to the identity of the nominee, a returning officer is not entitled to investigate the authenticity of the name appearing thereon before deciding whether to accept or reject it.\n\n(The second case, from 1975, turns more on the wording of the sub-rules of a local government statute.)\n\nIf this 1977 case is authority for the general position stated by the commission then it does seem a remarkable discrepancy that a voter has to prove their identity whilst a candidate does not.\n\n*\n\nThe above post is based on research overnight, and on the help of other tweeters (which I gratefully acknowledge), as this simply is not part of my general constitutional law knowledge. It is not a question I have ever considered before.\n\nAs such, it would be wonderful if you would supplement (or correct) the above, if you have expertise in this area.\n\nAnd, if you can, you do not need to prove your identity.\n\n***\n\nComments Policy\n\nThis blog enjoys a high standard of comments, many of which are better and more interesting than the posts.\n\nComments are welcome, but they are pre-moderated and comments will not be published if irksome, or if they risk derailing the discussion.\n\nMore on the comments policy is here.\n\nThe appointment of James Timpson as prisons minister is welcome – indeed it is the most welcome appointment to this position that any sensible person can imagine.\n\nBut there are a couple of serious obstacles that he will need to overcome.\n\n*\n\nBefore those two obstacles are described, however, let us remind ourselves of the Tale of Two Timpsons, for it perhaps tells us something significant about what is now our governing party.\n\nWhen Edward Timpson – the younger brother of James – was selected as a candidate by the Connservative Party in 2008, this was the infantile response of the Labour Party:\n\nEdward Timpson himself referred to this dreadful, crass campaign in an interview in May this year when he announced he was standing down from parliament:\n\n*\n\nSo one thing the appointment this week maybe signifies is that the now governing party is rather more politically mature.\n\n*\n\nAnd the appointment also signifies a more mature approach to prisons policy.\n\n(We can only hope that one day there is a similarly mature appointment in respect of drugs policy.)\n\nJames Timpson has an outstanding record in respect of rehabilitation of offenders, both at his Timpson business and otherwise.\n\nHe is, for example, chair of the Prison Reform Trust:\n\nA post he wrote on appointment is worth reading here.\n\n*\n\n“We’re addicted to sentencing, we’re addicted to punishment,” he has said more recently.\n\n“So many of the people in prison in my view shouldn’t be there. A lot should but a lot shouldn’t, and they’re there for far too long.”\n\nThis is therefore a sensible and enlightened appointment which deserves hearty applause.\n\n*\n\nBut.\n\nTimpson has (at least) two obstacles in his new position – and it cannot be certain that he can overcome them.\n\n*\n\nThe first obstacle is that the track record of business people appointed as ministers indicates that they tend not to be successful as politicians.\n\nThere was John Davies under then Prime Minister Edward Heath, and he was not a conspicuous success.\n\nThere was David Young under then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who, despite been adept at telling her what she wanted to hear (“Other people bring me problems; David brings me solutions,” she is quoted as saying), was otherwise not a conspicuous success.\n\nThere was Archie Norman under then Leader of the Opposition William Hague, and he was not a conspicuous success (“I was the first FTSE-100 chairman to sit in the House of Commons and I will almost certainly be the last,” he said afterwards).\n\nAnd there was Digby Jones under then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who was also not a conspicuous success.\n\nOne reason for none of these business people being successful as politicians is that being good at business does not automatically mean that one will be good at politics.\n\nBeing good at politics requires specific skills – and there is no particular reason why a business person will have those skills.\n\nThat said, James Timpson is more than just a good businessman, he is a committed and knowledgable prison reformer – and this may make the difference where other business people have failed as front bench politicians.\n\nBut the reason this really matters in this instance is because of the second obstacle.\n\n*\n\nThe second obstacle to James Timpson being successful as prisons minister is the structurally and politically weak position of being a mere minister of state in the Ministry of Justice – both against the Treasury and in respect of the news media.\n\n*\n\nSince 2005 prisons have been under the Ministry of Justice, having been moved over from the Home Office.\n\nTo an extent this was a good thing, for the less power the Home Office has over anything, the better.\n\nBut it was also a bad thing, for the it turned the Ministry of Justice from what was the old Lord Chancellor’s Department into a “spending” department.\n\nAnd not only a spending department, but a small spending department – the worst of both possible worlds.\n\nPart of the problem the Ministry of Justice has had since 2005 – under all administrations – is its weak position vis-a-vis the Treasury.\n\nAt least the Home Office had some departmental heft and a senior cabinet presence in its battles for public money; the Ministry of Justice almost has none.\n\nAnd Timpson will not even be head of this department – the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice is Shabana Mahmood (another welcome appointment).\n\nMahmood in turn will be fighting for money for the courts system and legal aid, as well as for probation and prisons. This puts Timpson further back in the queue for public money – to the extent any changes he wants to bring about requires investment.\n\n*\n\nAnd it will not only be the Treasury that will be need to be won over.\n\nThe right-of-centre news media is still wedded to the notion that prison works. They are, to use a phrase, “addicted to sentencing…addicted to punishment”.\n\nIt will take only one unfortunate incident of something done by an early released prisoner, and there will be a news-media fire storm.\n\nSuch a prospect would be daunting for even a seasoned politician saying prison works.\n\nThose with long memories will recall how prisons failures engulfed David Waddington, one of the biggest hangers-and-floggers ever to be Home Secretary:\n\nWhen prisons and probation things go wrong they are easy copy for time-poor news media. The screaming headlines will write themselves.\n\nIt is one thing to have warm applause and general goodwill on appointment, it is another thing when there is a horrific story on the front pages.\n\nBeing a prisons minister who believes in prisons working is hard enough.\n\nBeing a prisons minister who wants to achieve fundamental yet enlightened change is far harder.\n\n*\n\nSo the task now before James Timpson is immense: to quickly become an effective Whitehall and Westminster politician so as to bring about a change in policy direction, in the faces of both a parsimonious Treasury and potential outright news-media hostility.\n\nHe has to bring about fundamental change to Whitehall’s long-settled prisons policy – one of the most difficult ‘asks’ in politics.\n\nYes, it is a brilliant, heartening appointment.\n\nAnd if anyone can do it, James Timpson can. But it will not be easy.\n\nOne can only wish him good fortune.\n\n***\n\nComments Policy\n\nThis blog enjoys a high standard of comments, many of which are better and more interesting than the posts.\n\nComments are welcome, but they are pre-moderated and comments will not be published if irksome, or if they risk derailing the discussion.\n\nMore on the comments policy is here."
