The effort now is for other good news to follow, and the prime minister is in charge of that,\" he said.\n\nDeputy Development and Competitiveness Minister Notis Mitarakis, on his part, noted that Greece's image abroad is changing and the country was once more \"on the map for big invest-ments\".\n\n[02] Samaras chairs meeting on real estate taxation\n\nPrime Minister Antonis Samaras is currently chairing a meeting with Government Vice president and Foreign minister Evangelos Venizelos, Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras and Alternate Finance Minister Christos Staikouras at the Maximos Mansion.\n\nAccording to information the main issue on the agenda is the real estate uniform tax, whose final draft has to be finalised before the troika's next visit to Athens.\n\n[03] New property tax to be more fair, proportional, FinMin says\n\nA new property tax, to be introduced from 2014, will be more fair and proportional, Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, after a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras to discuss a plan to replacing two existing property taxes, Stournaras said the government wanted to collect less from most people. The meeting agreed to a milder tax burden on agricultural land, while the target for revenues from this new tax was set at 2.85 billion euros. The government's economic team plans to bring the new legislation into public consultation next week ahead of the troika's expected arrival in Athens in October 18. The Greek finance minister is expected to have a teleconference with representatives of the troika over the future of Greece's defense industries.\n\nHe added that taxes on farming land and land in agricultural areas will be very low.\n\nStournaras rejected the possibility of new across-the-board measures being introduced. Commenting on a recent IMF report claiming that Greece will need more loans, he referred to the report's page 14, which said that in developed countries the criterion used must be either the cyclical deficit or surplus.\"\n\n\"Greece has a 4.5 percent primary surplus for 2013 and possibly over 6 percent in 2014,\" Stournaras noted. \"It's self-evident there will be no across-the-board measures,\" adding that the measures that will be implemented will be infrastructural in nature.\n\n[04] SYRIZA leader again calls on PM to respond to press report in Parliament; gov't spokesman responds\n\nMain opposition Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras on Thursday called again on Prime Minister Antonis Samaras to appear in parliament and provide explanations in response to an article by Avghi newspaper on Thursday according to which high-level government entities are planning a provocation against the party.\n\nTsipras also noted that Syriza does not carry out policy based on press reports but it tables questions in parliament and requests answers from the government.\n\nHe also added that the ministers and prime minister himself do not appear in parliament and called Mr. Samaras to give answers and reminded that SYRIZA has asked for an off the agenda discussion on leaders' level, without having received an answer.\n\nGovernment spokesman Simos Kedikoglou denied the Avghi report and said that \"even the most unbelievable ridiculousness, the most extreme fancifulness, has limits\" and questioned the report's ulterior motives.\n\nCriticising Tsipras for \"his communications games\" that have \"gone overboard,\" Kedikoglou said. \"We've lived to see this too - first they supply their newspaper with imaginary plots, and then have Tsipras deny them,\" he added.\n\n[05] Tsipras says tax in heating oil 'silly and irrational'\n\nSYRIZA leader Alexis Tsipras called the government's persistence in maintaining the special consumers tax in heating oil \"silly, irrational and criminal\" and asked the government to abolish it immediately.\n\nAfter his meeting with the Gas Owners Federation on Thursday, the main opposition leader noted that last year, due to the tax, the heating oil consumption fell by 70 percent, resulting in a 240-million-euro loss in state revenues. This situation, he said, placed a large number of the population into energy-related poverty.\n\nTsipras rejected the government's stance that the measure aims to tackle the oil smuggling, noting that it only created a huge vacancy filled by black marketeering with shipping oil.\n\n[06] Parliament to vote on lifting immunity of six GD MPs next Wednesday\n\nThe Special Permanent Committee on Parliamentary Ethics decided on Thursday to recommend that Parliament lift immunity from prosecution for six Golden Dawn (Chryssi Avgi) MPs facing charges of forming a criminal organisation and other offences. According to a decision announced by the Parliamentary presidium earlier the same day, a discussion and roll-call vote using a ballot box on lifting immunity for all six MPs will be held next Wednesday.\n\nFor three of the deputies in question - Georgios Germenis, Panagiotis Iliopoulos and Stathis Boukouras - prosecuting authorities have asked that their immunity be lifted so that they can be tried for criminal activities conducted within the framework of a criminal organisation and criminal action that acts as an insult to the polity through preparatory actions that tend to harm democratic institutions.\n\nThe requests to lift immunity for GD MP Ilias Kasidiaris relate to incidents that occurred in Iraklio, Crete, while the MP Ilias Panagiotaros is to be charged with disturbing public order and GD MP Chrysovalantis Alexopoulos for operating a pirate amateur radio station.\n\nGermenis and Alexopoulos both appeared before the Parliamentary Ethics Committee during Thursday's discussion, with Germenis claiming that he was being persecuted for his ideology and talked of a \"witch hunt\" targeting those supporting Golden Dawn. Alexopoulos presented documents to show that the amateur radio station had a legal licence.\n\nMeanwhile, new requests asking Parliament to also lift the immunity of GD MP Eleni Zaroulia, the wife of the party's leader Nikos Michaloliakos who is being held on remand, and a second request for Boukouras on additional charges were sent to the justice ministry from the Supreme Court prosecutor on Thursday. The ministry is expected to forward the new requests to Parliament later in the day.\n\nThe case against Zaroulia concerns the bullet found in a travel bag she was carrying when she visited her husband in a police jail after his arrest by the counter-terrorism squad. If her immunity is lifted, she will face charges for illegal possession of ammunition and bringing ammunition into a jail.\n\nThe new charges against Boukouras are for abuse, intimidation and malicious blasphemy and relate to an attack by GD supporters on Corinth Mayor Alexandros Pnevmatikos in Examilia, Corinth in 2012, which was led by the GD MP.\n\n[07] Dev't Minister meets with head of Task Force Reichenbach\n\nThe head of the Task Force for Greece, Horst Reichenbach, declined to comment on an International Monetary Fund (IMF) report which points out the need for new austerity measures, at a press question on Thursday after his meeting with Development Minister Costis Hatzidakis.\n\nIt is reminded that IMF said in its report that additional measures up to 3.5 percent of the GDP will be necessary for Greece until 2016.\n\nThe two officials' meeting focused on the restoration of liquidity in the market, supports of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the planning of the new National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF). Hatzidakis said the government is ready to present its positions to the EU.\n\nOn his part, Reichenbach noted that it is essential that new ways to support the SMES be included in the new NSRF, in cooperation with banks.\n\nHe said that the Task Force has submitted specific proposals, which he did not reveal, to the Greek government on VAT collection. Reichenbach, however, admitted that taxation in Greece is very high compared to other EU country-members.\n\nHatzidakis noted that the key word from now on is \"the total restoration of credibility. The government must continue its work, the opposition parties should show the essential responsibility and troika must trust the Greek government.\"\n\n[08] PM Samaras' condolences over death of EPP's president, Wilfried Martens\n\nGreece lost a true friend and Europe a leader who combined realism with vision, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said on Thursday, after learning of the death of co-founder and president of the European People's Party (EPP), Wilfried Martens.\n\nThe EPP family mourns the loss of its president and Belgium's former prime minister, Samaras said, adding that \"we Greeks will be grateful for his philhellenism and support and will honour his memory.\"\n\nSamaras sent his condolences to the family of Martens, who was 77.\n\nMartens had been prime minister of Belgium from 1979 to 1992 and president of the EPP since 1990. He had co-founded the group in 1976.\n\nOn Tuesday, October 8, he informed the EPP presidency that he was unable to fulfill his duties due to health reasons and delegated his responsibilities to the EPP Group chairman in the European Parliament, Joseph Daul.\n\nThe centre-right EPP currently includes 74 member-parties from 40 countries, the presidents of the European Commission and the European Council, 13 EU and 5 non-EU heads of state and government and 13 members of the European Commission. It is the largest Group in the European Parliament.\n\n[09] Parliament President Meimarakis offers condolences for the death of Wilfried Martens\n\n\"The news of the loss of Wilfried Martens, a friend and ally of Greece, filled me with grief,\" Parliament President Evangelos Meimarakis said on Thursday.\n\n\"He was a great leader, who played a serious and decisive role in the efforts to overcome the economic crisis, both as the president of the European People's Party (EPP) and as the prime minister of Belgium,\" Meimarakis underlined offering his condolences to the family of the deceased.\n\nMartens, 77, had been prime minister of Belgium from 1979 to 1992 and president of the EPP since 1990. He had co-founded the group in 1976.\n\n[10] Foreign minister addresses event on overcoming crisis in the EU\n\nThe Greek government considers that the Greek EU presidency in the first half of 2014 will coincide with the start of the country's exit from the economic crisis after six years of deep recession, government Vice-President and Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos said on Thursday at a conference entitled \"To overcome the crisis, the EU must move ahead\".\n\n\"Greece is a laboratory in which the resilience of the euro and the European endeavour was tested and where the resilience of democratic institutions is also being tested,\" Venizelos said, pointing out that the first encouraging signs, such as the achievement of a structural surplus, were starting to appear.\n\nAccording to the minister, the crisis had highlighted a number of major structural problems on a European level, including 'political deficits' and certain 'provocative inequalities' that were now being propagated by disparities in the cost of money and the cost of energy.\n\nVenizelos also noted that, without overlooking the colossal loan and debt haircut given to Greece, European solidarity had come with some very harsh conditions attached and the initial 'rescue' plan had resulted in the current high levels of unemployment, persistent recession and a high social cost.\n\nThe minister called for an \"honest discussion\" with Greece's European partners on a political level and stressed that the country - while it must not relax efforts for structural reform - could not survive additional austerity measures. According to Venizelos, Greece's EU presidency could be an opportunity to outline a \"new narrative\" for Europe, with a return to the basics and a \"repoliticisation\" of the discussion about the future that focused on tolerance and \"raises our resistance to racist views\".\n\n\"As we cannot allow a murderer to hide behind the eurosceptic, so we cannot allow violence to hide behind the crisis,\" he added.\n\nHe also called for a major discussion on the economic challenges facing Europe and ways to make the European economy competitive.\n\nReferring to the boat disaster in Lampedusa, he said the Greek presidency was working with the Italian presidency in the second half of 2014 to make this a 'Mediterranean year' and to promote a comprehensive maritime policy, with the assistance of Greece's European Commissioner Maria Damanaki.\n\nThe two-day conference was organised jointly by the Greek Centre of European Studies & Research (EKEME) and the Trans European Policy Studies Association (TEPSA), ahead of the upcoming Greek presidency of the EU.\n\n[11] Government spokesman Kedikoglou on the temporary digital signal settlement with private TV channels\n\nGovernment spokesman Simos Kedikoglou on Thursday underlined that the government is in line with the guidelines of the National Committee of Telecommunications and Post Offices (EETT), an independent watchdog, and temporarily meets the needs of remote Greek regions, making sure that \"they will not be left without a television signal\" until the soon-to-be-launched broadcasting licensing procedure for television channels is completed.\n\nKedikoglou referred to the temporary settlement allowing private television channels to switch from analog platforms to digital-only platforms, noting that the government is attempting to counterbalance the operation of the mass media in the context of the transition to a digital signal platform, and shape a proper institutional environment.\n\n\"However, certain parties choose to engage in misinformation by misrepresenting reality,\" Kedikoglou said.\n\nHe also said that the state will have millions of euros in revenues that will come from the digital TV signal provider, the television channels and the deregulation of the digital dividend, namely, the spectrum released in the process of digital television transition.\n\n[12] Venizelos meets with NATO SG Rasmussen\n\n\"Greece is an old, reliable and active member of NATO and will always play this role,\" government vice president and Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos said in statements made on Thursday evening after the end of a meeting with visiting NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen.\n\nDiscussion during the meeting focused on the prevailing situation in the wider region, with an emphasis on the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nCooperation between the European Union and NATO was also on the table, in view of Greece's EU presidency in the first half of 2014, while Venizelos briefed the NATO chief on Greece's political, economic and social conditions, as well as on the repercussions of the current economic crisis and the latest developments with regard to the judicial process against the ultra-right Golden Dawn (Chryssi Avghi) party.\n\nRasmussen spoke of a very constructive discussion, stressing that Greece continues to support NATO in spite of the economic difiiculty.\n\nHe underlined that increasing threats should be dealt with only in cooperation, and made special reference to cooperation between both NATO and non-NATO member countries and international organisations.\n\nGreece plays an important role in all the sectors, Rasmussen said, adding that it contributes to what he called \"smart defence,\" with an especially constructive role in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n[13] Defence Minister to meet with NATO chief on Friday\n\nDefence Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos will have a working breakfast on Friday at 9:30 am with NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen at the Defence Ministry in Athens.\n\nThe two officials will make statements to the press after the meeting.\n\nParty funding suspension amendment to be appended to energy bill\n\nA draft amendment suspending state funding to parties under criminal prosecution will be appended as a rider to a Ministry of the Environment bill on renewable energy sources expected to be discussed and voted on at the Parliament's plenary session next week, Justice Ministry Charalambos Athanassiou announced Thursday.\n\nThe minister explained that the government wanted the amendment to be voted on quickly, thus it didn't include it in the draft bill on electronic surveillance by judicial permission of those under trial or already sentenced because it will be voted on in two weeks' time.\n\nNikos Voutsis, the main opposition Radical Left Coalition (SYRIZA) parliamentary group's secretary, tabled an amendment which calls for the right of Parliament to decide - following a question by the Parliament president - on increasing the majority vote needed to suspend state funding for parties whose leading members have been sentenced for setting up a criminal organisation. Currently the number of votes necessary is 180. If the officials' sentencing is irreversible the party's funding would be permanently stopped, wheareas if they are found innocent in the appeals process, the suspended funds will be returned retroactively and without interest.\n\nSYRIZA's decision to table a separate amendment provoked the reaction of Interior Minister Yiannis Michelakis on Wednesday, who called the government's rider \"simple, clear and effective\" while the main opposition party has called the government's amendment \"problematic in various ways.\"\n\n[14] SYRIZA rider proposes 'enhanced majority' for suspension of parties' state funding\n\nIn a rider tabled in Parliament on Thursday, main opposition Radical Left Coalition (SYRIZA) has proposed that motions to suspend state funding for political parties accused or found guilty of forming a criminal organisation must be approved by an 'enhanced' Parliamentary majority (usually at least three fifths of the plenum) in order to be passed. SYRIZA also suggested that the enhanced majority vote clause be included in any future Constitutional amendment.\n\nSYRIZA Parliamentary group secretary Nikos Voutsis rejected criticism that his party is essentially opposed to the government-sponsored rider that would stop state funding for ultra-right Golden Dawn (GD), dismissing such criticism as a \"cheap publicity stunt\" that has nothing to do with reality.\n\nHe said that no discussion on the issue was carried out between the government and the political parties and the issue was not discussed in any of the Parliament's bodies.\n\nA draft amendment suspending state funding to parties facing criminal prosecution will be appended as a rider to an environment ministry bill on renewable energy sources, which is expected to be discussed and voted on at the Parliament's plenary session next week, Justice Minister Charalambos Athanassiou announced earlier.\n\nThe minister explained that the government wanted the amendment to be voted on quickly and didn't include it in the draft bill on electronic surveillance by judicial permission of those under trial or already sentenced to be voted on in two weeks.\n\n[15] DIM.AR on the suspension of political party state funding\n\nOpposition Democratic Left (DIM.AR) on Thursday commented on the confrontation between the government and main opposition Radical Left Coalition (SYRIZA) on the issue of \"the funding of criminal organizations like Golden Dawn,\" noting that \"it cannot become the field of unproductive confrontation between the democratic political forces\".\n\nA DIM.AR announcement underlined that \"in such crucial times, democratic sobriety and a united front against the Nazi phenomenon are necessary. Petty political party expediences have no place.\"\n\n[16] SYRIZA slams government for 'giving away' broadcasting frequencies\n\nMain opposition Radical Left Coalition (SYRIZA) on Thursday underlined the \"need to clear up the radio & television landscape,\" and said that adopting new rules for issuing licences to private television channels will be a priority for the party.\n\nSYRIZA also raised an issue of corruption over the government's use of summary procedures to \"arbitrarily legalise\" temporary broadcasting licenses issued to private TV channel owners 23 years ago, thus allowing them to switch to a digital signal platform illegally and without any charge, offering them what SYRIZA called \"the biggest gift\".\n\nAccording to SYRIZA, the closure of the state broadcaster ERT in the summer was another gift from the government to the private mass media, creating a monopoly in the new digital environment through the Greek digital TV signal provider Digea, behind which are the owners of the private television channels.\n\nSYRIZA underlined that \"the government has virtually legalized contribution dodging by writing off the debts of private TV channel owners, who have paid nothing all these years in return for using the broadcasting frequencies\".\n\nAccording to SYRIZA, the bankers, who continue to control the banks despite the fact they have undergone recapitalization with the taxpayers' money, approve high risk loans for TV channel owners, when small and medium-sized enterprises in need of cash are being turned down and forced to shut down.\n\n[17] Government claims again contradicted by IMF, Ind. Greeks party leader says\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has once again contradicted the claims of the Greek government, Independent Greeks party leader Panos Kammenos said on Thursday, commenting on the IMF's report that disputes the government's claim of a primary budget surplus.\n\n\"The IMF with its report about a zero primary surplus once again contradicts the coalition government and the prime minister, who will now hand out 70 percent of nothing to poor pensioners,\" he said.\n\n[18] KKE on economic policy\n\nThe Communist Party of Greece (KKE) on Thursday issued a statement charging that the \"measures of the government and its allies, whether they are called structural or horizontal, have one permanent and clear target: to create new fields of action and offer new 'breaks' to monopolies, for an exit from the crisis that benefits their profits, while at the same time the people will be burdened by unemployment, salary cuts and inflation.\"\n\n[19] ND marginally leads SYRIZA, poll shows\n\nThe New Democracy (ND) party retains a lead of 0.2 percent over main opposition Radical Left Coalition (SYRIZA), according to the results of an opinion poll conducted by Marc, commissioned by the Athens-based television station Alpha.\n\nThe ND would be preferred by 22.7 pct \"if elections were held today\" (as compared with 21.6 pct last May), while SYRIZA garnered 22.5 pct (20.7 pct last May)\n\nThird place was taken by the ultra-right Golden Dawn (Chryssi Avghi) party with 7.1 pct (9.4 pct last May), followed by PASOK 5.3 pct (4.8 pct), Independent Greeks 5.2 pct (5.6 pct), Communist Party of Greece 4.9 pct (4.5 pct) and Democratic Left 4.6 pct (4 pct).\n\nThe Eco-Greens garnered 1.2 pct and Accord for New Greece (A. Loverdos) 1 pct.\n\n[20] Financial Crime Unit, Information Service heads to brief parliament\n\nParliament will summon the heads of the Financial and Economic Crime Unit (SDOE) and the Greek Information Service (EYP) to be briefed about issues related to their jurisdiction, a decision that follows a proposal by main opposition Syriza MP Zoi Konstantopoulou to the Institutions and Transparency Committee on Thursday.\n\nSDOE head Stelios Stassinopoulos will be asked to brief the committee members about the progress of the \"Lagarde list\" issue, investigating the liability of Greek large-scale bank deposit owners for tax evasion, while EYP head Thanassis Dravillas will be asked to brief parliament about phone tapping, following media reports about such an activity against the Syriza party.\n\n[21] Parliament to post more documents online, for greater transparency\n\nParliament approved in its plenum session on Thursdasy a series of amendments that will introduce greater transparency, by uploading decisions and memos, project and procurement contracts and the number of its staff on its site.\n\nThe State Budget Office, which provides data to parliamentary committees, will present quarterly reports on progress in the state budget's execution, among others, and forecasts about public revenues and expenditures; a note on the public debt after 2014 has already been publicised.\n\nAmendments voted were part of the administrative section of the parliament's rules of order. Parliament's secretary general, Thanassis Papaioannou, asserted that \"everything will be published.\"\n\n[22] General Secretariat for Transparency and Human Rights unveils first report\n\nThe General Secretary for Transparency and Human Rights Giorgos Sourlas on Thursday unveiled the General Secretariat's annual report, one year after he took office.
