Illegal immigration is not merely a problem and a challenge, as tragedies do not occur only when shipwrecks occur, but also when these people arrive on the land,\" said Samaras.\n\n\"These are people without a future and without a past, who arrive in our countries leaving behind warring states and states facing financial problems. But we are not in a position to absorb them and this causes instability,\" the Greek premier added.\n\nHe set as priorities new policies for the repatriation of illegal immigrants, as well as new identification procedures and strengthening Frontex.\n\n\"All these must be done humanely, Europe should be a reference to values and hope for these people,\" he said.\n\n[02] Samaras in Malta: Common European front to deal with immigration\n\nVALETTA (ANA-MPA/N. Armenis)\n\nEurope must devise a common policy to deal with illegal immigration, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said in Malta on Monday, following his meeting with his Maltese counterpart Joseph Muscat.\n\nSamaras noted the importance of southern European countries forming a common front, especially for Greece, \"as unemployment is 27 percent and we have a lot of unemployed and many illegal immigrants, something that cannot continue.\"\n\nGreece is doing anything it can, he noted, going through tough times, to \"achieve fiscal health and significant infrastructural changes that will bring Greece back to economic normalcy.\"\n\nMuscat also referred to a common front to face illegal immigration and referred to the successive presidencies of the EU by Greece and Italy in 2014.\n\n\"There is no magical solution,\" he said, \"but we are showing results, and this issue cannot be left on its own or us hope that winter is coming and traffic will change.\"\n\n[03] Greek minister stresses migration issues in Mediterranean at EU General Affairs Council\n\nLUXEMBOURG (ANA-MPA/ M. Aroni)\n\nGovernment Vice-President and Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos on Monday asked the EU General Affairs Council for a show of \"active and immediate solidarity\" for the EU member-states of the Mediterranean struggling to cope with migration pressures.\n\nVenizelos raised the issue of migration flows in the Mediterranean, especially in light of the tragic events in Lampedusa, stressing that this was \"an extremely urgent matter\".\n\nThe minister said the EU must make an active display of solidarity based on the principle of an equal sharing of burdens and called for a comprehensive European plan that fully respected the sovereign rights of the member-states.\n\nHe also highlighted the great difficulties faced by Greece, due to its extensive coastline and position, noting that it was under constant and disproportionate pressure from migration and thus fully able to understand the situation facing countries such as Italy and Malta.\n\nVenizelos also contacted Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, who is visiting Valetta and Rome to discuss the issue of migration ahead of the European Council meeting on October 24.\n\nWith respect to Egypt, Venizelos agreed with a presentation made by EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton on the need for an EU contribution to preserving stability in the country, briefing his counterparts on the results of a trilateral meeting between Greece, Cyprus and Egypt held in New York on September 22.\n\nRegarding Syria, Venizelos stressed the importance of the 'Geneva II' process as a lever for achieving a political solution but also said that immediate mobilisation to deal with the humanitarian problems was a \"separate priority\".\n\nReferring to the upcoming Greek presidency of the EU, the minister said that Greece is ready to work with Ashton and the European Commission for the implementation of the decisions of the Vilnius summit on November 28.\n\n[04] Achieving primary surplus 'gives us choices', cabinet gen. secretary tells Vima FM\n\nSpeaking to the local radio station Vima FM on Monday, cabinet general secretary Panagiotis Baltakos stressed that achieving a primary surplus was the paramount goal, to which the government was directing the bulk of its efforts.\n\n\"The troika and the memorandum are a 'black' page in the history of the country and the entire effort underway is for us to stand on our feet and be able to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Everything is being done to achieve a primary surplus. Without it we are erased from the map. With it we can pay salaries and pensions and we have choices. Without a surplus, we have no choice,\" he said.\n\nBaltakos noted that the country now appeared to be on the way to achieving this goal, which would create other options that were not available before.\n\n\"Consequently, and based on the abilities that [Prime Minister Antonis Samaras] has shown until now - for we should not forget that he has been governing the country for a year and a half with 29 percent and achieved things that other prime ministers could not imagine, never mind achieve, with 44 percent - I think that everything is possible,\" he added.\n\nBaltakos noted that the troika came to Greece as a result of actions and policies implemented over decades, adding that it was not a question of pinning the blame on one side or the other.\n\n\"What is certain is that we brought [the troika] here ourselves and we will force it to leave by achieving our goals. This is what's needed,\" he stressed.\n\nOn the prospect of early elections, the cabinet general secretary underlined that there was no such intention and that the government wanted to run to the end of its four-year term in 2016. He did not rule out the possibility of early elections as a political \"accident,\" however, and he refused to speculate on the possible outcome of the European elections in May.\n\n\"The government has a four-year horizon - as the prime minister has said. This is reasonable. First growth and then elections. No one is a fool to hold elections in the midst of this sort of crisis. It's not good for the country nor for the one holding elections. And if the troika insists on this, so much the worse for them,\" he added.\n\nBaltakos also appeared confident that the prime minister will be able to resist the troika's demands and pressures, especially once the country achieved a primary surplus and had more options. He emphasised once again that Samaras had led what was possible the most difficult prime ministerial term ever to exist, governing Greece with 29 percent during one of the deepest crises since the foundation of the Greek state.\n\n[05] SYRIZA on economic policy; shipyards, Tsipras for EU Commission presidency\n\nMain opposition Radical Left Coalition (SYRIZA) on Monday lashed out at the government, strongly criticizing its economic and communications policy and underlining that \"the only neo-liberal 'success story' is that of the economic oligarchy of bankrupt bankers and the governments at their service\".\n\nThe SYRIZA economic policy sector noted that for workers, the \"success story\" translates into high unemployment, low salaries and a destruction of labour relations, as well as punishing taxation and foreclosures.\n\nAccording to SYRIZA, an exit from the crisis that benefits the greater social majority can be achieved through an overthrow of neo-liberal policy and abolition of austerity and its replacement by the Left's alternative proposal, which suggests the country's productive reconstruction and a re-foundation of Europe focusing on the ideals of real democracy and on solidarity between equal partners.\n\nSYRIZA also raised questions regarding to the stance of the ruling coalition leader New Democracy (ND) on the Hellenic Shipyards' contract for the building of six submarines signed by Evangelos Venizelos, leader of the junior coalition member PASOK, when he was a minister of defence. SYRIZA asked the party to state its position to a SYRIZA proposal for a Parliamentary investigation committee into the 'scandalous' contract. According to the main opposition, both Venizelos - currently government vice-president and foreign minister - and former finance minister George Papaconstantinou are both liable for the affair.\n\nIf ND refuses to vote in favour of a Parliamentary investigation committee it will be absolutely clear that it is \"covering\" for Venizelos \"for the sake of political and government balance\".\n\nSYRIZA based its arguments on statements made in April 2012, a few days before the May 6 elections, by the then ND spokesman Yiannis Mihelakis - now the minister of interior - who had referred to Venizelos' involvement. SYRIZA also referred to comments made in 2010 by the then ND sector head Theofilos Leontaridis, as regards the economic impact of the direct contract for the construction of two more submarines amidst unprecedented economic and fiscal constraints experienced by the country.\n\nSYRIZA also accused ND and Prime Minister Antonis Samaras of being unable to understand the importance of a proposal naming SYRIZA leader Alexis Tsipras as a candidate for the European Commission presidency, responding to a relevant statement made by ND spokeswoman Anna Assimakopoulou who said that he \"best expresses the marginalized political parties, the Marxist and Trotskyist parties that are fanatically set against the euro and the eurozone\".\n\n[06] ND comments on Tsipras' nomination as European Commission president\n\n\"Show me your friend so I can tell you who you are, is the popular saying,\" New Democracy press spokeswoman Anna Assimakopoulou commented after the presidents council of the European Left Party announced it will nominate Greek main opposition SYRIZA leader Alexis Tsipras for the seat of European Commission president.\n\nThe proposal of leftist parties will be formally presented at the European Left's Congress in Madrid on December 13-15.\n\n\"Fringe parties, and Marxist, Trotskyist, and fanatically anti-euro and anti-eurozone parties, see Tsipras as their genuine spokesperson,\" she added.\n\n[07] SYRIZA on gov't stance before troika\n\nThe government is trapped in the memorandum policy of austerity and destruction, main opposition SYRIZA said on Monday, adding that whatever leaks to the press about so- called negotiating with the troika of lenders to Greece cannot reverse the subordination of Greece to its lenders and the memorandum's commitments.\n\nIn an announcement, the party said that there can be no negotiation when the core of the memorandum's policy - namely the austerity and the dissolution of labour rights - is not challenged.\n\n\"The real change in the policy applied means the reversal of the memorandums within the framework of a real negotiation, aiming at a European arrangement to repay the debt and support growth,\" it said. \"That's something that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's obedient pupils do not want to and cannot do, becoming every day that passes more unreliable and isolated not only in Greece but abroad as well,\" it added.\n\n[08] Independent Greeks on gov't negotiations with troika\n\n\"After the public relations storm with the governement's 'success story' and the primary surplus, the hour of the truth has come and troika of lenders now demands the implementation of the harsh measures that the well-known guardians of the memorandum have co-signed, sinking the Greek people into extreme poverty,\" Independent Greeks parliamentary group spokesman Notis Marias said on Monday, warning that \"the Greek people will not accept their fate without reacting.\n\n[09] KKE on government-troika\n\nThe Communist Party of Greece (KKE) commented Monday on the upcoming talks between the Greek government and the country's EC/ECB/IMF troika of lenders, saying that \"the so-called confrontation between the government with the troika seeks to claim facilitations that will allow even greater support for the interests of Greek capital,\" and not to stop the barbarous antipopular measures.\n\nThe KKE announcement also criticised the government of \"obscuring that fact that a multitude of antipopular measures have already been agreed upon....while new 'structural' measures, such as new taxes on property, privatisations, lay offs etc, are ante portas.\"\n\n[10] Parliament to decide on removing immunity from AN.EL leader Panos Kammenos\n\nA Supreme Court Prosecutor on Monday forwarded to Parliament the case file against the leader of opposition Independent Greeks (AN.EL) party Panos Kammenos, compiled by a Thessaloniki First Instance Court prosecutor in response to comments made by Kammenos, who said local residents in Halkidiki should \"lynch Aristotelis Mayor Christos Pahtas\".\n\nParliament will now have to decide whether Kammenos' immunity should be lifted so he can face charges for an act allegedly committed on September 11 in Thessaloniki in the margins of the 78th TIF in violation of article 184 of the Criminal Code.\n\nBased on the article mentioned, \"anyone in any way instigating or inciting a felony or misdemeanour can be faced with a prison sentence of up to three years\".\n\nThe party leader's comments followed revelations that the water in a local village had become contaminated by arsenic and was unfit to drink - amidst speculation that this was linked to controversial gold mining operations in the area, which are opposed by several individuals in Halkidiki, but the contamination was later proved to be unrelated to the mining activity.\n\n[11] Interior min. Michelakis meets with Bavarian counterpart Herrmann\n\nInterior Minister Yiannis Michelakis, whose is currently in Germany, met on Monday with his Bavarian counterpart Joachim Herrmann in view of the fourth Greek-German assembly opening on Tuesday in Nuremberg, a Greek Interior Ministry announcement said.\n\nMichelakis referred to the traditionally good relations between the two counties that have been upgraded even further in recent years. He placed special emphasis on large the reform effort of the Samaras government and to the Greek premier's will to advance reforms without considering the political cost.\n\nMichelakis told his counterpart that based on the reform efforts and the sacrifices of the Greek people, which have already produced their first faint results, there should be a new discussion early next year on the already articulated commitment by EU partners on the sustainability of Greek debt.\n\n\"Greece owes to its next generations to continue the reform work, but it is the adjustment of debt the main factor that will pave the way for growth as it is the main vehicle to bring new investments in Greece,\" Michelakis underlined.\n\nThe Bavarian minister referred to the recent election results in Germany, describing the results as fully satisfactory and as a confirmation of the policy Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nHerrmann added that Germany was closely monitoring developments in Greece and knows how big the sacrifices of the Greek people are. \"Greece's return to growth is a decisive factor and Germany, provided that reforms will continue, is determined to offer any possible assistance.\"\n\n[12] Justice minister holds meeting with EC Task Force for Greece head Reichenbach\n\nEuropean Commission Task Force for Greece head Horst Reichenbach held his second meeting with Justice Minister Haralambos Athanasiou on Monday.\n\nAccording to an announcement by the Justice ministry, the meeting was held in a very positive climate and Reichenbach expressed \"satisfaction once again over cooperation between the two sides concerning the transfer of know-how and technical support on Justice issues, as well as over the outcome resulting from this cooperation over the past two years.\"\n\nThe issues discussed during the meeting - examining also the possibility of further cooperation between the Justice ministry and the Task Force, included electronic justice (E-justice), justice statistics, mediation and communication and publicity programme and revision of the civil code judicial procedure.\n\n[13] Kyriakos Gerontopoulos leaves tomorrow for a two-day visit in Lebanon\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Kyriakos Gerontopoulos is to depart on Tuesday for a two-day visit to Lebanon, where he will meet with Patriatch Ioannis I, Lebanese Foreign Minister Adnan Mansour and Greek expatriates in Lebanon.\n\nGerontopoulos is meeting on Tuesday with Mansour, the board of the Greek Community of Beirut and the association of Lebanese Greek university alumni. The assistant secretary will meet on Wednesday with Greek Othodox Patriarch of Antioch and the East Ioannis I to discuss the issue of the two abducted clerics in Syria.\n\nThe minister will also visit Agios Ioannis Damaskinos University to hold talks with professors and students, as well as 'Agios Georgios' Greek Orthodox Hospital in Beirut.\n\n[14] Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew visits Roma community in western Thessaloniki\n\nEcumenical Patriarch Bartholomew on Monday inaugurated an intercultural school in a Roma community in the district of Dentropotamos, western Thessaloniki, noting that there is \"no comparison between prevention and treatment\", referring to the education received by children today and the threats they are faced with, including drug and alcohol abuse, among others.\n\nThe Ecumenical Patriarch, currently on a visit to Thessaloniki, used a quote by Saint Nektarios noting that \"young people are the Church's and the nation's hope,\" adding that \"we should all be on alert to give the great battle of education\".\n\nDeputy Education Minister Kostas Gioulekas, who attended the event, underlined that education is the government's top priority and referred to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's role in the nation's education through the centuries. He also underlined the Ecumenical Patriarch's \"struggle\" and \"lasting interest\" in the reopening of the Theological School of Halki.\n\nEcumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was declared honorary citizen of the Municipality of Ampelokipi-Menemeni. Earlier, he had addressed the faithful in the Saint Nektarios Church in Dendropotamos.\n\nOn Monday morning, he inaugurated a community health clinic and visited Metropolis of Neapolis and Stavroupolis welfare organizations. He also visited the Saint Panteleimon Church in Amplelokipi, where he met with Health Minsiter Adonis Georgiadis.\n\n[15] Ministers head mayoral delegation to Greek-German Convention in Nuremberg\n\nNUREMBERG (ANA-MPA/D. Dimitrakoudis)\n\nA delegation of two ministers and over 60 mayors from Greece are departing for Nuremberg on Tuesday to attend the two-day proceedings of the 4th Greek-German Convention.\n\nInterior Minister Yiannis Michelakis and Rural Development and Food Minister Athanassios Tsaftaris will be attending the meetings that will look at options of collaboration between agriculture and local government in Greece and Germany under the general title of \"The Municipality of the Future\".\n\nFederal Deputy Labour Minister Hans-Joachim Fuchtel, who was in Greece early in October to add the finishing details, will be representing German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the event that is organised by the Hanns-Seidel (HSS) Foundation.\n\nTsaftaris will speak on the promotion of farm products and the strengthening of local farm economies, and will meet with politicians and agricultural experts of Bavaria, while the delegation will visit the agricultural company \"Guenther Felsner\", belonging to the president of the agricultural cooperative in Mittelfranken, Bavaria.\n\nThe Convention involves the exchange of experience and cooperation between specialists, businesses and local representatives of the two countries. The first three meetings have been held in Greece.\n\n[16] Health Minister Georgiadis' interview\n\nHealth Minister Adonis Georgiadis on Monday referred to the generic medicine vs the patent drug option available to patients under public health insurance coverage and to the increased contribution they will have to pay if they choose the patent drugs instead of the generic, a measure effective as of today.\n\nIn an interview with ANA-MPA Web TV, he said that public health services provider EOPYY \"will give to patients good medicine for which they will pay only half of the contribution toward its cost if they opt for it\".\n\n\"If the patients choose a less expensive medicine, compared with the reference price, they will pay half the contribution, namely, 12.5 pct from 25 pct,\" he said.\n\n\"But if they choose the expensive patent drug because they think - and not the medical scientists - that it is better, then they will have to bear the cost of their choice,\" the health minister said, adding that \"if they want to be extravagant they should pay the cost\".\n\nAccording to Georgiadis, the measure will correspond to 150 million euros in annual savings for EOPYY.\n\nResponding to a relevant question on whether the amount of 1.5 billion euros in state funding will be earmarked for EOPYY allowing it to repay part of its overdue debts to pharmacists and other health services providers dated before December 31, 2011, he said that the organization's debts are being covered by the state.\n\n[17] Evangelos Meimarakis on 'isolating' inappropriate behaviour in Parliament\n\nParliament President Evangelos Meimarakis on Monday stressed that Parliament must itself \"isolate\" behaviours and actions that are inconsistent with the office of a Parliamentary deputy and punishable by law.\n\nMeimarakis pointed out that citizens must vote for politicians who they believe are worthy to represent them, during a meeting with Hellenic Navy warant officers from the Palaskas navy training centre. He admitted, however, that there had been some bad behaviour on the part of MPs, \"which did not do credit to the Parliamentary office and the trust placed in us by the citizens that elected us to represent them.\"\n\n\"Citizens must not only vote for parties and their programmes, but also the most suitable, in their opinion, politicians to lead the country,\" added Meimarakis.\n\n[18] Ombudsman proposes ceiling for seizure of rents when sole source of income\n\nThe Greek Ombudsman on Monday suggested in a document to Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras that the ministry set a ceiling of 1,000 euros as the minimum limit for seizing income from rents by the public sector, when this was the sole source of income.\n\nCitizens with rent property as their only income had already filed complaints protesting over the seizure of the total amount of rent they receive for public debts, as a result depriving them of their only income.\n\nThe Ombudsman found that in these cases, the seizure of the total amount of rents implies the inability to meet the basic needs of the debtor and deprives the debtor of the ability to maintain a decent standard of living. As a result, it conflicts with article 2 par. 1 of the Constitution and the principle of proportionality.\n\nFinancial News\n\n[19] FinMin Stournaras stresses importance of tourism for Greek economy\n\nFinance Minister Yannis Stournaras, addressing the 12th Conference of the Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) \"Tourism and Growth\", stressed the importance of tourism in the Greek economy's spine.\n\nThe minister pointed out that over the past decade tourism produces directly and indirectly about 16 percent of GDP and employs 19 percent of the country's workforce. He added that tourism's net revenues cover a third of the deficit of the country's trade balance, a role that is considerably important particularly in the present period, as he said.\n\nStournaras said that this year arrivals are expected to exceed 17 million, while over the January-August eight-month period incoming travel movement increased by 14.7 percent, net tourist revenues increased by about 18 percent. Greece, as he said, in 2013 and out of 140 countries ranked 32nd as regards competitiveness of the tourist sector, but 3rd from as regards tourist infrastructures, behind Austria and Italy.\n\n[20] Greek banks to meet target for boosting market liquidity this year\n\n\"We cannot offer loans where there is no viability. We don't want to create more red loans. Loans are the savings of citizens. We must be careful. We all want money. The question is whether all of us being depositors would grant a loan to all those seeking a loan,\" George Zanias, president of Hellenic Bank Association told reporters after a meeting with Development Minister Costis Hatzidakis on Monday.\n\nThe focus of the scheduled meeting was to set measurable targets in boosting liquidity in the market. Speaking to reporters, after the meeting, the Development minister said: \"a necessary precondition to restore liquidity is restoring confidence. The main opposition should demonstrate more responsibility and the troika should show its confidence in deeds,\" while he added that banks too have to adhere to their commitments. \"We watch how programmes are evolving.

According to sources, the woman will be taken to Korydallos prison and the man to the prison facility in Larissa.\n\nNo statements were made by their counsel after the decision was announced.\n\nAccording to sources, the 39-year-old claimed in testimony to the magistrate that the child was given into their care voluntarily by its birth mother and a Bulgarian man, both of them Roma, when it was still a baby. He said the child had been left with the family at a time when he was absent and was there when he returned after 15 days.\n\nIn fact, he said that he had not wanted to keep the girl because he has a criminal record but that his partner said that she had grown too fond of the child to part with it, so it stayed with the family.\n\nAccording to earlier statements by the couple's lawyers, they have asked the authorities to locate a cell phone that they say belonged to the man that delivered the child, in order to shed light on the case.\n\nIn fact, the 39-year-old's testimony was interrupted for approximately 15 minutes so that this request could be considered but then resumed because it could not be acted upon without an order from the Misdemeanour Court Justices' Council.\n\nSources said the 39-year-old referred to both the Bulgarian man and the birth mother by name, so that they can be sought and found and has also claimed that the child's real mother is living in Greece.\n\nThe case emerged after police conducting a routine raid in the Roma settlement in Farsala spotted the blonde, green-eyed little girl and became curious about her origins, due to the scant resemblance to the couple presented themselves as her parents. Their suspicions were further aroused when the couple gave conflicting accounts about how she came to be in their care and by irregularities in the registration of their other children (with six births registered within a few months of each other), while a DNA test proved conclusively that Maria was not their child, as they had claimed at first.\n\nA statement released by the 'Smile of the Child' charity where Maria was taken after she was removed from the couple said the girl was slightly older than originally thought, being around five or six based on a dental examination, was in very good health, and was now in hospital for medical tests ordered by a public prosecutor.\n\nThousands of calls have been made to the charity from all over the world since the case first hit the headlines, while information is arriving from Greece and abroad via social networking sites and is being forwarded to the appropriate authorities for evaluation, so that the girl's family can be found. As the head of the charity Costas Giannopoulos said, the search for the girl's biological parents is continuing.\n\n[38] Mystery baby Maria given by birth parents, Roma couple father claims\n\nIn testimony to an examining magistrate on Monday, the 39-year-old Roma man who had custody of little Maria, the blonde and green-eyed girl found living with him and his 40-year-old Roma wife in Farsala, claimed that the girl had been turned over into their care by a Bulgarian Roma and her birth mother, also a Roma, when she was still a baby.\n\nAccording to his lawyers, the couple have asked the authorities to locate a cell phone that they claim belonged to the individual that intervened for the delivery of the child, possibly belonging to the Bulgarian man referred to in the suspect's testimony, in order to shed light on the case.\n\nWhen the request was made his testimony was interrupted for approximately 15 minutes so that it could be considered but resumed shortly afterward, since it could not immediately be acted upon immediately, requiring an order from the Misdemeanour Court Justices' Council.\n\nThe magistrates are now hearing the testimony of the 40-year-old woman that had presented herself as the child's mother.\n\nAccording to sources, the 39-year-old referred to both the Bulgarian middle-man and the birth mother by name, so that they can be sought and found and has also claimed that the child's real mother is living in Greece.\n\nRegarding the rest of the couple's numerous children, the 39-year-old said offered to undergo DNA tests to prove that at least five are his own children, while the rest he said belong to his partner.\n\nOnce both have testified, the examining magistrate and public prosecutor will confer to decide on whether they should be remanded in custody or released.\n\nThe case emerged after police conducting a routine raid in the Roma settlement in Farsala spotted the little girl and became curious about her origins, due to the scant resemblance to the couple presented themselves as her parents. Their suspicions were further aroused when the couple gave conflicting accounts about how she came to be with them and by irregularities in registration of their other children (with six births registered within months of each other), while a DNA test proved conclusively that Maria was not their child, as they had claimed.\n\n[39] Over 40 cases concerning trading of minors, illegal adoptions pending in Greek courts\n\nEvidence at the disposal of the Court of Appeals prosecutors nationwide show that the phenomena of trading of minors and illegal adoptions have taken up alarming dimensions, based on relevant case files forwarded to Parliament in late August by Justice Minister Charalambos Athanassiou, it was made public on Monday.\n\nThe document referred to more than 40 case files concerning illegal rings engaging in such practices, most of them in the northern city of Thessaloniki and on the eastern part of the island of Crete.

We have already done it for the Immigration Code, and we shall also pass it for Greek citizens also. Whoever is not born in a hospital or in a maternity clinic, where a child's birth can be certified legally and formally, we shall proceed to maternity or paternity and DNA testing,\" the minister said.\n\nAsked about a practice of parents showing up with their children and two witnesses to establish their legal parentage, the minister said, \"They will not be able to do this, as this regulation will be abolished.\"\n\n[41] Caretaker of fugitive businessman released with conditions pending his trial\n\nThe caretaker of the villa of fugitive entrepreneur Anastassios Pallis was released on Monday with conditions after testifying before an examining magistrate on aggravated felony charges for possession of firearms.\n\nThe defendant, who was forbidden to leave the country and will have to report to a police station twice a month until his trial, was arrested a few days ago at Pallis' house during a police search for illegal guns.\n\nHe denies all charges against him and, according to his defence attorney, the defendant used to pick up the mail and bills from his employer's house every 10 days and delivered it to his lawyer.\n\nHe also told the examining magistrate that no suspicious activity on behalf of his co-defendant and employer, such as illegal transactions or illegal gun trade, had come to his attention.\n\nAs regards the seized collectible firearms and the guns of the fugitive's personal guard, he said that as far as he knows, they were all legally purchased in the United States.\n\nHe also said that he hasn't seen any of the ultra-right Golden Dawn (GD) party MPs and members at Pallis' house or at his weapons' museum, noting that he had last seen his employer on July 19 or 20.\n\n[42] Rally to start in Aghia Paraskevi and march to Parliament on Tuesday\n\nThe union of local government (POE-OTA) employees called a three-hour work stoppage for Tuesday (10:00 am - 1:00 pm), in support of school guards who are expected in Athens on a protest march, against layoffs and mobility.\n\nSchool guards protesting layoffs and \"the primary surplus, unemployment and poverty\" started from Thessaloniki on foot on September 28 and are expected to reach Marathon in Attica on Monday morning.
