        "text": "The Human Rights Council today heard from 28 dignitaries as it continued its high-level segment.\n\nSpeaking were Riad Al-Malki, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of the State of Palestine; Santiago Cafiero, Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship of Argentina; Zambry Abd Kadir, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia; James Cleverly, MP, Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs of the United Kingdom; Ziyambi Ziyambi, Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs of Zimbabwe; Annalena Baerbock, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany; Ana Cecilia Gervasi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Peru; Retno L.P. Marsudi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia; Anniken Huitfeldt, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Norway; Hadja Lahbib, Minister for Foreign Affairs, European Affairs and Foreign Trade and the Federal Cultural Institutions of Belgium; Erlyne Ndembet Damas, Minister of Justice in charge of human rights of Gabon; Catherine Colonna, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France; Silvio Luiz de Almeida, Minister of Human Rights and Citizenship of Brazil; Tanja Fajon, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of Slovenia; and Alfonso Nsue Mokuy, Third Vice Prime Minister of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nAlso speaking were Johan Forssell, Minister for Foreign Trade and Minister for International Development Cooperation of Sweden; Hala Bint Mazyad Al-Tuwaijri, President of the Human Rights Commission of Saudi Arabia; Qin Gang, Minister for Foreign Affairs of China; Dominique Hasler, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Education and Sport of Liechtenstein; Thórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörd Gylfadóttir, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland; Nikolaos-Georgios Dendias, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece; Mehmet Kemal Bozay, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Türkiye; Muzaffar Khuseinzoda, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan; Louise Musjikiwabo, Secretary-General of the Organization de la Francophine; Jan Beagle, Director-General of the International Development Law Organization; Riccardo Paterno Di Montecupo, Grand Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Sovereign Order of Malta; and Achim Steiner, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nSpeakers discussed how the struggle for human rights continued around the world today. There was concern about continuous and massive violations of human rights in times of conflict, in particular in the context of the war in Ukraine. One year ago, Russia launched its unprovoked and illegal invasion, starting a new large-scale war in Europe. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a blatant violation of international law and the United Nations Charter. Some speakers reaffirmed their strong support to the Government and people of Ukraine, and called on Russia to end the violence against Ukraine and withdraw its troops, remembering its international obligations. In Iran, hundreds of deaths and thousands of arbitrary arrest of protesters had taken places. In Afghanistan, the situation of human rights was extremely troubling for women and girls. It was important that the Human Rights Council addressed such situations. Speakers highlighted climate change as a key issue and highlighted their commitment to working towards a sustainable future.\n\nThe webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here. All meeting summaries can be found here. Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council’s fifty-second regular session can be found here.\n\nThe Council will next meet at 5 p.m. to hold its annual high-level panel discussion on human rights mainstreaming on the theme of “A reflection on five years of the United Nations Youth Strategy (Youth 2030): mapping a blueprint for the next steps”.\n\nHigh-level Segment\n\nRIAD MALKI, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of the State of Palestine, reaffirmed the sincere condolences of the Palestinian people to the Syrian and Turkish peoples that had endured a natural disaster of overwhelming proportions. Every detail of Palestinian suffering was thoroughly documented by United Nations bodies, and international, Israeli, and Palestinian human rights organizations. The crisis in Palestine was not due to a lack of information. The international community knew that Palestinians needed protection, but refused to offer it. The State of Palestine reiterated the call for international protection for the undefended Palestinian people from unrelenting Israeli-sponsored violence. This was the duty of the United Nations.\n\nAs the Palestinian people heard hollow statements, they also heard news of the world showing solidarity with others facing a humanitarian and justice crisis. The entire international system was crumbling due to hypocrisy and double standards. This past year, Israel had killed more Palestinians in the occupied West Bank than it had in 16 years. Many international actors had used their political clout to shield Israel from accountability and to bully the Palestinians out of seeking justice. Some went as far as to nominate Israel to sit on the committee charged with reviewing the United Nations Charter. The Council had an obligation to right this wrong. There was still time to defend the noble system against those eroding it to serve their needs. But time was running out. Perhaps the upcoming commemoration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights would provide an opportunity to correct the collective path and with it the injustices that befell the Palestinians.\n\nSANTIAGO CAFIERO, Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship of Argentina, recalled Argentina’s own violent history under dictatorship and the lessons taught about the importance of human rights. The Argentinean human rights organization Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo continued the search for these grandchildren, illegally adopted under the military dictatorship. Argentina knew the experience of 30,000 disappeared persons and called on all countries that had not done so to accede to the Convention on Enforced Disappearances. Noting the anniversary of the war in Ukraine and the various human rights violations related to the conflict, Mr. Cafiero called on the Russian Federation to put an immediate end to its aggression and to move toward. While attacks against women and girls and minorities were notable throughout the world, he highlighted landmark legislation within the United Nations to protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals.\n\nHuman rights must be defended, Mr. Cafiero said. The Universal Periodic Review was a productive dialogue that would be maintained by Argentina. Hate speech was a scourge affecting Argentina with an assassination attempt on Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in 2022, but also the world. Stereotypes had always been instrumentalised to dehumanise and scapegoat, “as if we were killing things and not people”. Argentina reaffirmed its commitment to human rights and the mandate of the Council. To contribute, Argentina would host the third World Forum on Human Rights.\n\nZAMBRY ABD KADIR, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia, said history had shown that the protection and promotion of human rights fostered robust democracy, and Malaysia’s experience was no different. The formation of the recent Coalition Unity Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the peaceful transition of power in Malaysia were clear testimonies of the country’s democratic growth and maturity. Malaysia was gravely concerned with challenges brought about by conflict, climate change, environmental degradation and food insecurity, which, in turn, threatened humanity’s very own survival. Alarming as it was, the situation would only get worst in the coming decades. As such, Malaysia emphasised that human rights could not be an afterthought in the response to these challenges. The Human Rights Council must continue to address these issues, collectively and collaboratively.\n\nIronically, the international community was commemorating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action while abuses against the already-oppressed persisted. It was completely incomprehensible to continue to preach for human rights yet turn a blind eye to ongoing atrocities. The repeated insult on Islam and burning of the Holy Quran were an unspeakable affront to all: these acts were done with malicious intent to sabotage efforts for communities of different faiths to live peacefully with one another. Malaysia stressed that freedom of speech and expression must be exercised with democratic accountability. Defamation of any religion must be punishable by law.\n\nJAMES CLEVERLY, MP, Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs of the United Kingdom, said the struggle for human rights continued across the world today. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its illegal so-called annexations were a blatant violation of international law and the United Nations Charter. The Commission of Inquiry, which this Council established last year, had concluded that war crimes had been committed in Ukraine. The Human Rights Council needed to condemn Russia’s actions. The Ukrainian people needed justice. That was why this session needed to renew the Commission of Inquiry’s mandate.\n\nMr. Cleverly said that last year, the High Commissioner for Human Rights published a report that found evidence of arbitrary detention, torture, and sexual and gender-based violence taking place in Xinjiang. Mr. Cleverly urged China to engage with the Council and uphold the international obligations into which it had freely entered.\n\nThe Hong Kong and Chinese authorities were urged to uphold the Sino-British Joint Declaration and to implement the recommendations of the Human Rights Committee report. As for Iran, since October, the United Kingdom had introduced five separate sanction packages targeting those individuals and entities responsible for serious human rights violations in Iran.\n\nZIYAMBI ZIYAMBI, Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs of Zimbabwe, reaffirmed Zimbabwe’s commitment to equality for all, the sanctity of life, and to the protection of all fundamental human rights. Zimbabwe had cooperated with both regional and international human rights mechanisms and acceded to various treaties. Domestic reform was underway to advance the welfare of the most vulnerable people in Zimbabwean society. To that end, a raft of legislation on marriage and the rights of minors would notably outlaw child marriage and ensure the welfare of children through the creation of an independent juvenile justice system as well as an independent complaints mechanism.\n\nThe protection and promotion of human rights required collaboration between the Government and civil society organizations. Zimbabwe therefore welcomed this approach with organizations that were driven by a genuine commitment to human rights. It had amended its Private and Voluntary Organizations Act, just one of the measures taken following the 2016 Financial Action Task Force report on the country. The Government would also focus on preventing money laundering and combatting financial terrorism. Zimbabwe had been negatively impacted by unilateral coercive measures which had haemorrhaged the economy and made the attainment of human rights difficult, and it called for them to be lifted.\n\nANNALENA BAERBOCK, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, said Russian troops had taken away children from children’s homes in Ukraine, reportedly abducting them during its war of aggression against that country. This was abhorrent. Germany would not rest until every single child was home: children’s rights were human rights, and human rights were universal. The international community must speak up for each victim - each victim had a name and a life. The international community must say their names and uphold their rights, along with calling out the perpetrators. It was crucial for the Council to extend the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry, as impunity prevented justice.\n\nIn November, the Council had voted in favour of setting up a Mission to document the suppression of human rights in Iran, giving the human rights defenders in that country hope that the world had not forgotten them. Germany stood with those defenders every day, and called upon the authorities to grant access to the Fact-Finding Mission. Women’s rights were not only human rights, they were also an indicator of the state of human rights within a society, such as in Afghanistan, where the Taliban had forced women out of all areas of public life. The international community must take a coordinated stance on aid programmes, making clear that it was vital for women to be part of them, or women and children would not be reached.\n\nANA CECILIA GERVASI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Peru, said it was essential to address the difficult situation that Peru had been going through since 7 December and the recent episodes of social demonstrations at the national level. She expressed the deep sorrow of the Government of Peru for the tragic loss of life of compatriots. Authorities were carrying out the corresponding investigations in the civil courts. The Government had also established a Multisectoral Commission to attend to the bereaved of the deceased and those who suffered serious injuries in the mobilizations. The Public Defender of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights had provided 115 visits to relatives of people who died and were injured in mobilizations throughout the country, as well as legal attention to 432 detainees.\n\nIn the year the world celebrated the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Peru maintained an unwavering commitment to multilateralism. Peru had approached recent events with total openness and transparency before human rights systems. Peru successfully completed its fourth cycle review of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council, and would appear before further human rights committees in coming weeks. Peru aspired to become a Member of the Human Rights Council again for the period 2024-2026. The State was convinced of the need to build effective democracies that generated concrete actions to improve the quality of life of people and close the gaps that affect the lives of Peruvians.\n\nRetno L.P. Marsudi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, said that the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was an occasion to recommit to the values enshrined in the document. Respect for human rights had to be a precondition for peace and stability. Wars and conflicts had to be ended, everywhere - from Afghanistan to Palestine and from Myanmar to Ukraine. The international community would further need to focus on prevention wherein governments would have a responsibility to ensure affirmative policies, equality and recourse mechanisms. Such a focus required admitting past mistakes to repair. Just this year, the President of Indonesia had expressed regret for 12 human rights violations in the past. This kind of courage would be key moving forward.\n\nTo accomplish the necessary work of strengthening human rights structures, the Council would have to keep up with today’s complex challenges through impartiality, transparency and dialogue, and avoid politicisation of human rights. Finger pointing and double standards would only divide the Council. The international community would instead have to unite, eschewing an “us versus them” mentality. Indonesia, as Chair of Association of South-East Asian Nations would do its part through reinforcing the mandates of the Association’s Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children and institutionalise its human rights dialogue. Ms. Marsudi put forward Indonesia’s candidacy to the Council for 2024-2026\n\nHOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iran, said Iran’s thoughts and views of human rights and the mechanisms established for its sake were that the protection and promotion of human rights were a shared sentiment for all nations, and no State or group of States should entitle themselves to claim exclusive ownership of human rights, nor should any State make any other State submit to any interpretation of human rights. The resolution that established the Human Rights Council reaffirmed its purposes and principles, including the development of friendly relations between Nations based on respect, human rights, and the self-determination of peoples. In practice, though, it had been forced to take up such agendas that did not serve these principles, nor contribute to friendly relations among nations.\n\nUnilateral coercive measures were inhuman, as they systematically violated the human rights of the targeted populations, and it was sheer hypocrisy to advocate for the human rights of Iranians whilst depriving the same people of their basic rights to health, education and life. No country could claim to be perfect in its human rights performance. The peaceful assemblies that took place in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini had turned violent following the malign interference of certain bodies. No responsible State could let public security and order be compromised by violent and lawless behaviour. Thorough investigations would be carried out into the events.\n\nANNIKEN HUITFELDT, Minister of Foreign Affairs Norway, said Norway was deeply concerned about the worsening situation of human rights in Iran and urged Iran to respond with meaningful reform and to immediately stop executions. Globally, these were challenging times. The war in Ukraine was having devastating global consequences. It was reversing development gains, threatening progress on the 2030 Agenda, compounding the climate crisis ,and amplifying armed conflict elsewhere. Norway’s Nansen Support Programme for Ukraine included assistance for hard-hit countries in the Global South.\n\nOne year ago, Russia launched its unprovoked and illegal invasion, starting a new large-scale war in Europe. Ms. Huitfeldt reaffirmed Norway’s strong support to the Government and people of Ukraine. The war was a clear breach of the United Nations Charter. Russia was responsible for the war and was responsible for bringing the war to an end. Human rights defenders continued to be an essential voice. They must not be silenced. This was a priority for Norway at the Security Council. In this session, Norway would present a resolution to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders.\n\nHADJA LAHBIB, Minister for Foreign Affairs, European Affairs and Foreign Trade and the Federal Cultural Institutions of Belgium, said that human rights were not a favour handed down by States but an obligation, and recalled that the Universal Declaration emerged out of the worst war history had known. Now on the one-year anniversary of the war of Russian aggression in Ukraine, the international community could repeat history despite its lessons. Belgium supported human rights within a war context and supported the independent commission. A victim-centred approach, meaning no impunity, needed to be adopted and this would be a priority during Belgium’s mandate on the Council. Emphasis would be put on all complimentary instruments.\n\nWhile the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women was written more than 25 years ago, women and girls rights were far from achieved and even in deep decline in countries such as Afghanistan, with the near total disappearance of women and girls from public life, as well as in Iran with the killing of Mahsa Amini and the execution of protesters. Belgium would organise a debate on women’s participation in politics to develop concrete actions to be adopted.\n\nThis year also celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders but increasing direct attacks against them persisted while civic space shrank. The Minister urged the international community to allow human rights defenders to carry out their duties and aligned with the European Union in its commitment to this cause.\n\nERLYNE NDEMBET DAMAS, Minister of Justice in charge of human rights of Gabon, said 2023 was the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the thirtieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. The High Commissioner, through the Universal Declaration for Human Rights 75 initiative, had urged the international community to rethink actions to re-establish the universality and indivisibility of human rights, and Gabon supported this important initiative. Within the Human Rights Council, Gabon intended to pursue a policy of proactive involvement in order to promote human rights, whether through its own initiatives or through support for others’ initiatives.\n\nGabon was committed to stepping up its efforts to effectively guarantee all human rights, in line with the recommendations made by the relevant mechanisms. Gabon was reviewed in January within the framework of the Universal Periodic Review, and had demonstrated the significant progress made in the last few years, but also shown the challenges and programmes devised to ensure that all could enjoy their human rights within the country, including limiting the number of persons in detention through various means, improving the living conditions of detainees, and strengthening capacity for human rights for law enforcement. Gabon was committed to continuing to work for the protection and promotion of human rights throughout the world.\n\nCATHERINE COLONNA, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France, noted that one year ago, Russia had triggered a war of aggression that was unjustified and unjustifiable, undermining the territorial integrity of Ukraine and implementing a series of human rights violations, including rapes, deliberate attacks on hospitals, and deportation of children. France deplored that Russian atrocities were also committed elsewhere in the world, for instance in Mali, and appealed to States to uphold human rights everywhere, calling for action. Human rights were universal and indivisible – the foundation of humanity. In Iran, human rights defenders, particularly women, were targeted. Five tranches of sanctions against perpetrators had already been pursued at the European Union level against Iran. Honouring international human rights was relevant also in Afghanistan, with the Taliban segregating women and girls.\n\nFrance would continue the fight for the abolition of the death penalty everywhere and the promotion of the freedom of the media. In Russia, there was a danger to instrumentalise history to promote warmongering narratives. France would promote the study of history in this Council. France further called on China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, like it had done with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The right to a healthy environment should also be promoted. The international community could count on France to continue to defend progress and societies that protected human rights.\n\nSILVIO LUIZ DE ALMEIDA, Minister of Human Rights and Citizenship of Brazil, said that it was time to heal the wounds and overcome gaps that divided the world. As Brazil’s destiny was intwined with the world’s, human rights for all peoples were called for. Double standards and selectivity prevented such work. Within the country, Brazil was working to rebuild bridges between Brazilians and addressed the crisis faced by the indigenous Yanomani people, effectively restoring their sovereignty; Brazil would not interfere in their decisions. Further the creation of the Ministry of Equality, the Ministry for Women, and the Ministry of Human Rights and Citizenship would set up a legal framework to protect human rights.\n\nBrazil was committed to combatting State violence, especially against black youth in the country who had suffered greatly. A Ministry for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and asexual people was created as well as a directorate for homeless persons. Women would have their sexual and reproductive rights restored. Though memory, truth and justice had been trampled upon in recent years, its rightful place would be restored. Finally, the world would need to unite against hatred. The rapid spread of hate speech based on racism, xenophobia and “lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender phobia” had increased with fascism and must be addressed. Brazil requested the support of Member States for Brazil’s election to the Council for the 2024-2026 period.\n\nTANJA FAJON, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of Slovenia, said the Human Rights Council was meeting in the shadow of the devastating earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria, a brutal war in Ukraine, and many other humanitarian tragedies, conflicts and human rights violations around the globe. This was the time to recommit to the United Nations Charter and international law, to join forces to protect human lives and dignity, and to stand together in solidarity. The need for multilateralism, dialogue and cooperation was now greater than ever before. Now was the time to recapture the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and live up to its highest standards.\n\nThe international community had to ensure respect for civil and political rights as well as for economic, social and cultural rights. There were no first- or second-rate rights. What mattered was making sure that there was no regression from what had been achieved so far, and to work together better to ensure that the most vulnerable and underprivileged also gained access to the world’s resources and riches. Gender equality and full, meaningful and equal participation of women and girls in all segments of societies were fundamental to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. There could be no prosperity and peace without respect for human rights, and the protection of the most vulnerable groups was essential.\n\nALFONSO NSUE MOKUY, Third Vice Prime Minister of Equatorial Guinea, said efforts made by his country’s democratic institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights included the implementation of the obligations deriving from the international treaties to which his country was party, as well as the readiness to cooperate closely with the Human Rights Council and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Equatorial Guinea had achieved results in combatting trafficking in persons and corruption, and the identification of possible arbitrary detentions or illegal arrests, among other areas. A law was adopted through which the death penalty was entirely abolished\n\nIn 2017, Equatorial Guinea had suffered attempts to destabilise it. A resolution adopted by the European Parliament on violence against opposition activists in Equatorial Guinea was based on speculation. There was no evidence that trials were held without proper guarantees, nor that Obama Mifuman died from torture. He had died from medical conditions. Equatorial Guinea attached great importance to strengthening the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, which was the main achievement of the Human Rights Council. It was committed to the international human rights system. It remained open to scrutiny and looked forward to receiving assistance in the promotion of human rights.\n\nJOHAN FORSSELL, Minister for Foreign Trade and for International Development Cooperation of Sweden, said Sweden would continue to support full accountability for the crimes committed as part of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and the reports of the International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine and of the High Commissioner would be important contributions to the international efforts to ensure that there would be no impunity. This year marked the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but the work was far from over. Unless the international community embraced freedom of expression online and offline, free media and the rule of law, it would struggle to find lasting solutions to challenges.\n\nIn the same way: unless gender equality was embraced, there would never be success in building peaceful or prosperous societies. Human rights were - and must be - universal and should be fully enjoyed by all, irrespective of gender, religion, ethnic background, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. In this new era, it was more important than ever that the Human Rights Council stepped up to its role as the global body charged with protecting and promoting international human rights law, by promoting international cooperation and developing the normative framework, but also by addressing the violations and demanding accountability from those responsible.\n\nHALA BINT MAZYAD AL-TUWAIJRI, President of the Human Rights Commission of Saudi Arabia, said the \"Kingdom's Vision 2030\" was a framework for formulating the general policies of a vibrant society, a prosperous economy, and an ambitious homeland, each with several goals and programmes related to the protection and promotion of human rights. As a result of the vision, Saudi Arabia was witnessing major and unprecedented reforms in various fields, including it legislative system. An initiative had been launched with the aim of confronting increasing cyber threats targeting children. The unemployment rate during the period from 2016 to 2022 recorded a significant decrease from 11.6 per cent to 5.8 per cent.\n\nIn recent years, the Kingdom had made great progress in the field of women's empowerment; the share of women in the labour market had increased from 21.2 per cent in 2017 to 34.7 per cent in 2022. The Government had worked to enhance global food security by providing nearly three billion dollars in aid, including assistance to the people of Türkiye and Syria, to mitigate the effects of the devastating earthquake, as well as more than 10 billion dollars to assist the people of Yemen. The Kingdom had shown willingness to mediate in resolving the Russian-Ukrainian crisis, and called on the Afghan Government to reverse their decision to prevent girls from receiving a university education.\n\nQIN GANG, Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, said that China would follow a Chinese path of human rights which met the trend of the times and suited its individual path. The happiness of the 1.4 billion Chinese people was the Government’s priority. To that end, China had ended poverty and put in place the world’s largest education and healthcare systems. Under constitutional principles to respect human rights, China had continuously developed democratic rights. Common values such as peace were advocated for. While the COVID-19 pandemic still lingered and its effects threatened a recession, China proposed that human rights for all was the common pursuit of humanity. However, a one size-fits all model did not exist for human rights. Blindly copying the models of others would be ill-fitting to certain countries and imposing human rights on countries would be equally incorrect.\n\nDouble standards and selectivity would have to be rejected for the Human Rights Council to function. Further, it and the treaty bodies would have to operate within their mandates, the Minister said. Turning to domestic affairs, he said that China was a diverse country with over 50 ethnicities that lived together but some forces with hidden agendas continued to hype issues related to the Xinjiang region and prevent its development. He invited all peoples of the world to come to China and see for themselves. Hong Kong was in a new stage where order was restored and was set to thrive. The one-country-two systems policy would be maintained, and Hong Kong would embrace a bright future.\n\nDOMINIQUE HASLER, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Education and Sport of Liechtenstein, said that one year into the unprecedented war of aggression and the humanitarian crises that had unfolded, the perpetrators of the most serious crimes in Ukraine should be held accountable. Liechtenstein supported the establishment of a tribunal. There should be no impunity for those in leadership positions and comprehensive accountability should be pursued. Liechtenstein continued to stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people through its humanitarian engagement. It would also do its part in terms of reconstruction.\n\nIn Myanmar, since the military coup two years, crimes against humanity were carried out by the regime. In Iran, hundreds of deaths and thousands of arbitrary arrests of protesters had taken place. Russia, Belarus and Afghanistan were only a few more examples of countries where human rights violations were taking place. It was important that the Human Rights Council addressed such situations. It was a common responsibility for States to use the Council to discuss human rights challenges and find common grounds to address them adequately. Reiterating Liechtenstein’s strong support for the human right system, the Minister urged all States to engage to resolve the human right challenges the world was facing.\n\nTHÓRDÍS KOLBRÚN REYKFJÖRD GYLFADÓTTIR, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland, said Russia's war and Ukraine's defence were relevant to the entire world. The invasion struck at the heart of the United Nations Charter and the international rules-based order and was intended to undermine the fundamental human rights that all Members States of the United Nations had undertaken. It was encouraging that a majority of all United Nations Member States had stated their clear opposition to the grave assault on the system. Last week, 141 nations again voted in favour of a resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russia‘s forces from within Ukraine and emphasised the need to hold accountable those who had committed crimes against international law.\n\nIceland remained unwavering in its support and solidarity with Ukraine, and stood with the people of Belarus in their fight for a free and democratic society. In November, the Council took a stand against the injustice which the Islamic Republic of Iran used to stamp out peaceful protests, by establishing a fact-finding mission. Iceland also called on the Taliban to lift the vast restrictions on women.\n\nHuman rights were a fundamental part of Iceland’s foreign policy. Iceland was running for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the term 2025-2027. The critical importance of this Council had never been clearer.\n\nNIKOLAOS-GEORGIOS DENDIAS, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece, said the world was facing a series of unprecedented crises such as long-term effects from the pandemic, climate change, scarcity of goods, food and water, and prolonged conflict that violated international norms. He called on the international community to renew its commitment to its respect of international law and the United Nations Charter, for there could be no peace if human rights were violated. Unfortunately, on 24 February, a year had elapsed since Russia invaded Ukraine. The fate of the Greek community in areas under Russian occupation was of concern. Other conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, Libya and Belarus, amongst others, could not be forgotten.\n\nIn this context, Greece promoted respect for a rules-based multilateralism grounded in international law. Not everything needed to be gloom and doom for several countries were making progress on human rights through working together and building bridges. To that end, Greece had put forward its candidature for the United Nations Security Council for 2025-2026 to promote cultural rights, sports, the Olympic Games, and human rights in neurotechnology. With these priorities in mind, Greece presented its candidature for the Human Rights Council in 2028-2030, which would be its first-ever term.\n\nMEHMET KEMAL BOZAY, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Türkiye, said the Turkish nation mourned its losses following the largest natural disaster of this century; 40,000 lives had been lost and 100,000 people injured. Türkiye expressed deep gratitude for the profound international solidarity received, which reconfirmed that the international community should adopt a “one humanity one world” approach in tackling problems. Türkiye would continue to engage with the Human Rights Council for the protection and promotion of human rights for all, and was committed to Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, including Crimea, and to a just peace.\n\nPushbacks and systemic violations of rights of migrants and refugees continued to cause major concern as well. States should not let desperate human beings die neither in Mediterranean nor at their borders. In Syria, Türkiye was trying to revitalise the political process, enable safe returns, and eliminate terrorist threats. The international community should not allow the situation in Afghanistan to deteriorate further. The establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital, was the only way for a just peace. In Libya, free elections under United Nations’ guidance were key to stability and peace. The situation of the Turkish Cypriot people should be addressed by the Council.\n\nMUZAFFAR KHUSEINZODA, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan, said Tajikistan had adopted several strategic documents in the area of human rights and national action plans to implement the recommendations of the United Nations bodies. Tajikistan valued the important role played by civil society and engaged in collaboration with these institutions. Tajikistan was committed to eliminating stereotypes and discriminatory attitudes towards women and ensuring equal rights between men and women in all spheres. Under the Government’s gender policy, women’s activism in the public sphere was being encouraged. Strengthening women’s political participation and increasing the number of women in public service was a priority of the National Development Strategy for the period up to 2030.\n\nClimate change and addressing its consequences had a profound effect on the enjoyment of human rights for billions of people. Tajikistan was promoting an integrated approach to addressing water and climate issues. At the same time, Tajikistan was dedicated to improving access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Human rights to water and sanitation were essential for eradicating poverty and building peaceful and prosperous societies in which no one was left behind. On 21 March there would be a once-in-a-generation event in New York - the United Nations 2023 Water Conference, which would be crucial for sustainable development. Tajikistan and the Netherlands, leading the preparations as the co-organizers of this global event, were determined to make the Conference a watershed moment for the whole world.\n\nLOUISE MUSHIKIWABO, Secretary-General of the Organization de la Francophonie, said the Organization was comprised of 88 countries across five continents unified by the French language and French values which were at the heart of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Despite difficulties, there were successes: across the Francophone countries, over 95 per cent of States had acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and almost three quarters of Member States had abolished the death penalty - most recently in 2022 for Equatorial Guinea. Improvements could still be made in the health and education sectors, as well as on women’s rights. Failure to fulfil economic and social rights was a risk to democracy and remained an obstacle to development.\n\nTaking stock on this seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Organization de la Francophonie paid particular attention to fighting corruption, fake news and hate speech, and congratulated States on their fight against them. Also, vaccine equity was still of particular concern. Women and girls’ education was the challenge for our era and it was the international community’s responsibility to ensure it. To that end, the Secretary-General hailed the role played by the Human Rights Council for its sincere and demanding dialogue that represented renewed multilateralism.\n\nJAN BEAGLE, Director-General of the International Development Law Organization, said human rights were under tremendous pressure from a combination of overlapping challenges, from the lingering COVID-19 pandemic to increasing conflict, and the effects of climate change. Through its work in some of the world’s poorest and most fragile contexts, the Organization knew all too well the threat that these challenges posed to peace, sustainable development and human rights. Strengthening the mutually reinforcing relationship between human rights and the rule of law was critical. The International Development Law Organization empowered individuals and communities to claim their rights and hold decision makers accountable. It also partnered with justice systems to increase effectiveness, access, and accountability.\n\nOne year into the war in Ukraine, the International Development Law Organization was proud to support national partners, including the Office of the Prosecutor General, to strengthen access to justice and respect for international law. It was also continuing its longstanding work on anti-corruption reform in Ukraine. A genuine commitment to the rule of law, and placing people at the centre through inclusive governance, accountability and equality before the law, would go a long way to resolving many of the factors that contributed to current crises. The biggest challenge, and the true measure of States’ success, would be reaching those whose rights were afforded the least protection, who lived in conditions of the gravest injustice.\n\nRICCARDO PATERNO DI MONTECUPO, Grand Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Sovereign Order of Malta, said the Sovereign Order of Malta remained concerned by the continuous and massive violations of human rights in times of conflict, in particular in the context of the war in Ukraine. At the beginning of the war a year ago, the Sovereign Order of Malta responded and continued to this day to assist civilians in Ukraine and across Europe. Its international and national entities and partners had to this date delivered more than 4,500 tons of humanitarian aid in Ukraine, distributed half-a-million hot meals to internally displaced persons, provided 19,000 beds in shelters, and trained 13,000 people in first aid.\n\nThe work of the Sovereign Order of Malta in 120 countries was an example of the commitment to advance the observance of international humanitarian laws, protecting the disadvantaged and the communities whose fundamental rights had been violated. The Sovereign Order of Malta looked forward to participating in the interactive debate with the new Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief during this session. The delegation would also participate and contribute its expertise on the topic of the rights of children, in the interactive debates on the sale of children, violence against children, children in armed conflicts, and on the right to food.\n\nACHIM STEINER, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, said as the international community marked the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year, it was a moment to reflect on the progress that the global community had made. The Declaration had propelled freedom and development, and had also helped to dismantle structures that perpetuated racial and gender discrimination. Most recently, the global community had come together and recognised the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. And yet, human rights were coming under enormous pressure in this era of polycrises, including shrinking civic spaces and human rights backsliding in many parts of the world.\n\nThere was a need for more concerted efforts to tackle intersectional forms of discrimination and violence, including against girls with disabilities. In 2023, the right to development remained a defining issue. There was a pressing need for financing and debt relief to respond to the development needs of communities now -- without short-changing the future. The international community must also address gaps in technical cooperation. The United Nations Development Programme, in partnership with the United Nations Human Rights Office, was strengthening practical support to countries and was also working with partners to ensure that the business sector fulfilled its human rights obligations.\n\n___________\n\nProduced by the United Nations Information Service in Geneva for use of the media;\n\nnot an official record.
