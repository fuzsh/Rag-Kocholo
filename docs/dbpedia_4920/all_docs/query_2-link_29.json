In that context, they praised the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Ibrahimi the UN LAS special envoy to Syria. With regards to the Syrian coalition, the Ministers recalled the respective positions of the LAS and the EU as expressed in their relevant resolutions.\n\nOutside this framework, any election, presidential or other, conducted in the midst of a conflict and with millions of Syrians displaced from their home is an obstacle to the efforts aiming at a political solution.\n\nThe Ministers called upon the international community to assist the neighboring countries hosting Syrian refugees, among which they pay tribute to the sustained efforts carried out by Iraq and Egypt.
