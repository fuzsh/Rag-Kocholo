        "text": "(A) The following Member States whose currency is the euro: Kingdom of Belgium, Ireland, Kingdom of Spain, French Republic, Italian Republic, Republic of Cyprus, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Republic of Malta, Kingdom of the Netherlands, Republic of Austria, Portuguese Republic, Republic of Slovenia and Republic of Finland, represented by the European Commission (hereinafter referred to as the “Commission”) and KfW acting in the public interest, subject to the instructions of and with the benefit of the guarantee of the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as the “Lenders” and each, a “Lender”);\n\n(2) An Amendment to the Agreement has been signed on 14 June 2011 in accordance with the conclusions of the Heads of State and Government of the Euro Area of 11 March 2011 that, in view of the commitments undertaken by Greece in the context of the adjustment programme, the interest rate on its loan would be adjusted by 100 basis points and the maturity of all loans will be increased to 7.5 years.\n\n(6) The Federal Republic of Germany (“Germany”) has designated KfW as Lender on behalf of Germany for the purposes of the Agreement. Accordingly, references to KfW as Lender refer to KfW acting in the public interest, subject to the instructions of and with the benefit of the guarantee of Germany also for the purposes of this Amendment.\n\n(5) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives all immunity to which it is or may become entitled, in respect of itself or its assets, from legal proceedings in relation to this Amendment, including, without limitation, immunity from suit, judgement or other order, from attachment, arrest or injunction prior to judgement, and from execution and enforcement against its assets to the extent not prohibited by mandatory law.\n\n(a) the Lenders have received the official notification in the form of the Legal Opinion by the Legal Advisor to the State at the Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights and the Legal Advisor to the State at the Ministry of Finance in the form of Annex 1 that this Amendment has been duly executed on behalf of the Borrower and all of the Borrower’s obligations in relation to this Amendment are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and nothing further is required to give effect to the same; and\n\n(d) if one or more Acceptance Notices are issued between the signature of this Amendment by all parties and the entry into force thereof, the Commission shall, upon the entry into force of this Amendment, issue an amended Acceptance Notice which, from its date of issuance by the Commission, shall modify the Scheduled Principal Repayments set out in such Acceptance Notice(s) so that the Grace Period and the Term specified in such Acceptance Notice(s) are as long as allowed under Articles 1(1) and 1(2) of this Amendment; and\n\n(e) the margin foreseen in Article 1(3) of this Amendment shall apply starting from (and including) the Interest Period which ended on 15 June 2011. In relation to all Interest Payment Dates that have occurred or shall occur between 15 June 2011 and the entry into force of this Amendment, the difference between (i) the interest that the Borrower paid on any such Interest Payment Dates and (ii) the interest calculated by applying the margin as specified in Article 1(3) of this Amendment, shall be compensated to the Borrower through an equivalent reduction of the interest due on the next Interest Payment Date, provided that this Amendment enters into force at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to it. If this Amendment enters into force less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to an Interest Payment Date, the reduction shall occur on the following Interest Payment Date. If the amount of the reduction exceeds the interest due on a single Interest Payment Date, the remaining part shall be compensated on the subsequent Interest Payment Date. The Commission shall advise the Lenders, the Borrower and the Borrower’s Agent about the reduction.\n\nThis Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts signed by one or more of the parties. The counterparts each form an integral part of the original Amendment and the signature of the counterparts shall have the same effect as if the signatures on the counterparts were on a single copy of the Amendment.\n\nIn our capacity as the Legal Advisor to the State at the Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights and the Legal Advisor to the State at the Ministry of Finance, we refer to the above referenced Amendment and its Annexes which constitute an integral part thereof (hereinafter together referred to as the “Amendment”) entered into between, amongs others, certain Euro Area Member States and KfW (hereinafter referred to as the “Lenders”) and the Hellenic Republic (hereinafter referred to as the “Borrower”) on [●] 2012.\n\nWe have examined originals of the Amendment. We have also examined the relevant provisions of national and international law applicable to the Borrower and the Borrower’s Agent, the powers of signatories and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate. Furthermore, we have made such other investigations and reviewed such matters of law as we have considered relevant to the opinion expressed herein.\n\nWe have assumed (i) the genuineness of all signatures (except the Borrower and the Borrower’s Agent) and the conformity of all copies to originals, (ii) the capacity and power to enter into the Amendment of, and their valid authorisation and signing by, each party other than the Borrower and the Borrower’s Agent and (iii) the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the Amendment on each party under the laws of England.\n\n14. In conclusion, the Amendment has been duly executed on behalf of the Borrower and all the Borrower’s obligations in relation to the Amendment and the Loan Facility Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and nothing further is required to give effect to the same."
