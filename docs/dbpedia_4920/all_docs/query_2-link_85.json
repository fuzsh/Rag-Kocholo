        "text": "PASOK-Movement for Change (KINAL) leader Nikos Androulakis interprets the result of the May 21 election, which gave the conservatives a 20-percentage point lead over the main opposition, as a failure of SYRIZA and categorically dismisses any possibility of cooperation with New Democracy, even if the latter does not secure an outright majority. The president of PASOK talks about the present and the past of his party and about his plan to restore it as the main political opponent of the conservatives.\n\nI would like, first of all, to hear your assessment of the May 21 election result.\n\nThis result is a product of fear of an even worse outcome and not of the service that New Democracy offered the Greek people. In the last four years, the country’s fiscal position has worsened, inequalities have increased, the welfare state – and I’m talking more about health and education – is in a worse position, while there were opportunities available through the EU Recovery Fund to reform the National Health System. Furthermore, we saw very big corruption scandals, such as the case of [former New Democracy MP Andreas] Patsis, the wiretaps – and subsequently the cover-up of these scandals. So, after all this we expected a drop and not a rise in the percentages of ND. That is why I consider SYRIZA to be the “golden sponsor” of the result of the May 21 election.\n\nNow, you have insisted very much that even if Kyriakos Mitsotakis secures 149 seats in Parliament in the June 25 election, you would never accept him as prime minister in a possible coalition. But he has an electoral result from May that undoubtedly makes him the dominant player, so to speak. Does that change your mind?\n\nWe had said about the system of proportional representation, which requires a culture of consensus to work, that we are ready to do it. This was about the system of proportional representation, which also exists in other European states. This consensus has to do with achieving convergences through our programs. That is when I raised the issue of the two leaders [Mitsotakis and SYRIZA leader Alexis Tsipras], because I believe that both have made mistakes for which the Greek people have paid dearly. I don’t see that they have changed their brand of politics. They keep making the same mistakes in an unrepentant way. So, if we had had a result on the first Sunday [May 21 election] that called for a coalition government, we would have discussed convergences without these people as prime minister, because the current system is focused on the premier and if the prime minister cannot serve a collective vision, this system, too, will fail.\n\nBut now we have another electoral system [that will apply in the June 25 vote] and an existing result from the previous election. We are not talking today about opinion polls, but about the recorded popular verdict. Based on the new system, New Democracy would have secured 172 seats with the percentage it achieved in the previous election. So the danger now is not the instability, but the omnipotence of the Mitsotakis system. That is, if it rises a little bit, it could reach 180 seats. We believe that this should not happen, because a Mitsotakis omnipotence will translate into abuse of power. And I speak based on past experience. Now, if there is an unexpected result and Mitsotakis does not secure an outright majority, he has proven that he can work perfectly with the far-right, considering he cooperates in his party with Mr [former interior minister Makis] Voridis, Mr [former health minister Thanos] Plevris, Mr [former development minister Adonis] Georgiadis, recently with Mr [former right-wing, populist LAOS leader Giorgos] Karatzaferis, with Mr [New Right leader] Failos Kranidiotis. So why not work with the right and far-right parties?\n\nNow that time has passed, could you tell us who you had in mind for prime minister?\n\n‘The result [of the May 21 election] is a product of fear of an even worse outcome and not of the service that New Democracy offered the Greek people’\n\nCoalition governments, as I said before, presuppose programmatic convergences. These convergences are the ones that would define those in charge as well. There are important Greeks with experience – and I am talking about the political life of the country, I did not imply something else as some have tried to suggest – who could express such convergences.\n\nI am saying this because it is important, in the sense that someone can judge you by this, by who you would like as prime minister.\n\nI think this discussion today is pointless. New Democracy secured a large percentage that does not allow any such discussion to open. Nobody expected this result, not even us. We are fighting for our party to do well, and it did do well, but we expected New Democracy to have a much lower percentage.\n\nI remember you saying for some time that even if Mitsotakis were to call you, you wouldn’t meet with him. What happens if he wins on June 25 and calls you?\n\nI never said I wouldn’t meet him. I said that he has never invited me to talk about some national or other important matter. No official invitation has ever reached my office. Whatever happened happened in the forecourt of Parliament. I do not think that was institutionally sound on Mr Mitsotakis’ part. Had he wanted to meet me about some important matter like Greek-Turkish relations or the pandemic, I obviously would not have refused, as I would not have refused any other political leader. But Mr Mitsotakis sought to instrumentalize even this. Just like he’s telling the Greek people now, “Vote for me or I’ll ruin your August holidays,” so he previously said, “Vote for me because Mr Androulakis is rude and wouldn’t meet with me.” These are childish arguments. Let’s talk about the real issues, and the real issues are the fiscal situation, national matters and the country’s position in Europe, a discussion I do not think is in Mr Mitsotakis’ interest because the country is not on the path that the experience of the memorandums dictates, and both he and Mr Tsipras remain unrepentant: an old-school establishment mentality, a lack of meritocracy, corruption. It is wrong that we should be experiencing the phenomena that led to the memorandums today, at the risk of new adventures.\n\nWhat I’m saying is that, hypothetically speaking, Mitsotakis acts in a different way and calls you after the election asking for consensus on certain issues like a review of the Constitution and of Article 16. Would you consider giving him such support?\n\nThe discussion about the Constitution is serious and needs to be carried out by all the parties. Our position on education, vis-a-vis the Constitution, is that we will not stand in the way of private universities. That said, our priority is to strengthen public universities, public education, and I have even submitted a proposal for a national diploma so that the onus shifts from private cramming schools to public education. We would need to agree on the makeup of the university map – public and private – on some common criteria, on what a private university should look like. Is it a campus, does it promote research, or is New Democracy’s vision about filling a few buildings in downtown Athens with businesses that peddle degrees?\n\nWe already have businesses like that.\n\nThat’s what I mean by criteria. If we’re talking about a private university that is non-state and non-profit like the big universities of Europe and the United States, then we’re on board, as long as it meets certain high academic standards.\n\nCharting a course for the party\n\nThere are critics who say that PASOK could do better. There are influential former officials like Evangelos Venizelos, Anna Diamantopoulou and Yiannis Maniatis who have contributed to the party and the country. Why doesn’t the party invite them back?\n\nThose who wanted to come back attended the party congress. Those who want to contribute – and some of the people you mentioned do so every day – are close. Others are not because they believe that PASOK should be charting a different course. But PASOK is charting a course that is independent of both SYRIZA and New Democracy. My priority is a party that the country’s progressive community can call its democratic home… We’re holding onto what’s positive in the party’s history and vow that, in this new era, the things that harmed the Greek people will not be repeated.\n\nDo you ever consult with former PASOK heads like Kostas Simitis or Evangelos Venizelos?\n\nI speak with all the former presidents and with many officials who are experienced, like Yiannis Maniatis in energy matters. They managed some very difficult situations during crucial periods for the country and have a lot of experience, which is useful, just as modernization is. This is why we consistently try to promote young people and to strengthen this trend. And I am very hopeful, because our parliamentary group embodies PASOK’s new reality.\n\nAre there any specific SYRIZA officials you would like to have in PASOK?\n\nThere are some very good people in the Left, obviously, which is why I think that a part of the Left needs to stop being held hostage by SYRIZA’s leadership. I don’t think Mr Tsipras’ move with Golden Dawn did them a service, the fact that he did not support the legal amendment for blocking this neo-Nazi formation, the murderers of Pavlos Fyssas, from running in the elections and then went on to issue an invitation for support to those who ostensibly “strayed” to Golden Dawn, as if they don’t know who killed Fyssas and committed crimes against migrants. I believe that there is a progressive world in the Left that has a pro-European view and can respond to our call for a strong democratic bulwark against New Democracy’s conservatism.\n\nI’m assuming that your immediate aim is to secure the position of main opposition. How long do you think that will take?\n\nOur aim is to take an even bigger step. The strategic goal is as you say, and in the future we envisage a political system comprising conservative and progressive parties, with the latter being expressed by PASOK and the forces of the modern center-left. I do want to say that if the Greek people do not further empower this reliable progressive force we want to become and we go back to the same, the next four years can be considered lost as well. Going back to the same means an ineffective opposition and a ruthless, omnipotent New Democracy. A strong PASOK can stand in the way of this mechanism of fear and create the conditions for an alternative prospect, so that New Democracy feels that it has a real rival.\n\nMitsotakis has described you as “Tsipras with a tie.” How do you respond?\n\nThat is the least Mr Mitsotakis has said about us. And this coming from the prime minister who assaulted the independent authorities, handed out 10 billion euros in direct contract concessions and was the champion of favorable public administration transfers, who increased the debt by 50 billion euros, while the trade deficit rose to 2010 levels. I have a European mentality, defending transparency and meritocracy. Having Mr Mitsotakis lecture me is too much and I won’t tolerate it. Not personally and not for the party.\n\nLet’s talk about the wiretaps – a serious institutional failure, to say the least. What I wonder is how far you will go with this affair.\n\nI have already taken recourse to the Greek and European courts. The [EU’s] PEGA committee [on illegal surveillance spyware] published its final decision last Thursday and it was very damning for the government. This story is not over. I understand that people have other priorities, but it is a global scandal, because Mr Mitsotakis and people in his circle used the “nuclear weapons” of surveillance against their political rivals and other individuals. This is why Greek and European justice need to do their jobs thoroughly. We are a country at the core of the European Union and we won’t allow anyone to turn us into Hungary. The issue is not personal. It is about democracy and respect for human rights and the state of law. We will fight to the end to make sure that people who exposed the country internationally and toyed with the quality of our democracy pay.\n\nDo you feel that something has also changed at an institutional level in the attitude of the relevant services?\n\nI couldn’t say. I have no evidence of this. Time will tell. But there is another thing that really bothers me personally and that is the discussion that began just a few days before the elections about the Muslim minority in Thrace. It’s complete exploitation. If Mr Mitsotakis has any evidence [of Turkish meddling in the elections], let him come forward with it instead of making innuendoes. It is a huge national issue, and PASOK has done a lot for Thrace. Andreas Papandreou took down the barriers in 1995. Kostas Simitis and Giorgos Papandreou passed the law that allowed thousands of Greek Muslims into Greek universities, so that within 20 years, the number of Greek Muslim university graduates in Rodopi and Xanthi increased fivefold. These are major reforms that unite the Greek people, that abolish discrimination, that curb foreign influence and that make Thrace stronger.\n\nMrs [Dora] Bakoyannis’ statements [during a recent visit to the northeastern Greek region] reminded me of the 1950s and 60s. How profoundly conservative to say, “Vote for us, or else…” Such things should not be tolerated in a normal European democracy. As far as SYRIZA is concerned, it has to answer why it didn’t ratify the law on the election of the mufti. As for the specific matter, the only thing I have to say is that the party’s official should issue a statement clarifying that the Treaty of Lausanne is not being questioned. There can be no Greek MP, Christian or Muslim, in my opinion, who questions the treaty that has formed an environment of peace and stability in the Southeastern Mediterranean for the past hundred years.\n\nWe all change as people. How have you changed since you were elected party president?\n\nAs you say, we all change; we are changed by the circumstances. But I try to remain steadfast in my principles and values. I try not to get irritated by the things that have bothered me, like the matter of the phone taps. I never expected, with everything I have done to forward national matters in the European Parliament, to be targeted by the secret services of my own country. When I first heard about Predator [the software], I had not appreciated the scope of the problem. But when I found out that EYP [the National Intelligence Service] was surveilling me at the most crucial period, when I was running for PASOK president, I was crushed. This experience strengthened my belief that the Greek people do not deserve leaders who are capable only of holding onto their seat.\n\nOn the issue of migration, do you believe, from what we know so far, that the tragedy off the coast of the Peloponnese could have been avoided? Is there a way to prevent such shipwrecks in the future?\n\nIt’s an unimaginable tragedy. So many people drowned, trapped by slavers in the hold. It is my opinion that the interim government and the relevant ministers ought to publish all the evidence of what actions were taken by the emergency services to dispel any shadow of doubt. The struggle for a better life is being exploited by gangs for gain. It is telling that their profits in 2016 represented 60% of Libya’s gross domestic product. And it is also not surprising that most of these “floating coffins” set off from the coast of the destabilized North African country.\n\nIt is essential that we try create islands of stability in the African continent that can receive refugees and economic migrants from neighboring countries. The European Union must also demonstrate solidarity at the practical level. It is impossible for the countries on the EU’s borders to shoulder the entire burden. We need proportional sharing both in hosting asylum seekers and in every other facet of the issue."
