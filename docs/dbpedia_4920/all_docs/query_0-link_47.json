Recent data shows adolescent mental health has worsened during and since the pandemic and this reinforces the important role schools play in promoting mental health and well-being (CDC, 2023). Children, youth, and teens face an increase in anxiety and insecurity which may be attributed to issues such as social media dependency, exposure to world-wide violence, and upticks in bullying. Schools and school counselors increasingly need to identify and respond to student social/emotional development and mental health issues. Students in International and DoD school may be seeking a place to belong as oftentimes their families move frequently. For children and youth, mental health also includes reaching developmental and emotional milestones, and acquiring learning skills to cope with challenges and function well at home, school, and in their communities. Mental health is a component of behavioral health, which also includes choices or actions that affect overall wellness. Social-emotional learning (SEL), as a component of comprehensive school counseling programs, include universal interventions for every student to help them process their experience, promote resilience to adversity and help our students and families’ cope. This session also will incorporate transformative social and emotional learning which focuses specifically on advancing equity among all students and addressing inequity (e.g., how issues of race, class, and culture influence society). Building a successful SEL program involves engaging administrators, teachers, and school staff in a collaborative developmental process and can become a key asset in the mental health climate and culture in your school community.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nParticipants will:\n\n● Examine current challenges to students’ feeling safe and secure in our schools.\n\n● Explore how social/emotional learning contributes to a positive learning environment.\n\n● Recognize factors in the school environment, school climate, and school culture that influence and impact students’ success.\n\n● Identify the steps necessary to incorporate social/emotional learning as an integral component of the comprehensive school counseling program.\n\n● Problem solve your school’s needs through discussion of case studies.\n\n● Exploring the link between SEL and sexual violence prevention.\n\nPritha Mani\n\nTitle: It’s On US! Sexual Violence Prevention\n\nSession 2\n\n11:10-13:00 (11:10-13:10pm)\n\nSession description:\n\nSexual violence as defined by WHO refers to “any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to home and work” (WHO, 2021). Violence against women and children permeates all societies and crosses boundaries of race, religion, and cultures. The effects of sexual violence are extensive and long lasting impacting the whole community. An individual’s psychological/socio-emotional and their academic performance do not exist in isolation from each other and cannot be treated as such. The rise in sexual violence in schools is very worrisome indeed and needs to be viewed as an epidemic that necessitates immediate action. This workshop aims to address the urgent need for effective prevention strategies and interventions to combat sexual violence in educational settings. It will provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of sexual violence in schools and its impact on a students’ physical, psychological and emotional well-being. Participants learning, will equip students with the skills needed to help peers who may be survivors of sexual violence and promote an environment that is safe and supportive.\n\nIn addition, this session will provide counsellors with practical guidance on how to respond to the disclosure of sexual violence, ensuring that they are aware of legal procedures and pathways to help survivors navigate their traumatic experience.\n\nFinally, the session will emphasise the importance of a collaborative approach when addressing sexual violence which have proven to be successful when there is a collaborative and repetitive effort from all stakeholders including: school counsellors, directors, principals, school staff and teachers in order to create effective policies and procedures that address prevention and support services.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n● Recognize the signs and symptoms of sexual violence.\n\n● Evaluate personal biases and assumptions related to sexual violence prevention.\n\n● Examine evidence based strategies and interventions for preventing sexual violence in school settings; tailored to the needs of students.\n\n● Identify steps in providing a supportive, trauma-informed response to a disclosure of sexual violence.\n\n● Explore the importance of collaborating with other disciplines, such as psychiatrists social workers, educators, lawyers, doctors in addressing sexual violence.\n\n● Exploring the link between SEL and sexual violence prevention.\n\nSession 3\n\nMakerSpace 14:15-15:15 (2 workshops)\n\nSelf-care (combined) 15:15-15:45\n\nParticipants will choose one of two MakerSpace workshops:\n\nBuilding a SEL K-12 School Counseling Curriculum/Program Tool Kit\n\nSupporting Survivors of Sexual Violence: Creating a Tool Kit\n\nParticipants in both groups will come together for the last half hour to create a self-care box to support emotional regulation.\n\nDay 2\n\nAlessandra Sax-Lane & Dr. Mari Janikian\n\nTitle: It’s All Greek to Me\n\nAre you interested in working overseas as a counselor or counselor educator? Specifically, in Greece? We would love to share our experiences and share our journeys with you. The idea of counseling, psychotherapy, and the helping professions can differ based on what country you are considering. Everyone’s journey is different and we would like to share both of ours in hopes that it offers some clarity to navigating establishing yourself in private practice, schools as a counselor, or as a faculty member in Greece. If you have already begun the process in order to work overseas, great! Bring your questions, documents, and most importantly your vision for what that will look like for you!\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nTo understand the Greek definitions of what a counselor is (and isn’t!) and who gets to call themselves a counselor.\n\nGreek law, standards, and limitations to what a person can do with an American or otherwise “out of the country” license to practice.\n\nTo learn how “community mental health counselors\n\nTo support you on your journey to learning our experiences and help get you started with where to begin.\n\nLillian Nave & Jill Weidknecht Van Horne\n\nTitle: Modernizing University Counseling Clinics: Updates, Lessons, and Best Practices through a Global Pandemic\n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:\n\n● Identify 3 components of UDL.\n\n● Explain that valuing reflection comes from a culturally integrated (as opposed to individuated) perspective.\n\n● Choose interventions in their teaching practice to provide students with multiple means of engagement through self-assessment and reflection.\n\nRachael Marshall & Michael Levine\n\nTitle: Modernizing University Counseling Clinics: Updates, Lessons, and Best Practices through a Global Pandemic\n\nIt has been four years since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The developments spurred by the Global pandemic have increased the need for access to mental health services. As university clinics transitioned to telemental health, this created new obstacles for training and services, however it allowed for new accessible avenues for clients to get healthcare services. Master’s-level students provide services at university clinics, which are offered to the students and the local community at a significantly reduced cost. Presenters will introduce their work from The Center for Counseling and Diagnostic Services (CCDS) Clinic, which offers three distinct services: counseling, psychoeducational assessments, and reading intervention (Ortiz & Levine, 2021). The functional nature of this clinic dedicates time and resources to collaboration across multiple helping professions, including school psychology, counseling, and language and literacy. Participants in this Counseling MakersSpace can work with multiple helpers on how their clinic can transition to telemental health, maintain safety, and continue to transition with community needs. Presenters will provide updates, lessons learned, and ethical considerations for best practice, explicitly addressing client, counselor-in-training, and supervisor experiences through program evaluation. Participants can attend at any level of interest or creation. Presenters will collaborate to personalize and develop a plan for starting, establishing, and updating clinics through the current health, safety, and security developments. The overarching goal is to increase access and decrease barriers to mental health, training, funding and education.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nBy the end of the workshop participants will:\n\n● Understand clinic expansion and examples and apply them to their current clinic development.\n\n● Analyze their clinic development with accessibility standards, ethical practice, and cultural relevance.\n\n● Create an implementation plan for their next steps in clinic development, including client experiences, counselor-in-training supervision, supervisor support, marketing, community immersion, funding, and program evaluation.\n\nDr. Juliana Deans\n\nTitle: Secondary Trauma and Self-Care During War Times\n\nDuring war times, it is understandable that anxiety and trauma would arise. It is these times, it is imperative we utilize self-care to help deal with the crisis of war. Practicing self-care is a valuable way to maintain personal well-being amid challenging circumstances. This training will identify five ways to help cope during times of war.\n\nBy the end of the training, attendees will learn that self-care includes:\n\n● Maintaining mental well-being\n\n● Preserving physical health\n\n● Having safety and security measures in place\n\n● Seeking emotional support\n\n● Engaging in community\n\nWhen: Tuesday May 28, 2024 |18:30-22:00\n\nWhere: ACG Events Hall, The American College of Greece\n\nAbout the event\n\nJoin us for an insightful discussion aimed at shedding light on the dynamic realm of cybersecurity.

The metaphysical dimension of geometry, mathematics, quantum physics or astrophysics is rendered through abstract forms, symmetrical and assymetrical systems, diagrams, drawings, gestures as well as through the use of photographic cameras and photocopiers, motors, dimmers, LEDs and other electrical components. As most of them were made between the 1950s and the 1970s, they also bear witness to the transition from geometric abstraction and kinetic art to using computational intelligence as an artistic medium. Gérard Haas’s handmade electronic masks incorporate the contradictions created as a result of this transition, also present in Edward Meeneley’s electrostatic prints and Liliane Lijn’s kinetic model of the universe.\n\nDora Iliopoulou-Rogan has noted about Haas’ work that he transforms “cold mechanical computer programs into pulsating, vibrant, imaginative combinations with a poetic zest”. However, he himself saw his practice more as the result of his realizing that the materials he used were “neither cold, nor insensible, nor neutral” but bore a mystical relationship with the human species, which could not be exhausted in their utilitarian value. Traces of the same contradiction can be found in the excerpt of a television interview by the composer and musician Lena Platonos, also figuring among the exhibits. In this interview, given almost a decade after adopting digital sound in her work, Platonos refers to this transition as something that came to her, in her own words, “as naturally as the air I breathe”. The exhibition focuses on these processes and transitions, inextricably linked to technology’s very nature, and highlights new materialities and crafts as well as new ways of encoding that address the machine’s interaction with the most basic human needs.\n\nΟn display are also new commissions as well as other artworks brought in specifically for the exhibition, two of which are actively engaged in conversation with the ACG Collection, as co-curatorial proposals. Natalia Manta retrieves from the collection the old ‘technology’ of the tools used by artists Michael Lekakis and Frances Rich, in order to process their archetypal power through a display-work reminiscent of a pseudo-self-powered oscilloscope system. HYPERCOMF, for their part, make a targeted selection of Haas’s shamanic masks. Τhese masks are placed in conversation with the faceless machines of HYPERCOMF’s embroidery produced on a jacquard loom, which formed the basis for the first programmable machines, and, by extension, today’s computer.\n\nGiven the temporal and conceptual distance separating us from the dawn of art’s relationship with technology, contemporary artworks approach—more or less amateurishly—various artificial intelligence programs as interlocutors, testing their limits, highlighting their failures and their uncanniness at a time when the imposition of computer simulation displaces the epistemology of the laboratory experiment. A universal archive of family photographs emerges distorted through Maria Mavropoulou’s quest for childhood memories, while a deliberately wrong instruction in the case of John Smith’s work highlights the Dadaist dimension of an automatic translation software. The images resulting from an amalgam of insect exoskeletons and robotic prosthetics in the work of Marios Stamatis interact with Emre Hüner’s amorphous hybrid materials, mixtures of organic and industrial fragments. The AI ​​images of portals resembling black holes acquire substance in the work of Afroditi Psarras, echoing the transition from the intangible to the material in the painting by Miltos Manetas depicting the post-internet era. Yorgia Karidi, for her part, transports us to a limbo-like situation, a bit before or a little after the end of the world. Τhe arrogance of the machine towards man and nature as well as the inability of Al programs to assume a political stance are the respective locus of concern of ACG students Vaggi Sekifu and Elen Demiryan, also participating in the exhibition.\n\nThe exhibition borrows the display cases of the College’s library to showcase archival material from the ACG collection relating to the artists and works on show; as well as some new works, such as texts by Georges Perec or even drafts from the collaboration of ceramist Panos Valsamakis with the Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation (OTE) for the decoration of a central Athens branch facade in the 60s, a unique case of employing one of the world’s most ancient techniques in order to give material substance to the intangibility of telecommunication technology.\n\nAs its title —borrowed from a note appearing in Michael Lekakis’s work—suggests, the exhibition showcases the scientifico-poetic observation of the cosmos by the artists. Taking the ever-changing nature of the world’s substance as their only constant, the artworks mirror its paradoxical texture that, much like the natural phenomenon of dew, evokes an otherworldly feeling.\n\nParticipating artists: Dimitrios Antonitsis, Irene Baimas-Kiamos, Yannis Bouteas, Katharine T.

In the exhibition The Musicality of Sculpture, she invites viewers to experience an exploration of the past as well as the feminine body in motion. A sensation of movement courses through the artist’s creative universe, defining her artistic practice. With references to music and dance, she alludes to a subconscious human desire to relive the past through mythology and release long-held memories and emotions. The vivid aesthetic language and visual rhythm of her work gestures compellingly to its surroundings, producing a sense of pleasure and equilibrium.\n\nSpanning more than five decades of artistic production, the exhibition traces the evolution of the artist’s continuous experimentation with form, shape, and style through the mediums of drawing and sculpture. Musical Rays (1992), inspired by musical scores and instruments, is the centerpiece of the exhibition. Responding to musical abstraction through a three-dimensional object, the work reflects a continuum of juxtaposed shapes, producing an interplay of light and shadows. The artist will also present a new body of sculptural work that delves deeper into geometric abstraction, including Reverse (2023), which harmoniously combines favorite materials with distinctly different qualities for the first time: white marble, African wood, and plexiglas.\n\nThe exhibition features twenty pieces from “Triforms,” a series of sculptures Politopoulou-Kargsten started producing in 1980. Now considered her most important work, it encapsulates her contribution to contemporary sculpture. Juxtaposing three successive carved layers of either marble, wood, or plexiglas, these works place the focus on a female body in constant flux, swaying to the rhythm of an imaginary musical composition. Complex shapes and mysterious cuts into the cores of the sculptures create both positive and negative spaces in each of the works. Maneuvering through the passage of light, the forms also recall minimalistic representations of musical instruments. Kimon Friar noted the recurring triad trope in Politopoulou-Kargsten’s work, which added a metaphysical element to her practice invoking a triad chord or a Bach fugue.\n\nThe exhibition also presents early works on paper, fabric, and wood as well as sculptures, including Motherhood (1958) and The Three Graces (1958), sculptures reminiscent of Cycladic idols; Kore (1961), a statuette in gilded plaster; and the series “Metamorphoses” (1989), in which the artist revisits the face of the Kore, invoking questions of identity and the ever-changing human condition. The three works included in the series “Study of Models” (1967) are early attempts to explore the imprints bodies leave behind in the physical spaces they occupy temporarily.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1992, the artist’s preoccupation with representations of the female body became more prominent in her work. Inspired by the Venus of Willendorf (25,000 BC), she created a series of female figurines with steatopygous features starting in 1968. On display in the exhibition are the works Aphrodites (1971), Female Figure (1972), and Erotic (1973), all depicting females whose abundant abdomens and thighs elevate them to archetypal symbols of fertility.\n\nThe Musicality of Sculpture features artworks from the collections of the National Gallery of Greece-Alexandros Soutsos Museum, Vorres Museum, and The American College of Greece, as well as the artist’s own personal archive. Oscillating between realism and abstraction, the artworks in the exhibition together challenge the normativity of form and unite the sensibilities of classical Greece with late European Modernism.\n\nThe exhibition is accompanied by the catalogue “Athena Politopoulou- Kargsten : The Musicality of Sculpture” published by The American College of Greece, edited by Dr. Megakles Rogakos.\n\nBio\n\nAthena Politopoulou-Kargsten (born 1938, Volos, Greece) lives and works between Athens, Patmos, and Stockholm. She graduated from Pierce College in 1957 and received a scholarship to study at Cottey College in Nevada, Missouri (1957-58) and Milwaukee-Downer College in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (1958-60). After completing her studies, she married Swedish pediatrician Sven-Olof Kargsten and moved to Stockholm, where she studied at the Konstfack–University of Arts, Crafts, and Design (1961-72) and the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts (1972-74). Parallel to her artistic activity, she collaborated with the philhellene professor Sture Linnér to promote Greek culture in Sweden. In 1998, the Society of the Friends of the Swedish Institute at Athens honored Politopoulou-Kargsten with a prize for her work. In 2011, The American College of Greece commissioned her to design the ACG Alumni Award–Maria West, awarded to outstanding alumni for their contributions to culture. Solo exhibitions have been presented at Galerie Zygos, Athens (1984); Galerie 17, Stockholm (1986); Galerie Regio Genevensis, Carouge, Geneva (1987); Banque Suisse de Credits et Dépôts, Geneva (1987); Pandora Mansion, Makrinitsa, Pelion and Giorgio de Chirico Art Center, Volos (1993).

Participants will gain insights into the possibilities of computer science-based research methods in the Digital Humanities, explore digital practices and methods that are becoming more widespread in the social sciences and humanities, and gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques.\n\nThe bootcamp aims to enhance the teaching skills of staff, foster collaborations across disciplines, and lead to projects that extend beyond the classroom and make a public impact. By showing the value of the study of Humanities and the potential of digital projects to engage and inform the wider public, the program seeks to contribute to the development of innovative research and teaching practices. The emergence of new methods and tools that allow us to gain and compute more knowledge integrating various data sources is challenging traditional research in the social sciences and humanities. At the same time, our human experiences and our ways of learning and knowing are increasingly mediated by technology. The Digital Humanities boot camp promises to offer participants the opportunity to grapple with these challenges and explore the theoretical bases and implications of digital research methods.\n\nThis will be the first Digital Humanities bootcamp aimed at permanent and non-permanent University faculty members in Greece. Training teaching staff in Digital Humanities is crucial for fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and encouraging innovative research and teaching practices. By attending the boot camp, teaching/research staff will be able to enhance their knowledge of digital research methods, gain practical experience with tools and techniques, and explore the potential of digital projects to engage and inform the wider public. This knowledge and experience can be applied in the classroom, leading to enhanced teaching, and learning outcomes for students.\n\nMoreover, training teaching staff in Digital Humanities can lead to the development of interdisciplinary collaborations across departments and faculties. These collaborations can lead to the creation of new research projects and teaching programs that extend beyond the traditional boundaries of individual disciplines. Overall, training teaching staff in Digital Humanities is an essential step in fostering innovation and advancing research and teaching practices. The Digital Humanities boot camp offered by The American College of Greece is an excellent opportunity for teaching staff to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to engage with Digital Humanities and contribute to the development of innovative research and teaching practices.\n\nPROGRAM\n\nDay 1 | Monday, September 4, 2023\n\n09:00 – 09:45 Registration\n\n09:45 – 10:00 Welcome remarks\n\nPanos Vlachopoulos\n\nVice President for Academic Affairs, Deree – The American College of Greece\n\nHelena Maragou\n\nDean, School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Deree – The American College of Greece\n\nEirini Karamouzi\n\nAssociate Professor of Contemporary History, Deree – The American College of Greece/University of Sheffield\n\n10:00 – 14:30\n\nMáirín MacCarron\n\nSenior Lecturer in Digital Humanities/Medieval History, University College Cork\n\n10:00-11:30 | Masterclass Lecture: Humanities Data, and Data Analysis in the Humanities\n\n11:30-12:00 | Coffee Break\n\n12:00-14:30 | Seminar: Network science and social network analysis\n\nDay 2 | Tuesday, September 5, 2023\n\nKalliopi Zervanou\n\nAssistant Professor, Leiden University\n\n10:00-11:30 | Masterclass Lecture: Text Mining for Digital Humanities\n\n11:30-12:00 | Coffee Break\n\n12:00-14:30 | Seminar: Text Mining for Digital Humanities\n\nDay 3 | Wednesday, September 6, 2023\n\nKalliopi Zervanou\n\nAssistant Professor, Leiden University\n\n10:00-11:30 | Masterclass Lecture: Metadata standards, ontologies and linked data\n\n11:30-12:00 | Coffee Break\n\n12:00-14:30 |Seminar: Metadata standards, ontologies and linked data\n\nDay 4 | Thursday, September 7, 2023\n\nThomas Smits\n\nPostdoc History, University of Antwerp, Belgium\n\n10:00-12:00 | Masterclass Lecture (online): Multimodal machine learning in Digital Humanities\n\n12:00-12:30 | Coffee Break\n\nIgnacio Aguilo\n\nSenior Lecturer in Latin American Cultural Studies | Co-Director of the Centre for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, The University of Manchester\n\n12:30-14:30 Seminar: Race, Decolonisation and Digital Humanities: A Latin American Indigenous Perspective\n\nSpeakers’ Bios\n\nIgnacio Aguiló is a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Latin American Cultural Studies and the Co-Director of the Centre for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at the University of Manchester.
