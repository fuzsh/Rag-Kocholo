        "text": "Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos pays an official visit to Skopje at the invitation of his opposite number Aleksandar Dimitrov. The two ministers discuss the whole range of relations between the two countries. These talks reveal an identity of position on all points, except for that of the prominence given by the media in FYROM to the so-called violation of the rights of the Slav-speakers living in Greece, and the refusal of the government to advise the state television channel to refrain from poisoning relations between the two countries by its screening of dubious films.\n\nThe following quotations are taken from the joint press conference given by the two Foreign Ministers to the local and international media, as reported by the Macedonian News Agency, \"Eleftherotypia\" newspaper, and others.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview Foreign Minister Dimitrov expressed his great satisfaction with the wide-ranging and open exchange of views between Mr Pangalos and the entire leadership of FYROM since, as he said, \"we saw that relations between the two countries are improving, that it is in the interest of both countries to make proposals for the further improvement of our friendly relations and for multifaceted collaboration in all fields, and especially in the economic sector, defence, increased investment, culture, transport and communications and matters of mutual interest\".\n\n\"The new government\", Mr Dimitrov said, \"is steadfastly oriented towards making a greater contribution to the development of relations with all neighbouring states, and we do not lose sight of the fact that Greece is a member of the European Union. Our unchanging strategic interests lie in this countrys integration into Europe, into a united Europe, and into the North Atlantic structures\" said Mr Dimitrov, adding that \"we are aware that there are problems and differences between the two countries. In the future we see a more complete development of the relations between us, and we have discussed specific regional situations, the stabilisation of peace, security in this region, development. I would like to express my satisfaction with the possibility of open, frank and cordial discussions between our two countries\".\n\nAfter this Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos told the journalists that in his talks with FYROM Premier Ljubco Georgievski \"we discussed all the issues \".\n\n\"The Prime Minister assured me that new government sees Greece as a strategic ally, and that initiatives must be taken in the fields of transport, communications and energy that will change the shape of this region\". Mr Pangalos stressed that \"our goal is, and we discussed this, to create between Skopje and Thessaloniki a pole of development that will enhance the entire region and will be a new field for productive relations\".\n\n\"I am persuaded\", continued Mr Pangalos, \"that they want to work with us. We also discussed matters that have from time to time occupied the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One of these is the name issue, and I said that the Interim Agreement calls for a mutually acceptable solution. This name cannot be the initial position of either of the two sides. We must continue our talks at the United Nations and bring them to a conclusion as soon as possible. The name issue is for us not the principle aspect, but in the future it could lead to a political problem.\" Continuing, the Greek Minister said that \"Greece supports Skopjes European prospects, supports the countrys democratic and peaceful development\".\n\nMr Pangalos also spoke of his meetings with former Premier Branko Chervenkovski and former Foreign Minister Blagoj Hadjinski, to whom on behalf of the PASOK party leadership he extended an invitation to visit Greece.\n\nTurning to the subject of the talks in New York on the name issue, Mr Pangalos expressed his thanks to Ambassadors Zacharakis and Tosevski, both excellent diplomats, and added \"Great progress has been made. There is still some exploration to done with regard to the name. It is getting to the point where the experts have done what they can and it is up to the politicians to assume their responsibilities. What we need now is courage and the support of the Press to encourage both peoples to look ahead and get past their suspicions and the pettiness of the past\", Mr Pangalos said.\n\nIn response to a question from Nova Makedonija newspaper on minority communities in Greece, Mr Pangalos replied that the accusations of violations of the human rights of the Slav-speakers in Greece were circulated by Ouranio Toxo\", an party that took part in the elections under a common banner with the Stalinist \"Organisation for the Reconstruction of the Communist Party\", and the \"Movement for the Liberation of Homosexuals\". The nation-wide support for this coalition totalled exactly 1840 votes. At this point Mr Pangalos asked whether \"it is really worth our while to talk about 1800 people and create a minority problem\". He commented that \"if we start getting into this area we will unearth minorities that you have never even imagined\". If these people thought that their rights were being violated in Greece, they could go to the Council of Europe - of which Greece is a member - and seek justice, the Foreign Minister said.\n\nAs Mr Pangalos noted, \"there is a decision of the Council of Europe, which is respected in Greece and which adjudged the Right to be on the side of the appellant\". Consequently, said Mr Pangalos, \"the same is true for groups of people who live here and who have a special sensitivity towards Greece\", and he mentioned the \"Pelagonia\" association, a delegation from which he had met with in Skopje.\n\nOn the same subject, FYROM Foreign Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov stated that he and Mr Pangalos, in the context of collaboration between their two countries, had talked about respect for human rights and the agreement on the human rights framework, looking towards the future in order to build up a climate of confidence and solve all problems.\n\nFinally, in answer to a question on whether the border between Greece and FYROM is open, Mr Pangalos replied that it was. At this point there was an intervention from Mr Mallias, the head of the Greek Liaison Office in Skopje, who said that since 1995 Greece had issued 1,300,000 entry permits for Greece from Skopje and Mr Pangalos added that there were specific difficulties with the Schengen Accord and that the Greek Liaison Office in Skopje had issued 50,000 Schengen visas."
