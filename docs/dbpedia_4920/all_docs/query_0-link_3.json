Twenty-four of the new members of the government had no previous ministerial experience. Nine of the members were women, a very large proportion by Greek standards, while five of them were named to head ministries among the 14 portfolios.[3] Papandreou appointed himself foreign minister, a portfolio he held in a previous Pasok government.[4]\n\nChanges in government structure\n\n[edit]\n\nThe new cabinet features less ministries than usual in the past (four less than the previous cabinet),[3] and significant changes in several of them:\n\nthe post of a Vice-President of the Government has been re-introduced and given a coordinating role over the Government Council for Foreign Affairs and Defense (KYSEA) and the committee on Economic and Social Policy.\n\nthe united Ministry for Economy and Finance has been split up again, with the Ministry for Economy also taking over the role of the Ministry for Development and most functions of the Ministry for Mercantile Marine.\n\nthe regional ministries, namely the Ministry for Macedonia–Thrace and the Ministry for the Aegean and Island Policy, were abolished. Instead, a Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Finance, Competitiveness and Mercantile Marine resided in Macedonia.[1]\n\nthe Ministry for Transport and Communications was merged with the Public Works sector of the Ministry for the Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works, while a dedicated Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Climate Change is created.\n\nthe General Secretariats of Public Order (supervising the Hellenic Police and Hellenic Fire Service) and of Civil Defence of the Ministry for the Interior, together with the Hellenic Coast Guard (previously under the purview of the Ministry for Mercantile Marine) are joined into the new Ministry for the Protection of the Citizen.[1] In essence, it forms a revival, in a revised form, of the old Ministry for Public Order.\n\nthe ministries of Culture and Tourism were merged.[1]\n\nMinisters\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice Incumbent Party Dates Prime Minister George Papandreou Panhellenic Socialist Movement 6 October 2009 Deputy Prime Minister Theodoros Pangalos Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for the Interior, Decentralization and Electronic Governance Giannis Ragousis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Finance Giorgos Papakonstantinou Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Foreign Affairs George Papandreou Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for National Defence Evangelos Venizelos Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for the Economy, Competitiveness and Shipping Louka Katseli Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for the Environment, Energy and Climate Change Tina Birbili Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Education, Lifelong Learning and Religious Affairs Anna Diamantopoulou Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Networks Dimitris Reppas Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Labour and Social Security Andreas Loverdos Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Health and Social Solidarity Mariliza Xenogiannakopoulou Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Rural Development and Food Katerina Batzeli Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Justice, Transparency and Human Rights Haris Kastanidis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Citizen Protection Michalis Chrisochoidis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Culture and Tourism Pavlos Geroulanos Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister of State to the Prime Minister Haris Pamboukis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Alternate Minister for Foreign Affairs Dimitris Droutsas Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Alternate Minister for National Defence Panos Beglitis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009\n\nThe 2010 cabinet\n\n[edit]\n\nPrime Minister Papandreou's second cabinet was sworn in on 7 September 2010,[2] after a major cabinet reshuffle with 48 cabinet members comprising the new government, of which seven members were alternate ministers – up from two in the previous Cabinet – and 24 deputy ministers. The majority of Cabinet members are M.P.s from the ruling PA.SO.K. party. The Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Islands and Fisheries - essentially the re-established Merchant Marine ministry - was established.[2]\n\nMinisters\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice Incumbent Party Dates Prime Minister George Papandreou Panhellenic Socialist Movement 6 October 2009 Deputy Prime Minister of Greece Theodoros Pangalos Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for the Interior, Decentralization and Electronic Governance Giannis Ragousis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Finance Giorgos Papakonstantinou Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Foreign Affairs Dimitris Droutsas Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Minister for National Defence Evangelos Venizelos Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Regional Development and Competitiveness Michalis Chrisochoidis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Minister for Maritime Affairs, Islands and Fisheries Giannis Diamantidis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Minister for the Environment, Energy and Climate Change Tina Birbili Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Education, Lifelong Learning and Religious Affairs Anna Diamantopoulou Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Networks Dimitris Reppas Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Labour and Social Security Louka Katseli Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Minister for Health and Social Solidarity Andreas Loverdos Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Minister for Rural Development and Food Kostas Skandalidis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Minister for Justice, Transparency and Human Rights Haris Kastanidis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister for Citizen Protection Christos Papoutsis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Minister for Culture and Tourism Pavlos Geroulanos Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Minister of State to the Prime Minister Haris Pamboukis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 October 2009 Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister and Government Spokesman George Petalotis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Alternate Minister for Foreign Affairs with responsibility for the European Union Mariliza Xenogiannakopoulou Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Alternate Minister for National Defence Panagiotis Beglitis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 14 October 2009 Alternate Minister for Regional Development and Competitiveness Sokratis Xynidis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Alternate Minister for the Environment, Energy and Climate Change Nikolaos Sifounakis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Alternate Minister for Education, Lifelong Learning and Religious Affairs Fofi Gennimata Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Alternate Minister for Labour and Social Security Giorgos Koutroumanis Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010 Alternate Minister for Labour and Social Security responsible for the Medias Tilemachos Chytiris Panhellenic Socialist Movement 7 September 2010\n\nThe 2011 cabinet\n\n[edit]\n\nPrime Minister George A.
