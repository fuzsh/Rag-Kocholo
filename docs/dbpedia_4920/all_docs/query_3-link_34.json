        "text": "#1. Azerbaijan: Judicial Services and Smart Infrastructure\n\nThe development objective of the Judicial Services and Smart Infrastructure Project for Azerbaijan is to improve the access, transparency, and efficiency of the delivery of selected justice services. Within just over a decade, Azerbaijan has established a nationwide e-court system that delivers justice services to citizens and businesses regardless of their physical location. Attention is paid to the needs of vulnerable populations, and targeted efforts are underway to increase women's representation within the judiciary. Readily available data paired with streamlined business procedures have paved the way for the next digitalization wave, currently tested with select pilots using business intelligence and artificial intelligence tools.\n\nPresenter: Eva Melis, Senior Governance Specialist (World Bank)\n\n#2. Croatia: Justice for Business\n\nThe Justice for Business Project aims to improve the service delivery, business regulatory procedures, and justice service standards for businesses and citizens in Croatia. The main counterpart is the Ministry of Justice and Public Administration, with support from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, and the Ministry of Construction. The project includes two distinctive but interlinked components. Component one is a results-based component aimed at reducing businesses' administrative burden. Component two combines results-based financing to support improvements in the delivery of justice services with an emphasis on those provided to businesses, and direct investment supporting the rehabilitation of selected judicial facilities for better onsite court performance. The project also supports project management and technical assistance for implementing results-based financing interventions.\n\nPresenter: Srdjan Svircev, Senior Public Sector Specialist (World Bank)\n\n#3. Kenya: Digital Mediation Management\n\nSince 2020, the Kenyan Judiciary’s Court-Annexed Mediation (CAM) and World Bank’s Development Impact Evaluation and Development Research Group teams have collaborated to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of the mediation process and the assignment of cases to mediators. The \"Cadaster” data collection and management platform, first introduced to the CAM teams in late May 2021, has (i) significantly improved administrative data management and aggregation speed and accuracy, simplifying the maintenance of the mediator register and accelerating case assignment and payment processing, (ii) provided the CAM team with valuable insights via various visual dashboards, showcasing real-time summaries of case assignments and resolutions, (iii) received positive feedback from judiciary officers, and (iv) improved both equity and efficiency of case assignments through innovative solutions, such as the deployment of a dynamic algorithm that flexibly adjusts case assignments to observed performance.\n\nPresenters: Justice Caroline Kendagor, Judge (High Court of Kenya), Anja Sautmann, Senior Economist (World Bank), and Wei Lu, Consultant (World Bank)\n\n#4. Peru: Improving the Performance of Non-Criminal Justice Services and Providing Free Legal Services for Those in Need through the ALEGRA Centers\n\nThe Improving the Performance of Non-criminal Justice Services in Peru Project, approved in 2019, seeks to improve efficiency, access, transparency, and user satisfaction, in the delivery of adequate non-criminal justice services. Potentially, the most transformative project component finances the development and nationwide rollout of an automated case management system for non-criminal cases (Expediente Judicial Electronico - EJE). The new EJE will (i) be implemented in all level courts of the country, (ii) allow court users to access and process their cases entirely online, and (iii) have an interface with other justice-related agencies. In addition, the World Bank supported the upgrade and digitalization of 12 ALEGRA (Asistencia Legal Gratuita) Centers, with 16 in progress and 17 more pending clearance. The Centers provide legal assistance, support for victims of domestic and gender-based violence, and free conciliation. They are usually located in peri-urban areas, providing services to those with limited economic resources, vulnerable groups (persons with disabilities, women, Indigenous or native communities), or those subject to special protection under Peruvian law.\n\nPresenters: Carolina Luisa Vaira, Senior Governance Specialist (World Bank), and Ruben Ruano Chinchilla, Senior Public Sector Specialist (World Bank)\n\n#5. Romania: Strengthening the Foundations for Improved Justice Service Delivery\n\nThe Strengthening Foundations for Improved Justice Service Delivery Project (“Foundations”) is a seven-year project that aims to improve access to and the resilience of justice services in Romania. The project builds on nearly two decades of World Bank collaboration on justice reform, including the recent Functional Review of the Romanian justice sector – a two-year holistic diagnostic of the sector. Project activities address both upstream and downstream challenges by establishing key building blocks for the shift toward a more integrated model of justice service provision in Romania. Foundations will support reforms and investments to improve access to justice services through the development of an integrated, user-centric model for service delivery, expansion of Romania's legal aid framework, and modernization of selected courts’ infrastructure. Additionally, the project focuses on improving the resilience and management of sector resources, supporting advancements in digitalization and the development of business continuity plans while building institutional capacity and strengthening inter-institutional coordination and collaboration.\n\nPresenters: Adriana-Victoria Gheorghiu, Deputy Project Manager (Department for Implementation of Externally Financed Projects of the Ministry of Justice of Romania), and Holly Burduja, Senior Public Sector Specialist (World Bank)\n\n#6. Tanzania: Citizen-Centric Judicial Modernization and Justice Service Delivery\n\nThis project was designed to support judicial reforms necessary to facilitate a results-oriented, citizen-centric, and accountable justice delivery system in Tanzania. The project has three main components: (1) Governance, Organization, and Systems Development, which aims to improve court efficiency and modernize court administration; (2) Skills Development, Inspection, and Performance Management, which aims to further strengthen the training, performance, and skills of the judiciary and its stakeholders; and (3) Access to Justice and Public Trust, which aims to enhance access to justice services and building citizen trust. The geographic coverage of the project is the Tanzania Mainland, and the main implementing agency is the Judiciary of Tanzania.\n\nPresenters: Professor Elisante Ole Gabriel, Chief Court Administrator (Judiciary of Tanzania), and Christine Owor, Senior Public Sector Specialist (World Bank)\n\n#7. Gender Justice: Voices of the Vulnerable in MENA and Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nExpanding access to justice for all—especially vulnerable groups, including women—is paramount for social and economic development. As gender equality strategies become more visible and central to governance and justice modernization efforts around the globe, very little empirical evidence exists about women’s justice needs compared to men, whether they take legal action, what challenges they encounter, and to whom they turn to seek relief. This gender justice data gap prevents the design of targeted interventions that would adequately address the justice needs of women in developing countries. This presentation will share ongoing citizen-centric survey efforts in MENA and Sub-Saharan Africa that collect gender-disaggregated data and extract distinct findings to enhance men's and women’s access to justice and address their specific needs.\n\nPresenter: Clara Maghani, Governance Specialist (World Bank)\n\n#8. Dispute Resolution Topic in the Business Ready Project (B-READY)\n\nAs part of the Business Ready project (B-READY), the Dispute Resolution Topic provides a quantitative assessment of dispute resolution systems at the global level. Dispute Resolution focuses particularly on commercial cases, even though many of its indicators are relevant to the justice system as a whole. The Topic’s scope is comprehensive and covers the main elements that relate to both efficiency and quality of dispute resolution. In addition to court processes, the performance of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms, such as arbitration and mediation, is also part of the study. The data for Dispute Resolution comes from local legal experts as well as directly from firms through Enterprise Surveys. On an annual basis, the Topic will assign a dispute resolution score to each economy covered by B-READY.\n\nPresenter: Raman Maroz, Private Sector Development Specialist (World Bank)\n\n#9. Prosperity Data 360\n\nProsperity Data360 is a World Bank open data initiative dedicated to streamlining access to and promoting the use of development data. The platform offers a wealth of data, resources, and tools to inform policy measures that foster inclusive and sustainable growth. In doing so, it contributes to the World Bank's goals of poverty reduction and the promotion of shared prosperity, all while ensuring a livable planet for future generations. Prosperity Data 360 provides access to the “Justice Factsheets”, a one-of-a-kind consolidated dataset of indicators measuring attitudes towards the judiciary, allowing cross-country comparisons and the production of country profiles.\n\nPresenters: Pechiyappan Muthukumar, Knowledge Management Analyst (World Bank), and Ramin Aliyev, Senior Knowledge Management Officer (World Bank)\n\n#10. Women, Business and the Law (WBL)\n\nWomen, Business and the Law collects data on laws and policies across 190 economies to measure the enabling environment for women’s economic opportunity from 1970 until today. The indicators build evidence of the critical relationship between legal gender equality and women’s full and equal economic participation to inform research and policy discussions. Women, Business and the Law 2024 is the tenth in a series of annual studies. This year, the study presents two sets of data: Women, Business and the Law 1.0, and an expanded version, Women, Business and the Law 2.0. For the first time, Women, Business and the Law 2.0 analyzes not only laws—de jure— but also examines the existence of frameworks supporting the implementation of the law and gauges experts’ opinions on the outcome of the law for women—de facto. It also introduces two new indicators – Safety and Childcare.\n\nPresenters: Julia Braunmiller, Senior Private Sector Development Specialist (World Bank), and Emilia Galiano, Senior Private Sector Development Specialist (World Bank)\n\n#11. World Bank Legal Vice Presidency: Innovative Approaches to Legal Capacity Building\n\nLaunched in 2013 by the World Bank's Legal Vice Presidency (LEG), the African Mining Legislation Atlas (AMLA) is a collaborative project on comparative mining law with African institutions and universities. It is a free online resource that provides interactive access to mining legislation in 53 African countries, supporting the drafting and revision of legislation and the training of legal professionals. AMLA promotes transparency, legal research, and local expertise in mining law. In addition, in partnership with international organizations and academic institutions, LEG leads the Ocean Governance Capacity Building Training Program, which provides stakeholders with training on ocean governance based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to strengthen local legal frameworks and ultimately support sustainable blue economies. It includes e-learning, customized readings, assignments, and live discussions and is offered in English, Spanish, and French.\n\nPresenters: Remi Moncel, Senior Counsel (World Bank), Christian Brugerolle, Counsel (World Bank), Yinsongti Tindana, Consultant (World Bank), and Marshall Maina, Consultant (World Bank)"
