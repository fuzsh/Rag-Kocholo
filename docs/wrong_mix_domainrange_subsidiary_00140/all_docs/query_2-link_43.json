        "text": "New acute rehabilitation unit to accept patients in September.\n\nPEORIA, Ill. (August 18, 2022) – OSF HealthCare Transitional Care Hospital, a joint venture between OSF HealthCare and Kindred Hospitals (“Kindred”), now part of ScionHealth, celebrated a ribbon-cutting August 18 to mark the completion of its new, 29-bed acute rehabilitation unit (“ARU”). The new unit complements the existing, 18-bed long-term acute care (“LTAC”) hospital at the Peoria, Illinois facility. The inpatient rehabilitation unit will begin accepting patients in September.\n\nThe hospital’s new ARU will help in the recovery of adults who have experienced a loss of function or disability due to stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, neurological disorders, orthopedic surgery and other conditions. It will provide intense, interdisciplinary rehabilitation therapies and features all private rooms, two new gyms utilizing the latest rehabilitation equipment and technology, an activities-of-daily-living suite and designated activity and dining rooms.\n\nThe hospital’s 18 LTAC beds continue to deliver care for the most difficult-to-treat, critically ill and medically complex patients – such as patients with respiratory failure, septicemia, traumatic injuries, wounds or other severe illnesses complicated by multiple chronic conditions.\n\nBoth settings partner with an individual’s physician and offer 24-hour clinical care seven days a week. Together, the 47-bed specialty hospital offers a unique combination of services to better suit the needs of patients needing post-acute care in the central Illinois area.\n\n“We are excited to build upon our partnership with Kindred to create a specialty hospital best-suited to meet the needs of those needing additional care after injury or illness, often after an initial stay at a traditional hospital,” said Bob Sehring, CEO of OSF HealthCare. “This will allow us to fill a great need in central Illinois by expanding long-term acute care and rehabilitation services for our patients, providing the very best options to those who come to us for care.”\n\n“These co-located, specialty services not only provide clinical care to medically complex patients and rehabilitative care to those recovering from injury or illness, they will also be able to provide a seamless transition between these levels of care for many patients,” said Chris Curry, CEO of OSF HealthCare Transitional Care Hospital. “We are excited to fully open this unique hospital and continue helping patients along their journeys to recovery.”\n\nDeacon Joe Knapp Manager, Pastoral Care, OSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center blessed the hands of OSF HealthCare Transitional Care Hospital staff as part of the ceremony. The ribbon cutting featured remarks from Curry, Sehring and Mike Warrington, president of ScionHealth’s Specialty Hospitals, which operate under the Kindred Hospitals brand. In attendance at the ceremony, which was assisted by the Peoria Chamber of Commerce, were local city council representatives.\n\nOSF HealthCare Transitional Care Hospital is located at 500 W Romeo B Garrett Avenue in Peoria. OSF holds majority ownership in the specialty hospital, which will operate as a Catholic healthcare facility.
