The National Advertising Awards were announced at the Annual DTC National Conference in Boston, which was held October 12-14.\n\nThe campaign, “Theater ‘Flow’,” is the first national TV campaign in Teleflex history. The ad features prominent imagery associated with symptoms of enlarged prostate, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), including increased frequency, a weak urine stream and feeling of incomplete emptying of the bladder. The ad includes a clear call to action to visit the branded website and to call a toll-free number. The UroLift System is a minimally invasive treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH, a condition that leads more than 12 million men in the U.S. to seek treatment every year.1\n\n“Many big pharma companies with large advertising budgets were selected as finalists for the Best New Branded Television Campaign,” said Bryan Holmes, Global Vice President, Marketing and Business Development of the Teleflex Interventional Urology Business Unit. “We were somewhat of an underdog from this perspective but were able to create a terrific campaign that stood out to the judges. We are proud of our skilled team, and our success was a result of their hard work and dedication to producing quality work that spoke to our target audience.”\n\n“DTC works when potential customers ask their doctor about the advertised product. DTC works really well when there is a large pool of potential users who are informed about something new to help them. The UroLift System meets both criteria. The pool of men with BPH is large, and UroLift is a novel approach,” said Bob Ehrlich, Chairman, DTC Perspectives, Inc.\n\nThe campaign aired for 25 weeks, from July 6 to December 30, 2020. Over the course of the campaign 3,108 television ads in :60 and :30 second spots ran on national cable stations. The response to the television ad was nearly double what was originally planned, demonstrating a significant breakthrough to the brand’s target market. Additionally, traffic to the branded website increased 146%.\n\nThe campaign was developed in partnership with the award-winning creative director Rocky Botts of the Rocky Botts Creative agency.\n\nAbout the DTC Perspectives Awards\n\nDTC Perspectives, the leading forum for direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising thought leaders, honors a dynamic group of pharmaceutical companies and brands at the much-anticipated DTC National Advertising Awards.

This study explains the mechanism of action through which the UroLift System provides long-term durability and sustained results for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also referred to as enlarged prostate.\n\nThe UroLift System implants provide rapid relief from disruptive lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) through a minimally invasive procedure that pulls back enlarged prostate tissue. This published study is unique in its amalgamation of three different facets of research by including pre-clinical canine tissue, human tissue, and post-market surveillance data. Tissue samples were examined from twenty-four healthy canines and four human patients who were implanted with the UroLift System. Researchers reviewed the microscopic structure on all tissue samples to uncover any potential changes attributed to the implants.\n\nThe microscopic evaluation found that the extracted tissues revealed normal-appearing tissue with minimal-mild inflammation and no encrustation, indicating a stable and normal healing response. The data support a long-term biological mechanism of action whereby compression-induced localized tissue remodeling is initiated by the UroLift System implant placement and leads to a widened prostatic urethra. Furthermore, post-market surveillance data of over 770,000 UroLift System devices support that the implant is stable and remains fixed after proper deployment, and demonstrate low rates of breakage (0.004%) and encrustation (0.006%). Taken together, the biocompatibility and stability of the UroLift System implants appear to be superior to prostatic stents, with studies of prostatic stents showing that up to 47% of men require removal of their implants due to complications associated with migrations and encrustations.1\n\nThe UroLift implant pulls the enlarged prostate toward the capsule, thereby mechanically creating an immediate, visible deobstruction in the prostatic urethra. The researchers discuss this “prostate lift” is a fundamentally distinct mode of action compared with not only prostatic stents, but also thermal ablation techniques that induce tissue damage and may result in extended periods of edema, retention/catheterization, and higher risks of urinary infections and ejaculatory dysfunction. 2,3,4,5,6,7\n\n“The UroLift System is the first mechanical prostatic implant to demonstrate safe and effective treatment of BPH without common issues associated with prior stents. This study describes in detail the unique prostate lift mechanism of action that is the basis of its durable outcomes,” said Dr. Peter Chin, Clinical Associate Professor, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Wollongong, and author on the paper. “Not only are the results seen with the UroLift System sustainable, but the implants can provide a superior patient experience during the early recovery period4, and rapid symptom relief and preservation of sexual function*”9\n\n“More than 12 million men in the U.S. are treated for BPH/LUTS. With over 250,000 patients treated globally with the UroLift System, it has been the right solution for many patients,” said Jacqueline Welch, Medical Director of the Teleflex Interventional Urology business unit. “Physicians can implant the UroLift System with confidence due to the demonstrated long-term durability and sustained BPH relief that it provides.”10\n\nAbout the UroLift® System\n\nThe UroLift® System is a minimally invasive treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

The UroLift System may enable men to experience rapid symptom relief, recover from the procedure quickly, and return to their normal routines with minimal downtime.3,4 This minimally invasive procedure can achieve consistent results in a broad range of BPH patients with various anatomies and a wide range of sizes.”\n\n“Celebrating 250,000 patients treated with the UroLift System is an exciting milestone. We thank the physicians in our community who recommend the UroLift System to their patients,” said Tyler Binney, President of the Teleflex Interventional Urology business unit. “Recent clinical data show the UroLift System provides a superior patient experience with better sexual function, lower catheterization rates, less interference with daily activities, and higher patient satisfaction in the early recovery period.b,5 Patients treated with the UroLift System may also achieve better outcomes in sexual function and satisfaction than men who receive medical therapyc,8 These positive UroLift System outcomes align with our goal at Teleflex to improve the health and quality of patients’ lives.”\n\nAbout the UroLift® System\n\nThe UroLift® System is a minimally invasive treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

The new system, which builds on the highly successful UroLift System, features a number of enhancements to enable urologists to more easily treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients with challenging anatomies, including an obstructive median lobe and large lateral lobes. The UroLift ATC System will be launched on a limited basis while the business unit expands its capacity to meet demand.\n\nThe UroLift ATC System was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2020 to treat BPH, including lateral and median lobe hyperplasia, in prostates up to 100cc in men 45 years of age or older. The standard UroLift System was previously cleared by the FDA in late 2017 for median lobes. Although only a small percentage of patients have an obstructive median lobe, the UroLift ATC System further enhances the ability to treat these anatomies.\n\nThe new UroLift ATC System delivers the same proven UroLift implant through an enhanced delivery device tip. It features tissue control wings that hold tissue during manipulation, enabling the urologist to mobilize obstructive tissue and pin it to the side to enhance visualization and open up the blockage caused by the enlarged prostate. The tissue control wings are strategically shaped to optimize the view of obstructing tissue. The UroLift ATC System also includes a needle location marker with laser-etched markings that can aid with targeting accuracy for predictable implant placement.\n\n“We are encouraged by early positive responses from urologists to the UroLift ATC System. Urologists are reporting high satisfaction with its ease of use and indicating their willingness to adopt the new device in their practices to treat patients with challenging anatomies, including obstructive median lobe and large lateral lobes,” said Dave Amerson, president of the Teleflex Interventional Urology business unit.\n\n“My experience with the UroLift ATC System has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Steven Gange, M.D.+, Salt Lake City, Utah. “The new design features of the UroLift ATC System make it easier for me to treat patients with complex anatomies, and especially increase my confidence in treating patients with an obstructive median lobe.”\n\nThe UroLift System has consistently achieved statistically significant results in patients with an obstructive median lobe; the new UroLift ATC System will make it easier to handle the more complex anatomy of these patients. Data published from the MedLift Study showed that patients who were treated for obstructive median lobe with the standard UroLift System experienced significant improvements in IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), Qmax (peak flow rate), and QoL (quality of life) scores:1\n\nFree, Online Presentation to Address Symptoms of Enlarged Prostate, Treatment Options and Tips for Managing Condition During Pandemic\n\nWAYNE, PA.— June 8, 2020—Teleflex Incorporated (NYSE: TFX) today announced that the company will host a free community health talk to discuss the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment options for enlarged prostate, also known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Dr. Wayne Kuang* will lead the webinar which can be viewed live on Wednesday, June 17 at 8:00 a.m. PDT and again at 4:30 p.m. PDT. Men and / or their partners from anywhere in the U.S. can attend the event.\n\nBPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate that occurs as men age. This common condition is marked by bothersome urinary symptoms that can cause loss of productivity, depression, interrupted sleep and decreased quality of life.1 If left untreated, the condition can worsen over time and cause permanent bladder damage.2\n\n“We are excited to offer our first ever virtual community health talk – a result of our efforts to stay connected with our patient community during the current pandemic,” said Dave Amerson, president of Teleflex Interventional Urology business unit. “Maintaining health is top of mind for many of us as we continue to navigate life in the midst of a pandemic. Our aim is to share information about BPH to a broad audience so that men who may be suffering from symptoms have accurate and reliable information they need to make informed decisions for their health.”\n\n“As providers, we are dedicated to empowering our patients to get the information they need to make informed decisions about their health during this unprecedented time,” said Dr. Wayne Kuang, MD For Men, Albuquerque, NM. “Our goal for this timely webinar during Men’s Health Month is to provide attendees with a better understanding of how to address the challenges of an enlarged prostate – a condition that affects more than 40 million men in the U.S. alone3,4– and provide information about treatment solutions, such as the UroLift® System, for those experiencing BPH symptoms.”\n\nRegister to participate in this informative webinar by following this link: www.UroLift.com/seminar.\n\nAbout the UroLift System\n\nThe FDA-cleared UroLift System is a proven, minimally invasive technology for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The UroLift permanent implants, delivered during a minimally invasive transurethral outpatient procedure, relieve prostate obstruction and open the urethra directly without cutting, heating, or removing prostate tissue.
