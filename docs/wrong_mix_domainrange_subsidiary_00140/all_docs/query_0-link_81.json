        "text": "Abstract\n\nCollaborative learning has been suggested as a promising approach to help older adults learn new technology, however, its effectiveness has been understudied in the context of feature-rich applications. We conducted an observational study with the aim of identifying aspects of collaborative learning, including characteristics of collaborative partners, that impact older adults' exploratory learning behaviour in feature-rich software. We recruited 22 participants (6 younger adults and 16 older adults) who formed 5 same-age and 6 mixed-age dyads. These dyads worked together remotely to explore a feature-rich application, which was new to them. We classified dyadic interactions into four different collaboration dynamics characterized by distinct attributes. We discovered that effective communication and the ability to navigate the software independently enabled a successful collaboration dynamic that empowered learners. We showed that trust between partners enabled effective communication and we observed that the existing relationship between partners strongly impacted their communication patterns. The more complicated study tasks required participants to validate the correctness of their work and this validation was particularly difficult for some novice older adults who did not benefit from transfer learning and struggled with navigation issues.\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nZIP File\n\nPaper title: Older Adults' Collaborative Learning Dynamics When Exploring Feature-Rich Software The Supplemental Materials (one PDF file) include: - Appendix A: Pre-study Questionnaire - Appendix B: Task in Contextual Orientation session, interactive build mode - Appendix C: Post-stuyd questionnaire - Appendix D: Interview Questions - Appendix E: Task set 1-3 in design tasks session - Appendix F: Participants' level of tech comfort (pre-study questionnaire) - Appendix G: Codes of open coding, dyadic interaction\n\nDownload\n\n622.14 KB\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nThomas A.

The understanding can better facilitate design conversations between the researchers and the older adults. In this paper, we discussed our experiences of building a relationship ...\n\nOlder Adults and Free/Open Source Software: A Diary Study of First-Time Contributors\n\nOpenSym '14: Proceedings of The International Symposium on Open Collaboration\n\nThe global population is aging rapidly, and older adults are becoming increasingly technically savvy. This paper explores ways to engage these individuals to contribute to free/open source software (FOSS) projects. We conducted a pilot diary study to ...\n\nOlder Adults' Digital Gameplay\n\nBackground. Empirical evidence suggests that digital gameplay can enhance social interaction and improve cognition for older adults. However, if digital games are to be effectively used as interventions to address age-related challenges, it is important ...\n\nInformation & Contributors\n\nInformation\n\nPublished In\n\n6294 pages\n\nEISSN:2573-0142\n\nDOI:10.1145/3661497\n\nEditor:\n\nJeff Nichols\n\nApple Inc., United States\n\nIssue’s Table of Contents\n\nCopyright © 2024 ACM.\n\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
