        "text": "The Healthcare Technology Report is pleased to announce The Top 100 Healthcare Technology Companies of 2021. This year’s awardees comprise a broad range of companies from well-known names like Johnson & Johnson, 3M Health Care, and Illumina to relatively newer but rapidly growing enterprises such as GRAIL, Capsule, and DNA Script. The diverse range of sophisticated products and services offered through these companies — from digital pharmacies to holistic patient care and AI-powered robotics to digital healthcare payments — have not only led to the modernization of the healthcare sector but also to a brighter future where healthcare is democratized for all.\n\nAdvancements in healthcare, whether through data and communications, research and clinical trials, medical devices or consumer offerings, have also helped to create an environment where more promising care alternatives are possible. The pioneering companies selected for this year’s list have one thing in common: they are revolutionizing the way we live, and the way we navigate one of the most important factors for us all: our health. The following awardees were nominated and selected based on a thorough evaluation process. Among the key criteria considered were product or service quality, customer adoption, management team caliber, organizational effectiveness, and company growth among other factors.\n\nPlease join us in recognizing The Top 100 Healthcare Technology Companies of 2021.\n\n1. Johnson & Johnson\n\nCategory: Medical Devices\n\nJohnson & Johnson engages in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a range of products in the healthcare field. The company operates through three business segments, including consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices as well as diagnostics.\n\nThe medical devices and diagnostics segment includes a range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers. These are used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis' circulatory disease management products, DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction, spinal care and sports medicine products and Ethicon's surgical care and women's health products.\n\nJohnson & Johnson was founded in 1886 and is now ranked No. 36 on the 2021 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. Notably, Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's most valuable companies. Earlier this year, Johnson & Johnson revealed that sales of its medical devices climbed 63% year over year, driven by a greater demand for medical devices, drugs and consumer-health products.\n\n2. Integra LifeSciences\n\nCategory: Medical Devices\n\nIntegra LifeSciences is a global leader in neurosurgery. The company offers a broad portfolio of products and solutions for dural access and repair, cerebral spinal fluid management and neuro-critical care. Its regenerative tissue technologies include products that address soft tissue, nerve and tendon repairs and for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds, burns, as well as for plastic and reconstructive surgery.\n\nFounded in 1989 by Richard E. Caruso, the company is headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey. Today, Integra LifeSciences has grown immensely, with over 3000 employees worldwide as well as offices, manufacturing and research facilities in Asia, Australia, Europe, Middle East, and the Americas. Integra products are ubiquitous in many hospital intensive care units and operating rooms around the world. And some of its leading brands include AmnioExcel, Bactiseal, CerebroFlo, Certas Plus, Codman®, CUSA, DuraGen, and DuraSeal.\n\nRecently, Integra posted strong second quarter results, with not only better than expected revenue and much better than expected operating earnings. This year the company has shown a strong recovery from the pandemic, with revenues rising almost 49% year over year in the quarter.\n\n3.
