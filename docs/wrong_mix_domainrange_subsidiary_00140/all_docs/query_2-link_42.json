Welch Allyn, headquartered in Skaneateles Falls and a subsidiary of Chicago-based Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., was founded in 1915 thanks to an invention by Dr. Francis Welch and William Noah Allyn: the first hand-held, direct-illuminating ophthalmoscope. The flashlight-sized instrument shines light inside the back of the eye, allowing a clear view of retina health and functioning.\n\nSince that revolutionary scope’s introduction, the company has grown to become a global innovator of medical exam instruments and accessories, including vital signs and cardiac monitoring devices. In May of this year, Hill-Rom broke ground on an expansion of its manufacturing and research and development operations at Welch Allyn’s Onondaga County facility that will create more than 100 new jobs and retain approximately 900 existing jobs.\n\nThe company is part of a Central New York business landscape that includes high-growth healthcare related jobs and industries and where opportunity is building—benefiting from the region’s higher educational institutions, innovative tech-focused incubators and business accelerators and strengthened by New York State’s investment in the Central NY Rising blueprint for economic development that is generating economic growth and community development as part of the Upstate Revitalization Initiative.\n\nCentral New York, at the crossroads of the state, is having an impact throughout the world.
