(NASDAQ: SONO), the world leader in hand-carried ultrasound, announced today at the 2005 American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions that it is initiating a multi-center study to determine whether the addition of an ultrasound examination evaluating carotid artery wall thickness (CIMT), performed in the office setting, will provide a more effective tool for risk assessment and prevention of cardiovascular disease than current clinical methods alone. Over 20 years of clinical research has shown that the thickness (T) of the two innermost layers of the carotid artery wall, the intima (I) and media (M), begins to increase before plaque is evident within the vessel. This increased wall thickness is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality and disability in the United States today. \"IMT addresses the need to identify those patients who are asymptomatic or have limited risk factors, such as moderately elevated cholesterol levels, who may be at greater than apparent risk for a cardiovascular event,\" explains James H.
