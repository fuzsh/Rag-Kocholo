        "text": "Southcoast Health Patient & Family Advisory Council\n\nThe Southcoast Health Hospital’s Patient & Family Advisory Council (PFAC) provides a vehicle for improved communication among patients, families and staff. Serving as an advisory resource to administration and trustees, the council discusses and reports on issues concerning the greater South Coast community to improve the reach and quality of care.\n\nWe are currently recruiting for members\n\nIf you are interested in being a part of the discussion, apply online today to join the Southcoast Health Patient & Family Advisory Council.\n\nPFACtor Award\n\nThe Southcoast Health PFAC was honored in 2023 with a PFACtor Award at the 7th annual Patient Experience Symposium, hosted by the ICD Healthcare Network. The ICD Healthcare Network’s inaugural PFACtor Awards recognize leadership, creativity, and innovation factors in the implementation of these volunteer groups and other organizations with the same function.\n\nBenefits of PFAC\n\nTransformation of the hospital culture toward patient-family centered care\n\nPatient and families have an increased awareness and understanding of the health care system\n\nIncorporating the feedback from the advisors leads to improved patient satisfaction\n\nThe PFAC provides two-way communication between the hospital’s operation and clinical team and the patients and families we serve.\n\nIt is a great opportunity to listen to and honor the patient and family perspectives and choices.\n\nPatients, families, health care practitioners, and health care leaders collaborate in policy and program development, implementation, and evaluation; in facility design; in professional education; as well as in the delivery of care.\n\nOur Mission & Goals\n\nThe PFAC’s goal is to act as a “consumer advisory group” and serve as a link between Southcoast Health Hospitals and the communities we serve. The PFAC seeks to provide a voice for patients and families about the way in which care is delivered and to discuss concerns about care, quality and access.\n\nThe PFAC’s goal is also to champion family participation in hospital care and decision-making and gather information about significant issues and trends to be considered by hospital administration and staff in its policy-making, program development and staff training and education. The PFAC also helps advise Southcoast Health on community-based education needs to better inform the public about how to play an active role in their health care.\n\nPFAC Membership\n\nSouthcoast Health’s PFAC consists of up to 24 members, with at least 50 percent of the representation coming from the community.\n\nThe PFAC is co-chaired by someone from the community, such as a former patient or a family member, and by someone from Southcoast Health, such as an administrator, trustee or physician. Others are invited to attend the PFAC meetings, depending on the topics or issues to be discussed. Community membership is on a volunteer basis.\n\nThe PFAC meets on the fourth Monday of every month, except in July and December. The committee also meets via conference call the second Monday of each month.\n\nCurrent Members\n\nBelow is a list of our sitting Community Council Members:\n\nKathleen Campanirio\n\nTaunton, MA\n\nDen DeMarinis\n\nNew Bedford, MA\n\nMary Louise Francis\n\nDartmouth, MA\n\nJoan Menard\n\nSouth Dartmouth, MA\n\nGeovanny Gomes Sequeira\n\nNew Bedford, MA\n\nThe Southcoast Health Council Members are listed alphabetically below:\n\nTracey Benson, Service Excellence Specialist\n\nNitya Bhattarai, MD, Hospitalist, Southcoast Health\n\nKimberley Coon, Executive Director of Hospital and Medical Staff Services, Southcoast Health\n\nJadene Elden, VP Revenue Cycle, Southcoast Health\n\nDani Hackner, MD SVP/Chief Clinical Officer, Southcoast Health\n\nRobert McGowen, MD, Medical Director for Patient and Provider Experience\n\nTraci McNeil, Executive Director, Brand, Southcoast Health\n\nLauren Melby, Executive Director, Operations, Southcoast Health\n\nYinka Oluwole, Director of Service Excellence and Patient Experience, Southcoast Health\n\nAlicia Pimental, DNP, RN, Associate Chief Nursing Officer, St. Luke’s Hospital\n\nChris Snow, RN, Executive Director of Emergency Services\n\nJacqueline Somerville, PhD, RN, Senior Vice President, Chief Nursing Officer, Southcoast Health\n\nDilip Sthapit, MD, Hospitalist, Southcoast Health\n\nMelissa Svay, Patient Service & Experience Specialist\n\nMichele Wakeman, Associate Chief Nursing Officer, Tobey Hospital\n\nTrish Wollner, Manager, Service Excellence & Patient Experience\n\nGovernance Structure & Previous Activities\n\nFor relevant information about PFAC governance and the impact we’ve already had on our community, view our by laws or download:\n\nThe 2023 PFAC Annual Report\n\nThe 2022 PFAC Annual Report\n\nThe 2021 PFAC Annual Report\n\nThe 2020 PFAC Annual Report\n\nThe 2019 PFAC Annual Report\n\nThe 2018 PFAC Annual Report\n\nThe 2017 PFAC Annual Report\n\nReporting\n\nIssues and trends deemed as significant or urgent by the PFAC will be brought to the attention of senior administration and Southcoast Health’s Quality Steering Committee.
