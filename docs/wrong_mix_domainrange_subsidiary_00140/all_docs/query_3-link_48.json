        "text": "Effective Date: February 2015\n\nPlease read this agreement carefully. It sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the site and services available through the site. This agreement contains a binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver. It affects your legal rights. Please read it.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWelcome! You have arrived at a site that is owned and/or operated by R3 Education Inc. on behalf of the Saba University School of Medicine (collectively, “Saba” or “we,” “our” or “us”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of www.saba.edu (including, without limitation, both mobile and online versions of our site), and also applies to your use of all features, widgets, plug-ins, applications, content, downloads and other services that we make available through the site and/or that post a link to these Terms (collectively referred to herein as the “Site”). By using the Site, you acknowledge and accept the Site’s Privacy Policy and consent to the collection and use of your data in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

Each time you access and/or use the Site (other than to simply read these Terms), you agree to be bound by and comply with these Terms and any Additional Terms (defined below) then posted.

More\n\nOther Dispute Resolution Where Arbitration Is Not Avail\n\nIf, and to the extent that arbitration is not a permitted form of dispute resolution pursuant to the mandatory laws of your country of residence, then you agree that the provisions of Section 11 shall apply to the resolution of any disputes or claims.

Site Content, Ownership, Limited License and Rights of Others\n\nContent. The Site contains a variety of: (i) materials and other items relating to Saba, the institution and its educational offerings, and similar items from our licensors and other third parties, including all layout, information, articles, posts, webinars, text, data, files, images, scripts, designs, graphics, button icons, instructions, illustrations, photographs, audio clips, music, sounds, pictures, videos, advertising copy, URLs, technology, software, interactive features, the “look and feel” of the Site, and the compilation, assembly, and arrangement of the materials of the Site and any and all copyrightable material (including source and object code); (ii) trademarks, trade dress, logos, trade names, service marks, and/or trade identities of various parties, including those of Saba (collectively, “Trademarks”); and (iii) other forms of intellectual property (all of the foregoing, collectively “Content”).\n\nOwnership.

The foregoing limited license: (i) does not give you any ownership of, or any other intellectual property interest in, any Content, and (ii) may be immediately suspended or terminated for any reason, in Saba’s sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability. In some instances, we may permit you to have greater access to and use of Content, subject to certain Additional Terms.\n\nRights of Others. When using the Site, you must respect the intellectual property and other rights of Saba and others. Your unauthorized use of Content may violate copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, communications, and other laws, and any such use may result in your personal liability, including potential criminal liability.\n\n2. Site and Content Use Restrictions\n\nSite Use Restrictions. You agree that you will not: (i) aside from your submission of an application to attend Saba, use the Site for any political or commercial purpose (including, without limitation, for purposes of advertising, soliciting funds, collecting product prices, and selling products); (ii) use any meta tags or any other “hidden text” utilizing any Trademarks; (iii) engage in any activities through or in connection with the Site that seek to attempt to or do harm any individuals or entities or are unlawful, offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, threatening, harassing, or abusive, or that violate any right of any third party, or are otherwise objectionable to Saba; (iv) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, reverse assemble, or modify any Site source or object code or any software or other products, services, or processes accessible through any portion of the Site; (v) engage in any activity that interferes with a user’s access to the Site or the proper operation of the Site, or otherwise causes harm to the Site, Saba, or other users of the Site; (vi) interfere with or circumvent any security feature of the Site or any feature that restricts or enforces limitations on use of or access to the Site, the Content, or the User-Generated Content; (vii) harvest or otherwise collect or store any information (including personally identifiable information about other users of the Site, including email addresses, without the express consent of such users); (viii) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Site, other computer systems or networks connected to the Site, through password mining or any other means; or (ix) otherwise violate these Terms or any Additional Terms.\n\nContent Use Restrictions.

These Terms and any Additional Terms include only narrow, limited grants of rights to Content and to use and access the Site. No right or license may be construed, under any legal theory, by implication, estoppel, industry custom, or otherwise. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Saba and its licensors and other third parties. Any unauthorized use of any Content or the Site for any purpose is prohibited.\n\n3. Opening and Terminating Accounts\n\nIn order to gain access or use some (or potentially all) of the features on the Site that we make available to enrolled students at Saba, you must first be enrolled or otherwise affiliated with Saba in which case we will issue you a username and password to gain access to the mySaba area of the Site. If you register for any feature that requires a password and/or username (such as if you begin an application to attend Saba and want to come back to the Site to finish it or supplement it), then you will select your own password at the time of registration (or we may send you an email notification with a randomly generated initial password) and you agree that: (i) You will not use a username (or email address) that is already being used by someone else, may impersonate another person, belongs to another person, violates the intellectual property or other right of any person or entity, or is offensive. We may reject the use of any password, username, or email address for any other reason in our sole discretion; (ii) You will provide true, accurate, current, and complete registration information about yourself in connection with the registration process and, as permitted, to maintain and update it continuously and promptly to keep it accurate, current, and complete; (iii) You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account, password, and username – whether or not you authorized the activity; (iv) You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for restricting access to your Device so that others may not access any password protected portion of the Site using your name, username, or password; (v) You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account, password, or username, or any other breach of security; and (vi) You will not sell, transfer, or assign your account or any account rights.\n\nThe Site’s practices governing any resulting collection and use of your personal information are disclosed in the Privacy Policy. We will not be liable for any loss or damage (of any kind and under any legal theory) to you or any third party arising from your inability or failure for any reason to comply with any of the foregoing obligations.\n\nIf any information that you provide, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that any information that you provide through the Site, is false, inaccurate, outdated, incomplete, or violates these Terms, any Additional Terms, or any applicable law, then we may suspend or terminate your account or your affiliation with Saba. We also reserve the more general and broad right to terminate your account or suspend or otherwise deny you access to it or your affiliation with the institution – all in our sole discretion, for any reason, and without advance notice or liability.\n\n4. Notices and Questions\n\nYou agree that: (i) we may give you notices of new, revised or changed terms and other important matters by prominently posting notice on the home page of the Site, or in another reasonable manner; and (ii) we may contact you by mail or email sent to the address provided by you. You agree to promptly notify us if you change your email or mailing address by updating your account information.\n\nIf you have a question regarding using the Site, you may contact us by e-mail at info@saba.edu or calling our number at (978) 862-9600. You acknowledge that the provision of customer support is at Saba’s sole discretion and that we have no obligation to provide you with customer support of any kind.\n\n5. Terms Applicable to Payments Made on the Site\n\nGenerally. To submit an application to Saba on our Site, you must be at least eighteen (18) years of age or the applicable age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence. Prior to submitting an application, you must provide our payment processing vendor with a valid credit card number and associated payment information including all of the following: (i) your name as it appears on the card, (ii) your credit card number, (iii) the credit card type, (iv) the date of expiration, and (v) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card. By submitting that information to us or our credit card processor, you hereby agree that you authorize us and/or our processor to charge your card at our convenience but within thirty (30) days of credit card authorization. For any application you submit through the Site, you agree to pay the price applicable (including any sales taxes and surcharges) as of the time you submit the order. Saba will automatically bill your credit card or other form of payment submitted as part of the order process for such price.\n\nMethods of Payment, Credit Card Terms and Taxes. All payments must be made by the authorized payment cards indicated on the payment page of the Site. We currently do not accept cash, personal or business checks or any other payment form, although in the future we may change this policy. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer to that agreement and not these Terms to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. You hereby represent and warrant that you will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so. YOU, AND NOT SABA, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY. You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchases (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. Unless you notify Saba of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes. If Saba does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by Saba or its agents.\n\nWe grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and non-transferable license to create hyperlinks to the Site, so long as: (a) the links only incorporate text, and do not use any Trademarks, (b) the links and the content on your website do not suggest any affiliation with Saba or cause any other confusion, and (c) the links and the content on your website do not portray Saba or its products or services in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter, and do not contain content that is unlawful, offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, threatening, harassing, or abusive, or that violate any right of any third party or are otherwise objectionable to Saba. Saba reserves the right to suspend or prohibit linking to the Site for any reason, in its sole discretion, without advance notice or any liability of any kind to you or any third party.\n\n7. Linked-To Websites; Advertisements; Dealings with Third Parties\n\nLinked Sites; Advertisements. The Site may contain links, as part of third-party ads on the Site or otherwise, to or from third-party websites (“Linked Sites”), including websites operated by advertisers, licensors, licensees, and certain other third parties who may have business relationships with Saba. Saba may have no control over the content, operations, policies, terms, or other elements of Linked Sites, and Saba does not assume any obligation to review any Linked Sites. Saba does not endorse, approve, or sponsor any Linked Sites, or any third-party content, advertising, information, materials, products, services, or other items. Furthermore, Saba is not responsible for the quality or delivery of the products or services offered, accessed, obtained by or advertised at such sites. Finally, Saba will under no circumstances be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental or special loss or other damage, whether arising from negligence, breach of contract, defamation, infringement of copyright or other intellectual property rights, caused by the exhibition, distribution or exploitation of any information or content contained within these third-party Linked Sites. Any activities you engage in connection with any of the same are subject to the privacy and other policies, terms and conditions of use and/or sale, and rules issued by the operator of the Linked Sites. Saba disclaims all liability in connection therewith.\n\nDealings with Third Parties. Any interactions, correspondence, transactions, and other dealings that you have with any third parties found on or through the Site (including on or via Linked Sites or advertisements) are solely between you and the third party (including issues related to the content of third-party advertisements, payments, delivery of goods, warranties (including product warranties), privacy and data security, and the like). Saba disclaims all liability in connection therewith.\n\n8. Feedback You Submit\n\nGeneral. Saba may now or in the future offer users of the Site the opportunity to create, post, upload, display, publish, distribute, transmit or otherwise make available on or submit through the Site, messages, text, files, comments, responses, information, content, ratings, reviews, suggestions, personally identifiable information, or other information or materials and the ideas contained therein (collectively, “User-Generated Content”). Saba may allow you to do this through contact us, email, and other communications functionality. Subject to the rights and license you grant in these Terms, you retain whatever legally cognizable right, title, and interest that you have in your User-Generated Content and you remain ultimately responsible for it.\n\nNon-Confidentiality of Your User-Generated Content. Except as otherwise described in the Site’s posted Privacy Policy or any Additional Terms, you agree that: (a) your User-Generated Content will be treated as non-confidential – regardless of whether you mark them “confidential,” “proprietary,” or the like – and will not be returned; and (b) Saba does not assume any obligation of any kind to you or any third party with respect to your User-Generated Content. Upon Saba’s request, you will furnish us with any documentation necessary to substantiate the rights to such content and to verify your compliance with these Terms or any Additional Terms. You acknowledge that the Internet and mobile communications may be subject to breaches of security and that you are aware that submissions of User-Generated Content may not be secure, and you will consider this before submitting any User-Generated Content and do so at your own risk. In your communications with Saba, please keep in mind that we do not seek any unsolicited ideas or materials for products or services, or even suggested improvements to products or services, including, without limitation, ideas, concepts, inventions, or designs for websites, recipes, products or otherwise (collectively, “Unsolicited Ideas and Materials”). Any Unsolicited Ideas and Materials you post on or send to us via the Site are deemed User-Generated Content and licensed to us as set forth below. In addition, Saba retains all of the rights held by members of the general public with regard to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials. Saba’s receipt of your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials is not an admission by Saba of their novelty, priority, or originality, and it does not impair Saba’s right to contest existing or future intellectual property rights relating to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.\n\nLicense to Saba of Your User-Generated Content. Except as otherwise described in any applicable Additional Terms (such as a contest official rules), which specifically govern the submission of your User-Generated Content), you hereby grant to Saba, and you agree to grant to Saba, the non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense (through multiple levels), display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative works of, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your User-Generated Content (and derivative works thereof), for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same. Without limitation, the granted rights include the right to: (a) configure, host, index, cache, archive, store, digitize, compress, optimize, modify, reformat, edit, adapt, publish in searchable format, and remove such User-Generated Content and combine same with other materials, and (b) use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any User-Generated Content for any purposes whatsoever, including developing, producing, and marketing products and/or services. In order to further effect the rights and license that you grant to Saba to your User-Generated Content, you also hereby grant to Saba, and agree to grant to Saba, the unconditional, perpetual, irrevocable right to use and exploit your name, persona, and likeness in connection with any User-Generated Content, without any obligation or remuneration to you. Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any User-Generated Content, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights. You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this Section 8(C).\n\n9. Wireless\n\nWireless Features. The Site may offer certain features and services that are available to you via your wireless Device. These features and services may include the ability to access the Site’s features and upload content to the Site, receive messages from the Site, and download applications to your wireless Device (collectively, “Wireless Features”). Standard messaging, data, and other fees may be charged by your carrier to participate in Wireless Features. Fees and charges may appear on your wireless bill or be deducted from your pre-paid balance. Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Wireless Features and certain Wireless Features may be incompatible with your carrier or wireless Device. You should check with your carrier to find out what plans are available and how much they cost. Contact your carrier with questions regarding these issues.\n\nTerms of Wireless Features. You agree that as to the Wireless Features for which you are registered for, we may send communications to your wireless Device regarding us or other parties. Further, we may collect information related to your use of the Wireless Features. If you have registered via the Site for Wireless Features, then you agree to notify Saba of any changes to your wireless contact information (including phone number) and update your accounts on the Site to reflect the changes.\n\n10. Dispute Resolution\n\nCertain portions of this Section 10 are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). You and Saba agree that we intend that this Section 10 satisfies the “writing” requirement of the FAA and/or the New York Convention of 1958. This Section 10 can only be amended by mutual agreement.\n\nFirst – Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes. If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the Content, your User-Generated Content, these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, “Dispute”), or to any of Saba’s actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an “Excluded Dispute”, which includes those actions set forth in Section 10(D)), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such contact information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 10(A). Your notice to us must be sent to: Saba University School of Medicine, c/o R3 Education Inc., 27 Jackson Road, Suite 301, Devens, Massachusetts 01434, United States (Attn: Legal Department). For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Saba and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Saba to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Saba, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.\n\nBinding Arbitration. If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 10(A) (or agree to arbitration in writing with respect to an Excluded Dispute) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND SABA MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. THIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT, SERVICE OR ADVERTISING CONNECTED TO THE PROVISION OR USE OF THE SERVICE (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT – INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT OR COMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR, AGENCY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY – AND WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS. The FAA shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes between Saba and you regarding these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and the Service, including the No Class Action Matters section below. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY. Saba and you agree, however, that Massachusetts or federal law shall apply to and govern, as appropriate, any and all claims or causes of action, remedies, and damages arising between you and Saba regarding these Terms and the Service, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to Massachusetts’ choice of law principles.\n\nA Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules (“Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), except as modified herein, and the arbitration will be administered by the AAA, and in accordance with the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling to set a hearing then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (“JAMS”) using JAMS’ streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of Saba consent to in writing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Saba to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 10 to be enforceable, then Saba will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply and be bound by these Terms and any Additional Terms, and will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a short, reasoned award only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. Issues relating to the enforceability of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions contained herein are for the court to decide. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms or the Service. You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: AAA: 800.778.7879 and https://www.adr.org and JAMS: 800.352.5267 and https://www.jamsadr.com.\n\nLimited Time to File Claims. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT A EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10(A)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES — OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED. Commencing means, as applicable (a) by delivery of written notice as set forth above in Section 10(A); (b) filing for arbitration with the AAA as set forth in Section 10(B); or (c) filing an action in state or Federal court.\n\nInjunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 10 will not apply to any legal action taken by Saba to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or Saba’s intellectual property rights (including such Saba may claim that may be in dispute), Saba’s operations, and/or Saba’s products or services.\n\nNo Class Action Matters. YOU AND SABA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 10(B) to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 10(F). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10 or applicable arbitration rules, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein (described in this “No Class Action Matters” section), are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.\n\nFederal and State Courts in Worcester County, Massachusetts. Except where arbitration is required above or with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute arising hereunder may only be instituted in state or Federal court in Worcester County, Massachusetts. Accordingly, you and Saba consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters\n\nSmall Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n11. Other Dispute Resolution Where Arbitration is Not available\n\nThis Section 11 applies to all users of the Service, if, and only to the extent that, the mandatory laws in your country of residence do not permit arbitration of Disputes in accordance with Section 10 or the parties have not otherwise agreed to arbitration if required by applicable law.\n\nSection 11 Disputes.

Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.

Subject to applicable law, for a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Saba and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Section 11 Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Saba to resolve the Section 11 Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Saba, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.\n\nJurisdiction. The parties agree that the state or federal courts in Worcester County, Massachusetts shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction of any Section 11 Dispute, unless otherwise required by applicable laws of your jurisdiction of resident.\n\nGoverning Law. To the maximum extent permitted by the mandatory laws in your country of residence, these Terms and any Section 11 Dispute arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes), will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.\n\nLimited Time to File Claims. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A SECTION 11 DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11(a) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER DISCOVERY OF THE SECTION 11 DISPUTE ARISES – OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.\n\nInjunctive Relief.
