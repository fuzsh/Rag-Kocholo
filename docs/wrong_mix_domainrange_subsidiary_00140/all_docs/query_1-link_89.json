        "text": "Since 2005, SABA AUTOMATION has never stopped innovating, searching for solutions that can positively help customers in their production process. Automating palletising processes at the end of the cycle is a key factor in being competitive and offering a well-palletised product ready for shipment.\n\nSABA AUTOMATION researches, designs and manufactures tissue end-of-line systems, capable of serving consumer or professional lines. In recent years, the ZEUS series of Palletiser Robots has been renewed for automatic palletisation of products in bags and/or single packs (displays). The latter is the “top of the range” of the palletiser family.\n\nThe latest addition is the ZEUS Layer series, which is suitable for industrial, consumer, folding and other lines. “In this solution, the robots process both bags and individual packs, hence palletising complete layers. We started with an idea, which then grew into the final project. Subsequently, as was to be expected, the transition from design to practical implementation required considerable effort in terms of development and improvement. Adjustments and changes were necessary during the course of the project, as is normal in such a complex challenge. And in this respect, our expertise made the difference. We will soon be presenting further innovations for end-of-line systems; because it is only through innovation and a start-up approach that we can build our future”, explains Alessandro Pollini, Sales Director of SABA AUTOMATION.\n\nTo achieve something “exceptional”, it is always necessary to focus on an unattainable goal… This seems to be the key to understanding the scope and value of the project completed by SABA AUTOMATION for the development of new systems. Digitisation of machines, flexible and automated format changes, remote management and control of production; these are also key aspects.\n\nAt SABA AUTOMATION, 2020 has been a positive year, which allowed the company to consolidate its presence in the end-of-line market dedicated to the tissue industry. Significant orders were acquired, both nationally and internationally. SABA AUTOMATION is the Official System Integrator of KUKA, a German manufacturer of industrial robots with 25 subsidiaries worldwide and a turnover of over 2.5 billion Euros. The integration of these robots, combined with specially designed pick-up implements, as well as product and pallet handling systems, allows the product to be palletised (toilet paper, kitchen paper, napkins, paper handkerchiefs, interfolded paper towels, etc.) gently and without damage.\n\nWe develop technical solutions, in according to your production process\n\nSABA AUTOMATION innovative end-of-line systems\n\nZEUS and ZEUS LAYER ROBOTS. This solution guarantees ultimate speed in terms of cycles per minute, which means that it can be used for lines with a very high production output. Particular care has been paid towards design of the pick-up implements both for unpacked and packed tissue products. These special grippers grasp the product without causing any kind of deformation; this drastically improves quality of palletising. Grippers are motorised with the robot’s interpolated axis to ensure adequate handling of such a delicate product as is tissue paper. The size changeover system adopted is much more accurate than the typical pneumatic systems so that the gripper does not damage the product.\n\nBD CARTESIAN ROBOT. Compact and particularly efficient, they are the ideal solution for lines handling paper napkins, paper handkerchiefs and interfolded paper towels. Cartesian robots designed to operate in three shifts for 365 days a year, with low maintenance requirements and high efficiency.\n\nSABA SOFTWARE. Management software and operator-industrial PC interface have been optimised to make line operation easier still and allow for better control over all end-of-line stages. This software can be interfaced with the latest management systems for data exchange, etc. The SABA AUTOMATION programme for handling different product formats is the same for both ZEUS robots and the BD. Thanks to the combination of robot and software, SABA AUTOMATION robotised palletising systems offer more advantages in terms of cycle time reduction, adaptability to different products and elimination of downtime. Operators no longer have to deal with heavy palletising work and no longer have to perform size changeover operations since a production order can be called up and uploaded in an instant.\n\nCOMPLETE END-OF-LINE SYSTEMS. To complete our end-of-line range, we offer fully automatic solutions for pallet packaging, such as pallet stretch-film wrapping machines, labelling systems and AGV.\n\nReliable and efficient even at a distance\n\nIn order to continue to offer maximum support in an international context conditioned by recent events, SABA AUTOMATION has undertaken a series of initiatives aimed at granting its usual reliability and efficiency.\n\nTo ensure full business continuity, it enhanced its online services: thanks to these tools, combined with established procedures, can now and in the future respond to all service requests from Italy and abroad.\n\nEvents and news\n\nWe will be at MIAC in Lucca from October 13th to 15th, where, besides meeting our staff at the stand, it will be possible (by appointment) to visit a company and see SABA AUTOMATION technology at work."
