        "text": "BLUE ISLAND, Ill., Dec. 12, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Falcon Investors, LLC and Transition Healthcare Company, through their affiliate MSMC Investors, LLC, have entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of MetroSouth Medical Center to a subsidiary of Community Health Systems, Inc.\n\nFalcon Investors and its management partner, Transition Healthcare Company acquired MetroSouth Medical Center in 2008 to save the hospital from financial ruin and imminent closure, preserving quality hospital services for the residents of Blue Island and surrounding communities and saving the jobs of 1,200 employees. With a swift infusion of capital, restructuring expertise and top hospital management, Falcon and Transition achieved an impressive turnaround of hospital operations, restoring financial stability, successfully recruiting physicians, and increasing the quality of care available for patients. During this period, the hospital converted to all private rooms, implemented a hospital-wide electronic medical record to further enhance patient care, and broadened its outreach through health clinics in eight surrounding communities.\n\nAt the same time that these advancements were occurring, shifts in the U.S. economy and healthcare environment changed the long-term outlook for what could be accomplished under the current private ownership model, prompting MSMC Investors to consider a sale of the hospital to a larger healthcare operator with the scale and resources required to continue moving the hospital forward.\n\n\"The leadership of MSMC engaged in a thoughtful process to ensure the best possible future for our hospital and determined that affiliating with a larger organization offered our greatest opportunity for long-term success and growth,\" said Falcon Investors chief executive officer David Reis.\n\n\"In Community Health Systems, we found an exceptionally managed, highly-regarded national organization with vast resources to support the next steps in the hospital's progression,\" added Lawrence Krule, Falcon Investors executive vice president and chief restructuring officer of MetroSouth Medical Center.\n\nBenefits of the transaction for MetroSouth Medical Center include:\n\nThe continuation of all essential services at the hospital, including an open and accessible emergency department;\n\nThe infusion of at least $20 million in equipment upgrades, information systems, infrastructure improvements and working capital at MSMC in the first five years after the transaction;\n\nThe hiring of substantially all active employees in good standing at the time the transaction is complete, offering employees the same position and rate of pay, and recognizing years of service;\n\nThe continuation of relationships with medical staff physicians;\n\nThe continuation of charity care policies consistent with those currently in place;\n\nGuidance by a local board of trustees comprised of members of the medical staff and community leaders.\n\nEnrique Beckmann, M.D., Ph.D. will continue as chief executive officer of the hospital, helping to ensure management continuity through the ownership transition and to continuing his leadership of the hospital's strategic growth initiatives.\n\n\"Partnership with a hospital system the size and caliber of CHS is an exciting development that brings unparalleled advantage to our hospital, medical staff, employees and community,\" said Dr. Beckmann, chief executive officer and chief medical officer of MetroSouth Medical Center. \"In addition to its financial strength, CHS is highly regarded for its physician recruitment successes, strong clinical quality and customer service initiatives, group purchasing power, and the best practices it has developed in operating hospitals across the country.\"\n\nTransition Managing Member, Thomas Reardon said, \"This transaction is in the best interest of everyone involved and will allow the quality operations of MetroSouth to continue in the hands of an experienced, committed hospital company.\"\n\nThrough its affiliates, Community Health Systems currently operates over 130 hospitals, including seven in the state of Illinois.\n\nThe transaction is subject to certain closing requirements, including a Certificate of Need (CON) from the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board. The CON hearing is expected to take place in late February 2012, with the transaction closing shortly after the CON is approved.\n\nAbout MetroSouth Medical Center\n\nMetroSouth Medical Center, formerly known as St. Francis Hospital, a Joint Commission certified hospital is known for exceptional patient care, most especially for its cardiac and OB/GYN services.
