        "text": "Global depth and presence\n\nThousands of professionals. Global resources to support cloud migration and development. The ability to test solutions in our digital and cloud studios. Perennial leadership accolades. These are some of the capabilities that set Deloitte Cloud apart and create confidence in our ability to make cloud transformations happen. When it comes to making cloud possible, Deloitte’s Cloud Institute is training the workforce of the future, focusing on a single outcome: helping companies—yours and ours—embrace what cloud makes possible. Cloud Institute empowers our people to discover their own possible—and that means better outcomes and new value for our clients.\n\nDeloitte Consulting acquired HashedIn Technologies Private Limited, a leading cloud native software engineering and product development firm. Together, the two organizations help clients imagine, deliver, and run their futures with cloud technologies.\n\nAdvise and strategize: Cloud transformations can be complex, and there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. That’s why we tailor solutions to help meet the demands of your industry and organization while keeping your cultural transformation and economics in mind. Hybrid, multi, private, or public cloud—we help assess where you are and create a roadmap to help maximize your cloud potential.\n\nImplement and govern: Whether you’re migrating from a data center, modernizing for a cloud-first organization, or developing your applications in the cloud, our industry experience, and innovative products help you build a reliable foundation for growth and future innovation.\n\nOperate and innovate: Operating in a cloud environment can be challenging—and operating multicloud and hybrid models only increases that complexity. Our Cloud Operate Services provide infrastructure management, as well as compliance and cybersecurity services, delivering resilient and reliable operations for enterprise cloud workloads. By combining our Cloud Managed Services with other offerings, we can deliver business outcomes as a set of cloud-hosted, scalable, and on-demand services to help you innovate and realize the full value of your cloud."
