AGENDA © 2017 Saba Software, Inc. 3 What we’ll cover in today’s webinar: • What is informal learning? • What does it mean to fully embrace informal learning? • How do I know if I’m ready to take it all on?\n\n5. 5 INFORMAL LEARNING refers to all the “non-formal” ways people learn: coaching, access to experts, developmental assignments, reading, performance support, mentorship, apprenticeship, and more.

THE WORLD OF WORK IS CHANGING © 2017 Saba Software, Inc. 6 OLD Hierarchy Data/process-centric Top-down control Homogenous Managed change Integrated silos Permission Incremental improvement NEW Wirearchy People-centric Bottom-up collaboration Diverse Organic innovation Borderless unification Enablement Agile transformation\n\n7. BUSINESS CHALLENGES UNTETHERED • 20% are temps, freelancers, contractors • 30% work somewhere other than the office Source: Bersin by Deloitte 7 ON-DEMAND • 70% more likely to seek information via search engine (vs 50- 60% in course) • Increase in smart phone use COLLABORATIVE • 80% of learning happens in on-the- job interactions • Learners are learning from each other EMPOWERED • Professional skills have a half life of 2 ½ - 5 years • Only 32% of workers report growth opportunities at work? HOW DO YOUR REACH THEM? HOW DO YOU SUPPORT THIS? HOW DO YOU LEVERAGE THIS? HOW DO YOU EMPOWER USERS?\n\n8. TRADITIONAL LEARNING IS A FRACTION © 2017 Saba Software, Inc.

BENEFITS OF INFORMAL LEARNING Everywhere Internal or external Self-discovered Social Discussions Recommendations Shared Flexible Everyday Ad hoc Small Short videos Quick updates Mobile Down time Moment of need © 2017 Saba Software, Inc.\n\n12.

BUT HOW DO I KNOW GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING?\n\n15. HOW DO YOU MEASURE TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS TODAY? WHAT IS MEASURED Attendance Grades WHAT DOES THIS TELL YOU? X number of people completed the course People retained X amount of information upon completion of the course. HOW EFFECTIVE WAS YOUR TRAINING? More text here\n\n16. WHAT SHOULD YOU MEASURE? Whether learning is informal or formal, how you measure its impact should be the same. WHAT BEHAVIOR IMPACT DO WE NEED TO SEE? Why are you promoting learning of any kind? Where are you now and where do you want to be? HOW CAN WE MEASURE THIS CHANGE? What’s your current baseline Are you prepared to measure again in 6 months, 12 months? WAS THE LEARNING EFFECTIVE? Was there a positive change in behavior or performance? Was it sustained?\n\n17. STUMBLING BLOCKS\n\n18. LEADERSHIP COMMITMENT • Maximize adoption with top-down support, participation, and rewards • Recognize that participating (that is contributing resources, consuming them, and commenting on them) is a change in behavior • Reward this change • Show that participation is noted and valued • Early adopter groups can definitely demonstrate the value of the tool but don’t rely on them alone to push adoption through the organization © 2017 Saba Software, Inc. 18\n\n19. MANAGERIAL SUPPORT WHAT ARE THE GAPS IN FORMAL TRAINING? • What is needed after formal training to reinforce learning? • What information isn’t being covered in formal learning? • Do managers have niche training needs that fall outside of the organization’s offerings? WHAT TOOLS DO PEOPLE USE NOW? • Find out what tools are used now to educate people outside of formal training? • What works well? • What doesn’t work at all? RELAY BACK HOW INFORMAL CAN HELP When People: • Feel heard • Understand “What’s In It For Me” • Can see how participation will help them They’re more likely to buy-in and participate © 2017 Saba Software, Inc. 19\n\n20.
