        "text": "Bill Russell joined accesso as the Non-executive Chairman in March 2019, to lead the board and help drive the short and long-term growth strategy for the company. Russell also currently serves as the Non-executive Chairman of PROS Holdings Inc., which provides AI-powered solutions that optimize selling in the digital economy, and he is also a member of the Board of Directors at B.T. Mancini\n\nUntil recently Russell was the Non-executive Chairman of Piksel, an online video management solutions provider and, in the past also served on the boards of SABA Software, webMethods and Cognos, as well as in a variety of roles on the boards of several private technology companies in a career spanning several decades.\n\nRussell brings 23 years of career experience from a number of senior management roles at Hewlett Packard, including Vice President and General Manager of Hewlett Packard’s multi-billion-dollar Enterprise Systems Group and its Software Solutions Group.\n\nHe holds a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science from Edinburgh University and is based in Silicon Valley, CA.\n\nAs Chief Executive Officer at accesso, Steve Brown leads the day-to-day operations of the company.\n\nLike many attractions industry veterans, Brown’s early theme park career began during college as an hourly employee at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando. After a break to pursue his MBA, he returned to Disney where he held a variety of roles with increasing responsibility in financial planning and pricing strategy including development of revised multi-day admission offerings to incorporate the opening of Disney’s Animal Kingdom. In 1999, Brown was named Director, Walt Disney World Ticketing where he led all aspects of the Resort’s ticketing process across its nine gated attractions including pricing strategy, fulfillment operations, training and financial management.\n\nIn 2002 he was named Vice President, Revenue Management for the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. Brown successfully drove dramatic growth in park admissions and hotel revenues through significant changes to strategic and promotional pricing, the introduction of new ticket options and by leveraging technology to expand sales distribution channels. In this broad based executive role, he held primary financial accountability for the Resort’s hotel and ticket revenues, led all promotional and strategic pricing efforts, and managed the attendance forecasting and visitation research functions. In 2005 his role was expanded to encompass line-of-business responsibility for the Disneyland Annual Passholder program including acquisition and renewal marketing, passholder experience optimization, CRM and pricing strategy. Brown’s contributions were key to the Disneyland Resort’s 2005 – 2006 record financial performance during the celebration of the landmark attraction’s 50th anniversary.\n\nPrior to joining accesso, Brown served as the corporate Vice President of Ticket Strategy and Sales for Six Flags. While at Six Flags, he led a 220 person sales force responsible for driving nearly 35% of the company’s admissions revenue. Brown championed an overhaul of the company’s eCommerce process, which doubled the already significant online sales and established Six Flags’ national partnerships with major distributors including Expedia, Travelocity, Best Buy Reward Zone and Costco. He led a comprehensive, research based review of the company’s ticket pricing and developed the strategic plan for 2007 price adjustments across the company’s North American theme parks and water parks. The implementation of this plan contributed significantly to 2007 attendance growth and the company’s positive cash flow results for the first time in its history.\n\nBrown received his MBA from the Goizueta Business School at Emory University in Atlanta and graduated with a BS in Marketing from the University of South Florida in Tampa.\n\nAs Chief Financial Officer, Fern MacDonald provides leadership, direction and management to the organization’s global finance and account­ing team including responsibility for reporting, budgeting, forecasting, compliance and taxation as well as supporting M&A activity.\n\nMacDonald joined accesso in May 2018 bringing over 16 years of finance and accounting experience from both practice and industry. MacDonald is both a Char­tered Accoun­tant and CPA and holds a BA from Dublin City University, Ireland.\n\nPrior to join­ing acces­so, MacDonald spent 8 years with pri­vate equi­ty backed company ZeroChaos, ultimately serving as Executive Vice President, Finance, sup­port­ing the global finance operations, from their US headquarters, through a period of significant growth and acquisitive activity. Previously, MacDonald was a senior manager with Ernst & Young, serving a series of public and private clients from both the Dublin, Ireland and Moscow, Russia offices."
