        "text": "A Clinically Integrated Network (CIN) is a collection of healthcare providers, such as doctors and hospitals, who commit to work together on the quality and cost effectiveness of care for a specific patient population. A CINâ€™s goal is to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while providers minimize duplication of services and prevent medical errors.\n\nCINs are also a vehicle for negotiating direct contracts with commercial and government payers. Typically these contracts tie reimbursement to quality benchmarks and lower the total costs for patients over time.\n\nRoper St. Francis Health Alliance is a CIN, created to deliver a better coordinated, safer and overall better quality patient experience.\n\nAdministrative Team\n\nName\n\nPosition\n\nBob Oliverio, MD\n\nVP & Chief Medical Officer- Ambulatory Care & Population Health, RSFHA ACO Medical Director\n\nEd McNellis, MD\n\nCharleston ENT, RSFHA CIN Medical Director\n\nDoug Bryan\n\nDirector of Operations Roper St. Francis Health Alliance\n\nKristy Hopkins\n\nCIN Operations Coordinator\n\nNicholas Gedeon\n\nCIN Clinical Operations Coordinator\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nThe Roper St. Francis Health Alliance (RSFHA) is a subsidiary of Roper St. Francis Healthcare, and its board of directors was formed to represent both the independent and employed physician communities.
