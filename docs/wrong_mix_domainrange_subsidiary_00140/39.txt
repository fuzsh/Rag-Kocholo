A Clinically Integrated Network (CIN) is a collection of healthcare providers, such as doctors and hospitals, who commit to work together on the quality and cost effectiveness of care for a specific patient population. A CINâ€™s goal is to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while providers minimize duplication of services and prevent medical errors.

CINs are also a vehicle for negotiating direct contracts with commercial and government payers. Typically these contracts tie reimbursement to quality benchmarks and lower the total costs for patients over time.

Roper St. Francis Health Alliance is a CIN, created to deliver a better coordinated, safer and overall better quality patient experience.
