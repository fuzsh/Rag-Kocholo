HSHS St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, which maintains a Gold Seal of approval from The Joint Commission, was founded by the Hospital Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis. Today we continue the mission of our founding sisters: to provide care for the sick and needy with a spirit of respect, care, competence and joy.

We are a member of Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS), a multi-institutional health care system that sponsors 15 hospitals in 14 communities across Illinois and Wisconsin, and an integrated physician network. As our name implies, we are a healing ministry guided by the historic mission of the Hospital Sisters of St. Francis. At the same time, we are firmly grounded in modern best practices.

We use progressive physician partnerships and the latest technology to provide personal, integrated health care across our entire system. We continue to demonstrate commitment to our communities and to our Franciscan traditions by providing quality, caring and compassionate health care to all—including the sick, needy, uninsured and underinsured. We continue to grow thoughtfully, through our commitment to professional lay leadership. Stewardship of resources and strategic investments help ensure the highest standards of clinical quality and service as well as the long-term viability of the system.
