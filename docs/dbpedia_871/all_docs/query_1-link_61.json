The company has embarked on a technological revolution, integrating AI and omnichannel commerce to ensure that it stays relevant and competitive in today’s fast-paced retail environment. In an in-depth discussion with Ravi Hudda, Chief Technology Officer, Raymond, we delve into how the company is embracing the future.\n\nOmnichannel Commerce: Meeting Consumers Where They Are\n\nIn today’s retail landscape, the line between online and offline shopping is increasingly blurred. Hudda explains, \"Omnichannel has become a necessity from a consumer perspective. Today, consumers crave a physical experience in-store as much as they appreciate the convenience of browsing websites or marketplaces. To remain in the consumer’s consideration set, a diverse strategy to attract and capture consumers across various channels is essential.\"\n\nRaymond's journey towards an omnichannel strategy began well before the pandemic, but it was COVID-19 that accelerated the process. \"Standalone channels, both online and offline, have been operating in India since 2015 and 2016,\" Hudda notes, \"but COVID put the entire omnichannel journey on steroids. Physical retail consumers wanted to engage with brands, and online became a very big touchpoint. Once restrictions eased, we saw a surge in consumers returning to physical stores, leading to a phenomenon we call ‘revenge buying’.\"\n\nRaymond's omnichannel strategy now spans across its vast retail network of approximately 1,500 exclusive brand outlets (EBOs), shop-in-shop formats, and franchisee stores. The brand is also present across all major e-commerce marketplaces and runs its own direct-to-consumer (D2C) website. \"If you combine all retail touchpoints, we have more than 20,000 across the country,\" says Hudda, highlighting the sheer scale of Raymond's reach.\n\nThe Power of AI\n\nAs Raymond expanded its omnichannel presence, the need for deeper consumer insights became apparent. Enter Staqu, an AI-powered retail analytics platform that the company has integrated into its stores. \"We all know that AI has huge potential,\" Hudda states. \"When a consumer visits our website, we get full insights—where they come from, what pages they land on, what products they view, and their conversion rates. But what about in-store? We wanted to understand consumer journeys in our stores—when they arrive, who they are, how much time they spend, and their conversion rates.\"\n\nStaqu’s Jarvis, a video analytics solution, provided the perfect answer. Atul Rai, Co-founder and CEO, Staqu, explains, \"Raymond already had cameras in its stores, so the idea was to leverage this existing infrastructure. We connected the feed to the cloud, where Jarvis analyzes the data. The AI tracks footfall, identifies unique visitors (excluding employees), and analyzes consumer behavior within the store.\"\n\nThis technology allows Raymond to create heatmaps of store sections, track which products attract the most attention, and measure how long consumers engage with these products. \"This is information you typically get from online shopping, but offline stores were missing out on it,\" says Rai. \"Now, cameras play a powerful role in providing this data, helping the company optimize their store layouts and product placements.\"\n\nEnsuring Privacy in a Data-Driven World\n\nWith the increasing use of AI and data analytics, privacy concerns are at the forefront. Both Hudda and Rai emphasize Raymond’s commitment to consumer privacy. \"In India, we follow GDPR guidelines, even though there isn’t a data protection law in place yet,\" Rai assures. \"We’re the only company in the country that is GDPR compliant, getting audited monthly to ensure we’re up to standard.\"\n\nThe data collected by Jarvis is anonymized and does not include any personally identifiable information (PII). \"We do not collect data related to faces or any other re-identifiable markers,\" Rai explains. \"The data is stored on Raymond’s cloud, and Staqu does not have access to it. This ensures that Raymond maintains full control over their consumer data, safeguarding it within their firewall.\"\n\nHudda adds, \"Think of it as a watchman sitting outside the store counting the number of people entering. He’s not interested in faces, just the numbers. That’s how we use AI—purely to enhance consumer experience without compromising privacy.\"\n\nMeasuring Success\n\nFor Raymond, the integration of AI is not just about staying ahead of the curve; it’s about tangible results. \"Any investment in technology is measured on ROI,\" Hudda states. \"For instance, if I have two stores in different locations and one has a lower conversion rate, I can analyze whether customers are not spending enough time in the right sections or if our staff needs better training in cross-selling and upselling.\"\n\nFurthermore, the insights from Jarvis enable Raymond to make more informed decisions about store displays, visual merchandising, and even marketing campaigns. \"My marketing dollars are becoming more efficient because I can measure the impact of each campaign,\" Hudda says. \"I can refine those campaigns to create better footfalls and conversions.\"\n\nExpanding Tech Horizons\n\nRaymond is not stopping at just AI-powered analytics. The brand is actively exploring other technological innovations to enhance customer experience. \"We are working on multiple generative AI solutions to make the consumer journey easier, more interactive, and engaging,\" Hudda reveals. While he remains tight-lipped about specific details, it’s clear that the company is gearing up to announce significant progress in the coming quarters.\n\nAs Raymond continues to evolve, embracing technology and innovation, it stays true to its legacy while preparing for the future. By integrating AI and omnichannel strategies, the brand is not just meeting consumer expectations but setting new standards in the retail industry.\n\nIn today’s tech-driven world, India with its booming digital economy, laptops have become an essential tool for personal and professional use.

The brand has been available at different ecommerce websites until now. This move reflects the brand’s strategic expansion efforts within the Indian market, offering beauty enthusiasts an opportunity to experience Laneige’s innovative skincare solutions both online and offline. The recent launch event at Sephora’s Saket store in Delhi was not just a celebration of this collaboration but a testament to the brand's commitment to making high-quality Korean skincare accessible to a wider audience in India.\n\nWhat’s the Buzz?\n\nLaneige, known for its hydration-packed skincare wonders, made its grand debut at Sephora India, both online and in-store. Paul Lee, Country Head, Amore Pacific India, couldn’t hide his excitement: “The event at the Sephora store in Saket was an invigorating experience! Laneige has launched its products in Sephora's physical and online stores for the first time as part of its omnichannel expansion strategy. We aim to complement our strong online presence and provide customers with multiple touchpoints to experience the essence of the brand.”\n\nFor those who live and breathe beauty, Sephora is a sacred space. So, it only makes sense that the Korean beauty brand, with its cult-favorite Water Sleeping Mask and Lip Sleeping Mask, would find its way into this beauty mecca. Mini Sood Banerjee, Assistant Director and Head of Marketing, Amore Pacific India, couldn’t have said it better: “We are thrilled with the debut of Laneige Skin Superheroes at Sephora. The global beauty giant is one of the favorite shopping spots for the beauty enthusiast, and our presence here will allow us to engage with customers in new and innovative ways, and we can’t wait to see the impact. We’re committed to continuing this momentum, and making Laneige the leader in the industry.”\n\nThe Secret to Skincare Magic\n\nLaneige isn’t just another skincare brand — it’s a hydration powerhouse! Specializing in moisture research, the brand has perfected the art of keeping your skin plump, dewy, and glowing. Think of their products as a tall glass of water for your skin, quenching its thirst and giving you that lit-from-within glow.\n\nSally Lee, Brand General Manager, Laneige India, shared the brand’s vision: “It’s exciting to see the response we have received for the brand in the last 5 years. The brand offers unique products for Indian consumers to experience, and we aim to connect with a broader audience interested in exploring these skincare offerings.”\n\nIt's skincare lineup is like a superhero squad for the face — each product bringing something unique to the table. From their iconic Water Sleeping Mask that works magic while sleeping, to the Lip Sleeping Mask that’s become a bedside staple, the products are designed to hydrate, repair, and protect the skin.\n\nMini explains the brand’s appeal: “Korean brands like Laneige are catching on fast in India because they bring something fresh and effective to the table. Our products, especially the sleeping masks, are a hit because they deliver visible results — hydration, glow, and all the things that make you look like you’ve just walked out of a K-drama!”\n\nSephora x Laneige: What’s Next?\n\nWith Laneige now in the Sephora fold, the brand is set to conquer the Indian skincare market like never before. Already present in eight Sephora stores across the country, the brand is on a mission to expand its reach even further. Mini gives us the inside scoop: “Our expansion plans include further collaborations with multi-branded stores like Nykaa, Tira, and of course, Sephora.” But what about the idea of standalone brand stores in India? Not so fast. Banerjee explains, “We are still trying to figure out the Indian market. Though customers love us, we need some more time for that matter.”\n\nLaneige’s appeal in India isn’t just a flash in the pan. It’s no surprise that cities like Delhi and Mumbai are leading the charge, but the love for the brand is spreading fast to Tier I and Tier II cities too. What’s driving this trend? The answer is simple: K-beauty is the new cool, and Laneige is at the heart of it.\n\nPaul Lee shares his thoughts on the brand’s traction in India: “Metros, of course, Delhi, Mumbai, Northeast, and even the Tier I and Tier II cities are showing a very fast-paced uptake. K-beauty is trending all over the world, and especially in India. We recently collaborated with Sara Tendulkar as our brand ambassador, and she’s working very well for us. Her dewy and glowing skin is a perfect match for the brand's brand ethos.”\n\nAnd let’s not forget the Northeast — a region that’s becoming a hotbed for K-beauty lovers. Laneige’s popularity here is partly due to the region’s deep connection with Korean culture, from K-pop to K-dramas, making it the perfect playground for the brand's skincare innovations.\n\nPaul Lee is optimistic about Laneige’s future: “Globally, Laneige’s partnership with Sephora has been very strong and extensive. With Sephora India, we have just started, but I strongly believe that we have a lot of success stories globally. I believe we will also soon be able to become the number one skincare brand in Sephora India as well.”\n\nComing from a business family involved in small enterprises in Nagra, Ishendra Agarwal pursued his bachelor's and master's degrees at IIT Kanpur. Afterward, he joined BCG as a management consultant. During his time in the corporate world, particularly within the jewelry segment, he observed that India, being the world's second-largest consumer of jewelry, had a significant market gap. Most jewelry brands in India, including Tanishq, Kalyan, Malabar, CaratLane, and BlueStone, focus on fine jewelry priced above Rs 30,000. This high price point makes it challenging for women to purchase and wear such jewelry regularly, whether for office wear or small gatherings.\n\nIn contrast, international brands like Pandora and Mejuri offer fine jewelry at more accessible price ranges, with average order values between Rs 12,000 - 15,000. This observation highlighted a need for a fine jewelry brand in India that provides quality pieces at a more affordable price point, allowing women to purchase jewelry frequently without worrying about significant expenses.\n\nInspired by this insight, he founded GIVA to fill this gap in the market. “Our goal is to create a brand where women can effortlessly buy beautiful, fine jewelry without having to consider substantial savings or budget constraints. Whether through a quick visit to a store or a few clicks online, we aim to make fine jewelry accessible and enjoyable for everyday wear,” he said.\n\nNationwide Store Expansion\n\nCurrently, the brand has approximately 130 stores operating across India, with about 50 percent of them located in Bengaluru and Delhi – Bengaluru has 32 stores, and Delhi has 34 stores. The remaining stores are spread across other Tier I cities like Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata, and Hyderabad, as well as Tier II cities such as Dehradun, Indore, Lucknow, and Kanpur.\n\n“Our expansion strategy focuses on increasing our offline presence significantly. We aim to establish at least 50 to 60 stores in Bengaluru and Delhi alone. Simultaneously, we plan to deepen our reach in other metro and Tier I cities while expanding our footprint in Tier II cities. Our goal for the next two years is to be present in about 60 cities across India, with a total store count of approximately 300,” stated Agarwal.\n\nDigital-Offline Balance\n\nGIVA’s approach to online channels leverages widespread access to mobile phones and the internet, aiming to create brand awareness primarily through digital platforms. This remains its primary focus. Conversions, however, can occur both online—through its mobile application and website—and offline. This is the essence of its customer acquisition strategy in the D2C funnel.\n\nAdditionally, the brand is present on various marketplace channels, including Amazon, Myntra, Nykaa, Nykaa Fashion, and Tata CLiQ, which contribute significantly to its sales.\n\n“Currently, online channels and these marketplaces account for 60 percent of our sales, while offline sales, which we began two years ago, contribute 40 percent of our revenue. We anticipate this to shift to a 40-60 split in the next two years, favoring offline sales,” he asserted.\n\nGIVA also utilizes its mobile application to provide various services to its customers. For instance, if a woman purchases jewelry and wants lifetime replating, she can easily arrange it via the app. The app also offers access to digital warranty and authenticity certificates, and it serves as a convenient platform for its loyalty program. This is how the brand integrates its mobile application and website into its overall strategy.\n\nQuick Commerce Entry\n\nGIVA has recently ventured into Quick Commerce, launching about a month ago on platforms like Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart. This initiative has been performing exceptionally well, particularly during special events like Akshay Tritiya, Mother's Day, and Father's Day. On these occasions, there is a noticeable spike in demand as customers seek fine jewelry for same-day gifting.\n\n“We have become a popular choice for last-minute gifts, as many people don't plan their gifts days in advance and often make the decision on the same day. Quick Commerce provides a convenient solution for these spontaneous purchases, making it easy for customers to select and receive a fine jewelry product swiftly,” explained Agarwal.\n\nExpanding Product Portfolio\n\nCurrently, GIVA is focusing on silver as a primary metal and has expanded into lab-grown diamonds set in 14-carat and 18-carat gold. It launched its lab-grown diamond collection six months ago, and it is now available in 60 of its stores. In silver collection, the brand offers a wide range of earrings, pendants, rings, and bracelets.\n\n“We are also expanding into categories like toe rings, anklets, and nose pins. Additionally, we are focusing on kids' and men's jewelry, recognizing that fine jewelry makes an excellent gift for children.” He noted.\n\nMoreover, it is working on launching GIVA signature perfumes, featuring five to six floral notes, designed to provide a unique and memorable GIVA experience. This new product line is currently being developed.\n\nInfluencer-Driven Awareness\n\nThe brand uses social commerce primarily to create awareness rather than drive transactions. Its strategy involves collaborating with numerous influencers and micro-celebrities to generate content and build brand visibility. Each month, over 2,000 influencers post about GIVA on platforms like YouTube and Instagram.\n\n“Our social commerce efforts focus on several key areas. We create awareness about specific categories, highlight the presence of our stores in various regions, and promote new collections, especially around significant events. For instance, we recently launched a silver Rakhi line for Raksha Bandhan, featuring both standard silver Rakhis and personalized options where you can have your brother's or sister's name engraved on the Rakhi. This multifaceted approach helps us reach a wider audience and keep them informed about our latest offerings,” highlighted Agarwal.\n\nTech-Enhanced Experience\n\nTo improve the consumer experience, the brand utilizes several technological advancements. First, its virtual try-on feature available on its app allows customers to see how certain products will look on them, enhancing their shopping experience. Second, it integrates online and offline channels to provide a personalized shopping experience.\n\nAdditionally, the company is incorporating technology into its customer support to offer faster responses. Automated systems can handle common queries efficiently, reducing the need for human intervention and speeding up response times.\n\nDesigner Collaborations\n\nGIVA actively collaborates with multiple designers to keep its designs fresh and fashionable. About six months ago, the brand partnered with European designer Lea Schroeder to launch the \"Love in Paris\" collection. Following that, it collaborated with Bhumi Pednekar five months ago, who worked with its design team to create a new collection. More recently, GIVA teamed up with a Turkish designer to introduce the \"Wings of Wonder\" collection.\n\n“These collaborations are central to our strategy, as our goal is to set fashion trends in India or bring the latest international trends to India as quickly as possible. We are committed to staying at the forefront of fashion through these dynamic partnerships,” explained Agarwal.\n\nRemarkable Revenue Growth\n\nGIVA has been experiencing impressive growth, with a year-on-year increase of 90 to 100 percent. Last year, the brand achieved approximately Rs 250 crore in revenue, and this year, it is closing at around Rs 450 crore.\n\nThe brand has also recently ventured into franchising, which has been highly successful. “Our franchising model involves franchisees investing in the store while we handle operations. Franchisees manage employees and sales, adhering to our established protocols, while our team oversees store operations to ensure consistency and quality,” he stated.\n\n“Our long-term target is to reach Rs 1000 - 1500 crore in revenue within the next four to five years,” he added.\n\nREAD MORE: India’s Jewelry Market Poised for Explosive Growth, Projected to Reach $145 Bn by FY28\n\nStrategic Global Expansion\n\nGIVA currently has a store in Sri Lanka that is performing well, and it plans to continue its presence there, albeit at a measured pace.\n\n“In the next one to two years, we aim to expand into Sri Lanka further, as well as explore opportunities in Singapore, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. These regions will be our focus for international expansion,” he concluded.\n\nThe rum has been a favorite drink for Indians for decades. Have you ever wondered where these best rum brands originate?

Platform constraints and high costs have made it challenging for them to compete with larger e-commerce giants. However, the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is poised to change the game with its innovative interoperable QR code. Currently in its alpha phase, this tool enables sellers to generate unique QR codes that customers can scan using an ONDC-registered buyer app, such as magicpin and Paytm. This initiative is set to expand across the entire network following successful initial testing.\n\n\"Today marks a transformative moment in Indian commerce,\" declared T Koshy, MD & CEO, ONDC, during the launch event for the QR code. \"ONDC’s interoperable QR code breaks down the barriers that have held small businesses back. Now, every seller has the power to reach customers digitally, just like the e-commerce giants. It’s a massive leap towards an open, inclusive, and democratized digital marketplace.\"\n\nEmpowering Sellers with Simple Technology\n\nThe beauty of this technology lies in its simplicity and potential for far-reaching impact. Sellers can display their QR codes anywhere — on storefronts, products, marketing materials, or social media — instantly connecting with customers both offline and online. For consumers, it means unparalleled convenience: a quick scan with any QR scanner app or ONDC Buyer Apps links them directly to the seller’s online store through their preferred buyer app.\n\n\"Think of the local shopkeeper, the street vendor, the artisan — they can now be discovered and patronized by anyone, anywhere,\" Koshy emphasized. \"This isn't just a new feature; it's a catalyst for economic growth and digital inclusion. Millions of businesses will come online, creating new opportunities and driving India’s digital economy forward. Just think of the possibilities!”\n\nA Game-Changer for Small Businesses\n\nBefore ONDC’s interoperable QR code, sellers were either not online because of demand generation costs or were having to pay a high revenue share. Now, with this game-changing tool, they can drive their own growth in affordable ways. From the last two years, since its launch, ONDC has been empowering a diverse set of merchants and service providers, from kirana stores to restaurant owners to fashion B2C clients. The key advantage of the QR code is its power to the brand owner or the shop owner. \"Imagine you are a kirana store owner. One of the challenges you are facing today is that your target segment is your neighborhood. Nobody's going to come from a few kilometers or tens of kilometers away. So, we want to have all of them aware of your existence,\" Koshy explained. \"Today, everyone knows they can come to you, but what happens in the next generation? By the time the next generation is there, they won't even know where your store is. They'll all do online shopping. So, how will you expand and why would they come to you?\"\n\nThe ONDC QR code allows small merchants to publish themselves through social media, WhatsApp, or leaflets, saying, \"I exist, look at this scan, this QR code.\" Many big brands, when they advertise their products, will put a QR code saying \"scan with any ONDC application”. The nearest store will show it to you because they don't have to go and tie up with each of them separately. They have to only make sure that they're there.\n\n\"This way, the shops together with the big brands, will make their existence more relevant in the digital world; otherwise, they will become irrelevant,\" Koshy noted. \"In developed countries like the US, as e-commerce gets more prevalent, small shops or as we say, mom-and-Pop stores are becoming irrelevant. They have no discoverability unless they follow the rules and regulations of a few existing platforms. Here, they have discoverability and existence of their own. Not everyone will succeed, but they have to innovate with good products and offers. This definitely gives them a power in their hand, and the QR code is one more tool.\"\n\nA Cost-Effective Solution\n\nThe QR code costs the sellers nothing! They don't need to give any special price to any application. They can generate it and give it to everybody, and they can scan it.\n\nFor the food services and restaurants onboarded on ONDC, this new model offers significant advantages. In the existing platform world, there are only one or two options, giving certain privileges. Now, with many seller aggregators, the service is only to make the seller visible to the network, with demand coming from buyer applications. This reduces the rent-seeking capability and profit maximization possible with only a few players, making it more competitive for sellers. Restaurants, for example, can make themselves visible in the ONDC network at a low cost. \"If you're a digitized restaurant, you can be visible in the ONDC network, let everybody else bring demand, and use it. It becomes a no-brainer decision to be part of it and benefit from it,\" Koshy elaborated.\n\nThe new network-wide logistics are hyperlocal, available at the most competitive price, matchable to any price that even the established players will offer. This makes it easier for small businesses to compete, offering good food and competitive logistics, representing themselves at a lower cost.\n\nEncouraging Broader Participation\n\nThe post-budget reaction to the reduction of TDS on e-commerce to 0.1% and the establishment of export hubs has been positive. \"These steps are encouraging for both sellers and startups. My ecosystem consists of merchants, innovators, and startups, and if they're happy, I'm happy,\" Koshy remarked.\n\nThe goal is ambitious. In the next one or two years, the target is to have 500 million ONDC QR codes out there in the country. This ambitious target is reflective of the aspirations of the Indian government and the startup sector. The beauty of ONDC is that it works with a lot of seller aggregators who target specific segments. There are innovations even in small cities, where simple tools will help onboarding easier.\n\nIndia is considered as the third largest automobile industry.
