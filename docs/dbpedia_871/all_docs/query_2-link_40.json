        "text": "Joyalukkas, a global jewelry retail chain, has opened its second showroom in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIt is located at LuLu Hypermarket in Capsquare Mall, Jalan Munshi Abdullah, Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThis is part of the chain’s mega expansion plan for this financial year. The showroom was inaugurated by Rosmah Mansor, wife of Mohamed Najib Razak, prime minister of Malaysia, in the presence of John Paul Alukkas, executive director, Joyalukkas Group, local dignitaries and VIPs.\n\nJoyalukkas’s first foray into Malaysia was in 2014, with the opening of the biggest jewelry showroom at Jalan Masjid India in the heart of Kuala Lumpur.\n\n“When we first arrived in Malaysia, the response from the public was simply overwhelming. We set out to offer the best jewelry shopping experience to the residents and they have rewarded us over and over again with their eager patronage,” says Joy Alukkas, chairman and MD, Joyalukkas Group.\n\n“We are very grateful to the wonderful people of Malaysia and look forward to delivering more choices, better value and an even higher standard of customer service at our second showroom,” said John Paul Alukkas, executive director, Joyalukkas Group.\n\nJoyalukkas opened the new showroom in time for the Mega Winnings campaign, where customers get the chance to win four diamond necklaces and up to 2 kg gold till Aug. 14.\n\nJoyalukkas Jewellery is currently a 120 plus showroom chain network spread across 11 countries. The brand, which is one of the world’s largest jewelry retail chains, is part of a multi-billion dollar global conglomerate with varied business interests.\n\nThe “world’s largest” jewelry retail chain has presence in Singapore, London, the UAE, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and India, and will soon open in two new countries.\n\nThe showroom features over one million collections and designs in gold, diamond, precious stones, platinum and pearl."
