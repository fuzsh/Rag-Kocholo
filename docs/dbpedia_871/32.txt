Joyalukkas Jewellery has opened its latest showroom at Hassan in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.

This is part of the expansion plan of the ‘global giant’ planned for this financial year.

“This financial year, we are committing ourselves to expand rapidly across India, the GCC and a couple of new world markets. This compliments my vision to make the brand accessible and available to every jewelry lover in the world,” said Joy Alukkas, chairman and MD, Joyalukkas Group.

Joyalukkas Jewellery is also scheduled to expand its footprint in Karnataka with another showroom at Davangere during March.

The brand is part of a multibillion dollar global conglomerate having varied business interests, which include money exchange, fashion and silks, luxury air charter, malls and realty, aside from jewelry.

The retail chain has its presence in Singapore, London, the UAE, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and India.

“Our plan for Joyalukkas Jewellery in this financial year (2015-2016) includes strengthening our presence across various parts of India, and opening our showrooms in cities and towns that we feel are ready for the Joyalukkas experience,” said Joy Alukkas.

The showrooms will feature over one million collections and designs in gold, diamond, precious stones, platinum and pearl. The collections will be a mix of traditional, contemporary and international designs that have become “popular around the world.”

“Other than this, trust is an integral part of the Joyalukkas offer, which is managed through ensuring assurance and peace of mind to customers on their jewelry purchase. The retail chain manages this through strict adherence to quality and internationally accepted standards, for example, 100 percent IGI certified diamonds, BIS Hallmark gold jewelry and PGI certified platinum jewelry. Joyalukkas, is also the first and only ISO 14001-2006 & ISO 9001-2008 certified jewelry retail chain,” he added.
