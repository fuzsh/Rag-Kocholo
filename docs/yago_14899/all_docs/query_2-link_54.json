        "text": "Henry І inherits the crown of the Franks and along with that, an abandoned country surrounded by enemies. To strengthen France’s positions, he concludes an alliance with Yaroslav the Wise, the ruler of the powerful state of Kiev Rus, by marrying his daughter Anna. This marriage leads France to prosperity, as Anna inspires Henry for good and great actions. Using weapons and diplomacy side-by-side, they defeat enemies, extend their territory and bring peace and calm to it.\n\nHowever, happiness cannot last forever. King Henry I dies, leaving Anna as a regent with their first son Philip. But will the future king of France be able to forgive his mother that the people love “The White Queen” more than him?"
