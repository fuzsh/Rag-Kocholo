Isabelle Huppert is \"ravishingly erotic\" (Newsday) as Madame Bovary in acclaimed director Claude Chabrol's masterful adaptation of Gustave Flaubert's novel. An uncompromising portrait of a woman desperate to escape her bourgeois life, Madame Bovary is a \"triumphant [and] provocative\" (Rolling Stone) tale of passion and destruction. The beautiful and fiercely Emma Bovary (Huppert) is trapped in a loveless marriage with a small-town physician (Jean Francois Balmer). Possessed for a hunger for life and love, Emma pursues scandalous affairs with passionate abandon. But when her equally spending triggers a financial crisis, she must gain control over her behavior before she completely destroys the lives of those around her. Madame Bovary VFR 381 Claude Chabrol: French (English subtitles) 1991. It's a mixed blessing, but Claude Chabrol's 1991 adaptation of Madame Bovary can at least claim a proper French pedigree in its fidelity to Flaubert's literary classic, it's certainly more faithful than Madame herself, played here with icy determination by Isabelle Huppert. Frustrated, repressed, and desperate for any opportunity to break free of her numbing marital bondage, the wife of Dr. Bovary finds her chance in the affections of Rodolphe Boulanger (Christophe Malavoy), but she is too shallow and too selfish to sense his lack of commitment. And as Flaubert's tale unfolds (along with Chabrol's dryly accurate interpretation), Emma Bovary finds herself caught in a snare of her own design. This tragedy of self-absorption--a universal study of indulgence, ignominy, and fatal discontent--should prove potent for anyone who feels the oppression of an unhappy marriage, but it's also a compelling study of boredom as an internal phenomenon. Huppert conveys exasperation, passion and self-destruction in equal measure, yet she barely alters passive, blank expression; her performance is too cold to ignite the resonant themes of Flaubert's novel. All in all, one wonders if Chabrol--seemingly uneasy with costume drama--is being too respectful of Flaubert at the cost of his own directorial mastery. This is a prestigious and worthwhile adaptation, but like one of Dr. Bovary's patients, it's being bled to the point of paleness and fainting. The result is a literate film that's \"good for you,\" even though it may not be entirely good. --Jeff Shannon Madame Bovary VFR 307\n\nJean Renoir: French (English subtitles) B&W. 102 mins. 1934. Jean Renoir's French version of Flaubert's great novel stars Valentine Tessier 'as an anomalous creature, half swan, half goose.

According to Greek legend, Theseus returned from war with the Minoans on Crete to become king of Athens and took Phedre, the daughter of the vanquished King Minos to be his wife. Phedre fell in love with the King's son, Hippolyte, but he did not return the love, prefering one his own age. Phedre caused her husband, the King, to be wrongly jealous of his son and prayed to Neptune to destroy him. When Hippolyte was in fact killed after fighting a sea monster, Phedre killed herself in remorse. Starting with this basic legend, Jean Racine, the dramatist considers 'the most French of French writers', adapted the story for the stage in 1677. His pure Alexandrine verse, realistically portraying the characters, has lead to a continuing appreciation of his works. Marie Bell, thought of so highly by the contemporary French author and statesmen Malraux, possesses a classic background in keeping with the purity of the legend and tradition of the French adaptation. A member of the Comedie Francaise since 1928, she began her film career in 1924 and was a remarkably a well-preserved 68 years old when she undertook the portrayal of this tragic figure. Her decoration for valor in the French Underground during the war was the Legion of Honor, awarded by General DeGualle himself. Phedre therefore, comes with a French pedigree as authentic as the Eiffel Tower. A powerful film of human emotion in the style of a classic Greek tragedy. Cinema for the intellect indeed.\n\nPickpocket VFR 373\n\nRobert Bresson: French (English subtitles) B&W 75 mins. 1959.
