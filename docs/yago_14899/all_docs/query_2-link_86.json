        "text": "The Kinorob production company (Ukraine) and Dada Films (France) continue their work on a joint historical drama under a working title ‘Anna of Kyiv’ (‘Anna de Kiev’) about 11th century Ukrainian princess Anna Yaroslavna who became the queen of France.\n\n“At the moment, we are finalizing the work on the script and approving the filming crew,” Kinorob said on its official page on Facebook.\n\nThe filming is to start in the summer or autumn of 2018 in France and Ukraine. Theatrical release of the movie is scheduled for 2019.\n\nThe picture is based on a historical novel “Anne de Kiev. Reine de France” by French writer Jacqueline Dauxois.\n\nThree-time Cesar winner Yves Angelo will take the director’s seat, while Ukraine’s Serhiy Mykhalchuk will be director of photography.\n\nProducer Oksana Melnychuk said that Anna Yaroslavna’s figure still attracts interest and remains a subject of heated historical debate in contemporary Europe.\n\n“Our film aims to give a comprehensive answer as to the origins of the Princess of Kyiv – Queen of France,” she said.\n\n“However, our main goal is to create a good historical film for a broad audience in Ukraine, France and other countries,” another producer of the film, Yehor Olesov, said."
