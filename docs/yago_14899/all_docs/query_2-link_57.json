Oh, and if you're wondering why the random URL, I just got tired of typing \"masterbydirector.html\" over and over and made it something easy. It was meant to be temporary, but I'm too used to it now to switch back.\n\nAlso, I've begun adding approximate ratings for films from 1995-2001, when I was allotting either stars or letter grades. The rating is obviously a best guess, but trust that it's reasonably close to what I thought at the time. Those ratings are preceded by [~]."
