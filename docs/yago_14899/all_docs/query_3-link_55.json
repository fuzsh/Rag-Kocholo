        "text": "Some people don’t age. Take film the legendary film director and Academy Award-winning screenwriter Costa-Gavras, for example. He turned 90 last month and still is very bright, sharp, and energetic as someone half his age—or even younger. He’s an icon of activist cinema and one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, and since his debut as a film director with “Compartiment tueurs” (1965), he’s been one of French cinema’s most prolific filmmakers who has worked on both sides of the Atlantic—with much success, appreciation, and critical acclaim.\n\nHis early and formative years in his native Greece, though, when he was exposed to mostly Westerns and Errol Flynn movies, were very rough. After the German occupation of Greece during World War II, his father, a resistance fighter suspected of communism, was imprisoned during the country’s civil war, which lasted up until 1949, and as a result, Costa-Gavras was denied the right to higher education.\n\nAn avid moviegoer in his native country, he attempted to immigrate to the U.S. but, in the climate of the McCarthy era, he was denied a visa, so then he left for Paris in 1953, where he enrolled at the Sorbonne to study literature. After seeing Erich von Stroheim’s screen classic “Greed” (1924) at the Cinémathèque française, he realized that film was not just entertainment, it was also a way to say something substantially, and he switched to the French film school IDHEC (Institut des hautes études cinématographiques).\n\nA French resident ever since and filmmaker since the mid-1960s who from time to time was lured to Hollywood and so far made six English-language films—working with actors such as Jack Lemmon, Dustin Hoffman, John Travolta, Debra Winger, Jessica Lange—he gained international recognition and worldwide fame with his second feature, the fast-paced political thriller “Z” (1969) which, among others, earned two Academy Awards (‘Best Editing’ and ‘Best Foreign Language Film’). His career was launched, and over the years, Mr. Gavras became one of the screen’s most prominent filmmakers, making films often associated with political subjects.\n\nHis first English-language film, “Missing” (1982), earned him an Academy Award in the category ‘Best Writing—Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium,’ based on the book “The Execution of Charles Horman: An American Sacrifice” (1978) by Thomas Hauser. Jack Lemmon starred as a father in search of his missing son in a Latin American country.\n\n“Missing” (1982, trailer)\n\nHis other—all highly acclaimed—English-language films are “Hanna K.” (1983), “Betrayed” (1988), “Music Box” (1989), “Mad City” (1997), and “Amen” (2002).\n\nMr. Gavras is the recipient of some of the most important film awards. Not only did he win an Oscar for “Missing,” but also a BAFTA (screenplay “Missing”), a Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival (“Missing”), and two Césars (screenplays “Amen.” in 2003, and “Adults in the Room,” 2019). He was also nominated twice for an Academy Award for “Z” (1969) in the categories ‘Best Director’ and ‘Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.’\n\nIn 1968, Mr. Gavras married Michèle Ray, a former Chanel model who became a war correspondent and spent three weeks in Vietcong captivity during the Vietnam War; their two children, Julie Gavras and Romain Gavras, are also filmmakers. Since the mid-1970s, Mrs. Gavras has co-produced several of her husband’s films.\n\nBecause of the highly successful Romy Schneider Exhibition in Brussels, Mr. Gavras came over to the Cinema Palace in Brussels to introduce a screening of “Clair de femme” (1979, a.k.a. Womanlighting”) starring Romy Schneider, followed by a Q & A. That same evening, I got to sit down with the legendary filmmaker to talk about his craft as a screenwriter and film director. The interview was conducted in French.\n\n“Clair de femme” (1979, a.k.a. “Womanlighting,” trailer)\n\nThe Romy Schneider Exhibition will also welcome other guests in the upcoming days. On Tuesday, April 4, Sarah Baisini, Romy Schneider’s daughter, will present “César et Rosalie” (1972) to the audience. Two days later, on April 6, the Belgian and international actress Lubna Azabal will explain what makes “Le vieux fusil” (1975) such a precious film, and on April 12, it’s director Joachim Lafosse’s turn as he will present “L’enfer d’Henri-Georges Clouzot” (2009).\n\nMr. Gavras, how do you remember Romy Schneider and working with her when you made “Claire de femme”?\n\nI met her when Henri-Georges Clouzot was preparing “L’enfer” [1964, a.k.a. “Inferno”] for her, and she told me, ‘If you ever become a film director, I would like to make a film with you.’ Years later, when I was a film director, we met again, and we still wanted to make a film together. After I had read Romain Gary’s novel “Clair de femme” [1977], I thought it would make a great film, and I contacted her again. That’s how it all began. “Clair de femme” is a love story, but at the same time, it’s not. It could be a love story one day, but you don’t know for sure. It’s about two people who are unhappy and very unfortunate; that brings them together. So they get together and interact. They love each other in a certain way, but there’s no passionate love. It’s up to the audience to decide how they can work it out, and that’s what interested me: how can those two characters in pain connect with the audience? So it’s not a traditional love story. Yves Montand agreed to play the part right away, and when I suggested Romy play Lydia’s role, she asked me, ‘Do you want to make this film for Montand, or me?’ I told her, ‘For both of you, and also because of the story.’ When we shot the film, we got along very well, and so did Yves and Romy, as they had worked before already [“César et Rosalie,” 1972]. Romy was a very professional and skilled actress; she asked me a lot of questions and often wrote me notes when we finished shooting in the evening—also while I was preparing a scene, for example—and it was fascinating to see how she was absorbed by the story. I don’t know if she also wrote notes to other film directors; maybe she was attracted to this story in a particular way. But it was fascinating to work with her. It was quite different with Yves Montand because we had made several films together and knew each other very well.\n\nWhat made Romy Schneider so exceptional as an actress?\n\nShe was very interested in the story. After we had finished shooting in the evening, everybody went home, and she wrote me those notes that she gave me the next day. She was intrigued by the story and wanted to play her character perfectly—the way she moved, behaved, and talked, she knew how to portray her character.\n\nActors often have different acting styles and working methods. Is there also a difference between European and American actors that you should know about as a film director before you start shooting?\n\nNot really. The only difference is the language [laughs]. When you’re on set and talk with the actors about a scene and how it should play out, in the end, it’s the director who needs to make the final decision. I always make sure the actors know that from the beginning; even before they accept their part, I tell them that’s how I work. And they’re always okay with it—always. For me, that’s the best way to collaborate with them. Very often, actors come up with very interesting ideas or look at it from another angle, and that’s why I always like to listen to what they have to say. Actors are intelligent and sensible, and most of the time, they don’t think about their ego or how the audience will judge their role or performance; they simply focus on their character. Some actors like to play their roles the way the audience likes to see them. They keep on repeating themselves, so those characters are not valuable to the story you’re telling. They create and recreate their personality. John Wayne, for example, appeared in several great films, but he was always John Wayne in every film he made. Jean Gabin too, but he was very subtle. He played Gabin, and if necessary, he tried to adjust the story in terms of his character. But very often, he played Gabin because that’s what the people who went to the movies wanted to see.\n\nIs it correct to say that you are a European filmmaker who makes world cinema?\n\nI would instead consider myself a French film director because I learned my craft in France. On the other hand, I don’t make films like French film directors do because coming from Greece, I have a different background and another view since I don’t have this traditional historical French background. So those two identities define who I am and the films I make: I am French, but when I first arrived in France, my intellectual background was different, and that’s something you can’t change. It’s in your head, in your brain, in your heart. It’s not like if you’d take off your coat and put on another one. It doesn’t work like that.\n\n“Z” (1969, trailer)\n\nWas it a big step for you when you made your American films in the 1980s and 1990s? Because that’s yet another culture and another film industry.\n\nNo. They asked me early on to make films in the U.S., even after my third film, “Z” [1969]. But I always turned them down until I did my first American film, “Missing” [1982], because that story interested me tremendously. It was set in Chili, a country that I knew well. So I told the producer I would do it, on two conditions. I would write the screenplay, with an American because it was written in English, and I also wanted to do the entire post-production in France—and they agreed. That’s how I worked on every American film I did. We shot the films in America—in New York, Chicago, etc.—and I also wanted to work without any interference, so I could make the film that I wanted to make. If they wanted the film to look American, they didn’t need me; they could have hired an American director. So I wanted total autonomy—screenplay, editing, even casting. Of course, you talk about the editing, casting… When I was casting for “Missing,” I told them I wanted Jack Lemmon. And they said to me, ‘Why would you want Jack Lemmon? He makes comedies!’ I explained to them why I wanted him, but they didn’t like the idea. I insisted, and then the producer said, ‘Let’s see how that works.’ Later on, they were delighted, and Jack Lemmon won several awards for his role. So that’s how I made my four American films.\n\nYou just talked about your screenplays. You’re not only an august film director but also a very accomplished screenwriter. Is it easy, or maybe very logical, to combine both?\n\nI can’t separate them. If you’re only a film director, you’re like an illustrator. You illustrate someone else’s story. If you like to tell a story that touches you, you need to work on the screenplay as well—maybe in collaboration with others, although I did a number of screenplays and adaptations on my own. But mostly, I like to work with someone else so you can exchange ideas and broaden your view. But I don’t like to make films that I didn’t write. When you write, you create the characters, and that’s crucial when you want to tell a story. So I need to be involved in that stage as well.\n\nWhen you’re so closely involved with the whole project, when do you know that a scene you just shot is perfect and the way you want it…\n\n…that’s exactly why writing is so crucial to me. When I’m working on a screenplay, I imagine what I’ll be shooting, the characters, the location—everything. I take precise notes and talk about them with the actors. Depending on what the actors suggest, things can change, or the location might look different. But generally, the film is even made before I start shooting. And when I’m shooting, I think about editing because that’s when you write the film for the last time. That’s the final version. So the screenplay can be adjusted along the way, depending on the actors, the cinematography, and the circumstances. But the basic concept—why you want to make the film and what you are telling—that doesn’t change. A screenplay is like a plan designed by an architect; you can move the furniture in the living room, but you can’t move the walls in a building—meaning that the work of a film director and an architect is done on paper. It would be best if you were consistent in what you do with it when you’re shooting and editing.\n\nWhat film of yours would you consider the most difficult one you have done so far?\n\n[Pauzes]. Each one has its own difficulties, but if you want me to give an example, there are two films, basically. The first one is “L’aveu” [1970, a.k.a. “The Confession,” about the 1952 show trial in Prague against Rudolf Slánský and other leading members of the Communist Party in former Czechoslovakia]. The screenplay that I had written with Jorge Semprún was fine, but when we began casting, several actors objected because they considered it anti-communist, and others did not approve of the story. When that happens early on, you must be very convinced of what you’re doing and the film you’re trying to make. And then you have to reassure the actors about the characters they’re playing—some evil characters because of their beliefs and opinions—and that was difficult. The other film was “Betrayed” [1988, with racism as the film’s main issue, based upon the terrorist activities of an American neo-Nazi supremacist and his group]. That film portrayed an image that a lot of people couldn’t believe it existed in the U.S. They thought it was a European prejudgement that was wrong, totally anti-American. I traveled a lot with screenwriter Joe Eszterhas in Nebraska, Idaho, among others, and we met those people. We talked and discussed with them. Those people were very kind and very sympathetic, but when you talked to them about Afro-Americans or Jews, they reacted in a very negative way. It didn’t affect the shooting process of the film, but emotionally it had an impact; you had to deal with it when you made the film.\n\nAnd what was the most fun set you ever worked on?\n\n[Laughs]. You know, I always want people to have fun when we’re making a film. Also, when it’s a difficult film or a serious subject we’re talking about, I want the cast and crew to have fun and make them work in an atmosphere where everybody gets along as friends. There may be tensions, but those moments are very rare. So I like this friendly and relaxed atmosphere where everybody enjoys what they’re doing. Once they’re all on board and have made their suggestions, it’s very important that they realize they’re all working towards one common goal, to get the director’s view up there on the screen. So far, it always worked out, and we had a great time. I made several films with Yves Montand, and he always had a lot of fun on set. He got along with everybody and was very patient, courteous and was amused if the cinematographer asked him to wait a moment because he needed to adjust the lights, for example. Before I became a director, I was an assistant director and worked with some directors that were very tough on their crew; at the end of the day, you were glad it was over. That’s something I always wanted to avoid.\n\nYou just mentioned Yves Montand. Do you remember the first time you met him?\n\nAbsolutely, also the first scene I did with him in my first film as a director [“Compartiment tueurs,” 1965]. The producers were very worried; it was my debut film as a director, and the cast included many big names [such as Yves Montand, Simone Signoret, Michel Piccoli, and Cathérine Allégret]. In the beginning, they didn’t think it was a good idea if I would direct that film. So they told me to work with this cinematographer, that editor… They were very worried; when we did the first scene, Yves Montand visited Simone Signoret, and his character met Simone Signoret’s character for the first time. It was an easy scene to shoot, and I was a little bit too late. But Montand told the producer, ‘Just let the director do his job.’ He created mutual trust, which is very important for a director. “Compartiment tueurs” was very well received, and gradually we became good friends.\n\nIn the 1970s, you made only a few films and had a four-year-hiatus between “Section spéciale” [1975, a.k.a. “Special Section”] and your next film, “Clair de femme” [1979]. Was there any particular reason for that?\n\nI worked on various interesting ideas or adapted a book and tried to finance them, but your next film should be something different when you tell a human and social story. You don’t want to repeat yourself. So it’s not always easy to find the right project. Also, I never want to make a film just for the sake of making a film. I want any new film to be relevant and interesting, and it needs to affect and touch me. Also, I was offered screenplays that I turned down because they didn’t interest me.\n\nWith your experience as a veteran filmmaker, what is, in your opinion, the strength of film?\n\nFilm is a perfect way to communicate with the audience; you can tell the audience something you want to share with them. And if they want, they will respond. Sometimes they don’t respond because they’re not interested, but cinema is a perfect way to dialogue with others. In all the great films that have been made, you see what society is like, and what happens in the world; you see characters and what happens in their lives. It can also be done in comedy—look at Charlie Chaplin—but what he shows in “Modern Times” [1936] still happens today. That makes a film a very powerful and essential tool to tell a good story.\n\nCinema Palace, Brussels\n\nMarch 30, 2023\n\nIn 2018 Mr. Gavras was the recipient of the European Film Academy’s Honorary Award\n\nFILMS\n\nCRÉSUS (1960) DIR – SCR Jean Giono ASST DIR Costa-Gavras, Bernard Paul PROD Andrée Debar CAM Roger Hubert ED Monique Isnardon, Robert Isnardon MUS Joseph Kosma CAST Fernandel, Marcelle Ranson-Hervé, Rellys, René Génin, Miguel Gamy, Edouard Hemme, Paul Préboist, Jeanne Pérez\n\nTOUT L’OR DU MONDE, a.k.a.
