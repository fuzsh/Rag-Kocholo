But, against all odds, he survived. Long incapacitated, he was unable to convince anyone that he was who he claimed he was, everyone certain that Chabert was dead. And so he was: \"rebuffed for ten years by his wife, by the law, by the whole social world\", with his wife even remarrying in the meantime (her second marriage, to Count Ferraud, one where: \"her vanity was satisfied as much as her passion\").\n\nFinding his way eventually to an ambitious young lawyer, Derville -- who happens to be his widow's lawyer -- Chabert makes his case, and Derville is sufficiently convinced to agree to try to get him out of this fix. The law being the law, his estate having been settled, and Countess Ferraud now having two children by her new husband there is no easy solution, but Derville figures he can get the parties -- the former Mme. Chabert is essential to the proceedings -- to come to some arrangement. But Chabert's idealism (and/or naïveté‎), and his wife's deviousness, complicate matters.\n\nUltimately, the new society will not have the Napoleonic hero. By the end, the resigned Chabert acknowledges:\n\nI am no longer a man, I am number 164, room 7.\n\nWith some colorful detail -- from Derville's late-night work habits to Chabert's choice of domiciles as Derville works on revivifying him -- as well as that great premise, Colonel Chabert is a quick but thoroughly entertaining read. One might wish for more embellishment -- much more could be made out of this story -- but even as is it packs a nice punch.\n\nAs part of Balzac's Comédie humaine several of the figures in Colonel Chabert are also familiar from other works in the series, and it's amusing to see, for example, Godeschal just starting his career here as a lowly third clerk in Derville's office.\n\nAn excellent and powerful little work.\n\n- M.A.Orthofer, 18 October 2013\n\n- Return to top of the page -\n\n:\n\nColonel Chabert:\n\nNew Directions publicity page\n\nFolio publicity page\n\nReclam publicity page\n\nColonel Chabert - translated by Ellen Marriage and Clara Bell\n\nReviews:\n\nBeauty is a Sleeping Cat\n\nFiction of the Known World\n\nHarriet Devine's Blog\n\nHis Futile Preoccupations\n\nDamian Kelleher\n\nTony's Reading List\n\nWorld Socialist Web Site\n\nHonoré de Balzac:\n\nHonoré de Balzac at books and writers\n\nOther books by Honoré de Balzac under review:\n\nThe Black Sheep\n\nA Harlot High and Low\n\nLost Illusions\n\nTreatise on Modern Stimulants\n\nBooks about Honoré de Balzac under review:\n\nPeter Brooks on Honoré de Balzac\n\nOther books of interest under review:\n\nJavier Marías' The Infatuations\n\nSee Index of French literature\n\nSee Index of Books Written Before 1900\n\n- Return to top of the page -\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nThe great French author Honoré de Balzac (1799-1850) is best known for his multi-volume 'Human Comedy'.\n\n- Return to top of the page -\n\n© 2013-2023 the complete review\n\nMain | the New | the Best | the Rest | Review Index | Links"
