It is based on the novel Le Colonel Chabert by Honoré de Balzac. Another film adaptation of the novel starring Raimu had been released 50 years earlier, during the German occupation of France.\n\nIn Paris, in February 1817, three years after the fall of the Empire, the lawyer Derville receives a visit from a shabbily dressed man. He claims to be Colonel Chabert, believed dead at the Battle of Eylau in 1807. He had contributed to the victory by leading a famous cavalry charge against the Russians.\n\nThe man tells how, waking in a mass grave surrounded by corpses, he survived his wounds.\n\nHe has returned ten years later and wishes to claim his title, to assert his rights and to live again with his wife, who has greatly increased the fortune she inherited from him. She, during his absence, has married Count Ferraud and had children.\n\nShe refuses to recognise her first husband. Derville agrees to help the colonel by proposing a settlement in which she will make a large settlement on Chabert if he agrees to divorce her and give up his claims. She refuses the proposed terms and tries to manipulate her ex-husband, asking him to declare his claim is fraudulent. Chabert, disgusted by her deceitfulness and the idea of him renouncing his name, abandons his claim.\n\nColonel Chabert finishes his life penniless and in an asylum, reminiscing on his last battle.\n\nGérard Depardieu : Amédé Chabert\n\nFabrice Luchini : Maître Derville\n\nFanny Ardant : Countess Ferraud\n\nAndré Dussollier : Count Ferraud\n\nDaniel Prévost : Boucard\n\nOlivier Saladin : Huré\n\nMaxime Leroux : Godeschal\n\nÉric Elmosnino : Maître Desroches\n\nGuillaume Romain : Simonin\n\nPatrick Bordier : Boutin\n\nClaude Rich : Chamblin\n\nJean Cosmos : Costaz\n\nJacky Nercessian : Delbecq\n\nAlbert Delpy : Maître Roguin\n\nRomane Bohringer : Sophie\n\nValérie Bettencourt : Julie\n\nJulie Depardieu : A maid\n\nDirection : Yves Angelo, assisted by Frédéric Blum\n\nScript : Yves Angelo, Jean Cosmos and Véronique Lagrange, from the novel by Honoré de Balzac\n\nProduction : Jean-Louis Livi and Bernard Marescot\n\nMusic : Régis Pasquier\n\nPhotography : Bernard Lutic\n\nEditing : Thierry Derocles\n\nScenery : Bernard Vézat (certain interior scenes filmed at Château de Bizy in Vernon, Eure)\n\nCostumes : Franca Squarciapino\n\nChâteau de Champs-sur-Marne (Seine-et-Marne)[2]\n\nChâteau de Bizy (Vernon, Eure)[3]\n\nChâteau de Bouges (Indre)[4]\n\nCairo Film Festival (Egypt)\n\nWon: Golden Pyramid (Yves Angelo)\n\nCésar Awards (France)\n\nNominated: Best Actor – Leading Role (Gérard Depardieu)\n\nNominated: Best Actor – Supporting Role (Fabrice Luchini)\n\nNominated: Best Cinematography (Bernard Lutic)\n\nNominated: Best Costume Design (Franca Squarciapino)\n\nNominated: Best First Work (Yves Angelo)\n\nNominated: Best Production Design (Bernard Vézat)"
