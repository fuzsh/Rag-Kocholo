Quit Staring at My Plate is a film dealing with topical issues, with a mature author approach, excellent acting performances, and is certainly one of the brightest examples of recent Croatian cinema.â\n\nRecognition for Best Minority Co-Production is presented to the film Train Driverâs Diary, directed by MiloÅ¡ RadoviÄ\n\nâFor a successfully realised insight into an authentic film world, carefully wrapped in black humour and impressive colour of photography, along with exceptional acting performances.â\n\nThe International Programme Jury: Petra GaloviÄ, Enid VidaÄek, Lucija MajnariÄ\n\nRecognition for Best Feature film in the International Programme Europolis - Meridians is presented to the film The Collector, directed by Aleksey Krasovskiy.\n\nâThe film successfully translates the vision of its demanding and risky concept. The pacing of editing provides dynamics for the dramaturgical solution of a single actor in the unity of place, time, and plot. A skillfully developed story stands out among stiff competition in a visually creative way.â\n\nRecognition for Best Short Film in the International Programme Euroshorts is presented to the film Ambivalent, directed by Keith Albert Tedesco\n\nâThe film sets forth a simple plot in an excellent way, playing with the timeline, fragmenting it and putting it back together as a puzzle that the viewer then reconstructs. Attractive photography and camera movement make the aesthetic of this film.â\n\nRecognition for Best Feature Film in the Cinema By the Sea Programme is presented to the film Getting Fat in a Healthy Way, directed by Kevork Aslanyan\n\nâIn a concise way, the film shows the problems of otherness and the judgment of today, looking at it through a humorous filter of an imagined world. Scenography and costume design stand out as visual means of emphasising the humour.â\n\nThe Student Programme and Short Pula Jury: Daria KerÅ¡iÄ, Rea BuÅ¡iÄ, Adnan BajroviÄ\n\nRecognition for Best Film in the Student Programme is presented to the film After Party, directed by Viktor Zahtila\n\nAWARD OF THE FEDEORA JURY\n\nThe Jury: Nenad DukiÄ, film critic, Ronald Bergan, film critic, Ondrej Biba, film critic, Natascha Drubek, film critic, Marijana JakovljeviÄ, film critic\n\nRecognition for Best Croatian Feature Fiction Film is presented to the film The Constitution, directed by Rajko GrliÄ\n\nRecognition for Best Minority Co-Production is presented to the film House of Others, directed by Rusudan Glurjidze\n\nAWARD OF THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMME JURY\n\nThe Jury: Jasna Ornela Bery, actress, Igor SaraÄeviÄ, film critic, and Jelka Stergel director of Festival of Slovenian Film\n\nGolden Arena for Best Feature Film is awarded to the film A Man Called Ove, directed by Hannes Holm\n\nGolden Arena for Best Short Film is awarded to the film Giraffe, directed by Janne Schmidt\n\nSpecial mention for short film in the International Programme is awarded to the film Dream a Little Dream, directed by Michael Iversen\n\nAWARD OF THE CROATIAN FILM CRITICâS ASSOCIATION\n\nThe OKTAVIJAN Award is presented to the film Quit Staring at My Plate, directed by Hana JuÅ¡iÄ, which received an average score of 4.66.\n\nGOLDEN GATE OF PULA AUDIENCE AWARD\n\nVoting for a film in the Croatian Programme screened in the Arena, the audience has awarded the Golden Gate of Pula Award to the film ZG80, directed by Igor Å eregi, which received an average score of 4.32.\n\n2.The Constitution, director Rajko GrliÄ - 4.29\n\n3.The Mystery of Green Hill, director Äejen ÄerniÄ - 4.25\n\n4.Train Driverâs Diary, director MiloÅ¡ RadoviÄ â 4.21\n\n5.

Golden Arena for Best Film is presented to the film Sieranevada, directed by Cristi Puiu\n\nâAn excellent tragicomedy with elements of a farce, in which the author creates a fresco of dynamic family relationships around the wake held for the father of a Bucharest family inside their apartment, dealing with politics, church, national past, and interpersonal relationship issues.â\n\n2. Golden Arena for best director is awarded to director MiloÅ¡ RadoviÄ for the film Train Driverâs Diary\n\nâA harmoniously and unobtrusively directed black comedy with an exceptional feeling for dramaturgical complexity and narrative pace.â\n\n3. Golden Arena for Best Acting Performance is awarded to Salomae Demuria for the role of Ira in the film House of Others, directed by Rusudan Glurjidze\n\nâAmong several female characters, the character of Ira stands out - she is a strong, determined woman, protector of her family, played by Salome Demuria with a lot of complex layers.â\n\nCROATIAN PROGRAMME - CROATIAN FILM\n\n1. The Breza Award for Best Debutant is presented to Äejen ÄerniÄ for her directing in the film The Mystery of Green Hill.\n\nâIn her directorial debut, based on the novel by Ivan KuÅ¡an, written almost 60 years ago, Äejen ÄerniÄ successfully creates a charmingly infantile whole with an impressive atmosphere of carefree childhood.â\n\nJULIUS MEINL COFFEE joins in the Breza Award for Best Debutant by presenting this yearâs winner with 7,000 kuna.\n\n2. Golden Arena for Best Sound Design is awarded to Martin SemenÄiÄ for the film A Brief Excursion, directed by Igor BezinoviÄ.\n\nâFor truthful and wholesome sound design in this valuable film. Everything you hear in The Brief Excursion - each whirr, music, dialogue - is done with rarely seen subtlety, in complete harmony with all of the other elements of the film.â\n\n3. Golden Arena for Best Make-Up is awarded to Bianka Å½ugelj and Tatjana TomiÅ¡iÄ for the film ZG80, directed by Igor Å eregi.\n\nâThe costume design is true to the 1980s look, especially in hairstyles. Especially flawless is the gradation of the different looks that the characters go through in various situations in a single day.â\n\n4. Golden Arena for Best Visual Effects is awarded to Pragma Video and Visual effects House for the film Anka, directed by Dejan AÄimoviÄ.\n\nâTop quality computer animation, rarely seen in Croatian film, creates a mystical world and the imagination of a girl called Anka.â\n\n5.

Golden Arena for Best Costume Design is awarded to Katarina PiliÄ for the film Quit Staring at My Plate, directed by Hana JuÅ¡iÄ .\n\nâThe costume is in contemporary accordance with the protagonists, contributing to the entire image of their social and spiritual state.â\n\n7. Golden Arena for Best Scenography is awarded to Petra Poslek and Iva RodiÄ for the film Goran, directed by Nevio MarasoviÄ.\n\nâThe scenography efficiently follows the screenplay and directing approach of the film filmed at carefully chosen idyllic landscapes and seemingly pleasant interiors of snow-covered Gorski Kotar and the seaside in Opatija. The polarity of the scenography puts it in effective counterpoint to the film story.â\n\n8. Golden Arena for Best Music is awarded to Alen Sinkauz and Nenad Sinkauz for the film Goran, directed by Nevio MarasoviÄ.\n\nâMusic is one of the key elements of the film directed by Nevio MarasoviÄ. In the story about people caught in the chasm dividing their wants and possibilities from their ambitions and reality, the combination of evergreens and the theme song, with the variation in motives of threatening, muffled thunder, efficiently builds the dramatic tension.â\n\n9. Golden Arena for Best Editing is awarded to Hrvoje MrÅ¡iÄ for the film Agape, directed by Branko Schmidt.\n\nâBy awarding the editing in this film, the Jury emphasises the rhythmical and dramaturgical effort in using editing as an artistic film process to upgrading the narrative element of this film. The fact that this effort is a success confirms the âinvisibilityâ of editing, both as a technical, and as a dramaturgical process.â\n\n10. Golden Arena for Best DOP is awarded to Branko Linta for the film The Constitution, directed by Rajko GrliÄ.\n\nâFor the subtle and unobtrusive atmosphere providing a visual framework in which the story of this film can be skilfully developed.â\n\n11. Golden Arena for Best Supporting Actor is awarded to Dejan AÄimoviÄ for the role of Ante SamardÅ¾iÄ in the film The Constitution, directed by Rajko GrliÄ.\n\nâIn each scene of the film The Constitution he appears in, Dejan AÄimoviÄ wins over with positivism, altruism, and easy humour as the character of Ante SamardÅ¾iÄ with his top quality acting skills.â\n\nMONTECRISTO ZAGREB, MODIANA STORES joins in the Golden Arena for Best Supporting Actor, presenting the winner with a GIFT CARD for clothing at MODIANA STORES.\n\n12. Golden Arena for Best Actor is awarded to NebojÅ¡a Glogovac for his role of Vjeko Kralj in the film The Constitution, directed by Rajko GrliÄ.\n\nâThe character of a Zagreb intellectual, marked by his family history, minority sexual status, and ethnic majority affiliation is portrayed by NebojÅ¡a Glogovac with distinctive subtlety. Glogovac skilfully balances the humour and bitterness, cynicism and empathy, and masculinity and femininity.â\n\nKOTKA konfekcija Krapina joins in the Golden Arena for Best Actor with a high quality custom made menâs suit (KOTKA brand), presented to this yearâs winner.\n\n13. Golden Arena for Best Supporting Actress is awarded to Arijana Äulina for her role of Vera in the film Quit Staring at My Plate, directed by Hana JuÅ¡iÄ.\n\nâÄulina has used her whole acting apparatus and demeanour to build a very much alive, well-rounded, and rarely convincing character of a mature and submissively possessive wife and mother, eluding all stereotypes.\n\nMONTECRISTO ZAGREB, MODIANA STORES joins in the Golden Arena for Best Supporting Actress, presenting the winner with a GIFT CARD for clothing at MODIANA STORES.\n\n14. Golden Arena for Best Actress is awarded to Mia PetriÄeviÄ for her role of Marijana in the film Quit Staring at My Plate, directed by Hana JuÅ¡iÄ.\n\nâIn her debutant role, PetriÄeviÄ confidently and suggestively creates all the visible and hidden layers of the young protagonistâs character, her simultaneous crudeness and tenderness, bitterness and devotion, compassion and misanthropy, and her desire to escape even though she is aware that escape is impossible.â\n\nARGENTUM HRVATSKI LANAC SREBERNARNICA joins in the Golden Arena for Best Actress, presenting this yearâs winner with a set of traditional jewellery.\n\n15. Golden Arena for Best Screenplay is awarded to Rajko GrliÄ and Ante TomiÄ for the film The Constitution, directed by Rajko GrliÄ.\n\nâA topical and intriguing âlove story about hateâ. The screenwriters face the characters, who are relatable, well-rounded, and set deep in the Croatian everyday life, with their own prejudice, insecurities, and even hatred in a very human, emphatic, and witty way; leading them to meet other, different people, who are on the opposite pole in terms of ethnicity, ideas, ideologies, and world views, as well as leading them towards mutual tolerance and acceptance.â\n\n16. Golden Arena for Best Directing is awarded to Hana JuÅ¡iÄ for the film Quit Staring at My Plate.\n\nâFor inspired orchestrating of all creative elements of this moving film, which confirms the authorâs honest need to deal with the distinct and burdened world of her characters in every frame.â\n\n17. Grand Golden Arena for Best Festival Film is awarded to the film A Brief Excursion, directed by Igor BezinoviÄ, by production house Studio Pangolin, produced by Igor BezinoviÄ.\n\nâAn inspired and modern existentialistic allegory, which keeps unobtrusively growing from frame to frame. Like the protagonists of BezinoviÄâs film, who decide to go on an adventure to search for the old Gradina, where rare beauty is supposedly hidden, the viewer who decides to delve into this film will be met with distinctive, broad understanding. A skilful crossover of fictional and documentary elements, upgrading the concrete with the abstract, and real with the surreal.â\n\nAddiko bank presents Igor BezinoviÄ, director of A Brief Excursion, winner of the Grand Golden Arena for Best Festival Film at the 64th Pula Film Festival, with 30,000 kuna.\n\nTeleking presents the producer of the film A Brief Excursion, winner of the Grand Golden Arena for Best Festival Film at the 64th Pula Film Festival, with a set of post-production services: image processing and mastering in the amount of 10,000 EUR.\n\nThe Jury of the Croatian Programme also gives a special mention to the film Dead Fish, directed by Kristijan MiliÄ, produced by Eurofilm and co-produced by the Association for Theatre and Film - Oktavijan, for its production enthusiasm and harmonious synergy among film professionals from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nWe would like to thank everyone who has helped in the organisation and realisation of the 64th Pula Film Festival.\n\nMinistry of Culture of Republic of Croatia, Croatian Audiovisual Centre, City of Pula, Istria County, Croatian National Tourist Board, Tourism Office Pula, Istria Tourist Board\n\nHrvatski Telekom - Festival Partner"
