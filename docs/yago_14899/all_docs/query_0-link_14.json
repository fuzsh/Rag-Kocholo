        "text": "The French movie Le colonel Chabert was shown in the U.S. as Colonel Chabert (1994). Yves Angelo directed it. It's the story of a brave, highly decorated cavalry officer in Napolean's army, who is left for dead on the battlefield. He leads a horrible existence for ten years, until he finally manages to return to France. In his absence, his wife has remarried, and now has two children. She also has all of his fortune. Who is going to believe Chabert's story's? Chabert finds someone who believes him. It's the almost superhuman Attorney Derville. The problem is that Derville is also the attorney for Chabert's former wife.\n\nGerard Depardieu plays Colonel Jabert. He is a consummate actor. We know it and Director Angelo knows it. Fanny Ardant is the former wife. When she's on screen, you can't take your eyes off her. She isn't beautiful in the classic Hollywood way; she's beautiful in the French way. She has strong features that tell us that she's competent and capable. When Chabert asks Derville to describe her, he uses just one word--superb.\n\nBelieve it or not, I think the best acting is displayed by Fabrice Luchini as Derville. His part is complex, because Derville is an unlikable character. He's snobbish, arrogant, and absolutely certain about his professional talents. Luchini becomes Derville. It's worth seeing the movie just to watch him act.\n\nWe saw this movie on the small screen. (Actually on--gasp--VHS.). It worked very well. Colonel Chabert has a so-so IMDb rating of 7.0. It's better than that. Find it and watch it.\n\n4 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.\n\nPermalink"
