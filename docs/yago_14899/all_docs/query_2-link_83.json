        "text": "According to production notes in AMPAS library files, the screenplay, originally titled Beyond Suspicion, was completed in early 1991, and purchased by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. Director Andrew Wolk was hired in Apr 1991, and collaborated with screenwriter Jim Piddock on script revisions. The story originally took place in Los Angeles, CA, but Wolk and executive producer Samuel Goldwyn, Jr., decided to set the picture in Palm Beach, FL. On 9 Oct 1991, the Palm Beach Post announced that producer David V. Picker won unanimous approval from the town council for a four-day shoot. The production crew was the first to film the interior of the Breakers Hotel, which became its headquarters. Other Florida locations included West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Coral Gables, Gulf Stream, and the Everglades. As noted in the 28 Oct 1991 Palm Beach Post, the crew was expected to continue working in Palm Beach County for an additional thirteen days. The Twin Lakes High School building served as the sheriff’s office, and the South County Courthouse in Delray Beach was being considered for the courtroom scene. Local actors were currently auditioning for speaking roles. The cast arrived in Oct 1991, during which actress Lorraine Bracco researched her role by discussing the character’s emotional makeup with a psychiatrist, and acquainting herself with “local socialites,” many of whom were hired as background actors for the party sequence. Actors James Belushi and Tony Goldwyn traveled with Palm Beach County sheriff’s deputies in their pursuit of drug dealers and murderers for character research. Wolk rehearsed the cast for two weeks, and continuously revised the screenplay, reportedly with assistance from Belushi, Bracco, and Goldwyn, as stated in the 6--13 Jan 1992 W. Bracco, a former model, solicited clothing donations from Yves St. Laurent and Fernando Sanchez for her character’s costumes, and was loaned $1.2 million in jewelry from Van Cleef & Arpels. On 29 Oct 1991, HR announced the 4 Nov 1991 start of the forty-day shoot, budgeted at $7 million. Nine days into filming, the 13 Nov 1991 HR reported that the title was officially changed to Traces of Red.\n\nOn 4 Sep 1992, DV noted that the film’s 2 Oct 1992 release was delayed until the following month, due to changes in release schedules from other studios, all of which were offering pictures targeting similar demographics.\n\nTraces of Red opened 11 Nov 1992 in New York City and Los Angeles to generally tepid reviews, exemplified by the 9 Nov 1992 Var, which described the film as “a dramatic failure but an entertaining exercise in camp.”\n\nThe Mar 1993 Box reported a 27 Oct 1992 preview screening, held in Palm Beach at the Royal Poinciana Theatre, to benefit Red Cross Florida Hurricane Relief. Approximately 600 people attended.\n\nEnd credits include the following statements: “The producers would like to thank the following: Chuck Elderd, Palm Beach County Film Office; Elizabeth Wentworth, Broward County Film Office; Bob Ferrell, Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Department; The Breakers Hotel, Palm Beach; Thomas Wicky & Gretchen DeWeese; Jesse Newman; Barry and Renate Florescue; Marie Cantin; Mary Mahoney; Bang & Olufsen; Irving Galleries Fine Arts; Sulton; Dynascan-Cobra Telephones; Baderbrau Beer; Cocoon Pure Silk Bedding; Group Image, Inc.; Yves Saint Laurent Parfums; Kaypro; Sunbeam Leisure Products Co.; Gas Grill; Palm Beach Motor Cars, Inc.; Commodore Business Machines”; “Filmed on location in Palm Beach and Broward Counties, Florida.”\n\nLess\n\nIn Palm Beach, Florida, mortally-wounded homicide detective Jack Dobson recounts the events leading to his demise. Surrounded by friends and family at an elegant restaurant, Jack’s older brother, Michael Dobson, announces his candidacy for the Florida State Senate. On his way home, Jack offers a ride to waitress Morgan Cassidy, unaware that he is being watched by his lover, thewealthy widow Ellen Schofield. After spending the night with Morgan, Jack testifies in court against Tony Garidi, owner of an “escort service,” who is on trial for the murder of prostitute Kimberly Davis. Prior to entering the courtroom, Jack receives an anonymous note, which reads: “A dead whore is nothing new, go into court and you’ll die too.” Jack dismisses the rhyme as a threat from Garidi, and testifies that he happened to be present when the gangster entered the victim’s hotel room, moments before she was killed. Afterward, Jack finds his car vandalized and blames the defendant’s brother, Rudy “Minnesota” Garidi. However, after questioning Minnesota, they realize he has no knowledge of the note or the vandalism. Jack returns home to spend the evening with Ellen Schofield, who leaves early the next morning after discovering Morgan Cassidy’s panties in the bedroom. Jack receives another note, which says: “You only do it to hurt me more, live by your lies, die by my cord.” The envelope bears a red lip print on the seal, suggesting a woman may be the author. That evening, Morgan Cassidy is strangled by an unseen intruder, who smears her mouth with red lipstick. Aware of Jack’s tryst with the victim, police lieutenant J. C. Hooks questions him about the possibility of the killer being a romantic rival. Jack assures the lieutenant that Ellen Schofield is not “the jealous type,” and Morgan’s musician boyfriend has been in Europe for several months. The police laboratory determines the brand and shade of lipstick, and identifies the daisy wheel used to type the threatening rhymes, noting that the capital letters “D” and “L” are damaged. Jack and his partner, Steve Frayn, visit Ellen Schofield under the pretext of a social call. Steve engages Ellen in conversation while Jack sneaks away to test her typewriter. As the detectives leave, Jack kisses Ellen to obtain a lipstick sample. Although Ellen’s lipstick matches that on the victim, her typewriter contains no damaged letters. At a nursing home, Michael Dobson admonishes Jack for not spending more time with their invalid mother, Louise, while Jack argues that she is oblivious to her surroundings. Later, during a fundraising event for Michael’s campaign, Jack questions guests about the death of Ellen Schofield’s husband and learns that he died of natural causes. Satisfied that Ellen is above suspicion, Jack pursues another lead after receiving the message: “Now you know how much it hurts, prepare to die for Gloria Wurtz.” Jack informs Steve that the late Gloria Wurtz was his first-grade teacher. He accused her of locking him in a closet, putting lipstick on him, and molesting him. J. C. Hooks assigns Steve Frayn to question the teacher’s son in nearby Key West, Florida, and orders Jack to see a psychologist to address his childhood trauma. Before Steve leaves town, Ellen Schofield attempts to seduce him, then sends him home to his wife, Beth. Upon arriving in Key West, Steve discovers Ellen in the adjoining hotel room. After they make love, Ellen Schofield admits that she merely wants to “corrupt” him, and leaves before morning. Steve ends the investigation upon learning that Gloria Wurtz’s son died a year earlier. Meanwhile, Jack connects the murders of Kimberly Davis and Morgan Cassidy, noting that both were found naked and smeared with the same lipstick. After Steve’s return, he and Jack question the imprisoned Tony Garidi, who swears that on the day of the murder, Kimberly Davis cancelled her meeting with him for another appointment. When Jack mentions that he was at the hotel bar with his brother that day, Steve Frayn suspects Michael Dobson’s involvement, infuriating Jack. Steve Frayn and Jack are summoned by Beth Frayn, who delivers an urgent message from Ellen Schofield, and confronts them with a box of women’s clothing she found in the garage. Identifying the clothes as property of the murder victims, Jack fears that Beth may be in danger and takes her to his “country house,” a modest cabin on a neighboring island. Steve Frayn drives to Ellen Schofield’s home and finds her dead, then follows a car leaving the scene, driven by Michael Dobson’s bodyguard, Tommy Hawkins. Upon arriving at Michael’s house, both Tommy and his employer claim ignorance of Ellen Schofield’s murder. However, Michael Dobson reveals that Jack was molested by his mother, Louise Dobson, but was instructed to blame Gloria Wurtz to protect the family. Michael implies that Jack may be the killer and takes Steve Frayn to his brother’s home, where they find the incriminating typewriter, the murder weapon, and a typed confession. Realizing Beth may be the next victim, Steve Frayn drives to the country house and shoots his partner. Michael guards his family’s reputation by arranging a hero’s funeral for Jack. Later, he visits Amanda, another of his brother’s girl friends, and tries to strangle her. Steve Frayn bursts through the front door and holds Michael at gunpoint. Jack enters from the garden, revealing his death was a hoax. He asks to be alone with Michael, then berates his brother for trying to frame him. Michael reacts by grabbing Jack’s gun and shooting himself in the head. Steve comforts his partner while police examine the crime scene.\n\nLess"
