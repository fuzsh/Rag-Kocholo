Studiocanal is co-producing and handles all rights, including international sales.\n\nAngel is known for directing socially-minded dramas such as “La Vie Parisienne” and “Skin of Men Heart of Beast.”\n\n“Primaire” reflects Studiocanal’s desire to back more film directed/written by women or dealing with female protagonists. The company has just released Maiwenn’s “Mon Roi,” which premiered in Cannes and won Bercot a prize, in France."
