His lifelong friend, Franck (played by real cop-turned writer/actor/director Olivier Marchal), works in the drug squad, doing some drug trafficking of his own on the side. When Franck gets in too deep, Mat must take matters into his own hands. A solid and entertaining noir carried by convincing performances by Depardieu, Marchal and Asia Argento.\n\nA Hero's Choice\n\nM\n\nRomania, Germany, Belgium, 2014\n\nGenre: Comedy, Drama, War\n\nLanguage: English\n\nDirector: Bogdan Dreyer\n\nStarring: Gerard Depardieu, Harvey Keitel, Laura Morante\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nThis comedy about the dark side of human nature is set in a small Eastern European village during WWII. When a child finds the body of a German soldier, the local authorities need to find the culprit quickly, or else they will all be shot by the Nazis. The town leaders, led by Father Johanis (Harvey Keitel), appeal to the village eccentric (played effortlessly by Depardieu), and promise a hero's funeral if he claims responsibility for the murder. It's a race against time, worth watching for Keitel and Depardieu, both in fine form.\n\nSource: SBS Movies\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nSBS On Demand: Romain Duris round-up\n\nSBS On Demand: Isabelle Huppert double bill\n\nSBS On Demand: Alain Delon double bill\n\nSBS On Demand: 10 must-see French movies"
