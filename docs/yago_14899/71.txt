Ten years after he was left for dead at Napoleon’s Battle of Eylau, a man claiming to be Chabert returns to claim his life and identity.

“[Director Angelo] succeeds in elevating Chabert’s mystery beyond questions of fact and into the subtle, debilitating compromises of eternal warfare, whether it is conducted in the bedroom, in the courtroom or on the battlefield.” - Janet Maslin, New York Times
