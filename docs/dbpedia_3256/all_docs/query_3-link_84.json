        "text": "On June 30, 2021, Jerry Keefe was named the 11th Fernie Flaman Head Men’s Hockey Coach in Northeastern history and is in his 14th season overall on Huntington Avenue.\n\nIn the first three seasons with Keefe at the helm, Northeastern set a 59-42-9 record. Last season, Keefe saw the Huskies to back-to-back Beanpot titles, claiming their fifth title in six tournaments. During the 2021-22, the Huskies saw one of their best seasons in recent history, going 25-13-1 overall, 15-9-1 in Hockey East play to claim the program’s first-ever Hockey East regular season championship. Keefe’s first three seasons produced five All-Americans, the first-ever two-time Richter Award winner, the first-ever two-time Hockey East Best Defensive Forward, a Hockey East Player of the Year, a Hockey East Goaltender of the Year and several other Hockey East accolades including the Bob Kullen Award for Hockey East’s Coach of the Year in 2022.\n\nKeefe spent the previous seven seasons as associate head coach helping the Huskies to three straight Beanpot championships, three NCAA tournament appearances, two Hockey East titles and one Belpot championship in the Friendship Four in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Additionally, Northeastern’s power play was No. 1 in Hockey East at nearly 27 percent under Keefe’s tutelage two seasons ago.\n\nAlong with his role at Northeastern, Keefe was selected to coach with the United States National Junior Team from 2018-20, helping Team USA win the silver medal in 2019. During the World Junior Championships, Keefe worked with fellow Huskies Tyler Madden (LA Kings), Cayden Primeau (Montreal Canadiens) and Jordan Harris (Montreal Canadiens).\n\nBefore Northeastern, Keefe established himself as a notable name in the New England college hockey ranks, making stops as an assistant coach at UMass Boston (2006-07) and a head coach at Westfield State (2008-09), before his two seasons as an assistant coach at Brown University (2009-11). He resurrected Westfield State’s hockey program and led the Owls to a runner-up finish in the Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference (MASCAC) for the first time since 1981.\n\nKeefe was a four-year center at Providence College from 1996 to 2000 and finished with 98 points (30 goals, 68 assists) in 102 career games. After leading the Friars with 52 points in 37 games, the highest single-season point total in 15 years, Keefe was honored as New England’s Most Improved Player (1998-99). Upon graduation, Keefe’s professional hockey career started at the end of the 2000 season with the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks (AHL) and Trenton Titans (ECHL). He spent five seasons playing professional hockey, including a pair of seasons in Europe, before retiring in 2004.\n\nA native of Billerica, Mass., Keefe was a three-time All-Scholastic player and a member of a state championship team at Matignon High School, earning Massachusetts Player of the Year honors in 1993. Prior to enrolling at Providence, Keefe also played for the U.S. National Under-17 Team that won a silver medal in Tokyo, Japan in 1994 and the U-16 team that went 4-0 in Switzerland.\n\nCOACHING CAREER\n\n2021-22 Hockey East Coach of the Year\n\n2021-22 Clark Hodder Award (New England D1 Coach of the Year)\n\nAssociate Head Coach for seven seasons, assistant coach for three seasons at Northeastern\n\n24 players drafted to the NHL\n\n13 All-Americans\n\nNo. 1 power play in Hockey East at 26.9% (2020-21)\n\nClaimed five Beanpot Championships, a Belpot Championship, two Hockey East Championships and a Hockey East Regular Season title\n\nFour NCAA Tournament appearances\n\nHelped to recruit and coach the second most winningest class in program history (86 wins)\n\nServed as Assistant Coach on Team USA at the World Junior Championships, winning a silver medal in 2019\n\nCoached at Brown (2009-2011)\n\nCoached at Westfield State and UMass Boston\n\nPLAYING CAREER\n\nFour-time letterwinner at Providence College (1996-2000)\n\nFinished with 98 points in 102 games (30-68-98)\n\nNew England Most Improved Player\n\nPlayed in the AHL, ECHL, and Europe\n\n1993 Massachusetts Player of the Year\n\nTwo-time USHL All Star, Omaha Lancers MVP (1995)"
