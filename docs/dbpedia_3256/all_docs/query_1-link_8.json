        "text": "Kylie Bridenhagen\n\nMen's Ice Hockey 3/23/2019 10:36:56 PM\n\nUW-Stevens Point Captures Men’s Ice Hockey National Championship\n\nSTEVENS POINT, Wis.--University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point captured the NCAA Division III Men’s Ice Hockey Championship with a 3-2 overtime victory over Norwich University (Vt.) at K.B. Willett Arena on March 23.\n\nThe national championship is the sixth in program history (1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 2016) and 10th captured by a Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC) program. NCAA Division III titles have been won previously by UW-Eau Claire (2013), UW-River Falls (1988, 1994) and UW-Superior (2002). National Association of Intercollegiate Athletic championships were won by UW-Superior in 1976, UW-River Falls in 1983 and UW-Eau Claire in 1984. Since the 1982-83 academic year, WIAC schools have combined to secure 117 NCAA Division III team championships.\n\nSteven Quagliata recorded the game-winning goal at 15:13 of the overtime period. UW-Stevens Point finished the 2018-19 campaign with a 29-0-2 record, the first unbeaten national champion in NCAA Division III history.\n\nSophomore Steven Quagliata scored 15:13 into overtime as UW-Stevens Point extended its program record unbeaten streak to 31 games (29-0-2) and become the first-ever unbeaten national champion in NCAA Division III history.\n\nSophomore goaltender Connor Ryckman picked up his 26th win of the year, also a program record for single-season victories by a goaltender. He made 26 saves, including four in overtime.\n\nAfter a pair of scoreless periods, the Pointers broke the ice early in the third. Just 3:31 into the period, Danny Kiraly fired a shot from the boards that freshman Jordan Fader tipped in for a 1-0 lead. Ryan MacKellar also had an assist on the goal.\n\nJust over a minute later, Colin Raver made it 2-0 in favor of the Pointers. Tanner Karty and Zach Zech picked up assists on the goal.\n\nAt 7:01 of the third, Norwich (23-5-3) got on the board. Coby Downs slipped one past Ryckman to cut UW-Stevens Point’s lead to 2-1.\n\nDowns scored again at the 12:15 mark to tie the game at 2-2. Both teams had chances late in regulation and through the first part of overtime.\n\nAt 15:13 of overtime, Quagliata skated down the near boards and flipped a wrister top-shelf for the game winner. Stephan Beauvais and Raver were credited with assists on the game-winner.\n\nNorwich goaltender Tom Aubrun stopped 42 shots.\n\nThe Pointers racked up a number of honors after the championship. Senior Tanner Karty was named Most Outstanding Player of the Championship. Ryckman and Raver also earned all-tournament team honors.\n\n# # # # #"
