        "text": "Former Spartan netminder Mike Gilmore is in his fourth season as a volunteer assistant coach. Gilmore, who previously served at his alma mater in the same role, will work primarily with the team's goaltenders.\n\nGilmore epitomized the term \"student-athlete\" in his playing career, as he earned Academic All-Big Ten honors three times and CoSIDA First-Team Academic All-America honors as a senior, as well as the Bill Burgess Outstanding Senior Award, the Blue Line President's Award as the team's top scholar-athlete, as well as the Amo Bessone Award for combining athletic and academic achievement with community involvement. He also won the 1992 Chester Brewer Award, awarded to MSU Senior achieving academic and athletic excellence.\n\nOn the ice, he played in 64 career games and ranks eighth all-time at MSU with a 2.91 career goals-against average and 10th in career shutouts (4). Gilmore was a part of two CCHA regular-season and tournament championships (1988-89, 1989-90), and three NCAA Tournament teams, which included Frozen Four trips in both 1989 and 1992. He joined the Spartan team as a walk-on, but quickly earned a scholarship and served as an alternate captain as a senior.\n\nGilmore was a member of the US National team in the summer of 1991, earning a gold medal at the US Olympic Sports Festival.\n\nA selection of the New York Rangers in the 1990 Supplemental Draft, Gilmore played two seasons of professional hockey with the Erie Panthers (ECHL) and Binghamton Rangers (AHL) after leaving MSU. He served as a volunteer assistant coach at his alma mater from 1994-96, helping lead MSU to a pair of NCAA Tournament bids and a 53-25-4 overall mark. During that time, he earned his M.B.A. from MSU's Eli Broad College of Business.\n\nGilmore is currently the Director of Investment Strategy at Delta Dental of Michigan and President of Red Cedar Investment Management in East Lansing. He currently serves as a volunteer on several non-profit committees and boards within the community, and coaches his two youngest children in the sport of hockey.\n\nGilmore's wife Jennifer is a former team physician for the MSU hockey program and is an assistant professor in the Department of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine at MSU in addition to continuing in her role as a team physician in the Athletic Department. The couple resides in DeWitt with their children Abigail, a figure skater, and hockey players Ryan and Isabelle."
