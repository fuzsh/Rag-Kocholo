Two more championships were won under recently retired head coach Red Berenson in 1996 and 1998.[2]\n\nMichigan has had many successes as a program including a record-setting number of championships, total championship tournament appearances, and consecutive tournament appearances. Players from the program have earned numerous honors, professional championships, international championships, individual statistical championships, team and individual records.

The program has dozens of National Hockey League alumni and over twenty current players. Coach Red Berenson retired after the 2016-17 season.
