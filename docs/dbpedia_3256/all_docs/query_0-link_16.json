The Fighting Hawks had an overall record of 26-11-2--tied for the fourth-highest win total in the NCAA this season.\n\nSubscribe To FloHockey For More Hockey Games And News\n\nAnalyzing The Hobey Baker Top 10\n\nHere Are The 16 Teams That Made The NCAA Men's Hockey Tournament\n\nMichigan had an overall record of 21-14-3 this season.

Michigan hockey and Michigan State hockey can play in the NCAA Men's Hockey Tournament. Both the Wolverines and the Spartans are in the Maryland Heights Regional and will play each other if each wins their respective first-round matchups.
