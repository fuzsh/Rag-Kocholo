        "text": "Ten coaches who have enjoyed on-ice success in 2018-19 have been named finalists for the Spencer Penrose Award, given annually to the CCM/AHCA Division I Men’s Ice Hockey Coach of the Year. Voting will be conducted prior to this year's Frozen Four in Buffalo, and the winner will be announced on Wednesday, April 10.\n\nFROZEN FOUR: Meet the teams competing in this year's tournament\n\nThe nominees represent any coach who won or shared Coach of the Year honors in his conference this past season, along with coaches whose teams have advanced to the NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey semifinals. This year, the AHCA Awards Committee has also nominated Greg Powers of Arizona State, an independent program that qualified for the NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament for the first time ever. Of this year's finalists, three are past recipients of this award: Mike Hastings of Minnesota State (2015), Nate Leaman of Providence (2011 while at Union College) and Scott Sandelin of Minnesota Duluth (2004).\n\nFour schools have captured four Penrose awards: Boston College, Boston University, Denver and New Hampshire. The four Denver awards were presented to four different coaches: Murray Armstrong, Ralph Backstrom, George Gwozdecky and 2017 recipient Jim Montgomery. Four schools claim three winners: Clarkson, Colorado College, Harvard and North Dakota. Three different coaches received those awards at Clarkson and CC. For Clarkson: Bill Harrison, Jerry York and Bill O'Flaherty. For Colorado College: Cheddy Thompson, Tony Frasca and Don Lucia. From this year's finalists, no coach from AIC, Arizona State, UMass, Ohio State or St. Cloud State has ever won this award.\n\nHOW TO WATCH: Schedule, scores from the 2019 NCAA tournament\n\nThe Spencer Penrose Award is named in memory of the Colorado Springs benefactor who built the Broadmoor Hotel Complex, site of the first 10 NCAA championship hockey tournaments. The actual award will be presented at the AHCA Coach of the Year Banquet in Naples, Florida, on Wednesday evening, May 1.\n\nThe CCM AHCA Coach of the Year Awards are sponsored by CCM Hockey and chosen by members of the American Hockey Coaches Association. CCM is the legendary hockey brand dedicated to the endless pursuit of performance by delivering game-changing, head-to-toe innovative hockey equipment to players worldwide.\n\nBRACKET TIME: Get your bracket set for the Frozen Four\n\n2018-19 AHCA Men’s Ice Hockey Spencer Penrose Award Finalists (CCM/AHCA Division I Coach of the Year)\n\nDavid Carle, Denver, Frozen Four Coach\n\nGreg Carvel, UMass, HE Coach of the Year and Frozen Four Coach\n\nMike Hastings, Minnesota State, WCHA Coach of the Year*\n\nCasey Jones, Clarkson, ECAC Hockey Coach of the Year\n\nEric Lang, AIC, Atlantic Hockey Coach of the Year\n\nBrett Larson, St. Cloud State, NCHC Coach of the Year\n\nNate Leaman, Providence, Frozen Four Coach*\n\nGreg Powers, Arizona State University\n\nSteve Rohlik, Ohio State, Big 10 Coach of the Year\n\nScott Sandelin, Minnesota-Duluth, Frozen Four Coach*\n\n* Past Spencer Penrose Award Winner\n\nSee below for the full history of Spencer Penrose winners."
