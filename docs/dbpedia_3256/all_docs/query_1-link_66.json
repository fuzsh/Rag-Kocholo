        "text": "Duke Athletics\n\nFootball August 07, 2024\n\nACC Places Eight Receivers on the 2024 Biletnikoff Award Preseason Watch List\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (theACC.com) – The Tallahassee Quarterback Club (TQC) Foundation, Inc., the Florida-based creator and sponsor of the prestigious Biletnikoff Award, released the 2024 Biletnikoff Award Preseason Watch List on Wednesday, August 7. Eight receivers from the Atlantic Coast Conference were named to the watch list.\n\nThe eight receivers that represent the ACC include Elic Ayomanor of Stanford, Samuel Brown of Miami, Kevin “KC” Concepcion of NC State, Malachi Fields of Virginia, Jacolby George of Miami, Caullin Lacy of Louisville, Jordan Moore of Duke and Xavier Restrepo of Miami.\n\nThe Biletnikoff Award annually recognizes the college football season's outstanding FBS receiver. Any player, regardless of position (wide receiver, tight end, slot back, and running back) who catches a pass is eligible for the award. As such, the Biletnikoff Award recognizes college football's outstanding receiver, not merely college football's outstanding wide receiver. Moreover, the Biletnikoff Award is a single season, not career, award.\n\nThe name Biletnikoff is synonymous with the term receiver. Fred Biletnikoff, a member of the pro and college football halls of fame, was a consensus All-America receiver at Florida State University and an All-Pro receiver for the Oakland Raiders. He caught 589 passes for 8,974 yards and 76 touchdowns in his 14-year Raiders career from 1965 through 1978. Fred was the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XI.\n\nThe semifinalists, finalists and award recipient are selected by the highly distinguished Biletnikoff Award National Selection Committee, a group of 600 prominent college football journalists, commentators, announcers, Biletnikoff Award winners and other former receivers. Foundation trustees do not vote and have never voted. For a list of voters, please see BiletnikoffAward.com/voters.\n\nReceivers are frequently added to the watch list as their season performances dictate. Actual, not potential, performance is the basis for inclusion on the Biletnikoff Award Watch List.\n\nThe Biletnikoff Award candidate eligibility and voting criteria, transparently explicit and detailed, are available for review at BiletnikoffAward.com/criteria.\n\nACC Representatives on the 2024 Biletnikoff Award Preseason Watch List:\n\nName, School, Class, Position\n\nJordan Moore, Duke, Graduate Student, WR\n\nCaullin Lacy, Louisville, Senior, WR\n\nSamuel Brown, Miami, Fifth-Year Redshirt Junior, WR\n\nJacolby George, Miami, Senior, WR\n\nXavier Restrepo, Miami, Fifth-Year Senior, WR\n\nKevin “KC” Concepcion, NC State, Sophomore, WR\n\nElic Ayomanor, Stanford, Redshirt Sophomore, WR\n\nMalachi Fields, Virginia, Senior, WR\n\nACC Football Notes\n\nThe ACC is the Conference of Quarterbacks, with the return of full-time starters Thomas Castellanos at Boston College, Cade Klubnik at Clemson, Grayson Loftis at Duke, Haynes King at Georgia Tech, Preston Stone at SMU, and Kyron Drones at Virginia Tech, and transfers DJ Uiagalelei at Florida State, Tyler Shough at Louisville, Cam Ward at Miami, Grayson McCall at NC State, and Kyle McCord at Syracuse among others.\n\nACC had 10 quarterbacks named to the Maxwell Award preseason watch list, no other conference had more.\n\nACC has the top-ranked group of quarterback transfers in 2024 by CBS Sports.\n\n13 QBs in the league enter the 2024 season with over 20 career touchdown passes and 3,500 career passing yards.\n\nEight quarterbacks from ACC schools are projected to start Week 1 in the 2024 NFL season — 25 percent of NFL teams.\n\nSince 2018, the ACC has had at least one quarterback drafted in the first round in five different drafts — the only conference to do that.\n\nThe ACC’s non-conference schedule continues to be the most challenging in the country.\n\n27 games against Power 4 opponents, including Notre Dame, the most of any conference.\n\nNine non-conference games against teams ranked in the final 2023 Associated Press Top 25 Poll, the most of any conference.\n\n10 non-conference games against teams in ESPN’s 2024 Way-Too-Early Top 25, the most of any conference.\n\nACC Features Elite Coaching Leadership\n\nSix ACC head coaches were named to the 2024 Dodd Trophy Preseason Watch List, as announced by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation and the Peach Bowl, no other conference had more.\n\nTwo of the three active coaches to win a national title reside in the ACC - Dabo Swinney led Clemson to national titles in 2016 and 2018.

The TQC Foundation, Inc., is an independent, charitable organization that was founded in 1994. Past Chairman and Founding Trustee Professor Walter W. Manley II, Founding Trustee L. Thomas Cox, Jr., Founding Trustee Rocky Bevis, and Founding Trustee Bob Teel established the award and the TQC Foundation, Inc., that sponsors it. Many more trustees have contributed to its development as one of the most prominent awards in college football. The TQC Foundation, Inc., joined the idea of a college receiver’s award to the organization’s vision and created the outstanding award and dynamic organization. The trophy, presented to each winner, is the most beautiful in college football – it has won several national awards for design excellence and aesthetic appeal. Likewise, the website and printed banquet program have been cited nationally for excellence in design.\n\nAbout the Tallahassee Quarterback Club Foundation, Inc.\n\nThe Tallahassee Quarterback Club Foundation, Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization, is the creator and sponsor of the Biletnikoff Award.
