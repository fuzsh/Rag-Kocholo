        "text": "In his 30th season as the head coach of the Ephs in 2019-20, Bill Kangas led his team to win the NESCAC regular season and his 415th career win.\n\nKangas was hired in the spring of 1989 to succeed long-time Eph head hockey coach Bill McCormick who retired with 329 wins. Kangas guided the Ephs to their first winning season in 10 years and was named the New England Div. 2/Div. 3 Coach of the Year in 1991. In his 26th season behind the Eph bench, Kangas collected his 330th career victory, becoming the all time winningest hockey coach in Eph history.\n\nKangas owns Williams records for most wins in a season (19 – 2015-16), longest unbeaten streak (10 – 2003-04) and second longest unbeaten streak (9 – 2005-06). Additionally, Kangas' 2005-06 Eph team, tied the Eph in-season record for most consecutive wins (8) set in 1961-62 under Bill McCormick and 1993-94 also under Kangas.\n\nIn 2015-16, Williams finished NESCAC Regular Season in first place. In the 16 years of league standings, it was the first time the Ephs won the regular season title. Also, this same Ephs team earned Williams first-ever NCAA berth. Hosting the NCAA First Round in the Lansing Chapman Rink, Williams beat Salem State, 7-1, advancing to the quarterfinals, before dropping a hard fought 2-1 decision to SUNY-Geneseo.\n\nDuring the 2017-18 season, Kangas was on sabbatical, and Assistant Coach Mike Monti took over in his absence.\n\nKangas graduated in 1982 from the University of Vermont with a bachelor of arts in zoology. He also won the Wasson Award as the top men's senior student-athlete at UVM and received a Master's in Education from North Adams State College in 1994.\n\nBill Kangas\n\n30 years, 415-272-66 (.595)*\n\n*On January 17, 2012 with an 8-2 win over Wentworth IT,\n\nBill Kangas became just the second coach at Williams to\n\nrecord 300 wins in men's ice hockey.\n\nLittle Three Championships: 15outright and 5 ties\n\nWon: 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013, 2016 & 2020\n\nTies: 1990, 2007, 2009, 2013, 2015 & 2018\n\n1991 – New England Div. 2/Div. 3 Coach of the Year\n\n1994 – ECAC East Champions\n\n1994 – National Shriner's All-Star Game Coach\n\n2006 – Co-NESCAC Coach of the Year\n\n2006 – Finalist for Div. 3 National Coach of the Year\n\n2016 - NESCAC Regular Season Champions\n\n2016 - NCAA Elite Eight\n\n2016 - NESCAC Coach of the Year\n\n2016 - Finalist for Div. 3 National Coach of the Year\n\n6 – All-Americans"
