        "text": "Here is your guide to the history and records of the Frozen Four, the championship for college men's ice hockey.\n\nWhat is the Frozen Four?\n\nThe Frozen Four is the semifinals and finals of the college DI men's ice hockey tournament. The final two rounds of that tournament take place on one weekend in April after the field has been whittled down from 16 to four.\n\nThe Frozen Four only refers to the semifinals, but the tournament consists of four rounds. The selection committee grants the four No. 1 seeds in order, but does not officially release seed lines for the other 12 teams. This tournament setup requires the national champion to win four tournament games in a row to claim the national championship crown.\n\nHistory of the Frozen Four\n\nThe Frozen Four started in 1948, with Michigan taking the title over Dartmouth. It was just called the NCAA men's ice hockey championship until 1999, when it was re-branded as the Frozen Four.\n\nThe first 10 Frozen Fours were held in Colorado Springs, Colorado, before moving to a new location every season. Of course, some locations have hosted multiple times. Minneapolis, Denver, Utica, N.Y, Chestnut Hill, Ma.; Providence, Syracuse, Duluth, Minn. are among the locations that have hosted the Frozen Four.\n\nBoston University has hosted six times, including three years in a row from 1972 to 1974.\n\nCoach Vic Heyliger's Michigan teams won six of the first nine national championships, and was the runner-up in each of those three when they didn't win. The Wolverines added another title in 1964, then had to wait 30 years for their next one.\n\nBoston College and Denver are is the leaders in championships since 2000 with four. Minnesota Duluth has three. Minnesota has two.\n\nAfter every Frozen Four, the NCAA names a Most Outstanding Player and an All-Tournament Team.\n\nYEAR CHAMPION COACH SCORE RUNNER-UP HOST OR SITE 2022 Denver (31-9-1) David Carle 5-1 Minnesota State Boston 2021 UMass (20-5-4) Greg Carvel 5-0 St. Cloud State Pittsburgh 2020 N/A â€” The championship was canceled because of the pandemic.
