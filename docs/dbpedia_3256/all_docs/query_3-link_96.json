        "text": "No. 2 Terriers Fall to Top-Ranked Boston College in Hockey East Title Game\n\nMarch 23, 2024\n\nBOSTON â€“ In a matchup of the nation's top two teams, the No. 2 Boston University men's ice hockey team fell to No. 1 Boston College, 6-2, in the Hockey East title game on Saturday evening at TD Garden.\n\nThe Eagles, who went 4-for-5 on the power play, jumped out to a 2-0 lead before the midpoint of the first period, but freshman Gavin McCarthy cut the deficit in half with his first collegiate goal early in the second.\n\nBC added a power-play goal late in the second period and pushed its lead to 5-1 with a pair of third-period tallies. Freshman Macklin Celebrini added another for BU on the power play with his 31st goal of the season. The Eagles added an empty-netter to create the 6-2 final.\n\nHOW IT HAPPENED\n\nThe Eagles killed off an early penalty and then opened the scoring on their first power-play of the game as a left-circle bid by Will Smith went off the skate of a BU defender and in at 5:46 of the first.\n\nLess than three minutes later, Smith added another power-play tally - this time off a rush - when he converted from the right circle for a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Terriers got on the board at 4:24 of the second as sophomore Ryan Greene, from the left corner, found McCarthy at the right point, where the freshman sent a shot to the net that beat BC netminder Jacob Fowler high to the glove side.\n\nBC regained a multi-goal lead with 1:14 remaining in the second on another power-play marker, this time from the stick of Cutter Gauthier.\n\nThe Eagles built on their lead in the third as Smith capped a hat trick after receiving a pass at the foot of the right circle at 6:46.\n\nGabe Perreault pushed the BC advantage to 5-1 on the team's fourth power-play goal of the evening with 8:28 left in regulation.\n\nCelebrini tried to get the Terriers back in it when he found the back of the net on a man advantage with 5:15 left on assists from sophomore Lane Hutson and Greene.\n\nThe Eagles sealed the win on an empty-netter by Smith for his fourth goal of the night.\n\nGAME NOTES\n\nGreene finished the Hockey East Tournament with five points on two goals and three assists, including four points (2g, 2a) at TD Garden.\n\nCelebrini now ranks second all-time in goals by a BU rookie; Dave Silk scored 35 in 1976-77.\n\nHutson is now tied for first among active defensemen with 94 career points (28g, 66a) despite having played only 74 games.\n\nBU held a 36-29 advantage in shots as junior Mathieu Caron made 23 saves.\n\nFowler turned in a 34-save effort for the Eagles.\n\nSmith had a five-point game for BC, recording four goals and an assist.\n\nThe Terriers went 1-for-5 on the power play.\n\nThis was the third time that the Comm. Ave. rivals met in the Hockey East title game, with BU winning the previous two in 1986 and 2006.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Terriers are in place to earn an at-large berth to the NCAA tournament and will learn their draw on Sunday's selection show, which will air at 6:30 p.m. on ESPNU.\n\nRegionals start on Thursday (March 28) and Friday (March 29)."
