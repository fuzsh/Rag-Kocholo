        "text": "By Rick Brewer, SID Emeritus\n\nRICHMOND, Va.-Charlotte Smith hit a three-point shot at the buzzer, lifting North Carolina to a stunning 60-59 victory over Louisiana Tech in the NCAA Women's basketball Championship game at the Richmond Coliseum.\n\nThe Lady Techsters seemed to have the game won in the closing seconds. A jump shot by Pam Thomas gave Tech a 59-57 lead with 14 seconds left. Carolina's Tonya Sampson then missed a jumper and only 0.01 seconds remained as the ball fell out of bounds off a Tech player.\n\nStephanie Lawrence fired the inbounds pass to Smith who then hit her only three-pointer of the season from the top of the key.\n\nThe victory capped a 33-2 season for the Tar Heels and made Carolina the only school at the time to have won NCAA basketball titles in both men's and women's basketball.\n\nSmith, the MVP of the Final Four, finished with 20 points and a Final Four record 23 rebounds. Sampson, an All-America forward, finished with 21 points and eight rebounds.\n\nThis game was close all the way. Tech had a five-point lead late in the first half. But two layups by Sampson in the last 33 seconds made it 32-32 at halftime.\n\nCarolina led throughout the second half until Thomas finally put the Lady Techsters up 49-48 with a layup at the 7:18 mark. Tech then built a five-point lead with 5:06 on the clock.\n\nBut, Carolina then reeled off five straight to tie the game. Smith hit a driving layup, was fouled and added a free throw. Another basket by Smith made it 53-53.\n\nSampson and Sylvia Crawley scored to offset Tech field goals before Thomas hit her late go-ahead shot.\n\nThomas led the Tech scoring with 15 points.\n\nCrawley added 14 points for Carolina.\n\nRick Brewer is in his fourth decade with the University of North Carolina athletic department and brings a unique historical perspective to TarHeelBlue.com.
