Head Coach, UMass, 2016-22\n\nNational Champion, 2021\n\nNational Runner-Up, 2019\n\nHockey East Champion, 2021, 2022\n\nAssistant Coach, St. Lawrence, 2014-16\n\nAssistant Coach, Nazareth, 2011-14\n\nJared DeMichiel joined the Michigan State hockey staff as the first hire by head coach Adam Nightingale in the summer of 2022. Recognized as one of the top recruiters in college hockey and one of the rising stars in the profession, DeMichiel has not only had a hand in helping guide the meteoric on-ice rise of the program under Adam Nightingale, but also in bringing highly-rated prospects to East Lansing in each of his first two seasons.\n\nHis first two goaltending pupils at MSU – Dylan St. Cyr (2022-23) and Trey Augustine (2023-24) - both earned Big Ten postseason accolades. St. Cyr was an honorable mention pick and backstopped the Spartans to the first-ever Big Ten postseason victories in school history before moving on to a professional career in France. The youngest starting goaltender in the country last season, Augustine led the country in saves and boasted a .915 save percentage, was fifth in wins (23), eighth in winning percentage (.706) and ninth in shutouts (3), helping the Spartans to Big Ten regular-season and tournament titles in addition to earning a gold medal at the World Junior Championships.\n\nFrom 2016-22, DeMichiel was on staff at Massachusetts, first as an assistant coach and, beginning in 2019, the associate head coach. One of the bright rising assistants in the collegiate game, he spent six seasons at UMass with head coach Greg Carvel and helped lead the Minutemen to their first-ever NCAA Division I Men’s Ice Hockey Championship in 2021, first-ever Frozen Four in 2019, and capturing Hockey East tournament titles in 2021 and 2022. Over his six seasons at UMass, DeMichiel was instrumental in turning a team which went 5-29-2 in 2016-17 when the staff arrived in Amherst to making the Frozen Four in year three (2018-19) and winning a national championship in year five (2020-21). Over his final four seasons at UMass (2018-22), the Minutemen compiled a record of 94-39-7 (.696).\n\nIn his six years, UMass had five All-America selections, two Hobey Baker finalists (and one winner), two Hockey East Players of the Year, one Hockey East Rookie of the Year, one Hockey East scoring champion, 18 All-Hockey East selections, and 103 Academic All-Hockey East selections.\n\nDuring the national championship season, the Minutemen finished second in the nation in scoring defense at 1.66 goals per-game and ranked in the top-10 in the country in that category for a third straight season.\n\nEleven Minutemen were drafted in DeMichiel’s time at UMass: Cale Makar (Colorado) and Mario Ferraro (San Jose) in 2017, John Leonard (San Jose) in 2018, Zac Jones (New York Rangers), Marc Del Gaizo (Nashville) and Lindberg (Minnesota) in 2019, Matthew Kessel (St. Louis) and Lucas Mercuri (Carolina) in 2020 and Scott Morrow (Carolina), Josh Lopina (Anaheim), Ryan Ufko (Nashville) and Taylor Makar (Colorado) in 2021.\n\nDeMichiel first joined forces with Carvel at St. Lawrence (2014-16), where DeMichiel was the Saints’ primary recruiter and he played a pivotal role as the Saints put together 20- and 19-win seasons with second- and fourth-place ECAC finishes, respectively, during his time in Canton.\n\nDeMichiel got his start in coaching working under George Roll, starting the hockey program at Nazareth College (2011-14). In three seasons of recruiting for Nazareth, his recruits collected one second team All-America honor, one ECAC West Rookie of the Year, five all-conference and four all-rookie honors for the Golden Flyers.\n\nSince the summer of 2012, DeMichiel has worked the USA Hockey National Select Festival, as well.\n\nA former Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) goaltender, DeMichiel won three Atlantic Hockey Association regular season titles and one postseason AHA Championship in his four-year career. In his senior season he led all of Division I with 27 victories, was second in shutouts (six), seventh in goals against average and eighth in save percentage. He paced RIT to the 2010 Frozen Four and holds RIT’s Division I record for career victories and wins in a season by a goaltender. In 2010, DeMichiel led the AHA in every major statistical category and was a first-team AHA all-star selection. He also was named Goaltender of the Year and made the AHA all-tournament team. DeMichiel was tabbed the Most Outstanding Player at the 2010 East Regional and was honored as the Rochester Press-Radio Club’s 2010 Paychex Male College Athlete of the Year.\n\nFollowing graduation, DeMichiel signed with the American Hockey League’s Hershey Bears. He attended NHL training camps with the Washington Capitals and Boston Bruins. In addition to Hershey, DeMichiel played with Providence in the AHL as well as South Carolina Stingrays, Elmira Jackals, Kalamazoo Wings and Chicago Express of the East Coast Hockey League.\n\nDeMichiel graduated from RIT in 2010 with a bachelor’s degree in business management and he received his master’s degree in management from Nazareth in 2014. A native of Harwinton, Connecticut, DeMichiel and his wife Kara have a daughter, Paige, and son, Jordan."
