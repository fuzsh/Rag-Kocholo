        "text": "Rand Pecknold just finished his 30th season at the helm of the Quinnipiac men's ice hockey program in 2022-23 after being hired to the position on May 5, 1994, culminating in the school's first national championship.\n\nTo date, Pecknold features a career record of 642-347-105 and currently ranks first among all active NCAA Division I coaches in career victories and 10th all-time. He is one of three coaches to reach the 600-win milestone while only coaching at one school, joining Jack Parker from Boston University and Red Berenson at Michigan.\n\nThe Bobcats 2023-24 campaign saw them claim their fourth consecutive Cleary Cup as the ECAC's regular season champions, clinching the trophy with three games left in the league's regular season. It is the program's eighth overall trophy, all coming since the 2012-13 campaign.\n\nQuinnipiac won a game in the NCAA Tournament for the fourth time in the last five seasons, advancing to its sixth Elite Eight since 2012-13. Only Denver and Minnesota Duluth have more. Quinnipiac finished top five in the nation in faceoff percentage (.550), scoring defense (2.03), scoring margin (2.08), scoring offense (4.10), total assists (282), total points (442) and winning percentage (.718).\n\nThey also featured a Hobey Top 10 finalist for the third consecutive season in Collin Graf, who signed a three-year deal with the NHL's San Jose Sharks and made his pro debut days after signing his contract.\n\nThe New Hampshire native led the Bobcats to their first ever NCAA Division I Championship, boasting a record of 34-4-3 in the 2022-23 campaign. The squad earned its third trip to the Frozen Four since 2013, joining a club of six schools to have done that. They advanced to their third title game in that span, joining Minnesota Duluth as the only teams to reach three title games since 2013. The squad knocked off Michigan 5-2 in the semifinals and won the title with a thrilling, come-from-behind, 3-2 overtime victory over Minnesota.\n\nThe 34 wins are a new program record, besting the 33 the squad won in the 2015-16 and 2021-22 campaigns.\n\nPecknold was also earned the Tim Taylor Award, given to the ECAC Coach of the Year, for the third consecutive time and fifth time overall in his career. He joins Mike Schaefer as the only coach to win five awards, with all coming since the 2012-13 campaign. He led the Bobcats to a historic ECAC season in which the team won 20 of its 22 conference contests, something that hadn't been done since Harvard in 1987-88.\n\nThe Bobcats were amongst the nation's best in numerous statistical categories, leading the country in three and sitting inside the Top 3 in eight of the 13 major NCAA categories. The squad led the country in scoring defense (1.56), scoring margin (2.39) and winning percentage (.866). They were second in faceoff win percentage (.570) and team assists (287) and were third in penalty kill (.867), scoring offense (3.95) and total points (449).\n\nPecknold was named the head coach of the United States National Junior team for the 2023 Junior World Championships. Current and former Quinnipiac staff will join his U.S. staff, including Reid Cashman, Shawn Roche, Jared Waimon and Jessica Thibault.\n\nUnder his watch in 2021-22, Quinnipiac earned its sixth Cleary Cup in the last ten seasons and second in a row as the Bobcats claimed the ECAC Hockey Regular Season Championship. Only one other ECAC program has won as many Cleary Cups in a 10-year span. Pecknold was named ECAC Hockey Coach of the Year for the fourth time in his career. Winners of 32 games, the Bobcats reached the NCAA Tournament for the eighth time in program history, and seventh time in the past nine seasons that a tournament was held. Pecknold's squad defeated St. Cloud State to open the Allentown Regional, before falling to #1-overall seed Michigan in the Regional Final.\n\nPecknold guided Quinnipiac to its fifth Cleary Cup in the last nine seasons in the 2020-21 season as the Bobcats cruised to the ECAC Hockey Regular Season Championship. The Bobcats won 17 games in the pandemic-shortened season, the 21st time a Pecknold team has won 17-plus games and Quinnipiac has never finished with fewer than 16 wins in a season since joining ECAC Hockey in 2005-06. The Bobcats reached the NCAA Tournament for the seventh time in program history, and sixth time in the past eight seasons a tournament was held.\n\nPecknold was crowned the ECAC Hockey Coach of the Year for the third time in his career while Odeen Tufto was named the league's player of the year and Keith Petruzzelli earned the goaltender of the year honors. Tufto was also named a CCM/AHCA First Team All-American while both Tufto and Petruzzelli were named Top 10 Finalists for the Hobey Baker Award. Petruzzelli was also a finalist for the Mike Richter Award.\n\nDuring the 2020-21 season, the Bobcats also placed three players on the ECAC Hockey First Team for the first time in program history in Tufto, Petruzzelli and Zach Metsa.\n\nThe Bobcats finished the 2019-20 season with their 18th 20-win season in the Rand Pecknold era, going 21-11-2 before the season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bobcats earned two All-ECAC Hockey selections and were primed to make deep runs in the ECAC Hockey Tournament as the No. 3 seed and were on the verge of another NCAA Tournament appearance.\n\nHe completed his 25th season as Quinnipiac's men's ice hockey head coach in 2018-19, and earned an historic victory as he picked up the 500th win of his career midway through the season with a 6-0 shutout of Colgate. Pecknold is one of four active Division I men's ice hockey coaches with 500 career wins and is one of 14 all-time at the Division I level.\n\nThe 2018-19 season saw the Bobcats earn a share of their fourth Cleary Cup as ECAC Hockey Regular Season Champions with a league-best 14 victories against ECAC Hockey competition. Quinnipiac also returned to the NCAA Tournament for the sixth time in program history, earning a first round victory over Arizona State to reach the Midwest Regional final where the Bobcats faced the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs.\n\nSeveral Bobcats earned major individual honors as goaltender Andrew Shortridge was named the ECAC Hockey Goaltender of the Year, CCM/AHCA Second Team All-American, ECAC Hockey First Team and was a finalist for the Mike Richter Award. Chase Priskie was a Top 10 Finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, ECAC Hockey First Team and a finalist for the Senior CLASS Award. Quinnipiac also placed Odeen Tufto on the ECAC Hockey Second Team while all three were named to the New England Hockey Writers' All-New England Teams.\n\nThe 2017-18 season featured one of the toughest non-conference schedules in recent memory, as the Bobcats saw #13 Boston College, #2 Boston University, and Northeastern in four of the opening five games of the season. Quinnipiac tied BC on the road, while falling to BU in the home opener, before sweeping a Northeastern team in Boston, Mass, that ended up an NCAA Tournament team and nationally ranked in the top-ten.\n\nAside from Northeastern, the Bobcats earned victories over two other NCAA Tournament teams, Princeton and Clarkson, and won five of their last seven games in ECAC play, earning the #9 seed in the ECAC Tournament.\n\nAs the #9 seed, the Bobcats traveled to Ingalls Rink where they swept their in-state rival, Yale, in the ECAC Tournament Opening Round best-of-three series. Until 2017-18, Pecknold had posted 20 straight non-losing seasons. In addition, Quinnipiac led the nation in total wins from 2013-2017, with 132 victories.\n\nFollowing the 2017-18 season, Pecknold won a silver medal at the IIHF World Championship as an assistant coach with the 2018 U.S. Men's National Team.\n\nIn doing so, Quinnipiac has now won an ECAC Hockey playoff series in each of its 11 years in the league, dating back to 2005-06, and also ran its all-time streak to 18 years, giving them a series win in each year that they have been at the NCAA Division I level.\n\nFollowing the 2016-17 season, on Apr. 13, 2017, Pecknold selected by USA Hockey as an assistant coach for the 2017 U.S. Men's National Team that competed in the IIHF World Championship in Germany and France.\n\nThe 2016-17 senior class completed their careers with 102 career wins, good for second among all NCAA Division I programs behind North Dakota's 105. It also marked the first time in program history that consecutive senior classes posted 100-win careers. Quinnipiac is one of seven schools – including Denver, Minnesota, Minnesota State, UMass Lowell, Boston College and Providence – to currently feature a senior class that has won 20-or-more games in all four seasons that they have played. Off the ice, Quinnipiac senior Derek Smith became the first Quinnipiac player to win the prestigious ECAC Hockey Student-Athlete of the Year Award.\n\nThe 2016-17 season marked the Bobcats fifth-consecutive appearance in the ECAC Hockey Semifinals and the program's 17th 20-win season in program history, with Pecknold owning 16 of those years out of his 24 years behind the Bobcats' bench.\n\nIn 2015-16, Quinnipiac won a program record 32 games while winning the ECAC Hockey Regular-Season (Cleary Cup) and Tournament (Whitelaw Cup) Championships. The Bobcats' 32-4-7 record made them the first team since Michigan in 1997 to finish the season with only four losses for the year.\n\n2015-16's success resulted in a fourth consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance, as well as the team's second appearance in the NCAA Frozen Four and National Championship Game since 2013-14. In addition, the Bobcats captured their second-consecutive Cleary Cup, for the ECAC Hockey Regular-Season Championship, which was also their third in four seasons. Quinnipiac also won its first-ever Whitelaw Cup after winning the league's tournament championship. For his efforts, Pecknold was honored with the Spencer Penrose National Coach of the Year Award, the College Hockey News National Coach of the Year as well as the ECAC Hockey Tim Taylor Coach of the Year Award.\n\nTHE RAND PECKNOLD FILE • 2023 National Champion.\n\n• Most wins of any coach in Quinnipiac hockey and Quinnipiac Athletics history.

The Bobcats defeated perennial power Boston College before falling to North Dakota in the National Championship Game.\n\nIn 2014-15, Quinnipiac posted a 23-12-4 overall record including a 16-3-3 record and its second Cleary Cup ECAC Hockey Regular Season Championship in that last three years. With the top seed in the ECAC Hockey Championship, the Bobcats topped Union in a best-of-three quarterfinals series at High Point Solutions Arena.\n\nIn 2013-14, Pecknold's Bobcats posted their 13th 20-win season, out of the head coach's then 16-year NCAA Division I career, while also winning the fourth most game in the program's history as Quinnipiac went 24-10-6 for the year. The Bobcats winning percentage of .675 ranked seventh nationally, while Quinnipiac also finished the year ranked second on the penalty kill (89.8), sixth on the power play (24.3) and 10th in combined special teams (53.0). Additionally, Quinnipiac ranked third in scoring margin (1.50), as its 3.52 goals per game (fifth highest in program history) ranked fifth among all Division I programs. The Bobcats 2.02 goals-against average was ranked second overall. The Bobcats posted a 12-4-6 ECAC Hockey record, clinching the third seed in the league championship tournament and securing a first-round bye for the second consecutive season.\n\nIndividually, the 2013-14 team featured NCAA Division I men's ice hockey's top freshman in Sam Anas, who became the first Quinnipiac and ECAC Hockey player to win the National Rookie of the Year award. Anas and senior Kellen Jones were also named to the ECAC Hockey Second Team. Following the season, Pecknold saw the second player in Quinnipiac history play in an National Hockey League game in Bryce Van Brabant, who signed with the NHL's Calgary Flames. Zach Tolkinen also joined the Flames organization, while Connor and Kellen Jones signed with Edmonton and Jordan Samuels-Thomas signed with Buffalo.\n\nIn 2012-13, Rand Pecknold guided Quinnipiac to arguably its most successful season in program history at the time. The Bobcats ascended to its first NCAA Frozen Four, and finished as the National Runner-up, after capturing the 2012-13 Cleary Cup for its first ECAC Hockey Regular-Season Championship. The Bobcats finished the season with an overall record of 30-8-5, good for a NCAA-leading .756 winning percentage, while also leading the country with the most wins (30) and fewest losses (8) in Division I ice hockey. Quinnipiac also posted a national-best 21-game unbeaten streak from Nov. 9, 2012 through Feb. 9, 2013.\n\nIn 2012-13, Pecknold was also named the ECAC Hockey Tim Taylor Coach of the Year and the New England Hockey Writers' Association Clark Hodder Coach of the Year while also recognized as a finalist for the prestigious Spencer Penrose National Coach of the Year award. Individually, Eric Hartzell was named a Hobey Baker Award \"Hobey Hat Trick\" Finalist and was honored as the ECAC Hockey Player of the Year, the ECAC Hockey Ken Dryden Goalie of the Year as well as earning AHCA/CCM Hockey All-American Honors as well as USCHO.com Player of the Year, while also earning ECAC Hockey First Team Honors. Zach Davies was named the ECAC Hockey Best Defensive Defenseman and also named to the First Team while Jeremy Langlois earned Third Team honors.\n\nQuinnipiac won the first NCAA Tournament game in school history when it knocked-off Canisius, 4-3, before topping Union, 5-1, in the NCAA East Regional Final to advance to the NCAA Frozen Four for the first time in program history. The Bobcats rolled over St. Cloud State, 4-1, before losing to Yale in the National Championship Game, 4-0.\n\nSince taking over as head coach of the Quinnipiac University men’s ice hockey team 24 years ago, Rand Pecknold has asserted himself as one of the nation’s best. He has seen plenty of changes, but one constant is a proven track record filled with success and accomplishment, both on the team and individual fronts.\n\nOff the ice, the Bobcats have ranked among the top half of Quinnipiac’s Department of Athletics in Positive Play points, which encourages community involvement by Quinnipiac’s student-athletes and coaches. Academically, Quinnipiac men's ice hockey featured the most student-athletes honored on the ECAC Hockey Academic Honor Roll in 2015 while also placing in the top three in the 12-team league for each of the past six seasons.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2010-11 season, Pecknold was selected as ECAC Hockey's representative on the NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey committee. Pecknold served the second year of his two-year term in 2012-13 seasons.\n\nIn 2009-10, Quinnipiac’s early-season success featured wins against nationally-ranked Ohio State on the Buckeyes home-ice to open the season before ultimately winning 12 of their first 13 games. Included in the run, that culminated with the No. 4 ranking, were wins against nationally-ranked UMass and Cornell, including Quinnipiac second win in their last three regular-season games at Lynah Rink. Pecknold’s line-up featured a pair of early-season nationally-ranked scoring leaders in Brandon Wong and Eric Lampe, as well as the AHCA National Player of the Month in goalie Dan Clarke. Quinnipiac hit a lull over the middle part of the season, before clinching home-ice advantage for the ECAC Hockey First Round for the fifth consecutive year, while also extending their streak of Quarterfinal appearances to five. When the dust settled, Wong was signed by the Grand Rapids Griffens of the American Hockey League, while Lampe and Jean-Marc Beaudoin landed in the East Coast Hockey League, with Lampe lacing them up for the Florida Everglades while Beaudoin helped the Bakersfield Condors to their league championship for the first time in program history. In addi­tion to his team’s success, Pecknold won his 300th career game as the Bobcats clinched their ECAC Hockey First Round series.\n\nIn 2008–09, the Bobcats line-up included the nation’s leading scorer in Bryan Leitch, who also led the nation in assists. It was a first for the Quinnipiac men’s ice hockey program at the Division I level and was also the first time since All-American Reid Cashman word the Bobcats’ sweater that Pecknold coached a player that landed among the nation’s leaders. In addition to Leitch, linemate David Marshall also ranked in the top ten in points scored as well as goals scored as the duo sat in the top two spots on the ECAC Hockey scoring list. Leitch was named to the ECAC Hockey Second Team, become Quinnipiac’s first all-league player since 2006–07.\n\nPrior to the Bobcats joining ECAC Hockey, Pecknold guided Quinnipiac to two MAAC regular-season titles, one Atlantic Hockey regular-season title, one MAAC tourna­ment title and the first-ever NCAA berth in program history in 2002.In addition to individual success, the Bobcats won their second con­secutive in-season tournament when they knocked off Merrimack and nationally-ranked Air Force to win the Toyota UConn Hockey Classic. The Bobcats went on to defeat Harvard and Dartmouth, also nationally ranked at the time, for an impressive four wins in six days. The feat pushed Quinnipiac into the national polls for the first time that year while they were also named the College Hockey News National Team of the Week.\n\nThe Quinnipiac men’s ice hockey 2007–08 season started off on a high note when the team was ranked in the top 15 by both the USCHO.com/ CSTV Division I and USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine College Hockey Preseason Polls. The Bobcats became mainstays in the national rankings for most of the season, rising to 10th in both polls while also being fea­tured in College Hockey News’ first NCAA Tournament prediction of the season.January 21, 2008 marked the date for Quinnipiac’s highest ranking all-time in a national poll. The Bobcats locked down the 10th slot in the InsideCollegeHockey.com poll while also being ranked in the top 15 in the RPI and PairWise Standings.\n\nIn addition to their accomplishments in the Blue and Gold, 14 play­ers were ECAC Hockey All-Academic selections, for the second straight season. Captain Jamie Bates was also signed by the Norfolk (Va.) Admirals, the top AHL affiliate of the Tampa Bay Lightning, before then signing with the Springfield (Mass.) Falcons, the top AHL affiliate of the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe Bobcats took a strong step forward on the national stage in 2006–07. Quinnipiac was ranked in the top 20 for 18 weeks and reached the finals of the ECAC Hockey Tournament in just its second year in the league. During the league playoffs, the Bobcats recorded three victories against nationally ranked teams-including a two-game series sweep at Cornell’s hostile Lynah Rink. Ultimately, Quinnipiac fell one game shy of reaching the NCAA Tournament, as it was defeated by No. 5 nationally ranked Clarkson in the tournament final.\n\nOn the individual front, 14 players earned All-Academic honors from ECAC Hockey. In addition, senior defenseman Reid Cashman was selected as a First-Team All-American by the American Hockey Coaches Association and signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs following the sea­son. Brandon Wong was tabbed as a Freshman All-American after earning league Co-Rookie of the Year honors.\n\nFaced with one of the biggest challenges since taking over as head coach of the program, Pecknold made sure that things didn’t skip a beat while joining ECAC Hockey in 2005-06. The Bobcats reached the 20-win plateau for the seventh time in eight seasons, finishing at 20–18–1. For his efforts, Pecknold was named ECAC Hockey Coach of the Year by Insidecollegehockey.com.\n\nDespite winning 15 of its final 18 games in 2004-05 to finish with a 21–13–1 mark and the Atlantic Hockey regular-season title, Quinnipiac finished one victory shy of earning an NCAA Tournament berth, falling in the conference tournament final.\n\nPecknold was selected as the 2005 Atlantic Hockey Coach of the Year and was tabbed as a finalist for the Spencer Penrose Award. Cashman was voted a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, given annually to the top player in college hockey, and earned All-America accolades from two national media outlets. Off the ice, senior goaltender Jamie Holden was named a CoSIDA First-Team District I Academic All-America selection for his performance in the classroom.\n\nIn 2003–04, Pecknold coached a unit that was decimated by injuries but still managed to achieve a winning record for the eighth straight year at 15–14–6.\n\nDuring the 2002–03 campaign, Quinnipiac reached the MAAC tourna­ment final for the third consecutive season, but fell one goal short of its second straight NCAA Tournament berth. Nevertheless, the Bobcats did reach the 20-win plateau for the fifth straight year, closing with a 22–13–1 mark.\n\nThe 2001–02 campaign was arguably the most successful of Pecknold’s tenure in Hamden. Despite being picked to finish fifth in the preseason coaches’ poll, the Bobcats closed out the regular season with a second-place effort. Then, in the MAAC Tournament, Quinnipiac registered one-goal wins over Iona and Sacred Heart before taking a 6–4 win over Mercyhurst in the title game. As a result, Quinnipiac earned its first-ever trip to the NCAA Division I Tournament.\n\nPecknold became the winningest coach in program history with his 141st win on March 1, 2002, a 6–2 win over UConn.\n\nIn 2000–01, Quinnipiac registered a final mark of 22–11–4. After finish­ing with a 17–7–2 mark in the regular season, the Bobcats finished one game shy of their first ever NCAA berth, falling to Mercyhurst, 6–5, in the MAAC Hockey League championship game.\n\nQuinnipiac finished the 1999–2000 season with a 27–6–3 final record. The 27 wins broke the school record of 26, which was set in 1998–99.\n\nIn its first season in Division I in 1998–99, Quinnipiac set a school record with 26 victories on its way to the inaugural MAAC Hockey League regular-season title.\n\nIn 1997–1998, its final Division II campaign, Pecknold guided the Bobcats to a 19–3–1 record.
