        "text": "The WCHA Men's League Archives\n\nSpanning from 1951 through the end of the 2021 season, the WCHA men's league was one of rich history and tradition including member schools Alabama Huntsville, Alaska Anchorage, Alaska, Bemidji State, Bowling Green, Ferris State, Lake Superior State, Michigan Tech, Minnesota State, and Northern Michigan.\n\n408 All-Americans\n\n16 Hobey Baker Award Winners\n\n19 Spencer Penrose Honorees\n\n1,044 NHL Draft Picks\n\n217 Olympians\n\n37 NCAA Championship Teams\n\nBorn as the Midwest Collegiate Hockey League in 1951, the original WCHA consisted of Colorado College, Denver, Michigan, Michigan State, Michigan Tech, Minnesota, and North Dakota. Over the 70-year-history, Minnesota Duluth, Notre Dame, Nebraska Omaha, St. Cloud State, and Wisconsin all competed in the league.\n\nFinal Record Book\n\nTradition Starts Here - The MacNaughton Cup\n\nDating back 106 years to its original purchase in 1913, handcrafted of pure silver, standing three-feet high, and weighing more than 40 pounds, the MacNaughton Cup is the shining symbol of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association and its distinguished tradition as a premier collegiate hockey conference since the league's founding in 1951.\n\nThe MacNaughton Cup is awarded annually to the winner of the league's regular season championship and, as a traveling trophy, is on display each season at the home of the reigning champion. Beginning in 2005-06, the WCHA also began awarding a replica MacNaughton Cup to the regular season champion each season. The MacNaughton Cup has gone to the league's regular season winner on all but seven occasions since 1951. From 1962-65, the MacNaughton Cup was presented to the league playoff winner.\n\nWith seven WCHA regular season titles, Michigan Tech (1962, 1966, 1969, 1971, 1974, 1976, 2016) has won or shared the most MacNaughton Cups among current league members. Minnesota State (2015, 2016, 2018, 2019) is second with four. Northern Michigan (1991), Ferris State (2014) and Bemidji State (2017) have each won one title.\n\nIn 1981-82, 1982-83 and 1983-84, the trophy left with Cup custodian Michigan Tech and was presented to the champion of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association for those three seasons.\n\nThe WCHA Regular Season Championship\n\nThe Western Collegiate Hockey Association men's regular season championship, as has proven time and time again over the past 67 seasons, has traditionally been one of the toughest titles to win in collegiate sports.\n\nSince the Association's founding in 1951-52, the number of games that have made up the league's regular season championship race have fluctuated as well as the methods of determining the champions. The number of league games have ranged from a low of 12 in the founding season of 1951-52 to a high of 35 that ran from 1986-87 through 1988-89. Since 1997-98, the conference schedule has consisted of 28 games per team.\n\nMethods of determining the annual regular season team champion have included points accumulated (1951-58, 1973-79 and 1980-present) and winning percentage (1959-73, 1979-80).\n\nThe conference regular season title includes the awarding of the fabled MacNaughton Cup to the team champion.\n\nAll-Time WCHA Men’s League Regular Season Champions Season Champion GP Record Pts/Pct. 1951-52 Colorado College 12 10-2-0 20 1952-53 Minnesota (co) 20 16-4-0 19 Michigan (co) 16 12-4-0 19 1953-54 Minnesota 20 16-3-1 20½ 1954-55 Colorado College 18 14-4-0 19 1955-56 Michigan 18 15-2-1 19 1956-57 Colorado College 18 14-4-0 19 1957-58 North Dakota (co) 20 15-5-0 16 Denver (co) 22 12-10-0 16 1958-59 No League Play 1959-60 Denver 22 17-4-1 .795 1960-61 Denver 18 17-1-0 .944 1961-62 Michigan Tech 20 17-3-0 .850 1962-63 Denver (co) 18 12-6-0 .667 North Dakota (co) 18 11-5-2 .667 1963-64 Michigan 14 12-2-0 .857 1964-65 North Dakota 16 13-3-0 .813 1965-66 Michigan Tech 20 15-4-1 .775 1966-67 North Dakota 22 16-6-0 .727 1967-68 Denver 18 15-3-0 .822 1968-69 Michigan Tech 20 14-5-1 .725 1969-70 Minnesota 26 18-8-0 .692 1970-71 Michigan Tech 22 18-4-0 .818 1971-72 Denver 28 19-9-0 .679 1972-73 Denver 28 20-8-0 .714 1973-74 Michigan Tech 28 20-6-2 42 1974-75 Minnesota 32 24-8-0 48 1975-76 Michigan Tech 32 25-7-0 50 1976-77 Wisconsin 32 26-5-1 53 1977-78 Denver 32 27-5-0 54 1978-79 North Dakota 32 22-10-0 44 1979-80 North Dakota 28 21-6-1 .768 1980-81 Minnesota 28 20-8-0 40 1981-82 North Dakota 26 19-7-0 38 1982-83 Minnesota 26 18-7-1 37 1983-84 Minnesota Duluth 26 19-5-2 40 1984-85 Minnesota Duluth 34 25-7-2 52 1985-86 Denver 34 25-9-0 50 1986-87 North Dakota 35 29-6-0 58 1987-88 Minnesota 35 28-7-0 56 1988-89 Minnesota 35 27-6-2 56 1989-90 Wisconsin 28 19-8-1 39 1990-91 Northern Michigan 32 25-3-4 54 1991-92 Minnesota 32 26-6-0 52 1992-93 Minnesota Duluth 32 21-9-2 44 1993-94 Colorado College 32 18-9-5 41 1994-95 Colorado College 32 22-9-1 45 1995-96 Colorado College 32 26-2-4 56 1996-97 North Dakota (co) 32 21-10-1 43 Minnesota (co) 32 21-10-1 43 1997-98 North Dakota 28 21-6-1 43 1998-99 North Dakota 28 24-2-2 50 1999-00 Wisconsin 28 23-5-0 46 2000-01 North Dakota 28 18-4-6 42 2001-02 Denver 28 21-6-1 43 2002-03 Colorado College 28 19-4-5 43 2003-04 North Dakota 28 20-5-3 43 2004-05 Denver (co) 28 19-7-2 40 Colorado College (co) 28 19-7-2 40 2005-06 Minnesota 28 20-5-3 43 2006-07 Minnesota 28 18-7-3 39 2007-08 Colorado College 28 21-6-1 43 2008-09 North Dakota 28 17-7-4 38 2009-10 Denver 28 19-5-4 42 2010-11 North Dakota 28 21-6-1 43 2011-12 Minnesota 28 20-8-0 40 2012-13 St. Cloud State (co) 28 18-9-1 37 Minnesota (co) 28 16-7-5 37 2013-14 Ferris State 28 20-6-2 42 2014-15 Minnesota State 28 21-4-3 45 2015-16 Michigan Tech (co) 28 18-7-3 39 Minnesota State (co) 28 16-5-7 39 2016-17 Bemidji State 28 20-6-2-2 64 2017-18 Minnesota State 28 22-5-1-0 67 2018-19 Minnesota State 28 22-5-1-1 68 The fabled MacNaughton Cup has gone to the WCHA regular season champion in all but seven seasons . From 1962-65, the MacNaughton Cup was presented to the league playoff winner. In 1981-82, 1982-83 and 1983-84, the trophy left with Cup custodian Michigan Tech and was presented to the champion of the CCHA for those three seasons.\n\nMost WCHA Regular Season Championships, by Team No Team (Championship Seasons; * denotes co-champion) 15 North Dakota (1958*, 1963*, 1965, 1967, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1987, 1997*, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2009, 2011) 14 Minnesota (1953*, 1954, 1970, 1975, 1981, 1983, 1988, 1989, 1992, 1997*, 2006, 2007, 2012, 2013*) 12 Denver (1958*, 1960, 1961, 1963*, 1968, 1972, 1973, 1978, 1986, 2002, 2005*, 2010) 9 Colorado College (1952, 1955, 1957, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2003, 2005*, 2008) 7 Michigan Tech (1962, 1966, 1969, 1971, 1974, 1976, 2016*) 4 Minnesota State (2015, 2016*, 2018, 2019) 3 Michigan (1953*, 1956, 1964)\n\nMinnesota Duluth (1984, 1985, 1993)\n\nWisconsin (1977, 1990, 2000) 1 Northern Michigan (1991)\n\nSt. Cloud State (2013*)\n\nFerris State (2014)\n\nBemidji State (2017)\n\nWCHA Postseason\n\nThe Broadmoor Trophy\n\nThe Broadmoor Trophy symbolized both regular season and postseason excellence in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association from 1982-2017.\n\nThe trophy is named after The Broadmoor Resort in Colorado Springs, Colo., which has a long history of supporting college hockey. The Broadmoor Trophy was commissioned as a replacement for the MacNaughton Cup, held in trust by Michigan Tech. In 1981, Michigan Tech left the WCHA for the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, taking the Cup with them. To fill the void, The Broadmoor Resort presented a new trophy to the WCHA to award to their regular season champion. North Dakota (1982), Minnesota (1983) and Minnesota Duluth (1984) were the three recipients of the Broadmoor as WCHA regular season titlists.\n\nUpon the return of Tech and the MacNaughton Cup to the WCHA in 1984, the MacNaughton again became the league’s regular season award and the Broadmoor came to serve as the WCHA postseason trophy.\n\nThe trophy was redesigned in 2010. The new bronze cast trophy, created by Blue Ribbon Trophies & Awards of Colorado Springs, Colo., was a recreation of the Broadmoor Resort. North Dakota became the lone WCHA program to win the Broadmoor in three consecutive seasons when the Fighting Sioux took home the Final Five championship in 2010, 2011 and 2012.\n\nBroadmoor Trophy Winners Year Champion 1982 North Dakota * 1983 Minnesota * 1984 Minnesota Duluth * 1985 Minnesota Duluth 1986 Denver 1987 North Dakota 1988 Wisconsin 1989 Northern Michigan 1990 Wisconsin 1991 Northern Michigan 1992 Northern Michigan 1993 Minnesota 1994 Minnesota 1995 Wisconsin 1996 Minnesota 1997 North Dakota 1998 Wisconsin 1999 Denver 2000 North Dakota 2001 St. Cloud State 2002 Denver 2003 Minnesota 2004 Minnesota 2005 Denver 2006 North Dakota 2007 Minnesota 2008 Denver 2009 Minnesota Duluth 2010 North Dakota 2011 North Dakota 2012 North Dakota 2013 Wisconsin 2014 Minnesota State 2015 Minnesota State 2016 Ferris State 2017 Michigan Tech\n\n* - From 1982-84, the WCHA Regular Season Champion received the Broadmoor Trophy The Jeff Sauer Championship Trophy\n\nThe beginning of each season brings with it the hope and promise that the late Jeff Sauer gave to all. Each day carries the love of hockey that shone through with his ever-present smile. At season’s end, a championship – the ultimate symbol of teamwork and unity that Coach Sauer exemplified.\n\nOur league is truly honored to award the Jeff Sauer WCHA Championship Trophy, Presented by Anderson’s Pure Maple Syrup, to our annual WCHA Postseason Tournament champion as a tangible reminder of the man who meant so much to our league and to the sport of hockey.\n\nSauer’s time with the WCHA spanned six decades, beginning with his playing career at Colorado College in the 1960s, continuing through 31 years as head coach of the Tigers and Wisconsin, and for 14 seasons in various consulting capacities to the WCHA Commissioner and Conference Office. The only WCHA head coach with 30 years behind the bench, he is the league’s all-time winningest coach with 665 victories – the 10th most in NCAA men’s hockey history. A two-time WCHA Coach of the Year, Sauer guided his CC and UW teams to a pair of league regular season titles and six WCHA playoff championships – the league pinnacle for which teams will now raise a trophy in his honor.\n\nJeff Sauer was a legendary coach, a tremendous ambassador for the game of hockey and, above all, a wonderful person who brought great joy to all. From the WCHA to his extensive involvement with the U.S. National Sled Team and the American Hearing Impaired Hockey Association, Jeff embodied the kindness, generosity and heart that makes our sport truly special.\n\nAll who knew Coach Sauer, on and off the ice, are better for the experience. We are blessed that he was – and always will be – part of the WCHA family.\n\nAbout the Jeff Sauer WCHA Championship Trophy\n\nThe custom-designed, perpetual Jeff Sauer WCHA Championship Trophy, Presented by Anderson’s Pure Maple Syrup, debuted in 2018. Designed by renowned manufacturer Jostens, the trophy stands more than two feet high on its own (and more than three-feet high upon its perpetual base) and weighs approximately 46 pounds altogether (about 30 without the base). The hockey stick uprights are solid, brass-plated in 24-karat gold, while the rest of the trophy is produced with a mix of metals and aluminum accents, around a polished steel bowl. In the center is a bronze-cast medallion plated in gold with the name “Jeff Sauer” to symbolize the trophy’s namesake. The octagon-shaped base is made of the same materials and features nickel silver plates for etching the history of past winning teams."
