        "text": "The NCAA Committee on Women’s Athletics oversees the Emerging Sports for Women program. An emerging sport is a women’s sport recognized by the NCAA that is intended to help schools provide more athletics opportunities for women and more sport-sponsorship options for institutions, while helping that sport achieve NCAA championship status.\n\nWhen the NCAA adopted the recommendations of the Gender Equity Task Force in 1994, one of the recommendations was the creation of the list of emerging sports for women to help close the participation gap between men’s and women’s sports. Nine sports were on the original list. Since then, five sports have become championship sports (beach volleyball, rowing, ice hockey, water polo and bowling), while others have been added or removed from the list.\n\nIn 2022-23, emerging sports accounted for over 4,200 participation opportunities for student-athletes based on NCAA Sports Sponsorship and Participation Rates data. Institutions may use emerging sports to meet minimum sports-sponsorship requirements and, in Divisions I and II, minimum financial aid requirements.\n\nPotential sports must apply to the program for consideration. If sports are recommended by CWA and added to the program through the divisional governance structure, the sport leaders work to expand the sport in the collegiate space by adding more NCAA programs. The NCAA supports emerging sports by sharing information about the sports, providing guidance and feedback, and working with the Committee on Women’s Athletics to receive updates and disseminate information to the divisions as needed.\n\nCurrent NCAA emerging sports for women:\n\nLearn more about the current six emerging sports for women below. While in the program, the sport governing bodies lead efforts to grow the sport and work directly with NCAA member schools interested in adding programs.\n\nAcrobatics and tumbling\n\nGoverning body: National Collegiate Acrobatics & Tumbling Association\n\nSeason of competition: Spring\n\n2022-23 Sport Sponsorship: 37 teams\n\nDI – 4\n\nDII – 26\n\nDIII - 7\n\nEquestrian (Divisions I and II only)\n\nGoverning body: National Collegiate Equestrian Association\n\nSeason of competition: Spring\n\n2022-23 Sport Sponsorship: 22 teams\n\nDI – 19\n\nDII – 3\n\nRugby\n\nGoverning bodies: National Intercollegiate Rugby Association and USA Rugby\n\nSeason of competition: Fall\n\n2022-23 Sport Sponsorship: 29 teams\n\nDI – 10\n\nDII – 9\n\nDIII – 10\n\nStunt\n\nGoverning body: USA Cheer\n\nSeason of competition: Spring\n\n2022-23 Sport Sponsorship: Not available.
