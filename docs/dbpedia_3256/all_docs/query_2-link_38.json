        "text": "Steve Miller will serve on his sixth U.S. National Junior Team in 2024. He helped the United States earn gold in 2017 and 2021, silver in 2019, and bronze in 2019.\n\nA three-time NCAA national champion as an assistant coach (Providence – 2015; Denver – 2004, 2005), Miller’s 34-year coaching career began in 1989 and has seen him contribute to 21 NCAA Tournament berths, five Frozen Four appearances, six conference tournament titles, and six regular-season league championships during his time with St. Mary’s University, Miami (Ohio) University, University of Denver, Providence College, Air Force Academy, Ohio State University, and now at the University of Minnesota\n\nThe 2023-24 season marks Miller's second campaign as associate head coach for the University of Minnesota's men's hockey team. In his first season behind the bench, Miller helped the Gophers to a frozen four and national championship game appearance.\n\nPreviously, Miller served as an associate head coach for the Ohio State University men’s ice hockey team from 2018-22. During the 2018-19 campaign, Miller helped lead the Buckeyes to their first Big Ten regular-season conference title in program history, just one year after reaching the 2018 NCAA Frozen Four for just the second time in program history.\n\nPrior to joining Ohio State in July 2017, Miller enjoyed successful stints with both the Air Force Academy (2015-17) and Providence College (2014-15). As director of hockey for Air Force, Miller helped the Falcons capture the 2017 Atlantic Hockey Championship and an NCAA Elite Eight berth. As an assistant coach for the Providence Friars, Miller helped the program claim its first-ever national championship with a 4-3 victory over Boston University in the championship game.\n\nFrom 1994-2014, Miller enjoyed 20 seasons at the University of Denver, including as an associate head coach during his final three seasons. Named an assistant coach for the Pioneers in 1994, Miller helped the Pioneers claim back-to-back NCAA National Championships in 2004 and 2005, three WCHA regular-season championships and four WCHA Tournament (Final Five) titles. Additionally, his time at Denver saw him coach and recruit 41 NHL Draft picks, 55 All-WCHA honorees, 14 World Junior Championship participants, 15 All-Americans, one Hobey Baker Award winner, four WCHA Student-Athletes of the Year, three WCHA Defensive Players of the Year, two WCHA MVPs, one WCHA Rookie of the Year and two Frozen Four Most Outstanding Players. For his efforts, Miller was tabbed the recipient of the 2009 American Hockey Coaches Association’s Terry Flanagan Award, which recognizes an assistant coach’s body of work.\n\nMiller joined Denver after spending two seasons as a graduate assistant at Miami University and one season at his alma mater, St. Mary’s University, where he played three seasons. In 1989, he was behind the bench as St. Mary’s captured the 1989 MAC playoff championship and advanced to the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament."
