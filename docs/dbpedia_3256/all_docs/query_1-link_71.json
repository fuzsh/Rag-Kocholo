        "text": "A RENEWED VISION\n\nIt all begins with a new head coach.\n\nEric Lang played AIC hockey from 1994 to 1998, serving as captain for two of those seasons, and returned to the program as a graduate assistant coach from 2006 to 2008. Lang is no stranger to what makes the College an institution like no other. But what he accomplished between those years is what made his hiring as AIC’s new men’s hockey head coach so exciting.\n\nAt Manhattanville College, Lang posted a career coaching record of 71-31-6, guiding the Valiants to two ECAC East Championships during his tenure from 2008 to 2012. Lang advanced his career further by joining the Army coaching staff in 2012. While at West Point, he served as the Black Knights’ recruiting coordinator before his responsibilities branched into everything from handling the power play to video analysis and on-ice skill development.\n\nMost importantly, Lang was instrumental in the resurgence of Army hockey. The Black Knights finished last in league play prior to Lang’s arrival at West Point—now the rebuild is complete as Army is coming off back-to-back final four appearances in Atlantic hockey.\n\nIN OTHER WORDS, ERIC LANG KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES TO BUILD A WINNING PROGRAM, AND HAS THE PRIDE THAT ONLY AN AIC ALUMNUS CAN FEEL.\n\nAIC’S GOAL IS TO NOT ONLY BUILD A BETTER PROGRAM, BUT BETTER PLAYERS, BETTER STUDENTS, BETTER MEN, AND A BETTER COMMUNITY.\n\nNew Home, Same Passion\n\nWhen you are competing with the types of high-profile, nationally ranked teams that AIC is now playing, you need a state-of-the-art arena to match. That is why AIC made the MassMutual Center in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts its home ice.\n\nThe move increases our crowd capacity from 2,200 to 6,800, and provides a venue with 222 club seats, a new bar and lounge, club room, executive suite, an 18×12-foot, 4-sided center hung LED video board, and an LED lighting system throughout the arena.\n\nThink of the men’s hockey program as a rocket ready to take off and the MassMutual Center as our new launching pad.\n\nDedication Off the Ice\n\nAnyone who knows the sport knows that hockey players are a different breed.\n\nThey play a demanding game that is rooted in respect and highlighted by moments of grace. Hockey is a sport that requires methodical dedication, yet players always find time to give back to their community. The players who put on the Yellow Jackets jersey are no exception.\n\nThe team achieved a perfect Academic Progress Rate (a statistic used to track student-athletes’ chances of graduation) of 1000 during the 2014–15 season, and have a four-year average of 993.\n\nIn 2017, Coach Lang and his team began supporting AIC’s partnership with Square One, a private, nonprofit organization in Springfield, Massachusetts that provides early education and other services for children and families."
