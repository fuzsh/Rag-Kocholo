        "text": "Men's Basketball to Honor Bill Curley, 1993-94 Elite Eight Squad\n\nCHESTNUT HILL, Mass. — In conjunction with the February 17 game versus Miami, Boston College Athletics will retire the jersey of former men's basketball standout Bill Curley and celebrate the 25th anniversary of the 1993-94 team's run to the NCAA Elite Eight.\n\n\"There are few greater honors than to have your jersey retired and for the banner to hang in the rafters at Conte Forum,\" said Martin Jarmond, the William V. Campbell Director of Athletics. \"For Bill, it is the culmination of a tremendous collegiate career and one of the great stories of a homegrown player who came from Duxbury to the Heights. It will be a great moment for Boston College to recognize Bill and his family.\"\n\nA 1994 NABC All-American and two-time All-Big East First Team selection, Curley finished his career with 2,102 points and 996 rebounds – ranking fourth all-time in Boston College history in both statistical categories. He was the 12th-fastest player in BC history to reach the 1,000 career point mark and is one of only seven players in program history to score better than 2,000 points in his career. The 1991 Big East Rookie of the Year, Curley ranks fourth all-time in career field goal percentage, connecting on 56.5% of his shot attempts.\n\nCurley was a three-year team captain and started all but three games of his 126-game career for Boston College, averaging 16.7 points and 7.9 rebounds per game. He was named the 1993-94 Eagle of the Year and was inducted into the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nHe was a first round draft pick of the San Antonio Spurs in the 1994 NBA Draft, selected 22nd overall and went on to play six seasons with Detroit, Minnesota, Portland, Golden State, Dallas, and Houston.\n\nDuring the 1993-94 season, Curley and his Eagles teammates embarked on one of the most memorable seasons in program history. Under head coach Jim O'Brien, Boston College finished with a 23-11 overall record and an 11-7 mark in Big East play. The Eagles reached as high as No. 18 on the Associated Press top 25 and spent 13 weeks on the poll. BC earned an at-large bid to the 1994 NCAA Tournament, as the No. 9 seed in the East region.\n\nAfter beating Washington State, 67-64, in the first round, BC advanced to face the No. 1 overall seed and defending national champion - North Carolina. Boston College knocked down 12 3-pointers for the game and Curley scored 10 of the Eagles' final 11 points in the 75-72 victory at the U.S. Airways Arena in Landover, Md. In the Sweet 16 round in Miami, Fla., BC took down No. 5 seed Indiana, 77-68, before falling in the East Regional championship game to third-seeded Florida, 74-66.\n\n\"I am excited to welcome back the 1993-94 team to campus and celebrate that amazing run to the Elite Eight,\" Jarmond said. \"Their achievements are a constant reminder – from the trophy cases in Conte Forum and the hallways around our men's basketball offices, to the loyal fans who have so many special memories of that season. The 1993-94 team re-established Boston College basketball as a national brand.\"\n\nAnother historic era in men's basketball will be celebrated on March 9 in conjunction with the final regular season home game vs. N.C. State. The 1966-67, 1967-68, and the 1968-69 squads will be honored for their appearances in the NCAA and National Invitation Tournament.\n\nThe three teams - under the tutelage of head coach and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer Bob Cousy – made two appearances in the NCAA Tournament and played in one NIT. The 1966-67 team advanced to the program's first-ever NCAA Elite Eight, downing Connecticut and St. John's before losing to North Carolina in the East regional championship.\n\nThe following year – the 1967-68 team elevated to a No. 6 ranking on the Associated Press top 20 poll during the regular season and was rewarded again with another trip to the NCAA Tournament. The 1968-69 team shined bright at Madison Square Garden in New York City. BC was ranked as high as No. 16 on the AP poll and advanced to the NIT championship, losing to Temple in the title game.\n\nTo purchase tickets or for more information, visit the Boston College box office or call at (617) 552-GOBC (4622) or visit BCEagles.com."
