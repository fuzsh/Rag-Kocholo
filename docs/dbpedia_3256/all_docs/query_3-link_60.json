        "text": "HOCKEY EAST TIEBREAKERS\n\n(Only Applied At End Of Regular Season)\n\nSeeding of teams for the Hockey East Tournament will be determined by the Hockey East standings upon the conclusion of the regular season. If two or more teams are tied for first in points for the regular-season championship, they will be considered co-regular season champions.\n\nThree points will be awarded after each Hockey East conference game in the following manner:\n\nThree points for a win in regulation.\n\nTwo points for an overtime or shootout win.\n\nOne point for an overtime or shootout loss.\n\nZero points for a regulation loss.\n\nPOSTPONEMENT/CANCELLATION OF GAMES: FINAL STANDINGS\n\nIf, after all reasonable efforts are put forth to re-schedule games and a complete league schedule cannot be completed, the Commissioner, in concert with the appropriate Executive Committee, may determine that the standings will be determined not by points but by points percentage.\n\nTiebreaking procedures:\n\nThree-on-three overtime and shootout results will only be considered when breaking ties between two teams. When ties involve three or more teams, overtime and shootout results will not be used to break ties for Hockey East Tournament seeding.\n\nIn the event one or more teams are tied with the same number of points (or points percentage if applicable) at the end of the regular season, seeding for the Hockey East Tournament will be determined according to the following procedures, applied successively until each tie is broken:\n\n1. If only two teams are tied, best head-to-head points percentage. If more than two teams are tied, move to criterion 2.\n\n2. Best regulation winning percentage in all conference games;\n\n3. Greatest number of regulation wins in all conference games (See note below);\n\n4. Best regulation winning percentage against other teams currently included in the tie;\n\n5. Best regulation winning percentage against the highest ranked Hockey East teams, successively, until the tie is broken or all Hockey East regular-season contests have been considered;\n\n6. Greatest goal differential in regulation play against other teams currently included in the tie;\n\n7. Coin flip\n\nIn the case of ties among three or more schools, the criteria will be used in order until the top team or teams are separated from the rest. At that point, the process will begin anew to break the “new” tie(s) with all remaining teams. In other words, when a four-way tie becomes a three-way tie, the three-way tie is treated as a “new” tie and the process begins with the first criterion.\n\nNote: If the final standings are determined by points percentage due to an incomplete league schedule, criterion #2 (greatest number of regulation wins in all conference games) shall apply only in situations unaffected by any unplayed contests. If the possible outcomes of any unplayed contests could alter the results of the comparisons, then criterion #2 shall not apply and the tiebreaker shall proceed through the remaining criteria.\n\nExample #1: Team A played all scheduled games and has 15 regulation wins. Team B missed two scheduled contests and has 12 regulation wins. Since Team A would have more regulation wins regardless of what may have happened in the unplayed contests Team A wins the tiebreaker.\n\nExample #2: Team A played all scheduled games and has 12 regulation wins. Team B missed one scheduled contest and has 13 regulation wins. Since Team B has more regulation wins despite the unplayed contest Team B wins the tiebreaker.\n\nExample #3: Team A played all scheduled games and has 13 regulation wins. Team B missed two scheduled contests and has 12 regulation wins. Since the missing contests could result in Team B having 12, 13, or 14 regulation wins, criterion #2 shall not apply.\n\nExample #4: Team A missed one scheduled game and has 15 regulation wins. Team B played all scheduled games and has 13 regulation wins. Team C missed two scheduled games and has 12 regulation wins. Since Team A would have more regulation wins regardless of any unplayed contests Team A wins the tiebreaker, and procedures are re-started on the remaining tie between Teams B and C."
