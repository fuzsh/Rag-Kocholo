        "text": "Birth of Elizabeth II\n\nPrincess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary was born at 2:40 a.m. at the London home of her maternal grandparents, Claude and Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, the Earl and Countess of Strathmore. Her parents were Prince Albert, Duke of York (the future George VI), second son of the reigning King George V, and the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nAbdication Crisis\n\nKing George V died on 20 January 1936. Elizabeth’s uncle succeeded to throne as King Edward VIII. However, he reigned for only 11 months before abdicating on 10 December to marry a twice-divorced American woman, Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth was third in line for the throne at the time of her birth, but with the ascension of her father as King George VI, she became the heiress presumptive. Her family soon moved into Buckingham Palace.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nElizabeth’s First Radio Broadcast\n\nAt age 14, Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast, addressing the children of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth as part of the BBC Children’s Hour. “My sister, Margaret Rose and I, feel so much for you as we know from experience what it means to be away from those we love most of all,” she said. “To you living in new surroundings, we send a message of true sympathy.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nElizabeth’s Military Service\n\nIn 1945, Elizabeth became the first female member of the royal family to become a full-time active member of the British Armed Forces. She joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service as a subaltern and trained as a driver and a mechanic. By the end of the war, she had risen to the rank of junior commander. The Queen is the only current head of state who served in uniform during the Second World War.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nFirst Overseas Visit and Commonwealth Pledge\n\nFrom February to April 1947, Elizabeth made her first overseas visit. She travelled with her parents and younger sister to South Africa and what is now Zimbabwe. She celebrated her 21st birthday in South Africa. In a radio broadcast from Cape Town, she committed herself to a lifetime of public service devoted to the Commonwealth, stating, “I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nEngagement to Prince Philip\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBuckingham Palace announced the engagement of Elizabeth and Prince Philip, the son of Prince Andrew of Greece and the great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria. Elizabeth had met Philip in childhood and first became interested in him when he gave her a tour of the Dartmouth Naval College in 1939. They corresponded throughout the Second World War. Philip spent periods of leave from the Royal Navy at Windsor Castle.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nElizabeth’s Royal Wedding\n\nElizabeth and Philip were married at Westminster Abbey in London. The ceremony was broadcast over BBC radio to an audience of 200 million people around the world, allowing Canada to share in the celebrations. Elizabeth received more than 2,500 wedding gifts. Prime Minister Mackenzie King sent the royal couple antique silver as a wedding gift, as well as a mink coat for the Princess.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nBirth of Prince Charles\n\nThe royal couple’s first child, Prince Charles, was born via Caesarean section in a Buckingham Palace guest room that Town and Country reported was turned into a “miniature hospital.” Elizabeth intended to be a hands-on mother and nursed Charles until she caught the measles when he was two months old. George VI’s declining health, however, meant that Elizabeth assumed a demanding schedule of royal engagements while her children were young. As Queen, her extensive Commonwealth tours resulted in her children spending long periods with nannies and with their grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nRoyal Tour of Canada Begins\n\nElizabeth visited Canada for the first time in the autumn of 1951, accompanied by Philip. The royal couple were representing George VI, who had just undergone surgery for lung cancer. There was tremendous popular interest in the tour. They were the first royal couple to visit Canada via transatlantic aircraft rather than ship. They threw themselves into Canadian pastimes, attending a hockey game at Maple Leaf Gardens and a demonstration of the Calgary Stampede and square dancing at Rideau Hall. They were well-received by Canadians from all walks of life, though Elizabeth appeared to be quieter and more reserved than the gregarious Philip.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nDeath of George VI\n\nGeorge VI died on 6 February 1952 while Elizabeth and Philip were representing him on a trip to Kenya. The 25-year-old Princess automatically succeeded to throne as Queen Elizabeth II. The new Queen and her husband immediately returned to the United Kingdom and ascended to the throne in a climate of tremendous public goodwill. Both her father and grandfather had been second sons who were not raised to be King but Elizabeth had been heiress presumptive from a young age and was extremely popular.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nQueen Elizabeth II Coronation\n\nElizabeth II was crowned Queen at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953. She made history by becoming the first monarch to be crowned Head of the Commonwealth and Queen of Canada. She was also the first monarch whose coronation was televised. Her dress included symbols from the Commonwealth realms, with embroidered maple leaves representing Canada (see also Emblems of Canada). The Queen’s unprecedented decision to permit television cameras to film the coronation allowed the entire Commonwealth to share in the celebrations. An estimated 277 million people around the world watched the coronation, many purchasing their first television set for the occasion. The coronation became the first transatlantic television broadcast, as the footage was flown to Canada to be shown on the CBC. Prime Minister Louis St-Laurent attended the coronation in London while Governor General Vincent Massey presided over the celebrations on Parliament Hill, which were attended by 100,000 people.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nFirst monarch to open Parliament in Canada\n\nOn 14 October 1957, Queen Elizabeth II became the first sovereign to open a session of Canada’s Parliament in person. She read the Speech from the Throne, a duty usually undertaken by her representative in Canada, the governor general. In her 1957 Christmas broadcast, the Queen reflected on the historic moment, stating “Last October I opened the new Canadian Parliament, and as you know this was the first time that any sovereign had done so in Ottawa. Once again I was overwhelmed by the loyalty and enthusiasm of my Canadian people.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nBirth of Prince Andrew\n\nQueen Elizabeth II gave birth to Prince Andrew at Buckingham Palace at 3:30 p.m. As with her first two children, Elizabeth gave birth to Andrew using a method called “twilight sleep” — she was anaesthetized and the baby was delivered using forceps. Andrew’s birth marked the first time since 1857 that a child was born to a reigning British monarch.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nControversial Visit to Quebec\n\nUntil the 1960s, the monarchy was popular in Quebec because the Crown was viewed as a protector of minority rights. However, during the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, attitudes toward the monarchy changed and the Queen was seen as a symbol of British oppression. After addressing the National Assembly in French, the Queen faced crowds of protesters who turned their backs on her and chanted, “Elizabeth, go home.” The police crackdown on these protests became known as “Truncheon Sunday.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nNew Flag Adopted\n\nA new national flag of Canada was adopted after much debate. The Senate gave its approval on 17 December. Queen Elizabeth signed the royal proclamation on 28 January and the new flag, with its red maple leaf and side bars, flew officially for the first time on 15 February 1965.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\n100th Anniversary of the Northwest Territories\n\nThe Queen visited remote communities along the Arctic Circle with Philip and her two eldest children, Charles and Anne. This high-profile tour officially marked the 100th anniversary of the Northwest Territories. But it also provided the Queen with the opportunity to engage with the Inuit and to affirm Canada’s sovereignty over the Arctic through her presence in the region.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nSilver Jubilee\n\nThe celebrations to mark the Queen’s 25th anniversary as monarch began on 6 February. Elizabeth spent the day with her family at Windsor Castle. Church services to mark the occasion were held all month. The full jubilee celebrations were held in London on 6–7 June.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nGold Jubilee\n\nThe celebrations to commemorate Elizabeth’s 50th year on the throne were organized around six themes: Celebration, Community, Service, Past and future, Giving thanks, and Commonwealth. Elizabeth and Philip travelled extensively, attending events in every region of the UK, as well as in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Jamaica. In each country, the Queen lit beacons to form a chain of 2,006 lights across the Commonwealth. The main Gold Jubilee celebrations took place in London in June and included performances by Paul McCartney, Bryan Adams, Elton John and Shirley Bassey.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nQueen Re-dedicates the Vimy Memorial\n\nQueen Elizabeth II re-dedicated the Vimy memorial at Vimy, France, on the 90th anniversary of the battle. In her speech she said, “In any national story there are moments and places, sometimes far from home, which in retrospect can be seen as fixed points about which the course of history turns, moments which distinguish that nation for ever. Those who seek the foundations of Canada’s distinction would do well to begin here at Vimy.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nDeath of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died at age 96 at Balmoral Castle in Scotland with the Royal Family by her side. They had gathered there earlier that day after doctors had expressed concern for her health and put her under medical supervision. Having occupied the throne for 70 years and 214 days, Elizabeth was Britain’s longest-reigning monarch and the second-longest reigning monarch in recorded history. She was Queen of Canada for almost half of the country’s existence. Upon her death, Charles automatically ascended to the role of king. He became the 62nd British monarch and, at age 73, the oldest ever to assume the throne."
