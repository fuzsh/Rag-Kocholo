        "text": "Brian went to be with his Lord and Savior and Master, Jesus Christ, on March 25th 2018 at 1:30 am. He is now reunited with his wife, Christy, whom he absolutely adored, and who passed away on 7/8/2011. He will also be with the three children he never met, two miscarried and one stillborn, a son, Joseph James, as well as with his mother, Gladys Esslinger. He leaves behind the love of his life, his son, Jesse Jeremiah, who allowed him to have the only title he ever coveted on this Earth, Dad. Brian tried to live his life for Jesus first, and then for his family. For nearly 25 years he was a probation and parole officer for the State of Louisiana, which allowed him to minister to thousands of people. He surrendered Assembly of God credentials and no longer sought to preach, but instead chose to work with the ones often unwanted by anybody, even their families, and many whom had been hurt by churches.\n\nAs an evangelist, he had committed his life to bring people to Jesus, especially those who were outsiders to society and desperately in need of Gods love. In his later years, Brian worked as a library tech at the Main Library on Goodwood Blvd.\n\nBrian was born and raised in Summit, NJ, and was graduated from Summit High School in 1966. He then earned a BA in History at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. After 8 years of doing probation work in Elizabeth, NJ, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City to pursue an acting career. After finishing the two year evening program, he began doing non paying showcase plays in NYC just for exposure. He did small parts on Soap Operas and in various movies, but was most successful in the area of television commercials.\n\nFalling victim to the same alcoholism that killed his father at age 54, Brian entered Alcoholics Anonymous, where he met his wife to be, Christy Clifford, who was also an actor. From then on for 38 years and to date of passing he remained sober. They were married in Our Lady of Ransom Catholic Church in Niles, Illinois, in the Chicago area, in 1982. In 1983 they both became Born Again Christians through the television ministry of Baton Rouge evangelist Jimmy Swaggart. Brian felt called into full time ministry, so Christy gave up her career and followed her husband to Trinity Bible College in Ellendale, N. D. Brian then took a position as an assistant pastor at a Foursquare Church in Mooresville, N.C. Within a year God had called Brian to the Baton Rouge area, where he and his wife settled down and began a beautiful life in a city they grew to love. God called Brian and Christy back into drama when they were asked to perform short dramas in churches around town. Christy began writing her own plays with Brian's editing and input. She became published with Lifeway, the Southern Baptist organization, formerly known as the Sunday School Board. They both performed and directed short weekly dramas done in church services, and also longer projects like the Easter Pageant, The Burning Light, and the 9/11 commemorative drama, and The Carpenter's Hope at Istrouma Baptist Church.\n\nChristy had Lupus and struggled with overwhelming health issues for almost the entire time they were together. It was a joy and an honor for Brian to be her caretaker, and also to support her writing career.\n\nIn the later years of his life, Brian became Roman Catholic, which was the religion of Christy's family, for whom he had enormous respect. He then decided after a period of time that he was more accustomed to Pentecostal beliefs.\n\nViewing at Resthaven Funeral Home, 11817 Jefferson Highway, (225)-753-1440, on April 2nd from 10am to 12pm, after which there will be a non denominational Christian service then immediately following he will be buried next to his beloved Christy in Resthaven Garden of Redemption.\n\nVisitation\n\nResthaven Funeral Home\n\n11817 Jefferson Highway\n\nBaton Rouge, LA 70816\n\nMonday, April 2, 2018\n\n10:00 am - 12:00 pm\n\nService\n\nResthaven Funeral Home\n\n11817 Jefferson Highway\n\nBaton Rouge, LA 70816\n\nMonday, April 2, 2018\n\n12:00 PM\n\nCemetery\n\nResthaven Gardens of Memory\n\n11817 Jefferson Highway\n\nBaton Rouge, LA 70816"
