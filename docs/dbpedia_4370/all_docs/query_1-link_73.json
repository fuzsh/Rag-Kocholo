        "text": "English majors can earn the English B.A. by completing the requirements listed below. Or, English majors can elect to pursue one of four concentrations within the English major: English Creative Writing, English Cultural Studies, English Literature, or English Writing & Rhetoric. Details about these concentrations, including how to complete each concentration, are listed in the Catalog following this primary entry. Students who complete a concentration in English will have the English B.A. degree and also the concentration listed on their transcript.\n\nStudents must complete the following two core courses (6 credits):\n\nENGL 195 - Intro to English Studies\n\nENGL 400 - Seminar in Literary Research\n\nStudents must complete one course (3 credits) from the following category:\n\nBuilding Foundations: Literary Surveys\n\nENGL 205 - Survey English Lit I\n\nENGL 206 - Survey English Lit II\n\nENGL 207 - American Lit Survey I\n\nENGL 208 - Amer Lit Sur II 1865-Present\n\nStudents must complete one course (3 credits) from the following category:\n\nExpanding Foundations: Literary Histories\n\nENGL 225 - Classical Literature\n\nENGL 275 - Modern American Fiction\n\nENGL 276 - Contemporary American Lit\n\nENGL 300 - Medieval Literature\n\nENGL 305 - Chaucer\n\nENGL 310 - Renaissance Poetry & Prose\n\nENGL 315 - Shakespeare\n\nENGL 316 - Shakespeare’s Tragedies\n\nENGL 318 - Explorers and Exiles in Paris\n\nENGL 325 - The 17th Century: Poetry/Prose\n\nENGL 330 - The Eighteenth Century\n\nENGL 335 - The Major English Romantics\n\nENGL 340 - The Major Victorians\n\nENGL 353 - African-American Literature\n\nENGL 365 - American Romanticism\n\nENGL 370 - American Realism\n\nENGL 385 - Masterpieces of European Lit\n\nStudents must complete one course (3 credits) from the following category:\n\nGaining Perspective: Culture, Identity, & Difference\n\nENGL 214 - Cyberpunk/Technoculture\n\nENGL 224 - LGTBQ+ Experiences & Lit\n\nENGL 234 - Literature by Women\n\nENGL 236 - Hip Hop Literature & Culture\n\nENGL 239 - American Studies I\n\nENGL 240 - Literature to Film\n\nENGL 257 - Latin American Literature\n\nENGL 267 - Caribbean Literature\n\nENGL 268 - Harlem Renaissance\n\nENGL 269 - Hispanic Latino Lit\n\nAnd students must complete one course (3 credits) from the following category:\n\nDeveloping Your Voice: Writing, Rhetoric, & Style\n\nENGL 209 - Writing for the Professions\n\nENGL 210 - Cultural Rhetorics\n\nENGL 217 - Creative Writing : Fiction\n\nENGL 218 - Creative Writing: Poetry\n\nENGL 219 - Creative Writing: Nonfiction\n\nENGL 265 - Introduction to Playwriting\n\nENGL 304 - Mod Engl Writing with Style\n\nENGL 306 - Secret Life Words & Sentences\n\nENGL 319 - Advanced Creative Writing\n\nAdditionally, students have 18 major-elective credits to complete. These credits can be drawn from any combination of the above categories and the two elective categories listed below:\n\nExploring Further: Genre Studies & Textual Transformations\n\nENGL 212 - Science Fiction\n\nENGL 220 - The Short Story\n\nENGL 223 - Murder, Mystery, & Suspense\n\nENGL 235 - True Stories:Memoir,Essay& Bio\n\nENGL 249 - American Gothic\n\nENGL 271 - Modrn British Novel:1900-Prsnt\n\nENGL 280 - History of Drama\n\nENGL 281 - Modern Drama\n\nENGL 285 - Modern Poetry\n\nENGL 301 - Utopian Literature\n\nCrossing Borders & Disciplines\n\nENGL 215 - Literature and Medicine\n\nENGL 222 - The Graphic Novel\n\nENGL 230 - The Bible as Literature\n\nENGL 238 - Sport Literature\n\nENGL 242 - Literature and Psychology\n\nENGL 259 - Oral Performance of Literature\n\nENGL 263 - Black Atlantic:Lit/History\n\nENGL 290 - World Lit-Beyond Borders\n\nForeign language requirement: English majors must complete 6 credits of a foreign language. The 6 credits do not have to be in the same language, but it is recommended that they be. 3 of these credits will come from the student’s Gen Ed Language & Cultural Perspectives disciplinary group requirement; the other 3 will be drawn from either the student’s Gen Ed Liberal Arts Electives or from Open Electives.\n\nNotes\n\nENGL 195 should be taken as soon as possible, preferably in the semester immediately following completion of ENGL 112 or ENGL/HONR 192. Transfer students should ideally take ENGL 195 in the first semester upon transferring in.\n\nENGL 400 is the capstone course, meaning the final course in the English major. It should be taken in the final semester of the program, or at least in the penultimate semester if a student foresees scheduling conflicts for the final semester.\n\nENGL 294 Major Authors and ENGL 295 Special Topics are generic course codes under which can run a number of new or experimental courses. ENGL 397 Independent Study is a course code by which a student might, in rare and special circumstances, pursue a unique course of study. Courses running by these codes will default to working as major electives. If a course running by one of these codes makes sense as a substitution for a category requirement, though, students can request of the Program Director that a substitution be allowed to let the course count for the category requirement.\n\nThe English program highly recommends that English majors earn a minor to complement their English major. Students can earn a minor in another field such as Media Studies, History, Design & Animation, or Communication Studies (to name just a few) by completing 15 credits in that field. English majors have a total of 42 non-major elective credits to spend (24 Open Elective credits plus 18 General Education Liberal Arts & Sciences Elective credits) and so have ample opportunity to earn a minor. To learn more, speak with your PACT mentor or contact the English Program Director.\n\nENGL 380 Workplace Experience I, and ENGL 381 Workplace Experience II, are internship codes that allow students to complete internship experience. Such internship credits count as Open Elective credits. Students interested in seeking internship opportunities should speak with the Mercy College Office of Career & Professional Development, the Chair of the Department of Literature and Language, and/or the Director of Undergraduate English.\n\nThe English major has an 18 credit residency requirement."
