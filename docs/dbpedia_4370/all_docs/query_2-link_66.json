        "text": "Queen Elizabeth II died on Thursday, in Scotland, ending a reign of seventy years, which began in Winston Churchill’s second premiership, in the early nineteen-fifties. She is succeeded by her son, who will now be called Charles III. The Queen’s death has initiated a period of sustained mourning in the United Kingdom, and elsewhere around the world, and has kicked off debates about the value of constitutional monarchy. To discuss the Queen’s life, and the future of Britain, I spoke by phone with Simon Schama, a historian who is the author of many books on British history, a contributing editor at the Financial Times, and a professor at Columbia University. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed whether the monarchy really is apolitical, as its proponents often claim, what admiration for royalty has in common with religion, and how the British people are likely to view their new head of state.\n\nWhat is it exactly that you and other people are mourning?\n\nThe extraordinary thing is when you manage, against all the odds, to actually make the “family” bit of the Royal Family work, notwithstanding that three of your children’s marriages collapsed and there were sundry disasters. The marriage between her and Philip was amazingly durable. The weird flip side is that, if you succeed even on a fantastical level of having a nation as a kind of hugely extended family, you feel your mom is gone, really. You do feel a kind of mother or grandmother or auntie has left, even though you knew she was very much coming to the end of her allotted term of years. I think that’s what a lot of people are feeling.\n\nOne of the truisms, or platitudes, really, is that she’s the only monarch everybody has ever known. But not me. I’m so old that I remember her father quite well, who died in 1952. She had both an uncle and a father who didn’t really want to be king. Her uncle abdicated, and her father was stricken by shyness. He upped his chain-smoking during the war and afterward, and was dead of lung cancer. And so I kind of remember the transition from this relatively young but utterly wasted and collapsed father to this young woman who had to remake the institution all over again. Psychologically, everything’s a bit off-kilter, as it is with a family member passing.\n\nOrwell said England was “a family with the wrong members in control.”\n\nRight.\n\nBut how do you like that idea? What does that idea mean to you? Is it something to strive for as a country?\n\nWell, why have a constitutional monarchy at all? In the nineteenth century, the answer was that it seemed to be better than autocracy on the one hand and revolution on the other. Even as Queen Victoria’s powers were stripped down, she reinvented the possibility of an authority that had not worked before. Walter Bagehot, the constitutional writer, made a case for constitutional monarchy as something that was morally exemplary, that had august ceremony built into it. But then he said something really much more interesting. He said it should be intelligible to ordinary people. And that’s where the family came in—if [people] could somehow see the royalty as the embodiment of the nation, the mysterious and magical inheritor of an endless past, but also, in some respects, as absolutely, recognizably human just like them, then you pulled off an amazing political stunt.\n\nIt’s a tricky thing to bring off, but it all begins with a sense of how the nation wants to see itself embodied in figures, whether they’re wheels of the political system, or a messianic despot like Vladimir Putin. Is there a way of actually constructing an identity to which you belong, which is above the egotistical abrasiveness of politics? That’s what the Queen represented, and that’s what Charles has to carry on.\n\nYou just said that the royals had pulled off an amazing political stunt, and then mentioned them being separate from politics. I’ve noticed this tension a lot in the obituaries, which talk about Elizabeth bringing unity and stability and upholding tradition. These are things people are welcome to be in favor of, but I would not exactly say that they’re apolitical.\n\nThat’s very interesting and astute. The institution of monarchy, like everything else, is necessarily a political choice. You’re probably right, but I think a much more interesting thing is that the Queen ostensibly stuck very rigorously to political neutrality. Was she for the E.U., was she for leaving the E.U., was she against leaving it? There was a hullabaloo when she wore a hat with the colors of the E.U. flag, complete with gold trimming. But I think the unexamined texts of her reign are her Christmas messages. I thought they would be the most anodyne, vanilla, absolutely nonpolitical statements. But, very famously, in the 1983 Christmas Day message, she said that the most serious problem the world had was the division between rich and poor countries. And she got into trouble for that. Similarly, she was known to be in favor of sanctions against apartheid South Africa, which is why Nelson Mandela loved her so much.\n\nThis brought about a certain amount of tension with the government of Margaret Thatcher.\n\nThat’s right, and that was why some thought she’d actually extended the royal prerogative illegitimately, as coded, or refined, or nuanced as it might be in a Christmas message. This was kind of an acceptable way of moving out of her ostensible neutrality. And then there was an attempt in Rhodesia during the Unilateral Declaration of Independence to say that it was what the Queen really wanted. That’s what [the Rhodesian Prime Minister] Ian Smith said, even though she followed the government line [in opposition to Rhodesian independence led by its white minority].\n\nRight, we can sit here and say that we’re glad the Queen didn’t support the Universal Declaration of Independence in Rhodesia in the mid-sixties, and we’re glad that she wanted sanctions against South Africa in the eighties. Or we could talk about the recent Guardian series about certain laws the monarchy is exempt from. But all of these things are political. Not partisan necessarily, but political.\n\nI don’t disagree with any of that, but I think if we look around the world, not just to Putin but to someone like Narendra Modi, there’s this issue of establishing a sense of national community or national identity against the people who do not belong to it. That’s what Modi is doing. That’s what Xi Jinping is doing. That is emphatically what Putin is doing, and it’s what Trump was doing. So you are right to be skeptical about the possibility of the monarchy ever being a completely apolitical institution. But it’s a political institution that seeks to do the least harm. In that respect, it’s been improbably successful.\n\nWhat did the Queen herself do that meant something to people? You’re laughing.\n\nWhat is the fairy dust? Who the hell knows? On the surface, it’s so paradoxical. Lord Altrincham—John Grigg—who was a fierce critic of the monarchy of the Queen in the nineteen-sixties, described her as being the captain of the school hockey team or something like that, and therefore not really fit to know the world. Very interestingly, he took it all back, and said, “Well, the reason why she behaves decently is because she is authentically an absolutely decent person.” It’s very striking coming from him. It seems an extraordinary paradox that someone from that kind of remote, esoteric, and mandarin-like distant world of horses and hounds and courtiers should actually be able to communicate spontaneously with ordinary people. If you’ve seen her do it, that’s the way it is. That’s what she does. I suspect Charles will be able to do it, too.\n\nI might argue that, if Charles is able to do it, it suggests that anyone who’s put in this position and given the surrounding pomp and circumstance will be able to do it. Maybe it’s more about what the people want to feel than what the monarch is actually doing.\n\nYou wouldn’t want to do it, because you’d have to do it every day, six times a day. Hospital here, a school there, old-age pensioners there, the Ambassador of Burkina Faso at three o’clock. You would not want to do this. At the time of the Diamond Jubilee, it was just absolutely bloody well pelting down with rain. The rain was coming down horizontally, but there were hundreds of thousands of people on the banks of the Thames. It was this vile day in May, British spring, of course, and there she and Philip were, hour upon hour. It was an absolutely appalling job, really. You have to not mind doing this over and over again. It’s a sense of vocation, which is simultaneously weirdly mystical, sort of quasi-religious. And she often sounded that way when she described it. It’s also unbelievably mundane—grindingly, relentlessly, exhaustively commonplace.\n\nI agree with you about the quasi-religious angle. I guess we should also say that there’s an established church in the United Kingdom, and she’s the official head of it, too.\n\nThat, I think, may have to change with Charles, by the way. Not that he will disestablish himself, but when they’re planning the coronation it’s an incredible kind of quasi-messianic moment for the Church of England and the Archbishop of Canterbury. I’m sure all the holy oil and everything will happen, but I think it may be led by the very forward-looking, modernizing Archbishop of Canterbury. It will have to be a more genuinely ecumenical form of coronation, and I expect that to happen among the changes that Charles makes.\n\nSome might wrinkle their noses when people say, “Oh, the Queen, such a burden she has,” when she lives in a giant house and her family is very rich. But I do think there’s something to be said for the joylessness of her role, and I find it depressing in its way. The family does not seem happy.\n\nNo, she was happy. She was definitely happy.\n\nWell—\n\nI saw her a few times. I’m sure there were moments when it was difficult.\n\nHer family doesn’t seem the happiest, let’s say. How about that? We don’t exactly know how happy she was.\n\nWell, Charles seems happy. He sure does now, with Camilla. It was obviously a pathetic and catastrophic business with Diana on both their sides, really.\n\nWell, the Queen has another son who’s had some troubles.\n\nThe Queen can be ruthlessly managerial. She was the one—Prince Charles is said to have persuaded the Queen, as a matter of fact—but they agreed, I think, that Andrew should be absolutely stripped from all his royal functions. So they share that sense that the Firm comes first, and that you cut away dead limbs.\n\nI’m suggesting that “the Firm comes first” is a tough way to have a family, and that royalty brings with it a certain degree of unhappiness for the people acting it out.\n\nIt’s very Shakespearean of you to see it that way, but that doesn’t necessarily make it wrong. Yeah, I think so. Clearly, her uncle was deeply unhappy, and gave up the crown in order to be personally happy, and then was a different kind of unhappy for the rest of his life.\n\nFascist sympathizers tend to have trouble settling down happily.\n\nI think Elizabeth had a genuinely happy childhood, but then so did her sister, and her sister came very badly unstuck. Elizabeth and Philip were happy precisely because they weren’t headed for Buckingham Palace, and this all came as a big shock. They were a genuinely warm, cuddly, integrated family. Not so much that they wouldn’t take off on some endless foreign tour, leaving Anne and Charles behind. In that sense, I’m not sure that Charles had a happy childhood. That, I think, is very questionable. You probably have a point, but are they more extravagantly unhappy than all the rest of us? Maybe not.\n\nHow do you think Britain would be different today if the monarchy had ended with Elizabeth’s father, seventy years ago?\n\nIt’s such a weird counterfactual, because it was so close to the end of the war. Churchill had come back as a very doddering, pastiche personality. The empire crumbled and disappeared, and the country needed the monarchy more than ever. But I take your point, and the only thing I have to say comes straight out of the history book: it didn’t work out very well with Oliver Cromwell. Everybody got quite sick of a British Republic quite quickly.\n\nEarlier, you suggested that the monarchy provides this way of thinking apart from the day-to-day struggles of politics, which we’re all sick and tired of and grossed out by. At the same time, it doesn’t seem like Britain has particularly avoided this kind of grotesque politics. Maybe more than the United States has, but—\n\nYou’ve answered your own question. That is not the job of the monarchy. It is to provide a different place to go and feel British. The Queen couldn’t solve the miners’ strike. She couldn’t solve the brutal wars that ended the empire in Kenya and so on. That’s not her job. The job is to provide a kind of space and style, a kind of mystique, a kind of secular religion, if you like, in which people can feel some sort of kinship and community with each other. With the country you and I live in, it’s not just political opposition between two parties but two groups who see each other essentially as enemies, actually as aliens, belonging to two different countries. The monarchy really does avoid that unless you are an absolute hard-core, as it were, sentimental republican.\n\nI obviously agree that the divisions in the United States are worse than they are in the U.K., but Britain just got through a long process, kicked off by the Brexit vote, which may not have been as calamitous as Trump or Modi, but definitely divided the country along those lines and led people to think that they lived in “remain country” or “leave country.” You talked about the country as a family. When you see Britain, when you read British tabloids, when you follow politics there, it doesn’t feel like a family.\n\nI don’t disagree with that. Britain is a divided place, as well. For a start, it’s divided between Scotland and England, so there are all kinds of divisions that are very ferocious. That’s quite true. It’s a very American thing you’re saying to me, that it’s going to be much better if you acknowledge the reality of the bitter divisions, that the monarchy and its charm and its lure are all a fantasy—to which a huge majority of Brits will say, “We love the fantasy sometimes.”"
