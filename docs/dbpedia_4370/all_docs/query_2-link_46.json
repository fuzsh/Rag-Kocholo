        "text": "On 6 February 1952, Princess Elizabeth became Queen of the United Kingdom, when her father King George VI died.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II came to the throne when she was 25-years-old.\n\nIn 2022 Queen Elizabeth II became the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum jubilee, marking 70 years on the throne.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died at Balmoral Castle on 8 September 2022.\n\nBritain is a monarchy, meaning it has a king or queen.\n\nThe monarch is the head of state, the Church of England and the armed forces.\n\nThe monarch is not voted in. The crown is inherited. This means the heir becomes monarch the moment their parent dies.\n\nThey are crowned in a coronation ceremony.\n\nBy 1066, most of England was ruled by one royal family.\n\nIn 1603, the crowns of England and Scotland were united under James I.\n\nThe British Royal Family has ruled over the United Kingdom for many hundreds of years.\n\nThe Queenâs uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated (gave up) the throne in 1936. He passed it to his brother, the Queenâs father, George VI. As King Georgeâs oldest child, this meant that Princess Elizabeth would one day be Queen.\n\nIn 1947 Princess Elizabeth married Prince Philip. He was a member of the Greek royal family and a Royal Naval officer in World War Two.\n\nIn 1948 the royal coupleâs first child, Prince Charles, was born. He is now King Charles III.\n\nIn June 1953, after the death of her father, Princess Elizabeth was crowned in Westminster Abbey. 27 million people in the UK watched it on television. 11 million people listened on the radio.\n\nThe Queen was Head of the Commonwealth and the Head of State for 16 member states.\n\nOver 20 countries were part of the British Empire when the Queen became monarch. Many gained independence during her reign."
