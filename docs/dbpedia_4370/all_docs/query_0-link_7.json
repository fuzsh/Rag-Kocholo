        "text": "The older brother of superstar Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray worked regularly for decades as a dependable comic performer, writer, and voice artist in movies and on television. A veteran of the Chicago Second City company and the \"National Lampoon Radio Hour,\" Doyle-Murray honed his writing talents on SCTV (syndicated/NBC/Cinemax, 1976-1984) and the late night juggernaut \"Saturday Night Live\" (NBC, 1975- ). His excellent timing and gruff voice made him an ideal comic antagonist and he almost invariably played characters that ran the gamut from brusque to downright obnoxious in a series of hit comedies, including \"Caddyshack\" (1980), which he co-wrote, \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" (1983), \"Scrooged\" (1988), \"Ghostbusters II\" (1989), \"Groundhog Day\" (1993), and \"Multiplicity\" (1996). He was also frequently tapped for guest roles on a wide variety of television sitcoms and was a regular on others, like Chris Elliott's cult favorite \"Get a Life\" (Fox, 1990-92). Children also came to know Doyle-Murray from his many voice artist stints on animated programs, particularly his memorable interpretation of the ghostly Flying Dutchman on the long-running \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" (Nickelodeon, 1999- ). Doyle-Murray regularly distinguished himself with a series of second banana roles that benefitted greatly from his professionalism and the terrific comic training he had honed on the Second City stage."
