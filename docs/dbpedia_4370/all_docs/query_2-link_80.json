        "text": "On September 9, 2015, Queen Elizabeth II became the longest-reigning monarch, surpassing Victoria’s rule of 63 years and 216 days. That day, the Cut first published this piece — which also ran in the September 7, 2015, issue of New York Magazine — looking back at the two royals, their 127 years, and their many, many pets.\n\nToday, just shy of seven years to the day, we’ve updated our side-by-side in honor of Elizabeth’s death. She ended up passing Victoria by a long shot — earlier this year, she became the first monarch to celebrate 70 years on the throne, making her the world’s longest-reigning monarch.\n\nQueen Victoria\n\nRule: 1837–1901\n\nb.

Victoria and Albert try a boat ride but quit within minutes.\n\n1861: Albert dies of typhoid fever. Victoria, in mourning, stays out of public view for several years, and wears black for the next 40.\n\n.\n\nYear 30\n\n1867: Grants Canada semi-independence (it can govern itself, but is still part of the empire), amid fears that America is about to invade.\n\n1868: William Gladstone’s first of four terms as prime minister. Victoria can’t stand him; calls him “arrogant, tyrannical and obstinate.”\n\n1870: Near the peak of its industrial power, England produces one-third of all global output.\n\n1877: Adds a new title, Empress of India. (Queen Elizabeth’s father, George VI, cedes the imperial title in 1948.)\n\n.\n\nYear 45\n\n1896: Surpasses George III to become the longest-reigning British monarch.

In 2018, the last of her bred corgis died, and though she said she didn’t want any of her dogs to outlive her, two have: Muick, one of the puppies gifted to her while Prince Philip was in the hospital, and Candy, a corgi-dachshund mix born after one of her corgis mated with Princess Margaret’s dog. She has also had cocker spaniels and Labradors.\n\n.\n\nYear 1\n\n1952: On a visit to Kenya, she learns that her father has died, and, at 25, she returns to London as Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n1953: Her coronation is televised, a royal first.
