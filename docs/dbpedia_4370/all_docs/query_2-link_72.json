        "text": "The longest-reigning living monarch, Elizabeth became queen in 1952 at the age of 25 following the death of her father, King George VI. Since then, she’s worked with more than 15 prime ministers in her over six decades on the throne, all while carrying out service, engagements, and overseas visits. She’s also shared her royal duties with her late husband of over 73 years, Prince Philip (who passed away on April 9, 2021), their four children, grandchildren, and—in the future—great-grandchildren.\n\nAhead, take a look at snapshots from the monarch’s life, from the defining regal milestones to rare, intimate moments with her family.\n\nJennifer Algoo is the Visuals Director at Harper's BAZAAR. She is a graduate of the School of Visual Arts and has previously worked at Patrick McMullan Co. as well as completing internships at Martha Stewart Weddings, Vogue and CosmoGirl! Magazine. Jennifer covers royal, celeb and art content as well as overseeing all visual assets on BAZAAR.com. When she's not obsessing over the royals you can find her attempting to solve cold cases as an armchair detective, traveling and experimenting with new recipes.\n\nNicole Saunders is the beauty editor at Best Products with over seven years of experience researching, writing, and editing lifestyle content. She specializes in breaking down complicated topics, like high-frequency wands and microcurrent devices, into easy-to-understand guides. She takes great pride in heavily researching and testing featured beauty products, — such as hairdryers and foundations — on our site, and spotlights her all-time seasonal favorites in her quarterly column Best New Beauty. And she tests quite literally thousands of launches for our Best New Beauty Awards package.\n\nBefore this, I was the first-ever Associate Commerce Editor at NBC News, where I helmed the skincare and wellness coverage. In this role, I regularly interviewed high-profile experts to help readers make savvy shopping decisions on everything from hairdryers and vitamin C serums to fitness equipment and air quality monitors. Outside of my wellness beat, I regularly wrote gift guides and sales articles pegged to major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day.\n\nYou can follow Nicole on Instagram and TikTok, add her on LinkedIn, or explore her portfolio."
