        "text": "Britain's shortest-serving prime minister Liz Truss has unveiled her resignation honours list, sparking an angry backlash from some critics.\n\nMs Truss, who spent 49 days in office, nominated Conservative donor Jon Moynihan and ex-Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott for seats in the Lords.\n\nRuth Porter, a former senior Truss aide, is also made a peer.\n\nOutgoing PMs routinely recommend people for honours - but Rishi Sunak had faced calls to block Ms Truss's list.\n\nHer 11 nominations - which largely consist of political supporters and former aides - have been announced at the same time as the New Year Honours list, but Downing Street sources denied this was an attempt to limit coverage of Ms Truss's list.\n\nMs Truss, who campaigned to remain in the EU but later became a standard-bearer for the Brexit-supporting Tory right, said: \"I am delighted these champions for the conservative causes of freedom, limited government and a proud and sovereign Britain have been suitably honoured.\"\n\nMs Truss was forced to stand down as prime minister in October 2022 after her mini-budget sparked economic turmoil.\n\nLabour and the Lib Dems had called on Rishi Sunak to block her resignation honours list.\n\nLabour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said: \"This list is proof positive of Rishi Sunak's weakness and a slap in the face to working people who are paying the price of the Tories crashing the economy.\n\n\"Honours should be for those committed to public service, not rewards for Tory failure.\"\n\nDeputy Lib Dem leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Truss handing out gongs after blowing a hole in the public finances and leaving families reeling from spiralling mortgage costs calls this whole honours system into disrepute.\"\n\nDowning Street insisted Ms Truss's list had gone through all the usual checks and was released at the same time as the New Year's Honours because it had only just been finalised.\n\nA Downing Street source said: \"Every past Labour prime minister has issued a Dissolution or Resignation List - this is a long-standing and ongoing convention - which even pre-dates the creation of the Labour Party.\n\n\"The convention is the incumbent prime minister does not block the political peerage proposals of others,\" which the source said included \"dubious\" past selections by Labour.\n\nLabour Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair did not issue a resignation honours list when he stepped down in 2007 after having a number of nominations for life peerages rejected amid \"cash for honours\" allegations, external.\n\nHis successor Gordon Brown did not issue a resignation honours list in 2010, but a cross-party dissolution honours list was issued on his advice, which created 29 Labour peers, 16 Tories, nine Lib Dems and one from the DUP.\n\nThe tradition of issuing resignation honours was revived by David, now Lord, Cameron, who handed out gongs to allies and supporters, including George Osborne, who was made a Companion of Honour.\n\nConservative PMs Theresa May and Boris Johnson also issued resignation honours lists.\n\nHannah White, the director of the Institute for Government think tank, said resignation honours brought the wider honours system into disrepute and should be done away with.\n\nThe handing out of peerages was a particular problem, she said, with a person being given a job for life legislating on behalf of the country \"on the say so of a single individual\"."
