        "text": "The Journal of Brian Doyle: A Greenhorn on an Alaskan Whaling Ship is the final book in Scholastic's series, My Name Is America. It was written by Jim Murphy and is his second book for the series. The book was published in April 2004. It was preceded by The Journal of Rufus Rowe by Sid Hite.\n\nDedication[]\n\n\"For my editors Tracy Mack and Beth S. Levine—whose intelligent comments and suggestions (and occasional prodding) helped me get Brian's voyage onto paper.\"\n\nBook description[]\n\n\"September 11, 1874\n\nThe pumping goes on—the Florence screams horribly under the crushing ice—and the storm continues.\n\nYork is leaving the ship and most of the forecastle agree. When another plant snapped, York decided to speak to the mates on behalf of the forecastle. Several accompanied York, including Frenchie and Watty. Mr. Le Page sent them back, saying decisions about the ship are up to the Captain, and that we must follow his orders, etc., etc. They are afraid for their positions, York suggested later, when they should be afraid for their lives. And ours.\n\nPlot[]\n\nEpilogue[]\n\nHistorical Note[]\n\nCharacters[]\n\nMain article: List of The Journal of Brian Doyle characters\n\nBrian Doyle\n\nAuthor[]\n\nMain article: Jim Murphy\n\nJames \"Jim\" Murphy was an America author whom wrote over thirty-five books.
