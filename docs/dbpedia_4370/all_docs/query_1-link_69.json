        "text": "SYRACUSE, N.Y. (NCC News) – A market and food hall in Downtown Syracuse welcomes all cultures.\n\nSalt City Market is uniting the Syracuse community through culturally diverse cuisine. The market has been fostering cultural exchange among local residents since 2020.\n\nThe Baghdad Restaurant located inside the market prides itself on being able to serve traditional dishes from its culture. The cashier at Baghdad, Abdulhadi Adil says food has the power to bring all people together.\n\n“It doesn’t matter what race you are, what color you are, what ethnicity you go by. It just connects people, and it just brings us all together,” said Adil.\n\nEllerae’s Taco, a newly opened restaurant in the market is bringing California-style tacos to Syracuse. The cashier at Ellerae’s is delighted to see the cultural camaraderie among customers.\n\n“It’s nice to see different groups of people blending together in a common space because everybody loves food so that’s nice,” said Laclaire.\n\nCustomers enjoy the variety of food options offered at the market.\n\nA regular customer who frequents there every Monday, Johnathan Cormier says all the food being in the same building made it easier to try new foods.\n\n“I think it gives people the opportunity to try different things without having to shop around. Everything is so close, its easy to be like well let me try the taco place today,” said Cormier.\n\nSalt City Market serves food with a side of cultural inclusivity."
