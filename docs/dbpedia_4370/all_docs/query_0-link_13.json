        "text": "Brian Doyle-Murray (born Brian Murray) is an American comedian, screenwriter, actor, and voice artist. He is the older brother of actor/comedian Bill Murray, and the two have acted together in several films, including Caddyshack, Scrooged, Ghostbusters II, The Razor's Edge, and Groundhog Day, and were cast members on the fifth season (1979-1980) of Saturday Night Live. Murray was also a writer for SNL during its critically panned sixth season (1980-1981) and was a feature player and Weekend Update anchor for the show's seventh season (1981-1982), making Murray one of a handful of cast members who have worked under all three executive producers (Lorne Michaels, Jean Doumanian, and Dick Ebersol). He currently appears in a recurring role as Don Ehlert on the ABC sitcom The Middle. His voice acting roles include Captain K'nuckles in The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack and the Flying Dutchman in SpongeBob SquarePants. He provides the voice of Prince Huge in the Adventure Time episode \"The Hard Easy.\""
