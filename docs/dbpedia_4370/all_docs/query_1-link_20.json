        "text": "I was on a gleaming elevator in a vast hotel in a huge city\n\nThe other day when a man got on with his daughter about\n\nAge four. I asked her what floor they wanted and she said\n\nSeven million. I reached up as high as I could and pressed\n\nAn imaginary button and she laughed and some little door\n\nOpened in all three of us, a wordless yes, and we started to\n\nTalk about the elevator’s voice, which sounded like a lady\n\nFrom Ireland or Scotland, and how the buttons were twice\n\nAs big as any giant’s fingers, and how older gents like me\n\nRemembered buildings without thirteenth floors, isn’t that\n\nFunny, that an ancient supersition would still be reflected\n\nIn modern buildings? By now the girl was dancing and her\n\nDad and I were grinning at her ebullience but then the lady\n\nSpoke their floor and the door opened. The girl leapt away,\n\nBut the dad hesitated a second and said quietly hey thanks,\n\nAnd I knew just what he meant – something like thanks for\n\nBeing four years old for a minute. We have those moments\n\nWhen we are all the same age, from the same country, with\n\nThe same language on our teeth, and it never lasts too long,\n\nBut it always feels weirdly familiar, doesn’t it? Like we are\n\nHome again for a moment, with family we hardly get to see.\n\nYes\n\nHere’s a first for Heart Poems: a prose poem which like all good poems conveys meaning in few words with its own music. It’s a simple enough story, one you may have experienced yourself or something similar. You’ve heard of ‘elevator speeches’, those concise ways of telling someone what it is you do for your living. This, though, I find so much more interesting and the title draws me in with its affirmative energy.\n\nFocused on a brief moment in time, the poet shares with us the magic of a child who spontaneously responds seven million when asked what floor she wants, that simple, polite elevator question. And with her laughter, some little door / opened in all three of us, a connection that would likely have been missed without her. With this wordless yes, a free ranging conversation begins about the elevator’s voice, the buttons twice as big as any giant’s fingers, and the superstition of not naming the thirteenth floor.\n\nThe poet and the father share smiles at the little girl’s ebullience as she leaps off at their floor. When the father quietly says thanks, the poet understood, something like thanks for / being four years old for a minute. Those moments when age and country and language are irrelevant, just shared, momentary joy. And yet, there is a familiarity, like we are / home again for a moment, home with people we are connected to as if they were family. May you encounter such a yes somewhere in your days to bring you home."
