        "text": "To provide the United Kingdom with the monarch she felt it needed,\n\nQueen Elizabeth II sacrificed an ordinary life and the other things most of us take for granted.\n\nBY OTTO ENGLISH\n\nILLUSTRATIONS BY DAKOTA RANDALL FOR POLITICO\n\nOtto English is the pen name used by Andrew Scott, a writer and playwright based in London.\n\nLONDON — Like Oscar Zoroaster, the eponymous Wizard of the fictional land of Oz, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, who has died aged 96, led a curious double life.\n\nOn the one hand, she played the part of Queen Elizabeth II — a revered figure who donned crowns, opened parliaments and asked people who they were and what they did at garden parties. It was she who stared out Mona Lisa-like from banknotes and who became head of state to 150 million people, from Papua New Guinea to Canada, and one of the most famous people of her time.\n\nThe queen was an icon, in the literal sense. She inspired Andy Warhol screen prints, tea towels, Beatles hits and the risible efforts of poet laureates from John Masefield to Simon Armitage.\n\n“God save the queen!” the Sex Pistols sang in 1977. “She ain’t no human being!” And they made a compelling point.\n\nLauded globally — she stood alongside the Dalai Lama and the pope as one of those rare definite articles who seemed to be above scrutiny. So much so that even die-hard republicans would temper their calls for an end to the monarchy by saying: “But the queen has done a fantastic job.”\n\nShe succeeded at that job, in no small part, by making a virtue out of silence. She stubbornly refused to be interviewed, examined or subjected to scrutiny. While younger royals broke the fourth wall of monarchy, the queen remained quiet and immutable.\n\nIndeed, it was by keeping her official alter ego as vague as the unwritten British constitution, and her private persona hidden away altogether, that Elizabeth II became the most successful sovereign since Victoria, bringing relevance to a feudal institution that was 200 years past its sell-by date.\n\nBut because of that, in writing the story of her life, it is almost impossible to find out who she really was beneath the hats and robes and jewels.\n\nThe queen was an abstraction: a role, like any other — and it was the person behind her, Elizabeth Windsor, who expertly played the part.\n\nThe world’s papers will be full of obituaries of the queen today.\n\nThis is the life of Elizabeth Windsor.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nOnce again, official biographies portray this era as a period of “normality.” It’s not entirely true. They lived in a six-bedroom mansion, and in addition to Bobo, had an army of staff.\n\nAny attempt at ordinary life was anyway short-lived. In 1952, Elizabeth’s father, King George VI died, and the 25-year-old woman became queen.\n\nThough her life had been one long rehearsal for the role, it came sooner than expected and seems to have caused considerable marital strife. The dynamics changed immediately, with Philip turned, in his own words, into “a bloody amoeba” while his wife surrendered herself wholly to her new duties.\n\nElizabeth’s daughter-in-law, Princess Diana, once said that there were “three people” in her marriage to Prince Charles. Following the coronation in 1953, there were 150 million in Elizabeth and Philips’.\n\nThe duke of Edinburgh seems to have had an existential crisis and spent ever-longer periods away from home. There were rumors of affairs that went on well into the 1980s.\n\nMeanwhile Elizabeth found friendship with her old childhood friend Henry Herbert, 7th earl of Carnarvon, aka Porchie. The two shared a love of racehorses and the great outdoors and while there’s no suggestion they ever had an affair, their very close friendship sent the rumor mill into overdrive. From 1969 onward, he was her race manager, and the two spent extended periods in each other’s company.\n\nThe care of the four children (Andrew was born 1960 and Edward in 1964) was entrusted to nannies and boarding schools.\n\n* * *\n\nElizabeth, now heading into her late 60s, was unprepared for that — let alone what followed. Bewildered by Charles’ behavior and Anne’s apparent unwillingness to conform to the destiny that birth had gifted her, she made her displeasure apparent — and stripped both Diana and Sarah Ferguson (her third child Andrew’s wife) of their titles. Diana also lost her office, her police protection and her good name — as the tabloids dragged her reputation through the mud, with encouragement from the Buckingham Palace press office.\n\nIn 1997, Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris, and the royal family spiraled toward irrelevance. As preparations were made for the 2002 Golden Jubilee, there were fears that nobody would come — with Blairite encouragement, the event was turned instead into a “people’s party,” complete with Brian May playing the national anthem on Buckingham Palace’s roof.\n\nIt was only when the queen — having been the nation’s sweetheart and the nation’s mother — was reinvented as the nation’s grandmother that affection for her began to return.\n\nAs she advanced into her 80s, the outward image of an unsmiling monarch seemed to loosen up a bit. There was a stunt with James Bond actor Daniel Craig at the opening of the 2012 Olympics, when she appeared to jump out of a helicopter, and she made a funny viral video with her grandson Harry in the run-up to the Invictus Games in 2016.\n\nHer Christmas Day messages became softer in tone and there were hints of a rebel Remainer queen — when she wore a hat that looked a bit like an EU flag at the state opening of parliament in 2017.\n\nBut even as a younger generation of royals seemed ready to breathe new life into The Firm, the tensions within the family continued. She made little secret of her displeasure following her grandson Harry’s marriage to Meghan Markle, the couple’s subsequent defection to the United States and their damaging interview with Oprah Winfrey in which accusations of racism and bullying were made against members of the royal family.\n\nThe same callous treatment was not meted out to all. The queen’s weakness was Andrew — her middle and most-loved child who, despite his profligate ways, unsavory friendship with the pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and unpopularity with the public, remained protected until the bitter end.\n\n* * *\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated Elizabeth‘s age when she became queen. She was 25."
