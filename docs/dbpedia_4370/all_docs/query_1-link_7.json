And they’ve probably all been dissected to bits time and again at every food court in every shopping mall in the world: cars, money, school, jobs, sex, travel, reading, race, religion, food, movies, cars (again), dementia, death.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThey are so everyday, in fact, that when he sat down to make a list of topics to write about, he did so by going through the Yellow Pages.\n\n“I tried to pick some very pedestrian things,” he says. “Quotidian things that would apply to just about everybody who was born between 1929 and 1939, and for whom these are still basic things. There’s nothing special about the topics. They’re pretty universal. Ordinary things that people must do.\n\n“With a lot of writing,” he adds, “you’re used to looking for broader themes with significance. I didn’t want any of that. Just ordinary objects and endeavours. There’s a lot there in the yellow pages, if you just squint your eyes.”\n\nThe idea for the series came a little over a year ago, after Doyle’s grandson Matt, then 19, tossed out a casual “kids these days” remark in conversation. It occurred to Doyle then that as the rate of change in society quickens, the gaps between generations — and even within them — get wider and wider.\n\n“I think I was in my mid-40s before I ever said, ‘Kids today,’ with that tone,” he says.\n\n“Being concerned about our obligations as elders to preserve whatever we can of the past, so that memory isn’t completely lost, I thought, ‘Well, while I’ve still got some memory left I might as well write down what it was like.’” he says. “‘What it was like for a young person to find work, or entertain himself, or deal with school or authorities, or his relationship to sex or movies or cars.’”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe timing could hardly have been better. He’d been working for two years on a memoir which, he eventually had to admit, wasn’t working. Even Doyle’s literary editor, whose opinion he’s trusted for more than 30 years, advised him to abandon the project.\n\n“I found trying to tell the truth difficult,” Doyle recalls. “A memoir is like looking in the mirror too long — you start wearing the face you wish you had.”\n\nInstead, he cannibalized the best parts of the memoir to use in the essays.\n\nThe idea for the format — 1,000-word essays — he got from a neighbour, Phil Jenkins, a regular Citizen freelance columnist.\n\n“I counted up the words in one of his columns and it was about 1,000,” Doyle recalls. “So I thought, ‘Let’s see if I can do that in that same word limit.’ “I thought, ‘If Phil can do it, then I can do it.’”\n\nPerhaps his biggest challenge was to avoid falling into the sloppy and clichéd trap of rambling on about the “good old days.” Everyone from the beginning of time, he insists, has talked about the good old days.\n\n“Of course you long for your youth. What’s new about that?”\n\nInstead, he wanted to preserve the past without passing judgment on it.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I feel bad that my grandson at age 13 can’t find work other than some McJob,” he says. “There were so many opportunities for us. I wish they had that, too. And that’s not the good old days; it’s just different periods of history. So I tried to keep as clear-headed as I could, but it’s not easy; as soon as you start looking at your past, the old glasses get pretty rose-coloured and you get kind of weepy about it. Anybody can do that.\n\n“But I come from a family of storytellers,” he adds, “not weepers and whiners about the good old days — actual narrations that are there because they are funny and significant. My grandfather and father and uncles and all that gang — those people never once, I don’t think, specifically in that tone talked about the good old days. They were constantly talking about universal human dilemma in their memory. It just happened to be in the past — it had to be, it couldn’t be anywhere else.\n\n“I’m a one-trick pony. I’ve only got one thing to say, and it’s all very autobiographical. But when I get a feeling that there’s universality to it, then I keep it.\n\n“I think everybody does that. But not everybody writes it down.”\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
