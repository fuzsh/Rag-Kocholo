        "text": "Transcript\n\nDid You Know?\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nElizabeth II was the queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from February 6, 1952 until her death on September 8, 2022.\n\nHer full title was the lengthy Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.\n\nBorn the eldest daughter of Prince Albert, duke of York, Elizabeth wasn’t expected to become queen.\n\nIt was only when Albert’s elder brother, King Edward VIII, abdicated the throne to marry American divorcée Wallis Simpson that Elizabeth’s father became King George VI and Elizabeth became the heir presumptive.\n\nAfter George VI’s death in 1952, Elizabeth was declared queen. Her official coronation took place June 2, 1953, after a period of mourning for her father had passed.\n\nIn some ways, Queen Elizabeth II attempted to modernize the British monarchy: she allowed the royal family’s life to be televised, condoned the divorce of her younger sister, Margaret, and preferred court life to be kept as simple as possible.\n\nOn September 9, 2015, Elizabeth II became the longest-reigning monarch in British history, surpassing Queen Victoria’s record of 63 years and 216 days."
