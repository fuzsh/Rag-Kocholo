        "text": "Jean Elizabeth Leckie (14 march 1874 - 27 june 1940) was the second wife of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. They married on 18 september 1907, but Conan Doyle was in love with her since 1897, a platonic love until the death of his first wife in 1906. They installed in Crowborough (Sussex), where she gave him 3 children (Denis in 1909, Adrian in 1910, Lena Jean in 1912).\n\nIn 1897, when Conan Doyle met her, she was a tall, thin and delicate woman, but also athletic and passionnate.\n\nIn his Memories and Adventures (1923), Arthur Conan Doyle wrote:\n\n« On September 18, 1907, I married Miss Jean Leckie, the younger daughter of a Blackheath family whom I had known for years, and who was a dear friend of my mother and sister. There are some things which one feels too intimately to be able to express, and I can only say that the years have passed without one shadow coming to mar even for a moment the sunshine of my Indian summer which now deepens to a golden autumn. She and my three younger children with the kindly sympathy of my two elder ones have made my home an ideally happy one. My wife's people had a house at Crowborough, and there they had gone to reside. As they were very attached I thought it would be a happy arrangement not to separate them, so I bought a house close by, named \"Windlesham.\" »\n\nPhotos of Jean Leckie then Jean Conan Doyle\n\nJean Leckie (1906)\n\nJean Leckie (july 1907)\n\nJean Leckie (16 july 1907)\n\nJean Leckie (16 july 1907)\n\nMarriage (18 september 1907)\n\nLady Conan Doyle (ca. 1907)\n\nJean Conan Doyle (ca. 1907)\n\nJean Leckie now Lady Conan Doyle (1907)\n\nLady Conan Doyle (ca. 1910)\n\nJean Conan Doyle (1910)\n\nJean Conan Doyle and her two sons (ca. 1915)\n\nJean and Arthur Conan Doyle on a spirit photograph (1920)\n\nJean and Arthur Conan Doyle (ca. 1920)\n\nJean and Arthur Conan Doyle with Jean Meyer (ca. 1920)\n\nJean and Arthur Conan Doyle visiting H.
