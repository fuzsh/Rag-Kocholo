        "text": "I have been a regular vendor at the World Equestrian Center in Ocala for over a year. What a beautiful and fun place to work! The management and vendor coordinator have been so pleasant and easy to work with, I’m eager to come back for the next show!\n\nThroughout the winter circuit, the WEC vendor team checked in with me weekly to ensure I had everything I needed to be successful as a vendor and brainstorm on solutions to any challenges I experienced.\n\nTenney’s is proud to be a vendor at World Equestrian Center. Our missions are aligned in providing an exceptional experience for the exhibitors and general public as well. The staff is great to work with and the fees are very fair. I’m looking forward to an amazing summer at WEC!\n\nThis facility is truly world class. As a vendor that travels to some of the nicest horse facilities in the USA, this place is unequaled. WEC offers the finest in all aspects of horse showing, with wonderful amenities for the horse, rider and vendor. The Harris family is so grateful for the opportunity to attend shows here at WEC. The staff is amazing and they are always ready and willing to do whatever it takes to make our setup smooth and uneventful.\n\nThe WEC Organization has come together to provide a state of the art facility for the equestrian community, and we at FarmVet are proud to be able to service our customers at this beautiful venue. The professionalism of their leadership team has made doing business here a win-win for us, and for our customers."
