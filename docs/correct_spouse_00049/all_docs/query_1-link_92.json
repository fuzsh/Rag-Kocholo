Click here to read the latest version from 2021.\n\nBlack Deaf Culture Through the Lens of Black Deaf History\n\nBy Benro Ogunyipe, Former NBDA President 2011-2013\n\nA Brief Commentary on the History, Culture, and Education of Black Deaf People\n\nThe Black Deaf Community: Recent Accomplishments and Recognition\n\nRising Stars: Black and Deaf Inspirations\n\nNew Generation of Black Deaf People in Leadership\n\nBlack Deaf People in Arts & Entertainment\n\nBlack Deaf Books\n\nNational Black Deaf Advocates\n\nBlack Deaf people have one of the most unique cultures in the world. The Black Deaf Community is largely shaped by two cultures and communities: Deaf and African-American. Some Black Deaf individuals view themselves as members of both communities. Since both communities are viewed by the larger, predominately hearing and White society as comprising a minority community, Black Deaf persons often experience double prejudice against them in terms of racial discrimination and communication barriers. Black Deaf women may experience three strikes of prejudice against them due to their race, Deafness, and sexist practices that prevail in our male dominated culture.\n\nThese discriminatory practices can be traced back to the segregation era during the 17th to mid 20th centuries. Black Deaf individuals were not accepted in either the Deaf or the African-American community. Black organizations like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and the National Urban League were focused exclusively on fighting for equality and equal rights for the African-American community. The concerns of the Black Deaf community were not the focus of national civil rights organizations such as NAACP, SCLC, and the National Urban League. The Black Deaf community had no communication access with these national civil rights organizations and their leaders.\n\nThe ideal fight for equal access would point to joining with Deaf organizations. Unfortunately, Black Deaf people were prohibited from joining Deaf organizations and clubs. The premier national advocacy organization for the rights of deaf people, the National Association of the Deaf (NAD), prohibited Black membership for 40 years until 1965, a year after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. From its founding in 1864 until 1950, Gallaudet College (now Gallaudet University), did not admit and graduate Black Deaf students. The college had its first Black graduate, Andrew J. Foster, in 1954 – the same year of the landmark Supreme Court case Brown vs. Board of Education decision.\n\nFrom the 1870s until the 1970s, at least 15 states, mostly in the south, maintained separate schools for Black and White deaf students. Integration of Black and White students did not occur until after the Brown vs. Board of Education decision. In 2011, former Black Deaf students of the Kentucky School for the Deaf received long overdue diplomas once denied to them 60 years earlier because of the color of their skin. Because Black deaf students were prohibited from opportunities to interact with students and teachers on the White Deaf school campuses, this separation contributed to the development of Black ASL, a dialect of American Sign Language that's distinctively different from those of white deaf students' signs.\n\nAccording to Solomon (2010), \"The Deaf club is essentially a Deaf person's second home, providing a place where the Deaf can come together, exchange ideas, develop friendships, participate in social events, and have the opportunity to attain a leadership position within the Deaf community. After World War II Black Deaf [people] found themselves in need of a place to meet so they began to form their own clubs, congregations, and organizations.\" Because of the denied acceptance and membership in Deaf organizations and clubs that were exclusively for white Deaf persons, Black Deaf organizations arose during the 1950s and 1960s in the urban cities with large numbers of Black Deaf residents such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC. At the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) Convention held in Cincinnati, OH in 1980, a group of Black Deaf leaders presented a list of concerns to the convention delegates. These included issues such as the NAD's lack of attentiveness to the concerns of Black Deaf Americans as well as the lack of representation of Black Deaf individuals as convention delegates. They specifically requested NAD to take action to communicate better with the Black Deaf community, encourage the involvement of minorities within the national and state organizations, and recruit more Black Deaf children in the Junior NAD and NAD Youth Leadership Camp, all of which hindered Black Deaf people's goal of achieving their full potential.\n\nThe course of history for the Black Deaf community began to take on a new direction in 1981 when a local committee in Washington, DC organized the Eastern Regional Black Deaf Conference at Howard University, and in 1982 at a national conference entitled \"Black Deaf Strength through Awareness\" held in Cleveland, Ohio. An important outcome of the conference was the establishment of a new organization, National Black Deaf Advocates (NBDA). The establishment of NBDA has spurred the growth of local chapters in Washington, DC, Cleveland, Philadelphia, New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Memphis, Atlanta, and many other cities. Currently, the NBDA has over 30 local chapters and sponsors a variety of programs such as leadership training programs for high school and college students, a Miss Black Deaf America Pageant, leadership opportunities at the local and national levels, workshops at regional and national conferences, and a scholarship program for deserving Black Deaf college students.\n\nBibliography:\n\nMcCaskill, Carolyn.

Below are some of the highlights:\n\nUnfolding the Soul of Black Deaf Expressions\n\nThe National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), a college of Rochester Institute of Technology, hosted the first ever exhibit celebrating and honoring more than 100 artworks by Black Deaf Artists from around the world. The exhibit, which was open to the public at the Dyers Arts Center, ran from November 15, 2015 to February 27, 2016. This exhibit promoted the outstanding work of more than 30 Black Deaf Artists showcasing their artworks, including photography, video arts, paintings, sculptures, drawings, and more. The Dyer Arts Center hosted a two-day symposium on February 26 and 27, 2016. For more information, visit https://www.rit.edu/ntid/dyerarts.\n\nNBDA 30 Years of Advocacy\n\nIn 2012, NBDA turned 30 years old. NBDA hosted a 30th Anniversary Celebration in Baltimore, MD. The theme was, \"Celebrating a Legacy: NBDA's 30 Years of Advocacy.\" Members and supporters from all over the country attended the event commemorating the achievement of this esteemed organization. Highlights included a keynote presentation by William Merritt, President/CEO of the Black United Fund, a sharing of memories from NBDA founders and leaders, and the presenting of the NBDA Lifetime Achievement Award to Dr. Glenn B. Anderson.\n\nDr. Glenn B. Anderson Scholarship\n\nThe NBDA general scholarship was renamed after the first Black Deaf person to earn a doctoral degree, now known as the Dr. Glenn B. Anderson Scholarship. This honor bestowed to Dr. Anderson in recognition for his years of extraordinary leadership, advocacy, commitment to educational excellence, and unfailing dedication to the Black Community, the Deaf Community, and National Black Deaf Advocates.\n\nWhite House Appointment of Claudia Gordon, Esq.\n\nNational Black Deaf Advocates was thrilled when the White House in 2013 announced the appointment of Claudia Gordon, Esq. as the Associate Director for the Disability Community in the Office of Public Engagement. Gordon is the first Black Deaf woman in America to become an attorney. Claudia previously served as the Vice-President of the National Black Deaf Advocates from 2002-2005 and was a Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Federal Contracts and Compliance Programs at United States Department of Labor (DOL) and later became a senior policy advisor for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. Among her accomplishments and honors: first deaf student to graduate from the American University (AU) Washington College of Law, in Washington, DC; recipient of the Paul G. Hearne Leadership Award from the American Association of People with Disabilities; and Skadden Fellow, a fellowship for law graduates for her work at the National Association of the Deaf Law and Advocacy Center. In 2013, NBDA honored Claudia with the Linwood Smith Humanitarian Award.\n\nNAD Apologies for Denial of Equal Rights to Deaf Women and Black Deaf Individuals\n\nIn 2012, the National Association of the Deaf recognized and formally apologized for its past denial of equal rights to Deaf Women and Black Deaf individuals on the basis of gender and race. Prior to 1965, NAD did not give female members the right to vote. Also prior to 1965, NAD did not permit Black Deaf individuals to join as members and having voting rights. At the 2013 NBDA Conference in New Orleans, LA, NAD CEO Howard Rosenblum and NAD President Chris Wagner presented the NAD's apology, in the form of a resolution, to NBDA. Benro Ogunyipe, who was President at the time, accepted the resolution on behalf of NBDA. NBDA is grateful for the long overdue apology and continues to work with the NAD and other national organizations to ensure the inclusion of Deaf people from diverse backgrounds in the programs, services, and privileges intended to benefit all Deaf people.\n\nNBDA Globalization\n\nNBDA has become globally known and has attracted international interest and shared its resources with Deaf people from countries such as Germany, Brazil, England and Jamaica; and the continent of Africa. NBDA was directly responsible for the formation of London Ethnic Minority Deaf Association (LEMDA) after a group of Deaf Blacks and Asians attended the NBDA Conference in Los Angeles in 1996. LEMDA folded a few years ago. However, the Black Deaf community in England continues to mobilize for equal rights. In 1993 and 1999, the NBDA Conferences were held in the US Virgin Islands and Jamaica respectively. Former NBDA President Benro Ogunyipe (2011-2013) was invited by Deaf Afro Brazilian leaders to give presentations at their annual convention entitled \"IV Congresso Nacional de Inclusao Social do Negro Surdo\" (IV National Congress of Black Deaf Social Inclusion) held on November 15-16, 2013 in Salvador, Bahia - Brazil. Deaf Afro Brazilians look to NBDA as an exemplary organization for leadership, opportunities, and services for people of color.\n\nFormer Kentucky Black Deaf Students Received Diplomas 60 Years Later\n\nSharon White, NBDA Secretary (2009-2013), and also president of the Kentucky Association of the Deaf, advocated on behalf of former Black deaf students who attended Kentucky School for the Deaf between 1930 to 1955 to receive their long overdue high school diplomas once denied to them because of the color of their skin. As a result of her advocacy efforts, Sharon was the recipient of the Leadership Award at the Kentucky Governor Ambassador Award Ceremony.\n\nGlenn B. Anderson & Andrew J. Foster Chosen as Gallaudet Visionary Leaders\n\nDr. Glenn B. Anderson and Dr. Andrew J. Foster were among 15 individuals chosen as Visionary Leaders for the Gallaudet University's sesquicentennial anniversary Celebrating 150 Years of Visionary Leadership. The university honors a Visionary Leader each month from September 2013 to November 2014, the months of February 2014 and May 2014 honoring Dr. Anderson and Dr. Foster respectively. The 15 Visionary Leaders chosen were nominated by the campus community and alumni from around the world and are Gallaudet alumni who have demonstrated a significant impact on society in a major field of study or research, culture or the arts, deaf education, or advocacy.\n\nBlack Deaf with Doctorate Degrees\n\nDr. David James and Dr. Glenn B. Anderson are the first Black Deaf persons to earn a doctorate in 1977 and 1982, respectively. Dr. Shirley Allen became the first Black Deaf woman to earn a doctorate in 1992. Today, there are now approximately 13 known Black Deaf scholars. Most notably the new addition to the ranks is Dr. Joseph Hill who completed his doctorate in Linguistics. He is the first and only Black Deaf linguist and a professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Prospects for the future look promising with several Black Deaf candidates currently pursuing their doctoral degrees.\n\nDiversity on NAD Board of Directors\n\nFor the first time in National Association of the Deaf history, there is more than one person of color on the Board. They include the following Board members: Melissa S. Draganac-Hawk (Vice President), Kirsten Poston (Secretary, 2012-2014), Richard McCowin (Region II Representative), and Pamela Lloyd-Ogoke (Appointed Member). It is important to note the result of more diversity on the NAD Board in recent years was directly mandated from one of the goals of the Vision 20/20 Strategic Plan which was to implement diversity in all levels of NAD, including people of color on the board level.

While growing up in a rural village tending sheep and goats when not in school, he became stricken with Spinal Meningitis at ten years old, and was brought home to die. However, he survived the disease and began his journey as a Deaf person. He was fortunate to have supportive parents who did what it took to ensure that deafness would not interfere with his education and success. His educational journey into deafhood started with a 13-hour ride on a bicycle with his father to the school for the Deaf that was far away from his hometown. After beginning his education at the school for the Deaf, his father's life was tragically taken away a month later in the 1993 Burundi Genocide.\n\nAfter the tragedy, Isidore started studying with other Deaf children. He persevered and attended mainstreamed high school without any interpreter or any form of accommodation. He eventually graduated with honors and moved to the U.S.A. to continue his education at Ohlone College where he earned his Associate degree in Social Sciences in 2008 before transferring to San Diego State University.\n\nWhile at San Diego State University, Isidore founded the ASL Club after the university cut the once popular undergraduate track in ASL and Deaf Education. The goal was to ensure that ASL and Deaf culture continued to have a presence at the university. It was for this initiative that he became the first Deaf homecoming king in the history of SDSU in 2010. Currently, Isidore holds a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology from SDSU and a Master's Degree in Peace and Justice Studies from the University of San Diego with concentration in International Development and Human Rights Advocacy.\n\nIsidore is a proud member of NBDA and former Peer Advisor of 2011 Youth Empowerment Summit (Y.E.S!).
