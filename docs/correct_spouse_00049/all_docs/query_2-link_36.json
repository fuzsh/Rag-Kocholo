        "text": "BEATON\n\nIt is with great sadness we announce the passing of John William Beaton, July 11th, 2024, surrounded by his loving family at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital. Born in 1956, in Niagara Falls, and raised in Port Hood, John William was the oldest of eight children of the late Donald Angus Beaton and Mary Florence (MacIsaac) Beaton. John Willie (JW) was well known throughout the island and touched a much wider circle throughout the horse community. JW’s lifetime career was working in the construction industry as a masonry labourer and primarily worked for Brimac Masonry, but outside of work his real passion that never waned was for harness racing. Since he was a youngster, JW started attending the races in Inverness with his father. He would then begin going to the racetrack in Port Hood where he would help groom and jog horses and would spend many of his summers at Donmar Farms in Balls Creek under the guidance of Donald Rankin Senior. After graduating high school, JW travelled abroad to Pompano Park in Florida to work with the racehorses and would later receive his driver's license while working in Saint John, NB. After working away for some time, JW returned home to Port Hood and started driving in Inverness. Since then, JW raced at all the tracks around the Maritimes, especially at Tartan Downs, Northside Downs, and Inverness Raceway, and has owned and trained standardbreds with his wife Kim for many years. JW continued to catch drives for various other owners, totalling 993 lifetime wins, until his health issues began the last few years. JW has been inducted into the CB Horseman's Hall of Fame and has enjoyed his racing passion as it truly was a lifelong experience right up to his passing. JW is survived by his wife, Kim (Robertson) of 37 years; son, Johnathan (Colleen) Beaton; two granddaughters, Isabel and Abigail Beaton; two brothers, Donald Francis, Port Hood, Anthony (Lisa) Beaton, Waterdown, Ontario; and five sisters, Caddy (late Harold) Pond, Louise (Greg) MacInnis, Anita (late Danny) Gillis, Judique, Marcella (Brian) Ingraham, Port Hood, and Colina (Paul) Galan, Brampton, Ontario, as well as his many nieces and nephews. JW will be remembered for his story telling, humour, fullness of life, and love for the dance floor. JW will be immensely missed by all his family and friends. The family would like to thank the many staff of the Cape Breton Regional Hospital and VON for their dedicated kindness and care. Funeral arrangements have been entrusted to T.J. Tracey Cremation and Burial Specialists, 6 Churchill Drive, Sydney, 902-539-7175.

Born in Inverness, NS, on December 10th, 1937, she was a daughter to the late Joseph and Elizabeth (Larade) Harper. She was a devoted wife and loving mother. Her family was her life and she will always be in our hearts. Family cruises, playing auction 120, 45s, and cribbage was her favourite pastime.

She had a unique gift of making one feel loved, special, understood, heard, and for maintaining these lifelong friendships. Winnie was the first of four children born to Marie (Fogarty) and Frank MacInnis in Inverness, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. She is survived by her siblings, John (Theresa) Judique, Louise (Dudy, deceased) Inverness, Leo, Kingston, stepchildren, Daniel Suboski, Viki, William and Lisa (deceased), and her much loved MacInnis, Poirier, and Suboski nieces, nephews, grandnephews, grandnieces, and many cousins. Winnie had a long and varied nursing career. After completing studies for bachelor of nursing in Antigonish, she began working in Inverness and then moved on to Montreal and Sioux Lookout. She later obtained a BA in Psychology at Queens University, which led to working at the Kingston Penitentiary as a psychiatric nurse until she retired. It was in Kingston that she met the love of her life, Milt Suboski, professor at Queen's University with whom she had adventures, companionship, and later lovingly cared for him at home during a long illness before his death in 2008. Spirituality was an integral part of her life with connections to Christianity, Buddhism, Life Energy Fundamentals, and she was a Jin Shin practitioner. Winnie remained an avid reader, and a lifelong learner with interests that included yoga, her book club, and most recently helping with a pollinator garden, Irish dancing and playing the ukulele. Lover of fiddle music and square dancing, she enjoyed many a night at the Cape Breton square dances. She also enjoyed swimming at the beach in Inverness and visiting with her family and many friends on her vacations back to her hometown. The family would like to thank her friends, and the staff, nurses and doctors at Kingston General Hospital and Providence Care for their professional and caring support. Towards the end of her life, she suggested to a friend that she did not have enough time for dancing, laughing and visiting her hometown. To remember her, take a moment to do something you love, whatever it may be, and may Winnie now laugh and dance with the angels. As per Winnie’s wishes there will be no formal service.\n\nTIMMONS\n\nRalph Edward Timmons, August 24th, 1954 – July 8th, 2024: Ralph Edward Timmons, beloved husband, father, brother, and friend passed away suddenly. Born in Inverness on August 24th, 1954, he was the son of the late Eddie and the late Mary Catherine (Finn) Timmons. Ralph was known for his unwavering selflessness and passion for camping, hunting, fishing, and his love of music. Ralph touched the lives of all who knew him and left everyone smiling. Ralph passed away doing what he loved to do most: camping with his wife of 46 years, the person he loved most, Denise. Ralph grew up in Inverness before going on to follow his university studies at St. F.X. in Antigonish. After two years of studying and partying, he moved to Toronto where he began working as a lab technician for Lever. This is where he met the love of his life, Denise (of Grand Étang) in 1976. They were married two years later and decided to move back home to Cape Breton to start a family. There was no better place for Ralph to live than Cape Breton Island; the ocean, the wilderness, and the music called to him and it showed in how he spent each and every day. Upon arriving in Cape Breton, he started as a helper on a few fishing boats throughout the ’80s before purchasing his own fishing boat: the “Flying Swan” in the early ’90s. That was eventually replaced with the “Peter Pan,” the “Cory and Kiel,” and finally was able to have his dream boat built, “L’Écossois,” where he and Denise could fish in luxury and comfort until they decided to sell the gear and retire. Throughout his entire fishing career, he graciously shared the fruits of his labours with any visiting family members who thoroughly enjoyed his perfectly cooked crustacean cuisine. As much as Ralph loved being on the ocean, he was equally in his glory in the Cape Breton wilderness; camping, trout fishing, hunting, skiing, snowshoeing, blueberry picking, and anything else involving nature. When he wasn’t enjoying the outdoors, nothing made Ralph happier than playing the guitar and singing songs. Even though he kept himself busy, there was always time for others. He volunteered with plenty of organizations around town including being on the board of AMAC, he was a member of the Cheticamp Search and Rescue for over 30 years, helping new hunters with firearm safety and map and compass classes, and of course he was always willing to sing a tune or seven for any event around town. This cheerful outdoorsman will be remembered forever by his loving wife Denise, his incredible sons Cory and Kiel (Mandy), and his adored dog, Ila. Survived by his loving siblings, Ralph is remembered by his brother Donnie Timmons (Theresa), and sisters Edna MacNeil (Jimmy), Kathleen Timmons, and Jean MacDonald (Finley), and all of his loving nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends. Besides his parents, Ralph was predeceased by his sisters Mary Jesse Gallant (Doug) and Catherine (in infancy). Cremation has taken place and everyone was welcome to join the family at La salle des Retraités – Senior’s Hall in Cheticamp on Saturday, July 13th, from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. for a celebration of life and sing-along. A private graveside service will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations can be made to the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada (https://www.heartandstroke.ca/) or a charity that would be dear to Ralph’s heart.\n\nMAILLET\n\nOn December 10th, 2023, our loving mother, Ann Gloria Maillet (Gillis), 78, was received into the loving arms of our Saviour. Ann was born on April 1st, 1945, in Southwest Margaree in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia to Peter and Catherine (MacKinnon) Gillis. Ann left her beloved island at the age of 18 and immigrated to the United States, landing in Waltham, MA. Ann quickly found her calling as a nurse’s aide, immeasurably touching the lives of her many patients with her endless kindness and generosity. Ann also had great wit and a wicked sense of humour, as evidenced by the stories she would share about growing up in a small rural community in Canada, attending a one-room schoolhouse as a child. It is there that she so often found herself sent to the corner after instigating mischief. To know Ann, was to love her and we hope that her spirit of kindness, love, and joy of life will inspire those she knew to find the beauty in the benign and to never be too shy to tell someone you love them. Ann is survived by her children, Karen Saisa, Shawn Maillet (Gina), Cheryl MacMillan (Craig); grandchildren Olivia (David), Ben, Athena, Natalie, Shania, Jack; and great-grandson Leo. Also survived by siblings Lorraine Gillis Jones, Donald Gillis (Florence), Jimmy Gillis and Margaret Maillet; as well as many cherished nieces and nephews. In eternal life she joins her loving parents; sisters, Mary, Caroline and Sandra; brother-in-law Lawrence; nephews Stephen and Roger; and niece Corrina. Her funeral mass and burial will take place at St. Josephs Parish in Southwest Margaree on Monday, July 29th, at 11:00 a.m.\n\nMORRISON\n\nEdward William Morrison, aged 56 years, of Port Hood, passed away suddenly, surrounded by family at Inverness Consolidated Memorial Hospital, on July 4th, 2024.

Eddie also leaves behind grand nephews, Luca and Koda; and grandnieces, Cali and Daisy; aunts, Norma and Eloise; and uncles; George (Bev), Clifford and Kent, plus many cousins. Throughout his life, Eddie was an avid biker and was lovingly referred to as “Ninja Ed”. He was also very keen on his crossword puzzles and eagerly looked forward to Saturday's editions of the New York Times. He was a huge fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs and an even bigger fan of carrot cake cream cheese icing! He loved to play Assassin's Creed and would often seek help from his nephews to help him beat a level. He will be deeply missed by his little dog, Baby, who has been his comfort for many years. Eddie’s family wishes to extend their heartfelt appreciation to the amazing staff at Inverness Hospital, where Eddie spent so much time during the past few years. We are incredibly grateful for the patience and compassion the staff showed towards Eddie. The family also wishes to express their gratitude to the Port Hood first responders, who made numerous trips over the years, helping to alleviate Eddie’s medical emergencies.

One could start by listing some of her remarkable accomplishments: A professional wilderness guide with over 1,000 days living, sleeping, and caring for clients in the remote areas of the world. An acclaimed wildlife and landscape photographer. A poet. An academic. A pilot. But that would not capture her independent spirit that fueled her passion for learning, exploring, and constantly discovering new limits. It would not capture the immense compassion and kindness Natalie brought to the world. She had a deep love and curiosity for the wild and natural places, which led her to seek out the breathtaking moments that so many of us miss in the busyness of our day-to-day lives. Natalie shared her passion through her camera lens and her storytelling. Her generosity was vast, taking many of us along on her countless adventures as she explored the world: observing narwhals breach from the floe edge in Nunavut, trekking through the valleys of Baffin Island, encountering penguins and icebergs while sea kayaking in Antarctica, and experiencing the world from the bird’s-eye view of her favourite plane, the Twin Otter. (To name just a few). Never thwarted by limitations that would stymie most, she always followed through on her dreams. In short, Natalie was epic. She was loved. She lived life to the fullest. We’ve never been so grateful for the odyssey she left behind, giving us access to her unique perspective of the world through her meticulous record keeping of her photos and poetry. Natalie released her first book of poetry in 2021 titled This is Where Atlantis Sank. In her 34 years, she did not waste a second. This is Where Atlantis Sank – June 17th, 2024, 8:15 a.m., 42.724997° N 073.790118° W. Natalie is survived by her mother, Mary Yap, brother Matthew Yap,11-year old rescue dog Stikine, and many cousins, aunts, uncles, and friends. She will be deeply missed by the thousands of lives that she touched, on all corners of the globe. Natalie’s celebration of life was held on Sunday, June 23rd, 2024, from 1:00-3:00 p.m. at Kane-Jerrett Funeral Homes 6191 Yonge Street, Toronto.\n\nGOOGOO\n\nChief Alexander Brian “Sandy” Googoo, 60, of We’koqma’q First Nation, passed away suddenly on Wednesday, June 19th, 2024, in Victoria County.

Mom passed away surrounded by her family in Inverness Consolidated Memorial Hospital. Mom spent her early years in Pleasant Bay, she had whimsical memories of her childhood there, which was spent outdoors and underfoot, picking fresh berries, using cattail torches, swimming and eating goodies from her mother’s restaurant. The family later moved to Inverness. Mom met her life partner and devoted husband, Charlie Beaton, when she was 18, together they shared more then 50 years and built a full life, raising their family on “the hill” in Northeast Mabou. Mom dedicated many years working at the Chowder House in Inverness, Mary's Hill Home, St. Joseph's Convent, and the arena canteen in Mabou; she was known far and wide for her fries and gravy. Mom was a devout Toronto Maple Leaf’s fan, an avid reader, and talented artist. Mom had a love for the moon and stars, she was known for being the best listener, even as her hearing declined. Her kind heart, sage advice, and gentle nature touched everyone who had the privilege of knowing her. She had a knack for ghost stories and delighted in giving others a playful scare, often bringing laughter to those around her. Growing up, summers with Mom were spent on Mabou Coal Mines Beach, with her siblings, children, and many beloved nieces and nephews in tow. There are so many of us, all close in age and we were raised as a ‘wild pack’ together and it is because of this we have volumes of memories and stories that bring us all laughter and smiles. Together our parents, aunts, and uncles instilled in us a love and appreciation for our large family. Mom was a beloved Gramma/Nannie, she was a night owl and cherished her late-night talks with her grandchildren over snacks, listening, sharing stories and advice, just as her children, Mom knew each of her grandchildren individually and celebrated their uniqueness. Colleen is survived by her loving husband, Charlie and children, Amanda (Wayne), Dylan (Melanie), Jaime (Jess), and Steven. She was a proud grandmother to Jaymus, Evran, and Síne May. She is survived by her sisters, Marion MacEachern (Dougal), Terri Moore (Leonard), and Murdell Moore (Jim); and brother, Kevin Moore (Karen), who will cherish her memory. She is also survived by her brothers- and sisters-in-law, Doug MacInnis (Sylvia), Jimmy Beaton (Sarah), Olga Everson-Beaton, Leonard Beaton (Terry), Donna Cameron (Dave), Johnny Paul Beaton (Leslie), Camillus Beaton (Shelly), Michael Beaton, Janice Marshall (Craig), Richard Beaton (Norma), Wendy Kline-Fraser, Marilyn Reil, and Larry Cook. Mom is also remembered by her many special nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends. Mom was predeceased by her parents, Marcella (Fraser) and Percy Moore; her siblings, George Fraser, Johnny Ryan, Hector Ryan, Danena Ryan, Sheldon Moore, and Connie Moore. Mom was also preceded in death by her nephew, Shane Moore; nieces, Candy Fraser and Katie Margaret Beaton; and in-laws Annie Jane (MacInnis) and Alexander Beaton, David Beaton, Ron Everson, Elaine MacDougall, Janine Brunken, and Sonny Walker. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the health care professionals who skillfully cared for Mom, and the staff at Inverness Consolidated Memorial Hospital for providing the beautiful respite of the palliative care room. In accordance with Mom’s wishes, cremation has taken place. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Central Inverness Palliative Care Society in her memory. Visitation will be held in St. Mary's Church, Mabou on Thursday, July 4th, 2024, from 10:00 a.m. - 10:45 a.m. with funeral mass to follow at 11:00 a.m. Father Andrew Gillies officiating.

Anita dedicated her career to the Strait Regional Centre for Education (formally Strait Regional School Board), where she was respected for her passion and commitment. A lover of her native Cape Breton and its beauty, she enjoyed its culture to the fullest, engaging in socializing, music, and laughter. Mom’s passions also included home decorating, gardening, horses, outdoor adventures and travel, which she pursued with her soul mate David throughout their time together. The family wishes to extend their heartfelt thanks to the caring staff at Inverness and Victoria General hospitals, where Mom spent considerable time during her final months. Mom was incredibly grateful for the care and compassion she received, and for the friendships that were built during her treatment.

Colleen had the gift to gab. She could spark up a conversation with anyone. She had friends everywhere. During her life she overcame obstacles, no one else thought possible. She was very strong willed and determined. Colleen enjoyed her life and impressed many who had the pleasure of meeting her. She had worked at Walmart in Port Hawkesbury for 16 years. She brought so many smiles to peoples’ faces who stopped by to have a chat. She fought hard those 16 years, giving her all even through her tough days, always showing up with a smile. Colleen enjoyed the simple things in life. She was her happiest heading out on the weekends with her mother to enjoy late nights at the Port Hawkesbury Legion or the Carriage House, sitting around and gossiping with her friends. She loved listening and dancing to the music. She would never turn down an opportunity to dance the night away. Colleen was always daddy’s girl. The first born to steal Danny’s heart. He took so much pride in all her accomplishments. He was Colleen’s private taxi, making sure she got out on the weekends to enjoy herself, giving her the opportunity to go to Granville Green, work at Walmart, taking drives to see family and making sure she had the best Christmas possible. She had her father wrapped around her fingers. Colleen's whole life revolved around her three nieces. The days they were born, she was the proudest. Sophia – the oldest, her goddaughter, spent endless days and nights never being apart. They enjoyed going out shopping together and Snapchat filters. Always being each other's listening ears and can't forget the love they shared with cuddles, kisses, and hugs. They were each other's rock. The bond these two shared will never be broken and will live on in Sophia's heart forever. Arabella was Colleen’s sidekick. She enjoyed being snuggled so close to Colleen and sharing endless laughs while scrolling through Snapchat, finding the silliest filters and bursting out laughing. Bella also enjoyed and took part in doing anything possible for Colleen. She would be the first to the kitchen to make Colleen a coffee, some toast and an egg. Colleen was the absolute best aunt to Sophia and Bella, giving them anything and everything. She spoiled those girls at Christmas time, birthdays, you name it, she never hesitated to spend a dollar on them. She was the proudest aunt you could ever ask for. She will be missed, so dearly. While growing up in Port Hawkesbury, she always had her twin sisters. Crystal and Diane grew up always having the respect and drive to appreciate people of all abilities. Colleen was their hero. They looked up to her and made sure she was always included. Crystal and her brother-in-law, Josh, had a special bond with Colleen. Taking her into their care after her mother passed away. From the day she moved in, she knew she was safe. She had so much love for both. She always said she was treated like a queen. She enjoyed her hot dogs and her Pepsi. Josh treated her like his own. She was so loved. It was never a dull moment being an aunt to five dogs, she loved each and every one and they made her so happy. She will be missed by Porky, Benji, Remi, Sasha, and Scotch. Her newest niece, Rielle, came early at 27 weeks. She wanted to make sure Colleen got a glimpse of her with pictures and FaceTimes. Colleen was so proud of Rielle. Always making sure she was doing okay. She couldn't wait to hold her and spoil her too. Colleen and her sister Diane loved each other immensely. She was so proud of the mother Diane became. Diane made sure Colleen always had the most beautiful pictures, and aunty gifts. She made Colleen feel so blessed. She will also miss her fur nephew Harley, who always put a smile on her face. Colleen’s most favourite pastime was talking on FaceTime, seeing her friends and family light up with each call. It got Colleen through some dark days. She was the happiest talking to Harriet Timmons. She could never get enough. She would enjoy every minute of their chats four or five times a day. Harriet kept Colleen calm, happy, loved, and adored. The family can’t thank her enough for her support. If she wasn’t talking to Harriet, she would be FaceTiming her cousin Irene, aunt Linda, or Sophia and Bella with Harley in the background. The family would like to thank everyone who supported Colleen, including friends, Sheila MacNeil and Tanya DeCoste, who went above and beyond for Colleen during her hospital stays. Her aunt Sharon and aunt Crystal, who never left her side when the scary times came. Her cousin Dakota for being her hairstylist. The Knocton family for their love and support, especially Seraya, who made Colleen feel the most beautiful she had felt in years. A special thanks to, Evelyn MacRae for visiting her at her bedside and enjoying some songs and letting Colleen have one last dance. Colleen will be forever missed by everyone. Fly high with Momma, Colleen. She needed you! A celebration of life will take place at a later date.\n\nMacDONALD\n\nJohn Hugh MacDonald, Broad Cove, Inverness County, passed away at home on June 18th, 2024, at the age of 73. John was born in Inverness to the late Donald and Anne (Gillis) MacDonald, the sixth of eight children, on March 14th, 1951. On December 28th, 1973, John married Lorraine in East Margaree; shortly thereafter, they started their family and raised three daughters together in Broad Cove, where he lived his entire life. John attended the Nova Scotia Institute of Technology in Halifax to become a plumber and pipefitter. He was a member of the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters, Local 682 for over 50 years and worked across Canada and within Cape Breton on many major construction projects that were central to the communities they operated in, such as hospitals, schools, universities, oil and gas, and more. In addition to his career, his real love was hobby farming which involved many animals, making hay, and selling sods. John loved his community of Broad Cove and the parish of Saint Margaret of Scotland Catholic Church. He was a fixture in the planning of the annual Broad Cove Scottish Concert and always looked forward to this main event of the year, and the preparations with good friends, family and neighbours that led up to it. John’s family was most important to him, and with Lorraine always by his side, they welcomed everyone to the family home in Broad Cove. Full of hospitality, it was a place where people connected over conversation, tea and good food, always. He loved it most when the house was full of his family and grandchildren and loved hearing about everyone’s accomplishments and adventures. His keen interest in people saw him with friends from across generations; everyone was a “good buddy” and he loved sharing a good story and joke. He had a quest for information; there wasn’t a newscast missed, by radio, print, television, or the internet. Harness racing was a love of his, he regularly attended the races in Inverness and watched the ones from far and wide online. John had many other interests including politics, sports, sawmills, and loved being educated by his grandchildren who shared with their grandpa about the world they are growing up in. John is survived by his wife of 50 years, Lorraine (nee LeBlanc); his three daughters, Jennifer (Steve Ashton) of Halifax, Jocelyn (Dan Jackson) of Halifax, and Joanne (Matt MacIsaac) of Yarmouth; as well as his grandchildren, Maya Ashton, Charlotte, and Flora Jackson, Luke and Sarah Burns. He is also survived by his siblings, Effie Rankin (late Joe), Rona MacLean (late Neil C), Mary Peddle (late Albert), Randy MacDonald (Eleanor), Jake MacDonald (Laura), Dolores Chapin (Paul), Michael MacDonald; cousin, Anne MacLeod; as well as his LeBlanc in-laws and many nieces, nephews, and cousins. John was predeceased by his infant daughter, his parents, and his in-laws, John Joseph and Annie Rose LeBlanc. As we move forward without him, we are left with many cherished memories of his kindness, generosity, faith, humour, and devotion to his people and community. There will be many reminders of him, ensuring that his presence is always felt in our lives. Visitation will took place on Tuesday, June 25th, in Inverness Funeral Home, 45 MacIsaac Street, from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Funeral mass took place on Wednesday, June 26th, in St. Margaret of Scotland Catholic Church in Broad Cove at 11:00 a.m., followed by burial in the parish cemetery.

Beloved wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, sister, and friend to many. Lorraine was born on September 18th, 1951, to the late Placide and the late Eva May (Covin) Poirier. Lorraine’s greatest treasures were her family and friends. She was a strong and determined woman with a huge heart. The greatest gift that she shared of herself was the warmth with which she opened her home and heart to everyone. There was always enough to eat for one more at the table and always enough room for one more in the house. As much as she loved her children, the love that she had for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren was two-fold. Her faith and her love were a driving force in everything she did for others. She lived fully and enjoyed many laughs with her friends when she would go to Bingo, to TOPS, and played Rummoli. She’d never pass up the opportunity to go on a good shopping trip. To many, she wasn’t only known as “Lorraine” but as “Lorraine the beautiful” as she named herself. In spite of dark days she may have experienced in her life, like the owl, she found her way through the night. Lorraine is survived by her devoted and loving husband, André; her two children, Barbara Deveau, and Terry (Melissa) Deveau; her grandchildren, Evan (Daffney) Deveau, Damian Deveau, Hayley Foti, Dallas Deveau, and Ryder Deveau; her great-granddaughters, Kinsley Deveau, and Layla Clements; her sisters, Marina Poirier, and Judy (Roy) Larade; her brothers, Dannie (Joan) Poirier, Everett (Annette) Poirier, Michael (Darlene) Poirier, Roy (Jillian) Poirier, Charlie (Lorraine) Poirier, Andrew (Ashley) Poirier, and Alex (Donna) Poirier; and many nieces and nephews.

Rita passed on Thursday, May 30th, in Inverness Consolidated Memorial Hospital. For those who knew Rita, you will remember her as a wonderful, caring, person who loved to laugh and take part in whatever her family and friends were up to. She loved to watch all the athletic competitions that her sons or husband were taking part in – and she didn’t mind letting any referee or umpire know when they made a bad call. Rita was an avid bingo fan, and she was thrilled when she won. She was a loyal Maple Leaf’s fan much to the disappointment of her husband, who is one of the biggest Habs fan ever. Before Rita’s illness, she loved to sing and dance to the music of the 60s and she could put anyone to shame when she did the jive or the twist. Right to her last days, she loved singing to her great-grandsons “A bushel and a peck.” She loved the colour yellow and anything that could be coloured, would simply become yellow. This meant her clothing, her flowers, even that one time she won the battle with her husband and the kitchen was painted sunshine yellow. Rita was the heart of her family, and she will always be remembered by her family and friends as a person who gave willingly of herself to make someone else happy. We will all miss her tremendously, although we know that after a long battle with cancer, she is now at rest in the hands of God in whom she truly believed. Rita is survived by her husband, Johnny Fitzner and two sons, Billy (Jody) and Chris (Eva). She was a proud Mama to her four grandchildren, Angelica, Alexandria (Ryan), Elizabeth, and Wade; along with her two great-grandsons, John Ainslie and Lauchlan. She has one remaining sister, Josie (Paul) along with many nieces and nephews. Rita was predeceased by her parents, Nellie and Charlie Cormier; two sisters, Angeline and Joan; and three brothers, Charlie, Patrick, and Philip. She was also predeceased by three brothers-in-law Herbie, Butchie, and Brian. Visitation will be held on Sunday, June 23rd, from 5:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. in Inverness Funeral Home.

Patrice bought beef cattle from farmers across Inverness County and, from 1987, had the only licensed abattoir in the county. Customers still speak of how good the cuts of meat bought at LeVert’s Meat Market were. Patrice was very community-minded and was always ready to give a helping hand to anyone in need.

Poirier, December 28th, 1937 – June 2nd, 2024: It is with great sadness the family announces the sudden but peaceful passing of our husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, André A. Poirier, Sunday, June 2nd, 2024, at the age of 86 at QEII Health Science Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia. Born in Chéticamp, December 28th, 1937, to the late Hypolite ‘Polite' and Clothilde (Deveau) Poirier; he married the love of his life, Marie Hélène, September 26th, 1959. His passing occurred just a few months shy of their 65th wedding anniversary. André began his career with the Royal Bank at the Chéticamp branch in 1955. His career progressed, moving the family throughout Nova Scotia and eventually to Montreal where André worked his way up to vice-president of Montreal Core region. André retired in 1994, and he and Marie Hélène returned to their beloved Chéticamp a year later. Even after retirement the financial world was a large part of Andre’s life; investing, discussing the markets and assisting others with financial activities. In addition to spending time with his family (as “Diddlee” to his grand children and “Didi” to his great granddaughter) and banking, he found purpose and happiness delivering “meals on wheels”, playing bridge with friends, playing and watching golf. Their life together will forever be cherished by his wife, Marie-Hélène (née Boudreau); his children, Denise (Daniel), Monique (Andrew), Marc (Josephine ‘Jo’), and Nicole; grandchildren, Alex, Kayla (Matthew) and André, and his new sunshine, great-granddaughter, Bianca. Also surviving is his brother, Gordon; and brothers and sister-in-law, Ernest, Louis-Lévi (Réjeanne) and Marie-Lorraine; numerous nieces, nephews, and extended family and dear friends from all over. The family would like to thank the first responders from the Cheticamp Volunteer Fire Department, Dr. Amelie Maillet and all the staff at Sacred Heart Hospital, Chéticamp, Cape Breton Regional Hospital, Sydney and the nurses of the CCU and Cardiac Day Unit of the QEII Halifax, as well as the Cheticamp Funeral Home, for their care and compassion in the last few days of André’s life. A funeral mass was celebrated on Saturday, June 8th, 2024, in St. Peter’s Church, Chéticamp, with Père Pierre Antoine St. Cyr and Deacon Gerald Leblanc officiating. Family flowers only. Memorial donations may be made to the Sacred Heart Hospital Charitable Foundation, Paroisse Saint Pierre, Chéticamp, “Sauvons Notre Église,” Chéticamp Volunteer Fire Department or a charity of your choice.\n\nWYRWAS\n\nRev. Dr. Gerald Wyrwas (September 28th, 1934 – May 2nd, 2024): The Rev. Dr. Gerald “Gerry” Wyrwas, a Presbyterian minister who was the long-time director of pastoral care at Bon Secours Hospital (now called the Holy Family Hospital) in Methuen, Massachusetts, died May 2nd, 2024, from complications of Alzheimer’s disease. He was 89. Those who knew him well describe Wyrwas as a family man of deep faith who embraced the many facets of his career in addition to being director of pastoral care, minister and licensed psychologist. In the 25 years he was the director of Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) at Holy Family, almost 600 participants, called “interns,” from 43 countries participated in the hospital’s program. CPE is a multicultural, interfaith approach to teaching doctors, lawyers, hospital administrators, and educators how to more effectively deliver spiritual care to seriously ill patients and their caregivers. “To say that Gerry Wyrwas is a visionary is an understatement,” a hospital colleague said when he retired from full-time work in 1999. “His work inspired CPE interns to join the ministry or to further theological education, as well as refreshing and revitalizing the work of missionaries throughout the world.” Other colleagues said his integration of theology and psychology was a “unique gift” that gave him an in-depth understanding of people. “He invites people forth, into being the best they can be, and does so with a delightful sense of humour. He is a deeply compassionate and warm person.” Family members and graduates of his CPE program often recall favourite aphorisms he relied on to perk up interns. One was: “Whenever we fail to acknowledge our God-given talents, we lie, cheat, and steal.” Another: “How are you feeling? Are you mad, sad, glad, or fearful?” Gerald Grant Wyrwas was born September 28th, 1934, in the small, remote coal-mining village of Inverness, Nova Scotia. He was the youngest of six children of Edward Theodore Wyrwas, an electrician, and Mary Agnes (MacKenzie) Wyrwas, a Sunday school teacher. After graduating from high school, he briefly worked for his father, then took a job at the Royal Bank of Canada. After being promoted to assistant accountant and assigned to the Halifax branch in 1955, he met his future wife, Ethel M. Bowman, on a blind date. They married in May 1957. Around that time, he decided to leave banking and join the ministry. “I liked banking and...had more than doubled my salary while I was with it,” he wrote years later, “but I was not satisfied. I felt there was more to life than handling other people’s money.” He enrolled at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and philosophy, with a minor in Greek. He then earned a Bachelor of Divinity at Pine Hill Divinity College in Halifax. He was a student missionary in Alberta and assisted the ministers at the Brunswick Street United Church, Truro, and Guysborough-Canso Pastoral Church. While at Pine Hill, he served as Old Barns Pastoral Charge and Maitland Pastoral Charge. After ordination, he served as Winsloe Pastoral Charge, P.E.I., and then assistant minister of Trinity United Church in Charlottetown, P.E.I. He was ordained a minister of the United Church of Canada in June 1960 and began his ecclesiastical career as the pastor of four rural churches in the village of Winsloe, Prince Edward Island. In 1967, Wyrwas moved with his family to Massachusetts and was called into pastoral ministry in the Presbytery of Boston to serve as pastor with the First Presbyterian Church of Lynn. He also was named director of the Department of Spiritual Care (Pastoral) Services at Holy Family Hospital and maintained a pastoral counseling center in Lynnfield, Mass. In 1980, Wyrwas was Moderator, or senior leader, of Boston’s presbytery, the regional governing body for Boston-area churches. A year later, he was the presbytery’s minister commissioner to the 193rd General Assembly in Houston. A Boston Presbytery colleague described him as “an articulate and calming presence” at presbytery meetings and “invaluable” as chair of the Committee on Ministry. He was a founding member of the presbytery’s Honorably Retired Ministers group. Wyrwas remained the pastor of the Lynn congregation for 20 years, finding time to earn two graduate degrees – Master’s of Sacred Theology and Doctor of Ministry – from the Andover Newton Theological School in Newton Centre, Mass. He also was a long-time adjunct faculty member of the school. In addition to his ecclesiastical training, Wyrwas was a licensed psychologist and was a member of both the American Psychological Association and the Massachusetts Psychological Association. A natural raconteur, he also enjoyed sharing humorous stories and indulging his children. His daughter Margaret said he delighted in impishly treating her and her siblings to soda and candy when they accompanied him on errands without Ethel, who frowned on her children indulging in junk food. “Family was most important in Dad’s eyes,” his son, David, said. “The second most important thing was education and knowledge. He continually was trying to enhance his knowledge and wanted to share it with everyone he came in contact with.” His musical tastes ran from Frank Sinatra to Rod Stewart, and he had a treasure chest of amusing stories to share with his family, students and parishioners. “Dad was a man of deep faith, devotion to his family and friends, and dedication to helping others,” his younger daughter, Susan Lynn, recalled. “He was willing to listen and give advice, and would surprise people who didn’t know him with his dry wit.” Susan Lynn’s son Daniel, using his nickname for the pastor, said, “Grampie had a story for everything with a knack for telling them to others. At the end of each story, he would typically share a good laugh with everyone he was telling the story to.” Wyrwas was a lifetime member of Clan Mackenzie Society of the Americas, a Master Mason for 20 years with the Lynnfield-Zetland Lodge, chaplain for the Daughters of Scotia, and president and chaplain of the Scots’ Charitable Society. He is survived by his wife, Ethel, a retired Registered Nurse Practitioner; daughters Margaret (Peter Thorner) of Westport, Conn., and Susan Lynn (Kevin Winters) of Easton, Mass.; son David (Myoung Hee) of Merrimack, N.H.; and grandson Daniel B. Winters of Philadelphia, PA. He was preceded in death by his parents; siblings Leonard, Margaret (Banks), Raymond, Maxwell, and Harold; and grandsons Thomas Ryan Winters, John David Wyrwas, and Edward Gerald Wyrwas. A memorial service will be held at 1:00 p.m. at the Bedford Presbyterian Church, 4 Church Road in Bedford, N.H. on September 28th, 2024, which would have been his 90th birthday. The Rev. Dr. John Sawyer will conduct the service. Interment will occur in the Sand Hill Cemetery, Upper Nine Mile River in Nova Scotia at a later date. It has been suggested that those who wish may make memorial contributions to one of these groups: the Alzheimer’s Association, Presbytery of Boston, Scots’ Charitable Society Scholarships and the Bedford Presbyterian Church. The Wyrwas family gives special thanks to Gerry’s caregivers: the memory care staff at the Bedford Falls Assisted Living Facility, clinical staff members at Brookhaven Hospice, both in Bedford, N.H., and the Rivet Funeral Home and Crematorium in Merrimack, N.H.\n\nGILLIS\n\nIt is with profound sorrow and disbelief that we announce the sudden passing of Joseph Daniel “Danny” Gillis, March 15, 2024. Born January 23rd, 1968, Joseph Daniel “Danny” Gillis is predeceased by his parents, John Archie and Mona (Harper) Gillis, as well as his brother, Johnny. Danny is survived by his two children, Quarrie Alexander (Abbey); Keisha Este Maria; and his grand dog, Tucker. He also leaves behind his brother, Roy (Kimmy); niece, Abby; nephews, Luke and Johnathan; sister in-law, Colleen; the mother of his children, Kathleen; along with several people that he holds close to his heart, Kevin, Donnie, Donald, Greg, Mark, Joey, Chad, Johnny, and many more. Danny possessed a heart of pure gold and an unwavering dedication to helping others, traits that endeared him to countless individuals from coast to coast. Throughout his lifetime, he forged deep connections and cherished friendships while tirelessly lending his carpentry skills and assistance to those in need. From his years working in the mines, to his ventures in steeple chasing alongside Kevin, and his endeavours in building and renovating homes across the province, Danny's commitment to hard work and generosity knew no bounds. His passion for harness racing, where he proudly supported his late brother, Johnny and had fun with friends, was matched only by his devotion to his family. As he watched his children thrive in the rink, the ball field, and the volleyball court, the memories they shared became cherished treasures. The echoes of laughter and friendship resonated within the walls of the Dr. Bernie MacLean arena, where Danny not only cheered on his children's hockey games but also showcased his exceptional talent as a curler, participating in the annual Rannie Bonspiel. Amidst his countless adventures, Danny cultivated a special bond with Quarrie and Keisha's grandmother, Mary. Their moments together over tea and biscuits were cherished, punctuated by heartfelt conversations, and shared laughter. Danny's legacy is one of compassion, hard work, and a profound commitment to those he held dear, leaving a deep-rooted mark on all who were fortunate enough to know him. Visitation will be held in Stella Maris Church, Inverness, on Saturday June 15, 2024 from 10:00-10:45 am with funeral mass to follow at 11 a.m. Burial to follow in the parish cemetery. Memorial donations in memory of Danny may be made to Stella Maris Parish Cemetery Fund.

He was the son of Earl and Weilder (Romans) Haverstock and grew up in Hammonds Plains, but established a strong love and sense of connection with his chosen home in Cape Breton. Dennis passed away suddenly in St. Martha’s Hospital in Antigonish, NS on Saturday, June 1st, 2024, at the age of 86. Dennis was a big man with a big personality who had a strong sense of community and how his business should be run. Underneath a sometimes boisterous exterior, his heart was the biggest part of him. He was a no-nonsense person when it came to the funeral profession; he believed everyone deserved to receive respectful and professional service. Outside of the funeral service, he loved to torment others and loved nothing more than to be one-upped with a clever comeback. He was a colorful storyteller and loved to see the humour in everyday life. He had a full mental catalog of great jokes and often marvelled that he could remember anything funny but couldn’t remember anything of importance from school! He rooted for the underdog and prided himself in helping those that needed help and didn’t want any recognition or acknowledgment for it. Dennis was also known for his ability to sing (loudly) and was often asked to sing in the choir for many funeral services. He took his first job in the funeral profession at Halifax Funeral Home in 1957 at the age of 18. While working in Halifax in 1958, he met Carol. Carol and Dennis were married a year later in September 1959. In 1966, they moved to Amherst, NS, to work at Campbell’s Funeral Home. In 1967, Carol and Dennis purchased a funeral business and ambulance service in Port Hawkesbury. This would be a pivotal moment in their lives; Port Hawkesbury is where they started a family and solidified their commitment to the funeral profession and the community. There were challenging times in the early days, but with perseverance, hard work, and a lot of personal integrity, the business grew. John Langley was the very first employee and was instrumental in this. Through the years, the business would grow from having one visitation room in the family house in Port Hawkesbury to five different locations: Port Hawkesbury, Whycocomagh, Guysborough, Canso, and St Peter’s. One of Dennis’s proudest accomplishments was designing and opening the funeral home in Port Hawkesbury. This was his way to give back to the families and community that supported his family and his business. He also owned and operated two ambulance services, one in Port Hawkesbury and one in St. Peter’s. He employed many loyal employees and was not only a boss to them, but formed many long-lasting friendships. Dennis was the first to bring funeral homes to areas where none existed previously, and this was a source of great pride for him. Another point of pride in his professional life was that Dennis Haverstock Funeral Homes “served all faiths.” In a way, Dennis was breaking down barriers in a time when it was challenging to do so. Dennis volunteered on many boards and was a member of many community groups through the years. In his early days, Carol and Dennis were involved in the Kinsmen/Kinettes and loved to attend local dances and church suppers. He was a past president of the Funeral Service Association of Nova Scotia and a past member of the Funeral Service Association of Canada. He also was a member of the Nova Scotia Board of Registration of Embalmers and Funeral Directors and of the board of directors of the CJFX radio station. Dennis and his wife Carol raised three children while balancing a business, maintaining two careers, volunteering in the community, and remaining closely connected to friends and extended family. Garth, their second child was born with muscular dystrophy. Knowing his life would be shorter than most, Dennis and Carol worked together to fill Garth’s life with many positive experiences. In turn, Garth had a profound and positive impact on their lives and the lives of many others. Dennis is survived by his wife of almost 65 years, Carol Haverstock (nee Dennis), their two children, Grant (Jessica Klein Herenbrink) and Gina (Sean Myles) of Wolfville, Nova Scotia. He was predeceased by two sons, Garth and Dawson. He was the very proud Grampy of Nate (13) and Audrey (11), both of Wolfville and many beloved nieces, nephews and dear friends. He has two loving sisters, Ida Boutilier of Halifax, NS, and Viola Mason of Ottawa, ON. He was predeceased by his parents Earl and Weilder (Romans) Haverstock, by his dear brother Garvie Haverstock (Lynn Durling), brothers-in-law Donald Boutilier (Ida), and Gordon Mason (Viola). Many thanks to Dennis Haverstock Funeral Homes’ past and present employees, and the good people of Port Hawkesbury and surrounding areas for the love and support through the years. A special thanks to John Langley, Glenn and Jeanette Diggdon, Ida Boutilier and Jill Haverstock, Marcie Mason of the Maples Supportive Living Community and the doctors and nurses of the Progressive Care Unit and St. Martha’s Hospital in Antigonish. Visitation took place at Dennis Haverstock Funeral Home at 724 Granville Street, Port Hawkesbury, on Thursday, June 6th, 2024, from 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. A funeral to celebrate Dennis’s life was held on Friday, June 7th, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. at St. Joseph Catholic Church, 138 Granville Street, Port Hawkesbury, NS with Rev. Susan Slater officiating. A reception and private burial followed. Donations in Dennis’s memory may be made to the Muscular Dystrophy Association of Canada, the Holy Trinity Anglican Church Cemetery Fund (Port Hawkesbury), Camp Tidnish or a charity of your choice. Words of comfort may be forwarded to the family at www.haverstocks.com.\n\nMacDOUGALL\n\nJoseph Bernard MacDougall, December 9th, 1937 – May 30th, 2024: We are heart broken to share that Joe passed peacefully at home on May 30th. He is survived by his devoted wife of 59 years, Ann (Trask) MacDougall and their three children, Katherine, Halifax, Sarah (Alan), Toronto, and Dougald John (Heather), Halifax. Tap Tap was loved by his two treasured granddaughters, Elizabeth Coffin-MacDougall (Toronto) and Meredith MacDougall (Halifax). Joe was a son of Dougald and Christy MacDougall of Mann Ave, Inverness. Joe left his adored Red Rows in 1955 and headed to Halifax with two dollars in his pocket. A chance encounter while walking his cherished sister Betty to work through the train yard resulted in a 39-year career with CN Rail. Joe loved his work as a rail roader and believed that if you loved your work, you didn’t work a day in your life. At CN he met many lifelong friends including Butch “Frenchman” Fougere whose phone calls and visits to the end meant so much to him. Joe liked to joke that he had to leave Cape Breton to find a wife. He met his “Valley girl” in Halifax and he and Ann married in 1964. They moved to Waverley and spent many happy years in Frame Subdivision raising their children. Joe loved the horse races, working in his wood pile, worrying about everyone getting their hay in on time and getting a good deal at the Sears Bargain Basement. But mostly, he was a kind and caring father, always the softy while mom held the line – always with treats for all including many trips to Sunnyside for Long Johns and the chicken burger for ice cream. He made his kids believe that there was nothing they could not do and was our biggest cheerleader. Joe and Ann retired to Cape Breton and built a home in “Beautiful West Mabou” (Dad’s standard telephone greeting). Here they tended their substantial gardens, worked on the beach committee and enjoyed the beauty of Cape Breton, often hiking followed by a meal in one of their favourite restaurants. It would not have been possible to keep Dad at home without the support of a wonderful community. A heartfelt thank you to Dad's special cousin Mary Catherine Rankin and her family and neighbours and friends Betty Jane Cameron, Nadine Hunt, and Jean Hubbard for their ongoing support. We would also like to thank the many friends and neighbours for their ongoing help with trips to appointments, hair cuts at home, snow removal, internet installation, and an endless supply of cookies. A special thank you to Sally Graham for her Gaelic songs and keeping Dad’s beard so sharp in these last months. Thank you to the Palliative Care team, community nursing and everyone at Inverness County Home Support for their kind care of Dad. We are forever grateful. Cremation has taken place, a Celebration of Life to follow at a later date. We will make sure Dad takes his last trip to Cape Mabou on a nice summer day, where we are sure he is helping to bring in the hay and looking for a cup of tea and a biscuit. In memory of Joe, please consider a donation to the Inverness Consolidated Memorial Hospital Charitable Foundation - www.icmhfoundation.com or the Alzheimer Society of Nova Scotia https://alzheimer.ca/ns/en/donate.

Born March 16th, 1942, in Truro, Myles was the son of J.P. and Viola (Wellwood) MacInnis. Myles and his siblings, Frank and Beatrice, were raised in Whycocomagh, growing up in a family that valued hard work and started two successful businesses, Vi’s Restaurant and J.P. MacInnis Trucking. With his natural driving and mechanical ability, Myles dedicated his life’s work to the continuation of his father’s company alongside his brother. Myles could be found on the road trucking, loading pulp, working in the shop, or enjoying a good conversation with his valued friends that he made over the years in this line of work. After meeting on a blind date arranged by friends, Myles and Evelyn celebrated a long marriage just shy of their 60th anniversary on her birthday on June 13th. Myles and Evelyn raised their family Annette, Jennifer, and Jamie and enjoyed time spent together on family trips and boating out on the water. Myles was especially proud of his grandchildren and great-grandson and was always a big part of their lives. Myles was an involved community member, most significantly with the Whycocomagh Volunteer Fire Department, which he joined at the age of 14 and served for over 50 years. During that time he served many roles as captains, fire chief, and president of Maritime Fire Chiefs Association and was deservingly awarded an Exemplary Service Award by the governor general. Myles will be lovingly missed by his wife, Evelyn; his children, Annette (Bruno), Jennifer (Gary), Jamie (Lindsey); his grandchildren, Myles (Cathy), Kelsey, Molly (Ryan), Rhylyn, Anthony, Ben; great-grandson, Jet; brother, Frank (Verda), sister, Beatrice, brother-in-law, Brian (Pat), nieces and nephews.

Visitation was held Friday, June 7th, from 2:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. in Dennis Haverstock Funeral Chapel, Whycocomagh.

Shirley was born into the Karley family in 1936. Her parents, Henry and Philomena, had a large working farm in Perth East near Kitchener, Ontario. Together with her four brothers Pat, Clarence, Laval, and Ray (who predeceased her) they raised crops, tended to the farm animals, and enjoyed the life that farming can bring and teach. These early lessons embraced by Shirley, catapulted her ahead of her time in her awareness of valuing and preserving natural resources. As a young student, she attempted to educate others in an eloquent and informative essay titled “Tomorrow’s Timber.” From that early farm life came a love of growing vegetables and flowers. Later in life, after her arrival on Scotch Hill 30 years ago, she worked with her late husband Hugh John, and her brother-in-law Sam, to continue cultivating the gardens and landscaping around the family home. Shirley had many vocations and excelled in all of them. She worked for Bell Canada, she was a nursing assistant at a retirement home, and she managed a transportation business in Hamilton with Hugh John. Along with her love of work, Shirley had a very playful side. She loved to be by the ocean and the lakes. Swimming and sunbathing delighted her. She had always loved music and when she came to live in Cape Breton, she immersed herself in Celtic music and soon became knowledgeable, discerning, and as vibrant attending the music scene as the music itself. Shirley had a natural curiosity about the world. She followed international events very closely. She loved to read; and Fletcher at the Harbour would set aside for her, her favourite authors from the mini library of donated books he kept at the store. Shirley has left many nieces and nephews to mourn her passing. The Karleys, the LaRusics, the Coadys, and the MacNeils. The family wishes to thank Leo Paul for all the assistance and friendship he gave to Shirley over the past two decades. In memory of Shirley you could have a special adventure with your canine friends today. Shirley always had a dog friend in her life. They gave her such joy. A graveside service was held on June 6th at St. Michael’s cemetery with Father Silvichan officiating.\n\n“The southern sky darkens; a soft mellow wind awakens the slumbering buds and snowdrops beneath the soft blanket of snow. A warm rain falls, melting the snow which now forms lacy patterns beneath the trees. Old man winter turns over, yawns and falls asleep. Spring has returned with its banners and flourishes of leaves, flowers, and happiness.” – Shirley MacNeil\n\nMacDONALD\n\nCharles “Charlie” Robert MacDonald, age 79, of the Inverary Manor, Inverness, Nova Scotia, peacefully passed away Friday, May 31st, 2024.

Harry Smith, Welsford: On a beautiful spring day, one of the kindest men that lived and absolutely the best chosen father, ever, left us to go home to be with his mom and dad and his sisters. Harry was a very quiet man, but he was always up for a good trucking story or a coffee and treat at Meh's store. During his life, he did many things. He was first and foremost a farmer, farming the large dairy and then beef farm that had been his parents and his grandparents and great-grandparents before him in Hillsborough, Mabou, Cape Breton. When his father had a heart attack at a young age, Harry took over the daily running of the farm, still giving his mom and dad the monthly milk cheque. He then took a job with his cousin, Keith Smith, driving big trucks and doing long haul trucking, which became his love. He often told the story of trying to negotiate a huge 18-wheeler down a very narrow road with a hairpin curve on the way to Meat Cove, Cape Breton. If you didn't like driving on the edge, that would not have been a trip to be on! Harry had two lives; the first in Mabou, where he grew up and farmed and worked in the woods and enjoyed the company of his cousins and school friends. Harry started his second life in August of 1999 at the age of 53 when he married his wife, Heather (Mulholland) and they began running a large B&B at the farm in Mabou; and looking after Harry's mother, Eva and Heather’s two sons, Patrick and Josh. Harry and Heather had a love for old homes (well maybe her more than him!!) but they set out to save a house or two in Mabou that was ready to fall down; and Harry discovered another talent, his ability to see what something could be and so he would pick up his tool box and say to his wife, “What's next?” In 2009, Harry and Heather set out on a new adventure; after restoring a 200-year-old home in River John, they decided to move there, and so a new life began. Heather started a singing group (The West Branch singers) after the death of their son, Keith Barnard in 2010 and Harry discovered he could SING!! And sing he did; as the group grew from 18 members to over 40. But his real love was also discovering he loved doing carpentry work; and when son, Josh, decided that was what he intended to do, Harry joined him and in 2010, they began roofing and restoring old houses and Harry became Josh's best friend and instructor and together they combined the best of experience and youthful energy! Every day was a new adventure and later, son Patrick moved to River John and became part of the daily: “Can Harry give me some advice?” or “Is Harry around?” Then son, Matt, came and needed Harry's sharp eye to look at jobs that he might do. Harry and neighbour Warren Jollimore made lots of trips to pick up things needed to work on the newest house project and together they travelled in Harry's truck listening to the radio and enjoying the time together. Harry loved his grandchildren and particularly the youngest ones, Violet, Veya, Sophia, Keith, and Sam, Faith Anne and Trey. His face would light up when they would arrive for a visit. He enjoyed George Jones and Meryl Haggard and loved singing along with them as he travelled in his truck getting supplies for the next work day. Harry loved to fish and so last summer, son Josh took him to Newfoundland supposedly to “fish” however on the day they planned to go out it was very rough and as Ian Maclean stated, “I knew we were in big trouble when Harry took his teeth out and put them in his pocket!!” and so ended the big fishing adventure (they caught several seven-inch trout in a brook!) Harry is survived by his loving wife, Heather; her children, Amy (Mark), Becky (Phil), Paul, Matt (Francine), Patrick (Kayla), Josh (Nicole); beloved grandchildren, Violet, Nevaeh, Sophia, Keith, Sam, Faith Anne, Trey, Rachel, Nathan, Ben, Cairo, and Jordan; Harry's daughter, Kimberly (Eugene); son, Stacey (Melissa); their children, Darrienne, Nathaniel, Mason, Zackary; whom he loved dearly; his brother, Sonny (Tootsie); and many cousins and nieces and nephews. He leaves also his good farming friends in Mabou, Danford, David, Malcolm and Naomi, and many more. He was predeceased by his mother and father, Eva and Nathaniel Smith, of Hillsborough, and his sisters, Jean, Ruth, and Carol; and his stepsons, Mark and Keith Barnard. A celebration of Harry's life was held at the West Branch United Church on Monday May, 27th, 6:00 p.m. - 8:00 pm. Rev. Dr. Glen Matheson officiated. There was food and friendship, and reminiscing. At 8:00 p.m., those who wished walked with the family across the road to the West Branch Cemetery and took Harry home. He was much loved and will never be forgotten. He was every one’s friend and as Lewis Wright said it so well, “Just seeing him at Meh’s in the morning, made the day start right.” He brought Joy into our lives with his kind and gentle ways and great sadness now that he is gone. Donations in his memory may be made to the Heart and Stroke Foundation. He is under the care and direction of McLaren Funeral Home, Pictou. There will be a second committal in Hillsborough, Mabou, Cape Breton, at a later date.\n\nLeBLANC\n\nLeonel Patrick LeBlanc, age 74, of Mabou, NS, passed away Tuesday, May 14th, 2024, at Inverness Consolidated Memorial Hospital surrounded by his loving family.

He grew up in Belle Cote and attended elementary and junior high school in Belle Cote/Margaree Forks.

At the age of 16, Leonel transferred to Mabou Consolidated School, where he continued his education and also met his high school sweetheart Margaret. Their shared love of music brought them together and became the foundation of a beautiful marriage that lasted over 51 years. Leonel and Margaret were known far and wide in the musical community and frequently volunteered their musical talents to anyone in need. In addition to being a devoted husband, Leonel was also a very loving and dedicated father to his two daughters and their husbands, Jennifer and Scott and Ashley and Millan.
