        "text": "Explore to the world\n\nNick Richardson\n\n“Take me to the world, where I can be alive!” ~Stephen Sondheim, Evening Primrose\n\nAfter over a year of isolation and social upheaval, Americans are ready for travel and entertainment. A night out on the Andrew J. Martin-Weber Lawn Stage is the perfect escape for these challenging times.\n\nAmerican musicals take audiences around the globe, but the lessons they espouse often apply right here at home. For example, in Cabaret, a night in Berlin’s Kit Kat Klub warned audiences of parallels between Nazi Germany and Civil Rights Era America. A visit to Oklahoma! in 1943 reminded soldiers of their purpose before fighting overseas in World War II. Even trips to imaginary places serve us well. In Shrek the Musical, the outcast fairytale creatures encourage us to embrace our differences and “let our freak flags fly,” while a jaunt Into the Woods sees other fairytale characters form a new community after their individual wishes have unexpected consequences.\n\nEach song will take you somewhere new, so grab your magic blanket (or low-profile folding chair) and travel the world with us this summer.\n\nPhoto: Karli Cadel\n\nFurther Reading on the Web\n\nAre we in “A New Golden Age for the Broadway Musical?” Writing for American Theatre magazine, Suzy Evans analyzes the state of the art form in 2019. Are today’s popular music trends, diverse stories, and commitment to social justice breaking new ground for American musicals? Or do they mark a return to the musical’s heyday?\n\nFeminism? In my Broadway musical? It’s more likely than you think. Leading feminist scholars Jill Dolan and Stacy Wolf balance film criticism and feminist analysis in their review of Into the Woods, Disney’s 2014 film adaptation of Sondheim’s musical. While you’re there, click around the blog (The Feminist Spectator) for insights into other artworks and pieces of pop culture.\n\nHistory lovers know that theater can bring history to life and re/write history in return. Alison Durkee explores the values and limitations of staging musical revivals in her blog post for HowlRound Theatre Commons, “They Won’t Remember You: Shuffle Along, Revivals, and Reconstructing the Theatrical Past.”\n\nDon’t forget the score! This short conversation with opera and musical theater director John Doyle explores the development of the “actor-musician” – stage performers who also play instruments, bringing the score out of the pit and onto the stage.\n\nPhoto: Karli Cadel\n\nAudio and Video Resources\n\nTED Talks hit the Great White Way. Now entering its tenth year, the TEDxBroadway convention brings together artists, administrators, and activists to present new ideas towards building a better Broadway. Subjects range from performance, to technology, to community.\n\nThis thorough broadcast from NPR intersperses music from Oklahoma! with interviews from those who know it best: the artists who made the show possible. Voices include Oscar Hammerstein II, lyricist of Oklahoma!; Stephen Sondheim, composer, lyricist, and student of Hammerstein; and Agnes de Mille, whose choreography for Laurey’s “dream ballet” revolutionized the American musical.\n\nIs musicology one of your “favorite things”? Even if you’re not a music scholar, you’ll find this video fascinating. Andy Einhorn walks us through the marriage of lyrics and music in “My Favorite Things” from The Sound of Music.\n\nHow do productions of Rodgers & Hammerstein’s musicals evolve to meet the demands of musical theater today? Hear from Ted Chapin—the former head of the Rodgers & Hammerstein and guest speaker at the Festival in 2019—on his role in keeping these classic musicals fresh for contemporary audiences.\n\nPhoto: Karli Cadel\n\nFor the Bookworm\n\nTake a deep dive into individual musicals with one of Scott Miller’s many books. To start, try Deconstructing Harold Hill: An Insider’s Guide to Musical Theatre. Miller is an author, playwright, and the Artistic Director of New Line Theatre in St. Louis.\n\nFor those who love performers as much as their performances, pick up Nothing Like a Dame: Conversations with the Great Women of Musical Theater. Theater journalist Eddie Shapiro interviews 20 of Broadway’s leading ladies, ranging from legends like Elaine Stritch and Chita Rivera to recent stars such as Audra McDonald, Idina Menzel, and Kristen Chenoweth. Just released this year: Shapiro’s companion book, A Wonderful Boy: Conversations with the Great Men of Musical Theater.\n\nThe Secret Life of the American Musical: How Broadway Shows Are Built by Broadway producer Jack Viertel walks readers through the form of a musical. Structured like a musical itself, each chapter represents a crucial song, dance, or plot development. He chronicles how the form changed over time, from Oklahoma! all the way to Hamilton.\n\nTheater kids get the final bow in Princeton scholar Stacy Wolf’s latest book, Beyond Broadway: The Pleasure and Promise of Musical Theatre Across America. Wolf argues that our country’s amateur performances in schools, community theaters, and summer camps are the lifeblood of musical theater. Through her thorough ethnographic fieldwork, Wolf celebrates the pleasure found in producing local theater and provides new insight into musical theater’s place in American culture today.\n\nWith a title like Hard Times: The Adult Musical in 1970s New York City, you know you’re in for a juicy read. Scholar Elizabeth L. Wollman takes you back to the days when Times Square and the city’s theater district were seedy and un-Disneyfied. Through interviews with working artists, engaging anecdotes, and previously-unpublished photographs, Wollman documents how musical theater intersected with the sexual revolution of the late 1960s, various civil rights movements, and the city’s financial downturn.\n\nPhoto: Karli Cadel\n\nTo the World Credits\n\nG.
