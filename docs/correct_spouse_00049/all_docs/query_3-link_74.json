        "text": "Outlander\n\nBy Diana Gabaldon,\n\nFrom my list on thriller/suspense escapism with strong female protagonists, full of grit, sass, and humour.\n\nBy Teresa M. Schulz Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have always had a wicked imagination and loved to tell stories. Unfortunately, this had me naively believing in fairy tales and happy endings. Cinderella has a lot to answer for. My kind heart and trusting nature were a magnet for bad men, and boy, did I suffer because of it. The term “Viking Berserker” comes to mind. This is why I have a passion for reading about strong women. I’ve learned (through reading books – such as those on my recommended list) that to survive, you have to have hope for a better future, and inspiring people – within inspiring stories – can often give you that hope.\n\nTeresa's book list on thriller/suspense escapism with strong female protagonists, full of grit, sass, and humour\n\nWhy did Teresa love this book?\n\nThe Author’s style is totally immersive. It begins with time travel through standing stones, and the genres multiply from there. The story has a good pace, plenty of action and adventure, humour, and a hunky scotsman… what else could you ask for?\n\nIn all seriousness, the main character is a feisty WW2 nurse who, when challenged, is ready to voice her opinions with plenty of sass. She is also strong, skilled, kind-hearted, and downright funny at times. She reminds me a lot of myself.\n\nBy Diana Gabaldon,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n33 authors picked Outlander as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The first book in Diana Gabaldon’s acclaimed Outlander saga, the basis for the Starz original series.\n\nOne of the top ten best-loved novels in America, as seen on PBS’s The Great American Read!\n\nUnrivaled storytelling. Unforgettable characters. Rich historical detail. These are the hallmarks of Diana Gabaldon’s work. Her New York Times bestselling Outlander novels have earned the praise of critics and captured the hearts of millions of fans. Here is the story that started it all, introducing two remarkable characters, Claire Beauchamp Randall and Jamie Fraser, in a spellbinding novel of passion and…\n\nPreview\n\nWishing for a Highlander\n\nBy Jessi Gage,\n\nFrom my list on historical romance set in Scotland.\n\nBy Jayne Castel Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always had a fascination with the past. After graduating with an Honors degree in English Literature, with a minor in History, I spent years working as an English Language Teacher, while I wrote stories in my free time. Writing is a compulsion for me. It’s my escape and entertainment – my solace in tough times. Now, as a full-time author, I’m lucky enough to get to spend my days in Ancient and Medieval Scotland. I write the kind of stories I love to read: with vibrant characters, richly researched settings, and action-packed adventure romance that transports readers to forgotten times and imaginary worlds.\n\nJayne's book list on historical romance set in Scotland\n\nWhy did Jayne love this book?\n\nI know this is 'another’ Scottish time travel historical romance – but I’d been looking for a novel in this genre and this one was great. There are also touches of humor throughout that were reminiscent of Gabaldon’s writing style. Single and pregnant (yes pregnant!) museum-worker, Melanie gets transported to 16th Century Scotland when she examines an ancient wooden box. There, she meets Darcy – a brave yet innocent young man who becomes her unlikely protector when she’s accused of witchcraft. This novel grips you from the first page. Gage evokes the setting and time period brilliantly, and the romance is realistically portrayed and emotional.\n\nBy Jessi Gage,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Wishing for a Highlander as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSingle-and-pregnant museum worker Melanie voices an idle wish while examining a Scottish artifact, that a Highland warrior would sweep her off her feet and help her forget her cheating ex.

Gregor the \"Sinclair Hound\" was hanged as a boy. As a result, he bears a scarred neck and a damaged voice. I do love a ‘wounded’ hero, and Gregor’s suffering is palpable. But he’s unwaveringly loyal and is infatuated with his laird’s daughter, Pearl. Little does he know that she too has a fascination for him – and when he’s charged with escorting her to a nunnery, sparks fly.

The hero, Tormod MacLeod, is a man on a mission, to support Robert the Bruce in his struggle against the English. When he’s tricked into marrying Christina Fraser, a young noblewoman whose father was imprisoned for supporting William Wallace, he’s determined to keep his wife in her place. He has no time, or interest, in love. However, control slowly slips from his grip. This novel has one of the best kiss scenes I’ve ever read, and the setting at Dunvegan Castle upon the Isle of Skye is beautifully researched and depicted.\n\nBy Monica McCarty,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Chief as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAN ELITE FIGHTING FORCE UNLIKE THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN . . .\n\nScouring the darkest corners of the Highlands and Western Isles, Robert the Bruce handpicks ten warriors to help him in his quest to free Scotland from English rule.

Brand Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nHorror was never something that appealed to me when I was younger. However, in adulthood, I realised the fascination of the unsettling. As I began writing, I realised that true horror is not all about monsters and gore but about breaking our everyday complacency and realising the possibility that the world is bigger than us and how we are unprepared to deal with it. This is why I write horror. Not to shock you with a jump-scare, but you leave you thinking about my words long after the lights have gone out.\n\nThomas' book list on leaving you spooked and unsettled\n\nWhy did Thomas love this book?\n\nOne night, a gaunt woman stumbles into the road in front of Lauren and her father. They take her home, but the next day she is gone, and only Lauren can remember she was ever there.\n\nThe best supernatural horror works because it reflects the terrors of real life. Francine Toon’s Pine is the story of Lauren, a young girl growing up in rural Scotland with an alcoholic father and only the memory of a mother who disappeared when she was a child.\n\nAnd while the supernatural is always present, it is the isolation and actions of the living that create true horror.\n\nBy Francine Toon,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Pine as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWINNER of the McIlvanney Prize 2020\n\nShortlisted for Bloody Scotland's Scottish Crime Debut of the Year 2020\n\nLonglisted for the Highland Book Prize 2020\n\n'Hugely atmospheric, exquisitely written and utterly gripping' LUCY FOLEY, author of The Hunting Party\n\n'It's both eerie and thrilling at once, and had me under its spell until the end' SOPHIE MACKINTOSH, author of Blue Ticket and The Water Cure\n\n______________\n\nThey are driving home from the search party when they see her.

Isserly, the main character of the book, isn’t really a woman but an alien wearing a human suit to draw in her victims while driving around rural Scotland.\n\nI’m Scottish myself, and recently, I found myself feeling a genuine sense of paranoia while out hillwalking and seeing a lone figure in the distance. It’s a hard read, almost sickening at times, but I’m not exaggerating when I say I believe I will be thinking about it for the rest of my life. I wouldn’t recommend it for the faint-hearted, and it’s definitely not a comfort read, but if you have the stomach for it, this is a truly remarkable novel.\n\nBy Michel Faber,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Under the Skin as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWith an introduction by David Mitchell\n\nIsserley spends most of her time driving. But why is she so interested in picking up hitchhikers? And why are they always male, well-built and alone?\n\nAn utterly unpredictable and macabre mystery, Under the Skin is a genre-defying masterpiece.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Second Stranger\n\nBy Martin Griffin,\n\nWhy did Claire love this book?\n\nThis is another chiller thriller, set in a remote hotel in the Scottish Highlands. (Note to self: only holiday in Scotland in the summer!)\n\nThe hotel is closed to guests, and Rennie Yorke is working what should be her final shift when a storm blows in and seals off her exit. But she’s not alone for long – an injured man arrives at the door, claiming to be a police officer who was transporting a dangerous prisoner when his car crashed, and the prisoner escaped. Rennie lets him in – but shortly afterward another man arrives, making the same claim.\n\nIt’s a brilliant hook, and I was completely immersed in trying to work out who was telling the truth and who was lying.\n\nBy Martin Griffin,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Second Stranger as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nONE DETECTIVE.

It’s presented as a sort of ‘missing person mystery,’ but it’s actually quite an experimental and literary novel.\n\nThe whole story, written in often surreal fragments, takes place in the Scottish wilderness and is rife with unforgettable imagery. Ultimately, it’s a story about grief, and the fragmented narrative style perfectly suits this theme.\n\nBy Chris Carse Wilson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Fray as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'Beautiful, amazing, mesmerising' ALAN CUMMING\n\nA MISSING PERSON MYSTERY LIKE NO OTHER\n\nI am not gone.

I first read this as a young girl, and loved it so much I saved my pennies to buy my own copy (I still have it). Sally Watson showed me how to create a real, believable, and magical heroine. One with flaws, and fears, and a call to be other than those who surround her. Other than those who surround her. The story also takes place in the Scottish Highlands, a place very dear to my heart, and presents a wealth of actual historical characters who come to life between the pages. This one will forever have a place in my heart.\n\nBy Sally Watson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Witch of the Glens as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe time was 1644 in Inverness, Scotland.
