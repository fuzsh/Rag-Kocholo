Tom enjoyed muscle cars, car cruises, Westview Oldies Dances, fishing, shooting guns at the gun range, and spending quality time with his family and friends. Anyone that knew him well also knew how much he loved his frappes! Tom was a tough guy with a heart of gold and a great sense of humor. Throughout his life, Tom was always cracking jokes, coming up with funny sayings, and complimenting people all the time.

Mary Jane was a child of the Depression. She often recounted vivid stories to her children about the many challenges she and her parents faced during that difficult era. Mary Jane weighed just three pounds at birth when NICUs were nonexistent and excellent infant care was nascent. Her\n\nyounger brother Donald died shortly after childbirth. Regardless of season or weather, Mary Jane walked to grammar school held in a one-room schoolhouse at St. Alphonsus, Wexford. Frequently, her lunch consisted of onion sandwiches and no special food treats during the worst of the Depression. Mary Jane often marveled how she survived low birth weight, an early childhood home with neither heat nor hot water, food insecurities, and the inherent difficulties of the Depression era to become a nonagenarian.\n\nMary Jane was a consummate optimist who lived a life of pervasive positivity. She countered the stories of myriad hardships growing up with numerous, loving recollections of bicycling in spring and summer throughout the countryside of Wexford and Bradford Woods with her beloved Mother Margaret in tow, picking wild berries to make pies, participating in the many farm activities during the fall apple harvest, raising chickens, playing with her much-loved dog Toby, and celebrating holidays with a large extended family. Mary Jane graduated from Holy Ghost High School and St. John’s Hospital School of Nursing in Pittsburgh. She served as a Nurse in her early career, married her beloved husband George J. Jacobs, MD, reared four children, entered local politics to win an election and served for two terms as President of the Board of Education - Pittsburgh Public Schools, and selflessly cared for many elderly and infirm relatives throughout her life. Mary Jane loved the ocean and beaches. She read eclectically, learned to play golf in her 40s and then golfed regularly with her husband, enjoyed traveling, and was engaged in politics. She was in every way a caring, dedicated, supportive, and loving daughter, wife, mother, grandmother, and friend. Her children consider themselves beyond blessed to have recently celebrated their Mother’s 99th birthday, two weeks prior to their Mom’s passing. The celebration was held outside at Mary Jane’s Wexford home on a glorious sunny, blue-sky day. Her favorite Glen Miller big band songs played in the background, and a small circle of special people in her life attended. Mary Jane was radiant. Mary Jane was preceded in death by her husband George with whom she celebrated 60 years of marriage. Her eldest daughter Mary Lee of Concord, MA predeceased her. Mary Jane is survived by three children, Alexia, Catherine, and George (Alexandra), three grandchildren Tucker (Liz), Caroline, and Charlotte, and a great grandson due in September Visitation will be held from 6:00 pm - 8:00 pm on Monday, June 10, 2024, at George A.

He leaves behind his beloved wife of nearly 57 years, Karen and his daughter, Kim Zemmali (Mounir) of Atlanta, and son, James Kliem of Pittsburgh, and three adoring grandchildren, Eric, Lydia and Stefane Zemmali. He is survived by his three brothers, Tom, Ed and John Kliem (Mary), sister-in-law, Mary Jane and many cherished nieces and nephews. Jim was born in 1945 as the third child of Nick and Frances (Skocik) Kliem in Hillsville, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Mohawk High School in 1963 and was a star athlete in multiple sports earning him numerous headlines in the local news. The papers called him a “triple-threat” in track and field as a high jumper, discus thrower, and “ace” shot putter who broke his own school records and earned a WPIAL Class B title. He was also known as the “Mohawk blockbuster” playing fullback and defensive end, holding the high school touchdown record from 1963 to the early 2000s. Jim was offered and accepted a full four-year football scholarship to the University of Miami. James fell instantly in love with a lovely nursing student, Karen Cunningham, when he saw her sitting on a stool at Chiefs Bar. He spun her around and the rest is history. They married on July 8, 1967 and resided in Youngstown and Boardman, Ohio with their two children. His position at General Refractories brought the family to Wexford in 1979. He eventually built his own business as a skilled salesman thanks to his magnetic personality. Jim and Karen joined Wildwood Country Club where they were active members and avid golfers for over 40 years. Klemmie, as he was known by his friends, brought his athleticism to his golf game, and could never be counted out. His creative style and seemingly “magic” shot-making ability when he was in a pinch was also fun-lovingly known at Wildwood as making “a Klemmie.” Jim was a devoted Steeler fan, charismatic storyteller, antique collector and a friend to all. He cherished his loving wife, children, grandchildren and adopted cat, Itty Bitty. He is preceded in death by his parents, in-laws, his oldest brother, Nick Kliem, sisters-in-law, Joanne Kliem (Tom) and Marsha Kliem (Ed), and a beloved cat named Woody that Karen found on the golf course. A Celebration of Life and Blessing Service followed by a reception will be held at 6pm on Friday, April 19th at the Pittsburgh North Golf Club located at 3800 Bakerstown Road, Gibsonia, PA 15044.

He is survived by his mother Joan Nickerson, father Albert Wessel and siblings Helen Orr (John Love) Jason Wessel, Kelly Jo McIntyre (Luke) N Orr (Danielle Scuilli) Pam Orr, Haley Finkelman (Isaac), and several aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews. Patrick’s party started in a military hospital in Nuremberg, Germany, and he was the life of it ever since. Patrick was an Army brat until the age of seven, when dad retired from the military. The family settled in Pittsburgh PA, which he would call his hometown until the end. Patrick was a jack of many trades: he was a conversationalist who loved to argue, forensics was one of his favorite activities at Pine Richland High School, he knew several languages, loved to dance (the rockettes envied his high kicks), cook, and volunteer. He studied dance at CCAC and Slippery Rock University. Patrick loved his siblings and spent a lot of time with them, especially in the spirit of gaming. He hosted D&D nights (he was the best at casting fireballs) and raised his little sister with a green N64 controller in her hand. Patrick was a loud and proud gay man, and his presence will be greatly missed by the LGBTQ community. Patrick would be the rainbow after a stormy day that made you realize the worst was over and it would be okay. He had a way of lifting you up with a bardic inspiration no matter how long you knew him. If he had one last thing to say, it would probably be, “YASSS QUEEN.” A Celebration of Patrick’s life will be held at the North Park Cabin, E. Ingomar Road, Allison Park, PA 15101 on Thursday, April 18 from 4:00 - 7:00 p.m\n\nO’Neill, Kevin E.\n\nAge 65, of Town of McCandless, on Thursday, April 11, 2024; Son of the late Edmond and Mary Adele O'Neill; loving father of Erin Pittavino (Greg) Katelyn Drabik (Steve), Samuel O'Neill (Elisha'h), and Sean O'Neill; grandfather of Dominic, Maxime, Emery, Victor and Baby Girl; brother of Patricia Scheurer (Sonny), Terrence O'Neill (Tara), Brian O'Neill and the late Timothy O'Neill ( Noreen).; dear nephew of Ann \"Nancy\" O'Malley.

(Who are we kidding? He was probably skipping.) Known as Curry to those who knew him best, he was born on January 13, 1934, to parents Georgeanna (nee Curry) and Walter Sharlow. He grew up in West View, graduating from West View High in 1950. According to the many notes and photos that are still in the family’s possession, he enjoyed the company of many girls from the area and was fondly called a “swell guy” by most of them. Joining the U.S. Marine Corps in 1952, Curry spent time in Camp Lejeune, Germany, and various other countries. His years in the Marine Corps were well spent and productive. He grew 3” and the physicality of the job added muscle to his slight frame. Curry earned the rank of Sergeant and qualified as an expert marksman. During his service, he was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Good Conduct Medal and the Navy Occupational Medal. Of the many stories told about those years, he fondly recalled learning a valuable lesson about how to handle the effects of seasickness when on a ship that is in turbulent waters: “Watch the updraft!” Returning to Pittsburgh, Curry married his girlfriend, Millie, and had 3 sons: Kirk, Doug, and Dwayne. Unfortunately, Millie passed away in 1963, leaving Curry to raise their boys as a single dad until he met Barb “Boopie” Laux, a lively and lovely divorcee with 2 daughters, Terri and Susan. The story goes that, when they met, Curry had “some money” and Boopie just “loved kids!” So, the two crazy lovebirds married in January 1965, weaving their families together. Their daughter, Kelly, was born later that year, solidifying their pseudo-Brady-Bunch life. Curry and Boopie settled in Ingomar in 1967, raising their 6 children in the idyllic neighborhood with multitudes of other families. The Sharlows enjoyed many loud, boisterous, hectic years there among their loving friends and neighbors. During this time, Curry drove a delivery truck for Braun Baking, supplying local grocery stores with Town Talk bread before bringing a loaf or two home each day. (Let’s face it: with 8 people to feed, lots of food was needed all the time.) When he wasn’t working or trying to corral the kids, Curry could be found on a golf course. A day spent on the greens was an excellent one — any season, rain or shine. He regularly enjoyed golf trips with his friends all over the U.S. A longtime member of Ingomar United Methodist Church, Curry volunteered as a lay pastor, served on numerous committees, and was a valuable source of help to anyone who needed it. He will be remembered for his outgoing personality, quick wit, and hearty laugh. He will remain famous for his delicious and perfectly smooth fudge. Others may have the recipe, but Curry had the magic touch. Friends and family looked forward to receiving theirs every Christmas, each piece perfectly cut to size to fit squarely in the box. In fact, at the annual dessert auction at church, his boxes of fudge consistent"
