        "text": "In January 2013, the nation was horrified when Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe was murdered as he carried out a routine cash-escort duty at the Lordship Credit Union in Dundalk, Co Louth. Aaron Brady, the chief suspect, fled to the United States where he built a new life for himself, starting a family. While in some ways he was careful to cover his tracks, his habit of bragging about the murder after a few drinks would eventually see him arrested and charged. Deported back to Ireland where he faced the prospect of a 40 year jail term, Brady coordinated a campaign of witness intimidation from his cell in Mountjoy Prison.\n\nPat Marry, former colleague of Adrian Donohoe and the detective inspector in charge of the investigation, and journalist Robin Schiller take us inside the notorious case, describing the gardai's unprecedented collaboration with the FBI, the NYPD and Homeland Security which finally brought Brady to justice, following the lengthiest police inquiry and murder trial in the history of the Irish state. Filled with details not previously known to the public, Murder at Lordship is the definitive account of one of the most shocking crimes of this century.\n\n'Gripping, shocking, brilliantly written...I couldn't put it down' - Paul Williams\n\nAfter being turned away by An Garda Siochana at 17 for being too young, Pat Marry joined the force eight years later. He went on to investigate some of Ireland's most high profile cases, including the killings of Rachel O'Reilly and Garda Adrian Donohue. He retired in 2018 at the rank of Detective Inspector. In 2019 he published a memoir, The Making of a Detective.\n\nRobin Schiller is a journalist for Mediahuis Ireland covering Independent.ie, the Irish Independent and the Sunday Independent.\n\nWe provide FREE delivery in the Republic of Ireland when you spend â‚¬49 or more.\n\nFREE Click & Collect from The Ennis Bookshop.
