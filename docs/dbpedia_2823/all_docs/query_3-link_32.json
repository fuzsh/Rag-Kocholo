Coming from an ancient line of Hungarian nobility—his father's side was raised to ranks by the Austro-Hungarian Emperor Rudolf, in recognition of scholarly achievements—and on his mother's side a direct line of descent to the Royal family of England, the House of Windsor. The Family was famous for the academic and artistic achievements through the centuries. His grandmother was an eminent pupil of Thoman, at the Franz Liszt Academy (a direct disciple of Franz Liszt). At a very early age, his mother, herself an accomplished pianist and teacher had discovered his musical talent. At the age of five he began his musical studies with his mother and a year later he entered the then newly established Kodály School of Music, under the personal supervision of the Hungarian composer-educator Zoltán Kodály.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Very shortly he attracted the attention of Kodály himself, who developed a lifelong teacher-student relationship with Mr. Joo, which lasted until the death of the composer. During his studies in the Kodály school he was introduced by his teachers to visiting musicians such as Igor Stravinsky, Aram Khachaturian, Pablo Casals, Carl Orff, Yehudi Menuhin, and Dmitri Shostakovich.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He studied at the Bartók Conservatory and, at the age of 16, he was admitted to the University level of the Franz Liszt Academy of Music where he studied piano with Joseph Gat and P. Kadosa. By this time he had won his first international Piano competition in Taormina in Italy, playing the Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]As a child prodigy he periodically visited Salzburg, Austria to study at the Mozarteum. At the age of 17 he was invited to give a solo recital in the Montreux festival (Switzerland) in the same series as Martha Argerich, Geza Anda, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli. Joo's piano performances took him to Switzerland, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Germany.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At the age of 20, Joó emigrated to the United States, to study at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City as a Special Student. In his first year of study at Juilliard, he won the First Prize of the International Franz Liszt Piano Competition in Boston, Massachusetts.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He became a citizen of the United States and started his conducting career in San Diego, California at the age of 21, conducting at the Summer Festival a production of the Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro. At the age of 22, he entered Indiana University, in Bloomington, Indiana to study conducting. He graduated with a MM in Conducting (Orchestral and Opera). During this time he also studied conducting with Igor Markevitch in Monte Carlo after which he was named the resident Music Director and Principal Conductor of the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra in Tennessee at the age of 24. Joo was the youngest ever Music Director/Conductor of a metropolitan orchestra in the history of the United States. During this time he guest conducted in many different places including the Netherlands, Mexico, and the US. At the age of 26, the cultural arm of the United Nations, UNESCO, selected him to conduct a special performance representing the United States in Monte Carlo —which he accomplished to great critical acclaim. At this time he became a private student/confidante of the Italian conductor Carlo Maria Giulini.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Next he became the Music Director and Principal Conductor of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra. During this time he had many guest conducting appearances all over the world, with many leading orchestras of the world, including the London Symphony Orchestra, The Philharmonia Orchestra of London, London Philharmonic Orchestra, Amsterdam Philharmonic, Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra, and Vienna Tonkunstler Orchestra.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1980-81, he recorded the complete orchestral works of Béla Bartók with the Budapest Symphony and Philharmonic Orchestras. Virtually all the newspapers and magazines in the United States and Europe such as Newsweek, Time Magazine, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Saturday Review, Chicago Tribune, The Times, (even Sports Illustrated and National Geographic) hailed these recordings as a milestone both in digital (then new) technology and the quality of the performances.[citation needed] Stereo Review (1981) awarded the Record of the Year to maestro Joo for his five-disc Bartók set. In 1982, he recorded the complete orchestral works of Kodály. For the next 15 years, he conducted many of the leading orchestras of the world and toured in Germany, England, Italy, Austria, Hungary, and the Netherlands.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1987, he took the position of Music Director and Principal Conductor of the Orquesta Sinfonica De Radio Television Espanola in Madrid, Spain (Spanish Radio and Television Orchestra) under Royal Patronage. He was only the third foreign–born conductor to hold this position (after Igor Markevitch and Sergiu Comissiona). In 1987, Joo recorded the Complete Orchestral Works of Franz Liszt for which he has received the coveted \"Grand Prix du Disque\" in Paris, directly from the French Minister of Culture, Mr. Leotard.[citation needed][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He also held the positions of Principal Guest Conductor of the Budapest Symphony Orchestra, Principal Guest Conductor of the European Community Chamber Orchestra. (Residency: London, England) Later he has become the Music Director and Conductor of Brabant Orchestra in the Netherlands, conducting many performances throughout Europe (Brighton –England- festival, Concertgebouw Amsterdam).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Joo also conducted concert tours with the Budapest Symphony Orchestra (Germany 10 concerts), Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra (Germany 25-25 concerts), Hungarian State Orchestra (England 8 concerts), Budapest Concert Orchestra (Netherlands, Italy, Spain 22 concerts), The Spanish Radio Orchestra (France, Spain), and Philharmonia Hungarica.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He founded in Budapest, Hungary, the European Symphony Orchestra, of which he was the Principal Conductor since 1998.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In addition to his busy conducting schedule Joó taught Master classes and has given lectures at various US and Canadian Universities, such as Indiana University (Visiting Professor of Music), Banff Centre of the Arts (Canada), Mount Royal College, University of Alberta, Canada; for two years in succession he has taken over the Master Classes in Conducting for young conductors in Assisi, Italy from the most famous conducting teacher of the 20th Century, Maestro Franco Ferrara, thus inheriting the \"mantle\" of this most respected and beloved teacher.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He recorded for many international labels, including Hungaroton, Philips, Sefel, Arts, Erasmus, RCA, and Laserlight. His discography includes more than 50 CDs.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2015 - Blur's Damon Albarn was removed from stage at the Roskilde festival in Denmark after a mammoth five-hour set. The singer who was headlining the event with his Africa Express project encouraged the crowd to protest at the plug being pulled. The stage manager emerged, put the singer's jacket over his shoulders and lifted him off stage.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2015 - Ariana Grande licks some donuts on a display counter at Wolfee Donuts in Lake Elsinore, California.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Security video appears a few days later, showing her furtively putting her tongue on the donuts while laughing and canoodling with her boyfriend. The 22-year-old singer and former Nickelodeon star can also be heard in the video saying, \"I hate Americans. I hate America.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The story spreads quickly, spawning various hashtags (#DonutLicker, #DonutGate) and causing problems for the bakery, which has its health code rating downgraded (it would later be restored). A cashier at the establishment would later add that she was \"really rude.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Grande's reputation takes a hit, leading her to issue a four-minute video apology, where she says, \"I was so disgusted with myself, I like wanted to shove my face into a pillow and like disappear.\" [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2016 – Geoffrey Richard Shovelton, English singer and illustrator best known for his performances in leading tenor roles with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in the 1970sm dies at age 80.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Shovelton began his professional life with a teaching career, during which he began to perform professionally in oratorio and opera. He became a full-time professional singer in 1971, performing with Scottish Opera and other companies. Shovelton joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1975, playing the leading tenor roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas until the company closed in 1982. He also made a few recordings with the company.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He continued to perform in Savoy operas, other operas and in concerts both in the UK and the US, and to organize tours and direct productions. Shovelton also illustrated books, journals, promotional materials and greeting cards, mostly in connection with Gilbert and Sullivan. He and his wife settled in the US, in Maine, in 2001, after which he continued to direct, until 2005, and to create artworks, write and give lectures until his last years.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Shovelton was born in Atherton, Lancashire, the only child of Kathleen and Richard Shovelton. He attended the Thornleigh Salesian College in Bolton and studied geography at the University of Hull. While at Hull, he met and married his first wife, Margaret, née Blanchard, a fellow geography student. He began a career in education, and for several years he was senior geography master at the Salvatorian College, a grammar school in Wealdstone, Middlesex, while pursuing post-graduate research at the University of London. Meanwhile, he played the piano and organ and studied voice with Dino Borgioli, Roy Henderson and Denis Dowling. While still teaching, Shovelton performed in amateur operatic productions and first played in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera in 1961 in The Pirates of Penzance. In 1964 and 1965 he received awards in singing competitions at 's-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands and Verviers in Belgium, and these helped him to decide to pursue a career in opera.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Shovelton first sang professionally in oratorio, performing in such works as Handel's Messiah, Haydn's Creation, Mendelssohn's Elijah, and Verdi's Requiem, finally becoming a full-time singer in 1971. Early in his career he played principal roles with Nonesuch Opera, Chelsea Opera Group, Tayside Opera, Basilica Opera, Scottish Opera and its touring group, Opera for All. His roles included Roderigo in Verdi's Otello, Don Curzio in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, and Lysander in Benjamin Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream. He returned to the Savoy Operas in 1973 with the touring companies Gilbert and Sullivan for All in the UK and The World of Gilbert & Sullivan in Australasia and the US.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Having joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as principal tenor at the beginning of the 1975–76 season, Shovelton initially played Tolloller in Iolanthe, Nanki-Poo in The Mikado, Colonel Fairfax in The Yeomen of the Guard, and later that season added the roles of Luiz in The Gondoliers and the Duke of Dunstable in Patience. In 1977 he added to his repertoire the roles of Cyril in Princess Ida and Box in Cox and Box when those works were revived. He played the Defendant in a special performance of Trial by Jury in 1978 at London's Middle Temple Hall to commemorate the Bar Musical Society's first hundred concerts. In April 1979 he left D'Oyly Carte to tour with several other former D'Oyly Carte singers in a group that he founded, The Gilbert and Sullivan Companions, and he took other singing assignments. In 1980, he rejoined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, continuing with them until the company closed in February 1982. Shovelton recalled the \"family spirit\" of the company, writing that this was necessary in a year-round touring company where \"singing takes me away from my wife and three young children for extended periods\". Shovelton's first marriage was eventually annulled; the couple's children were Claire, Dominic and Bruno. During these years, he also appeared at the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival in 1977, among a few other concert appearances for various charities, also sometimes designing artwork for the benefits.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After the closure of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, Shovelton sang opera roles together with some old Scottish Opera colleagues, with piano accompaniment, in a wine bar, Il Boccalino and a restaurant, Terrazza-Est, both in London, including Rodolfo in La bohème. He also sang with the London Operetta Ensemble, presenting concerts of opera and lighter music in seaside venues in southern England. He continued to perform Gilbert and Sullivan: with the London Savoyards, he played Ralph Rackstraw in H.M.S. Pinafore, Frederic in The Pirates of Penzance and the Defendant in Trial by Jury. These were roles that he had not sung with D'Oyly Carte. He also sang in G&S concerts, with former D'Oyly Carte colleagues, in groups performing under the names Gilbert and Sullivan in Concert and The Magic of Gilbert and Sullivan. From 1984 to 2000, Shovelton frequently toured North America with, among others, Kenneth Sandford, John Ayldon and Lorraine Daniels, in a five-singer concert programme, created by Shovelton, called The Best of Gilbert and Sullivan. This group also performed on the radio and released three recordings of their repertoire. He also performed with a group of former D'Oyly Carte members called G&S a la carte. In the 1990s, he performed on occasion at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in Buxton, England and with the Washington Savoyards in the US. In the 1980s and 1990s, he also entertained on several cruises and continued other concert work in Britain and Europe.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]For many summers beginning in 1985, he performed in the productions of the Savoy Operas at the Gawsworth Hall Open Air Festival in Cheshire, In 1985, Shovelton met the American soprano and choreographer Deborah Clague (1949–2016) while singing together in La traviata at Il Boccalino, and the two married in England in 1993. Clague joined Shovelton in The Best of Gilbert and Sullivan touring group from 1993 to 2005. They also performed in concert as a duo, \"The Two of Hearts\", often in hospitals. With his wife, he directed numerous Gawsworth Hall productions from 1995. He also directed Gilbert and Sullivan operas for a number of amateur groups on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2001, the Shoveltons moved to New Portland, Maine, in the United States, where they continued their involvement in Gilbert and Sullivan by directing productions for the Hancock County Gilbert and Sullivan Society (2003–2006), among others.[ He continued to write and create artwork until his last years. Shovelton served, from 1990 until his death, as the Honorary President of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society of New York, where he gave the Jay Newman memorial lecture in 2014.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Shovelton died at the Androscoggin Hospice in Auburn, Maine, only a month after his wife's death and the diagnosis of his brain tumor. The ashes of Shovelton and Clague rest at the Shovelton family burial site in Atherton.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]As an artist, Shovelton began with scraperboard and ink drawing and later turned to watercolour painting. He also became a skilled calligrapher. He designed posters, flyers and other artwork for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, including the programme cover for the company's last night at the Adelphi Theatre, as well as for all the Gawsworth Hall productions. He created the book covers and illustrated poem collections by his former tutor and friend, the geographer Jay Appleton. Shovelton's cartoons graced the monthly newsletter of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society of New York, The Palace Peeper, for over three decades. Shovelton also created numerous Gilbert and Sullivan themed Christmas, greeting and note cards, and was a keen photographer. He provided the cover illustration for a novel by Tony Joseph, The Diary of April March, and illustrated two books of poetry by his former tutor at Hull, Jay Appleton (Grains Among the Chaff and Enter the Fat ....) and all three editions of Harry Benford's The Gilbert and Sullivan Lexicon (1978, 1991 and 1999).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2016 – William Alfred Hawkins, Canadian songwriter, poet, musician and journalist, most notable for his contributions in the 1960s to Canadian folk rock music and to Canadian poetry; dies at age 76. His best known song is \"Gnostic Serenade\", originally recorded by 3's a Crowd.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] When I started writing songs, it was to put music to Bill Hawkins' lyrics.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Bruce Cockburn (2005), Preface to William Hawkins, Dancing Alone: Selected Poems[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] I just dropped out sometime in 1971, when I woke up in the Donwood Clinic, a rehab centre in Toronto, with no idea how I got there, weighing 128 lbs and looking like a ghost in my six-foot frame.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] William Hawkins (2008), describing his withdrawal from popular music and publication.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hawkins' original interests were as a poet, which he addressed in the summer of 1963, through attending an intensive writing course for aspiring poets offered by the English department of the University of British Columbia. The course became known as the Vancouver 1963 Poetry Conference, which took place over three weeks in July and August, and involved approximately sixty attendees. The course, designed by Warren Tallman and Robert Creeley, involved a juried assessment of a student's work, with invited faculty members including Allen Ginsberg, Charles Olson and Robert Duncan. Other attendees included Denise Levertov, Margaret Avison and Philip Whalen.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hawkins commenced publishing his poems in 1964, and enjoyed early success. Three of his poems were selected by A.J.M. Smith for inclusion in his prestigious 1967 anthology, Modern Canadian Verse. In addition, Hawkins became known for hosting and participating in poetry readings by major Canadian poets of the time, including Irving Layton, Leonard Cohen, Louis Dudek, Raymond Souster, Gwendolyn MacEwan, Jacques Godbout and John Robert Colombo.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1965, Hawkins commenced his music career as a member of The Children, a seminal Canadian band, based out of Ottawa. In addition to Hawkins, band members included Sneezy Waters, Sandy Crawley and Neville Wells and, in later versions, Bruce Cockburn, David Wiffen and Richard Patterson. The group had been formed at the encouragement of local impresario Harvey Glatt, who also became their manager. It was Glatt who first encouraged Hawkins to set his poems to music. The band developed a local prominence as resident performers at Le Hibou Coffee House, in which Glatt had an economic interest and which Hawkins and his then wife later managed. While they never released a record, within months of their formation The Children were playing Maple Leaf Gardens, in Toronto, as an opening act for The Lovin' Spoonful. It was this particular performance that caused Hawkins to decide to cease performing publicly. The band also opened for The Beach Boys in Ottawa, while successor bands performed Hawkins' songs at the 1968 electoral victory party for Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, as well as in the movie soundtrack for Christopher's Movie Matinee.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hawkins' music has been described as being \"timeless\" and associated with \"a beautiful melancholy\". He has been described as \"a writer of supremely melodic songs, filled with stark despair and raw self-loathing, mixed with dark humour.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hawkins' songs were popularized by David Wiffen, both as a member of 3's a Crowd and as a solo artist. His songs were also covered by other artists, such as Tom Rush, who recorded a version of \"Gnostic Serenade\" on his Wrong End of the Rainbow album (1970).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hawkins encountered increasing problems with substance abuse, particularly alcohol. After a period of time in the Donwood Institute in the early 1970s, for treatment for alcohol abuse, Hawkins largely withdrew from songwriting and published poetry. He opted instead to spend over thirty five years as a taxi driver in Ottawa, where he was ultimately sufficiently successful to be able to purchase his own \"plate\", or taxi license, rather than renting plate rights from others.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hawkins gradually returned to music and poetry. In 1997, with the assistance of Ottawa musician Victor Nesrallah as producer/ musical accompanyist, Hawkins independently released Dancing Alone. The album was a collection of Hawkins singing his own songs, plus versions of his songs as recorded by 3s a Crowd and The Esquires. The album was a precursor to the later tribute album to Hawkins, recorded and released in 2008.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Subsequent to the release of the 1997 Dancing Alone recording, Hawkins released a compendium of his poetry in 2005, as Dancing Alone: Selected Poems. In this publication, Hawkins collected poems contained in his five books published between 1964 and 1974, plus new poems. Shortly thereafter, in 2007, Hawkins published a small collection of new poems, the black prince of bank street.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2008, at the instigation of Harvey Glatt, who had first encouraged Hawkins over forty years earlier, Dancing Alone: Songs of William Hawkins, a two CD tribute album, was released on True North Records, in which various artists interpreted twenty-two of Hawkins' songs. The artists contributing to the tribute album included Bruce Cockburn, Sandy Crawley, Mike Evin, Terry Gillespie, Murray McLauchlan, Lynn Miles, Ana Miura, Bill Stevenson, Ian Tamblyn, Brent Titcomb, Suzie Vinnick, Sneezy Waters, Anne Davison and Neville Wells.

He began his music studies with his father, the teacher and organist David Adlung. While matriculating at the Erfurt Gymnasium (1713), he stayed with Christian Reichardt, who taught him organ. He then studied theology, philosophy, philology, and other subjects at the University of Jena (graduated, 1726), and concurrently received further training in organ from Johann Nikolaus Bach. From 1727 until his death he was organist of Erfurt's Prediger church. He also was a professpr of languages at the Erfurt Gymnasium, a teacher of organ, and builder of keyboard instruments. Adlung was an important writer on music theory and aesthetics. His valuable books are Anleitung zu der musikalischen Gelahrtheit (Erfurt, 1758; 2nd ed., rev, 1783, by J. Killer), Musica mechanica organoedi (ed. by J. Albrecht; Berlin, 1768), and Musikalisches Siebengestirn. Das ist: Sieben zu der edlen Tonkunst gehorige Fragen (ed. by J. Albrecht; Berlin, 1768). - Died at Erfurt, July 5,1762.\n\nin 1764 - Janos Lavotta, composer is born.\n\nin 1775 - William Crotch, eminent English organist, teacher, and composer, is born at Norwich. His extraordinary precocity may be measured by the well-authenticated statement (C. Burney, \"Account of an Infant Musician,\" Philosophical Transactions, 1779) that when two and a half years old he played on a small organ built by his father, a master carpenter. In Nov. 1778 he began to tour under his mother's guidance. On Jan. I, 1779, he played before the king and queen at Buckingham Palace. In 1786 he became assistant to Randall, organist of Trinity and King's colleges at Cambridge; at 14, he composed an oratorio, The Captivity of Judah (Cambridge, June 4, 1789); he then studied for the ministry (1788-90). Returning to music, he was made organist of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1790. He graduated from Oxford with a Mus.Bac. in 1794, and received a Mus.Doc. in 1799. In 1797 he succeeded Hayes as professor of music at Oxford and as organist of St. John's College. Crotch lectured in the Music School (1800-04), and in the Royal Institution in London (1804, 1805, 1807, and again from 1820). He was principal of the new Royal Academy of Music from 1822 to 1832. Crotch was most successful as a composer of oratorios and organ concertos. His finest work was the oratorio Palestine (London, April 21, 1812). His third oratorio, The Captivity of Judah (Oxford, June 10, 1834) should not be confused with his juvenile effort of the same title of 1789. Among his other works were five sonatas for Piano or Harpsichord; anthems: ten (1797-1803), ten (1798), and two (1825); odes; chants; Psalm tunes; hymn tunes; songs. He also brought out Specimens of Various Styles of Music (c. 1808-15) and various manuals, including Elements of Musical Composition (London, 1812; second ed., 1856). In addition, Crotch revealed talent as a painter. - Died at Taunton, Dec. 29, 1847.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1803 - William Jackson, referred to as Jackson of Exeter, was an English organist and composer, dies at 73.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Jackson was born and died in Exeter, England, the son of an Exeter grocer, who later became master of the city workhouse. After receiving some musical instruction from John Silvester, organist of Exeter Cathedral, Jackson was sent in 1748 to London, to become a pupil of John Travers, organist to the Chapel Royal.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1767 Jackson wrote the music for an adaptation of Milton's Lycidas, which was produced at Covent Garden on 4 November of the same year, on the occasion of the death of Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, brother to George III. While in London, he was a visitor at the meetings of the Madrigal Society.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On his return to Exeter Jackson devoted himself to teaching music until Michaelmas 1777, when he was appointed subchanter, organist, lay vicar, and master of choristers to the cathedral, in succession to Richard Langdon. Jackson's pupils included George Baker, William Bennet and John Davy.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Jackson composed the operas The Lord of the Manor (1780, libretto by John Burgoyne) and Metamorphoses (1783), as well as several odes (Warton's Ode to Fancy, Pope's The Dying Christian to His Soul, and Lycidas) and a large number of songs, canzonets, madrigals, pastorals, hymns, anthems, sonatas for harpsichord, and church services.

He championed the works of Bruckner, Strauss, Reger, Mahler, and Debussy. In his own compositions, he reflected post-Romantic tendencies. - Died at Zurich, June 18, 1962.\n\nin 1879 - Wanda (Alexandra) Landowska, celebrated Polish-born French harpsichordist, pianist, and pedagogue; is born at Warsaw. She was only 4 when she began to play the piano. Following lessons with KleczyI1ski, she continued her piano studies at the Warsaw Conservatory with Michalowski. In 1896 she went to Berlin and completed her formal training with Moszkowski (piano) and Urban (composition). In 1900 she went to Paris, where she married Henri Lew, an authority on Hebrew folklore. He encouraged her to pursue her interest in the study and performance of 17h-and 18th-century music. While she continued to appear as a pianist, from 1903 she gave increasing attention to playing the harpsichord in public and making it once again an accepted concert instrument. Her tours as a harpsichordist took her all over Europe. In 1913 she went to Berlin to teach harpsichord at the Hochschule fur Musik. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she and her husband were declared as civil prisoners on parole on account of their French citizenship. After the Armistice in 1918, Landowska went to Basel to give master classes in harpsichord at the Cons. in 1919. She then returned to Paris to teach at the Sorbonne and at the Ecole Normale de Musique. In 1923 she made her first appearances in the U.s. In 1925 she settled in St.-Leu-la-Foret, near Paris, where she founded the Ecole de Musique Ancienne for the study, teaching, and performance of early music. She also continued to tour abroad. With the Nazi occupation of Paris in 1940, Landowska fled France and eventually arrived in N.Y. in 1941. In 1947 she settled in Lakeville, Conn. She continued to be active as a performer and teacher during these years. In 1952 she celebrated her 75th birthday in a N.Y. recital. Landowska was the foremost champion of the 20th _ century movement to restore the harpsichord to concert settings. Her performance style was an assertive one highlighted by legato playing and variety of articulation. While she was best known for her interpretations of Bach, she also commissioned works from Falla (Harpsichord Concerto, Barcelona, Nov. 5, 1926), Poulenc (Concert champetre for Harpsichord and Small Orch., Paris, May 3,1929), and other composers.

David's other pop hits included 'It Must Be Him' (Vikki Carr) and 'Cherry Pink And Apple Blossom White' (Perez Prado). He also penned the lyrics to several television themes including Surfside 6, Caspar The Ghost and 77 Sunset Strip. He died in Rancho Mirage, California. (Natural causes). - Died December 30, 1993.\n\nin 1913 - Smiley Lewis, (OVERTON AMOS LEMONS) Louisiana, vocalist (I Hear You Knockin') is born. A gritty-voiced R&B singer who emerged in the mid Forties, Smiley Lewis had a distinctive, melodic, shouting delivery. Born in DeQuincy, Louisiana, Lewis ran away from home in his teens to work as a musician in New Orleans. There he joined The Thomas Jefferson Dixieland Band, a talented outfit that featured pianist Tuts Washington. A member of the band off and on for a decade, Lewis then formed a trio in 1945 with Tuts Washington and Herman Seale. A great stage performer but only an average guitarist, Lewis blended blues and R&B balladry, his vocals reminiscent of a rougher version of Louis Armstrong. Recording briefly at DeLuxe Records in 1947 as \"Smiling\" Lewis, he released just one single.\n\nThen signed as a solo artist with Imperial Records in 1950, Lewis was teamed with talented producer Dave Bartholomew. Determined to land on the national charts, Lewis finally broke through in 1952 with 'The Bells Are Ringing'; his hit run continued with: featuring Huey Smith on piano, 'I Hear You Knockin'' (1955); 'One Night (Of Sin)' (1956); and 'Please Listen To Me' (1956). Lewis was often compared to Imperial-labelmate Fats Domino and was said to have filled in for the popular singer on several recordings. Although 'I Hear You Knockin'' was an R&B hit for Lewis, the cover version by Gale Storm (1955) fared well on the pop charts; then in 1958 Elvis Presley recorded a sanitised version of Lewis' 'One Night (Of Sin)'. Leaving Imperial in 1960, Lewis recorded for several different labels in the Sixties, but never had another hit; at Loma Records, Lewis was produced by Allen Toussaint. 'I Hear You Knockin'' was reprised as a UK chart topping hit for Dave Edmunds in 1970. (Stomach cancer). He died at his New Orleans home a few days after undergoing an operation. - Died October 6, 1966.\n\nin 1918 - George Rochberg (US composer of contemporary classical music) is born.\n\nRochberg was born in Paterson, New Jersey. He attended the Mannes College of Music, where his teachers included George Szell and Hans Weisse, and the Curtis Institute of Music, where he studied with Rosario Scalero and Gian Carlo Menotti. He served in the United States Army in the infantry during World War II.\n\nHe was the chairman of the music department at the University of Pennsylvania until 1968, and continued to teach there until 1983. In 1978, he was named the first Annenberg Professor of the Humanities. His notable students include Stephen Albert, Gaston Allaire, Maria Bachmann, William Bolcom, Uri Caine, Robert Carl, Daniel Dorff, Stephen Jaffe, Cynthia Cozette Lee, Yen Lu, Vincent McDermott, Michael Alec Rose, Robert Suderburg, and Maryanne Amacher.\n\nHe married Gene Rosenfeld in 1941, and had two children, Paul and Francesca. In 1964, his son died of a brain tumor.\n\nHe died in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 2005, aged 86. Most of his works are held in the archive of the Paul Sacher Foundation in Basel, Switzerland. Some can also be found in the Music Division of the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City, New York, the University of Pennsylvania, Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, and the City University of New York.\n\nAfter a long period of composition using the technique of serialism, Rochberg finally abandoned it upon the death of his teenage son in 1964, saying that serialism was empty of expressive emotion and was inadequate to express his grief and rage. By the seventies he had become controversial for the use of tonal passages in his music. His use of tonality first became widely known through the String Quartet No. 3 (1972), which includes an entire set of variations that are in the style of late Beethoven. Another movement of the quartet contains passages reminiscent of the music of Gustav Mahler. This use of tonality caused critics to classify him as a neoromantic composer. He compared atonality to abstract art and tonality to concrete art and compared his artistic evolution with Philip Guston's, saying \"the tension between concreteness and abstraction\" is a fundamental issue for both of them (Rochberg, 1992). His music has also been described as neoconservative postmodernism (Brackett 2008, xviii).\n\nOf the works composed early in his career, the Symphony No. 2 (1955–56) stands out as an accomplished serial composition by an American composer. Rochberg is perhaps best known for his String Quartets Nos. 3-6 (1972–78). Rochberg conceived Nos. 4-6 as a set and named them the \"Concord Quartets\" after the Concord String Quartet, which premiered and recorded the works. The String Quartet No. 6 includes a set of variations on the Pachelbel Canon in D.\n\nA few of his works were musical collages of quotations from other composers. \"Contra Mortem et Tempus\", for example, contains passages from Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Edgard Varèse and Charles Ives.\n\nSymphonies Nos. 1, 2, and 5, and the Violin Concerto were recorded in 2001–2002 by the Saarbrücken Radio Symphony Orchestra and conductor Christopher Lyndon Gee and released on the Naxos label.\n\nMarc-Antonio Barone said of Rochberg, \"He brought the same rigor, the same intensity, the same craftsmanship to his work in the most conservative sounding tonal idioms as he did to his most ultramodern, 12-tone composing. It was all about what in the human condition he was trying to express.\". James Freeman, musician and teacher at Swarthmore College, said this about Rochberg and Serialism, \"If George Rochberg can do something like that, there's nothing that I can't do and get away with it. I don't have to write 12-tone music; I can if I want to. I can write stuff that sounds like Brahms. I can do anything I want. I'm free. And that was an extraordinary feeling in the late '60s for young composers, I think, many of whom felt really constrained to write serial music.\"\n\nRochberg's collected essays were published by the University of Michigan Press in 1984 as The Aesthetics of Survival. A revised and expanded edition (Rochberg, 2005), published shortly before his death, was awarded an ASCAP Deems Taylor Award in 2006. Selections from his correspondence with Canadian composer István Anhalt were published in 2007 by Wilfrid Laurier University Press (Gillmor, 2007). His memoirs, Five Lines, Four Spaces, were published by the University of Illinois Press in May 2009 (Rochberg, 2009).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1920 - Issachar Miron, composer is born.\n\nin 1924 - Janos Starker, Budapest Hungary, cellist (Chic Symph 1953-58) is born.\n\nin 1924 - Oskar Czerwenka, Austrian bass, is born at Vocklabruck bei Linz.

His father, Carl Christian Jensen, was a civil servant and the family were keen amateur musicians. Borgstrøm showed an early aptitude for music and by the age of fifteen was a talented violinist. After studying composition and music theory in Oslo with Johan Svendsen and Ludvig Mathias Lindeman, he went to the Leipzig Conservatory in Germany for two years. On his return to Norway in 1889, he worked as a music critic for several newspapers and successfully premiered his cantata, Hvæm er du med de tusene navne (Who are you with a thousand names). However, in 1890, he left Norway and was to live for the next thirteen years in Leipzig and Berlin, where he became a friend of the Italian composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni whose musical philosophy he shared.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Borgstrøm returned to Norway in 1903, the year in which his symphonic poem for piano and orchestra, Hamlet, premiered to great acclaim in Oslo. The soloist at the premiere was the pianist Amalie Müller. Borgstrøm and Müller married the following year and she was to become a champion of his works. The period between 1903 and Amalie's death in 1913 marked Borgstrøm's most intense period of composition. Although, he is primarily known for his symphonic works, written in a late Romantic style with influences of Expressionism, he also composed 45 songs, most notably \"Svalerne\" (The Swallows), \"Rød valmue\" (Red Poppy), and \"Frossen skog\" (Frozen Forest), as well as two operas, neither of which was performed in his lifetime. He also became a highly regarded music critic, writing for Verdens Gang from 1903 to 1913 and Aftenposten from 1913 to 1925.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Borgstrøm died in Oslo in on 5 July 1925 at the age of 61. His works were regularly performed until World War II, and were then largely ignored. However, the 21st century saw a resurgence of interest in him.

She assisted Alan Lomax on several field trips in England during the 1950s, and in the U.S. in 1959 and Lomax produced her first album, also in 1959. She then paired with her sister, Dolly, who played Renaissance music on original instruments; Dolly's unique arrangements of traditional ballads and songs combined them with her own work on early organs. In 1970 Shirley wed British folk-rocker ASHLEY HUTCHINGS, who produced her 1971 album, [/FONT][FONT=&quot]No Roses, [/FONT][FONT=&quot]her first to feature electric instruments.

After a spell in Paris, he returned to Berlin in 1898 to study counterpoint with Xaver Scharwenka.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The performance of his composition Das trunkene Lied (\"The Drunken Song\") for chorus and orchestra brought Fried his first public success and led to his appointment in 1904 as the conductor of a Berlin choral society.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Fried first met Gustav Mahler in 1905. The meeting resulted in an invitation to conduct Mahler's \"Resurrection\" Symphony in Berlin in November 1905 (Otto Klemperer led the offstage band during this performance). The next year, he introduced Russia to Mahler's music when he performed the same work in St Petersburg. From 1907 to 1910, he directed a choral society known as the Sternscher Gesangverein in Berlin. In 1913 Fried conducted the Berlin Philharmonic in the second performance of Mahler's Ninth Symphony.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1922, he went to the USSR as the first foreign conductor invited to perform after the Russian Revolution, and was greeted by Lenin on the station platform. In 1924, he made the first recording of any Mahler symphony, the Second, with the Berlin Staatskapelle in a performance that has been praised as \"remarkably successful\" and a \"highly adventurous undertaking for an acoustic recording\" which required \"careful planning and experimentation\". That same year, he also made the first recording of any complete Bruckner symphony: his Seventh.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In November 1927, at the invitation of the BBC programme planner and his own former student Edward Clark, he made his British conducting debut, in a program of Weber, Brahms and Liszt in London.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Driven from Germany by the anti-Semitism of the Nazi regime in 1934, he emigrated to the Georgian city of Tbilisi in the Soviet Union.

Originally formed in Los Angeles in 1958 as The Emeralds, the group replaced a number of its members in 1959 before becoming The Echoes; initially being hired by Herb Albert to provide backing vocals at Andex Records. Signing with Indigo Records, the renamed Innocents scored their first hit with 'Honest I Do' followed by, after appearing on American Bandstand, 'Gee Whiz'. Meanwhile, 1958 14-year-old vocalist Kathy Young had scheduled a session at the same studio used by The Innocents. When the producer was unimpressed with her remake of The Rivileers' 'A Thousand Stars', he asked The Innocents to provide backing vocals. The resulting session produced a million-selling single, which was followed by the stylistically similar 'Happy Birthday Blues', but their hits dried up after The Innocents moved to Warner-Reprise Records. In the spring of 1966, Stankey and two former members of The Innocents launched their own label, Sugar Beats Records.

He studied in Bern, Zurich, Darmstadt, Salzburg, and Paris, his principal composition teachers being Rivier and Boulez. He was first oboist of the Salzburg Mozarteum Orchestra (1965-69), and then was asst. conductor to Stokowski with the American Symphony Orchestra of N.Y. (1970-71). He received the first George Szell Memorial Award, joining the conducting staff of the Cleveland Orchestra in 1971. From 1977 to 1983 he was music director of the Swiss Radio Orchestra in Basel, and then was principal guest conductor of the Scottish National Orchestra in Glasgow (1985-90). From 1992 to 1998 he was artistic director of the Lucerne Music Festival, and from 1993 to 2000 he was music director of the London Mozart Players.\n\nin 1943 - Robbie Robertson (Canadian guitar, vocals; The Band) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1944 - William Gillies Whittaker, English composer, pedagogue, conductor, musicologist, Bach scholar, publisher and writer, dies at 67.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He spent his life promoting music. The University of Durham, where he once studied and taught, called him one of \"Britain's most influential musicians during the first half of the twentieth century\". An autodidact, he was a prodigious creator of Gebrauchsmusik.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Whittaker was born into a Methodist family in the Shieldfield district of Newcastle upon Tyne. His father, John Whittaker, the illegitimate son of a farm labourer's daughter, came from Little Corby in Cumberland. His mother, Ellen Gillies, was an orphan from a respected family in Hexham in Northumberland. From an early age Whittaker showed an interest in music: he learnt to play the flute and his father bought him a piccolo; and he played as a schoolboy organist at St George's Presbyterian Church in Jesmond. His father encouraged him to follow a career in science, which led to Whittaker initially studying mathematics—without great success—at Armstrong College, at that time part of the University of Durham (it later formed the nucleus of the present-day University of Newcastle upon Tyne). Subsequently, he resumed organ and singing lessons, obtaining performing and teaching qualifications from the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music; and, from 1898, he commenced studies in musicology at the University of Durham. After graduating he continued at Armstrong College; he had successive appointments as instructor, lecturer and reader in music; and he embarked on a doctorate in 1902, submitting a dissertation in 1909, although he had to wait until 1921 for the degree to be awarded. He also worked as a music master at two of the main .....' schools in Newcastle, teaching singing at the Central Newcastle High School in Jesmond and Rutherford .....' School at Rye Hill (which opened in 1907 in former buildings of the Royal Grammar School). In 1903 Whittaker married Clara Watkins, an amateur musician from Gateshead and the daughter of a South Shields ship owner. Together they had two daughters, Clarrie and Mary, brought up as strict vegetarians with an equally strict regime of pre-breakfast instrumental practise on the cello and the violin.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Whittaker conducted several choirs on Tyneside, working with the Newcastle Choral Union, Newcastle Bach Choir, the Whitley Bay Choral Society, the Tynemouth Choral Society and the Gateshead Choral Union. With these ensembles, he achieved excellent results. He also knew many composers of the period, with Gustav Holst amongst his friends; and he met Maurice Ravel on a visit to Newcastle, during which Ravel accompanied his newly composed song cycle Histoires Naturelles and attended a rehearsal of his own string quartet. Whittaker's mentor Charles Sanford Terry, who was at the University of Durham before taking up a post at the University of Aberdeen, encouraged Whittaker's enthusiasm for J.S. Bach, particularly his choral music. Whittaker performed all of Bach's cantatas during his career. He founded the Newcastle Bach Choir in 1915, based in Newcastle Cathedral. One of the members of the choir, Basil Bunting, recalled that he was \"not only learned but also showed [a] great sense of music and art in general\". With the Newcastle Bach Choir, he made a concert tour to London and participated in a three-day festival in 1922. He performed the first complete version of the Great English Service of William Byrd in Newcastle upon Tyne, and performed it again at St. Margaret's Church in Westminster in 1924. From 1925 onwards he served on three musical advisory committees of the BBC.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1929, finding musical opportunities in the North East of England too restrictive, Whittaker moved to Glasgow, where he took up a newly endowed joint position as Principal of the Scottish National Academy of Music (RSAMD) (1929–1941) and Gardiner Professor of Music at the University of Glasgow (1929–1941). In making the move, Whittaker left his wife Clara, who subsequently moved to London to join their daughter Mary. Whittaker himself was accompanied North of the border by his former student Annie Lawton, with whom he set up house. Once installed in Scotland, he received an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow and an honorary doctorate from the University of Edinburgh, where his friend Donald Tovey was professor of music. Tovey, a member of the governing board of the Academy, wrote to Whittaker that he hoped the award might be \"of some slight value for strengthening your hand for a task that you cannot execute without overcoming some opposition.\" The task was to transform what had previously been the Athenaeum School into a musical academy similar to the colleges in London; but despite, grants from the local benefactor Daniel Macaulay Stevenson, there were insufficient funds to finance musical scholarships, attract teachers, build up a library and hold concerts. Whittaker was disappointed by musical life in Glasgow, which he later stated to be \"even more provincial\" than in Newcastle. He was frustrated that his attempts to improve matters were constantly opposed by governors during his tenure as Principal: it was \"a heart-breaking struggle against impossible odds.\" [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Despite the difficulties he encountered, Whittaker nevertheless found a kindred spirit and friend in the main professor of pianoforte Philip Halstead, whom he described as a \"splendid all-round musician\"; and was given unpaid support by Harold Thomson, a former student at the Academy who became a close friend. Assisted by them and others, he succeeded in setting up a three-year Diploma course. Somewhat unexpectedly he also discovered that the local Glasgow Bach Choir had performed very few of Bach's cantatas; they willingly agreed to become part of Whittaker's new Bach Cantata Choir which performed in Stevenson Hall, the newly built concert hall of the Academy. As a result, Whittaker was able to realise his lifelong ambition of performing all of Bach's cantatas: he performed one third of them in Newcastle and the remaining two thirds in Glasgow. He later described his activities with the Bach Cantata Choir as the \"chief joy\" of his period in Glasgow. Other activities in the concert hall included \"Opera Week\" for operas, oratorios and incidental music, including works of Purcell, Handel, Bach, Gluck, Mozart and Schubert; some governors of the Academy attempted unsuccessfully to have these performances stopped as \"profligate\", their preference being for Gilbert and Sullivan and Offenbach. Whittaker succeeded in raising funds from the Carnegie Foundation for a library, now the Whittaker Library in the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland; and also set up a museum of ancient instruments in the Academy and an archive of musical manuscripts, now the Whittaker Collection, in the university.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Whittaker had briefly resigned from the Academy in 1938, when, on returning from a trip to Sweden, he discovered that the governors had reversed some of his decisions during his absence. When it transpired that the Academy could not run smoothly without him, he acceded to a request from the Vice Chancellor of the University to return to his post. On his retirement in 1941, he was made an emeritus professor in the university. Despite ill health, he agreed to join ENSA, under the leadership of Walter Legge and Basil Dean, to help in the running of wartime classical music events. This involved giving lectures around the country, organising concerts, adjudicating competitions and preparing boxes of records for concerts. On a trip to act as judge at a Services Festival in the Orkney Islands in July 1944, he died of heart failure in his sleep. In his will he bequeathed a copy of a bronze sculpture that Jacob Epstein had made of him in 1942 to King's College in Newcastle.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Whittaker's main expertise as performer and scholar lay in the cantatas of J.S.Bach. Whittaker's book on the subject was published posthumously by Oxford University Press in 1959 in two volumes, which Harold Thompson prepared for publication from a typed draft. In a later edition of 1978 an appendix was added to correct chronological details which only became known in the 1950s. Whittaker also promoted musicians like Gustav Holst, Vaughan Williams, Debussy, Satie, and Poulenc. In addition to Bach scholarship, he acted as a publisher and editor of music from the 17th and 18th centuries. Among his works are A Lykewake Dirge and The Celestial Sphere for Chorus and Orchestra, Psalm CXXXIX and Among the Northumbrian Hills. He also had a strong interest in folk music from his native Tyneside and Northumberland, championing the Northumbrian smallpipes; he published arrangements of folk songs, including choral versions of the \"Keel Row\", \"Bobby Shaftoe\", \"Blow the Wind Southerly\" and \"Water of Tyne\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]5 July[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 1 of 3[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]5 July[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 2 of 3[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1945 - ....

American songwriter, pianist, and composer of a number of popular and ragtime tunes from the early 20th century. Born in Marengo, Illinois, he moved to New York City after some time touring in Vaudeville. He worked as a Tin Pan Alley song-plugger until he was able to make his living as a songwriter. He teamed with lyricist Harry H. Williams, their first success was \"Navajo\" which was introduced in the Broadway musical Nancy Brown in 1903 and became one of the first records by Billy Murray early in 1904. Their best remembered song is ''In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree'' from 1905. Other of his hits included \"Won't You Come Over to My House?\", \"I'm Afraid to Come Home in the Dark\", and \"Memories\". He shares credit with Tony Jackson on the hit \"Pretty Baby\".\n\nin 1952 - Kristine Ciesinski, American soprano, sister of Katherine Ciesinski, is born at Wilmington, Del.

She made her N.Y. concert debut as a soloist in Handel's Messiah (1977) and her European operatic debut as Baroness Freimann in Lortzing's Der Wildschiitz at the Salzburg Landestheater (1979), remaining on its roster until 1981; was subsequently a member of the Bremen State Opera (1985-88).

In 1996 she appeared as Salome at the English National Opera. She also sang extensively in concerts, often appearing with her sister. Her finest roles include Iphigenie, Medea, Beethoven's Leonora, Cassandra, La Wally, Eva, Elisabeth in Tannhauser, Chrysothemis, Ariadne, Salome, and Tosca. She married Norman Bailey in 1985.\n\nin 1952 - Michael Don McNabb, composer is born.\n\nin 1954 - Presley's first release on Sun Records.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In an era when most records were made quickly and within tightly controlled session timeframes, Sam Phillips was an early proponent of keeping the tape rolling and allowing the musicians to experiment. Since Phillips owned the studio, Sun artists had the luxury of recording in informal, openended sessions, minus the usual deadline pressures. That method would play a key role in the development of Elvis's musical persona. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On July 5, Presley, Moore, Black, and Phillips gathered at Sun to cut some tracks, including a hopped-up version of the Bill Monroe bluegrass standard \"Blue Moon of Kentucky.\" After they'd spent several hours running through various material with unsatisfying results, Elvis spontaneously broke into \"That's All Right, Mama,\" a 1946 number by Mississippi bluesman Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup. As the legend goes, Moore and Black picked up the accelerated tempo, Phillips got the tape rolling, and the rest is history. It's fair to say that no one had ever heard anything like \"That's All Right, Mama\" before. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The combination of Elvis's playful, forceful vocal, Moore and Black's spare, fi ery support, and Sun's trademark slapback echo combined to create a sound that was completely new. As spirited as the performances were, the tape-delay echo that Phillips used on \"That's All Right, Mama\" was equally integral to the track's appeal. Thereafter, echo would become a key component in the sound of early rock and roll. Phillips loved the track's manic energy, but when Sun released Presley's debut single two weeks later, \"That's All Right, Mama\" (listed on the label as \"That's All Right\") was initially relegated to the B-side. The designated A-side was \"Blue Moon of Kentucky,\" but it was the fl ip that would put Elvis—and rock and roll—on the map. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A couple of nights after \"That's All Right, Mama\" session, Sam brought a test pressing of the single to his friend Dewey Phillips (no relation), a manic white disc jockey who spun black rhythm and blues platters on his show Red Hot and Blue on local station WHBQ. The show was broadcast from the station's headquarters at the Chisca Hotel in downtown Memphis, and maintained a large biracial audience. The motor-mouthed DJ played \"That's All Right, Mama\" several times in a row, and the station's switchboard was reportedly fl ooded with requests to hear it again. Dewey phoned the Presley home to get Elvis to the station for his fi rst-ever live interview. By the end of the week, Sun had advance orders of 7,000.

She also gave the first European performances of his Suor Angelica and Gianni Schicchi, at Rome in 1919. She also created roles in Pietro Mascagni's Il piccolo Marat and Riccardo Zandonai's Giulietta e Romeo. She was also an important interpreter of that composer's Francesca da Rimini. She also appeared at the Teatro Colón (including Manon Lescaut opposite Aureliano Pertile) and Covent Garden, and was a favorite at Monte Carlo and the Teatro alla Scala. One of Dalla Rizza's unexpected successes at the latter theatre was in La traviata, under the bâton of Arturo Toscanini.

His father was a church organist and piano tuner who was blind since childhood. His mother was, in Potter's own words, \"a raging alcoholic\". The young Potter escaped a rather grim childhood when he went to live with an aunt in Kent, England.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Possessed of a good voice and natural musical ability, Potter was accepted as a treble by the world-famous choir of All Saints, Margaret Street. In 1933, after four years as a chorister, he was sent to Clifton College, Bristol. From there he went to the Royal College of Music on a scholarship and studied composition under Vaughan Williams. While at the Royal College he won the Cobbett prize for chamber music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]World War II interrupted Potter's music education, and he left college to serve with the London Irish Rifles in Europe and the Far East. After the war Potter settled in Dublin, where he continued his studies at Trinity College, Dublin, gaining a Doctorate in Music in 1953.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Potter had already started composing chamber and vocal music before the war. Now, established in Dublin, he chose the orchestra as his principal means of expression. His early pieces, such as Rhapsody under a High Sky and Overture to a Kitchen Comedy, showed that Potter had absorbed Vaughan Williams' pastoral style and his love of folk music. In 1952, both pieces were awarded Radio Éireann's \"Carolan Prize\" for orchestral composition by the adjudicator Arnold Bax. A year later Potter repeated this success when his Concerto da Chiesa, a concerto for piano and orchestra, also won the Carolan Prize.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1955 Potter was appointed Professor of Composition at the Royal Irish Academy of Music, where he became an effective administrator and inspiring teacher.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the 1960s, Potter turned to ballet, writing four orchestral scores for the Cork Ballet company. The first of these, Careless Love, became the composer's own favourite of all his compositions. Several years later, following a successful battle with alcoholism, he wrote what some regard as his magnum opus, Sinfonia \"de Profundis\" (1969). The première was given at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin on 23 March 1969 in a performance by the RTÉ Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Albert Rosen.

An American musician who is best known as a trumpet playing band leader who led a big band from 1939 to 1946. He broke up his band for a short period in 1947 but shortly after he re-organized and was active again with his band from then until his death in 1983. He was especially known among musicians for his astonishing technical proficiency as well as his superior tone, and was extremely influential on up and coming trumpet players from the late 1930s into the 1940s. He was also an actor in a number of motion pictures that usually featured his bands in some way.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Harry James was born in Albany, Georgia, the son of Myrtle Maybelle (Stewart), an acrobat and horseback rider, and Everett Robert James, a bandleader in a traveling circus, the Mighty Haag Circus. According to the Bill Sterns Sports Newsreel broadcast on September 12, 1942, on which James appeared, he was saved from being trampled, at the age of 6, by his mother's horse after performing with the horse. By the age of 10 he was taking trumpet lessons from his father, who placed him on a strict daily practice schedule. Each day, James was given one page to learn from the Arban's book and was not allowed to pursue any other pastime until he had learned that particular page.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1924, his family settled in Beaumont, Texas. It was here in the early 1930s that James began playing in local dance bands when just 15 years of age. James played regularly with Herman Waldman's band, and at one performance was noticed by nationally popular Ben Pollack. In 1935 he joined Pollack's band, but at the start of 1937 left to join Benny Goodman's orchestra, where he stayed through 1938. He was nicknamed \"The Hawk\" early in his career for his ability to sight-read. A common joke was that if a fly landed on his written music, Harry James would play it. His low range had a warmth associated with the cornet and even the flugelhorn, but this sound was underrecorded in favor of James' brilliant high register.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]With financial backing from Goodman, in January 1939 James debuted his own big band in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but it didn't click until 1941 when he added a string section. This big band became known as Harry James and His Music Makers. His hit \"You Made Me Love You\" was in the Top 10 during the week of December 7, 1941. He and his band were featured in three films, Private Buckaroo, Two ..... and a Sailor and Springtime in the Rockies. He toured with the band into the 1980s, and to this day the Harry James Orchestra still exists, now led by Fred Radke.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His was the first \"name band\" to employ vocalist Frank Sinatra, in 1939, for $75 a week. James signed Sinatra to a one-year contract, of which Sinatra worked seven months before leaving to sing for Tommy Dorsey. He wanted to change Sinatra's name to 'Frankie Satin' but Sinatra refused. His later band included drummer Buddy Rich. His featured vocalist was Helen Forrest. Johnny MacAfee was featured on the sax and vocals and Corky Corcoran was a youthful sax prodigy.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His orchestra succeeded Glenn Miller's on a program sponsored by Chesterfield Cigarettes in 1942, when Miller disbanded his orchestra to enter the Army. In 1945, James and his orchestra had a summer replacement program for Danny Kaye's program on CBS. He also led the orchestra for Call for Music, which was broadcast on CBS February 13, 1948 - April 16, 1948, and on NBC April 20, 1948 - June 29, 1948.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He played trumpet in the 1950 film Young Man with a Horn, dubbing Kirk Douglas. In the album from that movie, he backed Doris Day and the album charted at #1. James's recording of \"I'm Beginning to See the Light\" appears in the motion picture My Dog Skip (2000). His music is also featured in the Woody Allen film Hannah and Her Sisters. James recorded many popular records and appeared in many Hollywood movies.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]With James's childhood spent as a musician in a traveling circus, he picked up a flamboyant style that utilized such techniques as heavy vibrato, half valve and lip glissandi, valve and lip trills, and valve tremolos. These techniques were popular at the time in what some have called a \"hot\" jazz style, with James's idol Louis Armstrong providing an example of one who used these techniques, but they later fell out of favor in the 1950s with the advent of \"cool\" jazz. James's father instituted a rigorous regime of practice for James as a child, and this allowed James to achieve an exceptional technical proficiency in the more classical techniques of range, fingering and tonguing. Growing up in the south, James was also exposed to blues music, which had an influence on his style. As James explained, \"I was brought up in Texas with the blues – when I was eleven or twelve years old down in what they call 'barbecue row' I used to sit in with the guys that had the broken bottlenecks on their guitars, playing the blues; that's all we knew.\"[16] Louis Armstrong, after hearing Harry James solo on several numbers while at a Benny Goodman one-nighter with his friend Lionel Hampton, exclaimed to Hampton in the vernacular of the time, \"That white boy – he plays like a jig!\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After James left Benny Goodman's band in 1939 to form his own band, he soon found that leading a commercially viable musical group required a broader set of skills than those needed to be a gifted musician playing in someone else's band. The James band ran into financial trouble, and it became increasingly difficult for James to make payroll and keep the band together. In 1940, James lost his contract with Columbia Records (he returned in 1941), and Frank Sinatra left the band that January. It was not long after this that James made a pivotal decision: he would adopt a \"sweeter\" style that added strings to the band, and the band would deliver tunes that were in more of a \"pop\" vein and less true to its jazz roots. From a commercial standpoint, the decision paid off — James soon enjoyed a string of chart topping hits that provided commercial success for him and his band. Indeed, a U.S. Treasury report released in 1945 listed Harry James and Betty Grable as the highest-paid couple in the nation.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]What worked well commercially with the public, however, had the opposite effect on those in the circle of jazz critics. Dan Morgenstern, the respected critic and Director of the Institute of Jazz Studies, called the 1941 release of \"You Made Me Love You\" \"the record that the jazz critics never forgave Harry James for recording.\" With James continuing to employ his \"hot\" jazz style on pop hits through the 1940s, his playing was often labeled as \"schmaltzy\" and dismissed by the critics, though radio discs from this period reveal James's continued commitment to jazz. A variety of modern arrangements from Neal Hefti, Frank Devenport, Johnny Richards and Jimmy Mundy often inspired his musicians, and as bop surpassed swing by the late 1940s, James was surprisingly open to its influence.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After coasting through the mid-1950s, James made a complete reevaluation of where he was heading in his musical career. Count Basie provided the impetus by making a significant comeback with his newly formed \"16 Men Swinging\" band, and James wanted a band with a decided Basie flavor. James signed with Capitol Records in 1955, and two years later, after releasing new studio versions of many of his previously released songs from Columbia, James recorded ten new tracks for an album entitled Wild About Harry!. This album was the first in a series released on Capitol, and continuing later on MGM, representative of the Basie style that James adopted during this period, with some of the arrangements provided by former Basie saxophonist and arranger Ernie Wilkins, whom James hired for his own band.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Even after his return to more jazz-oriented releases in the late 1950s and into the 1960s, James never completely regained favor with the jazz critics during his lifetime. More recent reissues, however, such as Capitol's 7-disc set The Capitol Vaults Jazz Series: Gene Krupa and Harry James in 2012, have prompted new, more favorable analyses of James's work. In 2014, Marc Myers of JazzWax commented, \"[James's] band of the mid-1940s was more modern than most of the majors, and in 1949 he led one of the finest bands of the year.\" And on James's releases from 1958–1961, Myers noted, \"The James band during this period has been eclipsed by bands led by Basie, Maynard Ferguson and Stan Kenton. While each served up its own brand of magnificence, James produced more consistently brilliant tracks than the others... virtually everything James recorded during this period was an uncompromising, swinging gem.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]While in London, Harry James did an interview with the English jazz critic Steve Voce. When Voce asked him if the biggest audience was for the commercial numbers he had recorded, he visibly bristled. James answered, \"That would depend on for whom you are playing. If you're playing for a jazz audience, I'm pretty sure that some of the jazz things we do would be a lot more popular than 'Sleepy Lagoon,' and if we're playing at a country club or playing Vegas, in which we have many, many types of people, then I'm sure that 'Sleepy Lagoon' would be more popular at that particular time. But I really get bugged about these people talking about commercial tunes, because to me, if you're gonna be commercial, you're gonna stand on your head and make funny noises and do idiotic things. I don't think we've ever recorded or played one tune that I didn't particularly love to play. Otherwise, I wouldn't play it.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]James was married three times. He married singer Louise Tobin on May 4, 1935, and they had two children. They divorced in 1943. That same year, he married actress Betty Grable. They had two daughters, Victoria Elizabeth (b. 1944) and Jessica (b. 1947), before divorcing in 1965. James married a third time on December 27, 1967, to Las Vegas showgirl Joan Boyd, whom he would divorce in March 1970. Contrary to some assertions, he did not marry a fourth time. He had five children (two by Tobin, two by Grable, one by Boyd) and (as of his death) 16 grandchildren.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]James owned several thoroughbred racehorses that won races such as the California Breeders' Champion Stakes (1951) and the San Vicente Stakes (1954). He was also a founding investor in the Atlantic City Race Course. His knowledge of horse racing was demonstrated during a 1958 appearance on The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour entitled \"Lucy Wins A Racehorse\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1983, James, a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer, but he continued to work, playing his last professional job on June 26, 1983, in Los Angeles, just nine days before his death in Las Vegas, Nevada. The job had become his final performance with the Harry James Orchestra. He died exactly 40 years after his marriage to Betty Grable (July 5, 1943), who was buried exactly 30 years after that date (July 5, 1973). Frank Sinatra gave the eulogy at his funeral, held in Las Vegas.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1983 - Vaclav Trojan, Czech composer of classical music best known for his film scores, dies at 76.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Trojan studied composition at the Prague Conservatory under Jaroslav Křička and Otakar Ostrčil from 1923 to 1927. He continued his studies in the composition masterclasses of Alois Hába, Josef Suk and Vítězslav Novák until 1929. A composer and arranger of dance and jazz music in the 1930s, he was a music director for Radio Prague from 1937 to 1945. After the end of World War II, Trojan composed most frequently for film, stage and radio, and developed a close association with director Jiří Trnka, earning international fame for his music for Trnka's popular animated puppet films. Trojan's music is mostly written in a neo-classical style, and he often drew inspiration from the traditions of Czech folk music. In 1940 he was given the Czech National Prize for his remarkable children's opera Kolotoč ('The Merry-Go-Round'), and in 1960 the K. Gottwald State Prize for his music for Sen noci svatojánské ('A Midsummer Night's Dream').[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1984 - Yu Yamada (Japanese Ryukyuan model, actress, singer) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1984 - The Everly Brothers launch their first tour together in eleven years, in Cincinnati.\n\nin 1985 - Stephanie McIntosh (Australian pop singer, actress) is born.\n\nin 1985 - Nick O'Malley (UK bassist; Arctic Monkeys) is born.\n\nin 1986 - Billy Ocean went to No.1 on the US singles chart with 'There'll Be Sad Songs, (To Make You Cry)' a No.12 hit in the UK.\n\nin 1986 - Janet Jackson started a two-week run at No.1 on the US album chart with 'Control'.\n\nin 1986 - Tracy Pew died. The outspoken, leather-clad, hard-drinking bassist of the Australian alternative rock band The Birthday Party, Tracy Pew joined several art school dropouts in Melbourne including Nick Cave in The Boys Next Door, a predecessor of the group in 1977. Relocating to London in 1980, The Birthday Party gained an underground cult following with their two album releases, Prayers On Fire and Junkyard. Imprisoned for drunk-driving in late 1981, Pew was temporarily replaced in the band. Moving to Berlin, The Birthday Party released a pair of unnoticed EPs, before disbanding in 1983. Pew subsequently joined The Saints. Cave later pursued a solo career before forming The Bad Seeds. Suffering an epileptic seizure while in a bathtub, he died from head injuries. - Born December 7, 1957.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1989 - Ernesto Halffter, Spanish composer and conductor, dies at 84.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was the brother of Rodolfo Halffter and part of the Grupo de los Ocho (English: Group of Eight), which formed a sub-set of the Generation of '27.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ernesto Halffter was the third son of Prussian jeweller Ernest Halffter Hein and his wife Rosario Escriche Erradón.
