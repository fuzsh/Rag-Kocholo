        "text": "Points of Interest\n\nIn Venosa, every historical period is represented by direct evidence of great value, starting with those present in the Paleolithic park of Notarchirico, where fossil remains of ancient elephants and other prehistoric animals, dating back to 700,000 years ago , lie buried by the ashes of the Vulture, the nearby extinct volcano.\n\nThe excavations of the Roman age, with the domus, the baths and the amphitheater with its gladiatorial school, recall the ancient and rich Venusia, a Latin colony, home of the poet Quinto Orazio Flacco, a rich and dynamic Roman commercial hub crossed by the Regina Viarum , Via Appia. A few kilometers from the town, you can admire the Jewish catacombs, an extraordinary example of coexistence and integration between cultures, a burial place where Christians and Jews rested next to each other. The early Christian period is well testified by the first cathedral, whose remains are still visible in the archaeological park. The Middle Ages can be perceived in the solemn and timeless art of the Benedictine abbey of the Holy Trinity and in the evocative Incompiuta, a church never completed, in which the great past of the colony resurfaces in the reuse of worked stones of the classical age, inserted among its walls. In the current cathedral, located in the center of the city and in a series of noble and ecclesiastical buildings, there is great architectural and artistic refinement. Then many illustrious personalities protagonists of important historical events, writers, artists. Roberto il Guiscardo is buried in Venosa with his brothers and his first wife Aberada; King Manfredi, natural son of Frederico II and Bianca Lancia was born in Venosa. Prince Carlo Gesualdo, famous throughout Europe, was born in the Aragonese Castle, built by Pirro del Balzo.\n\nToday the historic center of Venosa, one of The Most Beautiful Villages in Italy, keeps over two thousand years of history along its streets. A real open-air museum in which two distinct museum offerings are also integrated: the National Archaeological Museum “Mario Torelli” housed in the long basement walkway of the Pirro del Balzo castle, and the Episcopal Museum which is located next to the Co-Cathedral of Sant’Andrea Apostolo. The first tells the story of the city of Venosa and its territory, from the foundation of the Latin colony in 291 BC. to the explosion of the Renaissance city, expressed by the construction of the castle in 1470. The new Museum itinerary makes use of a narrative system that uses interactive technological solutions and multimedia supports. The second is set up in the rooms of the ancient Episcopio. The exhibition rooms are spread over two floors and contain a precious and varied heritage inside. From pictorial works, such as the valuable icon of the Madonna dell’Idria of the thirteenth century, to sculptural ones, from silverware to splendid textile artefacts, to stone finds, it will allow the visitor a historical-artistic excursus of considerable importance.\n\nOverview\n\nThe town of Bagnoli Irpino is in a valley surrounded by mountains, some of which exceed 1700 meters of altitude, such as Mount Cervialto and Mount Raiamagra. It is a sunny location with not too rigid climate, quiet and popular tourist destination, well connected with the motorway network.\n\nIt has ca 3200 inhabitants and lies about 650 meters above sea level. Its mountains border with the mountainous area of Nusco, Lioni, Caposele, Calabritto, Acerno and Montella. Part of the territory is wooded, some other is cultivated and the rest is herbiferous for grazing herds, which constituted the main industries and economic resources of the township. On its mountains you can admire some amazing points, which have nothing to envy the mountains of Switzerland, and among them there is the plateau of Laceno at 1040 meters above sea level, which is crossed by the perennial stream of the Tornola, which collects to form a pond at the foot of Mount Raiamagra, and that finally through a natural tunnel flows into the Caliendo Ravine, one of the offshoots of the Calore River.\n\nBagnoli was built before 1000 A.C., as a fortified town to defend the Lombard Duchy of Salerno. At the time of the of Federico II, Diopold of Hohenburg, German captain, makes it a center of strategic importance. The village became a square of arms, surrounded by powerful walls and equipped with a formidable castle, located on the hill called Serra, and dominating the upper valley of the Calore River.\n\nThe artistic beauties of Bagnoli Irpino have also been in the past of a remarkable taste and value. For centuries it was “Demanio Regio” until the time of the Aragonese it was given as a fief, as along as Montella and Cassano, to the Cavaniglia family (Spanish relatives of the Orsini). During this period the country experienced the most remarkable benefits of progress and renewal, several productive initiatives were improved and enlarged.\n\nIn addition to the herds industry, which the Aragonese favored considerably, silkworm farming and especially the production, the spinning and the coloring of textiles arose in this period; the famous “Pezza Bagnolese” for centuries was an important head of bridal goods. Meeting place of the academics Pontaniani, Bagnoli, inspired the Sannazzaro poet, who drew several thoughts for his poem “ARCADIA” from these places.\n\nErected as a duchy in 1611, it was held in fief by the Maiorca – Strozzi family until 1806 when feudalism was abolished. Being jealous custodians and proud of their freedom, the Bagnolese always imposed the oath of “Chapters”, rules and privileges concerning uses and customs on the state property by the population.\n\nThe country for its future is all about tourism that is considered the only real resource for the local development.\n\nFood\n\nCheese\n\nSheep and cattle breeding is an important resource for Bagnoli Irpino. Moreover, the environmental context in which the animals live guarantee an excellent milk, therefore outstanding cheeses and a tasty meat. Among the cheeses we find excellent pecorino (also flavored with truffle), a fresh ricotta with a delicate taste, dried ricotta with chili, an excellent podolic caciocavallo.\n\nBlack Truffle of Bagnoli Irpino and products with truffles\n\nThe Black Truffle of Bagnoli Irpino (scientific name is “Tuber mesentericum”) is very appreciated for its unmistakable aroma.
