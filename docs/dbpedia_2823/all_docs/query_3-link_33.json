        "text": "Stage 5: Florianópolis - Blumenau, 168km\n\nGPM:\n\nRua Hasselfelde (cat.4) 1,3km @ 10,4%\n\nRua Regente Feijó (cat.4) 0,9km @ 7,1%\n\nAlto da Capela (cat.4) 0,9km @ 9,2%\n\nOnce more I’ve been rather kind to the riders, with no transfer at all from yesterday’s finish, although the departure today is from the continental side of Florianópolis rather than on the island. This enables us to quickly locate the BR-101 once more, and move onto the coastal highway before reaching kilometre zero in the municipality of Biguaçu.\n\nFlorianópolis once more, giving if anything a better look at the final descent from yesterday’s stage\n\nThis is very much a stage of two halves. The first half follows the same pattern as yesterday, largely sticking to the main highway, although it is far less exposed to the wind than in stages 2 and 4 owing to the hilly terrain to the west and a few peninsulas with some hills on them to our east which will make the wind coming in from the Atlantic patchy too. We do divert from the BR-101 to take a detour through various towns, including Porto Belo and Itapema, which is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Santa Catarina with its pristine coastline and its culture of ultralight aircraft flight. Just through a small collection of hills is the larger city of Balneario Cambóriu, twinned to neighbouring Cambóriu from which it takes its name, one of the biggest resort cities on the continent. The full-time population of the city is around 120.000, but in high tourist season this swells to in excess of 1.000.000. The city has developed a number of skyscrapers and luxury hotels, which have earned it the (possibly derogatory) nickname of “Dubai Brasileiro”; it has developed a vibe of a “happening” city, and has become Brazil’s spiritual home of electronic music, with two of the country’s most prominent nightclubs based there. It has its own clone of the Cristo Redentor, the Cristo Luz, who stands on a small hill called - as with Florianópolis - Morro da Cruz, and may be a contender for a hilltop finish if I ever do a second version of this race. One particularly notable feature, however, is the - unique in the world - beach cable car, which exits the main city beach, and climbs over the port channel and estuary, as well as the nearby hill, and down to the secluded Praia Das Laranjeiras.\n\nWe then leave the BR-101, never to return. Instead taking the parallel, bumpy coastal round, around 10km north of Balneario Cambóriu is the city of Itajaí, which the highway bypasses; it comes just before the halfway point, and hosts our first meta volante. One of the oldest cities in Santa Catarina literally speaking, its colonisation started in the 17th Century, although it did not officially see its founding as a city until nearly 200 years later. It became a prominent place for Portuguese settlers until the late 19th Century, when it became a major arrival point for German settlers, although many of them gravitated inland - more on them later. Itajaí is one of the highest per capita GDP cities in the country and also hosts a busy container port. It has been a stage host in The Ocean Race, the round-the-world yachting event, and was the hometown of Lauro Müller, who went on to give his name to the town of - well, obviously - the same name that we passed through in stage 3. It is also the home of Olympic Falconière da Cunha, one of the commanders of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, who fought in the Mediterranean and most notably in the Italian Campaign of World War II on the side of the Allies.\n\nWe then head inland on some absolutely pan-flat roads on the SC-412, which follows the south bank of the Itajaí-Açu river. The most notable city we pass through en route to our stage town is Gaspar, a city of 70.000 which is an important centre for rice-growing in Santa Catarina. The main body of the important parts of this stage, however, all happen once we arrive in our host city, the 350.000-strong metropole of Blumenau.\n\nFounded in 1850, Blumenau was the product of German settlers speculating inland for land that would suit their strengths, and this spot, at a bend in the Itajaí-Açu, was selected by Dr. Hermann Bruno Otto Blumenau, who - obviously - gave the city its name. Early settlers included the prominent evolutionary biologist Fritz Müller, and the city retains its heritage to this day, with the primary ethnic makeup of the city being German, with a smattering of largely northern Italian. The German tongue has practically ceased to be here, the city is far too big and economically powerful to remain the kind of island that Villa General Belgrano, which I covered in my Vuelta a Córdoba, has become, however there remains a heritage that the city attempts to protect, including building styles that mimic 19th Century European timber-framed buildings, and Blumenau’s Oktoberfest has rapidly swelled to become the second biggest in the world - superseding that of the much smaller, but much more tenaciously defensive of its Teutonic identity, Argentinian town.\n\nA little slice of the Alps in Santa Catarina\n\nThe Oktoberfest may attract a million people to Blumenau, but the fact the local area’s main cash crops include feijão and cassava means it hasn’t been quite so suited to traditional German fare - other than beer, which is flourishing, especially the newer styles, such as the Eisenbahn brewery, which adheres to the German purity laws despite not being subject to them, as an affectation or a search for authenticity; they make a range of German-styled beers, from a Pilsener to a classic Weizen. That hasn’t stopped it serving as an attractive town to Germans needing to get away from their homeland well into the 20th Century - Luftwaffe flying ace Martin Drewes relocated to Brazil following his release from British captivity in 1947 and remained there until his death as recently as 2013. The connection remains up to the present day between Blumenau and its spiritual forefathers; many of its famous sporting sons and daughters bear German surnames, and some, such as Christian Maicon Hennig, forge their entire careers in Germany. The other flaw for the settlers of Blumenau has been that, well, the Brazilian rainy season can be quite fierce, and this particular part of the Itajaí-Açu is liable to burst its banks. Across New Year’s in 1984, the city was cut off for weeks by flooding, and its most recent incident of this nature took place in 2008, when over 100 people died in a dramatic flood that saw thousands evacuated.\n\nAs a result, Blumenau is a strangely multi-concentric city; the ‘main’ centre remains in place, but a number of supplementary centres have grown up around the multitude of hills that surround the city. And something that is particularly appealing about some of them is that they bear some relation to the European towns that many of these settlers came from…\n\nIgnore the burnt out car and focus on the beauty that is behind it: yes. They have cobbled hills in Brazil, and we’re going to enjoy a bit of that Belgian-style fun in the Volta do Brasil because, well, it would be rude not to, right?\n\nThe route for the final 45km around Blumenau is fairly complex, so I’ll try and put it basically - we do a little loop de loop that includes the finish, but instead of a circuit there’s an extension to that circuit that rejoins the circuit before the finish. Anybody who knows motorsport may understand if I said that it’s like joining Watkins Glen at the Bus Stop, going to the finish on the NASCAR circuit (so excluding the Boot), and then doing a lap of the full circuit. We arrive from the east and immediately pass the Museu da Cerveja and the Museu da Família Colonial, then through the Bom Retiro bairro on Rua Hermann Hering, which is a bumpy one which includes a small uphill, though not one that I have elected to categorise. The “descent” takes us to Parque Vila Germánica, which is the chocolate box part of town, with the timber frames and outdoor cafes shown above. It also takes us to our first iconic German arched town entrance.\n\nWe don’t actually pass through here; we’re approaching from alongside and we turn northeastward as we arrive at the gate so we don’t pass through it (yet). We then have a left and a sweeping right onto our finishing straight, Rua Antônio da Veiga, where we have a second intermediate sprint at 36km from home. We then cross the iconic Ponte de Ferro, which leads through a tunnel after arriving on the north bank of the river, then two sharp right-handers take us onto a brute of a cobbled climb - 1300m at around 10% on those cobbles you can see in the picture of the burnt-out car above. The reason for the slightly odd circuits is because I didn’t want this to be the last climb as it would kill earlier racing. As things stand, however, there are 32km remaining at the top of this climb, and so we could see things start to hot up. The descent into the Ponte Aguda part of town is fairly steep but it is paved, and then we return south of the river on the Ponte dos Arcos, from which we return to the Museum da Cerveja, Bom Retiro and the Rua Hermann Hering, this time 13km closer to the finish.\n\nThis time, however, we instead turn left when we arrive at the German arch, and pass underneath it to head on a loop around the western edge of town. This includes some stretches of false flat and a couple of short ramps along a cobbled stretch through the Água Verde part of town; there’s about a 2,5km section of cobblestone here that is more-or-less continuous, before 7km or so of normal paved roads around the riverbank. There’s then another short stretch of cobbles on Rua Gustavo Salinger, before a more sustained 900m at 7% cobbled climb on Rua Regente Feijó, which is somewhat worn city cobbles - so worse than the usual city centre cobbles, but not a true Belgian pavé monstrosity either. 9 kilometres remain at this point, a short descent and loop around to the northwest follows, ending with the 900m ascent at just over 9% to the Capela Nossa Senhora Aparecida.\n\nFor the most part, this is on that kind of smoother, hexagonal cobble that you’ll have likely seen if you’ve ever used street view in South America. I got this picture from an article about reparation of the tarmac on Rua Norberto Seará, which is the road which then becomes Run Nicolau Reiter, so I fear the nasty cobbles above may be a thing of the past. However, even without them, it’s a short sharp ascent on those blockish hexagonal cobbles, that comes straight off the back of another ascent which is and remains cobbled; the climb to Nossa Senhora Aparecida crests just 5km from the line, from which it’s a technical and twisty 1500m descent, then a wider, sweeping section to Parque Ramiro Ruediger, and then to the German arch, from which we turn back the way we came when we first arrived, to take the stage to a finish.\n\nWho would win here? Who truly knows? I mean, cobbled classic riding is not something that many South Americans are renowned for. Juan António Flecha excepted - I mean, he didn’t even represent a South American country, racing for Spain despite being born in Argentina - who is even a South American with reasonable results in them? I mean, Murilo Fischer had some top 20s, even a top 10 in Dwars; Andrey Amador isn’t actually South American but we’re having to reach here - he managed 10th in Gent-Wevelgem one year. The occasional guy like Fernando Gaviria might go well in some of the flatter ones that end in sprints from time to time. But apart from that, powerhouse riders are few in South America. I’m thinking this definitely favours the rioplatense over the Andean riders, and yes, maybe some of the Europeans. If Androni send somebody like Manuel Belletti or Francesco Gavazzi, they could have an advantage. Maybe even Jhonatan Restrepo. São Francisco Saúde have Rafael Andriatto who might be Brazil’s best home opportunity; he got some top 10s in races like Paris-Bruxelles, GP Impanis-Van Petegem and the GP Fourmies back in his days with Luca Scinto’s teams. There’s also the tough guys of Uruguay, from those with European experience like Mauricio Moreira, to those who ride strong in the races there like Nicolas Naranjo and Pablo Anchieri.\n\nI’d love to see a few more cobbled races down in the southern hemisphere. It could definitely be done, and also if we did have them, we might see a bit more transference from the rioplatense scene, from which almost exclusively sprinters seem to make it out.\n\nStage 6: Joinville - Curitiba, 130km\n\nGPM:\n\nAlto do Itararé (cat.2) 13,5km @ 4,8%\n\nWednesday brings us the final stage before the first rest day, after a transfer of just under 100km northwards to the city of Joinville, a city which has been populated for over 7000 years thanks to a long history in the region of the Tupi people. Its name is drawn from honouring François d’Orléans, prince of Joinville, who married the Brazilian Princess Dona Francisca in the days of the Brazilian empire - its French namesake hosted the Tour de France in 2003 - however the French prince was going through a financial crisis and sold most of his South Brazilian holdings to German speculators, as a result, despite the French name, this is a largely German-Brazilian city, albeit not to the same extent as Blumenau or Timbó. The official city population is 575.000, with that figure as ever doubling or so once the extended urban sprawl is taken in to consideration. This means it just pips Florianópolis for the title of the most populous metropolitan area in Santa Catarina. It is a city which is renowned for a high standard of living - one of the best on the continent - and has a vibrant artistic culture, even hosting the only official Bolshoi Ballet school outside of Russia. Joinville is renowned as an affluent city with some of the best public education facilities in Brazil, and this has helped a similarly young and progressive culture to similarly ‘happening’ locations in Europe and North America. This has - in common with many hip developing cities elsewhere - led to a massive upsurge in cycling and cycling infrastructure, that has helped it to develop the title of ‘city of bicycles’, which is why it was an essential addition to my Volta do Brasil course.\n\nJoinville is also a city prominent for its tech sector, but it is also growing as a manufacturing hotspot for the automotive industry, with General Motors moving in in 2012, and BMW having a manufacturing plant in a neighbouring town which is administered from Joinville. With a high standard of living and high quality facilities, it is perhaps unsurprising that the majority of Joinville’s famous sons and daughters have been from sporting endeavours - swimmer Eduardo Fischer, who won a bronze medal at the Short Course World Championships in 2002, former Formula 1 driver Maurício Gugelmin, a personal friend of Ayrton Senna who was a staple of the midfield in the late 80s/early 90s golden era of F1 before spending several years in Champ Car/Indycar, former K-1 kickboxer and UFC fighter Vitor Miranda, Pan-American marathon champion Márcia Narloch, and Tiago Splitter, who became the first Brazilian to win an NBA championship, as part of the 2014 San Antonio Spurs, although he had switched his allegiance to represent Spain by that point.\n\nJoinville, perhaps because of its role as a city of bicycles, was a staple host of the Volta da/Tour de Santa Catarina, with the race often ending there or nearby. In 2002, Rodrigo Silva won a stage into Joinville on the penultimate day before the race finished with a crit in the city won by Jean Carlo Coloca. The same format was followed a year later, with Silva winning both stages this time. Patrique Azevedo won the stage to Joinville and Marcio Pinto won the crit the following year; in 2005, the final stage was changed to a short stage from Joinville to a circuit in São Francisco do Sul, but the city still hosted the finish of the penultimate stage as in previous years; MacDonald Fernandes and Nilceu Santos won in Joinville in 2005 and 2006 respectively, before the city moved to be the start, rather than the end, of the reborn, shorter version of the race in 2009. The Argentinian Edgardo Simon won the stage from Joinville to Timbó in 2009, and José Rodrigues did the same a year later. The city hasn’t featured in the 2013 or 2016 editions of the race, but it did host the Brazilian national championships in 2016, when Rodrigo Nascimento won the ITT and Flávio Santos outsprinted Kleber Silva as part of a Funvic 1-2-3-4 in the road race.\n\nThis is a relatively short stage which includes a notable climb mid-stage, but is largely expected to be one for the sprinters. It also sees our only incursion into Paraná in the whole race, a region which hosted its own race sporadically until 2015, although. Largely in the west of the province, a long way from where we are going, around cities like Londrina and Ibipora, which I found too difficult logistically to crowbar into the race. Maybe another time. But first, we must exit Santa Catarina for the final time, so it’s back to the Rodovía General Mário Covas, at least as far as the city of Garuva, a small city which serves as the gateway to this part of the Serra do Mar, and is one of the northernmost municipalities of Santa Catarina, known for colourful buildings and serves as the introduction to the one serious climb of the stage, as we leave the BR-101 for the 376, which will take us up through the valleys onto the high inland plateau.\n\nThe road up to the plateau is wide (it’s a dual carriageway although for reasons of continuity and maintaining gradual ascent and not creating too much construction chaos, the two carriageways often part from one another) and the gradient is gradual - just under 5%. It’s reasonably long - nearly 15km - but the consistent gradient and the fact it’s 75km from the finish means that although some of the more miserable climbers may get dropped, they have ample time to come back and it is highly likely that as a result unless there are some real Quarantas out there - always a possibility given the scene on the pampas in the rioplatense cycling world - the finish will be disputed in a bunch gallop, albeit potentially favouring more durable types than the stage 2 sprint.\n\nAt the summit lies one of the natural wonders of the area, the Cachoeira do Itararé, a large and impressive waterfall, one of several through this and the neighbouring valley where the Rio São João’s different branches have their sources. Brazil is a land teeming with gorgeous waterfalls, and this is fairly tame by their standards, but nevertheless makes for a nice sight. Here's some video.\n\nNow we’re across the state borderline into Paraná and we’ve climbed the main obstacle of the day, it’s time for the sprinters’ trains to take over controlling whatever breakaway has elected to push on on the climb. After all, there’s a rest day tomorrow, so they may feel emboldened to try something. However, this one will almost certainly favour the chasers; there’s about 35km in an absolute ramrod straight line from about the 75km mark to 110km, as we travel toward the outlying towns to Curitiba. The main one is São José dos Pinhais, part of the metropolitan area of Curitiba, which is growing rapidly - from under 200.000 in 2000 to 280.000 just 8 years later. It is a major industrial hub, with automotive plants for four marques under two major automotive umbrellas - Volkswagen/Audi, and Renault/Nissan. It also is the home of Curitiba Airport.\n\nAfter leaving the highway in São José, the final 20km or so are around the urban sprawl of Curitiba, which at 1,9m city, 3,2m metropolitan is the eighth largest city in Brazil. It sprung out of a staging post due to its favourable location between the cattle-breeding cities of the plateaus and the population centres of the coast, before a subsequent growth following successful colonisation and development of the internal parts of Paraná, and then a subsequent expansion following specialised urban planning in the post-WWII era to ensure the city retained its character during a period of almost unprecedented population growth. In fact, the innovative solutions instigated in Curitiba during this period were recommended by UNESCO as a model for rebuilding Afghan cities following the recent wars. Many of the defining features of the city and a number of its cultural centres were designed by Oscar Niemeyer, who also was busying himself at the time with the various civic centres of Brasília, and for this reason Curitiba is the home of the Oscar Niemeyer museum. It also hosted the second Bus Rapid Transit system of the world - sometimes considered the first due to being a fully integrated system as opposed to a single line as Ottawa’s, which opened the previous year to Curitiba’s, was at the time (since expanded). It enabled the city to pedestrianise large parts of the city centre, and the installation of the innovative, space-age Estação Tubo-design bus station to serve RIT (the name for the network) in a number of locations around the city has gone on to become an icon of Curitiba, some of which now include free libraries designed to improve literacy around the city.\n\nIt was one of the host cities selected both times the Brazilians have hosted the football World Cup, in 1950 and 2014, and its location in close proximity to a number of lakes and rivers (six different river basins are found in the Curitiba area) have given a continuous source of clean fresh water that have enabled economic development and to sustain a growing population - the areas of greenery, parkland, lakeland etc. in Curitiba total up to an area which matches that of several other large cities’ total area! It also has a relatively unusual history of immigration that includes an expatriate Ukrainian community which has developed a few generations later into a small Ukrainian-Brazilian minority which generally speaks Portuguese but retains Orthodox faith - around 300.000 Ukrainians reside in Paraná - which may help explain the fast track that Ukrainian soccer teams like Shakhtar Donetsk and Dynamo Kyiv have had in bringing Brazilian talents to Europe.\n\nThe city has three top level football teams - Coritiba (no typo), Athlético Paranaense and Paraná Clube - but although Athlético have won the Brazilian championship before, the main sporting reason for people outside of Curitiba to have heard of the city is the Autodrome, which hosted World Series by Renault/Nissan and WTCC events until recently. As a result of being a city with a prominent motor racing circuit, which is located in the outlying district of Pinhais, a number of famous Curitiba natives have come from motorsport. Three have gone on to enter Formula 1. The first of these is Raul Boesel, who spent two seasons in the early 80s in F1 before carving out a niche for himself in Indycar and becoming World Sportscar Champion in 1987; in the late 90s he was followed by Ricardo Zonta, who won the FIA GT Championship in 1998 and entered 38 Grand Prix over two stints in midfield teams, and is still active in Stock Car Brasil to this day. Finally, Enrique Bernoldi spent two years at back markers Arrows in the early 2000s before racing in Indycar for a few years. As a result, the highest profile driver to come from Curitiba might actually be one that never made it to Formula 1 - that being touring car star and stalwart Augusto Farfus, who spent over a decade as a factory driver for BMW, regularly contending for the WTCC championship, winning 15 races across 6 seasons in the championship, along with 2 class victories in the 24h Daytona, 4 wins in DTM and also appearing as a ringer in various endurance formats where a second or additional driver is required for particular events, such as the 200km Goiânia in Stock Car Brasil or the 1000km Suzuka in Super GT.\n\nCuritiba has also developed something of a reputation for mixed martial arts - with no fewer than five prominent fighters coming from the city. Among women’s MMA, there’s probably the most famous of all female fighters not named Ronda Rousey, Cristiane Justino Venâncio - but don’t worry if you think that makes a negative connotation in that you’ve never heard of her, because the wider world largely knows her by her ring name, Cris Cyborg. There are the Rua brothers, Murilo and Mauricio, but more prominent are the (unrelated) two Silvas - Anderson and Wanderlei, who have both gone down as absolute legends of the sport since its early days and are both still technically active well into their 40s. Wanderlei is known as the Axe Murderer for his brutal kicks and knee strikes, and his record in PRIDE leaves him with the longest winning streak, most wins, most knockouts and most title defences in the organisation’s history.\n\nWanderlei and Anderson, one of their few appearances together\n\nIn less mainstream sports, the city has given Brazil a few Olympic medals thanks to beach volleyballers Emanuel Rigo (gold in 2004, silver in 2012, bronze in 2008) and Agatha Bednarczuk (silver in 2016) as well as a Pan-American basketball gold thanks to Rolando Ferreira.\n\nThe final part of the stage features a loop around the city, heading northward to take in some of the sights and looping around Estádio Couto Pereira, home of Coritiba, before passing the Museu do Expedicionário - interestingly and somewhat unusually, because of its multicultural immigration heritage, Curitiba contributed important aviators to both sides’ WWII efforts - adoptive Frenchman Pierre Clostermann for the Allies, and Ritterkreuz recipient Egon Albrecht for the Axis - and memorabilia from their exploits is on display at the museum - on our way back to the Jardim Botánico district, where we finish the stage - there’s a lopsided roundabout to negotiate at approximately 1100m from the line, but after that it’s effectively a long straight with two shallow left-hand kinks to the line, to finish actually AT the Jardim Botánico, at the Curitiba velodrome.\n\nNow, as you can see here, unlike Roubaix, or my last South American exploits in Montevideo, you can’t actually get onto the velodrome, so we’ll have to finish on the road outside. Which is fine, because a bunch sprint on a velodrome could be an absolute disaster.\n\nSo, who’s going to contend? Well, I look back at my sprinting field. So long as they can make it over the Alto do Itararé, Pablo Anchieri and Nicolás Naranjo are obvious contenders. Germán Tivani is pretty quick, winning two stage of the Vuelta del Uruguay, and durable, finishing 11th in the Vuelta a San Juan. Nelson Soto is probably one to look for - he’s pretty durable - Jhonatán Restrepo, Rafa Andriatto, and Samuel Caldeira potentially?\n\nAfter this, Thursday is a rest day, well-earned by the péloton.\n\nI have honestly never heard of Leberstraße. This is therefore fascinating to me - do you have any more info on it? How to access, a profile etc.?\n\nStage 7: São Paulo - Mogi das Cruzes, 183km\n\nGPM:\n\nAlto da Nossa Senhora das Neves (cat.4) 1,8km @ 7,8%\n\nAlto da Serra do Mar (Biritiba)(cat.1) 14,2km @ 5,7%\n\nChâteau Ma Vie (Sul)(cat.3) 3,3km @ 6,4%\n\nChâteau Ma Vie (Norte)(cat.3) 3,0km @ 5,8%\n\nOn the Thursday rest day, the péloton is transferred northeast from Curitiba to São Paulo, around which the second phase of the race will be based. Immortalised as a sacred city by the legendary tropicalista Tom Zé in his classic São São Paulo, obviously doing a rundown of the potted history of, the places engulfed by, the events held in, and the people to come from, a city of over 12 million - with over 30 million in the extended metropolitan area - is going to be ridiculous - after all, Greater São Paulo, the main metropolitan area, is so densely packed that it ranks as the 12th most populous city on earth.\n\nIt’s a colossus, with the largest economy in the southern hemisphere, and represents over 10% of Brazil’s entire economic output. Which is a long way from its humble beginnings as São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, as a village whose surround region was once one of the poorest in the Portuguese Empire. For many years it was one of very few Portuguese outposts above the Serra do Mar, as the region was difficult to access - until the discovery of gold in Minas Gerais made travelling inland expedient, and São Paulo grew as a staging post, and the town became a hub for the bandeirantes, speculators and hustlers looking for expansion of territory and the glory associated therewith. The city grew rich from sugar cane, and then grew enormously following the abolition of slavery, with ex-slaves and a large number of immigrants, who the country advertised to in the aim of replacing the workforce liberated from slavery, settling in the cities. Nowadays the city has converted itself to be more of a service-based economy, but its expansion from its industrial days has left it a towering colossus in the Brazilian psyche.\n\nSão Paulo is the most multicultural city in Brazil, too, with immigration from all over the world, which has left it an ethnic melting pot and fed into its unique culture, as well as influencing its popular gastronomical culture. The largest group were Italians, but Germans and Japanese are also highly represented as well as the ever-present Portuguese. However, since the 1930s immigration has been replaced by internal migration as the city swelled up enormously under the influx of new inhabitants from elsewhere in Brazil. More recently, the manufacturing sector has been replenished by immigrants from Bolivia, and the city has also seen a large influx from East Asia. It remains a city with deep class divides, but the policies implemented to reduce violent crime have largely been effective, with a significant downturn in the homicide rate - albeit from “terrifying” to only “fairly scary”. São Paulo is a city which is radically improving its image, however - from the huge downturn in the murder rate to the edict removing hundreds of billboards and adverts from the city, to the transition from an industrial manufacturing to a service economy and the associated environmental improvements, the city is proving itself progressive, at least in the centre; some of the existing problems remain so in the favelas.\n\nThe city also is far less reliant on tourism than Rio de Janeiro; its tourist interest focuses primarily on the business traveler. Three quarters of the largest business fairs in Brazil take place in São Paulo, and likewise it looks at international economic fora as a target area, relying on the associated travel and income rather than selling its natural assets, an area where the Paulistanos are obviously at a disadvantage. The city follows an unusual pattern thanks to generational changes in urban planning - as the rich and middle classes have moved away from the centre, rather than pushing the poorer classes out, they have been moved into adjacent communities, often segregated by walls and with various security features, in a sort of checkerboard. This has also seen more regulation of construction in the outlying areas, which had previously seen a lot of makeshift dwellings that had become permanent through a range of ingenious solutions as is common in a lot of favelas.\n\nAs in the rest of Brazil, football is king from a sporting point of view in São Paulo, with Corinthians, Palmeiras and São Paulo FC being the main teams vying for the city’s affection, plus myriad smaller teams. São Paulo actually has a deeper connection with the sport than the rest of the city, however, as the birthplace of Charles William Miller, the son of a Scottish businessman who emigrated to Brazil, who was educated in England and, upon his return, set up football, rugby and cricket clubs in São Paulo, which in turn led to the first organised football league in Brazil and was instrumental in kickstarting its popularity. São Paulo FC is the legacy of his cricket club (much as myriad other teams such as Peñarol and AC Milan are derived from cricket teams set up by ex-pat Brits), while Corinthians take their name from the public school Miller attended in the UK. Subsequent footballing heroes from the city include some of the country’s true legends - Arthur Friedenreich, the best player of Brazil’s amateur era; Filó Guarisi, a child of Italian immigrants who returned to Europe and won the 1934 World Cup for Italy; Vicente Feola, who was the manager of Brazil’s 1958 World Cup-winning team; Waldemar de Brito, a star of the 1930s who scored 18 goals in 18 games for Brazil before WWII but is most remembered as the man who discovered Pelé; Djalma Santos, who won two World Cups and is one of only three players - and the first and only Brazilian - to be selected in FIFA’s All-Star team in three consecutive World Cups; the legendary Rivelino, who was part of that golden 1970 team often hailed as the best ever, along with Félix, also a member of that team; Ronaldão, part of the 1994 World Cup winning team; Cafú, widely regarded as one of the greatest right-backs of all time, a two time World Cup winner and captain of Brazil’s most recent triumph in 2002; Zé Roberto who missed that triumph but played in 1998 and 2006; Ricardinho who was part of the 2002 squad; Cacau who was part of Germany’s 2010 World Cup squad, and current players Paulinho, Lucas Moura, Rafinha, Marquinhos, Gabriel Jesus and Malcom.\n\nSão Paulo was never necessarily the origin of it, with several of its key components being from Salvador, Bahia, but it does have a crucial role in the development of the “tropicalismo” movement, with counter-culture poets such as Torquato Neto coming into contact with avant-garde musicians running counter to the path of Bossa nova, or taking risks with the format in a way that irked the purists; the Baiano group of Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa and Tom Zé moved to São Paulo and met with Paulistano like-minded individuals such as Rogério Duprat, the mad scientist record producer, and the musicians Rita Lee, Arnaldo Baptista and Sérgio Dias, who went on to fame as Os Mutantes, and the fruits of this collaboration led to the release of the iconic “Tropicália, ou, Panis et Circensis” collaboration/compilation album which blended all of the above along with the patronage of progressive bossa artist Nara Leão, who had already been interpreting the songs of Gil and Veloso, and went on to shape alternative music and rock and roll in Brazil for a generation.\n\nThe men and women who revolutionised Brazilian music, and possibly the most important album in Brazilian history. Top row: Arnaldo Baptista, Caetano Veloso (holding picture of Nara Leão), Rita Lee, Sérgio Dias, Tom Zé. Middle row: Rogério Duprat, Gal Costa, Torquato Neto. Front: Gilberto Gil (holding picture of Capinam)\n\nThe city was also home to post-tropicalista Toquinho, whose collaborations with Jorge Ben, Vinicius de Moraes and Chico Buarque have immortalised his position in Brazilian musical history; the city was also the centre of Brazil’s post-punk scene in the 1980s, documented in the Não Wave compilation album that centres around acts like Fellini, As Mercenárias and my favourites of them, the short-lived cult synth-rockers Agentss.\n\nThere is another area of sporting heritage in which São Paulo truly excels, but I shall leave that for another time (it will come up again). However, we should perhaps offer a word to Rafael Andriato, who has been flying the flag for Brazilian cycling in Europe until recently and remains one of the country’s most prominent cyclists. He became a force in Brazil in 2007 as a 20-year-old and earnt himself a ticket to amateur cycling in Italy, gaining a number of wins and podiums in 2010 and 11 and earning himself a pro ride with Luca Scinto’s Farnese Vini team for 2012. He largely rode smaller races, winning the Châteauroux Classic de l’Indre and the Jurmala GP, and making the top 10 of Paris-Bruxelles and the GP Impanis-van Petegem. He rode the Giro in 2013, but after this, wins were generally restricted to South America (winning stages of the Vuelta a Venezuela and Tour do Rio) and smaller races like the Tour of Sibiu. He wasn’t renewed for 2016, but was back with the team mid-season, winning a stage of the Tour of Hainan, but when the team downsized for 2018 he was one of the victims, and returned to South America where he lines up for São Francisco Saúde-Ribeirão Preto, and I presume will be a key protagonist in this race.\n\nWhen the riders arrive in São Paulo, we will have a presentation in the Sambadromo Anhembi - one of the largest outdoor event venues in Brazil with a capacity of 103.200. Designed by Oscar Niemeyer, it opened in the early 1990s and has been increased in capacity significantly since due to the attractions during the carnaval. It consists of stands alongside a long exhibition parade mall, which riders can pass down en bloc as teams to enable an atmosphere. Around 30 events are held a year at Anhembi, not counting the separate water polo facility which is also part of the construction. In addition to this, the Indycar Series ran a series of races on a street circuit set up around the Sambadrome from 2010 to 2013 after Interlagos proved too difficult to organise for them; the street circuit featured an unconventional layout with the start/finish straight in the sambadrome, thus necessitating a pit lane far removed from the start/finish.\n\nBecause of the problems of traffic congestion in São Paulo, however, closing down the city centre for racing is likely to prove difficult, which is why in many years when it is based in São Paulo the Copa América do Ciclismo has based itself in Interlagos. The stage start will therefore be in Parque Ibirapuera, a few kilometres south of the centre, but a popular retreat for Paulistas inspired by English landscape parks and the pioneering city park planning of Roberto Burle Marx. It is one of the biggest urban parks in Latin America and its cultural relevance to São Paulo is similar to that of Central Park in New York. However, it also has such a multitude of access points that having the départ at the south of the park would not impede its use or access for much of the city while still allowing us to set off from interior São Paulo city on our day’s odyssey.\n\nWe begin the stage by heading southward on the SP-160, but leaving the main road at the Alto da Serra junction - this is as to descend down to sea level on this particular road would entail passing through a series of tunnels as well as potentially taking the entire péloton - this is early in the stage and with no climbing - down a descent with some potentially dangerous drops. Instead, we branch eastwards to take the parallel route down on the SP-050, which is a much safer route on a two-lane road (and again because of this contraflow can ease the traffic burden) that takes us towards Cubatão. The descent is around 13km in length at just over 5%. There’s an alternative, steeper road on the SP-148 but that doesn’t link up well so I’ve avoided it on this occasion.\n\nCubatão is not one of Brazil’s nice places. You won’t see it in many tourist guidebooks - and with good reason. It is an ugly heavy industrial and manufacturing city specialising in fertilisers, steel and oil production which is close to the Seaport of Santos, but without any of the positive impacts that the seafront has on desirability. A further problem is that the presence of the Serra do Mar and the prevailing wind direction in from the Atlantic means that often chemicals belched into the air by the manufacturing plants don’t make it past the mountains and are dumped back down onto the city and kill the surrounding forest. In the 1980s it was one of the top 10 most polluted cities in the world, and was nicknamed the Valley of Death. Contamination with Persistent Organic Pollutants meant that the Rhodia polymer processing plant in Cubatão was highlighted by Greenpeace as one of the worst corporate crimes, while a shantytown was set ablaze by an oil fire in 1984. These incidents along with several-times-higher-than-normal incidences of endocrine and respiratory diseases among infants, anencephalic babies and the environmental impact on the surrounding forest area and fear that the pollution from Cubatão could spread to São Paulo led to a level of notoriety; since 1990, over $1bn has been plunged into saving the city. It was name checked by Brazil’s most famous metal band, Sepultura, in their environmental activist hardcore track Biotech is Godzilla (I believe this one was actually written by Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra, but is about specifically Brazilian issues hence becoming a Sepultura track).\n\nI really wanted to include the city of Santos in this, largely because of its iconic football club which has come to be the embodiment of jogo bonito, through its legendary 60s team led by Pelé and also featuring the likes of Carlos Alberto, Edu, Zito and Pepe, but also partly because it was founded by the nobleman and explorer Brás Cubas, whose name was used for a fictitious small-town diplomat who serves as the rather-too-reliable narrator of one of my favourite books, Joaquim María Machado de Assis’ The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas - the premise of which is that Brás Cubas is narrating his life story from beyond the grave, and, being already dead, he therefore is unencumbered by pride or honour, and so gives a warts and all (and frequently hilarious) story of how he failed as a human, in dozens of bite-sized chapters (including two which are entirely blank, since the narrator feels them self-explanatory in view of the previous chapter’s events). Early drafts of this race featured a Santos-Cubatão stage featuring the climbs of the Serra do Mar here, but this was not feasible with the direction I was taking the race and also the descents would mean the climbs were too far from the finish to realistically be a differentiator, making the stage a bit redundant, so this was the compromise solution. However, as Santos is essentially the head of a peninsula and is only linked to Guarujá by car ferry, this would have led to a 230km+ stage which is simply not realistic for a race of this kind.\n\nInstead therefore we head over a small climb, leaving the main road briefly for a short trip over the old road through the hills, and then turn left to wind our way along the base of the mountains along the Canal de Bertioga, part of the delta of the river complex around this part of the mountains, including the Rio Santana and the Rio Pedreira, of which this is an offshoot. Bertioga hosts the first intermediate sprint, and has its main worldwide fame/infamy as the place where the “Angel of Death”, the notorious Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, died in 1979 after over 30 years of evading capture following flight to South America with assistance from former SS members. The notorious war criminal spent time in Argentina and Paraguay before finding his way to Brazil in 1960 using a series of false names to evade the West German and Israeli intelligence operations. He used an identity card acquired from a Nazi sympathiser called Wolfgang Gerhard, who had assisted him in arriving in Brazil, and when he died suffering a stroke during a swim in Bertioga he was buried under this identity, which among others he had been using since 1971 - however he was disinterred and formally identified six years later.\n\nWe head along the beaches of Bertioga for a few kilometres before turning inland and including the main climb of the day, a 14km cat.1 challenge to the summit of the Serra do Mar close to the town of Biritiba. Here's some drone footage of the climb - a classic cycling ascent if ever there was one. It’s also famous for Três Cachoeiras, because there are three major waterfalls back to back on the way down from the summit close to the road - the Cachoeira do Limo, the Cachoeira Véu da Noiva and the Cachoeira do Elefante.\n\nHere's video of part of the climb, being descended by motorcyclists, as far as the Mirante Cachoeira do Elefante. As you can see, it’s part of a 3-part video, so you can see the whole thing across all of them.\n\nThe summit of the climb is 28km from Mogi das Cruzes, or actually slightly less, but 28km from where we’re putting the finish. As there is no descent at all - we’ve simply ascended onto a plateau, not even a lopsided one like most of the Spanish climbs onto the meseta like Urkiola, Escudo, Pajáres, Somiedo or San Glório - that might have been enough. But I had something else in mind, largely because of the coming stages potentially discouraging aggression on this stage. Therefore, in fact when we cross the summit of the Serra do Mar ascent and head toward Biritiba, we are actually 48km from home, as I have appended a 20km circuit to the stage after arrival in Mogi das Cruzes.\n\nIn fact, this was due to a piece of inspiration from a most unlikely of sources: the Tour of Oman. No, really.\n\nYou see, cycling has obviously had plenty of racing around circuits in its time, and sometimes those circuits involve highways, or dual carriageways, where circuits include using both sides of the same road. It’s time honoured. Things like the 1974 Tour stage in Plympton, where the UK authorities’ reluctance to close roads and misunderstanding of bike racing led to a stage up and down a stretch of a city bypass, might be unusual, but there are lots of races which utilise this format. In recent memory you have things like the 2009 Tour of Turkey Istanbul circuit, back and forth along the corniche but then a short stretch inland to finish at the Blue Mosque before descending back to the corniche; the 2005 World Championships in Madrid featured a 180º hairpin bend in the closing stretches as most of the interesting parts of the circuit were a good way north of where the finish was; plus of course there is the Tristar Madrid circuit and the iconic Champs Elysées finish in the Tour de France. What the Tour of Oman offered us that interested me, however, was this:\n\nSpotted it? Why of course: those climbs of Bousher al Amerat are not all alike! The first and third climbs are different - shorter - than the second! Why could that be?\n\nAh-ha!!! Yes, the climb of Bousher al Amerat is on a dual carriageway road. So the riders climbed it from the east, travelled down a junction on the road, switched to the other side of the road and climbed it from the west, then turned back to climb it from the east again to the finish. While these stages tended to finish in sprints, the presence of these climbs added a bit of intrigue. Also: those stages didn’t have a 14km @ 5,7% climb 30km earlier with no descent at all.\n\nThe actual finish I’ve used in Mogi das Cruzes is outside the Clube Naútico, in the northern bairro of Vila Mogilar. From here we head north on the SP-088 Rodovia Pedro Eroles, a dual carriageway which heads over a small range of hills in the direction of Arujá, an outlying town near the edge of the São Paulo megalopolis. At the top of one such hill lies the Château ma Vie, a French-themed events venue and, well, château, right on the line demarcating the municipalities of Mogi and Dutra, popular for hosting performances, concerts and events such as weddings and dinners.\n\nThe climb from the Mogi side is slightly tougher than the one from the Dutra side, but both are not especially threatening - a little over 3km at 6,5% from the south and 3km at just under 6% from the north. No super steep gradients. But definitely a bit of a potential fulcrum for an attack, especially if there are a lot of riders who have suffered for the long climb earlier. Some teams’ sprinters may have been durable enough to last this long, and will want to encourage a sprint, but others will not, and so it could become very tactical here as stage hunters seek their opportunities. The south side of the climb is crested just over 16km from home, then the riders descend, exit the highway at the Aruã junction, re-enter it on the opposite side and crest the north side of the climb at 7,2km from the line. The descent being wide does enable things to favour the chase a bit, which is a shame, but there is a final sting in the tail - I didn’t want to cross the line in the wrong direction originally, so rather than head directly back to the finish, we have a slightly longer detour around the northern parts of Mogi das Cruzes, featuring several corners and some cobbled streets to try to allow attackers to get out of sight and out of mind before the last couple of kilometres on safer wider roads to allow a safe sprint train. I know another loop of the final circuit would only have the course be 203-204km and not be unreasonable, but that would also move the cat.1 climb to being 70km from home, which means it might be less interesting than it will be here, and give less chance to the sprintier riders to make it back in time before the finish if they’re dropped.\n\nMogi das Cruzes is another city which was founded by the Bandeirantes, around 40km east of São Paulo. It doesn’t have a major football team, but it does have an impressive résumé of footballers to have come out of its camps in recent years; the rugged defender Felipe, who moved to Portugal with Porto and then on to Atlético Madrid, and the storied Edmar Halovskyi are both from the city (Edmar spent most of his career in Ukraine with Simferopol and then Metalist Kharkiv, marrying a Ukrainian woman and taking her surname, as well as appearing for Ukraine), as are Lecheva and Maikon Leite who ply their trade in Brazil. The most famous footballer - and by proxy given his status in Brazil probably the most famous outright - to come from Mogi das Cruzes is the controversial, mercurial but infuriating Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior, known typically either as Neymar Jr or, more typically, mononymically as Neymar. One of the most divisive figures in football, Neymar is a prodigiously talented player, who is now Brazil’s third highest goalscorer of all time, behind only Pelé and Ronaldo. However, because of his prodigious talent, he was highly molly-coddled by the Santos youth academy and treated as a golden child, which has instilled in him an equally prodigious sense of entitlement which has engendered severe attitude problems; the man has a horrendous reputation for diving, simulating injury and demanding referee decisions go his way - but if they don’t, of spitting, arguing, and not really understanding that one reaps what one sows, and if you go around clattering and shoving people you can’t expect them to just accept it and allow you free reign to dive and roll around unchecked. Somebody once timed a particularly egregious game which showed that Neymar spent over 17 minutes of Brazil’s World Cup fixture with Mexico on the floor feigning injuries. Off the field he’s not much better, with an entourage of agents, hangers-on and yes men that have left him in disputes with teammates and arguments with coaches. At the same time, however, people are largely prepared to put up with his antics because he remains one of the sport’s best players - to the extent where his absence from the Brazilian team in the 2014 humiliation against Germany after being injured in the quarter-final against Colombia was treated in the pre-match period like a wake, with players holding up his jersey like he had died.\n\nThe city is also home, perhaps more interestingly, to Sérgio Correa, an important member of the Communist guerrilla group Ação Libertadora Nacional, that fought against the military dictatorship in the late 1960s with the same kind of terroristic fervour as similar groups in Europe such as the Rote Armee Faktion. Correa was killed when the car bomb he was transporting to the Nestlé headquarters building in São Paulo detonated prematurely, probably due to the vehicle being jolted by potholes in the roads. Because of how badly charred his remains were (as opposed to his accomplice, who was thrown from the vehicle), it took several days to ascertain that the remains were Correa, and his body was never formally identified, so despite having already been dead for six years he was sentenced in absentia to 40 months in prison in 1975, and added to the list of Politically Dead and Missing Persons upon the overthrow of the military dictatorship in 1985.\n\nThis is one of the hardest stages to predict of all of them in the Volta do Brasil. It’s a relatively long one, but there are elements of it to interest all types of rider. A sprinter mightn’t like the climbing, but a durable one that can get over the main climb will have opportunities given the final pair of climbs are on wide road and not too steep. However, there’s no descent after the big climb for them to gain time back or recover, so other types of rider will want to keep the fast men at arm’s length. Puncheurs will like there being two short climbs in the run-in, although they’re not especially steep, and baroudeurs will look to take advantage of indecision among other types of rider in terms of how to approach this finale. Climbers will like the long climb here but will need to be a bit more versatile, Lombardia style, to best take advantage of this day. And with a potentially important weekend for the GC coming up, stage hunters of all stripes will likely have their eyes on the potential that this one offers.\n\nStage 9: Pindamonhangaba - Campos do Jordão, 164km\n\nGPM:\n\nAlto da Brasa (HC) 19,7km @ 5,8%\n\nAlto dos Campos do Jordão (cat.1) 13,0km @ 5,3%\n\nAlto da Serra do Paiol (HC) 7,3km @ 10,8%\n\nAlto de Imbiry (cat.3) 6,3km @ 5,0%\n\nThe second Sunday of the race sees the first of two potential candidates for the title of ‘queen stage’ in the Volta do Brasil, and what is probably just about the hardest stage for me to settle on - I was tinkering with it all the way until this morning due to the number of potential ways to move around Campos do Jordão and its offshoot climbs and side streets, because Campos do Jordão itself sits in a little miniature altiplano between a group of mountains, but a lot of the climbs are lopsided, so finding an approach which is both plausible and allows us to connect the difficult climbs is a challenge. The other thing was distance - a 200km multi-mountain odyssey would be something that is maybe a possibility for the Vuelta a Colombia or Vuelta a Venezuela, but it’s not really something that would work in less developed cycling scenes like Ecuador, or in rioplatense cycling where mountains are fewer in number and so genuine queen stages tend to be shorter as a result. However, this was arguably the most obvious “must have” stage of the entire race in terms of the essential locations to include in a real homage to Brazilian cycling (there are three such locations - Serra do Rio do Rastro, and another yet to come).\n\nBefore we get there, however, we need to set off from the beginning of the stage. Pindamonhangaba is the town I’ve chosen for the départ, a short way up the Vale do Paraíba from yesterday’s stage town of São José dos Campos. Between the two cities lies the city of Taubaté, which also hosts a prominent Brazilian domestic team, and Pindamonhangaba itself is the home of what has been, in recent years, Brazil’s most successful and most widely-known cycling team worldwide.\n\nAbout 170.000 people live in Pindamonhangaba, which is an old city established in the 17th Century. Its most famous export of recent years is the footballer Luiz Gustavo, who has nearly 50 caps for O Seleção and has spent much of his career in Germany. It sits on the easternmost tip of São Paulo province, but it is for cycling that we will know the city, as it is one of Brazil’s cycling hubs. The Volta do São Paulo / Tour de Brasil came into Pindamonhangaba three consecutive years from 2010 to 2012 in the same format - first, on the third from final day, a sprint stage from Atibaia to Pindamonhangaba, then on the penultimate day, a very short mountain stage from Pindamonhangaba to Campos do Jordão; in 2010, it was Argentine sprinter Edgardo Simón that won the former with Gregory Panizo winning the latter to take the race lead off of Flávio Santos; a year later Roberto Silva won a sprint from a reduced group ahead of Simón, then Diego Ares won the mountain stage ahead of Ecuador’s Jorge Luís Montenegro; finally in 2012 Marcos Crespo won a two-up ahead of Murilo Affonso in Pindamonhangaba with the bunch narrowly failing to catch them, then Alex Diniz won the mountain stage from Magno Nazaret and Flávio Santos. Between suspensions (Silva, Diniz, Affonso) and retirements (Simón, Crespo, Panizo) many of these would not be on hand, but Montenegro is a potential ringer.\n\nHowever, the main legacy of Pindamonhangaba is as the home of Team Cycling Funvic Pindamonhangaba, the most globally renowned Brazilian cycling team of the last decade. With ongoing and continuous support from the Fundação Universitária Vida Cristã (hence F.Un.Vi.C.), this team was one of the most prominent in Brazilian cycling throughout the 2000s and made the step up to become a Continental team at the same time as São José dos Campos, their perennial rivals for supremacy (along with at various times Avaí and Memorial-Santos-Fupes), made their doomed bid for ProContinental.\n\nOriginally with a jersey awash with minor sponsors and a design akin to that other team renowned for that, Savio’s mob (then called Serramenti PVC Diquigiovanni, but known to most of us now as Androni Giocattoli) with green and orange accents on a white background, the team largely focused on sprints with Roberto Silva and Edgardo Simón, but the withdrawal of São José dos Campos’ pro licence in August offered them an opportunity they couldn’t refuse; having already acquired Chilean veteran Marco Arriagada’s services after he won the Volta a Paraná in June, they took on a full GC arm by hiring the now-contractless Matías Medici and Magno Nazaret, moves which also encouraged the Marcondes César company previously with São José to come on board as secondary sponsor. In the next few years they solidified their position as the strongest team in Brazil, and nearly every major talent of Brazilian cycling came through their doors at some point - Otávio Bulgarelli, Alex Diniz, Murilo Affonso, João Gaspar, Antônio Nascimento, Flávio Santos, Kleber Ramos, Magno Nazaret, Gregory Panizo - plus some from further afield - Héctor Águilar from Uruguay, Francisco Chamorro, Edgardo Simón, Matías Medici, Daniel Díaz and Marcos Crespo from Argentina, and also in 2014 some mercenaries from Colombia - Juan Sebastián Tamayo, Óscar Sánchez and Wilson Rincón. 2015 was obviously their biggest year of success, with Daniel Díaz winning the Tour de San Luís along with the team doing a 1-2 with Díaz and Diniz on the Cerro El Amago and a 1-3 with Kleber Ramos winning atop the Filo de Merlo, as well as putting two riders - Ramos and Diniz - on the podium of the Tour do Rio.\n\nAt this point, like São José dos Campos before them, they rather overstretched themselves. Díaz’s success saw him hired to Europe, despite the team’s attempts to keep him. They acquired a Pro Continental licence and even hired some riders from well beyond their traditional limitations - former Caja Rural rider António Piedra, former Euskaltel fastman Pablo Urtasun, Portuguese prospect Luis Mendonça, veteran Portuguese Daniel Silva and Spanish journeyman Jordi Simón. However, in news that will not shock you if you’ve read this far, they were unable to replicate that kind of success - they had more success than São José’s foray at the level, even getting some good invites in Europe - but results outside of home were increasingly hard to achieve; Alex Diniz managed a couple of stage placings in breakaways in the Volta a Portugal, but the best results outside Brazil were achieved in far-flung races - Diniz in the Tour of Taihu Lake, and Piedra in the Tour de Langkawi. Worse: João Gaspar tested positive for CERA at the Volta a Portugal, and then Kleber Ramos did the same in an out of competition test four days later. Alex Diniz then was revealed to have dubious values in 2015 and saw his season wiped, and so while the team made it through the year to a second ProContinental year in 2017, the fact that the only World Tour races they got to do were Catalunya and Turkey, and that their best results were achieved once more in South America (the 1-2-3 in the Vuelta del Uruguay is particularly notable) or in end-of-season Asia Tour races - and almost exclusively by Magno Nazaret - along with further doping issues resulting in a temporary suspension of licence, they dropped down to the aficionado level once more. However, they do still hold a lot of sway in Brazilian cycling thanks to that history, and they still have a number of strong and prominent, if now ageing, riders at their disposal, such as Otávio Bulgarelli and Flávio Santos. This is one stage they’ll really want to deliver in.\n\nBack in the “glory” days\n\nSo… that’s the start town. What about the finish? I know, I normally leave the finish til last. But there’s only about 35km between Pindamonhangaba and Campos do Jordão and the stage largely loops around the latter to maximise difficulty.\n\nCampos do Jordão is a very popular resort and spa town in the Serra da Mantiqueira, which has a population of around 50.000, and at an altitude of over 1600m is the highest city in Brazil. The population is a bit of a misnomer, however, as like many resort towns it tends to fluctuate, with a high proportion of second homes for people living and working in São Paulo and other outlying cities in the Vale do Paraíba. It serves as the access point to a state park and to many peaks in the nearby area, and has become a centre for health tourism. It also has a theme park-like adherence to central European architecture, thanks to an influx of German, Swiss and north Italian immigrants that have given it a flavour of the mountain settlements closer to home. Although it isn’t really a German city so to speak, the way that Blumenau or Timbó are, the fact German and Swiss immigrants knew how to maximise resources to build towns and cities in the mountains has greatly influenced the town planning, and it has a railroad from Pindamonhangaba regarded as one of Brazil’s most scenic, a chocolate box town centre inspired by Alpine architecture, and another classic German gate. Not for nothing is the region around Campos do Jordão known as the “Brazilian Switzerland”. Perhaps this is more the town to compare to Colonia Tovar.\n\nBeing as it is a reasonably sized town surrounded on all sides by mountains, it is no surprise that bicycle race organisers were drawn to Campos do Jordão. The road from Pindamonhangaba to Campos do Jordão, at least as far as Ribeirão Grande, appeared in the old version of the Volta do São Paulo back in the 60s and early 70s, when people like Martín Emílio “Cochise” Rodríguez and Joaquim Agostinho were competing, but never near stage finishes. It was rediscovered in 2010 as mentioned above and became a staple of the Volta do São Paulo until its demise. Those stages were typically a 62km headlong charge from Pindamonhangaba, so we’re going for something a bit more in depth than that.\n\nTheoretically, one could go directly from Pindamonohangaba to Campos do Jordão; however, taking the 383/SP-123 all the way to the top means a relatively gradual finale; a Unipuerto stage may not work for that reason. The first 9km of the climb, up to Ribeirão Grande, are at 6,4%, however the next 11km are only at 4%, so that may hamper its decisiveness. As a result, the Volta do São Paulo would then take the gradual descent to Vila Nova and Rosas, and then climb the old road, the SP-050, into Campos do Jordão from the west, which is around 13km at a little over 5%. This created a 60km or so mini-stage, so I suspect they may have added a punchy little dig in Campos itself to increase gaps, especially looking at the 2012 stage where 8 riders finish within 9 seconds.\n\nThis western side on the SP-050 is the one used in l’Étape Brasil, ASO’s sportive in the Serra da Mantiqueira (profile here, course here). You can see some brief highlights here. Because a large portion of the Brazilian péloton are, while to all intents and purposes professionals, not registered at the UCI, you can therefore see a number of riders who have been on pro teams in the results at l’Étape, although many don’t treat it as a serious competition; Otávio Bulgarelli “won” it in 2018, however. Tiago Forilli, Diego Ares, Ricardo Pichetta and Antônio Garnero all appear near the top of the list of fastest completions of the full course - which is nearly double the length of the old professional race into the town, albeit with only the one serious climb instead of two.\n\nWhat neither the Volta do São Paulo nor l’Étape Brasil take into account, however, is there is a better way to get from Pindamonhangaba to Campos do Jordão if you want to make a selective bike race. A short way after Ribeirão Grande, so only a kilometre or so into the easier second half of the main road int Campos do Jordão, there’s a sharp right onto the Estrada Municipal do Toriba, and this climbs almost 200m higher than the main road, in a similar if not actually slightly shorter amount of time. Here's a motorcyclist’s video of the road (we do it in the opposite direction) crossing the summit at around 1:30 then the rest of the video is the descent. As you can see: perfectly passable for road bikes. So why they’ve never utilised it is beyond me, because I make it an overall climb of 19,7km @ 5,8% - ignore those kilometres at 12%, it’s not quite that bad - more like 9% max for a stretch as long as that - but still, a more than worthy major climb, fairly consistent but still justifying a tag as our first HC mountain of the Volta do Brasil - comparable in nature to Izoard north (19km @ 6,0%), Cormet de Roseland east (19,4km @ 5,9%), or Aitana (22km @ 5,7%). So it’s a borderline cat.1/HC in Europe (Izoard north gets the nod because of its altitude, while Aitana gets it because the Vuelta tends to be a little more generous in its classifications. Cormet de Roseland is usually cat.1). Col d’Allos north (19,5km @ 5,7%) and Falzarego west (19,4km @ 5,7%) are perhaps the closest avatars, and I think both would be cat.1. However, I think given the difference in mountains between the countries, I think A Brasa, cresting just before the Fazendinha Toriba, deserves HC status in the Volta do Brasil.\n\nOf course this is also straight off the bat: first climb of the day. And I’m putting an intermediate sprint in Campos do Jordão (not at the finish, which we do not yet cross) just 5km after the summit, because this is a lopsided climb. We then descend down the main road from Pindamonhangaba to Campos do Jordão - so yes, we actually when we get close to Ribeirão Grande manage to go down a stretch of road we already climbed. But if you’re such a rotten climber that you can’t get to the turnoff for A Brasa 14km into the first climb of the day before the leaders have climbed over the remaining 6km or so to the summit, down the short descent, around the 5km or so flat to the Vista Chinesa lookout and then down another 4,3km of descent, then you stand no chance whatsoever of making the timecut over the rest of the stage anyway, so we may as well cull you now.\n\nOnce we get to Ribeirão Grande, though, the descent into Santo Antônio do Pinhal is very gradual and basically false flat as we head into the Sapucaí Mirim protected area, which forms part of the borderlands between São Paulo state and Minas Gerais. There’s a short uncategorised dig just after the town as we leave the main road for the smaller road to Vila Nova, which takes us past the Cachoeira do Cassununga, another of the billion or so scenic waterfalls in this race (if there’s one thing my taste in climbs and my posts in this thread should tell you, I like a good scenic waterfall). Then we have the classic side of Campos do Jordão (plus a little bit at the top as we go past the Jardim Panorama) which totals 13km @ 5,3% - with the main part being 12,3km @ 5,0%. You can see some footage of climbing it here (as a bonus, that ride gives you the chance to see what the profile would be of the 62km stages in the Volta do São Paulo as he climbs Ribeirão Grande followed by the old road to Campos do Jordão).\n\nThe climb to Campos do Jordão in l’Étape Brasil\n\nThis time, the 5km flat through Campos do Jordão itself hosts the feed zone, before we repeat the same descent through Vista Chinesa and Santo Antônio do Pinhal that we did previously. Before the waterfall, however, we diverge for another valley road past the Pedra do Peão and across the state borderline into Minas Gerais at Sapucaí-Mirim. About 15km of flat take us to the town of São Bento do Sapucaí, another bandeirante outpost in the Serra da Mantiqueira on their way to the gold-filled hills of Minas Gerais. This small town’s main claim to fame is the natural beauty that the municipality contains, in particular the Cachoeira do Toldi, a well-known waterfall that plunges some 200m at its full extent.\n\nWe’re heading straight for it, and that means taking a monstrous road onto the Serra do Paiol which crests 23km from the finish and, despite its short length, is also given the HC classification. That’s because this is the steepest road in the Serra da Mantiqueira, as once we get past the holiday camp at Paiol Grande, the road turns uphill for nosebleed-generating ascent, averaging almost 11% for just over 7km. This puts it in the realms of some seriously brutal ascents; Santuário del Acebo from Villarino de Limes (6,8km @ 11,7%), Alpe di Pampeago (7,8km @ 9,9%), Ermita de Alba (6,8km @ 11,1%), Kitzbüheler Horn-Alpenhaus (7,4km @ 11,7%) and the last part of Mont du Chat west (8,0km @ 10,4%). There’s a stretch of 3km averaging 13,5% in the middle of this, which is Bola del Mundo level. This might just be the hardest climb of the entire race.\n\nThe best thing? It’s totally ridable, as evidenced by this amateur tourist event. That basically shows you the final 30-35km of my stage, and a LOT of people walking most of the way up this brute, weaving side to side. As you can see, there’s a short plateau where road widens out then a further ascent to the true summit of the road (uncategorised but around 2km at 6,5% - just a little hidden bump with no respite having been had since the summit of the more difficult ascent - I guess this shape can give it something in common with Los Machucos, though it’s a little bit longer than that, and the traceur favourite Collfred - when descending from the Serra do Paiol to the village of Campinas, before we have a secondary ascent, on a narrower but well-paved road - 6,3km @ 5,0% in an inconsistent set of ramps to a Mirante overlooking Campos do Jordão not far from the Pico do Imbiri; this part of town is called Parque Imbiry as there is a park of that name (the difference between Imbiri and Imbiry as spellings is historic) so that’s the name I’ve given the climb.\n\nIt is my Aprica. Especially for a péloton such as you will find in many South American races, this will really be tough - 7km at 11% is no fun in anybody’s language, so having another uncategorised climb after that, then a mere 5,5km of respite before climbing again means that even though the climb is not that difficult, it could open unexpectedly large gaps, especially as it is inconsistent and includes a steepest kilometre at 10%. After all, that’s why Aprica works so well - after how far you have to go into the red just to survive on Mortirolo, trying to get the legs going to climb again even at those shallow gradients is harder than it ordinarily would be and so the climb opens up bigger gaps than it has any right to - I mean, just look at the 2015 Giro Rosa stage there, finishing at Aprica without Mortirolo. It’s basically an uphill sprint among the women’s péloton, which has smaller teams and fewer real climbers owing to a paucity of mountainous races! And just as Aprica produces more gaps than it has any right to, I would expect Imbiry to have similar potential to create gaps because of the brutality of the climb before. This is how to take advantage of weekend scheduling, ASO.\n\nBut… we’re still not done. The Alto de Imbiry is not the finish either - instead we’re still 5,3km from home, the first 3 of which are a descent into Campos do Jordão’s easternmost bairro. I could have put a couple of ramps in town here, but I think we’ve done enough for today on the climbing front - so it’s a 2km final ride with shallow turns along the Sapucaí river to finish by the Praça da Bandeira. I’m hoping for some Vuelta a Guatemala style chaos of cheering and confetti along a scenic semi-pedestrianised street like this.\n\nThis will be a day when the climbers really come out to play. The Colombians and potentially Venezuelans too should make their presence felt, especially as this will really be better suited to a featherweight who is adept at changing up and down the paces, because of the inconsistencies and the steepness of the penultimate climb. Grinding climbers like Magno Nazaret, Ilya Davidenok and Ricardo Mestre will be at a disadvantage - even perhaps the likes of Darwin Atapuma, whose best results are on longer and more consistent climbs - while the kind of riders who should be in their element - Amaro Antunes, Rodolfo Torres (2nd to Ermita de Alba, 5th to Neila, 9th to Camperona in his time), plus potentially some wildcard possibilities from Colombia and Venezuela - looking at Janier Acevedo, Aristobulo Cala, Roniel Campos, and Yecid Sierra. Plus we can wonder what kind of Kleber Ramos or João Gaspar we may see after their suspensions, should they choose to return, and there’s always Dani Díaz.\n\nWe should have a solid look at the shape of the GC after this one. We’ve had a couple of rouleur stages to break things up, a puncheur stage, a Unipuerto MTF to set the scene, a TTT, and now a good length ITT and a real decisive mountain stage. With only one day left until the second rest day, riders don’t need to worry too much about leaving something in reserve here - not that they should need to as a 7km @ 11% climb should be separating the men from the boys and the women from the girls in and of itself.\n\nStage 10: Interlagos (Autódromo José Carlos Pace) - Interlagos (Autódromo José Carlos Pace), 86km\n\nNow this is something a bit out there for a stage race, but it’s something that was basically an essential. Somewhat ironically given its purpose being for motor racing, the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in the southern São Paulo metropolitan area, in the district of Interlagos (which is what it is known as to the wider world) is one of the most frequently utilised locations for Brazilian cycling, possibly due to the ease of access, being in the wider São Paulo urban sprawl, and also being able to be accessed and utilised at any time of day without major disruption - the hiring costs for the circuit likely make this more cost beneficial than attempting to create a similar scale circuit on public roads (unless just using a single dual-carriageway road, like the Carioca version of the Copa América do Ciclismo, which didn’t last long) or the cost of the policing of a rolling roadblock across a lengthy point-to-point race. As a result, Interlagos frequently comes up in Brazilian cycling. This is a short potential banana skin of a stage with no mountains points at all, and a sub-100km length - we will undertake 20 laps of the 4,3km circuit for a total distance of 86km, with intermediate sprints coming after 10 and 15 laps and the feed zone after 12.\n\nOriginally purchased to be a housing development, the 1929 stock market crash led to the land being used for the instigation of a racetrack instead. Inspired by the Roosevelt Raceway layout, eventually more complex layouts rolling back on themselves were added until we had an 8km circuit with various sweeping corners and fast spoon-shaped curves which became a driver favourite after hosting its first Formula 1 event in 1972; this was a non-World Championship race won by Carlos Reutemann of Argentina; the event was successful and it was added to the World Championship calendar from 1973 onward, where it has remained ever since; initially it was part of the early season flyaway races, along with Buenos Aires, but since the early 2000s it has become one of the climactic end of season races - until the last few years when Abu Dhabi paid for the privilege - and as a result it has been responsible for some key championship-settling races, such as in 2007 where the internal strife at McLaren caused Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton to both throw the title away to Kimi Räikkönen, but the most famous would undoubtedly be 2008, when a battle between Brazil’s own Felipe Massa and Lewis Hamilton was thrown into chaos late on - Hamilton was in a comfortable position to win the title, only for weather conditions to worsen late on; changing to intermediate tyres, Hamilton struggled and was passed with fewer than 5 laps to go by rookie phenom Sebastian Vettel and, with the Toyota team gambling on the conditions holding off until the end of the race and staying on slicks, suddenly Massa was going to be the champion. Massa won the race, and his entourage, family and team were all celebrating, when the heavens opened causing the Toyotas to have to slow dramatically on the final lap; with the slick-shod cars having no grip at all trying to climb up the hill of the Subida dos Boxes, Lewis Hamilton passed the ailing Toyota of Timo Glock on the final corner to take 5th place and, with it, snatch the World Championship title. Back in the 1970s it was practically unique in Formula 1 for having an anticlockwise layout (several of the modern Tilkedromes share this feature, but back then Imola was the only other major circuit run that way), but it became popular with drivers and has since been a staple of the F1 calendar. In 1990 the course had to be revised into something approximating its modern form as the speed of the cars was becoming too much for it to be run safely anymore, with the layout meaning cars crashing at full speed could theoretically vault barriers and arrive on other parts of the circuit. The distance was halved and though there have been tweaks to the layout since, it has largely remained unchanged since.\n\nBecause of the presence of Interlagos, Brazil’s premier motor racing facility, so close at hand, São Paulo and its neighbouring bairros have given Brazil the majority of its great motorsport history - with one notable exception. While a few prospects had come from Brazil to compete at the highest level in its early days (Fritz d’Orey, for example), the late 60s and early 70s were the first golden age for them, and why Brazil came to host a Grand Prix in the first place. The first major champion was Emerson Fittipaldi, who followed his older brother Wilson into racing, and came into F1 in 1970 as an ersatz bonus driver with Lotus; he became a permanent driver after the death of team leader Jochen Rindt in Monza, and when he took a maiden race win at the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, this secured the title for Rindt, the only man to be crowned world champion posthumously. In 1972 Fittipaldi became the World Champion, and for over 30 years remained the youngest ever - a record which has since been broken by Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton and most recently Sebastian Vettel. In 1973 he felt that he was being usurped at Lotus by Ronnie Peterson, widely renowned as one of the greatest drivers to never win a championship, and moved to McLaren for 1974, where he took his second title. The following year he finished 2nd in the title race, before, in a shock move, suddenly jumping across to his brother’s Copersucar-sponsored vanity project team, and he sank into the midfield before retiring in 1980 to move to a management role. This couldn’t satisfy “Emmo” long, however, especially with such a poor car - Keke Rosberg was the team leader in 1981 and struggled to qualify; he became world champion when placed in a more competitive vehicle in 1982 - albeit that really is an outlier of a season in F1 history, with Villeneuve’s death, Pironi’s career ending injury, Paletti’s death, feuds between turbo and NA teams, rule changes mid-season, races boycotted and all manner of intrigue. Anyway: Fittipaldi moved to the states and had a career renaissance, racing with Roger Penske and being successful well into his 40s, winning the championship in 1989 and the Indy 500 in 1989 and 1993 - a very well-followed season globally, thanks to the surprise defection of Formula 1 World Champion Nigel Mansell - before being forced to retirement by a light aircraft accident at the age of 50.\n\nAt the same time as Emerson and his less successful brother Wilson (who did manage three F1 seasons, two with Brabham and one with his vanity project) came another pioneer of Brazilian motorsport, José Carlos Pace. He came from Italian stock, and his family moved back to Italy for several years before returning to Brazil, meaning he had a lot of trouble adapting as he had never had to learn Portuguese - his parents spoke Italian in the home and they had returned to Italy by the time he was in school. After dominating the Brazilian formula racing scene he followed the Fittipaldis to British F3, before coming under the wing of Frank Williams, who guided him through F2 to F1. After a couple of years of sporadic promise with Williams and Surtees, he found his home at Brabham, scoring a few podiums and taking a maiden race victory at his home race at the Autódromo de Interlagos, as it was then known. He started the 1977 season strongly, but became another of the sport’s “what might have been” stories, as he was killed in a plane crash just outside São Paulo in March. three races into the season at the age of 32. The Interlagos circuit was renamed in his honour in 1985, and carries that name to this day.\n\nWhile some further F1 drivers came out of the era, such as Ingo Hoffmann and Chico Serra, these were largely backmarkers, taking drives in the Brazilian-backed Copersucar/Fittipaldi Automotive enterprise, and the one major success story, Nelson Piquet, did not cut his teeth in São Paulo but instead at Jacarepaguá, the Rio-based circuit, for he was a Carioca, not a Paulista. Realistically, you all know where I’m going from here, and it’s arguably Brazil’s greatest non-footballing sports icon, a name and face known throughout the world, part of the greatest era of Formula 1 history in many historians’ eyes and its most recent “golden age”, and renowned by some, maybe many, as the greatest racing driver of all time: Ayrton Senna.\n\nStarting to race at Interlagos on a homemade go-kart at the age of 13, Senna qualified on pole and led most of his very first race, ahead of others on much more professional machinery and several years older. After dominating karting he moved into single-seaters and followed the Fittipaldis’ path via British formula racing in 1981, swiftly graduating through the levels, including winning the inaugural Macau Grand Prix, which helped establish that race’s role as the F3 equivalent of Indianapolis, Daytona, Bathurst or Monaco in terms of its prestige in that championship. A bidding war began for his services in 1984, but sponsor demands hurt his opportunities, with Brabham’s sponsors demanding an Italian driver and Lotus’ sponsors demanding a British one. Despite being in an absolutely woeful Toleman vehicle, Senna took the car kicking and screaming to three podiums, including one at a wet Monaco Grand Prix where he demonstrated his mastery of wet weather racing, moving from 13th on the grid to the podium on the notoriously narrow and hard-to-pass-on circuit, overtaking legends like Nelson Piquet and Niki Lauda on the way, and was catching race leader Prost at 4 seconds a lap when the race was red flagged for safety reasons. After moving to Lotus, he became a race winner - including one in the closest ever F1 finish, with Nigel Mansell, eating up the sweltering tarmac on fresh tyres, in the process of overtaking Senna when they crossed the line, but just too late. Moving to McLaren for 1988, one of the most iconic rivalries of Formula 1 history broke out as Senna and Prost feuded dramatically over supremacy; Prost, “the professor”, calculating, possibly (case could definitely be made for Schumacher) the “smartest” driver of all time in terms of isolating problems, working ways around them, and maximising his strategic opportunities, vs. Senna, the savant, capable of doing race length simulations and then telling the mechanics “on lap 34, on this corner, the car did this”, recalling precise details about car behaviour, and their battles became one of the cornerstones of the sport’s golden era.\n\nThe relationship between the two drivers fell apart very quickly. The 1988 Portuguese Grand Prix saw a series of early events that led to Senna nearly driving Prost into the pit wall at 180mph, but this was smoothed off as the dominant McLaren won 15/16 races that year - and the one they didn’t, it was because Williams’ substitute driver Jean-Louis Schlesser collected Senna when the latter was lapping him. Senna won the 1988 title, and in 1989 the relationship soured badly. Senna’s relationship with Honda that had been fostered at Lotus led to Prost and even team manager Ron Dennis to accuse the manufacturer of providing favourable engines to Senna, which the latter argued was not the case and if he had better vehicles it was likely to be due to his set-up feedback. He fought tooth and nail with Prost for the title coming up to Suzuka, when Prost made modifications to the car to make it faster off the start and in a straight line, knowing that Suzuka is a narrow circuit and hard to pass on. An increasingly desperate Senna tried to pass Prost into the last chicane, the Frenchman held firm, and the two teammates collided, coming to a halt side by side in the escape road, an iconic moment in F1 history. Senna was bump-started and re-entered the course, but was later disqualified because the escape road - part of the old Suzuka course - was not considered part of the track. Senna blamed FIA chief Jean-Marie Balestre of pressuring the stewards’ decision in order to favour fellow Frenchman Prost, with whom he had good relations, and Prost left the team for Ferrari the next year. Senna also claimed Balestre changed which side of the grid pole position was on, meaning Senna, the pole-sitter, was on the dirty, less grippy side of the track, thus aiding Prost’s start that moved him ahead.\n\nWith a new, less threatening teammate for 1990 in Gerhard Berger, Senna was the undisputed team leader, and he got on with the job of winning the title, which he duly did for the next two seasons. He even came to some rapprochement with Balestre (awarding him a race helmet at a gala), although the rift with Prost remained deep, even as the Frenchman retired after the 1991 season and the poor quality of early 90s Ferrari vehicles meant that it was no longer Prost but Nigel Mansell that was his greatest rival. In 1992, the Williams car was unstoppable, while Senna also found a new driver to be suspicious of - Benetton’s prodigiously gifted, but ruthless, young German Michael Schumacher. But while Senna’s talent meant he had always had a level of popularity, his relationship with Prost and the attitude it fostered meant that there was always a level of wariness with him. 1992, freed from the toxicity of his rivalry with Prost, is when this started to change and he went from being popular to beloved to iconic. Perhaps the biggest moment of that was in qualifying at Spa, when his incredible natural ear for car behaviour came to the rescue and he recognised in an instant that, after a bad accident at the blind left hander at Blanchimont, Erik Comas’ foot was still pressed hard to the floor, meaning the Belgian must have been unconscious at the wheel as the engine was being pumped with fuel. The reigning world champion got out of his car and ran through the path of other cars coming around the incident to shut the engine off and support Comas’ head in case of spinal injury.\n\nIn 1993, Senna was supposed to have moved to Williams, even volunteering to drive for free, but Prost’s returning to the sport and signing with the team put the kibosh on that; he instead stayed with McLaren, teamed with Michael Andretti, who came to F1 swapping places with Mansell. Andretti’s F1 tenure is regarded as one of the all-time flops, but posterity has been kinder, as it has been shown that the 1993 McLaren was an absolute dog of a car, which Senna dragged kicking and screaming to places it had no right to be. Nowhere was this more self-evident than at the European Grand Prix in Donington Park, where in changeable conditions, he caught and passed Michael Schumacher, Karl Wendlinger, Damon Hill and Alain Prost on a single lap - drivers who have 12 World Championships between them (Wendlinger obviously didn’t win one, but he was a big prospect at the time, having been paired with Schumacher and Heinz-Harald Frentzen in the Sauber C9 sportscars and being actually the fastest of the three much of the time; he didn’t adapt to F1 quite as well as Schumacher, and then his career was blighted by injuries). With no intermediate tyres back then, some drivers were changing up to 7 times to change from slicks to wets and back; Senna made fewer stops than anybody, set the fastest lap, and dominated the race throughout.\n\nThe following year many of the driver aids that had contributed to Williams’ dominance were banned, which Senna presciently suggested would cause accidents - the vehicles were too powerful and too reliant on electronics to not have risk attached when many of those management facilities were taken away. Senna noted after retiring from one GP that Benetton appeared to have a novel way of getting around this - their car sounded different and Senna concluded with his intuition that they must have traction control - and indeed later it was proven that Benetton had “overridden” traction control by moving it up the list of options until it was out of sight, but that it could still be engaged if a driver knew the code. It was just one of the ways Schumacher’s ’94 Benetton was suspicious (such as the removal of the fuel rig filter that meant pit stops were faster, but risked torching the driver, as later happened to Jos Verstappen), but here it just further explained Senna’s savant-like level of knowledge about the racing cars. And so we come to Imola 1994. The blackest weekend of modern F1 history, it could have been oh so much worse had Rubens Barrichello’s car not come to rest on top of the tyre wall on the Friday - if it hadn’t it would have gone into the fans. A day later, in a race to set a qualifying time, Roland Ratzenberger set off for one last Hail Mary in a car whose wing was more damaged by a previous off than expected, and it failed, torpedoing him into the concrete retaining wall at Villeneuve corner at 190mph and killing him instantly. Senna was keenly aware of the danger in the sport at the time and seemed highly concerned; Barrichello confirmed Senna was the first person he saw when he regained consciousness after the crash, and after news filtered round of Ratzenberger’s accident, the Brazilian commandeered an official vehicle to assess the scene. He even approached former mortal rival Prost about reforming the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association to fight for safety concerns, like Jackie Stewart had in the 70s. Ratzenberger’s death was the first since Elio de Angelis in 1986, and the first in a race since Ricardo Paletti in 1982; Formula One had been thought to now be pretty safe.\n\nBut while death had been raised as a spectre once more, Barrichello and Ratzenberger were both rookies, the latter in a low-budget team. That feeling of security was taken away once and for all on lap 7 of the ensuing Sammarinese Grand Prix when the same thing happened to the man widely regarded as the best driver on the grid, driving for the best team on it. Senna’s car bottomed out into Tamburello while leading the race, leaving him a helpless passenger as he stamped on the brakes, firing him into the concrete retaining wall at 145mph. Initial treatment took place by the side of the car due to the urgency of the situation, and he was airlifted to Bologna hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 18:40 CET. A furled Austrian flag was found in the car, which Senna had intended to raise to honour Ratzenberger at the end of the race. Within two days, Formula 1 had gone from feeling everybody was safe to realising nobody was.\n\nSenna’s death produced shockwaves through the sport in a way that I can’t recollect there being an equivalent of anywhere else in sport in my lifetime. Here we had a man who was almost universally regarded as the best on the current grid, one of the best of his or any other era, driving in an era where death wasn’t the constant spectre it had been when that fate befell the likes of Jim Clark or even Ronnie Peterson or Gilles Villeneuve. If it could happen to Senna, it could happen to anybody, was the feeling, and while obviously action would have been taken anyway following Ratzenberger’s death, the fact that of all people Ayrton Senna could be killed showed the sport that actually, things were not as safe as they seemed. Senna himself had said before the season that there would be a lot of accidents and that they would be lucky to escape without serious incident. Given what we know now, yes, those 1994 cars were death traps. The great tragedy is that it took people to actually die for that to be recognised.\n\nAs a national and global icon, Senna’s coffin was allowed to travel in the passenger cabin when escorted by his brother back to Brazil; 200.000 people went to pay their respects while his body lay in state, and over 3 million gathered to mourn the star. Pallbearers included almost every teammate he had had in Formula One - including, as a final act of respect and conciliation, Alain Prost - along with personal friends from the paddock. After his death it became public knowledge that he had - quietly and often under assumed names - donated millions of his personal fortune to aid poor children in São Paulo and created the framework for a charity which now bears his name. Main highways in both São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro bear his name, and several sections of race circuits have been named for him - including Jerez, Melbourne, Adelaide, the old Hockenheimring layout, Montréal, and three autodromes in Brazil, in Londrina, Caruaru and Goiânia. The karting circuit at Interlagos is named for him, as is perhaps the most famous Senna legacy corner, the Senna S which forms the first 2 corners of the Grand Prix layout.\n\nFurther racing drivers to come from São Paulo and cut their teeth here at Interlagos include 90s mid-grid stalwart Pedro Diniz, who was a reasonable driver who got a longer career than he perhaps merited due to personal sponsorships, but was better than the average ‘pay driver’ of 90s repute (there were some absolute stinkers out there, like Giovanni Lavaggi or Jean-Denis Délétraz); Christian Fittipaldi, son of Wilson and nephew of Emerson and now an established sportscar veteran; Rubens Barrichello, the man who has started more F1 Grand Prix than anybody else in history, is perhaps the most iconic “#2 driver” of all time, finished 2nd in the championship on several occasions and remains active to this day in Stock Car Brasil and really deserves more than a cursory mention, but given I’ve run into eight paragraphs on Senna, I’ve probably bored you all with motor racing now - plus in fairness, I followed F1 avidly in my childhood, but by the time we got to Schumacher’s reign of terror I’d switched off - Luciano Burti, a journeyman driver who had a cup of coffee in F1 and is now Brazilian TV’s main analyst on motorsport; Hélio Castro Neves, an Indycar veteran and three-time Indy 500 winner; former Champ Car racer Mário Haberfeld; Stock Car specialist Ricardo Maurício; Felipe Massa, who like Barrichello probably deserves a bit more than a cursory mention, having missed out on the title in front of his home fans and family in such dramatic circumstances mentioned above, and is a long-standing stalwart of F1 still active in Formula E; J.P. Oliveira, who won SuperFormula in Japan in 2010 and is an ever-present in Super GT (the best motor racing format in my opinion); Tuka Rocha, a Stock Car Brasil veteran who was tragically killed in a light aircraft crash last year; Gustavo Sondermann, another Stock Car Brasil driver who died young, this time in an accident at Interlagos in 2011; former F1 test driver Danilo Dirani; ex-F1 star Lucas di Grassi; former A1GP competitor Sérgio Jiménez; Bia Figueiredo, sports- and Stock Car pilot who spent four years in Indycar under her forenames Ana Beatriz; sports car specialist Pipo Derani, and of course Ayrton’s nephew, Bruno Senna, who was a highly-touted prospect but who gave up the sport after his uncle’s death; while he went back into the sport and has had a reasonable level of success - 3 years of F1 and 2 seasons of Formula E - the family connection has always been both a blessing and a curse for him, although he has settled to a decent role in endurance racing. For a nice bit of symmetry Rebellion Racing placed him in the same car as Alain Prost’s son Nicolas in 2017 - just a shame they couldn’t get Nelson Piquet Jr to complete the lineup.\n\n“Libertine, for crying out loud, this is a bike racing site. We want to hear about bikes, not eulogies to long-dead racing drivers!” I get it. But Interlagos needs the scene setting, and it’s hard to not talk about motor racing when your circuit is, in fact, a motor racing circuit. And I got a bit carried away talking about Ayrton Senna, I know. I was a child when he died. I cared far too much about motor racing at that age. I don’t remember the crash. I remember the wreckage of the car and them trying to treat him by the side of it. I remember the helicopter coming in. I remember my mum breaking the news to me. That’s “my era” so to speak.\n\nBut back to bike racing: Interlagos is very, very popular with Brazilian cycling. The Copa América do Ciclismo was instituted in 2001, and a year later moved to Interlagos; it stayed there, save for one year on an out-and-back course in the Flamengo district of Rio, until 2011. Nilceu Santos won four on the spin from 2005 to 2008. From 2002 to 2006 and from 2008 to 2013, the Prova Ciclística 9 Julho also took place on the circuit - over an 86km distance with 20 laps of the circuit exactly as I am doing here. It has also at various times in the past taken place at the circuit, as you can see from events back in 1984, on the old 8km circuit. Here's a short piece on the history of the event. Since they brought the race to the reprofiled 4,3km circuit in 2002, the otherwise dominator of Interlagos Nilceu Santos only managed the one win, but Francisco Chamorro has 2 wins at Interlagos (+ another Prova 9 Julho win on a different course more recently) in this race to go with one in the Copa América. Rafa Andriato also won in 2007 at the age of 20. Roberto Pinheiro is also an active rider to have won the Prova here at Interlagos. From 2012 to 2014 we also had the GP São Paulo (this was while it was UCI-registered, as the elite riders ran separately from the amateurs in the Prova 9 Julho), with Chamorro, Pinheiro and Flávio Cardoso the winners. In 2008, the Autódromo also hosted stage 1 of the Volta do São Paulo, with Edgardo Simón winning the stage.\n\nOutside of pro races, Interlagos also hosts a timed 3 hour race as part of the Bike Series of amateur events, there is a Red Bull Ride eve"
