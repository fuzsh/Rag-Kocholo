        "text": "[FONT=&quot]19 MARCH[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 2 of 2\n\nin 1987 - Tony Stratton-Smith, sports writer turned record industry mogul, the avuncular founded independent British label Charisma Records in 1969, dies. Nicknamed \"Strat,\" he was initially drawn to the music industry by his friends Kit Lambert and Brian Epstein. Stratton-Smith had previously written about soccer for several British newspapers including The Daily Express and after writing several football biographies he continued to edit a soccer yearbook into the Seventies, using the profits to help fund Charisma.\n\nHe also wrote the book The Rebel Nun about South American martyr Mother Maria Skobtzova who was stabbed during a pursuit of Nazi war criminal Martin Boorman who was alleged to have survived World War II and gone into hiding in South America. After first dabbling in music publishing, Stratton-Smith switched to artist management, overseeing the trio Paddy, Klaus & Gibson who were taken over by his friend Brian Epstein. Stratton-Smith also managed Creation, The Koobas and Beryl Marsden. Undeterred by their limited success, Stratton-Smith launched his own label, Charisma Records, and henceforth became known as a generous patron of talented rock musicians whose work was not necessarily in line with commercial trends. If \"Strat\" believed in an artist there were few lengths to which he would not go to secure their ultimate success, an attitude that endeared him to many in the industry.\n\nSigning a host of groups, the label's first success came in 1970 with The Nice, led by keyboard player Keith Emerson. They were followed by Newcastle-based folk rockers Lindisfarne, and public school progressive rockers Genesis, both of whom were initially managed by \"Strat\". Charisma thrived with a small stable of acts that also included Van Der Graaf Generator, Rare Bird, Bell 'N Arc and Audience. Charisma also released records by the Monty Python's Flying Circus comedy team, the poet Sir John Betjeman and sports broadcasters Peter O'Sullivan and John Arlott. The signing of O'Sullivan, doyen of horse racing commentators, reflected Stratton-Smith's keen interest in the turf. At one time he owned a string of racehorses and sponsored a Charisma Handicap Stakes race at Kempton Park, west of London. Charisma also launched a literary division, publishing poetry and music related books, and had a stake in the music magazine Zig Zag. By the Eighties, the label had added Hawkwind, Julian Lennon and Malcolm McLaren to their roster but \"Strat\" was tiring of the music industry and devoting more and more of his time to racing.\n\nA year before his death Stratton-Smith sold Charisma Records to Virgin Records founder Richard Branson for £4,000,000, largely on the strength of the Genesis catalogue and his contracts with Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. Retiring to the Canary Islands as a tax exile, he opened a nightclub called The Final Crease. (Stomach cancer). He died while visiting the English Channel island of Jersey. His ashes were scattered over Newbury Racecourse in Southern England, and that afternoon one of Strat's horses, Sergeant Smoke, romped home at odds of 20–1.\n\nin 1989 - Alan Civil dies at age 59. English French horn player; he was engaged by Thomas Beecham to play second horn to Dennis Brain in the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, when Brain left for the Philharmonia, Alan took over leadership of the section. In 1955, he joined the Philharmonia himself, becoming principal horn player when Brain died in a car crash in 1957. In the 1960s, Alan became the first non-German to be approached by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra to become a member, but he stayed with the Philharmonia, who were reshaping themselves into the New Philharmonia. In 1966 he became principal hornist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, remaining there until his retirement in 1988. As a soloist, Civil recorded the horn concertos of Mozart, and his recording of Benjamin Britten's Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings with Robert Tear is also quite well known. He also played chamber music in the Alan Civil Horn Trio. Alan He was awarded an OBE in 1985\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0bgndfegTE\"]YouTube - Alan Civil plays the Mozart Horn Concertos part 4 of 6\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube - Alan Civil plays the Mozart Horn Concertos part 4 of 6[/ame]\n\nin 1990 - Andrew Wood dies at age 24.

As a vocalist he first gained fame as a member of the popular Fifties doo-... group, The \"5\" Royales. Born in the Winston-Salem area of North Carolina, Paul initially joined several family members, including brother Lowman, in a family gospel group, The Royal Sons Quintet. With Apollo Records showing interest in the group, the renamed Royal Sons released two well-received singles in 1951.\n\nBut with the label wanting a more rocking sound, the group emerged as a secular R&B band, The \"5\" Royales. Following the release of their début non-religious single 'Too Much Of A Little Bit', Clarence Pauling left the group. Paul then joined a pair of leading gospel groups, Wings Over Jordan and The Coleman Brothers. Then, after serving in the Korean War, Paul pursued a solo R&B career in the late Fifties, recording for Federal, Roulette, and Hanover Records, and though Paul was unsuccessful as a solo act, his material received airplay via popular cover versions by Roy Hamilton and Hank Ballard. Inspired by his successes, he moved to Detroit to work as a full-time songwriter, and shortened his last name from \"Pauling\" to \"Paul\".\n\nThere, he frequently aided neighbour Steveland Morris (later known as Stevie Wonder) in his musical pursuits. Both Wonder and Paul signed to Motown Records where Paul assumed production and songwriting duties, overseeing Wonder's 'Fingertips' and 'Hey Love', and working with Marvin Gaye. Paul and Wonder also scored a duet hit in 1966 with a cover of Dylan's 'Blowin' In The Wind'; the pair later penned Aretha Franklin's hit 'Until You Come Back To Me'.

He raced Speedcars at the Rowley Park Speedway at Bowden, which he also managed from 1954 to 1973. - Born September 15th 1920. 19 March.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 – David Parland, Swedish metal guitarist, best known for his work in the bands Dark Funeral, Necrophobic and Infernal, in all of which he was one of the founding members, comits sucide at age 43.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was a member of Necrophobic from its inception in 1989, but quit the band in 1995 to concentrate on Dark Funeral, which he was one of the main founding members of in 1993. Prior to leaving Necrophobic he had, however, written most of the material for the next album. The album Darkside, with Parland's material intact, was released by Necrophobic in 1997, although Parland himself did not participate as a musician on the album.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Parland also ran the small underground cult record label Hellspawn Records from 1994 to 2002, releasing albums from bands such as Abruptum and his own Dark Funeral, with distribution by House of Kicks, VME and Sound Pollution. After leaving Dark Funeral in 1996, Parland founded the bands War and Infernal. While having kept a low profile and not being actively involved in any bands since the second line-up of Infernal broke up in 2003, Parland announced in January 2009 that he was working on new material with drummer Tomas Asklund (Gorgoroth, Dissection, ex-Dark Funeral). Demos and a full-length album were to be recorded during 2009. In March 2009 it was revealed that the band would be a continuation of Parland's old band Infernal. An EP from the band was finally released on May 1, 2010, entitled \"The Infernal Return\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In an interview from October, 2012, David Parland explained the reasons why Infernal went inactive right after the new EP, which included bad financial circumstances, Parland getting arrested, and being sent to a psychiatric district for \"detoxification purposes\". According to the interview, Parland got a neck injury in a car crash several years before and only resorted to using painkillers. He eventually became addicted. Also, Parland revealed that Infernal had parted ways for good with drummer Tomas Asklund. Parland was planning on searching for a pro black/death/heavy metal drummer for the recording of the long planned and long awaited full-length \"THE INFERNAL RETRIBUTION\". The album was intended to be released in late 2013 according to this interview.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Infernal never recorded the long awaited full length album and was ultimately terminated. In reaction to the news of Parland's death, former band mate Lord Ahriman said, \"During the last couple of weeks, I was in close contact with David. He was going through an extremely difficult time of life, whereof he contacted me to ask for my help. Even though the two of us had a bit of a complicated relationship over the years (much excessive in the media though), he knew that he could ALWAYS call or visit me when needed, which he also did once in a while. Last time I talked to him was when he called me on March 15. From what I could understand, things were going in the right direction... What happened after that I simply can't understand... I cant understand WHY he didn't call me [again.]\" [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was a self-described misanthrope and harbored contempt for organized religion and \"political correctness\", as well as \"slave mentality\" and other mindsets which oppose individualism. He agreed with many aspects of Satanic thought, but did not consider himself religious.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 – Seijin Noborikawa ([/FONT][FONT=&quot]登川誠仁[/FONT][FONT=&quot] Noborikawa Seijin?), born in Uruma, Okinawa, was a master Okinawan musician and min'yō folk singer, and a headliner of the Utanohi music festival. Dies at age 80.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Nicknamed \"Seigwa\" he was widely regarded as the greatest living singer of traditional Okinawan songs, following the death of his mentor Rinsho Kadekaru. Seigwa was active musically right up until the end of last year when his final recording was the album Duet which he made with Misako Oshiro.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In earlier times he was also known as the Jimi Hendrix of the sanshin for his fast playing style. A compilation album of his best recordings from 1975 to 2004 was released to commemorate his 75th birthday but he then went on to release two further studio albums – Suiko Jizai (2008) and Fountain of Songs (2010) – as well as a live double album and the duet with Oshiro last year. His popularity increased after his starring role as an actor in the Okinawan-set movie Nabbie no Koi and in a subsequent film Hotel Hibiscus. Seigwa will be remembered too for his playful onstage personality and for his willingness to support younger musicians.[/FONT]\n\nSomething extra for readers of On This Day in Music, because of its relevance to Noborikawa and its thoughtful comments on music and its place in life.\n\n[FONT=&quot]From the Japan Times a mini-essay by Stephen Mansfield[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Sound waves: the music of Okinawa[/FONT]\n\nFirst published 9 May 2015.\n\n[FONT=&quot]How is it possible that a people who have experienced poverty, famine and discrimination, outlasted efforts at cultural annihilation and suffered the indignities of occupation can manage to celebrate life in song and dance with a passion and joy that belies everyday reality?[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Music for Okinawans is, perhaps, an alternative reality, one that is no less authentic than the roar of fighter jets over residential districts, or the sense of entitlement that characterizes Tokyo and Washington's dealings with these southern islands. Like the swallowtail butterflies that flutter above the razor wire surrounding the U.S. base camps, Okinawans have learned to coexist with menace without being ensnared by it.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]There is something hopeful, even redemptive, about cultures on the peripheries. While pitying Okinawans their relentless suffering, we envy them for the beauty of their culture, the profound spirituality that pervades their daily lives and the abiding presence of their music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Music has always played an important role in the lives of these islanders. Much of the social life of the royal court revolved around the composition and performance of music and poetry. Less urbane musical forms were enjoyed by commoners and peasants. Engelbert Kaempfer, a Dutch scholar, wrote in 1690 of Okinawans, \"diverting themselves after their work is done, with a glass of rice beer, and playing upon their musical instruments which they for this purpose carry out with them into the fields.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The so-called Okinawa boom of the 1990s sprang from a felicitous conjunction of interest among young Japanese in the culture, food, nature and lifestyles of Asia, and releases by a vanguard of musicians and groups — prominent among them the Rinken Band, Shokichi Kina and Champloose, and Nenes — who have helped to popularize the Okinawa sound in mainland Japan and bring it into the ranks of world music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The fusion of traditional Okinawan instruments such as the three-stringed sanshin, samba (a type of castanet) and percussive instruments such as shima-daiko (island drums) and handheld paranku drums with electric guitars, synthesizers, violins and saxophones, has resulted in a lively champuru, or blend, of rock, jazz and reggae elements played with great verve, but underpinned by distinctly Okinawan rhythms, tints and flavors. Incorporating tradition into new forms, the question of which music is authentic, which creolized, tends to dissolve in each performance.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Musicians have evolved from fusion to collaboration, with several successful musical experiments involving well-known foreign musicians such as Ry Cooder, Bob Brozman, Jiang Jian Hua and Irish fiddler Nollaig Casey. A fine example of this tendency is a CD by American jazz pianist Geoffrey Keezer, who teamed up to make a highly original album with Yasukatsu Oshima, a respected singer, sanshin player and arranger.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The man responsible for bringing these two gifted musicians together was Okinawa resident John Potter, a music journalist whose book, \"The Power of Okinawa: Roots Music from the Ryukyus,\" remains the standard work on the subject. Potter would be the first to agree that Oshima is no protest writer, but on his performance trip to Ireland in 2001, he sensed parallels in Ireland-England relations between Okinawa and mainland Japan. He has been quoted as saying, \"the history of Ireland-England relations reminded me of Okinawa-Yamato relations,\" noting that the music of Ireland and his own home were \"born out of hardship.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Resistance music in Okinawa devolved from older generations of performers with their own period grievances. The folk song \"Mayagwa\" (\"Little Cat\"), for example, mocks a government official's visit from the court in Shuri, while the experiences of the Battle of Okinawa find expression in a number of songs. Many compositions call for the preservation of Okinawan identity in the face of efforts at cultural assimilation from mainland Japan. Others are specific in highlighting violence against Okinawans, occupation, and the land grabs associated with the presence of U.S. and Japanese military forces throughout the islands. Shokichi Kina, much preoccupied with minority rights, environmental issues, world peace, and questions of identity, felt compelled to write the song \"Shojo no Namida ni Niji ga Kakaru Made\" (\"Until a Rainbow Appears Around a Young ....'s Tears\") after three U.S. Marines abducted and ..... a 12-year-old Okinawan .... in September 1995.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Daiku Tetsuhiro's reworking of a protest song from the 1950s, \"Okinawa o Kaese\" (\"Return Okinawa\"), is interesting in its telling inversion of title. The original song called for a return of the islands, then under U.S. occupation, to Japanese rule. The line \"Return Okinawa to Japan\" was changed by Daiku in his 1994 version, to \"Okinawa e Kaese\" — \"Return Okinawa to Okinawans.\" Such sentiments are echoed in the compositions of other Okinawan musicians like the late Seijin Noborikawa, known for his dexterity with the sanshin and his anti-war songs.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A more humorous, good-natured treatment of pressing cultural and ethnic questions is apparent in the lyrics of Kadekaru Rinsho's song \"Jidai no Nagare\" (\"The Flow of Time\"). First recorded in the 1960s, the song highlights an inability to staunch a passage of time orchestrated by powerful outside forces:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]From the Chinese period[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]To the Japanese one[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Japanese period to the American[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Okinawa really does change.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The song also reflects an optimism stemming from an assertion of unassailable Okinawan identity.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Many musicians prefer to take a more moderate stand, eschewing the perception of Okinawa as a garrison island. In their song \"Yu-Yu-Yu/You-You-You,\" Rinken Band invoke the Chinese, Japanese and American periods, but inveigh islanders with the message, \"The world might change / Everything might change / But don't lose your gentle kindness.\" The group's leader, the unflappably optimistic Teruya Rinken, has defined his music as a celebration of life, one \"negating war and acts of violence and killing.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the song \"American Dori,\" performed by the immensely popular all-female Nenes, the group sings rapturously of Koza (Okinawa City), host to Kadena air base. In their vision, its streets are invigorated by a diversity of people and music:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]America Road at twilight[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Rock, shima-uta, rap, reggae[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Our home, Koza town[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mixed together, mixed up[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Even the maddening sound of fighter planes scrambling overhead is defused in the lines, \"Clouds of jet exhaust, like lines being dragged / Painting images in the sky.\" In this song, Koza, a front line of resistance, scene of a notorious riot and of ongoing resentments against American military hegemony, is a fabulist town of psychedelic colors, exotic people and stores, a borderless urban realm, where \"dreams and romance spill out.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Music as self-differentiation, of course, does not have to be political. For the mainland audiences that cram into the small clubs along Kokusai-dori, Naha's main shopping and entertainment drag, the music is an adjunct to the \"exotic\" and \"ethnic\" appeal of the islands. The performers, who know exactly how to please the crowds, are complicit in creating floorshows that provide an entertaining digest of Okinawan music, one inevitably climaxing in members of the audience rising to their feet to take part in the orchestrated abandon of the katcharsee, a traditional celebratory dance.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Being from Okinawa is not necessarily synonymous with playing Okinawan music. You would be hard pressed to identify any Okinawan themes in the music of Kiroro, a female duo, or contemporary bands such as Orange Range, the punk outfit Mongol800 or pop icon Amuro Namie. There are several artists who don't appear to fit into the Okinawan music scene, but are nonetheless, a part of it, like the young poet and rapper Akiko Urasaki, better known as Awich. When you hear that she famously left her Tokyo record label because they wouldn't allow her lyrics to touch on politics, the Okinawa connection suddenly crystalizes.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Okinawa is proving to be an interesting testing ground for hybridity, multiculturalism and community bonding. In the final scene of the 1999 Okinawan film, \"Nabbie no Koi,\" the cast, joined by villagers, dance the katcharsee, representing the cycles of life. The film features a number of towering figures in the local music world, including the late Rinsho Kadekaru and Misako Oshiro, regarded by many as the foremost living female singer in Okinawa. Oshiro's club, Shima Umui, tucked into a basement in the earthy Higashimachi district of Naha, could not be more removed from the music venues of Kokusai-dori (International Street).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Inevitably, one gravitates back to the animated vulgarity of Kokusai-dori's glittery clubs and live houses. So it was that I found myself once again at a table in Chakra, Shokichi Kina's musical nerve center, listening to his band run through a familiar set of favorites that included \"Hana,\" a song that must be known to almost everyone in Asia. Kina took the opportunity between songs to give pep talks on Okinawan politics, urging his message of peace, universal values and Okinawan rights.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]As I leave the club, an attendant, who only minutes before had been pounding a drum and cavorting like a demon, thrusts an adhesive seal into my hands. Its simple message reads, \"Subete no bukki o gakki ni\": \"Exchange weapons for musical instruments.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In a place as immensely complex as this, everything seems just a little simpler when musicians pick up their instruments.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Voices of exile[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Along the narrow lanes at the periphery of Naha's great Makeshi Market, snatches of Spanish and Portuguese are heard from food and clothing vendors, who turn out to be of Okinawan ancestry, but to hail from such distant places as Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Many Okinawans had little choice but to emigrate to South America, Hawaii, and Japanese occupied territories at the end of the 19th century, a diaspora that continued until after World War II. At the edge of the market, I stumble across a photo exhibition on the Okinawan experience in South America. Someone had just come in and recognized their long lost uncle in an old sepia-tinted image.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]More than 300,000 Okinawans and their descendants now live abroad. Okinawan ancestry was never forgotten or relinquished by immigrants, the continuity of ties maintained through ritual, memory and the transmission of music and song. In the Okinawan repertoire there are narratives concerning displacement, exile and return. In songs such as \"Nanyo Ko-uta\" (\"The South Seas\"), \"Ikawu\" (\"I'm Leaving\") and \"Imin\" (\"Emigration\"), we sense the mixture of sorrow and optimism, of severance and opportunity at departing from the homeland.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]When people are unable to return because of age or infirmity, younger members of the family act as proxies, emissaries reuniting the ancestors with their homeland. Such is the case with Lucy Nagamine, a Peruvian singer and sanshin player of Okinawan descent, who has lived in these islands for the past 20 years.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Her relatives, with no Spanish skills, were fortunate to be spared the grueling labor of the sugar cane and fruit plantations, by setting themselves up as small merchants, empresarios serving the daily needs of the Okinawan community living in Lima. Marveling at the absence of discrimination in her ancestral home, Nagamine describes Okinawans as a warm people, with second and third generation nisei and sansei embraced as the returning offspring of the immigrant diffusion.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Arriving in Japan to take part in a singing concourse in Mie Prefecture, Nagamine won the first prize, inspiring her to stay in Japan. Growing up in Peru, she had learned Uchinaguchi, the Okinawan language, but did not speak or understand Japanese. Enjoying the creative atmosphere of working with other Okinawan musicians in the studio, she has recorded three albums to date. The first, \"Ninufabushi\" (\"North Star\"), concerns filial love, the bonds that connect people. The last track is a version of the first song she learned from her Peruvian aunt when she was 10 years old. Her last album, \"Hiyamikachi,\" which means something like \"Get back on your feet,\" is a collection of upbeat, eminently danceable pieces. The songs in Japanese and Uchinaguchi are interspersed by lyrics that she has translated into Spanish. These classic Okinawan pieces have been well received, not only in her native Peru, but also by Okinawan audiences.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Even well-respected recording artists, however, are obliged on occasion to perform in quite modest venues in Okinawa. Led to a table at Syurei Soba, a popular lunchtime restaurant in Akamine, a downtown district of Naha, I note that most of the diners appear to be families.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]When Nagamine and guitarist, singer and collaborator Nao Nishimata, begin their set, the clamor of voices drops for a moment before resuming. Tables are served, orders bellowed out, dishes and trays clattered. The audience can be said to be appreciative but preoccupied. Half the infants in the audience are spellbound by the music; the other half, scream their heads off. These are the conditions under which many musicians gamely perform.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Nagamine's set is well worth listening to. For someone who is so soft-spoken and self-effacing in person, she sings with surprising power and authority. The duo proceed through a two-hour repertoire of songs of heart-rending beauty, though there are also lighter pieces, like the popular \"Haisai Ojisan,\" whose lyrics evoke Naha's sleazy red light district of Nakajima. For some people in the audience, the music simply represents an analogous background to being Okinawan; for others, of a more serious incline, the songs are the soundboard on which they define themselves as Okinawans.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]It is not clear whether the pair are struggling artists, but few Okinawan musicians are wealthy. Fortunately, they have a brisk working schedule. Performing in the restaurant four times a week, there are also club gigs and festivals in Okinawa as well as Tokyo, Osaka and other parts of mainland Japan. They also host a weekly music program on FM Uruma.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Nagamine's existence as an artist proves the point that music transcends time, space and distance better, perhaps, than any of the performing arts. Music and identity are seldom as closely related as they are in Okinawa. Nagamine may not be an immigrant or exile per se, but, in her work and person, she embodies the return to the homeland of memory, family attachments and the songs of childhood.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]END OF [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Sound waves: the music of Okinawa[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2015 – Peter Roy Katin (/[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ˈ[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ke[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ɪˌ[/FONT][FONT=&quot]t[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ɪ[/FONT][FONT=&quot]n/ KAY-tin) British classical pianist and pedagogue, dies at age 84.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Katin was born in London; his father was sign-painter Jerrold Katin (who was born in Lithuania) and mother Gertrude.

Katin made his debut at the Wigmore Hall on 13 December 1948 where the programme included works by Scarlatti, Mozart, Beethoven, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin and Chopin. He went on to give concerts in England, Europe, Africa, the USA, and Japan.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1952, Katin debuted at The Proms and in 1953 was acclaimed for his performance there of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor.

He was of noble Spanish descent and was a baron in his own right. During the revolution of 1708, he was an officer in the Palermo municipal guard. After a sojourn in Vienna (1712-14), he served as a senator in Palermo.\n\nIn 1744 he settled in Spain in the service of the king. Among his works were the operas La moglie nemica (Palermo, 1698), Dafni (Genoa, April 21, 1709), and Amor tirannico (Venice, 1710), a Stabat Mater (Oxford, 1752), his best-known work, and more than 150 cantatas.

He conducted the Concert Spirituel during the Revolution (1789-91), then left France and went to Germany. In 1801 he emigrated to Russia, where he served as first violinist in the Imperial Orchestra in St. Petersburg. He composed 2 symphonies. concertantes for 2 Violins, 6 sonatas for Clavecin, with Violin, violin concertos, and other works for violin. - Died St. Petersburg, March 20, 1802.\n\nin 1757 - Johann Paul Kunzen, composer, dies at 60\n\nin 1774 - John Braham (real name, Abraham), renowned English tenor, is born at London. He studied with Leoni in London, with Rauzzini in Bath, and with Isola in Genoa. He made his debut at Covent Garden (April 21,1787); then appeared at Drury Lane in 1796, in the opera Mahmoud by Storace. He was subsequently engaged to sing at the Italian Opera House in London. In 1798 he undertook an extensive tour in Italy, and also appeared in Hamburg. Returning to England in 1801, he was increasingly successful.\n\nEndowed with a powerful voice of 3 octaves in compass, he knew no difficulties in operatic roles. He was the original Huon in Weber's Oberon (1826). As a ballad writer, he was very popular; he wrote much of the music for the operatic roles which he sang; often he added portions to operas by other composers, as in The Americans (1811), with its famous song The Death of Nelson; contributed incidental music to 12 productions.\n\nIn 1831 he entered upon a theatrical business venture; he acquired the Colosseum in Regent's Park; in 1836 he had the St. James's Theatre built, but failed to recoup his investment and lost much of his considerable fortune. He made an American tour from 1840 to 1842 despite the weakening of his voice with age; however, his dramatic appeal remained undiminished and he was able to impress the American public in concert appearances.

He was of a musical family; his grandfather was an amateur pianist, a pupil of John Field, and his father also played the piano; Rachmaninoff's Polka was written on a theme improvised by his father; his mother likewise played piano, and it was from her that he received his initial training at their estate, Oneg, near Novgorod.\n\nAfter financial setbacks, the family estate was sold and he was taken to St. Petersburg, where he studied piano with Vladimir Demiansky and harmony with Alexander Rubets at the Conservatory (1882-85); acting on the advice of his cousin, Alexander Siloti, he enrolled as a piano student of Nikolai Zverev at the Moscow Conservatory (1885); then entered Siloti's piano class and commenced the study of counterpoint with Taneyev and harmony with Arensky (1888).\n\nHe met Tchaikovsky, who appreciated his talent and gave him friendly advice. He graduated as a pianist (1891) and as a composer (1892), winning the gold medal with his opera Aleko, after Pushkin. Then followed his Prelude in C-sharp minor (1892); published that same year, it quickly became one of the most celebrated piano pieces in the world. His 1st Symphony, given in Moscow (1897), proved a failure, however. Discouraged, Rachmaninoff destroyed the MS, but the orchestra parts were preserved; after his death, the score was restored and performed in Moscow (1945). In the meantime, Rachmaninoff launched a career as a piano virtuoso; also took up a career as a conductor, joining the Moscow Private Russian Orchestra (1897). He made his London debut in the triple capacity of pianist, conductor, and composer with the Phil. Soc. (1899).\n\nAlthough he attempted to compose after the failure of his 1st Symphony, nothing significant came from his pen. Plagued by depression, he underwent treatment by hypnosis with Nikolai Dahl, and then began work on his 2nd Piano Concerto. He played the first complete performance of the score with Siloti conducting in Moscow (Nov. 9, 1901); this concerto became the most celebrated work of its genre written in the 20th century, and its singular charm has never abated since; it is no exaggeration to say that it became a model for piano concertos by a majority of modern Russian composers, and also of semi-popular virtuoso pieces for piano and orchestra written in America.\n\nOn May 12,1902, Rachmaninoff married his cousin Natalie Satina; they spent some months in Switzerland, then returned to Moscow. After conducting at Moscow's Bolshoi Theater (1904-06), he decided to spend most of his time in Dresden, where he composed his 2nd Symphony, one of his most popular works. Having composed another major work, his 3rd Piano Concerto, he took it on his first tour of the U.S. in 1909. His fame was so great that he was offered the conductorship of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, but he declined; the offer was repeated in 1918, but once again he declined. He lived in Russia from 1910 until after the Bolshevik Revolution of Oct. 1917, at which time he left Russia with his family, never to return.\n\nFrom 1918 until 1939 he made annual tours of Europe as a pianist; also of the U.S. (from 1918 until his death), where he spent much of his time; he also owned a villa in Lucerne (1931-39), and it was there that he composed one of his most enduring scores, the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini (1934). In 1932 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society of London. After the outbreak of World War II (1939), he spent his remaining years in the U.S. He became a naturalized American citizen a few weeks before his death, having made his last appearance as a pianist in Knoxville, Term., on Feb. 15, 1943.\n\nAmong Russian composers, Rachmaninoff occupies a very important place. The sources of his inspiration lie in the Romantic tradition of 19th-century Russian music; the link with Tchaikovsky's lyrical art is very strong; melancholy moods prevail and minor keys predominate in his compositions, as in Tchaikovsky's; but there is an unmistakable stamp of Rachmaninoff's individuality in the broad, rhapsodic sweep of the melodic line, and particularly in the fully expanded sonorities and fine resonant harmonies of his piano writing; its technical resourcefulness is unexcelled by any composer since Liszt.\n\nDespite the fact that Rachmaninoff was an emigre and stood in avowed opposition to the Soviet regime (until the German attack on Russia in 1941 impelled him to modify his stand), his popularity never wavered in Russia; after his death, Russian musicians paid spontaneous tribute to him. Rachmaninoff's music is much less popular in Germany, France, and Italy; on the other hand, in England and America it constitutes a potent factor on the concert stage. – Died at Beverly Hills, March 28, 1943.\n\nin 1873 - Adolfe Louis Eugene Fetis, composer, dies at 52.\n\nin 1874 - Hans Christian Lumbye, composer, dies at 63.\n\nin 1883 - Karl Hasse, composer is born.\n\nin 1890 - Lauritz Melchior, Copenhagen Denmark, baritone tenor (Natl Symphony) is born.\n\nMelchior was a Danish and later American opera singer. He was the pre-eminent Wagnerian tenor of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, and has since come to be considered the quintessence of his voice type.\n\nBorn Lauritz Lebrecht Hommel Melchior in Copenhagen, Denmark, the young Melchior was a boy soprano and amateur singer before starting his first operatic vocal studies under Paul Bang at the Royal Opera School in Copenhagen at the age of 18 in 1908.\n\nIn 1913, Melchior made his debut in the baritone role of Silvio in Ruggiero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci at the Royal Theatre (Det Kongelige Teater) in Copenhagen. He sang mostly secondary baritone and bass roles for the Royal Danish Opera and provincial Scandianavian opera companies for the next few years.\n\nOne night, while on tour, Melchior helped an ailing soprano performing in Il trovatore by singing a high C in the Act IV Leonora-di Luna duet. The Azucena of that performance, the American contralto Mme Charles Cahier, was impressed by the tone she had heard and gave her young colleague sound advice: he was no baritone, but a tenor \"with the lid on.\" She even wrote to the Royal Opera pleading that Melchior be given a sabbatical and a stipend to restudy his voice. This he did between 1917 and 1918, taking lessons from the noted Danish tenor Vilhelm Herold (1865-1937) who had sung Wagnerian roles in Covent Garden, Chicago and elsewhere from 1900 to 1915. This proved to be a turning point in Melchior's career. His high baritone voice was recast into that of a low tenor, but with a strong high extension. His second debut was on 8 October, 1918 in the title role of Tannhäuser, also at the Royal Opera in Copenhagen.\n\nIn 1920, Melchior visited England to sing in an experimental radio broadcast to the Scandinavian capital cities from the Marconi station in Chelmsford. From 1920, Melchior was a frequent performer in London, appearing at Sir Henry Joseph Wood's Promenade Concerts in Queens Hall. While at London he met the popular novelist and passionate Wagnerite Hugh Walpole, who provided the fledgling Heldentenor with financial aid. Additional studies under Victor Beigel, Ernst Grenzebach and the legendary dramatic soprano of the Vienna Court Opera, Anna Bahr von Mildenburg, kept Melchior occupied until 1923. Word of his talent spread and was heard of by Cosima and Siegfried Wagner at Bayreuth. There the re-opening of the Festival for 1924 was under preparation. Melchior was engaged to sing Siegmund and Parsifal. This prestigious contract opened the way to several other appearances such as a Wagner concert with Frida Leider in Berlin in 1923. Around this time several acoustic records were cut for Polydor.\n\nOn May 14, 1924 Lauritz Melchior made his debut, as Siegmund, at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in London. The result was a smashing success. Some weeks later Melchior made his debut on the stage of the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth in the roles of Siegmund and Parsifal. On February 17, 1926 his first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City took place. He sang Tannhäuser opposite Maria Jeritza, Friedrich Schorr, Karin Branzell and Michael Bohnen with Artur Bodanzky conducting. Although he was not adversely criticized, there was not much enthusiasm elicited by this debut. In his first season at the Metropolitan opera, Melchior sang only eight times. His second season brought only one appearance. To build up his repertory and gain more stage experience, he accepted an engagement at the Hamburg State Opera, where he appeared as Lohengrin, Otello, Radames in Aida and Jean van Leyden in Le prophète. He also sang regularly at other major German music theaters, like the State Operas of Berlin and Munich.\n\nAlthough Melchior sang at most of the theatres and concert halls of the Western world during his long career, he is perhaps best remembered as a member of the Metropolitan Opera company where he sang 519 performances of Wagnerian roles between 1926 and 1950. Melchior's breakthrough at the Metropolitan opera finally came when he performed in Tristan und Isolde on March 20, 1929. From this point on his career flourished. It was Lohengrin's Farewell which served as Melchior's \"swan song\" in his last stage performance, on 2 February, 1950.\n\nMelchior appeared at Covent Garden from 1924 to 1939, also as Otello (opposite Viorica Ursuleac as Desdemona) and Florestan, besides the Wagnerian repertory. Also at Covent Garden in 1932, he sang opposite popular soprano Florence Easton in Siegfried, the only time they appeared together. Other important stations of his career were in the Buenos Aires (Teatro Colón) (1931-1943), San Francisco Opera (1934-1945) and Chicago Opera (1934-1945).\n\nMelchior made very many recordings, first as a baritone on Danish HMV, then as a tenor for Deutsche Grammophon(Polydor) (1923-1930), English and German HMV (1927-1935), RCA Victor (1938-1941), American Columbia (1942-1950) and lastly Warner Brothers. His final appearance with Danish radio was in 1960 with a performance of the first act of Die Walküre to celebrate his 70th birthday, which was recorded and constitutes a terrific souvenir of the indestructible, indeed almost supernatural Melchior in full flight.\n\nSome of Melchior's most notable colleagues in the opera houses of the world included the sopranos Frida Leider, Kirsten Flagstad, Lotte Lehmann, Helen Traubel, Marjorie Lawrence and Elisabeth Rethberg and conductors Felix Weingartner, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Fritz Reiner, Sir Thomas Beecham, Arturo Toscanini, Erich Leinsdorf, George Szell, and Otto Klemperer.\n\nBetween 1944 and 1952, Melchior performed in 5 Hollywood musical films for MGM and Paramount Pictures and made numerous US television appearances. In 1947, he put his hand and footprints in cement in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. From 1946-1949 Melchior went on a world tour with his personal conductor Ezra Rachlin. Their visit to Denmark was particularly meaningful as they were the guests of King Frederic, who was an amateur conductor with his own personal concert hall in his palace.\n\nFollowing his unofficial retirement around 1955, Melchior made sporadic singing appearances.

He began piano lessons at an early age with his father, a keyboard player and composer. While still a youth, he became active as a piano accompanist. In 1934 he made his formal recital debut at the House of Engineers in Odessa.\n\nHe entered the Moscow Conservatory in 1937, where he studied with Heinrich Neuhaus. Even before completing his formal studies in 1942, he had acquired a notable reputation via various public appearances. After taking the highest honors at the Ail-Union Competition of Performers in 1945, he pursued a career as a soloist with orchestras, as a recitalist, and as a chamber music artist.\n\nIn 1949 he was awarded the Stalin Prize in recognition of his formidable talent. His career took him to most of the major music centers of his homeland and in Eastern Europe in subsequent years. On Oct. 15,1960, he made his auspicious American debut as soloist in the Brahms 2nd Piano Concerto with Leinsdorf and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Two days later these forces recorded the work, which was destined to become one of the classic recordings of the century.\n\nOn Oct. 19,1960, he made his Carnegie Hall debut in N.Y. to enormous critical acclaim. His London debut followed in 1961. In 1965 and 1970 he made return visits to the U.S. In the later years of his career, Richter limited his engagements, but his many outstanding recordings served to preserve his genius for contemporary and future listeners.\n\nHe celebrated the 50th anniversary of his formal debut in 1994, and in 1995 he gave his farewell performance. However stupendous his digital mastery, Richter never permitted the mere mechanics of piano virtuosity to obscure his vision of interpretive fidelity to the score. While he naturally was a foremost interpreter of the Russian repertoire, not more so than in Prokofiev, he was also rightly acclaimed the world over as a supreme master of the great Romantic repertoire. Few pianists could hope to equal him in Schubert and Schumann, and none ever surpassed him. - Died at Moscow, Aug. 1, 1997.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Today is Vera Lynn´s 100th Birthday.[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1917 - Vera Lynn, singer (Anniversary Waltz) is born.

By nine, he had won a scholarship with the London Academy of Music. Here he spent four years under English pianist, Solomon. In his teens, he would give classical recitals, but his true love at the time was jazz. His first band was the Rhythm Makers. During the second world war, Johnny Pearson served in the famous Royal Artillery Band and Orchestra at Woolwich. After World War II, he signed up and became one of the founding members of the Malcolm Mitchell Trio, before leaving in 1954 after Malcolm Mitchell broke up the group to start a solo career. During his time with the trio, Johnny Pearson toured England and Europe, playing the West End and theatres. The early Malcolm Mitchell Trio consisted of Malcolm Mitchell, Teddy Broughton and Johnny Pearson.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After leaving the Malcolm Mitchell Trio, Pearson turned his talents to British radio, as well as performing in the Peter York Concert Orchestra.

A scout for George Martin had spotted the track \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" after hearing the US singer Dionne Warwick's version. Originally the song was to have been recorded in the UK by Shirley Bassey, but George Martin saw the piece as being more suitable for Black's voice. Early in 1964, \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" was recorded by Cilla Black at London's Abbey Road Studios, in an arrangement by Pearson which featured the use of bassoons. In February 1964, it entered the UK Singles Chart, eventually reaching number 1 in both the UK and Ireland and also charting in other parts of Europe. The Dionne Warwick version was also in the UK charts at the time (although it only managed to peak at Number 42), but Cilla Black's treatment used slightly different lyrics and a different arrangement.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Following the success of \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\", Pearson was invited to work on the next Cilla Black single, \"You're My World\", which was released in May 1964.
