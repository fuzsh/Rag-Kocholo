        "text": "In the years following the death of Commodus, a long period of transformation began that undermined the structure of the Roman Empire. These changes initially affected only aspects of succession to the Princedom, especially involving the military sphere, but they also modified the social and structural organization of the Roman State. After this period of military anarchy, interrupted by a brief phase of prosperity with the accession to the imperial throne of Septimius Severus and his successors, there followed a period of economic stability that determined a new political and institutional empire. The time of Diocletian’s reforms, however, culminated in a serious crisis after the death of Constantine the Great (337 AD). The lands bordering the Adriatic were disputed by the heirs of the Emperor, starting a period of economic and cultural changes that manifested themselves initially as a diffuse form of recession in the dynamics of occupation of the territory. Urban and rural settlements show signs of abandonment and crisis. In the following decades, waves of peoples from northern and eastern Europe disrupted the political unity of the Empire even more. The Empire was only partially rebalanced after the Gothic War, due to the devastation of many urban centers and a drop in the number of sites in the area caused by continuing military clashes. As was demonstrated at the last conference in Ravenna (Economia e Territorio, 28 February-1 March 2014), now being published, in recent years field research has revealed new evidence that allows us to draw a more complete picture of this important historical period which has been the focus of debate in recent decades. The research area discussed in Ravenna was mainly restricted to the central Adriatic, although there was communication with some eastern Adriatic areas. This time the focus will extend to the basin defined as Adriatic Europe, according to geographical and cultural rather than political patterns, thus considering all territories facing the Adriatic Sea. These areas are affected by similar phenomena of transformations (barbarian conquest (crossings of the territory), the formation of barbaric countries, Justinian's Reconquest), at least until the Lombard invasion of Italy and Istria in the second half of the 6th century. After this point, they follow different trajectories that are still poorly understood. Such close relations between the two sides have always suggested direct cultural influences.

This new meeting will analyze these transformative phenomena in the areas research has neglected, including the time span between the 2nd and 8th centuries, especially on the Eastern Adriatic coast, from the short period before the establishment of the Severan dynasty up to the end of the Carolingian period.

Also, we wish everyone a fruitful conference and a pleasant stay in Zadar, the Organizing commitee\n\nIn the years following the death of Commodus, a long period of transformation began that undermined the structure of the Roman Empire.

This new meeting will analyze these transformative phenomena in the areas research has neglected, including the time span between the second and eighth centuries, especially on the eastern Adriatic coast, from the short period before the establishment of the Severan dynasty up to the end of the Carolingian period. This new project is an opportunity to share the results of the last years of field research in the Adriatic area. Our invitation is open to all researchers who deal or have dealt with these issues in current Adriatic Europe, in order to create a new database for historical reconstruction. We will examine these processes either through a regional synthesis or the presentation of individual contexts of study, forms of settlement, and aspects of production, trade and movement of pottery and any types of handicrafts between the two Adriatic sides in this period of crisis. In our new meeting, several sessions dedicated to each region involved in the research project and cross-cutting themes will be held. We also expect a large poster session. To participate in the sessions you should send a title and a short abstract in Croatian, Italian or English (preferably) to the following email address: trade.zadar2015@gmail.com. You should indicate whether you intend to present a poster or an oral presentation. The proposals will be considered by the organizing committee and selected as soon as possible. The lectures should be in the official languages of the conference: English (mainly), Croatian or Italian. Proposals for lectures and posters will be accepted for 6 different sessions: - Urban landscape transformations - Rural landscape transformations - Fortifications - Religious and funerary transformations (churches, monasteries, cemeteries etc.) - Regional trends for Late Roman and Early Medieval landscapes’ transformations (rural and urban) - Trade routes All these aspects should be analyzed, taking into consideration material evidence (pottery, masonry techniques, coins, burials and archaeological finds) as well as evidence that may help the understanding of landscape changes using topographical instruments. All Posters and Reports will be published after acceptance by a scientific committee and peer-review."
