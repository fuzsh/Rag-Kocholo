        "text": "The NSW population continues to increase; between 2012 and 2017 the annual average growth rate was 1.5%. Population growth is a key driver of human-caused changes to the environment.\n\nBy June 2017, there were 7.9 million people living in NSW, 61% of whom lived in Greater Sydney. NSW gained more than 550,000 people between June 2012 and June 2017.\n\nPopulation density in NSW has also risen. In June 2017, there were an average of 9.8 people per square kilometre – a 12% rise since 2008. In Greater Sydney, there were almost 450 people per square kilometre – 65 more people than in 2008.\n\nBy 2036, the NSW population is expected to grow to 9.9 million. Most of this growth is anticipated to be in Greater Sydney. The challenge is to manage projected population growth alongside environmental protection, conservation and liveability.\n\nThe NSW Government has developed long-term plans for Greater Sydney and regional NSW. The plans aim to provide for sustainable and resilient development with a balanced approach to the use of land and water resources while enhancing liveability and protecting the natural environment.\n\nOther strategies for reducing environmental impacts of urbanisation and a growing population include the NSW Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Strategy, the Sydney Green Grid framework for enhancement of open space, Future Transport 2056 and the 2017 Metropolitan Water Plan.\n\nRelated topics: Energy Consumption | Transport | Urban Water | Waste and Recycling\n\nAt 30 June 2017, there were almost 7.9 million people in NSW, of whom 4.8 million (61%) lived in Greater Sydney, 1.8 million (23%) lived in coastal areas and 1.2 million (16%) lived inland. The NSW population has grown by 111,400 people a year, on average, over the five years to 30 June 2017 (see Table 1.1 and Figure 1.1). At a growth rate of 1.5% per year, this was the second largest increase in state population after Victoria.\n\nIn this topic, unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year mean the 12 months ending 30 June of that year.\n\nGreater Sydney\n\nOver the five years to June 2017, Greater Sydney’s population increased by almost 450,000 people, or 10%. Within Greater Sydney, the largest population increases were in the local government areas (LGAs) of Sydney (43,700), Blacktown (39,100) and Parramatta (35,300) (ABS 2018).\n\nRegional NSW\n\nBetween 2012 and 2017, the population of regional NSW, which includes coastal NSW and inland NSW, increased by almost 4%. Substantial growth occurred in areas closer to Sydney (the Central Coast, Lower Hunter and Wollongong) and the state’s larger regional centres (Tweed, Tamworth, Port Macquarie and Bathurst). The largest population declines occurred in areas that were already sparsely populated, such as Broken Hill and Moree Plains.\n\nGrowth projections\n\nBy 2036, the NSW population is projected to grow to 9.9 million people, with the majority – an additional 1.7 million people – living in Greater Sydney. Map 1.2 shows projected population change across the state between 2017 and 2036. Further detail is available at the NSW Population Projections website (DPE 2016).\n\nIn June 2017, there were 9.8 people per square kilometre in NSW, a 12% increase from 8.7 in 2008. Differences in population density throughout the state have implications for provision of services and strategic planning.\n\nHigher densities require more energy, water and waste removal services to be provided within the existing urban footprint, but this can be offset by more efficient built environments and reduced demand for land on the urban fringe. It can reduce the impacts of transport and energy use by facilitating easier access to active transport (e.g. walking and cycling) and public transport. Well-designed urban areas with adequate green space also improve liveability and provide habitat for urban wildlife (Dexter et al. 2016, Hess at al. 2014).\n\nSee also Energy Consumption, Transport and Urban Water Supply topics\n\nPopulation densities range from less than one person per square kilometre in the Far West region of NSW to more than 10,000 people per square kilometre in the inner-city suburbs of Darlinghurst, Potts Point, Pyrmont and Surry Hills.\n\nPopulation density in Greater Sydney has grown steadily. With sustained population growth and management of urban fringe development, average population density in Greater Sydney has grown by 17% to almost 450 people per square kilometre since 2008 (see Figure 1.2). Even within Sydney there is a large variation in population density, which can be less than 50 people per square kilometre in some areas.\n\nWhile the NSW Government has firm population projections, it has not developed specific population targets, growth plans or limits to population growth.\n\nIn October 2018 the NSW Premier announced the appointment of an expert panel to develop a population policy for NSW. The panel will consider:\n\nthe current rate of population growth and infrastructure pipeline\n\nhow long it will take for infrastructure to catch up with population growth rates\n\nNSW’s role at upcoming population discussions with the Commonwealth Government.\n\nThe Panel will also recommend next steps for more detailed work on the issue of population.\n\nA number of plans have been developed to respond to the potential impacts of population change.\n\nThe Greater Sydney Region Plan\n\nThe Greater Sydney Region Plan: A Metropolis of Three Cities is the NSW Government’s 40-year vision for the Greater Sydney Region.\n\nThe plan aims to re-balance growth and deliver benefits more equitably to residents across Greater Sydney. Prepared concurrently with Future Transport 2056 and the State Infrastructure Strategy 2018–2038, it aligns land use, transport and infrastructure planning to reshape Greater Sydney as three unique and connected cities: the Western Parkland City, the Central River City and the Eastern Harbour City.\n\nIt will boost productivity by bringing together good jobs and skilled workers; make Greater Sydney’s suburbs more liveable as they grow through a place-based design approach; and make the three cities more sustainable by protecting the natural environment and open spaces.\n\nRegional Plans\n\nThe NSW Government has 10 Regional Plans in place across the state that play a critical role in how natural resources are managed to ensure the prosperity and productivity of the NSW economy, as well as the health of local communities and the environment.\n\nRegional Plans are long-term strategic planning documents that articulate a vision and plan for housing, jobs and community infrastructure to meet the needs of a changing population. Each Regional Plan also includes goals and actions to protect the environment and encourage sustainable use of resources, tailored to suit the region.\n\nNSW Premier’s Priorities\n\nThe Premier’s Priority Delivering Infrastructure aims to deliver metropolitan, regional and local infrastructure projects to support an anticipated 113% increase in train trips, 30% increase in car trips (2018 State Infrastructure Strategy) and 40% more households (2016 NSW population and household projections) by 2036. These initiatives include new public transport developments.\n\nSee also the Responses sections in the Transport, Energy Consumption and Climate Change topics.\n\nWaste\n\nWaste management in NSW is guided by the Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery (WARR) Strategy 2014­–21 (EPA 2014), which, as noted in relation to Figure 1.4, has facilitated a decrease in per capita waste generation rates and total waste generation.\n\nIn 2017, a draft NSW Waste and Resource Recovery Infrastructure Strategy 2017–21 was released for consultation to assist the waste industry to understand expected increases in waste streams and to plan sufficient processing infrastructure capacity.\n\nSee also the Responses sections in the Waste and Recycling topic\n\nWater\n\nThe 2017 Metropolitan Water Plan sets out strategies and programs for ensuring a sustainable water supply to meet the needs of the people and environment of Greater Sydney. The NSW Government has also developed initiatives for water and sewerage for towns in regional NSW, such as integrated water cycle management.\n\nSee also the Responses sections in the Urban Water Supply topic.\n\nA range of NSW Government programs helps reduce the impacts of population growth. Many of these are discussed in the Energy Consumption, Waste and Recycling, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Urban Water Supply and Transport topics. Some key programs addressing sustainability in urban environments are discussed below.\n\nThe Sydney Green Grid provides a framework for projects that will enhance liveability and biodiversity and increase ecological resilience by delivering an interconnecting network of open space throughout the city. This network includes parks, bush, creek corridors, transport routes, suburban streets, footpaths and cycleways.\n\nThe Metropolitan Greenspace Program (MGP) supports local councils in Greater Sydney and the Central Coast to improve regional open space by co-funding projects to deliver the Green Grid network. Since 1990, the program has awarded over $45 million to more than 620 projects.\n\nThe Building Sustainability Index (BASIX) is an integral part of the development assessment system in NSW. It sets energy and water saving targets, and minimum thermal comfort performance requirements for all new residential dwellings and significant renovations. Since the introduction of BASIX in 2004, the NSW Government estimates 460,000 homes have saved 202,000 megalitres of potable water and reduced carbon emissions by 6.3 million tonnes (DPE 2015)."
