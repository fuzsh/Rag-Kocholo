This guide peers into what all the fuss is about and offers some insight into the various breaks…\n\nAn introduction to Newcastle surf\n\nNewcastle is unquestionably one of the headline surf towns of the NSW North Coast. The city is enfolded on two sides by bending runs of cream-colored beaches. There are waves to be had all over, but the stars lie on the south side of the Newcastle Breakwater, where those strong SE winter sets don’t have too much trouble making their way inside and around the points. Big, heavy take-offs beckon those willing to stray past Nobby’s but there are calmer, cruisier waves that help Newcastle cater to the learner crowd in the smaller summer months.\n\nNewcastle sometimes gets a bad rap. While crime has been a problem and this certainly ain’t no Aussie OC a la Byron Bay, we still think there’s lots to be said for a surf trip in these parts. For one, it sure will be cheaper than Byron. For two, the waves are highly consistent and localism isn’t too much of an issue. Newcastle also puts enthralling national parks laden with rainforests and Aboriginal cultural sites right on the doorstep.\n\nWe might use affiliate links in this post.

We’ll start just south of the breakwater, where some heavy waves cater to performance surfers. From there, we’ll track south to the urban beaches, which have waves for all levels depending on the season.\n\nWhere to stay when surfing in Newcastle?\n\nThere are plenty of attractive hotels in Newcastle, many of which are aimed squarely at the family holiday crowd since this is such a wholesome vacation escape. Some get you nice and close to the top-quality surf breaks mentioned above…\n\nWhen to surf in Newcastle?\n\nNewcastle surf is best in the winter months. They last from May to September in New South Wales and see regular SE swells push through from the Antarctic Ocean even further south. Some days during that time are sure to be too big for surfing here, since the town’s main beaches face head-on into the dominant swell channel and winds can play havoc with the water at the take-off zones during storms. Summer months (November-March) still have plenty of surf and can be excellent for families and beginners.\n\nWe might use affiliate links in this post.
