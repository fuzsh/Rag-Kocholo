        "text": "I like the Wollongong area and I like your taste in near the coast, stand alone older style house with scope for improvement. I think if you went for coast and train line, going north might be beyond your budget, but i could be wrong, so i suggest you check this. I bought down the Shellharbour along the train line with your budget and believe you still can, but only barely. But it's about a 10 minute drive to the beach. I saw a house sold at Cringila for under 600k recently.\n\nNewcastle is pivoting towards a renewable energy export hub and becoming the 3rd NSW container terminal site (as Botany isn't coping and Wollongong isn't practical for much of the State) - no different that Newie adapting after BHP closed down\n\nBut yes, Newcastle exports high grade iron smelting coal - as opposed to brown energy coal - and not going anywhere for the next few decades\n\nNorthern suburbs and Uni suburbs in Wgong you won't get freestanding homes for 6-700k. Cringila is rough. Super rough. The cheap houses are directly opposite the steelworks and they feel like it - I am guessing you would not want to live there. There are some MUCH better options just a small price point up like 7-900k gets you genuinely decent family-friendly areas around the lake if you know where to look and 900k+ often gets a sneaky water view. Lots of housing commission in the wrong streets so proceed with caution but the good bits are in there.\n\nBeing within 1km of the water (whether in Wgong or Newcastle) should help ensure constrained supply of dwellings and maximise capital growth over the long run.\n\nI can only speak of the few Saturday opens I went to at the beginning of 2021. Each open had a sea of young energetic first home buyers, Lake Ave was pumping, and the people were friendly having had plenty of chats with them. I saw Cringila as the future Newtown of the Shellharbour. I saw change. I admit there were plenty of dodgy houses that looked like they might roll down their steep blocks. But OP is looking for a house to improve and Cringila is a renos paradise. And what about the majestic Port Kembla beach and the endless ocean views some houses have.\n\nI'm not trying to argue, I see the change you refer to as well, but advising forum members that 1 house sold cheaply (in the absolute worst suburb) isn't good advice for most people, so accurate average figures are needed to ensure realistic expectations.\n\nI speak from inspecting and negotiating on houses in the area consistently for about 10 years.\n\nAgreed, but important to note Port K and Cringila are not the same. I have actively pursued Port K for clients on a regular basis and am a big fan. If you spend a few extra hours in the immediate area walking and driving around from street to street you will see what I mean about the difference.\n\nAlways good to have a healthy debate/discussion and I value your knowledge and experience of the area. I have visited Wollongong and Port Kembla several times and the real estate agent gave me a tour of Cringila, Warrawong and Port Kembla when I was there. Yes absolutely huge difference between Port Kembla and Cringila, Port Kembla's an absolute gem in my opinion, but I also believe well out of OP's budget. Yes I did only give one house as an example, but it was to show that if there's places under 600k then there's bound to be under 700k and that place seemed structurally ok in that you could live there immediately. And it had an ocean view. On the same street another sold for under 500k but it was a dog's breakfast. With a budget of 700k near the coast and on the train line to Sydney (not that OP needs a train line), I still think Cringila is well worth a look. And I'm not sure where else you could get this, north or south of Sydney, though I'm not saying there aren't other places. Shellharbour where i ended up buying may be barely within the 700k budget, but it's not as close to the beach. And ocean trumps lake for mine. Admittedly I found it very difficult to find a flat block with a structurally sound house, let alone a structurally sound house at Cringila. Happy to debate this.\n\nI looked around that Shellharbour area for about 4 months and as you probably read, ended up buying at Albion Park Rail. I love my place there, under 5 mins walk to the train, 10 mins drive to the beach or a short train to Bombo beach or a train north to the Illawarra beaches and a short stroll to Lake Illawarra. I loved the vibe and found people super friendly. So i realise i'm a bit biased, but i'd like you to consider that Oaks Flat area as well, but it may now me on the top of your budget at best. I believe a train line is a big deal and adds that scarcity value. I noticed people who got on the train with me at Central got off with me at Albion Park Rail or remained on the train, when I'd shoot down after work. As for Lake Heights, south of Flagstaff Rd, my memory is that it was cheaper than it's neighbour Cringila which in turn was cheaper than the Albion Park Rail/Oaks Flat area. If you're looking at Lake Heights, and again with the value a train line brings, I suggest having a peep at the higher side of Cringila as the station is in some sort of industrial area at the top. The challenges are finding a house that's not about to roll down the hill, and a reasonably flat block. Best wishes.\n\nWhat do you like about Port Kembla? Seems like an industrial area and not much beach? Is it more of a long term play in case they get rid of the steelworks eventually?\n\nNot much beach? It's 6.5 km of beautiful beach. I read often that people in the area find it better that Wollongong beach. And of course the pool alongside the beach. I thought it was a given that the steelworks were going and there's plans to transform the area, but don't quote me on this part. In saying that, I think Port Kembla is already very pricey, but in my opinion worth it and more. I still prefer that area north of Wollongong (\"the Riviera\" I've been told its called) where the train line hugs the coastline, but i don't think there'd be much under 2 mil there, but again i could be wrong. I'd like to hear buyers agent's views on this. Certainly both Port Kembla and \"The Riviera\" were way way out of my budget.\n\nPretty sure the steel works isn't going anywhere in the near future ... what about somewhere like Woonona, up the coast a bit, on the beach and train line"
