        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nCardiff is a suburb of the City of Lake Macquarie, New South Wales, Australia. It is located 13 kilometres (8 mi) west-southwest of Newcastle's central business district in the City of Lake Macquarie North Ward.\n\nCardiff is an irregularly shaped suburb. In the 2001 Census Cardiff had 5,039 inhabitants. Including the associated suburbs of Cardiff South and Cardiff Heights, the population was 9,500 persons. Cardiff contains 3 government primary schools, a Catholic primary school & rarely used church, an Independent school and a Government Cardiff high school.\n\nLike most major suburbs in Lake Macquarie, it has its own commercial centre with a degraded black mould infected post office, pub (hotel), real estate agencies, bootmaker, barbers, take-away shops, cafes & Italian & Thai Restraunts 10 coffee machines multiple sex service industry & massage shops, gym, four church opportunity stores incl Lifeline, hairdressers and a supermarket.\n\nCardiff has sporting clubs for the following sports: Cricket (Warners Bay-Junior Cricket Club, Cardiff-Boolaroo District Cricket Club), Rugby League (Cardiff Cougars, Cardiff Cobras), Soccer, Cardiff Tigers Sen Mens, Lawn Bowls (Cardiff Bowling Club) and Netball (Cardiff Netball Club).\n\nThe local police station no longer provides counter services, having been converted into a centre for Highway Patrol officers in around 1998, now abandoned & Rezoned RE1 as part of the Harry Ford Reserve Cardiff Town Park of Cardiff Streetscape Plan. LMCC is Slow in acquiring this property\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe first grant to a white settler in the Cardiff area was a parcel of 2,560 acres (10.36 km2) to George Weller in 1833, stretching west of the current Macquarie Road to Argenton and Cockle Creek.\n\nOther selections were taken up by individual settlers from 1862 to the east of the Weller grant. viz. Mcnamara Estate.The locality became known as Winding Creek after the stream which wound its way from south-east to north-west across the central valley of the area.\n\nIn the latter part of the 19th Century two factors attracted people to the Winding Creek area.\n\nOne was coal mining, with the Lymington (1882) and South Wallsend (1884, later renamed Cardiff) collieries both starting production in the vicinity of the current Cardiff South.\n\nThe other was the decision to construct the Sydney to Newcastle railway, which led to a navvies camp being established at Winding Creek in 1883, and work continuing through most of the rest of the decade.\n\nThe line originally ran close to current Myall Rd, however the gradient from Cardiff up to Tickhole Tunnel proved too steep for the trains of the period, and the line was relocated to the present position a few years after it was opened.\n\nFor a short period in the 1880s Lymington became the popular name for the whole Cardiff area, supplanting Winding Creek, however it fell foul of the postal authorities, because of its similarity to another, established locality name. There were a number of Welsh settlers living in the area, and on the suggestion of one of them, James Edwards, the name Cardiff was chosen after the capital of Wales. It was officially adopted in 1889.\n\nPopulation statistics[]\n\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics data from the 2001 census records the population of Cardiff as 5,039 residents, with a gender mix of 49% males and 51% females in line with the rest of the Australian population. (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2002)\n\nPlace of birth[]\n\nAustralia (84.8%)\n\nEngland (2.4%)\n\nNew Zealand (0.9%)\n\nGermany (0.9%)\n\nScotland (0.6%)\n\nItaly (0.6%)\n\nMain language spoken at home[]\n\nEnglish only (92.2%)\n\nItalian (0.6%)\n\nPolish (0.5%)\n\nGerman (0.4%)\n\nTagalog (0.3%)\n\nGreek (0.2%)\n\nReligion[]\n\nAnglican (28.1%)\n\nCatholic (26.1%)\n\nNo Religion (11.0%)\n\nPresbyterian & Reformed (4.1%)\n\nSupermarkets[]\n\nCardiff has three supermarkets including a Bi-Lo Store located in Kelton Street. The parent company of Bi-Lo, Coles Group announced in mid 2006 that all Bi-Lo stores would be converted to Coles Supermarkets. However, this plan was dumped and the Cardiff store will remain a Bi-Lo supermarket until further notice. An ALDI store opened in November 2008.[1] The ALDI store is located in a building on Harrison Street, which was renovated after being flooded during the June 2007 storms.\n\nCardiff previously had a Food For Less Woolworths supermarket, located just south of Main Road, but it burned down in late 2004. During demolition following the fire, the building was found to be contaminated with asbestos and the ground underneath it was found to be contaminated with heavy metals. The rubble was removed and the ground was covered with a concrete slab during remediation. In March 2007, that remediation was completed and the concrete cover was removed. Lake Macquarie City Council approved construction of a new shopping centre on the site, incorporating a Woolworths supermarket and specialist shops on one level, with a carpark & Library underground underneath. Construction commenced in early 2009 and was surrounded by controversy due to the closure of public toilets and a former council carpark.[2] The carpark was subsequently partially reopened as construction continued. The centre opened in May 2010 after weather related delays.[3]\n\nCar Sales[]\n\nThe suburb is home to a large number of car dealerships, including a Ford dealership, a Holden dealership, a Nissan dealership, a multi-brand dealership selling Toyota, Subaru, Mazda and Kia, an ex-fleet vehicle dealer and several used car dealers.\n\nIndustrial Estate[]\n\nCardiff is a major employment area thanks to the Cardiff Industrial Estate, which is the highest employing area in the Hunter region.\n\nAround half of that industrial estate is accessible only via one section of Munibung Road, a 2-lane road between two T-intersections (Torrens Avenue and Mitchell Road) which experience frequent crashes. The intersection of Munibung Road with Macquarie Road and Myall Road is the main access point for the entire industrial estate and suffers from some of the most severe congestion in the Hunter Valley.\n\nA paper proposal exists for the extension of Pennant Street over the railway line to a roundabout connecting to Main Road near Glendale Drive and to the end of Stockland Drive inside the Stockland Glendale shopping centre. The proposal also includes the construction of a new railway station (to be named Glendale) for access to the industrial estate and the Glendale shopping centre. The proposal is ready to proceed but has been awaiting state government funding for several years as does not have a positive business case\n\nA further proposal exists for the extension of Munibung Road through the redeveloped former Pasminco Sulphide site, connecting through the new light industrial development there to end of Lake Road near Boolaroo. It is hoped that the developer will fund that road as part of that development.\n\nRailway[]\n\nThe main northern railway line passes through Cardiff to the north of the industrial estate and commercial centre. Cardiff railway station is located on Main Road up a steep hill from the commercial centre.\n\nThe railway station has a single island platform, which is located between the two tracks. Access to the platform is only available via a staircase that is exposed to the weather and difficult for elderly residents to negotiate. After two decades of petitioning by locals, funding from State Government was allocated to upgrade the railway station. The upgrade will include the installation of lifts and extending the existing platform to accommodate for eight-car trains. The upgrade of the train station commenced mid 2012 and it is expected to be completed by late 2013.[4]\n\nTwo carparks are provided on the southern side of the railway station. A small carpark is located directly alongside the southbound track, while a larger carpark is located down another steep staircase.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nHistory of Cardiff"
