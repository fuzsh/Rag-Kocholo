        "text": "I’ve seen a bit of discussion recently on how dense we are in Christchurch compared to other cities around Australasia.\n\nDensity is very easy to measure – it’s simply the population (which we collect every census) divided by the land area (which we know from maps). However it is notoriously easy to misinterpret, because it can vary hugely depending on what land area you choose to include in the denominator e.g. do you just use the land covered by homes, or do you include streets, parks, industrial areas, rural areas, rivers, etc.? The average density of Christchurch is about 1,300 ppl/km2 if you just look at the urban area, but it drops all the way down to only 270 ppl/km2 if you include the entire land area of the city (which includes all of Banks Peninsula).\n\nThat said, there is a fairly standard way of comparing densities across different cities and it’s extremely simple. You just draw a grid of 1km by 1km squares across the city and look at how many people live in each square. These are published for every city in both Australia and New Zealand. I’ve taken snips of the bigger centres and chucked them below for easy comparison. In some cases I’ve drawn in either planned or recently built MRT schemes where I think it’s of interest.\n\nFirst up, Christchurch. You can see that rural and industrial areas are less than 1,000 ppl/km2. Most of suburban Christchurch is between 1,000 and 4,000 ppl/km2, with a few pockets of 4,000-5,000ppl/km2 near the central city. Note that these numbers are as per the 2018 census, so the gap in the central city would have filled up now and most of the inner suburbs would be slightly higher.\n\nHere’s Wellington at the same scale. The city centre is quite a lot denser, but outside of that densities are comparable to Christchurch. The northern part of their planned Light Rail line goes through areas that are quite a bit denser than Christchurch’s but the southern part is not dissimilar.\n\nAuckland. Again, densities in the central city much higher and also some quite high density peripheral centres. Outside of those area, densities are comparable to Christchurch. Like Wellington, the northern section of their planned light rail goes through areas generally denser than Christchurch, but the southern section is similar.\n\nHamilton:\n\nTauranga:\n\nQueenstown:\n\nNow we head across the ditch to Australia. First a few of the smaller cities that are more comparable to Christchurch.\n\nCanberra, smaller and less dense than Christchurch, built a 12km light rail line in 2021.\n\nNewcastle, also smaller and less dense than Christchurch, built a 3km light rail line in 2019.\n\nGold Coast. Smaller than Christchurch, they built light rail in 2014. The map below makes it look like it’s similar density to Christchurch despite having enormous high-rise towers in some places. I think this is because it only counts residents. If you include tourists it would jump up quite a bit.\n\nHobart. Smaller and less dense, and no MRT as of yet:\n\nNow to the bigger cities. These aren’t particularly comparable to Christchurch but we’ll have a look anyway.\n\nFirst up Sydney. Absolutely massive and very dense.\n\nMelbourne. Also massive and dense.\n\nBrisbane. Not quite so massive but still a lot bigger than Christchurch. Outside of the central city it is comparable density.\n\nAdelaide. Still bigger than Christchurch but similar density.\n\nPerth. Again bigger than Christchurch but similar density.\n\nAll up, I think it’s quite interesting comparing these maps. Anything stand out to you?\n\nSource: NZ: https://statsmaps.cloud.eaglegis.co.nz/portal/apps/storymaps/stories/aefd5509468a4b81b09c9c9a928b1719"
