        "text": "I grew up in the gong and surrounds and agree that it Newcastle has passed it in terms of gentrification. In the 90s it was rife with NIMBYs that were anti development and the irony is that it is built around a massive industrial steelworks.\n\nYou will struggle to find a splitter block for 400k unless you are looking amongst the ex house suburbs of Berkeley, Dapto or maybe Warrarong.\n\nI was looking down there a couple months ago and decided it was too close to the peak so not much room to grow.\n\nI dont know the Newwy market well but id imagine it wouldnt be too far from the Gong it its property cycle.\n\nIf you are keen on coastal NSW i reckon you could go further south or north but these regional areas are going to be more volatile.\n\nHope this helps....\n\nHi Matt - I do a lot of work in Wgong. Houses with reno and dual occ potential is one of my main investor briefs. For 400k this is a real stretch in most of Illawarra but there are a couple suburbs left where you might make it happen (just). You will need to look south of the steelworks around the banks of lake illawarra, if you want to chat suburb specifics feel free to call. Be careful as streets differ greatly and whilst ex housing comm is fine in some cases, there are some streets that are much worse than others.\n\nIt was really nice to see you and the others @Propertunity . I realise how easy it is to get lost in your own little world when you do this job outside of metro, so great to come in and be real humans in person.\n\nI am still bullish on gong but it is (I think) a little over half way through a cycle or so it feels northside and maybe around half way southside.\n\nThe steelworks is an ongoing issue but as you mentioned the change of a shut down can actually improve a town dramatically as with Newy. I see that happening down here long term, but locals will see it as painful short term no doubt. Here is the latest news on Bluescope progress.\n\nhttp://www.afr.com/news/policy/indu...-accept-pay-freeze-job-losses-20151007-gk3wmz"
