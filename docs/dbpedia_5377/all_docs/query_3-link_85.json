        "text": "Unit and Townhouse shortfall in 2024, Most densely populated regions of Australia 2023, population density per sq km worldwide and the effects of Aukland's zoning changes on their multi-unit developments. (links attached) 1. A recent Proptrack article points out to us that Units and townhouse shortfall will be most pronounced in NSW. We are expecting a shortfall of close to 20,000 dwellings with regards to units and townhouses in NSW in 2024 2. A recent CoreLogic article highlighted the most densely populated parts our country. Melbourne-CBD North tops the list with 38,401 residents per square kilometre. Melbourne CBD- West with 19,925 residents per square km and Melbourne CBD- East with 15,471 residents per square km represent Melbourne again. Haymarket (20, 956 residents per square km) , Chippendale (19,996 residents per square km) , Wolli Creek (17,472 residents per square km) , Zetland (17,358 residents per square km) , Ultimo (16,661 residents per square km)and Waterloo (15,743 residents per square km)represent Sydney. 3. Interesting is it not that these specific pockets of Sydney and Melbourne are much more dense than the average density of cities (including their suburbs and not just their CBD areas) that we would normally consider to be very dense like Hong Kong (7060 people per sq km) , New York (11,300 per sq km) and London (5800 per square km) Sydney in general has a population density of 2000 people per sq km. The figure stands in stark contrast to areas like Haymarket, Chippendale etc 4. This lack of general density may be one of the drivers for the renewed discussion around zoning changes in Sydney. Auckland's zoning changes allowed for a significant uptick in multi-unit developments which then had the effects of slowly reducing rents due to increased supply. https://lnkd.in/gN_gRuJp https://lnkd.in/gs-Yfqbj https://lnkd.in/gcaAbdYA https://lnkd.in/g3bcq2w5\n\nWhat does the Central Coast suburb of Kariong have in common with the affluent suburb of Vaucluse? Both suburbs recorded stronger growth than all other suburbs in the local area in the last twelve months. The data released by Prop Track highlights the suburbs across Australia which have had the strongest growth in values over the past year in each statistical area/ region (which are geographical areas defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics with a minimum population of 100,000 persons). According to the data, Kariong has a median property value of $906,000 - an increase of 17.7% in the last year. In comparison, Vaucluse has a median property value of $9,096,000 - an increase of 15.2% in the last year. You can check out the full list of 87 suburbs in the article below.\n\nAmidst the friendly rivalry between Melbourne and Sydney, there‚Äôs one important point that often gets overlooked. Melbourne‚Äôs population is 95% as large as Sydney‚Äôs, according to the most recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. So the two cities‚Äô populations are virtually identical. Yet Melbourne‚Äôs median property price is only 71% of Sydney‚Äôs, as this CoreLogic graph shows. In other words, if you‚Äôre buying or building a new home, the two cities offer a similar urban experience ‚Äì but Melbourne has much lower barriers to entry. Take that, Sydney. üòâ #homebuilding #melbourneproperty #melbournerealestate\n\nSome analysis of the current residential densities in Sydney based on the 2021 Census. I wanted to explore how different spatial units can change the narrative... and discovered the 'densest' suburb in Sydney. And it might surprise some that it is not next to a train station. üè¢ There are over one million Sydneysiders living in compact suburbs with population density of 50 people per hectare or more. This is 20% of the population that lives in just 6% of the urbanised land in Greater Sydney. üìà Wentworth Point is now Sydney‚Äôs densest suburb by population - over 220 people per hectare across the whole suburb. üîé Looking at population density by suburb disguises the nuance of density - which tends to be clustered within smaller areas - and sometimes in significantly higher concentrations than 200 people per hectare.\n\nI've rarely been this active on LinkedIn, but I couldn't resist sharing, building upon yesterday's discussion on the surge in population growth and its implications on the timely supply needed to accommodate. As mentioned, Queensland's current surge in population requires approximately 281, 15 level apartment buildings each accommodating 150 apartments per building or 168 new 250-lot land sub-divisions. To put this into reality, Inner Brisbane has delivered, in the past 5 years, approximately 102 new apartment towers, each soaring an average of 12 stories high and housing a substantial 98 apartments per building (equating to just over 10,000 apartments or 2,000 per annum). Reality sucks! These figures highlight the magnitude of the challenge we face in adapting to our changing demographic landscape. While it's undeniably a daunting task, it's also an opportunity for innovation and progress. #PopulationGrowth #HousingTrends #Innovation #FuturePlanning"
