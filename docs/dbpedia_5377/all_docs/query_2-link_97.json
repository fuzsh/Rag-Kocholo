        "text": "Recently, the NSW government has confirmed land close to seven Newcastle and Lake Macquarie train stations will be “snap rezoned” for higher housing density. The stations identified are the Newcastle Interchange, Hamilton (image above), Adamstown, Kotara, Teralba, Booragul and Morisset.\n\nThe government will impose new planning controls within 400 metres of 31 train stations across Sydney, Newcastle and Illawarra to “make residential flat building permissible in all residential zonings” as identified in the “Transport Oriented Development” program.\n\nPlanning Minister Paul Scully that the government would amend state planning policies to override council controls near train stations if they did not allow for enough density. He said the changes would include allowing six-storey buildings in R3 medium-density zonings and “appropriate employment zones”, regardless of council standards. This will allow for the development of new and affordable housing within walking distance of public transport.\n\nThe changes will allow:\n\nresidential flat buildings in all residential zones (R1, R2, R3 and R4) within 400 m of identified stations\n\nresidential flat buildings and shop top housing in local and commercial centres (E1 and E2) within 400 m of identified stations.\n\nThese changes will create the capacity for an additional 138,000 new homes over the next 15 years.\n\nIndustry group Urban Development Institute of Australia that it welcomed the government’s strategy but believed the new planning targets should extend to allowing 10-storey apartments within 800 metres of the 31 train stations “to account for the current economic conditions and rapid escalation of construction costs."
