        "text": "You will need this approval to operate a manufactured home estate. Manufactured home estates are medium density housing developments where manufactured homes are erected and leased to the community.\n\nA manufactured home is a cabin, shack or other structure comprised of one or more sections. These sections are typically constructed and assembled in a different location from where they are erected. A manufactured home must include at least one bedroom, a living area, a kitchen, a bathroom, a toilet and laundry facilities. A structure cannot be counted as a manufactured home if it can be registered as a vehicle.\n\nApproval will only be granted if you can show that the estate will be designed, constructed, maintained and operated in accordance with the relevant requirements.\n\nPlease contact the council to identify any further eligibility requirements."
