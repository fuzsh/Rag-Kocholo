The Psycho-oncology Co-operative Research Group (PoCoG) identified a paucity of evidence available to guide adaptation of therapy for remote delivery. This research aimed to develop consensus for evidence-based guidelines on ways to adapt psychological therapies in psycho-oncology for remote delivery.Methods:A national expert advisory group (N = 11) was convened consisting of psycho-oncology clinicians and clinical researchers. An iterative codesign methodology was used to draft psycho-oncology telehealth guidelines. Australian psycho-oncology clinicians participated in a Delphi consensus process to guide the content included in the guidelines. Content was presented under six domains: (i) screening and outcome measures, (ii) formulation, (iii) safety considerations, (iv) resource adaptation, (v) adaptations to therapy, and (vi) example case studies. Participants rated items based on importance, therapeutic appropriateness, and/or usefulness. Consensus was defined as >80% agreement.Results:Thirty-two psycho-oncology clinicians with telehealth experience participated in three Delphi rounds. Agreement was reached on (i) the importance of including screening and outcome measures (90%) and items (n = 5) related to how best to facilitate this; (ii) the importance of addressing provision of a formulation (100%), although only 2/6 strategies presented to facilitate formulation reached consensus; (iii) the appropriateness of proposed risk assessment and management strategies (84%); (iv) therapeutic appropriateness of simplifying resources (100%), including 3/5 visual optimization strategies; and (v) common behavioral components of therapy (n=5).Conclusions:Providing guidance to psycho-oncology clinicians for integrating telehealth into routine clinical practice must go beyond logistical considerations. These consensus-based guidelines provide support to clinicians for adaptation of psycho-oncology therapy to telehealth and will ensure evidence-based practice.\n\nNova 2024 Antonini M, Genie MG, Attema AE, Attwell K, Balogh ZJ, Behmane D, et al., 'Public preferences for vaccination campaigns in the COVID-19 endemic phase: insights from the VaxPref database', Health Policy and Technology, 13 100849-100849 (2024) 2024 Gafaranga JP, Bitunguhari L, Mudenge C, Manirakiza F, Kelly B, Gatabazi P, 'Screening of Depression Among Medical Outpatients Visiting the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali Rwanda', NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT, 20 845-854 (2024) [C1] Nova 2024 Dewi SP, Wilson A, Duvivier R, Kelly B, Gilligan C, 'Do the teaching, practice and assessment of clinical communication skills align?', BMC Med Educ, 24 609 (2024) [C1] Nova 2024 Faris MM, Shepherd HL, Butow PN, Kelly P, He S, Grimison P, et al., 'Changes in psychosocial distress and the number and types of problems reported by patients with cancer when routine screening is integrated within cancer services', Journal of Psychosocial Oncology Research and Practice, 6 (2024) [C1]\n\nBackground: The impact of patient-reported outcome measures on patient outcomes in longitudinal clinical studies is poorly understood.

This observational study explored longitudinal changes in distress and problems reported by cancer patients screened and managed in accordance with a clinical pathway for anxiety and depression (ADAPT CP), implemented over 12 months. Methods: Patients reported distress using the Distress Thermometer and indicated reasons for distress using the 39-item Problem List across five domains: practical, social, emotional, spiritual/religious, and physical. Repeat screening occurred on average 3 monthly (quarterly). Results: Six hundred sixty patients from 10 participating services completed 1,256 screening events over 12 months, reporting 8,645 problems. On average, more emotional (27-34%) and physical (19-22%) issues were reported across all quarters than practical (7-9%) and social (8-9%) issues. Distress and emotional, physical, practical, and social problems reduced from initial to follow-up screens, although the decrease in emotional problems over time was not significantly different than that of the other problems. Worry, fatigue, sleep difficulties, health of family members, and insurance/finances were more persistent problems. Conclusions: Although distress and the change in the number of emotional concerns over time did not differ from other problems, rescreening is recommended within oncology settings to allow patients to indicate new or persistent problems and hospital staff to monitor and assess needs. Emotional concerns are high in oncology patients, suggesting the need for the prioritization of psychosocial care. These problems can persist over time due to their clinically challenging nature or because access to, or implementation of, evidence-based interventions are not yet widespread.\n\nNova 2024 Faris MM, Dhillon HM, Campbell R, Halkett GKB, Miller A, Chan RJ, et al., 'Unmet needs in people with high-grade glioma: defining criteria for stepped care intervention', JNCI Cancer Spectrum, 8 (2024) [C1]\n\nBackground: We aimed to define levels of unmet supportive care needs in people with primary brain tumor and to reach expert consensus on feasibility of addressing patients¿ needs ...

Methods: We conducted secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of people diagnosed with high-grade glioma (n = 116) who completed the Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form during adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. Participants were allocated to 1 of 3 categories: no need (¿no need¿ for help on all items), low need (¿low need¿ for help on at least 1 item, but no ¿moderate¿ or ¿high¿ need), or moderate/high need (at least 1 ¿moderate¿ or ¿high¿ need indicated). Clinical capacity to respond to the proportion of patients needing to be prioritized was assessed. Results: Overall, 13% (n = 5) were categorized as no need, 23% (n = 27) low need, and 64% (n = 74) moderate/high need. At least 1 moderate/high need was reported in the physical and daily living domain (42%) and the psychological (34%) domain. In recognition of health system capacity, the moderate/high need category was modified to distinguish between moderate need (¿moderate¿ need indicated for at least 1 item but ¿high¿ need was not selected for any item) and high need (at least 1 ¿high¿ need indicated). Results revealed 24% (n = 28) moderate need and 40% (n = 46) high need. Those categorized as high need indicated needing assistance navigating the health system and information. Conclusions: Using four step allocations resulted in 40% of patients indicating high need. Categories may facilitate appropriate triaging and guide stepped models of healthcare delivery.\n\n2024 Bultz BD, Kelly B, Rosberger Z, Forbes C, Railton C, Tavener M, et al., ' Uncovering the unspoken : a narrative analysis of patients experiences with testicular cancer.', Supportive Care in Cancer, 32 (2024) 2023 Dewi SP, Wilson A, Duvivier R, Kelly B, Gilligan C, 'Perceptions of medical students and their facilitators on clinical communication skills teaching, learning, and assessment.', Front Public Health, 11 1168332 (2023) [C1] Nova 2023 Butow P, Havard PE, Butt Z, Juraskova I, Sharpe L, Dhillon H, et al., 'Stakeholder perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on oncology services: a qualitative study.', Support Care Cancer, 31 491 (2023) [C1] Nova 2023 Hess JL, Mattheisen M, Greenwood TA, Tsuang MT, Edenberg HJ, Holmans P, et al., 'A polygenic resilience score moderates the genetic risk for schizophrenia: Replication in 18,090 cases and 28,114 controls from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium', American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B: Neuropsychiatric Genetics, [C1] Nova 2023 Opio J, Wynne K, Attia J, Hancock S, Oldmeadow C, Kelly B, et al., 'Overweight or obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease among older Australian adults, even in the absence of cardiometabolic risk factors: a Bayesian survival analysis from the Hunter Community Study.', Int J Obes (Lond), 47 117-125 (2023) [C1] Nova 2023 Pacheco JPG, Bunevicius A, Oku A, Shindel A, Torres AR, Bassols AMS, et al., 'Pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms among medical students: an individual participant data meta-analysis', BMC Psychiatry, 23 (2023) [C1]\n\nBackground: The methodological choice of aggregated estimates for meta-analysis may be notable for some common drawbacks, including variations in the cut-off values of depression,... [more]\n\nBackground: The methodological choice of aggregated estimates for meta-analysis may be notable for some common drawbacks, including variations in the cut-off values of depression, and lower statistical power for analyzing the associated factors. The study aimed to refine the precision of previous findings on the prevalence of depressive symptoms among medical students, through gathering individual participant data (IPD) as identified from our previous reviews. Material and methods: In the present study, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, WanFang, Scielo and LILACS to identify published systematic reviews and meta-analyses up to March 2018, then individual data was requested for further analysis (PROSPERO registration: CRD42018091917). The participants¿ age, sex, year of study, scores for depressive symptoms, and other predictor variables were requested. To pool the prevalence from the included studies, random-effects model (two-step method) was used. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the associated factors on the depression z-scores (one-step method). Results: Of the 249 studies, the datasets of 34 studies were included. The crude prevalence was 19.4% (95% CI: 18.8%, 19.9%) by one-step method and the pooled prevalence was 18.1% (95% CI: 14.1%, 22.1%) by two-step method. Multiple linear regression revealed that being a female, older age, and senior year of study were significantly associated with the z-score. Conclusion: The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms from the Individual Participant Data (IPD) meta-analysis was lower than the previous meta-analyses using aggregated data. Age, sex, and year of study were significantly associated with the depression z-score. IPD meta-analysis may provide a more accurate estimation of disease burden, and allow verification of associated factors.\n\nNova 2023 Butow P, Faris MM, Shaw J, Kelly P, He S, Harris M, et al., 'Effect of core versus enhanced implementation strategies on adherence to a clinical pathway for managing anxiety and depression in cancer patients in routine care: a cluster randomised controlled trial', Implementation Science, 18 (2023) [C1]\n\nBackground: Optimal strategies to facilitate implementation of evidence-based clinical pathways are unclear.

We evaluated two implementation strategies (Core versus Enhanced) to facilitate implementation of a clinical pathway for the management of anxiety and depression in cancer patients (the ADAPT CP). Methods: Twelve cancer services in NSW Australia were cluster randomised, stratified by service size, to the Core versus Enhanced implementation strategy. Each strategy was in place for 12¿months, facilitating uptake of the ADAPT CP (the intervention being implemented). The Core strategy included a lead team with champions, staff training and awareness campaigns prior to implementation, plus access to feedback reports and telephone or online support during implementation. The Enhanced strategy included all Core supports plus monthly lead team meetings, and proactive, ongoing advice on managing barriers, staff training and awareness campaigns throughout implementation. All patients at participating sites were offered the ADAPT CP as part of routine care, and if agreeable, completed screening measures. They were allocated a severity step for anxiety/depression from one (minimal) to five (severe) and recommended management appropriate to their severity step. Multi-level mixed-effect regression analyses examined the effect of Core versus Enhanced implementation strategy on adherence to the ADAPT CP (binary primary outcome: adherent = 70% of key ADAPT CP components achieved versus non-adherent < 70%), with continuous adherence as a secondary outcome. Interaction between study arm and anxiety/depression severity step was also explored. Results: Of 1280 registered patients, 696 (54%) completed at least one screening. As patients were encouraged to re-screen, there were in total 1323 screening events (883 in Core and 440 in Enhanced services). The main effect of implementation strategy on adherence was non-significant in both binary and continuous analyses. Anxiety/depression step was significant, with adherence being higher for step 1 than for other steps (p = 0.001, OR = 0.05, 95% CI 0.02¿0.10). The interaction between study arm and anxiety/depression step was significant (p = 0.02) in the continuous adherence analysis only: adherence was significantly higher (by 7.6% points (95% CI 0.08¿15.1%) for step 3 in the Enhanced arm (p =.048) and trending to significance for step 4. Discussion: These results support ongoing implementation effort for the first year of implementation to ensure successful uptake of new clinical pathways in over-burdened clinical services.

A recent landmark SCZ study of the protein-coding regions of the genome identified a causal role for ten genes and a concentration of rare variant signals in evolutionarily constrained genes1. This recent study¿and most other large-scale human genetics studies¿was mainly composed of individuals of European (EUR) ancestry, and the generalizability of the findings in non-EUR populations remains unclear. To address this gap, we designed a custom sequencing panel of 161 genes selected based on the current knowledge of SCZ genetics and sequenced a new cohort of 11,580 SCZ cases and 10,555 controls of diverse ancestries. Replicating earlier work, we found that cases carried a significantly higher burden of rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs) among evolutionarily constrained genes (odds ratio = 1.48; P = 5.4 × 10-6). In meta-analyses with existing datasets totaling up to 35,828 cases and 107,877 controls, this excess burden was largely consistent across five ancestral populations. Two genes (SRRM2 and AKAP11) were newly implicated as SCZ risk genes, and one gene (PCLO) was identified as shared by individuals with SCZ and those with autism. Overall, our results lend robust support to the rare allelic spectrum of the genetic architecture of SCZ being conserved across diverse human populations.\n\nNova 2023 Hess JL, Quinn TP, Zhang C, Hearn GC, Chen S, Beveridge NJ, et al., 'BrainGENIE: The Brain Gene Expression and Network Imputation Engine', Translational Psychiatry, 13 (2023) [C1]\n\nIn vivo experimental analysis of human brain tissue poses substantial challenges and ethical concerns.

To address this problem, we developed a computational method called the Brain Gene Expression and Network-Imputation Engine (BrainGENIE) that leverages peripheral-blood transcriptomes to predict brain tissue-specific gene-expression levels. Paired blood¿brain transcriptomic data collected by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project was used to train BrainGENIE models to predict gene-expression levels in ten distinct brain regions using whole-blood gene-expression profiles. The performance of BrainGENIE was compared to PrediXcan, a popular method for imputing gene expression levels from genotypes. BrainGENIE significantly predicted brain tissue-specific expression levels for 2947¿11,816 genes (false-discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05), including many transcripts that cannot be predicted significantly by a transcriptome-imputation method such as PrediXcan. BrainGENIE recapitulated measured diagnosis-related gene-expression changes in the brain for autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia better than direct correlations from blood and predictions from PrediXcan. We developed a convenient software toolset for deploying BrainGENIE, and provide recommendations for how best to implement models. BrainGENIE complements and, in some ways, outperforms existing transcriptome-imputation tools, providing biologically meaningful predictions and opening new research avenues.\n\nNova 2022 Shaw J, Allison K, Cuddy J, Lindsay T, Grimison P, Shepherd H, et al., 'Development, acceptability and uptake of an on-line communication skills education program targeting challenging conversations for oncology health professionals related to identifying and responding to anxiety and depression.', BMC Health Serv Res, 22 132 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Pardinas AF, Smart SE, Willcocks IR, Holmans PA, Dennison CA, Lynham AJ, et al., 'Interaction Testing and Polygenic Risk Scoring to Estimate the Association of Common Genetic Variants With Treatment Resistance in Schizophrenia', JAMA PSYCHIATRY, 79 260-269 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Butt Z, Kirsten L, Beatty L, Kelly B, Dhillon H, Shaw JM, 'Barriers and enablers to implementing telehealth consultations in psycho-oncology', Psycho-Oncology, 31 1365-1373 (2022) [C1]\n\nObjective: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, use of telehealth to deliver care was recommended across the Australian health system.

This study aims to explore the barriers and enablers to delivery of psycho-oncology services via telehealth and attitudes to use of telehealth in psycho-oncology. Methods: Twenty-one psycho-oncology clinicians participated in semi-structured telephone interviews. Transcribed interviews were thematically analysed using the framework method. Results: Three key themes were identified which described the overall experience of delivering psycho-oncology services via telehealth: (1) Context Matters-for whom is telehealth effective, when is it less effective; (2) Therapy content and telehealth implementation; (3) Recommendations for Sustainability. Conclusions: These insights into the barriers and enablers to delivering psycho-oncology services via telehealth inform future research and clinical practice. While there is support for the continued use of telehealth in psycho-oncology, there are significant improvements needed to ensure effective implementation and continued benefit.\n\nNova 2022 Winifred A-D, Jane RL, Brian K, Amponsah-Tawiah K, Carole J, 'Mental health and workplace factors: comparison of the Ghanaian and Australian mining industry', BMC Health Services Research, 22 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Trubetskoy V, Pardiñas AF, Qi T, Panagiotaropoulou G, Awasthi S, Bigdeli TB, et al., 'Mapping genomic loci implicates genes and synaptic biology in schizophrenia', Nature, 604 502-508 (2022) [C1]\n\nSchizophrenia has a heritability of 60¿80%1, much of which is attributable to common risk alleles.

Here, in a two-stage genome-wide association study of up to 76,755 individuals with schizophrenia and 243,649 control individuals, we report common variant associations at 287 distinct genomic loci. Associations were concentrated in genes that are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the central nervous system, but not in other tissues or cell types. Using fine-mapping and functional genomic data, we identify 120 genes (106 protein-coding) that are likely to underpin associations at some of these loci, including 16 genes with credible causal non-synonymous or untranslated region variation. We also implicate fundamental processes related to neuronal function, including synaptic organization, differentiation and transmission. Fine-mapped candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia, including the glutamate receptor subunit GRIN2A and transcription factor SP4, and were also enriched for genes implicated by such variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identify biological processes relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology; show convergence of common and rare variant associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders; and provide a resource of prioritized genes and variants to advance mechanistic studies.\n\nNova 2022 Ditton-Phare P, Sandhu H, Kelly B, Loughland C, 'Does ComPsych Communication Skills Training Alter Trainee Self-Efficacy?', Academic Psychiatry, 46 303-310 (2022) [C1]\n\nObjective: ComPsych communication skills training is designed to teach psychiatry trainees effective skills and strategies for undertaking key communication tasks relating to ment... [more]\n\nObjective: ComPsych communication skills training is designed to teach psychiatry trainees effective skills and strategies for undertaking key communication tasks relating to mental illness, such as schizophrenia, with patients and their families/carers. This study examined the program¿s feasibility, utility, and trainees¿ self-efficacy. Methods: Trainee cohorts attending their first year formal education course were recruited annually over 4¿years between 2015 and 2018. Each trainee attended at least one session of training in their cohort year. Trainees completed a questionnaire presenting questions about personal demographics, their perceived confidence in communication, and the effectiveness of elements of training delivery. A total of 41 trainee psychiatrists (15 male) completed the questionnaires presented at four time points (two pre-training and two post-training). Results: Participants reported a significant increase in confidence in their own communication skills post-training (d = 1.12) and rated elements of training delivery (video feedback, feedback from peers in small groups, small group facilitation, and use of simulated patients) as significantly more helpful or effective post-training (d = 0.42). Trainees also reported a significantly increased ability to critically evaluate their own communication skills post-training (d = 0.59), suggesting an increased ability to recognize their own communication skill competence. Conclusions: Following ComPsych training, trainees were more confident discussing information about schizophrenia with patients and their families/carers and were more able to critically evaluate their own communication skills: an important feature of good clinical acumen. These subjective ratings provide important self-efficacy information, including the benefits perceived and evidence of the program¿s feasibility and utility.\n\nNova 2022 Drew RJ, Morgan PJ, Collins CE, Callister R, Kay-Lambkin F, Kelly BJ, Young MD, 'Behavioral and Cognitive Outcomes of an Online Weight Loss Program for Men With Low Mood: A Randomized Controlled Trial', Annals of Behavioral Medicine, 56 1026-1041 (2022) [C1]\n\nBackground: Depression and obesity are major health concerns and commonly co-exist, but men rarely seek help for these conditions.

Methods: Overall, 125 men (18-70 years) with a BMI between 25 and 42 kg/m2 and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 = 5) were randomly allocated to SHED-IT: Recharge (n = 62) or wait-list control (n = 63) groups. The self-directed program targeted key health behaviors combined with online mental fitness modules based on cognitive behavioral therapy. Behavioral (e.g., physical activity) and psychological outcomes (e.g., cognitive flexibility) were assessed with validated measures at baseline, 3 months (post-test) and 6 months (follow-up). Intention-to-treat linear mixed models examined treatment effects, which were adjusted for covariates, and effect size estimated (Cohen's d). Results: At post-test, intervention men achieved small-to-medium improvements in several health behavior outcomes including moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, light physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, energy intake, portion size, and risky alcohol consumption (range, d = 0.3-0.5), when compared with the control group. Intervention effects were also observed for perceived physical self-worth, perceived physical strength, cognitive flexibility, and behavioral activation (range, d = 0.3-0.8). No effects were found for fruit and vegetable intake, or mindful attention. Most effects were maintained at follow-up. Conclusions: This gender-tailored, eHealth program with integrated mental fitness support elicited meaningful improvements in health behaviors and psychological outcomes for men with low mood.

The aim of this study was to extend findings and to provide a longitudinal perspective of emotional effects of COVID-19 on a range of participants, including patients with cancer, their family members, and oncology health professionals (HPs) in Australia. Methods: This mixed-methods, longitudinal study incorporated semistructured interviews and psychological well-being survey data collected at three time points between June 2020 and October 2021. Results: Seventy-seven participants volunteered at time point 1 (T1; 32 patients, 16 caregivers, 29 HPs), 52 at timepoint 2 (23 patients, 10 caregivers, 19 HPs), and 43 at timepoint 3 (19 patients, 8 caregivers, 16 HPs). Overall, participants were psychologically well; however, elevated depressive symptoms were detected in HPs by timepoint 3. Qualitative results highlighted the emotional toll of COVID-19 for all participant groups over time. Three shared themes emerged: (1) balancing fear and safety, (2) uncertainty in an ever-changing situation, and (3) fatigue due to lack of support and sense of isolation. An additional theme unique to HPs was also identified: (4) a sense of dread for what is to come in an already exhausted workforce. Conclusion: Despite Australia's relatively low COVID-19 case numbers, an emotional toll on the cancer community was apparent. Longitudinal results indicate consistency of themes over time with the burden for HPs adding a theme by the third interview. Participants were challenged to balance needs of personal safety against cancer priorities in an environment of uncertainty and isolation. Over time, a sense of fatigue emerged, and for HPs, increased workloads left many feeling overwhelmed and unsupported with a sense of dread around future outcomes. © 2022\n\nNova 2022 Butow P, Shepherd HL, Cuddy J, Rankin N, Harris M, He S, et al., 'Staff perspectives on the feasibility of a clinical pathway for anxiety and depression in cancer care, and mid-implementation adaptations', BMC Health Services Research, 22 (2022) [C1]\n\nBackground: Clinical pathways (CPs) are intended to standardise and improve care but do not always produce positive outcomes, possibly because they were not adapted to suit the sp... [more]\n\nBackground: Clinical pathways (CPs) are intended to standardise and improve care but do not always produce positive outcomes, possibly because they were not adapted to suit the specific context in which they were enacted. This qualitative study aimed to explore staff perspectives of implementation of a CP for routine screening, assessment, referral and management of anxiety and depression (the ADAPT CP) for patients with cancer, focussing on perceived feasibility of the CP and negotiated adaptations made during the implementation phase. Methods: The ADAPT CP was implemented in 12 urban and regional oncology services in Australia. Services were randomised to receive core versus enhanced implementation strategies. Core sites received support until implementation commencement and could access progress reports. Enhanced sites received proactive, ongoing support during the 12-month implementation. Purposively selected staff were interviewed prior to implementation (n = 88) and 6 months later, half-way through the implementation period (n = 89). Monthly meetings with lead multi-disciplinary teams at the eight enhanced sites were recorded. Data were thematically analysed. Results: Six overarching themes were identified: ADAPT is of high value; timing for introducing the CP and screening is difficult; online screening is challenging; a burden too much; no-one to refer patients to; and micro-logistics are key. While early screening was deemed desirable, diverse barriers meant this was complex, with adaptations made to time and screening location. Online screening prompted by email, seen as time-saving and efficient, also proved unsuccessful in some services, with adaptations made to in-clinic or phone screening, or repeated email reminders. Staff negative attitudes to ADAPT, time constraints, and perceived poor fit of ADAPT to work roles and flows, all impacted implementation, with key tasks often devolving to a few key individuals. Nevertheless, services remained committed to the ADAPT CP, and worked hard to create, review and adapt strategies to address challenges to optimise success. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the interactive nature of health service change, with staff actively engaging with, forming views on, and problem-solving adaptations of the ADAPT CP to overcome barriers. Obtaining staff feedback is critical to ensure health service change is sustainable, meaningful and achieves its promise of improving patient outcomes.

Mining is a significant enterprise in the African continent; however, limited attention has been given to mental health in mining in this region. Ghana is the largest gold producer in Africa and mining contributes significantly to the economy. Mental health problems can have significant implications for the wellbeing and safety of mining employees, yet little is known about this in diverse geographic and cultural contexts. This study aims to explore mental health and available supports from the perspective of managers in mining companies in Ghana. Methods: A qualitative descriptive methodology was used to collect in-depth information from managers of international mining companies in Ghana. After receiving institutional ethics approval, all managers from the five mine sites were invited to participate in an interview. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis. Results: Three major themes were identified: Health Promotion, which explored health assessments and health promotion onsite activities; Onsite Support which included policy, human resources and medical supports; thirdly External Support, examined formal and informal supports such as family and social networks. Conclusion: Mental health was implied in various activities undertaken at the mine rather than being specific to targeting mental health directly. This study demonstrates the absence of mental health supports in mining in Ghana. Efforts should be made to incorporate mental health programs within the general health and safety policy, and an understanding of the local social norms and culture is vital.\n\nNova 2022 Watson L, Link C, Qi S, Deiure A, Brooke Russell K, Schulte F, et al., 'Symptom Burden and Complexity in the Last 12 Months of Life among Cancer Patients Choosing Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) in Alberta, Canada', Current Oncology, 29 1605-1618 (2022) [C1]\n\nBackground: In 2019, cancer patients comprised over 65% of all individuals who requested and received Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) in Canada.

This descriptive study sought to understand the self-reported symptom burden and complexity of cancer patients in the 12 months prior to receiving MAID in Alberta. Methods: Between July 2017 and January 2019, 337 cancer patients received MAID in Alberta. Patient characteristics were descriptively analyzed. As such, 193 patients (57.3%) completed at least one routine symptom-reporting questionnaire in their last year of life. Mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were utilized to examine the trajectories of individual symptoms and overall symptom complexity within the cohort over this time. Results: The results revealed that all nine self-reported symptoms, and the overall symptom complexity of the cohort, increased as patients¿ MAID provision date approached, particularly in the last 3 months of life. While less than 20% of patients experienced high symptom complexity 12 months prior to MAID, this increased to 60% in the month of MAID provision. Conclusions: Cancer patients in this cohort experienced increased symptom burden and complexity leading up to their death. These findings could serve as a flag to clinicians to closely monitor advanced cancer patients¿ symptoms, and provide appropriate support and interventions as needed.\n\nNova 2022 Blokland GAM, Grove J, Chen C-Y, Cotsapas C, Tobet S, Handa R, et al., 'Sex-Dependent Shared and Nonshared Genetic Architecture Across Mood and Psychotic Disorders.', Biol Psychiatry, 91 102-117 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Rose S, Boyes AW, Kelly B, Bridge P, Carlson M, Coutts E, Paul C, 'Antitobacco advertising and lung cancer stigma: a qualitative study of the experiences of people with a lung cancer diagnosis', Journal of Psychosocial Oncology Research &amp; Practice, 4 e069-e069 (2022) [C1] 2022 Teodorczuk A, Kelly B, Carney S, 'Psychological debriefing: First do no harm', MEDICAL EDUCATION, 56 230-231 (2022) 2022 Butow P, Havard PE, Butt Z, Juraskova, Sharpe L, Dhillon H, et al., 'The impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients, their carers and oncology health professionals: A qualitative study', Patient Education and Counseling, 105 2397-2403 (2022) [C1]\n\nObjective: Cancer patients, carers and oncology health professionals have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in many ways, but their experiences and psychosocial responses to ... [more]\n\nObjective: Cancer patients, carers and oncology health professionals have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in many ways, but their experiences and psychosocial responses to the pandemic are still being explored. This study aimed to document the experience of Australians living with cancer, family carers, and Oncology health professionals (HPs) when COVID-19 first emerged. Methods: In this qualitative study, participants (cancer patients currently receiving treatment, family carers and HPs) completed a semi-structured interview exploring their experiences of COVID-19 and the impact it had on cancer care. Participants also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (patients) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (carers and HPs) to assess emotional morbidity. Thematic analysis was undertaken on qualitative data. Results: 32 patients, 16 carers and 29 HPs participated. Qualitative analysis yielded three shared themes: fear and death anxiety, isolation, and uncertainty. For HPs, uncertainty incorporated the potential for moral distress and work-stress. Patients and carers scoring high on anxiety/depression measures were more likely to have advanced disease, expressed greater death anxiety, talked about taking more extreme precautionary measures, and felt more impacted by isolation. Conclusion: Cancer and COVID-19 can have compounding psychological impacts on all those receiving or giving care. Practice Implications: Screening for distress in patients, and burnout in HPs, is recommended. Increased compassionate access and provision of creative alternatives to face-to-face support are warrented.\n\nNova 2022 Ditton-Phare P, Sandhu H, Kelly B, Loughland C, 'ComPsych communication skills training: Applicability of simulated patients in psychiatry communication skills training.', Australas Psychiatry, 30 552-555 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Davies F, Harris M, Shaw J, Butow P, Newby J, Murphy M, et al., 'Uptake of an online psychological therapy program (iCanADAPT-Early) when implemented within a clinical pathway in cancer care centres', Psycho-Oncology, 31 338-341 (2022) 2021 Geerligs L, Shepherd HL, Butow P, Shaw J, Masya L, Cuddy J, et al., 'What factors influence organisational readiness for change?

[more]\n\nAims: Translation of evidence-based psycho-oncology interventions into routine care can significantly improve patient outcomes, yet effective implementation remains challenging due to numerous real-world barriers. A key factor that may influence implementation is organisational readiness for change. This mixed method study sought to identify factors associated with organisational readiness for implementing the Australian clinical pathway for the screening, assessment and management of anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients (ADAPT CP). Methods: We collected data from multidisciplinary staff across six Australian cancer services who were preparing to implement the ADAPT CP. Services were categorised as having ¿high¿ versus ¿mid-range¿ organisational readiness based on a median split on the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) questionnaire (score range = 12¿60). Qualitative data from the semi-structured interviews based on the Promoting Action Research in Health Services (PARiHS) framework were analysed thematically and compared for services with high- versus mid-range organisational readiness. Results: Three services with high- (mean ORIC range, 52.25¿56.88), and three with mid-range (range, 38.75¿46.39) organisational readiness scores were identified. Staff at services reporting higher readiness described a more collaborative and proactive service culture, strong communication processes and greater role flexibility. They also reported greater confidence in overcoming anticipated barriers and clearer strategies for addressing issues. Conclusions: Levels of organisational readiness were related to distinct qualitative themes. Targeting these issues in services where readiness is mid-range or low prior to full-scale roll-out may improve staff levels of confidence and efficacy in implementing psycho-oncology-focused interventions.\n\n2021 Asare-Doku W, Rich JL, Kelly B, Amponsah-Tawiah K, James C, 'Mental health and mining: the Ghanaian gold mining story', International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, 94 1353-1362 (2021) [C1]\n\nPurpose: There is limited empirical evidence regarding mental health in workplace settings in Africa.

Gold mining is a major industry in Ghana, and this study investigated mental health-related symptoms and the factors contributing to such symptoms among employees in the Ghanaian. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design study was used to collect data from employees working in the mining industry across five gold mines in Ghana. All mining employees were invited to participate in the survey. Sociodemographic and work characteristic data (including job content) was collected alongside measures of recent mental health-related symptoms (Kessler-10). Questionnaires were administered in English. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. Results: Of 1165 participants (response rate: 78%), 87% were male and 13% were female. The majority of the participants were in the 25¿34 age category. Psychological distress was categorized as low (62.6%), moderate (24.3%), high (10.0%) and very high (3.2%). Shift type (working 12¿h or more), physical working conditions and financial factors were significantly associated with psychological distress. Job resources and job demands was not significantly associated with levels of psychological distress. Conclusion: This is the first study to explore mental health in the Ghanaian gold mining industry. The findings identify workplace factors associated with psychological distress in the mining industry in Ghana and support the importance of promoting mental health as part of workplace health and safety strategy to improve mental health across the mining population.\n\nNova 2021 Hess JL, Tylee DS, Mattheisen M, Børglum AD, Als TD, Grove J, et al., 'A polygenic resilience score moderates the genetic risk for schizophrenia', Molecular Psychiatry, 26 800-815 (2021) [C1] Nova 2021 Luong TT, Handley T, Austin E, Kiem A, Rich J, Kelly B, 'New Insights Into the Relationship Between Drought and Mental Health Emerging From the Australian Rural Mental Health Study', Frontiers in Psychiatry, 12 (2021) [C1] Nova 2021 Butow P, Shepherd HL, Cuddy J, Harris M, He S, Masya L, et al., 'Acceptability and appropriateness of a clinical pathway for managing anxiety and depression in cancer patients: a mixed methods study of staff perspectives', BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH, 21 (2021) [C1] Nova 2021 Rose S, Boyes A, Kelly B, Cox M, Palazzi K, Paul C, 'Lung cancer stigma is a predictor for psychological distress: A longitudinal study.

Methods: This longitudinal study was nested within a larger randomised controlled trial. Eligible participants were recruited via respiratory and oncology out-patient clinics in Australia (n¿=¿194). Consenting participants were asked to complete surveys at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-recruitment. Measures included lung cancer stigma (Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma Scale) and psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12 [GHQ-12]). Results: One-hundred and ninety-four participants were included for analysis. Most were male (57.7%) with a mean age of 68 years (SD¿=¿8.8). A significant relationship between baseline lung cancer stigma and psychological distress at 6 months was found, where a one unit increase in lung cancer stigma increases psychological distress by 0.044 when adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, baseline GHQ-12 scores and intervention allocation (as part of the larger trial; p¿=¿0.001; ß¿=¿0.044, 95% CI¿=¿0.010, 0.079). Conclusion: Temporal links between lung cancer stigma and psychological distress was found at 6 months, suggesting stigma-related experiences may have a delayed impact.

Increasingly, the impact of drought on mental health and wellbeing is being recognized. This paper investigates the relationship between drought and well-being to determine which drought indices most effectively capture well-being outcomes. A thorough understanding of the relationship between drought and well-being must consider the (i) three aspects of drought (duration, frequency, and magnitude); (ii) different types of drought (meteorological, agricultural, etc.); and (iii) the individual context of specific locations, communities, and sectors. For this reason, we used a variety of drought types, drought indices, and time windows to identify the thresholds for wet and dry epochs that enhance and suppress impacts to well-being. Four postcodes in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, are used as case studies in the analysis to highlight the spatial variability in the relationship between drought and well-being. The results demonstrate that the relationship between drought indices and well-being outcomes differs temporally, spatially, and according to drought type. This paper objectively tests the relationship between commonly used drought indices and wellbeing outcomes to establish whether current methods of quantifying drought effectively capture well-being outcomes. For funding, community programs, and interventions to result in successful adaptation, it is essential to critically choose which drought index, time window, and well-being outcome to use in empirical studies. The uncertainties associated with these relationships must be accounted for, and it must also be realized that results will differ on the basis of these decisions.\n\nNova 2021 Drew RJ, Morgan PJ, Kay-Lambkin F, Collins CE, Callister R, Kelly BJ, et al., 'Men's Perceptions of a Gender-Tailored eHealth Program Targeting Physical and Mental Health: Qualitative Findings from the SHED-IT Recharge Trial', INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH, 18 (2021) [C1] Nova 2021 James CL, Tynan RJ, Bezzina AT, Rahman MM, Kelly BJ, 'Alcohol Consumption in the Australian Mining Industry: The Role of Workplace, Social, and Individual Factors', Workplace Health and Safety, 69 423-434 (2021) [C1]\n\nBackground: Coal miners have been reported to have higher rates of risky/harmful alcohol misuse; however, it is not known if metalliferous mining employees whose working condition...

This study aimed to examine alcohol consumption in a sample of Australian metalliferous mining workers and to examine the demographic and workplace factors associated with risky/harmful alcohol use. Methods: All employees from a convenience sample of four Australian mine sites were invited to complete a paper-based cross-sectional survey between June 2015 and May 2017. The survey contained questions relating to social networks, health behaviors, psychological distress, demographic characteristics, and risky/harmful drinking. Current alcohol use was measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a validated measure of risky and/or harmful drinking. Factors associated with risky/harmful drinking were investigated using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Findings: A total of 1,799 participants completed the survey (average site response rate 95%). Overall, 94.8% of males and 92.1% of females reported using alcohol in the preceding 12 months. The odds of risky/harmful alcohol use were significantly higher in those who were male, younger, and reported higher psychological distress. Conclusions/Application to Practice: This study identified that metalliferous mining employees engage in at-risk levels of alcohol consumption significantly higher than the national average despite workplace policies and practices that restrict alcohol use. Personal and workplace risk factors that may help target specific employee groups and inform the development of tailored, integrated multicomponent intervention strategies for the industry were identified.\n\nNova 2021 Handley TE, Lewin TJ, Butterworth P, Kelly BJ, 'Employment and retirement impacts on health and wellbeing among a sample of rural Australians', BMC Public Health, 21 (2021) [C1]\n\nBackground: In Australia, it is projected that one in four individuals will be at the nominal retirement age of 65 or over by 2056; this effect is expected to be especially pronou... [more]\n\nBackground: In Australia, it is projected that one in four individuals will be at the nominal retirement age of 65 or over by 2056; this effect is expected to be especially pronounced in rural areas. Previous findings on the effects of retirement on wellbeing have been mixed. The present study explores the effects of employment and retirement on health and wellbeing among a sample of rural Australians. Methods: Australian Rural Mental Health Study participants who were aged 45 or over (N = 2013) were included in a series of analyses to compare the health and wellbeing of individuals with differing employment and retirement circumstances. Self-reported outcome variables included perceived physical health and everyday functioning, financial wellbeing, mental health, relationships, and satisfaction with life. Results: Across the outcomes, participants who were employed or retired generally reported better health and wellbeing than those not in the workforce. Retired participants rated more highly than employed participants on mental health, relationships, and satisfaction with life. There was also a short-term benefit for perceived financial status for retired participants compared to employed participants, but this effect diminished over time. Conclusions: While retirement is a significant life transition that may affect multiple facets of an individual¿s life, the direction and magnitude of these effects vary depending on the retirement context, namely the pre-retirement and concurrent circumstances within which an individual is retiring. Personal perceptions of status changes may also contribute to an individual¿s wellbeing more so than objective factors such as income.

Despite international priority given to psychosocial care for cancer patients, implementation of psychosocial programs into routine cancer care is limited. We developed, implemented, and assessed the impact, acceptability, and cost of an integrated, patient-centered Psychosocial Assessment, Care and Treatment (PACT) model of care for cancer patients within a general hospital setting. Methods: A time series research design was implemented to test the PACT model of care, newly introduced in an Australian tertiary hospital. System-level impact on systematic distress screening and management was assessed through audit of the medical records of three cross-sectional samples of 141 patients, at baseline and at 12 and 24¿months post-baseline. The impact of the model on patient experience and health care professionals' (HCPs) knowledge and confidence was assessed via surveys. The acceptability of the intervention was assessed through HCP interviews at 24¿months. The cost of the intervention was assessed by PACT staff recording the time spent on care provision, training, and intervention administration, and associated costs were calculated using staff payment rates adjusted for superannuation and leave. Results: Across the 24¿months of implementation, formal distress screening increased from 0% at baseline to 29% of patients at 12¿months and 31% of patients at 24¿months, with an associated decrease in informal screening as formal screening increased. There was no notable change in distress management (ie, development of care plans) across the time period. Baseline patient experience was already high (mean score = 46.85/55) and did not change significantly over the course of the study. In both general and specific areas of addressing patient psychosocial concerns, HCP knowledge and confidence was moderate and remained largely unchanged over the course of the study. HCPs perceived the PACT model as highly beneficial and instrumental in bringing about significant changes to staff's knowledge, practices and awareness of psychosocial issues. The estimated total labor cost (including on-costs) was AUD$119,239 (over the 2¿years); with a declining cost over the lifetime of the intervention reflecting the higher initial set-up costs. Conclusions: Although the PACT model was associated with an increase in distress screening, staff workloads, high turnover, and administrative barriers may have restricted the translation into distress management. Future research exploring effective avenues to engage staff at a management level and ensure that staff view distress management as a valuable component of their role may assist to embed strategies into the general hospital culture and lead to more sustainable changes.\n\nNova 2021 May J, Grotowski M, Walker T, Kelly B, 'Rapid implementation of a novel embedded senior medical student program, as a response to the educational challenges of covid-19', International Journal of Practice-Based Learning in Health and Social Care, 9 63-73 (2021) [C1]\n\nAs with many OECD countries, graduating medical students have been choosing specialist careers at a greater rate than ever before.

Generalism in the form of family (general practice) and more generalist medical specialties have been trending down resulting in distributional geographic challenges. With the advent of COVID-19 in March 2020, medical schools and in particular the Joint Medical Program situated in a regional and rural area in NSW Australia had the unique opportunity to rethink the penultimate year curriculum when the previous rapid rotation model through numerous medical specialities became untenable. The need to vision a new practical pragmatic curriculum spurred a rapid revaluation of assessment, placement length and model with a pivot to an \"embedded senior student placement\" agnostic of discipline and supported by a competency-based learning portfolio. This article explores the barriers and enablers and identifies the potential elements of this type of placement which can be adapted to community and smaller rural sites. The positive student and supervisor experience also enabled an employment model to be woven into the students learning and ensured on hand medical student workforce for hospitals throughout the rural footprint. The capacity of these placements to celebrate variation in experience and support students to learn on the job have now caused a revision of the penultimate year with expectation of gains in students' satisfaction and in employability. It has also opened up options to deliver and increase the inherent value of generalist placements with likely long term workforce benefit.\n\nNova 2021 Dickerson J, Lockyer B, Moss RH, Endacott C, Kelly B, Bridges S, et al., 'COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in an ethnically diverse community: descriptive findings from the Born in Bradford study', Wellcome Open Research, 6 (2021) [C1]\n\nBackground: The roll out of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are underway in the UK, and ensuring good uptake in vulnerable communities will be critical to reducing ho... [more]\n\nBackground: The roll out of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are underway in the UK, and ensuring good uptake in vulnerable communities will be critical to reducing hospital admissions and deaths. There is emerging evidence that vaccine hesitancy is higher in ethnic minorities and deprived areas, and that this may be caused by distrust and misinformation in the community. This study aims to understand COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in an ethnically diverse and deprived population of Bradford through the Born in Bradford (BiB) research programme. Methods: Surveys were sent to parents in BiB who had taken part in a previous Covid-19 survey (n=1727). Cross tabulations explored variation by ethnicity and deprivation. Answers to a question asking the main reason for hesitancy was analysed using thematic analysis. Results: 535 (31%) of those invited between 29 th October-9 th December 2020 participated. 48% were White British, 37% Pakistani heritage and 15% from other ethnicities; 46% were from the most deprived quintile of the Index of Multiple Deprivation. 29% of respondents do want a vaccine, 10% do not. The majority had not thought about it (29%) or were unsure (30%). Vaccine hesitancy differed by ethnicity and deprivation: 43% (95% CIs: 37-54%) of White British and 60% (35-81%) in the least deprived areas do want a vaccine, compared to 13% (9-19%) of Pakistani heritage and 20% (15-26%) in the most deprived areas. Reasons for not wanting a vaccine were commonly explained by confusion and distrust which was linked to exposure to misinformation. Conclusions: There is a risk of unequitable roll out of the vaccination programme in the UK with higher vaccine hesitancy in ethnic minorities and those living in deprived areas. There is an urgent need to tackle misinformation that is leading to uncertainty and confusion about the vaccines.\n\n2021 Teodorczuk A, Kelly B, Carney S, 'When I say 2021 Young MD, Drew RJ, Kay-Lambkin F, Collins CE, Callister R, Kelly BJ, et al., 'Impact of a Self-Guided, eHealth Program Targeting Weight Loss and Depression in Men: A Randomized Trial', JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY, 89 682-694 (2021) [C1] Nova 2020 Geerligs L, Shepherd HL, Rankin NM, Masya L, Shaw JM, Price MA, et al., 'The value of real-world testing: A qualitative feasibility study to explore staff and organisational barriers and strategies to support implementation of a clinical pathway for the management of anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients', Pilot and Feasibility Studies, 6 (2020) [C1]\n\nBackground: Effective translation of evidence-based research into clinical practice requires assessment of the many factors that can impact implementation success.

Research methods that draw on recognised implementation frameworks, such as the Promoting Action Research in Health Services (PARiHS) framework, and that test feasibility to gain information prior to full-scale roll-out, can support a more structured approach to implementation. Objective: This paper presents qualitative findings from a feasibility study in one cancer service of an online portal to operationalise a clinical pathway for the screening, assessment and management of anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients. The aim of this study was to explore staff perspectives on the feasibility and acceptance of a range of strategies to support implementation in order to inform the full-scale roll-out. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fifteen hospital staff holding a range of clinical, administrative and managerial roles, and with differing levels of exposure to the pathway. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, and themes were subsequently organised within the constructs of the PARiHS framework. Results: Barriers and facilitators that affected the feasibility of the online portal and implementation strategies were organised across eight key themes: staff perceptions, culture, external influences, attitudes to psychosocial care, intervention fit, familiarity, burden and engagement. These themes mapped to the PARiHS framework's three domains of evidence, context and facilitation. Conclusions: Implementation success may be threatened by a range of factors related to the real-world context, perceptions of the intervention (evidence) and the process by which it is introduced (facilitation). Feasibility testing of implementation strategies can provide unique insights into issues likely to influence full-scale implementation, allowing for early tailoring and more effective facilitation which may save time, money and effort in the long-term. Use of a determinant implementation framework can assist researchers to synthesise and effectively respond to barriers as they arise. While the current feasibility study related to a specific implementation, strategies such as regular engagement with local stakeholders, and discussion of barriers arising in real-time during early testing is likely to be of benefit to all researchers and clinicians seeking to maximise the likelihood of long-term implementation success.\n\n2020 Giles A, Nasstasia Y, Baker A, Kelly B, Dascombe B, Halpin S, et al., 'Exercise as Treatment for Youth With Major Depression: The Healthy Body Healthy Mind Feasibility Study', Journal of Psychiatric Practice, 26 444-460 (2020) [C1]\n\nThe goals of this study were to determine the feasibility of engaging youth with major depressive disorder (MDD) in a multimodal exercise intervention (Healthy Body Healthy Mind) ...

Youth (15 to 25 y of age) with MDD diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) were eligible to participate. Feasibility measures included recruitment, retention, and program adherence rates. The exercise program consisted of a single session of motivational interviewing to enhance exercise adherence, then 1-hour, small-group supervised exercise sessions 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Assessments were administered at baseline and at 12 weeks. Depression symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Physical fitness and blood biomarkers were also measured. Three males and 10 females with MDD, who were 18 to 24 years of age, participated. Retention at 12 weeks was 86%, and attendance at exercise sessions averaged 62% ± 28%. After 12 weeks, 69% of participants experienced a remission of MDD based on the SCID. Mean BDI-II scores decreased from 31.9 ± 9.1 to 13.1 ± 10.1 [Cohen d effect size (ES) = 1.96]. Improvements were observed in upper (ES = 0.64) and lower (ES = 0.32) body muscular endurance. Exercise session attendance was moderately correlated with changes in BDI-II scores (Pearson r = 0.49). It appears feasible to attract and engage some youth with MDD in an exercise intervention. The positive impact on depression symptoms justifies further studies employing exercise interventions as an adjunct to routine care for young people with MDD.\n\nNova 2020 Kelly B, Handley T, Kissane D, Vamos M, Attia J, 'An indelible mark the response to participation in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide among doctors: A review of research findings', Palliative and Supportive Care, 18 82-88 (2020) [C1]\n\nIntroduction The debate regarding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (E/PAS) raises key issues about the role of the doctor, and the professional, ethical, and clinical dim... [more]\n\nIntroduction The debate regarding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (E/PAS) raises key issues about the role of the doctor, and the professional, ethical, and clinical dimensions of the doctor-patient relationship. This review aimed to examine the published evidence regarding the response of doctors who have participated in E/PAS.Methods Original research papers were identified reporting either qualitative or qualitative data published in peer-reviewed literature between 1980 and March 2018, with a specific focus on the impact on, or response from, physicians to their participation in E/PAS. PRISMA and CASP guidelines were followed.Results Nine relevant papers met selection criteria. Given the limited published data, a descriptive synthesis of quantitative and qualitative findings was performed. Quantitative surveys were limited in scope but identified a mixed set of responses. Where studies measured psychological impact, 30-50% of doctors described emotional burden or discomfort about participation, while findings also identified a comfort or satisfaction in believing the request of the patient was met. Significant, ongoing adverse personal impact was reported between 15% to 20%. A minority of doctors sought personal support, generally from family or friends, rather than colleagues. The themes identified from the qualitative studies were summarized as: 1) coping with a request; 2) understanding the patient; 3) the doctor's role and agency in the death of a patient; 4) the personal impact on the doctor; and 5) professional guidance and support.Significance of results Participation in E/PAS can have a significant emotional impact on participating clinicians. For some doctors, participation can contrast with perception of professional roles, responsibilities, and personal expectations. Despite the importance of this issue to medical practice, this is a largely neglected area of empirical research. The limited studies to date highlight the need to address the responses and impact on clinicians, and the support for clinicians as they navigate this challenging area.\n\nNova 2020 Hess JL, Tylee DS, Barve R, de Jong S, Ophoff RA, Kumarasinghe N, et al., 'Transcriptomic abnormalities in peripheral blood in bipolar disorder, and discrimination of the major psychoses', Schizophrenia Research, 217 124-135 (2020) [C1]\n\nWe performed a transcriptome-wide meta-analysis and gene co-expression network analysis to identify genes and gene networks dysregulated in the peripheral blood of bipolar disorde... [more]\n\nWe performed a transcriptome-wide meta-analysis and gene co-expression network analysis to identify genes and gene networks dysregulated in the peripheral blood of bipolar disorder (BD) cases relative to unaffected comparison subjects, and determined the specificity of the transcriptomic signatures of BD and schizophrenia (SZ). Nineteen genes and 4 gene modules were significantly differentially expressed in BD cases. Thirteen gene modules were shown to be differentially expressed in a combined case-group of BD and SZ subjects called ¿major psychosis¿, including genes biologically linked to apoptosis, reactive oxygen, chromatin remodeling, and immune signaling. No modules were differentially expressed between BD and SZ cases. Machine-learning classifiers trained to separate diagnostic classes based solely on gene expression profiles could distinguish BD cases from unaffected comparison subjects with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.724, as well as BD cases from SZ cases with AUC = 0.677 in withheld test samples. We introduced a novel and straightforward method called ¿polytranscript risk scoring¿ that could distinguish BD cases from unaffected subjects (AUC = 0.672) and SZ cases (AUC = 0.607) significantly better than expected by chance. Taken together, our results highlighted gene expression alterations common to BD and SZ that involve biological processes of inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and chromatin regulation, and highlight disorder-specific changes in gene expression that discriminate the major psychoses.\n\nNova 2020 Austin EK, Handley T, Kiem AS, Rich JL, Perkins D, Kelly B, 'Drought, Wellbeing and Adaptive Capacity: Why Do Some People Stay Well?', International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17 (2020) [C1] Nova 2020 Austin EK, Rich JL, Kiem AS, Handley T, Perkins D, Kelly BJ, 'The concerns about climate change among rural residents in Australia.', Journal of Rural Studies, 75 98-109 (2020) [C1] Nova 2020 Asare-Doku W, Rich J, Kelly B, James C, 'Mental health interventions in the mining industry: a narrative review', Mental Health Review Journal, 25 153-167 (2020) [C1]\n\nPurpose: Previous research has suggested high levels of unaddressed mental health needs among male-dominated work settings.

The mining industry has been a recent focus internationally. This paper aims to critically examine research regarding organizational mental health interventions for people working in mining industries. Design/methodology/approach: The narrative review used a systematic standardized search strategy in six databases and grey literature from 1990 to 2019. Findings: Of the 418 studies identified, seven studies (five quantitative and two qualitative studies) met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of these studies revealed the organisational interventions available to address mental health needs of miners. Interventions were categorised into organisational and individual-focused approaches. Evidence shows there is great potential in conducting workplace mental health programs, yet further research is required to create a strong evidence base for substantiated policy and practice implications. Practical implications: Mental health interventions and programs should be available in mining industry to enhance mental health. Organisations can also improve mental health by implementing significant changes in the work environment and identifying workplace factors that induce strain and contribute to psychological distress in employees. Attempt can be made at restructuring safety policies and practices to include mental health, addressing organisational structures such as work schedules and providing training for managers and supervisors. Originality/value: This review focuses on the unique characteristics pertaining to male-dominated mining industries and workplace mental health interventions which are aimed at supporting employee mental health.\n\nNova 2020 Salvador-Carulla L, Rosenberg S, Mendoza J, Tabatabaei-Jafari H, 'Rapid response to crisis: Health system lessons from the active period of COVID-19', HEALTH POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY, 9 578-586 (2020) [C1] Nova 2020 Carey M, Sanson-Fisher R, Zwar N, Mazza D, Meadows G, Piterman L, et al., 'Improving depression outcomes among Australian primary care patients: protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial', BMJ OPEN, 10 (2020) 2020 Garvey G, Cunningham J, Mayer C, Letendre A, Shaw J, Anderson K, Kelly B, 'Psychosocial aspects of delivering cancer care to indigenous people: An overview', Journal of Global Oncology, 2020 148-154 (2020) [C1]\n\nGlobally, a growing body of evidence has reported significant disparities in cancer outcomes between indigenous and nonindigenous people.

However, the nature and mechanisms of these pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We performed analyses of 232,964 cases and 494,162 controls from genome-wide studies of anorexia nervosa, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome. Genetic correlation analyses revealed a meaningful structure within the eight disorders, identifying three groups of inter-related disorders. Meta-analysis across these eight disorders detected 109 loci associated with at least two psychiatric disorders, including 23 loci with pleiotropic effects on four or more disorders and 11 loci with antagonistic effects on multiple disorders. The pleiotropic loci are located within genes that show heightened expression in the brain throughout the lifespan, beginning prenatally in the second trimester, and play prominent roles in neurodevelopmental processes. These findings have important implications for psychiatric nosology, drug development, and risk prediction.\n\nNova 2019 Clancy R, Lewin TJ, Bowman JA, Kelly BJ, Mullen AD, Flanagan K, Hazelton MJ, 'Providing physical health care for people accessing mental health services: Clinicians perceptions of their role', International Journal of Mental Health Nursing, 28 256-267 (2019) [C1]\n\nThe prevalence of health risk behaviours and associated poor physical health is high in people with severe mental illness.

Mental health service guidelines and policies stipulate that mental health services should address physical health of people who access services. This study reports results from a large, interdisciplinary, cross-sectional study exploring mental health clinicians¿ (n¿=¿385) views of role legitimacy in physical health service provision. All disciplines reported that mental health clinicians have a role to play in addressing the physical health of consumers. Among mental health clinicians, psychiatrists and mental health nurses received higher endorsement than allied health clinicians in relation to the provision of physical health care, with primary care providers including general practitioners also ranking highly. As community mental health services routinely appoint allied health staff to case management roles, a challenge for services and a challenge for clinicians are to ensure that physical health and the effects of medication are monitored appropriately and systematically. Online and telephone support services received relatively lower endorsement. As the availability of nonface to face services increases, there is a need to explore their utility in this population and where appropriate promote their uptake.\n\nNova 2019 Shaw J, Sethi S, Vaccaro L, Beatty L, Kirsten L, Kissane D, et al., 'Is care really shared?

Methods: Sixty-eight participants (mean age 20.8) meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for MDD were randomised to an Immediate intervention or Control/delayed condition (n = 34 per group). The integrated intervention comprised an initial session of motivational interviewing (MI) followed by a 12-week, multi-modal exercise program. Changes in depressive symptom profiles were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) total score and factorial symptom subscales. Results: There were significant differential improvements in BDI-II total scores post-treatment among intervention participants, which were also observed across the cognitive and affective subscales. Individual BDI-II items from the cognitive subscale showing significant differential improvement related to negative self-concept, while those from the affective subscale related to interest/activation; the energy item within the somatic subscale also revealed significant differential improvement. Significant differential improvements were also observed in exercise participation, negative automatic thoughts, behavioural activation and bench press repetitions among intervention participants, which correlated significantly with depression improvements. Limitations: The exercise intervention was delivered in a supervised, group format and potential social meditators of change cannot be excluded. Conclusions: Exercise differentially effects depressive symptom profiles with similar antidepressant effects as would be expected from psychological therapies improving negative cognition and emotional health.\n\nNova 2019 Vaccaro L, Shaw J, Sethi S, Kirsten L, Beatty L, Mitchell G, et al., 'Barriers and facilitators to community-based psycho-oncology services: A qualitative study of health professionals attitudes to the feasibility and acceptability of a shared care model', Psycho-Oncology, 28 1862-1870 (2019) [C1]\n\nObjective: Psychological therapies combined with medication are effective treatments for depression and anxiety in patients with cancer.

However, the psycho-oncology workforce is insufficient to meet patient need and is hard to access outside of the major cities. To bridge this gap, innovative models of care are required. Implementation of a new model of care requires attention to the facilitators and barriers. The aim of this study was to explore stakeholders¿ attitudes to the feasibility and acceptability of a community-based, shared care model for the treatment of depression and anxiety. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with community-based clinical psychologists (n = 10), general practitioners (n = 6), and hospital-based psychologists working in psycho-oncology (n = 9). Framework analysis was conducted to identify key themes. Results: All stakeholders perceived the model as feasible and acceptable. Potential barriers/facilitators to implementation were summarised under six key themes: (a) initiative, ownership, and autonomy; (b) resources; (c) pathway establishment; (d) support; (e) skill acquisition; and (f) patient engagement. Facilitators included quality communication between health professionals across primary and tertiary care and appropriate education and support for community-based clinicians. Conclusions: This in-depth exploration of Australian health professionals¿ perceptions of the feasibility and acceptability of a community-based model of psycho-oncology care revealed that most clinicians were willing to adopt the proposed changes into practice.

This study explores the contributions of a range of individual, social, and community factors to the trajectory of depressive symptoms among a cohort of rural and remote residents. Methods: Data from four waves of the Australian Rural Mental Health Study (baseline n = 2639), a 5¿year longitudinal study of rural community residents, were examined within generalized linear mixed models to predict depressive symptoms. Depression was measured using the PHQ-9, with key correlates including social support, employment status, financial wellbeing, neuroticism, and rural community factors. Results: Moderate-to-severe depression was reported by 6.3% of the baseline sample. Being permanently unable to work resulted in over a threefold increase in the odds of depression at the following survey wave. Self-rated financial hardship was associated with a fourfold increase in the odds of future depression, as was a high level of community concerns. Neuroticism and tobacco use also made a significant independent contribution to future depressive symptoms. Interpersonal support was a protective factor, reducing the odds of next-wave depression by 64%. Conclusion: Financial and employment-related difficulties appear to be important risk factors for depression, and targeting individuals experiencing such difficulties may be an effective means of reducing depression among certain sub-groups. Strategies to prevent depression in rural and remote Australia may benefit from a focus on interpersonal and community-level support, as the effects of this support are lasting and contribute to a reduced likelihood of depressive episodes in future years.\n\nNova 2019 King TL, Batterham PJ, Lingard H, Gullestrup J, Lockwood C, Harvey SB, et al., 'Are Young Men Getting the Message?

In this qualitative, descriptive study, we used purposeful sampling and recruited 10 acute care nurses. Interviews were conducted from 2011 to 2012 and were recorded, transcribed, and returned to participants to verify their accuracy. Data were categorized and analyzed to determine four emergent themes and subthemes. The four themes were: rescuing patients, effects on nurses, professional responsibility, and needs of nurses. Our analysis indicated that nurses need organizational responses to adverse events, including the provision of information and collegial support after adverse events occur.

Rural and remote regions tend to be characterised by poorer socioeconomic conditions than urban areas, yet findings regarding differences in mental health between rural and urban areas have been inconsistent. This suggests that other features of these areas may reduce the impact of hardship on mental health. Little research has explored the relationship of financial hardship or deprivation with mental health across geographical areas.Methods. Data were analysed from a large longitudinal Australian study of the mental health of individuals living in regional and remote communities. Financial hardship was measured using items from previous Australian national population research, along with measures of psychological distress (Kessler-10), social networks/support and community characteristics/locality, including rurality/remoteness (inner regional; outer regional; remote/very remote). Multilevel logistic regression modelling was used to examine the relationship between hardship, locality and distress. Supplementary analysis was undertaken using Australian Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey data.Results. 2161 respondents from the Australian Rural Mental Health Study (1879 households) completed a baseline survey with 26% from remote or very remote regions. A significant association was detected between the number of hardship items and psychological distress in regional areas. Living in a remote location was associated with a lower number of hardships, lower risk of any hardship and lower risk of reporting three of the seven individual hardship items. Increasing hardship was associated with no change in distress for those living in remote areas. Respondents from remote areas were more likely to report seeking help from welfare organisations than regional residents. Findings were confirmed with sensitivity tests, including replication with HILDA data, the use of alternative measures of socioeconomic circumstances and the application of different analytic methods.Conclusions.
