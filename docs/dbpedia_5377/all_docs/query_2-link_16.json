        "text": "By car\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Newcastle area is at least two hours' drive north from the centre of Sydney on the Pacific Motorway (M1). This stretch of road is a major commuter route for traffic from the Central Coast and North Shore so travel time increases significantly in the peaks to and from Sydney.\n\nThe Pacific Motorway is on the western side of Lake Macquarie. To travel up the eastern side of Lake Macquarie (through Swansea) then take the \"Charlestown\" exit (A43/Doyalson Link Road). This route is more scenic, more hilly, and less congested (though it takes a few minutes longer). If you follow this route you will eventually come to the Newcastle Inner City Bypass (A43) at Bennett's Green which you can take if you wish to head northwest (towards Lambton). Otherwise veer right to keep following the Pacific Highway until you reach Charlestown and then follow the signs to the city.\n\nTraffic during holiday periods and long weekends is also affected, with heavy northbound traffic at the beginning of the period as Sydneysiders flee the city for the weekend, and heavy southbound traffic as they return.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nSydney's Central, Strathfield, Epping and Hornsby stations have regular trains to via the Central Coast. Travelling time varies between 2 and 3 hours. This line uses the Opal card (the same as in Sydney) and trips from Sydney are quite comfortable and cheap at $8.30 peak and $5.81 off-peak. You can also use your contact-less credit card to at the Opal gates if you don't have an Opal Card.\n\nTrains terminate at Newcastle Interchange, where you can transfer to light rail to go to the CBD or beach.\n\nThere is also a train service from Newcastle Interchange to various Hunter towns such as Maitland. Check the Sydney Trains website for trackwork along the Central Coast & Newcastle Line (CCN); when these occur, buses replace trains between stations and can add an hour to the trip.\n\nSeveral NSW TrainLink regional services pass through Newcastle's (approximately 5 km from the CBD) daily from Sydney and the Central Coast to the south and from the Northern Rivers and New England. These trains are more expensive than intercity services and tickets must be booked in advance, but they are somewhat more comfortable and are also faster. Occasionally NSW TrainLink discount tickets offer discounts, and $1 fares for kids, so it may be worthwhile checking their fares.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nFlying may not be the fastest way to travel such a short distance as Sydney to Newcastle, especially since there are only a handful of flights every day, and the airport is not particularly central to Newcastle. However, the flight is particularly scenic, especially on a fine day, as there are stunning views of the northern beaches between Sydney and Newcastle. It can be well worth finding an excuse to fly if the cost is not an issue.\n\nIf flying into Sydney Airport, then take the train to Sydney Central station, and then change for the next train to Newcastle. The entire journey will be around 2.5 hours.\n\nBy bike\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Cycling in New South Wales\n\nRiding a bicycle is possible, and infrastructure is slowly being built, but takes some time to discover. Select areas around Wickham, Islington, and along Honeysuckle Drive have some infrastructure, quiet streets, a gentle terrain along waterways that can be quite pleasant to ride through. Other areas which have some infrastructure are around Adamstown and Kotara Shopping Centre. It is possible to ride to and in the surroundings of the John Hunter Hospital, University of Newcastle but these are up significant gradients. Even so, much riding will occur on roads shared with motor vehicles.\n\nOcean baths\n\n[edit]\n\nNo visit to Newcastle during the warmer months would be complete without taking a dip in the ocean baths. On sunny days you can sunbathe on the Grandstand on the Fort side of the baths.\n\nThe baths are also open during the winter, for the more adventurous. The Newcastle baths are home to the \"Newcastle Pirates\", a winter swimming club not unlike the Icebergs or Polar Bears of other places."
