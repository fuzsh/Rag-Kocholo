        "text": "Overview\n\nFew places in the world are as spectacular as the coastline stretching from Newcastle to Kiama in New South Wales, Australia. Beautiful coasts, national parks, museums, and fascinating rock layers that give testimony to the biblical account of the global Flood are all found along this southeastern coastline. For instance, you will find numerous coal beds that have been exposed along the craggy coastline. These same coal beds have been found in other parts of the world and actually contain the same kind of plant fossils.\n\nOther Flood evidences can be seen among the spectacular cliffs around the famous Sydney Harbour where you can see rock layers of Hawkesbury Sandstone that were deposited during the middle of the year-long global Flood. In nearby Newcastle (north of Sydney) and Kiama (south of Sydney), volcanic rocks and coal beds, included in the sequence of rock layers, give testimony to the violence of the Flood that rapidly deposited sediment layers across vast areas of the world.\n\nWith a little preparation, this beautiful destination can provide many teachable moments about the Flood of NoahÂ´s day that left its indelible marks in the rock layers we see today.\n\nPoints of Interest\n\nHelpful Tips"
