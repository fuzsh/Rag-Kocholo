[more]\n\nDespite their importance for understanding consumer-resource dynamics, the dietary responses of large terrestrial predators to variations in prey richness and competition pressure are unclear. While a greater predator selectivity along with increasing prey abundance would be expected under an optimal foraging scenario, there is some evidence that predators may broaden their diet where there is a greater resource diversity. Furthermore, the use of large prey may be limited by increasing presence of competitors. We considered three widespread large carnivores (the grey wolf Canis lupus, the puma Puma concolor and the leopard Panthera pardus), whose distribution range encompasses different continents, with different communities of prey/competitors. We expected that the potential to modulate their use of large prey according to prey richness would vary according to different levels of potential competition. We collated data from more than 240 studies of the diets of wolf, puma and leopard to model whether the relationships between the diversity of used large prey (i.e. the Large Prey Index) and prey richness was modulated by carnivore richness, in different continents. The wolf showed an increase in the Large Prey Index with prey richness across its distribution range, where it is usually the apex predator in areas from which data are available. Conversely, the leopard showed this pattern in Asia, but not in Africa, where it often coexists with a greater array of potential competitors. For the puma, the Large Prey Index increased with prey richness throughout its distribution range, except in the areas where the larger and dominant jaguar also occurred. By emphasising the complex relationships between prey richness and predator diets, our results testify to the suppressive effects of larger competitors over the use of large prey by subordinate carnivores.\n\nNova 2024 Malla G, Ray P, Srinivas Y, Malla S, Reddy TB, Hayward M, Sivakumar K, 'Fish on the platter!

A close look at the literature indicates that fishing cats are piscivorous; however, this is based on very few studies. Understanding the patterns of resource utilisation by species is crucial for assessing their role in ecosystems and in ensuring their conservation. Therefore, our study presents insights into fishing cat feeding patterns from mangroves of the Godavari delta, Andhra Pradesh, India. We collected 303 putative fishing cat scats and conducted diet¿analysis using 120 genetically identified scats. Our analysis revealed that fish was the most important prey for fishing cats in the study area (61.6% in frequency of occurrence), followed by crabs (30%) and rodents (28.3%). The prey composition did not vary significantly between the three seasons but there were differences between the survey years. The niche breadth also varied across the three seasons, with lowest niche breadth estimated in summers (0.36) with highest contribution of fish in the diet and highest in winters (0.75) probably due to increased contribution of other prey items along with fish. Our results suggest that long-term conservation and survival of the fishing cats depends on fish populations, which are the main prey of the species and thus recommend the need to protect the fish populations in the Godavari delta and the surrounding riverine habitats. Given the importance of fish to the diet of the fishing cat, the health of waterways throughout their distribution must be one of the focal strategies of conservation action.\n\nNova 2024 Chan CMH, Owers CJ, Fuller S, Hayward MW, Moverley D, Griffin AS, 'Capacity and capability of remote sensing to inform invasive plant species management in the Pacific Islands region', Conservation Biology, 2024 Jones J, Griffin AS, Agbola FW, Hayward MW, 'Role of national regime ideology for predicting biodiversity outcomes', CONSERVATION BIOLOGY, [C1] 2023 Hayward MW, Mitchell CD, Kamler JF, Rippon P, Heit DR, Nams V, Montgomery RA, 'Diet selection in the Coyote Canis latrans', JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY, 104 1338-1352 (2023) [C1] Nova 2023 Montgomery RA, Boudinot LA, Mudumba T, Can ÖE, Droge E, Johnson PJ, et al., 'Functionally connecting collaring and conservation to create more actionable telemetry research', Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation, 21 209-215 (2023) [C1]\n\nWhile telemetry technology has undoubtedly revolutionized ecological research, the impacts to conservation remain in question.

Conservation is, after all, an applied discipline with research that is intentionally designed to inform policies and practices that can demonstrably protect biodiversity. Though telemetry is a tool that is commonly used to raise conservation funding, the technology itself cannot generate these policies and practices. Rather, it is the outputs of the analytical processes interrogating the data deriving from telemetry systems that can do so. This distinction is not semantic but rather fundamental to creating more actionable research. We developed conceptual frameworks to delineate the pathways by which telemetry research can be structured to inform conservation policies, practices, and the decisions of funders motivated to support conservation. We demonstrate how the application of these frameworks can reduce the research-implementation gap so as to make biodiversity conservation more effective. While our assessment uses collaring as a case study, our conceptual frameworks are applicable to all research using animal-borne technology seeking to promote the recovery of species of conservation concern.\n\nNova 2023 Parker DM, Nams VO, Balme GA, Begg C, Begg K, Bidner L, et al., 'The implications of large home range size in a solitary felid, the Leopard (Panthera pardus)', JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY, 104 1353-1363 (2023) [C1] Nova 2023 McRae LJ, Griffin AS, Tuckey K, Hayward MW, 'The population density and trap-revealed home range of short-eared possums ( Nova 2023 Stock SE, Klop-Toker K, Wallace S, Kelly O, Callen A, Seeto R, et al., 'Uncovering inbreeding, small populations, and strong genetic isolation in an Australian threatened frog, Litoria littlejohni', Conservation Genetics, 24 575-588 (2023) [C1]\n\nThe status of many amphibian populations remains unclear due to undetected declines driven by disease and difficulties in obtaining accurate population estimates.

Here, we used genome complexity reduction-based sequencing technology to study the poorly understood Littlejohn¿s treefrog, Litoria littlejohni across its fragmented distribution in eastern Australia. We detected five identifiable genetic clusters, with moderate to strong genetic isolation. At a regional scale, population isolation was likely driven by population crashes, resulting in small populations impacted by founder effects. Moderate genetic isolation was detected among populations on the Woronora Plateau despite short distances between population clusters. Evidence of recent declines was apparent in three populations that had very small effective population size, reduced genetic diversity and high inbreeding values. The rates of inbreeding detected in these populations combined with their small size leave these populations at elevated risk of extinction. The Cordeaux Cluster was identified as the most robust population as it was the largest and most genetically diverse. This study exemplifies the value of employing genetic methods to study rare, cryptic species. Despite low recapture rates using traditional capture-recapture demographic methods, we were able to derive population estimates, describe patterns of gene flow, and demonstrate the need for urgent conservation management.\n\nNova 2023 Hayward MW, Hayward GJ, Kerley GIH, 'Space use of ungulate prey relative to lions is affected by prey species and predator behavior but not wind direction', Ecological Research, 38 639-650 (2023) [C1] Nova 2023 Nolan N, Hayward MW, Klop-Toker K, Mahony M, Lemckert F, Callen A, 'Complex Organisms Must Deal with Complex Threats: How Does Amphibian Conservation Deal with Biphasic Life Cycles?', Animals, 13 1634-1634 [C1] Nova 2023 Muneza ABB, Amakobe B, Kasaine S, Kramer DBB, Githiru M, Roloff GJJ, et al., 'Socio-economic factors correlating with illegal use of giraffe body parts', ORYX, 57 457-466 (2023) [C1] Nova 2023 Nams VO, Parker DM, Weise FJ, Patterson BD, Buij R, Radloff FGT, et al., 'Spatial patterns of large African cats: a large-scale study on density, home range size, and home range overlap of lions Panthera leo and leopards Panthera pardus', Mammal Review, 53 49-64 (2023) [C1]\n\nSpatial patterns of and competition for resources by territorial carnivores are typically explained by two hypotheses: 1) the territorial defence hypothesis and 2) the searching e... [more]\n\nSpatial patterns of and competition for resources by territorial carnivores are typically explained by two hypotheses: 1) the territorial defence hypothesis and 2) the searching efficiency hypothesis. According to the territorial defence hypothesis, when food resources are abundant, carnivore densities will be high and home ranges small. In addition, carnivores can maximise their necessary energy intake with minimal territorial defence. At medium resource levels, larger ranges will be needed, and it will become more economically beneficial to defend resources against a lower density of competitors. At low resource levels, carnivore densities will be low and home ranges large, but resources will be too scarce to make it beneficial to defend such large territories. Thus, home range overlap will be minimal at intermediate carnivore densities. According to the searching efficiency hypothesis, there is a cost to knowing a home range. Larger areas are harder to learn and easier to forget, so carnivores constantly need to keep their cognitive map updated by regularly revisiting parts of their home ranges. Consequently, when resources are scarce, carnivores require larger home ranges to acquire sufficient food. These larger home ranges lead to more overlap among individuals' ranges, so that overlap in home ranges is largest when food availability is the lowest. Since conspecific density is low when food availability is low, this hypothesis predicts that overlap is largest when densities are the lowest. We measured home range overlap and used a novel method to compare intraspecific home range overlaps for lions Panthera leo (n¿=¿149) and leopards Panthera pardus (n¿=¿111) in Africa. We estimated home range sizes from telemetry location data and gathered carnivore density data from the literature. Our results did not support the territorial defence hypothesis for either species. Lion prides increased their home range overlap at conspecific lower densities whereas leopards did not. Lion pride changes in overlap were primarily due to increases in group size at lower densities. By contrast, the unique dispersal strategies of leopards led to reduced overlap at lower densities. However, when human-caused mortality was higher, leopards increased their home range overlap. Although lions and leopards are territorial, their territorial behaviour was less important than the acquisition of food in determining their space use. Such information is crucial for the future conservation of these two iconic African carnivores.\n\nNova 2023 Alley C, Beard P, Clulow J, Griffin A, Fawcett A, James G, Hayward MW, 'Assessing the effectiveness of long-term monitoring of the Broad-toothed Rat in the Barrington Tops National Park, Australia', Ecological Management and Restoration, 24 47-55 (2023) [C1]\n\nBiodiversity monitoring is crucial for effective conservation efforts.

Effective monitoring allows managers to determine the status and trends of biodiversity, as well as the success of conservation actions. The population of the Broad-toothed Rats (Mastacomys fuscus) in the Barrington Tops National Park New South Wales, Australia has been monitored since 1999 via scat and live-trapping surveys. We reviewed the methods used and analysed the data produced with the aim of describing patterns of population change over time using a range of outcome variables and identifying different climate correlates. A secondary aim was to explore the use of population statistics that account for imperfect detection by comparing naïve occupancy, with an index of relative abundance based on trap effort, the latency to find scats during scat surveys and an occupancy model based on trapping surveys. Neither of these three methods accounts for detectability variation. Naïve occupancy decreased slightly over time, while the relative abundance based on trap effort revealed no evidence of change. Additionally, naïve occupancy decreased with increasing temperature while temperature had no clear impact on relative abundance. Finally, precipitation had no impact on either naïve occupancy or relative abundance. We found no evidence of a relationship between the latency to find scats and the index of relative abundance, suggesting that one or neither is related to actual abundance. Finally, a multi-season occupancy model found occupancy probability to be 0.78 ± 0.23 (standard error); detection probability as 0.51 ± 0.06; seasonal colonisation rate as 0.36 ± 0.13 and seasonal extinction rate at 0.44 ± 0.13. We conclude that despite significant investment in monitoring, this historical data set does not allow managers to ascertain whether population change has occurred and to identify potential drivers of change. Careful consideration of future methods, in particular, whether there is imperfect detection in scat surveys, will help to inform future monitoring.\n\nNova 2023 Mills KL, Belant JL, Beukes M, Dröge E, Everatt KT, Fyumagwa R, et al., 'Tradeoffs between resources and risks shape the responses of a large carnivore to human disturbance.', Communications biology, 6 986 (2023) [C1] Nova 2023 Raoult V, Pirotta V, Gaston TF, Norman B, Reynolds S, Smith TM, et al., 'Widespread exposure of marine parks, whales, and whale sharks to shipping', MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH, 74 75-85 (2023) [C1] Nova 2022 Hayward MW, Meyer NFV, Balkenhol N, Beranek CT, Bugir CK, Bushell KV, et al., 'Intergenerational Inequity: Stealing the Joy and Benefits of Nature From Our Children', Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, 10 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Muneza AB, Linden DW, Kimaro MH, Dickman AJ, Macdonald DW, Roloff GJ, et al., 'Exploring the connections between giraffe skin disease and lion predation', JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY, 316 49-60 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Lanszki J, Hayward MW, Ranc N, Zalewski A, 'Dietary flexibility promotes range expansion: The case of golden jackals in Eurasia', JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY, 49 993-1005 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Ienna M, Rofe A, Gendi M, Douglas HE, Kelly M, Hayward MW, et al., 'The Relative Role of Knowledge and Empathy in Predicting Pro-Environmental Attitudes and Behavior', SUSTAINABILITY, 14 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Montgomery RA, Raupp J, Miller SA, Wijers M, Lisowsky R, Comar A, et al., 'The hunting modes of human predation and potential nonconsumptive effects on animal populations', Biological Conservation, 265 (2022) [C1]\n\nWhen seeking prey, predators adaptively deploy strategies coarsely divided into sit-and-wait, sit-and-pursue, or active hunting modes.

Though the hunting modes of many predators have been extensively studied, the implications of the hunting modes of human (Homo sapiens) predation are not yet fully understood. We conducted an extensive literature review to document human hunting modes and explore the ways in which these modes may shape animal populations via nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) of human predation. Among 169 studies published between 1972 and 2020, we found that humans used 27 hunting tools among 19 different hunting techniques when pursuing terrestrial prey. Most accounts described humans as using the active hunting mode (58%; n = 139 of 241), followed by the sit-and-wait hunting mode (41%; n = 98 of 241), and finally the sit-and-pursue hunting mode (2%; n = 4 of 241). While non-human predators tend to be evolutionarily adapted to the use of just one hunting mode, humans showed profound plasticity by deploying all three hunting modes in pursuit of prey species from 34 taxonomic orders spanning six orders of magnitude in body size (from 27 g to 4400 kg). Considerable evidence has documented the vast number of ways in which humans directly impact the functioning of the natural world. Our research complements that work by demonstrating the indirect pathways by which humans may affect animal populations and the landscapes over which these interactions occur, via NCEs deriving from the hunting modes of human predation, with important implications for animal conservation.\n\nNova 2022 Muneza AB, Amakobe B, Kasaine S, Kramer DB, Githiru M, Roloff GJ, et al., 'Complex Ways in Which Landscape Conditions and Risks Affect Human Attitudes Towards Wildlife', CONSERVATION & SOCIETY, 20 283-292 [C1] Nova 2022 Longchar S, Hayward MW, 'First photographic records and conservation status of Asiatic black and sun bears in Nagaland, India', URSUS, 33 (2022) [C1] Nova 2022 Hayward MW, Chalup S, Khan J, Callen A, Klop-Toker K, Griffin A, 'A call to scale up biodiversity monitoring from idiosyncratic, small-scale programmes to coordinated, comprehensive and continuous monitoring across large scales', Australian Zoologist, 42 514-533 (2022) [C1]\n\nConservation managers cannot manage what they don&apos;t know about, yet our existing biodiversity monitoring is idiosyncratic and small in scale.

One of Australia's commitments to the Convention for Biological Diversity in 2015 was the creation of a national biodiversity monitoring programme. This has not yet occurred despite the urgent need to monitor common and threatened species, as highlighted by the challenges of determining the biodiversity impacts of the Black Summer fires of 2019/20. In light of improvements to automation, miniaturisation and powering devices, the world urgently needs to scale-up biodiversity monitoring to become coordinated, comprehensive and continuous across large scales. We propose the BIOMON project that could achieve this where individual sensor nodes use machine learning models to identify biodiversity via sound or photos onboard. This could be coupled with abiotic data on temperature and humidity, plus factors such as bushfire smoke. Nodes would be set within networks that transmit the results back to a central cloud repository where robust analyses are conducted and provided free to the public (along with the raw data). Network arrays could be set up across entire continents to measure the change in biodiversity. No one has achieved this yet, and significant challenges remain associated with training the algorithms, low power cellular network coverage, sensor power versus memory trade-offs, and sensor network placement. Much work is still needed to achieve these goals; however we are living in the 21st Century and such lofty goals cannot be achieved unless we start working towards them.\n\nNova 2022 Nams VO, Hayward MW, 'A method to predict overall food preferences', PLOS ONE, 17 (2022) [C1] Nova 2021 Narasimmarajan K, Hayward MW, Mathai MT, 'Assessing the occurrence and resource use pattern of smooth-coated otters Lutrogale Perspicillata Geoffroy (Carnivora, Mustelidae) in the Moyar River of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot', International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

Sometimes referred to as a term best left undefined, the niche concept nonetheless spans ecology. Deeply rooted in the Darwinian struggle for survival, ¿niche¿ has been a core, although slippery, idea in ecology since its origins. What ecologists mean by niche has changed semantically over time. In this paper, we review the history of the term, focusing on its uses and the disagreements that have arisen over it within ecology. Because classic niche concepts are not exclusive and share some similarities, we disentangle them into key theoretical components to create a heuristic classification scheme for niche concepts. We, therefore, analyze coherence on rhetoric within the ecological literature, by classifying how ecologists use niche concepts in their writing, aiming at clarifying communication on what is being studied. To assess if modern ecological theories are coherent in their usage of the niche concept, we surveyed a sample of three research areas: ecological niche modeling, coexistence between species and meta-communities. We found that research agendas are segregated when it comes to rhetoric about niches. Ecologists have long tried to achieve a truly unifying biodiversity theory, or at least a universal definition of niche. We, however, move in the opposite direction and suggest that the niche concept should be dismembered into its key components, highlighting which elements of the concept are being addressed and analyzed. Explicitly stating to which niche concept a study is referring may enhance communication among researchers from different backgrounds and perhaps alleviate this century-old dilemma.\n\nNova 2021 Bugir CK, Peres CA, White KS, Montgomery RA, Griffin AS, Rippon P, et al., 'Prey preferences of modern human hunter-gatherers', FOOD WEBS, 26 (2021) [C1] Nova 2020 Lennox RJ, Harcourt R, Bennett JR, Davies A, Ford AT, Frey RM, et al., 'A Novel Framework to Protect Animal Data in a World of Ecosurveillance', Bioscience, 70 468-476 (2020) [C1] Nova 2020 Shuttleworth CM, Brady D, Cross P, Gardner L, Greenwood A, Jackson N, et al., 'Recalibrating risk: Implications of squirrelpox virus for successful red squirrel translocations within mainland UK', CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE, 3 (2020) 2020 Bamber JA, Shuttleworth CM, Hayward MW, Everest DJ, 'Reinstating trophic cascades as an applied conservation tool to protect forest ecosystems from invasive grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis)', Food Webs, 25 (2020) [C1] Nova 2020 Bamber JA, Shuttleworth CM, Hayward MW, 'Do differing levels of boldness influence the success of translocation?

Many papers attempt to distinguish between the two terms through a series of descriptive attributes: historic baselines, landscape-driven transformation, ongoing human intervention, the connection of people with nature, and the creation of novel ecosystems. Here, we discuss the overlap between these terms and illustrate that the creation of novel ecosystems provides the clearest distinction between rewilding and restoration. If the definition of rewilding is distilled down to its most unique component, the creation of novel ecosystems, perhaps scientists can then work to produce a clear framework for rewilding that is based on best conservation practice.\n\nNova 2020 Meyer NFV, Balkenhol N, Dutta T, Hofman M, Meyer J-Y, Ritchie EG, et al., 'Beyond species counts for assessing, valuing, and conserving biodiversity: response to Wallach et al. 2019', CONSERVATION BIOLOGY, 35 369-372 (2020) 2020 Weise FJ, Tomeletso M, Stein AB, Somers MJ, Hayward MW, 'Lions panthera leo prefer killing certain cattle bos taurus types', Animals, 10 (2020) [C1] Nova 2020 Roshier DA, Hotellier FL, Carter A, Kemp L, Potts J, Hayward MW, Legge SM, 'Long-term benefits and short-term costs: small vertebrate responses to predator exclusion and native mammal reintroductions in south-western New South Wales, Australia', WILDLIFE RESEARCH, 47 570-579 (2020) [C1] Nova 2020 Ferretti F, Lovari S, Lucherini M, Hayward M, Stephens PA, 'Only the largest terrestrial carnivores increase their dietary breadth with increasing prey richness', Mammal Review, 50 291-303 (2020) [C1] Nova 2020 Griffin AS, Callen A, Klop-Toker K, Scanlon RJ, Hayward MW, 'Compassionate conservation clashes with conservation biology: Should empathy, compassion and deontological moral principles drive conservation', Frontiers in Psychology, 11 (2020) [C1] Nova 2020 Haswell PM, Kusak J, Jones KA, Hayward MW, 'Fear of the dark?

We argue that the tenets of ¿Compassionate Conservation¿ are ideological - that is, they are not scientifically proven to improve conservation outcomes, yet are critical of the current methods that do. In this paper we envision a future with ¿Compassionate Conservation¿ and predict how this might affect global biodiversity conservation. Taken literally, ¿Compassionate Conservation¿ will deny current conservation practices such as captive breeding, introduced species control, biocontrol, conservation fencing, translocation, contraception, disease control and genetic introgression. Five mainstream conservation practices are used to illustrate the far-reaching and dire consequences for global biodiversity if governed by ¿Compassionate Conservation¿. We acknowledge the important role of animal welfare science in conservation practices but argue that ¿Compassionate Conservation¿ aligns more closely with animal liberation principles protecting individuals over populations. Ultimately we fear that a world of ¿Compassionate Conservation¿ could stymie the global conservation efforts required to meet international biodiversity targets derived from evidenced based practice, such as the Aichi targets developed by the Convention on Biological Diversity and adopted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and the United Nations.\n\nNova 2020 Montgomery RA, Macdonald DW, Hayward MW, 'The inducible defences of large mammals to human lethality', Functional Ecology, 34 2426-2441 (2020) [C1]\n\nIn the process of avoiding predation, prey are faced with potentially fitness-compromising trade-offs that have implications for their survival and reproduction.

The nature and strength of these non-consumptive effects at the population level can be equivalent, or even greater, than consumptive effects. Many prey species have evolved defence mechanisms that are induced by predation risk. These inducible defences can be morphological or behavioural in nature. Extensive research has detected these defences in predator¿prey communities across freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Among this vast research however, an influential portion of these systems has not been widely considered. Humans inhabit a level in trophic systems above apex predators. In that position, humans have been referred to as a hyperkeystone or super predator species as they have shown a capacity to consume animals at rates many times higher than any other non-human species. However, the extent to which humans induce adaptive defences in animals is not as clear. Systems involving large mammals may be particularly well-suited for the study of human-induced defences given that these species have been disproportionately exploited (for food and competition) over evolutionary time by humans. To begin this process we first had to examine the context in which large mammals could adaptively evolve inducible defences in relation to human lethality. With the plausibility of these conditions satisfied, we then conducted an extensive review to document the inducible defences that have been detected in large mammals. All of the 187 studies reviewed documented the behavioural plasticity of large mammals to human lethality. No morphological adaptive defences were detected. However, the extent to which the observed behavioural plasticity of large mammals is representative of adaptive inducible defences remains unclear because the fitness trade-offs (i.e. costs), an integral condition for inducible defences to evolve, were implied rather than quantified among close to 92% of this research. We make recommendations for renewed ingenuity in the development of field experiments that can quantify these costs and discuss the implications of human lethality on the ecology, conservation and management of large mammals.

Through engineering and predation, digging mammals may affect burrowing invertebrate assemblages, leading to changes in invertebrate-driven soil engineering. Using a mammal reintroduction sanctuary in southern Australia, we tested how digging mammals alter invertebrate burrows (density and size of burrow entrances) and whether these impacts were scale-dependent. We examined the micro-site (pit-scale) effects of mammal foraging pits on invertebrate burrowing activity by comparing natural and artificial pits and bare-ground, and artificial pits of different dimensions within different microhabitat types. To test how mammals affected invertebrate burrows and soil physical and chemical properties at larger scales, we used an exclusion experiment (plot-scale) and surveys inside and outside a reintroduction reserve (landscape scale). Invertebrate burrows were more numerous in mammal pits than bare-ground and artificial pits, and larger in mammal pits than bare-ground. The density and size of invertebrate burrows depended on pit morphology, with burrow density greatest in narrow bilby pits and large burrows favoured by bettong pits. However, the influence of foraging pits on invertebrate burrows was scale-dependent: changes in invertebrate burrows were not detected at the plot or landscape scale. Only 4.5% of land surface area was occupied by pits and this might be insufficient to alter burrow or soil properties detectably in un-stratified surveys at larger scales. Digging mammals altered the small-scale (but not large-scale) distribution of invertebrate burrows, suggesting that their reintroduction provides an avenue through which to restore the heterogeneity of other organisms and functions in ecosystems.\n\n2019 Allen BL, Allen LR, Ballard G, Drouilly M, Fleming PJS, Hampton JO, et al., 'Bringing objectivity to wildlife management: Welfare effects of guardian dogs', BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION, 236 582-582 (2019) 2019 Hayward MW, Scanlon RJ, Callen A, Howell LG, Klop-Toker KL, Di Blanco Y, et al., 'Reintroducing rewilding to restoration Rejecting the search for novelty', Biological Conservation, 233 255-259 (2019) [C1] Nova 2019 Hayward MW, Callen A, Allen BL, Ballard G, Broekhuis F, Bugir C, et al., 'Deconstructing compassionate conservation', Conservation Biology, 33 760-768 (2019) [C1]\n\nCompassionate conservation focuses on 4 tenets: first, do no harm; individuals matter; inclusivity of individual animals; and peaceful coexistence between humans and animals.

Recently, compassionate conservation has been promoted as an alternative to conventional conservation philosophy. We believe examples presented by compassionate conservationists are deliberately or arbitrarily chosen to focus on mammals; inherently not compassionate; and offer ineffective conservation solutions. Compassionate conservation arbitrarily focuses on charismatic species, notably large predators and megaherbivores. The philosophy is not compassionate when it leaves invasive predators in the environment to cause harm to vastly more individuals of native species or uses the fear of harm by apex predators to terrorize mesopredators. Hindering the control of exotic species (megafauna, predators) in situ will not improve the conservation condition of the majority of biodiversity. The positions taken by so-called compassionate conservationists on particular species and on conservation actions could be extended to hinder other forms of conservation, including translocations, conservation fencing, and fertility control. Animal welfare is incredibly important to conservation, but ironically compassionate conservation does not offer the best welfare outcomes to animals and is often ineffective in achieving conservation goals. Consequently, compassionate conservation may threaten public and governmental support for conservation because of the limited understanding of conservation problems by the general public.\n\nNova 2019 Ripple WJ, Wolf C, Newsome TM, Betts MG, Ceballos G, Courchamp F, et al., 'Are we eating the world's megafauna to extinction?', CONSERVATION LETTERS, 12 (2019) [C1] Nova 2019 Montgomery RA, Kissui BM, Hayward MW, 'Editorial: How Prides of Lion Researchers Are Evolving to Be Interdisciplinary', FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION, 7 (2019) Nova 2019 Carbone C, Hayward M, Bump J, 'Keep a close eye on the tiger', NATURE, 572 586-586 (2019) 2019 Shuttleworth CM, Bertolino S, Gill R, Gurnell J, Hayward MW, Kenward RE, et al., 'Releasing grey squirrels into the wild', VETERINARY RECORD, 184 389-U58 (2019) 2019 Hofman MPG, Hayward MW, Heim M, Marchand P, Rolandsen CM, Mattisson J, et al., 'Right on track?

Interference interactions, harassment and injury from larger carnivores may still pose a risk to smaller mesopredators. Foraging theory suggests that animals should adjust their behaviour accordingly to optimise foraging efficiency and overall fitness, trading off harvest rate with costs to fitness. The foraging behaviour of red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, was studied with automated cameras and a repeated measures giving-up density (GUD) experiment where olfactory risk cues were manipulated. In Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia, red foxes increased GUDs by 34% and quitting harvest rates by 29% in response to wolf urine. In addition to leaving more food behind, foxes also responded to wolf urine by spending less time visiting food patches each day and altering their behaviour in order to compensate for the increased risk when foraging from patches. Thus, red foxes utilised olfaction to assess risk and experienced foraging costs due to the presence of a cue from gray wolves, Canis lupus. This study identifies behavioural mechanisms which may enable competing predators to coexist, and highlights the potential for additional ecosystem service pathways arising from the behaviour of large carnivores. Given the vulnerability of large carnivores to anthropogenic disturbance, a growing human population and intensifying resource consumption, it becomes increasingly important to understand ecological processes so that land can be managed appropriately.\n\n2018 Gibb H, Verdon SJ, Weir T, Johansson T, L'Hotellier F, Hayward MW, 'Testing top-down and bottom-up effects on arid zone beetle assemblages following mammal reintroduction', Austral Ecology, 43 288-300 (2018) [C1]\n\nSpecies extinctions and declines are occurring globally and commonly have cascading effects on ecosystems.

In Australia, mammal extinctions have been extensive, particularly in arid areas, where precipitation drives ecosystems. Many ecologically extinct mammals feed on soil-dwelling insects. However, how this top-down pressure affected their prey and how this contrasts with the bottom-up impacts of fluctuating precipitation remains unclear. We constructed a long-term exclusion experiment in a multi-species mammal reintroduction zone in semi-arid Australia to test how top-down (reintroduced mammals) and bottom-up (precipitation) factors affect root-feeding chafer beetles (Coleoptera: Melolonthinae). We used emergence traps in ten replicate 20¿×¿20¿m plots of control, exclusion and procedural control treatments to trap chafers biannually from 2009 to 2015. Annual precipitation during this period varied from 173 to 481¿mm. Mammal exclusion did not affect chafers, indicating that top-down regulation was not important. Instead, chafer abundance, species density and biomass increased with precipitation. Chafer body size and assemblage composition were best predicted by sampling year, suggesting that random drift determined species abundances. Increased resource availability therefore favoured all species similarly. We thus found no evidence that mammal predation alters chafer populations and conclude that they may be driven primarily by bottom-up processes. Further research should determine if the cascading effects of species loss are less important for herbivores generally than for higher level trophic groups and the role of ecosystem stability in mediating these patterns.\n\n2018 Hayward MW, Ripple WJ, Kerley GIH, Landman M, Plotz RD, Garnett ST, 'Neocolonial Conservation: Is Moving Rhinos to Australia Conservation or Intellectual Property Loss', CONSERVATION LETTERS, 11 (2018) 2018 Montgomery RA, Elliott KC, Hayward MW, Gray SM, Millspaugh JJ, Riley SJ, et al., 'Examining evident interdisciplinarity among prides of lion researchers', Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, 6 1-13 (2018) [C1] Nova 2018 Lanszki J, Hayward MW, Nagyapati N, 'Feeding responses of the golden jackal after reduction of anthropogenic food subsidies', PLOS ONE, 13 (2018) [C1] Nova 2018 Hofman MPG, Hayward MW, Kelly MJ, Balkenhol N, 'Enhancing conservation network design with graph-theory and a measure of protected area effectiveness: Refining wildlife corridors in Belize, Central America', Landscape and Urban Planning, 178 51-59 (2018) [C1] Nova 2017 Mann SA, Van Valkenburgh B, Hayward MW, 'Tooth fracture within the African carnivore guild: the influence of intraguild competition and resource availability', JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY, 303 261-269 (2017) 2017 Hudson LN, Newbold T, Contu S, Hill SLL, Lysenko I, De Palma A, et al., 'The database of the PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems) project', ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION, 7 145-188 (2017) 2017 Haswell PM, Kusak J, Hayward MW, 'Large carnivore impacts are context-dependent', Food Webs, 12 3-13 (2017) [C1]\n\nInteractions between large carnivores and other species may be responsible for impacts that are disproportionately large relative to their density.

Context-dependent interactions between species are common but often poorly described. Caution must be expressed in seeing apex predators as ecological saviours because ecosystem services may not universally apply, particularly if inhibited by anthropogenic activity. This review examines how the impacts of large carnivores are affected by four major contexts (species assemblage, environmental productivity, landscape, predation risk) and the potential for human interference to affect these contexts. Humans are the most dominant landscape and resource user on the planet and our management intervention affects species composition, resource availability, demography, behaviour and interspecific trophic dynamics. Humans can impact large carnivores in much the same way these apex predators impact mesopredators and prey species ¿ through density-mediated (consumptive) and trait/behaviourally-mediated (non-consumptive) pathways. Mesopredator and large herbivore suppression or release, intraguild competition and predation pressure may all be affected by human context. The aim of restoring ¿natural¿ systems is somewhat problematic and not always pragmatic. Interspecific interactions are influenced by context, and humans are often the dominant driver in forming context. If management and conservation goals are to be achieved then it is pivotal to understand how humans influence trophic interactions and how trophic interactions are affected by context. Trade-offs and management interventions can only be implemented successfully if the intricacies of food webs are properly understood.\n\n2017 Gray SM, Montgomery RA, Millspaugh JJ, Hayward MW, 'Spatiotemporal variation in African lion roaring in relation to a dominance shift', JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY, 98 1088-1095 (2017) 2017 Hayward MW, Ward-Fear G, L'Hotellier F, Herman K, Kabat AP, Gibbons JM, 'Could biodiversity loss have increased Australia's bushfire threat?

The fact that species tend to maintain their original climate niche allows predictive maps of invasion risk to anticipate potential invadable areas. Unravelling the mechanisms driving niche shifts can shed light on the management of invasive species. Here, we assessed niche shifts in one of the world's worst invasive species: the wild boar Sus scrofa. We also predicted potential invadable areas based on an ensemble of three ecological niche modelling methods, and evaluated the performance of models calibrated with native vs. pooled (native plus invaded) species records. By disentangling the drivers of change on the exotic wild boar population's niches, we found strong evidence for niche conservatism during biological invasion. Ecological niche models calibrated with both native and pooled range records predicted convergent areas. Also, observed niche shifts are mostly explained by niche unfilling, i.e. there are unoccupied areas in the exotic range where climate is analogous to the native range. Niche unfilling is expected as result of recent colonization and ongoing dispersal, and was potentially stronger for the Neotropics, where a recent wave of introductions for pig-farming and game-hunting has led to high wild boar population growth rates. The invasive potential of wild boar in the Neotropics is probably higher than in other regions, which has profound management implications if we are to prevent their invasion into species-rich areas, such as Amazonia, coupled with expansion of African swine fever and possibly great economic losses. Although the originally Eurasian-wide distribution suggests a pre-adaptation to a wide array of climates, the wild boar world-wide invasion does not exhibit evidence of niche evolution. The invasive potential of the wild boar therefore probably lies on the reproductive, dietary and morphological characteristics of this species, coupled with behavioural thermoregulation.\n\n2017 Hayward MW, Porter L, Lanszki J, Kamler JF, Beck JM, Kerley GIH, et al., 'Factors affecting the prey preferences of jackals (Canidae)', Mammalian Biology, 85 70-82 (2017) [C1]\n\nPrey selection by carnivores can be affected by top-down and bottom-up factors.

For example, large carnivores may facilitate food resources for mesocarnivores by providing carcasses to scavenge, however mesocarnivores may hunt large prey themselves, and their diets might be affected by prey size and behaviour. We reviewed jackal diet studies and determined how the presence of large carnivores and various bottom-up factors affected jackal prey selection. We found 20 studies of black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) from 43 different times or places, and 13 studies of Eurasian golden jackals (Canis aureus) from 23 different times or places reporting on 3900 and 2440 dietary records (i.e. scats or stomach contents), respectively. Black-backed jackals significantly preferred small (<30¿kg) ungulate species that hide their young (duiker Sylvicapra grimmia, bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus and springbok Antidorcas marsupialis), and avoided large (>120¿kg) hider species and follower species of any body size. They had a preferred and accessible prey weight range of 14¿26¿kg, and a predator to ideal prey mass ratio of 1:3.1. Eurasian golden jackal significantly prefer to prey on brown hare (Lepus europaeus; 4¿kg), yielding a predator to preferred prey mass ratio of 1:0.6, and a preferred and accessible prey weight range of 0¿4¿kg and 0¿15¿kg, respectively. Prey preferences of jackals differed significantly in the presence of apex predators, but it was not entirely due to carrion availability of larger prey species. Our results show that jackal diets are affected by both top-down and bottom-up factors, because apex predators as well as prey size and birthing behaviour affected prey preferences of jackals. A better understanding of the factors affecting jackal prey preferences, as presented here, could lead to greater acceptance of mesocarnivores and reduced human-wildlife conflict.\n\n2017 Apollonio M, Belkin VV, Borkowski J, Borodin OI, Borowik T, Cagnacci F, et al., 'Challenges and science-based implications for modern management and conservation of European ungulate populations', Mammal Research, 62 209-217 (2017) [C1]\n\nWildlife management systems face growing challenges to cope with increasingly complex interactions between wildlife populations, the environment and human activities.

As a first step, we developed a Megafauna Conservation Index (MCI) that assesses the spatial, ecological and financial contributions of 152 nations towards conservation of the world's terrestrial megafauna. We chose megafauna because they are particularly valuable in economic, ecological and societal terms, and are challenging and expensive to conserve. We categorised these 152 countries as being above- or below-average performers based on whether their contribution to megafauna conservation was higher or lower than the global mean; ¿major¿ performers or underperformers were those whose contribution exceeded 1 SD over or under the mean, respectively. Ninety percent of countries in North/Central America and 70% of countries in Africa were classified as major or above-average performers, while approximately one-quarter of countries in Asia (25%) and Europe (21%) were identified as major underperformers. We present our index to emphasise the need for measuring conservation performance, to help nations identify how best they could improve their efforts, and to present a starting point for the development of more robust and inclusive measures (noting how the IUCN Red List evolved over time). Our analysis points to three approaches that countries could adopt to improve their contribution to global megafauna conservation, depending on their circumstances: (1) upgrading or expanding their domestic protected area networks, with a particular emphasis on conserving large carnivore and herbivore habitat, (2) increase funding for conservation at home or abroad, or (3) ¿rewilding¿ their landscapes. Once revised and perfected, we recommend publishing regular conservation rankings in the popular media to recognise major-performers, foster healthy pride and competition among nations, and identify ways for governments to improve their performance.\n\n2017 Caravaggi A, Banks PB, Burton AC, Finlay CMV, Haswell PM, Hayward MW, et al., 'A review of camera trapping for conservation behaviour research', Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation, 3 109-122 (2017) [C1]\n\nAn understanding of animal behaviour is important if conservation initiatives are to be effective.

However, quantifying the behaviour of wild animals presents significant challenges. Remote-sensing camera traps are becoming increasingly popular survey instruments that have been used to non-invasively study a variety of animal behaviours, yielding key insights into behavioural repertoires. They are well suited to ethological studies and provide considerable opportunities for generating conservation-relevant behavioural data if novel and robust methodological and analytical solutions can be developed. This paper reviews the current state of camera-trap-based ethological studies, describes new and emerging directions in camera-based conservation behaviour, and highlights a number of limitations and considerations of particular relevance for camera-based studies. Three promising areas of study are discussed: (1) documenting anthropogenic impacts on behaviour; (2) incorporating behavioural responses into management planning and (3) using behavioural indicators such as giving up densities and daily activity patterns. We emphasize the importance of reporting methodological details, utilizing emerging camera trap metadata standards and central data repositories for facilitating reproducibility, comparison and synthesis across studies. Behavioural studies using camera traps are in their infancy; the full potential of the technology is as yet unrealized. Researchers are encouraged to embrace conservation-driven hypotheses in order to meet future challenges and improve the efficacy of conservation and management processes.\n\n2017 Ripple WJ, Chapron G, Vicente Lopez-Bao J, Durant SM, MacDonald DW, Lindsey PA, et al., 'Conserving the World's Megafauna and Biodiversity: The Fierce Urgency of Now', BIOSCIENCE, 67 197-200 (2017) [C1] 2017 Moll RJ, Redilla KM, Mudumba T, Muneza AB, Gray SM, Abade L, et al., 'The many faces of fear: a synthesis of the methodological variation in characterizing predation risk', JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY, 86 749-765 (2017) 2017 Wilson GR, Hayward MW, Wilson C, 'Market-Based Incentives and Private Ownership of Wildlife to Remedy Shortfalls in Government Funding for Conservation', CONSERVATION LETTERS, 10 485-492 (2017) [C1] 2016 Hayward MW, 'Don't bank African rhinos in Australia', NATURE, 534 475-475 (2016) 2016 Ripple WJ, Chapron G, Vicente Lopez-Bao J, Durant SM, Macdonald DW, Lindsey PA, et al., 'Saving the World's Terrestrial Megafauna', BIOSCIENCE, 66 807-812 (2016) 2016 Linnell JDC, Trouwborst A, Boitani L, Kaczensky P, Huber D, Reljic S, et al., 'Border Security Fencing and Wildlife: The End of the Transboundary Paradigm in Eurasia?', PLOS BIOLOGY, 14 (2016) 2016 Moll RJ, Killion AK, Montgomery RA, Tambling CJ, Hayward MW, 'Spatial patterns of African ungulate aggregation reveal complex but limited risk effects from reintroduced carnivores', Ecology, 97 1123-1134 (2016) [C1]\n\nThe landscape of fear model, recently advanced in research on the non-lethal effects of carnivores on ungulates, predicts that prey will exhibit detectable antipredator behavior n... [more]\n\nThe landscape of fear model, recently advanced in research on the non-lethal effects of carnivores on ungulates, predicts that prey will exhibit detectable antipredator behavior not only during risky times (i.e., predators in close proximity) but also in risky places (i.e., habitat where predators kill prey or tend to occur). Aggregation is an important antipredator response in numerous ungulate species, making it a useful metric to evaluate the strength and scope of the landscape of fear in a multi-carnivore, multi-ungulate system. We conducted ungulate surveys over a 2-year period in South Africa to test the influence of three broadscale sources of variation in the landscape on spatial patterns in aggregation: (1) habitat structure, (2) where carnivores tended to occur (i.e., population-level utilization distributions), and (3) where carnivores tended to kill ungulate prey (i.e., probabilistic kill site maps). We analyzed spatial variation in aggregation for six ungulate species exposed to predation from recently reintroduced lion (Panthera leo) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). Although we did detect larger aggregations of ungulates in risky places, these effects existed primarily for smaller-bodied (<150 kg) ungulates and were relatively moderate (change of =4 individuals across all habitats). In comparison, ungulate aggregations tended to increase at a slightly lower rate in habitat that was more open. The lion, an ambush (stalking) carnivore, had stronger influence on ungulate aggregation than the hyena, an active (coursing) carnivore. In addition, places where lions tended to kill prey had a greater effect on ungulate aggregation than places where lions tended to occur, but an opposing pattern existed for hyena. Our study reveals heterogeneity in the landscape of fear and suggests broad-scale risk effects following carnivore reintroduction only moderately influence ungulate aggregation size and vary considerably by predator hunting mode, type of predation risk, and prey species.\n\n2016 Van Valkenburgh B, Hayward MW, Ripple WJ, Meloro C, Roth VL, 'The impact of large terrestrial carnivores on Pleistocene ecosystems', Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 113 862-867 (2016) [C1]\n\nLarge mammalian terrestrial herbivores, such as elephants, have dramatic effects on the ecosystems they inhabit and at high population densities their environmental impacts can be... [more]\n\nLarge mammalian terrestrial herbivores, such as elephants, have dramatic effects on the ecosystems they inhabit and at high population densities their environmental impacts can be devastating. Pleistocene terrestrial ecosystems included a much greater diversity of megaherbivores (e.g., mammoths, mastodons, giant ground sloths) and thus a greater potential for widespread habitat degradation if population sizes were not limited. Nevertheless, based on modern observations, it is generally believed that populations of megaherbivores (>800 kg) are largely immune to the effects of predation and this perception has been extended into the Pleistocene. However, as shown here, the species richness of big carnivores was greater in the Pleistocene and many of them were significantly larger than their modern counterparts. Fossil evidence suggests that interspecific competition among carnivores was relatively intense and reveals that some individuals specialized in consuming megaherbivores. To estimate the potential impact of Pleistocene large carnivores, we use both historic and modern data on predator-prey body mass relationships to predict size ranges of their typical and maximum prey when hunting as individuals and in groups. These prey size ranges are then compared with estimates of juvenile and subadult proboscidean body sizes derived from extant elephant growth data. Young proboscideans at their most vulnerable age fall within the predicted prey size ranges of many of the Pleistocene carnivores. Predation on juveniles can have a greater impact on megaherbivores because of their long interbirth intervals, and consequently, we argue that Pleistocene carnivores had the capacity to, and likely did, limit megaherbivore population sizes.\n\n2016 Coggan NV, Hayward MW, Gibb H, 'Termite activity and decomposition are influenced by digging mammal reintroductions along an aridity gradient', Journal of Arid Environments, 133 85-93 (2016) [C1]\n\nSpecies declines can have broader impacts on ecosystems, particularly when those species act as ecosystem engineers.

Ecosystem engineers modify habitats, indirectly shaping biotic communities. Environmental attributes may limit the direct influence of engineers on habitat properties, indirectly affecting other species and ecological functioning. We used three sites differing in abiotic properties, where endangered digging mammals had been reintroduced, and hypothesised that: Reintroduced mammals affect resource consumption and abandonment by termites, and local factors influence termite interactions with reintroduced mammals. We therefore performed two manipulative experiments: first testing the effects of depth on termite consumption of resources, second, testing resource abandonment by termites following simulated disturbances by determining the proportion of termites remaining at disturbed resources relative to undisturbed controls. Experiments were conducted inside reintroduction enclosures and compared against controls. Resource consumption was ~25% lower, and resource abandonment ~50% higher where digging mammals were reintroduced and termite responses were consistent with decreasing aridity. The near-extinction of native digging mammals from much of Australia is likely to have significantly altered termite activity and decomposition, but impacts may be context-dependent, with aridity potentially playing a key role. Our work suggests, counterintuitively, that ecosystem impacts of reintroductions may be lower in resource-poor sites.\n\n2016 Luther DA, Brooks TM, Butchart SHM, Hayward MW, Kester ME, Lamoreux J, Upgren A, 'Determinants of bird conservation-action implementation and associated population trends of threatened species', Conservation Biology, 30 1338-1346 (2016) [C1]\n\nConservation actions, such as habitat protection, attempt to halt the loss of threatened species and help their populations recover.

The efficiency and the effectiveness of actions have been examined individually. However, conservation actions generally occur simultaneously, so the full suite of implemented conservation actions should be assessed. We used the conservation actions underway for all threatened and near-threatened birds of the world (International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species) to assess which biological (related to taxonomy and ecology) and anthropogenic (related to geoeconomics) factors were associated with the implementation of different classes of conservation actions. We also assessed which conservation actions were associated with population increases in the species targeted. Extinction-risk category was the strongest single predictor of the type of conservation actions implemented, followed by landmass type (continent, oceanic island, etc.) and generation length. Species targeted by invasive nonnative species control or eradication programs, ex situ conservation, international legislation, reintroduction, or education, and awareness-raising activities were more likely to have increasing populations. These results illustrate the importance of developing a predictive science of conservation actions and the relative benefits of each class of implemented conservation action for threatened and near-threatened birds worldwide.\n\n2016 Hayward MW, Ward-Fear G, L'Hotellier F, Herman K, Kabat AP, Gibbons JP, 'Could biodiversity loss have increased Australia's bushfire threat?', Animal Conservation, 19 490-497 (2016) [C1]\n\nEcosystem engineers directly or indirectly affect the availability of resources through changing the physical state of biotic and/or abiotic materials.

Fossorial ecosystem engineers have been hypothesized as affecting fire behaviour through altering litter accumulation and breakdown, however, little evidence of this has been shown to date. Fire is one of the major ecological processes affecting biodiversity globally. Australia has seen the extinction of 29 of 315 terrestrial mammal species in the last 200¿years and several of these species were ecosystem engineers whose fossorial actions may increase the rate of leaf litter breakdown. Thus, their extinction may have altered the rate of litter accumulation and therefore fire ignition potential and rate of spread. We tested whether a reduction in leaf litter was associated with sites where mammalian ecosystem engineers had been reintroduced using a pair-wise, cross-fence comparison at sites spanning the Australian continent. At Scotia (New South Wales), Karakamia (Western Australia) and Yookamurra (South Australia) sanctuaries, leaf litter mass (-24%) and percentage cover of leaf litter (-3%) were significantly lower where reintroduced ecosystem engineers occurred compared to where they were absent, and fire behaviour modelling illustrated this has substantial impacts on flame height and rate of spread. This result has major implications for fire behaviour and management globally wherever ecosystem engineers are now absent as the reduced leaf litter volumes where they occur will lead to decreased flame height and rate of fire spread. This illustrates the need to restore the full suite of biodiversity globally.\n\n2016 Eldred T, Meloro C, Scholtz C, Murphy D, Fincken K, Hayward M, 'Does size matter for horny beetles?

Geometric morphometrics was used to analyse intersexual and interspecific variation of size and shape in the mandibles, heads, pronota and elytra of two sympatric species: Colophon haughtoni and Colophon kawaii. All measured structures showed significant sexual dimorphism, which may result from male-male competition for females. Female mandibles were too small and featureless for analysis, but male Colophon beetles possess large, ornate mandibles for fighting. Males had significantly larger heads and pronota that demonstrated shape changes which may relate to resource diversion to the mandibles and their supporting structures. Females are indistinguishable across species, but males were accurately identified using mandibles, heads and pronota. Male C. kawaii were significantly larger than C. haughtoni for all structures. These results support the species status of C. kawaii, which is currently in doubt due to its hybridisation with C. haughtoni. We also demonstrate the value of geometric morphometrics as a tool which may aid Colophon conservation by providing biological and phylogenetic insights and enabling species identification.\n\n2016 Hayward MW, 'Don't bank African rhinos in Australia (vol 534, pg 475, 2016)', NATURE, 536 30-30 (2016) 2016 Hayward MW, Kamler JF, Montgomery RA, Newlove A, Rostro-García S, Sales LP, Van Valkenburgh B, 'Prey preferences of the jaguar Panthera onca reflect the post-pleistocene demise of large prey', Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, 3 (2016) [C1]\n\nDocumenting the impacts of the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions on predator-prey interactions is a challenge because of the incomplete fossil record and depauperate extant commu... [more]\n\nDocumenting the impacts of the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions on predator-prey interactions is a challenge because of the incomplete fossil record and depauperate extant community structure. We used a comparative ecological approach to investigate whether the existing prey preference patterns of jaguars Panthera onca were potentially affected by the Pleistocene extinctions in the Americas compared with large felids in Africa and Asia. We reviewed the literature and found 25 studies reporting 3214 jaguar kills recorded throughout the species' distribution. We found that jaguars significantly preferred capybara Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris and giant anteater Myrmecophaga tridactyla, and avoided agoutis, carnivorans, primates, black-eared opossum Didelphis marsupialis and tapirs. Generalized linear models showed that jaguars select prey primarily based on socio-ecological and behavioral traits (abundance and herd size), rather than morphological characteristics (body size). Nonetheless, their accessible prey weight range was 6-60 kg, preferred prey weight range was 45-85 kg, and mean mass of significantly preferred prey was 32 ± 13 kg leading to a predator to prey body mass ratio of 1:0.53, which is much less than that of other solitary felids (although 1:0.84 may be the relationship with the smallest jaguars). Compared with other large, solitary felids, jaguars have an unusual predator to prey body mass ratio, show limited effect of prey morphology as a driver of prey selection, lack evidence of optimal foraging beyond their preferred prey, and a lack of preferential hunting on Cetartiodactyla herbivores. These features, coupled with the reduction in jaguar body mass since the Pleistocene, suggest that the loss of larger potential prey items within the preferred and accessible weight ranges at the end-Pleistocene still affects jaguar predatory behavior. It may be that jaguars survived this mass extinction event by preferentially preying on relatively small species.\n\n2015 Eldridge DJ, Woodhouse JN, Curlevski NJA, Hayward M, Brown MV, Neilan BA, 'Soil-foraging animals alter the composition and co-occurrence of microbial communities in a desert shrubland', ISME Journal, 9 2671-2681 (2015) [C1]\n\nAnimals that modify their physical environment by foraging in the soil can have dramatic effects on ecosystem functions and processes.

We compared bacterial and fungal communities in the foraging pits created by bilbies and burrowing bettongs with undisturbed surface soils dominated by biocrusts. Bacterial communities were characterized by Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, and fungal communities by Lecanoromycetes and Archaeosporomycetes. The composition of bacterial or fungal communities was not observed to vary between loamy or sandy soils. There were no differences in richness of either bacterial or fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the soil of young or old foraging pits, or undisturbed soils. Although the bacterial assemblage did not vary among the three microsites, the composition of fungi in undisturbed soils was significantly different from that in old or young foraging pits. Network analysis indicated that a greater number of correlations between bacterial OTUs occurred in undisturbed soils and old pits, whereas a greater number of correlations between fungal OTUs occurred in undisturbed soils. Our study suggests that digging by soil-disturbing animals is likely to create successional shifts in soil microbial and fungal communities, leading to functional shifts associated with the decomposition of organic matter and the fixation of nitrogen. Given the primacy of organic matter decomposition in arid and semi-arid environments, the loss of native soil-foraging animals is likely to impair the ability of these systems to maintain key ecosystem processes such as the mineralization of nitrogen and the breakdown of organic matter, and to recover from disturbance.\n\n2015 Hayward MW, Poh ASL, Cathcart J, Churcher C, Bentley J, Herman K, et al., 'Numbat nirvana: Conservation ecology of the endangered numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus) (Marsupialia:Myrmecobiidae) reintroduced to Scotia and Yookamurra Sanctuaries, Australia', Australian Journal of Zoology, 63 258-269 (2015)\n\nDespite a vigorous reintroduction program between 1985 and 2010, numbat populations in Western Australia are either static or declining.

This study aimed to document the population ecology of numbats at two sites that are going against this trend: Scotia Sanctuary in far western New South Wales and Yookamurra Sanctuary in the riverland of South Australia. Scotia (64659ha) and Yookamurra (5026ha) are conservation reserves owned and managed by the Australian Wildlife Conservancy and where numbats were reintroduced in 1999 and 1993 respectively. Both sites have large conservation-fence-protected introduced-species-free areas where there are no cats (Felis catus) or red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Numbats were sourced from both wild and captive populations. From small founder populations, the Scotia numbats are now estimated to number 169 (113-225) with 44 at Yookamurra. Radio-collared individuals at Scotia were active between 13 and 31°C. Females had home ranges of 28.3±6.8ha and males 96.6±18.2ha, which leads to an estimated sustainable population or carrying capacity of 413-502 at Scotia. Captive-bred animals from Perth Zoo had a high mortality rate upon reintroduction at Scotia due to predation by raptors and starvation. The habitat preferences for mallee with a shrub understorey appear to be driven by availability of termites, and other reintroduced ecosystem engineers appear to have been facilitators by creating new refuge burrows for numbats. This study shows that numbats can be successfully reintroduced into areas of their former range if protected from introduced predators, and illustrates the difficulties in monitoring such cryptic species.\n\n2015 Hayward MW, Boitani L, Burrows ND, Funston PJ, Karanth KU, Mackenzie DI, et al., 'Ecologists need robust survey designs, sampling and analytical methods', Journal of Applied Ecology, 52 286-290 (2015)\n\nResearch that yields conflicting results rightly causes controversy.

Where methodological weaknesses are apparent, there is ready opportunity for discord within the scientific community, which may undermine the entire study. We use the debate about the role of dingoes Canis dingo in conservation in Australia as a case study for a phenomenon that is relevant to all applied ecologists, where conflicting results have been published in high-quality journals and yet the problems with the methods used in these studies have led to significant controversy. To alleviate such controversies, scientists need to use robust methods to ensure that their results are repeatable and defendable. To date, this has not occurred in Australia's dingo debate due to the use of unvalidated indices that rely on unsupported assumptions. We highlight the problems that poor methods have caused in this debate. We also reiterate our recommendations for practitioners, statisticians and researchers to work together to develop long-term, multi-site experimental research programmes using robust methods to understand the impacts of dingoes on mesopredators. Synthesis and applications. Incorporating robust methods and appropriate experimental designs is needed to ensure that conservation actions are appropriately focused and are supported with robust results. Such actions will go a long way towards resolving the debate about the role of dingoes in conservation in Australia, and other, ecological debates.\n\n2015 Moore EPB, Hayward M, Robert KA, 'High density, maternal condition, and stress are associated with male-biased sex allocation in a marsupial', Journal of Mammalogy, 96 1203-1213 (2015)\n\nMany mammals have been reported to significantly bias their offspring sex ratios, but these deviations from equality have been difficult to understand and are often inconsistent e... [more]\n\nMany mammals have been reported to significantly bias their offspring sex ratios, but these deviations from equality have been difficult to understand and are often inconsistent even within the same species. Evolutionary theory predicts a number of scenarios where females should bias their investment to one sex over the other; when fitness returns are sex specific, selection favors the facultative adjustment of offspring sex ratios to the sex with the highest inclusive fitness return. Interpreting sex allocation in mammals within the framework of classic sex allocation theory is challenging given the complex life histories and social interactions of species, hence it is likely that there are multiple mechanisms and selective forces dependent upon maternal and environmental drivers. Here, we show the previously demonstrated condition-dependent sex allocation in bridled nailtail wallabies (Onychogalea fraenata), where females in better condition were more likely to have sons, was reversed under high population densities and elevated maternal stress. In this solitary species, an elevated glucocorticoid stress response under unnaturally high densities likely influences adaptive sex allocation to the dispersive sex, consistent with the local resource competition theory. Managing factors such as population density, maternal stress, and food resources may be used to adjust offspring sex ratios in this endangered species.\n\n2015 Silvey CJ, Hayward MW, Gibb H, 'Effects of reconstruction of a pre-European vertebrate assemblage on ground-dwelling arachnids in arid Australia', Oecologia, 178 497-509 (2015)\n\nSpecies loss can result in changes in assemblage structure and ecosystem function through ecological cascades.

Australian vertebrate assemblages changed significantly following European colonisation, which resulted in the establishment of invasive vertebrates and the loss of native marsupials, many of which consume invertebrates. Conservation focusses on the removal of invasive carnivores and the reintroduction of regionally extinct species to fenced sites, resulting in what could be considered a reconstruction of pre-European vertebrate assemblages. In semi-arid Australian spinifex mallee ecosystems, we asked: (1) what is the effect of reconstructed pre-European vertebrate assemblages on native arachnid assemblages? and (2) what direct or indirect mechanisms (predation, disturbance and/or competition) could plausibly be responsible for these effects? We compared sites with reconstructed vertebrate assemblages with paired control sites. Arachnids were sampled using pitfall trapping and direct searching. Hypotheses regarding mechanisms were tested using scat analysis (predation) and by comparing burrow depth (disturbance) and scorpion mass (competition) between control and reconstructed sites. The dominant dune scorpion, Urodacus yaschenkoi, was less abundant and a wolf spider (Lycosa gibsoni species group) more abundant in reconstructed sites. Differences in spider assemblage composition were marginally non-significant. Scat analysis confirmed native vertebrate predation on scorpions and we found no evidence that competition or disturbance affected scorpions. We, thus, suggest that changes in spider assemblages may have resulted from ecological cascades via decreases in dune scorpions. The loss of omnivorous mammals and other changes associated with the invasion of carnivores may, therefore, have had broad-reaching consequences for native arachnid assemblages in Australian ecosystems.\n\n2015 Creel S, Becker M, Christianson D, Dröge E, Hammerschlag N, Hayward MW, et al., 'Questionable policy for large carnivore hunting : U.S. Wolf-hunting policies do not align with ecological theory or data', Science, 350 1473-1475 (2015) 2015 Hayward MW, Ortmann S, Kowalczyk R, 'Risk perception by endangered European bison Bison bonasus is context (condition) dependent', Landscape Ecology, 30 2079-2093 (2015)\n\nContext: Patch use can illustrate the contributions that forage quality and foraging risk make in shaping foraging decisions made under the risk of being killed.

Objectives: We aimed to determine whether forage selection by European bison Bison bonasus was state-dependent in being shaped by risk (wolf predation or human poaching/culling avoidance) or nutrient quality at two time periods¿early winter (when resources are abundant) and at the end of winter (when resources are scarce)¿in Bialowieza Primeval Forest (Poland). Methods: We used a giving-up density framework using the proportional consumption of hay provided by humans to measure the perceptions of risk in European bison. Results: European bison resource selection was primarily driven by minimising the distance they travel over open ground in early winter (i.e. avoiding humans), however by the end of winter, when resources are scarce, bison selected haystacks for their nutrient quality (low fibre, high Mg and energy). Conclusions: This study illustrates how resource selection varies according to the condition of animals (i.e. state-dependency affects the marginal value theorem). It also indicates conservation managers using hay quality may actively manage human¿bison conflicts in trouble spots and that bison are currently free from top-down limitation in Bialowieza as they do not perceive wolves as threatening enough to alter their foraging behaviour.\n\n2015 Sales LP, Hayward MW, Zambaldi L, Passamani M, de Melo FR, Loyola R, 'Time-lags in primate occupancy: A study case using dynamic models', Natureza e Conservacao, 13 139-144 (2015)\n\nSpecies response to land-use changes are usually assessed by investigating factors affecting distribution, with a single snapshot in time.

However, several processes can lead to a same pattern. Focusing on observed, short-term patterns limits our ability to make inferences about ecological processes and responses to environmental change over time. In this study, we assessed changes in occupancy of two primate species in southeastern Brazil, following a major habitat loss due to implementation of a hydroelectric dam. Occupancy was assessed before dam construction and 11 years after, while explicitly accounting for imperfect detection. We assessed the effect of forest patch size and isolation on occupancy and rates of extinction and colonization, driven by landscape modification. Then we calculated occupancy under metapopulation equilibrium and expected time-lags resulting from non-equilibrium. We compared two primate species inhabiting forest patches, the black penciled marmoset Callithrix penicilatta and the black-fronted titi monkey Callicebus nigrifrons, with markedly different ecological characteristics. Those differences may explain why occupancy dynamics were driven by distinct elements. A fast response to habitat changes was observed only for marmoset, an opportunistic species. However, non-equilibrium states and the possibility of time-lag effects were observed for titi monkey, a species dependent on forest habitat. Our analyses support the need to establish long term monitoring and assess system vital rates over time. A single snapshot in time may lead to erroneous interpretations of a species response to habitat alteration.\n\n2015 Ripple WJ, Newsome TM, Wolf C, Dirzo R, Everatt KT, Galetti M, et al., 'Collapse of the world's largest herbivores.', Sci Adv, 1 e1400103 (2015) 2015 Hayward MW, Child MF, Kerley GIH, Lindsey PA, Somers MJ, Burns B, 'Ambiguity in guideline definitions introduces assessor bias and influences consistency in IUCN Red List status assessments', Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, 3 (2015)\n\nThe IUCN Red List is the most widely used tool to measure extinction risk and report biodiversity trends.

Accurate and standardized conservation status assessments for the IUCN Red List are limited by a lack of adequate information; and need consistent and unbiased interpretation of that information. Variable interpretation stems from a lack of quantified thresholds in certain areas of the Red List guidelines. Thus, even in situations with sufficient information to make a Red List assessment, inconsistency can occur when experts, especially from different regions, interpret the guidelines differently, thereby undermining the goals and credibility of the process. Assessors make assumptions depending on their level of Red List experience (subconscious bias) and their personal values or agendas (conscious bias). We highlight two major issues where such bias influences assessments: relating to fenced subpopulations that require intensive management; and defining benchmark geographic distributions and thus the inclusion/exclusion of introduced subpopulations. We suggest assessor bias can be reduced by refining the Red List guidelines to include quantified thresholds for when to include fenced/intensively managed subpopulations or subpopulations outside the benchmark distribution; publishing case studies of difficult assessments to enhance cohesion between Specialist Groups; developing an online accreditation course on applying Red List criteria as a prerequisite for assessors; and ensuring that assessments of species subject to trade and utilization are represented by all dissenting views (for example, both utilitarian and preservationist) and reviewed by relevant Specialist Groups. We believe these interventions would ensure consistent, reliable assessments of threatened species between regions and across assessors with divergent views, and will thus improve comparisons between taxa and counteract the use of Red List assessments as a tool to leverage applied agendas.\n\n2014 Hayward MW, Marlow N, 'Will dingoes really conserve wildlife and can our methods tell?', Journal of Applied Ecology, 51 835-838 (2014) 2014 Hayward MW, Lyngdoh S, Habib B, 'Diet and prey preferences of dholes (Cuon alpinus): Dietary competition within Asia's apex predator guild', Journal of Zoology, 294 255-266 (2014)\n\nGroup-hunting predators theoretically benefit from hunting together through increased prey returns; however, studies on lions suggest food is not enough.

The dhole is one such group hunter; however, its predatory role within Asia's large predator guild is less well known than other members. We tested whether dholes exhibit preferential predation, and determined the drivers of prey choice and whether pack size affected diet to ascertain the fundamental resources required for the species' conservation, given lack of a prey base is the primary threat to this species. We reviewed the literature and found 24 studies from 16 sites from throughout the species extant range that reported on 8816 records (scat+kills) of 19 species. Jacobs' index revealed that sambar Rusa unicolor, chital Axis axis and wild boar Sus scrofa contribute almost two-thirds of the food biomass of the dhole, with sambar being significantly preferred. Sambar are at the upper end of the accessible prey spectrum (30-235kg), and are marginally above the preferred weight range of 130-190kg. The accessible prey spectrum extensively overlaps with leopards and tigers in Asia and reflects the extensive dietary competition within Asia's large predator guild, as tigers also preferentially prey on sambar and leopards completely overlap in the accessible prey with dholes. Although prey preferences are not affected by pack size, larger packs ultimately take larger prey. This study documents for the first time the critical prey resources necessary for the conservation of dholes in Asia, and highlights the degree of competition potentially occurring across dhole distribution range.\n\n2014 Lyngdoh S, Shrotriya S, Goyal SP, Clements H, Hayward MW, Habib B, 'Prey preferences of the snow leopard (Panthera uncia): Regional diet specificity holds global significance for conservation', PLoS ONE, 9 (2014)\n\nAbstract The endangered snow leopard is a large felid that is distributed over 1.83 million km2 globally.

Throughout its range it relies on a limited number of prey species in some of the most inhospitable landscapes on the planet where high rates of human persecution exist for both predator and prey. We reviewed 14 published and 11 unpublished studies pertaining to snow leopard diet throughout its range. We calculated prey consumption in terms of frequency of occurrence and biomass consumed based on 1696 analysed scats from throughout the snow leopard's range. Prey biomass consumed was calculated based on the Ackerman's linear correction factor. We identified four distinct physiographic and snow leopard prey type zones, using cluster analysis that had unique prey assemblages and had key prey characteristics which supported snow leopard occurrence there. Levin's index showed the snow leopard had a specialized dietary niche breadth. The main prey of the snow leopard were Siberian ibex (Capra sibrica), blue sheep ( Pseudois nayaur), Himalayan tahr ( Hemitragus jemlahicus), argali (Ovis ammon) and marmots (Marmota spp). The significantly preferred prey species of snow leopard weighed 55±5 kg, while the preferred prey weight range of snow leopard was 36-76 kg with a significant preference for Siberian ibex and blue sheep. Our meta-analysis identified critical dietary resources for snow leopards throughout their distribution and illustrates the importance of understanding regional variation in species ecology; particularly prey species that have global implications for conservation. © 2014 Lyngdoh et al.\n\n2014 Lyngdoh S, Shr"
