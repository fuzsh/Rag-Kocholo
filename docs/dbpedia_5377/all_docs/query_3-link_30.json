        "text": "The population passed 300,000\n\nBetween the last two censuses (held in 2011 and 2021), the population of Newcastle upon Tyne increased by 7.1%, from around 280,200 in 2011 to around 300,100 in 2021.\n\nThis means Newcastle upon Tyne's population saw the largest percentage increase in the North East. The population of the North East increased by 1.9%, while the population of England rose by 6.6%.\n\nIn 2021, Newcastle upon Tyne was home to around 18.9 people per football pitch-sized piece of land, compared with 17.6 in 2011. This area was the second-most densely populated local authority area across the North East (after Middlesbrough ).\n\nThis article generally uses percentages to enable comparisons over time and between areas. The percentage point change is also used to show the difference between the 2011 and 2021 percentages.\n\nPopulation growth was higher in Newcastle upon Tyne than across the North East\n\nPercentage population change, Newcastle upon Tyne and surrounding areas, 2011 Census to Census 2021\n\nEngland ▲6.6% North East ▲1.9% Newcastle upon Tyne ▲7.1% Source: Office for National Statistics – 2011 Census and Census 2021\n\nSave as image (PNG <200KB) | Download the data (CSV <100KB) |\n\nMedian age in Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nBetween the last two censuses, the average (median) age of Newcastle upon Tyne increased by one year, from 33 to 34 years of age.\n\nThis area had the lowest average (median) age in the North East and a lower average (median) age than England (40 years).\n\nThe median age is the age of the person in the middle of the group, meaning that one half of the group is younger than that person and the other half is older.\n\nThe number of people aged 65 to 74 years rose by just under 5,100 (an increase of 26.2%), while the number of residents aged 4 years and under fell by just over 850 (5.3% decrease).\n\nThe share of residents aged between 65 and 74 years increased by 1.2 percentage points between 2011 and 2021\n\nFamily in Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple but no children increased in Newcastle upon Tyne, but fell across the North East.\n\nIn Newcastle upon Tyne, the percentage of households including a couple without children rose from 14.7% in 2011 to 15.6% in 2021. During the same period, the regional percentage fell from 17.7% to 17.0%.\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple with dependent children in Newcastle upon Tyne increased from 16.3% to 16.6%, while the percentage of households including a couple with only non-dependent children remained at 5.3%.\n\nThe percentage of households including a couple without children in Newcastle upon Tyne increased by 0.9 percentage points\n\nHealth in Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nIn 2021, 44.6% of Newcastle upon Tyne residents described their health as \"very good\", increasing from 42.7% in 2011. Those describing their health as \"good\" rose from 32.6% to 33.0%. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nThe proportion of Newcastle upon Tyne residents describing their health as \"very bad\" was 1.8% (similar to 2011), while those describing their health as \"bad\" fell from 6.5% to 5.7%.\n\nThese data reflect people’s own opinions in describing their overall health on a five point scale, from very good to very bad.\n\nCensus 2021 was conducted during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and rated their health, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nThe percentage of people in good health in Newcastle upon Tyne increased by 0.4 percentage points\n\nNational identity in Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne saw the North East's second-largest percentage-point rise in the proportion of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK (from 9.4% in 2011 to 11.5% in 2021).\n\nAcross the region, only Middlesbrough saw a greater rise in the percentage of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK (from 4.8% to 7.9%).\n\nEvery local authority area across the North East saw a rise in the percentage of people who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK, as the regional percentage grew from 2.9% to 4.1%.\n\nIn Census 2021, “British” was moved to the top response option and this may have influenced how people described their national identity. For further information, please see our quality report.\n\nThe percentage of people who did not identify with at least one UK national identity in Newcastle upon Tyne increased by 2.1 percentage points\n\nReligion in Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nIn 2021, 40.8% of Newcastle upon Tyne residents reported having \"No religion\", up from 28.3% in 2011. The rise of 12.5 percentage points was the largest increase of all broad religious groups in Newcastle upon Tyne. Because the census question about religious affiliation is voluntary and has varying response rates, caution is needed when comparing figures between different areas or between censuses.\n\nAcross the North East, the percentage of residents who described themselves as having \"No religion\" increased from 23.4% to 40.0%, while across England the percentage increased from 24.8% to 36.7%.\n\nIn 2021, 41.3% of people in Newcastle upon Tyne described themselves as Christian (down from 56.4%), while 9.0% described themselves as Muslim (up from 6.3% the decade before).\n\nThere are many factors that can cause changes to the religious profile of an area, such as a changing age structure or residents relocating for work or education. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses. Religious affiliation is the religion with which someone connects or identifies, rather than their beliefs or religious practice.\n\nRead the bulletin Religion, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 40.8% of usual residents in Newcastle upon Tyne reported having \"No religion\"\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne residents' country of birth\n\nIn the latest census, around 239,300 Newcastle upon Tyne residents said they were born in England. This represented 79.7% of the local population. The figure has risen from just under 233,000 in 2011, which at the time represented 83.2% of Newcastle upon Tyne's population.\n\nScotland was the next most represented, with just under 5,200 Newcastle upon Tyne residents reporting this country of birth (1.7%). This figure was down from around 5,700 in 2011, which at the time represented 2.0% of the population of Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nThe number of Newcastle upon Tyne residents born in India rose from just over 3,300 in 2011 (1.2% of the local population) to around 4,600 in 2021 (1.5%).\n\nIn 2021, 79.7% of Newcastle upon Tyne residents reported their country of birth as England\n\nMarriage and civil partnership in Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nOf Newcastle upon Tyne residents aged 16 years and over, 35.3% said they were married or in a registered civil partnership in 2021, down from 36.5% in 2011.\n\nIn 2021, around one in two people (50.0%) said they had never been married or in a civil partnership, compared with 46.5% in 2011. The percentage of adults in Newcastle upon Tyne that had divorced or dissolved a civil partnership decreased from 8.0% to 7.4%.\n\nThis area had the region’s lowest percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were married (or in a civil partnership). Middlesbrough had the North East's next lowest percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were married (or in a civil partnership) (39.4%), while Northumberland had the region's highest percentage (49.3%).\n\nThese figures include same-sex marriages and opposite-sex civil partnerships in 2021, neither of which were legally recognised in England and Wales in 2011. Same-sex marriages have been legally recognised in England and Wales since 2014 and opposite-sex civil partnerships have been recognised since 2019.\n\nThe percentage of adults who were married or in a civil partnership in Newcastle upon Tyne decreased by 1.2 percentage points\n\nFall in social renting\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne saw the North East's second-largest percentage-point fall in the proportion of households in the social rented sector (from 29.7% in 2011 to 27.3% in 2021).\n\nAcross the region, only Gateshead saw a greater fall in the percentage of households in the social rented sector (from 28.0% to 25.1%).\n\nDespite the decrease, Newcastle upon Tyne was in the highest 10% of English local authority areas for the share of households in the social rented sector in 2021.\n\nThe rate of social renting in Newcastle upon Tyne decreased by 2.5 percentage points\n\nDisability in Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne saw the North East's joint largest percentage-point rise (alongside Middlesbrough) in the proportion of non-disabled residents (from 77.1% in 2011 to 79.1% in 2021). These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nCounty Durham saw the North East's next largest increase in the proportion of non-disabled residents (from 75.7% in 2011 to 77.6% in 2021).\n\nEvery local authority area across the North East saw a rise in the proportion of non-disabled residents, as the regional proportion grew from 77.2% to 78.8%.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived their health status and activity limitations, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of non-disabled residents in Newcastle upon Tyne increased by 2.0 percentage points\n\nEthnic groups in Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nIn 2021, 11.4% of Newcastle upon Tyne residents identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category, up from 9.7% in 2011. The 1.7 percentage-point change was the largest increase among high-level ethnic groups in this area.\n\nAcross the North East, the percentage of people from the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" ethnic group increased from 2.9% to 3.7%, while across England the percentage increased from 7.8% to 9.6%.\n\nIn 2021, 80.0% of people in Newcastle upon Tyne identified their ethnic group within the \"White\" category (compared with 85.5% in 2011), while 3.3% identified their ethnic group within the \"Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African\" category (compared with 1.8% the previous decade).\n\nThe percentage of people who identified their ethnic group within the \"Other\" category (\"Arab\" or \"Any other ethnic group\") increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 3.1% in 2021.\n\nThere are many factors that may be contributing to the changing ethnic composition of England and Wales, such as differing patterns of ageing, fertility, mortality, and migration. Changes may also be caused by differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify between censuses.\n\nRead the bulletin Ethnic group, England and Wales: Census 2021.\n\nIn 2021, 11.4% of usual residents in Newcastle upon Tyne identified their ethnic group within the \"Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh\" category\n\nChange in work hours\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne saw the North East's third-largest percentage-point rise in the proportion of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked 15 hours or less per week (from 11.2% in 2011 to 11.9% in 2021).\n\nAcross the region, only Northumberland (from 9.1% to 10.1%) and Gateshead (from 7.5% to 8.5%) saw a greater increase in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over and in employment who said they usually worked 15 hours or less per week.\n\nWorking hours may have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThe percentage of adults who worked 15 hours or less in Newcastle upon Tyne increased by 0.7 percentage points\n\nChange in employment\n\nThe decrease in the percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed was greater in nearby Northumberland (3.4 percentage points) than in Newcastle upon Tyne (0.5 percentage points).\n\nIn Newcastle upon Tyne, the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were employed (excluding full-time students) decreased from 47.1% in 2011 to 46.6% in 2021. During the same period, the percentage in nearby Northumberland decreased from 54.8% to 51.4%.\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were unemployed (excluding full-time students) in Newcastle upon Tyne fell from 4.6% to 3.0%, while the percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were retired (economically inactive) decreased from 18.3% to 17.3%.\n\nCensus 2021 took place during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a period of rapid and unparalleled change; the national lockdown, associated guidance and furlough measures will have affected the labour market and our ability to measure it.\n\nThe percentage of people aged 16 years and over who were employed (excluding full-time students) in Newcastle upon Tyne decreased by 0.5 percentage points\n\nUnpaid care in Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nIn 2021, 4.0% of Newcastle upon Tyne residents (aged five years and over) reported providing up to 19 hours of unpaid care each week. This figure decreased from 6.4% in 2011. These are age-standardised proportions.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout this section. They enable comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure.\n\nIn 2021, just over 1 in 50 people (2.1%) reported providing between 20 and 49 hours of unpaid care each week, compared with 1.6% in 2011. The proportion of Newcastle upon Tyne residents (aged five years and over) that provided at least 50 hours of weekly unpaid care increased from 3.1% to 3.2%.\n\nThis area had the region’s second lowest proportion of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care. Across the region, only Middlesbrough, with 3.7%, had a lower proportion.\n\nCensus 2021 was undertaken during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This may have influenced how people perceived and managed their provision of unpaid care, and therefore may have affected how people chose to respond.\n\nCaution should be taken when making comparisons between 2011 and 2021 because of changes in question wording and response options.\n\nThe percentage of people (aged five years and over) providing up to 19 hours of weekly unpaid care in Newcastle upon Tyne decreased by 2.4 percentage points\n\nAbout the data\n\nCensus data are adjusted to reflect estimated non-response so that the published results relate to the entire usually resident population as it was on Census Day (21 March 2021).\n\nThose respondents who were on furlough because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were asked to classify themselves as \"temporarily away from work\" to ensure they remained in the economically active population.\n\nStudents are counted as usually resident at their term-time address even if they were not physically present there on Census Day.\n\nThe questions relating to disability differed slightly between 2011 and 2021 to ensure that data were more closely aligned with the definition of disability in the Equality Act (2010). There was also a change to question wording for unpaid care, for more information read the health, disability and unpaid care quality information.\n\nAge-standardised proportions are used throughout the health, disability and unpaid care sections. They allow for fairer comparisons between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure. The 2013 European Standard Population is used to standardise proportions.\n\nPercentages and percentage point changes have been individually rounded to one decimal place. This means they may not sum exactly.\n\nTell us what you think about this publication by answering a few questions.\n\nDownload the data used in this article\n\nxlsx (1.5 MB)\n\nAbout these articles\n\nThere is an article like this for every local authority district in England and Wales.
