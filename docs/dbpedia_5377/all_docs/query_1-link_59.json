        "text": "Blacktown has the fastest growing population in Sydney and the second fastest growing suburb population across Australia, according to a new report, with many buyers favouring the area for its larger land sizes and affordable homes.\n\nThe report, conducted by KPMG analysed the fastest growing regions across Australia since 2019, focusing on areas which had experienced an influx of new residents.\n\nThe analysis showed that many buyers favoured areas with an abundance of low and medium density housing, with Wyndham, on the outer western side of Melbourne and Blacktown both adding 30,000 people to their population, over that period.\n\nSince December 2019, the report found Australia had added over one million new residents, with a quarter of those settling into the areas on the list.\n\nKPMG demographics expert Terry Rawnsley said the fact that the annual growth rate hit 1.7 per cent was notable despite the strict border closures experienced at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Sydney’s northwest greenfield has seen ongoing growth in greenfield development, but also higher density housing linked to access to the rail network and local jobs and services,” he said.\n\nMORE:\n\nEpic Byron home has private rainforest, super slide\n\nNRL star’s surprise buy amid huge announcement\n\nSeaside barn’s unique take on beach lifestyle\n\n“The growth has really been a combination of impacts from the pandemic but also from people looking for larger spaces and developers looking for land to build major projects.\n\n“Many of the fastest growing areas in regional NSW have been driven by buyers looking for a sea-change and more affordable properties.”\n\nThe neighbouring region in Rouse Hill and McGrath Hill came in second on the list, adding 17,500 new residents.\n\nRecent high density development in Green Square has also boosted the population in Zetland, with the report noting 6,100 new residents since 2019.\n\nMeanwhile regions in the Hunter such as Newcastle, Maitland and Lake Macquarie experienced strong growth with Richmond Valley increasing by 3,800 people.\n\n“Affordability is a major factor in where buyers moved in the past three years, but a number of suburbs that declined were not too far from the city.\n\n“The next study in the future will most likely be impacted by the return of people from overseas countries, international students, and people gradually returning to urban areas as companies ask for them to return to the office.”\n\nMORE: Latrell Mitchell’s new record-breaking home\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers’ secret Aussie home for sale\n\nNRL star Nate Myles and Tessa James sell Gold Coast retreat\n\nFASTEST GROWING REGIONS BY POPULATION IN GREATER SYDNEY SINCE 2019\n\n#1: Blacktown (7.9 per cent)\n\n#2: Bringelly – Green Valley (5.4 per cent)\n\n#3: Rouse Hill – McGraths Hill (12.1 per cent)\n\n#4: Penrith – (1.9 per cent)"
