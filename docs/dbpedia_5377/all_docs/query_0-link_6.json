Density-functional theory was used to verify the stability of the different phases by comparing their total energy to that of the appropriate competing phases.

Very small energy differences suggest that it may be possible to fabricate ${\\text{Ti}}_{2}\\text{SiC}$, ${\\text{Ti}}_{2}\\text{SiN}$, and ${\\text{Ti}}_{3}{\\text{AlN}}_{2}$ as metastable phases.
