        "text": "Are you interested in living and settling in NSW?\n\nNew South Wales offers a multitude of experiences, with plenty of things to see and do which suit all tastes and interests. Read on to find information on almost everything that is associated with moving to NSW…\n\nIntroduction to New South Wales\n\nNew South Wales (NSW), a southeastern Australian state, is a heavily industrialized state with a profound urban community. With a population of around 6.7 million, it is one of Australia’s most densely populated states. It was founded as the first and foremost British colony, which gradually diminished due to the formation of other newer states and territories, as much of Australia was reborn.\n\nNSW houses the oldest and one of the most significant cities in Australia, Sydney. It extends to the Australian capital region ACT and, towards the east, to the subtropical island Lord Howes.\n\nNSW is renowned for its diverse natural treasures, but its main attraction is its endless beaches. In fact, Regardless of your taste in terms of tourist spots and scenic beauty, you are sure to have a wonderful and thrilling experience in New South Wales, Australia.\n\nHistory of New South Wales\n\nNew South Wales (NSW) was a colony of the Aboriginal tribes for hundreds of years until Lieutenant James Cook and his fleet of 11 ships came across Australia. As he navigated past the east coast and finally docked at Botany Bay, he made a second settlement at Norfolk Island. Captain Phillip later renamed Botany Bay as New South Wales. Further settlements towards the interior of Australia were limited due to the Blue Mountain ranges that hindered the settlers from crossing the mountains. Nevertheless, settlements began expanding rapidly from 1813 onwards, leading to Bathurst’s first town.\n\nAround the early 1800s, Sydney became prosperous and was transformed into a busy port destination. Huge construction work sprang up, and the land was cleared for growing vegetables, fruits and possibly windmills. In 1809, the British government posted Governor Macquarie in Sydney to enforce laws so that Sydney could be upgraded into a highly civic society with efficient planning and construction. By the end of the Thirties, construction and development extended to the foothills of the Blue Mountain ranges and further, the Darling Rivers, Macquarie, Murrumbidgee and Lachlan were thoroughly explored.\n\nThe late 19th century witnessed the Gold Rush, which speeded up the expansion and settlements, but farming and agriculture continued to be the main occupation of this region. Towards the early part of the 20th century, New South Wales witnessed the Industrial Revolution, which included coal mining in the Illawarra belt and the Hunter Valley.\n\nIndustrial growth also saw the introduction of the steel and shipbuilding industry. Agriculture continued to be practised by a large population. However, revenues generated from farming dipped while Sydney made progress and saw the beginning of service industries, finance, tourism, information and technology.\n\nGeography of New South Wales\n\nMany charming and attractive landmarks surround New South Wales, making it a true wonderland. Sydney is the largest city in Australia, with a population of 6.7 million. Wollongong and Newcastle are the two other major cities. The most beautiful sites in New South Wales are located outside the metropolitan area of Sydney.\n\nBased on its natural features, NSW is divided into four major geographical zones that cover the northern and southern landmarks. NSW covers a total of 1460 kilometres of coastline that includes low-lying land as well. The Great Dividing Range comprises a plateau that extends from 50 kilometres to 160 kilometres, forming the tablelands that allow the rivers to meet inland. Mount Kosciusko is the highest peak on the Snowy mountain range, about 2228 meters. The most fertile land strips are the Western slopes with their rich plains that receive abundant rainfall to sustain the cultivation of crops. Nearly two-thirds of the state comprises the western plains with rich and fertile soil, but unfortunately, it experiences poor rainfall, high temperature, and very limited water influx from the major rivers, thus restricting agricultural growth and development. The Murray Darling system is part of the inland rivers that transport at least two-thirds of the water to the state. The chief rivers are Macleay, Clarence, Hawkesbury, Hunter, Hawkesbury, Hunter, Namoi, Gwydir, Macquarie-Bogan and Castlereagh.\n\nClimate of New South Wales\n\nThe climatic conditions in New South Wales vary depending on the different geographical regions of the state. The Snowy Mountains receive substantial snowfall that attracts skiing activities in July and September. In mid-winter, the snowfall can touch as low as 800 meters, thus paving the way for beautiful landscapes through the interior of the state while the deserts fail to maintain 15ºC, and the coastal areas drift between 9-17ºC in July. However, Tweed Heads and Byron Bay, located on New South Wales’s north coast, have milder winter weather, ranging from 18-20ºC, which promotes swimming between October and March. In summer, the cities and towns situated in the middle of the state continue to experience high temperatures between 30-40ºC. All activities, such as restaurants, transport and communications, continue to operate throughout the year. Beach activities are best enjoyed during the summer holidays between December and February, while winter activities are best suited for August to September.\n\nOne should avoid visiting Sydney during the summer, as it’s too hot and humid, and the cost of accommodation during these months is usually very high. Autumn and spring are best for indulging in extracurricular activities such as walking, jogging, and sightseeing.\n\nWhat’s happening in NSW now\n\nHere is the main website for NSW, which has information on what’s happening in the state right now.
