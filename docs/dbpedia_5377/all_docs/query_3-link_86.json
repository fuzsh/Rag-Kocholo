        "text": "Sporting the second-largest population in NSW, Newcastle is known for its beaches, mining history and, most recently, for its burgeoning technology start-up scene.\n\nIn February, Leading Edge Data Centres kicked off its initial rollout of 14 data centre sites located in regional areas with the Newcastle area, setting up the first one in Mayfield West.\n\nSpeaking to ARN, Leading Edge DC CEO Chris Thorpe noted that the potential for the city’s technological excellence was always there, but was lacking the back-end equipment for it.\n\n“From a digital infrastructure [perspective], Newcastle has got very high aspirations about being a major digital hub,” he said. “But there was no major data centre infrastructure in place. Everything was hanging off of Sydney.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic brought this fact home further, with Thorpe saying that in a time when connectivity is paramount, these regional locations were lacking adequate infrastructure.\n\n“COVID-19 really accelerated the need for digital infrastructure and has shone the spotlight across regional locations to really show that the infrastructure is not there that should actually be there,” Thorpe said. “It’s actually substandard.”\n\nSo, instead of being connected to 150 to 200 kilometres of fibre, Thorpe said he saw Newcastle as a “perfect” location to build the rollout’s first flagship site.\n\nWhile the infrastructure was lacking, what Newcastle has to offer is its skillset, including architects, civil engineers and planners working on the construction.\n\nSelecting talent\n\nAnd it’s not just data centres that are booming, but many projects are seeing new life in Newcastle, according to technology recruiting firm director James MacDonald.\n\n“A lot of projects and project budgets were put on hold during COVID. There’s a lot of uncertainty around many companies, even with companies that weren’t particularly COVID affected,” MacDonald told ARN.\n\n“Now, there’s been a lot of project spends increasing across the board in Newcastle. We’re seeing that leads to a rise in business analysts and project managers and project-based technology work increasing. So, there’s been a real uptick in that over the past six months in particular in that project space.”\n\nHowever, this isn’t just relegated to tech businesses, with a bleed through to businesses of all kinds, MacDonald claimed.\n\n“More traditional organisations have made investments in technology. They’ve realised that, whether it be COVID, or just the fact that we continue to advance, they’ve had to change their business models and continue to advance and to stay relevant,” he said.\n\n“A lot of that gets tied to technology-based projects. So even more traditional organisations are really investing in technology, building out our technology teams and platforms. Across the board, there’s opportunities for tech professionals in Newcastle.”\n\nThe talent pool in Newcastle is seen in two different perspectives, according to MacDonald. The first is as a hotbed for remote workers, with companies based in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra all vying for Newcastle-based employees.\n\nThe second comes from Sydney employers looking to attract the talent in Newcastle and bring them two hours south into the state’s capital.\n\nOut of all the kinds of different tech professionals, software engineers are in the most demand as of late.\n\n“Whether [companies are] building their own software or they’re customising solutions for their organisations, there is need for software engineers. A lot of people like to have those software engineers sitting in-house,” MacDonald said.\n\n“\n\nFor the past 18 months, there’s been a demand for them and that demand is not going away anytime soon. It’s extremely difficult to try and find good software engineers.”\n\nIn fact, that difficultly is so extreme, MacDonald called the staffing situation “cutthroat”.\n\n“If a software engineer is willing to move, they’re going to have a minimum of three opportunities that they could go to,” he said.\n\nBut, be it potential Newcastle employees looking for work or Sydney employers looking to put others to work, Newcastle sports a smaller market by comparison to major capital cities, so while there’s not a lot of people to pick from, there’s also fewer costs to consider.\n\n“When you look at some of the bigger organisations, your cost of running an organisation, cost of the brand, cost of building a business there is cheaper,” MacDonald said. “Salaries in Newcastle also tend to be traditionally cheaper than a capital city.”\n\nHowever, it’s not just larger companies looking to carve up a slice of Newcastle: local start-ups and businesses are now making a name for themselves on the national and global stages.\n\nOne such company that’s made itself known in recent months is independent software vendor Pegasus, which in May was acquired by Utah, US-headquartered supply chain risk management software vendor Avetta to be its Australian launch-pad.\n\nThe Newcastle ISV, which has 140 staff across Australia and New Zealand, provides worker competency management, induction and learning management, supplier prequalification, site access and asset management to a variety of industries, including construction, energy, healthcare, government, manufacturing and mining.\n\nThe process kicked off a touch over 12 months ago after Pegasus had taken out its first round of funding from private equity firm Accel-KKR in the attempt to try and expand outside of Australia and into the UK, the UK and Europe, according to CEO Adam Boyle.\n\n“The Avetta opportunity came along a little earlier than what we were looking, but it was good timing for them and us. We knew it was going to be after COVID, we knew it was going to be quite difficult go and expand outside of where we were intending,” he said.\n\n“Plus, they were keen to get into Australia, and we were keen to get into the US. So, we both had fairly big networks in those particular areas so that the combination of the two networks and our ability then to grow our business on the back of their network was the main driver for the acquisition.”\n\nHowever, post-acquisition, the Newcastle ISV isn’t going to lose its brand identity for at least the next few years.\n\n“We hope to offer a workable solution to the Avetta suite of software [and] maintain the Pegasus brand,” he added.\n\nDespite the business’ success, however, Boyle isn’t looking to strongarm competitors out of the market. In fact, he’s looking at things from the completely opposite end.\n\n“We’re not trying to compete with other businesses here in Newcastle that want to do the same thing,” he said. “We’d like to try and help them as much as we can because it benefits all of us. We’re happy to see others doing well as well.”\n\nWhy Newcastle?\n\nBut why pick a Newcastle company to launch into Australia, rather than the more populated Sydney or Melbourne? According to Boyle, being based in Newcastle has kept Pegasus close to the industries it has been working in, while somewhere more populous like Sydney and Melbourne would be too far removed from the day-to-day decision making of some of its clients.\n\nBut if someone based in Newcastle needs to get to a major capital city, living in Newcastle certainly provides lots of options.\n\n“It’s a two-hour drive to Sydney now along the new North Connex motorway and it’s an hour and 10-minute flight to Melbourne, Brisbane and other places,” Boyle said.\n\n“You don’t have to be based in Sydney anymore to be connected to the rest of Australia. So, as long as we can attract good people to Newcastle, there’s just as much chance for us to do it out of Newcastle as what there is in Sydney.”\n\nIn fact, Boyle believes that Newcastle has everything Sydney has, but with a cheaper cost of living, comparatively less traffic and good transportation links through light rail, trains and airport.\n\nMeanwhile, Thorpe also views Newcastle as having cheaper land assets, real estate and running costs. However, there’s still room to grow.\n\n“From a communications perspective, you can operate anywhere, but I think that there’s a lot of available land around Newcastle as well,” he said. “You push up into towards the Hunter or up towards Port Stephens — There’s a lot of room for expansion, there’s a lot of industry out there, and it’s the access to that workforce. It’s a really attractive area.”\n\nIn relation to the said workforce, Thorpe also spoke highly of the local talent pool. “The skilled availability of workforce in Newcastle is actually really high, especially within technology; there’s there’s a lot of technology companies that are really starting to build up there in the Newcastle region,” he said.\n\nPart of that talent stems from the University of Newcastle, which MacDonald claimed has been “turning out technology talent”.\n\n“There are all the facilities there to have a growing, thriving technology community,” he said. “The more companies that go there, the more that community continues to grow, and the more talent we’ll continue to attract.”"
