        "text": "Sweeping planning changes set to transform some of Sydney's oldest suburbs are due to take effect next month.\n\nThe NSW government plans to rezone land near dozens of train stations to allow higher housing density as it tries to tackle the state's shortage of homes.\n\nBut the blanket nature of the reforms has provoked criticism from some councils and communities, who fear overdevelopment will ruin the heritage character of their neighbourhoods.\n\nFour rezonings centre on the North Shore Line stations of Roseville, Lindfield, Killara and Gordon.\n\nOpened in 1890, the corridor was Sydney's first suburban railway, and some of the homes nearby have stood for more than a century.\n\nMost houses within walking distance of those four stations are single dwellings sitting on large blocks.\n\nUnder the Transport Oriented Development (TOD) program, land within a 400-metre radius of 31 stations from Newcastle to Wollongong will be rezoned in late April to permit six-storey apartment buildings.\n\nMore than 80 per cent of properties contained within the circle around Killara station are subject to Ku-ring-gai Council's heritage protections.\n\n'Wrecking ball coming to you'\n\nA campaign by residents opposed to the reforms is gathering momentum, with signs around the neighbourhood warning of a \"wrecking ball coming to you\".\n\nKillara resident Stuart Clark insists he's not a NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) and said most locals supported the government's policy objective of increased density.\n\n\"We all have children, we all want to see our children live in Sydney as well,\" Mr Clark said.\n\n\"Nobody in their right minds would now advocate for the destruction of Paddington. Nobody would advocate for the destruction of Surry Hills.\n\n\"Our objection is to some bureaucrat sitting in an office somewhere in Sydney with a compass and just drawing concentric circles around the railway station and saying, 'it can all go'.\"\n\nThe most senior bureaucrat overseeing the changes is NSW Department of Planning Secretary Kiersten Fishburn.\n\nHer job is to help the state government achieve its target of delivering more than 300,000 new homes by 2029.\n\n\"We are five years under the national housing accord, so there is a sense of urgency here,\" Ms Fishburn said.\n\nKu-ring-gai Council has lodged a submission to the planning department against the reforms.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense to us when there are other stations closer to the city,\" Ku-ring-gai mayor Sam Ngai said.\n\n\"If they implement the policy in April just as proposed, then yes it will destroy the character of Ku-ring-gai.\"\n\nSince the new regulations were announced in December, empty-nester Rex Chadwick has received several letters from developers wanting to buy his home in Roseville.\n\n\"The danger is if one goes, then you have the domino effect. Everybody goes,\" Mr Chadwick said.\n\n\"Don't throw me out because you want to put a seven-block unit here, or three block unit.\"\n\nIn a rare interview, Ms Fishburn confirmed buildings higher than six storeys may be approved because proposed incentives for developers to build social and affordable housing would apply to the rezonings.\n\nApartment blocks with 15 per cent of units set aside for affordable housing will be eligible for a 30 per cent height bonus.\n\n\"If you're going from six storeys, you'd actually be going to about seven and a half,\" Ms Fishburn said.\n\n'Yes in my backyard'\n\nNot all north shore dwellers oppose the Minns government's plan.\n\nSt Ives resident Michael Clayden is of a generation increasingly shut out of the housing market because of low supply and high prices.\n\n\"I do not see how I can afford to live in Ku-ring-gai near my family in an area where I've lived for most of my life now,\" Mr Clayden said.\n\nThe university student is a member of the housing advocacy group Sydney YIMBY (Yes In My Backyard) and is onboard with development.\n\n\"Councils have been dragging their feet, especially Ku-ring-gai,\" he said.\n\nDavid Lane is worried about the loss of tree canopy in Gordon, where he has owned a heritage-protected California bungalow for decades.\n\n\"I don't want to say it'll become a slum, but it'll certainly change the Australian dream,\" Mr Lane said.\n\n\"Sydney needs more housing, yes, but Sydney needs a variety of housing stock. Not everyone wants to live in apartments.\"\n\nBelinda Harrison, a self-confessed baby boomer, said she supported higher density but not massive high-rises.\n\n\"I do believe that it's a bit selfish to live in a big home with a giant big backyard when you could have multiple dwellings,\" she said.\n\nPlan 'overrides' local heritage rules\n\nThe TOD program is part of the state government's effort to meet nationally agreed housing targets.\n\nAnother plank of its planning reforms is designed to encourage the construction of low and mid-rise housing.\n\nLand located less than an 800-metre walk from \"town centres\", as well as heavy, metro and light rail stations, is set to be rezoned for increased density.\n\nExpected to take effect in the middle of the year, the changes would cover much of the inner west, including historic Haberfield.\n\nThe entire suburb, which contains houses dating back to 1901, has been declared a heritage conservation area by the inner west council.\n\nInner West Mayor Darcy Byrne said about 43 per cent of the local government area was a conservation zone.\n\n\"That's simply because we're the oldest suburbs in Australia,\" Mr Byrne said.\n\nCouncils have sought clarity from the government on what the new planning regulations would mean for heritage controls.\n\nBoth the inner west and Ku-ring-gai mayors have been advised by council planning experts that the government proposals would \"supersede\" and \"override\" local heritage protections.\n\nPremier Chris Minns said mechanisms would remain in place to prevent buildings of historical significance from being demolished.\n\n\"To suggest otherwise is completely unfair, completely untrue,\" Mr Minns said.\n\nThe premier said councils would still get to decide what was worth keeping.\n\nAccording to Ms Fishburn, the new regulations forbid councils from refusing a development application \"on the grounds of height alone\".\n\n\"But [councils] should, and I'm sure will, consider aspects about whether it fits in with character, amenity,\" Ms Fishburn said.\n\n\"Just because a building is six storeys tall, doesn't mean that it's not appropriate for a heritage conservation area.\"\n\nShe added that the TOD, and low and mid-rise planning regulations, would \"turn off\" if councils changed their local environment plans to increase capacity for new homes.\n\n\"If they're able to demonstrate how they will get the same number of houses or dwellings that the state anticipates, then their own local environment plan will come into place.\n\n\"Heritage and housing are not mutually exclusive.\""
