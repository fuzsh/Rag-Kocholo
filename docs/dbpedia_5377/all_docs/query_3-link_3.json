        "text": "The NSW population has continued to increase at an annual average growth rate of 1.4% between 2015 and 2020.\n\nWhy population growth is a driver of environmental change\n\nPopulation growth can be a significant driver of environmental impacts. In NSW, a rising population accompanied by growing urbanisation has led to greater demand for housing, land, energy, water, consumer products and transport services, and can increase energy, water and resource use, and the generation of waste and emissions.\n\nStatus and Trends\n\nBy June 2020, 8.17 million people were living in NSW, 61% of whom resided in Greater Sydney. Over the five-year period from June 2015 to June 2020, the state’s population grew by more than 550,000 people. However, the rate of growth has started to slow.\n\nSpotlight figure 1 shows population growth rising at a steady rate between 2010 and 2016, with a peak in 2016–17 (coinciding with a peak in the number of overseas students studying in NSW) and growth at a slower rate between 2017 and 2020.\n\nPopulation density in NSW has also risen. In June 2020, there were an average of 10.2 people per square kilometre – a 7.4% rise since 2015. Across Greater Sydney, the average density reached almost 480 people per square kilometre – 41 more than in 2015.\n\nBy 2041, the NSW population is expected to grow to 10.57 million with most of the increase in Greater Sydney. The challenge will be to manage projected population growth alongside environment protection and conservation, and maintain liveability.\n\nPressures\n\nOver the past 40 years, natural population increases have been fairly stable while overseas migration has been a significant contributor to growth. However, during the closure of international borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, overseas migration was temporarily not a major driver of population growth. The 2021 NSW Budget forecast negative population growth for the state of –0.1% in 2021–22, before a gradual rise to 1.2% in 2024–25.\n\nResponse\n\nThe NSW Government has developed long-term plans for Greater Sydney and regional NSW. The plans aim to provide for sustainable and resilient development with a balanced approach to the use of land and water resources, while enhancing liveability and protecting the natural environment.\n\nOther strategies for reducing environmental impacts of urbanisation and a growing population include the Waste and Sustainable Materials Strategy, the Sydney Green Grid framework for enhancing quality of open space, Future Transport 2056, NSW Government’s Net Zero Plan and the NSW Water Strategy.\n\nRelated topics: Energy Consumption | Transport | Urban Water Supply | Waste and Recycling\n\nGreater Sydney\n\nOver the five years to June 2020, Greater Sydney’s population increased by almost 425,000 people or over 9%. Within Greater Sydney, the largest population increases were in the local government areas (LGAs) of Blacktown (43,400), Sydney (34,700) and Camden (33,700) (ABS 2020a).\n\nRegional NSW\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, the population of regional NSW, which includes coastal NSW and inland NSW, increased by 4.2%. Growth was substantial in areas closer to Sydney (the Central Coast, Wollongong and Maitland) and the state’s larger regional centres (Port Macquarie, Tweed and Queanbeyan-Palerang). The largest population declines occurred in those parts already sparsely populated, such as Broken Hill and Moree Plains.\n\nGrowth projections\n\nBy 2041, the NSW population is expected to grow to 10.57 million people, with Greater Sydney’s population forecast to reach around 7.1 million by 2041. Map 1.2 shows projected population change across the state between 2016 and 2041. Further detail on projections is available at the NSW Population website (DPIE 2019).\n\nIn June 2020, there were 10.2 people per square kilometre in NSW, a 7.4% increase from the density of 9.5 people per square kilometre in 2015. Differences in population density around the state have implications for the provision of services and strategic planning.\n\nHigher densities can increase the efficiency of delivery, and reduce the per-person use of energy, water and waste removal services and also reduce the demand for land on the urban fringe. The impacts of transport and its associated energy use can also be reduced by facilitating easier access to active transport (such as walking and cycling) and public transport (Rickwood, Glazebrook & Searle 2007). Well-designed urban areas with adequate green space also improve liveability and provide habitat for urban wildlife (Dexter et al. 2016, Hess et al. 2014). See also Energy Consumption, Transport, and Urban Water Supply topics.\n\nPopulation densities range from less than one person per square kilometre in the Far West region of NSW to more than 15,000 people per square kilometre in the inner-city suburbs of Potts Point, Pyrmont and Darlinghurst.\n\nWith sustained population growth and management of urban fringe low density development, average population density in Greater Sydney grew by 9% between 2015 and 2020 from 439 to 480 people per square kilometre. However, there is a large variation in population density within Sydney, which has as little as 50 people per square kilometre in some areas.\n\nPopulations grow because of:\n\nnatural increase – the difference between births and deaths\n\nmigration – the movement of people to and from other parts of Australia and overseas.\n\nOver the past 40 years, overseas migration has been the most significant contributor to population growth in NSW, with natural increase remaining relatively stable (ABS 2017).\n\nGeneral trends related to population growth and distribution across the state include:\n\nmovement from both rural areas and Sydney to regional centres\n\nyoung people moving from rural areas to the cities\n\nretirees (‘tree changers’ and ‘sea changers’) moving to popular areas on the coast, along the Murray River and locations within easy driving distance of metropolitan areas\n\nan ageing population – 16.7% of the NSW population is 65 years or older (ABS 2017).\n\nAlongside increased housing costs and structural changes to employment, these trends influence living arrangements.\n\nEvents in NSW, other parts of Australia and globally, such as a lengthy drought, bushfires, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession, have had a profound impact on population change in Australia.\n\nThe closure of Australia’s international borders in March 2020 due to COVID-19 has had a major impact on a key driver of population change, overseas migration. This led to a 99% fall in the number of people both leaving and arriving in Australia (DPIE 2020b).\n\nIn 2019–20, the NSW economy contracted for the first time in recorded history, due to the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic (ABS 2020b). The economy is a key driver of population change in NSW. In its 2021–22 budget, the Australian Government predicted two consecutive years of population decline for NSW with – 0.2% growth before a return to 1.2% in 2024–25 (Australian Government 2021). This was echoed in the NSW Treasury Budget in June 2021 which forecast zero population growth for the state in 2020–21, followed by negative growth of – 0.1% the following year, gradually recovering to 1.2% in 2024–25 (NSW Treasury 2021).\n\nThe State of the Environment reporting framework is based on the pressure-state-response model of reporting. Within this framework, the topics of Population and Economic Activity and the Environment are treated as drivers of environmental change. However, the actual effects of population increase and economic activity on environmental resources and ecosystems depend on how increased demand for transport, land, food, housing, energy, and potable water and greater generation of waste are managed.\n\nFigure 1.3 shows changes in population and a number of environmental indicators relative to their levels in 2005, with all values for each indicator adjusted to a baseline of 100% for that year. Between 2005 and 2019, waste generated surpassed the population growth trend, while the other environmental indicators grew at a lesser rate, except for greenhouse gases which decreased.\n\nNotes:\n\nABS 2020a (population). Population figures change over time with the ABS’s Estimated Resident Population (ERP) data changing from preliminary to revised to final as new component data becomes available. Preliminary ERP is updated every quarter due to revisions to the component data for earlier quarters. ERP gets marked as revised once it can be expected not to change again until the final update, 22 months after the next Census.\n\nDISER 2020 (energy). Energy data includes the ACT. Energy consumption totals have changed from previously published figures due to a change in methodology on how industrial sector energy consumption is calculated. ‘Coal by-products’ data is not included in the ‘fuel consumed’ total, but in the total energy consumption figure.\n\nDPIE 2021a LWU Performance Reporting Data Dashboard, BOM 2020, BOM 2019 (urban water) includes Sydney Water Corporation (SWC), Hunter Water (HW), and all local water utilities (LWUs) in Regional NSW. Previous reporting excluded data for LWUs serving less than 10,000 properties, this data is now included in the full set of figures back to 2005-06.\n\nEPA data 2021 (waste). Waste total generation data (including domestic, plus commercial and industrial waste including building and construction) updated for whole of NSW as previous data only related to the Metropolitan Levy Area (MLA). Prior to 2015–16, data was only available on a two-yearly basis [values being confirmed]\n\nDISER 2020 (greenhouse gas) from the State and Territory Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2019. Greenhouse gas data covers all of NSW.\n\nABS 2006, ABS 2008, ABS 2010, ABS 2012, ABS 2014, ABS 2018, ABS 2020c (vehicle kilometres travelled). ABS survey of motor vehicle use conducted approximately every two years. NSW total calculated from the NSW percentage of the Australian total vehicle kilometres travelled.\n\nWhile the NSW Government uses population projections to inform its strategic planning, infrastructure investment and service delivery, it does not develop specific population targets and growth plans or set limits to population growth.\n\nRecognising the need to plan for future population change, the NSW Government has developed a number of strategic plans which set out a vision for NSW into the future.\n\nGreater Sydney Region Plan\n\nThe Greater Sydney Region Plan: A metropolis of three cities (GSC 2018) is the NSW Government’s 40-year vision for the region.\n\nThe plan aims to rebalance growth and deliver benefits more equitably to residents across Greater Sydney. Prepared concurrently with Future Transport 2056 (TfNSW 2018) and the State Infrastructure Strategy 2018–2038 (INSW 2018), it aligns land use, transport and infrastructure planning to reshape Greater Sydney as three unique and connected cities: the Western Parkland City, the Central River City and the Eastern Harbour City.\n\nThe plan aims to boost productivity by\n\nbringing together good jobs and skilled workers\n\nmaking Greater Sydney’s suburbs more liveable as they grow through a place-based design approach\n\nmaking the three cities more sustainable by protecting the natural environment and open spaces.\n\nFuture Transport 2056 sets out the vision for a transport system which is economically, environmentally and socially sustainable, operationally resilient and affordable for customers and supports emission reductions. The environmental impacts of transport will be lessened by reducing the distance people need to travel to workplaces and essential facilities. See also the Responses sections in the Transport topic.\n\nRegional plans\n\nThe NSW Government has 10 regional plans across the state that play a critical role in how natural resources are managed to ensure the prosperity and productivity of the NSW economy, as well as the health of local communities and the environment.\n\nRegional plans are long-term strategic planning documents that articulate a vision and plan for housing, jobs and community infrastructure to meet the needs of a changing population. Each plan includes specific goals and actions tailored to the region to protect the environment and encourage sustainable use of resources.\n\nWaste\n\nThe NSW Waste and Sustainable Materials Strategy 2041 (DPIE 2021b) focuses on achieving environmental benefits and economic opportunities in how the state uses resources and manages its waste. The strategy commits NSW to play its part in making a transition to a circular economy over the next 20 years. It provides a long-term strategic focus for communities, industry and all levels of government to work together to build resilient services and markets for waste resources.\n\nFor more details, see the Responses section in the Waste and Recycling topic.\n\nWater\n\nThe NSW Water Strategy (DPIE 2021c) is a 20-year plan to improve the resilience of NSW waters. For more information, see the Responses section in the Urban Water Supply topic."
