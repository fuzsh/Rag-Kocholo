        "text": "Usual residence (UR) population, as at 2016 Census\n\nQ: Dear .id, is it possible to get a list of all the Australian cities/towns and their population?\n\nA: As always, it depends on how you define a 'City' or 'Town'.\n\nFor a list of the top 300, youâ€™d probably need to use the Urban Centre/Locality (UCL) classification, which is only defined at Census time (Our largest cities and towns blog uses the Significant Urban Areas geography which are aggregates of SA2s, for which estimates are done every year).\n\nI have just extracted the full list from Tablebuilder for 2016.\n\nNote that some of these UCLs are in the SUA classification subsumed into the larger urban areas - and they have little relationship to suburbs.\n\nAll cities and towns in Australia by population\n\nCities/towns are defined by Urban Centre/Locality (UCL)\n\nPopulation = Usual residence"
