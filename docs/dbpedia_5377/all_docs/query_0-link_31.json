        "meta_description": "The methods of renormalized perturbation theory are used to find the critical exponents of the percolation and Yang-Lee edge singularity problems. Both of the above critical phenomena are described by ${\\ensuremath{\\varphi}}^{3}$ field theories, and the Wilson functions are calculated explicitly in three dimensions to order three loops and summed using the Pad\\'e-Borel method. The resulting critical exponent values are consistent with direct series expansion results.",
