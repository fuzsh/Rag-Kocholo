        "text": "\"Ships are required to sound their horn for safety reasons under international maritime and federal government regulations.\"\n\nThe relevant Australian Government regulation is the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) Marine Orders (Part 30, Prevention of collisions).\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\nRule 34(e):\n\nA vessel nearing a bend or an area of a channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall sound one prolonged blast. Such signal shall be answered with a prolonged blast by any approaching vessel that may be within hearing around the bend or behind the intervening obstruction.\n\nRule 32(c):\n\nThe term prolonged blast means a blast of from four to six seconds' duration.”\n\n“A person must not operate an unmanned aircraft in a way that creates a hazard to another aircraft, another person, or property.\" Civil Aviation Safety Regulation 1998 – Reg 101.055\n\nPort Authority of New South Wales is responsible for providing pilotage services to commercial vessels utilising Newcastle Harbour. Marine Pilots are transferred to and from vessels off the coast of Newcastle by way of a helicopter transfer service. This helicopter transfer service operates from a helibase located on Dyke Point in Newcastle Harbour.\n\nThe use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) has seen incidents where the safety of the helicopter and its occupants has been compromised by drones operating in the area of operation used by the helicopter transfer service.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has recently released guidelines for the use of drones.\n\nYou should only fly in visual line-of-sight, in day visual meteorological conditions (VMC). What does that mean?\n\nNo night flying (generally).\n\nNo flying in or through cloud or fog, and you should be able to see the aircraft with your own eyes (rather than through first-person-view [FPV, binoculars, telescopes]) at all times, (unless you operate under the procedures of an approved model flying association. Contact the MAAA for more information about flying FPV).\n\nYou must not fly closer than 30m to vehicles, boats, buildings or people.\n\nYou must not fly over populous areas such as beaches, heavily populated parks, or sports ovals while they are in use.\n\nIn controlled airspace, which covers most Australian cities, you must not fly higher than 120m (400 feet) above the ground.\n\nYou must not fly in a way that creates a hazard to other aircraft, so you should keep at least 5.5 km away from airfields, aerodromes and helicopter landing sites.\n\nFurther Links:\n\n12 ways your drone can land you in trouble\n\nFlying your drone for fun brochure\n\nFlying drones or model aircraft recreationally\n\nCommercial unmanned flight - remotely piloted aircraft under 2kg\n\nCommercial unmanned flight - gaining your remote pilot licence (RePL) and RPA operator's certificate (ReOC)\n\nFor all oil spills or chemical spills in Newcastle Harbour water, or on the break walls or beaches, contact Port Authority of New South Wales emergency number:\n\nphone: +61 2 4929 3890\n\nFor debris in the harbour water contact Port of Newcastle:\n\nphone: +61 2 4908 8200\n\nand/or Roads and Maritime Services\n\nphone: 13 12 56\n\nFor debris or rubbish on harbour beaches above the high tide mark contact Newcastle City Council:\n\nphone: +61 2 4974 2000\n\nFor debris or rubbish on harbour beaches from the edge of the water to the high tide mark contact Roads and Maritime Services:\n\nphone: 13 12 56\n\nFor debris or rubbish along the foreshore contact Newcastle City Council:\n\nphone: +61 2 4974 2000\n\nOR Hunter Development Corporation\n\nphone: +61 2 4904 2750\n\nFor debris or rubbish on the Southern and Northern break walls contact Port of Newcastle:\n\nphone: +61 2 4908 8200\n\nFor debris or rubbish along the bitumen pathway between Horseshoe Beach to the base of Nobbys Headland contact Port Authority of New South Wales:\n\nphone: +61 2 4985 8222"
