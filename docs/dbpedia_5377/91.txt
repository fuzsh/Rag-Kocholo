A Historical Look at Newcastle’s Housing Market

Newcastle’s property market experienced a significant boom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to the city’s strong economy and growing population. In recent decades and coming into the 21st century, Newcastle’s property market has continued to grow, as has its economy. Newcastle’s economy is strengthened by the major industries at work in the city, including manufacturing, mining, and tourism. Newcastle also benefits from its proximity to Sydney — one of Australia’s most prosperous and populated cities.

The Newcastle region population is the driving factor behind Newcastle property trends. The population nearly doubled in the last 50 years. Growth has slowed in recent years to a current growth rate of 0.88% but has remained consistently positive since 1950 — the growth rate ranges from 0.25% to 5.11%. According to U.N. Projections, the region’s population will reach 500,000 by 2031. Driving factors behind population growth include the strength of the economy, the availability of jobs, and the wide range of affordable housing and rental properties.

Average House Prices & State of the Market in Newcastle

Newcastle’s average house and unit prices have historically increased in accordance with the economy and the rising demand for properties. However, the past year has seen a marginal slowdown of this trend — and even a small turnaround.

The average house and unit prices were $1,215,000 and $835,500, respectively, in Quarter 3 of 2022. According to recent data from Quarter 1, 2023, those average prices are now $1,250,000 and $773,750. So, in the last six months, the average house price has increased by 2.88%, and the average unit price has decreased by 7.39% — an intriguing result.

To investigate this simultaneous increase and decrease, it’s worth going further back to see what things were like in Q1, 2022. Back then, Newcastle house prices averaged at $1.5 million and unit prices at $819,750. From Q1 in 2021, this represents a year-on-year growth of 7.1% for houses and 32.2% for units.

Jumping back to Q1 2023, the year-on-year change from 2022 to 2023 is a property price decline of 18.6% for houses and 7.3% for units — an opposing change from what occurred between 2021 and 2022. The number of property sales also declined dramatically between Q1 2022 and Q1 2023 — a 40% decrease for houses and a 26.9% decrease for units.

Even though property prices are down, rental prices are still rising — especially for apartments, which are much more popular for buying and renting in the Newcastle region and CBD. Also, vacancy rates in the Newcastle region are low — around 1%.

The combination of these trends poses an interesting state for the Newcastle property market in 2023. The conclusion? Now is a perfect time to invest in property and profit from rental yields.

Key Factors Influencing Newcastle’s Property Market in 2023

Global and local economy

Newcastle’s property market is heavily affected by economic trends and, subsequently, the cost of operations. A strong economy (global and local) can increase the demand for housing — which can drive prices up. As a central employment hub, Newcastle’s economy and population have been consistently strong, so property prices have seen an overall increase from year to year and decade to decade, albeit with a slight decline this past year, likely linked to a reduction of job opportunities as more people move interstate for work.

Increased demand for properties

As Newcastle’s population continues to grow, more people than ever are looking for affordable rental properties. As such, there is also an increased demand for investment properties from those who want to take advantage of high rental yields and potential capital growth.

Pandemic recovery phase

The real estate sector in Newcastle is also in the middle of a pandemic recovery phase, which has resulted in hard-to-predict fluctuations in property prices and rental costs across the region (and Australia-wide). The pandemic will likely continue to have an impact on Newcastle’s property market in 2023.
