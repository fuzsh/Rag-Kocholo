Hailing from Birmingham, Alabama, Trey Lewis has spent twelve years on the road perfecting a gritty mix of contemporary country and southern rock!

He is set to release his latest album Troublemaker this Friday.

Trey sat down with RFD-TV’s own Suzanne Alexander to talk about his musical journey, sobriety, songwriting, and his latest project.

He even treated us to a performance of the title track— “Troublemaker”.
