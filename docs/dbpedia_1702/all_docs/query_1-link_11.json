        "text": "Resetting all preferences is the one thing I didn't do -- instead I originally just deleted the \"Adobe Photoshop X64 CS6 Prefs.psp\" file.\n\nI've just deleted all preferences as suggested... I'm keeping my fingers crossed!\n\nJust curious, does the \"MSVCR100.dll\" faulting module tell you the issue is with preferences, or is resetting preferences just something to try hoping that it will resolve the MSVCR100.dll issue?\n\nThanks, Curt Y. I'll let you know if the reset was succesful in resolving the issue.\n\nAfter resetting Photoshop preferences (using the Ctrl-Alt-Shift method while starting the program) Photoshop didn't crash for one full day. But now it's crashing again.\n\nIt started crashing after I upgraded my monitor calibration software (Datacolor Spyder4). I don't know if the this is just a coincidence or if the Datacolor Spyder software is somehow causing the crash issue.\n\nHere's the Windows Event Viewer information for one of the crashes:\n\nFaulting application name: Photoshop.exe, version: 13.0.1.0, time stamp: 0x5022da9d\n\nFaulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 6.1.7601.17725, time stamp: 0x4ec4aa8e\n\nException code: 0xc0000005\n\nFault offset: 0x0000000000053fcc\n\nFaulting process id: 0x1c8c\n\nFaulting application start time: 0x01ce58d5ad62c4f4\n\nFaulting application path: C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe Photoshop CS6 (64 Bit)\\Photoshop.exe\n\nFaulting module path: C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll\n\nReport Id: 386b7a5a-c4e9-11e2-9af8-f04da23a753f\n\nAny ideas how I can stop these Photoshop crashes?\n\nTwo weeks or so ago PS CS6 also started crashing on my Win7 system. Have no idea what's going on. I will usualliy notice the problem when I'm in Bridge, then realize it's PS that's quit working. Will have to go to Task Manager to force shut down the program as it will not respond.\n\nAs I'm using Creative Cloud I can imagine the future problems as Adobe updates the program and \"new features\", using us as their guinee pigs to work out issues free of charge to them. But hardly free of cost to us.\n\nI've not restarted my system three times in one hour trying to get PS to work. This is a serious issue indeed.\n\nWell, the rest of the system and programs seem to run fine after PS crashes. The only change to my system that I noticed recently was that Bridge was pinned to my taskbar, which I did not do. Thus Bridge was running on startup, which was a change to Bridge's preferences that I did not make. This morning Bridge stopped working twice and I had to force close it. It was then this afternoon that PS started freezing almost continually. I think there's a connection between the Bridge issue and PS's behavior.\n\nA month ago I also ran into some PS problems, uninstalled and reinstalled it (a long process). I still think there are issues with Bridge and PS. Of course it could be a thousand other things, as well. That's the problem with high end computing today, but I guess I should say it's been that way for a long time.\n\nhi all - just a general comment here, only because my hardware setup is almost identical to Brian's.\n\ni have used PShop since the first versions, and, in my experience, the predominance of problems revolve around graphics cards and/or their drivers.\n\nnote: more specifically, this comment relates to INTEL-based motherboards and their On-Board graphics chip.\n\nhere's the rub: contemporary INTEL (i3, i5, i7, etc.-based) machines come with quite substantial 'on-board' (built-in to the motherboard) graphics chips; typically called HD Graphics 3000, 4000, 4400, 5000, etc.\n\nIf you had no graphics card (usually a 'handful of a card' sitting in a slot on the motherboard - NOT a chip built-in to the motherboard) in your machine when you bought/or built it, then you were using the INTEL on-board graphics chip to supply your monitor with signal.\n\nIf you've ADDED a graphics card to your machine since, you, most probably, should have 'disabled' this INTEL chip in your control panel.\n\nIf your INTEL machine crashes, AND you have a 'graphics card, sitting in a slot (typically a PCI Express slot), AND you have Intel HD Graphics xxxx 'enabled' in your \"Control Panel>>>Device Manager>>>Display Adapters\"\n\nthis may be your problem.\n\nps. - in my machine, the output of the INTEL HD Graphics chip is to an HDMI connector - i run a 55\" Plasma TV off of this, so, when i want to run the Plasma, i go in to the Control panel and ENABLE \"Intel HD Graphics xxxx\" - otherwise i leave it 'disabled' so i can run all the ADOBE and AUTODESK products without errors.\n\nThanks for the input xkater.\n\nI took a look at: Control Panel > Device Manager > Display Adapters, and the only thing listed there is my graphics card (AMD Radeon R9 270). There's no listing for Intel HD Graphics xxx.\n\nSince originally posting this problem I've purchased a new computer. Much to my disbelief I have the same problem on the new computer.\n\nThis is my new computer info:\n\nAdobe CS6\n\nWindows 8.1 64-bit\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz 3.60 GHz\n\nRAM: 32 GB\n\nGraphics Card: AMD Radeon R9 270\n\nTo reiterate the problem, there are 2 situations where Photoshop most often crashes:\n\n1) Using the Tools Panel \"set foreground/background color\". With the Color Picker open, if set the color by sampling a color from artwork on the canvas, then click the \"OK\" button in the Color Picker, Photoshop often crashes.\n\n2) Using the keyboard shortcut \"D\" to set the Tools Panel foreground and background colors to default. This often crashes Photoshop.\n\nThis problem really slows down my workflow. If anyone has any suggestions to resolve the problem it would be much appreciated.\n\nThis screenshot illustrates issue #1 above.\n\nSorry to join in here so late. I'm having the same error code come up and then \" Photoshop needs to close\" error. It happens when I'm using the brush tool and my colours are set black and white. Sometimes, if I press the x key to change colours, it changes one (so they end up either both black or both white) and then throws up the message. Any clues appreciated please. Also I've noted of late that for some reason even when only one layer is open, the file size at the bottom of the page is showing something like 25.4MB/134MB as though there's more content there but when I flatten the image it goes back to 25.4MB/25.4MB.\n\nI haven't have any problems with Photoshop this year. It never crashes for me, as it often did for me in 2014. I work exclusively on a Mac now, and the problems happened more frequently on my Windows 7 system. I'm especially pleased that Photoshop PDF creation works smoothly. There had been some hitches with this last year (2014). So, Adobe seems to have its act together. Now... about that monthly licensing fee. I only use four programs and I do not like having to pay for access to all the Adobe programs, which I don't need."
