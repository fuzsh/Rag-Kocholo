        "text": "Pros: Phenomenal build quality, branding, bass, and upper mids/highs\n\nCons: If your fingers are fat, you might have trouble fitting it, and male vocals in particular lack crisp forward edges\n\n​\n\nNote: this review is verbatim from the ohm image article I published Friday on the Campfire Audio Comet. If you'd like to see more photos, please visit the original. Otherwise, here it is. Also note: ohmage is good, porridge is bad.\n\nOriginal: ohmage to the Campfire Audio Comet\n\nDisclaimer: I received Comet directly from Campfire Audio in Tokyo. I paid nothing for it nor have I been prompted to return it. It goes for 199$. Hit up Campfire Audio for more about it.\n\nNo earphone as Comet small shines as Comet much. No earphone as Comet small is as Comet tough. Comet nails build, nails branding, nails budget, and nearly nails fit. It’s a 199$ USD earphone, that, after doing the maths (Atari Jaguar style), feels and works like something much, much more expensive.\n\nSpec:\n\n20Hz–20kHz Frequency Response\n\n97 dB SPL/mW Sensitivity\n\n48 Ohms @ 1kHz Impedance\n\nSingle Full Range Balanced Armature Driver (Custom vented)\n\nBeryllium / Copper MMCX Connections\n\nStainless Steel Body\n\nhaptics and build: ohmage\n\nAmong Comet’s many design coups are its use of L/R-independent channels. Snap whichever side you like atop the appropriate mini MMCX plug and you’re gold. The cables bear colour-coded L/R labels in case you really want panning stereo to work properly, and if you’ve just spent 199$ on an earphone, I reckon you do. (In case you’re in the dark, or can’t be bothered to look, the inline mic and remote unit hangs off the right cable.)\n\nComet is universally swappable, blind-operable, and nearly slides right in. I say nearly because if your fingers are meaty, you will find little purchase anywhere for levering them into your canals.\n\nComet also looks like a hairdryer. (I’m sure that was on purpose.)\n\nBelow the remote, the cable is thick Litz stuff. Pulled hard it stretches, but only barely, and is strong enough to support a good dining chair, though perhaps not overnight. Finally, it terminates in a 4-pole, case-friendly slimline L-shaped plug.\n\nComet is about as sturdy an earphone as you’ll put in your ear. Fire it from shotgun. Grind it under SUV tyres, and maybe even tank tracks. It’s forged steel. Breaking it requires a forge.\n\nFit: ohmage and porridge\n\nI dare you to find a slimmer remote. I dare you to find one primed by discrete controls iOS with controls for play/pause and volume. I mean, check it: about as thick as an over-sturdy y-split. It bears stress relief on neither its front nor rear, but works well, and despite good functionality and controls, only barely weighs down the cable.\n\nIts neck cinch hard stops to the right of your heart, right below the remote control. This position makes it next to difficult to use when wearing Comet over the ear. Despite this, I think it’s good that the cinch isn’t above the remote.\n\nBecause Comet is so compact, meaty fingered folk may find pulling it out again tough. I imagine that Comet will weather the coming war.\n\nkitsch: ohmage\n\nBranding marques mill into the earphone bodies, are stamped onto the zipper pulls, case, and pin. As typical of Campfire, the case is overkill. Pack in a bunch of high-end earphones and sit on them. The fuzz-lined case will keep them safe. And it will outlast any other case. It’s perfectly engineered for everything except stuffing into pockets. Overkill but the best thing out there. From literature to box stylistic flourishes match perfectly, and each is wholesome. Comet’s accessory package fits next to grandma’s Mason jars as well as your tool bench. It’s well made, beautifully tooled, and doesn’t leave you guessing about the brand.\n\nNo kitsch here.\n\nSound: ohmage\n\nDespite its 97dB/48Ω spec, in practice Comet is nearly as sensitive as a Grado GR8e (itself one step removed from the Shure SE846). This means that it will pick up hiss from a large variety of players, DACs, and amps. This is particular trouble for louts like me who are getting back into Minidisk portables, the bulk of which hiss like the Dickens. The good news is that most well-designed DAPs have low enough noise floors to be absolutely silent through Comet. The few that aren’t really don’t deserve to be called audiophile, let alone targeted toward portable earphones.\n\nComet reveals enough hiss from my personal favourite Minidisk portable, the Sony MZ-E55, to be annoying at low volumes. The real problem is that the MZ-E55’s baked-in digital bass enhancement mates brilliantly with Comet, making me want to pair the two all the time. Enjoying the MZ-E55's amazing bass means weathering its hiss.\n\nDespite being relatively sensitive, Comet requires an volume extra step or two above a GR8e or JVC’s HA-FD 01, which is a god-send for analogue attenuators with mild low-power volume cant.\n\nBass vs. Mids: ohmage\n\nComet doesn’t power-yawn the intro seconds of Markus Schulz’s Mainstage, but it gets as close as I’ve heard from a neutral-leaning single armature earphone. In fact, I often wonder that Comet is powered by a single BA driver. Bass monster single BA earphones exist. Most decant mad lows to the detriment of everything else. Comet keeps mid to mid-high pressure in the lowest of lows whilst dekeing bloom. In short, Comet outputs good power that can pack a wallop, especially in bass-driven music like trance. It also responds well - though not excellently - to heavy EQs, Digital MegaBass, and the like. Paired with the MZ-E55, it handles Digital MegaBass at a setting of 2/3 without bloom, but at 3/3 it blooms, though mildly. In contrast, the Audio Technica CK10 is bloom-free all the way up to 3/3.\n\nComet’s low range is speedy. It shows good stereo spread. The spread hits the shoulders with minor z-axis gradients and a medium-high y-axis lift. While z-axis detail is limited, x-axis detail and spread defines smooth gradients that soften the wall-of-sound image typical to many single-BA earphones. Consequently, low-frequency instrument separation is good, but generally centrally anchors in a wide band that ping-pongs from one ear to the other, escaping outward when necessary, but largely staying put. Next to a good dynamic driver earphone like the MDR-EX1000, Comet reveals less low-frequency texture, but better delineates channels than the Sony.\n\nIt’s lows and lower, pre-vocal mids are nice and bitey.\n\nBass vs. Highs: ohmage & porridge\n\nIn my opinion, its weak spot is vocals, male in particular. It’s not that they are recessed, it’s that their top edges dull in comparison to their lead-in bottoms. At times, Comet puts Nick Cave, Christopher Martin, and sometimes, even The Boss, behind one too many filters. That quibble aside, Comet nails my personal preferences. They are: medium to high energy mids and upper mids, and non-spiky treble. Comet extends far with good sound pressure, and none of it peaky. Female vocals are clear, and free of ring. Cymbals, high hats, and other shimmery, shouty, instruments attack and decay quick with next to no wet reverb.\n\nNailed it.\n\nBalance: ohmage\n\nFor a single-driver BA, Comet sounds full, from bass to mids, errs slightly warm, and reaches well into the upper mids and highs with good, but not annoying sparkle. Personally, I'd like more vocal bite. But I can see where Comet, as is, is right on for the lad or ladess who doesn't faff around with The Boss, Nick Cave, and other fading stars of ballad and blue collar pathos.\n\nVs. Audio Technica CK10\n\nNext to to a CK10, upper vocal edges are dull. This is particularly the case with male vocals, against which percussion derives more energy and edge. But the upper mids and highs, where the CK10's sibilance and ring really annoy, Comet is spot on, clean, and clear. The CK10 also sounds more layered, giving more space to vocals. An amalgamation of Comet and CK10 would probably be perfect.\n\nVs. JVC HA-FD 01\n\nThe HA-FD 01 is hard to nail down, but in sum, it’s a flatter, less layered, less ringy version of the CK10. It’s also super customisable. In casts a wide sound stage, is more energetic up top than Comet, and its bass, while more textured, and stereo wide, is less impactful and controlled. I love its highs and vocals, but wish it had Comet’s bass sound pressure and control.\n\nVs. Sony MDR-EX1000\n\nThe MDR-EX1000 and Comet share something in the upper mids, but the Sony’s crazy wide stereo spread thins it out in comparison. I’ll be honest here, the Sony has, in short order, become a favourite. It has no weaknesses. But it’s not got the tight, controlled feel of Comet.\n\nEnd words\n\nSoft-edged male vocals side, I have no complaints with Comet. Its solid, impactful bass really moves things, and its controlled upper mids and highs round out one of the most tightly engineered sounds I’ve heard in a long time. It’s also really well made and generally easy to use. And, because it’s from Campfire, its branding isn’t just unique, it is practically collectible. Brands and products that speak for themselves are a treat, and way too few. Way to go.\n\nohmage: 7\n\nporridge: 2\n\nPros: Good overall sound performance,\n\nSolid build quality,\n\nNice accessories package,\n\nComfortable\n\nCons: Metal surface is prone to scratches,\n\nMissing of some micro detail\n\nCampfire Audio Comet Review\n\nAbout Campfire Audio:\n\nCampfire Audio is a US based company located in Portland – Oregon, which is specialized in the production of In-Ear Monitors.\n\nCampfire Audio launched there first In-Ear Monitors in summer of 2015 with three models, which are the Jupiter, Orion and Lyra.\n\nAfter the success of these models, Campfire Audio introduced the Nova and Andromeda in spring of 2016 that are milestones for the company in the audiophile market. The Lyra II, Dorado, and Vega (fall of 2016) are the there first IEM’s with a liquid alloy metal housing and the Polaris (August 2018) was the latest model right before the new Comet and Atlas came out in April 2018.\n\nThis review was originally posted on my Review Blog, which I want now to share with the Head-Fi community:\n\nOriginal Post: http://moonstarreviews.net/campfire-audio-comet-review/\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe Comet IEM was provided to me by Campfire Audio as a review sample. I am not affiliated with Campfire Audio or any third person beyond this review and all these words reflect my true, unaltered, opinions about the product.\n\nThe Price:\n\nThe Comet is sold for 199,00 USD and is available on Campfire Audio’s Official Store under the following link;\n\nPurchase link: https://campfireaudio.com/shop/comet/\n\nWarranty:\n\nCampfire Audio Comet includes a 1 year limited liability product warranty covering defects due to manufacturing and assembly.\n\nPackage and Accessories:\n\nThe Campfire Audio (in short CA) Comet came in a relative small orange cardboard box with turquoise patterns and a sticker laid over it, which is providing an image of the Comet.\n\nInside of this box are following items;\n\n1 pair x Campfire Audio Comet Monitor\n\n1 pcs x Copper Litz Cable with MMCX with Mic (has 3 button controls)\n\n1 set x Campfire Audio Marshmallow tips (small, medium, large)\n\n1 set x Silicon Ear Tips (small, medium, large)\n\n1 set x Spinfit Silicone Ear Tips (small, medium, large)\n\n1 pair x Protective fabric pouch\n\n1 pcs x Clearing Tool\n\n1 pcs x Campfire Audio Pin\n\n1 pcs x Black zipper case with faux shear ling lining\n\n1 pcs x Warrant Card & instruction manual\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet comes with lots of accessories. The standard package is including foam ear tips (Campfire Audio calls it Marshmallow), silicone ear tips with large bore and very comfy Spinfit silicone ear tips. All ear tips are coming in three (3) different sizes; small, medium and large.\n\nThe In-Ear monitors came in fabric pouches (each monitor has its own pouch) that protects from any scratching.\n\nBlack zipper case has leather like surface with a faux shear ling lining and sports the Campfire Audio logo on the top that looks pretty stylish.\n\nThere is also a cleaning tool and a pin with Campfire Audio Logo, which is a nice addition.\n\nThe Cooper Litz Cable:\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet comes with a 4 core braided Copper Litz (ALO Audio) wire cable that has a medical grade black PVC coating.\n\nThis cable has beryllium copper MMCX (Micro Miniature Coaxial) male connectors, a right angled 3.5mm TRS (single ended) headphone jack and an inline 3-button control with microphone.\n\nOn those connectors are left (blue dot) and right (red dot) markings that are easy to recognize.\n\nThe cable sports a black chin slider “made of metal” and a y splitter that is made of plastic.\n\nThe 3.5mm Gold plated TRS headphone jack is L angled and has a high quality rubber housing, which sports the Campfire Audio logo.\n\nDesign and Build Quality:\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet is made of CNC machined stainless steel that has a very different design language then the former models, which reminds me and some people in the community to a Hair Dryer or Sci-Fi pistol.\n\nThe all stainless steel housing has a polished glossy that looks and feels rock solid in my hand.\n\nOn the front is the sound nozzle with e machined grill spout, which has a unique appearance.\n\nYou can find on both sides of the housing, there Campfire Audio logo. At the bottom of the In-Ear Monitor is the Beryllium Copper MMCX connector that looks very solid and has a robust mating mechanism.\n\nFit, Comfort and Isolation:\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet has stainless steel housing, which is surprisingly comfortable to wear, but you should note that the nozzle is a bit on the bigger diameter, which could make some pressure to ears with small ear channel. I was able to wear the Comet for around 2 – 3 hours with breaks for every 30 min, without any discomfort. The noise isolation is above average, but not as good like IEM’s with semi custom acrylic/resin shell, but is ok for environments like bus, metro or train.\n\nFeatures:\n\nThe Comet utilizes a custom design vented full range balanced armature driver and features an Acoustic Chamber called T.A.E.C (Tuned Acoustic Expansion Chamber).\n\nThe custom Beryllium Copper MMCX eliminates the traditional shortcomings of the connection and harnesses all of its benefits. Beryllium Copper provides a robust mating mechanism; one that is typically made from soft brass. The selection of this harder material should extend the life of the component and the earphone.\n\nTechnical Specifications:\n\nDriver Units : 1 (single) x Full Range Balanced Armature Driver\n\nSpecial Features : Tuned Acoustic Expansion Chamber™ (T.A.E.C.)\n\nSPL : 97 dB @ 1K\n\nTHD : <1%\n\nImpedance : 48 ohm @ 1K\n\nFrequency Response : 20Hz – 20kHz\n\nEarphone connector : Beryllium Copper MMMC (Micro Miniature Coaxial Connector)\n\nDrivability (Impedance):\n\nThe impedance of the Campfire Audio Comet is 48 ohm @ 1K, which explains why it needs a bit more juice then regular IEM’s. The Comet can be used with portable sources like Smartphones, Tablet’s without the need of an external Amplifier, but shows its real potential when I use it with my DAP’s and DAC/AMP’s.\n\nSources:\n\na) In Ear Monitor : Campfire Audio Comet, Lear Luf Kaleido, Brainwavz B400\n\nb) DAP/DAC : Cayin N5II, Chord Mojo, Hidizs DH1000, Audirect Beam, Fiio M7\n\nc) Albums & Tracks used for this review:\n\nJehan Barbur – Yollar (Spotify)\n\nMinor Empire – Bulbulum Altin Kafeste (Spotify)\n\nLondon Grammar – Interlud (Live) (Flac 24bit/44kHz)\n\nLaura Pergolizzi – Lost On You “Live at Harvard and Stone” (Tidal Hi-Fi)\n\nSteve Srauss – Mr. Bones (Flac 16bit/44kHz)\n\nDire Straits – Money for Nothing (DSD 64)\n\nGothart – Jovano, Jovanke (Spotify)\n\nOtto Liebert & Luna Negra – The River (DSF) – Binaural Recording\n\nGoGo Penguin – Fanfares (Tidal Hi-Fi)\n\nAdam Taylor – Colour to the Moon (Flac 16bit/44kHz)\n\nCasey Abrams – Robot Lover (Tidal Hi-Fi)\n\nMorbid Angel – Drum Check (Spotify)\n\nCharly Antolini’s – Duwadjuwandadu (Tidal Hi-Fi)\n\nLiquid Tension Experiment 2 – Acid Rain (Spotify)\n\nOpeth – Damnation (Tidal Hi-Fi)\n\nMegadeth – Sweating Bullets (Flac 16bit/44kHz)\n\nMetallica – Sad bu True (Flac 24bit/96kHz)\n\nFuture Heroes – Another World (Tidal Hi-fi)\n\nLorde – Team (Flac 24bit/48kHz)\n\nTom Player – Resonace Theory “Album” (Tidal Hi-Fi)\n\nDeeperise feat.

I have used the medium sized stock silicone ear tips, which came in the box together with the Campfire Audio Comet.\n\nTonality:\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet does not sounding analytical or hot and is slightly on the warmer side of neutral, which I can descript musical.\n\nBass:\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet is an IEM with a custom design vented full range single balanced armature driver, which looks on paper as a disadvantage in the bass department. But Campfire Audio managed to archive a fairly good bass performance, which should be a result of the custom vented design.\n\nThe sub-bass area goes fairly low and has surprisingly good extension. The bass has pretty fast attack and good decay, especially for a single BA driver. The mid-bass area is not as present like the rest of the bass spectrum, but has some nice kicks when it’s called for.\n\nThe bass has moderate amount of pressure, which is enough for listening to genres like Pop, Edm or Trance, unless you’re descript your self as a bass-head. For example; I can hear some nice kicks when I listen to Deeperise feat. Jabbar – Move On, which I quite enjoy with the Comet.\n\nc) Mids:\n\nThe midrange of the Campfire Audio Comet sounds smooth and has velvet like presentation, with a moderate level of transparency. Both male and female vocals have a nice sense of body thanks to the relative full sounding lower end, while female voices have additional sparkle due a slightly boost in the upper midrange area.\n\nThe Comet has a quite good detail retrieval, which I didn’t expect from a Campfire Audio product with such a price label. It is not a detail monster, but shares some nice micro detail in GoGo Penguin’s – Fanfares, where you can find lots of instruments, which are playing at the background. The separation of instruments is above average and the upper midrange has a slightly boost, which sounds fairly controlled without any remarkable harshness or sibilance.\n\nAs I motioned before, the upper midrange has a slightly boost that sounds fairly controlled without any remarkable harshness or sibilance. This tuning allows the Campfire Audio Comet to provide a richer display of vocals and instruments.\n\nd) Treble:\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet has a slightly boost in the treble range, which makes the overall presentation a touch brighter than natural. The treble extension in this area is in a moderate level with a relative clear and airy presentation without remarkable flaws.\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet is quite capable regarding to speed and control in the treble/ upper treble region but is missing a bit o resolution, which can be found in IEM’s at the same price range.\n\nOne of the good characteristics of the treble presentation is that the Comet doesn’t sounds aggressive or harsh in this area. Instruments like cymbals and bells are sounding pretty controlled and pleasant in Charly Antolini’s song “Duwadjuwandadu”, even in higher volume levels.\n\ne) Soundstage:\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet has a soundstage with a fairly natural presentation, which offers more wideness than depth. There is enough space and air rendered between vocals and instruments and the positioning of instruments is pretty precise.\n\nComparisons:\n\nVs. LEAR LUF Kaleido:\n\nThe Lear Luf Kaleido is a Hybrid driver IEM with 2 Balanced Armature drivers and 1 dynamic driver, which I will compare with Campfire Audio Comet with 1 full-range BA diver.\n\nThe first noticeable difference between the Luf Kaleido and the Comet is in the bass department. The Luf Kaleido has noticeable more emphasis in both sub- and mid-bass department.\n\nThe sub-bass of the Luf Kaleido goes lower and has also more rumble than those of the Comet, but the is missing a bit more extension. The midbass of the LUF Kaleido has more quantity and sounds also punchier than those of the Comet, while the Campfire IEM has the upper hand for speed, control and bass decay. The bass of the Comet has also better texture and sounds also cleaner than those of the Kaleido.\n\nThe Lear Luf Kaleido sounds warmer and fuller in the midrange department, where it is missing some transparency and clarity, which the Comet has.\n\nBoth male and female vocals sounding fuller, more intimate and emotional with the Kaleido, where the Campfire Audio Comet offers more clearness and sparkle especially due the slightly rolled of upper midrange of the Kaleido, where the Comet really shines. The Comet has here also the better definition of instruments, while string instruments like guitar sounding more delicious with the Kaleido. The Lear Luf Kaleido sounds a bit too hot and veiled in the midrange compared to the Comet, which makes the sound a bit unnatural.\n\nThe treble range of the Campfire Audio Comet sounds airier and with more sparkle than those of the LEAR Luf Kaleido, which is also missing some resolution. The speed and control of both IEM’s is equal but the Comet has the upper hand for extension. The upper treble range of Comet sounds slightly dull, which makes instruments like cymbals, pianos and violins sounding a bit too hot and unnatural.\n\nWhen it comes to the soundstage performance, the Campfire Audio Comet has the upper hand for wideness, while performance for depth is nearly the identical (maybe a tad deeper with the Comet). The Comet is a bit more accurate in the subject of instrument placement.\n\nVs. BRAINWAVZ B400:\n\nThe Brainwavz B400 is a multi BA (Balanced Armature) driver IEM with 4 drivers, which I will compare with the Campfire Audio Comet with 1 full-range BA diver.\n\nThe Brainwavz B400 sounds fuller and warmer than the Comet. The B400 has more slightly more sub-bass rumble that goes to a slightly lower register than those of the Comet. The B400 has also the upper hand for extension and control in the bass department, while the speed is nearly identical. The mid-bass of the B400 is more prominent and gives additional punch when it called for.\n\nThe midrange of the Brainwavz B400 is warmer and darker than the Comet, which sounds airier and more spacious in this area. I am enjoying both IEM’s while listening to vocals, but I must say that I like the B400 more with male voices, while the Comet is the better choice for female vocal with is slightly brighter top end.\n\nThe B400 has the upper hand for the separation of instruments and detail retrieval in the midrange region.\n\nNow the game is changing when it comes to the treble performance. The Comet sounds brighter, extends better and has additional micro detail in this frequency region, which was a surprise for me due the single BA driver.\n\nThe Comet sounds also more alive compared to the B400, due the brighter top end, which shares also a nice rendering of air. The Brainwavz B400’s treble area sound a bit rolled off but has slightly better control, while playing instruments like Piano, Violin, etc., which are sounding also pretty controlled on the Comet too.\n\nThe soundstage performance of both IEM’s is pretty good compared to the price. The Campfire Audio Comet has a wider stage, while the Brainwavz B400 performs better for soundstage depth. The Brainwavz B400 is a bit more accurate regarding to the placement of instrument.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet is a solid piece of gear with its Stainless Steel Housing, different design language and premium build quality. I was a bit skeptical at the very beginning due Comet’s price and the single driver and didn’t expect such a sound performance, but it was nice to see and to hear that Campfire Audio has a product for a much more reasonable price.\n\nPros and Cons:\n\n+ Good overall sound performance\n\n+ Solid build quality\n\n+ Nice accessories package\n\n+ Comfortable\n\n– Metal surface is prone to scratches\n\n– Missing of some micro detail\n\nPros: Beautiful build quality\n\n-Suitable sound signature for both general/serious listeners\n\n-Great usability with smartphones\n\nCons: Fitting may be a bit deep for some\n\nIntro: Advanced to another level\n\nCampfire Audio is a leading audio brand that started small but quickly grew its reputation making hits after hits. Back then, I remember Orion and Jupiter gaining lots of attention since they came out and I eventually got the Orion. Although I have a pretty omnivorous taste when it comes to sound signatures, I rarely falls in love with 1BA in-ears. Orion was one of the few 1BA in-ears that I've been enjoying and it's still in my possession, serving me well as one of the old gears that I have.\n\nCA is one of my favorite audio brands and I decided to purchase Andromeda and Vega. Though ironically right after I got them in my hands, that new ad popped up on my Instagram feed - \"Introducing Atlas and Comet.\" The first thought in my mind was \"damn\" - since I could of waited a bit more before purchasing the Vega. (Vega actually serves me well, so I'm happy about it.) But that wasn't the main issue, as the next that came up in my mind was about the curiosity on Comet since it had the same driver configuration as my beloved Orion, and I had to figure it out. Comet has a price tag of $199, currently being the most affordable product from their lineup.\n\nOrdinary CA Packaging - simple yet pretty\n\nComet comes with the ordinary CA style packaging - simple yet pretty. The packaging has a vibrant orange theme and it's included with generous amount of accessories - a black leather case, 3 pairs of silicon tips, 3 pairs of foam tips, 4 pairs of Spinfit tips, a cleaning tool, cable ties, velvet pouches, a shirt pin, and some paper works. Basically all CA products comes with the same set of accessories but come on, I should admit that this makes the Comet even better since its way cheaper than other models.\n\nFresh looking earpieces\n\nCampfire came up with the new earpiece design which is completely different than the former ones. I must talk about the wearing style of the Comet, as CA finally came up with a straight-down style earpiece which must be good news to lots of folks. I actually prefer over-ear style over that but it wasn't an issue as it was just as comfortable as wearing them straight-down. The housings are made out of polished stainless steel, giving a shiny and mirror-like appearance. The earpieces are detachable from the cable, being equipped with MMCX connectors.\n\nBy the way..\n\nAs I stated in the beginning, Comet is equipped with single dynamic drivers with CA's well-known T.A.E.C technology. Nothing is particularly surprising until I've noticed that these BA drivers were vented like, which is rather uncommon. Final Audio FI-BA-SS is also equipped with vented 1BA drivers and was impressed with its sound before, so that is the main reason why I bought the Comet. The custom vented 1BA drivers definitely shows sonic differences from Orion or other 1BA IEMs, but let's talk about that on the lower section where I talk about its sound.\n\nCable with better usability\n\nComet's default cable is ALO Audio's copper litz cable (MSRP $149) but with a 3-button mic integrated to it, giving a much better usability for users who listen music out of their phones. The copper litz cable is one of the newest cable and I could say that it's quite nice, in terms of quality and smoothness of the wires. The cable is terminated with a L-shaped 3.5mm jack, and while it's a 4 pole jack (due to the mic) I didn't face any issues while pairing up with my DAPs. Besides, there's an additional \"step\" on the 3.5mm jack that allows smartphone users to stick it in with their phone cases on, so another good news for smartphone users and thumbs up for that, CA.\n\nSo how's the sound?\n\nOk, it's very typical to expect a flat, linear sound signature from 1BA iems. Well, Comet appears to be seeking a different path here. The bass is pretty plentiful for a 1BA, but what I'm more impressed about is its ability to express good thickness and density from the bottom - for a 1BA of course. The resonance is well controlled, so I didn't found the bass to be too splattery or messy. Overall, the bass presence is pretty clear with proper amount of resonance, so the bass amount should be plentiful enough for most users - unless you're a basshead.\n\nMids are slightly placed forward than the bass, having a natural transition from the bass. The thickness is actually quite adequate, showing good matching with both male and female vocals; pretty interesting as I found most 1BA iems to perform better on female vocals due to their thin sound on the mids. The brightness is right on the point, being neither bright or dark. Another point that I'd like to highlight is that Campfire managed to tame the mids from sounding metallic, giving an organic taste and color. However it still possesses a bit of shininess on the timbre which helps vocals to sound richer. Mids sound very stable throughout the frequency and doesn't occur any sibilance.\n\nThe treble amount on the highs are relatively laid-back though keeps its appearance clearly. The texture feels crispy yet not dry - or maybe I should say that it feels more moist than general 1BA IEMs, which is a good thing. Overall, the treble tends to smoothly flow away but with good response speed and density. Though it tends from making hard strikes in the head, so there isn't much cool or refreshing feeling on the highs. But again, the shiny texture that comes from the mids keeps the overall sound signature from getting too dark. It gives me an impression that the treble here serves more as a seasoning to the overall harmony. I believe the treble amount should be adequate for general users.\n\nCompared to Orion?\n\nComet is surely different than most 1BA IEMs, due to the vented BA driver. It shatters the bias around 1BA IEMs; which are usually considered to be flat, dry, and small staging/imaging. The staging feels adequately wide and surely better than most 1BA IEMs that I've tried before. It also does a pretty good job making the overall sound spatial, so it doesn't particularly feel flat when it comes to imaging. Can't say it's superb, since it's still a single BA, but it's surely up to standards and also competeable with general 2-3BA IEMs or 1DD IEMs.\n\nComet sounds more bassy and the textures are more moist and polished - giving me an impression of a very dense single DD rather than a 1BA. Quite different. Vocals sound slightly thicker compared to Orion but hey, it's still a single BA. It's actually just about the right thickness that would work well with both male and female vocals. Taking a look at the Orion, female vocals sounds more airy and sweeter here. Orion tends to lightly express the sound throughout the frequency, so some will find Orion to be sounding more neat and clean.\n\nThere are multiple aspects where Comet outdoes Orion, but I'd say it's pretty much more about personal preference. The gap between Orion and Comet is quite narrow, so I'll actually put them on the same league in terms of overall performance. It's very impressive if you consider the fact that the price tag on Comet is nearly $150 lower than Orion's. Those who tried Orion and prefers such sound may prefer Orion, but I can say that Comet has a sound signature that would fit general users very nicely, even if you're not a serious audiophile. Shortly, Orion tends to be more analytical while Comet goes for musicality.\n\nVerdicts\n\nI still love my Orion, but I could definitely see that Comet is presented on a very competitive price. While I wasn't expecting much from Comet before, I'm now surprised how much Campfire was able to advanced with single Balanced Armatures. The overall frequencies are tightly controlled while carefully allowing adequate amount of resonance, resulting into a sound that almost anybody could enjoy. Besides, it's capable of two different wearing style and featuring a remote, so I'd consider Comet to be satisfactory for both serious and general listeners. Let's not look down to Comet for being the cheapest model from the line up, because I won't complain even if it had a higher price tag. That should explain how much I'm satisfied with the Comet. If anyone's looking for an entry level IEM to start with, I'd say Comet will be a good place to start with.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nVisit aboutaudio.org or follow on Instagram / Facebook for more contents.​\n\nCampfire Audio Comet was purchased by myself.\n\nI am not affiliated to Campfire Audio.​\n\nPros: Unique design - Material quality - Impressive end-to-end extension for a full-range BA\n\nCons: Micro-detail - Large but flat sound stage leads to limited layering\n\nGreetings!\n\nCampfire Audio (CA) has garnered a pretty impressive reputation given the brand is only three years old and still in it's infancy. Mind you, being crafted by Ken Ball, the mind behind the juggernaut cable manufacturer ALO, ensured they would be in the spotlight right off the bat. Still, a reputation is earned and when you design a visually distinctive product that backs up those looks with sound to match, it can build in a flash. That's exactly what Campfire did, and with their two newest products in the Comet and Atlas, they're poised to continue their momentum and growth. Today we're checking out the Comet, Campfire's new entry level model which rings the tills at a reasonably affordable 199 USD.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThanks to Caleb at Campfire Audio for arranging a complimentary review sample of the Comet. While it does not need to be returned, it is still considered the property of Campfire Audio and will be returned immediately if requested. All thoughts within this review are my own and are not representative of Campfire Audio or any other entity. There was no financial incentive provided to sway my opinion.\n\nAt the time of this review the Comet retailed for 199 USD. You can check it out here: https://campfireaudio.com/shop/comet/\n\nUnboxing and Accessories:\n\nWhile exceptionally basic, the Comet's unboxing experience is pleasant and familiar. This time around , the cardboard box the Comet arrives in is bright orange with a matte orange sticker laid over it providing an image of the Comet. You also find some product information and contact details for Campfire Audio. I miss the swirling oil and water background present on the Polaris and Cascade's packaging, but the simplified imaging used here works well. The mountainous scenery and starry night are still present, this time printed in a vertical orientation and colored in a contrasting shade of teal. Opening the lid you're greeted on the inner flap by “Nicely Done”.\n\nInside, the package is dominated by Campfire Audio’s spacious and durable leather carrying case which, as is to be expected, holds the Comet. To my pleasant surprise, each ear piece is placed within it's own protective fabric bag, offering additional protection and stopping them from rubbing together and scratching during transit. The zipper is thick and durable with a redesigned pull tab prominently displaying the CA logo, while the inside of the case is lined with what feels to be loose, fluffy wool. Unlike most clamshell cases, there are two collapsible inner walls that hold the Comet securely in place when closed and zipped shut. This is one of, if not the nicest compact carrying case I've come across yet. Underneath the case beneath a false floor rests the accessories, a manual, and a card for the Comet’s limited warranty.\n\nThe included accessories include a variety of items, from various tip options to a Campfire Audio pin which I thought was pretty neat. It’s not a cheap feeling pin either, with the CA logo properly raised and enameled. In all you are provided;\n\nComet earphones\n\nLitz copper cable\n\nSingle flange SPINFIT tips (xs/s/m/l)\n\nCampfire’s own foam tips (s/m/l)\n\nSingle flange wide bore silicone tips (s/m/l)\n\nCleaning tool\n\nCA branded lapel pin\n\nThe accessories included are plentiful and of high quality, and the unique artwork on the box is very pleasing to the eye, even after experiencing it a few times on other Campfire products. Overall it is a very satisfying unboxing experience that includes just the right amount of accessories. It's a complete package and not something you should feel the need to add anything to out of the box.\n\nDesign, Build, Comfort, and Isolation:\n\nThe Comet features the brand's newest design language which is unlike anything else I've seen on the market, for better or worse you might say. Like it's predecessors, it is distinctly Campfire. The three piece shells are crafted from forged steel, then CNC machined down to the interesting shape you see before you. After being constructed by hand, the mirror finish is achieved by hand polishing the shells. The final result is as much jewelery as it is portable audio product, with it's silver sheen drawing attention wherever you go. The elongated shells evoke thoughts of products I would have expected residents in the 50's to find futuristic, and wouldn't be out of place if found among the populace in the popular Fallout series. Whether you think it looks like a ray gun or a hair dryer, you can't deny the Comet is eye-catching, or at the very least interesting.\n\nIt's well built too, as is to be expected from the brand. Tolerances for fit and finish are low with the three sections that make up each ear piece fitting together snugly. The nozzles are especially nice given they're not a separate piece with the protective grills included as part of the machining process. The CA logo on each side is flawlessly machined with the MMCX interface incorporated into the base of each ear piece in a way that is hardly noticeable, save for the black plastic holding the connector in place. This is the only plastic present and isn't visible once the cables are in place.\n\nThe included cable might seem familiar to fans of the Polaris. Campfire re purposed the Polaris' excellent copper cable for the Comet, removing the memory wire and adding an in line microphone and three button control module. Left and right channels are fairly easily determined by small L and R makings molded into the connectors, as well as blue and red dots for further channel verification. Microphonics are minimal as is memory, and it does a great job of avoiding tangling should you fail to store it neatly in the included leather carrying case. The MMCX connectors feature Campfire's unique beryllium/copper construction which is more durable than what the competition provides. While I still don't recommend detaching the cable unless necessary, you can do so with confidence the connectors will retain a reliable connection. The only issues I have with the cable are that it gets stiff in cold weather, and the microphone is set a couple inches too far down the cable which restricts the usefulness of the chin cinch.\n\nWhen it comes to fit it's great that Campfire went with a more universal design with the Comet. The ear pieces are mirrored. This means you don't have to worry about which side is which when plugging in the cables since they not dedicated to one channel or the other, and they fit the same regardless of which ear they're in. They're also designed to be worn cable up or down vs. the cable up designs found throughout the majority of the CA lineup. Given this is their entry level product, such flexibility is important. My only qualm is with the weight of the earphone. The Comet is fairly heavy, but, it is also well balanced so the weight ends up being distributed well once in the ear. They never disappear as you always feel a light tug, but it's far from being a deal breaker. You can always wear them cable up if it's an issue since that negates the weight almost entirely.\n\nIsolation is also pretty impressive, but that's not unexpected. While the armature drivers themselves are vented, the ear pieces are not. Combined with the included foam tips or Spintfits, isolation is well above what you generally get with vented dynamic driver based products. These would be fantastic for use on transit, in noisy environments when working or studying, or any other situation where you'd want to drown out your environment.\n\nIn-line Controls and Call Quality:\n\nAll three buttons on the remote worked perfectly with my LG G5 with the Comet able to control volume, skip back and forth through tracks, answer and hang up calls, etc. Ergonomics for the control module were just okay though. The three buttons are very similar in shape with little distinction beyond a small bump on the middle button. To ensure I hit what I was looking for, I would sweep my fingers over the module to feel for the button, and go from there. The buttons are also quite thin, though easy to depress and with a satisfying click.\n\nWhen it comes to the mic, it's call quality is shockingly good. My voice came through loud and clear to callers. The only issue is, and this comes back to something mentioned earlier, placement of the mic on the cable. It's too low and as a result the mic is always brushing against my shirt. Fine if you're sitting still, less so when on the move. This is rectified mostly by wearing the cable over ear to raise the mic, but it shouldn't be necessary.\n\nOverall I was extremely impressed with how good this mic sounds. It's definitely up there with my favorites like the JVC HA-FRD60, HA-FRD80, and YHC S600. Fix the placement issue and it would be nigh perfect.\n\nSources and Mobile Use:\n\nFor at home use the Comet was paired with my TEAC HA-501 desktop amplifier sourced by my ASUS FX53V laptop. On the TEAC, I listened with the damping factor set either to 'mid' for improved clarity and micro detail, or 'low' which improved long term listen-ability and bass response.\n\nOn the road, I often played the Comet straight out of my LG G5 which easily powered it to uncomfortable listening volumes, despite relatively high power requirements (97 dB sensitivity @ 48 ohms).\n\nPairing it with a number of players, I found the Comet fantastic with neutral to warm players like the HiFi E.T MA8, Shanling M1, F.Audio S1, and HiFiMan MegaMini, all of which synergized well. The MegaMini in particular sounded amazing with the Comet by lowering treble emphasis slightly and opening the sound stage depth right up. It made for an exceptionally smooth, nautral, and yet fairly spacious pairing. Brighter players like the Walnut V2S and Xduoo Nano D3 exacerbated the Comet's treble and threw the balance off completely. The D3 was an especially poor mate since it also displays early low end roll off.\n\nI recommend source rolling with the Comet if you have the luxury to do so. It sounds best through neutral to warmer sources in my experience. The high-ish impedance also keeps hissing and background noise with your devices to a minimum.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nDriver: Single full range balanced armature\n\nImpedance: 48 Ohm @1kHz\n\nSensitivity: 97 dB SPL/mW\n\nFrequency Response: 20Hz – 20kHz\n\nSound:\n\nFull-range balanced armatures (BA) always seem to make sacrifices when it comes to extension. The Brainwavz B100 has great mids and treble but lacks a little umph down low. The B150 has a thick mid and mid-bass presence but is missing some sparkle and sub-bass. The EarNiNE EN1J has an amazing mid-range, but can be seen lacking somewhat everywhere else. Campfire seems to have found a solution to this with the Comet. The use of a vented design aids in bass extension while the application of Tuned Acoustic Expansion Chamber (T.E.A.C.) tech, as seen on their more premium models, improves treble extension. What this results in is a well-rounded and flexible full-range armature with a balanced signature that leans towards a very reserved v-shape.\n\nTreble is emphasized and vibrant and gives the Comet's some air and space. It gives off a good amount of shimmer and sparkle with cymbals and other effects without any overemphasis that might cause discomfort. Micro-detail is somewhat lacking though, with textured effects coming across smoother than they should. This airiness in the treble positively affects the mid-range which despite being set back slightly is very clear and intelligible. Vocals have a natural sense of weight and body to them with just a hint of warmth that carries over wonderfully with female vocals.\n\nTonally, the Comet is quite similar to the Polaris to my ears but is less dry and slightly more organic. Once again though, micro-details are under emphasized and smoothed over. Hearing fine details, like those of fingers sliding over strings, requires more effort than I would expect from an armature based earphone. The low end is well extended with an uncommon amount of punch for a BA. It's snappy and articulate with a reserved decay that is more in line with micro dynamic drivers than other BAs. This gives the Comet's bass presence and authority. Overall quantity is still fairly low, not much beyond neutral, and is in a good place when considering balance with other frequencies. Texturing is decent with grungy basslines represented well. I found the sound stage fairly large, but also somewhat flat. Separation is great, but layering feels a couple steps behind since there simply isn't room for instruments to play. As a result, on congested tracks the Comet begins to display a wall-of-sound effect making individual instrument distinction more difficult than might be preferred.\n\nOverall I find it to have a slightly bright and engaging sound with a hint of warmth and a full mid-range, a prominent but not tiring treble presence, and bass that carries itself with confidence. Micro-detail is acceptable and staging is large but not particularly deep. As such, the Comet's ability to layer on complicated tracks falters. Imaging accuracy and separation are satisfying though, and so is the Comet.\n\nSelect Comparisons: Volume matching completed with a Dayton Audio iMM-6\n\nEarNiNE EN2J (267.00 USD) – The EN2J, like the Comet, features custom-built and designed balanced armatures developed in-house by the EarNiNE team. On each side you find a full-range driver supplemented by a woofer. I find EarNiNE's armatures have a very distinct, love-it-or-hate-it breathiness that contrasts greatly with the Comet's smoother presentation. The EN2J is relentlessly detailed compared to the Comet and is much more suited to someone looking to analyze their music. It's technically impressive but not as satisfying when it comes to pure enjoyment. The Comet is musical and robust with greater weight behind it's output, and more fullness to the mid-range. The EN2J's sound stage is larger and more rounded with impressive layering and separation qualities that the Comet can't match. When it comes to build, the EN2J is once again alike the Comet in that it features steel earpieces, though it uses a different manufacturing process to get it's result; hairline processing. While the EN2J looks and feels great, it's polished effect isn't as pure and lacks the mirror-like quality of the Comet. Overall fit and finish is on par, though the EN2J is taken down a peg via the application of plastic nozzles. Comfort isn't perfect for me on either but I'd give the EN2J the edge. It's low profile, Shure-styled housings nestle in well once you've found the right tips, through they lack flexibility in that they can only be worn cable-up. Speaking of cables, while I like Campfire's I love EarNiNE's. It's thin, light, super flexible, shows no microphonics, and is well relieved with a great chin cinch. I doubt it will be as durable long term but that is overridden completely by just how unobtrusive and pleasant it is to use.\n\nWhile I appreciate the EN2J for the detail and clarity it brings to the table, it simply isn't as enjoyable to use as a daily driver as the Comet has proven to be.\n\nBrainwavz B400 (199.00 USD) – Where the Comet features single custom full-range BAs per side, the B400 implements quad Knowles BAs per side. This results in two very different sounding earphones. The B400 is warmer and more organic or analogue, with a deeper, fuller sound, vs. the Comet's brighter, more lively presentation. The B400 has greater extension in either direction, though I wouldn't expect it given the Comet's upper frequency presence that is much more reserved on the B400. To me the Comet's staging in general feels larger and more spacious but lacks the layering and depth of the B400. It also falls behind in terms of imaging accuracy and separation, all of which are standout qualities on the B400. While the Comet is reasonably detailed, it doesn't pick up subtle track nuances in quite the same way the B400 does. When it comes to comfort, the B400's low profile housings fit my ears more naturally. Isolation is equally excellent between the two with the B400 getting a slight edge due to the way it fills the outer ear, especially when you thrown on some foam tips. In terms of build, the B400's earpieces fall far behind not only the Comet, but most every other similarly priced product, particularly if you get a colored model. There's no comparison. In terms of cables, the Comet's stock cable both looks and feels much more price appropriate than what you get with the B400 which shares cables with lesser models in the B-Series lineup, it just happens to be removable via MMCX. The quality of the B400's Frosty upgraded cable option is much more in line with the Comet's stock cable, but it tacks an extra 30 USD onto the overall cost.\n\nWhen it comes to sound the B400 is a technical powerhouse compared to the Comet, however, the lack of treble emphasis may hinder the enjoyment factor for those that prefer a more lively sound. The Comet's vastly superior materials also serve to highlight the potential fragility of the B400's 3D printed construction.\n\nAAW Q (223.00 USD) – The AAW Q canal phone provides sound via 6mm microdrivers and is unique because it's ear pieces are hardly larger than the driver within. When inserted, the entirely of the Q rests inside your ear canal. The Comet isn't a large earphone, but it absolutely dwarfs the Q which is one of the most comfortable products I've put in my ear to date. The Q is much warmer and bassier. It falls behind the Comet in terms of detail, clarity, speed and texture but hits with more authority and extends further into the low end with greater sub-bass presence. Mids are set slightly further back on the Q which seems more in tune with male vocals that are comparatively thin and lacking body through the Comet. Treble on the Comet is much more emphasized giving it more sparkle and an overall engaging sound. Sound stage on the Q is wider and deeper and overall more enveloping. They image similarly with the Comet's thinner sound helping it out with more minute movements. Layering goes to the Q where the depth of it's stage goes a long way to a more natural presentation. Separation is similar with the Comet having an edge. Build and design handily goes to the Comet. Both use steel housings, but the Q is mostly devoid of any elements of style and has a fixed cable. That said, I suppose there isn't much that can be done with a housing that's smaller than a medium sized ear tip, nor could a detachable cable be easily integrated without losing the appeal of the Q's compact design.\n\nThese two really couldn't be more different. The Q is tiny and bassy with a less robust construction and simple design that plays into it's size and impossibly low weight. The Comet is stylish and more neutral in signature with a better build, removable cable, and overall greater value quotient.\n\nCampfire Audio Polaris (599.00 USD) – The Polaris is one of Campfire's newer models and features a 1+1 hybrid configuration. A/Bing it with the Comet, a task made somewhat challenging by the Polaris' greater efficiency, you can certainly hear the family resemblance in the tonality and presentation of the mids and treble. To my ears the Polaris comes across slightly brighter and with a touch of dryness in the mids compared to the Comet's slightly darker sound. The Polaris I found more detailed, especially in the lower treble where the Comet is somewhat smoothed over. In the low end there isn't much of a comparison given the Polaris has a dynamic driver, and a very good one at that, dedicated to the task. It feels quicker with better extension, and has more texture, slam and impact than what you get from the Comet. Still the Comet's full-range BA does a commendable job given the circumstances. In terms of design and build, both are iconic in my opinion. The Polaris' anodized, two-tone aluminum shells suffer from paint loss over time, but based on what I've seen, that is a point of pride for some owners who enjoy showing off their well-loved and worn Campfire earphones. My Comet's polished steel housings have yet to scratch or show any wear, something I couldn't say about the Polaris after the same amount of time. I suspect it will remain blemish free far longer than the Polaris. The Comet and Polaris share the same cable with a couple alterations. The memory wire present for the Polaris is gone, a big plus in my opinion as it wasn't particularly effective, and an in line mic has been added. The mic makes the chin cinch ineffective due to how low it is on the cable, something Campfire should look into adjusting.\n\nThe Comet and Polaris aren't really comparable given the vast difference in price and driver configuration, however, comparing them anyway shows the Comet is a great first step into the Campfire lineup and gives you an idea of what to expect from the brand should you continue your journey up to their more premium offerings.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nIt's always nice to see a brand know for premium offerings provide a more affordable entry into the lineup that doesn't sacrifice what makes them so appealing in the first place. The Comet offers a uniquely interesting design that is distinct to Campfire Audio while retaining the excellent unboxing experience and accessory kits of their more expensive products. The build quality is second-to-none with well-constructed, hand-polished stainless steel housings. It brings in features that are suitable for the price point and which make it accessible to a wider audience, such as the inclusion of an in line mic for mobile use, and the ability to be worn cable up or down. The quiet cable makes each style of wear equally viable too, though cable up is better to take advantage of impressive call quality on the in line mic. While the Comet isn't the be-all-end-all of micro-detail and could benefit from greater depth of sound stage, its performance is in line with similarly priced products. It also provides exceptional extension for a single full-range balanced armature avoiding the sacrifices common to the format, especially in terms of bass reproduction.\n\nCampfire Audio has done a fantastic job of bringing to the market a new product that is rife with the style, technology, and quality they are known for, all while avoiding cutting corners to keep costs down. This is not an earphone you need to approach with caution and is something you can purchase with confidence.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n- B9Scrambler\n\n***** ***** ***** ***** *****\n\nSome Test Material:\n\nAesop Rock - Skelethon (Album)\n\nDaft Punk - Random Access Memories (Album)\n\nElton John - Yellow Golden Brick Road (Album)\n\nKing Crimson - Lark's Tongues in Aspic (Album)\n\nKing Crimson - Starless and Bible Black (Track)\n\nSupertramp - Crime of the Century (Album)\n\nInfected Mushroom - Converting Vegetarians (Album)\n\nInfected Mushroom - Legend of the Black Shawarma (Album)\n\nGorillaz - Plastic Beach (Album)\n\nMassive Attack - Mezzanine (Album)\n\nFleetwood Mac - Rumors (Album)\n\nRun the Jewels - Run the Jewels (Album)\n\nThe Prodigy - The Day is My Enemy (Album)\n\nTobacco - screw*d Up Friends (Album)\n\nFelt - Felt 2 (A Tribute to Lisa Bone) (Album)\n\nPros: Congruent balanced and well tuned sound, decent cable and choice of tips, price\n\nCons: Fit can be tricky at first, cable slider doesn't go all the way\n\nCampfire Audio Comet Review\n\n- Expatinjapan\n\nhttps://campfireaudio.com/shop/comet/\n\n'Really Good Stuff. The Comet simply sounds good. Really good. It has a nicely balanced low-mid fullness with the high frequency extension magic from our 3D modeled Tuned Acoustic Expansion Chamber sprinkled on top.The weight of new stainless steel body feels great in the hand and the low profile design keeps it comfortable in your ear. An excellent seal lets you block out the world and escape into your music. Comet is designed and assembled in our Portland, Oregon workshop.' - Campfire Audio\n\nCampfire Audio Comet and Opus#1S\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet (and Atlas) seemed to come out of nowhere. Whilst it is true that Campfire Audio regularly releases new earphones, often adds to its line up and also replaces earlier models with new and updated versions the arrival of the the Comet and Atlas came as a bit of a shock.\n\nCampfire Audio had just released the Cascade headphone to popular acclaim and the two new IEMs came hot on its heels.\n\nThe more surprising point was a new shell for both, and of stainless steel!, also a new cable that came with the Atlas, the Comet sharing the same cable as the Polaris but with a mic.\n\nWhat hit most and sent ripples of glee throughout many a budding Campfire Audio fan was the price, US $199. Finally a Campfire Audio model that would provide an affordable entry into the Campfire Universe.\n\nHow does it compare to the rest of the CA line up, does it keep to the standard of performance we have become accustomed to from Campfire Audio? Lets find out.\n\nUnboxing\n\nCampfire Audio Black Textured Earphone Case\n\nNicely done!

Of course we know everyone wants to know what the sound is like. I gave some early impressions of the Vega and Lyra ii that I had heard at a Tokyo show using the Comply tips, which was fairly generalized and accurate according to Ken Ball but found my findings to be off when I changed to other silicone stock and JVC Spiral Tips.\n\nTips, ears, daps, yanny and laurel all play a part in gathering information on what is to be an accumulated average of what one can expect.\n\n'Fools rush in where angels fear to tread'.\n\nAdmittedly I do have queue system where rarely one item leap frogs the others, probably to the consternation and frustration of both my dear readers and the companies themselves (perhaps somewhat appeased by the unboxing photos for a time). It helps democratize it and gives form to what could possibly be disorganized .\n\nOrdo ab Chao.\n\nMost reviewers after a time become accustomed to picking up clues and references and could probably pump out a set of impressions or a review within a week. Yet like the peeling of an onion we might only see the surface layers, over time more may be revealed with extended listening periods and different daps and tips etc.\n\nAlways keeping in mind that to one reader $1000 for an earphone is normal and affordable, whilst to another a $100 earphone means some serious saving. So the time it takes is a mixture of things combined with the usual measures of life ... family, work and other pleasures.\n\nThe thought of many a reviewer is 'Am I accurate...enough'. As I have heard from discussions with other reviewers everyone is well aware that it is peoples wallets we are dealing with here, and for some the choice is for only one item. So time and special consideration must be held.\n\nThe Comet being both a Campfire Audio item and also falling into that 'affordable' zone of $50-$250 is for many a serious consideration.\n\nBut as on many an occasion...I digress.\n\nCampfire Audio Comet and Opus#3\n\nWell all things considered how does one start?\n\nThe iBasso DX200 Amp 1 is a fairly neutral and reference sound and is a good place to get a benchmark of sorts.\n\nAlso using the CA Andromeda for a time helps to 'reset' my ears.\n\nFirst with the stock tips.\n\nLater after trying some aftermarket market tips, and comparing with different daps, volume matched with a SPL meter and using a convenient headphone switcher box and ALO Cables for freshness.\n\nLater some comparisons with the other single BA earphone in the Campfire Audio line up, The Orion which is probably its closest sibling. with stock cables. Then also Comet/stock and orion/ Polaris cable and then Comet/Litz and Orion/ Stock Litz. Whilst there is an obvious double price difference there we can establish some benchmarks is performance: single BA, same company.\n\nLater dig out a few other earphones in around the same price category and hook them up to the headphone switcher and get and idea of how it compares in performance with them.\n\nSo all in all a time consuming process, and not every step has been listed. All for a $200 earphone, cheap for some, pricey for others. Hence the reason why whether its a $50 item of a $1000 earphone the same effort and procedures are gone through each and every time.\n\nThe results might seem simplistic at times, but they are an accumulation of the above processes which do take time and then presented to the reader in a understandable fashion which at times might seem overly basic, always bearing in mind that the readership is an international audience and for some English is a second, third or fourth language.\n\nBut reader rest assured that it is the result of gentle distilling in a audio alchemists alembic to discover the hidden sonic stone.\n\n\"Hurry up Head pie! I didn't skip to the Sound section to read all this Jabberwocky!\"\n\nCampfire Audio Comet and iBasso DX200 / amp 1\n\nOkay, okay enough of what happens behind the curtain of the Wizard of Oz...\n\nThe Comet. Campfire Audios latest and cheapest. 'Oh me, me! I wanna ride on the Campfire Audio train - this is within my price range` I hear you say, nay cry out in joy.\n\nIs it for you? perhaps.\n\nWell first I have to unplug my trusty Campfire Audio Andromeda which I use as a familiar benchmark a reference point to start from If you will.\n\nThe first thing most users will notice with the CA Comet is that one has to turn up the volume as these little beasts require a bit of juice to get em going at 48 Ohms, and not just when switching from the overly sensitive and sweet Andromeda neither.\n\nI have betrayed some faith by starting with the familiar to me JVC Spiral Dot tips and not the stock tips. The Spiral Dots to my ears give the benefits of foam and silicone combined, a decent low end and also with their wide bore they retain the highs. Also personally I get the best fit with these out of all the tips I have tried. So many, so much tip rolling to eternity.\n\nThe iBasso DX200 with its 1 Ohm output impedance combined with the neutral/reference Amp 1 gives a decent baseline on which to build. Of course the obvious mismatch to some of a $200 earphone with a $1000 or so dap might be grating. But the initial stretching will prepare us later as we go down and up the chain. perhaps the Shanling m0 and Comet could be a good starter audiophile kit, or something more mid fi in dap land? we will find out.\n\niBasso DX200, Amp 1 and Campfire Audio Comet.\n\nJVC Spiral Dot tips.\n\nSmooth, luscious, well balanced, vocals slightly forward, wide, coherent.\n\nStock silicone\n\nLess control at times, a bit of graininess, sound stage smaller, more effort driving, still acceptable.\n\nStock foam tips\n\nA bit digital, slight holographic sense, larger sound, highs seem still present. A brighter version of the JVC.\n\nSpinFits\n\nThey are brighter than the JVC SD and lose a tiny bit of the mids, nice control, airy.\n\n*I would go for the stock foams then the Spinfits... (they seem different from when i last tried them a long time ago - thicker silicone?) ...If I bought the Comet and If i didnt have the JVC SD.\n\nBut everyone has different ears...\n\nOk turning up the volume to terrible levels the Comet and my ears dont like it, a bit of a loss of control. but this is way too loud, and I already listen loud.\n\nGain 1 at 100 - 111 volume seems a nice place.\n\nCampfire Audio Comet and Shanling M3s\n\nOk. lets move over to the Head phone switcher box and volume match these daps.\n\nI will continue to use the JVC Spiral Tips.\n\nAll Daps are the most recent firmware for each.\n\nFiiO X7ii stock amp\n\niBasso DX200 stock amp 1\n\nOpus#2\n\nCoherent, well balanced, detailed, excellent timbre, above medium sound stage, vocals smooth, more height and width than depth, nice reach for the highs - not hint of sibilance, deep, strong and fast bass.\n\nEnjoyable and pleasurable to listen to.\n\nEchobox Explorer (UAPP app)\n\nOpus#3\n\nA little bit more space owing to the Burr brown airy and spacious signature.\n\nStill very even and coherent, vocals just above the music, clear and defined guitars, nice separation between instruments. Control with clarity.\n\nOpus#1\n\nOpus#1S\n\nShanling M3s\n\nSmooth, fun, easy to listen to, instruments are well separated, lots of space. Coherent.\n\nNot as layered at the TOTL daps first used.\n\nOpus daps SE output impedance is 2 Ohm, Shanling M3s is 1 Ohm. The pleasing bass and low end of the Shanling M3s and Opus#1s is similar.\n\nThe Opus#1 is more linear and neutral.\n\nSound stage is medium.\n\nGeneral: a neutral and accurate sound was reproduced which showcased the Comets ability, whilst also owing to the daps general signature which emphasized the Comets excellent tuning.\n\nShanling M0\n\nipod touch 6G with Flacplayer app by Dan Leehr\n\niBasso DX200 amp 1\n\nThe ipod touch was a bit thinner than the others, performance was slightly behind and it was good up to about 75% volume.\n\nThe Shanling m0 held its own, surprisingly for one so small. Quite dynamic and musical when paired with the Comet whilst also maintaining the coherency and overall even and balanced signature that seems to be the Comets forte. Vocals slightly more forward than the other daps.\n\nWith the DX200 the excellent tuning of the Comet is revealed even more as we come full circle, it scales up well, although incremental. Timbre, layering, depth and intimacy is compounded and expanded whilst the delicacy the Comet is capable of becomes more easily audible.\n\nThe Campfire audio Comet behaves more like a Dynamic driver than a single BA.\n\nNicely done! A well balanced earphone, smooth, detailed, great resolution that scales up, decent sound stage and separation, with an excellent synergy between the bass/mids/treble and delicious vocals slightly forward with enough air to please.\n\nCampfire Audio Comet and Opus#1S\n\nComet vs Orion\n\nWith their different sensitivity I had to raise and lower the volume with each earphone change, so this comparison is imperfect.\n\nThe Orion comes across a bit lighter and at times overly eager when compared to the Comet at first look. though it does have more layering and timbre.\n\nTightly packed, with a slight v to it, perhaps owing to the Litz cable.\n\nThe Comet is more tame and smoother. even a crowd pleaser.\n\nCable swap buddies!\n\nThe Orion with the Comet cable: A bit smoother, evened out a bit more. warmer, more intimate.\n\nThe orion seemed to pair well with the Comet cable, achieving a better balance overly, smoother with more luscious mids. An unbearable lightness at other times of being.\n\nThe Comet with the Litz wasnt a complete wash out, but it did seemed to lose what made it so pleasing as it ventured more towards a v shape. A bit darker, more up beat at times, other times more treble. Those mids went bai bai. It lost its exquisite balance imho.\n\nTip rolling. Stock and others.\n\nNot sure what i can say about this, as each to their own preference really. I was going to write about my journey to find the right tips, but thats my story - a little of which i wrote about earlier in the sound section.\n\nMany a budding audiophile will rely strictly to the stock tips and bless or curse a product on the results of them alone.\n\nI as many others do recommend trying out different tips:\n\nGet a good fit, comfortable, well sealed and with good isolation.\n\nAlso you can tune the music with your choice of tips, the type (foam/silicone/flange etc), the length and bore size.\n\nPlay around until it feels comfortable and you can hardly hear it as you click your fingers by your ear.\n\nInsertion is often over looked. proper insertion.\n\nPull your ear up by the top most point, and then pull it slightly back. Then insert your earphones. this can help prevent trapped air, driver flex, no sound or general uncomfortableness.\n\nAnyway JVC Spiral Tips for me, with the occasional Ortofon, although as mentioned I did enjoy the Foam and Spinfit stocks tips. My ears are fussy.\n\nExtra! Extra! Cable rolling\n\nRegardless of the photos below I used the iBasso DX200 with amp 1 for congruency and continuity.\n\nThe CA Litz I already covered above with the orion comparison.\n\n1,2,3! Its the Atlas cable - Silver (The other stock cable the litz is silver plated copper) pictured here with the CA Atlas.\n\nQuite smooth, dreamy, slight holographic tint, increased clarity but not at the expense of the Comet signature. Intimacy. I love it. Slight drop in the mids perhaps.\n\nI have been waiting to try the Vega and Andromeda with this cable for when I write the Atlas review, I might have to do it sooner.\n\nStill the stock cable is more than satisfactory, more a side upgrade for this earphone.\n\niBasso DX200 / Amp4 and ALO Audio SXC-8 to 4.4mm and Campfire Audio Comet.\n\nWell...overkill, what can iI say? should I say it?\n\nKen suggests the SXC-8 is better suited to a dynamic driver earphone such as the Atlas, I found the cable too heavy in weight for the likes of the tiny Comet. How it sounded is irrelevant. Not a good match size wise.\n\niBasso DX200 amp 4, iBasso CA adapter\n\nand iBasso CB13 Cable to Campfire Audio Comet.\n\nNice and intimate, a mix of copper and silver, quite balanced a nice mid point between the new CA silver cable and the stock copper cable. A little more space,, treble... but very close.\n\nALO Audio/CA Reference 8\n\nA tad too much emphasis on the mids for Comet. Nice bit of space at times, sometimes too airy. but lacks that intimacy, balance and smoothness of the stock cable.\n\nConclusion: I would recommend sticking with the stock cable, if you are desperate, then I would If forced say the ALO/CA Atlas cable.\n\nPrice\n\nUS $199 from Campfire Audio and recognized distributors and dealers\n\nhttps://campfireaudio.com/shop/comet/\n\nEarly travels with the Campfire Audio Comet\n\nOverall\n\nThe Campfire Audio Comet fits in to a long awaited entry level position to access the ever popular Campfire Audio series of earphones.\n\nIt presents as an easy listening, smooth, non offensive, well balanced earphone. One thats sure to be a pleaser to most ears. Great bass and low end, full hits extending into the sub bass, no bleed into the mids, mids are nice and clean. The overall sound is fast with a slight linger to it all, treble is fine and extends enough without a trace of sibilance. The Comet is deep, wide yet intimate.\n\nThe Comet is resolving enough for most users, and has enough separation, space and sound stage to please. It has a nice body to the sound, yet the timbre and layering isn't as present as say a more expensive single BA model such as the Jomo Haka which aims at a more reference sound.\n\nIt is a credit to the tuning that it is reminiscent of the iBasso IT01 a single DD, but the (BA) Comet is more balanced, smooth and refined in comparison.\n\nAdmittedly and obviously this is a $200 earphone and fits into that space within the Campfire Audio line up, yet others might find it delivers more than expected when compared to others of a similar price point.\n\nThe fit is easy whether hanging down or over ear as the Comet is reasonably lightweight. I find myself moving between the two options. It is comfortable and doesn't seem to have any edges that irritate my ears. No memory wire means they hang nicely over the ear. Stock cable is decent no real need to upgrade.\n\nThe Comet is an easy fitting single BA earphone that acts like a single DD from a company that delivers excellent products, and the Comet comes at a price that is generally affordable and when matched with an entry level or mid fi (or totl) dap is sure to please.\n\nIts always a good sign when one finishes a review and keeps listening to the earphone...\n\nThank you to Campfire Audio for sending Head pie the Comet for review\n\nPros: Gorgeous build quality, top shelf materials, good kit, and surprisingly good sound. A gateway drug for Campfire's other products.\n\nCons: Would like to see other cable options or at least move the mic and slider to be useful. Can get overwhelmed, lacks extension of flagship models, somewhat temperamental fit.\n\nIn ancient times, Comets were thought to be omens of things to come. They were either feared as harbingers of hard times to come or welcomed as messengers of good times to come. In the case of the Campfire Comet, I see nothing to fear, the good times begin the minute you put them in your ears.\n\n​\n\nIntroduction\n\nCampfire Audio is an offshoot of ALO Audio and probably needs little introduction to most head-fiers. They have been making earphones for some time and have recently started making an over ear headphone (the Cascade reviewed here). I was thoroughly impressed with the Cascade and the Andromeda but there is a catch. Typically, Campfire’s products have commanded a price that was simply out of range of a lot of us. I had promised Ken in an earlier conversation that if they came out with a budget conscious model, that I would be in line to buy it immediately upon release so the first payday after release, my order went in for the Comet. For those keeping score, I paid full retail price for the Comet and placed my order online so there is no reason to believe my order was given any special treatment. I did pay for 2 day shipping as I was really looking forward to hearing them.\n\nUnboxing\n\nAfter waiting the longest two days I have in quite some time, the Comet arrived. The Standard Fedex shipping box yielded a small rectangular tan/orange box with robin’s egg speckles. The bright orange label wraps from the top of the box to the front flap and clearly identifies the contents but stops short of listing all the specs. The box lists the Comet as a full range balanced armature driver while the web site is quick to point out that this is a vented armature so should not have the voids often associated with single BA earphones. Inside the box sits the standard soft case with the carpet style lining but unlike the other Campfire products I have tried, the earpieces were both shipped in their own individual grey cloth pouches inside the case. The earpieces are bright polished stainless and susceptible to scratches so this is a nice touch. Under the soft case, a cardboard flap hides the rest of the accessories. Campfire Audio Marshmallow tips (S, M & L), silicone tips (S, M & L), SpinFit tips (XS, S, M & L), cleaning tool, Campfire Audio pin, warranty card and the instruction manual all rest under the flap..\n\nBuild\n\nThe Comet is a stunning IEM for sure. Solid stainless steel made of three assemblies. The nose is the first assembly and even the screen at the front of the nozzle is machined stainless rather than an insert.\n\nThe main body is the second assembly and unlike most shells which present a left and right assembly, the Comet is assembled from the front and rear with the third assembly sealing the back of the unit. Seams are visible but no gaps were present and the polish on all components was first rate. The comet is smaller than average and fits fairly deeply.\n\nI also found that quite a bit of tip rolling is needed to find what fits you best. The cable is a 4 stranded copper litz and is first quality as well. The only negatives on the cable are the chin slider is worthless as it is blocked by the controls and thus cannot be moved to a position where it is relevant.\n\nThe controls are small and lightweight and worked equally well on my HTC m9 and IPhone 6+.\n\nTermination is a 3.5mm TRRS at a 90 degree angle and is nicely done as well.\n\nI wish they would offer these with the tinsel cable as an option as I am not a fan of on-cable controls and quickly swapped the cable for that reason. The mmcx terminations have either a printed L or R as well as a blue or red dot on them to identify left and right. The earphone itself is not marked and since the two sides are exactly the same shape, no such marking is needed.\n\nSound\n\nThe first thing to make note of is that the Comet is higher impedance at 48 Ohms @ 1kHz and lower sensitivity at 97 dB SPL/mW than most of its competition. For this reason, it will likely require more power to drive them to the same listening level you are used to from other in-ears.\n\nThe second thing to note is that the sound quality is very dependent on the tips used and the seal in your ear. I had originally thought the Comet was somewhat dark, this only holds true if using the foam tips that come pre-installed. I quickly worked through the tips that came with the Comet and settled on the largest of the spin-fit (A size larger than I normally wear) as they gave the best seal and held the Comet the steadiest in my ear. Wearing the Comet tip down, they are heavy enough to want to pull slightly and break the seal during exercise so I used the larger than normal tips to offset this tendency.\n\nOnce any fitment issues are worked through, the user is rewarded with a very good sounding in-ear.\n\nLows\n\nThe Comet has some of the traits I expected from a Balanced Armature and a few that were surprises. In the category of expected, the bass has good fast attack and decay which leads to a very articulate sound. On the unexpected side, extension gives good depth and ample sub-bass. While certainly not a basshead iem, they do not suffer from the lack of extension so commonly seen in single BA designs. Mid-bass is well controlled with very slight bleed into the lower mids and adequate authority to produce a good hit when called upon. Overall, very clean lows with a good realistic timbre and quick clean sound.\n\nMids\n\nHere again, some expected, and a few surprises. Surprises first this time. Detail is better than expected with really clean tone. Body is large and thick without getting muddy or sloppy. I expected the clean nature but not so much the thickness to the tone or the combination clean and thick. The lower mids produce a natural sounding guitar tone as well as good lower register vocals. Higher mids are definitely a bit forward and upper register vocals are engaging while still maintaining the same clean nature of the rest of the sound signature.\n\nTreble\n\nI didn’t find many surprises here. Extension is moderately good but not exceptional. True to every Campfire product I have heard, the treble is a bit laid back and avoids any sense of being aggressive or harsh while still managing to convey the overall signature as slightly bright. It is a strange dichotomy in that the treble does not seem particularly well extended, but still manages a good amount of air and sparkle that makes cymbals come off as less metallic and more musical. For those with previous experience with campfire, you’ll find a certain familiarity in the tuning of the Comet for sure.\n\nStage and Imaging\n\nThe soundstage presented is wider than deep and again presents kind of an odd thing to describe. It manages at the same time to be intimate without feeling closed off which is a rare trait in my experience. Imaging is extremely good with each instrument and vocal being easily identified and placed on the stage. Layering is better than expected and separates the Comet from the likes of the Brainwavz b150 or the Etymotics 4p. If there is a drawback to the Comet, it is that exceptionally busy passages can overwhelm it a bit and it loses ground to some of the multi-driver iems at around the same price point.\n\nComparisons\n\nComet vs Magaosi K5\n\nWhile hardly a fair comparison, the Magaosi K5 and the Campfire Comet share nearly exactly the same price point so inevitably will draw comparisons. The K5 is a 5 BA design and as such has more reach at both ends than the Comet. The K5 is one of the most sensitive iems I have ever used and will run well from low powered sources while the Comet needs either a high powered source or an additional amp to do its best work. The comet is much more intimate while the K5 feels more like sitting 10 rows back from the orchestra in the main hall. Both share the typical high speed attack and decay typical of BA arrangements but the Comet is a whisp clearer in the overall. Detail retrieval is better on the k5 but not by the margin one would expect in a 5 vs 1 fight. The Comet scales better than the K5 as the K5 tends to pick up a bit of hiss as power increases that keeps it from being able to take advantage of additional power. Overall two very different animals, the Comet is big and bold and intimate while the K5 is near neutral, a bit shy and reserved in comparison.\n\nComet vs B400\n\nAgain, the comparison of the Brainwavz B400 to the Comet is more due to similar price than similar features. (Later notes vs the B150 are much closer to same features). The b400 is a quad BA design vs the single vented BA of the Comet. Perhaps oddly, the comet manages to have slightly better extension than the b400 at both ends of the spectrum. While the Comet may go slightly lower, the b400 hits with more authority as it has a bit more sub-bass quantity than the Comet. The b400 has a bit more bass than the Comet, but the Comet has a bit cleaner bass than the b400. Again, mids are fuller on the b400 which results in vocals being better textured and timbre being a bit more realistic on the b400 than the Comet. The boost of the upper mids on the Comet give high register vocals a bit more intimacy than the b400. Treble is similar on both units with plenty of sparkle to both. The Comet is a shallow U shape while the b400 has a more neutral signature. Soundstage on the b400 is similar to the Comet as both are wider than deep and height seems to be about the same. I have a hard time picking one over the other in this regard as it seems to be somewhat source dependent and they tend to leapfrog each other.\n\nComet vs LZ A4\n\nAnother lopsided comparison to be sure, the Comet and LZ a4 have little in common other than price. I used the Black rear and red front filter on the A4 as this is my preferred tuning. The Comet is definitely warmer and thicker sounding than the A4 while the a4 has a bit better extension at either end. Extension is only slightly better at the top end but is more noticeable at the low end of the spectrum. The layering and detail are close although the A4's treble extension makes it seem more detailed than the Comet's warmer signature. Soundstage is deeper on the A4 as well as having some extra height when compared to the Comet. Attack and Decay (especially in the bass/mids) are enough better on the Comet to be noticeable. Overall, the two have very distinct tunings and the Comet delivers a thicker, fuller sound while the A4 digs a bit of extra detail out at the expense of body in the mids.\n\nComet vs B150\n\nThe B150 and Comet is as close to a fair fight as the matchups go. Both boutique vendors, both single BA offerings, and both with their share of fans. Low end extension is slightly better on the b150 but the Comet is cleaner. The comparison vs the b400 has flipped and now the Comet is the warmer/thicker of the two when comparing mids vs the b150. Where the b400 makes the Comet look u shaped, the Comet makes the b150 look like the mids (particularly the lower mids) are recessed. For guitar rock the extra energy the Comet brings to the mids produces a very natural tonality. For classical piano, the b150 does a better job of producing the timbre of a baby grand. Layering is better on the Comet with instrument positioning being a bit cleaner than the b150 while the soundstage is larger and more evenly shaped on the b150. This one comes down to personal preference but I wont be selling either of mine anytime soon.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nI will admit my bias right up front. I like the Campfire house sound. That thick bodied, intimate, make you feel like the singer is singing directly to you kind of feeling is exactly what I want when listening for pleasure. The real question for me was could Campfire maintain that house sound using only a single BA to do it and within a $200 price point without sacrificing too much of what made the more expensive models truly great listens. I was a bit concerned that this might be the Mercedes 190 or the Cadillac Caterra of the Campfire line (AKA a Campfire in name only but not really deserving of the name). I am happy to say that my money was well spent and the Comet is every bit a Campfire. For those who haven’t tried Campfire yet due to price, this is your chance. For those who want an earphone they can take out in the woods and not risk their $1800 flagship, this provides a very listenable alternative at a price point that won’t result in nearly the level of distress that a lost u18 might. I think the Comet may well become the best-selling Campfire model to date and I know Ken is having trouble keeping up with demand now. My advice to Ken; “Don’t plan on that slacking up anytime soon”. They called it Comet, but in reality, it is a star.\n\nAttachments\n\ncomet1.jpg\n\ncomet2.jpg\n\ncometcase.jpg\n\ncometcontents.jpg\n\ncometjack2.jpg\n\nPros: Quick Bass Presentation, Exciting Midrange, Airy treble, Build Quality\n\nCons: Midrange can be fuller\n\nIntroduction\n\nCampfire Audio is a company based in Portland, Oregon and they specialize in making in-ear monitors (IEMs), headphones and cables.
