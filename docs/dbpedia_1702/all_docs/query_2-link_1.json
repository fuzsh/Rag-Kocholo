        "text": "Hello again, and welcome to the series of articles where I torture myself for literally no reason. But I think those are called Worst to Bests, and this month, my captors are Weezer. Oh boy. I’m in for some shit. The discography of Weezer is notoriously polarizing, and I’d be lying if I said I was 100% looking forward to it. But there’s always surprises in infamous discographies. I mean, Def Leppard had some hilariously bad albums. But I guess saying I’m looking forward to a discography just to hear how laughably bad it is isn’t a great way to encourage someone to listen to the band. But let’s be honest, they’re Weezer, I don’t need to encourage you to listen to them. Even if I do, nobody will. Alright, let’s get into it.\n\n#15. Weezer\n\nAt #15, I have their 12th studio album, their self-titled studio album, released in 2019. A covers album. Hooray. The album opens with a cover of Toto’s Africa, which is really bad, but sometimes it can make me laugh. Enjoy feeling something while it lasts. The album continues with a cover of Tears for Fears’ Everybody Wants to Rule the World, which is nothing. Just a soulless cover. That sentence basically sums up the whole album, though. The cover of Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) is pretty much identical to the original. This is not funny. This is pointless. This song sucks. The cover of a-Ha’s Take On Me is almost identical, but slightly lower-pitched. It’s also nothing. The cover of the Turtles’ Happy Together is so dumb. The cover of Black Sabbath’s Paranoid – yes, Weezer covered Paranoid – is about as dumb as you’d expect. The cover of ELO’s Mr. Blue Sky is so annoying. Fuck it, this whole album is annoying. The cover of TLC’s No Scrubs is awful. The ninth song is the cover of Billie Jean, which is so bad that I actually couldn’t finish it. And the album closes with a cover of Ben E. King’s Stand By Me, which is shit. Teal is really awful. Legitimately one of the worst albums I’ve ever heard. Never listen to this shit. I hate it more than I hate Raditude, that should say something.\n\n#14. Raditude\n\nAt #14, I have their 7th studio album, Raditude, released in 2009. Oh boy. The album opens with (If You’re Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To, which is kind of OK. It’s by far the best on the album. The album continues with I’m Your Daddy, which is really bad. The Girl Got Hot is pretty dumb. Can’t Stop Partying is one of the most infamous Weezer songs ever made. Its only competition is Beverly Hills. That may be a worse song, but the execution on this one is worse. Put Me Back Together is pretty dumb. Tripping Down the Freeway is awful. Love Is the Answer is uninspired. Let It All Hang Out sucks. The ninth song is In the Mall, which is bad. And the album closes with I Don’t Want To Let You Go. Womp womp. Raditude is pretty unanimously agreed to be the worst Weezer album, and the fact that those claims aren’t true (no thanks to Teal) is shocking. This album is really terrible. Oh well, good thing I never have to listen to it again, and you shouldn’t either. However, though, nice doggy.\n\n#13. Pacific Daydream\n\nAt #13, I have their 11th studio album, Pacific Daydream, released in 2017. The album opens with Mexican Fender, which I kind of love. The album continues with Beach Boys, which isn’t that great. At some points, it sounds like a bad version of Ween’s Transdermal Celebration. Feels Like Summer is awful. This one actually deserves the hate. Happy Hour is also pretty bad. Weekend Woman is pretty dumb. QB Blitz is awful. Sweet Mary is pretty bad. Get Right is stupid. The ninth song is La Mancha Screwjob, which I hate. And the album closes with Any Friend of Diane’s, which is really dumb. What the hell is this song? Pacific Daydream is horrible. Going from their previous album to this one is a rude awakening. Weezer just couldn’t stay good. This thing is really hard to listen to, and it’s pretty much equally as bad as Raditude and Teal. Good-ass album cover, however. That’s the one thing putting it above Teal for me.\n\n#12. Make Believe\n\nAt #12, I have their 5th studio album, Make Believe, released in 2005. The album opens with Beverly Hills. Oh god. This song is… awful. It’s basically the thing giving this album such a bad reputation. Well, besides a certain 0.4/10 from Pitchfork, but this song supersedes that. I want to explain why this album is so bad, but Mic the Snare did a pretty good job at it in his Weezer video, so watch that. The album continues with Perfect Situation, which is an improvement, thank god. But it still isn’t great. This is Such a Pity is pretty bad. Hold Me is simulatenously nice but annoying. I don’t know how to feel about it. Peace is bad. We Are All on Drugs is annoying. It keeps repeating the phrase “‘Cause you’re on drugs”, or “When you’re on drugs”, something like that. That’s pretty funny, but this song expects me to take it seriously and it’s just stupid. The Damage in Your Heart is boring. Pardon Me is pretty dumb. The ninth song is My Best Friend, a forgettable one. The Other Way is mid. The penultimate song on the album is Freak Me Out, an almost OK song. And the album finally closes with Haunt You Every Day, which sucks. This album is so bad that Pitchfork gave it a 0.4/10. That’s equivalent to a 4/100 on albumoftheyear.org. And well it’s probably not that bad, realistically, I’d still give it a similar score. I really dislike Make Believe. It’s strange the drop in quality this band experienced after making 4 albums I enjoy in a row. This is when Weezer got bad, fight me.\n\n#11. Weezer\n\nAt #11, I have their 13th studio album, their 2nd self-titled studio album that was released in 2019. Kinda weird. I don’t know if you guys noticed, but these guys have a lot of albums with the same name – Weezer. I think I’m onto something. The album opens with Can’t Knock the Hustle, which I like. Fight me. The album continues with Zombie Bastards, which I don’t like. High as a Kite is also bad. Living in L.A. is a dumb pop song. Piece of Cake is bad. I’m Just Being Honest is formulaic and dumb. Too Many Thoughts in my Head is awful. The Prince Who Wanted Everything tries to be fun, but it isn’t. The ninth song is Byzantine, which is really dumb. And the album closes with California Snow, which is awful. Black is not great. It’s not as bad as the albums behind it on this list, but it’s not fun. It all sounds like music to an Illumination movie.\n\n#10. Van Weezer\n\nAt #10, I have their 15th and as of right now most recent studio album, Van Weezer, released in 2021. The album opens with Hero, which is really bad, but I sort of get a kick out of it. The album continues with All the Good Ones, which I also sort of get a kick out of, despite the badness. The End of the Game is bad, but I don’t really enjoy this one. I Need Some of That is so dumb, but I love it. Beginning of the End is bad. Blue Dream is funny. 1 More Hit. The hook. Need I say more? This song is ridiculously bad. Sheila Can Do It is pretty fun. The ninth song is She Needs Me, which is funny. And the album closes with Precious Metal Girl, which is ridiculous. But it’s a masterpiece. Van Weezer is… odd. I know it’s bad, but I sort of get a kick out of it. The songwriting is ridiculous, the album cover is ridiculous, it’s amazing. But I know it’s bad, so I can’t place it too high.\n\n#9. Weezer\n\nAt #9, I have their 3rd studio album, their self-titled studio album, released in 2001. The album opens with Don’t Let Go, and I don’t know if this is a hot take or not, but this is one of my favorite Weezer songs. I’ve always loved this one a lot. The album continues with Photograph, another one I love. Hash Pipe is alright, I guess. Island in the Sun is nice. I love this one quite a bit. Crab is not great. I don’t like it too much. Knockdown Dragout is OK. Smile is alright. Simple Pages is one I really like. The ninth song is Glorious Day, which is alright. And the album closes with O Girlfriend, which I like. The Green Album was an album made after a 7-year hiatus, and it shows the band returning back to their early roots. That’s good if you didn’t like Pinkerton at the time, but everyone likes that album now. And this album is fun enough, it has some good stuff. I used to not like this album for feeling like it has no important place in the band’s discography, but I don’t really care about that anymore, sometimes I just want to have fun after hearing traumatic therapy sessions. All this being said, the album cover is stupid, the album is more standardized than I’d like it to be, and the songs can be either really great or really forgettable, so I’m holding it back a little for those issues.\n\n#8. Weezer\n\nAt #8, I have their 6th studio album, their self-titled studio album, released in 2008. The album opens with Troublemaker, which I like. Leave me alone. The album continues with The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn), which I do not like as much. Pork and Beans is OK. Heart Songs is pretty great. Everybody Get Dangerous is lyrically a little odd, but it’s pretty funny. I like it. Dreamin’ is excellent. Thought I Knew is also excellent. Cold Dark World is pretty great. The ninth song is Automatic, which is really good. And the album closes with The Angel and the One, which is alright. The Red Album is very hit-or-miss. It features some pretty amazing songs, but also some pretty forgettable songs. I don’t know how to feel about it, but I guess it’s alright.\n\n#7. OK Human\n\nAt #7, I have their 14th studio album, OK Human, released in 2021. The album opens with All My Favorite Songs, which is pretty good. The album continues with Aloo Gobi, which is pretty great. Grapes of Wrath is fun. Numbers is pretty great. Playing My Piano is kind of dumb, but it’s alright. Mirror Image is alright. Screens is pretty great. Bird With a Broken Wing is amazing. The ninth song is Dead Roses, which is alright. Everything Happens for a Reason is brief, but alright. The penultimate song on the album is Here Comes the Rain, which is pretty great. And the album closes with La Brea Tar Pits, which is OK, human. OK Human is considered one of Weezer’s best albums, a “deep” experience. It’s not deep, it’s just kind of fun. I think it tends to be overrated as hell, but it isn’t bad.\n\n#6. Hurley\n\nAt #6, I have their 8th studio album, Hurley, released in 2010. The album opens with Memories, which is a really amazing song. The album continues with Ruling Me, which I also think is pretty great. Trainwrecks is great. Unspoken is awesome. Where’s My Sex is pretty good. Run Away is excellent. Hang On is just great. I really love this one. Smart Girls is also pretty great. The ninth song is Brave New World, which I love a lot. And the album closes with Time Flies, which I really like. I actually think Hurley is pretty great. Compared to its predecessor (Raditude), it’s a masterpiece. I might actually relisten to it again, I like it a lot.\n\n#5. Everything Will Be Alright in the End\n\nAt #5, I have their 9th studio album, Everything Will Be Alright in the End, released in 2014. The album opens with Ain’t Got Nobody, which is a pretty excellent opener. The album continues with Back to the Shack, another excellent one. Eulogy for a Rock Band is pretty amazing. Lonely Girl is a classic. I’ve Had It Up to Here is pretty great. The British Are Coming is also pretty great. Da Vinci is really good. Go Away is amazing. The ninth song is Cleopatra, which is really good. Foolish Father is another classic. And the album closes with the Futurescope trilogy. Part I is The Waste Land, which is pretty amazing. Part II is Anonymous, another pretty great one. And Part III is Return to Ithaka, a pretty great conclusion. Everything Will Be Alright in the End is a pretty great album. It’s got a positive reception for a good reason. I will definitely be relistening to this album again soon.\n\n#4. Maladroit\n\nAt #4, I have their 4th studio album, Maladroit, released in 2002. The album opens with American Gigolo, a classic. The album continues with Dope Nose, which is another classic. Keep Fishin’ is pretty great. Take Control is really good. Death and Destruction is also really good. Slob is great. Burndt Jamb is vaguely Muse-y to me. I like this one in spite of that. Space Rock… rocks. I wish it were longer. The ninth song is Slave, which I love. Fall Together is really good. Possibilities is great. The penultimate song on the album is Love Explosion, a really nice one that I love a lot. And the album closes with December, another really nice one that I love a lot. Maladroit is either Weezer’s most underrated album or a properly rated one. Every single person says this is underrated, so I’m guessing it’s the latter. It’s a surprisingly good album for the band, I really enjoy it. It’s not as poppy as The Green Album, but I think it has better pop songs, if that makes sense. Yeah, Maladroit is great.\n\n#3. Weezer\n\nAt #3, I have their 10th studio album, their self-titled studio album, released in 2016. The album opens with California Kids, which is a classic. The album continues with Wind in Our Sail, another classic. Thank God for Girls is really great. (Girl We Got A) Good Thing is really fun. Do You Wanna Get High is great. King of the World is a classic. Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori is amazing. LA Girlz is a classic. The ninth song is Jacked Up, which is really great. And the album closes with Endless Bummer, which is a classic. Weezer’s White Album is a modern classic. Yeah, I mean it. Every song here is pretty great, and it’s only, like, a click below the top 2. It’s great, listen to it if you haven’t.\n\n#2. Pinkerton\n\nAt #2, I have their 2nd studio album, Pinkerton, released in 1996. The album opens with Tired of Sex. A funny comment I read once was “Rivers Cuomo writing a song called Tired of Sex is like Stevie Wonder writing a song called Tired of Being Able to See.” It was a funny comment, I can’t remember where I found it. Anyway, this song is pretty awesome. The album continues with Getchoo, another awesome one. No Other One is basically a depressing version of No One Else. I like it a lot. Why Bother? is amazing. Across the Sea is one of my favorite Weezer songs, even if some people think it’s weird. I love this one a lot. The Good Life is pretty excellent. El Scorcho is one of the odd ones on the album. Just listen to the opening lyric and tell me this song won’t be wild. But it’s actually not only my favorite song on the album, but my favorite Weezer song in general. I love everything about this one. Pink Triangle is amazing. It’s about a guy who falls in love with a lesbian. Poor him. The ninth song is Falling for You, which is excellent. And the album closes with Butterfly, a very pretty one. Pinkerton is pretty great. It’s rough, abrasive and therapeutic. There’s a big debate over which is the better one of their first two albums. My answer is – they’re both great, albeit for very different reasons. Whichever one you personally enjoy more is OK. And while sometimes I debate which one I prefer, I’m pretty satisfied with my list right now.\n\n#1. Weezer\n\nAt #1, I have their self-titled debut studio album, released in 1994. The album opens with My Name is Jonas, a song I absolutely love. It’s a classic for a reason. The album continues with No One Else, which is pretty funny. I like it a lot. It’s made even funnier by the next song, The World Has Turned and Left Me Here, a song about a guy whose girlfriend left him. I love this song a lot. Buddy Holly has been memed so hard that I’m pretty sure it’s impossible to listen to this song seriously. Like, just listen to the opening lyric, the guitar lick, the chorus. It’s probably the goofiest Weezer song. That’s why it’s amazing. Undone – The Sweater Song is pretty amazing. Obviously, it has a pretty sick metaphor. Surf Wax America is sick. I love this one, everyone does. Say It Ain’t So is excellent. In the Garage is wonderfully dorky. The subject matter is something I’m pretty sure everyone can relate to in some way, which is nice. The ninth song is Holiday, which is a really fun one. And the album closes with Only in Dreams, a song that turns asking a girl out into the most epic thing in the world. Honestly, I don’t care if it’s pretentious. This song is pretty sick. The Blue Album is a 90s classic, but I don’t think it’s supposed to be. Like, listen to this album. It’s nerdy as hell. I didn’t think I was ready to admit it, but I’m just gonna do it – this is one of my favorite albums. Every song is a hit for me, and since this is the ultimate virgin album, I pretty much have to love this album.\n\nTop 10 Favorite Weezer Songs\n\n10. Don’t Let Go\n\n9. In the Garage\n\n8. Buddy Holly\n\n7. Tired of Sex\n\n6. Say It Ain’t So\n\n5. Undone – The Sweater Song\n\n4. Across the Sea\n\n3. My Name is Jonas\n\n2. Surf Wax America\n\nHonorable Mentions: Only in Dreams, Holiday, Getchoo, California Kids, The World Has Turned and Left Me Here, Jacked Up, Pink Triangle, No One Else, No Other One, The Good Life\n\n1. El Scorcho\n\nConclusion\n\nI know. I have a really diverse top 10 and some really diverse honorable mentions. But that’s what happens when you make two albums and then spend your entire career living under their shadow. Anyway, that was Weezer. I’m pretty sure the second sentence of this paragraph sums up my experience with them. They’ve got some great stuff, some truly awful stuff, and some forgettable stuff. And most of it is not great. I had heard maybe 3 Weezer albums before this list, and I was not expecting to hate an album on here more than I hate Raditude, the infamously, legendarily bad Weezer album. Good job to Teal, I guess. Possibly bottom 5 of all time material, at least for me. I think Rivers’ vocals kind of hold this band back for me, but that’s just me. They sound too cheesy for me. But they’ve still made great stuff, albeit mixed in with a lot of bad stuff. Thanks for reading, if you did. Have a happy Easter, if you celebrate.\n\nFebruary. One of my least favorite months of the year. God, it’s boring. So, to make this boring month a little more fun, I’ll be ranking a very loud, rockin’ and energetic discography – actually, I’ll be ranking two. The discography of the legendary Stooges, and the solo discography of their frontman, Iggy Pop. Let’s do this. The Stooges are considered one of the greatest and most influential rock bands of all time, and Iggy Pop is considered one of the greatest and most influential frontmen in rock history. The band’s discography is 60% made up of albums considered some of the greatest ever made, and Iggy’s discography… wasn’t blessed with as high a percentage, but it’s still legendary. I love the Stooges. There isn’t really any other band I’ve heard quite like the Stooges. And there’s no other frontman quite like Iggy. I also love Iggy. To make this month fun, this is my ranking of the discographies of Iggy Pop & the Stooges combined, the same way I combined Lou Reed & the Velvet Underground. Let’s get into the list.\n\n#25. Instinct\n\nAt #25, I have Iggy Pop’s 8th studio album, Instinct, released in 1988. The album opens with Cold Metal, which is terrible. Promising start. The album continues with High on You, which I also hate. Strong Girl is pretty bad. Tom Tom is forgettable, but it’s not very good. Easy Rider has some pretty cool guitar (thank you, Steve Jones) but that’s its saving grace for sure. Power & Freedom sucks. Very generic. Lowdown is pretty stupid. The title track has some cool guitar playing again, but then the vocals come in and I hate this song. The ninth song is Tuff Baby, which is really stupid as expected. And the album closes with Squarehead, which is really bad. After (spoiler alert) enjoying Iggy’s last album, I was reminded of why this was such a bad decade for the guy. Instinct is awful. Like, really awful. It’s pretty much unlistenable. Not a great start to the list. And it doesn’t get much better for a while.\n\n#24. The Weirdness\n\nAt #24, I have the Stooges’ unfortunate 4th studio album, The Weirdness, released in 2007. The album opens with Trollin’, and as soon as this song starts… you know you’re in for some shit. This song has to be trolling. There’s no way these guys made so many great songs and then… this. The album continues with You Can’t Have Friends, which is a direct message to any fans of this album. This song also sucks. The lyrics are embarrassing, the guitar is very formulaic, and these guys made 1970. ATM is awful. My Idea of Fun is so stupid, man. I wish I could explain how dumb a lyric “My idea of fun is killing everyone.” OK, yeah, we get it, Iggy is a punk legend. I’m pretty sure the lyrics that made him a punk legend weren’t that dumb. Where “I’m a streetwalking cheetah with a heart full of napalm” works, this one doesn’t. Fuck this song. The title track is really bad. Free & Freaky is also really bad. Greedy Awful People is stupid. It has a 7 on albumoftheyear.org. So sad. She Took My Money has annoying vocals. I love Iggy’s vocals, or I have before, but this song is bad. The ninth song is The End of Christianity, a needlessly edgy song. It’s not good. Mexican Guy is dumb. The penultimate song on the album is Passing Cloud, which is also dumb. And the album closes with I’m Fried, which yeah. That’s a way to describe how I feel now. So yeah, I don’t like this album. The Stooges went from a band with a strong vibe – whether you liked them or not, you gotta admit there isn’t really any other album that sounds like Fun House or Raw Power – to embarrassingly generic with this album. The reason this album isn’t dead last is because it may be generic, and on the below average side of generic, but it’s a change from the garbage I’ve been listening to. Also, it’s under an hour long, so +respect 1. Anyway, this album is a legacy sequel in music form – sounds good, comes way too late, completely unnecessary and filled with bad writing and strange production choices.\n\n#23. Avenue B\n\nAt #23, I have Iggy Pop’s 12th studio album, Avenue B, released in 1999. The album opens with No Shit, and don’t ask me why it’s called that. It’s not a hard rocker, it’s basically Iggy monologuing through spoken word. It’s cool for that, but I don’t care for it. Maybe that’s because the opening lyric is about how Iggy feels old and alone. That’s one thing you want to hear from the nuclear ape. The album continues with Nazi Girlfriend, which I thought would be insane. But it isn’t, it’s more spoken word. The title track finally shows us a hint of singing. The only problem is I don’t like it that much. Miss Argentina is like… OK? Good for him, he has the hots for Miss Argentina, but he also hates her. Afraid to Get Close is nothing. Shakin’ All Over is stupid. Long Distance is bad. Corruption is dumb. The ninth song is She Calls Me Daddy, which is unfortunately another one of his monologues. I hate this one. I Felt the Luxury is weird. Español is so stupid it actually hurts. Why is his pronunciation so bad? The penultimate song on the album is Motorcycle, an OK song. And the album closes with Facade, a bad one. Avenue B is one of the most uninteresting albums I’ve heard in a while. The thing that hurts about this one is that I’m so far into Iggy’s discography, about halfway through, and it’s getting harder for me to remember when he put out great album after great album. That’s sad. I don’t like Avenue B at all, and the more I think about it, I like it even less. It was legitimately harder to get through than most albums I put below it.\n\n#22. Party\n\nAt #22, I have Iggy Pop’s 5th studio album, Party, released in 1981. The album opens with Pleasure, which I enjoy. The album continues with Rock and Roll Party, a song I don’t enjoy. Eggs on Plate is forgettable. Sincerity is boring. Houston is Hot Tonight is bad. Pumpin’ for Jill is bad. Happy Man is strange, and pretty terrible. Bang Bang is bad. The ninth song is Sea of Love, which kind of reminds me of the Who’s Helpless Dancer in the beginning. But Helpless Dancer is good. This song is bad. Like, it’s really bad. And the album closes with Time Won’t Let Me, a sort of OK song. There’s a really strange moment in the end when the song is fading out, and for a split second it gets really loud. The fuck is up with that? Anyway, Party is bizarre. It’s almost a selling-out album for Iggy, but this album performed terribly critically and commercially. And it’s not hard to see why, this album is pretty bad. This album’s pretty much been disowned by Iggy, and that’s OK. I never need to listen to this again.\n\n#21. Skull Ring\n\nAt #21, I have Iggy Pop’s 14th studio album, Skull Ring, released in 2003. This is the one where every single song has a feature. The album opens with Little Electric Chair, featuring the Stooges. That’s a surprise. It’s been 30 years since they last played together on an album, and I guess I shouldn’t be surprised considering Iggy’s track record for sucking that this song isn’t very good. How disappointing. The album continues with Perverts in the Sun, featuring the Trolls, and it sucks. The title track, featuring the Stooges again, isn’t that good. Superbabe (ah shit), featuring the Trolls, is OK. Loser, featuring the Stooges, is also OK. Private Hell, featuring Green Day, sucks. Little Know It All, featuring Sum 41, is OK. Whatever, featuring the Trolls, has a fitting title. The ninth song is Dead Rock Star, featuring the Stooges. It seems like Iggy’s being self-aware of his entire career post-Lust for Life. Ooh, I’m sorry, was that harsh? Sorry, I’ve just listened to a lot of shit and my perception of Iggy is changing into something I wish it weren’t. Anyway, this actual song is OK. Rock Show, featuring Peaches, is god-awful. This is so bad it’s scary. Here Comes the Summer, featuring the Trolls, is a little better. It’s still not great. Motor Inn, featuring Peaches and Freedom, sucks hard. I guess I hate Peaches now. Inferiority Complex, featuring the Trolls, sucks too. Supermarket, featuring Green Day, is really bad. Til Wrong Feels Right, the only song without a feature, is OK. At best. The penultimate song on the album is Blood on Your Cool, featuring the Trolls, which is mildly enjoyable. And the album closes with a hidden track, Nervous Exhaustion, also featuring the Trolls. It sucks. Somehow, against all odds (note the sarcasm), Skull Ring is an absolute mess. It’s bad. Really bad. This album is relentless and unforgiving. I need a break, but instead I get the exact opposite, as The Weirdness is next in his discography. Whoop-dee-doo.\n\n#20. Préliminaires\n\nAt #20, I have Iggy Pop’s 15th studio album, Préliminaires, released in 2009. It may seem like Iggy took a 6-year-hiatus, but he did something far more unforgivable than that – he made The Weirdness since his previous solo effort. Anyway, the album opens with Les feuilles mortes (Google translation: Dead leaves), which isn’t that good. The album continues with I Want to Go to the Beach, which also isn’t that good. King of the Dogs is pretty dumb. I kind of like it a little. Je sais que tu sais isn’t great. Spanish Coast is forgettable. Nice to be Dead sucks. How Insensitive is OK. Party Time is pretty dumb. The ninth song is He’s Dead, She’s Alive, which is goofy. I like it enough. A Machine for Loving is pretty good. The penultimate song on the album is She’s a Business, which I don’t like. And the album closes with Les feuilles mortes – Marc’s Theme, which I’m convinced is just the same song with one small change. That’s pretty pretentious. I want to like Préliminaires, I really do. It’s different than what I’ve heard in a while, but maybe that’s part of my problem. It feels like he’s trying too hard to be different. I don’t think Iggy’s nature fits this kind of album. And the music isn’t very good. I’m sorry, I guess I just don’t like this one. But it gets points for not being an hour and 12 minutes.\n\n#19. Soldier\n\nAt #19, I have Iggy Pop’s 4th studio album, Soldier, released in 1980. The album opens with Loco Mosquito, which I love. The album continues with Ambition, a very Iggy song. I like it just fine, it’s nothing special. Knocking ‘Em Down (In the City) rocks. Play it Safe is OK. Some of it sounds vaguely similar to We Are the Clash, so take that for what you will. Get Up & Get Out is also OK. Mr. Dynamite has some kind of bad production, and the actual song is just alright. Dog Food is pretty awesome. I Need More is pretty boring. It’s one of the worst Iggy songs up to this point in his catalogue, maybe even the worst. The ninth song is Take Care of Me, which is pretty good. The penultimate song on the album is I’m a Conservative, a subtle song. It’s OK. And the album closes with I Snub You, one that reminds me of 80s Ramones. I don’t know why this keeps happening. Soldier is considered a not very good album. Honestly, it isn’t as terrible as most people say. But it isn’t great as some say. It’s just kind of there. It goes in through one ear and out the other.\n\n#18. Naughty Little Doggie\n\nAt #18, I have Iggy Pop’s 11th studio album, Naughty Little Doggie, released in 1996. The album opens with I Wanna Live, a kind of dumb opener. The album continues with Pussy Walk, one of those needlessly vulgar ones. I don’t like it that much. Innocent World is cool, I guess. But it’s dumb. Knucklehead is pretty good. To Belong is pretty dumb. Keep On Believing is OK. Outta My Head is really good. Shoeshine Girl, a boring one. The ninth song is Heart is Saved, a pretty good one. And the album closes with Look Away, and I can see why it got removed from Spotify. This song is really scary. That’s why I feel weird saying I love the way it sounds. I love this song instrumentally, but lyrically this song is awful. Naughty Little Doggie is… nothing. Quite literally nothing. I can’t remember anything about it, other than just how wild Look Away is. It’s shorter than its predecessors, so that’s good, I guess. But those albums ranked higher, so I guess it’s not that good.\n\n#17. Beat ‘Em Up\n\nAt #17, I have Iggy Pop’s 13th studio album, Beat ‘Em Up, released in 2001. The album opens with Mask, which I actually kind of like. The album continues with L.O.S.T., a pretty OK one. Howl is really dumb. Football is pretty good. Savior is boring. The title track is very aggressive. I love it. Talking Snake is OK. The Jerk is pretty funny. I love it. The ninth song is Death is Certain, which is pretty good. Go For the Throat is kind of bad. Weasels is whatever. Drink New Blood is bad. It’s All Shit is another whatever one. Ugliness is actually really good. The penultimate song on the album is V.I.P. At this point in his career, I should just be glad it doesn’t stand for “Very Important Pussy.” But I doubt that would be much worse than the actual song, which is really bad. And the album closes with a hidden track, Sterility, which isn’t that good. The world thought Iggy went soft with his previous album, Avenue B, so he made Beat ‘Em Up, the most metal collection of metal he could possibly make. Honestly, it’s a pretty mixed bag. There’s stuff on here I love, stuff on here I’m mixed about, and stuff on here I hate. Also, look at that album cover. It’s lurid. I don’t know where to put it, so here is good enough, I guess.\n\n#16. New Values\n\nAt #16, I have Iggy Pop’s real 3rd studio album, New Values, released in 1979. The album opens with Tell Me a Story, which is pretty cool. The album continues with the title track, which is OK. Girls is also just OK. I’m Bored is a fitting title, as this song is kind of boring. Don’t Look Down is pretty good. The Endless Sea is pretty cool. Five Foot One is kind of dumb, but I like it for that. How Do Ya Fix a Broken Part is pretty boring and forgettable. The ninth song is Angel, which is dumb. Curiosity is also dumb. The penultimate song is African Man, a genuinely racist song. This could be OK if the song was actually good, which I don’t really think it is. And the album closes with Billy is a Runaway, which is bad. New Values is OK. But considering the albums that Iggy’s coming off of, OK isn’t very good. And at its very worst, this album isn’t very good. It’s definitely not unlistenable, however, as we would see some genuinely unlistenable stuff later in his career. I’d even go so far as to say I much prefer it to his next two albums, Soldier and Party.\n\n#15. Every Loser\n\nAt #15, I have Iggy Pop’s 19th and most recent studio album, Every Loser, released in 2023. The album opens with Frenzy, and after his previous albums, I wasn’t expecting to have the shit beaten out of me like this. This song is OK. I gotta say, it’s impressive for a senior citizen. The album continues with Strung Out Johnny, which is kind of bad. New Atlantis is forgettable and bland. Modern Day Ripoff is OK. Morning Show is pretty good. The News For Andy is an interlude, and it’s whatever. Neo Punk is pretty sick. All the Way Down is pretty good, but also pretty bad. It’s OK. The ninth song is Comments, which is kind of bad. The penultimate song is an interlude, My Animus, and it’s whatever. And the album closes with The Regency, and it’s pretty cool. Every Loser looks like it’ll be Iggy’s last album, what with the guy 76. Let’s hope it is. I listened to this album when it came out, and I didn’t like it then either. I mean, Iggy is a legend. He’s the world’s forgotten boy, he’s the idiot, he’s a streetwalking cheetah. But his days of being that are over. Sorry. Yeah, I’m not the biggest fan of this album. Kind of disappointing.\n\n#14. Après\n\nAt #14, I have Iggy Pop’s 16th studio album, Après, released in 2012. It’s a cover album, so be scared. The album opens with Et si tu n’existais pas (Google translation: And if you did not exist), which is OK. I actually kind of like it. The album continues with La javanaise, which is great. Everybody’s Talkin’ is a cover of the Midnight Cowboy song. It’s OK. I’m Going Away Smiling is a Yoko Ono cover, oh hell no. It’s whatever. La Vie en rose is nice. Les passantes is OK. Syracuse isn’t great. What Is This Thing Called Love is OK. The ninth song is a cover of the Beatles’ Michelle. It’s a pretty identical cover. Other than the vocals, I’m convinced there’s no difference. It’s alright. And the album closes with a cover of Frank Sinatra’s Only the Lonely, and it’s pretty good. Après is a better version of its predecessor to me. It’s 26 minutes long, god that’s nice. I’ll probably not revisit this album too soon, but I enjoyed my listen to it.\n\n#13. Brick by Brick\n\nAt #13, I have Iggy Pop’s 9th studio album, Brick by Brick, released in 1990. The album opens with Home, which is actually pretty great. The album continues with Main Street Eyes, which is really nice. I Won’t Crap Out is pretty good. Candy is OK. Iggy’s vocal performance is weak, fight me. Butt Town is boring. The Undefeated is stupid. I don’t like it. Moonlight Lady is chill, I like it. Something Wild is pretty good. The ninth song is Neon Forest, which could be better but it’s too long. Starry Night is OK. Pussy Power is interesting. I think it’s alright. My Baby Wants to Rock and Roll is OK. The penultimate song on the album is the title track, which is bad. And the album closes with Livin’ On The Edge of the Night, which I like enough. A problem I face around this time in an artist’s discography is that there’s good stuff on their albums, but the albums are too damn long. That’s the problem with Brick by Brick. It goes on for a while. But that’s not to say it isn’t an overall mixed bag. It’s a post-70s Iggy album, it’s obviously not perfect. But it’s not bad. Not that bad.\n\n#12. Zombie Birdhouse\n\nAt #12, I have Iggy Pop’s 6th studio album, Zombie Birdhouse, released in 1982. The album opens with Run Like a Villain, which scared me away right from the start with its production. But the song itself is goofy. I love it. The album continues with The Villagers, which is OK. Angry Hills is pretty good. Life of Work is strange, but I really like it. The Ballad of Cookie McBride is another strange one. I like this one enough. Ordinary Bummer is chill. I love it. Eat or be Eaten is stupid, but I kind of like it. Bulldozer has a funny vocal performance. That definitely does a lot to elevate the song. The ninth song is Platonic, which is pretty cool. The Horse Song is fun. The penultimate song on the album is Watching the News, the moment in the album where Iggy gives up making sense. I don’t like this one that much. And the album closes with Street Crazies, which I like. I appreciate Zombie Birdhouse‘s descent into weirdness, but I don’t have to love the album itself. However, I do like it. It’s enjoyable – at times.\n\n#11. American Caesar\n\nAt #11, I have Iggy Pop’s 10th studio album, American Caesar, released in 1993. The album opens with Character, a nothing instrumental (sort of). The album continues with Wild America, which is kind of bad. Mixin’ the Colors is actually pretty sick. Jealousy is awesome. Hate is OK. It’s Our Love is pretty nice, albeit somewhat over-the-top. Plastic and Concrete is pretty good. Fuckin’ Alone is sick. The ninth song is Highway Song, which is awesome. Beside You is good. I don’t know how I feel about the fact that this guy also made Search and Destroy, but it’s alright. Sickness is pretty grungy. I kind of dig it. Boogie Boy is awesome. Perforation Problems is really good. Social Life is nice. It’s also sort of relatable, especially as a middle schooler. The penultimate song on the album is a cover of Louie Louie, and it’s an almost I Wanna Be Your Dog-esque cover, especially in the background. I love this song. And the album closes with Caesar, a sort of disappointing closer. But it’s goofy. Similar to Brick by Brick, American Caesar is too damn long. I enjoyed a lot of this album, but it’s kind of long. I wanna just listen to it, not make an evening out of it. But yeah, I enjoyed a lot of it.\n\n#10. Ready to Die\n\nAt #10, I have the Stooges’ 5th and hopefully last studio album, Ready to Die, released in 2013. The album opens with Burn, which is actually really cool. The album continues with Sex and Money, which is pretty great. Job is awesome. Gun is pretty cool. Unfriendly World is really good. The title track is awesome, I don’t care what anyone says. DD’s is OK. It’s overhated. Dirty Deal is really good. The ninth song is Beat That Guy, which is really cheesy, but I love it. And the album closes with The Departed, which I like a lot. Surprisingly, I actually really liked Ready to Die. It’s an improvement over The Weirdness, and actually a pretty fun listen on its own. It’s cheesy, it’s loud, it’s abrasive. I really like it. Many people may disagree with that take, though.\n\n#9. Post Pop Depression\n\nAt #9, I have Iggy Pop’s 17th studio album, Post Pop Depression, released in 2016. The album opens with Break Into your Heart, which is really good. The album continues with Gardenia, which is pretty great. American Valhalla is really cool. In The Lobby is pretty good. Sunday is sick. Vulture is really good. German Days is pretty good. The penultimate song on the album is Chocolate Drops, which is great. And the album closes with the ninth song, Paraguay. Obviously, it’s amazing. I actually really liked Post Pop Depression. It’s surprisingly good this late into his career, especially considering he’s made so much shit. I’m debating putting it even higher, but for now, it’s here.\n\n#8. Free\n\nAt #8, I have Iggy Pop’s 18th studio album, Free, released in 2019. The album opens with the title track, which has some nice sounds. Iggy’s vocals annoy me a little, though. The album continues with Loves Missing, which I love. Sonali is awesome. James Bond is really cool. Dirty Sanchez is really good. Glow in the Dark is pretty cool. Page is really good. We Are The People is pretty good. The ninth song is Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night, which like the rest of the album, is fun and meditative. And the album closes with The Dawn, which is pretty great. Free is nice. I sort of wish it were Iggy’s last album. I don’t know, it just has a sort of finality, at least in my ears. Maybe it’s the album cover (by the way, that’s a sick album cover.) And the fact that, as of right now, Every Loser is his most recent album, makes me wish it was his last one even more.\n\n#7. The Stooges\n\nAt #7, I have the Stooges’ 1969 self-titled debut studio album. The album opens with 1969, a fitting album opener. It’s a classic song and all, but also a song I’ve never completely understood all the praise for. It’s good, but it isn’t one of my favorites. On the other hand, the album continues with I Wanna Be Your Dog, an absolutely amazing rock song, one of the best ever. The sleigh bells kick ass, the vocal performance kicks ass, the guitar kicks ass. This is a perfect rock song. We Will Fall is a 10-minute cult chant and painfully obvious filler. I’ve heard somewhere it was suggested by the producer (John Cale – yes, the John Cale) as a way to fill the album out more. It’s been derided a ton, but there are some brave ones who defend it. I appreciate the fact that it’s a distillation of what the Stooges were made for – crazy, psychedelic shit. I love that, but that doesn’t mean I have to love all 10 minutes of this song. No Fun is a classic, obviously. If you haven’t heard the Sex Pistols’ version, I recommend that highly. Real Cool Time is pretty… cool, but it’s definitely filler. Ann is also filler – in fact, half of this album is filler. That’s kind of annoying. Anyway, Ann is fine, I guess. The penultimate song on the album is Not Right, an OK one. And the album closes with Little Doll, which is pretty good. The Stooges is a landmark album, specifically on the proto-punk front. It’s a classic. But I don’t really love it, especially not as much as the band’s next albums. It’s a lot of filler, and that’s painfully obvious. Even with all that filler, this album is still only 34 minutes long. I don’t not like this album, but I don’t love it is what I’m trying to say.\n\n#6. Blah-Blah-Blah\n\nAt #6, I have Iggy Pop’s 7th studio album, Blah-Blah-Blah, released in 1986. The album opens with Real Wild Child (Wild One), which is a pretty good start to the album. The album continues with Baby It Can’t Fall, which is pretty good. Shades is surprisingly long. I think it’s really good. Fire Girl is awesome. I love this one. Isolation gives me Temptation by New Order vibes sort of. That’s odd. But I like this song a lot. Like the album, it gets better as it goes on. Cry for Love is great. The title track is fun. Hideaway is really good. The ninth song is Winners and Losers, which is too long but I like it. And the album (or the CD version) closes with Little Miss Emperor, which I love. Some things happened between the release of this album and its predecessor. For one, Bowie covered an earlier song in Iggy’s career called China Girl to help Iggy out financially, and that paid off, literally. Also, Iggy did the title track to the Repo Man soundtrack, and that song kicks ass. And Bowie is back on this album. I know, shocking. And there’s a noticeable shift in tone from his previous albums to this one. However, despite the fact that the pair has made some incredible collaborations in the past, I think this album is nowhere near the incredibleness of The Idiot and Lust for Life. However, I’d go so far as to call it great. I even put it above the Stooges’ debut, that’s how much I like this album.\n\n#5. Kill City\n\nAt #5, I have Iggy Pop’s sort of 3rd studio album, Kill City, released in 1977. The album opens with the title track, a great opener. The album continues with Sell Your Love, a really cool song. Beyond the Law rocks. I Got Nothin’ is pretty incredible. Johanna is really good. Night Theme is a brief instrumental, but it’s cool. It’s followed up immediately with the exact same song – Night Theme (Reprise). I know that it’s supposed to be the beginning of another side, but listening to this on a streaming service is weird. Consolation Prizes is really cool. The ninth song is No Sense of Crime, which is really strangely pretty. The penultimate song on the album is Lucky Monkeys, which is pretty good. And the album closes with Master Charge, another pretty good one. Kill City is surprisingly good. It’s not as original or innovative as Iggy’s previous two albums, but it’s still a fun listen and one I’d recommend.\n\n#4. Lust for Life\n\nAt #4, I have Iggy’s 2nd studio album, Lust for Life, released in 1977. The album opens with the title track, which is truly an iconic song. It might be my favorite solo Iggy song, which is saying a lot. Top 3 for sure. Like many people, I first heard this song in Trainspotting. The album continues with Sixteen, a song that holds this album back for many people from being better. While I admit that it is kind of crazy to think that this is a real song, and not a fake one, a parody of a 70s rock star, I love this song. This album is supposed to be a little edgy. Even though it’s about pedophilia, it’s awesome. Some Weird Sin kicks so much ass. I don’t know how well-known it is, but I feel like it’s unfairly sort of… obscure compared to other iconic songs on this album side, but it’s really great. The Passenger is probably Iggy’s most popular song, solo or not. It’s not my favorite song on this entire list, but this is probably my favorite Iggy solo song. It’s kind of a tie between this and Lust for Life, and while it is so incredibly close, this song probably ends up taking the cake. Tonight is a Bowie-ish song, but it’s really great. Come on, there’s not really much of a chance of a Bowie song in 1977 being anything other than great. Success rocks hard, I don’t know why some people hate this song so much. Turn Blue is pretty epic. I love it. The penultimate song on the album is Neighborhood Threat, a song that reminds me strongly of (Don’t Fear) The Reaper. Like, I can’t be the only one. But I absolutely love this song. And the album closes with the ninth song, Fall In Love With Me, a song sort of similar to Sixteen, lyrically. It’s another thing that holds this album back for a lot of people. But I think it’s beautiful. Lust for Life is a classic album. As much as I like Kill City, and I really do, I think there’s a really big leap between that album and this one for me. This top 4 is all elite stuff for me. I think this is a really great album, and it’s one of my favorites. It’s pretty much tied with my number 3 spot for me, but for now, it’s here. That can really change any time, though.\n\n#3. Fun House\n\nAt #3, I have the Stooges’ 2nd studio album, Fun House, released in 1970. The album opens with Down on the Street, a song that is so dumb, so stupid, yet so visceral and fucking awesome. The album continues with Loose, another awesome, badass song. T.V. Eye is really good. Dirt is a long one, but it still kicks ass. 1970 is one of the hardest, most kickass songs I’ve ever heard. For the Stooges’ first 3 albums, there’s at least one song on each album that defines the band to its core. For the first album, it was I Wanna Be Your Dog. Here, it’s 1970. What an awesome song, it makes me feel like I can do anything. The penultimate song on the album is the title track, a really great 8-minute track and I love everything about it. And the album closes with L.A. Blues, a sort of breakdown. I love it. Fun House is a really great album. On this relisten to it, I feel like I loved it even more. Unlike with their first album, I think this album earns the praise it gets. It’s a classic album all the way.\n\n#2. The Idiot\n\nAt #2, I have Iggy’s solo debut studio album, The Idiot, released in, you guessed it, 1977. Actually, it’s not really solo, as this is basically a David Bowie album. The album opens with Sister Midnight, a fantastic opener to the album. I’ve listened to this song so many times, it’s endlessly relistenable. It’s amazing. An interesting thing about this song is that it pretty much was the beginning of the Berlin Era for Bowie (this album was recorded before Low), and it closes with Bowie’s record Lodger. That album ends with Red Money, and if you tell me that song isn’t Sister Midnight… you’re wrong, they’re almost identical. Anyway, the album continues with Nightclubbing, a very atmospheric track. I know this song from Trainspotting, obviously, which is pretty much the movie that got me into Iggy and the Stooges. Another reason it’s my favorite movie ever made. Anyway, Nightclubbing is awesome. Funtime is strange, even for Iggy. I know it from The Hunger, but that’s actually not the movie that introduced me to it, so hearing it there was a pleasant surprise. No surprise, I really love this song. Baby is dark and ominous, and somehow my least favorite song on side 1. It’s still a classic song. And China Girl is arguably my favorite song on the whole album. What a masterpiece. Side 1 could be an album of its own (an EP, I guess), and I’d still love it just as much. And then the album doubles down with side 2. Dum Dum Boys is a classic. God, I love this album. The penultimate song on the album is Tiny Girls, a really nice song. And the album closes with Mass Production, which is pretty awesome. The Idiot is a really great album. It’s a very nocturnal experience, which I think is pretty cool. It’s got some criticism for being basically a Bowie album, and while those criticisms are definitely fair… come on. It’s so good.\n\n#1. Raw Power\n\nAt #1, I have the Stooges’ 3rd and for the longest time final studio album, the infamous, the influential, the legendary Raw Power, released in 1973 under Iggy & the Stooges. Their first two releases were released in back-to-back years, and then this gets released 3 years later. It’s a lot different from its predecessors, yet also almost the same. The album opens with Search and Destroy, one of the best rock opening tracks in history. God damn, is this song an atomic bomb of energy. Like how I said I Wanna Be Your Dog and 1970 were the songs that defined their respective albums, this is this album’s defining song. It’s that good and iconic. The album continues with Gimme Danger, the first of this record’s two ballads required by the label on each side. Despite its almost aggressive nature, it’s one of my favorite ballads in music. Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell. Holy shit. This is the loudest, most raucous song on the album. And for an album like Raw Power, that’s saying a lot. This song is so fucking good. Penetration is ridiculously horny – in fact, I think this song is actually just the band having sex – and it’s amazing. The vibe this song creates is something else, especially at 3 in the morning, playing Batman: Arkham Asylum by the Christmas tree. Penetration fucks. The title track is great, an energetic rocker. I Need Somebody is a ballad, and I prefer Gimme Danger, but this song is still awesome and strangely romantic. The penultimate song on the album is Shake Appeal, and despite the album being stacked with explosively loud and energetic songs, this one sticks out to me. It’s another especially loud one, as is the song the album closes with, Death Trip. I love Death Trip so much. If there’s ever been an album title that perfectly suits the album, it’s Raw Power. This is a masterpiece, only held back by the fact that the mixes are shit. The original David Bowie mix ruined the album – he’s not a bad producer or anything, in fact, I think the production on Transformer is great. But he was given only a day to mix this. That ruined it. The version I listen to is the ’97 Iggy mix, which isn’t perfect, but it’s closer to what this album should be – completely chaotic and kickass noise. I love Raw Power, it’s a classic album, one of my all-time favorites.\n\nTop 10 Favorite Songs By Iggy Pop + The Stooges\n\n10. I Wanna Be Your Dog\n\n9. Gimme Danger\n\n8. Nightclubbing\n\n7. China Girl\n\n6. Shake Appeal\n\n5. The Passenger\n\n4. Lust for Life\n\n3. Search and Destroy\n\n2. Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell\n\nHonorable Mentions: Penetration, Death Trip, Sister Midnight, Sixteen, Down in the Street, Dirt, Funtime, Dum Dum Boys, Neighborhood Threat, Fun House, Raw Power, I Need Somebody, Fall In Love With Me\n\n1. 1970\n\nThis reminded me a lot of my journey through the discographies of Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground. The guy started out in a band, and that band made some really great stuff. Then he starts out his solo career and continues to make some really great stuff the first few times. Then after a while… he kind of starts to suck. It’s unfortunate, but it happens. It’s not only what happened with Lou, but it happened to Iggy. I will say, though… Iggy started to suck harder. I might as well just say it – Iggy Pop isn’t a very good artist. That’s not to say he hasn’t made great stuff, far from it. But I think, and I haven’t seen this yet in a discography I’ve ranked, the shit in this discography outnumbers the good stuff in this discography. That’s pretty sad. There’s only about 4 albums here that I would call genuinely great. But those 4 albums are awesome. Anyway, that was my ranking of the discographies of Iggy Pop and the Stooges. I feel disappointed. Anyway, thanks for reading, if you did.\n\nAlright, if you’re a metal fan, this might make you geek out. I’m not a huge metal fan, but I admit, I’m sort of geeking out too. Black Sabbath is awesome. They might be the most influential metal band of all time, and they’ve got a discography many other bands would be jealous of. But that’s only part of the time, as spoiler alert, Black Sabbath has some really great stuff and some really bad stuff. But most of it is in between my all-time favorites and my all-time least favorites. I know, they’ve got every type of good from incredible to nearly unlistenable. This is one of those discographies where there’s a lot of new stuff, so outside the earlier 70s releases, this discography is almost entirely new to me. Anyway, this is Black Sabbath.\n\n#19. Forbidden\n\nAt #19, I have their 18th studio album, Forbidden, released in 1995. The album opens with The Illusion of Power, which already starts out bad, with the lyric “What is it that turns you onto the illusion of power.” That’s just one of the dumbest lyrics ever. And then you find out this song has an Ice-T feature. Yes, not only do the Fathers of Metal have a feature… but it’s Ice-T. OK, we’re off to a bad start. The album continues with Get a Grip, which also sucks hard. Can’t Get Close Enough just makes me shudder every time the first vocal comes in. That’s how bad the vocals are. Shaking Off the Chains is awful. I Won’t Cry for You is really bad, a generic-ass 90s song. Guilty as Hell is shitty as hell. Sick and Tired is me trying to get through Black Sabbath’s discography, listening to, like, 5 terrible albums in a row. And this song isn’t helping. Rusty Angels is forgettable. The ninth song is the title track, a really dumb one. And the album closes with Kiss of Death, which is… I’ve fucking heard this song at least 65 times in the last few days. I swear, they’ve made the exact same stupid ballad over and over again. Damn, I’m on the verge of losing it and I just started writing. This song sucks. Forbidden, along with another album, is considered the worst album in the entire Black Sabbath discography. And I… agree with that claim. This is definitely their worst album. It’s genuinely disgusting. Ugh. The music is awful, the lyrics are awful, the artwork is awful. This is just one of the worst albums I’ve ever heard. Honestly, I think this album might be more listenable than the album above it – eh, I’m not even gonna try hiding it, it’s Born Again, but I think this is the inferior album. It’s close, though. Very close. To think that this was their last album for 18 years is just sad.\n\n#18. Born Again\n\nAt #18, I have their 11th studio album, Born Again, released in 1983. Ronnie James Dio, the singer of the last 2 albums, is gone. This album boasts Ian Gillian on vocals. Yes, the Ian Gillian of Deep Purple. This seems like a weird album. And it gets weirder when the music starts. The album opens with Trashed, which is pretty… bad. I’m sorry. The album continues with the instrumental Stonehenge, a contender for my favorite cut on the album because there’s no vocals. That’s disappointing when you have Ian Gillian on vocals. Disturbing the Priest is OK at best, and I know some people love it. Good for them. The Dark is another instrumental, but it isn’t as good as Stonehenge. This song is pointless. Skip. Zero the Hero is pretty annoying. Digital Bitch is just dumb. The title track kind of sucks. The penultimate song is Hot Line, which is pretty bad. Ian’s vocals get on my nerves on this song. And the album closes with the ninth song, Keep It Warm. It sucks. Born Again is commonly seen as one of Black Sabbath’s worst albums and that it has a beyond horrendous cover. I agree with both claims. This album is really bad. Ian Gillian is definitely not a bad singer, but this was the first and last Black Sabbath album he did vocals on, so I just feel like I’m listening to a Deep Purple album rather than a Black Sabbath album. A below average Deep Purple album. Sorry, this album has some defenders, I’m not one of them. Also, my god, I cannot stress enough how bad the artwork is, holy shit. Fuck this album and Forbidden, fuck them both just as hard.\n\n#17. Cross Purposes\n\nAt #17, I have their 17th studio album, Cross Purposes, released in 1994. The album opens with I Witness, a really boring reintroduction to Tony Martin after his absence for one album. The album continues with Cross of Thorns, a pretty generic one. Psychophobia sucks. Virtual Death could be cool, but it isn’t. It just blends in with all the other stupid Martin-led Sabbath songs. Immaculate Deception is pretty boring. Dying for Love is so stupid it hurts. This is the kind of stuff that belongs on one of the bottom 2 Sabbath albums. I mean, good on the band for making a song that doesn’t sound… that much like any other Sabbath song, but it’s dogass. Back to Eden is boring. The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is also boring. The ninth song is Cardinal Sin, which is… OK. And the album closes with the 6-minute Evil Eye, which is way too long. I don’t like this song. Cross Purposes is just… bad. It isn’t as awful as Born Again or Forbidden, but it’s up there. Or down there.\n\n#16. The Eternal Idol\n\nAt #16, I have their 13th studio album, The Eternal Idol, released in 1987 with yet another lineup change. This time, Tony Martin is on vocals. OK. The album opens with The Shining, which is pretty cool. But I don’t like this new guy’s vocals. Sorry. The album continues with Ancient Warrior, which is kind of bad. Hard Life to Love is boring. This is one of those albums where… pretty much everything is boring. My point is proven by the boring Glory Ride. Born to Lose is boring, Nightmare is boring. Alright, I’m Buddha-of-Suburbia-ing it. The Eternal Idol is kind of a nothing album. This album really isn’t special in any way. Actually, I guess if it’s so boring that I can’t even finish talking about it because I feel the exact same way about every single song… that’s pretty bad. This album sucks. Easily skippable.\n\n#15. Tyr\n\nAt #15, I have their 15th studio album, Tyr, released in 1990. The album opens with Anno Mundi, which is actually pretty amazing. That’s nice. Nowhere to go but downhill. The album continues with The Law Maker, which is pretty forgettable. That means it’s nowhere out of place in this current Black Sabbath phase. Jerusalem is pretty bad. The Sabbath Stones is too long considering it isn’t very good. The instrumental The Battle of Tyr is pretty nothing. Odin’s Court goes into Valhalla. I wasn’t able to listen to this on Spotify because it’s not there, so the transition killed the vibe. But there wasn’t much of a vibe to begin with, both of these songs are pretty bad. The penultimate song on the album is Feels Good to Me, which is boring. And the album closes with the ninth song, Heaven in Black, which is… pretty mid, yeah I had to think of a way to say that because for the last five albums, I’ve been a bit of a broken record. Tyr kind of sucks. That’s kind of disappointing, as I was able to deride some enjoyment out of their previous album. But Tyr is not worth listening to, it’s so standard, forgettable and just boring.\n\n#14. Seventh Star\n\nAt #14, I have their 12th studio album, Seventh Star, released in 1986. The album opens with In For the Kill, a Ramones-esque song. It’s kind of boring. The album continues with No Stranger to Love, a generic 80s ballad. Turn to Stone is forgettable, but it’s alright. Sphinx (The Guardian) is an instrumental, and it’s odd. This is not Black Sabbath. The title track is kind of easy to tune out, honestly. It’s fine. Danger Zone is kind of Ramones-y. I think they even had a song called Danger Zone. This song is mid. Heart Like a Wheel is the longest song on the album, but it might as well not exist. Filler ass, even with this song the album is only 35 minutes long. Dumbass Seventh Star. The penultimate song is Angry Heart, which is forgettable. And the album closes with the ninth song, In Memory. It’s also forgettable. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, there’s another line-up change on this album. We’ve gone from Ozzy to Dio to Ian Gillian to Glenn Hughes in the span of 5 albums. I’m tired. Seventh Star is… fine. It was supposed to be a Tony Iommi solo album, and the cover makes that clear. Seventh Star isn’t offensively bad like its predecessor, but it also isn’t incredibly memorable. It’s one of the most random and forgettable albums in Black Sabbath’s discography. It’s fine.\n\n#13. Never Say Die!\n\nAt #13, I have their 8th studio album, Never Say Die!, released in 1978 and for a while, their last album with Ozzy Osbourne. The album opens with the title track, which is pretty sick. I don’t know if it’s just me, but it sounds more Ramones-y than their previous works. But maybe that’s just me. The album continues with Johnny Blade, which is also really cool. Junior’s Eyes is really good, just a little too long. A Hard Road is pretty good. Shock Wave is sick, I love it. Air Dance is OK. Over to You is pretty good. The penultimate song on the album is Breakout, and I’m just relieved to hear a shorter song. I like this one. And the album closes with the ninth song, Swinging the Chain, a song I love. I hate to say it, but I don’t like Never Say Die! that much. My main complaint about it is the fact that it doesn’t leave a huge lasting impression with me. Also, I feel like this is easily the most boring album the band had put out up to that point. It’s not awful, I don’t even know if I’d say it’s particularly bad. It’s just very bland and uninteresting compared to some of the absolutely insane stuff the band’s been doing.\n\n#12. Headless Cross\n\nAt #12, I have their 14th studio album, Headless Cross, released in 1989. The album opens with the instrumental The Gates of Hell, a kinda boring opener. The album continues with the title track, which is pretty cheesy. But I sort of love it. Devil & Daughter is also pretty cheesy. I enjoy the title track more, however. When Death Calls is pretty good. At least, I like it. Kill in the Spirit World is OK. Call of the Wild is fun, I love this one. Black Moon is one I also love. The penultimate song on the album is Nightwing, which is really cool. But it’s too long. And the album closes with the ninth song, Cloak & Dagger, which is OK. Headless Cross is pretty fun. It’s a step up from the band’s previous 3 albums, a trilogy that ranges from so disgustingly awful to so disgustingly forgettable. Basically everything post-Mob Rules. Actually, I don’t know if I would call this album fun. Sure, it isn’t offensively awful or boring, but that’s why I’m praising this album – it’s refreshing to hear a Black Sabbath album that doesn’t completely suck. I haven’t heard one of those in a good 10 years.\n\n#11. Dehumanizer\n\nAt #11, I have their 16th studio album, Dehumanizer, released in 1992. Ronnie James Dio is back, but that’s only for this album. The album opens with Computer God, already an improvement over their previous 5 albums. I love this one. It’s heavy as hell, and while their previous albums could make 6 minutes feel like eternity, this time it feels normal. The album continues with After All (The Dead), another heavy-ass song. I also really like this one. TV Crimes is really cool. Letters from Earth is pretty good. Master of Insanity is cool. Time Machine is really good. Sins of the Father is awesome. Too Late should be called Too Long. But like I said about Computer God, this album is pretty good at making 6 minutes feel bearable. And I like this song a lot. The ninth song on the album is I, which is really cool. And the album closes with Buried Alive, which I love. Dehumanizer is really good. If Tony Martin was on this album instead of Dio, it wouldn’t be nearly as good. But this album is saved by Dio, proving how much I just… don’t really care for Martin. It’s sad that Dio didn’t come back again after this album, because it’s really pretty good.\n\n#10. Technical Ecstasy\n\nAt #10, I have their 7th studio album, Technical Ecstasy, released in 1976. The album opens with Back Street Kids, which I really love, and I can see how it influenced Bon Scott’s vocals on AC/DC albums. The album continues with You Won’t Change Me, which is pretty good. It’s Alright is nice. I like it, even though it isn’t Sabbath-y at all. Gypsy is really cool. All Moving Parts (Stand Still) is also really cool. Rock ‘n’ Roll Doctor sounds like a really underrated classic rock song. That’s basically what it is. I mean, yeah, the lyrics are pretty dumb, but that only helps. The penultimate song on the album is She’s Gone, which is pretty average. Easily my least favorite song on the album. And the album closes with Dirty Women, which I enjoy quite a bit. Technical Ecstasy is commonly seen as the band’s first sort of misfire and compared to some other “first misfires” I’ve heard, this one is pretty good. It isn’t as heavy as their previous albums – especially their last two, those were on another level of heaviness – but it’s still a fun listen. This may be my least favorite Sabbath album with Ozzy, but it’s impossible for me to hate an album they did with him. I still enjoy this one just fine, albeit less than their previous works.\n\n#9. Mob Rules\n\nAt #9, I have their 10th studio album, Mob Rules, released in 1981. This was their last album for about 10 years with their new vocalist, Ronnie James Dio. Damn, they just can’t stay with a proper lineup now, can they? Anyway, the album opens with Turn Up the Night, which is OK. Kind of generic. The album continues with Voodoo, which is pretty good. The Sign of the Southern Cross is the best on the album. It’s really pretty great. E5150 is an OK interlude. The title track, or The Mob Rules, is really good. Country Girl is nice. Slipping Away is OK. The penultimate song on the album is Falling Off the Edge of the World, which is pretty good. And the album closes with Over and Over, which is pretty cool. I think Mob Rules is pretty much a weaker version of its predecessor. I still like it just fine, but I think Heaven and Hell was a better album. But Mob Rules is still enjoyable.\n\n#8. 13\n\nAt #8, I have their 19th and final studio album, 13, released in 2013. The album opens with End of the Beginning, which is a good way to start the album. It’s fitting because this song… is really loud. After the absolute dumpster fire that was Forbidden, this is a pretty excellent way to bring us back. And Ozzy is back! Praise the Lord! This song sort of reminds me of their debut’s title track. There’s no way that wasn’t intentional. The album continues with God Is Dead?, which is awesome. Loner is sick. Zeitgeist is awesome. Age of Reason is really great. I love this one a lot. Live Forever is really good. The penultimate song on the album is Damaged Soul, which is really cool. And the album, and their discography, closes with Dear Father. It’s an amazing closer. I love the way it closes with bells ringing, a reference to the way their first album started. That’s beautiful. 13 is a pretty great way to close a discography like this one. After hearing so much garbage, incredible, inhuman garbage that nobody should listen to, I was finally reminded that I do indeed love this band. I seriously forgot, that’s how bad this discography got. It’s so nice to finally remember why I love a band that was once unstoppable. 13 is excellent, a very apocalyptic album.\n\n#7. Sabotage\n\nAt #7, I have their 6th studio album, Sabotage, released in 1975. The album opens with Hole in the Sky, an absolutely crazy opener. I love this one a lot. The album continues with the minute-long instrumental Don’t Start (Too Late), and it’s alright, I guess. Symptom of the Universe is really cool. I like it a lot. There’s a part around 4 minutes and 10 seconds in with the guitar that I think is just sick. Megalomania is 10 minutes long. Forgive me if I don’t love the excess of its runtime as much as you do. I still think it’s a really cool song, in fact, I kind of love it, but it overstays its welcome for me. Thrill of it All is pretty cool. Supertzar is alright. The penultimate song on the album is Am I Going Insane (Radio), which is really good. And the album closes with The Writ, which is pretty cool. Sabotage is an album I was absolutely adoring for the first few songs. I think what this album’s biggest flaw might be is the fact that the songs are really long. It has one 6.5-minute song, one 9 minute song, one 10-minute song, one 6-minute song. Like, please chill out, Sabotage. This album seems a lot angrier to me than the band’s previous albums, and that’s because it was. They thought their label was sabotaging them, hence the name of the album. Despite Sabotage‘s flaws, I still find it pretty great and a worthwhile listen.\n\n#6. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\n\nAt #6, I have their 5th studio album, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, released in 1973. The album opens with the title track, which is insane. This song has rightfully received a lot of praise, and it really is awesome. The album continues with A National Acrobat, another insane song. Fluff is surprisingly chill, a nice change of pace after the insanity of the previous two songs. And then Sabbra Cadabra brings that insanity right back. It’s sick. Killing Yourself to Live is also sick. Who Are You is pretty cool. The penultimate song on the album is Looking for Today, a song I love. And the album closes with Spiral Architect, an absolute classic and one of my favorite Sabbath songs. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is one heavy-ass album. Pretty much every song except Fluff is the heaviest song I’ve ever heard. I absolutely loved listening to this album.\n\n#5. Heaven and Hell\n\nAt #5, I have their 9th studio album, Heaven and Hell, released in 1980 and their first album without Ozzy Osbourne. The album opens with Neon Knights, our introduction to this new guy Ronnie James Dio. He’s a good singer, don’t get me wrong, but I much prefer Ozzy. I feel like his style of singing was way better for this band. But Dio is still good, and Neon Knights is pretty classic. The album continues with Children of the Sea, which I also really love. Lady Evil is pretty sick. The title track is considered a metal classic, and that’s for good reason. This song is really amazing. I love it a lot. Wishing Well is also awesome. Die Young is yet another amazing song, although perhaps my least favorite on the album. The penultimate song on the album is Walk Away, a song I really like. And the album closes with Lonely is the Word, another song I really like. Heaven and Hell has a surprisingly good reputation and is actually sort of a classic album. I said that I prefer Ozzy’s vocals, and I do, but I think if this album had his vocals, it wouldn’t be as good. It sounds weird, but I think you know what I mean. Anyway, yeah, I love this album.\n\n#4. Black Sabbath\n\nAt #4, I have their self-titled debut studio album, released in 1970. The album opens with the title track. A song called Black Sabbath on an album called Black Sabbath by a band called Black Sabbath that has nothing to do with a black sabbath. That’s interesting. Anyway, there’s not really much to be said about this song that hasn’t been said. It was arguably the birth of heavy metal, it’s one of the greatest metal songs ever made, it’s badass. What a song. The album continues with The Wizard, which I love a lot. It’s a cool, blues-y song. Behind the Wall of Sleep is sick. Another hit for this album. That guitar sound is out of this world. NIB is so good, man. It’s probably my favorite song on the album. The bass intro is one of the best things I’ve ever heard. Evil Woman was a cover, and Black Sabbath’s first single. It’s not as representative of the band as other songs on the album, like the title track or NIB. But I do think it’s a good way to introduce the band to the world, and it is a really good cover. The penultimate song on the album is Sleeping Village, an oddly chill, calm, and… just a pretty song. For the first minute, and then it goes into pure Black Sabbath badassery. And the album closes with Warning, which is 10 minutes long. It’s still a really cool song. Black Sabbath’s debut album is often credited with “inventing metal,” and while I don’t think that’s entirely true, it certainly revolutionized it in ways that are impossible to be overstated. It’s a great album, a fun listen and extremely iconic.\n\n#3. Master of Reality\n\nAt #3, I have their 3rd studio album, Master of Reality, released in 1971. The album opens with stoner anthem Sweet Leaf, a song that is iconic, classic, and awesome. Top 5 Sabbath material, in my opinion. The album continues with After Forever, a really cool song, I love it. The instrumental Embryo is like 30 seconds long, and it’s pretty much an interlude, but I still like it. Almost sounds a little Venus in Furs-esque. Children of the Grave is absolutely sick. It’s an absolute classic, easily one of their best. Orchid is another fairly brief instrmuental, but it’s pretty nice. Lord of This World is pretty sick. The penultimate song on the album is the softer Solitude, which is great. And the album closes with Into the Void, which has some insane guitar playing from Tony Iommi. Master of Reality is a classic album. I really love this one. It’s considered a classic nowadays and one of the best metal albums ever, but its reception upon its release was pretty negative. It’s a fun listen, I recommend it, one of my favorite metal albums. It’s short, but it makes the most out of its 34-minute runtime and 8 songs.\n\n#2. Paranoid\n\nAt #2, I have their 2nd studio album, Paranoid, released in 1970. The album opens with War Pigs, arguably one of the greatest anti-war songs ever made. It’s epic, it’s 8 minutes long, it’s incredibly impactful. It amazes me that anyone can call Black Sabbath evil when they have a song that is one of the anti-war songs. This song is a masterpiece. The album continues with the title track, and considering it was basically put together in 25 minutes because the album was too short, it’s pretty impressive that it became the album’s lead single, their most streamed song on Spotify by a wide margin and is today considered not only one of the best ever metal songs but one of the best songs ever. If War Pigs is a genuine masterpiece, this song is a genuine classic. It’s catchy as hell and has one of the best riffs ever. Planet Caravan is an excellent song, a huge tonal change from the classic rock glory of the last two songs. Iron Man is epic. It also has one of the greatest guitar riffs of all time. Every beginner guitar player learns this riff. This song is also pretty much the definition of metal. If you don’t know what the song is about, it’s about a man who travels to the future and sees the apocalypse. While he’s returning to the present, he gets turned into steel by a magnetic field and when he gets back to the present, he tries telling the public about what he’s seen, but he’s widely ignored and derided, so he causes the apocalypse seen in his vision. That’s just awesome. Electric Funeral is a really sick song. Hand of Doom is a great song that I used to think went on for too long. But it’s epic. The penultimate song on the album is the instrumental Rat Salad, which is pretty good. And the album closes with Fairies Wear Boots, a classic. Paranoid is a really great album. Easily one of my favorite metal albums.\n\n#1. Vol. 4\n\nAt #1, I have their 4th studio album, Vol. 4, released in 1972. The album opens with Wheels of Confusion (or sometimes called The Straightener), which is a pretty good indication of what the album is about to me. Absolutely jam-packed. This is actually one of the most insane album openers I’ve ever heard. Frownland has nothing on this. There’s enough stuff here, in this one song, to create 5 all-time great album openers. That’s insane. This is a really awesome song, I love it. The album continues with Tomorrow’s Dream, another song that makes me feel amazing. Changes is a nice one. Yeah, it’s pretty Bowie-esque, even despite its title. FX is an instrumental, and it’s OK. Supernaut is absolutely crazy. John Bonham and Frank Zappa loved this song. And it’s really great. Snowblind is also absolutely crazy. I adore this song. It’s something out of this world. Cornucopia is really cool. The instrumental Laguna Sunrise is beautiful. It was the first song I ever heard from this album, and it came on shuffle. When I found out it was by Black Sabbath, my mind was blown. Really pretty song. The ninth song is St. Vitus Dance, a kickass, almost punk-y song. And the album closes with Under the Sun (or Every Day Comes and Goes), and it’s a sick end to a surprisingly sick album. I’m pretty sure Vol. 4 is one of the most cocaine-heavy albums I’ve ever heard. There’s literally a song called Snowblind. That doesn’t mean it’s not excellent. Quite the opposite, in fact. I wasn’t too familiar with this album before this list, and I think it’s pretty incredible. The general consensus of this album is more polarized than I realized, but I love it. Do you know how surprised I am to be putting an album above Paranoid on this list? I listened to this album multiple times, and I loved it more every single time. Criticisms about it being all over the place and incohesive be damned, I really love Vol. 4.\n\nTop 10 Favorite Black Sabbath Songs\n\n10. Black Sabbath\n\n9. Supernaut\n\n8. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\n\n7. Hole in the Sky\n\n6. Snowblind\n\n5. NIB\n\n4. Iron Man\n\n3. Sweet Leaf\n\n2. War Pigs\n\nHonorable Mentions: Heaven and Hell, Wheels of Confusion, Planet Caravan, Electric Funeral, Children of the Grave, The Wizard, Spiral Architect, Symptom of the Universe, Dear Father\n\n1. Paranoid\n\nSo, that was my Black Sabbath ranking. Huh. There was some excellent stuff in this list, don’t get me wrong. But that just… sucked. After Mob Rules, there was pretty much… two albums that I liked, maybe sort of three, but Headless Cross is an oddity. Sorry that I posted this on a Monday instead of a Friday but Forbidden was so bad that I seriously needed to take the weekend off. And the weekend is usually the only time I don’t take off for these. When I started my dive through this discography, I kept thinking to myself “Why isn’t Black Sabbath one of my favorite bands?” That’s what I thought up until Born Again. Yeah, Never Say Die! wasn’t great, but how many perfect discographies are there in the world? But Born Again is such an incredible explosion of awfulness, and I realized it wasn’t getting too much better after that until 13. But it took the world 30 years to get to 13 after that. Anyway, I’m taking a Sabbath break. I really don’t need to here most of these albums ever again. Thanks for reading, if you did.\n\nAlright, now I actually get to talk about the Talking Heads. Now that I’ve gotten Def Leppard out of the way, ugh. Anyway, happy pre-Thanksgiving, everyone. Well, not everyone. Basically, just us damn Yanks. And I guess not for me either, because I was dumb enough to break both of my arms a week ago. But the day I’m writing this is still the day before Thanksgiving where I am, so I’m feeling festive. Festive enough. So yeah, my talking head is talking about the Talking Heads. The best band of all time? No, but they’re one of my favorites. I will only be including studio albums in this list, so I won’t be including the huge live albums they have in their discography, but I love them both. I’m only doing the albums in their main studio discography. The name of this band is Talking Heads.\n\n#8. True Stories\n\nAt #8, I have their 7th studio album, True Stories, released in 1986, and a soundtrack to the movie of the same name. The album opens with Love for Sale, which is loud, but somehow very normal by Talking Heads standards. It’s OK. The album continues with Puzzlin’ Evidence, which is both fun and boring. Hey Now is decent. Papa Legba is pretty long. It’s another OK one. The lead single, Wild Wild Life, is a pretty fun song. Despite its title, however, it’s disappointingly tame for a Talking Heads single. Radio Head famously inspired the band Radiohead’s band name – Radiohead. That’s all there is to it, it’s Little Creatures-esque (at least in my ears), but more forgettable. Dream Operator is kind of forgettable. The penultimate song on the album is People Like Us, which is, again, forgettable. And the album closes with the ninth song, City of Dreams, which is fine. True Stories is disappointingly incredibly average. I was very disappointed listening to it, because I really enjoy their first 6 albums. Yes, I said 6. I might as well talk about the True Stories movie. It was made by all 4 band members, and it stars David Byrne. I don’t really know, I haven’t seen the movie yet. I don’t think that when I do see the movie, it’ll do much in the way of changing my opinion on this album – it’s passable, which is not OK for the Talking Heads.\n\n#7. Naked\n\nAt #7, I have their 8th and final studio album, Naked, released in 1988. There’s two versions of this album, and the only difference is one version features the song Bill (CD version) while the other one doesn’t (LP version). I’m covering the CD version. The album opens with Blind, a pretty great song. It’s better when you find out white guys made it. Talking Heads were awesome. The album continues with Mr. Jones, another pretty good one. Totally Nude is actually kind of pretty, despite being a song called Totally Nude. Then again, this is an album called Naked. I love this song and, so far, this album. Ruby Dear is another good one. (Nothing But) Flowers is amazing. I love this song. Everyone does. The Democratic Circus is pretty. I like it, so what? The Facts of Life is a song pretty much everyone hates, and it isn’t great, but it’s not as offensively bad as some people claim. Mommy Daddy You and I is pretty good. The ninth song is Big Daddy, which I like a lot. The penultimate song on the album is the aforementioned Bill, which I love. And the album closes with Cool Water, another pretty cool song. And the bonus track Sax and Violins is worth mentioning, because it’s great. I love Naked. I know, shocking. Even I was surprised how much I loved this album.\n\n#6. Little Creatures\n\nAt #6, I have their 6th studio album, Little Creatures, released in 1985. The album opens with And She Was, a really nice pop song. The album continues with Give Me Back My Name, another really good song. Creatures of Love is cute. The Lady Don’t Mind is excellent. Perfect World is pretty. I’d love to live inside the world this song creates. Things would be perfect. Stay Up Late is notorious among Talking Heads fans for not really being that good, and while I do think it’s the worst song on the album, I still kind of like it. Walk It Down is pretty cool. The penultimate song on the album is Television Man, which is very good, despite being a bit too long. And the album closes with the ninth song, Road to Nowhere, an excellent, iconic song. This album is actually pretty good. It’s not as amazing as their previous 5 albums, but considering no one ever talks about it, it really is good. Strangely, it’s their biggest-selling album. This album was made after drummer Chris Frantz and bassist Tina Weymouth had their baby, and I think this album consists of what was going on in David Byrne’s world. Hell, the album is even called Little Creatures. I actually think this album sort of deserves the status of a great album, and a part of their first 6. The only real change is the fact that the music sounds a little smaller. But I think it’s almost as good as their first 5 album. So, yeah, Little Creatures is, in my opinion, a great album.\n\n#5. Talking Heads: 77\n\nAt #5, I have their debut album, Talking Heads: 77, released in… 1977. The album opens with Uh Oh, Love Comes to Town, which is so cute. I legitimately think of this song as a classic. Personally, I prefer the darker side of Talking Heads, a side that shows itself on their next few albums, and even eventually on this one. But this is still a great song. The album continues with New Feeling, which I also love. Tentative Decision is pretty fun. Happy Day is so happy. I love it. Who Is It? is fun. No Compassion is pretty good. I like the song’s main riff quite a bit. The Book I Read is alright. Don’t Worry About the Government is pretty good. The ninth song is First Week/Last Week… Carefree, which is pretty alright. The penultimate song on the album is the forever iconic Psycho Killer, which was the first Talking Heads song I ever heard, and I loved it so much. This song is so goddamn good. It’s about something so dark, yet it sounds so lively and upbeat. It’s just awesome. And the album closes with Pulled Up, which is great, but it fails to live up to the magic of Psycho Killer. This is a really good debut record. The album artwork is utter ass, but the album itself… is pretty great. It’s a fun, simple new wave punk album before they started collaborating with Brian Eno and making some really crazy, amazing stuff. It’s about as awkward and anxious as you’d expect an album to be made by young Talking Heads members. The main problem with this album is that it sort of loses me in the middle, but it gets me back in tremendous fashion by Psycho Killer. This is just a really fun album; you should listen to it. It was originally going at #4, so just know that it’s placement in the bottom half of the list does not mean it isn’t great.\n\n#4. Speaking in Tongues\n\nAt #4, I have their 5th studio album, Speaking in Tongues, released in 1983. The album opens with Burning Down the House, which is just… awesome. Goddamn it, this song is a classic. It’s so good, one of my favorite Talking Heads songs. The album continues with Making Flippy Floppy, which is 6 minutes long. This album has only two songs under 5 minutes, one of which I’ve already covered, and the other one is 4 minutes and 55 seconds. This slightly tired me out when I first listened to it, but enough about that, Making Flippy Floppy is way cooler than I remembered. However, a problem it has, along with a lot of other songs on the album, is that it overstays its welcome. Girlfriend is Better is awesome. One of their most iconic songs, but it overstays its welcome. Slippery People is so good, man. I Get Wild / Wild Gravity is another cool one. Wow, this album is pretty good. Swamp is really cool. That riff is so cool, and the chorus is so fun. Moon Rocks is really fun and space-y. The penultimate song on the album is Pull Up the Roots, which is, yeah, fun. And the album closes with the ninth song, the wonderful This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody). This song is really amazing. It makes me feel so happy. Speaking in Tongues is… actually really, really good. I used to not be a massive fan of this album, but it’s so good. It’s fun, it’s loud, it’s energetic, it’s creative. It’s actually a pretty perfect distillation of what this band was. It was their first album since their debut without Brian Eno’s presence, and it’s nice to see that didn’t affect their ability to make a good album. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it this time.\n\n#3. More Songs About Buildings And Food\n\nAt #3, I have their 2nd studio album, More Songs About Buildings And Food, released in 1978. The album opens with Thank You For Sending Me an Angel, a fun opener that does sound a little See No Evil by Television-esque, but that’s not a bad thing at all. The album is continued by With Our Love (the two “withs” bothered me), which is also fun. The Good Thing is a classic, easily my 3rd favorite on the album, despite not being one of the band’s more well-known songs. Warning Sign is pretty good. The Girl Wants to be With the Girls is fun. There’s some cool sounds. Found a Job is good, but I feel it overstays its welcome a bit. I shouldn’t really mind that, as my two favorite songs on this album are both over 5 minutes long, but I just enjoy those songs more. I won’t spoil what those songs are, because you probably already know what they are if you’ve heard this album. Artists Only is so cool, man. I’m Not in Love is good. The ninth song is Stay Hungry, which is also just good. The album follows up two of its weakest songs (in my opinion) with its two finest songs. The penultimate song on the album is a cover of Al Green’s Take Me To The River, an absolutely perfect cover song. The original is good, but this version is an absolute classic, one of the band’s finest moments. And the album closes with an awesome original song, The Big Country. This song is so chill. It gives me a SpongeBob music vibe, I love it. This album closed stronger than any other Heads album. Fantano might not love this album, but I think it’s a classic, along with many other people. It was their first album of 3 to be produced by Brian Eno, and judging by my top 3, I guess my favorite kind of Talking Heads album is the kind produced by Brian Eno. This album is sort of a mix between the simplicity of their debut and the insane energy and complex production of their next 2 albums. I just love this album, it’s so… mysterious, alien and fun to explore.\n\n#2. Remain in Light\n\nAt #2, I have their 4th studio album, Remain in Light, released in 1980, and what is easily their most critically acclaimed album. There’s a good reason for that. This album is great. The album opens with Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On), which is great. Obviously. The album continues with Crosseyed and Painless, which is also pretty great. Much better than I usually remember it as being. Color me surprised. The Great Curve has one of the best grooves of all time, and it was made by white guys. Talking Heads, you were awesome. This song is awesome. Once in a Lifetime. This is the best song ever. Any good thing that I can say about a song can be applied to this song. This is the band’s opus and the music video is iconic, obviously. God damn, this song is incredible. Houses in Motion is also incredible. I was listening to this song biking around on the last day of school, and it gave me an appreciation for this song. I already liked it, but probably not as much as I do now. Seen and Not Seen is great. The penultimate song on the album is Listening Wind, which is incredible. It feels like it aged well since 9-11. What a song. And the album closes with the Joy Division-esque The Overload. It’s an incredibly dark song to end the album on, but it’s just… great. This album is awesome. Everybody knows that. But I don’t think it’s easily their best album, like many other people do. A great album undoubtedly, but it’s not my favorite in their discography. On this relisten, my love for it has grown a lot, though. When I first listened to this album, I sort of hated everything except Once in a Lifetime, the one song on the album I’d already heard. Over the course of the next month or two, each individual song started growing on me and now the album is one of my all-time favorites. But still not my favorite Heads album.\n\n#1. Fear of Music\n\nAt #1, I have their 3rd studio album, Fear of Music, released in 1979. The album opens with I Zimbra, which is sort of the song I think of when I think of white people doing funky funk. It’s awesome. The album continues with Mind, which is one of their best songs. I can say that about a lot of Talking Heads songs, but I seriously mean it about this one. Paper has a sick riff. It’s a sick song altogether. Cities is great, and yet somehow it doesn’t stand out much on this album. But it’s great. Life During Wartime is awesome. It was the second Talking Heads song I heard after Psycho Killer, but it was until the 3rd one I heard before I called myself a Talking Heads fan. This song is a classic. Memories Can’t Wait is very great. Air is possibly the most underrated Talking Heads song of all. I mean it. Goddamn it, I love this song. Heaven is a masterpiece. This song is beautiful. The ninth song is Animals, which is pretty funky. I know, right, what a surprise. The penultimate song on the album is Electric Guitar, which might actually be the least good song on the album. And it’s still so goddamn good. And the album closes with Drugs, which is so good. It feels like I’m actually on drugs. Not that I would know what that’s like. Anyway, Fear of Music is awesome. This album was ranked the worst Talking Heads music by that stupid Spork_lift guy on YouTube. God, I hate him. Don’t watch that short. Anyway, this album’s a classic, my favorite Talking Heads album. If I had to pick 5 albums from the 70s that I would give a 10/10, this would probably be on that list. Sort of like how Remain in Light would probably be on that list, 80s edition.\n\nTop 10 Favorite Talking Heads Songs\n\n(This is one of those “favorite songs” lists where everything except number 1 could change at any given moment)\n\n10.

Once in a Lifetime\n\nSo, that was the Talking Heads, easily one of my favorite bands. They’ve only been one of my favorite bands for less than a year, but they’re just really great. Going through their discography is no tall order, because it’s short and fun. I forgot to mention the concert film Stop Making Sense released in 1984. It was re-released in theaters recently, and it’s so beloved that it’s in the top 20 for movies on RateYourMusic. I adore this band and I probably will for a long time. Have a nice Thanksgiving, and thanks for reading.\n\nAlright, I’m back and I’m talking about the Talking… wait, no, that’s next month. I’m talking about Def Leppard. Aw, man, I wanted to talk about the Talking Heads. Now I have to talk about When Love and Hate Collide. Shit. Wait, no, that’s a non-album single, yay! Def Leppard is a band that was once great. Maybe. Now they’re not. I’m not even gonna try and deny the fact that they have some super, super, super great songs and maybe even a couple of great albums. But they fell off, big time. I admit that, and this isn’t something you want to have said about you as a band, I’m kinda covering them now just so I don’t have to cover them later on. OK, go.\n\n#12. X\n\nAt #12, I have their 8th studio album, X, released in 2002. The album opens with Now, which I’m split between hating and almost hating. The instrumental is barely passable, but Joe’s vocals let the song down for me. They make the song bad. The album continues with Unbelievable, which sounds like Ween’s Flutes of Chi to me. While that’s a good song, this is really cheesy and terrible. It’s just so awful. You’re So Beautiful is just awful. Everyday would maybe be OK if every Def Leppard song wasn’t a ballad. Therefore, it is completely forgettable. Long Long Way to Go proves the point I literally just made by being a ballad. Where Everyday is forgettable, this song is actively bad. What is this Trolls-ass music? Four Letter Word might as well be called “shit”, because that’s what it is. Torn to Shreds is about what everyone who buys this album should do to it. No surprise, it ain’t good. Love Don’t Lie is another fucking powerless ballad. This makes me feel so empty. The ninth song is Gravity, which is so stupid. Cry is an embarrassment. Girl Like You is forgettable. The penultimate song on the album is Let Me Be The One, which might actually be the most ridiculous Def Leppard ballad of all time. I mean it. And the album finally closes with Scar. I’ll be walking away with a few of those after listening to this song, but mainly this album as a whole. X is notorious in Def Leppard’s discography for being bad, and in a discography with albums like Slang and Songs from the Sparkle Lounge, it’s an achievement for an album to stand out for being worse than others. And yeah. This album is really bad. I never want to listen to it again. Pretty much everyone agrees that it’s the worst Def Leppard album, and it’s one of the few albums I’ve heard that I might truly give a 0/10. Never Let Me Down sucks, but this is definitely worse. That album’s probably more like a 1/10, but this is a 0. It is the worst. Speaking of albums called X getting 0/10s, what’d you think of Ken Carson’s new album? I liked the last one just fine, which a lot of Stantanos would disagree with, but I thought this was an improvement. Anyways.\n\n#11. Slang\n\nAt #11, I have their 6th studio album, Slang, released in 1996. The album opens with Truth?, which is not that good. It’s a hint of what’s to come. The album continues with Turn to Dust, which is just goofy. It sounds like Def Leppard trying to sound cool and artsy by dabbling in Indian influences with the sitar, but it is not cool or artsy. The title track is so goofy. What the hell is this shit? All I Want Is Everything sounds like a song that would’ve played in Shrek. I love it for that. But it’s just so bad. Work It Out is kind of cheesy. Breathe A Sigh is this album’s hilarious attempt at making me feel something. I love it for making me laugh. I guess it did make me feel something. Deliver Me is pretty bad. Gift of Flesh is so bad it’s just bad. The ninth song is Blood Runs Cold is another one of them power ballads. Obviously, it lacks any power. The penultimate song on the album is Where Does Love Go When It Dies, which is another fucking power ballad. This album is so ridiculous. This one is hilarious. And the album closes with Pearl of Euphoria, which is one of the best jokes ever. The only problem is that the punchline is seemingly the fact that it’s 6 and a half minutes long. But I don’t care, I don’t want this album to end, I haven’t laughed this hard since my period 6 English class. Slang is the point where the world sort of stopped caring about Def Leppard, and yeah, this album isn’t that good. In fact, I might actually call this album hilariously awful. It lacks any direction, hopping from bad(or dumb)ass rock song to even dumber ass power ballads seemingly every 5 seconds. But goddamn is it funny.\n\n#10. Songs from the Sparkle Lounge\n\nAt #10, I have their 10th studio album, Songs from the Sparkle Lounge, released in 2008. The album opens with Go. Social Distortion moment. This song is whatever. The album continues with Nine Lives, featuring a Tim McGraw feature. This song isn’t great, but… it’s not unlistenable. C’mon C’mon features some pretty slick guitar. But the song isn’t that good. Love is what I get nervous would appear on this album. Another powerless ballad. As to be expected, it blows. Tomorrow. Social Distortion moment. Wow, that’s the second time I’"
