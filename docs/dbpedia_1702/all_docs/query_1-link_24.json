NASA, NOAA Scientists Explain What This Means\n\nSeptember 15, 2020\n\nSolar Cycle 25 has begun. The Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel announced solar minimum occurred in December 2019, marking the transition into a new solar cycle. In a press event, experts from the panel, NASA, and NOAA discussed the analysis and Solar Cycle 25 prediction, and how the rise to the next solar maximum and subsequent upswing in space weather will impact our lives and technology on Earth.A new solar cycle comes roughly every 11 years. Over the course of each cycle, the star transitions from relatively calm to active and stormy, and then quiet again; at its peak, the Sun’s magnetic poles flip. Now that the star has passed solar minimum, scientists expect the Sun will grow increasingly active in the months and years to come.Understanding the Sun’s behavior is an important part of life in our solar system. The Sun’s outbursts—including eruptions known as solar flares and coronal mass ejections—can disturb the satellites and communications signals traveling around Earth, or one day, Artemis astronauts exploring distant worlds.

This solar flare is the largest of Solar Cycle 25 and is classified as an X8.7 flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength.A solar flare is an intense burst of radiation, or light, on the Sun. Flares are our solar system’s most powerful explosive events. Light only takes about 8 minutes to travel from the Sun to Earth, so that’s how long it would take the energy from a flare to reach our planet. Stronger solar flares — those rated class M5 or above — can have impacts on technology that depends on Earth’s ionosphere (our electrically charged upper atmosphere), like high-frequency radio used for navigation and GPS.NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) captured these images of the flare, which peaked at 12:51 p.m. ET on May 14. The X8.7 flare appears on the lower right edge of the Sun. (A small eruption appears afterward in the upper left.) SDO sees the Sun in more than 10 distinct wavelengths of light, showing solar material at different temperatures. Different wavelengths are shown in this video to highlight different features of the flare.Music credit: “Ethereal Mirrorscape” from the album Reflections written and produced by Lars LeonhardWatch this video on the NASA Goddard YouTube channel.Complete transcript available. || X8pt7_flare_May_14_2024.00_00_40_22.Still001.jpg (3840x2160) [3.0 MB] || X8pt7_flare_May_14_2024.00_00_40_22.Still001_print.jpg (1024x576) [342.3 KB] || X8pt7_flare_May_14_2024.00_00_40_22.Still001_searchweb.png (320x180) [75.1 KB] || X8pt7_flare_May_14_2024.00_00_40_22.Still001_web.png (320x180) [75.1 KB] || X8pt7_flare_May_14_2024.00_00_40_22.Still001_thm.png (80x40) [6.1 KB] || 14592_SDO_X8pt7_flare_May_14_2024_ProRes_Outro.webm [20.4 MB] || 14592_SDO_X8pt7_flare_May_14_2024_Good_Outro.mp4 [175.9 MB] || 14592_SDO_X8pt7_flare_May_14_2024_ProRes_Outro.mov [4.2 GB] || 14592_SDO_X8pt7_flare_May_14_2024_YouTube_Outro.mp4 [673.0 MB] ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nID: 14588 Produced Video\n\nMay 2-10, 2024 : A Busy Week of Flares\n\nMay 9, 2024\n\nProduced VideoWatch this video on the NASA Goddard YouTube channel.Music Credit: “Halos” from the album Burning Clouds.

While the far-side of the Sun eventually rotates into view, coverage of the Sun's polar regions is never satisfactory as perspective effects either completely block our view or create a distorted view. We must often resort to computer modeling of these solar polar regions.This visualization presents the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) magnetic field model based on solar observations covering the years 2017-2019. One version also presents the 'hole' in our measurements of the solar polar region. The region oscillates in size over the course of the year due to the changing perspective created by the tilt of Earth's orbital plane with the solar equator. In this region, researchers must resort to approximations to build a more complete view of the solar magnetic field.Why is the solar magnetic field in this region important? Because the combined with the outgoing flow of the solar wind, the magnetic field lines from the polar regions curve up, and then back down to near the Sun's equatorial plane, which is still fairly close to the orbital plane of Earth and other planets in our solar system. This gives the Sun's polar magnetic field a significant influence on the space weather impacting Earth and crewed and uncrewed assets around the solar system. ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nID: 4124 Visualization\n\nThe Sun's Magnetic Field\n\nDecember 5, 2013\n\nDuring the course of the approximately 11 year sunspot cycle, the magnetic field of the Sun reverses. The last time this happened was around the year 2000. Using magnetograms from the SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI instruments, it is possible to examine possible configurations of the magnetic field above the photosphere. These magnetic configurations are important in understanding potential conditions of severe space weather.The magnetic field in this animation is constructed using the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model. The PFSS model is one of the simplest yet realistic models we can explore. Using the solar magnetograms as the 'source surface' of the field, it builds the field structure from the photosphere out to about two solar radii (an altitude of 1 solar radius). These visuals were generated using the SolarSoft package. In this visualization, the white magnetic field lines are considered 'closed'. The move up, and then return to the solar surface. The green and violet lines represenent field lines that are considered 'open'. Green represents positive magnetic polarity, and violet represents negative polarity. These field lines do not connect back to the Sun but with more distant magnetic fields in space. These field lines act as easy 'roads' for the high-speed solar wind. ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nID: 3521 Visualization\n\nThe Solar Dynamo: Toroidal and Poloidal Magnetic Fields\n\nAugust 19, 2008\n\nUsing the solar plasma flows as input (see The Solar Dynamo: Plasma Flows), the equations of magnetohydrodynamics, and 'seeding' the calculations with an initial small magnetic field, one can compute how a magnetic field can grow and be maintained. This is the dynamo process, the net result being that part of the Sun's outflowing thermal convective energy from nuclear processes is used to create the magnetic field.In this view of the solar dynamo mechanism, we examine the evolution of the toroidal magnetic field, the field intensity represented by colors on the right-hand cross-section, and the poloidal magnetic potential field, represented by colors on the left-hand cross-section. The poloidal magnetic potential is a scalar quantity that contains information about the radial and latitudinal magnetic field vectors. To see the radial magnetic field, see The Solar Dynamo: Toroidal and Radial Magnetic Fields.In this visualization, the magnetic field lines (represented by the 'copper wire' structures) are 'snapshots' of the field structure constructed at each time step of the model. These field lines should not be considered as 'moving' or 'stretching' as the model evolves in time. Even this simplified model reproduces a number of characteristics observed in the actual solar magnetic field. Cyclic behavior with oscillations in the magnetic field amplitude.Magnetic regions at the surface migrate from high latitudes towards the equator as the solar cycle progresses. This reproduces the \"Butterfly Diagram\" pattern.Surface magnetic polarities reverse with each cycleBecause this model is axisymmetric, it cannot simulate non-axisymmetric features such as active longitudes. ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nID: 3583 Visualization\n\nThe Solar Dynamo: Toroidal and Radial Magnetic Fields\n\nAugust 19, 2008\n\nUsing the solar plasma flows as input (see The Solar Dynamo: Plasma Flows), the equations of magnetohydrodynamics, and 'seeding' the calculations with an initial small magnetic field, one can compute how a magnetic field can grow and be maintained.

The comparison to a simple bar magnet ends there, however, as the sun's magnetic fields are on the move. In fact, approximately every 11 years the polarity of the sun’s northern and southern hemisphere flips. This change is part of a regular cycle called the solar cycle. Each cycle is defined by periods of high and low solar activity caused by the movement of magnetic field lines that extend out from the sun. Now, a new animation created from data collected by the ESA/NASA SOHO spacecraft shows how migrating magnetic field lines result in a reversal of the sun’s polarity.

The sun (and the orbit of the Earth) is located in the tiny blue region in the center. The ISM is moving from left to right. The solar wind varies from 400 km/s up to 566 km/s and back down to 400 km/s over the cycle in this particular model. The colors are logarithmically scaled to represent temperature, with blue around 10,000 Kelvins (in the undisturbed ISM and the region immediately around the Sun) and red over 1,000,000 Kelvins (corresponding to the bow shocked region in the plasma). The green region around the Sun has a radius that varies between 100-200 Astronomical Units. ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nPRODUCED CONTENT\n\nID: 13715 Produced Video\n\nHow To Track The Solar Cycle\n\nSeptember 15, 2020\n\nA new solar cycle comes roughly every 11 years. Over the course of each cycle, the Sun transitions from relatively calm to active and stormy, and then quiet again; at its peak, the Sun’s magnetic poles flip. Now that the star has passed solar minimum, scientists expect the Sun will grow increasingly active in the months and years to come.Understanding the Sun’s behavior is an important part of life in our solar system. The Sun’s outbursts—including eruptions known as solar flares and coronal mass ejections—can disturb the satellites and communications signals traveling around Earth, or one day, Artemis astronauts exploring distant worlds. Scientists study the solar cycle so we can better predict solar activity. As of 2020, the Sun has begun to shake off the sleep of minimum, which occurred in December 2019, and Solar Cycle 25 is underway. Scientists use several indicators to track solar cycle progress. ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nID: 13716 Produced Video\n\nThe Solar Cycle As Seen From Space\n\nSeptember 17, 2020\n\nVIDEO IN ENGLISH Watch this video on the NASA Goddard YouTube channel.The Sun is stirring from its latest slumber. As sunspots and flares, signs of a new solar cycle, bubble from the Sun’s surface, scientists are anticipating a flurry of solar activity over the next few years. Roughly every 11 years, at the height of this cycle, the Sun’s magnetic poles flip—on Earth, that’d be like the North and South Poles’ swapping places every decade—and the Sun transitions from sluggish to active and stormy. At its quietest, the Sun is at solar minimum; during solar maximum, the Sun blazes with bright flares and solar eruptions. In this video, view the Sun's disk from our space telescopes as it transitions from minimum to maximum in the solar cycle.Music credit: \"Observance\" by Andrew Michael Britton [PRS], David Stephen Goldsmith [PRS] from Universal Production Music || 13716_SolarCycleFromSpace_YouTube.01410_print.jpg (1024x576) [68.8 KB] || 13716_SolarCycleFromSpace_YouTube.01410_searchweb.png (320x180) [35.9 KB] || 13716_SolarCycleFromSpace_YouTube.01410_web.png (320x180) [35.9 KB] || 13716_SolarCycleFromSpace_YouTube.01410_thm.png (80x40) [3.8 KB] || 13716_SolarCycleFromSpace_Facebook.mp4 (1920x1080) [115.2 MB] || 13716_SolarCycleFromSpace_Prores.mov (1920x1080) [1.3 GB] || 13716_SolarCycleFromSpace_Twitter.mp4 (1920x1080) [21.2 MB] || 13716_SolarCycleFromSpace_YouTube.mp4 (1920x1080) [153.6 MB] || 13716_SolarCycleFromSpace_YouTube.webm (1920x1080) [11.0 MB] || SolarCycleAsSeenFromSpace.en_US.srt [630 bytes] || SolarCycleAsSeenFromSpace.en_US.vtt [641 bytes] ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nID: 13642 Produced Video\n\n11 Years Charting The Edge of The Solar System\n\nJune 11, 2020\n\nWatch this video on the NASA Goddard YouTube channel.Music credits: “End of Days - Joe Mason Remix” by Connor Shambrook [BMI], Cyrus Reynolds [BMI], Flynn Hase Spence [ASCAP], Joseph Scott Mason [APRA]; “Brainstorming” by Laurent Dury [SACEM]; “Flight of the Leaf Remix” by Julie Gruss [GEMA], Laurent Dury [SAXEM]; “Ticks and Thoughts” by Laurent Dury [SACEM]; “Intimate Journey” by Laurent Vernerey [SACEM], Nicolas de Ferran [SACEM] from Universal Production MusicComplete transcript available. || 13642_IBEX11years_YouTube.00214_print.jpg (1024x576) [239.3 KB] || 13642_IBEX11years_YouTube.00214_searchweb.png (320x180) [98.0 KB] || 13642_IBEX11years_YouTube.00214_thm.png (80x40) [6.7 KB] || 13642_IBEX11years_Prores-2.mov (1920x1080) [4.2 GB] || 13642_IBEX11years_YouTube.mp4 (1920x1080) [489.0 MB] || 13642_IBEX11years_Facebook.mp4 (1920x1080) [366.4 MB] || 13642_IBEX11years_Twitter.mp4 (1920x1080) [66.4 MB] || 13642_IBEX11years_YouTube.webm (1920x1080) [33.9 MB] || IBEX11years.en_US.srt [5.8 KB] || IBEX11years.en_US.vtt [5.8 KB] ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nID: 10834 Produced Video\n\nMagnetic Hotspots\n\nDecember 22, 2011\n\nSunspots are the relatively cool, dark blemishes that appear on the sun's otherwise super-fiery and flawless surface. To scientists, these planet-sized phenomena indicate the location where strong magnetic fields that power solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) emerge from the sun's interior. The number of sunspots increases and decreases over time in a regular, approximately 11-year cycle, called the sunspot cycle. During each cycle sunspots migrate from the sun's mid-latitude regions towards the equator, with the highest number observed in any given cycle designated \"solar maximum\" and the lowest number designated \"solar minimum.\" Each cycle varies dramatically in number, with some solar maxima being so low as to be almost indistinguishable from the preceding minimum.

Since then the spacecraft has had virtually unbroken coverage of our star, capturing one image every 12 seconds in 10 different wavelengths. The collection of images chronicles the sun’s rise toward solar maximum, the peak of solar activity in its regular 11-year cycle. Repeatedly caught in the act were solar flares and coronal mass ejections, powerful eruptions that can send radiation and solar material toward Earth and interfere with satellite operations in space. SDO’s constant monitoring of the sun help scientists understand what causes these giant explosions—with the goal of someday improving our ability to predict this space weather. Watch the video to see a time-lapse sequence of SDO observations that spans three years in the life of the sun. ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nID: 11255 Produced Video\n\nThree Years of SDO Images\n\nApril 22, 2013\n\nIn the three years since it first provided images of the sun in the spring of 2010, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has had virtually unbroken coverage of the sun's rise toward solar maximum, the peak of solar activity in its regular 11-year cycle. This video shows those three years of the sun at a pace of two images per day. Each image is displayed for two frames at a 29.97 frame rate.SDO's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) captures a shot of the sun every 12 seconds in 10 different wavelengths. The images shown here are based on a wavelength of 171 angstroms, which is in the extreme ultraviolet range and shows solar material at around 600,000 Kelvin. In this wavelength it is easy to see the sun's 25-day rotation as well as how solar activity has increased over three years.During the course of the video, the sun subtly increases and decreases in apparent size. This is because the distance between the SDO spacecraft and the sun varies over time. The image is, however, remarkably consistent and stable despite the fact that SDO orbits the Earth at 6,876 miles per hour and the Earth orbits the sun at 67,062 miles per hour.Such stability is crucial for scientists, who use SDO to learn more about our closest star. These images have regularly caught solar flares and coronal mass ejections in the act, types of space weather that can send radiation and solar material toward Earth and interfere with satellites in space. SDO's glimpses into the violent dance on the sun help scientists understand what causes these giant explosions — with the hopes of some day improving our ability to predict this space weather.The four wavelength view at the end of the video shows light at 4500 angstroms, which is basically the visible light view of the sun, and reveals sunspots; light at 193 angstroms which highlights material at 1 million Kelvin and reveals more of the sun's corona; light at 304 angstroms which highlights material at around 50,000 Kelvin and shows features in the transition region and chromosphere of the sun; and light at 171 angstroms.Noteworthy events that appear briefly in the main sequence of this video:00:30;24 Partial eclipse by the moon00:31;16 Roll maneuver01:11;02 August 9, 2011 X6.9 Flare, currently the largest of this solar cycle01:28;07 Comet Lovejoy, December 15, 201101:42;29 Roll Maneuver01:51;07 Transit of Venus, June 5, 201202:28;13 Partial eclipse by the moonWatch this video on YouTube. ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nPREVIOUS SOLAR CYCLES\n\nID: 4907 Visualization\n\nA Big Sunspot from Solar Cycle 24\n\nJune 18, 2021\n\nA large sunspot rotates across the view in SDO/HMI || BigSunspot_HMIintensity_stand.HD1080i.00300_print.jpg (1024x576) [50.6 KB] || BigSunspot_HMIintensity_stand.HD1080i.00300_searchweb.png (320x180) [21.8 KB] || BigSunspot_HMIintensity_stand.HD1080i.00300_thm.png (80x40) [2.6 KB] || 1920x1080_16x9_30p (1920x1080) [64.0 KB] || BigSunspot_HMIintensity.HD1080i_p30.mp4 (1920x1080) [29.1 MB] || BigSunspot_HMIintensity.HD1080i_p30.webm (1920x1080) [2.2 MB] || 3840x2160_16x9_30p (3840x2160) [64.0 KB] || BigSunspot_HMIintensity.UHD2160_p30.mp4 (3840x2160) [171.4 MB] ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nID: 4246 Visualization\n\nThe Big Sunspot of 2014\n\nFebruary 11, 2015\n\nThe view from the SDO AIA 171 angstrom filter of AR 12192 moving across the solar disk. || Oct2014BigSpot_171A_stand.HD1080i.01300_print.jpg (1024x576) [64.8 KB] || Oct2014BigSpot_171A_stand.HD1080i.01300_searchweb.png (320x180) [44.4 KB] || Oct2014BigSpot_171A_stand.HD1080i.01300_web.png (320x180) [44.4 KB] || Oct2014BigSpot_171A_stand.HD1080i.01300_thm.png (80x40) [4.1 KB] || Oct2014BigSpot_171A.HD1080.mov (1920x1080) [218.3 MB] || Oct2014BigSpot_171AHD (1920x1080) [256.0 KB] || Oct2014BigSpot_171A_stand_HD1080.mp4 (1920x1080) [73.8 MB] || Oct2014BigSpot_171A.HD1080.webm (1920x1080) [9.1 MB] ||\n\nGo to this page\n\nID: 4151 Visualization\n\nLooking Back: The Record Flare for Solar Cycle 24\n\nMay 16, 2014\n\nOn August 9, 2011 at 3:48 a.m. EDT, the sun emitted an Earth-directed X6.9 flare, as measured by the NOAA GOES satellite.

The cycle is marked by the increase and decrease of sunspots — visible as dark blemishes on the sun's surface, or photosphere. The greatest number of sunspots in any given solar cycle is designated as \"solar maximum.\" The lowest number is \"solar minimum.\" The solar cycle provides more than just increased sunspots, however. In the sun's atmosphere, or corona, bright active regions appear, which are rooted in the lower sunspots. Scientists track the active regions since they are often the origin of eruptions on the sun such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections. The most recent solar minimum occurred in 2008, and the sun began to ramp up in January 2010, with an M-class flare (a flare that is 10 times less powerful than the largest flares, labeled X-class). The sun has continued to get more active, with the next solar maximum predicted for 2013.

The sequence is projected in cylindrical-equidistant (CED) coordinates suitable for reprojection on spheres for animation or visualization purposes. These images are not suitable for scientific analysis.The original data were collected in FITS format from the SOHO/MDI archive, one image for each Carrington Rotation, which are 27.2753 days long.Solar minimum for Cycle 23 was in May 1996 (Carrington Rotation #1909), solar maximum around March 2000 (Carrington Rotation #1960), with a return to minimum about October 2008 (Carrington Rotation #2075). There are two gaps in the sequence, totalling four rotations, at Carrington rotations #1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, and 1998. These images are missing from the sequence due to SOHO being offline. Gaps in the data coverage for individual maps (occasional day outages or poor coverage near the poles of the Sun) were filled using data accumulated from previous maps.IMPORTANT NOTE: These images are for visualization purposes only.

There are dark regions at the top and bottom of the Sun (corresponding to the north and south solar poles) created by solar magnetic field lines that connect to the interstellar magnetic field. A similar dark region, below the solar equator, is called a coronal hole, where open magnetic field lines enable particles to stream away at high speeds. ||\n\nGo to this page"
