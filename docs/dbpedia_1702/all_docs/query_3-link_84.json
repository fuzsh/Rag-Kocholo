        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nIn the 90s most songs were about 5 min long and mostly in 00s it was 4 to 5 min long. Now right now, a lot of songs barely even reach 3 minutes and now you would be lucky to find a song longer than 4 minutes.\n\nShould songs go back to being longer than 4 minutes?\n\nPost by Sherane Lamar on\n\nI have a playlist of every charting song since about December 2015 (when my daughter was born :3). The playlist includes 883 songs and is 54 hours and 11 minutes long.\n\nThat puts the average song that has charted in the last 2 years at... 3.68 minutes!\n\nOr to put it in a more familiar notation: 3:41\n\nSo you are correct that the average song is not more than 4 minutes long.\n\nI don't have any actual data from other time periods, but I know that songs were very short in the 1960's compared to more modern times.\n\nThere's a full graph out there somewhere of the average song length of the songs to make the year end Top 100. I'm pretty sure it only goes to 2007 or something though. I'm sure somebody here will post it.\n\nPost by irice22 on\n\nI would hardly say in any era were songs mostly five minutes long. Are wet talking Top 40s? 3-4 minutes seems to be the standard in most decades.\n\nThat's not to say you weren't more likely to hear a seven minute radio hit in the 1970's. That won't ever happen again.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nIt may be just me, but with few exceptions (like Free Bird) I don't like when a song has more than 6min, but they can always make another version shorter. 3-4min is perfect. I don't like either when a song is only 2min, feels lazy but maybe it's an approach to get more streams - people can hear the same song twice the same time they can hear a 4min song only once\n\nPost by yuh yuh on\n\nI actually like shorter songs more because if they will be going on for too long, they start to annoy me. And when a song does not last too long then I will get more the effect of \"wanting to hear it again\". Of course it depends on a song.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nA lot of the rap songs I listen to are really short, especially the ones by SoundCloud rappers. But there are long ones too, such as my favorite song off Kodak Black's new album.\n\nPost by Mirago on\n\nThat puts the average song that has charted in the last 2 years at... 3.68 minutes!\n\nOr to put it in a more familiar notation: 3:41\n\nIsn't it for promo, mostly? Many songs since the 80s and onwards been edited down to that very close amount of time if their original version exists at over 4:40+ minutes..and they want to push the song? It doesn't matter for radio anymore that much but the idea still serves as keeping a song sent for promo to a shorter length to entice quicker. I love it when a song I love is over 6+ minutes and I'm served a hot edit of it too.\n\nPost by willapted33 on\n\nI don't really care what length a song is\n\nI love Humble and My Sh*t which are both below 3 minutes\n\nI love DNA, XO Tour Llif3 and Unforgettable which are all between 3 and 5 minutes\n\nI love Runaway, Pyramids and Sing About Me I'm Dying of Thirst which are all over 9 minutes (i think Runaway is at least)\n\nPost by ðŸ…³ðŸ…¸ðŸ†‚ðŸ…²ðŸ…¾ on\n\n@walker9 said:\n\nIn the 90s most songs were about 5 min long\n\nWhat?\n\nMore of the songs were 5 minutes or more in their album/LP versions and then there were the shorter radio edits. But there were still some that were at 5 more minutes even in their radio edits (Madonna's \"Frozen\", Celine Dion's \"To Love You More\", and Meat Loaf's \"I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)\" for example).\n\nThe album versions are shorter now for the most part too.\n\nPost by Rose \"Payola\" Nylund on\n\nMore of the songs were 5 minutes or more in their album/LP versions and then there were the shorter radio edits. But there were still some that were at 5 more minutes even in their radio edits (Madonna's \"Frozen\", Celine Dion's \"To Love You More\", and Meat Loaf's \"I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)\" for example).\n\nThe album versions are shorter now for the most part too.\n\nIt was more common for songs to be 5 minutes but not most of them. I agree that hits are shorter now, closer to 3 minutes rather than 3.5 to 4 minutes which seemed more normal in the 90s and 2000s.\n\nPost by dremolus - solarpunk on\n\nIt's so funny people are only complaining about short pop songs now and thinking it's just because of TikTok\n\nGo back to the 50s and 60s, more often than not, a single will not cross the 3 minute mark and some don't even pass 2:30"
