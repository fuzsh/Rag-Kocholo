I will only post changes and additions.\n\nNew Anvils\n\n-Silver cost for using increased from 2x to 3x.\n\n-Ruby Anvil requirement increased from 1 to 2 for Glacia Anvil only.\n\n-Brikynite requirement decreased from 5 to 3 for Glacia Anvil only.\n\nSkill Scrolls\n\n-No longer usable in Guild Territory Wars.\n\nBoss Co-op Block Change\n\n-When a boss blocks your attacks, the damage number will be displayed in blue.\n\nWhite Witch’s Forest (Legend)\n\n-The Skill Factors of the attacks of Glacia and Pbeta have been reduced by 20% to compensate for the decrease in Magic Shield effectiveness.\n\nWizard\n\nMagic Shield’s damage reduction bonus is being decreased, while the party damage reduction has been significantly decreased. Alongside this change, we’ve lowered the damage of monsters in the current main PvE content.\n\nMagic Shield\n\n-The Skill Factor has been changed.\n\nCurrent: Reduces damage received by [5 + SkillLevel * 3%] (up to 20%)\n\nAfter Change: Reduces damage received by [SkillLevel * 3%] (up to 15%)\n\nMagic Shield: Protect Party\n\n-No longer reduces buff duration down to 5 minutes.\n\n-Now reduces the effectiveness of Magic Shield to 50% of its current damage reduction.\n\n-If this attribute is disabled, the buff is removed.\n\nFeatherfoot\n\nFeatherfoot’s ability to recover HP through Blood Sucking, Blood Bath, Blood Curse, etc. provides the ability to sustain their life in a way that far exceeds other defensive and healing based classes in certain content. Therefore, we are lowering its healing, while enabling dashing and jumping during Levitation: Control to improve control convenience and maneuverability.\n\nBlood Sucking\n\n-The HP recovery method and its healing amount have been changed.\n\nCurrent: Heal caster’s HP equal to 50% of damage dealt\n\nAfter Change: Heal 3% of caster’s HP every 1 second while using Blood Sucking\n\nBlood Bath\n\n-The healing amount has been changed.\n\nCurrent: Heal HP equal 10% of caster’s Magic Attack every 0.4 seconds for 7 seconds\n\nAfter Change: Heal 0.5% of caster’s HP every 0.4 seconds for 7 seconds\n\nBlood Curse\n\n-The HP recovery method and its healing amount have been changed.\n\nCurrent: When attacking an enemy inflicted by the Blood Curse debuff, heal HP equal to [10 + SkillLevel * 2]% of damage dealt\n\nAfter Change: When using Blood Curse, the caster will recover 6% of max HP every 1 second for 10 seconds, and allies will heal 1% of their max HP every 1 second for 10 seconds\n\nLevitation: Control\n\n-No longer prevents dashing and jumping.\n\n-Duration increased to 30 minutes.\n\nAppraiser\n\nA character with Appraiser in their build should be weaker in solo play than another character that uses a damage dealing class instead of Appraiser, so we’ve adjusted Appraiser so that it will still be useful in a party situation but not as effective solo.\n\nBlindside\n\n-The increase to Minimum Critical Chance has been changed.\n\nCurrent: [5 + SkillLevel]% (Total 20%)\n\nAfter Change: [3 + ((Skill Level - 1) * 0.5)]% (Total 10%)\n\n-Cooldown increased from 5 seconds to 30 seconds.\n\n-Overheat decreased from 3 to 1.\n\n[Arts] Blindside: Focus\n\n-Final damage bonus decreased from 30% to 10%.\n\n-The 25 second increase to cooldown has been removed.\n\nFletcher\n\nWe’ve determined that a large cause of intermittent lag in party play is due to an excessive number of buff updates tied to the attribute [Fletcher: Improved Arrowheads], so we will be changing the effect as follows.\n\nFletcher: Improved Arrowheads\n\n-Buff duration increased from 10 seconds to 20 seconds.\n\n-When the buff is stacked to 10, it will only be refreshed when the duration falls below 5 seconds.\n\nZealot\n\nWe have no problem with the increase in personal performance granted to Zealots by using [Blind Faith: Holy Impact]. However, its potency when being shared to the party is superior when compared to other buffs and debuffs, so we will limit the effect granted to party members.\n\nBlind Faith: Holy Impact\n\n-The bonus granted to the caster and party members has been adjusted to be applied differently between them.\n\nCaster: Increases final damage dealt upon dealing a critical strike by [AttributeLevel * 10]% (Total 50%)\n\nParty: Increases final damage dealt upon dealing a critical strike by [AttributeLevel * 3]% (Total 15%)\n\nKabbalist\n\nGevura, which has the ability to completely reset a skill’s cooldown to 0 when certain conditions are met, is being weakened to only decrease cooldowns by a certain percentage. To go along with this change, we are applying a separate buff to the party when using Ein Sof that will provide a cooldown reduction effect, giving you the option to use Gevura + Ein Sof to substitute in place of a Dievdirbys.\n\nGevura\n\n-The cooldown reduction function has been changed as follows.\n\nCurrent: Reset the cooldown time of the 30th hitting skill\n\nAfter Change: Reduce cooldown of the 30th hitting skill by 30%\n\n-Gevura’s cooldown has been increased from 30 seconds to 1 minute and 15 seconds.\n\nEin Sof\n\n-When using Ein Sof, an additional buff is granted to the party that provides 10% cooldown reduction for 1 minute and 30 seconds. The Statue of Goddess Laima buff and this new cooldown reduction buff cannot stack.\n\nPardoner\n\nThe Discerning Evil debuff is being changed to not have its duration increased by the effects of Discerning Evil itself. This is to correct an issue where the Discerning Evil debuff is transferred with an abnormal duration to nearby targets when an enemy enters a Holy-property magic circle.\n\nDiscerning Evil\n\n-The debuff has been changed so it cannot receive the duration increasing effect from Discerning Evil."
