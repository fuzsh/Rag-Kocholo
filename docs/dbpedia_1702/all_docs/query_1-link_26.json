Research Purpose and Objectives\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has identified digital copyright infringement as a challenge to the continued growth and success of the digital economy (Piracy of Digital Content, 2009; Enquiries into Intellectual Property's Economic Impact, 2015). It also recognizes that a lack of relevant data about digital copyright infringement creates a significant challenge when it comes to policy development across jurisdictions (OECD, 2015). Not unlike many jurisdictions, Canada faces similar challenges developing copyright policy due to a lack of relevant data about digital copyright infringement.\n\nIn light of this, Innovation Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) in collaboration with the Department of Canadian Heritage (PCH) sought impartial data on what Canadians' behaviours and attitudes were in relation to the consumption of copyrighted content online.\n\nMore specifically, ISED and PCH wanted to understand the prevalence of online copyright infringement among music, movie, TV shows, video games, computer software and e-books. ISED and PCH also sought data on the attitudes and conditions that drive such behaviour as well as the effectiveness of Canada's copyright framework to create a healthy environment for investment while allowing consumer choice and access.\n\nThe overall purpose of the research was to:\n\nSupport policy making with impartial data on copyright infringement in Canada that is comparable with similar countries;\n\nSupport the parliamentary review of the Copyright Act with evidence that is neutral and evaluates the effectiveness of existing copyright infringement deterrents; and\n\nRaise awareness among Canadians of copyright norms and values.\n\nThe specific research objectives included:\n\nMeasuring online consumption among Canadians aged 12+ of six content types: music, movies, TV shows, video games, e-books and software;\n\nMeasuring levels of copyright infringement for each of the above-mentioned content types;\n\nDetermining Canadians' attitudes toward copyright infringement;\n\nMonitoring awareness and effectiveness of education and information; and\n\nDetermining awareness and attitudes toward the availability of legal alternatives to infringing content.\n\nThe findings of this research will be used to help policy makers evaluate how Canada's Copyright Act is keeping pace with an ever-changing technological environment and evolving marketplace. This research will provide the necessary information required to further develop copyright policy in Canada, as well as to provide a foundation to assess the effectiveness of the measures to address copyright infringement, should future analysis be undertaken.\n\n1.2. Summary of Findings\n\n1.2.1. Digital Content Consumption\n\nTwenty-eight million Canadians used the Internet in the 3-month period ending on November 27, 2017. Of those, twenty-two million (80%) consumedFootnote 1 digital content. During this period, twenty million (73%) Canadian Internet users streamed or accessed content, 16 million (59%) downloaded content, and 8 million (28%) shared content.\n\nConsumption levels varied across content types with music (48%), TV shows (48%) and movies (46%) being consumed most often online. Respondents consumed a median of 20 files online in the past three months.\n\n1.2.2. Payment\n\nAmong those who consume digital content online, about half (52%) reported that they consumed only free content in the past three months.\n\nMany respondents who paid for content (23%), whether digital or physical, in the past three months had previously consumed some of that content for free online. More than one-in-ten (13%) had consumed all of it for free online before purchasing. On average, Canadians report consuming online an average of 16 files (any type of content) for free prior to purchase in the past three months.\n\n1.2.3. Levels of Copyright Infringement\n\nThree-quarters (74%) of respondents who consumed any content online in the past three months reported doing so only legally in the past three months. One-quarter (26%) of content consumers reported having consumed at least one illegal file online in the past three months. However, only a few consumers (5%) consumed all their files online illegally. E-books (70%) and music (68%) were most likely to be consumed legally online, while movies (36%), software (36%), TV shows (34%) and video games (33%) were most likely to be consumed illegally.\n\nFew demographic factors play a role with regard to consuming infringing content online. We explored the relationship between gender, region, rural and urban, income, employment status and language. We found that only age and income varied significantly between consumers who infringed by downloading or streaming/accessing content online illegally and consumers who did not consume infringing content online. More specifically, the profile of consumers who downloaded or streamed/accessed infringing content skewed slightly younger and towards individuals with household incomes of $100K+.\n\n1.2.4. Services Used for Consuming Content Online\n\nConsumers used a variety of services over the past three months to consume or share content online. Netflix is the service used most by online content consumers, with close to two-thirds (64%) having used it in the past three months. Websites that offer free content are also popular with online consumers. One third (36%) of online content consumers have used YouTube in the past three months, while approximately one-quarter have used Facebook (28%).\n\nOf note among the top 10 services is the prominence of streaming sites such as Netflix, YouTube, Google Play, Spotify and Amazon Prime, reflecting how streaming is becoming a stronger player in consumption than it has been in the past. Another notable finding is the popularity of websites that collect links to free streams (e.g., watch-series) (23%). These websites often link to other sites that are not licensed or authorized to make available certain content.\n\nWhen we look at services from a category perspective, rather than individual sites, we see that three-quarters of online content consumers (74%) used licensed services, while 42 per cent used social network services to consume content online. One-third (31%) of online content consumers used a variety of peer-to-peer, cyberlocker, or linking sites. Nine per cent of online consumers used stream-ripping services in the past three months. Consumers who reported downloading or streaming/accessing infringing content only are less likely to use licensed services and more likely to use peer-to-peer/cyberlocker/linking sites than other consumers of online content.\n\n1.2.5. Consumption Volumes\n\nThe majority of content is consumed digitally across content types, except for books where physical copies remain more common than e-books. Looking at the ratio of paid versus free digital content we find that for music, TV shows and software the majority is consumed for free (63%, 62% and 69% respectively) while for movies, e-books and video games consumption is close to evenly split between paid and free content. Furthermore, the large majority of digital content consumed is done so legally for all content types.\n\n1.2.6. Quarterly Spending\n\nOn average, Canadians spent $176 on the six content types in the past three months. Across the content types, music has the highest average quarterly spending ($64), followed by movies ($35), video games ($28), books ($22), software ($16) and TV shows ($11).\n\nFor almost all content types, physical purchases are undertaken in larger proportions than digital purchases, except for TV shows, where physical and digital are undertaken in similar proportions (10% and 11%, respectively).\n\nWhen looking at this from a population perspective, we estimate that Canadians aged 12+ spent a total of $5.4 billion on the six content types covered in the survey, including both digital content, physical purchases and tickets to live performances in the past three months. Interestingly, Canadians aged 12+ spend more on content in physical formats and live performances ($4,310m) than they do on digital content and online subscriptions ($1,043m).\n\nLooking again at spending across content types, music has the highest overall quarterly spending, estimated at $1,938m, followed by movies ($1,072m), video games ($860m), books ($664m), computer software ($477m) and TV shows ($345m).\n\n1.2.7. Attitudes Towards Digital Consumption and Copyright Infringement\n\nThis research also explored a variety of attitudes related to consumption of copyrighted content online, including motivations for paying for content, for sharing content online, and for obtaining illegal content instead of paying.\n\nConvenience (48%), speed (36%) and quality (34%) are the main reasons consumers mentioned paying for online content. One in three content consumers also stated that they pay for content because they do not want to use illegal sites. When looking at content sharing the motivations are more varied, with ease (39%) being the top reason. One in four consumers (26%) simply feel that \"it is only fair\" to share content, while twenty two percent help friends and family as they do not know how to access files. Consumers also report that they share content because everyone else does (24%) and that they should be able to share content with whoever they choose (19%). Interestingly, for the most part, motivations for sharing are no different between consumers who infringed and those who did not infringe.\n\nOne in two consumers (54%) who infringed in the last three months reported obtaining online content illegally instead of paying for it mostly due to it being free. Other primary motivations are ease or convenience (40%) and the fact that it is quick (34%). Lower costs (58%) and legal availability of content (47%) would encourage consumers who infringe to stop downloading or streaming files illegally.\n\n1.2.8. Knowledge of Legal and Illegal Online Content\n\nMost Canadian internet users (83%) are confident (very or slightly) in knowing what is legal and what isn't in terms of downloading, streaming/accessing and sharing content online. However, Canadians who admit to consuming infringing material online are less confident in what is legal, including both those who consume a mix of legal and illegal content (62%) and those who only consumed infringing content (58%).\n\nAspects of a website that make Canadian internet users confident that it is legal include their view that it is trusted or secure (33%), that it requires payments or subscriptions to access content (14%), and that it provides authorization to download files (10%).\n\n1.2.9. Infringement Notices\n\nIn Canada, a copyright owner who thinks a person's internet account has been used to violate or \"infringe\" their copyright (e.g., by downloading or uploading the material without permission) can send a notice of alleged infringement to the Internet Service Provider (ISP). The ISP must then forward this notice to the person associated with the account that is suspected of being used to infringe copyright.\n\nTen percent of Canadian online consumers over the age of 12 have received a notice from their ISP that their account had been used to infringe copyright. Respondents reported that receiving such a notice resulted in the following: increased awareness of copyright infringement (38%), taking steps to ensure password protected home networks (27%), a household discussion about copyright infringement (27%), and discontinuing illegal downloading or streaming (24%). Close to a quarter of those who received an infringement notice (24%) reported that they simply ignored it.\n\n1.2.10. Stream-Ripping\n\nStream-ripping allows a person to turn a file being played on a streaming platform, such as Spotify or YouTube, into one that can be downloaded and kept permanently on a device. Stream-ripping has seen considerable uptake and popularity over the past few years, with reports of growth by up to 141 per cent over a two-year period from 2014 to 2016 in the UK according to a 2017 study.\n\nA preliminary look at stream-ripping in Canada provides a demographic profile of those who use stream-ripping and the services used to undertake such activity.\n\nIn Canada, 11 per cent of internet users reported using stream-ripping services. Relative to total internet users, users of stream-ripping are more likely to be male (62%) and are predominately 18 to 34 (52%) years of age. They are more likely to live in British Columbia (18%) and less likely to live in Quebec (18%), and are also more likely to be English speakers (81%).\n\nAmong Canadians who have used a service to stream-rip music or entertainment, nearly half (48%) have used stream-ripping sites, one-third have used downloader apps (38%), one-in-seven (14%) have used a stream-ripping plug-in, and one-in-ten (10%) have used stream-ripping software.\n\n1.2.11. Virtual Private Networks and TV Set-top Boxes\n\nTwenty one percent of internet users aged 12+ reported using virtual private network (VPN) services, while ten percent reported using TV set-top boxes. Individuals who consumed a mix of legal and illegal content online are more likely to use VPN services (42%) or TV set-top boxes (21%) than consumers who only downloaded or streamed/accessed legal content.\n\nCanadian internet users who use VPN services primarily use these to secure communications and internet browsing (57%). Some use it to access free content (36%), while others use it to access content from other countries that is not available in Canada (32%), or to access content at a reasonable price (27%).\n\nMost Canadians who use TV set-top boxes report they use them to access content they have paid for (78%). Half also use set-top boxes to access legal content for free (53%) while another quarter (28%) use them to access content they personally own. A minority, use set-top boxes to access other content that is not legal or they are unsure if it is legal (16%), or to access live sports that are not legal or they are unsure if it is legal (11%).\n\n1.2.12. International Comparisons\n\nTo put these results into context, a comparison was made between Canada, Australia and the UK. It is important to keep in mind that country results can be influenced by a number of variables beyond copyright law, including differences in market size and structure, language, broadcasting and cultural policy, social norms or access to high-speed internet service.\n\nThe comparison indicates that a larger proportion of Canadian internet users (80%) consume (download or stream/access) any of the content types compared to Australia (69%) and the UK (59%). Streaming appears more widespread in Canada and in Australia than in the UK. While Canadians have similar streaming levels to Australians for music and TV shows, Australians are more likely to stream software, video games and e-books. Another interesting finding is that a larger proportion of Canadian internet users share content online, particularly music, movies, TV shows and e-books, compared to internet users in Australia and the UK.\n\nWhen comparing infringement results, Australian respondents (38%) are more likely to have infringed at least one type of content in the past three months than consumers in Canada (26%) and the UK (25%).\n\nThe comparison of average quarterly spending among all 12+ internet users across regions show that, at a total level, Canadian respondents, spend less on each content type than Australian respondents, but more than UK respondents.\n\n1.3. Methodology\n\nThe methodology used was based on the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) \"Online Copyright Infringement Tracker\" methodology and survey, adapting it to the Canadian context. This approach enabled an informed comparison of online consumption patterns and attitudes toward and prevalence of digital copyright infringement in Canada with that in the UK and Australia, which has also completed a similar survey. The Canadian survey was adapted to the Canadian context and included a telephone sample instead of the in-person sample collected in the UK. Furthermore, it included a detailed introduction that responds to anticipated concerns and sets the context of the questions, along with parental consent where and as required by the Government of Canada and the Marketing Research and Intelligence Association (MRIA).\n\nThe research asked respondents about their behaviours in the previous three months with online content and assessed the levels of infringement within wider patterns of consumer behaviour and content consumption. This methodology involved conducting 3,048 15-minute online questionnaires among those under the age of 65 years, complemented by 253 telephone survey completions among those aged 65+. This approach addressed the lack of national data related to frequency of internet usage that was available at time of design.\n\nA telephone pre-test was undertaken from October 30 to November 1, 2017, obtaining 10 English and 12 French completions, including probing questions. In addition, an online pre-test was undertaken on November 6, obtaining 10 English and 10 French completions, including probing questions. The necessary adjustments were made to the instruments and online fieldwork was conducted from November 7-27, 2017. In total 3,048 online surveys were completed. The telephone survey was conducted from November 10-20, 2017. In total, 253 telephone surveys were completed. The average survey length for the online and telephone surveys was 15 minutes.\n\nSampling was designed to obtain a sample of 3,250 Canadians; 3,000 aged 12 to 64 years via an online survey and 250 aged 65+ via a telephone survey.\n\nTo ensure large enough base sizes for regional analyses, we implemented separate and disproportionate regional and proportionate age quotas. For the online sample, a regionally disproportionate sample of Canadians was drawn from the Kantar TNS proprietary panel to achieve 3,000 completed surveys. The sample was stratified to ensure age and regional quotas were met. For the telephone portion of the survey, a landline sample was provided by an internal random number generator that randomizes the last four digits of the phone number based on known area code/exchange combinations. The person answering the phone was selected for the study if they were 65+ years of age. If they were not, the interviewer asked to speak with someone who was home and was 65+.\n\nThe online survey was conducted using computer assisted web interviewing (CAWI) technology while the telephone survey was conducted using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) technology. CAWI/CATI ensured the interview flowed as it should with pre-programmed skip patterns. It also controlled responses to ensure appropriate ranges and data validity. The CATI system also controls automated scheduling and call-backs to ensure all appointments are adhered to.\n\nWeighting adjustments were applied to the final edited, clean data to ensure that the data were representative of the 18+ population of Canada based on the 2016 Census. The data were weighted by age within gender and within region, and to match the Canadian population using 2016 Census data.\n\nA panel sample was used for the online portion of this study and, as such, margin of error does not apply. For the telephone portion of the survey, a sample of 253 aged 65+ drawn from the Canadian adult population would produce a margin of error of +/-6.2 per cent 19 times out of 20. Sub-groups have larger margins of error.\n\n1.4. Contract Value\n\nThe total contract value for this project was $94,920.00 including HST.\n\n1.5. Statement of Political Neutrality\n\nI hereby certify as Senior Research Director & Public Sector Practice Lead of Kantar TNS that the deliverables fully comply with the Government of Canada political neutrality requirements outlined in the Policy on Communications and Federal Identity and Procedures for Planning and Contracting Public Opinion Research. Specifically, the deliverables do not include information on electoral voting intentions, political party preferences and standings with the electorate or ratings of the performance of a political party or its leaders.\n\nTanya Whitehead\n\nKantar TNS\n\nSenior Research Director & Public Sector Practice Lead\n\n2. Foreword\n\n2.1. Background and Objectives\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has identified digital copyright infringement as a challenge to the continued growth and success of the digital economy (Piracy of Digital Content, 2009; Enquiries into Intellectual Property's Economic Impact, 2015). It also recognizes that a lack of relevant data about digital copyright infringement creates a significant challenge when it comes to policy development across jurisdictions (OECD, 2015). Not unlike many jurisdictions, Canada faces similar challenges developing copyright policy due to a lack of relevant data about digital copyright infringement.\n\nCanada has a number of legislative tools in the Copyright Act that help rights holders address online copyright infringement. In 2012, the Copyright Modernization Act introduced new tools to address online copyright infringement, including technological protection measures and a new legal remedy targeting those who enable others to engage in online copyright infringement. A new \"notice-and-notice\" system was also enacted to allow copyright owners to send notices of alleged copyright infringement to internet users via their Internet Service Provider (ISP). Furthermore, the Copyright Act requires Parliament to review the Act every five years. The House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology is currently undertaking such a review and it is expected that online copyright infringement will be discussed. There is currently little available data about online copyright infringement in Canada or the effectiveness of existing copyright infringement prevention tools in the Copyright Act. In order to better facilitate the development of copyright policy in Canada and ensure that the policy is evidence-based, and to support the statutorily mandated Parliamentary review of the Copyright Act, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) in collaboration with the Department of Canadian Heritage (PCH) sought impartial data on what Canadians' behaviours and attitudes were in relation to the consumption of copyrighted content online.\n\nMore specifically, ISED and PCH wanted to understand the prevalence of online copyright infringement among music, movie, TV shows, video games, computer software and e-books. ISED and PCH also sought data on:\n\nWhat attitudes and conditions drive such behaviours; and\n\nThe effectiveness of Canada's copyright framework to create a healthy environment for investment while allowing consumer choice and access.\n\nWhile various industry groups have prepared the statistics on online copyright infringement that are currently available, each set differs in the method of its preparation. The methodology employed is also, in many cases, untested. The following study contributes to a holistic view of online copyright infringement by measuring perceived levels of use (legal versus illegal) and levels of access (streaming, downloading and sharing) of six core content types (music, movies, TV shows, computer software, e-books and video games). This research will provide the necessary information required to further develop copyright policy in Canada, as well as to provide a foundation to assess the effectiveness of the measures to address copyright infringement, should future analysis be undertaken. The study was conducted with reference to a similar study conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia in order to capitalize on a tried and tested methodology and research instrument, as well as allowing Canada's results to be compared to other jurisdictions.\n\nResearch Objectives\n\nThe overall purpose of the research was to:\n\nSupport policy making with impartial data on copyright infringement in Canada that is comparable with similar countries;\n\nSupport the parliamentary review of the Copyright Act with evidence that is neutral and evaluates the effectiveness of existing copyright infringement deterrents; and\n\nRaise awareness among Canadians of copyright norms and values.\n\nThe specific research objectives included:\n\nMeasuring online consumption among Canadians aged 12+ of music, movies, TV shows, video games, e-books and software;\n\nMeasuring levels of copyright infringement for each of the above-mentioned content types;\n\nDetermining Canadians' attitudes toward copyright infringement;\n\nMonitoring awareness and effectiveness of education and information; and\n\nDetermining awareness and attitudes toward the availability of legal alternatives to infringing content.\n\n2.2. Methodological Overview\n\nThis study used the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office's (UKIPO) \"Online Copyright Infringement Tracker\" methodology and survey as the basis for this study and adapted it to the Canadian context.\n\nThe 2017 Online Copyright Infringement Tracker was used as the starting point for the survey design. Based on the objectives of the research and discussion with the Project Authority, Kantar TNS revised the questionnaire to meet a 15-minute maximum survey length. The resulting survey comprised 111 questions that were primarily closed-ended. A pre-test was undertaken on October 30, 2017 for the telephone survey and on November 6, 2017 for the online survey, obtaining at least 10 English and 10 French completions in each mode, including probing questions. The results were reviewed to ensure the survey was working as expected and that the questions were being interpreted as expected. Based on the results of the pre-test, minimal changes were required for the survey and, as such, the results of the completed pre-tests were included in the final data set.\n\nThe methodology involved conducting 3,048 15-minute online questionnaires among those less than 65 years of age, complemented by 253 telephone survey completions among those over 65 years of age. This approach addressed the lack of national data available at the time of design related to frequency of internet usage. Given that, at the time of the survey, we did not know the true online versus offline split among the 65+ age group, we would have had a significant weighting issue when dealing with this age group. By having 65+ all interviewed by telephone, we no longer needed to be concerned about the correct split since we expected to get a good estimate of the online versus offline split from the telephone sample. For Canadians less than 65 years old, the proportion that is online is so high (94%) that it was believed that we could achieve a representative sample by only contacting them online.\n\nA panel sample was used for the online portion of this study and, as such, margin of error does not apply. For the telephone portion of the survey, a sample of 253 aged 65+ drawn from the Canadian adult population would produce a margin of error of +/-6.2 per cent 19 times out of 20. Sub-groups have larger margins of error.\n\nFor the online sample, a regionally disproportionate sample of Canadians from the general population aged 18 years and older was drawn to achieve 3,000 completed surveys, while a random sample was used for the telephone portion of the survey. All samples were obtained from Kantar TNS's proprietary online panel. Children aged 12-17 were recruited through their parents on the panel. Panelists who had children 12-17 were asked permission for their child 12-17 to participate. The survey was conducted from November 7 to November 27, 2017. In total 3,301 surveys were completed. The average survey length was 15 minutes.\n\nIn this report, quantitative results are expressed as percentages unless otherwise noted. Results may not add to 100% due to rounding or multiple responses. Net results cited in the text may not exactly match individual results shown in the tables due to rounding.\n\nA detailed description of the methodology can be found in Chapter 11.\n\n2.2.1. Sub-group Analyses\n\nAnalysis was undertaken to establish the extent of the relationship among variables such as gender, age, region, income, language, etc. Only differences significant at the 95% confidence level are presented in this report. Any differences that are statistically significant between sub-groups are indicated with an asterisk (*) in tables throughout the report.\n\n2.2.2. The Limitations of Claimed Behaviour and Data Reconciliation\n\nAs outlined in the UK and Australian reports, \"consumer research provides one source of insight into the extent and patterns of online content consumption\". Other potential sources include analysis of ISP internet traffic, industry sales and revenue data, internet audience analysis and direct measurement of online activity (for example, by monitoring activity on file-sharing networks). On their own, none of these sources presents a complete picture of the market, and each has strengths and weaknesses. The data presented in this report (particularly consumption volumes and consumer spending) are not directly comparable to published industry sales data. Wide variations in notionally similar figures should be expected for many reasons, including:\n\nDifferences in methodological approach\n\nExtent of market coverage\n\nSeasonality and timing of research\n\nInclusion or exclusion of taxes\n\nInclusion of sales of second-hand material\n\nIt is also particularly important to note that figures in this report are based on the \"claimed\" numbers collected from a random sample of people in this survey. These data were then grossed up to reflect the Canadian 12+ population. There was a wide variance in the numbers and this reflects the behaviour indicated by a subsection of the Canadian population aged 12+ within the time periods asked about. Furthermore, questions on illegal behaviour have a reliance on honesty, which is also likely to affect accuracy to some degree, that is, to result in under-claim for illegal behaviour. The methodology used has gone to significant lengths to ensure that honesty was encouraged (to ensure that the data collected were as accurate as possible) by using indirect lines of questioning when calculating illegal activity. These measures are discussed in more detail throughout this report.\n\n2.2.3. Reporting Averages and the Issue of Outliers\n\nTo be consistent with the UK methodology, when reporting on volumes consumed (or shared), certain metrics are reported differently for this study and include both mean and median.\n\nFor core metrics covering average volumes of files downloaded / streamed, paid for /obtained for free, and obtained legally / illegally in the past three months, we report only on medians. The reason for this is that due to the nature of online behaviours, and the continuous scale for responses to these questions, the resultant mean scores are highly influenced by a few respondents with high levels of activity. Thus, the mean volumes can be volatile from one wave to the next for all content types covered, reducing the confidence with which we can infer trends for these figures. This approach is consistent with the UK and Australian methodologies, so allows for comparisons across jurisdictions.\n\nFor the two metrics covering physical ownership of digital content consumed, and the previous free consumption of paid-for content, we revert to the standard mean. The reason for this is to be consistent with the UK and to allow for jurisdictional comparisons.\n\n2.2.4. Content Types and Activities Assessed\n\nAs with the UK study, this study sought to undertake measurements for six core content types:\n\nMusic\n\nMovies\n\nTV Shows\n\nComputer Software\n\ne-Books\n\nVideo Games\n\nThe questions in this study focused on streaming or accessing, downloading and/or sharing online behaviours, and were defined as follows:\n\nStreamed or Accessed – By this we mean viewing, listening or playing content online without downloading a copy. For example, watching TV shows on Netflix or listening to music through services such as Spotify.\n\nDownloaded – By this we mean transferring a copy of the file from the internet to a device. For example, downloading a music track to a computer through iTunes.\n\nShared – By this we mean making the file publicly available, or sending or uploading it online for someone else to download or stream/access. For example, sharing files on a computer through an online service such as YouTube or a peer-to-peer service such as BitTorrent. This does not include sharing links online.\n\nThese categories all relate to \"digital\" content or files. There are, however, other metrics in the report that also incorporate consumer spending in physical formats (e.g., CDs, DVDs, paper books, tickets to see a concert or movie, etc.) to help understand the consumption of digital content in the wider context.\n\nFor many of the content types there are several elements that had the potential to cause confusion and thus distort the figures if misunderstood by the respondent. For example, there is a fine line between music tracks and music videos, and there is a distinct difference (in terms of number of digital files) between single music tracks and albums. Similarly, for software and video games, people may consider updates and patches as products in themselves. Therefore, we attempted to be as clear to respondents as possible in terms of what they should include in the definitions. The following outlines the definitions provided:\n\nMusic\n\nMusic tracks or albums (excluding online radio stations)\n\nMovies\n\nMovies\n\nTV Shows\n\nTV shows\n\nComputer software\n\nComputer software (excluding mobile phone apps, and patches and upgrades to software already owned)\n\ne-Books\n\ne-Books\n\nVideo games\n\nVideo games (excluding patches and upgrades)\n\n2.2.5. Payment and Legality\n\nRespondents who had consumed (i.e., streamed, accessed, or downloaded) digital content were asked in the survey how much of what they had consumed was paid for and how much was legal, and from this it is possible to calculate how much was free and how much was illegal respectively. Payment and legality were explained to respondents as follows:\n\nPayment – how many did they personally pay for, either as a one-off or as part of a subscription\n\nLegality – how many did they think were downloaded or streamed legally\n\nIt should be noted that a small but not insignificant proportion of the Canadian public (17%) are not confident they know what is legal and what is illegal in terms of downloading, streaming/accessing and sharing content through the internet (see Section 7.5). Therefore, in addition to some people being reluctant to admit to engaging in illegal activities, some people may not be aware that what they are doing is necessarily illegal, and hence, the level of illegal activity may be under-reported.\n\n2.2.6. Key Metrics\n\nWith respect to assessing levels of copyright infringement for each content category, the approach is consistent with the UK methodology. We filter down from general online behaviour toward the sensitive topic of infringement and illegal content. Within each category, we provide key metrics at two levels:\n\nRespondent level: The total number and proportion of the Canadian population who undertook an activity such as downloading music.\n\nVolume level: The number of music tracks downloaded in the past three months, or the number of music tracks legally obtained.\n\nThe key metrics throughout this report are summarized in the following table.\n\nTable 2.2.6 Key Metrics - Topic Respondent Level Volume Level Assessing levels of copyright infringement General Behaviour Done in the past three months, median volumes among those who have done the activity. - Payment Proportion of the population who fit into the following derived groups in terms of volume of content consumed in the past three months:\n\n100% paid\n\nMix of paid and free\n\n100% free\n\nAny free (combination of 2 + 3)\n\n100% previously downloaded for free (% of paid acquisitions across formats)\n\nAny previously downloaded for free\n\nNone previously downloaded for free\n\nAs well as the proportions of those who have done the activity in the past three months, metrics 1 to 4 are also reported among the total 12+ Canadian internet population and include median volumes. Paid and free proportions of total volume (incorporating physical format where relevant) Legality Proportion of the population who fit into the following derived groups in terms of volume of content consumed in the past three months:\n\n100% legal\n\nMix of legal and illegal\n\n100% illegal\n\nAny illegal (combination of 2 + 3)\n\nAs well as the proportions of those who have done the activity in the past three months, the above metrics are also reported among the total 12+ Canadian internet population and include median volumes. - Assessing consumer spending on categories Spending Proportion of the population who have spent anything (and average spending in the past three months) on digital subscriptions, individual digital downloads, physical formats and other related areas such as concerts or cinema tickets. Total volumes and proportions of overall spending\n\n3. Digital Content Consumption\n\n3.1. Digital Content Consumption Among Internet Users aged 12+ Across All Key Content Types\n\nThe following table outlines the proportion of internet users aged 12+ who downloaded, streamed/accessed, or shared content online for each of the six content types. The \"any\" column is an aggregation across the six content types (for example, if someone downloaded and streamed both music and movies, they would be counted only once within the overall proportion).\n\nTable 3.1a Digital behaviour in the last three months among internet users aged 12+ – all content types Digital Behaviour Content Type Music Movies TV Shows Computer\n\nSoftware e-Books Video\n\nGames Any Base= all internet users 12+ 3252 3252 3252 3252 3252 3252 3252 Download 29% 22% 18% 18% 17% 16% 59% Stream or access 40% 41% 44% 8% 8% 10% 73% Share 11% 7% 6% 3% 3% 3% 28% Download or stream/access, i.e. consumed 48% 46% 48% 20% 20% 20% 80% Download or stream/access or share 49% 47% 48% 21% 21% 21% 81%\n\nEight-in-ten (80%) (22 million) internet users have consumed (i.e. downloaded or streamed/accessed) digital content from one of the six content types in the past three months. Three-quarters (73%) (20 million) have streamed or accessed content and more than half (59%) (16 million) have downloaded content. Sharing content is less common, with slightly more than one-quarter (28%) (8 million) having shared content in the past three months.\n\nAmong the content types, music (48%), TV shows (48%) and movies (46%) are consumed (downloaded or streamed/accessed) most often online. The most common content types streamed or accessed are TV shows (44%) followed by movies (41%) and music (40%). Among downloads, music (29%) and movies (22%) are most commonly downloaded followed by TV shows (18%), software (18%), e-books (17%) and video games (16%).\n\nSharing also follows a similar pattern with music (11%), movies (7%) and TV shows (6%) being shared most often.\n\nThe following table outlines the median number of files downloaded, streamed/accessed, or shared in the past three months (among those who had undertaken each activity) for each of the content types. In the UK study, means were initially reported, but were found to be too volatile due to a minority of individuals consuming or sharing very large numbers of files, and hence, medians are now used instead. For comparability purposes, the Canadian study is also presenting medians.\n\nTable 3.1b Median number of files downloaded, streamed/accessed or shared in the past three months – all content types Digital Behaviour Content Type Music Movies TV Shows Computer\n\nSoftware e-Books Video\n\nGames Any Base=those who have downloaded in the previous three months 888 675 564 553 545 503 1834 Median Downloaded 12 2 1 1 2 2 6 Base=those who have streamed/ accessed in the previous three months 1225 1282 1357 231 259 326 2294 Median Streamed/accessed 20 5 5 1 1 2 14 Base=those who have shared in the previous three months 359 224 187 84 100 101 895 Median Shared 4 0 0 2 0 1 2 Base=those who have consumedFootnote 1 in the previous three months 1721 1658 1719 683 706 681 2728 Median Consumed: downloaded or streamed or accessed 20 6 6 2 2 3 20\n\nRespondents consumed (downloaded or streamed/accessed) a median of 20 files online in the past three months. This is largely driven by streaming or accessing, where a median of 14 files were streamed or accessed, followed by downloading (6).\n\nAmong the content types, music has the highest median consumption, be it downloads only (12), stream/access (20), or consume (download or stream/access) (20). This is likely due to the fact that music tracks were counted individually within this research. For example, each song or track on an album is counted. For all other content types, respondents report having downloaded a median of one or two files only.\n\nNot unexpectedly, streaming is highest for music (20), followed by movies and TV shows with a median of five files streamed or accessed each in the past three months.\n\nSharing is less common among respondents and is dominated by music (4), software (2) and video games (1) being shared in the past three months. Sharing is less common among movies, TV shows and e-books, which have a median of zero files being shared in the past three months.\n\n3.2. Payment Groups\n\nRespondents were categorized according to payment groups, that is, the proportion of digital content that they claimed to have paid for:\n\n100% paid\n\nMix of paid and free\n\n100% free\n\nThe following tables present the proportions for each payment group in terms of content accessed in the past three months, across two different groups:\n\nAll who downloaded or streamed/accessed each content type in the past three months\n\nAll internet users aged 12+\n\nThe second table with the base of all internet users aged 12+ has been included because the proportion of people active in each category varies between content types; looking at payment categories across the 12+ internet universe allows comparisons to be made between them.\n\nTable 3.2a Payment groups – proportion who paid to consume content or did so for free in the past three months Payment Groups Content Type Music Movies TV Shows Computer\n\nSoftware e-Books Video\n\nGames Any Base= all internet users 12+ 3252 3252 3252 3252 3252 3252 3252 100% paid 14% 23% 14% 5% 9% 10% 13% Mix of paid and free 7% 9% 5% 3% 2% 2% 28% 100% free 10% 12% 23% 6% 5% 5% 44% Any paid 22% 32% 19% 8% 11% 12% 41% Any free 18% 21% 28% 9% 7% 7% 72%\n\n72% of internet users consumed at least one of the content types online for free in the past three months.\n\nAmong the content types, TV shows are consumed for free most often online by internet users (28%), followed by movies (21%), music (18%), software (9%), e-books (7%) and video games (7%).\n\nAmong the content types, online movies are most likely to be 100% paid (23%) by internet users, followed by music (14%), TV shows (14%), video games (10%), e-books (9%) and software (5%).\n\nNearly a quarter (23%) of internet users consumed all of their online TV shows in the past three months for free (100% free), while approximately one-in-ten internet users consumed all of their movies (12%) and music (10%) online for free. One-in-twenty internet users consumed all of their software (6%), e-books (5%) or video games (5%) online for free in the past three months.\n\nTable 3.2b Payment groups – proportion who paid to consume content or did so for free in the past three months Payment Groups Content Type Music Movies TV Shows Computer\n\nSoftware e-Books Video\n\nGames Any Base= those who have consumedFootnote 1 in the previous three months 1721 1658 1719 683 706 681 2728 100% paid 44% 52% 34% 37% 54% 58% 15% Mix of paid and free 23% 20% 11% 18% 13% 12% 33% 100% free 32% 28% 55% 45% 33% 30% 52% Any paid 68% 72% 45% 55% 67% 70% 48% Any free 56% 48% 66% 63% 46% 42% 85%\n\nAbout half (52%) of content consumers reported that they consumed only free content online in the past three months. Consumption for free was highest for TV shows (55%) and computer software (45%). Consumers of video games and e-books tended to consume only paid content (58% and 54%, respectively) in the past three months.\n\nAmong those who consumed TV shows online, two-thirds (66%) consumed at least some content for free and more than half (55%) consumed all of it for free. Similar proportions exist with online consumers of software, where 63 per cent consumed at least some for free and close to half (45%) consumed all of their software for free in the past three months.\n\nAmong the remaining content types (music, movies, e-books and video games), approximately half of online consumers consumed at least some for free, while close to one-third of consumers consumed all of their online content for free.\n\n3.3. Free Access to Digital Content Before Purchasing\n\nThe following table presents results related to the proportions of people who previously consumed (downloaded or streamed/accessed) for free; content they purchased (digital or physical) in the past three months.\n\nTable 3.3 Consuming content online for free before purchasing in the past three months Prior Ownership Content Type Music Movies TV Shows Computer\n\nSoftware e-Books Vide\n\nGames Any Base=all who have paid for content in the past three months 946 1137 685 352 1164 704 3301Footnote 2 100% previously consumed for free 17% 14% 14% 24% 6% 16% 13% Any previously consumed for free 46% 27% 27% 53% 13% 38% 23% None previously consumed for free 54% 73% 73% 47% 87% 62% 77% MeanFootnote 3 28 2 5 3 1 3 16\n\nMany respondents (23%) who paid for content (digital or physical) in the past three months had previously consumed some of that content for free online. More than one-in-ten (13%) had consumed all of it for free online before purchasing.\n\nAmong the content types, consuming all of it online for free before purchase was most common for software (24%), followed by music (17%), video games (16%), movies (14%), TV shows (14%) and e-books (6%).\n\nOn average, Canadians report consuming online an average of 16 files (any type of content) for free prior to purchase in the past three months. Among individual content types, the following outlines the average number of files consumed online for free prior to purchase:\n\nMusic consumers consumed an average of 28 music tracks;\n\nMovie consumers consumed an average of two movies;\n\nTV consumers consumed an average of five TV shows;\n\nSoftware consumers consumed an average of three pieces of software;\n\ne-Books consumers consumed an average of one e-book; and\n\nVideo game consumers consumed an average of three video games for free prior to purchase.\n\n4. Levels of Copyright Infringement\n\nThe next section of this report outlines levels of copyright infringement in Canada, both at an overall level (i.e., across all six key content types) as well as among the individual content types.\n\n4.1. Legality Groups\n\nAs with the payment group metrics outlined previously, it is possible to create \"legality\"Footnote 4 groups by assessing the proportion of online content they each consumed legally. For all six content types, respondents were asked how many of the free pieces of digital content they consumed were consumed legally. For music and movies, respondents were also asked how many of the pieces of digital content they paid for were consumed legally. This question was not asked about TV shows, computer software, e-books or video games because the UK pilot study found that only a negligible proportion of people pay for illegal digital content of these types. For music and movies, it is possible to measure the legality of all the digital content consumed by combining the figures for legally accessed \"free digital content\" and legally accessed \"paid for digital content\". For the remaining content types (software, e-books or video games), an equivalent measure for the legality of all digital content consumed can be derived by assuming that all paid content was legal. These measures are shown in the following table.\n\nTable 4.1a Legality groups – proportion who consumed any content legally/illegally in the past three months Legality Groups Content Type Music Movies TV Shows Computer\n\nSoftware e-Books Video\n\nGames Any Base= those who have consumedFootnote 1 in the previous three months 1721 1658 1719 683 706 681 2728 100% legal 68% 64% 66% 64% 70% 67% 74% Mix of legal and illegal 28% 32% 30% 35% 29% 32% 21% 100% illegal 3% 4% 5% 1% 1% 1% 5% Any illegalFootnote 5 32% 36% 34% 36% 30% 33% 26% Base= all internet users 12+ 3252 3252 3252 3252 3252 3252 3252 100% legal 31% 28% 30% 12% 14% 13% 57% Mix of legal and illegal 13% 14% 14% 7% 6% 6% 17% 100% illegal 2% 2% 2% <0.5% <0.5% <0.5% 4% Any illegal 14% 16% 16% 7% 6% 7% 20%\n\nOne-quarter (26%) of content consumers have consumed at least one illegal file online in the past three months. Few consumers (5%) consumed online all of their files illegally.\n\nAmong online consumers, movies and software (36% each) have the highest rates of any illegal online consumption, followed by TV shows (34%), video games (33%), music (32%) and e-books (30%).\n\nThree-quarters (74%) of respondents who consumed any content online in the past three months reported doing so only legally in the past three months. The remaining quarter of online consumers (26%) downloaded or streamed/accessed infringing content either partially (mix of legal and illegal content) (21%) or completely (100% illegal content) (5%).\n\nE-books (70%) and music (68%) were most likely to be consumed legally online, while movies (36%), software (36%), TV shows (34%) and video games (33%) were most likely to be consumed illegally (any illegal).\n\nAmong internet users, rates of illegal online consumption are generally lower within content types. Among internet users, movies and TV shows have the highest level of illegal online consumption (16% each), followed by music (14%), video games (7%), software (7%) and e-books (6%).\n\nThe next table shows the demographic profile of online consumers who do not infringe (100% legal) and online consumers who do infringe, including both those who partially infringe (mix of legal and illegal) and those who completely infringe (100% illegal).\n\nTable 4.1b Demographic profiles of consumers who infringe versus those who do not infringe - All 12+ content consumers Legality Group 100% legal\n\n(Non-infringing) Mix of legal and illegal\n\n(Some infringing) 100% illegal\n\n(All infringing) Any illegal Base= those who have consumedFootnote 1 in the previous three months Base 2728 1985 611 132 743 Age 12-17 10% 10% 11% 6% 10% 18-34 31% 25% 51%* 28% 47% 35-54 32% 32% 30% 42%* 32% 55+ 28% 34%* 9% 24% 11% Income <$20K 10% 8% 12% 14% 13% $20-$39K 16% 16% 16% 18% 17% $40-$59K 19% 19% 19% 14% 18% $60-$79K 15% 16% 14% 14% 14% $80-$99K 12% 13% 13% 8% 12% $100K+ 17% 16% 16% 27%* 18%\n\nFew demographic factors play a role with regard to consuming infringing content online. We explored the relationship between gender, region, rural and urban, income, employment status and language, and found that only age and income varied significantly between consumers who infringed by downloading or streaming/accessing content online illegally and consumers who did not consume infringing content online. In particular:\n\nThe profile of consumers who downloaded or streamed/accessed infringing content skewed slightly younger, with consumers who consumed a mix of legal and illegal content online more likely to be 18-34 years old (51%) and those who only consumed illegal content online skewing toward those who are 35-54 years old (42%).\n\nAs well, the profile of consumers who only consumed infringing content online (100% illegal) skewed toward individuals with household incomes of $100K+ (27%).\n\nWe also explored the relationship between the use of virtual private networks (VPN) services and TV set-top boxes among consumers who did not consume infringing content online (100% legal) and those who consumed infringing content online, both those who partially infringe (mix of legal and illegal) and those who consumed all their content illegally.\n\nTable 4.1c Use of VPN services or TV set-top boxes - Internet users 12+ Legality Group All 12+ content consumers 100% legal\n\n(Non-infringing) Mix of legal and illegal\n\n(Some infringing) 100% illegal\n\n(All infringing) Base 3252 2728 1985 611 132 VPN Users 21% 25% 21% 42%* 20% TV Set-top Box User 10% 12% 10% 21%* 7%\n\n21% of internet users aged 12+ reported using VPN services, while 10% reported using TV set-top boxes.\n\nIndividuals who consumed a mix of legal and illegal content online are more likely to use VPN services (42%) or TV set-top boxes (21%) than consumers who only downloaded or streamed/accessed legal content.\n\nThe following table shows the services used in the past three months to consume or share any type of content. It compares those who consumed infringing content, both partial (mix of legal and illegal content) and complete (100% illegal content), with those who only consumed legal content.\n\nTable 4.1d: Services used for consuming or sharing content online in the past three months Services used Legality Groups All 12+ who consumed or shared content 100% legal\n\n(Non-infringing) Mix of legal and illegal\n\n(Some infringing) 100% illegal\n\n(All infringing) Base= those who have consumedFootnote 1 or shared in the previous three months 2758 2015 611 132 Netflix 64% 61% 82%* 30% YouTube 36% 28% 65%* 25% Facebook 28% 21% 58%* 11% Website that collects links to free streams (e.g., watch-series) 23% 18% 45%* 17% iTunes/App Store/Apple Store 21% 19% 29%* 4% Google Play 18% 14% 36%* 3% Spotify 14% 11% 26%* 9% Amazon Prime 13% 11% 23%* 7% BitTorrent software 13% 4% 41%* 23% Amazon 12% 9% 23%* 2% Amazon/Kindle 10% 9% 13%* - Apple Music 10% 9% 19%* 1% Crave TV 9% 7% 17%* 3% Pirate Bay 8% 3% 25%* 14% youtube-mp3.org 8% 5% 20%* 4% Dailymotion 7% 4% 16%* 3% Video Stream to File Converter (stream-ripper) 6% 4% 12%* 6% CTV 5% 4% 8% 3% Microsoft 5% 4% 9% 1% Steam 5% 4% 11%* - Torrentz 5% 3% 13%* 10% Xbox Live 5% 4% 9% - Net categoriesFootnote 6 - - - - Licensed sites 74% 70% 92%* 52% Social Networks 42% 36% 68%* 31% Peer-to-Peer/Cyberlocker/ Linking sites 31% 21% 61%* 43%* Stream-ripping 9% 5% 22%* 8% Mean number of sites used 3 3 6 2\n\nNetflix is the service used most by online content consumers, with close to two-thirds (64%) having used it in the past three months. One third (36%) of online content consumers have used YouTube in the past three months, while approximately one-quarter have used Facebook (28%) or a website that collects links to free streams (23%).\n\nOf note among the top 10 services is the prominence of streaming sites such as Netflix, YouTube, Google Play, Spotify and Amazon Prime, reflecting how streaming is becoming a stronger player in consumption than it has been in the past.\n\nAnother notable finding is the popularity of websites that collect links to free streams (e.g., watch-series) (23%). These websites often link to other sites that are not licensed or authorized to make available certain content. Another popular service used to access infringing content, BitTorrent software, was used by 13 per cent of online consumers.\n\nWhen we look at services from a category perspective, we see that three-quarters of online content consumers (74%) used licensed services, while 42 per cent used social network services to consume content online. One-third (31%) of online content consumers used a variety of peer-to-peer, cyberlocker, or linking sites, and nine per cent of online consumers used stream-ripping services in the past three months.\n\nComparing those who consumed infringing content online, both partially (mix of legal and illegal content) and completely (100% illegal content) with consumers of non-infringing content online (100% legal), we can see that consumers who downloaded or streamed/accessed some infringing content are more likely to use all services compared to consumers who did not consume infringing content (100% legal).\n\nNot unexpectedly, consumers who reported downloading or streaming/accessing infringing content only (100% illegal) are less likely to use licensed services and more likely to use peer-to-peer/cyberlocker/linking sites than other consumers of online content.\n\n5. Content Consumption Volumes\n\nThe metrics outlined so far have focused on results at an individual respondent level. The following table provides total consumption volume estimates for each of the content types (in the past three months, rounded to the nearest million in each case, and based on median consumption across all Canadians aged 12+). These volume numbers measure the number of unique music tracks, movies, TV show episodes, software, e-books and video games consumed online in the past three months. For greater clarity, respondents were asked to count as ten tracks a physical music CD they purchased in the past three months.\n\nTable 5.1a Volume of content consumed (in millions) Content Type Total Physical Digital Music Volume 283m 57m 226m - % of total 49% 20% 80% Movies Volume 87m 14m 73m - % of total 15% 16% 84% TV Shows Volume 122m 3m 119m - % of total 21% 3% 97% Computer Software Volume 15m 3m 12m - % of total 3% 23% 77% Books Volume 42m 28m 15m - % of total 7% 66% 34% Video Games Volume 27m 11m 16m - % of total 5% 42% 58%\n\nThe majority of content is consumed digitally across content types, except for books where physical copies remain more common than e-books. For example, the majority of TV shows were consumed digitally (97%), rather than physically on DVD (3%). Similarly, music tracks were mostly consumed digitally (80%), rather than physically (20%).\n\nWhile consumption is similar for movies and TV shows, movies are more likely to be consumed physically on DVD (16%) compared to TV shows (3%).\n\nIt is important to note that the number of digital music tracks reported above reflects the number of unique music tracks streamed/accessed. That is, respondents were asked to count as one track a given music track that they had streamed/accessed multiple times in the past three months. This was done to reflect the methodology used in the UK and Australia and to ensure international comparability of data.\n\nIn the Canadian survey, we also asked respondents to count the total number of tracks they had streamed/accessed online in the past three months, counting each time they had streamed an individual track more than once.\n\nWhen comparing these numbers, we find that the median number of total music tracks streamed/accessed is 50, while the median number of unique tracks streamed/accessed is 20.\n\nTable 5.1b Total versus unique music tracks streamed or accessed in the past three months Type of Count - Total Music Tracks Streamed/Accessed Median 50 Volume 288m Unique Music Tracks Streamed/Accessed Median 20 Volume 133m\n\nNext, we look at the volumes of digital content that were paid for versus freely consumed and those that were consumed legally versus illegally. To do this, we took the proportions of paid, free, legal and illegal within each content type and applied them to the respective volumes. As mentioned earlier in this report, volumes were calculated using medians.\n\nTable 5.1c Paid, free, legal and illegal content in digital formats - volume of content consumed (in millions) Content Type in Digital Format Paid Free Legal Illegal Music Volume 84m 141m 194m 31m - % of total 37% 63% 86% 14% Movies Volume 38m 36m 61m 12m - % of total 51% 49% 83% 17% TV shows Volume 45m 74m 103m 16m - % of total 38% 62% 86% 14% Computer Software Volume 4m 8m 11m 1m - % of total 31% 69% 92% 8% e-Books Volume 8m 7m 13m 1m - % of total 53% 47% 93% 7% Video Games Volume 8m 7m 15m 1m - % of total 53% 47% 95% 5%\n\nLooking at the ratio of paid versus free digital content we find that for music, TV shows and software the majority is consumed for free (63%, 62% and 69% respectively) while for movies, e-books and video games consumption is close to evenly split between paid and free content.\n\nThe large majority of digital content consumed is consumed legally for all content types. Illegal consumption is highest for movies (17%) followed closely by music and TV shows (14% each).\n\n6. Consumer Spending\n\nThis section outlines the main findings related to consumer spending in the past three months across the six content types.\n\n6.1. Quarterly Consumer Spending Among 12+ Year Olds\n\nThe table below shows, at the respondent level, the averageFootnote 7 spending within content types in the past 3 months across a number of expenditure categories. It also shows the proportions of the entire Canadian population (i.e. not just internet users) aged 12+ who claim to have spent any money on these items. The \"Other\" category incorporates merchandise (for all content types), music concerts or gigs, cinema tickets and movies purchased individually through pay-per-view. Online subscriptions were only asked about for music and movies in this survey. Spending surveyed in this research does not include subscriptions to TV services.\n\nTable 6.1a Average consumer quarterly spending among 12+ year olds – all content types Type of Spending Content Type Music Movies TV Shows Computer\n\nSoftware Book\n\nand\n\ne-books Video\n\nGames TotalFootnote 8 Base= all 12+ Mean % Mean % Mean % Mean % Mean % Mean % Mean % Purchases/rentals in physical format $11 19% $7 15% $5 10% $11 12% $18 30% $17 19% $68 39% Individual digital purchases $4 10% $3 11% $3 11% $5 6% $2 7% $8 9% $25 14% Online subscriptions $3 10% $6 22% - - - - - - - - $9 5% Other $47 26% $19 40% $4 3% - - $1 3% $4 5% $75 43% TotalFootnote 8 $64 39% $35 53% $11 20% $16 13% $22 34% $28 22% $176 100%\n\nAcross the content types, music has the highest average quarterly spending ($64), followed by movies ($35), video games ($28), books and e-books ($22), software ($16) and TV shows ($11).\n\nAmong music and movie spending, the bulk of the spending can be attributed to other purchases ($47 and $19, respectively), such as concert tickets, movie tickets, or merchandise.\n\nThe purchases of software, books and video games in physical formats are where respondents spent the bulk of their spending for those content types.\n\nAmong digital purchases, respondents spent the most, on average, on video games ($8), followed by software ($5), music ($4), movies ($3), TV shows ($3) and e-books ($2).\n\nThe highest proportion of Canadians aged 12+ spent on movies (53%), followed by music (39%), books and e-books (34%), video games (22%), TV shows (20%) and software (13%).\n\nFor almost all content types, physical purchases are undertaken in larger proportions than digital purchases, with the exception of TV shows, where physical and digital are undertaken in similar proportions (10% and 11%, respectively).\n\nIn summary, more Canadians aged 12+ spend their money on movies, but overall, on average Canadians spend more money on music.\n\nThe following table shows the averageFootnote 7 spending (digital and physical) for each content type among the legality groups.\n\nTable 6.1b Average total consumer quarterly spending (digital and physical) among legality groups – all content types Legality Group Base\n\nAll 12+ Content Type Music Movies TV Shows Computer\n\nSoftware Books\n\nand\n\nE-books Video\n\nGames Any 100% legal 2650 $54 $32 $8 $14 $21 $22 $151 Mix of legal and illegal 537 $119 $54 $31 $24 $26 $63 $317 100% illegal 115 $32 $23 $2 $8 $12 $13 $91\n\nFor each content type, those who consumed some infringing content online (a mix of legal and illegal) spent more in the past three months than those who consumed 100% of their content legally online.\n\nLooking at spending on any content, those who consumed at least some infringing content online (mix of legal and illegal) spent more than twice the amount compared to those who consumed all of their content online legally (100% legal) ($317 vs. $151). Not unexpectedly, those who consumed all of their content online illegally (100% illegal) spent the least ($91) on any content in the past three months.\n\nThe next table shows the averageFootnote 7 quarterly spending (digital and physical) among 12+ year olds, broken out by a variety of demographic characteristics. It also provides the demographic spending profile of consumers who did not infringe (100% legal) and consumers who did consume infringing content online, both those who partially infringed (mix of legal and illegal content) and those who only consumed infringing content online (100% illegal).\n\nTable 6.1c Average consumer quarterly spending demographic profile - Legality Group All 12+ 100% legal\n\n(Non-infringing) Mix of legal and illegal\n\n(Some infringing) 100% illegal\n\n(All infringing) Base=all 12+ Base 3301 2650 537 115 Total Total $176 $151 $317* $91 Gender Male $205 $176 $346* $104 Female $150 $130 $282* $72 Age 12-17 $268 $210 $476* $107 18-34 $264 $248 $316* $92 35-54 $185 $167 $299* $93 55+ $90 $86 $185* $84 Region Atlantic $164 $158 $221* $107 Quebec $141 $98 $360* $62 Ontario $189 $170 $300* $79 Prairies $190 $161 $365* $136 British Columbia $190 $174 $274* $140 Income <$20K $105 $93 $175* $49 $20-$39K $147 $124 $283* $98 $40-$59K $154 $130 $270* $91 $60-$79K $171 $151 $274* $145 $80-$99K $221 $193 $350* $154 $100K+ $300 $281 $460* $58 Language English $186 $166 $304* $102 French $141 $97 $361* $63 Rural or Urban Urban $185 $160 $327* $92 Rural $120 $102 $237* $88\n\nOn average, respondents spent approximately $176 on any of the six content types in the past three months.\n\nDemographic characteristics play a role in average quarterly spending. In particular:\n\nMen spend more than women ($205 vs. $150).\n\nYounger respondents spend more than older respondents ($268 for those 12-17 vs. $90 for those 55+).\n\nRegional spending differences also exist, with respondents in the Atlantic Provinces ($164) and Quebec ($141) spending less than their western counterparts: Ontario ($189), Prairies ($190) and BC ($190).\n\nUrban respondents also spend more than their rural counterparts ($185 vs. $120).\n\nNot unexpectedly, as household income increases, so does the average quarterly spending ($105 for those under $20,000 vs. $300 for those with $100,000+).\n\nWhen we look at the spending profile of consumers who did not download or stream/access infringing content online (100% legal) and those who did consume infringing content online, both those who consumed some infringing content (mix of legal and illegal) and those who consumed only infringing content (100% illegal), we find that those who consumed some infringing content (mix of legal and illegal) spend twice as much as those who did not consume infringing content online ($317 vs. $151).\n\nDemographic profiles of consumers who downloaded or streamed/accessed infringing content and those who only consumed legal content online are quite similar to all respondents with the exception of language. Francophone respondents spent more ($361) than Anglophone respondents ($304). This is not the case for all respondents, where Anglophone respondents spent more ($186) than Francophone respondents ($141).\n\n6.2. Quarterly Total Spending Estimates\n\nWhile the previous subsection focused on results at an individual level, the following table outlines total spending estimates for each of the content types in the past three months, based on mean spendingFootnote 7 and rounded to the nearest million in each case. The following table shows the total amount spent across all 12+ year olds in Canada by content type. The percentages refer to the proportion of the total spending attributed to the specific category.\n\nTable 6.2 Total quarterly spending estimates by content type and type of spending in millions Type of Spending Content Type Total Music Movies TV Shows Computer\n\nSoftware Books\n\nand\n\nE-books Video\n\nGames Base=all 12+ Spend % Spend % Spend % Spend % Spend % Spend % Spend % Purchases/ rentals in physical format $323m 17% $213m 20% $138m 40% $332m 70% $554m 84% $503m 58% $2,063m 39% Individual digital purchases $120m 6% $103m 10% $95m 27% $145m 30% $72m 11% $249m 29% $784m 14% Online subscriptionsFootnote 9 $75m 4% $184m 17% - - - - - - - - $259m 5% Tickets $1,126m 58% $514m 48% - - - - - - - - $1,640m 31% Merchandise $294m 15% $58m 5% $112m 33% - - $35m 5% $108m 13% $607m 11% Total $1,938m $1,072m $345m $477m $661m $860m $5,353m\n\nBased on the survey it can be estimated that Canadian consumers spent a total of $5.4 billion on music, movies, TV shows, computer software, books and e-books and video games in the past three months.\n\nAn interesting finding is that Canadians aged 12+ spend more on content in physical formats ($2,063m) than they do on digital content ($784m). The only content type where this is not the case is movies, where digital purchases and online subscriptions combined ($287m) are larger than spending on physical formats like DVDs ($213m).\n\nMusic has the highest overall quarterly spending, estimated at $1,938m, followed by movies ($1,072m), video games ($860m), books and e-books ($664m), computer software ($477m) and TV shows ($345m).\n\nFor music (73%) and movies (53%), the majority of spending in the past three months was on other purchases, such as tickets and merchandise.\n\nFor books and e-books (83%), software (70%), video games (58%), TV shows (40%) and music (17%), the amount spent on physical purchases was larger than the amount spent on digital purchases/online subscriptions.\n\nThe highest spending estimates on physical purchases were for books ($554m), followed by video games ($503m), computer software ($332m), music ($323m) and movies ($213m), with the lowest level for TV shows ($138m).\n\nThe highest spending estimates on individual digital purchases were for video games ($249m), software ($145) and music ($120m), with lower spending estimates on digital TV shows ($95m) and movies ($103m).\n\nAmong online subscriptions, more is spent on movies ($184m) than music ($75m).\n\n7. Attitudes Toward Digital Activities and Copyright Infringement\n\nThis survey included several questions on attitudes with the intention of uncovering primary motivations for taking part in the activities covered in this research, i.e., downloading, streaming/accessing and sharing content online. The following chapter explores these in more detail.\n\n7.1. Motivations for Using Paid Services\n\nIn an attempt to uncover the reasons why consumers do or do not download or stream/access infringing content online, and reasons why consumers pay or do not pay for content online, the survey asked questions about the primary motivations for their behaviour. Respondents who paid for any content online were asked:\n\n\"You indicated you have paid to download or stream/access [Content Types] in the past three months. What were your personal reasons for doing this rather than using services where you could have gotten them for free?\"\n\nIt is important to note that when we ask about the use of paid services over free ones we are not necessarily implying that the latter are illegal. As we have seen for many of the content types, free services such as YouTube and Facebook are particularly popular when it comes to consuming and sharing content online. However, as well as assessing responses among those who simply paid for any content, it is also possible to compare the responses of those who consumed content online both legally and illegally with those who consumed content only legally. The table below outlines the main reasons cited, from a prompted list, for paying for online content, both at the overall level and among those who infringed and those who only consumed non-infringing content online.\n\nTable 7.1 Motivations for using paid services Motivations for using paid service Content Type All 12+ content consumers 100% legal\n\n(Non-infringing) Mix of legal and illegal\n\n(Some infringing) 100% illegal\n\n(All infringing) Base=those who paid for content online in the past three months 1394 1006 371 17 It's easier/more convenient 48% 47% 52% 42% It's quicker 36% 33% 44%* 23% They are better quality 34% 31% 42%* 21% I don't want to use illegal sites 33% 39% 19% - I want to support creators\\industry 24% 24% 23% 22% I fear they may have viruses/malware/spyware 24% 25% 21% 26% I think it's morally wrong to use illegal sites 19% 22% 12% - I can afford to pay 19% 19% 19% 12% I prefer to pay 16% 19% 8% 7% I don't think it is right to get them for free 13% 16% 6% 2% I'm unaware of the free services available 10% 11% 7% 12% I fear I might be caught 7% 7% 7% 2% I don't know how to use the free services 8% 8% 6% 12% Other 7% 7% 7% 21%\n\nAmong all consumers who paid for any content, the top six reasons cited for using paid services were:\n\nEase/convenience (48%)\n\nSpeed (quicker) (36%)\n\nBetter quality (34%)\n\nI don't want to use illegal sites (33%)\n\nI want to support creators/industry (24%)\n\nFear of viruses/malware/spyware (24%)\n\nConsumers of some infringing content (mix of legal and illegal) are more likely to pay because it is quicker (44%) and/or better quality (42%).\n\n7.2. Motivations for Sharing Content\n\nRespondents who shared any content online were asked:\n\n\"You indicated you have shared [Content Types] in the past three months. What were your personal reasons for doing this?\"\n\nThe following table shows the main reasons given for sharing content online in the past three months, at the overall level, among those who consumed some infringing content, those who only consumed non-infringing content and those who only consumed infringing content.\n\nTable 7.2 Motivations for sharing content Motivations for sharing content Legality Groups All 12+ content consumers 100% legal\n\n(Non-infringing) Mix of legal and illegal\n\n(Some infringing) 100% illegal\n\n(All infringing) Base=those who shared content online in the past three months 486 270 202 14 It's easy to do 39% 35% 44% 40% It's only fair 26% 25% 27% 14% It's what everyone does 24% 22% 28% 11% My friends/family can't access files themselves 22% 21% 24% 12% I should be able to share my content with whomever I choose 19% 18% 21% 3% I enjoy a sense of community by sharing content online 18% 17% 19% 12% Unless I share content, I can't download other files myself 7% 5% 12%* - I get benefits for doing so (e.g. faster downloads) 5% 3% 7% 9% Other 9% 13% 3% 12%\n\nMotivations for sharing are varied among those who have shared. The top five motivations include:\n\nIt's easy to do (39%)\n\nIt's only fair (26%)\n\nIt's what everyone does (24%)\n\nMy friends/family can't access files themselves (22%)\n\nI should be able to share my content with whomever I choose (19%)\n\nFor the most part, motivations are no different between consumers who infringed and those who did not infringe with the exception of \"unless I share content, I can't download other files myself\". In this instance, consumers who infringed (mix of legal and illegal) are more likely to cite this as motivation for sharing compared to consumers who did not infringe (12% vs. <0.5%).\n\n7.3. Motivations for Consuming Illegally Instead of Paying\n\nIn this section we discuss the motivations for consuming content illegally online instead of paying for content. Respondents who indicated that they had infringed in the past three months were asked:\n\n\"You indicated you have downloaded, streamed or accessed [Content Types] in the past three months and that you may not have done so legally. What are your personal reasons for doing this?\"\n\nThe main reasons given for not paying among content consumers who infringed are outlined in the following table.\n\nTable 7.3 Motivations for consuming illegally instead of paying Motivations for not paying Legality Groups All 12+ content consumers Mix of legal and illegal\n\n(Some infringing) 100% illegal\n\n(All infringing) Base=those who have consumed content illegally in the previous three months 1245 611 132 It's free 54% 61% 58% It's easy/convenient 40% 47% 37% It's quick 34% 42%* 28% It means I can try something before I buy it 19% 25%* 11% I can't afford to pay 19% 25% 19% I think legal content is too expensive 11% 15% 16% The content is not available on the legal services that I subscribe to and pay for 11% 16% 8% I already owned content in another format 10% 11% 6% The content I want is not available on legal services in Canada 10% 16% 8% It's what my friends or family do 8% 12%* 3% The Industry makes too much money 7% 8% 7% I've already paid to see it\\them at the cinema\\in concert, etc. 6% 9% 3% I don't want to wait for content to become available on legal services 6% 10% 6% I don't think I should have to pay for files online 6% 6% 8% I already spend enough on content 6% 8% 6% No one suffers 2% 3% 3% No one ever gets caught 1% 1% 1% Other 17% 7% 14%\n\nThe primary motivations for not paying include it can be found for free (54%), it is easy/convenient (40%) and it is quick (34%).\n\nAmong consumers who infringed, those who consumed some infringing content (mix of legal and illegal) are more likely to cite \"It's quick\" (42% vs. 28%), \"It means I can try before I buy\" (25% vs. 11%) and \"It's what my friends and family do\" (12% vs. 3%) as motivations for not paying, relative to consumers who only consumed infringing content (100% illegal).\n\nReasons specified by respondents under \"Other\" include: do not know where to access it legally; it can be found legally through other channels such as TV.\n\n7.4. Motivations to Stop Downloading or Streaming Illegally\n\nRespondents who reported having downloaded or streamed/accessed infringing content online were also asked:\n\n\"And which, if any, of the following do you think would make you stop downloading or streaming files illegally?\"\n\nThe main reasons given among consumers who infringed are outlined in the following table.\n\nTable 7.4 Motivations to stop downloading or streaming illegally Discourage accessing content illegally Any illegal Mix of legal and illegal\n\n(Some infringing) 100% illegal\n\n(All infringing) Base= those who have consumed content illegally in the previous three months 743 611 132 If legal services were cheaper 58% 36%* 22% If everything I wanted was available legally 47% 30%* 17% If I only had to subscribe to one service to get access to the content I want 38% 23% 15% If everything I wanted was available legally online as soon as it was released elsewhere 36% 24%* 12% If it is clearer what is legal and what isn't 32% 20% 12% If legal services were more convenient\\flexible 27% 20%* 7% If legal services were better 26% 18%* 8% If I thought I might be sued 26% 15% 11% If a subscription service I was interested in became available 21% 17%* 4% If I thought I might be caught 20% 13% 7% If I knew where to go to see if something was illegal or not 20% 15%* 5% If everyone else stopped doing it 19% 11% 8% If my internet service provider (ISP) sent me a letter informing me my account had been used to infringe 19% 12% 7% If friends or family were caught 14% 11% 3% Nothing would make me stop 10% 4% 6% If there were articles in the media about people being caught 8% 7%* 1% Other 17% 4%* 13% Don't know 31% 8% 23%\n\nLower costs and more availability would encourage consumers who infringe to stop downloading or streaming files illegally. More specifically:\n\nIf legal services were cheaper (58%)\n\nIf everything I wanted was available legally (47%)\n\nIf I only had to subscribe to one service to access the content I want (38%)\n\nIf everything I wanted was available legally online as soon as it was released elsewhere (36%)\n\nGenerally speaking, respondents who only consumed infringing content online (100% illegal) have slightly different perspectives than other respondents who consumed infringing content online; they are less likely to believe most reasons cited would encourage them to stop downloading or streaming files illegally.\n\nReasons specified by respondents under \"Other\" include: if legal access were free; belief or understanding that existing activity is legal.\n\n7.5. Confidence in Knowing What is and is Not Legal Online\n\nRespondents with internet access were asked the following question:\n\n'How confident are you that you know what is legal and what isn't in terms of downloading, streaming/accessing, and sharing content online?'\n\nTable 7.5a Confidence in knowing what is and is not legal online Confidence level Legality Groups All 12+ content consumers 100% legal\n\n(Non-infringing) Mix of legal and illegal\n\n(Some infringing) 100% illegal\n\n(All infringing) Base= all internet users 12+ 3252 1985 611 132 Net confident (very + slightly) 83% 83% 62% 58%\n\nMost Canadian internet users (83%) are confident (very or slightly) in knowing what is legal and what isn't in terms of downloading, streaming/accessing and sharing content online.\n\nCanadians who consume infringing material online are less confident in what is legal: mix of legal and illegal (62%) and 100% illegal (58%).\n\nRespondents were also asked an open-ended question in order to understand what they perceived as being legal in terms of online services:\n\n\"What aspects of an online service which allows you to either download or stream/access content through the internet would make you trust it was legal?\"\n\nTable 7.5b Aspects of a site that make you trust it is legal\n\nAspects of a site that make you trust it is legal Total Base= all internet users 12+ 3252 Trusted or secure site 33% Payment or subscription required 14% Authorized to download 10% Do not download or stream content 7% Ads shown 2% Recommendations or reviews about the site 2% Licensed or certified site 2% It compensates artists 2% It allows me to download 1% Nothing 7% Don't know 18% Miscellaneous 2%\n\nRespondents indicated that trusted or secure sites (33%), payments or subscriptions (14%) and authorizations to download (10%)(i.e., it allowed you to download a file) were the primary things that made them trust the site was legal.\n\n7.6. Motivations for Using Virtual Private Networks and TV Set-Top Boxes\n\nThis survey also explored the motivations for using Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and TV set-top boxes.\n\n7.6.1. Virtual Private Networks\n\nRespondents who use a VPN service were asked:\n\n\"Please tell us which of the following statements apply to you with regard to VPN services. VPN services create a private network using the internet.\"\n\nTable 7.6.1 Motivations for using VPN services Motivations for using VPN services Total Base=those who use VPN services 710Footnote 10 I use VPN services to secure my communications and internet browsing details and history 57% I use VPN services to access content like music, movies, TV series, e-books, etc. for free 36% I use VPN services to access other countries' content like music, movies, TV series, e-books, etc. that is unavailable in Canada 32% I use VPN services to access content like music, movies, TV series, e-books, etc. for a reasonable price 27%\n\nRespondents that use VPN services primarily use them to secure communications and internet browsing (57%). Some use them to access free content (36%), while others use them to access content from other countries that is not available in Canada (32%), or to access content at a reasonable price (27%).\n\n7.6.2. TV Set-top Boxes\n\nRespondents who use a TV set-top box were asked:\n\n\"You indicated earlier that you used a TV set-top box to access online content like music, movies and TV shows. Which of the following statements describe how you use your TV set-top box to access content?\"\n\nTable 7.6.2 Motivations for using TV set-top boxes Motivations for using TV set-top boxes Total Base=those who use TV set-top boxes 375Footnote 11 I use my TV set-top box to access the content I pay for 78% I use my TV set-top box to access free content from legal sites and services 53% I use my TV set-top box to access content that I own and are part of my personal library. 28% I use my TV set-top box to access other content from sites I am not sure are legal or I know are not legal 16% I use my TV set-top box to watch live sports from sites I am not sure are legal or I know are not legal 11%\n\nThe majority of respondents that use TV set-top boxes report they use them to access content they have paid for (78%). Half also use set-top boxes to access legal content for free (53%) while another quarter (28%) use them to access content they personally own. A minority, use set-top boxes to access other content that is not legal or they are unsure if it is legal (16%), or to access live sports that are not legal or they are unsure if it is legal (11%).\n\n8. Infringement Notices\n\n8.1. Infringement Notices and Actions Taken\n\nIn Canada, a copyright owner who thinks a person's internet account has been used to violate or \"infringe\" their copyright (e.g., by downloading or uploading the material without permission) can send a notice of alleged infringement to the Internet Service Provider (ISP). The ISP must then forward this notice to the person associated with the account that is suspected of having been used to violate or infringe copyright. We asked respondents if they or someone in their household ever received a notice from their ISP that their account had been used to violate or infringe copyright and what they did as a result of receiving the notice. The following table outlines the results.\n\nTable 8.1 Infringement notices and actions taken Infringement Notices Total Base= those who have consumedFootnote 1 content in the previous three months - 2728 Received infringement notice Yes 10% Past three months 8% More than three months ago 8% No 90% Mean number received in the past three months 2.2 Mean number ever received 2.5 Base=those who have received an infringement notice 257Footnote 12 The notice raised my/someone in my household's awareness of copyright infringement. 38% I/someone in my household took steps to ensure my home network was password protected to ensure only those authorized to use it could. 27% I had a discussion with the people in my household about the alleged copyright infringement. 27% I/someone in my household stopped downloading/streaming from illegal sites 24% Nothing, I ignored it. 24% I/someone in my household took steps to ensure our home network was more private (i.e., started using a VPN). 13% I/someone in my household made a payment to the copyright owner to settle the allegation of infringement. 2%\n\nOne-in-ten (10%) respondents who consumed content online have received at least one notice alleging infringement.\n\nThose who reported receiving an infringement notice indicated the following impact or change had occurred as a result of the notice:\n\nRaised awareness of copyright infringement (38%)\n\nTook steps to increase security (27%)\n\nHad a discussion with someone in their household about the alleged infringement (27%)\n\nStopped downloading/streaming from illegal sites (24%)\n\nIgnored the notice (24%)\n\nTook steps to increase privacy (13%)\n\nMade a payment to settle the allegation (2%)\n\n9. Stream-Ripping\n\nStream-ripping allows a person to turn a file being played on a streaming platform, such as Spotify or even YouTube, into one that can be downloaded and kept permanently on their device. Stream-ripping has seen considerable uptake and popularity over the past few years, with reports of growth by up to 141 per cent over a two-year period from 2014 to 2016 in the UK according to a 2017 study. The following section provides a preliminary look at stream-ripping in Canada. More specifically, it looks at the demographic profile of those who use stream-ripping and the services used to undertake such activity.\n\n9.1. Demographic Profile of Users of Stream-Ripping Services\n\nThe following table provides a demographic profile of internet users and users of stream-ripping services.\n\nTable 9.1 Demographic Profile of Stream RippersFootnote 13 - Total Internet Users Users of Stream-ripping Services Base= all internet users 12+ Base 3252 354 Use stream-ripping service - 11% 100% Gender Male 49% 62%* Female 51% 38% Age 12-17 8% 8% 18-34 27% 52%* 35-54 32% 27% 55+ 33% 14%* Region Atlantic 7% 9% Quebec 23% 18%* Ontario 39% 37% Prairies 18% 19% British Columbia 14% 18%* Language English 75% 81%* French 24% 18%*\n\n11% of internet users reported using stream-ripping services.\n\nRelative to total internet users, users of stream-ripping skew male (62%) and are predominately 18-34 (52%) years of age. They are more likely to live in British Columbia (18%) and less likely to live in Quebec (18%), and are also more likely to be English speakers (81%).\n\n9.2. Services Used for Stream-Ripping\n\nRespondents who used a service to stream-rip music or entertainment content were asked:\n\n\"Which of the following, if any, have you used to stream-rip music or entertainment content?\n\nThe following table outlines the results.\n\nTable 9.2 Services used to stream-rip Services used to stream-rip Total Base=those who stream-rip 354 A stream-ripping site 48% Downloader apps 38% A stream-ripping plugin 14% A stream-ripping software 10% None of the above 19%\n\nAmong Canadians who have used a service to stream-rip music or entertainment, nearly half (48%) have used stream-ripping sites, one-third have used downloader apps (38%), one-in-seven (14%) have used a stream-ripping plug-in, and one-in-ten (10%) have used stream-ripping software.\n\n10. International Comparisons\n\nThe following chapter compares digital behaviour, levels of copyright infringement and average quarterly spending in Canada with those in Australia and the UK. Data from Australia and the United Kingdom have been sourced from the 2017 waves of their respective copyright infringement studies. It is important to consider that country results can be influenced by a number of variables beyond copyright law, including differences in market size and structure, language, broadcasting and cultural policy, social norms or access to high-speed internet service.\n\n10.1. Digital Behaviour\n\nThe following table outlines the proportion of internet users aged 12+ who downloaded, streamed/accessed, or shared content for each of the six content types across jurisdictions. The \"any\" column is an aggregation across the six content types (for example, if someone downloaded and streamed both music and movies they would be counted only once within the overall proportion).\n\nTable 10.1 Digital behaviour in the last three months among internet users aged 12+ – all content types - Jursidiction Content Type Music Movies TV Shows Computer Software e-Books Video Games Any - Base= all internet users 12+ (varies by jurisdiction) - - - - - - - Download Australia 26% 17% 16% 16% 12% 11% 47% Canada 29%* 22%* 18%* 18%* 17%* 16%* 59%* UK 21% 11% 11% 9% 10% 9% 38% Stream or Access Australia 38% 36% 43% 17%* 12%* 15%* 65% Canada 40% 41%* 44% 8% 8% 10% 73%* UK 32%* 26% 35%* 8% 7% 9% 54% Share Australia 7% 5% 4% 3% 2% 3% 12% Canada 11%* 7%* 6%* 3% 3%* 3% 28%* UK 6% 2% 2% 1%* 1% 3% 9% Consume (Download or stream/access) Australia 43% 39% 45% 22% 16% 18% 69% Canada 48% 46% 48% 20% 20% 20% 80% UK 37% 28% 37% 13%* 13% 14% 59%\n\nA larger proportion of Canadian internet users (80%) consume (download or stream/access) any of the content types compared to Australia (69%) and the UK (59%).\n\nStreaming appears more widespread in Canada and in Australia than in the UK. While Canadians have similar streaming levels to Australians for music and TV shows, Australians are more likely to stream software, video games and e-books.\n\nAnother interesting finding is that a larger proportion of Canadian internet users share content online, particularly music, movies, TV shows and e-books, compared to internet users in Australia and the UK.\n\n10.2. Levels of Copyright Infringement\n\nThe following two tables look at the proportion of consumers and all internet users 12+ across jurisdictions who have consumed any content online illegally over the past three months.\n\nTable 10.2a Legality groups – proportion who consumed any content illegally in the past three months Level of copyright infringement (Any illegal) Australia Canada UK Base= those who have consumedFootnote 1 content in the previous three months - - - Any of the selected content 38%* 26% 25% Music 32% 32% 18%* Movies 38% 36% 21%* TV Shows 25% 34%* 22% Software NA 36%* 26% e-Books NA 30%* 11% Video Games 24% 33%* 16%\n\nAmong consumers, Australian respondents (38%) are more likely to have infringed at least one content type in the past three months than consumers in Canada (26%) and the UK (25%).\n\nAmong content types, Canadian online consumers are more likely than both Australian and UK online consumers to have infringed at least once for TV shows (34% vs. 25% and 22%, respectively) and at least once for video games (33% vs. 24% and 16%, respectively). Compared to online consumers in the UK, Canadian online consumers are also more likely to have infringed at least once in the past three months for software (36% vs. 26% in the UK) and e-books (30% vs. 11% in the UK).\n\nTable 10.2b Legality groups – proportion who consumed any content illegally in the past three months Level of copyright infringement (Any illegal) Australia Canada UK Base= all internet users 12+ 2607 3252 4573 Any of the selected content 23% 20% 15%* Music 13% 14% 7%* Movies 14% 16%* 6% TV Shows 10% 16%* 8% Software NA 7%* 3% e-Books NA 6%* 1% Video Games 4% 7%* 2%\n\nAmong internet users, Canadian respondents report infringing (any content) at slightly lower levels than Australian respondents (20% vs. 23% in Australia), but more than UK respondents (20% vs. 15% in the UK).\n\nAmong content types, Canadian internet users report similar levels of infringement for music (14%) compared to Australian internet users (13%), but higher than UK internet users (7%). For all other content types, Canadian internet users report higher levels of infringement compared to internet users in Australia or the UK.\n\n10.3. Average Quarterly Spending\n\nThe following table outlines the average quarterly spending among all 12+ internet users across jurisdictions. For comparability purposes, we have converted all results to Canadian dollars. To do this, we used the Bank of Canada exchange rate for March 20, 2017, which is a date that corresponds to when both Australia and the UK undertook their last survey.\n\nTable 10.3. Average consumer quarterly spending across jurisdictions among all internet users Average quarterly spending Jurisdiction Australia\n\n($CAD) Canada\n\n($CAD) UK\n\n($CAD) Base=all 12+ - 2607 3301 4573 Physical purchases/rentals Music $17 $11 $7* Movies $13* $7 $8 TV Shows $8* $5 $5 Software NA $11* $7 Books NA $18* $13 Video Games $20 $17 $12* Individual digital purchases Music $8* $4 $3 Movies $4 $3 $2 TV Shows $5 $3 $2 Software NA $5* $2 e-Books NA $2 $2 Video Games $9 $8 $4* Online subscriptions Music $16* $3 $6 Movies $9* $6 $2 TV Shows $9 NA NA Software NA NA NA e-Books NA NA NA Video Games NA NA NA Other spending Music $58* $47 $23 Movies $42* $19 $18 TV Shows $3 $4 $2 Software NA NA NA Books NA $1 $3 Video Games $7* $4 $4 Total Music $100* $64 $39 Movies $68* $35 $33 TV Shows $25* $11 $9 Software NA $16* $9 Books NA $22* $17 Video Games $37* $28 $20\n\nIn total, Canadian respondents, spend less on each content type than Australian respondents, but more than UK respondents. This is also true among individual digital purchases and physical purchases.\n\n11. Methodology\n\n11.1. Methodological Overview\n\n11.1.1. Canadian Adaptation\n\nThe methodology used was based on the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) \"Online Copyright Infringement Tracker\" methodology and survey, adapting it to the Canadian context. This approach enabled an informed comparison of online consumption patterns and attitudes toward and prevalence of digital copyright infringement in Canada with that in the UK and Australia, which has also completed a similar survey. The Canadian survey was adapted to the Canadian context and included a telephone sample instead of the in-person sample collected in the UK. Furthermore, it included a detailed introduction that responds to anticipated con"
