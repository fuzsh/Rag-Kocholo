        "text": "When Simon Tam started an Asian American dance rock band called The Slants, he didn't realize that he was starting an entire movement around freedom of expression and discussions on identity. The band flipped stereotypes with their bombastic live shows and community activism. But when Simon applied to register a trademark on the band's name, the government dragged him all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nSlanted: How an Asian American Troublemaker Took on the Supreme Court is the story of an indomitable spirit who so believes in the idea of justice that he's willing to risk everything along the way for the dignity of self-identity. Simon shares a deeply personal account that will take you from anime conventions to the Supreme Court, all in the name of justice. The story provides a raw look at our legal system with unflinching honesty and offers timely insights on freedom of speech, how to connect with others we disagree with, and the power of music.\n\nGripping, funny, enlightening, and ultimately uplifting, Slanted proves that no obstacle is too difficult to conquer --as long as you have a little heart and a lot of rock n' roll. It's an irrepressible story that is fresh, alive, and defines what it means to be American.\n\nThe Slants are the first and only all-Asian American dance rock band in the world. They offer up catchy dance beats, strong hooks, and a bombastic live show that is \"not to be missed\" (The Westword). The Willamette Week says \"While the band may well be best experienced live, Slants releases always promise a few blistering, note-perfect singles.\" The music is the perfect combination of 80's driven synth pop with hard-hitting indie, floor-filling beats which fans affectionately dub as \"Chinatown Dance Rock.\"\n\nThey've been featured with Conan O'Brien's Team Coco, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Rolling Stone, and over 3,500 radio stations, tv shows, magazines, and websites across 125 countries.\n\n22 international tours, including appearances in 46 of 50 U.S states, have led to headlining showcases at major festivals such as SXSW, MusicfestNW, San Diego Comic-Con, and Dragon Con. The band has also provided support for The Decemberists, Apl.De.Ap (of Black Eyed Peas), and Shonen Knife.\n\nSeveral of their music videos feature martial arts choreography by Sammo Hung (The Matrix, Ip Man, & Enter the Dragon) and feature international stars Daniel Wu and Shu Qi.\n\nThey've won \"Album of the Year\" and \"Editor's Choice\" from dozens of magazines, including Willamette Week, LA Weekly, Shojo Beat, Village Voice, City Beat, and Rockwired.\n\nWhether rocking music halls, anime conventions, maximum-security prisons, colleges, or army bases, it's clear that The Slants' infectious brand of \"so damn good\" music will leave you wanting more\" (MRU Magazine)."
