        "text": "Yes!\n\nI actually still use one at work. I'd wanted to acquire my late father's microcassette recorder but my mother wants his briefcase to be a bit of a shrine so I can't go there...\n\nHowever I lucked into finding the exact same model in a Goodwill store on holiday in Las Vegas last year (Realistic Micro-10) and I use it at work.\n\nMy job sometimes involves me roving around 15 school laboratories cataloguing the contents of the cupboards. I find the quickest and most accurate way is to record the contents onto micro cassette, then effectively dictate to myself as I update the inventory.\n\nThe linear nature of tape and having the physical controls and no \"screen time out\" (as one has with a phone voice recorder) really make it a joy to use. I've only got three tapes, which I use in rotation, roughly 6 times a year.\n\nEDIT:\n\nke4mcl, have you ever tried one of the Metal tapes in your recorders (Fisher, Olympus, TDK, Maxell/Lo-D/Hitachi, Sanyo, National,)?\n\nUntil recently I didn't think there were any decent Normal (Type I) tapes available on this format, but as it turns out there were at least 3 good offerings: TDK D, Maxell UD, and BASF Ferro Super LH. Olympus had a few different Type I's (XB, XD, XV, and XZ), but I've only seen the packaging on one that specified it was good for music (XV). Olympus XD was labeled as dictating, but I'm not sure where XB and XZ stand.\n\nIt could be that some of these tapes used with a good recorder from the likes of Sony, Technics, JVC, or perhaps even with the Sanyo and Fisher ones would sound better than a novelty.\n\nOf course these come at a price:\n\nTDK D - http://www.ebay.com/itm/TDK-3PK-MC60-Microcassettes-60-Min-New-Old-Stock-Sealed-Bag-NOS-NIB-Nice-/252524123314?hash=item3acb9c54b2:g:KHoAAOSw9eVXUDUP\n\nMaxell UD - http://www.ebay.com/itm/Maxell-MC-46UD-Sealed-Microcassette-2-Pack-/162192874817?hash=item25c372dd41:g:LocAAOSw2x1XLOe8 / http://www.ebay.com/itm/Pack-of-2-M...647110?hash=item3accc63d86:g:iqIAAOSwmLlX3OoS\n\nMaxell MX - http://www.ebay.com/itm/4-MC-46-Metal-Tapes-microcassette-for-music-Hi-Fi-record-/262615980428?hash=item3d2521d98c:g:h0gAAOSwxg5X0bdj\n\nNational Metal - http://www.ebay.com/itm/National-MC-60-microcassette-tape-/182266917038?hash=item2a6ff470ae:g:8IcAAOSwFdtXyy7N\n\nLo-D ME - http://www.ebay.com/itm/Lo-D-MC-60-ME-microcassette-tape-/182266914261?hash=item2a6ff465d5:g:Lh8AAOSw8oFXyy2Y\n\nOlympus XV - http://www.ebay.com/itm/OLYMPUS-Pearlcorder-L200-Handheld-Microcassette-Voice-Recorder-Extras-F-Ship-/222240877849?hash=item33be96ad19:g:qmwAAOSwFe5XzYYs\n\nAttachments\n\nbasf_2.jpg\n\nmaxell_2.JPG\n\nmaxell_3.JPG\n\nmaxell_4.JPG\n\ntdk_1.JPG\n\nbasf_1.jpg\n\nolympus_xz_1.JPG\n\nolympus_xv_2.JPG\n\nolympus_xv_1.JPG\n\nolympus_xd_3.JPG\n\nolympus_xd_1.JPG\n\nolympus_xb_3.JPG\n\nolympus_xb_2.JPG\n\nolympus_xb_1.JPG\n\nolympus_xd_2.JPG\n\nnational_1.JPG\n\nolympus_xh.jpg\n\nmaxell_1.jpg\n\nlo-d_1.JPG\n\nhitachi.jpg\n\nfisher.jpg\n\nI've just bought one of the last remaining Sanyo RD-XM1 microcassette tapedecks from the good fellow on Ebay UK and it's on its way to Denmark right now.\n\nHe's got two left in stock.\n\nReading up on the subject, it seems fair to conclude, that C120 tape is used on MC-60 (30 min, each side) microcassette tapes and even thinner tape is used on MC-80/MC-90.\n\nI'm going to wind up some good Type IV metal cassette tape into ordinary microcassette shells and use that instead. I'll experiment with Type IV C46, C60 and C90 and see where it gets me. More on that later.\n\nWhat are your experiences with using cassette Type IV Metal tape like this, if any ?\n\nI could have used a Type II selection with this media, which would have brought BASF doublecoated CrO2 tapes into use, because of the consistency and the lowest noisefloor from these tapes in this realm. But Type IV Metal is the best for the moment, I guess.\n\nThis is going to be such fun. Can't wait. Yeeeh-hah.\n\nHello, here's the guy who made the microcassettes, here are all my videos.\n\nOf course, there is no Type V, I'm calling it this way because the magnetic density (coercivity) is higher. Some comparison based on TDK tapes:\n\nType I: 330\n\nType II: 660 (SA)\n\nType IV: 1140 (MA-XG)\n\nI don't know about FeCr, but the true FeCr would be DCC tape, it is Cro2 tape with about 900 Oe. In comparison to the TDK MA-XG has Type V the density is 1.46 times higher, Type VI is 2.06x higher. So, I think it makes sense I used these names.\n\nDCC tapes: It's not just videotape. I got my Technics RS-DC8 vertical loading DCC deck in about 1996, and I wanted to get more information. There was no internet, I got all infos directly by phone. The guy from BASF told me on the cellphone while sitting in a train that is special formulated tape with about 900 Oe, so normal chromdioxid tapes can't be used, although it's possible by drilling a hole in on a special position. Panasonic even sent me an information sheet and three tapes, including a rare 75 minute tape. At Philips in the netherlands I even reached one of the developers of DCC, he was very happy that someone was interested. It was even planned to add a video signal output to DCC to use the videotext format for more information display. I got at this time also the price for a replacement DCC head for the Technics RS-DC8: 539 DM! That's including inflation a price of 374 Euro today.\n\nType V is useable in microcassettes and audiocassettes, however, a bit may remain of the last record if the recording head isn't strong enough. Type VI the most decks can't even erase. The Technics M260 can do it, about +4 dB is maximum because the recording power isn't high enough. It is neccessary to use an external noise reduction compressor, like an external dbx or HighCom device. I'm using an Rotel RN-500 HighCom compander and have my +8 dB again. Type V can reach amazing audio cassette lengths to more than 170 minutes! A failed test my my Compact Cassette winding build resulted in this tape... it looks like a C30 or so. Notice the new top sticker which features all important noise reductions. The HighCom logo looks better now. These stickers will soon be available as PDF.\n\nBack to the microcassettes: I am not only a collector, I'm a user. I have 7 different devices now, and I have a brand new boxed Nordmende Stereo Clipper 3020 which replaced MP3 when I'm outside. Microcassettes with great quality and a length of typically 86 minutes are much cooler ;-) It's everything real, I tested even Ferrochrome tape in a microcassette. And because I'm doing graphics, always logos are existing. They're not only graphics, everything is made per DTP to get the best quality. The little blue frames are the object borders. But there's way more..."
