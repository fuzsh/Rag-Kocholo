        "text": "Tour of Israel Drone Footage with My Father in Heaven\n\nAt some point I do believe I will enter another season of producing the next Music To Pray By album, ‚ÄúYour Kingdom Come‚Äù. I already have more than enough original content to create an album and likely 1-2 podcasts as a preview. Its just a matter of exiting this current season I‚Äôm in where I have trouble finding the time to dedicate to this. Please be in prayer for me on this front as this is my passion and I do feel guilty about how much time has passed since my last post.\n\nAround Easter, I dedicated a weekend to editing all of the drone footage I collected while on my trip to Israel in 2017 and put it with the album, ‚ÄúMy Father in Heaven‚Äù. I think it turned out pretty well. Here it is:\n\nPodcast 70 posted on YouTube‚Ä¶\n\nI recently got to enjoy some time out at St. Petersburg Beach in Florida where I took up my new drone, a Mavic Pro. I had tweaked the video settings based on some recommendations so it‚Äôs not as colorful as I would have liked it to be, but the Podcast 70 music goes well with it I think. My brother, Adam gave me the idea of putting my music on YouTube as another way to reach people. I hope y‚Äôall enjoy it. I also hope you have a wonderful Easter ‚Äì a time of remembering why we‚Äôre here ‚Äì remembering the One Who gave His Life as a ransom for us ‚Äì the One Who conquered the grave! Praise You Jesus!\n\nPodcast Seventy\n\nThis podcast is made up of the songs left out of the Music To Pray By album ‚ÄúMy Father in Heaven‚Äù, which is coming very soon. This is the first podcast recorded on the new Yamaha DC7XE3 Grand Piano talked about here as well as all new mics and pre-amps. I believe it is the best sounding piano audio I‚Äôve ever captured. I hope and pray it inspires you to spend time in the Presence of our Truly Amazing and Awesome God. Please forgive me for taking so long ‚Äì almost 2 years to post new music. I hope it was worth the wait, and I am absolutely thrilled about the new album and excited to see what God is going to do through this. Please continue to pray for me and my family. God bless.\n\nPodcast Sixty-nine\n\nThe last podcast to be recorded on my Yamaha DC3M4. It goes away tomorrow, and though it‚Äôs only been 4 years, I feel as though I have a tremendous amount of history with that wonderful piano. I actually had to pick and choose from about 2 hours worth of recordings since I‚Äôm not sure if the old format will be supported on the new piano. I‚Äôm truly excited about the capabilities and the sound of the new Yamaha DC7XE3Pro, but it‚Äôs also sad to see my old piano leave the studio. I‚Äôm sure it will end up in good hands!\n\nAbout the podcast ‚Äì it‚Äôs all original except the last song. I had to choose between two really good covers and ended up going with ‚ÄúOceans‚Äù by Hillsong United. It is one of my favorite songs, and though I feel like I barely did the original justice, I hope to do another rendition in a future podcast. I did a lot of playing with this mix, which will likely change noticeably with the new piano. I wanted to make sure the last podcast from the DC3M4 was as good as it could possibly sound, and I think I accomplished that.\n\nI have a number of things to share with you so I apologize in advance for all the non-music posts that are to come over the next week or so. I pray this podcast is a blessing to you.\n\nPodcast Sixty-eight\n\nYet another all-original podcast. I did use some pretty familiar chord progressions, but I also tried out some new styles. I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to trying this podcast out tomorrow morning during my devotional.\n\nSorry this came a little late. I spent way more time editing than I have in the past largely due to Logic Pro X, the new version of pro audio software I use. Some of the editing techniques I use don‚Äôt work the same way unfortunately so I spent bit of time finding workarounds.\n\nMay the Joy and Peace of our LORD overwhelm you as you listen and stay your mind on Him!\n\nPodcast Sixty-seven\n\nYou may not hear any familiar melodies as this podcast is mostly original. I‚Äôve adopted a fairly new process to recording the podcast. Rather than attempting to record all 30+ minutes in one sitting, I‚Äôve just sat at the piano and pressed ‚Äúrecord‚Äù as the Holy Spirit has led throughout the past quarter. It has been working out okay so far. It also gives me an opportunity to select the best recordings out of many, and there was a really bad 15 minutes of recording I was happy not to have included in this podcast. You may notice that it may have a slightly different sound than previous podcasts. I‚Äôm still perfecting the audio recording and mixing aspect of the podcast even after almost 5 years. I pray this podcast encourages you to spend some quality time with our Maker.\n\nA quick update ‚Äì Yoko‚Äôs sister, Eiko is doing so well now that the hospice where she was sent to spend her remaining time here on earth is preparing to discharge her since her condition has improved so dramatically. This is truly an inspiring testimony in development! Our God is an Awesome God! Please keep her and her family in your prayers.\n\nPodcast Sixty-six\n\nI think this might end up being my favorite podcast to date. What God has brought me through over the past 7 months is expressed in this music since even today I fail to grasp the words to properly convey what God has done in me.\n\nEven the technical part of getting this recorded was met with enormous opposition. I had hoped to post this on Wednesday, but two completely separate devices in my studio failed ‚Äì one of them is still dead. Praise the LORD it is finally done as I silently hope my computer doesn‚Äôt crash before I click ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù. üôÇ The two familiar songs I used go way back. The titles are ‚ÄúHoly, Holy, Holy LORD‚Äù, and ‚ÄúI Love You LORD‚Äù. I also wrote song with the primary lyrics being, ‚ÄúI stay my mind on You God‚Äù. I hope to someday make it into a full blown song with verses and a bridge, but I‚Äôm not really a lyricist, nor was Moses a speaker so we‚Äôll see where it goes. I pray this podcast blesses you as much as it has blessed me and thank you for your patience. I‚Äôll post an update within the next couple of weeks regarding some of my future plans for this ministry and life in general though His Kingdom will I seek first.\n\nPodcast Sixty-five\n\nIn this podcast, I used songs Soundwave prepared for DCYC ‚Äì they are ‚ÄúStrong Enough to Save‚Äù, ‚ÄúYour Name High‚Äù, ‚ÄúForever Reign‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlways‚Äù, ‚ÄúYour Great Name‚Äù, and ‚ÄúOur God‚Äù. I think this is probably the first podcast ever to be original-free, although, it does contain some originality. Those who like consistently quite and peaceful podcasts may not enjoy this one as much since I get a bit loud in some parts. It may be a few months before the next podcast is posted, but I‚Äôll try to make it softer. I thank all of you who continue to use this ministry to enhance your prayer time. I‚Äôm blown away at the number of downloads that happen on a daily basis.\n\nPodcast Sixty-four\n\nWhat a crazy couple of weeks it has been! I won‚Äôt bore you with all the details, but the end result is I finally have a new podcast. You‚Äôd think after 3 years of doing this I‚Äôd have it down but I don‚Äôt. This podcast required a massive amount of editing, but I think it turned out okay. I did find some ways to improve the audio over the previous podcasts. The only issue is there‚Äôs too big of a dynamic range so had to go a little overboard on the compression and limiting.\n\nI wish I could commit to doing these more frequently, but with work at AT&T consuming more and more of my time, family, Soundwave, and {hopefully} a Music To Pray By album by early 2013, I‚Äôm going to keep it at once a Month for now. God bless all y‚Äôall who are listening, and please keep me and my family in your prayers.\n\nPodcast Sixty-three\n\nI finished mixing the Soundwave album last week so I‚Äôm back at it ‚Äì thanks for your patience. This podcast, I only used ‚ÄúHosannah‚Äù for a brief period. The rest is original ‚Äì some from previous podcasts and some that‚Äôs fresh and new. An interesting stat about this podcast is it‚Äôs the first to be exactly 30 minutes long! I admit, I stretched the end out a little, but it was already pretty close. I added a bit more gain both at the pre amp and in software using a little more compression and gain on the limiter to try to even out the level a bit. There is quite a bit more dynamics in this podcast compared to the previous two or three. This time, I wanted to keep the dynamics as original as possible, especially during the soft parts, and I didn‚Äôt change the level on some of the louder midi notes like I have in the past. I think it turned out better this way. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get better at holding back more as I record so please bear with me as I continue learn and grow in this ministry.\n\nPodcast Sixty-two\n\nI used quite a few worship songs during this podcast ‚Äì ‚ÄúGive Me Faith‚Äù, ‚ÄúOur God‚Äù, ‚ÄúI Lift My Hands‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMighty To Save‚Äù. In a way, a lot of this podcast sounds repetitive to me compared to previous podcasts. It‚Äôs becoming a little challenging to keep things unique considering there is already over 30 hours of podcasts. üôÇ If this podcast inspires you to pray, mission accomplished.\n\nPodcast Sixty-one\n\nStill searching for the best mic placement and mix, but I think its getting there. Most all the tunes are repeat or new originals. You may recognize one or two of them. I pray that every note played will encourage you to seek God‚Äôs Kingdom first. Peace.\n\nPodcast Sixty\n\nThis podcast does have familiar melodies from others, but I believe it has some uniqueness. One melody from the chorus of ‚ÄúPour My Love on You‚Äù was used at the end. A couple technical notes ‚Äì I used a new mic and mic positions, and there was definitely more dynamics than usual, but this was my heart of worship at the time ‚Äì I hope it‚Äôs not too distracting. Happy 4th of July ‚Äì thank God for the freedom we have. An estimate of 129 billion people have lived throughout the history of the world. Only 5 billion have experienced the freedom we enjoy, and 3 billion are alive today. How rare freedom is.\n\nPodcast Fifty-nine\n\nThis podcast, I used the songs, ‚ÄúCame to My Rescue‚Äù and ‚ÄúI Will Exalt‚Äù. Since I actually recorded this podcast over a month ago, I had to refer to planning center for the song names.\n\nIt is nice to be up on the new hosting provider. I was finally able to update quite a bit on the podcast so things look much better in the iTunes Music Store. If you have iTunes installed, feel free to check it out.\n\nInteresting fact: this podcast contains 16,782 notes, and I probably touched 80-90% of them during the editing process. üôÇ I either need to learn how to play better or be less picky about timing issues.\n\nI hope you enjoy the podcast. May the Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you. May the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.\n\nPodcast Fifty-eight\n\nIt‚Äôs finally finished! The songs used are mostly original. I did play a familiar melody at the tail end. Most of it is a little more fast-paced than the norm. May you continue to be inspired to pray through my offering of worship to our wonderful Creator. To Him be the glory!\n\nPodcast Fifty-seven\n\nThis week we had Wednesday Night worship at The Connection Church so I used quite a few songs from that service ‚Äì ‚ÄúMighty To Save‚Äù, ‚ÄúCame To My Rescue‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAwakening‚Äù, a new worship song by Chris Tomlin that is pretty awesome. Be sure to check it out if you haven‚Äôt heard it yet. A couple originals are included as well. One was from a previous podcast. I‚Äôm still on a quest for the perfect piano mix. Mic placement and EQ has been changing every podcast. I really need to swap out my NT1000 with something else. It isn‚Äôt very balanced across the frequency spectrum. Maybe I‚Äôll be able to afford the mic I‚Äôd like to replace it with in a couple months. Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and the rest will be added. I pray this podcast assists you in seeking!\n\nPodcast Fifty-six\n\nI used only one song this podcast. It‚Äôs by Robbie Seay, and it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúCrazy Love‚Äù. The rest is original. This podcast is actually a second take since the first didn‚Äôt record properly. I always thought recording to MIDI would eliminate having to re-record podcasts, but not true. I did learn that the Disklavier does not like any kind of MIDI signal coming into it when recording so hopefully this will be the last time this happens. I do believe the second take turned out better than the first ‚Äì thank you Holy Spirit. Draw near to Him and He WILL draw near to you. Not only is that in the Bible, but I have witnessed it first-hand.\n\nPodcast Fifty-five\n\nI used two songs from last week‚Äôs service for today‚Äôs podcast ‚Äì ‚ÄúForever Reign‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGod You Reign‚Äù. The rest is original. I used a different acoustic piano sample for editing the MIDI this week, and it actually disguised a lot of the small timing issues which is good and bad. The good is it took me half the time to edit (~4 hours instead of ~8). The bad is I notice them when playing back on the DC3, but I‚Äôm pretty sure most people won‚Äôt notice. For those who do, you‚Äôll have the CD to look forward to. My plan is to make it as perfect as possible. Stay tuned! As you pray, please remember to pray for Japan.\n\nPodcast Fifty-four\n\nWe did a new song called ‚ÄúOur God‚Äù by Chris Tomlin in church last week, and it‚Äôs a beautiful song so that‚Äôs what I started this podcast with. The rest is somewhat original. A familiar melody came to mind towards the end, but I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint where it came from. Feel free to leave a comment if you recognize it.\n\nPodcast Fifty-three\n\nThis week I used a new song we played at church called ‚ÄúCame to My Rescue‚Äù. It is a wonderful worship song and it would be worthwhile to check out the lyrics if you haven‚Äôt heard them before. I also played ‚ÄúAmazing Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou are My King‚Äù. The rest is original. Even though I didn‚Äôt spend as much time fixing timing issues as the last podcast, I did spend most of the weekend editing. I hope and pray one day this will be my full time job. God bless all of yall out there who are listening and may He continue to draw near to you as you draw near to Him!"
