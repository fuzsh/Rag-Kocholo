With of course some exceptions, nowadays it seems they pack albums with like 18 tracks really diluting what could've been a SOLID great release. A lot of fillers. I used to like it better when additional tracks would show up as b-sides or stuff like that.\n\nPost by Carlitoz on\n\nLong albums because it gives you an experience. It is like a life or movie. Short albums are like an episode...they leave you wanting more\n\nGood point, but I think it's relative to the album and the fan. Sometimes an album can leave me wanting less. ;)\n\nI think that's what people are saying about Kanye's latest if I'm not wrong?\n\nI also have to say that I do have some double albums which I fully adore too.\n\nPost by Glove Slap on\n\nOverlong albums are literally not even a new song lol\n\nIkr? They’ve been a regular thing since CD technology got to the point where you could fit 80 minutes on a disc. That was over 30 years ago by this point. Back then songs that could have been fine as 4 or 5 minute works were stretched out even longer, often with no additional benefit.\n\nBut it ultimately depends on the work itself. I have no issues with the length of Take Care, but I can’t say the same for any Drake project released in the last 5 years. Rumours is one of the tightest albums ever, and it was still improved when they added Silver Springs (which was originally left off due to vinyl limitations at the time) for the CD releases.\n\nThat’s one of the best things about the post-album era. I can re-edit albums to be as I want them on a playlist instead of complaining. I don’t need the artist to tell me what I want, I can listen and decide what to keep without wasting time during future listens. Everyone should just dump all then bonus tracks they doled out to various markets on streaming services. I should not have to use YouTube to find Sheryl Crow’s Free Man these days, 25 years after that album was released."
