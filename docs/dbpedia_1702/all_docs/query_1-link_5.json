        "text": "When Philips and Sony invented CD in the late 1970’s computers were rather basic in comparison to today, storage technology was crude and the CD seemed like science fiction when it was launched on the market in 1984. “Pure, Perfect Sound Forever” was the Phillips advertising slogan. However there was a problem, that has never really been solved with CD.\n\nThere just isn’t enough data on the CD! With the technology of the time it just wasn’t possible to fit any more data on the 5″ disk and keep the length to 74 minutes (Enough for Beethoven’s 5th Symphony – indeed if that had been shorter we may have been given a higher sampling rate!). The CD format (Called Red Book after the book that defined the specification) contains data that is sampled at 44.4Khz and at 16Bits of resolution. This gave CD a maximum playback frequency of 22.2Khz, just above the human hearing range. (This is half the maximum sampling rate). The 16bits gives a “dynamic range – difference in volume between the quietest and loudest parts (without noise in the equipment) of 96db theoretically.\n\nThis was thought to be high enough to reproduce music. For various reasons this turned out not to be true. Filters were needed to block of the sound above 22.2Khz as there would be aliases (like echoes) of sound that had to cut. These filters had to cut from 22.2Khz, but try not to affect the upper part of the listening range of human hearing, unfortunately it is hard to do this and inevitably the top end frequencies were affected. Dynamic range of 96db was thought to be adequate but tests have pointed to a minimum of 118db being ideal.\n\nWorse still it turns out that humans are aware of frequencies above the listening range. What the engineers who designed this system created was state of the art for a digital replay system but it simply didn’t sound as good as analogue. It was convenience and sexiness that sold the CD, not sound quality. Worse still the early digital recording equipment was only 14bit and ideally the recording/mastering equipment should be at a higher resolution than the final product. Mastering machines have progressively improved through 20Bit and 24 Bit and and higher sampling rates up to 384Khz now, though the norm seems to be 96Khz and 24 bits.\n\nThere have been many attempts to improve the sound of CD, along with the improved mastering and mixing equipment.\n\nSony Super Bit Mapping\n\nThe SBM logo, can be found on the back of many standard CD’s and will play on any CD player. Sony’s technology uses a 24 bit machine to master and mix but at the end downsamples to 16Bit using a technique called masking, where it tries to workout what you wont be able to hear, due to those sounds being “masked” by other louder music. This technique is also used to make the much more lossy AAC format. Now you have probably gathered that the CD is not “Lossless” at all! Super Bit Mapping works pretty well, so if you have a standard CD player these will sound better than non Super Bit Mapped versions. Sony claims deeper bass and more dynamic mid-range by reorienting quantization noise to frequencies above 15,000 Hz – where human hearing is far less sensitive – the SBM process can achieve a result that is comparable to nearly 20-bit quality.\n\nI can think of a few examples in my collection, Miles Davis Kind of Blue, Dire Straits debut album.\n\nThis can be played on ANY device that plays CD’s\n\nHDCD\n\nWhile SBM stayed with 16Bit for playback so they would play on everyone’s CD player. HDCD used a different approach to expand the resolution of CD to 20 bits, but required dedicated hardware – in the form of a chip in the DAC. Originally developed by Pacific Microsonics, Microsoft now own this technology. A search for HDCD on Amazon reveals a fair number of rock and pop discs including much of Neil Young’s output. Mark Knofler, Van Halen etc.\n\nProbably the most useful feature of this now is that HDCD is built into Windows media player, and with a plugin for Foobar (note this will only work on a PC), it is possible to rip the 20 bit content (into a 24 bit file) that can then be played back on any computer.\n\nI have found that playing back HDCD’s on a non compatible CD player produces a somewhat brighter, harder sound, Jimi Hendrix 20 Th Anniversary disc for example is bright to the point of unlistenable on a standard CD player, but on HDCD much warmer.\n\nA list of HDCD’s can be found here\n\nHDCD’s require a compatible CD or universal player / DAC.\n\nSuper Audio CD. (SACD)\n\nIf only this is what CD had been in the first place! Launched in 1997, only 13 years after CD, SACD dispenses with the pulse code modulation conversion from analogue to digital that many blame for the “digital” sound and instead uses “Direct stream Digital” – which is as close to an analogue version of digital as I have heard. Whereas PCM measures a value for the sound at each sample frequency, DSD records simply “up” or “down” and samples many more times per second, 2.8Mhz in fact! This gives 120db of dynamic range. SACD has consistently produced wonderful analogue like sound when used to master original content or convert analogue sources into SACD. Music that was originally recorded on poor quality digital equipment during the 1984 to 1995 period approximately sounds produces a smaller sonic gain over CD as the data simply isn’t there in the original recording. Consequently there is a move to convert older analogue recordings such as jazz from Blue Note in the 1950’s and 60’s – see Analogue Productions and as SACD is also a surround format, the Philips catalogue of quadrophonic recordings from the 1970’s are being brought back to life by “Pentatone” – these sound better than the original vinyl would have sounded.\n\nThere is unfortunately a “but”. Few major record companies supported this and very little mainstream pop music was produced on SACD, for example no Radiohead, Charlatans etc. but there was an Oasis disk and one from Snow Patrol. Most companies gave up making them as they were more expensive to make and most people in the marketplace had no idea about SACD. However in the Classical and Jazz world, where frankly the sound quality provides greater rewards – as the music is properly recorded in the first place, (and by that I mean less compression) there are many thousands of disks and new ones added every week. Recently Universal have started releasing their back catalogue of Rock classics and EMI have started releasing stereo historic classical recordings. The number of new releases is steadily increasing, so there is hope!\n\nThis is without doubt my favourite format.\n\nThe DSD format at the heart of SACD is now growing in popularity as a download format. It’s analogue like sound and amazing 3-dimensionality when recorded originally in DSD can be sampled from a number of download sites such as Acoustic Sounds and\n\nsee www.nativedsd.com\n\nsee www.sa_cd.net\n\nDVD-A\n\nThis was an attempt to create a hi resolution format on a DVD, sold as “compatible with any DVD player” – “DVD-Audio Playback required for high resolution sound”. This was a disaster, mainly because it was setup as a rival to SACD, which prompted manufacturers to build “universal” players that could play both formats, but all it really did was confuse the buying public. DVD-A did not sound as good as SACD but even worse was that each disk had it’s own unique menu system (I hate that about DVD’s and Blu-Ray too), and to play music you often had to switch o the TV and navigate the menu just to get the music to play. Some players simply wouldn’t play the DVD-A at all. This died a death and nearly took SACD with it. Last year however completely inexplicably King Crimson brought out a 40th anniversary re-issue of their albums in DVD-A.\n\nUniversal first released some of their back catalogue on DVD-A such as Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours and the Doors studio albums, but have now switched to SACD. There are still some DVD-A’s available, most notably the Beatles “Love” album in 5.1.\n\nBlu-Ray\n\nBlu-Ray is a 5″ silver disc format that uses a Blue laser to squeeze in 48Ghz of data. Primarily designed for full HD movies at 1080p, but also has the ability to store high definition audio. There are very few audio only discs but a growing number of live concerts and this is where this format excels.\n\nThere are two competing audio formats (as there was with DVD) so the names of Dolby and DTS will be familiar. Most (but not all) Blu-Ray players will play these formats and some AV receivers / processors will play them.\n\nIt is worth comparing these formats with their DVD equivalents to show just how far we have come.\n\nDVD audio was 16bit 48Khz and 5.1 channels, but both DTS and Dolby were compressed but the differences between them were that DTS had as much as three times the data rate – so sounded better. Neither of these I would describe as high definition.\n\nOn Blu-Ray audio is now up to 24 bit and 96Khz for 7.1 channels DTS has a theoretically higher bit rate but these formats are lossless, and both sound FANTASTIC.\n\nBlu-Ray can also have a 192Khz 24 bit track in Stereo only.\n\nDownloads and computer based audio.\n\nHigh resolution particularly SACD has failed to capture the mass market as yet because most people listen to downloaded music now, on their ipods or home music severs for convenience. Most people listen to the dreadful quality that the iPod / itunes software is set to as standard 128kbps AAC or even worse MP3.\n\nThis is why I started this blog. It doesn’t have to be this way! we can do much better using “Lossless compression” rather than lossy formats like MP3 and AAC and play CD resolution on the ipod, and high definition on computer or home music streamer / server.\n\nSeveral companies and artists are now enabling hi-definition downloads (typically 24 bit at 88/ 96 / 176 / 192 Khz sample rates, depending on the machines used to master the original content). Note that these are almost always in stereo, though some universal players do have the ability to play 5.1 lossless. Most companies are using the Pulse Code Modulation format but there are an increasing number of Direct Stream Digital downloads, for which a special DAC is required.\n\nInteresting that Kate Bush’s recent album “50 Words for Snow”, is available on Vinyl, CD and 24/96 download from her website. The recordings were made onto analogue tape and then mastered at 24/96.\n\nLossless formats\n\nWAVE or.wav are uncompressed music files (PC format)\n\nAIFF or .aiff are the same as .wav but Mac format but with adittional tagging information eg. for track names etc. Mac’s can play .wavs anyway !\n\nFree Lossless Audio Codec FLAC (.flac)\n\nApple Lossless Audio Codec ALAC (.m4a)\n\nControversially, I and many others have tried experimenting with these formats and have found that the UNCOMPRESSED .wav and .aiff sound better than the COMPRESSED formats, even though the compression is lossless. Speculation about why this is the case is based around the need to uncompress the music just before playing it puts a load on the PC which somehow increases jitter perhaps? I have not found an entirely satisfactory explanation.\n\nIn Summary\n\nAudiophiles across the world will argue which high resolution format is best but…\n\n1. Not all music is available in hi-definition format (hardly any pop music for example) and some music is available in only one or two of the high resolution formats – so ideally it would be best to be able to play all the formats.\n\n3. SACD has the greatest number of available albums in high resolution by a HUGE margin, but downloads are likely to catch up in the next couple of years.\n\n4. You can buy 1 device that plays ALL of these formats – a Universal disc player that can also stream audio from hard drive or network, most though will play the silver discs but not the downloads. Here is a player that does them all..Oppo BDP105\n\nThis costs £999 in the UK\n\nOther companies that make universal players to look at include Onkyo, Denon/Marantz, Pioneer,\n\nThis Denon is probably the lowest price universal to consider at around £450, click on the picture to read a review.\n\n5. For the ultimate sound you can use individual components to play the disc formats\n\nA dedicated SACD player (2 or multi-channel) will also play SBM CD’s any maybe HDCDs like this NAD M5.\n\nA streamer to play downloads – or a computer and DAC\n\nA dedicated Blu-Ray player (may also have HDCD playback) but probably wont play DVD-A’s – so you’ll need a universal player anyway!"
