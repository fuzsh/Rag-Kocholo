        "meta_description": "Image Here at the shop, we've been talking a lot about... Well, books, naturally. But also movies. So many of our favorite books have recently been adapted to film or TV, from Mac Barnett and Jon Klassen's Shapes Trilogy to Lessons in Chemistry. With this year's Oscars right around the corner, we decided to roll out the (imaginary) red carpet and host our own little awards show spotlighting some of the staff's very favorite book-to-screen adaptations. You'll find suitable viewing for readers of all ages in the roundup below — and you can find the books behind the screens nestled on our shelves. What are your favorite book-to-screen adaptations? Tell us in the comments, won't you? Without further ado: The envelope, please... Image Cathy Shape Island Based on the Shapes Trilogy by Mac Barnett; illustrated by Jon Klassen Mac Barnett and Jon Klassen's collaboration on Triangle, Circle, and Square created a delightful trio of picture books for kids to adore and adults to enjoy reading over and over and over again. Their work on the gorgeous, sweet and clever TV adaptation, Shape Island, shines through. It's a show I will watch over and over again, noticing new details each time. Purchase Triangle  Image Noah The Baby-Sitters Club (2020) Based on The Baby-Sitters Club by Ann M. Martin This family-friendly series captures all the heart and spirit of Ann M. Martin’s beloved novels. Storylines from the original books are updated in graceful, thoughtful ways, so the whole thing feels simultaneously nostalgic and fresh. Both seasons fizz with charm and warm humor, and the show’s more serious moments are always handled with sensitivity and compassion. Much like Kristy’s Krushers (real fans know!), this series hits a home run. Two seasons in Stoneybrook isn’t nearly enough, but take heart: There are something like 200 novels and spin-offs in Martin’s original run, plus a newer series of graphic novel adaptations from top artists like Raina Telgemeier, Gale Galligan, and Chan Chau. Purchase Kristy and the Snobs  Image Christina The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) Based on The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis I grew up with a mom that read to us every night and one of my all time favorite books was The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe. The magic of the wardrobe and Narnia had us begging for another chapter every night! Fast forward to my first year as a fifth grade teacher in the '90s when we used a whole language approach in a self-contained classroom. I used a novel every 6 weeks to teach a unit which incorporated all subjects. The fan favorite was The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe. This book was loved by ALL of the children — its fantasy element, rich vocabulary, and character study often won over non-readers. The best part of reading a book — and especially this one — is using your imagination to picture Narnia, Cair Paravel, the White Witch, and more. I was a bit nervous to watch the movie when it came years later out and worried it would clash with my imagination. I was not disappointed! As readers, we are able to see a \"movie version\" in our minds as we read and it's a bonus to be able to watch later when it comes to the big screen.  Purchase The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe  Image Liz Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret Based on Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret by Judy Blume Kelly Fremon Craig's 2023 screen adaptation of Judy Blume's classic '70s novel, Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret, solidly delivers every awkward moment of growing up as a girl. For Margaret, life changes when her family moves at the same time that she's starting to traverse the mine fields that make up adolescence. Bra buying, liking the right boy, getting or not getting your period, finding your friend group, and understanding your complex family dynamics all mix to a point of confusion and self-doubt for Margaret.  While watching this film, I felt nostalgic and at times embarrassed for my former cringey self. Certainly, I strongly believe you MUST, you MUST, you MUST read or reread the book and watch the movie. I give it five thumbs up!!! Purchase Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret  Image Cathy (Again! Shhh!) Percy Jackson and the Olympians Based on Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick Riordan The Percy Jackson series has been on bookstore shelves almost as long as I have been a bookseller. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover's adventures have always loomed large in our house — we are Camp Halfblood all the way. We barely survived the first adaptation of Percy Jackson and I reveled in the new adaptation on Disney+. It's an almost perfect distillation of the first book with some unexpected additions. This Daughter of Poseidon cannot wait for season two! Purchase The Lightning Thief  Image Caroline Heartstopper Based on Heartstopper by Alice Oseman Author Alice Oseman was involved in the TV adaptation of Heartstopper and it shows. It must be especially difficult to adapt a graphic novel because we already have so much information about the characters, but it does not disappoint. Kit Connor as Nick Nelson is outstanding and the scene on the bridge is SO GOOD! Purchase Heartstopper #1  Image Lynette The Hate U Give Based on The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas I bought a copy of The Hate U Give at the 2017 TeenBookCon because I was intrigued by the plot and its relevance to society. I had a hard time putting the book down as I stayed up late at night to learn how Starr, the main character, coped with witnessing her best friend Khalil shot and killed by a police officer after being pulled over late at night. His tragic death drove a wedge between her two worlds: her poor Black neighborhood and the affluent suburban prep school she attends. With the help of her parents, she learned to take a stand against racial injustice. I was anxious when I first saw the movie adaptation because I worried it might be unlike the book. There was no need — I thoroughly enjoyed watching it on the big screen!  Purchase The Hate U Give  Image Aerie Atonement Based on Atonement by Ian McEwan This adaptation is a masterpiece — gorgeous scenery, suspense-building music (the typewriter!), and impeccable acting pay perfect homage to a book that is one of my all-time favorites. Cecilia’s green dress becomes its own character, five-and-a-half minute one-take shot of Dunkirk is breath-taking, and Vanessa Redgrave’s perfect monologue directly to the camera as Briony are reasons alone to see this film, which should have won far more than the one Oscar it did earn. No adaptation is ever true to the book word-for-word, but this film is extremely close and 100% true in spirit to a perfect literary historical fiction novel.  Purchase Atonement  Image Jennifer G. A Gentleman in Moscow Based on A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles A Gentleman in Moscow is scheduled to release on Showtime Friday, March 29—Good Friday just got even better! I haven’t seen it yet—obviously—but I thought both the print and audio versions of Amor Towles’ 2016 novel of an “unrepentant aristocrat” sentenced to life in Moscow’s Metropol Hotel were worthy of innumerable readings and listenings. And a series starring Ewan McGregor as Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov? Now that’s something to look forward to! Purchase A Gentleman in Moscow  Image Cat B. Rebecca (1940) Based on Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier ‘Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.’  Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier is a majestic, gothic novel written in 1938 and translated to film by none other than Alfred Hitchcock in 1940. A favorite movie of my mother’s, I was introduced to Rebecca (and Laurence Olivier) at a very young age. I truly believe this movie was the start of my addiction to romance, psychological thrillers, and Hitchcock. Later, when I was able to sit down and read the novel, I was incredibly impressed with how easy of a read it was considering its age. It’s equally haunting and gorgeous. A true mystery thriller. Although I haven’t picked up the book recently for a reread, I will never pass up an opportunity to watch Mr. Olivier. Such a fox!  Purchase Rebecca  Image Kimberly Daisy Jones & the Six Based on Daisy Jones & the Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid Such a spectacular screen adaptation of Daisy Jones and the Six! Riley Keough is in fabulous form in her depiction of the talented and tortured Daisy, who grew up neglected by her parents in a dream world of the hottest music of her time. So determined was she to become a star that she boldly took risks and stood up to those who tried to take advantage of her. Never mind some of the terrible choices she made. An amazing supporting cast of characters, including Daisy's true love interest and his wife. Somehow you find yourself rooting for them despite their flaws. Purchase Daisy Jones & the Six  Image Valerie Wicked Based on Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire A film adaptation of a Broadway musical, which was adapted from a novel based on a previous series. The layers to this one! Gregory Maguire came to visit us right before the Broadway show opened for the first time. He said it was wonderful. It wasn't his story, but authors write novels and playwrights write plays. Now at last the movie will open in November. I loved the book. So many themes — love, rejection, and acceptance. We saw the trailer for the movie during the Super Bowl. Wow. Even Greg said he would go to the theater for it.  Purchase Wicked  Image Jean Brooklyn Based on Brooklyn by Colm Tóibín Colm Tóibín's 2009 novel Brooklyn, set in Brooklyn in the early 1950s, follows a young Irishwoman’s journey across the ocean to make a new life for herself in America. Battling seasickness and homesickness, in the end she must choose where to call home. So lovely in its simplicity, with a good tug on the heartstrings. With Saoirse Ronan in the lead role, the 2015 adaptation directed by John Crowley and written by Nick Hornby is stunning! Purchase Brooklyn  Lessons in Chemistry Based on Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus Released in April 2022, Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus is a blockbuster feminist tale of a brilliant young woman who finds her voice as the host of a cooking show after her career path as a chemist is thwarted by the patriarchal society of the 1960s. It made me happy, it made me angry, it made me laugh and cry, and it renewed my respect for all those courageous women who came before.  In 2023, the television miniseries based on the novel began streaming on Apple TV+ with some big shoes to fill. But does an admirable job bringing the story to life! Purchase Lessons in Chemistry",
