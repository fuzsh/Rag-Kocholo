        "text": "Asian representation in Hollywood has been on a meteoric rise, enjoying considerable success across film and television with shows such as Bling Empire, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Parasite. The biggest winner, Everything Everywhere All at Once made huge waves on the awards circuit this year, sweeping up seven Academy Awards including Best Picture and three out of four major acting awards.\n\nIn light of this historic achievement for Asian representation in Hollywood, let's take a look at the evolution of Asian American representation in film and literature. From fresh-off-the-boat immigrants to crazy rich socialites, here is how the portrayal of the Asian identity has changed.\n\nThe Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan\n\nStructured just like a Mahjong game, Amy Tan’s The Joy Luck Club is a collection of sixteen stories, following eight women, four Chinese immigrants, and their four American born daughters, across two time periods — past and present.\n\nIn the novel, the older women speak of fleeing from war, of scheming concubines and children lost while their daughters become chess champions and piano prodigies. Still, their daughters face their own problems and each character must contend with the challenge of being a Chinese woman.\n\nOriginally published in 1989, this novel is quintessential reading for those who wish to understand how far the Asian American community has come over the span of a few decades.\n\nGet the book here: Physical Copy, eBook, Audiobook\n\nFresh Off the Boat by Eddie Huang\n\nThis title will be familiar to most of us since it serves as the basis for a similarly-named, wildly popular American sitcom. Fresh Off the Boat (the television series) skyrocketed Constance Wu into superstar status with her turn as no-nonsense, Taiwanese-American tiger mother, Jessica Li.\n\nFresh Off the Boat (the book) is a memoir by lawyer, fashion designer and restauranteur, Eddie Huang, and chronicles his childhood in the suburbia in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn this memoir, Huang demolishes the image of the mild-mannered, subservient Asian man with his candid and sometimes, crude, confessions of growing up Chinese in a community that doesn’t quite understand what that is yet…\n\nGet the book here: Physical Copy, eBook, Audiobook\n\nTo All the Boys I’ve Loved Before by Jenny Han\n\nTo All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is the first of a trilogy and its three film adaptations are among Netflix’s most successful film franchises. However, what distinguishes this series from other teen romcoms is its lead — a Korean-American teenager.\n\nThe plot is simple: Lara Jean Song Covey experiences a sudden spike in her love life when someone steals the love letters that she had written in private and mails them to their intended recipients.\n\nHan’s books and their films are significant for Asian American representation because they mark a shift away from the immigrant narrative. In this contemporary chick flick, a Korean-American teenager is more than the colour of her skin and can simply just be a teenager.\n\nGet the book here: Physical Copy, eBook, Audiobook\n\nCrazy Rich Asians by Kevin Kwan\n\nMost of us Singaporeans know this film — it’s the first time our little Red Dot has been depicted in a Hollywood movie in such a glorious fashion, with Henry Golding and Constance Wu partying it up at CHIJmes and Gardens by the Bay.\n\nWhile the film is a fairly faithful adaptation of its source material, Kwan’s novel is fleshed-out with far more detail and fans of the film would not want to miss this one!\n\nGet the book here: Physical Copy, eBook, Audiobook\n\nAmerican Born Chinese by Gene Luen Yang\n\nDisney+’s latest teen superhero television series is an adaptation of Gene Luen Yang’s comic book series, American Born Chinese. This comic book is heavily inspired by Yang’s own childhood as a Chinese-American minority while also serving as a way for him to embrace his Chinese heritage.\n\nThe series revolves around the life of Jin, a Chinese American teenager trying to balance typical teenage struggles with being a Chinese person. However, Jin finds himself thrust into the centre of a celestial conflict when he befriends a new student with a mythological origin.\n\nThe series stars Michelle Yeoh as the Goddess of Mercy, Guan Yin, herself while Malaysian actress Yeo Yann Yan makes her Hollywood debut as Jin’s mother, Christine, patiently dishing out grounded advice.\n\nGet the book here: Physical Copy, eBook\n\nBonus: The Hundred-Foot Journey by Richard C. Morais\n\nWhile this list has mostly focused on East Asian American literature, the Asian immigrant and second-culture kid experience is far more diverse.\n\nBeyond the stereotype of educated, upper-middle-class professionals, Asian immigrants consists of an extensive range of ethnic groups and come from vastly different social classes.\n\nRichard Morais’ The Hundred-Foot Journey details the life of an Indian-Muslim asylum seeker as he makes his way from the streets of Mumbai to the kitchens of a French Michelin-starred restaurant. The novel was adapted into a film of the same name, starring Helen Mirren and produced by Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThe New York Times has described this novel as “Slumdog Millionaire meets Ratatouille”. Set in the rural, French countryside, Morais’ novel is a reflection of the fact that there are also Arab and Indian immigrants moving to other places besides the US.\n\nGet the book here: eBook"
