        "text": "A few weeks ago, I was asked what I do for a living. When I said, ‘I’m an author,’ the gentleman said, ‘Oh, what do you write? Crime?’\n\n‘No, romantic comedies.’\n\n‘What, like Dame Barbara Cartland?’\n\n‘Er, no. She wrote historical romance.’\n\n‘So not like that E. L. James either then?’\n\n‘No. She writes erotica.’\n\nHe looked disappointed by this and sloped off, presumably to go and lose himself in a gritty murder or a rampant bodice-ripper.\n\nWhat Is A Book Genre?\n\nSo what genre is your book and how would you describe it?\n\nIn simplistic terms, a genre is the category or style of a book – for example, romance, crime or horror. It comes from the French word, for ‘type.’ In essence, it describes the type of story being told.\n\nThere are many book genres, ranging from dystopian to horror (more on that soon) but two of the most popular book genres, in terms of sales figures right now, are romance and crime.\n\nBestselling names in the romance genre include authors such as Danielle Steele and Sophie Kinsella, whilst for crime, authors such as Ian Rankin and Martina Cole reign supreme.\n\nRomance has an enduring, escapist appeal and has seen a huge variety of its authors and titles consistently topping the bestseller charts for a number of years. The tales of love overcoming adversity, sometimes whilst in sun-soaked climates, set in sprawling castles or with a good dose of humour, continue to enchant and enthral readers of all ages and from a wide demographic.\n\nRomance Subgenres\n\nBut, to make things more complicated, there are also subgenres within each genre. As my Cartland vs E. L. James example shows above, just because there’s a lot of kissing in two different books doesn’t mean the reader is going to get the same kind of romance in both.\n\nSo, when looking at genre, it’s important to also consider subgenres. In romance, the subgenres are plenty – often crossing over into other genres:\n\nRomantic comedy\n\nParanormal romance\n\nFantasy romance\n\nQueer romance\n\nChristian romance\n\nYoung adult romance\n\nNew adult romance\n\nHistorical romance\n\nRegency romance\n\nContemporary romance\n\nErotic romance\n\nRomanic suspense\n\nThe list goes on…and, much like love itself, there’s something for everyone.\n\nCrime Subgenres\n\nBut readers, and authors, don’t always stick to enjoying just one genre. As I’m an author of romantic comedies, you won’t be surprised to learn that romance is my favourite genre, but I am in no way adverse to any others. I have just finished reading The Affair by Hilary Boyd, an often dark thriller about a married woman having an affair, who then finds that her ex-lover begins to stalk her.\n\nAs most writers know, reading across all genres helps hone your craft enormously.\n\nIn recent times, crime and thriller novels have seen a huge resurgence in popularity. Perhaps due to the odd times we are living in, it is the appeal of good triumphing over evil and justice prevailing, which explains why so many readers are keen to lose themselves amongst their pages.\n\nCosy crime, described as a gentler form of the crime genre, has also seen a massive rise in readership in recent times. Authors like Richard Osman and M.C Beaton are hugely popular in this book category.\n\nLet’s look at some more crime and thriller subgenres:\n\nCosy mysteries\n\nClassic detective/PI\n\nPolice procedural\n\nHard-boiled crime\n\nThrillers (legal, medical, forensic, military)\n\nSuspense thriller\n\nPsychological thriller\n\nBook Genre List\n\nThere are frequent debates as to how many different book genres exist. During my research for this article, I read claims that there were approximately thirty-five varying book genres, whilst other articles insisted there were around fifty.\n\nI have therefore pulled together a book genre list (excluding subgenres) which I consider to be the most prominent ones – with some details as to how they may be defined.\n\nFantasy\n\nCategorised by works including elements of magic or the supernatural. This can encompass high fantasy, like Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings and George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones, or magical children’s books, like Rowling’s Harry Potter. But it also includes steamy novels like the fae-filled series A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas.\n\nSci-Fi\n\nSci-fi stands for ‘science fiction,’ meaning it looks at outer worlds with a heavy leaning towards space, technology and science. Think aliens, time-travel or exploration to other planets. This includes anything from Star Wars to Ernest Cline’s Ready, Player One.\n\nSpeculative Fiction\n\nThis can encompass all the above – basically anything with a twist of magic – but can also include fabulism and magical realism. That’s to say stories based in our world (past or present) with a hint of magic. Think Chocolat by Joanne Harris, or The Once and Future Witches by Alix E. Harrow.\n\nHorror\n\nWhen you say ‘horror book’ most people think of Stephen King – for good reason. Horror is known for its frightening, often graphic, elements and paranormal elements. Anything from The Shining to The Invisible Man by H. G. Wells. A subgenre of this is Gothic books, such as the classics Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier and Brontë’s Wuthering Heights – think eerie and spooky, more than blood, guts and monsters.\n\nMystery\n\nFiction that includes a mysterious occurrence and a gripping plot to be solved. This can include a good old-fashioned Agatha Christie ‘whodunnit’, or bestselling novels like Flynn’s Gone Girl.\n\nCrime\n\nStories that incorporate a crime being committed and illustrate the protagonist’s struggle to solve it. Think Lee Child, P. D. James, and Martina Cole.\n\nHistorical\n\nBooks defined by a time period from the past. Fictional stories based in a historical setting such as the Bridgerton series by Julia Quinn or Gabaldon’s romantic Outlander novels set in eighteenth century Scotland. Or many of the books by Tracey Chevalier or Philippa Gregory.\n\nThriller\n\nA step up from Mystery, more edge-of-your-seat stuff, this fiction is often charged with lots of excitement. For example, a life-or-death scenario, huge stakes, cliff-hangers and action. Think of all of Dan Brown’s books, or modern classics such as Hawkins’ Girl on the Train or Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nWestern\n\nFiction focusing on the American Frontier. Genre usually set in latter 19th and early 20th century, centred around the lives of cowboys and gunfighters. Although more modern stories, such as Proulx’s Brokeback Mountain (as the tale of two cowboys falling in love set against the backdrop of bigotry and judgement) was a huge hit when it won the National Magazine Award for Fiction in 1998, and then went on to become a Hollywood blockbuster.\n\nRomance\n\nRomantic relationships are at the heart of this genre (if you’ll pardon the pun!) Stories may follow various tropes including star-crossed lovers, love triangles, unlikely lovers, and soulmates. As we saw earlier, it can reflect anything from Me Before You by Jojo Moyes to Jackie Collins’ works.\n\nErotica\n\nFiction designed to arouse the reader with explicit sexual scenes and imagery. The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy was the highest grossing book series of the last decade.\n\nDystopian\n\nPart of the science-fiction genre, dystopian novels usually describe a frightening aspect of the future, such as oppressive governments. Think Sweeney-Baird’s The End of Men, Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, and Mandel’s Station Eleven.\n\nLiterary\n\nLiterary fiction concentrates on real-life issues and, unlike commercial fiction which is plot-driven, this form of storytelling is a lot more character-driven. It also often has a more complicated or convoluted story structure, using a more complex vocabulary. Sally Rooney has had great acclaim in this genre with her books Conversations With Friends, Normal People, and Beautiful World, Where Are You.\n\nChildren’s Fiction\n\nThis is a broad subject that includes everything from picture and board books for very young children, through to Middle Grade and Young Adult. Classic Middle Grade authors would include Roald Dahl, and more contemporary novels would include Wonder by R. J. Palacio, Sophie Anderson’s The House With Chicken Legs, and The boy At The Back Of The Class by Onjali Q. Raúf. These books are written predominantly for 9-12 year olds, and often cover important life lessons.\n\nLikewise, Young Adult (for 13-18 year olds) is very varied in style, themes and content, and includes books such as Angie Thomas’ The Hate You Give, Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games, and They Both Die At the End by Adam Silvera.\n\nWhy Is Genre Important?\n\nYou might ask yourself whether the question of book genre really matters. Surely it’s the plot and characters that are important, not the category?\n\nWell, genre does matter as it acts like a building block to establish where your book will sit in the market and what readership it’s likely to attract.\n\nBy having an awareness of what genre your book is, you’re able to carve out not only your own unique voice, but also an audience who enjoys reading that genre of novel. You are enabling your readers to identify your book as one which they will enjoy reading.\n\nBeing able to neatly categorise your book into a particular genre means you’re creating a strong author brand in a genre where other authors have already established themselves. You’re creating a foundation for (hopefully) solid book sales and letting agents, editors, booksellers, and readers know what to expect from your work.\n\nFor a book to therefore become successful, the writer, reader and marketer must all possess the same vision and understanding of what the story is and how it’s being told.\n\nAgents And Editors\n\nIt also makes prudent sense to have identified what book genre your novel is, when the time comes for you to pitch to agents and publishers. Targeting the right publisher and agent for your work, via the genres they publish and represent, means that you will be giving yourself the best possible chance of achieving representation and publication.\n\nI once read a great quote from an agent who said, ‘Imagine yourself in a lift with the agent of your dreams. You have ten seconds to pitch your latest novel to them before they get out. How would you describe it to them?’ This elevator hook or pitch should draw in the agent, enticing them to ask for your manuscript. It would also, if it has done its job properly, give them an idea of where your book would sit alongside their current authors and in the market generally.\n\nFor instance – sending your completed manuscript to an agent who represents science fiction, when you have penned a rollercoaster 110k word espionage tale, is a waste of not only your time, but also that of the agent.\n\nBooksellers And Librarians\n\nWhen someone is looking for a book, the first thing they do is head for the shelves categorised by genre. If the genre of your book isn’t clear, and it’s wrongly categorised, then it won’t reach your ideal market.\n\nYour Readers\n\nEstablishing an author platform in the book genre you write in means you stand a good chance of readers of that genre returning for more. It’s therefore essential to create a certain anticipation in your prospective readership, so they know what they can expect from you. This is why authors often write in just one genre – and don’t spread out into others without either waiting to become very established or writing under a number of pseudonyms.\n\nHow To Identify The Genre Of Your Book\n\nTo increase your novel’s chances of success, you, as the author, together with your publisher, agent and marketing team, should have a certain expectation as to where your book will fit into the market.\n\nWhere do you imagine your novel sitting on the shelf in a library or in a book store? Which other authors would it sit comfortably beside? Is it a heart-warming romantic comedy, in the vein of Jenny Colgan and Trisha Ashley, or a political thriller similar to that of Ken Follet and Jeffrey Archer?\n\nBook genres often cause a degree of heated discussion amongst the writing, reading, publishing and agenting communities.\n\nEveryone, to a greater or lesser degree, has a different idea of what each genre represents. The question of what each genre should carry, can elicit strong feelings, not to mention very differing views. Even book covers in particular genres can cause much debate about their style and substance. How often have you read quotes on the cover of books which have said things like, ‘For readers who love Maeve Binchy’ or ‘For fans of Stephen King?’ This is a publisher communicating a book’s genre to its readership.\n\nThis is a clever marketing tool, designed to appeal to the loyal readers of these authors, that your novel is in the same book genre as these giants of commercial fiction and therefore they would enjoy yours too. The most important thing is that you, your agent and editor agree (or, if you are self-published, you are consistent with your marketing).\n\nSo, How Can You Define The Genre Of The Book You’re Writing?\n\nMy advice would be:\n\nRead a lot of books and see what elements are featured, and which chime with yours.\n\nFamiliarise yourself with the book genre options out there and how they relate to your book.\n\nIdentify the genre elements that are contained within your novel. How do they reflect those?\n\nPull together a short list of potential genres and also subgenres. How does your novel compare with others in those categories?\n\nConcentrate on the most relevant genre/subgenre for your book.\n\nThink about the audience of the books that you enjoy reading in your favourite genre. Are they the same readers who you think would enjoy your book?\n\nCheck out book genre labels which are often featured for each of the different book genres for Kindle reads. Do any of these relate to what you are writing? For example, words such as ‘dark’ and ‘conspiracy’ are often applied to books in the Thriller genre.\n\nRemember, you’re not trying to explain the entirety of your book, you’re trying to advertise its aesthetic. You are aiming to create a similar air of anticipation amongst the book-buying public, so that they too will be drawn to your novel.\n\nOnce you have done that, take a look at your own book and ensure your writing style, characters, and plot stick to one (at most, two, genres). For instance, if your spy is getting more action in the sheets than the streets, ask yourself whether you are really writing a spy thriller – or a spy romance novel. Then amend accordingly.\n\nDetermine Your Genre\n\nNailing the genre of your book is not the most important element of your writing journey – at least not to begin with.\n\nHowever, the importance of identifying the most appropriate genre and subgenre of your book, should not be underestimated. Finding that commercial aspect to your writing and to your novels is crucial, if you are to identify a reading audience for your book and appeal to their reading tastes – not to mention hook the right agent and editor.\n\nSo, have a clear genre (and audience) in mind when you start plotting and writing, and make sure you don’t veer too much into too many other styles and categories. It’s the first step to ensuring your readers will one day find your book and savour every page – no matter which genre it ultimately finds a home in!"
