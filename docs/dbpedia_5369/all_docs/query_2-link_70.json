        "text": "Known for her psychological thrillers and tales of obsession and betrayal, American novelist Patricia Highsmith left behind a surprisingly robust cinematic legacy: Her 22 novels and countless short stories have been adapted into dozens of movies and TV shows, including Strangers on a Train, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Carol and this year’s Deep Water. Now Swiss director Eva Vitija is turning her lens on the author with the documentary Loving Highsmith, which draws on the novelist’s newly published diaries and notebooks and interviews with lovers and relatives. Game of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie is voicing the literary legend.\n\nAARP Membership— $12 for your first year when you sign up for Automatic Renewal\n\nGet instant access to members-only products and hundreds of discounts, a free second membership, and a subscription to AARP the Magazine.\n\nJoin Now\n\n“Her image is determined to a great extent by … her reputation as a grim, misanthropic crime writer,” Vitija said in a statement. “When I began to study Highsmith’s notebooks and diaries and met with her former friends in various countries, I was extremely moved and surprised to discover a completely different person. It became clear to me during the course of my research and the filming of this work how powerfully the themes of her writing are determined by love.” The film opens on Sept. 2 at Film Forum in New York City and on Sept. 9 at Landmark’s Nuart Theatre in Los Angeles before expanding to limited release nationwide. Before learning about the surprising woman behind the stories, here’s your ultimate watchlist of films based on the works of Patricia Highsmith.\n\nThe adaptation: Strangers on a Train (1951)\n\nBased on: Strangers on a Train (1950)\n\nThe premise: In Alfred Hitchcock’s film noir classic, tennis player Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and charming psychopath Bruno Antony (Robert Walker) meet on a train. When their conversation reveals that they both have people in their lives they’d like to get rid of — Guy’s cheating wife, Bruno’s hated father — Bruno suggests that they “swap murders,” so neither gets caught. Highsmith’s novel also inspired a dark comedic version, 1987’s Throw Momma From the Train, starring Danny DeVito and Billy Crystal.\n\nHighsmith trivia: Only 29 when she published this, her first novel, Highsmith was paid a meager $7,500 for the rights to the film. For reference, Margaret Mitchell received $50,000 for Gone With the Wind a decade earlier.\n\nWatch it: Strangers on a Train, on Amazon Prime, Apple TV\n\nThe adaptation: Deep Water (2022)\n\nBased on: Deep Water (1957)\n\nThe premise: Known for erotic thrillers like Fatal Attraction and Indecent Proposal, director Adrian Lyne, 81, was the perfect fit for adapting the dark and sexy world of Highsmith, and this film is his first in two decades, since 2002’s Unfaithful. Ben Affleck, 50, and his then-girlfriend Ana de Armas (who stars as Marilyn Monroe in this year’s Blonde) star as the unhappily married small-town Louisiana couple Vic and Melinda Van Allen, who have an arrangement in which she’s allowed to have as many affairs as she wants as long as she doesn’t leave the family.
