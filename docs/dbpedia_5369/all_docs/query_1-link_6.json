        "text": "There are disaster films, and then there’s \"The Poseidon Adventure.\"\n\nReleased 50 years ago, the saga of survival aboard a doomed luxury liner effectively turned the genre upside down. \"Poseidon,\" 20th Century Fox’s big Christmas release, was the blockbuster of the 1972 holiday season, finishing as the year’s second most successful film (behind only \"The Godfather\") and becoming a cultural touchstone that influenced moviemaking – and moviegoing – for the rest of the decade.\n\nNot bad for a sea cruise gone wrong.\n\nThe film’s poster tells the story: “At Midnight on New Year’s Eve, the S.S. Poseidon Was Struck By A 90-foot Tidal Wave And Capsized &mldr; Who Will Survive?”\n\nWho indeed? Based on Paul Gallico’s 1969 novel, the story focuses on the handful who try: those who first manage to make it through the rollover and then, corralled by a fellow passenger, band together to find their way from what is now the bottom of the ship to its hull at the top.\n\nMore: 'The Godfather' turns 50: Why Frank Sinatra loathed the novel, told author Mario Puzo to 'choke'\n\n“We're cut off from the rest of the world,” says the unorthodox Rev. Frank Scott (Gene Hackman), who rebuffs the surviving crew's instructions to wait in place for a rescue. “They can't get to us. Maybe we can get to them.”\n\nEither way, he reasons, the only way out is up. So under his caustic self-appointed leadership, the small group begins its journey, battling the clock, debris, and in some cases each other as they brave a deck-by-deck climb through the overturned and slowly sinking vessel.\n\nFive Oscar winners (Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Jack Albertson and Red Buttons) head the cast, along with a mix of familiar faces (Stella Stevens, Carol Lynley, Roddy McDowall) and young newcomers (Pamela Sue Martin, Eric Shea).\n\nBut the real stars of \"The Poseidon Adventure\" are its innovative (and Oscar-nominated) art direction and the special effects that depict the oncoming wave swallowing the ship and then its slow rollover from inside – a decades-before-computer-generated image optical triumph that resulted in a special Academy Award for technical achievement.\n\nShot partially on location aboard the R.M.S. Queen Mary in Long Beach Harbor south of Los Angeles, \"Poseidon\" relied on massive Fox soundstages for the interior action scenes. Near-exact replicas of some of the Queen Mary’s key areas were created and a hydraulically controlled dining room set was constructed that would tilt as much as 45 degrees for the film’s stroke-of-midnight inversion. (A matching “after” set was also fashioned showing the room’s tables on the ceiling and its massive decorative skylight on what became the floor.)\n\nThe cast and crew navigated around fire, through ductwork and shafts, up reversed ladders and stairwells, over twisted steel, and across pools of water – lots of water – as they chronicled the journey towards the hull, the only part of Poseidon that remained above water. Director Ronald Neame shot in sequence, so the characters’ increasingly dirtied faces, bruised bodies and tattered clothes reflected the actors’ ordeals as well. Many performed their own stunts, notably two-time Oscar winner (and onetime pinup) Winters, then 51, who gained 35 pounds for her portrayal of a zaftig elderly grandmother and who managed an impressive seen-up-close underwater search-and-rescue sequence in a dress, exposed underwear and all.\n\nThe scene – Winters’ character was the rescuer, not the one being rescued – made an imprint: She scored the film’s only Oscar nomination for acting. (She lost Best Supporting Actress to Eileen Heckart from \"Butterflies Are Free.\") Overall, \"Poseidon\" was nominated for eight Academy Awards, in addition to its special technical-achievement award. It won two, for Art Direction and Best Original Song (“The Morning After”).\n\nFrom \"San Francisco\" (1936) to \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951) and \"A Night to Remember\" (1958) to \"Krakatoa, East of Java\" (1968), the disaster movie had long been a Hollywood staple. But the success of \"Airport\" in 1970 triggered a flood of new catastrophe hopefuls in search of similar box-office gold. The success of \"Poseidon\" accelerated the race. (Its box-office tally of $93 million translates to more than $600 million in today's dollars.)\n\nIn 1974, \"Poseidon\" producer Irwin Allen – a big-screen veteran most recently associated with high-concept 1960s TV such as \"Lost in Space\" and \"Land of the Giants\" – followed up with the skyscraper-in-peril epic \"The Towering Inferno.\" It was nominated alongside \"The Conversation,\" \"Chinatown,\" \"Lenny,\" and eventual winner \"The Godfather Part 2\" as the year’s best picture. And its success earned Allen the sobriquet “master of disaster.”\n\n\"Inferno\" was one of three disaster films released that year alone, joining \"Airport ’75\" and \"Earthquake,\" the latter presented with real-feel technology “Sensurround.” All were hits. Allen tried twice more later in the decade, though the critically assailed \"The Swarm\" and \"When Time Ran Out\" fizzled at the box office. By then, in the wake of other middling efforts such as \"Rollercoaster,\" two additional \"Airport\" movies, \"Meteor\" and Allen’s own ill-conceived sequel, \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,\" time had indeed run out for the genre. The disaster film was relegated to Hollywood's back burner until CGI arrived a decade or so later to give it new life in such hits as \"Independence Day,\" \"Titanic,\" \"The Day After Tomorrow,\" \"The Perfect Storm\" and \"2012.\"\n\nIn 2006, Storm director Wolfgang Petersen’s big-budget remake of \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" titled \"Poseidon,\" came and went with little impact, its clearly better effects proving no emotional match for the bare-bones, set-tilting, people-tossing original.\n\nNever hailed for its screenplay or nuance – Charles Champlin’s 1972 Los Angeles Times review asked, “Are the characters as gaudy and thin as cereal boxes? Is the dialog banal and shrill? Is the moralizing heavy-handed and relentless? Is the hokum a bit thick even in the context of a showmanship special? Well, yes. But who cares?\" Nonetheless, \"The Poseidon Adventure\" was an E-ticket holiday thrill ride: A tale of doom, offering the promise of a morning after for those who could hold on through the night.\n\nIn the end, only a handful of the handful could.\n\nBut for 50 years, it’s been a classic that moviegoers have flipped for, especially during the days of \"Auld Lang Syne.\n\n\"The Poseidon Adventure\" is available to rent or buy on Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play and other platforms."
