        "text": "While most moviegoers and reviewers take a “you know it when you see it approach,” fantasy is a tricky genre to define. Technically, any movie that contains “fantastic themes” can be considered a “fantasy film.” However, by this definition, all films that include magic, monsters, time disruption, and most superhero and animated films would be considered “fantasy films.” It isn’t necessarily wrong, but it makes for a muddled and confused genre. Fantasy is also sometimes lumped together with sci-fi, action and horror. While sci-fi and fantasy are speculative fiction and share similarities, sometimes you really just want a great fantasy film. This list of the best fantasy seeks to help by focusing on pure fantasy films that focus on central elements of magic, mythology, folklore and new imagined worlds.\n\nTop Fantasy Films\n\nThere are no sci-fi films on this list, but many people don’t understand the difference. Sci-fi explores a (usually) futuristic world made possible by technology, while fantasy looks at an imagined world where power comes from magic and not science. Fantasy as a genre is broken down into five major sub-genres. The one most people think of is “high fantasy”; imagine wizards and fictitious medieval countrysides.\n\nHowever, there is also “contemporary fantasy” which usually features magical or fantastic elements added to an otherwise mundane world. There is “historical fantasy,” which generally adds fantastical elements to a more grounded historical story. Historical fantasy is often combined with the sub-genre of “romance fantasy.” The least common sub-genre is “Bangsian fantasy,” which features fantasy stories about the afterlife. This list will feature fantasy from all of these sub-genres and films from directors like Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Jim Henson, George Lucas and Guillermo Del Toro. While the highest-grossing fantasy film, Frozen II, is not on this list, this compilation features films from 1939 to 2021.\n\n30. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl isn’t as fondly remembered by all as it should be. While the Pirates franchise went downhill quickly, the first movie in the series is a fun and enjoyable fantasy swashbuckler film.\n\nThe film follows a governor’s daughter, a blacksmith and the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow as they must break a powerful curse and steal a remarkable ship. Pirates of the Caribbean stars Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. The movie was nominated for five Oscars and earned Depp a SAG Award. The film was loosely based on Disney’s theme park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean, and animatronics based on the movie have been added to the ride due to the franchise's success. The film is streaming on Disney+ and fuboTV.\n\n29. A Monster Calls (2016)\n\nA Monster Calls is a coming-of-age fantasy about a living Tree that helps a young boy cope with bullying and his mother’s terminal illness in rural England. The film stars Lewis MacDougall, Sigourney Weaver, Felicity Jones, Toby Kebbell and Liam Neeson.\n\nWhile the film underperformed at the box office, it gained generally positive critical reviews. The film currently holds an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n28. The Fall (2006)\n\nThe Fall is the story of a stuntman telling fantastic, mythical tales to an injured child during an early 1900s hospital stay. Based on the Bulgarian film Yo Ho Ho, Tarsem Singh directed and co-wrote The Fall, which he also largely financed from his own funds.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival. While it gained mixed reviews, it was highly praised for its visuals. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and said, \"You might want to see [it] for no other reason than because it exists. There will never be another like it.\" However, that might be easier said than done because The Fall is currently not available to stream in the U.S.\n\n27. Big Fish (2003)\n\nBig Fish is a contemporary fantasy film based on Daniel Wallace’s 1998 book, Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions. The film employs a common theme of the fantasy genre: someone telling a story. In Big Fish, a young man tries to separate the fact from the fiction of his dying father’s life only to see magic and reality blend.\n\nTim Burton directed the film, which stars Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, Alison Lohman, Robert Guillaume, Marion Cotillard, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. Big Fish has a little bit of everything: witches, circuses, time disruptions, a mythical town in the woods and mermaids, giving it an almost fairytale-like quality. The film is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n26. The NeverEnding Story (1984)\n\nThe NeverEnding Story is a children’s fantasy film about a young boy who finds a magic book that transports him to a mythical world in need of saving. While it is a family-friendly drama, it is also darker and scarier than many other children’s films.\n\nThe NeverEnding Story initially garnered mixed reviews. However, it has found a dedicated cult audience. The film had a brief resurgence in popularity in 2019 after its theme song was used in an episode of Stranger Things. The song's use led to a spike in downloads, from 300,000 to 1.5 million a month. The NeverEnding Story is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n25. The Thief of Bagdad (1940)\n\nLike many fantasy movies (and movies more generally) of the 1940s, The Thief of Bagdad has an exoticism problem. The film features “brownface” and an imagined “Near East.” However, while The Thief of Bagdad has issues, it is especially notable for its cinematography and effects.\n\nThe film was loosely based on Douglas Fairbanks Sr.’s 1924 silent film of the same name and, more generally, on One Thousand and One Nights. The Thief of Bagdad has influenced films like Disney’s Aladdin and The Thief and the Cobbler, as well as video games such as The Prince of Persia. The film also used the first real chroma key process (a.k.a. blue screen), which has made it a notable work in the history of special effects. The film is currently streaming on Tubi and Max.\n\n24. Edward Scissorhands (1990)\n\nEdward Scissorhands walks the line between sci-fi and fantasy. While the titular Edward is made by an inventor and the film takes inspiration from Frankenstein, the overarching story is one of fantasy and magic more than of science. The film follows Edward, after the death of his inventor, as he is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter.\n\nThe film, directed by Tim Burton, stars Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price and Alan Arkin. Many have called it a modern fairytale and among Burton’s best works. Edward Scissorhands is currently streaming on Max.\n\n23. Willow (1988)\n\nWillow is the story of an aspiring magician and downtrodden warrior who must protect a baby from an evil queen. Ron Howard directed the film with a story by George Lucas. The film also stars Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis.\n\nWillow has mixed reviews, but many die-hard fans consider it a secret classic. The film has been praised for its effects, themes and inclusion and treatment of its large cast of little people. The movie has been spun off into books, a board game, video games and a 2022 Disney+ sequel series. Davis returned for the series, which has since been canceled and removed from streaming even after favorable reviews. The original Willow, however, is still available to stream on Disney+.\n\n22. The Dark Crystal (1982)\n\nWhile The Dark Crystal was directed by the Muppets’ Jim Henson and Frank Oz, it is a surprisingly dark film (as the name suggests). The Dark Crystal follows two humanoid “Gelflings” on a quest to restore a broken crystal and overthrow the “Skeksis,” an evil vulture-like species.\n\nWhile the film was originally met with mixed reviews, it has a dedicated cult following and has inspired comics, novels and a 2019 Netflix prequel series, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. The film is remembered mainly for its character design by Brian Froud, and it has been called the first live-action film without any human beings on screen (it features both puppets and advanced animatronics). The Dark Crystal is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n21. The Holy Mountain (1973)\n\nThe Holy Mountain is a Spanish-language surrealist film by Alejandro Jodorowsky. The film tells the story of a Mexican Alchemist and a Christ-like figure as they journey to the mountain home of a group of immortal wise men.\n\nThe Holy Mountain was Jodorowsky's follow-up to 1970’s El Topo. Both films have become cult classics and were praised for their unique and rich visuals. The Holy Mountain is strange and delightful in the way that an art-house fantasy film should be. The film is available to rent on Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n20. The Green Knight (2021)\n\nThe Green Knight harkens back to older high fantasy films but with a beautifully updated and current sensibility. David Lowery directed, wrote and edited the film, which is based on the 14th-century tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Lowery cited 1980s fantasy films such as Willow and Excalibur as inspiration for the film.\n\nStarring Dev Patel, Alicia Vikander, Joel Edgerton, Sarita Choudhury and Barry Keoghan, The Green Knight tells the story of King Arthur’s nephew and his quest to confront a mysterious giant, a.k.a. The Green Knight. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics and currently holds and 89% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is available to stream on Max.\n\n19. Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)\n\nWhile Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a farce and satire of the Arthurian genre, it also is fantasy film in its own right. The film stars Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam, who also directed the film. Gilliam went on to direct other fantasy favorites such as Time Bandits, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and The Fisher King.\n\nThe film follows King Arthur on his quest for the Holy Grail. While contemporary reviews of the movie were mixed, it has since gained a cult status. It is widely regarded as one of the best comedies of all time. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is available to stream on Netflix.\n\n18. The Shape of Water (2017)\n\nThe Shape of Water walks the line between a romance fantasy and a monster movie. Directed by Guillermo Del Toro, the film follows a mute custodian as she falls for a humanoid amphibious creature.\n\nThe film stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Doug Jones and Octavia Spencer. The Shape of Water was a critical darling and only the second fantasy film to win a Best Picture Oscar (after 2003’s Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.) The film is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n17. Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (2010)\n\nWhile fantasy films about the afterlife aren’t as common as other sub-genres, Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives gives a fresh and experimental take on the genre. Much like the title suggests, the film follows a man, Uncle Boonmee, who, in the final days before dying of kidney disease, is visited by the ghost of his wife as he reflects on the memories of his past lives.\n\nApichatpong Weerasethakul directed and wrote the Film as part of a larger project called “Primitive.” The multi-platform art project focuses on the Isan region of northeast Thailand. Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and was the first Thai film to win the Palme d’Or. The film is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n16. Wings of Desire (1987)\n\nWim Wenders’ Wings of Desire, or Der Himmel über Berlin, follows two angels as they oversee the lives of the inhabitants of a divided Berlin. The film stars Bruno Ganz, Solveig Dommartin, Otto Sander and Peter Falk.\n\nDavid Denby once called the film “the ultimate German movie,” and it earned Wim Wenders a Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival. The film was remade in America in 2003 as City of Angels, and in 2023, a second American remake was announced. The film is currently available to stream on Max.\n\n15. Labyrinth (1986)\n\nLabyrinth is a true cult classic. The film was directed by Jim Henson and produced by George Lucas. Starring Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie, Labyrinth follows a young girl on a mission to save her baby brother after Jareth, the Goblin King, kidnaps him.\n\nMonty Python’s Terry Jones wrote the first draft of the film based on the illustrations of The Dark Crystal’s Brian Froud. Labyrinth originally received mixed reviews; however, it has been revisited by many critics since then. It was the last film Henson directed, and his son, Brian Henson, said of the film’s legacy, “In his last days, [Labyrinth] was, in his mind, his one unsuccessful big venture that he had done in his life. And now, it is the most valuable and high-performing piece that he ever did.\" The film is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n14. Mary Poppins (1964)\n\nMary Poppins tells the story of a magical nanny and stars Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, Glynis Johns and Hermione Baddeley. At the time of its release, it was the highest-grossing Disney film and a critical hit, receiving 13 Oscar Nominations.\n\nThe film was based on P. L. Travers' book and directed by Robert Stevenson with songs by the Sherman Brothers. Mary Poppins is a true family classic. The film’s production inspired the 2013 biographical drama Saving Mr. Banks. The film also received a sequel, Mary Poppins Returns, in 2018. Mary Poppins is currently available to stream on Disney+\n\n13. Excalibur (1981)\n\nExcalibur is a retelling of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The film stars Nigel Terry, Helen Miren, Liam Nelson and Patrick Stewart.\n\nJohn Boorman originally wanted to adapt Lord of the Rings. However he pivoted, and directed and co-wrote a film based on the 15th-century romance Le Morte d’Arthur. Still, much of the imagery and set was made with a Lord of the Rings script in mind. Excalibur has gained a cult following, which has led to several documentary films about the film’s production. The film is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n13. Being John Malkovich (1999)\n\nBeing John Malkovich is a surrealist masterclass directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman. The film follows a puppeteer who finds a portal into the mind of character actor John Malkovich. It stars John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and Malkovich.\n\nRoger Ebert said of the film, \"Either Being John Malkovich gets nominated for best picture, or the members of the Academy need portals into their brains.\" The film was nominated for three Oscars, and Malkovich won an American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his role as himself. However, the film was not nominated for Best Picture. Being John Malkovich is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n11. Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)\n\nBeast of the Southern Wild is a dreamy tale about a Louisiana Bayou community that feels like a modern-day folktale. The film introduces Quvenzhané Wallis, who, at 9 years old, became the youngest Best Actress Oscar nominee in history. She went on to win the award. The film also stars Dwight Henry.\n\nBeast of the Southern received near universal acclaim. However, activist bell hooks said of the film, \"The vibrancy in this film is generated by a crude pornography of violence,” and criticized Wallis’ character Hushpuppy as “a miniature version of the 'strong black female matriarch.’” The film is available to stream on Hulu.\n\n10. Ugetsu (1953)\n\nUgetsu is a historical fantasy film about Japan's Azuchi–Momoyama period and civil war. The film is sometimes called a ghost story. However, it lacks many similarities with the American horror genre. Instead, the film tells the story of a potter and hopeful samurai who leaves his wife and is seduced by a spirit.\n\nThe film premiered at the Venice Film Festival where it won Pasinetti Award and the Silver Lion. Ugetsu went on to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design, Black and White. The film is considered to be a masterpiece of Japan’s Golden Age of Cinema. It is available to stream on Tubi, Plex and Max.\n\n9. Pan’s Labyrinth (2006)\n\nThe second film by Guillermo Del Toro film to make this list, Pan’s Labyrinth, or El Laberinto Del Fauno, is a Spanish language fantasy film about a girl who finds an entrance into a secret world ruled by a faun.\n\nThe film is a spiritual successor to Del Toro’s 2001 horror/mystery, The Devil's Backbone. Fittingly, Pan’s Labyrinth is darker than many other films on this list. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and went on to be nominated for six Oscars. The film is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV, and Amazon Prime.\n\n8. It’s a Wonderful Life (1946)\n\nWhile It’s a Wonderful Life is usually thought of more as a Christmas film than a fantasy film, the prominent inclusion of angels makes it fit into a fantasy film framework that explores the afterlife. The film is largely about the life of a depressed, small-town building and loan operator, George Bailey. However, the movie's third act follows an angel, Clarence, who is tasked to help George realize the purpose of his life.\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Life was directed by Frank Capra and starred Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed. The film was nominated for 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. However, it received mixed reviews, and the FBI, amongst others, thought the film was too communist in its messaging. It is currently streaming on the Roku Channel and Amazon Prime.\n\n7. Paddington 2 (2017)\n\nIf a talking bear alone doesn’t make something a fantasy film, the overall feel of Paddington 2’s visual world-building should cement its fantasy status. The film stars Ben Whishaw, Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Brendan Gleeson, Julie Walters, Peter Capaldi and Hugh Grant.\n\nPaddington 2 enjoyed a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, making it one of the highest-rated films on the site before a single negative review in 2021 took it down to 99%. The film follows Paddington, a bear, on an adventure after he tries to buy an intricate, antique pop-up book for his beloved aunt. The film has become somewhat of a meme, with many saying it is better than films like Citizen Cane and The Godfather. The phenomenon was referenced in the 2022 film The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, where Nicolas Cage watches the movie for the first time with Pedro Pascal’s Javi, who said Paddington 2 made him want to be “a better man.” Paddington 2 is currently streaming on Tubi.\n\n6. The Princess Bride (1987)\n\nAnother story within a story, The Princess Bride, is about a grandfather reading his sick grandson a book about the romance between a farmhand-turned-pirate and a young woman about to marry an evil prince. The movie features giants, miracles, fearsome eels and rodents of unusual size against the backdrop of a medieval-ish romance.\n\nThe film is based on the 1973 novel of the same name, and stars Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Wallace Shawn, André the Giant, Peter Falk and Christopher Guest. The Princess Bride has gained a cult status and enjoys a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently available to stream on Disney+.\n\n5. The Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\nThe Wizard of Oz is based on L. Frank Baum's fantasy novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The film follows Dorothy Gale as she is sucked into a fantasy land somewhere over the rainbow. The film was directed by Victor Fleming and starred Judy Garland. And, yes, while she wakes up at the end, it is still a fantasy.\n\nRoger Ebert wrote, “It somehow seems real and important in a way most movies don't.” The Wizard of Oz was nominated for six Academy Awards and won three. The Wizard of Oz has a long cultural legacy, including many spin-offs and re-imaginings, like The Wiz, Journey Back to Oz, Return to Oz and Wicked. The Wizard of Oz is currently streaming on Max.\n\n4. Spirited Away (2001)\n\nThis list purposely excluded animated films because, in some ways, all animated films are fantasy films. The nature of animation brings a viewer into a new world, and most, if not all, animated films include elements of magic and the fantastic. However, this list wouldn’t have felt complete without Studio Ghibli, specifically Spirited Away.\n\nSpirited Away was written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. The film follows a ten-year-old named Chihiro who is transported to the spirit realm and must save her parents from the evil witch, Yubaba. Spirited Away held the record for highest-grossing film in Japan for 19 years. Before Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron won in 2024, Spirited Away was the only non-English-language animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. It is currently available to stream on Max.\n\n3. Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (1977)\n\nWait, isn’t Star Wars a sci-fi film? Well, maybe not the original. Before Star Wars: Episode 1 – The Phantom Menace in 1999 and its introduction of midichlorians, Star Wars was a story about magic taking place “a long time ago.” While futuristic technology is heavily featured, Star Wars is not a vision of our future; it is the story of space knights and wizards in a forgotten past.\n\nStar Wars, also later called Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope, was directed by George Lucas and starred Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness and James Earl Jones. The film and its subsequent franchise have become a cultural juggernaut. It won seven Oscars and has become one of the most culturally significant films in American history. The film is available to stream on Disney+ and fuboTV.\n\n2. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\n\nIf you have to watch one of the films in Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, it should be 2001’s The Fellowship of the Ring. However, all three movies are must-watch films in the fantasy genre. The films are based on the beloved J. R. R. Tolkien fantasy novels of the same name.\n\nLord of the Rings stars an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving and Andy Serkis. The trilogy follows a hobbit named Frodo on his quest to destroy a powerful magic ring. The film was nominated for 13 Oscars, winning three. However, the third film in the series, The Return of the King, won 11 Oscars including Best Picture. (But you really should watch LOTR in order.) The trilogy is available to stream on Max.\n\n1. The Seventh Seal (1957)\n\nEven those who haven’t seen The Seventh Seal have likely seen it referenced elsewhere. Homages, references and pastiches of the film can be found in Monty Python, Sesame Street, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey and even the 1968 Oscar-nominated short film De Düva.\n\nThe Seventh Seal, written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, is a movie about a medieval knight’s quest against the backdrop of the Black Death in Denmark. The film is most remembered for its most famous scene, a chess game between the knight and the personification of death. The film grapples with the nature of a silent god and has a very dark tone. The Seventh Seal won the Special Jury Prize at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and has become a classic. The film is currently streaming on Max.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile there are many types of fantasy films, all great ones transport the watcher to new worlds and feature fantastical magic. Fantasy as a genre often favors cult classics, but whether blockbusters, Oscar winners, or hidden gems, these movies are must-watches for fantasy lovers."
