        "text": "It seems as though every other day there’s an announcement of a new forthcoming film adaptation of a beloved (or just new) novel—after all, where else would great films come from? It’s a huge deal to have your novel adapted for the big screen, but some authors probably don’t even notice it anymore. There are plenty of writers whose works have been made into many, many films—William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and Arthur Conan Doyle being the high rollers that immediately spring to mind. But with contemporary—read, living—authors, the field is a little slimmer. So I wondered—which living authors have had the most films adapted from their work (so far)? I wondered, I searched, and then I made this infographic. (Click to enlarge.)\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nSome notes on methodology: first of all, this information doesn’t exist in any organized place (until now), so I had to search film adaptations author by author. If I’ve missed someone, this is why. In fact, I’m sure I’ve missed someone, but all research has to stop somewhere. Next, I wasn’t picky about source material: movies adapted from novels, short stories, and novellas all count, though original screenplays written by novelists do not. I didn’t count sequels of films not themselves based on an original work—so The Mangler counts, but not The Mangler 2 or The Mangler Reborn. (I’m also not counting anthology films in which not all of the segments are adaptations, though this is only an issue for Stephen King, who doesn’t need any more of a lead.) On the other hand, single works that have been adapted twice (or split into two films) do get counted twice.\n\nHere’s a big one: I’ve only counted films that were theatrically released—so no made-for-TV movies. This changes the data a lot—for instance, Danielle Steel has more than 20 TV movie adaptations to her name (and only one theatrical release, in Australia)—but I think this way is more faithful to what we mean when we talk about film adaptations.\n\nYou had to clear five “actual” films to get on my list, which is a pretty high bar. Anne Rice doesn’t cut it. James Patterson doesn’t either. I’ve counted films slated as 2017 releases where appropriate, but nothing only announced or “in production,” because the movie business is unreliable and projects crash and burn all the time. Finally, for my sanity, I’ve only counted films based on books written in English.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\n*\n\nTHE DATA\n\nStephen King: 34\n\nCarrie (1976)\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nCujo (1983)\n\nThe Dead Zone (1983)\n\nChristine (1983)\n\nChildren of the Corn (1984)\n\nFirestarter (1984)\n\nSilver Bullet (1985)\n\nMaximum Overdrive (1986)\n\nStand By Me (1986)\n\nThe Running Man (1987)\n\nPet Sematary (1989)\n\nGraveyard Shift (1990)\n\nMisery (1990)\n\nThe Dark Half (1993)\n\nNeedful Things (1991)\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption (1994)\n\nDolores Claiborne (1995)\n\nThe Mangler (1995)\n\nThinner (1996)\n\nThe Night Flier (1997)\n\nApt Pupil (1998)\n\nThe Green Mile (1999)\n\nHearts in Atlantis (2001)\n\nDreamcatcher (2003)\n\nSecret Window (2004)\n\nRiding the Bullet (2004)\n\n1408 (2007)\n\nThe Mist (2007)\n\nMercy (2014)\n\nA Good Marriage (2014)\n\nCell (2016)\n\nThe Dark Tower (2017)\n\nIT (2017)\n\nNicholas Sparks: 11\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nMessage in a Bottle (1999)\n\nA Walk to Remember (2002)\n\nThe Notebook (2004)\n\nNights in Rodanthe (2008)\n\nDear John (2010)\n\nThe Last Song (2010)\n\nThe Lucky One (2012)\n\nSafe Haven (2013)\n\nThe Best of Me (2014)\n\nThe Longest Ride (2015)\n\nThe Choice (2016)\n\nJohn le Carré: 10\n\nThe Spy Who Came in From the Cold (1965)\n\nThe Deadly Affair (1966)\n\nThe Looking Glass War (1970)\n\nThe Little Drummer Girl (1984)\n\nThe Russia House (1990)\n\nThe Tailor of Panama (2001)\n\nThe Constant Gardener (2005)\n\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)\n\nA Most Wanted Man (2014)\n\nOur Kind of Traitor (2016)\n\nIan McEwan: 10\n\nSchmetterlinge (Germany) (1988)\n\nThe Comfort of Strangers (Italy/UK) (1990)\n\nThe Cement Garden (UK) (1993)\n\nConversation with a Cupboard Man (Poland) (1993)\n\nThe Innocent (1993)\n\nFirst Love, Last Rites (1997)\n\nEnduring Love (UK) (2004)\n\nAtonement (UK) (2007)\n\nThe Children Act (2017)\n\nOn Chesil Beach (UK) (2017)\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nJohn Grisham: 9\n\nThe Firm (1993)\n\nThe Pelican Brief (1993)\n\nThe Client (1994)\n\nA Time to Kill (1996)\n\nThe Chamber (1996)\n\nThe Rainmaker (1997)\n\nThe Gingerbread Man (1998) *Based on an unpublished manuscript\n\nRunaway Jury (2003)\n\nChristmas with the Kranks (2004)\n\nJ.K.
