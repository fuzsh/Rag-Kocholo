        "text": "'Beach Read'\n\nADAPTATION Yulin Kuang will adapt and direct the project for 20th Century Studios.\n\nPLOT January Andrews is a romance writer who no longer believes in love, and Augustus Everett is a literary writer enduring severe writer’s block. The polar opposites find themselves living in neighboring beach houses and eventually devise a plan to help each other get out of a creative rut. Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. January will take Gus to varied places that scream romance while he takes her to interview surviving members of a cult. They may be on their way to writing their next book, but they may just find love in the process.\n\nWhen teasing the adaptation, writer-director Kuang told THR, “I really enjoy writing Gus in Beach Read. I have this theory that an Emily Henry hero is a Yulin Kuang heroine. I spent a lot more time like thinking about this woman’s words, and the thing that I am drawn to in her work, they tend to be like the heroes that are more aloof, withdrawn, cold. So I really enjoyed diving in there.”\n\nCAST TBD\n\nDIRECTOR/WRITER Yulin Kuang is writing and directing the forthcoming film for 20th Century Studios.\n\nRELEASE DATE TBD\n\n'People We Meet on Vacation'\n\nADAPTATION A feature film adaptation at 3000 Pictures.\n\nPLOT For the last decade, longtime best friends Alex and Poppy have taken one week of summer vacation together. That is until they stopped speaking two years ago. When Poppy reaches out and convinces Alex to take one more vacation together, she sees it as her time to fix their broken relationship. However, there’s just one unspoken truth they have yet to confront. In the 2021 novel, Henry chronicles a slow-burn, friends-to-lovers romance with lots of fun travels.\n\nCAST Tom Blyth (The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes) will star as Alex while Emily Bader (My Lady Jane) will star as Poppy.\n\nDIRECTOR/WRITER Brett Haley is set to direct, with Yulin Kuang penning the screenplay.\n\nRELEASE DATE TBD\n\n'Book Lovers'\n\nADAPTATION Tango — the production-finance outfit behind Aftersun and Weird: The Weird Al Yankovic Story — will develop and produce the romance as a feature film.\n\nPLOT The 2022 novel centers on literary agent, Nora Stephens, and book editor Charlie Lastra who run into each other during a summer holiday in North Carolina. Despite the two already having met and not being fond of each other, their paths continuously cross in Sunshine Falls with the pair left to learn not only about each other and possibly fall in love but find themselves as well.\n\nCAST TBD\n\nDIRECTOR/WRITER Girls and Modern Love writer Sarah Heyward is attached to adapt. A director has not been attached yet.\n\nRELEASE DATE TBD\n\n'Happy Place'\n\nADAPTATION The 2023 novel will be adapted into a television series at Netflix under Jennifer Lopez’s Nuyorican Productions. Series producers will be Nuyorican’s Lopez, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina.\n\nPLOT Harriet and Wyn seemed like the perfect couple after meeting in college, but five years later, the couple has broken up — they just haven’t told their best friends yet. When they join their friend group’s yearly getaway, Harriet and Wyn choose to pretend to still be together rather than ruin their friends’ last hurrah together. After sharing a bedroom at the Maine cottage they’re all staying at and reliving memories, Harriet and Wyn struggle but stay determined to fake it for one week before returning to their lives. But will lingering feelings bring them back together?\n\nCAST TBD\n\nDIRECTOR/WRITER TBD\n\nRELEASE DATE TBD\n\n'Funny Story'\n\nADAPTATION Lyrical Media’s Alexander Black and Natalie Sellers and RPC’s Aaron Ryder and Andrew Swett are attached to produce the feature film. Lyrical’s Jon Rosenberg and Henry are set to executive produce. RPC’s Emma Rappold will co-produce.\n\nPLOT The novel, released in April, centers on protagonists Daphne and Miles, whose exes are dating. Daphne, a children’s librarian, is heartbroken when her fiancé Peter leaves her after realizing his true feelings for his childhood best friend Petra. But after she’s left with a now-empty home, Daphne becomes roommates with Petra’s ex, Miles. The two eventually hatch a plan to get back at their exes by pretending to be together, but things take a turn when the pair just might unexpectedly fall in love.\n\nCAST TBD\n\nDIRECTOR/WRITER No director is attached yet, but Henry is writing the script for the adaptation, which is the first of her works that she is adapting by herself.\n\nRELEASE DATE TBD"
