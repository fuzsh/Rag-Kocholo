        "text": "Film adaptations of books gross 44% more at the U.K. box office and a full 53% more worldwide than films from original screenplays, according to research commissioned by the Publishers Association and produced by Frontier Economics.\n\nThe report also found that 43% of the top 20 highest-grossing films in the U.K. from 2007 to 2016 were book-based and another 9% were based on comic books. Data for the report was compiled from a variety of sources, publishing industry magazine The Bookseller notes, incorporating case studies and publically available information alongside contributions from the BBC, UK Theatre and Nielsen BookScan.\n\n\"In short, published material is the basis of 52% of top U.K. films in the last 10 years, and accounts for an even higher share of revenue from these leading performers, at 61% of U.K. box office gross and 65% of worldwide gross,\" says the report, adding later that \"Across any of the common measures of viewership, book adaptations on average outperform shows based on original scripts or on comic books and other sources.\"\n\nMovies based on books tend to boost sales of their source material as well, the report found. In one case study, the film adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's My Cousin Rachel drove sales of the thriller so high that in 2017 alone, the book sold 23% of all sales since 1992 both in value and in volume. Similarly, the television adaptation of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale was no doubt responsible for the boost in sales of the dystopian novel in 2017, the same year Hulu debuted the popular series. Indeed, the report found that — across four major U.K. TV networks — nearly a quarter of the TV dramas aired were book-based, and these shows saw an audience share 56% larger than original scripts.\n\nSome films exist in a slightly gray area. The Harry Potter franchise, for example, is centered around J.K. Rowling's famous series but has eclipsed the novels to power the successful Fantastic Beasts spin-off movie series.\n\nThe news that book-based films tend to see greater success can be taken two ways: Either it's evidence that filmgoers love literature, or it's a sign that intellectual property that audiences have heard of tends to be more successful than original screenplays.\n\nNetflix likely didn't need to be told that books provide powerful source material for successful film and TV franchise-starters, given their August 2017 acquisition of indie comic book publisher Millarworld. The company, behind the comic-book-inspiration for the Wanted, Kingsman and Kickass films, can now publish its books in tandem with their Netflix adaptations.\n\nThe Publishers Association report doesn't have an answer for exactly why books are the basis for higher grossing films and more-watched TV. Perhaps film adaptations of popular books benefit from their market-tested and reader-approved plot twists. Whatever the case, the Hollywood IP-extension machine isn't slowing down: Upcoming book-to-film adaptations include How The Grinch Stole Christmas, Mowgli and Crazy Rich Asians."
