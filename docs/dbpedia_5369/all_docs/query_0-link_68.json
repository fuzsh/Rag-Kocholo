        "text": "We are rapidly becoming the all-star cast of the biggest disaster movie of all time, and tragically it’s a global success. Towering infernos blaze over Canada, the Canaries and Rhodes, Bangladesh, China and even northern England have had their own devastating Poseidon adventures while the whole world continues to reel in the socioeconomic chaos of the Covid contagion and in fear of an H1N1 outbreak. Only the dramatic effects are no longer computer-generated, they are real, and people are really dying.\n\nI went to the Odeon in the 1970s and was terrified and wowed by the disaster film genre. Since the late 1980s I’ve been watching the real world’s climate effects department ramp up its protests to our wholesale inactivity and disregard for the science that says, with increasing accuracy, that humanity is facing Armageddon. But there’s been another competing genre, the conspiracy/disinformation movie, the creepy corrupt B-movies released, not by Hollywood, but by big oil, not X-rated at the multiplex but woven insidiously into our lives as extras in this catastrophe… and the repeats, re-streams, re-runs orchestrated by those fuelling the flames.\n\nSo it’s time to rebel, or just moan and die: that’s your choice. The best rebels rely on good intel and need a secure base founded on the facts, so I suggest before you climb aboard your TIE fighters you watch and digest the following films. Because for all its frippery and Marvellous nonsense, some more valuable parts of the movie industry are trying to tell us the truth.\n\nIf I could add a movie to the list here it would be Roland Emmerich’s 1996 film Independence Day, starring Will Smith and Bill Pullman. I know, flag-waving gung-ho Americana, but it does have one significant message to address our current and greatest ever crisis. When the threat is tangible, an alien invasion, the whole world unites to address the bloody mess it’s in. All nations, all religions, all politics, all peoples rise to the challenge of preserving humanity. Well, climate breakdown isn’t an alien threat – it’s real, and we are one species on one planet with one massive problem and one last chance to sort it out. And Bruce Willis and Steve McQueen are sadly no longer available so you had all better find a bit of Smith/Pullman and start digging in for the fight for human life on Earth. Chris Packham\n\nChris Packham’s five-part series Earth is available on BBC iPlayer. The accompanying book, Earth: Over 4 Billion Years in the Making, by Chris Packham and Andrew Cohen is published by William Collins (£25)\n\n2040\n\n(Damon Gameau, 2019)\n\nAustralian actor turned film-maker Damon Gameau is a bluff, likable figure presenting himself as a rare optimist in a field of doomsayers: addressed to his four-year-old daughter, this decidedly upbeat documentary offers a constructive manifesto for combating climate change by the titular near-future deadline. He’s no academic, which is the point: a lot of his advice comes down to common sense, as he advocates reducing meat eating (without insisting on total veganism) and envisions a future without car ownership. But it’s helpful and energising to watch a film of such ideas, by someone who’s also just muddling along.\n\nBest for: Accessible, everyday prompts on how to start being more eco-conscious.\n\nAll That Breathes\n\n(Shaunak Sen, 2022)\n\nThe title of Indian film-maker Shaunak Sen’s exquisite, Oscar-nominated documentary comes from a much-treasured quote by the late mother of its human subjects, Delhi-based brothers and conservationists Nadeem Shehzad and Mohammad Saud: “One shouldn’t differentiate between all that breathes.” It’s the guiding principle for a film that doesn’t address specific aspects of climate change, instead surveying all aspects of an ailing, polluted urban ecosystem – filtered through the makeshift bird sanctuary run by Nadeem and Mohammad, where all life has equal value, and there’s no hierarchy of issues to address. Help and heal what you can, the film tells us.\n\nBest for: Instilling a holistic view of a crisis we can’t afford to compartmentalise.\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\n(Adam McKay, 2021)\n\nCritics weren’t enamoured of Adam McKay’s Netflix hit – a big, blunt, broadly comic allegory for the world coming to an end and nobody but the scientists being bothered – but it connected with the public, even spurring Twitter spats in which detractors were labelled climate change deniers. The film works by disguising the issues a bit: global warming here takes the form of a massive meteor hurtling towards Earth, but its manic depiction of social and political division in the face of the crisis does ring true. Naturally, Leonardo DiCaprio, a prominent environmental activist in his spare time, takes the role of the ignored, exasperated climate expert.\n\nBest for: Starting the conversation with someone who’d rather be entertained first, educated second.\n\nPrincess Mononoke\n\n(Hayao Miyazaki, 1997)\n\nMade in 1997, anime master Hayao Miyazaki’s dazzling historical war fantasy was rather ahead of its time in its stark warning over the consequences of humans plundering the Earth’s natural resources. It’s framed not as a tidy fable but as an epic battle between the residents of Irontown – whose expansions and thriving firearms industry mean the deforestation of the surrounding landscape – and the spiritual guardians of the woods, eventually arguing for compromise and balance between the two. It’s rousing, thoughtful and suitable for all but very small children (who may prefer the less artful but more benign animation FernGully on a similar ecological theme).\n\nBest for: Parents looking to seed awareness in their children of climate change and our role in it.\n\nUtama\n\n(Alejandro Loayza Grisi, 2022)\n\nNominated for a grand jury prize at last year’s Sundance festival, Bolivian director Alejandro Loayza Grisi’s debut film is a simple, lyrical drama about rural hardship and devotion that doesn’t declare its message in all-caps – instead trusting viewers to surmise the environmental threat in its parched, poetic imagery. But it’s foremost a story about people, as an elderly farming couple face being uprooted from the Bolivian highlands by severe drought, urged to relocate to the city by their well-meaning grandson. Loayza Grisi makes a heartfelt case against not only the natural destruction wrought by climate change, but its gradual eroding of indigenous cultures and communities.\n\nBest for: Bringing an intimate, tear-jerking human dimension to a vast global subject.\n\n70/30\n\n(Phie Ambo, 2021)\n\nGreta Thunberg may be the universally recognised face of youthful opposition to climate change – and duly got her own dedicated documentary portrait, Nathan Grossman’s I Am Greta, in 2020 – but this stirring doc from Denmark is a heartening reminder that she’s far from a lone voice in her generation. Phie Ambo chronicles the sizeable movement of young Danish people who took to the streets successfully to pressurise the government into new, bolder climate policies: the title refers to a pledge targeting a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030. Whether they’ll meet it, nobody knows, but it’s a strong reminder that activism yields results.\n\nBest for: Bolstering jaded adults’ faith in the next generation, and children’s in their own.\n\nThank You for the Rain\n\n(Julia Dahr and Kisilu Musya, 2017)\n\nThis hopeful underdog portrait sees Norwegian filmmaker Julia Dahr collaborating with Kenyan activist Kisilu Musya – who takes a co-directing credit – to chronicle the latter’s ascendance from drought-stricken farmer to community leader, bringing a valuable grassroots perspective to the global climate change campaign. Candidly chronicling his own agricultural struggles over several years via a first-hand video diary, Musya finds few easy solutions but gradually raises awareness among his peers: the first step in combating a crisis that nobody can fight alone. It’s a tough-minded but good-humoured film, which doesn’t impose a global perspective on its subject – instead making a local emergency vivid and immediate.\n\nBest for: A view of the crisis from the perspective of those most severely affected.\n\nThe Boy Who Harnessed the Wind\n\n(Chiwetel Ejiofor, 2019)\n\nAnother family-friendly entry focused on youthful solutions to the crisis, this time with a more individualist bent, this crowd-pleasing directorial debut from actor Chiwetel Ejiofor is adapted from a memoir of the same title by William Kamkwamba, a Malawian inventor who as a teenager developed a wind turbine from recycled materials to power the broken water pump in his drought-stricken village. It’s largely free of slick, Disney-style sentiment – we actually see the life-or-death consequences of the crisis – but still heartwarming, with an uplifting arc that stresses both personal self-improvement and communal healing.\n\nBest for: Empowering overwhelmed young people who may feel they have nothing to bring to the fight.\n\nDavid Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet\n\n(Alastair Fothergill, Jonathan Hughes, Keith Scholey, 2020)\n\nAt this point in his career, 97-year-old David Attenborough is more than just a national treasure: for the country’s more secular population, he may be the closest thing we have to a voice of God, deeply wise and connected to the natural world. Who better, then, to give us all a bit of a talking-to? Breaking from the enraptured tone of his many wildlife specials, the eminent naturalist instead offers a sober, sorrowful reflection on the damage we’ve collectively done to a world he won’t share with us much longer – before pivoting, more encouragingly, to plans for repair and renewal, leaving us to make the next move.\n\nBest for: Hard truths and tough love from one of the world’s most unifying figures.\n\nFirst Reformed\n\n(Paul Schrader, 2017)\n\nEnvironmental discussion and devout Christian doctrine don’t always sit well together: those who believe the planet was created by divine forces can be sceptical about man’s capacity to destroy it. Veteran auteur Paul Schrader’s thorny, challenging parable addresses that conflict in its story of an upstate New York priest (a superb Ethan Hawke) who, persuaded by a radical environmentalist in his parish, argues for climate change as a matter of Christian stewardship. This being small-town America, not everyone agrees. Bringing contemporary eco-consciousness to a classical story of faith in crisis, the film offers little comfort or counsel, but it’s a provocative conversation piece.\n\nBest for: Starting the debate with those who see climate denial as a religious matter.\n\nAn Inconvenient Truth\n\n(Davis Guggenheim, 2006)\n\nA surprise commercial success in 2006 that wound up taking two Oscars, this instructive documentary by Davis Guggenheim – presented with square, genial dad energy by nearly-president Al Gore – may not have been the first film on climate change, but it brought the subject firmly into the mainstream. Today, its teacherly PowerPoint-style presentation may seem a bit dated (it wasn’t especially cutting-edge then, either), but its points still hit home. Plus, it served as a primer for other US politicians looking to speak on the issue: Gore’s legacy extends to the recent doc To the End, about young women in power (including congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) fighting for a Green New Deal.\n\nBest for: A straight-up, bullet-point breakdown of the facts.\n\nBurning\n\n(Eva Orner, 2021)\n\nA sharp, palpably angry Australian documentary that addresses a local environmental calamity with escalating global resonance, Eva Orner’s film analyses the bushfire crisis that tore through Australia in the summer of 2019-20. Seen from multiple points of view – the residents affected by the blaze, the firefighters, tech entrepreneurs proposing solutions and, most fiercely, the politicians who were ill prepared for the crisis and its consequences – it’s a harrowing vision of a world literally on fire. With casualties ranging from humans to koalas, it’s a bitter warning to other countries merely waiting for disaster to strike.\n\nBest for: A regionally specific snapshot of a terrifying global threat.\n\nHow to Blow Up a Pipeline\n\n(Daniel Goldhaber, 2022)\n\nAs the comparatively mild symbolic protests of Just Stop Oil continue to make headlines and divide public opinion, Daniel Goldhaber’s urgent indie thriller invites audiences to consider the implications of more extreme activism – and at what point it tips over into terrorism. Inspired by ideas in Andreas Malm’s nonfiction book of the same name, it follows a young group of eco warriors as they plot to destroy a section of Texas oil infrastructure, neither entirely endorsing nor condemning their quest. Tense and bristling with both in-the-moment anxiety and fear for the future, it should stop short any hand-wringing over chucking orange confetti on George Osborne.\n\nBest for: Fuelling the ongoing debate over more aggressive environmental action.\n\nHow to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can’t Change\n\n(Josh Fox, 2016)\n\nThe title may sound like a riff on the nihilism of Stanley Kubrick’s nuclear crisis comedy Dr Strangelove, Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, but this arresting documentary from US film-maker Josh Fox – who previously made the influential anti-fracking doc Gasland – pinballs wildly between doomy prophecy and a motivating call to arms, thus mirroring the erratic desperation many of us are feeling. Travelling the world to witness climate change’s most visible zones of impact, Fox doesn’t go easy on the audience, but does point to ways for us to live with what we’ve wrought.\n\nBest for: Climate-anxious people caught between hope and despair.\n\nSnowpiercer\n\n(Bong Joon-ho, 2013)\n\nMany a sci-fi blockbuster has imagined a future planet facing climate apocalypse, but few with as much delirious imagination and pointed political ire as Bong Joon-ho’s breakneck action film – set entirely on a vast, globe-circling train housing the entire surviving population of a world that, having failed to combat global warming, has now been plunged into an uninhabitable ice age. So far, so silly, but it’s Bong’s depiction of entrenched class division in such a crisis – where dictators protect the privileged and the working classes sustain them, all in separate carriages – that rings chillingly true.\n\nBest for: A vivid vision of a worst-case scenario."
