        "text": "Impact Of Book Publishing On Film Industry\n\nFilms based on books make up 70% of the top 20 grossing films worldwide.\n\nOn average, films that are adapted from books generate 53% more revenue than original screenplays globally.\n\nAnalysis of book-to-screen adaptations shows that Fiction titles as part of a series tend to be the most successful adaptations.\n\nFollowing the release of a film based on a book, publishers can expect a boost in income from additional book sales.\n\nIn the four weeks that followed the “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” movie, its book sales more than tripled over the previous four weeks, with 956,700 units sold.\n\nFilm adaptations provide the biggest boost to a book’s Goodreads popularity, increasing the number of ratings by over 1,000%.\n\nBetween the years of 2007 and 2016, films adapted from books grossed $22.5 billion globally.\n\nAuthors are able to receive a significant amount of income from the success of a book-to-screen adaptation due to film rights, additional book sales and further publicity.\n\nThe Tolkien Trust sued for £75 million in 2008 claiming that they hadn’t received any income from “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy. The case was settled privately outside of court.\n\nAlthough Scholastic owned the US publishing rights to Harry Potter, they didn’t generate any money from the film series directly.\n\nSource material for English-language movies\n\nA study of movies from 1968 – 2002 showed that in total, books provided 35% of the source material of English-language movies.\n\nOf these book sources, Novels and other fiction made up a total of 33%.\n\nNon-fiction books made up 2%.\n\nOriginal material made up 54% which was the highest percentage of the source materials.\n\nOther sources including plays, comics and video games corresponded to 11%.\n\nA graph is given below to show the source material percentage for English-language movies:\n\nHighest grossing movies based upon books\n\n“Jurassic World” (2015) is the highest ranked movie based upon a book, grossing $1.67 billion worldwide.\n\n“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II” (2011) is the second-highest ranked movie based upon a book, grossing $1.32 billion worldwide.\n\n“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” (2018) is the third-highest ranked movie based upon a book, grossing $1.31 billion worldwide.\n\nEight movies based upon books have managed to gross more than $1 billion worldwide.\n\nA graph is given below to show the top 5 highest grossing movies based upon books:\n\nHighest grossing movie series based upon books\n\nFiction books within a series tend to generate the most success when it comes to adapting movies from books. Some of the highest grossing movie series of all time such as J. R. R Tolkien’s “Middle-earth”, Stephenie Meyer’s “Twilight” and Suzanne Collins’ “The Hunger Games” are examples of this.\n\nMovies based upon J. K. Rowling’s “Wizarding World” have grossed $9.66 billion worldwide, making it the highest grossing movie series based on books.\n\nThe series has been adapted into 11 films, with a gross worldwide average per film of $877.81 million.\n\nMovies based upon Ian Fleming’s “James Bond” have grossed $7.83 billion worldwide, making it the second-highest grossing movie series based on books.\n\nThe series also produced the highest number of films (27) in the list.\n\nMovies based upon Michael Crichton’s “Jurassic Park” have grossed $6 billion worldwide, making it the third-highest grossing movie series based on books.\n\nA graph is given below to show the top 5 highest grossing movie series based on books:\n\nAverage movie audience critical rating by source material\n\nA 2018 study found that movies based upon literary sources had an average audience critical rating of 66%.\n\nMovies based upon comic books had the highest audience critical rating, at 69%.\n\nThe lowest audience critical rating was for movies with original source material, at 62%.\n\nImpact of film adaptations on book sales\n\nFor the four week period that followed the movie release of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone”, its book sales more than tripled over the four weeks previous, selling 956,700 units.\n\n“The Martian” movie helped its book achieve 62,000 weekly sales in the days following its release.\n\nThe book also topped the New York Times fiction bestseller list for three weeks after the film’s release.\n\nIn the week prior to the film release of “Fifty Shades of Grey”, the book had a sales increase of 738% when compared to the three previous months.\n\nThe book sold 57,000 copies in the week that followed the film’s release.\n\nImpact of book publishing on film industry FAQ\n\nWhy are books often adapted into movies?\n\nBooks are often adapted into movies as there is a lower level of risk involved in its success.\n\nDue to the book it follows, the film should connect with audiences as it has a pre-existing fan base.\n\nIn recent years, fans have been able to utilize social media to share information between themselves, improving the chances of film adaptations becoming a success.\n\nBy working in this way, production companies can also save resources as the movie plot does not have to be created in-house.\n\nHow much do authors earn from movie deals?\n\nThe amount authors make from movies greatly depends on their rights agreements.\n\nMovie rights are often optioned rather than purchased outright until the producer can obtain a sufficient budget to create the movie.\n\nA standard option contract could be around $15,000 for three years, although this can vary greatly.\n\nThe contract is usually negotiated directly by publishers and agents, who look to charge between 15% and 20%.\n\nIf option deals expire, movie rights can be re-sold, generating more money for authors, publishers and agents.\n\nWhat are the highest prices paid for book movie rights?\n\nOften, details of movie rights deals are not disclosed. However, the following films were sold for confirmed values:\n\nThe Da Vinci Code: $6,000,000\n\nHarry Potter (first four films): $2,000,000\n\nJurassic Park: $1,500,000"
