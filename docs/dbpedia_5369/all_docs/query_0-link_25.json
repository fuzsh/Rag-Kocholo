        "text": "Jurassic Park, science-fiction film series that grapples with the consequences of reintroducing dinosaurs in the present day through laboratory cloning. The series, which now contains six films, was initially based on two novels by the American author Michael Crichton. It is one of the most successful film franchises of all time, having grossed more than $6 billion to date.\n\nCrichton initially wrote a screenplay in 1983 about cloning a pterodactyl by using fossilized DNA, but he had trouble selling the concept to film studios. He then reworked the idea into a novel about a variety of cloned dinosaurs engineered for a theme park. The original protagonist was a young boy, but the main characters were changed in the final draft to give the novel an adult perspective. Jurassic Park: A Novel, published in 1990, was an instant bestseller. The property came to the attention of the American blockbuster director Steven Spielberg, and the first film, Jurassic Park, was released in 1993.\n\nThe film takes place on a fictional island, Isla Nublar, which the wealthy industrialist John Hammond (played by Richard Attenborough) has purchased in order to build a safari park populated with live dinosaurs. The dinosaurs have been cloned from fossilized DNA discovered in prehistoric insects that were preserved in amber. An incident with a dinosaur prompts an investigation into the park’s safety practices by investors, who call in paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and chaotician (chaos theorist) Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). Hammond’s grandchildren also join the group for a tour of the park. The tour is interrupted by a tropical storm, which causes most of the park’s staff to leave the island. Matters are further complicated when a park employee, scheming to steal and sell dinosaur embryos, disables the park’s security systems, which allows some of the animals to escape. Chaos ensues as the island’s remaining visitors try to survive.\n\nThe film was an amazing success, eventually grossing (through multiple releases) more than $1 billion at the box office. Moreover, it made use of new animatronic and computer animation techniques, thereby wowing audiences with its seemingly realistic depiction of dinosaurs. Special-effects creator Stan Winston, who had worked on the film Aliens (1986), helped to build Jurassic Park’s dinosaur models, which included a nearly 20-foot- (6-meter-) tall Tyrannosaurus rex.\n\nSpielberg also directed the series’ second installment, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), based on Crichton’s The Lost World: A Novel (1995). This film saw the return of Ian Malcolm and the appearance of a new paleontologist, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore). In The Lost World, a team flies to a secondary island, Isla Sorna, where dinosaurs had been cloned by Hammond’s company in order to study their behavior in the wild rather than within the confines of a park. As in the first film, the humans must fight for their lives when their project does not go as planned. A new antagonist, hoping to get rich, manages to capture a Tyrannosaurus rex and transport it to the United States, with disastrous results. Although The Lost World was not especially well regarded by critics, it was still a box-office success.\n\nThe original Jurassic Park series concluded as a trilogy with Jurassic Park III (2001). With director Joe Johnston at the helm, this film saw the return of Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler. Grant is persuaded to visit Isla Sorna, where he and his party must once again confront the dangers of dinosaurs bred in the wild. Jurassic Park III drew mixed reviews from critics and is to date the lowest-grossing of the franchise’s films."
