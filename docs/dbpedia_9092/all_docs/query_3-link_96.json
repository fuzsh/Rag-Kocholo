        "text": "1995-96\n\nThe Mighty Ducks were one of the charter teams in the NHL's third jersey program, introducing one of the wildest jerseys ever worn. Known as the \"Wild Wing\" jersey, the front featured a sublimated image of the team's mascot crashing through a sheet of ice, and the back featured the player's name and number in a nearly impossible-to-read Mistral font. This jersey only lasted a few games before being retired.\n\n2003-06\n\nAfter going without an alternate jersey for three seasons, the Mighty Ducks try yet again with one -- this time, it's black with eggplant and silver trim -- totally devoid of jade. Also, the pants are now stripeless.\n\n2006-07\n\nNo longer \"Mighty,\" the newly-named Anaheim Ducks change their colors to black, gold and orange (an ode to the county they play in -- Orange County). Despite \"Mighty\" no longer being a part of the team's nickname, this team was the franchise's mightiest of all -- they won the Stanley Cup.\n\n2014-15\n\nThe Ducks' alternate home uniform that they wore from 2010-14, featuring the webbed \"D\" crest, becomes the basis for their new home and away uniforms. The home jerseys undergo some minor modifications, including a mock tie-down collar and orange trim around the numbers.\n\n2015-17\n\nThe Ducks introduce a new orange alternate jersey that pays homage to its original identity, complete with a recolored version of its original crest. The tail stripe pattern also harkens back to the original one, albeit no longer at an angle. The jersey was introduced with zero fanfare -- no unveiling ceremony, no teasers, not even a press release.\n\n2024-present\n\nThe Ducks return to their roots with a redesigned version of their original logo and striping remiscient of their original striping pattern. The primary color this time is a slightly darker shade of orange than the shade they introduced in 2006.\n\n2021 Reverse Retro\n\nThe Ducks introduce a white version of their infamous Wild Wing jersey from 1996. When the Ducks wore them for the first time on March 16, the names on the back were vertically arched as they were on the original Wild Wing jersey. One small problem: the official NHL style guide shows the names on the back as being straight across on a nameplate. So when the Ducks broke out their Reverse Retros again on April 24, they changed the names to adhere to the style guide."
