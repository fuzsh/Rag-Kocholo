        "text": "Ducks Unlimited is a nonprofit organization established in 1937 to conserve wetlands, grasslands, and associated habitats to benefit waterfowl, other wildlife, and communities. We have 644,000 members nationally, including 39,000 volunteers who organized 4,400 fundraising events in the last year. Ducks Unlimited employs waterfowl biologists, wetland scientists, engineers, fundraising staff, policy representatives, and administrative experts across the country.\n\nWetlands are areas that are periodically flooded and under normal conditions contain plants that require saturated soils for growth. They most commonly are marshes, swamps, bogs or fens. Wetlands provide habitat for more than 900 species of plants and animals. They also provide a host of benefits to people, including flood prevention, water quality improvement, coastal storm buffering, groundwater replenishment and recreational opportunities.\n\nConservation is the planned protection, restoration, and management of a natural resource to ensure its sustainable use and enjoyment by current and future generations. Ducks Unlimited conservation methods fall into three categories: protecting healthy intact wetlands with conservation easements or purchases, enhancing existing wetlands or wetlands that have been degraded, and restoring wetlands in areas where they historically existed but have been drained or hydrologically altered. The need is urgent: more than 50% of historical wetland area across the United States has been drained, degraded, or converted to alternative uses.\n\nDucks Unlimited takes a continental, landscape approach to wetland conservation. Since 1937, DU and sister organizations Ducks Unlimited Canada and Ducks Unlimited Mexico have conserved more than 15.5 million acres of habitat across North America. While DU works in all 50 states, we focus on landscapes most beneficial to waterfowl. Ducks Unlimited is a science-driven organization, using data on wetlands, water and waterfowl to guide our work.\n\nDucks Unlimited members are crucial for improving waterfowl habitats and landscapes across North America. Conservation is costly, and membership dues provide the critical dollars we use as matching funds in state and federal grant programs. Our membership strength also positions Ducks Unlimited as a leader in the policy arena, as we advocate for state and federal legislation that provides large-scale benefits to waterfowl, wetlands, and hunters. Also, being a DU member has some great perks!\n\nDucks Unlimited was established by hunters during the Dust Bowl era, who saw wetlands disappearing from the landscape in alarming numbers. We will always have a strong hunting heritage, but our mission remains steadfast: Ducks Unlimited conserves, restores and manages wetlands and associated habitats for North America's waterfowl. These habitats also benefit other wildlife and people."
