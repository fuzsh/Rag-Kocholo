        "text": "Ducks were not the first residents of The Peabody's lobby fountain. Rumor has it that turtles and baby alligators each briefly graced the fountain in the 1920s.\n\nThe Peabody Ducks are five North American mallards - one drake (male) with a white collar and green head and four hens (females) with less colorful plumage.\n\nDuck is not served anywhere at The Peabody and has not been seen on the hotel's menus since its 1981 reopening, quite possibly making Chez Philippe the only French restaurant in the world that does not offer duck.\n\nThe Peabody Ducks do not have individual names. However, the very first team of ducks were Peabody, Gayoso and Chisca - named for the three hotels owned by the Memphis Hotel Company in 1933.\n\nWhen off-duty, the ducks live in their Royal Duck Palace on the hotel's rooftop. The $200,000 structure is made of marble and glass and features its very own fountain with a bronze duck spitting water. It also includes a small house - a replica of the hotel - where the ducks can nest with a soft, grassy \"front yard.\"\n\nThe Peabody Marching Ducks have appeared on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” “Sesame Street” when Bert and Ernie celebrated Rubber Ducky Day, “The Oprah Winfrey Show” and in People magazine and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.\n\nThe Peabody Ducks have been a question on the TV game show “Jeopardy” and in the board game Trivial Pursuit.\n\nOriginal Duckmaster Edward Pembroke held the position for 50 years.\n\nRaised by a local farmer and a friend of the hotel, each team of Peabody Ducks lives at the hotel for only three months before retiring from their duty and returning to the farm, where they are free to live as wild ducks. With a return to the great outdoors in mind, the hotel recognizes its resident waterfowl as wild animals and does not domesticate them or treat them like pets.\n\nThe Peabody Ducks are mentioned in the 1999 Jimmy Buffet song \"Math Sucks\" in a line that says \"quackin' like those Peabody ducks.\""
