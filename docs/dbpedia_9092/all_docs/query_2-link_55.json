        "text": "ANAHEIM, Calif. — The Los Angeles Kings weren’t the only Southern California team bringing 90s nostalgia into their uniform set this offseason.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Anaheim Ducks revealed their new primary logo and home and away uniforms, using modern elements in conjunction with throwback features.\n\nFrom now on, instead of wearing black at home, the Ducks will sport bright orange jerseys, helmets and pants. The team’s previous primary logo, the webbed foot, has been moved to be worn as the shoulder patch and is slightly altered. Like the Kings, the Ducks made helmet history, becoming the first team in NHL history to wear orange helmets.\n\nThe new primary logo is an updated version of the team’s original logo from its inception in 1993: the iconic, duck-billed goalie mask logo popularized in Disney’s 1992 film, “The Mighty Ducks,” and created by Disney artists. Anaheim had brought this logo back on a few occasions, most notably on its 2015-released orange alternate jersey and Reverse Retro 2.0 top, but it didn’t return as a main logo, until now.\n\nIf one looks closely, they’ll find a “W” embedded in the tape of each crossed hockey stick, abbreviating “Wild Wing,” Anaheim’s mascot.\n\nThe logo’s updates include gold accents, a small triangle and an intimidating orange eye peering out of the mask.\n\nThe 2024-25 uniforms include a new bold typeface for the names and numbers, black, gold and white striping on the base and sleeves.\n\nThe new uniforms’ shade of orange is slightly darker, and the exact same as that of the Edmonton Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nThe away uniform is essentially a white version of the orange home jersey but with orange shoulders and sleeves.\n\nAnaheim’s original colorway was dark purple and jade before the team rebranded in 2006 to drop “Mighty” from its name and don black and gold with orange accents for its colors. Because the Ducks won the Stanley Cup in 2007, this new look became synonymous with success, and Anaheim never fully returned to its beloved original look, except for special occasions, including its 30th-anniversary jersey this past season.\n\nNo team will have an alternate jersey in 2024-25, so Ducks fans will have to wait for a third uniform.\n\nAnaheim fans won’t have to wait long to see the new home jersey worn publicly, as general manager Pat Verbeek will select No. 3 overall at the NHL Entry Draft on Friday.\n\nWhile many Ducks fans yearned for the original colorway to return, Anaheim represented its Orange County roots with a sleek, modernized uniform set. With a six-year playoff drought, the Ducks will hope for some uniform-changing magic like they saw in 2006-07."
