        "text": "Rubber ducks have a rich history that spans over a century, captivating both children and adults alike. Originally made from hard rubber, these iconic bath toys have evolved into beloved collectibles and symbols of playfulness.\n\nThe story of rubber ducks dates back to the late 19th century when the first rubber bath toys emerged. However, it wasn't until the 20th century that the iconic yellow rubber duck we know today gained popularity. In the 1940s, the transition from hard rubber to soft vinyl material made the ducks more child-friendly and buoyant.\n\nThe true breakthrough for rubber ducks came in 1970 when a cartoon character named Ernie from the popular TV show \"Sesame Street\" sang the hit song \"Rubber Duckie.\" This catchy tune skyrocketed the toy's fame and established it as a household staple.\n\nOver the years, rubber ducks have transcended their original purpose as bath toys. They have become cherished collectibles, with enthusiasts amassing extensive collections of unique and limited-edition ducks. The rise of designer rubber ducks brought forth a wave of creativity, with artists and designers crafting elaborate and themed ducks that cater to diverse interests and passions.\n\nRubber ducks have also made appearances in various forms of media, from movies and commercials to art installations. Their iconic shape and cheerful demeanor have made them symbols of nostalgia, childhood, and innocent fun.\n\nToday, rubber ducks continue to captivate people around the world. They are not only cherished by children for their playful charm but also embraced by adults as whimsical decorative items and collectors' items. With their enduring appeal, rubber ducks are set to keep floating their way into the hearts of generations to come, bringing joy and smiles wherever they go."
