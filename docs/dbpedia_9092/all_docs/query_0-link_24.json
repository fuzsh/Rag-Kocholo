        "text": "Feeding wild ducks at the neighborhood pond or local park might seem like an inviting way to bond with nature, but it’s not always healthy for our feathered friends. Ducks can find a balanced diet—including grains, grasses, aquatic plants, insects and crustaceans—on their own in the wild. But people often feed them bread, crackers and human “junk food”—none of which provides the protein, nutrients and minerals that ducks need. If you’re going to feed ducks, stick to nutritional offerings like cracked corn, rice and birdseed. And keep it bite-sized: Ducks don’t chew.\n\nEvery day, more and more wildlife habitats are lost to the spread of development. Your gift can help create more humane backyards to protect all animals."
