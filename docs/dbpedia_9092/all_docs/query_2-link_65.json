        "text": "If you're wondering what to do in Boston with kids, the Make Way for Duckling statues appeal to everyone familiar with Robert McCloskey's classic children's book about the duck family that makes its home in Boston's Public Garden.\n\nThe famous bronze ducks created by Nancy Schön located in the Public Garden near the corner of Beacon Street and Charles Street.\n\nVisiting Mrs. Mallard and her 8 ducklings is one of the top Boston kids activities for the under-8 set, but visitors of all ages love the statues.\n\nIn addition to the ducks, you'll find lots more to see in the Public Garden: gorgeous flowers and trees, the famous Boston Swan Boats, impromptu concerts, and occasional weddings.\n\nAnd don't miss the annual Duckling Day Parade in May - the favorite Mother's Day event of many Boston moms.\n\nTop Photo: Make Way for Ducklings statues in Boston's Public Garden, (c) Boston Discovery Guide\n\nBoston Discovery Guide is a reader-supported publication.

They find the Public Garden, and decide to spend the night on the little island in the Lagoon.\n\nEven though this beloved children's class was written almost 70 years ago, you'll totally recognize the Public Garden of today.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Mallard spot what they describe as \"a strange enormous bird\" pushing a boat full of people who throw peanuts toward them. Delighted by the plentiful food supply, they're about to make their home in the Public Garden when a child rushes by on a bicycle. Mrs. Mallard declares that the park is much too dangerous for ducklings!\n\nSo they fly over Beacon Hill and the Massachusetts State House, and finally find a nice spot along the edge of the Charles River. The book's charming drawings show the Esplanade next to the river, looking just like it does today.\n\nAfter the ducklings hatch, Mrs. Mallard teaches them to swim and dive. And finally, she brings them back to the Public Garden to live on the little island (now called \"Duck Island\") in the Lagoon.\n\nRobert McCloskey, author of the 1941 book, tells us:\n\n\"All day long they follow the swan boats and eat peanuts.\"\n\nAnd their descendants still do today. If you go for a swan boat ride, you'll see them following your swan, playing in the water, and napping on their island.\n\nNancy Schön's Make Way for Ducklings Statues\n\nEver since being installed in the Public Garden in 1987, Nancy Schön's magical sculpture of Mrs. Mallard and Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack has been one of the most popular Boston attractions for kids.\n\nMrs. Mallard is 38 inches high, making her the perfect height for children (and the occasional adult) who want to sit on her and pose for the camera.\n\nThe entire sculpture depiciting Mrs Mallard and her 8 baby ducklings stretches 35 feet long and is installed on a path made from old Boston cobblestones.\n\nA similar sculpture was given, in the name of American children, to the children of Moscow, Russia in 1991.\n\nBut you can see other examples of Nancy Schön's wonderful sculptures much closer to Boston.\n\nSpecial favorites are her \"Tortoise and Hare\" statues in Copley Square. She created these whimsical statues as a tribute to all of the runners who come to Boston from around the world to participate in the Boston Marathon each spring.\n\nOther Boston neighborhoods and Massachusetts towns where you can enjoy sculptures by Nancy Schön include Fenway, Dorchester, Newton, Wayland, and Martha's Vineyard.\n\nHowever, her \"Make Way for Ducklings\" statue remains the \"must-see while in Boston\" choice among visitors from all over the world, as well as local children.\n\nWhere to Go for a Quick Snack or Meal near the Make Way for Ducklings Statues\n\nIf you're visiting the Ducklings statues with your kids, they'll probably get hungry sooner rather than later - but not to worry, there are numerous affordable, family-friendly locally-owned places to eat nearby. You'll also see a couple of Starbucks but since you can go to them anywhere in the world, why miss to opportunity to experience some real Boston places?\n\nRight across the street (84 Beacon Street) from the ducklings statues is the historic Beacon Hill neighborhood, home to the original Cheers. If you've seen the 1980s television show, you'll probably recognize it. They serve good pub food - order a burger, chicken fingers, or nachos. There's even a children's menu. (If you want to see a re-creation of the inside of the Cheers shown on TV, you can find it at Faneuil Markeplace, but the one on Beacon Street is the place that inspired the show.)\n\nStroll down Charles Street to find a lot more choices. Tatte Bakery & Cafe (70 Charles Street ) offers fantastic pastries, sandwiches, and other savory treats. The Paramount (44 Charles Street) serves American \"comfort\" food and is almost always packed with happy diners. Further down the street, King and I (145 Charles Street) is one of the city's best Thai restaurants.\n\nMore places to eat and drink in Beacon Hill\n\nReenact Make Way for Ducklings: The Duckling Day Parade\n\nWant to reenact Make Way for Ducklings with your little ones?\n\nThe famous story comes to life each Mother's Day when toddlers (and their doting parents) take part in the Duckling Day Parade - one of Boston's best-loved spring traditions.\n\nIf you have young children, there's no sweeter way to celebrate Mother's Day!\n\nNeed cute duckling outfits? Amazon (#ad) usually offers a good selection. Order a size that's slightly too large, and your child can wear it again for Halloween.\n\nMore about the Duckling Day Parade\n\nMore Fun Family Activities in Boston\n\nFind a Hotel near the Ducklings Statues in the Public Garden for Your Boston Visit\n\nEnter your dates to see available hotels and rates:\n\nBooking.com"
