        "text": "Wood ducks nest primarily in tree cavities, which are hollow areas in living and dead trees. They will also nest in man-made nesting boxes. Like other duck species, females line nests with feathers. Females typically lay between nine and 14 eggs. Within a day of hatching, ducklings climb out of the nest and fall into water or to the ground. Being small and light, the jump doesn't hurt the chicks.\n\nAcorns are the primary winter food of choice, but the ducks also visit agricultural fields to feed on waste grain. Wood ducks will consume the seeds of bald cypress, hickory, gum, buttonbush and other species. During summer and fall, wood ducks feed on a variety of seeds, invertebrates and plants in shallow areas of lakes and wetlands.\n\nOften considered one of the most beautiful duck species in North America, the male is multicolored with iridescent greens, blues and purples with a bold red bill. The female is more understated than the male being smoky gray in color. She has white circles around her eyes and bluish iridescent feathers on the wings.\n\nFemale wood duck calls are said to be a high-pitched and excited call. It is a two-part whistle described as ooeek or uh-week. The male call is more squeaky, thin and rising in nature. Phonetically described as jeeeeee.\n\nWood ducks are a medium sized bird and are considered a perching duck, as they frequently can be seen standing on branches of trees.They have a crested head, the males more distinct than the females, a thin neck and a rectangular shaped tail. The wings are shorter than other ducks, allowing them to better maneuver through tree branches.\n\nMeasurements\n\nLength: 18 to 22 in (47 to 55 cm)\n\nWingspan: 26 to 29 in (66 to 73 cm)"
