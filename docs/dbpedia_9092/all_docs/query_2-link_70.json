        "text": "Animal Summary\n\nThe zoo's wide variety of ducks has come from various donations over the years as well as some being born at the zoo. Even some wild ducks come and stay occasionally to get free food and open water. Some of the duck species that live at the zoo are; Rouen, Muscovy, Pekin, and Cayuga.\n\nThe Rouen duck originally came from France. It resembles a Mallard duck in color but its body is bigger. It is raised for decoration or as a general purpose duck.\n\nThe Muscovy duck originally came from Mexico, Central and South America. It is raised mainly for food because of its stronger tasting lean meat.\n\nThe Pekin duck originally came from China. It has a more upright stance and is generally too heavy to fly. It is the most popular commercial duck breed being raised for egg and meat production.\n\nThe Cayuga duck originally came from England but legend has it the breed started in New York State. It is raised for egg and meat production as well as being an ornamental.\n\nFacts\n\nThe Muscovy duck has powerful claws that help them climb trees and roost on branches.\n\nThe female Pekin duck will lay an average of 200 eggs per year is she is prevented from nesting and hatching the eggs.\n\nThere are famous Pekin ducks. The AFLAC Insurance mascot is a Pekin duck and Donald Duck is modeled after one as well.\n\nConservation\n\nThe zoo's ducks are all domesticated breeds and are not in danger of becoming endangered.\n\nThreats\n\nThere are no threats to the population numbers of these domesticated ducks."
