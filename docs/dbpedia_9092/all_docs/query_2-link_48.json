(last accessed March 2018). We aim to map as complete data as possible and therefore estimate data for missing values. In some cases, missing data for very small territories is not used in the cartogram and that area is therefore omitted in the map.\n\nAll modifications to the original data source are noted in our data sheets.\n\nDownload data file"
