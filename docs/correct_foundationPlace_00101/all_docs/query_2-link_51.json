The Supreme Court ruled that:\n\n1) While Articles 448 and 546 apply by analogy to determine indemnity for improvements, Article 448 does not strictly apply because the owner built on their own land before losing ownership. \n\n2) The current market value, not construction cost, must be used to determine indemnity for the apartment building under Article 546. \n\n3) The case was remanded for a determination of current market value, which private respondents must pay before taking possession, or petitioner retains possession until paid.",
