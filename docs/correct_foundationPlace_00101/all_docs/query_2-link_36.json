        "text": "(2)\n\nThe values of all stock awards reported in this column, which represent stock awards earned in the applicable year and granted in the subsequent year, were computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, ASC Topic 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718). For a discussion of the valuation assumptions, see Note 15 to the Company's 2023 consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Stock awards consist of awards of time-based restricted stock units, which will vest in full on the three-year anniversary of the grant date, and performance-based restricted stock units, which will vest upon satisfaction of the relevant performance metric (five-year cumulative earnings per share) at maximum (125%), target (100%) and threshold (75%) levels and completion of a five-year service period. Any restricted stock units that vest will be converted to shares of Company common stock on a one-for-one basis. Restricted stock units that do not vest will be forfeited and the named executive officer will receive no shares of Company common stock attributable to the forfeited units. A holder of restricted stock units has no rights as a shareholder of the Company until such time as restricted stock units vest and convert into shares of Company common stock. The value of the stock awards reported in this column assumes that the performance-based restricted stock units vest at the target level of performance. Assuming achievement of the highest possible level of performance, the value of the total stock awards for the year ended December 31, 2023 for Mr. Potes, Mr. Burke, and Mr. Henion is $105,827, $53,516, and $36,934, respectively.\n\nName\n\n​​\n\nNumber of\n\nSecurities\n\nUnderlying\n\nUnexercised\n\nOptions\n\nExercisable\n\n​​\n\nNumber of\n\nSecurities\n\nUnderlying\n\nUnexercised\n\nOptions\n\nUnexercisable\n\n​​\n\nOption\n\nExercise\n\nPrice\n\n​​\n\nOption\n\nExpiration\n\nDate\n\n​​\n\nNumber of\n\nShares or\n\nUnits of\n\nStock that\n\nHave Not\n\nVested\n\n​​\n\nMarket\n\nValue of\n\nShares or\n\nUnits of\n\nStock that\n\nHave Not\n\nVested\n\n​​\n\nNumber of\n\nShares or\n\nUnits of\n\nStock that\n\nHave Not\n\nVested\n\n​​\n\nMarket\n\nValue of\n\nShares or\n\nUnits of\n\nStock that\n\nHave Not\n\nVested\n\n(1)\n\nDirectors may elect to defer fees otherwise payable in cash and instead receive payment in the form of ChoiceOne common stock pursuant to the Directors Stock Purchase Plan described in the narrative below. For 2023, Messrs. Armock, Burns, Burrough, McGinnis, and Nyblad elected to receive 100% of their fees in the form of ChoiceOne stock, Messrs. Brophy and Coulter received 50% of their fees in the form of ChoiceOne stock, and Churchill and Wendling received 25% of their fees in the form of ChoiceOne stock.\n\n(1)\n\nPursuant to the Employment Agreement between ChoiceOne and each of Mr. Potes and Mr. Burke (as applicable, the “Executive”), the Executive will receive severance benefits in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement) and a qualifying termination within six months before or three years after the change in control in the form of a lump-sum cash payment equal to three times the Executive's then-current base salary and monthly health care continuation payments for twelve months or until the commencement of new employment. The payments to each Executive under his Employment Agreement after a Change in Control are limited by Section 280G of the Code. The amount shown in the table for each Executive reflects this limitation."
