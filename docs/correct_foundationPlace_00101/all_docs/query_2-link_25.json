This opening keynote celebrates the unique potential of special libraries to spearhead AI-driven transformations. Join Brian Pichman as we saddle up to ride into the history of Artificial Intelligence, how its evolved over the years, and how its transforming today's frontiers. We will explore a variety of tools and strategies that leverage AI including some new ideas that may enhance cataloging, unlock personalized user experiences, or pioneer new ways to access specialized research. As with any frontier exploration, we will confront shared ethical challenges and explore how joint efforts can not only navigate but also shape AI's impact on equitable access and information integrity in special libraries. For the remainder of the conference, we will equip you with a \"digital compass\" where you can submit ideas and thoughts of what you've learned in sessions for a final reveal in the closing keynote.\n\nIt's your unstructured data: How to get your GenAI app to production (and spe...\n\nIt's your unstructured data: How to get your GenAI app to production (and spe...Zilliz\n\nSo you've successfully built a GenAI app POC for your company -- now comes the hard part: bringing it to production.
