        "text": "We’ve all met someone with intangible qualities that draw others in and make them say, “Wow!” Some call it charisma, magnetism, or the “It Factor,” but it’s nearly impossible to define. You can’t touch the It Factor, but you can immediately feel when someone has it. Why do some leaders have this seemingly magical presence, while too many of us come across as extraordinarily ordinary? Anthony Huey has spent the last 20 years as a communications coach answering this question by studying thousands of executives and the qualities that turn managers into inspirational leaders. He has discovered that most anyone can attain some level of the It Factor by understanding and changing how they are perceived while at the same time ratcheting up the willingness to influence and inspire those around them. This fast-paced and interactive keynote address provides practical and immediately implementable approaches to bringing the It Factor not just to you personally but to your organization.\n\nUber, Amazon, Alexa, Siri, AirBnB – these are just a few of the innovations that have given rise to entirely new paradigms in customer experience. Can government do the same? Absolutely! There’s no other choice. Sooner or later, it must be done. The good news is that it’s closer and more attainable than one might expect. This session looks at some innovative tools and strategies that will revamp and revitalize government’s relationship with its citizens.\n\nCan we ever be 100% digitally secure in this age of IoT, cloud, mobility, data-sharing, ransomware, hacktivism, et al.? The answer, of course, is no. But at the same time, failure is not an acceptable option for stewards of private information. What can we do to improve the odds? The first step is understanding what we’re up against. Much can be gleaned from debacles and near-misses in the public sector. This session takes a no-nonsense look at how, why and where governments are most vulnerable.\n\nIf blockchain is poised to make deep inroads into private industry, it stands to reason that government is next. And perhaps this is one area in which government might end up taking the lead. Potential uses include identity management, licensing, financial services, contract management, electronic voting and more. There is a lot to like, and it is a long way from mere hype. This session explores why blockchain could be particularly suited to government applications.\n\nThe rumors of the death of the data center have been greatly exaggerated. It turns out that the cloud isn’t the answer for everything. But obviously, neither is the traditional data center. One size doesn’t fit all. So what path should you choose? The answer: it depends. You’ll probably end up cherry-picking the best of both worlds to some extent, driven by a variety of factors. This session looks at today’s trends and where they are taking us.\n\nWe’ve all heard the saying “It’s not a technology problem, it’s a people problem.” More often than not, it’s true. Technology has reached the point where it can support just about anything that anyone wants to do, so real progress stems from everyone driving in the same direction. But politics has a way of undercutting the best of intentions. Like many states, Michigan is facing a change of administration. Quite a few local jurisdictions are in the same situation. Maintaining momentum and morale in such times of transition is one of the supreme tests of a leader. In this session, a panel of respected change agents discuss how to get things done despite disruption by being as “politics-proof” as possible.\n\nAt one time, analytics was the province of experienced veterans. Now, sports teams hire statisticians who know little about the actual sport. Political campaigns put their faith in number-crunchers who know nothing about politics. And artificial intelligence is increasingly rendering us moot in many ways. Does experience count for anything anymore? Surely it does, but our roles are evolving. This session explores the future of analytics and how we will most likely fit into the equation.\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a series of billions – someday trillions – of sensors and devices connected to one another via the Internet, and there are some powerful drivers, including 5G, that are accelerating the process considerably. IoT is really the domain of Operational Technology (OT), but what happens when OT runs rampant and IT is left struggling to secure it, control it, store it and make sense of it? This session discusses how to prepare for the inevitable shootouts soon to come.\n\nIn recent years privacy has tended to take a back seat to security. However, with the Facebook debacle, the release of GDPR (strict standards in Europe) and renewed concerns about compliance, privacy is again a hot topic. So why do we spend so much time and attention on security but not on privacy? What are the main elements of a privacy program? What should we be focusing on right now to avoid being front page news later? This session ponders one of the hottest issues of our times and what it means for public sector.\n\nThe Millennial generation outnumbers the Boomers, making it the largest generation in history – for a time. Now there’s an even larger wave, Generation Z, and it is starting to enter the workforce. Together these two generations comprise half the nation’s population, yet they represent an estimated 7% of the government workforce. Something is wrong with this picture! Not nearly enough effort has gone into understanding, reaching and embracing younger generations. This session highlights creative ideas and approaches for introducing new generations to the appeal of public service.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt’s “In the Arena” is one of the most stirring presidential quotes of all time, and it serves as the keynote theme for this year’s conference. Roosevelt was an American statesman, author, explorer, soldier, naturalist, and reformer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. Widely regarded as the most dynamic president in history, his life story is nothing short of remarkable. Born frail and sickly, Roosevelt transformed himself into a rugged man of adventure by sheer force of will. He was also a serious intellectual who frequently read a book a day and authored 35 books and 150,000 letters. He was arguably the best prepared president in American history. But few realize that he was also the first “high-tech” president as he brought the American people, sometimes kicking and screaming, into the twentieth century. Clay Jenkinson brings “Teddy” to life with such authenticity that viewers may forget that he is not actually standing in front of them. The audience will have the opportunity to ask Mr. Roosevelt questions on any subject, an experience that gives a new appreciation of history and a president who was truly larger than life. Prepare to be inspired!\n\nWhile the income gap is widening at an alarming rate, the nation’s digital access gap is a source of hope. Technology provides the means to level the playing field through a diverse range of services for government healthcare, job opportunities, personal connections and so much more. This session focuses on digital inclusion and engagement – where we stand today, where we need to be, and how to ramp up our progress by building the next generation of in-demand services.\n\nIdentity theft. Ransomware. Phishing. Spoofing. Fake hotspots. Social media stalking. Location tracking. The list goes on. How vulnerable are we? Well… more than many of us realize. Did you know that a criminal can use a photo of your key ring to make duplicates on a 3D printer? But this session isn’t about scare tactics, it’s about awareness. We have a choice: we can make ourselves easy targets or darned near invulnerable. In the end, nothing can be done to us without our cooperation!"
