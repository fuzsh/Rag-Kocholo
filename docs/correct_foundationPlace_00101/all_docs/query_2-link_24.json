Having worked in the SharePoint Practice since 2005, I was initially responsible migrating their hosting clients from 2007 to 2010 / 2013. With the announcement of 2013, very early on, dozens of the online / hosted clients wanted to participate in Early Adopter Programs EAPs allowing Sclera the opportunity to get extensive hand's-on experience with the new features paying especial attention to multi-tenancy, service application partitioning in tenancy, FAST Search Server for service provisions, the scalability of Services Farms and Hosting Farms, vs. how these were done in 2010.\n\nDeveloped the HI-Ltd.

ARL champions the transfer of advanced technologies and manufacturing processes, in partnership with industry and Navy research development centers, to acquisition programs and fleet operations, as well as the other government agencies and the private sector.\n\nARL has a lean but super-efficient support department MIS that drives leading technologies on the edge, in their efforts to perform the vast number of other duties performed by ARL resources.\n\nI was engaged to help ARL build out not just a SharePoint Farm, but provide extensive guidance and the delivery of a pre-defined list of objectives, as well as more objectives added to these once I was on board.\n\nPrimary scope was to provide expert guidance and governance around SharePoint 2013 Enterprise Server, multiple Farm Architecture, Information Architecture IA, and Security Matrix for IA, and detailed guidance on workshops to facilitate collating IA from over 120 departmental groups.\n\nOnce the above was underway, I was to scope the number of virtual machines VMware ESX that would be necessary for the SharePoint Farms. The Farms were comprised of the core enterprise Intranet Farm, with silo Farms that were not a direct extension off the Intranet unlike most departmental groups which were each an extension site collection off the Intranet, these Farms were silos due to content/sensitivity the Silo Farms had to support Intranet integration with various departments as well as support Extranet Vendor Authentication / Access.\n\nThe core Intranet was a set of 11 hosts, providing failover and meeting the requirements of only ALR no other departmental area of Penn State only ALR, and the silo Farms could be 4 to more hosts depending on the requirements. To facilitate a consistent build within the security parameters required, I developed a series of PowerShell cmdlets command-lets that scripted all of the Farm As Build necessary none of the PSCONFIG wizards were run everything was done via PowerShell, allowing the greatest granularity of control over database naming conventions, provisioning services, and fine tuning the initial Farm Builds per requirements collected. By changing some variables, the scripts could be executed changing the Intranet, or building out a whole new Farm altogether.\n\nI was responsible for working with their current staff and newly hired SharePoint staff on the brandling/look/feel for SP 2013 Publishing Site Definition Master/Layout pages.\n\nI was responsible for governance around Farm Architecture, Site Architecture, Custom Development Practices Allowed Tools / Out Of the Box OOB, Solution Deployment Practices/Governance, contractor / vendor Client Engagement Model Governance / Practices / Policies.\n\nFinally, in support of the Application Lifecycle Management efforts there, rather than go with a 3rd party vendor, like AvePoint, we elected to build out Team Foundation Services/Build/Library/Lab Manager, with complete integration with SharePoint for Team Project Collaboration / Management.\n\nExit duties included updating governance with changes to reflect newly discovered information that came from actual Farm Builds, and a more thorough understanding of governance around DoD / DSS policy on information spillage where classified information is placed in a non-classified site .\n\nconfidential\n\nEnterprise Architect, Senior SharePoint Architect for CC P\n\nBTS Business Technology Services the core IT Support Team for all of Consumers Energy and CMS Enterprises.\n\nConsumers Energy / CMS Enterprises is the largest single utility provider in the State of Michigan, providing much more than just electricity they're riding the forefront of technology, pushing the advance of Smart Meters and technology to help their customers not only save money, but to provide safer working environments / conditions for their personnel in the field.\n\nInitially, I was to work with other SharePoint Architect personnel that were driving the infrastructure builds, solutions architecture, and dozens of solutions custom developed for dozens of Business Partners BP's across the organization. Within a couple months I was promoted to the senior SharePoint Architect and my scope of work opened up to any/all things SharePoint.\n\nEnterprise Intranet Build Platform, Architecture, and Integration with SAP, Integration w/LOB Supply Chain, vendors, and customers .\n\nMy initial responsibilities included literally dozens of solutions to review / align so that the development / deployment followed prescribed practices for custom SharePoint solutions in 2010.\n\nI was responsible for the entire Farm Architecture reverse engineering and review to establish the current state of their build, and provide Governance, Policy, and Recommendations at the Executive Team level challenging the current environment and how we needed to approach the complete re-engineering and re-deployment of the 2010 Farm. In the end, we determined that we needed to just launch into SPS 2013 Enterprise Edition, and re-engineer not only the many custom solutions running on 2010 that had to be migrated also, how to deprecate the usage of 3rd party components like Newsgator in favor of SharePoint 2013 Community Site Definitions/Sites/Solutions We had dozens of these 'like' issues facing us when reviewing the SharePoint 2013 Farm Architecture/Build moving forward.\n\nconfidential\n\nEnterprise Architect, Senior SharePoint Architect for CC P\n\nApplication Lifecycle Management ALM Governance, Policy, Recommendations.\n\nHere I am responsible for not only providing the above guidance and recommendations, as well as Governance / Policy to allow the customer to manage this guidance, I invariably became involved in a half dozen custom solutions in which I had to take over the projects, design the solutions, and develop the custom solutions allowing me the opportunity to help the CMS Web Development Team get up to speed on developing SharePoint prescribed practices, solutions. This included extensive C .Net, InfoPath and Workflow Foundation development and integration with SAP multiple modules .\n\nHere I am working in an environment where all developers are used to being in the local Admins group of each web front end and application/search server, so they could real-time develop/deploy/test their solutions. While CE/CMS did have a DEVINT Developer / Integration testing environment, as well as QA Pre-Production environments in which additional testing should be performed. However, much of the practice there was to resolve an issue with code and just push it out.\n\nOnce onboard, I was instrumental in the documentation of code-deployment processes/policy, solution deployment governance and policy around this essentially, we implemented a firm line to follow to deploy SharePoint solutions. Most important, we did this with guidance that allowed developers the ideal means of 'packaging' their solutions for proper deployment.\n\nDuring this same time, I was also responsible for the final re-engineering and development of SharePoint solutions that needed to be deployed under brutal time-lines. / schedules. As mentioned above there was a lot of custom development that came along with the architecture role so I had my hands in all aspects of everything SharePoint at CMS.\n\nTo quantify brutal time-lines here is to simply state we worked 80 hour weeks re-engineering a great deal of custom code in most cases, cutting out a lot of bloat and commenting all of the code for documentation later on the solution. In the end, almost all solutions used the SP vs. the comparable ASP.NET classes they were using. To allow the solutions to work properly with Rights Management and Kerberos, this was a key necessity.\n\nTo support the various developers that would be working on one solution or another, we implemented a model where every developer got a virtual server, in this case 2008 R2 Enterprise, SharePoint Server 2010 or 2013 depending on the work being done, Visual Studio 2010 or 2012, depending on the requirements, and all was tightly glued into Team Foundation Services 2012 so all projects were properly created, and ALM Prescribed Practices were being documented to help the development team further adopt best for developing SharePoint solutions, and tracking use-cases, bugs/issues, fixes, test-cases, and full Application Lifecycle Management through to Code Deployment in the Production Farm.\n\nconfidential\n\nEnterprise Architect, Enterprise SharePoint Consultant for MCIT SharePoint 2007/2010/2013 Planning, Governance, Best Practice Guidance, Information Architecture, Enterprise Solutions Planning, Server Farm Architecture, UMHS Enterprise Solutions Architecture Operations/Administration/Governance Implementation\n\nThe University of Michigan Health System UMHS is the business unit of the U of M the hospitals, specialty clinics, and dozens of interdisciplinary support centers around the Ann Arbor, MI. area.\n\nThe UMHS has endeavored to implement SharePoint Server 2010 Enterprise Edition for the Medical Center's IT department MCIT, then for UMHS globally. Globally in this context is just UMHS Ann Arbor, and potentially other satellite locations where they do cooperative work with University Systems in Health Care like OSU Ohio State University and many others working on multiple R D and medical solutions for health customers primarily at U of M in Ann Arbor, MI.\n\nInitially, I was responsible with the review of the existing Server Farm Architecture. The MCIT Team contracted the build of the Farm to suite both MCIT and roughly 35K users of UMHS. My duties included the review of this Farm Architecture, documenting my findings, and providing recommendations that would\n\nAllow UMHS to expand the Farm to meet the requirements of 30-45,000 users\n\nAllow UMHS to partition the Service Applications as a unique Farm, ensuring the Farm requirements could scale and meet the business requirements and scale to the number of business processes identified after some initial requirements phase, we are calling Phase I Deployment.\n\nExpand the Farm with not only six 6 additional Service Application hosts, but two 2 additional Web Front End hosts.\n\nExpand the Farm with not only the above mentioned extensions, but two 2 additional Search Server application hosts.\n\nThe above initial changes would take the UMHS Intranet to the Production Farm Architecture requirements that allowed the University Health System businesses to leverage SharePoint as a core Intranet solution, leveraging extensive document management, custom lists, calendars, forms, workflow, and general Information Management meeting their Information Architecture IA requirements as a Phase I delivery.\n\nPhase I would cover a suitable IA/Taxonomy that would allow the roughly three 3 dozen inter-departmental units of MCIT, and long-term, the roughly 310 interdisciplinary units of the UMHS to leverage SharePoint in a holistic manner that 1 provided each department/discipline a means of leveraging SharePoint to manage non-patient, as well as patient PHI information from a centralized Information Management Intranet or, SharePoint.\n\nIn review of Phase I we quickly ascertained that potentially three 3 additional phases would be necessary to bring UMHS fully up to speed on working SharePoint in a fashion that leveraged the MiChart an extension of the EPIC or Epicore software foundation/framework solution integrating SharePoint globally with MiChart in each department area/inter-disciplinary area.\n\nUMHS is a prime example of a large University and Health Systems customer that is challenged with the private information of patients in healthcare Electronic Health Record, or EHR no longer electronic medical record, or EMR data, coupled with the day-in-a-life, and just day-to-day operations information management around these PHI data, without compromising the 1 sensitivity of the PHI data, and 2 with the provision of advanced data collaboration, information collaboration, document management, information management, and base-line business process flow management in a single, holistic framework SharePoint Server 2010/2013. It is critical to note that, at no time does any of the PHI data become exposed or potentially compromised as exposed, by virtue of surfacing in a SharePoint solution.\n\nconfidential\n\nSharePoint Consultant for DoITT SharePoint 2010 Enterprise Farm Architecture, SharePoint 2010 Solutions Service Offerings, Best Practice Guidance for 2010, Solution Architecture, Enterprise Architecture, Governance.\n\nMy final duties included all Governance documentation the Design and Deployment of the final SharePoint 2010 Server Farms/Architecture, the successful migration of several hundred disparate SharePoint sites into the new SharePoint 2010 farm. Ensure the new SharePoint Farm supported Multi-Tenancy as well as traditional SharePoint Server Farm architecture allowing both types of site deployment, providing the City the ability to offer Agencies Service Offerings specifically, three 3 levels of Service from which an Agency could select, and their SharePoint Service Offering would be provisioned, much like any SharePoint hosting service may be provisioned for clients shopping for SharePoint hosting and finding it on the Internet. From a Silver Service Offering nothing more than SharePoint Server 2010 with basic features out of the box, focused on just the SharePoint Foundation features, to a Platinum Service Offering, a highly custom SharePoint Server 2010 solution, featuring any/all client requirements and customizations, as well as Office Web Applications 2010 integration, and much more it would all be driven on the customizations as specified by the Agency.\n\nThis engagement involves extensive Agency executive management interaction and the scoping of potential solutions for the Agency. DoITT, with Executive Order 140 from the Mayor's Office, is moving into the position to screen all SharePoint solutions and determine using common delivery models like those proposed by Sclera a Discovery/Planning, an Envisioning Phase, and finally, a summary of Findings / Solution Roadmap of solution deliver options DoITT is basically taking control and driving through a Client Engagement Model all things SharePoint from all mayoral agencies.. These meetings with the Agency/client, and working through the delivery of these documents, provides DoITT and the Agency/Client a clear insight into the total work effort to provide them a sound SharePoint 2010 solution. We may determine that a System Integrator needs to be engaged to facilitate the delivery of the solution for the client. Conversely, we may find that the DoITT SharePoint Subject Matter Experts, Solution Architects and Enterprise Architect, can scope the design/delivery of the solution, providing a significant Cost Avoidance for DoITT / Agency, and delivering a sound solution in SharePoint 2010.\n\nconfidential\n\nSharePoint Consultant\n\nReviewing the City's actual SharePoint ad-hoc, or rogue applications, I found hundreds of sites spread between SharePoint Portal Server 2003 CityPoint and Windows SharePoint Services CityPointWSS and SharePoint Server 2007 MOSS DoITT Internal staff only . My responsibilities included the effective migration planning, testing, analyses, and then the final migration of all of these SharePoint sites into SharePoint 2010.\n\nAfter careful review and testing of the migration options available to us, I worked with another of our contractors to develop a migration plan. The plan included the Server Architecture for the existing DoITT domain, and the new City CS domain replacing CSC the CityPoint Service Center domain the domain every Agency shares for common access to SharePoint Services v3 sites from the City, to be deployed in SharePoint 2010 Multi-tenancy Server Architecture. This allowed for Agencies to subscribe as a tenant and relieved DoITT from the administrative tasks of supporting site creation and management of Agency sites because the Agency Administrator is a Tenant Administrator and could work with any/all departments in the Agency on the deployment and management of 1 to n site collections.\n\nThe roll out of these new Server Farms included Staging and Production Farms something both DoITT and CSC had been lacking previously. The new Farm is a consolidated effort called City Serve, allowing the consolidation of the DoITT SharePoint and CSC SharePoint Farms into a common CS SharePoint Farm.\n\nFurther, to support and to conform to the City's security requirements, we implemented Unified Access Gateway UAG 2010 and ForeFront Threat Management Gateway TMG 2010 both new products that replaced the older ISA Server 2006 and IAG 2007. Using UAG/TMG we were able to provide a common authentication experience, issuing Claims for the SharePoint access, while pulling and actually authenticating against either Active Directory or Novell's eDirectory LDAP store. City Staff/Employees, roughly 114,000 employees/contractors, were Active Directory all others in the City were in eDirectory LDAP some 4.5 million civilian users and growing.\n\nThe final migrated sites live in the CS domain space, and attempt to bridge the divide of multiple Agency domains, disparate authentication models, bringing all of the migrated sites together in a domain that all domains can join a trust with, or using AD FS/UAG 2010/TMG 2010, we provide a bridge that allows a single sign-on to persist to the new CS Farm.\n\nconfidential\n\nSharePoint Consultant\n\nConfidential like many municipalities, has dozens of agencies, and tens of thousands of employees, all of which want to use, or area using to some degree SharePoint. Further, there are those agencies that contract a System Integrator in the City to build complete Enterprise Content Management solutions using MOSS 2007, and these solutions DoITT is responsible for the hosting and support of the solution.\n\nMy initial focus was on documentation and policy/procedure for the City. I was responsible for Governance on all aspects of SharePoint from Discovery, Requirements Gathering, Solution Development, Delivery and Support every facet there is governance develop to speak to each phase/facet.\n\nIn tandem with these responsibilities I am responsible for review and often may work with the System Integrator on, the development / delivery of specific MOSS 2007 engagements being delivered for any given Agency. It is important to note: No NYC Agency had actually fully adopted or had a SharePoint Server 2007 MOSS solution developed. So this effort for the City interaction with Agencies having a System Integrator SI develop a MOSS solution that the City was going to have to host and support, was fairly new.\n\nWorking closely with SI's I worked on behalf of DoITT the City to ensure that best practices for MOSS solutions were being followed often this involved actual development work and design/review sessions with a SI on behalf of the Agency, all in an effort to ensure the solution was being developed properly and would deliver as a viable best of breed, MOSS solution.\n\nTo provide the City on-going support in any capacity requested, on all things SharePoint: specifically, I remain available to the City to review and potentially work overseeing the development of SharePoint Server solutions moving forward by any given Agency, including custom work done by DoITT.\n\nTechnologies included: SharePoint Portal Server 2003, WSSv3, SharePoint Server 2007 MOSS, SharePoint Server 2010 Foundation and Enterprise Editions, UAG 2010, TMG 2010, ForeFront Identity Manager, ADFS v2, ASP.Net 2.x, .Net 4.x, MSFT Enterprise Library 4.x Enterprise Architect UML/Design/Modeling .\n\nconfidential\n\nAmway is a large organization with multiple internal IT silos that work on various solutions, projects, issues for the corporation.\n\nOver the past couple years the corporation has begun discovery, requirements gathering and the design of a global internal and web presence. Global Web 2.0.\n\nThis effort involves multiple areas of IT and multiple solutions that will make up the sum of the global effort. My involvement was initially to speak to all sub-systems on Commerce Server 2007 and 2009 initially code-named Mojave . I was contracted as a subject matter expert on all sub-systems Profile, Orders, Marketing, BI, and worked closely with the internal .Net development architects that had already largely developed a global framework in C .Net around various technologies, including Microsoft's Enterprise Library, Spring.Net and core/data services for Spring, Rhino Mocks mock object framework for .Net, SharePoint 2007 and other 3rd party component software.\n\nI worked initially on the Profiles system, working closely with the component/services code developers of the original Global Web 2.0 Framework. This was not trivial in that the existing North American system that Global Web 2.0 was going to model for all things commerce was the existing public facing site, and business center suite for existing Independent Business Owners IBO's . When I joined the team the existing database structure had been analyzed, changed to meet new requirements, and then placed into the Commerce Server profiles database setup.\n\nI had the task of identifying what data should remain in the profile system, what data may actually be abstract content that would eventually be managed in MOSS, and what data should be placed in SQL Server outside of the Profiles system simply because it did not need to be in the Profiles system.\n\nWe were also working closely with Cactus Commerce and Microsoft with Mojave now Commerce Server 2009. The objective was to incorporate the Mojave API into the Global Web 2.0 Framework and utilize it for all base-line calls to Commerce Server. There were a number of areas, due to the complexity of the database and multiple relationships of various data that the traditional CS API and the newer Mojave API which was not much of an improvement over the traditional API where we had to query / retrieve collections of data based on multiple joins.\n\nconfidential\n\nAmway/Alticor had engaged a few different contracts in an effort to re-write/migrate a classic ASP application that had been running since 1999. This application provided global users a view into various aspects of their income level with the company. These individuals are Independent Business Operators/Owners or IBO's.\n\nAfter a couple failed attempts to migrate the application, the client contacted Microsoft Consulting Services and eventually I was consulted to review the application for a complete re-engineering.\n\nThis application had evolved a great deal over the years and it was very difficult to do a quick discovery/analyses in a couple weeks' time. So we took the Agile approach to discovery, analyses, requirements documentation, re-engineer the application, and deliver on that re-engineering in Agile iterations. Within 3 iterations and 4 months I was able to produce a .Net 2.0 based ASP.Net solution that followed the best practices/pattern for an abstracted data provider factory and all of the new UI was done in .Net 2.0 Master / Layout pages.\n\nDuring the re-engineering of this application we discovered that we could deprecate 2 additional classic ASP applications Content Publishing a light weight application that provided some dynamic content to GBISLINK.COM and Affiliate Maintenance another classic ASP application that provided relatively static content to GBISLINK.COM on members IBO's and base-line procedures, guidelines, and content that spoke to becoming an IBO, etc.\n\nThe tools used were C .Net, SQL Server 2005, SSIS 2005, NS 2005, ASP.Net.\n\nconfidential\n\nEnterprise Architect\n\nArchitect In this capacity I am responsible for the design and architecture of solution based systems, the mentoring of various developers across the NuSoft Solutions practices, technical pre-sales, business analysis, as well as software and solution development in order to stay technically sharp. Also, as a senior architect, I am responsible for the ownership of projects and solutions provided by the teams that I work with / coordinate.\n\nconfidential\n\nMy role was the solution architect that worked w/two MCS architects and reviewed / finalized the over-all solution architecture.\n\nWorking with a close-nit team, we were responsible for the discovery, requirements gathering, use-case modeling, and final requirements documentation. Further, my role included the infrastructure design / implementation that facilitated the local development environments for the team, a build/host environment for Team Foundation Server to script and build the solutions as we checked in source a staging environment / test environment where user-acceptance testing would occur. Finally, the Stage Server points that would take the final solutions and stage the database, profiles, and code into the production environment.\n\nGrocery Express is initially being tested at one location the front end system allows the customer to add groceries to an active cart, save UPC/grocery items to saved lists of desired continued merchandise that can be selected and added to a cart on a scheduled/desired basis the user could checkout and select a time frame they wished to pick up the order.\n\nThis solution integrated w/existing web services and POS point of sale systems in place at Meijer and provided a seamless shopping experience for the user. Once an order was finalized by the customer, the administration backend provided management at the store a schedule of what needed to be picked and filled for the order.\n\nThe system had to provide the flexibility for the customer to sign in and change a given order with a window of up to 3 hours prior to their desired pickup time the system provided interactive/real-time integration with Commerce Server during the time selectors were filling the order at the store. Finally, once the customer picked up the order, order finalization was synchronized within Commerce Server.\n\nTechnologies included Windows 2003 Server x64 R2, Commerce Server 2007 Enterprise, .Net 3.5 custom development.

COJ is one of the largest municipalities and probably the only one where the city is also the county limits Duval Co. Florida is also the City Limits for Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nCOJ has a few dozen disparate systems that are invariably used to collect payment information and summarize these data into cash-receipts for one line of business or another. For example, Parks and Recreation may collect payments pertinent to camping permits or even traffic citations issues on State Park lands Other divisions, like power and light collect payment information and actual payments using a proprietary system that allows customers to make payments on their utility bills. Finally, there are a host of other systems from State Tax Assessors office, to General District Court traffic fines / fees. Invariably, COJ desires to develop an open architected solution that would envelop all of these pre-existing systems providing a consolidated cash receipts repository and a one-stop reporting point that would provide aggregate reports on all persons that live in and transact in the city where the transactions are city government related.\n\nMSFT with the client on a POC proof of concept to demonstrate how Commerce Server 2007 and BizTalk Server 2006 could be used to meet the needs of this engagement.

All web parts were developed independent of one another so one web part could surface information pertinent to that web part without relying on other web parts or custom interfaces. Finally, many web parts employed using extensive custom user controls C .Net that would be surfaced in a web part zone but all style applied via standard CSS in the Style-Library within MOSS. None of this solution relied on any file system artifacts all of the solution was delivered in MOSS.\n\nconfidential\n\nand upgrade to MOSS RTM. Further, we were challenged to take 2 additional demos developed for State and Local Government and for Federal Government and apply the RTM upgrade to these demos.\n\nWe build the Edu demos so the upgrade for these was not as time consuming as upgrading the government demos. The government demos incorporate a great deal of custom workflow, integration with Groove and Groove Workspaces, BSM Business Score Card Manager workspaces, Excel Services, and MapPoint API for interactive Maps.\n\nTechnologies included MOSS RTM Enterprise, Business Data Catalog BDC and custom data providers, custom web parts in .Net 2.x, surfaced in MOSS site collections Integration with the Groove SDK/API and custom workspaces Integration with MapPoint 2006 API and object model OM to provide interactive mapping that could kick off custom workflows based on specific map information entered and alert notifications identified in turn the Groove workflow would kick off additional MOSS workflow to notify appropriate personnel of varying degrees of alerts and proposed paths / solutions to address the threat alerts generated by the application solution.\n\nconfidential\n\nengagement is for the School of Nursing.\n\nMSCSET wanted to deploy a solution that leveraged MOSS 2007's content management and publishing features. They also wanted a mobility solution that allows faculty/staff specific interaction with student records.\n\nStudents at SET enroll in a Program Pathway that has associated Abilities and Competencies, as well as special / custom clinical associations of things they must accomplish. Each student also has a pre-defined set of pre-requisites that must be met at varying points in their academic career.\n\nThe faculty /staff desired the ability to work from either a desktop or a PDA in the field. The requirements for this engagement specified XP Pro / SP2 or Vista for the desktop OS, and Windows Mobility 5.0 for the PDA appliance.\n\nThis solution architecture used extensive custom site columns and content types in MOSS. Further, the BDC business data catalog was used to integrate with their existing LOB line of business student information / nursing systems. The client did not want to do away with existing systems, or introduce new custom code for this engagement so we architected BDC applications that provided the data we needed within SharePoint to effectively provision a student enrollment allowing us the ability to take an enrollment and create the student record and every single associated attribute / ability / competency / clinical / pre-requisite that could be associated with that student's Program Pathway.\n\nThis approach allowed us to heavily leverage out of the box OOB custom views in SharePoint and to define mobile views satisfying the requirement to allow faculty / staff to interact with the system using either their desktop or mobile appliance. Also, the Business Data Catalog BDC out of the box web parts were leveraged heavily to provide one-way pulls of data from their back end existing systems. This was the final aspect of the solution that allowed faculty / teachers to interact with a students Program Profile from varying perspectives depending on their roles and jobs.\n\nTechnologies used MOSS 2007, BDC integration with SQL Server, Oracle, and Informix ASP.Net, C .Net custom web parts, custom content types and content type architecture deployed in MOSS, Active Directory, .Net Framework 2.0\n\nconfidential\n\nconcept POC that demonstrated the new content management features of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server MOSS 2007, custom workflow, custom InfoPath forms, and custom web parts.\n\nWe selected the IT department and the HR department to provide demonstrable ECM enterprise content management aspects of MOSS.\n\nThe requirements for the initial POC evolved into a fully-functional model that BYUI was able to build on and expand.\n\nFor HR human resources we used some of the existing site taxonomy and incorporated a more aggressive demonstration of how to manage Policies and Procedures. Specifically, we used site-content types, custom, and defined the various tiers of P Ps that are applicable to BYUI HR, Employees, Students, etc. . We provided the publishing / maintenance taxonomy, submission business logic, and custom workflow to properly route and ultimate gain approval for edits to P P.s\n\nFor IT information technology we did a similar approach: borrow from some of the existing site taxonomy and then we introduced custom InfoPath forms that are linked to custom workflow that allow, for example, for a student to submit an IT request for one purpose or another: the form is submitted, the proper workflow instantiated, and the tracking of the form and procedures associated with approval/change-request/denial of the form all being accounted for in the custom workflow.\n\nBYUI also incorporated 2 custom master pages and 3 custom layout pages that demonstrated the UI they recently had designed as a common brand for their new portal.
