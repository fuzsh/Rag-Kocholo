The next-generation platform for distributed systems A pillar of the Microsoft.NET Framework 3.0 Build WCF services in Visual Studio 2005 using any .NET Language Intelligent code editing, IDE Extensions for WCF, debugging, re-factoring, code snippets, etc. Runs on Microsoft Windows Vista Microsoft Windows XP Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Codename “Indigo”\n\n4. Unification of Technologies Abstraction of service code from the transport layer Interoperability WS-* specification support Service-Oriented Development Loose Coupling Developer efficiency Configuration file based Attribute based\n\n5. .asmx web services are still there Only Http\n\n6. Client Service Message Endpoint Endpoint Endpoint\n\n7. Client Service Message Address Binding Contract (Where) (How) (What) A B C A B C A B C\n\n8. Three levels of abstraction expressed in WSDL Address – Location of the service Uri Can be dynamic Binding – How to talk to the service Programmatic or config file based Contract – What the service does Interface based\n\n9. Consists of: Protocol Server Name Port Path Logical address does not have map to a physical file, except in IIS\n\n10. A collection of operations that specifies what the Endpoint communicates to the outside world Identified by Name and Namespace Duplex Contracts Server can call client WSDualHttpBinding Data and Service components\n\n11. Specification of how the client and server will communicate Multiple endpoints possible for a service Predefined Bindings Configuration file based Custom Bindings\n\n12. BasicHttpBinding WSHttpBinding WSDualHttpBinding WSFederationBinding NetTCPBinding NetPeerTCPBinding NetNamedPipeBinding NetMsmqBinding MsmqIntegrationBinding\n\n13. Create the contract Interfaces and implementations Data Contracts Service Contracts Host the service Configure bindings Create a client\n\n15. SOAP Faults CLR Exceptions converted to FaultException Strongly-typed FaultException Part of Contract Unexpected Messages UnknownMessageReceived event Attacks/Probes Out-of-date proxy\n\n17. Transport Level Security Message Level Security Authentication and Authorization\n\n18. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) More efficient More configuration Interoperable with ASP.Net Web Services\n\n19. Certificates X.509 SOAP Message Security\n\n20. Enterprise Active Directory Windows Authentication Windows Token Role Provider Basic Authentication Impersonation Internet SqlMembershipProvider SqlRoleProvider Windows Cardspace Authorization via Attributes [PrincipalPermission(SecurityAction.Demand, Role=&quot;WarehouseStaff&quot;)] public List<string> ListProducts() {…}\n\n21. WS-ReliableMessaging Specification No duplication Resend lost messages Sequencing Buffers and re-orders received messages Replay Detection Nonces\n\n22.
