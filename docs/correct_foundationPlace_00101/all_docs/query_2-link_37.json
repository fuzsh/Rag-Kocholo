A 9.2-acre property where our children and grandchildren will grow in knowledge and faith, where our uncles and aunties will share their wisdom, and where every member of our community can find support, education, and spiritual connection. Together, we are cultivating a future where every individual can learn, grow, and connect in ways we have always dreamed of.\n\nHow You Can Help\n\nGive: Every contribution brings us closer to Building our Legacy.\n\nSpread the Word: Invite friends & family to become Architects of Our Future.\n\nDream & Share: Visit to see the potential and share your vision for our Community's Future.\n\nOn the authority of Abu Hurairah (ra) that the Messenger of Allah (saw) said, ‘When a person dies, his deeds come to an end except for three: Sadaqah Jariyah (a continuous charity), or knowledge from which benefit is gained, or a righteous child who prays for him’. (Muslim)\n\nOur sadaqa jaariyah will lay the foundation for a legacy that will resonate through generations, offering a space for learning, worship, and community engagement that reflects our shared values and aspirations."
