        "text": "Nov. 27, 2008\n\nPuréed PumpkinHeads\n\nAs apprehensive I was before the game against the Dazed & Blue Horde from Annie’s TreeHouse, I was downright fearful as the ‘Cats were poised to meet the Ill-Annoy, especially regarding their offense. Bottom line was: the Ill-Whine-I offense fielded the No. 1 yardage production offense in the Big 10/11 conference, better than that of the BCS-bound Inmates of State Penn or da BCS-wannabe Bucknuts, and one having a passing attack that was ranked among the best in Division 1A. And to top it all off, the Ill-Whine-I featured an offensive weapon that had spelled doom to the ‘Cats’ D since the beginning of the new millennium: a fleet-footed, mobile and agile QB with a very strong arm.\n\nConference and national media alike were singing the praises of Ill-Annoy’s athletic media darling QB, Juice Williams, even more than they had done with da BuckNut’s wunderkind QB, Terrell Pryor, who had torched the ‘Cats as much with his passing prowess as he had with his running abilities just 2 weekends previously. What would this monstrously versatile QB do when he faced NU’s vulnerable secondary? I shuddered at the thought.\n\nAnd not only did Ill-Annoy’s potent offensive weapons pose an intimidating competitive challenge, the motivational factor for the PumpkinHeads loomed large as well. After having scratched and clawed their way valiantly to a very commendable share of the Big 10/11 conference championship in 2007, the Ill-Whine-I had underachieved much of their 2008 season, literally “mailing-in” whole games with piss-poor field play, and consequently stood on the brink of bowl eligibility at a 5-6 record. Amazingly, Zook’s Crooks couldn’t get that 6th “W” last weekend from playing Western Michigan, a team hailing from the “supposedly weak” MAC, in their 11th game of 2008 – a late-campaign week when most other high quality, healthy football programs would have been playing their most effective and consistent ball of the season. But that’s another story for another time. Suffice it to say that the self-absorbed and dysfunctional PumpkinHeads’ viewed the “lowly MildCats” as their best last-chance opportunity to gain that final 6th win and progress beyond all their well-chronicled internal squabbling and inter-personnel strife.\n\nHow the ‘Cats Smashed the PumpkinHeads\n\nFreshly Squeezed\n\nDoc Hankwitz had his defense primed and loaded for bear last Saturday, and this focused, aggressive squad simply dogged and abused Juice Williams and every other Ill-Whine-I ball carrier for that matter with a purposeful vengeance. The many various flavors of Doc’s 4-3-4 and 4-2-5/Roverback defensive sets worked to near perfection. Bar none, this was the most effective overall exhibition by the ‘Cat D of the entire 2008 campaign, and truly, one that reflected the total lockdown defenses of the Fitz-powered ’95 and ’96 seasons.\n\n‘Cat DE Corey Wootton played like a man possessed as he continually crashed hard from his defensive corner and compressed the Ill-Annoy backfield straight into the face of the Juice. Kevin Mims did the same from his opposite DE position, and between them both, they squeezed the bewildered and panicky Juice every time he dropped behind his evaporating pocket protection for 3 total sacks and many more hurries. NU’s interior DL personnel went berserk as well, especially John Gill, stuffing their blockers at the LOS, gaining separation and penetrating gaps to harass and completely disrupt the flow of the Ill-Annoy ground game.\n\nThen there were the ‘Cat LBs. What could I write that would do their collective performance justice? Not much, to be quite frank. Their field play was superb across all positions. The LB tandem of Prince Kwateng and Nate Williams played their best individual games of the year and were in the shorts of every Ill-Whine-I ball carrier all afternoon, accounting for 11 and 10 tackles respectively. OLB Quentin Davie made himself an irritating burr in the behind of the Juice on a regular basis, especially in support of the off-tackle rush.\n\nAnd then there was the nearly flawless run support of Brad Phillips, playing the cross-position role of Roverback, where he would creep-up from his original SS position close to the LOS just shading the outside shoulder of the DE and act as a 3rd or even 4th LB in Doc’s defensive front. From there, Phillips either would shoot an inside gap within the OL, usually on a zone blitz, or crash the Ill-Annoy backfield from the defensive edge in a tandem pass rush stunt with the DE to that side. Much of the Ill-Whine-I’s rushing attempts executed the QB-RB option, behind varied blocking schemes, to gain NU’s defensive corners at the LOS. When this flow showed to his side, Phillips and his fellow safeties sprinted quickly to the LOS in run support, attacked the ball carrier with abandon and stoned these attempts for little or no gain. The rush support techniques of the ‘Cat DBs was so effective and efficient, it almost appeared as if they had been part of the Ill-Annoy offensive huddle and had known exactly what run Juice and Co. planned to run.\n\nKudos to Doc Hankwitz and Jerry Brown on their defensive game plan strategies and schooling their players to identify, recognize and react to their reads correctly. Those strategies and their associated tactical reads positioned everyone on NU’s defensive side of the scrimmage line to become a playmaker. Ill-Annoy’s potent ground game was thoroughly thwarted in H-1, limiting this attack to a miniscule 15 yards on 14 rushing attempts. It was a major contributor to the ‘Cats’ total field play domination in the opening half and completely demoralized the Ill-Whine-I the coaching staff and players.\n\nFrom the \"Yaarchives\":\n\n\"Yaarh, I be losing again, Mateys!\"\n\nSecondary’s Best\n\nWith the Ill-Whine-I rushing attack ground to a relative halt by NU’s defensive front 7 and Mr. Phillips, Ill-Annoy HC Ron Zook and his OC were forced to turn their yardage production over to their aerial attack and its pass-happy QB, Juice Williams. Not such a bad switch either considering that Juice had recorded games where he had amassed passing yards in the 400’s several times this season. But Zook and the Juice never envisioned the pressure-packed pasting that the ‘Cat defensive front 7 would lay on their passing attack coupled with the blanket coverage provided by the ‘Cat secondary.\n\nEvery time Juice dropped back behind his umbrella protection, his attention was redirected from scanning the ‘Cat secondary to looking over his shoulder at the unrelenting, unstoppable pass rush. After the first of five sacks was delivered, Juice seemed more preoccupied in avoiding NU’s pass rush than in finding an open receiver; and when he did, it became a crap shoot regarding whether or not he could deliver the bean accurately to that target. And the main beneficiaries of that forceful pass rush were NU’s DBs. They were able to break on the throw and close on the target that slight fraction of a moment sooner, because Juice was telegraphing his intent. Since his throws were off - sometimes just a little, other times quite a lot – the DBs could cheat ever so slightly in their coverage techniques. All of this contributed greatly in limiting Juice to passing yardage statistics that were well under his average.\n\nWhen one considers that the Ill-Annoy passing game was ranked in the top 20 of Division 1A and the way that the ‘Cat DBs kept the Ill-Whine-I receiving corps under wraps for whole periods of the game, it was their best performance of the season.\n\nMcCall’s Best\n\nI’ve not been a fan of NU OC Mick McCall throughout much of NU’s 2008 campaign, especially his game plan strategies and game-time play calling. Admittedly, he’s had a daunting coaching challenge when dealing with the myriad injuries to his most valuable offensive playmakers. However, even when he has had the services of starting QB C.J Bacher, 1st team RB Tyrell Sutton, 2nd team RB Omar Conteh and many others, McCall has not had near the success that one might have expected when deploying his offensive attack schemes via these experienced veterans. My greatest criticism is his insistence on employing a controlled “managed” passing attack on a continual basis, because, when facing a better, more experienced defensive secondary, its inherent advantages can be turned against the offense running it. And in previous games it has, most notably against da BuckNuts and H-1 against the Dazed & Blue Horde, where the CBs fronted NU’s WRs and played bump-&-run while the safeties were set 8 yards off the LOS in run support-first mode that allowed their overall quickness and hair-trigger reactions to neutralize Bacher’s short-route passes.\n\nHowever, McCall, and perhaps even Fitz, might have had an epiphany of sorts at halftime against the Big Bad Blue Boys in the Big House. Coming out of the locker room in H-2 down by 7 and after having had his ‘managed” passing schemes literally managed into an offensive non-factor, McCall directed Bacher and his receiving crops to challenge the shallow & wide zone coverages of the Michigan DBs by employing the vertical pass - and to great effect. Two downfield passes to WRs running skinny post routes into the Dazed & Blue deep middle 3rd zone on NU’s first 2 possessions in H-2 produced a TD score apiece, and gave the ‘Cats a 7 point lead that stood-up for the remainder of the game.\n\nWith a viable, productive passing paradigm now identified and in place, McCall called upon his healthy, rejuvenated QB and WRs once again against the Ill-Whine-I. In NU’s 1st possession of the game, McCall called a RB rush on 4 consecutive 1st downs, all stopped for small gains by an Ill-Annoy front 7 that was supported heavily by a secondary positioned in run support first mode, just like daOSU and Michigan had done. Obviously Ill-Annoy’s defensive brain trust took a hint from those game films and crafted a similarly-based defensive game plan. However, the trap was set for an effective reversal in down-distance play calling. On the ‘Cats’ 2nd drive, McCall shuns the run and calls for the pass on 4 consecutive 1st downs, and on 6 of the first 8 plays of the possession, most thrown downfield, gaining good yardage while forcing the Ill-Whine-I DBs to abandon their run support-first sets and re-position themselves back-up to normal pass coverage depths. On 1st down number 5 at the Ill-Annoy 19, C.J. executes another reversal by handing-off to Simmons for a lightning-quick 9-yard burst. By pressing a pass-first tendency, the rush now became wide open simply because the Ill-Whine-I DBs couldn’t play up at the LOS and back in pass coverage at the same time. McCall takes advantage, calling 4 more consecutive rushes, and NU gets the go-ahead TD.\n\nThe true balanced offensive attack is back, and McCall didn’t have to be convinced any further of its efficacy. On NU’s next possession, McCall utilized an efficient mix of run-vertical pass-run-vertical pass and directed his O on a drive that gobbled-up 50 yards in 3 minutes for a 2nd TD and extended NU’s lead to 13, one that would hold for the rest of H-1.\n\nFor the remainder of the game, McCall kept to his new-found balanced attack and the Ill-Annoy D never could regroup and counter with any type of consistency. It was his best play calling of the entire 2008 season.\n\n2 Daggers\n\nThe 2 most important dagger plays of the game were both prelude and finish of the same possession. The first dagger thrust into the still beating heart of the PumpkinHeads was the brilliant 51-yard punt return by Brendan Smith in Q4 that gave the ‘Cats a starting position on the Ill-Annoy 20. With their backs in the shadow of their endzone, the Ill-Annoy defense was absolutely deflated and unresponsive. The second dagger was applied 2 plays later when C.J. found his favorite WR, Eric Peterman, running a deep outside curl route, open by a full 2 steps at the Ill-Annoy goal line and completed a sweet pitch-and-catch delivery for the game-clinching TD. It was the kill shot of the game which rendered the Ill-Whine-I unquestionably dead at the scene facing a 17 point deficit. Essentially, it was game over from that point on.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ease at which the Wildcats dispatched their in-state rivals was truly remarkable and underscored the progressive maturation process of the 2008 football team. The ‘Cats totally eviscerated an Ill-Annoy team that had been prematurely anointed for a January 1 bowl bid by many media pundits with a cool confidence that was unfathomable in the preseason. At the start of this season, I had my doubts whether the ‘Cats could or would fulfill their goals to not only win all 4 of their out-of-conference games but to make definitive field play statements in their Big 10/11 games against several conference championship contenders, like the Golden Rodents, and the Hog-Eyes. I had high hopes, but I still needed to see it before I’d ever believe it. Now I must say that seeing is believing. I and many other members within the Wildcat Nation family have been privileged to witness this outstanding transformation. Right now, the Northwestern Wildcats, under the mentorship of Fitz, Doc, McCall and the other position coaches, are a very good team and most certainly deserve their national ranking within Division 1A’s top teams.\n\nC.J. voiced it best in a post-game interview when he declared, “9 and 3 sounds pretty good to me.”\n\nAnd to me as well.\n\nThe Waterboy\n\nEXTRA: The Pumpkin Smash, Redux!\n\nThe highlight of the Illinois pregame tailgate was the Waterboy's reviving of his Smashing Pumpkin ritual in the West Lot.

You know, typical Midwestern November football weather. And many post-game reports from the Big House confirmed that the weather conditions were some of the worst that fans have ever endured when attending a football game. Then there were the teams.\n\nFirst was Michigan, a team that is in the midst of the ugliest, most traumatic coaching transition I’ve ever seen for a major collegiate football program, where a once proud conference contender is struggling as much to find the endzone as it is trying to find its own offensive identity. Simply stated, the Dazed & Blue Horde from Annie’s Treehouse is a bad team. More correctly, it is a very bad team; and about as inconsistent as could possibly be imagined. All those 4 & 5 star recruits, whom richly-bought HC Rich Rod had inherited from his perennially successful predecessor, looked totally confused and inept against even marginally competitive opponents, like Toledo at home in game #6, and then a few weeks later, got their general field play act together temporarily and blow away a reputable conference contender, like Golden Rodents on the road in the Humpty Dome. And that isn’t even half of the problem. One week, the offense falls flat on its face and can’t buy a single 1st down for love or money; then the following week, its defense, executing a game plan reminiscent of what was employed by former NU DC, Greg “Behold the Power of Swiss Cheese” Colby, gets run-over and left as road kill by a journeyman offense for 40-plus points. The deficiencies of the Dazed & Blue Horde are everywhere, the responsibility for which, in the final analysis, falls squarely on the heads of the newly-installed coaching staff.\n\nMeanwhile, the ‘Cats were in the throes of their own ugly malaise, after getting bit exceedingly hard by the injury bug in the worst way. NU entered the Big House minus their most prolific playmakers on either side of the LOS - their star RB and the capable No. 2 RB, their starting MLB, a highly regarded pass rush expert DE - and a host of other players who had been on track to receive substantive PT throughout the 2008 season. The single shining light in this otherwise dim PUP picture was the highly anticipated return of starting QB C.J. Bacher after a 2 game hiatus spent recovering from a pulled hammy suffered against the Indy WhoZits. So many health questions revolved around NU’s personnel and their availability that subjective analysis of NU’s offensive game plan used during the last 2 games was almost an afterthought. And entering this game, there were doubts all over the map regarding NU’s offensive production and methods used to generated yardage, especially considering that the ‘Cats had just come-off their worst offensive exhibition of the season against the BuckNuts the previous weekend.\n\nCould anyone predict what might happen at all regarding NU’s debilitated offense as it faced a resurgent Michigan defense that stymied Minnie’s O, one of the best in the Big 10/11 conference, on the same Saturday?\n\nThere was strong possibility that this game could get as ugly for the ‘Cats as the playing conditions.\n\nHow the ‘Cats Survived the Big House Blues\n\nDoc’s 2008 Statement\n\nIn pre-game commentaries, lots of attention had been given to the profound negative effects that the adverse weather could have on overall level of field play. Consequently, the Great Equalizer of strong winds, constant rain and cold temps came to the rescue of the ‘Cat D. With the efficacy of the Dazed & Blue passing attack already degraded by the poor capabilities of their ineffectual QB tandem of Steven Threet and Nick Sheridan, this aerial attack option was just stoned in its tracks due to the progressively deteriorating conditions. To quote an old adage, neither QB “could hit an elephant in the ass with an ironing board” via their passing skills.\n\nIn response, Michigan’s offensive brain trust re-directed their yardage generation to their ground game; and in H-1 the Dazed & Blue rushing attack took ‘Cat DC Doc Hankwitz and his D to task in a big way, gaining 66% of its total rush yardage, as lightly-used reserve RB Carlos Brown pounded his way to 74 yards on 13 carries and QB Sheridan gained another 27, and scoring 2 TDs for a 7-point lead going into halftime.\n\nDoc had to do something to stop the bloodletting caused by the Michigan rush paradigm, so he made a major adjustment for H-2. He switched from his original base 4-2-5 formation, specifically designed to neutralize the Dazed & Blue passing game with a 5th DB in his secondary, to a 4-3-4 set, positioning that extra defender in the box to quell the Michigan rushing attack, while simultaneously depending upon the Great Equalizer to prolong the Michigan QB tandem’s frustratingly poor execution of RichRod’s spread game plan for the remainder of the contest.\n\nThe result: the ‘Cat D simply dominated Michigan’s O, throwing a double bagel shutout at the Blue Boys in the game’s last 2 quarters. Michigan’s first 4 possessions of H-2 were 3-and-outs, achieved primarily by utterly stoning the Dazed & Blue rushing attack for 23 inconsequential yards, which in turn, allowed the ‘Cats’ offensive brain trust to shake-off their yardage production doldrums of H-1, recover their own offensive game plan wits and deliver decisive points on their first two possessions in the second half.\n\nDoc Hankwitz and his D had their finest statement half of play in the 2008 campaign.\n\nHome Team’s Troubles\n\nMany people say that trouble comes in threes, and in the case of home team Michigan, it most certainly did in Q1. After C.J. hand delivered a sure-fire scoring opportunity to the Dazed & Blue with an easy INT on his 2nd pass of the game into double coverage that was returned to NU’s 8, it looked like the ‘Cats were bound to bury themselves once again into an early deficit via a miscue of their own making. But instead of capitulating in the face of this challenge, the ‘Cat D flushed the pick and rose to meet it head-on, stonewalling the Dazed & Blue’s short-field possession to a 3-and-out and forcing them to settle for a shortie FG.\n\nTrouble #1: On the ensuing FG attempt, the Blue Boys’ left OT takes a play off and fails to block ‘Cat DE Corey Wootton properly, who knifes into a seam at the LOS, closes the distance between himself and the kicker then throws a paw at the kicked ball, blocking it soundly and killing the gimme 3-pointer. The ‘Cats dodge a bullet, and the score remains at 0-0.\n\nOn the following change of possession, Mick McCall’s stupefying play calling, highlighted by a totally mystifying QB switch over the 1st two plays, kills any and all momentum gained by the blocked FG and forces the ‘Cats into a punt after getting blasted by the Blue Boy D into their own weak-sister 3-and-out possession.\n\nTrouble #2: Michigan PR Odoms, succumbing to a personal brain fart moment, decided at the last possible moment to avoid catching the punted pigskin and allow it to bounce downfield; but instead, the ball bounces off the turf right toward him, caroms off his leg, then the mad scramble for the loose bean is on. In a flash, punt coverage man Eric Peterman snags the pill in bounds at the Michigan 39 for a lightning-quick equalizer turnover.\n\nOn the ensuing NU possession, the Blue Boys DL converts the game’s 1st sack, pinning C.J. for a 9-yard loss and setting-up a 3rd-and-18 down from the Michigan 21. The Dazed & Blue D looked like they dodged their own scoring bullet from the offensively challenged ‘Cat O.\n\nTrouble #3: On this 3rd-and-forever down, the ultra-conservative McCall calls for another safe up-the-gut rush to set-up a subsequent chip-shot FG in the middle of the field. However, instead of stoning the NU ball carrier for limited yards as they had done on the previous 4 attempts, the entire Dazed & Blue defensive front 7 “go walk-about” on the play by locking horns with NU’s OL who use their up-to-now not-too-effective zone reach block technique, and break-down across the entire LOS. This collective hand-fighting action affords NU’s very surprised RB, Stephen Simmons, a huge open lane in the A gap, who promptly breaks into the hole, scampers downfield around and through the Blue Boys 2nd level and crosses into the endzone virtually untouched for a go-ahead TD.\n\nThe TV broadcast showed Rich Rod and his entire team moping along the sidelines, totally stunned in silent, slack-jawed amazement at the 14-point turn-around that had just occurred in game’s first 5 minutes.\n\nSomething special was unfolding for the ‘Cats.\n\nC.J.’s Play in 2 Acts\n\nFor much of H-1, OC Mick McCall appeared totally fixated with his insistence that NU’s O remain true to his original “managed” attack schemes. Well, this original game plan was going nowhere fast, as his all-too-predictable 1st down rush attempts continually got rolled-up at or near the LOS by the Blue Boy defensive front 7 and as his short, controlled passing game got shot down in short order by a Michigan secondary virtually ignoring all deep zone responsibilities to boldly play 7 yards off the LOS and apply constant in-your-shorts blanket coverage on NU’s WRs as they ran their short-route receiving patterns.\n\nAnd with the Dazed & Blue O exploiting the injury-riddled ‘Cat D with their ground-n-pound rushing tactics for a game-tying TD and a major-league gaffe by NU’s punter Stefan Demos leading to the go-ahead TD when he took an extra step in his rugby-style kick only to get his boot blocked then returned in Q2, something radical had to done to NU’s offensive strategy, and done quickly before the game got too far out of hand. It was time for the ‘Cat offense to stand fast and deliver.\n\nI really don’t know whether it was Fitz finally taking command of this nowhere-bound offensive situation, or McCall finally taking the big hint that his original attack schemes were nothing less than abysmal in the face of the python-like constriction of the Dazed & Blue’s D, but the executive decision was made to abandon the totally ineffectual, wholly inappropriate original game plan and resurrect the vertical passing attack. In spite of the freezing rain and blustery winds, C.J. was unleashed to chuck the bean downfield. And it worked to perfection.\n\nWith the freezing rain transitioning to snow at the start of H-2 and after Doc and his boys had weaved their magical halftime adjustment into the fabric of their defensive formations to stonewall the Dazed & Blue O with a 3-and-out on their 1st possession of the half, the stage was set. On the subsequent punt attempt, NU reserve LB, Ben Johnson slithered through the punt team’s double-wall blocks and fronted the punter just as he kicked the ball. The punt hits Johnson square and wobbles in the air for a mere 7 yards, giving the ‘Cat O their best starting field position of the game at the Michigan 40. Then C.J. and his receiving corps went to work to challenge the tight coverage techniques employed by the Dazed & Blue secondary.\n\nConsecutive passes of 20 & 10 yards, followed by an avoidable 7-yard sack, placed the ball on the Blue Boys’ 17. On the next play, an overthrown vertical pass attempt to a wide-open Eric Peterman at the Michigan goal line confirmed that Rich Rod’s secondary continued to defend the short passing zones as priority and were vulnerable. Then bang. WR Ross Lane runs a skinny post into the deep middle 3rd zone and C.J. shoots a laser-beam pass through a thin seam between the Michigan CB and SS straight into the hands of his streaking receiver for a quick-strike, game-tying TD. The small but vocal NU crowd at the Big House erupts while the home crowd watches the whole passion play unfold before them in deathly still silence. And that was only Act I.\n\nAfter the Dazed & Blue’s next possession gets slammed for a 2nd consecutive 3-and-out by Doc’s 4-3-4 defensive adjustment, C.J. and Co. stand front stage, center for their dramatic Act II heroics. From NU’s 47, C.J. drops back behind his pocket protection with snow swirling all around him and spots WR Eric Peterman running another skinny post into the Dazed & Blue deep middle third. Peterman’s coverage SS must choose between staying with Eric in his route or converging on his primary target, a 2nd ‘Cat outside WR running a short outside curl route. The SS chooses to cover the short curl receiver. C.J. cleanly sees the coverage decision by the SS that leaves his target free and clear to run his pass pattern into open space then coolly delivers the bean, hitting the senior WR in stride at 25 yards. Mr. Peterman takes the pass in hand and rambles solo the remaining 28 yards to paydirt for the ‘Cats’ 2nd and game-clinching TD in Q3.\n\nThe curtain closes on Act II with the ‘Cats in the lead by 7 and Doc’s defense in control.\n\nAn Official’s Blow\n\nBesides C.J.’s two fantastic downfield pass completions for NU TDs, the most critical play of the entire contest came at the hands of the game officials. Normally, most referees possess the clear vision and mental wherewithal to make the correct calls over the course of a football game in spite of the lightning fast activity surrounding them. And in the advent of the review system, they now have the mechanism to rectify 98% of the calls that they might miss. However, it’s that 2% that can be a game-maker or game-breaker. And unfortunately, such was the case in last Saturday’s highly competitive clash between the ‘Cats and the Dazed & Blue Horde.\n\nAfter the ‘Cats re-captured the lead with their 2nd TD scored within the first 5:30 of H-2, McCall began to employ an attack scheme that was much more balanced and effective than in H-1. The critical difference that increased the effectiveness of this diverse attack strategy was NU’s successful vertical passing attack in early Q3. Michigan’s defensive brain trust had to respect the ‘Cats’ ability to defy the rain and snow-filled elements and complete the downfield pass attempt, and subsequently, were forced to re-set their DBs off the LOS, which opened-up the ‘Cats’ complimentary ground game.\n\nOn NU’s 1st possession of Q4, the ‘Cat O settled into a comfortable rhythm, gaining a 1st down on a 12 yard pass completion and setting the table for a 2nd with a 3rd-&-managable-3 down near midfield. C.J. rolls to his right looking downfield, spots an open WR running a 10-yard out route at the Michigan 44 and delivers the ball right on target. Unfortunately, the pass hits the WR in the wrong spot, his hands, and the pigskin slips through the receiver’s fingers and straight into the mitts of the cover DB 3 yards behind. The DB secures the tip-drill INT, turns upfield and sprints down the sideline towards the NU goal line, avoiding several attempts by NU players to push him out of bounds. As the DB swerves to his left to avoid an extended-arm push from a ‘Cat lineman, the official blows his whistle and waves his arms overhead indicating that he had seen the DB step out at NU’s 44, essentially killing the play at the spot. The DB, not hearing the whistle or seeing stoppage of play indicator and feeling that he remained in bounds, continues his sprint down the sideline and crosses NU’s goal line for a potential game-tying TD.\n\nMichigan’s HC Rich Rod calls for a reply review of the INT and its return. The tape review clearly shows that indeed, the DB had kept his feet inbounds the entire way down the sideline and into the NU endzone. However, since the ref’s whistle had been blown, the play was dead and not reviewable. The hapless official had blown an inadvertent whistle and everything that happened afterwards, including pick-6 INT return, was disallowed. It was this game-changing blown call that gave the ‘Cats an official, pun intended, “Get out of jail “ escape card. The home crowd fans went bananas, but to no avail.\n\nOn the ensuing possession, Michigan’s O pushed the ball to the NU 23, where yet another errant pass by the inconsistent QB Threet flew over the head of its intended receiver and dropped into the welcome hands of a diving Jordan Mabin for an NU touchback that terminates the scoring opportunity. From that point on, the Dazed & Blue offense never mounts another viable scoring threat.\n\nGame over.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Wildcats and their coaching staff parlayed the Great Equalizer, an astute halftime adjustment on defense, a resuscitated vertical passing attack on offense, and a game-clinching blown call by the refs to secure the “W”. As ugly as the weather conditions were and as ugly as some of the field play was on the gridiron, the ‘Cats proudly walked out of the Big House arm-in-arm with the beautiful Miss Victory, escorting her back to Evanston for the first time since ’95. It was a match made in heaven.\n\nNU truly needed this “W” to bolster their win total to 8 because, without it, most every post-season bowl committee had a viable opportunity to pass-over “no-name” Northwestern for another more “nationally-attractive” conference team with a worse overall record in their team selection process. Now, these fickle committees have to face the unavoidable truth: the 2008 ‘Cats, with their 33 year old HC and his newly contracted coordinators, are for real.\n\nWith a “W” this Saturday against irksome, bombastic Ill-Annoy, the ‘Cats and the Wildcat Nation at large are due to receive a late-December or possible New Year invitation somewhere in warm and sunny Florida.\n\nGo get ‘em, ‘Cats! Smash the PumpkinHeads!!!\n\nThe Waterboy\n\nNov. 13, 2008\n\nSlip-Slidin’ Away\n\nLast Saturday’s contest against the BuckNuts was a throwback to the type of game that many Wildcat faithful had witnessed from the ‘Cats in the mid 80s, the Dark Ages. I know that this is an extremely harsh statement, but there were too many similarities to games played throughout those dismal days to avoid this unimaginable comparison. For the first time this season, I felt that I had seen NU’s coaching staff and players wave the virtual white flag of surrender. However, in all fairness, I cannot dismiss the entire body of effort displayed by the ‘Cats. Throughout Q1, the only period in which NU maintained their competitive edge, the ‘Cats' field play matched the intensity and resolve of the BuckNuts as both teams pounded one another like a couple of heavyweight boxers exchanging body shots and haymakers to the chin. But it was when critical game items began to degrade significantly from Q2 onward, especially play calling on both sides of the LOS, that the overall field play quality of the Wildcats unraveled like a cheap suit.\n\nAnd to my chagrin, I truly don’t have an answer regarding the causes or reasons behind why these offensive and defensive degradations ever occurred. But as the game continued beyond Q1, it became an undeniable reality that control of the contest slipped away from the grasp of the Fitz and his ‘Cats and was seized by the BuckNut brain trust. The most disappointing aspect of this whole enterprise was that this game transitioned into a scoreboard blowout, when the team, as a group, isn’t blowout worthy or deserving.\n\nHow the Da BuckNuts Overwhelmed the ‘Cats\n\nTake a Whiff\n\nI don’t know what it was, how it started or why it became so pronounced as the game progressed, but this deadly disease spread among Doc Hankwitz’ D personnel like a plague… the whiff, as in missed tackles. The single most important item that has been demanded and emphasized throughout Doc’s inaugural year as Wildcat DC is tackling fundamentals. You know, that thing where a defender sprints right up to his tackling target, lowers his pads with head up and eyes focused, keeps on the balls of his feet, delivers a full-force blow at contact and drives the target to the turf. Hard, crisp and with extreme prejudice.\n\nWell, if you were looking at NU last Saturday for a viable exhibition of consistent, hard-nosed tackling, you were looking in the wrong direction. Simply stated, the ‘Cats usually sure tackling techniques went south in a flash against the speedy, elusive skill position players of the BuckNut O and was the number one reason why the ‘Cats lost miserably against daOSU. The most poignant example of NU’s overt lack of pursuit to the ball and basic tackling skills was when ‘Cat DT John Gill had BuckNut RB, Beanbag Wells, in his grasp for a 4 yard TFL, only to slip off inexplicably, allowing the BeanBag to bolt right up the gut of the LOS untouched by another NU defender for a 55 TD scamper, as the rest of NU’s D hand-fought their blockers and didn’t get within 5 yards of the Beanbag.\n\nI know that Dr. Hankwitz’ players are much better at this fundamental football skill than what they showed, but the entire ‘Cat defense was well off their game. Now in prior seasons, NU’s D has always had a very dubious reputation when defending a mobile, fleet-footed QB, particularly under the mentorship of former DC, Greg “Behold the Power of Swiss Cheese” Colby. Hell, that’s how the ‘Cat defenders got this reputation in the first place. But that was then, and this is now… and now, under Doc’s tutelage, NU’s defensive personnel have shed this putrid albatross from their collective necks and have re-invented themselves as a crafty, disciplined, hard-hitting squad… until this game. In this game, they regressed to the stumbling, bumbling MildCats of old, most especially on 2nd or 3rd and long, where BuckNut crybaby QB, Terrelle Pryor, doing his best imitation of former collegiate QB Vince Young, after having scanned the NU secondary for an open receiver behind his pocket protection , tucked the ball under arm then ran over, around and through feeble hand grabs, mistimed body throws at his legs and weak-sister arm tackles, converting most all of them into possession-extending 1st downs. This team-wide failure to hit BuckNut ball carriers square and take them down proved to be the ultimate kiss of death for Fitz and Co.\n\nOver the Top Gaffes\n\nFrom my viewpoint in the west stands, it was obvious that Doc Hankwitz’ primary strategy for his defensive secondary was rush-support first from the opening whistle. And for the most part, this strategy was effective, except when it faced those frequent and annoying “3rd & double-digit” down situations. Unfortunately, whenever that occurred, NU’s defensive house of cards came tumbling down.\n\nI’m sure that it was equally obvious to the offensive spotters sitting in the BuckNut coach’s box above Dyche’s Ditch to recognize that the ‘Cat safeties were abandoning their deep middle 3rd pass coverage zone and over-playing their run support responsibilities to sprint upfield in their all-out bid to add their $.02 in NU’s hit parade against BuckNut ball carriers. Regrettably, this tactic was as heavily short-sighted as it was flawed and doomed to failure from the start - as exemplified in the BuckNut’s first possession. My younger brother, who was watching the game with me, voiced a simple one-liner when, on this drive, NU SS Brad Phillips completed a successful safety blitz for a 10 yard TFL against BuckNut RB, Beanbag Wells, creating a 2nd & 20 situation at the NU 50. “Your safeties are leaving the deep 3rd open.” Two downs later, BuckNut QB Pryor made a play-action fake handoff to Beanbag, waited patiently as NU’s safety tandem of Smith & Phillips bit hard and came upfield on the fake, then lofted a lazy floater to a wide open WR, Brian Hartline, running 7 yards behind any ‘Cat DB, who made the completion and fell to the turf at the NU 2. On the next down, a simple plunge by the BeanBag into NU’s A gap nets an easy TD and a 7-0 lead for the BuckNuts. So much for that ill-advised run-support first strategy by the NU safeties, right? Not so...\n\nThe most critical tactical blunder of the game for the ‘Cats was that DC Doc Hankwitz steadfastly refused to take this first hint and kept employing his original run-support first strategy for his cover-2 safeties. And when the smoke finally cleared, Smith & Phillips repeated their play-recognition gaffes on several more occasions, each of which hand-delivered substantive long-yardage gains to the BuckNuts - on BeanBag’s 55-yard TD run mentioned above, on a 2nd Pryor-to-Hartline 46 yard heave to the NU 22 that set-up another gimme TD, and another 34-yard passing strike in Q4. If it’s broken, then fix it.\n\nAs the old saying goes… fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. And last Saturday, there was as much shame to be spread among the ‘Cats’ defensive brain trust as there was among their safeties.\n\nTakin’ What They’re Givin’ - The Refusal\n\nDuring the week leading up to NU’s grapple with the Minnie Mighty Marmots, I was grousing to NU fans about the necessity to diversify the 1st down play-calling for the ‘Cats’ offense. After having been forced to replace starting QB C.J. Bacher with seldom-used 2nd string QB Mike Kafka due to injury, I felt NU’s offensive interests would be served best if ‘Cat OC Mick McCall would avoid his penchant of predictably using the rush on 1st down and substitute these ground game calls with the pass. I wasn’t referring to McCall’s well-chronicled “managed” passing attack either, but to his timidly-called vertical varietal where the Marmot secondary would be obligated to position themselves 10-12 yards off from the LOS to respect their deep coverage zone responsibilities. And much to my surprise, McCall obliged and did just that… And lo and behold, Kafka came through, converting 2 fantastic completions to WRs running deep routes - one over the top for a TD and another between the somnolent Marmot safeties that set-up a subsequent FG giving the ‘Cats a 10-point lead all in the game’s initial 10 minutes. These two quick-strike scores stunned over-confident Golden Rodents and their Homecoming crowd and set the tone for aggressive offensive display that lasted the entire game.\n\nAgainst daOSU, I was hoping for a repeat play calling performance where McCall would keep the BuckNut defense at bay from stacking the box with defenders on 1st down through liberal use of the pass. But McCall reverted to his old play-calling paradigm, and I can only speculate on the reasons for this decision. Perhaps it was the intimidation factor of the BuckNut’s unrelenting pass rush pressure provided by their defensive front 7 or the ultra quick-reactions and INT-production of their secondary. But whatever the rationale, McCall simply tanked on challenging the BuckNut DBs by directing his offensive attack away from the downfield pass. And this decision eviscerated the ‘Cats’ capacity to produce yardage throughout much of the game beyond Q1.\n\nMind you, McCall didn’t eschew the pass completely, but NU’s aerial attack was restricted to Mr. Mick’s “managed” passing paradigm of the 3-yard square-out, the short dump-off or crossing pattern and McCall’s apparent personal favorite, the WR bubble screen, while the downfield pass was treated like anathema. In fact, there were entire possessions where McCall called Kafka’s ball carrier number almost exclusively to the point where I felt that our reserve QB was one hard knock away from getting laid-out for the Dyche’s Ditch meat wagon; until…\n\nOn NU’s 1st possession of Q3, McCall called for another “managed” pass, his darling WR bubble screen, on 1st down and… it went for 24 yards! Maybe, just maybe there truly was something positive to be gained from this 1st down pass thing. Two possessions later, McCall seemingly started to get it and called for the Kafka pass a couple more times on 1st down. Result: nice gains of 6 and 22 yards, each setting the table for even more substantive yardage gains on subsequent downs with a balanced mix of runs and passes, all of which helped the ‘Cat O drive deep into the BuckNut’s red zone. Then the bottom fell-out, when McCall reversed his rediscovered interest the calling the pass on a 1st & 10 down and called for a Simmons rush. Stoned for no gain. Now, with long-distance downs dictating the obvious pass, the BuckNut DC unleashed his blitz package and a bewildered Kafka, after having scrambled around NU’s backfield in vain to avoid the oncoming pass rush, got sacked for losses of 9 and 19 yards on consecutive downs, taking the ‘Cats out of FG range. Yet in spite of the setback, that offensive series showed that NU’s offense could have or, more correctly, should have used the 1st down pass for more productive yardage generation.\n\nI could only shake my head at McCall’s refusal to take what the BuckNut defense had given.\n\nThe Knock-Out Punch\n\nThe knock-out punch of the game delivered by the BuckNuts occurred when HC Tressel called for a fake punt after the Cats stopped an OSU drive in Q4 trailing by 21. The ‘Cats’ punt return team has a now-recognized tendency to turn tail and sprint back to their punt return positions, once the long snap is made, without keeping a spy defender at the LOS to ensure that the kick is actually made. This dubious tendency was identified 2 weeks prior during the game with the WhoZits, when their punter noticed the defender-less open space literally spread-out before him as NU’s defenders peeled-away from the LOS. In reaction, the punter promptly tucked the ball and bolted downfield behind the ‘Cat punt returners for a 17-yard gain and a drive-extending 1st down that lead to an eventual game-deciding TD.\n\nWell, the same scenario unfolded against the BuckNuts, as punter A.J. Trapasso recognized the same open space at the LOS as the NU punt return team peeled-off and took off ball in hand for a 1st down.\n\nGame film doesn’t lie. And the ensuing TD scored after this 1st down conversion, not only ballooned the BuckNut lead to 28, but it cut the heart out of the ‘Cat D.\n\nMailing It In\n\nThe most frustrating part of the game was the final 7:36 that followed the fake punt and its resultant TD. Body language among the ‘Cat D was telling - heads down, jogging on & off the field, no enthusiasm. It was more than noticeable. When a change of possession occurred following the final 8-yard sack of Kafka on 4th down, giving the BuckNuts the ball at midfield, the ‘Cats were dead at the scene. Tressel sent his 3rd string O onto the field, who were loaded for bear and dying for PT. These reservists simply tore the discouraged ‘Cat defense apart with a cold-blooded efficiency unlike anything that I’ve seen this fall. Although I cannot blame these BuckNuts scrubs for their high level of effort exhibited at the time, but I certainly cannot condone the ‘Cat D mailing it in during this end-game period, aka, garbage time. Was this lack of heart consequential to anything on the scoreboard? No. However, from the stands, it came off as an emotional exclamation point that underscored just how complete this loss was to the ‘Cats. Damn.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs counterpoint to the euphoria that thoroughly inundated the ‘Cats and the Wildcat Nation in general after their hard-fought, come-from-behind, last 30 second victory via a heart-stopping pick-6 INT return against the Golden Rodents, this game was its complete gut-wrenching antithesis. There’s not much more to say. A rout like this can be devastating to a program, or, if flushed properly, its lasting effects might be minimized. This is a vital responsibility of NU’s coaching staff’s to address.\n\nAs final comment, I just hope that Fitz and his coaches, especially McCall and Doc, take a good hard look at the man in the mirror and ask him what that guy could have done to reverse this train wreck as it was happening. Da BuckNuts are most certainly the best football team NU will oppose in this 2008 campaign, and a competitive loss to them is no great failure. However, a 34-point blowout is a completely different animal altogether.\n\nNext Saturday’s foe, the Dazed & Blue Horde from Ann Arbor, is not the BuckNut equivalent, but a team who is starting to grow into its own body and find its own rhythm. It’s important to jump on them now. Next season they might have a growing spurt.\n\nThe Waterboy\n\nNov. 6, 2008\n\nOh Ye of Little Faith\n\nOK, I admit it… after last Saturday’s implosion in Bloomington at the hands of an overmatched, yet game Indy WhoZit football team, I had not drunk a sip of Purple Kool-Aide. Not once. And so, I never expected that the ‘Cats had even a snowball’s chance in hell of beating the rising-star, 7-1, “soon-to-be-granted-3rd-place-in-the-Big10/11” Golden Rodents… on the road… on their Homecoming… and in front of 50K enthusiastic fans. Adding to my dire conviction was the fact that the ‘Cats were to play this game minus several of their most productive playmakers: starting QB C.J. Bacher, starting RB Tyrell Sutton and starting MLB Malcom Arrington. Man, this looked grim. Many among the Wildcat Nation took Fitz’ mantra to heart and shouted “Flush It,” but I just couldn’t. Not that I was stubborn or short-sighted, but the realist in me had too tight a grip on my perspective to allow me unfettered belief that NU still had enough weapons in their arsenal to compete and beat the Mighty Marmots of Minnie-Ha-Ha. Boy, was I in for a surprise, as were the Marmots.\n\nHow the ‘Cats Mauled the Mighty Marmots\n\nGood Enough\n\nSomething went down with the ‘Cat OL between their game against the WhoZits and last Saturday’s grapple against the Golden Rodents. When they played the WhoZits, NU’s OL, in general, threw-in a clunker. It wasn’t as if everyone on the squad blew blocking assignments wholesale. It was that one critical breakdown along the LOS that stoned individual plays; and after 2-3 similar failures in a row, those mistakes collectively stalled an entire offensive possession. Until the WhoZit game, No. 8 in the season, I had not seen the ‘Cat OL misfire like that on a regular basis for an entire 60 minutes. My great hope going into the Minnie game was that, against another quality DL like the one that the Rodents fielded, McCall and Ingalls could refocus their young linemen to return to the high percentage rate of successful blocking that was exhibited during, say, the Iowa contest.\n\nAnd I’m happy to announce that, for the majority of the Rodent game, they did. Mind you, blocking assignment miscues remained in evidence, particularly when executing the reach block technique on the 1st down rush or when setting pocket protection during a drop-back pass, but nothing approaching the frequency that was shown in their previous game. One thing that the OL did very well was position block their targets especially at the defensive corners. I’m talking seal blocks to the inside against the Marmot DTs and MLBs coupled with kick-out-and-wall techniques performed against the Rodent DEs and OLBs. Essentially what was occurring at the LOS, was NU’s OL were locking horns with their targets and maintaining contact for 3, 4, even a full 5 seconds, then pushing that target defender in the direction he had moved at the snap of the ball. If the DT slanted to the center, NU’s OG locked onto his outside shoulder and drove him down the LOS towards the OC. If the DE stayed home respecting his defensive corner-contain responsibility on the backside away from flow, NU’s OT or TE locked on and drove him to the outside or simply walled him from the offensive flow going in the opposite direction. These position/seal blocks created open rushing lanes, often on the backside, opposite initial offensive flow, in which newly-installed, 2nd string QB, Mike Kafka, recognized and sprinted into and through with abandon.\n\nIt seemed like Coach Ingalls’ primary directive to each of his OL against this defense was to engage his blocking target and maintain contact for as long as he could without resorting to clips or holds as that target gained separation. And it worked. It was THE main reason why Kafka, holding the ball for what seemed to be a full 2-3 seconds in the NU backfield, could read where the open seam was developing at the LOS then blast through it. Development for NU’s rushing plays became much slower than normal and it required great patience on the part of Kafka not to panic and bolt prematurely as he allowed the blocking pattern to coalesce before him. However, once it did, he took advantage of the crease after it opened, often gaining the Rodent D’s 2nd level before he was first touched. Essentially the OL seal block was just “good enough” to generate yardage.\n\nAs effective as the seal block was, the OL’s use of the reach block technique during rushes by RB Omar Conteh was nothing less than a total disaster. With 2nd stringer, Mike Kafka, thrust into the role of starting QB as replacement to the injured Bacher, the Rodent DL were prepared well for NU’s offensive game plan to be highly rush-oriented. When faced with the ‘Cats’ scrimmage line-wide reach blocks, these defenders regularly gained immediate separation from their blocking OL, charged upfield into the NU backfield and corralled the hapless Conteh 4-6 yards behind the LOS, often just as the handoff was made to him. I really don’t know what fuels McCall and Ingalls’ apparent season-long love affair with this zone/reach block technique, but they must be seeing something that I’m obviously missing. The only thing I saw initially was is the constant TFLs when the OL execute it, especially against better DL personnel like that of the Marmots. I was due for a rude awakening regarding this point of view.\n\nHere She Is: Miss Direction\n\nI’ve been barking loud and long regarding the complete lack of counter action in NU’s offensive game plan since the ‘Cats’ game versus Sorry-Excuse. In fact, the next time NU’s OC Mick McCall calls for counter rush behind the trap blcok, it will be the first of its kind for the season. With that said, the OL front-side and backside seal blocking schemes against the Golden Rodents were the perfect set-up for the misdirection play. Whether executed by improvisation or design, the cutback run, away from the play’s initial flow and into the open seam was always there for the taking, and Kafka, running various QB keepers, exploited them early and often. In particular, with NU’s speed option into flow gaining the most positive yards when Kafka didn’t pitch to his option RB but kept the ball in his own hands, and after having read the defensive posture of the Mighty Marmots’ DE, making a decisive move either inside or around this corner contain, the misdirection became its perfect counter-action play. In addition, my negative perspective of the frequent 1st down handoff plays to Conteh running the wide veer began to change dramatically. These veers, which depend heavily on the zone-reach blocking technique by NU’s OL described above and against which the Rodent defensive front 7 constantly sniffed-out and stoned for TFLs, were nothing less than a diversion, a ruse to set-up the misdirection QB keeper. Essentially, Conteh was sacrificed, having gained only 12 total yards due to losing 19 to these “managed” TFLs. Yet in doing so, he took the defensive attention and heat away from Kafka, who simply went bananas running the bean himself.\n\nMany NU offensive possessions became poetry in motion. Once that 1st down veer fell victim to the sell-out penetration by the Mighty Marmot front 7, they were primed. On the following play, NU would execute, say, a speed option using the same reach block technique, against which the entire Marmot front 7, sniffing another easy TFL, bit hard once again. Only this time, Kafka slowed his pace just long enough to let a cutback seam develop off the inside seal and outside kick-out blocks against the backside DT and DE, then bingo, the misdirection trap was sprung, as he cut back against flow then into and through whatever crease had opened. Mr. K. shifted into high gear and sprinted upfield in long, loping strides, passing hand-fighting DL, LBs grabbing for him against their bodies and DBs desperately trying to ward-off well-executed stud blocks by the ‘Cat WRs, while gaining substantive yardage virtually every time it was run. And these misdirection plays were not limited to being executed exclusively off the rush. Kafka’s biggest yardage gain of the game, the 53 yard scamper that set-up NU’s 2nd TD, was executed off a fake bubble screen pass to his left; where the entire Rodent D once more bit hard on his throwing motion and flew to cover this short wide zone; then he tucked the ball under his arm, scooted up to the opposite defensive corner, cut off the block of NU’s TE who had locked horns with the backside Rodent DE, and flew down the right sideline to the Marmot 2. It was an absolute brilliant call.\n\nFaced with this misdirection, the entire Golden Rodent defense was back on their heels in short order. Keeping with their apparent defensive game plan, they continued their sell-out crash and penetrate reaction to NU’s reach block techniques, but they didn’t know where the ball was to go – was it inside or around the defensive corner into flow via the speed option, was it a misdirection away from flow via the QB keeper, was it a possession sideline pass off a QB rollout into flow, was it a pull-up pass attempt behind a shifted umbrella pass protection? An amazing nuance of this offensive scheme was that McCall retained a great deal of his original game plan , including NU’s standard drop-back, “managed” short-pass attack, which Kafka executed efficiently, generating much-needed yardage on critical downs throughout the game.\n\nA much broader picture of NU’s offensive strategy was becoming much clearer.\n\nFor Openers\n\nIn general, the pivotal piece of the Mighty Marmot team is their defense. It’s a quality squad that has experienced their own resurgence of sorts in 2008 under the tutelage of former Duke HC-made-DC Ted Roof. Over their last 3 games, this resuscitated D has strangled the offenses of their opponents, including the multi-dimensional, high-octane offense of Ill-Annoy, and in the process, has recorded a Division 1A best turnover differential of +15 (26 takeaways to 11 giveaways). And when the Golden Rodent defense creates a turnover, it simply ignites their offense.\n\nComing into this game, NU’s biggest deficiency has been their well-chronicled, problematic penchant for baking hot and flaky turnovers, giving their opponents multiple short-field possessions for easy points. And I truly believe that, last Saturday, the Golden Rodent D fully expected to catch the ‘Cats in their usual generous mood and provide their O several trouble-free opportunities to garner quick scores. However, the ‘Cat offense surprised their homecoming hosts by firing on all cylinders from the opening whistle and driving the pigskin down the throats of the Mighty Marmot D in their first two possessions to score a TD and FG in the game’s initial 8 minutes – all while maintaining a healthy respect for the ball. When broadcast cameras scanned their sidelines, the Marmot D looked downright shell-shocked as they found themselves starring up at the ‘Cats from unexpected 10-point deficit.\n\nBasically, these two opening series by NU’s O set the tone for the rest of the game, and delivered a loud and clear message to the Rodents that, despite the absence of the ‘Cats’ two best offensive playmakers, they were in for a full 60 minute fight.\n\nSet to Succeed\n\nA field play pattern has begun to emerge with Doc Hankwitz and his attack-oriented defense - they are becoming increasingly more successful in limiting scoring drives and points in H-2, especially in Q4. This pattern started-out slowly during the Perdue game where NU’s D stymied the Broiler-Chicken O throughout much of H-2, except for 2 garbage-time explosion plays, a 32-yard bomb and a 76-yard scamper, both off embarrassing defensive gaffes that resulted in inconsequential TDs. Then in NU’s humiliating defeat to the WhoZits, the D’s only blemish in H-2 was its boneheaded pass coverage blunder that gift-wrapped the disastrous 28-yard TD pass that provided Indy with their game-deciding points and capped an offensive possession kick-started by an equally devastating 53-yard KO return, giving the WhoZit O fantastic starting field position at the ‘Cat 47.\n\nBut Doc’s D finally put it together against the Mighty Marmots, shutting them down for double bagels over the final 2 quarters. And this was done against a Minnie offense that had scored 58 points in Q3 and a commendable 80 points in Q4 over their previous 8 games, many of which were game-clinching scores. Even more remarkable was the fact that this shutout was throw with a depleted defensive roster where two of the ‘Cats’ most prolific playmakers, the aforementioned MLB Arrington and pass rushing specialist teammate, DE V. Browne, were out of the game. The foundation of Doc’s defensive game plan was built around a new 4-2-5 formation designed specifically to limit the effective passing prowess of the Golden Rodent’s quality QB, Adam Weber, and to increase the coverage capabilities of the NU secondary against the Rodent receiving corps, that included WR Eric Decker, who was ranked 3rd and 7th nationally in catches per game and yards per game respectively.\n\nAnd did this defensive set ever succeed!!! The Mighty Marmots’ ground game was stoned in place for a net total of a 68 measly yards; while Decker’s receiving day was compressed to only 62. However, none of this laudable effort by the ‘Cat D would have amounted to diddly-squat had they not come-up with THE lockdown game-deciding defensive stand of the game…\n\n…& Throw Away the Key\n\nThe most consequential offensive possession in the game by the Golden Rodents was their 93-yard drive in Q3 that started from their own 5 and methodically marched all the way to NU’s 2. Then and there, in the shadow of his own goalline, Senior DT Kevin Mims made the single most impressive defensive stop of the 2008 season. Rodent HC Brewster called for a fake handoff to his RB Eskridge diving into his OL’s A gap, followed by a naked bootleg run by QB Weber attempting to scoot around NU’s left defensive corner into the endzone for the go-ahead TD. But Mims would have none of it. He stuffed then shed his blocking OL, sniffed-out the fake handoff and stayed home to maintain his corner contain responsibility, then blasted Weber in his tracks, who crumpled to the turf for a 1-yard TFL at the NU 3. A good offensive call neutralized by an even better defensive play.\n\nWeber was visibly shaken by the heavy lumber laid across his chest by the Mims hit. On the next play, his weak-sister pass attempt to a WR running a 5 yard square-out sideline pattern in the ‘Cats’ endzone fell feebly at his target’s feet. The cherry on NU’s ice cream sundae, goal line stand, was when the subsequent Rodent FG attempt was kicked wide right and doinked off the upright. Not only had this defensive stand stoned trickeration play for a possible TD, the Rodent FG kicker blew a chip-shot 3 pointer – each play resulting in missed go-ahead score that would have held significant impact on the field play strategies employed for the remainder of the game. After that series, the Mighty Marmot O was pronounced dead at the scene, as they were only able to push the ball into Wildcat territory once more in their next 5 possessions, setting the table for the game’s momentous final 30 seconds.\n\nYes, you can say it… “LOCKDOWN!!!”\n\nConclusion\n\nAll the field play points listed above were mere prelude to NU’s Defensive Play Of The Year, the highlight reel, 48-yard interception return by Brendan Smith for the game’s go-ahead TD and the “W.” This bowl bid-securing INT was a fitting end to a collective defensive performance that was 3 games in the making. Doc’s D personnel have shown steady lockdown improvement against their opposition in H-2 over each of these games and this pick-6 play was its culmination – thus far. I honestly feel that this 2nd half tour de force was the end of the beginning to NU’s resurrection from defensive oblivion, and that truly there is much more to come in the future.\n\nNow the onus is squarely on NU’s offense. The multi-dimensional rushing attack that was unveiled by the crack running of 2nd string QB Kafka has the potential to be NU’s version of college football’s latest offensive weapon: the versatile, heavy-weight QB who is both a high quality rusher and an accurate passer. Donavan McNabb was the forerunner for this new QB paradigm, and Tim Tebow of the U. of Florida Garter-belts is the best example of this weapon among the current collegiate ranks. This is all TBD.\n\nAnd this Saturday: Da Big, Bad BuckNuts from the banks of the Olentangy. Time to flush this game and focus on this next challenge, boys.\n\nThe Waterboy\n\nOctober 30, 2008\n\nAny Given Saturday\n\nYes, any team can beat any other team any given Saturday. NU’s pillow fight against the Indy WhoZits was testament to that adage. Unfortunately for the ‘Cats, they were on the losing end of last weekend’s clash of feather-dusters, and in the process, completely reversed much of what they had accomplished over the previous 7 games. Not only did this “L” shove NU far down the pecking order of current Big 10/11 bowl qualifiers, but owning a season-ending injury to Tyrell Sutton and a “game-or-two” injury-induced absence of the Wildcats’ primary ball handler, QB C.J. Bacher, the ‘Cats could get shut-out of a post season bowl altogether.\n\nImpossible you say? Well think again folks. Of NU’s 4 remaining opponents, there are no gimme “W”s whatsoever, especially considering the motivational circumstances which surround each upcoming foe…\n\n• The Minnie Golden Rodents, with their 7-1 record, are on the brink of finalizing a remarkable worst-to-first season where expected “W’s” over a now-declawed NU Mildcats, a Dazed & Blue Horde fielding a foundering O and a defensively-challenged Wisky are a near surety. The lone remaining roadblock to the Mighty Marmots’ lock for a shared 2nd-place conference finish is their at-home grapple against an unexpectedly revitalized I-Away Hog-Eyes.\n\n• Da BuckNuts, fresh off the season-shattering, mistake-driven loss in their winner-take-all showdown against State Penn, must defeat the remainder of their 2008 foes, including the ‘Cats, in convincing, blowout fashion to keep their faint hopes alive to get a mere whiff of a BCS bowl bid.\n\n• The Dazed & Blue Horde of Ann Arbor, after enduring last Saturday’s whippin’ at the hands of in-state, arch-enemy Moo U., will be hell bent to avoid an embarrassing “L” to the lowly MildCats in their final home game of 2008\n\n• Enigmatic Ill-Annoy, who watched their New Years Bowl bid aspirations convincingly crash-n-burn in their turnover-laden meltdown to a struggling Wisky team, will go all-out in a desperate, last-ditch effort to garner that bowl-qualifiying 6th “W” in their 2008 finale against the ‘Cats.\n\nIt’s downright difficult to ever have envisioned the gut-wrenching demise of NU’s wondrous, season-of-gridiron-confirmation at the hands of the Big 10/11’s bottom feeding WhoZits, whose only victories in their otherwise forgettable 2008 season were against 2 lowly Division 1-AA creampuffs. This game was a predicted walk-over for the 6-1 ‘Cats, a final tune-up before NU prepared to combat the beefy, bowl-bound portion of this season’s conference campaign. However, the WhoZits failed to read that inter-office memo outlining their expected roll-over and submission during this contest. Instead, the WhoZits defied the Wildcats’ hubris, determined to redeem their season of frustration and recover a modicum of respectability by taking it to a team who was both full of themselves and primed for an upset.\n\nHow the WhoZits Sniped the ‘Cats\n\nRed Zone Blues\n\nWhat a difference a week makes. Where the previous Saturday, the ‘Cat offense couldn’t do anything wrong in the red zone, against the WhoZits, that same squad could do little right. Obviously, the WhoZit defensive brain trust used a long, poignant film review of NU’s game against Moo U. to design a similar defensive strategy to limit the prolific point production of a Wildcat O that appeared to be rounding into form. The main tactic when defending the ‘Cats’ yardage generating tandem of Bacher and Sutton was to bend but not break, to allow these playmakers to go wild moving the ball between the 20s, but once they gained the red zone, to stack the box to stone the rush, jam NU’s receivers at the LOS with their DBs and stick to them like glue to break-up the pass. And most important… wait for the ‘Cats to self-destruct, which unfortunately, they were inclined to do.\n\nThis model was heavily dependent on the predictable nature of NU’s offensive game plan that was conceived by the Wildcat offensive brain trust composed of 1st year OC Mick McCall and 3rd year HC Pat Fitz, and employed throughout the season with little variation. There major characteristic flaws of this game plan include:\n\n• The blocking schemes for NU’s OL are based primarily on zone blocking at the point of attack and frequently use reach block techniques across the entire line. The only OL pulls are used during QB roll-outs that are designed sideline pass attempts.\n\n• NU’s rushing attack does not use misdirection, traps or counter action. The RB receives the handoff from the DB, reads the zone or reach blocks by the OL at the LOS and looks for seams to drive into and through, especially on the backside to execute cut-back runs.\n\n• NU’s passing game includes few if any vertical passes. This attack is restricted almost exclusively to spreading the opposing secondary horizontally and its success depends on a quick read & release of the ball to the open wide receiver, often running routes of 10 yards or less from the LOS within the outer 3rd zones. What vertical passes may be attempted, the QB has shown little or no accuracy in delivering the ball, often under throwing his target receiver.\n\n• When pressured, NU’s QB has shown a strong tendency to force the ball to his target receiver with little or no regard to coverage profile.\n\nIndy’s defensive game plan was devised specifically to exploit these flaws. Against NU’s formidable rushing attack and its strict zone blocking schemes, DTs and LBs were directed to shoot the A & B gaps while the DEs crashed inside the slower-reacting OTs, both stunts allowing any member of the defensive front 7 to penetrate across the LOS, collapse NU’s backfield and disrupt offensive flow. With little or no counter action, each WhoZit DL was free to penetrate upfield and locate the ball without threat of getting trapped blocked. If executed successfully, this penetration could compromise 80% of the ‘Cat’s ground game. And it didn’t matter who carried the ball. Once the handoff is made, the seam reads by NU’s RB were often slow, where any breakdown in the blocking along the LOS had strong potential to stone the rush in its tracks. Meanwhile, a fake handoff kept the ball in possession of the QB, who is an admitted reluctant ball carrier, without a swift turn of foot and doesn’t take a hard tackle very well.\n\nThis defense scheme was fairly efficient as evidenced by the final rushing stats compiled by NU’s RB tandem of Sutton & Conteh - a mere 110 yards off 37 carries; but its greatest effect was felt when the ‘Cat O was in the red zone. The closer NU pushed ball towards the WhoZit goalline, the stiffer Indy’s run defense became because of their shoot-the-gap & penetrate mentality. Making matters worse was McCall’s call for a “rhino formation”: a power rush offensive set, using 2 TEs, with an I-formation backfield, that positioned a “super-back” as lead blocking back in front of the intended ball carrying RB. Simply stated, NU’s young OL are not well-equipped or experienced enough to execute this power set effectively, and at the snap of the ball, got little, if no push against the opposing Indy DL. As a result, TFLs, short gains and zero gains on rushes inside the WhoZit 20 were commonplace. In fact, on the possession that scored NU’s 1st rushing TD from Indy’s 11 yard line, NU had rushes of 2, zero, -1 (a sack), 2, 2, and finally a 1 yard dive for the TD - all of which sandwiched a very unusual personal foul during a FG attempt called against an IU defender as he leaped over the line in his attempt to block the kick, giving NU a 1st & goal at the Indy 5. The ‘Cat OL were overpowered at the WhoZit goal line.\n\nMost consequential of all these flaws was NU’s lack of a vertical passing game. I’ve been bemoaning this game plan deficiency throughout the 2008 season predicting that someday, this imposed passing attack restriction by OC Mick McCall would haunt the ‘Cats’ ability to move the ball in crunch time. Well it did just that BIG TIME in this game.\n\nMcCall’s “managed” dink-&-dunk passing attack does have its merits. By the nature of its quick read and fast delivery to the open, short-route target receiver, it limits the necessity of the OL to hold pass blocks for the required 3-4 seconds for the vertical routes to develop, it lets C.J. scan the short secondary quickly to identify the open area in the 3 short zones in the opponent’s secondary, it gets the ball out of C.J.’s hands and delivered towards his target receiver helping minimize the possibility of negative yardage plays - like sacks, and it allows the QB to distribute the ball across many receivers, forcing the opponent’s DBs to respect their coverage responsibilities across all possible targets and not focus on a premier or favorite WR or two. This last item is a major reason why Sutton has been such a successful passing target for C.J. Many of the short zones prowled by Tyrell had been vacated previously of their coverage DB via clearing pass routes run by the wideouts.\n\nHowever, when McCall’s non-existent vertical passing option was recognized, the WhoZit DC shifted the coverage schemes of his secondary primarily to defend against these short passing zones, especially when NU gained the red zone. With the stretch passes into the deep 3rd zones removed by the endline, the WhoZit DBs fronted the ‘Cat WRs and used a bump-&-run technique to eliminate a free release off the LOS. With the WR tied-up at the LOS, McCall’s 2-second timing between Bacher and his wideouts, executing their “managed” pitch-&-catch short-passing attack, unraveled in short order. Holding the bean in hand, waiting for his WR to gain separation from their coverage DBs, Bacher fell victim to the pressure applied by WhoZit’s penetration pass rush. It wasn’t a pretty sight as C.J. passing efficiency plummeted. NU’s was forced into 2 FGs following poor passing attempts coupled with rushes stoned near the LOS within the WhoZit 10 yard line. Worse still, Bacher attempting to pass from the WhoZit 14 and harassed by the unrelenting Indy DL, forced the ball to a well-covered target, resulting in a red-zone INT for his effort.\n\nRed Zone points - squandered or reduced because McCall could not or did not adjust his play calling to counter the defensive stunts and man-to-man coverage schemes the WhoZits had been dumping on his beleaguered O. And Fitz stood-by without intervention. But that’s commentary for another time.\n\nSelf-Inflicted Wounds\n\n“Whoever wins the turnover battle, wins the game.” That maxim rang true in this game against the WhoZits just as it did for the ‘Cats against the Perdue broiler-Chickens the previous weekend, where 5 light and flaky turnovers, baked by the Wildcats and stuffed into the salivating maws of their opponents, provided all the impetus necessary to drop the punch-drunk ‘Cats onto the Palooka-ville canvas. More importantly, it must be noted that in contrast to NU’s generosity for giving-up the bean, it was the WhoZits’ commendable respect for it that became a game-winning difference-maker - if only because, unlike their last 5 games, all losses where turnovers contributed significantly, Indy didn’t bake a single turnover against the ‘Cats.\n\n2 of the ‘Cats’ 5 French pastries proved critical - the first prevented NU from a score, while the second set the table for the WhoZits to take control of the game. 7 valuable points literally were thrown-away when C.J. chucked the pill off his back foot from the Indy 14 while pressured with a hand in his face softly into the hands of a coverage DB who gladly completed the pick ending NU’s bid for a go-ahead TD, as described above. The other turnover occurred in NU territory off a botched handoff by Bacher where, instead of shoving the ball into Tyrell’s midsection, he banged it off Sutton’s shoulder pads. Trying valiantly to re-establish control of the pigskin, Sutton bobbled it from one hand to the other while his momentum carried him forward towards the LOS, then he got blasted by several WhoZit DL who had gained separation from their blockers and converged on the hapless Sutton. Having gobbled-up this powdered-sugar pastry at the NU 37, it took the WhoZit’s 2nd string QB, Ben Chappell, only 3 pass completions and 2 keepers to convert the giftie into a short field TD just before the close of H-1 and re-establish a lead that Indy would not relinquish.\n\nDeath By a Thousand Cuts\n\nUnfortunately for the ‘Cats, they made many little mistakes across all 3 phases of the game that, when compiled together and reviewed as a whole, contributed greatly to the game’s final score.\n\nNU’s special teams woes, particularly on the kickoff coverage team, seemed to carry-over from the Moo U. game to Saturday’s tussle. Following the response TD that put the ‘Cats up 9-7 with 5 minutes left in H-1, WhoZit starting RB, Marcus Thigpen, doubling as KR, grabbed the subsequent Demos kickoff and weaved his way through NU’s kick coverage personnel who had locked horns with Indy blockers for a 24-yard scamper to a launch-point at IU’s 31. Not a devastating goof but a harbinger of things to come. After Amado-matic’s 2nd FG in Q3, Thigpen one-upped his earlier KO return when he took the ensuing kickoff and rambled 53 yards to the ‘Cat 47, effectively blowing by the same kick coverage personnel as they wrestled once again with Indy’s blockers, giving the WhoZits a short field that was the equivalent of turnover by NU in their own territory. 3 positive-yardage plays from Chappell & his O, followed by another successful trickeration play that cashed-in a 3rd improbable TD of the game, inflated the WhoZits’s lead over the ‘Cats to 9 with 20 minutes left in the game.\n\nThen there were several drops of well-delivered passes from C.J. on critical downs which just killed vital response drives. Unbelievable. Add to the mix, many ole’ or “lookout” blocks by various OL personnel, and I mean across the entire line, that gave the WhoZit defensive front 7 an uncontested path into NU’s backfield and a free shot at the ball carrier. Of particular note were blocking assignment gaffes by both ‘Cat OTs, who at game-breaking junctures of what might have been significant possessions leading to much-needed points, just failed to either get off at the snap or maintain substantive contact with their blocking targets. Totally unacceptable. On Chappell’s 3 yard TD jaunt near the end of H-1, a NU defender over-pursued the ball and crossed immediately in front of the WhoZit QB giving him an open lane to the goalline. The right defensive play called, but a missed tackle. Arghhhhhhh!!!\n\nBut worst of all these smaller gaffes was a missed open field tackle against the WhoZit punter who just moments before, avoided a possible game-changing over-the-head punt snap by making a nifty stab & grab of the wayward long snap; then maintaining his composure, he calmly tucked the ball under arm and took-off on what appeared to be an improvised fake punt. As NU’s punt return squad turned away from the LOS and peeled back to their punt return positions, the punter sped behind them with ball in hand. A single member of the ’Cat punt return team, realizing that the punter hadn’t kicked the ball but was sprinting downfield instead, closed quickly, threw his body at the rushing WhoZit and swiped an arm across his chest a full 10 yards before the 1st down marker. This desperation arm tackle was shaken off easily and the punter scrambled a full 17 yards, converting the 1st down before he was pulled down at the NU 43. It was the first major turning point play of the contest, one that allowed a previously stoned drive to continue and set the tone for game rife with other mistakes and miscues to be made by the ‘Cats. As special teams coach, Fitz had to be pulling his hair out by the roots.\n\nBreakdown Palace\n\nHowever, all those smaller gaffes paled in comparison to the 2 key defensive breakdowns in pass coverage that resulted in game-deciding explosion TD plays for the WhoZits. The first was a deep pass attempt immediately following the 1st down conversion off the fake punt described above. Capitalizing on the emotional impact of this improvised play to extend the drive, WhoZit HC, Bill Lynch, went for broke and called for a fly pattern to his speedy WR Damarlo Belcher off play-action. Both coverage safeties for the ‘Cats bit on the fake handoff, coming upfield in run support while Belcher flew past them into open space in the deep middle 3rd zone. For WhoZit QB Chappell, it was an easy pitch-and-catch toss to the streaking Belcher for a gimme TD. In two short plays, the WhoZits swiftly wiped away any negative effects from NU’s overpowering 1st-possession 20-play drive that had stalled just moments before in the shadow of IU’s endzone. Clearly, the WhoZits re-captured game momentum from the dominant ‘Cats.\n\nThe second major defensive breakdown came on the heels of Thigpen’s 53 yard KO return to NU’s 47 immediately after the ‘Cats had reduced their deficit to 2 points. It wasn’t difficult to see that the ’Cats were still reeling from the shock of this KO return as their D gave-up 19 yards on IU’s next 3 plays, allowing the WhoZits to drive the ball down to NU’s 28 with relative ease. Once again, Indy’s HC called for an explosion play to capitalize on the impact of the shock and awe of these last few downs. A deep vertical pass attempt off a reverse by IU WR Mitchell Evans, saw his teammate, WR Tandon Doss, originally set wide right, drive his initial zone-coverage CB 10 yards off the LOS then run an inside post route to the deep middle 3rd zone in the ‘Cats’ secondary. At this point, the ‘Cat CB released Doss to the cover of his SS teammate responsible for this deep middle zone, who was very slow to react to this standard coverage exchange. Recognizing the exchange, Doss cut back outside, away from his post route, to a flag route into the open space in NU’s deep outer 3rd zone, free and clear of this sleep-walking coverage SS. Evans completed his own simple pitch-and-catch heave to the wide-open Doss for IU’s 3rd and last gimme TD of the afternoon. The WhoZit sidelines went bananas at this well-executed trickeration.\n\n2 blown pass coverages… 2 easy IU TDs, each answering a previous score by NU to re-capture the lead.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll these self-induced circumstances and more conspired against the ‘Cats. Most influential was OC McCall’s debilitating refusal to dial-up any vertical pass plays to loosen-up a WhoZit secondary intentionally set 7 yards off the LOS in obvious “run-support first” mode. That Fitz didn’t intervene to regain control of the unraveling offensive situation before him is equally disturbing. Add to the mix, the numerous blown blocking assignments by the ‘Cat OL that just killed plays in NU’s backfield, many before they ever had a chance to start. The 5 turnovers certainly eliminated opportunities for the ‘Cats to garner points and recapture game momentum. And last by not least, those 2 damn blown deep pass coverages. Without those 2 explosion plays, the WhoZits O doesn’t have a chance. But that sentiment is all shoulda, woulda, coulda drivel. Simply stated NU threw-in a clunker and got beaten by a Twinkie.\n\nHowever, most important are the lasting effects of the game. Tyrell Sutton, NU’s best-ever all-purpose playmaker, is gone for remainder of the season and possibly beyond with required wrist surgery in his immediate future. C.J. Bacher seriously injured his hamstring in his final effort to drive the ‘Cats into position for a game-saving, go-ahead FG. He is definitely on the PUP list and out for next weekend’s game against the Golden Rodents at a minimum. In his stead, Fitz and McCall will call-upon little-used 2nd string QBMike Kafka, who showed nothing less than pure ineptitude in his only offensive series at the helm of NU’s offense at the final 2 minutes of the WhoZit game. I shudder at the thought of Kafka’s attempts to master Mick McCall’s complex “managed” offense with only a week’s preparation time in the starting QB role, especially the nuances of the OC’s quick-read-n-throw passing game. I still recall the brutally failed Brew-Kafka experiment from 2 season’s past.\n\nOh man, I’m having difficulty in flushing this one.\n\nThe Waterboy\n\nOctober 22, 2008\n\nResponse – Part Deux\n\nQ1 for the ‘Cats was not one of their more noteworthy of the 2008 campaign. In fact, it was downright depressing. I watched dumbfounded while an allegedly challenged Broiler-Chicken O took their 2nd possession of the contest at their own 20 then proceeded to carved-up the ‘Cat D for consistent yardage production both on the ground and through the air. Perdue’s high quality RB, Kory Sheets, eerily resembled I-Away’s Shonn Greene as he slashed through NU’s defensive front 7 with virtual impunity. Meanwhile, QB Chris Painter, resurrecting his playmaking skills that had laid dormant over his last 2 games, seemed to have read through the “managed” game plan of NU OC Mick McCall, as he adeptly completed a series of dink-n-dunk passes to drive the Broiler-Chickens methodically down to NU’s 3. Thankfully, NU’s D quelled the bloodletting at the hands of the Sheets-Painter Show and forced HC Joe Tiller to settle for a FG instead of the expected TD.\n\nI thought to myself, “OK, I’ll permit the Broilers a ‘kiss your sister’ first-strike FG, now for the ‘Cat O to go to work against the worst defense in the Big 10/11 conference.” And on the following offensive series, NU did just that – with Sutton rushing 4 times for 24 hard-fought yards and Bacher adding an 11 yard dump-off pass to Ebert that pushed the ball to the PU 27 with relative ease… then ka-BOOM, C.J. had his own brain fart on his 3rd pass attempt of the possession. Focusing totally on his TE receiving target running a short delayed crossing route, Bacher failed to recognize that a 300 lb DT, executing a zone blitz stunt, had retreated 3 yards off the LOS into this exact passing lane, and oblivious to the obstruction, soft-tossed the bean straight into the midsection of this lumbering behemoth. More surprised than anything else that the ball struck him amidships, the Perdue DL swallowed the pigskin whole and fell forward to complete an improbable INT. Capitalizing on this momentum reversal, Painter weaved his passing magic and drove the PU O to the ‘Cats’ 20, only to stall once more. Another chippie Broiler-Chicken FG conversion threw the ‘Cats down a 6-point hole.\n\nOh no… it’s Moo U. deja vu all over again.\n\nThen suddenly, something remarkable occurred. The ‘Cat offense, following the mantra of their HC, “flushed” this turnover, as well everything else that occurred in Q1, and responded. Simply stated, the entire team, to an individual, took a firm hold of what they could control: their own field play. On the ensuing kick-off, ‘Cat KR Simmons grabbed the ball at the NU 8 and streaked downfield through the porous Broiler-Chicken kick coverage for a 32-yard return, giving NU’s O good starting field position at their 40. Following a swift 11-yard completion, Bacher made the 1st of several offensive explosion plays when he connected on a short pitch-and-catch hook route to Eric Peterman sitting between the hash marks at the PU 45, who responded in his own right by shaking-off a vicious body shot from a Broiler-Chicken free safety with a nifty spin move, and, finding himself in open space, sprinting hard downfield to paydirt, outdistancing 2 more DBs just as he crossed the Perdue goal line. After having sleep-walked through the first 15 minutes of the game and spotted their opponents a 6-point lead, the ‘Cats answered that challenge with a lightning-quick, go-ahead TD, all in the space of 92 seconds. From that point on, the flood gates opened and the route was on.\n\nFitz was absolutely spot on… It’s all about how you respond.\n\nHow the ‘Cats Plucked the Broiler-Chickens\n\nThe Tsunami\n\nA 24-point Q2… unbelievable. And it didn’t end there. The ‘Cats repeated that prolific point production in H-2. It’s difficult to describe. Once that initial TD was scored, something apparently snapped in the collective psyche of the ‘Cat offense. The squad rose-up in unison and became an overwhelming, irresistible force, effectively and efficiently moving the ball and scoring almost at will.\n\nThis offense tsunami fed off everything – turnovers and short fields provided by the ‘Cat D, scoring drives by Perdue, even a trickeration play. The Wildcat Nation knew that, with all the maturity and experience across its skill positions, NU’s O possessed huge potential to generate points in this manner; however, having waited patiently over half the 2008 season for its debut, most everyone was a bit incredulous when it was unveiled at long last.\n\nOL’ Reliable\n\nOne common characteristic within every NU possession from this game was the high-level blocking exhibition put on by the ‘Cat OL. Although there was the occasional technique breakdown, leading to a sack or TFL, they were dominant. At this juncture in the season, there are no freshmen on the 2-deep position chart, only sophomore players or older, and each individual’s “growth through experience” has been displayed very well. Consequently, the frequency rate for successful block techniques should be expected. And this squad continues to jell into a cohesive unit of 6-7 interchangeable parts according to position as the season has progressed. Every ball handler operating in the NU backfield has become increasingly reliant upon this OL’s ability to engage their blocking assignments, maintain contact and finish the play. Big time accolades to Coach Ingalls on this one.\n\nEquation for Victory\n\nFrench pastry + Short Green = Easy Points. Simple, factual, undeniable. To paraphrase Fitz from his post-game interview, “The team that wins the turnover battle usually wins the game.” Throw-in another key ingredient, Long Return, to the left side of the equation, and value of the Easy Points resultant has greater tendency to rise like leavened dough - from 3 to 7. NU repeated this formula on five “popin’ fresh” occasions from Q2 onwards. Now the ‘Cats know how Moo U. must have felt as grateful recipients of NU’s 3 light and flaky creations during the previous Saturday’s proceedings. And… they’re tasty too.\n\nThe Peterman Effect\n\nEric Peterman had a highlight reel offensive day against the Broiler-Chickens as a primary contributor in NU’s first 2 TDs, firmly re-setting the ‘Cats’ momentum train back on track and moving forward with a full head of stream after having endured a limp Q1. Not only did he convert THE catch-n-score pass completion of the 2008 season; he reprised his role as playmaking high school QB when he heaved a classic “dying quail” flutter-ball to a wide-open Sid Stewart off a trickeration flea-flicker reverse option pass – both plays executed a mere 2 minutes & 59 seconds apart. To celebrate, campus publications and the Rivals message board christened Eric’s virtuoso performance as “The Peterman Effect.” The impact of these 2 plays was so profound and invigorating to the entire NU team that, in a post-game interview, Tyrell Sutton was quoted as having offered Mr. Peterman his position at RB to provide him yet another opportunity to score a TD by rushing because… “Well, he had scored doing everything else.” I couldn’t agree more.\n\n“All Day” C.J.\n\nThis season, Turk coined this nickname for Mr. Bacher, and owning to his superlative performance against the Broiler-Chickens last weekend, it is nothing less than a stone cold fit. I made a mental note to myself after viewing NU’s 1st possession of the game, where C.J. had completed 5-of-6 pass attempts averaging 7 yards a pop and moved the ball into Perdue territory in short order, that this could be special afternoon for the senior QB. This initial impression was muddied quite a bit when Bacher, experiencing his aforementioned flatulent mental moment, delivered his pick-o-the-day into the sweaty midsection of that Broiler DL on NU’s 2nd possession. Undaunted by this glaring gaffe, C.J. demonstrated resiliency and pluck, bolstered by a conveniently non-existent short-term memory, when he responded to Perdue’s 2nd FG in Q1 off this French pastry on NU’s very next series by delivering the bean deftly into the hungry hands of Mr. Peterman who spun on his heel and was off to the races for his momentum-shifting 1st TD. From that point forward, C.J. was calm and collected for the remainder of the contest, regardless of whether his passes were on target or off. Final game stats underscore the fact that C.J was indeed on his game: 22 completions on 33 attempts, for a modest 220 yards and 3 TDs, a yardage total lessened significantly by the fact that many of NU’s possessions were of the short green variety.\n\nI’ll take this “All Day” version of C.J. every day.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn only their 7th game of the 2008 season, NU attained the much anticipated post-season bowl eligibility by beating what has become a conference Twinkie with ease. This feat was more fulfilling expectation rather than accomplishment. After all, Joe Tiller’s Broiler-Chickens field the worst defense by far in the Big 10/11, a dubious distinction considered by many to be the exclusive property of the ‘Cats, especially throughout the disastrous defensive regime of former DC, Greg “Behold the Power of Swiss Cheese” Colby. Hopefully, win-loss records from this season and last have begun to dispel much of that negative preconception among the casual collegiate football fan.\n\nNext on the ‘Cats’ “to do” list: solidify an upper tier position within the Big 10/11’s pecking order for scheduled bowl bids by showing continued improvement in their overall gridiron field play against their next conference opponent, the WhoZIts of Indy. Similar to the Broiler-Chickens, the WhoZits harbored powerful pre-season aspirations for a break-out 2008 campaign, all of which have been dashed severely after a major injury eliminated their all-everything QB, Kellen “Don’t call me Winslow” Lewis, from their roster in recent weeks. The ‘Cats will face this wounded, underachieving foe in a grapple having all the earmarks of a trap game against a team looking for any kind of redemption in a season of heavy disappointment.\n\nHaving bought-into Fitz’ concept of entering this weekend’s contest mentally bearing a 0-0 record, I have complete confidence in a motivated, focused ‘Cat football squad to haul their 3rd conference “W” back from Bloomington. I also hope that OB Mick McCall seizes this opportunity to exercise more liberal use of the vertical pass into his game plan. The WhoZits are the last weak sister among NU’s remaining slate of 2008 opponents, and the last chance to implement a more refined downfield passing attack this Saturday. Doing so now will pay dividends in upcoming weeks when the ‘Cats face-off against the toughest, most challenging segment within this fall’s schedule, where a vertical passing option is an absolute necessity.\n\nThe Waterboy\n\nOctober 14, 2008\n\nA Definitive Difference\n\nLast Saturday, NU met a team in the Moo U. Green Meanies that could be considered its mirror image. In fact , the many similarities between either team are so striking that one could say that they are virtually interchangeable. Like the Wildcats, Moo U. possesses a high quality RB who can control whole portions of a game rushing behind an enormous, very effective OL; a good, serviceable QB who, when on his game, can deliver the bean to his target receivers with consistency, accuracy and pace, even when those receivers are well covered; an experienced, hard-hitting defensive front 7 who can stone an opponent’s ground game with regularity; and a defensive secondary that is poised and focused in their pass coverage schemes and can close on their coverage targets with quickness and bring heavy lumber. And last but certainly not least, Moo U. has a new, bright, dynamic, charismatic and motivating HC who demands and gets the most energetic, competitive and error-free field play he can muster out of his players – especially at the critical junctures of the contest at hand. All these factors were put on full display, in front of 35K enthusiastic fans, on the green gridiron of Dyche’s Ditch as the ‘Cats met what was the best overall football team of their 2008 pigskin campaign to date.\n\nHowever,with those positives having been said, that’s where the similarities between both teams ended – on paper. The distinct difference between the ‘Cats and Moo U., at least as was shown last Saturday, was in execution. Simply stated, Moo U. executed well when they needed to, and the Wildcats did not. It’s not to say that the ‘Cats sucked eggs and threw-in a clunker performance. But the entire team, starting first with special teams, then progressing to the offense, then transitioning to the defense, and finally and most notably moving on to the coaching staff, failed to execute at critical times and in major ways at various points of the contest. Each squad, in its own right, contributed to the overall failure of the team to garner control of the game and subsequently secure a “W” against a very well-coached, highly disciplined Moo U football squad.\n\nMind you, the ‘Cats were competitive, and for the most part, acquitted themselves relatively well, as the final game stats bear-out. The ‘Cat O moved the ball gamely between the 20 yards lines, with “Streak” Sutton gaining a respectable 142 yards on 23 carries, while C.J. completed 60% of his passes for another 280-plus yards. Not bad. NU’s D defense dominated the LOS on occasion, corralling Moo U.’s formidable RB, Javon Ringer, relatively well for a mere 127 total rushing yards, 50 yards under his 2008 average, while the ‘Cat secondary kept MSU’s QB, Brian Hoyer, to a modest 169 yard passing day. Again, all very commendable. Statistically, the ‘Cats outplayed Moo U. - running 93 plays to MSU’s 63; outgaining the Green Meanies in total yards 459 to 297, and converting 27 first downs to MSU’s 18. But those statistics belie a basic underlying fact: when game control and momentum were clearly on the line, the ‘Cats failed to finish plays and were limited in what they were able to run by their Moo U. counterparts. There was no getting around the fact that Moo U. HC, Mark Dantonio and his troops knocked the ‘Cats to the turf from the game’s opening whistle and kept them down for the rest of the game.\n\nMy biggest regret of the game was that this failure to deliver was broadcast, once again, in front of another national TV audience, revealing that the 2008 ‘Cats are still a work in progress, and have far to go before they achieve the consistent results expected from an upper echelon football program of the Big 10/11 conference.\n\nHow Moo U. Neutralized the ‘Cats\n\nStumbling Out of the Gate\n\nThe first 13 minutes of the game was an absolute train wreck for NU’s special teams, where Moo U. got field position in NU territory and kept the ball within the ‘Cats’ half of the field of play for most of Q1. On the opening kick-off, NU’s coverage personnel failed to wrap-up the Moo U. kick returner, who found a viable seam in the converging ‘Cat coverage team, blasted through weak-sister arm tackles and rumbled to midfield. Following an exchange of 3-and-out possessions by both teams, NU kicked a nice 47 yard punt, but the kick coverage squad failed again, and MSU’s PR slashed his way to the NU 42; after which, behind quality blocking by their OL, Moo U.’s offensive tandem of Hoyer and Ringer mixed their ground-n-pound rushing game with pin-point passing, methodically cranking-out yardage to score Moo U.’s first TD in less than 3 minutes.\n\nOn the ensuing kickoff, NU’s Sherrick McManus, reprising his role as NU’s kick returner for the first time since NU’s opening game in 2008, ran the ball back to the NU 25, where he got blasted by a host of MSU’s coverage team personnel and fumbled the ball back to Moo U. On this short-field possession, NU’s D stiffened at their 5 yard line, exchanging a FG instead of handing the Green Meanine O another easy TD. After only 9 minutes, Cats were down by 10.\n\nMcManus’ KR foibles continued on the subsequent kick-off, where he tracked the well-struck line-drive, knuckle-ball to himself at the NU 5, then bobbled the bouncing pigskin once, twice and finally grabbed it just as he was overwhelmed by Moo U.’s cover men for no gain. On this possession’s 5th play, NU’s QB, C.J. Bacher rolled-out to the east sideline under heavy pressure by MSU’s pass rush, then tossed the bean across his body, floating it up for grabs, where, in response, MSU’s free safety Dan Fortener broke-off from his coverage target, made the pick at the MSU 45 and sprinted upfield to NU’s 34. 93 seconds and 4 consecutive Ringer rushes later, Moo U. scored their 2nd TD, increasing NU’s self-inflicted deficit to 17-0. The purple-clad partisans watching this unraveling unfold were shell-shocked and speechless.\n\nMicro-Man"
