        "text": "Sometimes (always?), things don't go as planned. I wanted my next blog post to be about my new perspective on community events and how they can provide the most value to the developer community, but I needed to separate that topic from my experience attending the Jacksonville code camp. I wrote a post telling the tale of my trip to Jacksonville and the frustration I experienced there in order to keep the two issues discrete. One would be a stepping stone to the other. At least, that's how I meant for things to play out.\n\nIt turns out that in my rush to get out the first post, I did not take the time and care necessary to communicate with clarity and accuracy. I wrote the post, spellchecked it and re-read it. It said what I wanted to say, so I published it. It did not, however, say what I wanted people to hear. That is, I did not read the post from the point of view of readers unfamiliar with the events described, which turned out to be everyone but me.\n\nUpon posting, I immediately got feedback that indicated that I had failed in my intentions. In fact, the feedback on my previous post has been universally negative. When everyone tells me I'm wrong, I'm willing to consider the possibility.\n\nHonestly, I violated the directive given to me by my friend Jeff McWherter which is: \"Dude, don't be a dick.\" And so, I am sorry for being a dick. I am not angry with anyone associated with the Jacksonville Code Camp. At this point, I'm only angry with myself for confusing the issues.\n\nAs I stated in my final email, I was coming to Jacksonville no matter the status of the Community Courtyard. My wife and I planned to stay with friends, and we were going to visit with them whether or not I attended the code camp. Ultimately, I left JaxCC at lunch and spent the rest of that Saturday in St. Augustine having a wonderful time.\n\nMy point all along has been to tell the tale of how this experience shocked, frustrated and disappointed me to the point that I stepped outside my normal frame of observation and began to see things from a different and larger perspective. What has been most frustrating to me this week is that I created drama, through my own incompetence, which distracted from and delayed that discussion.\n\nNamaste,\n\n++Alan\n\nBeing dissed at the Jacksonville Code Camp (JaxCC) last weekend was the best thing that could have happened to me. I had to ask myself what I was doing and what I hoped would result from my actions. The result: I've decided to find something better to do with my time, energy and money. More on that at another time.\n\nHere's what happened. I drove 8+ hours to facilitate a Community Courtyard at JaxCC. I've hosted Community Courtyards successfully at other Code Camps this year, and I've never made it to a Florida event before. It seemed like a good opportunity to meet some new folks and engage a broader audience.\n\nHere's the problem, after I committed to hosting a Community Courtyard at the Jacksonville event, I started a new job that requires me to be out of town for two weeks at a stretch for the first 90 days. JaxCC fell at the end of one of those two week trips.\n\nI've seen people bail on their talks the day of the talk, when they were already at the event. I've had speakers bail on me the day of a user group meeting and I've had people just not show up. Whenever possible, I follow through on my commitments.\n\nThe last time I bailed on a talk I had just flown in on a red eye (it was another case of satisfying a pre-existing commitment). I had two talks scheduled and I asked to do only the second one, so that I could get a nap and at least give one decent talk. My friend Michael Neel filled in for me in the open slot.\n\nI've worked with lots of terrific event organizers. I'm pleased that many of them have become personal friends. I do not commit to participate in an event lightly because I know that organizers will count on my presence, in part, for the success of their event.\n\nSo the scene is me returning to Knoxville Thursday night after two weeks away without seeing my wife or kids. Early Friday morning, my wife and I hit the road for Jacksonville as planned. I did not have time to see my kids before leaving.\n\nSaturday morning, I was on site bright and early to check in and get my space organized. I was not on the speaker list. Nobody knew who I was. I asked to speak with an organizer and I was directed to one of two speaker coordinators. After introductions, he said \"I got an email from you.\"\n\nHe was referring to the email I sent as I left Knoxville asking for confirmation that they were still expecting me. He did not respond, although he admitted seeing it. Nor did anyone else from the JaxCC respond to my request for confirmation. I copied two other Florida contacts on the email, Sean Chambers and Joe Healy, and both responded to me.\n\nIn the end, there was no Community Courtyard at JaxCC, and I traveled 1400+ miles round trip seemingly for nothing. I was furious. I felt like a victim. I blamed the organizers for being disrespectful and disorganized. But in the end, I had to take full responsibility for my situation. When I did, I saw things differently.\n\nAs of now, Monday evening two days after the event, I have received no word of apology. I should have seen the signs. When I initially contacted the organizers using the email address on the JaxCC website, I got no response. I contacted Sean Chambers to put me in touch with the organizers, which he did. The entire email thread is copied below.\n\nOpen Space/Community Courtyard at Jax Code Camp\n\nSean Chambers - Wed, Jun 3, 2009 at 10:03 AM\n\nTo: Eugene Chuvyrov , Bayer White\n\nCc: Alan Stevens\n\nHey Eugene & Bayer\n\nI passed along both of your e-mails to Alan Stevens. He is interested in discussing the possibility of him doing an open space within the jax code camp. I also cc'd him on this e-mail.\n\nJust giving you the heads up.\n\nSean\n\nBayer White - Fri, Jun 19, 2009 at 6:49 PM\n\nTo: Sean Chambers , Eugene Chuvyrov\n\nCc: Alan Stevens\n\nThanks Sean,\n\nEmail has been crazy\n\nAlan Stevens - Thu, Jun 25, 2009 at 3:05 PM\n\nTo: Bayer White\n\nCc: Sean Chambers , Eugene Chuvyrov , Joe Healy\n\nHi All,\n\nI'd like to come down for the Jax Code Camp. I can submit talks if necessary, but lately I've been getting good feedback on hosting a Community Courtyard at Code Camps in Atlanta and Richmond. I'd like to host a CC at the Jax event if possible. This will require a space all day and an opportunity to explain the space at the opening keynote. A dedicated room is great, but at Atlanta we just had a conversation area off the cafeteria and that worked fine.\n\nPlease ping me back with any questions and feel free to contact Jim Wooley in Atlanta and Andrew Leonard in Richmond on what value they saw in having a CC to their events.\n\nBTW, I added Healy to this thread because if nothing else, he can confirm that I make a good drinking companion.\n\n++Alan\n\nJoe Healy - Thu, Jun 25, 2009 at 3:30 PM\n\nTo: Alan Stevens , Bayer White\n\nCc: Sean Chambers , Eugene Chuvyrov , Kevin Randall\n\ngmail? I donât know anyone who uses gmail....\n\nOn a positive note, Alan can pull off a openspace deal if ya'll want to gun it. And he can drink beer on a \"kevin randall\" level.\n\nSounds like a good value add to me.\n\nBayer White - Sat, Jun 27, 2009 at 10:36 AM\n\nTo: Joe Healy, Alan Stevens\n\nCc: Sean Chambers, Eugene Chuvyrov, Kevin Randall\n\nI am game Alan and I think we can accommodate! I need to work out the space as we are trying to get more based on the number of speakers that have shown interest. Can you let me know the details?\n\n-Bayer\n\nAlan Stevens - Fri, Jul 17, 2009 at 4:01 PM\n\nTo: Bayer White\n\nCc: Joe Healy, Sean Chambers, Eugene Chuvyrov, Kevin Randall\n\nSorry this thread got deferred for a while. I've been wrangling a new gig that starts Monday.\n\nA Community Courtyard would ideally replace a speakers lounge. It is a place for people to gather and discuss topics of their own choosing. It is entirely appropriate to have a projector in the room for people to share code.\n\nA CC is a great place for speakers to invite their audience to join them for further discussion after their talks. I typically make an announcement before the keynote, or during the opening gathering. I like to talk to speakers directly about the CC at the speaker's dinner if their is one, but I can email the speakers list if you have one.\n\nI only require a space typically a room, but a conversation nook, or a hallway with chairs will work too. I start the day by having people suggest topics and we build a backlog of topics that is added to throughout the day. People can schedule a topic during a given time slot if they like. I also ask the group at the beginning of each time slot what they want to talk about and we break up into groups around the chosen topics.\n\nThis differs from an open space in that there is no open or closing and I am an active participant. My role is to act as a catalyst for discussion and sharing. I try to keep people engaged and occasionally I push peoples buttons to make them react. I'm happy to be the devils advocate on any topic.\n\nI encourage people to share code as the highest fidelity way for developers to communicate, and these exchanges are often the most satisfying. I'm stoked about the opportunity to engage the FL community. Thanks for letting me do this.\n\nCheers,\n\n++Alan\n\nAlan Stevens - Fri, Aug 28, 2009 at 8:50 AM\n\nTo: Bayer White\n\nCc: Joe Healy, Sean Chambers, Eugene Chuvyrov, Kevin Randall\n\nHi All!\n\nI'm about to embark on an eight hour road trip to Jacksonville. I just want to confirm that you guys still want to do a CC. Do you have a space set aside? I'll be there either way.\n\nCheers,\n\n++Alan\n\nJoe Healy - Fri, Aug 28, 2009 at 9:38 AM\n\nTo: Alan Stevens, Bayer White\n\nCc: Sean Chambers, Eugene Chuvyrov, Kevin Randall\n\nCall me on cell when you get in. Cell is below. Looking fwd to some beers. I'm here now, pickup up Kabza around 100p. Prob be at orange park poker room until party time (if I get my work done).\n\nAs is tradition, Jacksonville is doing its best to draw in a hurricane for codecamp, but it looks like they won't succeed this time!\n\nSean Chambers - Fri, Aug 28, 2009 at 7:26 PM\n\nTo: Alan Stevens\n\nDid you ever hear back from them? Did you make it to jax?\n\nWas I too trusting? Should I have followed up sooner? Of course! This experience has only served to confirm what I knew already; that Iâve worked with some fantastic event organizers in the developer community. These folks just werenât among that esteemed group.\n\nA Course In Miracles teaches that to see differently is the definition of a miracle. I am grateful for the gift I received. I will make improvements in my life as a result. I am still organizing my thoughts on the new perspectives this experience spawned and I hope to share them here soon.\n\nCiao,\n\n++Alan\n\nFor the last week, I've been listening to Al Green and attempting to grok the ASP.NET MVC Framework in fullness. I have not been looking for a job. You see, on Monday of last week I had a three hour dinner with a hiring manager which ended with us agreeing to work together.\n\nBecause I have been around the block before, I did not crow from on high that I had found a job. Nothing is real until it is written up and signed by all parties. I know this, but NuSoft Solutions had been very forthcoming with me, to date. Prior to our dinner, this hiring manager had met with his superiors to confirm that my travel needs were acceptable. He called me to confirm that we were all on the same page regarding travel before scheduling our dinner meeting.\n\nThis morning, eight days after our meeting, I received word from my HR contact that I would not be hired. When I asked the reason, I was told that my travel costs would be too much. I find this scenario totally unprofessional, disrespectful to me and my family, and thoroughly unacceptable.\n\nI am disappointed this morning, not just because I'm unemployed, but because this opportunity was such a good fit for me. I want, most of all, for my next position to be a good opportunity for my employer as well as for me. I know that I would have made very positive contributions to this organization, while working on a personally satisfying variety of solutions and technologies.\n\nI will not slander NuSoft Solutions, but if any of my contacts in the developer community ask me about the company I will relate my experience and have them draw their own conclusions.\n\nWith all that said, I am still looking for a challenging and fulfilling new opportunity. Please have a look at my resume and contact me if you know of any appropriate opportunities. Finally, if you are reading this because you are considering me as a job candidate, please perform thorough due diligence before offering me a position.\n\nCheers,\n\n++Alan\n\nYesterday, I responded to some requests for connections on LinkedIn. I'm terribly lazy about this. Both of these invites had languished in my inbox for over a week.\n\nOnce I logged into my account and accepted the invites, I began looking around for evidence of value. I had a few connections with co-workers and people in the .NET community, but I couldn't see what good it had done me.\n\nI added a link to my LinkedIn profile to this blog a while back during my blog renovations. That allowed one person I met at Tech Ed to get in touch with me. Because of that, I decided there may be value in this service.\n\nI began searching all the connections of my connections, that I knew, and inviting them to connect directly to me. I dug around for email address online of people I didn't have in my address book. I added my address books from Outlook and Gmail, and invited anyone I thought might be interested.\n\nOn a roll, I installed the Outlook plugin for LinkedIn and had it search my archived mail for contacts. I have to admit that this became addictive. I would send a batch of invites, and wait for email confirming that people had accepted. I drooled like one of Pavlov's dogs every time I saw the blue toast in the corner of my screen.\n\nThis went on well into the evening. I was very happy to get an email response from an old friend whom I hadn't seen in a few years. We caught up. I learned that he was in Memphis and engaged, while he learned about my marriage. This was a very pleasant exchange, and one that I could have initiated with a simple email, but it resulted from inviting him to join my network.\n\nThis morning I moved on to collected business cards. I was pretty bold by this point and I invited people whom I had barely been introduced to. This surprised one person who asked how I got his email address! I explained that I had interviewed for a job with him two years ago, and wanted to connect with him because he supervised many developers who might be interested in our user group. He was pleased with this, and accepted the invitation. He also asked me to send him information about the user group meetings, so he could distribute it to his employees. Now, I was seeing some value.\n\nI believe the best proof of value came when I connected with another user group leader I met at Tech Ed. He responded to my invite by asking me to speak it their \"Day of .NET\" in November. That was definitely a valuable connection. Again, it was a circumstance that I could have initiated through simple email, but it happened by connecting on LinkedIn.\n\nI still have a couple dozen invites pending. I'm considering inviting all the regular attendees of the user group, so we can build a network for ETNUG on LinkedIn. I'm also adding my LinkedIn profile to my email signature. I'll report back in a month or so to let you know if any of this was worthwhile. My fear is that LinkedIn is just another friendster dressed up to be appealing to us \"professionals\".\n\nWe shall see,\n\n++Alan\n\nTuesday started with a good conversation with a member of the SQL Server Replication Services team over breakfast. I love sitting down at a table with someone in a blue Microsoft shirt and asking what they work on.\n\nI was too late to bother with the first session of the day, so I headed over to the Hands on Labs. I started a session on the new Acropolis application framework. This was a totally new technology to me, so I spent most my time reading the manual. I saved my partial session for later resumption.\n\nThere were lots of great sessions to choose from, but I settled on Joel Semeniuk's \"Best Practices for Team-Based Software Development.\" Joel is an excellent speaker with lots of great insight to share on this topic. The room was packed, and I sat on the floor, but it was worth it. I'll be sharing the slides from this session as soon as I return to the office.\n\nI grabbed my lunch in a take-out box, and headed to a Birds of a Feather sessions called \"Exiting the Zone of Pain: Static Analysis with NDepend.\" This was an interesting discussion on a topic I was familiar with, code profiling metrics, and a tool I was not familiar with.\n\nIt was during this lunch session that I bumped into Cam Soper for, at least, the fourth time. It's obvious that Cam has excellent taste in parties and sessions. This time, we finally exchanged business cards.\n\nI tried to attend Joel's interactive discussion after lunch, but it was packed again. My Acropolis session from the morning took too long to resume, so I took the opportunity to work on a Hands On Lab on WPF. I completed a couple of exercises, and enjoyed getting more familiar with the new GUI coding model. I'll do more later.\n\nFor my last session, I attended \"Developing Data Driven Applications Using the New Dynamic Data Controls in ASP.NET\", but I left just as it got started to deal with a weird technical difficulty. I'll find out more about these new controls later. They look very interesting.\n\nShortly after lunch, I ran into Ken Levy, who has changed teams once again. He is now doing community development for Visual Studio extensibility. I promised to stop by later in the week to show him some extensibility I've been doing to bring VS features into VFP, and get his feedback.\n\nIn thinking about doing this demo, I realized that I didn't have the Team Foundation Server client installed on my laptop. While I was sitting in afternoon sessions, I downloaded the client from Codeplex, and grabbed an ISO extractor from a Google search. I extracted the image and tried to install, but I kept running into missing files. I downloaded the 180 trial of TFS and performed the same routine with similar results.\n\nAfter fighting the issue for half an hour, I realized that the people who wrote the installer were standing 50 feet away. I went over and asked for help, and received lots of it. In the end, it was Chris Menegay who determined that the ISO extractor I used, WinISO, was chocking on path lengths over a certain point, and couldn't even read the files to extract them.\n\nI felt humbled, but grateful to get back on track. When I got back to my room, later that night, I downloaded WinRar, extracted and installed without problems. Moral: don't download unknown software you find on Google.\n\nOnce Chris identified my problem, he and I headed off to meet up with the rest of the Central Region group for our party. Drew Robbins put together a cool event at the Skyventure Orlando indoor skydiving attraction. I had never done anything like this before, and it was a blast. I couldn't stop grinning.\n\nWhat will tomorrow bring?\n\n++Alan\n\nDay 1 started well. I realized I could drive to a nearby hotel to park, and then ride the bus to the Convention Center. Once onsite, I ran into a fellow Knoxvillian and ETNUG member at breakfast. I did my best to recruit him for the \"Best of Tech Ed\" session at our June meeting.\n\nAfter checking email and blogging a bit, I attended a session called \"A Lap Around Visual Studio Orcas.\" Unfortunately, the presenter's VPC was locked when he tried to do his first demo. I've seen the presenter before, and he is awesome, but I'm tired of watching people fight VPC on stage, so I left.\n\nI went down to the cabanas, or whatever they're calling them this year, to talk to some Microsoft people. I stopped at the dynamic languages kiosk to find out about the future of tool support in VS for dynamic languages. I explained to the two members of the team present, about the development style in VFP. During the conversation, Mahesh Prakriya, the PM for dynamic languages, joined us.\n\nI asked Mahesh if he knew any members of the VFP team, and he happily reported that he was friends with Alan Griver from his time on the SQL Server team. We went on to discuss the role that iterative execution plays in development with dynamic languages. Mahesh used the example of Query Analyzer as a tool that supports dynamic execution. While he couldn't make any promises, he said his confidence was high that Visual Studio would support a dynamic execution model in the VBx time frame.\n\nI went on to chat with Chris Menegay about the challenges of convincing managers to adopt best practices when using Team Foundation Server. While we were talking, I was introduce to Juan Perez. Juan is a very friendly guy, and I thanked him for producing TeamLook, which allows users to access TFS from within Outlook.\n\nOnce the vendor area was open, I stopped by to see Eric Sink. I just wanted to say \"Hi\", but I ended up discussing the DiffMerge tool that SourceGear produces. I am very dissatisfied with the diff tool that ships with Team Explorer, so I asked how much SourceGear's tool costs. It turns out that this tool is fee, and they've just released a new version. Eric asked me to try it out and email him with my impressions. Turns out, he blogged about it in detail yesterday.\n\nI lingered too long at lunch, so I missed Don's session on extending VS. Instead I wandered over to the Hands On Labs, to see what I've been missing the past two years. I found the labs easy to use, but there were some technical difficulties. I chose a lab on using LINQ. I completed the first exercise successfully, but the second exercise required connecting to the Northwind database, and I couldn't find it. The instructor verified that it was not installed, and sought assistance. Apparently, that is a flaw in their VPC image, and I won't be able to perform that exercise. While this was disappointing, I enjoyed the first exercise, so I'll probably try some other labs this week.\n\nNext I attended a session titled \"A Lap Around Windows Presentation Foundation.\" I've seen a few WPF overviews, but it is still a foreign technology to me. I was fairly bored until the presenter demonstrated this. I work on logistics applications, and this animation was the first example I've seen where WPF could add dramatically to our applications. I left the session early to IM my coworkers about this cool discovery. I'll try some of the WPF Hands On Labs before I leave, so I can understand better how to produce such exciting data visualizations.\n\nMy final session of Day 1 was on the Entity Data Model. I've read some about this, but I never understood where it fit with LINQ. My understanding today, is that EDM is an ORM technology that will ship as part of ADO.NET. This means that I can use stock ADO, and still manage my data without using datasets. This is good news indeed! Once the objects are in memory, LINQ can be used to query against the model. This is good stuff, and I'll be exploring it further during the week.\n\nDuring the EDM session I heard a quote that was new to me, but the message was familiar. \"Normalize 'til it hurts. Denormalize 'til it works.\" Perhaps this could be restated that in practice, theory is only theoretical.\n\nThe evening ended with a reception in the vendor area with free food and \"beverages.\" Here's Geff getting his fair share.\n\nI filled my bag with swag, ate and drank my fill, then headed home to collapse and rest up for Day 2.\n\nCheers,\n\n++Alan\n\nRain this morning. I hope this clears up before the concert at Fenway tonight. I'm jazzed about seeing Train perform.\n\nYesterday afternoon was increadably productive. I attended a session on Developing Custom Process Templates, Work Item Types and Policies by Kevin Kelly. This session was similar to the presentation by Dennis Minium at Tech Ed 05, but Kevin had some new content when he got the the demos.\n\nNext, I attended a BOF called \"Enhance Your Business and Professional Life By Getting The Most Out of the Local Developer Community\". This session totally exceeded my expectations. The facilitators did an excellent job of correcting my thinking about my user group. The take-away quote was \"running a user group has nothing to do with coding.\" The moderators had plenty of tips about how to get people involved in the group, how to vary the agenda, and how to focus on the community building aspects first with technology placing a far second.\n\nMy final session of the day was the best so far, and that is saying a lot. I have found my guru for deploying Team Foundation Server and his name is Sam Guckenheimer. Sam refers to himself as a coach, but I will be following his sage nuggets of wisdom like a devotee to his master.\n\nSam gave me a copy of his book, and I read the first 20 pages last night. This is the guide I intend to use for our road ahead. The key piece of wisdom he gave me at the end of his session on \"Using Metrics to Manage and Troubleshoot Your Projects\" was this: \"The heart of CMMi is process improvement.\" Sam totally understood the dissonance between developers trying to implement functionality in an iterative manner, and auditors focused on building to spec.\n\nOne of the biggest additions to my understanding of TFS at this conference has been the clarifying the difference between the map and the territory. The spec is a map. The MS Project file is a map. These are maps of where we want to go, but the model needs to reflect reality. With all the rich access to metrics provided by TFS, we can get a clear picture of the territory and adjust our maps to reflect reality.\n\n++Alan\n\n[Update] The rain has cleared off, so the concert should be lots of fun.\n\nMy first session today was with Rocky Lhotka. Rocky was actually very kind to datasets, and didn't harp on the lack of encapsulation. He showed the advantages of isolating code in partial classes in .NET 2.0. Of course, this being a Rocky Lhotka session, the ultimate solution was shown to be CSLA.NET. I asked Rocky if his objects implemented the correct behavior when the user presses the escape key, and he responded that they do. When he pressed the escape key, the expected behavior didn't happen. I'm glad to know that these situations still happen to someone of Rocky's stature and experience.\n\nI ate lunch with members of the MOM team, and asked them many questions about connecting MOM and TFS. They pointed me to AVIcode. I found the AVIcode booth, and talked with them. I'll be exploring the resources on their website more upon my return.\n\nI have been haunting the PowerShell booth trying to catch up with /\\/\\o\\/\\/. I went to talk to members of the Visual Studio team about the possiblity of a PowerShell add-in for VS. They've never heard of PowerShell! They gave me some good tips on how to follow up through the forums and the feedback site.\n\nWhile I was talking to a member of the VS team, I asked him about the future of Windows Forms, and he introduced me to CrossBow. This is exactly the kind of solution I like to see Microsoft producing. My existing code is not made obsolute by a new presentation technology. Windows Forms lives!\n\nProbably my last session for today was \"Visual Studio 2005 Team System and Microsoft Solution Framework: Implementing an Agile or CMMI Process\" with Randy Miller. This was one of my \"must attend\" sessions. My challenges in deploying TFS at this point all revolve around how to make use of the MSF guidance and templates. Randy gave us the model behind MSF, and offered to email chapters of his MSF book as he writes them. This was an important session for me.\n\nUpon returning to the Technical Learning Center, I made another stab at talking to someone on the Visual Studio team about PowerShell. I spoke to Kit George, a Program Manager on the CLR Team, and he had never heard of PowerShell! He gave me his card, and told me he would follow up on this if I eamil him.\n\nThe capstone of the day (so far) was some quality time with Sam Guckenheimer. I sat down with Sam and reviewed a workflow diagram I made after gathering requirements from my QA department. Sam had some excellent feedback, and thought through the problem fully. I made notes to share with my team upon my return. Sam rocks!\n\nI would be remiss if I did not mention the embarassing situation I went through trying to demo problems I was having with notifications to a member of the VSTS team. He let me use his laptop to remote into my work desktop and demonstrate the problem. The real problem turned out to be that the problem no longer exists! I apparantly had not tried the subscription feature since Beta 3. When it didn't work, I filed it as an issue in need of further investigation. The Microsoftie (I didn't get his name) was very gracious, and I was very red faced. In the end, I'm just happy it works.\n\nThe first session I tried to attend was full! I can usually walk into a session late and sit on the front row. Apparantly, LINQ is a popular topic. I'll catch the replay on the DVD.\n\nI did attend a session on \"Evolving to Patterns\" which was actually refactoring to patterns. I discovered that something I've been doing for years is called Dependency Injection. It's nice to be assured I'm on the right track.\n\nThe speaker recommended Working Effectively with Legacy Code, which looks like a useful text for my current job. He also liked Refactoring to Patterns. I plan to check them both out.\n\n++Alan\n\n[Update] I met Josh Holmes at breakfast this morning. I also got the skinny from Steve about a cool cigar bar here in Boston. Steve is actually blogging again, so check it out.\n\nI had a good, long talk with two members of the SQL Everywhere team this morning. They were very interested in my concerns about FoxPro interoperability. I had to take some time to explain the VFP development model, but they listened carefully. The biggest roadblock I see at this point, is the lack of ODBC connections in SQL Everywhere. They do support OLEDB connections, but the native SQLCONNNECT() function uses ODBC. I will download the CTP and play with it when I get home. I promised to post my feedback to the forum for their benefit.\n\nThe BCEC is enourmous and attractive, but it is difficult to navigate. It is sometimes impossible to get from A to B. Furthermore, the bathrooms are totally inadequate. This is a modern building, and I expect an abundance of facilities!\n\n[Update2] I got some time in with Ken Levy, and I was blown away. It turns out that Live is another case of lousy branding by Microsoft. Live is actually a collection of Web APIs that the team is attempting to normalize. They will all eventually have common programming models. In addition, they are implementing javascript libraries with similar programming models, so that a developer can program against a client side javascript object and allow that to converse with the web services. I was very excited by this demo.\n\nDuring lunch, I attended a session on managing requirements with Team Foundation Server and MindManager. Michael Scherotter put together a tool that provides bi-directional interaction with TFS work item tracking. This is very exciting for visualizing requirement/task dependencies at various levels in the task hierarchy.\n\n[Update3] I just spoke with Steve Lasker about SQL Everywhere and Visual FoxPro. He is a former VFP developer, and understood my concerns. He mentioned that he is in regular contact with Calvin Hsia, which put my mind at ease. Steve also pointed me to this recent blog entry where Calvin demonstrates working with SQL Everywhere.\n\n[Update4] I just finished the first Birds of a Feather session this evening. Joel Semeniuk led an informative discussion about project management with Team Foundation Server. I picked up some tricks about configuring MS Project to work properly with TFS. I'll share the details once I have tried them out. More BOF sessions to come.\n\nToday was the first \"real\" day of the conference. I planned to do too much, and now I'm exhausted.\n\nInitial impressions:\n\nTravel: Boston's airport is bigger than any airport has a right to be.\n\nThe Silver Line is freaking cool! The articulated bus runs by the airport, then stops at a station where it connects to overhead cables, and the engine shuts off. Next the bus/trolley travels into its own tunnel.\n\nLodging: Hotel Marlowe in Cambridge is as cool as it looks on the website. I have no regrets about choosing this funky establishment.\n\nFood: There's too damn much of it. My genetic code tells me to eat when food is available. Unfortunately, there is always food available. Breakfast and Lunch were excellent, and the evening reception with free \"refreshments\" was equally tasty.\n\nPeople: I had the opportunity to hang with Eric Sink, Martin Woodward and Don Demask. I also ran into Matt and Brendan. I saw Ken Levy, but he was busy pitching Windows Live. I'll bend his ear tomorrow. I also ran into Steve Loethen and Drewby. Steve is my Developer Evangelist, and Drew is the DE in the district north of me. I hope to get in on some code camps in Drew's district in the coming year.\n\nTechnology: SQL Everywhere looks like a great migration path for users of Jet or Visual FoxPro. My other sessions where about Team System, and my passions there are well documented. I'm looking forward to a PowerShell session tomorrow.\n\nI'm off to the jam session.\n\n++Alan\n\n[Update] No jam session for me. I went to the hotel to drop off my bag, and the leopard print robe and faux-fur throw looked soooooo comfy. I was exhausted, and knew that I wouldn't get the most out of Tuesday if I pushed myself too hard.\n\nI enjoyed presenting at the Atlanta Code Camp this weekend.Â We had a speakers' dinner the night before, and I got to meet most of the other presenters.Â The room was long and narrow, though, so I did not meet a few people at the other end of the room.\n\nIn particular, I enjoyed discussing LINQ with Jim Wooley and Wally.Â I got a good introduction to Visual Studio extensebility from Vinay Ahuja.Â I had a fun exchange with Charlie Arehart and Geoff Hiten about the impedance mismatch that occurs between developers and DBAs on where to put data access logic.\n\nMy father traveled with me, which was fun.Â This was my first Code Camp, and I was surprised by the amount of organization and coordination required to pull it off smoothly.Â Brendon, Matt and Doug as well as the rest of the volunteers deserve lots of credit for putting this together for the community.\n\nMy session was in the first time slot of the day, and was well attended.Â The audience seemed engaged in the material, and I enjoyed presenting.Â I had to high-tail it back to Knoxville immediately following my session in order to attend my daughter's ballet recital, so I didn't get to see any of the other sessions.\n\nThere was some discussion of another Atlanta Code Camp in February.Â If it happens, I would love to present again.Â In addition to more Team System talks, I would like to do a developer focused presentation on Windows PowerShell.Â Most of the current material is slanted toward administrators.\n\nFinally, I owe a HUGE \"thank you\" to Noah Subrin for loaning me his laptop power cord.Â I left mine sitting on the desk in Knoxville, where I tested everything before packing for Atlanta.Â What a typical rookie mistake.Â Thank's Noah, you rock!\n\n++Alan\n\nI did it. I allowed myself to be assimilated, and I have no regrets. Maybe itâs because Iâm approaching forty. Maybe my values have changed since college, or at least I hope they have. Monday, January 9, 2006, after completing a six month stint as a contractor, I started as a full-time employee of a defense contractor. We develop software specifically for the Department of Defense, and we do it very well.\n\nThe company is DPRA Incorporated. I work for the Defense Systems Group, or as a co-worker calls it âThe Developerâs Paradise.â DSG is run by a Senior VP who is also a software developer. He can discuss with familiarity the ideas of Fredrick Brooks and Tom Demarco. In fact, he told me that everyone has an office with a door because of Tom Demarcoâs book Peopleware.\n\nThatâs right kids. I have an office with a door! I also work uninterrupted. Other than our weekly team meeting, if I want anyone to know about my progress, I have to find them, and let them know.\n\nThis doesnât mean we are immune to the realities of software development. Last fall I had to meet a deadline, and I assembled my project in a decidedly slap dash manner in order to fulfill the requirements of the contract. What is unique is that after we met the deadline, I had time to refactor my work into a more maintainable form before release.\n\nBesides the creature comforts, my coworkers are smart, talented and professional. This may sound like hyperbole, but I assure you that I work with some of the best people in the industry. Last summer I went to TechEd and got a feel for the best and the brightest. Iâve met the best of the best, and I work with some of them on a daily basis.\n\nIt used to be that the three companies I most wanted to work for were (in order of preference): FogCreek, Microsoft & Wintellect, but not anymore. Iâm home, and I donât have any intention of leaving. If youâd like to join me, then keep your eyes open. We hire regularly."
