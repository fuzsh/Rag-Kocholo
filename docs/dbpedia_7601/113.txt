THINKFilm has acquired “Festival Express,” the chronicle of a Canada’s 1970 answer to Woodstock. The film, which debuted at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival, features performances by Janis Joplin, The Band, and The Grateful Dead. The company will release the movie later this year.

What made Festival Express a unique musical happening was the fact that it was a traveling event. The event moved, by train, from Toronto to Calgary and then Winnipeg, where it concluded with a major concert. Peter Biziou captured on and off-stage footage of the event in black and white. The footage is mixed with interviews that has been assembled by Bob Smeaton.

“We expect 2004 to be a really exciting year for us and I couldn’t be happier than to begin it with this announcement,” THINKFilm president and CEO Jeff Sackman said in a prepared statement. “‘Festival Express’ has so much potential, in so many ways, for so many generations. I think that marketing and distributing it will be a great ride for our team.”
