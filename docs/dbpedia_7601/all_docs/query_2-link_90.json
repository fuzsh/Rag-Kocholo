        "text": "A jazz festival renowned for its unique, intimate venues and mountain setting returns to Evergreen late this month. The 21st Evergreen Jazz Festival is July 26, 27 and 28, and features bands playing at five venues scattered around the area.\n\nIn keeping with the festival’s goal of education and drawing new fans to jazz, the event opens with an educational concert and includes student clinics taught by festival musicians.\n\n“Our festival is different,” said Jim Reiners, the event’s marketing director. “Most jazz festivals these days are held in hotels. They don’t begin to offer the same kind of listening environment our venues do. The multi-venue program we use is like a much more traditional festival. It’s an up-close and personal atmosphere with world-class bands. I think people like that, and they love coming up to the mountains.”\n\nVenues include the Evergreen Lake House, Evergreen Christian Church, Center Stage and the ballroom and patio at the Evergreen Elks Lodge.\n\nEach year’s lineup features some returning favorite acts as well as a few newcomers. This year, new acts include Arkansas-based Hal Smith’s El Dorado Jazz Band. Some members of the group performed together in southern California in the 1960s.\n\n“Hal was at our very first festival and is just a world-class performer,” Reiners said. “This is a new group he’s put together.”\n\nAnother is the Chicago Cellar Boys, a Windy City group formed in 2017 that specializes in the classic jazz and dance styles of the 1920s and 30s.\n\nWhile Reiner’s excited about the new groups, he said festival-goers have traditionally been happy with the event lineup.\n\n“We have comment cards each year so patrons can tell us what they think,” he said. “They all want every band brought back every year, which speaks to the quality of the music.”\n\nReiners, now an Austin, Texas resident, helped launch the festival in 2001 when he lived in Evergreen. He worked closely with event founder Sterling Nelson, who died in 2020.\n\nVolunteers are still needed to help with various aspects of the event, with free tickets awarded for the amount of time worked, Reiners said.\n\nTickets range from $60 to $165. The $165 three-day pass includes full admission to all events. Tickets for specific days and times can also be purchased.\n\nFor more information and tickets, visit evergreenjazz.org."
