        "text": "I literally almost missed the boat when it came to seeing the remarkable “in concert” version of “Ladyship, The Musical” that was produced by Main Stage at the Arkley Center for just two performances this past weekend\n\nThis was due to the fact (for whatever reason) that I wasn’t personally/professionally made aware of the extremely limited run of this intriguing event, well in advance, so that I could be sure and see/review it for Urge.\n\nHowever, luckily — thanks to cast member Jonny Wisan (who “invited” me to see it in his Facebook post on Thursday before its first performance at 7 p.m. on Saturday night or closing 2 p.m. Sunday matinee) — I was able to contact Main Stage’s Daphne Endert and see Saturday’s event.\n\nAnd, as it turned out, the company’s one-hour, in-concert performance of this unique and powerful work was one of their best. Ever! And, what an unexpected, artistic pleasure it was to see something that was totally, completely, brand new. Not only to me, but (I’m sure) to the rest of the Arkley’s spellbound audience.\n\n“Ladyship, The Musical” (in its full 2019 version) was co-created by the extraordinarily talented, sister team of Laura Good and Linda Good. They collaborated on the book, lyrics, musical arrangements and orchestrations and the one-hour, Main Stage “in-concert” performance featured selected songs and scenes from the original, full-length musical.\n\nThe Good sisters were originally inspired to base their work upon the true, unsettling, little-known/shared history of Female Convict Ships in the 1780s. This is when countless, poverty stricken, helpless women and girls (left without male protection on their own in the streets of England) were wrongfully arrested for (real, or false) petty theft. This meant a potential death penalty.\n\nAnd, if they escaped hanging, their punishment was being forced onto cramped, filthy and sexually dangerous “Lady Ships” that emigrated them (if they survived the journey itself) to serve seven years of hard labor in England’s new, originally male convicts penal colony of Australia.\n\nSo, that’s how all of the male-run London prisons cleared their over-crowded premises. By gathering together the convicted women (of child-bearing age only) and shipping them “to work off their sentences.” This also meant marrying the eagerly awaiting male convicts in Australia, “whether they wanted to or not.”\n\nHowever, this male-dominated, despicable situation somehow managed to (eventually) have some unexpected “benefits” for women who figured out how to both earn and save some money. Because, in Australia, they could keep their money, and even open a business— —with, or without, a man’s support or permission. And they did.\n\nSo, bottom line issues addressed by the insightful Good sisters within the framework of the musical’s story and songs include forced emigration; rich vs. poor; socio-economic oppression; money and politics (how it shapes people’s fates and lives); and the power dynamic of men and women — issues that unfortunately still resonate strongly today all over the world.\n\nBut, the way that all of the above is presented so personally by the musical’s intriguing characters and their heart-breaking situations, is what also brings the songs to poignant, powerful life. And, the unexpected, contemporary chords that infuse the score (as well as the gorgeous harmonies intertwined in the duets), make each song unique and memorable in its own way.\n\nAlso unexpected, is the rawness of the feelings shared in the dialogue — sometimes using the profane language needed to express it. And, because of how deeply felt the truth is of what’s being experienced by the characters saying and/or singing those words (whether it be love, pain, or anger), you realized it couldn’t have been said/sung better.\n\nHere are the descriptive titles of those songs, each stunningly performed by the Main Stage soloist and/or ensemble: “Who Decides,” “Seven Years,” “The Bloody Code,” “A Way Out,” “So Many Stars,” “Only the Strong Survive,” “Never Burns Away,” “Sparrow,” “Everything Has a Price,” “No Matter Where We’re Bound,” “I’m Done” and “I’ll Find a Way.”\n\nAnd here are the outstanding, featured cast members as the characters whose acting and musical performances made “Ladyship” soar in the Arkley: Gwyneth Bise, Taylee Mullins, Mackenzie Urch, Finn Ferguson; Todd Hoberecht, Jonny Wisan and young Adeline Pierce. Other young performers in the supporting ensemble were Gemma Caruso, Arianna McLeod, Ruby Smith and Madisyn Wood.\n\nThe fascinating score was masterfully played throughout by pianist Avery Alexander. And the impeccable music direction was by Fiona Ryder. (The cast ensemble’s acapella performances alone were breathtaking with their intonation and clarity. But, every solo and duet was equally outstanding.) The young performers vocal coaching was done by Andrew Widger (The Prep NJ) and the acting consultant was Crystin Gilmore.\n\nFYI: Laura Good and Linda Good are aka the alternative pop duo, The Twigs, and when “Ladyship” world-debuted in New York City in 2019 it was an Official Grand Jury production at the New York Musical Festival. It was also a finalist for the Richard Rogers Award for Musical Theatre 2020. To hear/see some of the score performed by the original cast, go to Ladyship The Musical” (Trailer 2024) The Twigs TV YouTube.\n\nIn any case, I can honestly say that in my opinion, the Main Stage performers were equally outstanding. So, hopefully (if it’s at all possible), they’ll all sail back and land again with another, in-concert “Ladyship” at the Arkley in the not-too-distant future!"
