        "text": "Festival Express Directed by Bob Smeaton Starring Janis Joplin, The Band, The Grateful Dead and others Classification: PG Rating: * * *\n\nPulled out of archives, garages and more than 30 years of legal limbo, about 70 hours of film have been carefully assembled into what amounts to a new rockumentary classic, Festival Express.\n\nThe film chronicles the semi-legendary Canadian rock tour of 1970 on a chartered CN train, featuring Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead and The Band. Originally presented by a couple of 22-year-old impresarios, truculent commerce student Ken Walker and Thor Eaton, of the department-store dynasty, the Festival Express tour played just three dates, Toronto, Winnipeg and Calgary, and was a financial disaster. Now, thanks to a massive effort in retrieving scattered footage from the event, the Festival Express has become a belated triumph as a film.\n\nThe musical highlights are nearly all from performers who died prematurely but are caught in their youthful peak: Janice Joplin's hair-raising opening squall at the beginning of her superb Cry Baby, Richard Manuel's (of The Band) eerie vocal on I Shall Be Released and Jerry Garcia's gently impeccable singing and playing throughout.\n\nFestival Express is an intriguing oddity, a reconstruction of a film that never was. Bob Smeaton (he did The Beatles Anthology for television) is credited as director though, in fact, he had nothing to do with shooting the original footage (the principal cinematographer was Peter Biziou, who later won an Oscar for Mississippi Burning in 1988). Smeaton directed contemporary interviews with some of the original passengers, Bob Weir and Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead, Sylvia Tyson, John Till of Joplin's Full Tilt Boogie Band, and found a way of assembling the footage into a coherent whole.\n\nThe team has chosen to deliberately maintain the sixties look of the film stock, and editing style, with frequent uses of split screen, lens flare and other tricks of the period.\n\nWhen it came to audio overseen by producer Eddie Kramer, the filmmakers were both lucky and skillful. The luck is that the sound quality of what had been recorded is first-rate, although engineers had to match up audio and visuals, using 2004 technology to re-invent 1970 performances.\n\nAny documentary is as much a product of what is usable as what happened (Joplin, The Grateful Dead and The Band all played Woodstock, but were not in that movie because they did not sign releases), but the situation is exaggerated with Festival Express. Some acts on the bill - Delaney & Bonnie & Friends, and Mountain - were never filmed. The Montreal band, Mashmakhan, is shown playing only the tail end of a jazz-rock instrumental.\n\nSinger-songwriter Eric Andersen offers a present-day interview, but gets no musical time in the film.\n\nThe story the film tells is quite different from the anti-establishment Woodstock-nation ideology. The film is not about the audience's shared experience, and a lot more about how cool it is to have a backstage pass.\n\nThe audience, not the promoters, not the police, come across as the bad guys.\n\nIn Toronto, a group of protesters tried to storm the gates, in protest against the $14 ticket. While a young man who seizes the mike complains about the pigs busting heads, the promoters and musicians were definitely onside with the police. In fact, they hired them to provide security for the event and had a friendly relationship with them. Phil Lesh of The Grateful Dead thought the Toronto cops were boss. Garcia, after taking the microphone and pleading for coolness, arranges with the ever-helpful police to put on a free concert in an adjacent park.\n\nLove, peace and understanding? Not quite: \"The audiences weren't worth the effort,\" says a still-bitter Walker in a contemporary interview. \"I gave the public too much and they didn't deserve it.\"\n\nInstead, there was musicians' camaraderie, fuelled by a steady stream of booze. \"Most of us were new to drinking at that time,\" says Dead guitarist Bob Weir. The choice of intoxicant seems to have helped keep the group extroverted. The centrepiece of the film is a scene on the train where a drunk and joyful Rick Danko hollers through the traditional song, Ain't No More Cane, with Joplin crooning along and Garcia improvising on the guitar. Garcia stops briefly to tell Joplin he has loved her from the first time he met her.\n\nThroughout, the spirit of the living-room jam session dominates; the entire event peaks with a performance on the Calgary stage of the traditional CC Rider by Ian and Sylvia, in which their band, Great Speckled Bird, is joined by Garcia and other members of the Dead, Bonnie Bramlett and others.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Calgary concert, Joplin and Garcia presented gifts to the promoters - a toy train and a case of tequila. Says Joplin: \"The next time you throw a train, man, invite me.\""
