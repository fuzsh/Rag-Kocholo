If any ticket holder does not comply with any laws, mandates, health orders or directives, promoter or event terms, conditions or rules, then the promoter or event operator may refuse admission to the event or require the ticket holder to leave the venue and such ticket holder will not be entitled to a refund.\n\nCovid-19 Warning\n\nCOVID-19 is an extremely contagious disease that can lead to severe illness and death. There is an inherent and elevated risk of exposure to COVID-19 in any public place or place where people are present and there is no guarantee, express or implied, that those attending the festival will not be exposed to COVID-19.\n\nAttendee Promise & Health Acknowledgement\n\nAll attendees agree to follow festival policies (including health and safety policies) and posted instructions while at the festival. All attendees should evaluate their risk in determining whether to attend the festival. By entering the festival, attendees voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to viruses (including, without limitation, COVID-19) and confirm that they will adhere to federal, state and local mandates and/or any quarantine or isolation recommendations.\n\nPublic Safety\n\nSecurity and safety are of utmost importance. We work hand in hand with law enforcement and public safety agencies to help ensure the safety of our events. Because of those very same concerns, we are unable to publicly comment on detailed, specific actions which are taken. You will notice safety measures upon your arrival such as dog sweeps, bag checks, and walk-through metal detectors (magnetometers, open gates or evolve systems) for all attendees, staff, and performers.\n\nPlease note that we will implement safety screenings upon festival entry. Please arrive early and note the Prohibited Items list. Prohibited items will be refused upon entry and must be returned to the patron’s vehicle or disposed of by the patron.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, information may be relayed on the video screens, over the audio system, and/or through mobile notifications via the festival app.\n\nIf you, or a friend, require medical assistance please locate your nearest medical tent or alert a staff member. And remember: if you see something, say something. Flag down any staff member or public safety official if you notice something that doesn’t seem quite right."
