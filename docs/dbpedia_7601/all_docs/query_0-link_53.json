        "text": "For the second year, the Caladium Festival will feature steam-powered passenger train rides operating hour-long trips out of Lake Placid on July 26th and 27th. Known as the “Caladium Capital of the World,” Lake Placid celebrates the colorful blooming flower and agricultural heritage of Highlands County and routinely welcomes 20,000 visitors a year.\n\nThe Caladium Festival Flyer will depart Friday and Saturday at 10:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 2:00 PM daily. Tickets are $30.00 per person plus tax. Children 3 and under who do not occupy a seat ride free. A portion of funds raised from the Caladium Flyer will support the Lake Placid Historical Society and Lake Placid Chamber of Commerce.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Due to its historic nature, Sugar Express is not ADA-accessible. Cars used on excursions feature steep steps, narrow hallways, and doorways, as well as small restrooms which can present challenges for guests with limited mobility. Due to the nature of this historic equipment, we cannot accommodate pets except for service animals. Please contact our ticket agent before purchasing for questions on accommodations.\n\nPurchase tickets here: https://sugarexpress.ticketspice.com/caladium-weekend\n\nFor more information, contact the Sugar Express by emailing contact@sugarexpress.com."
