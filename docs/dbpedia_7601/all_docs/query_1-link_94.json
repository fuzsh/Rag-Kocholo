        "text": "Objectives\n\nWe set out to raise awareness; the main goal being to introduce 21+ music fans to Cuervo Tradicional.\n\nStrategy and Execution\n\nPOV: you’re sipping tequila on a train traveling the countryside of Mexico’s tequila region en route to the oldest operating distillery where the iconic Jose Cuervo is produced and life is good. For those in attendance on the 2022 festival circuit, they had an opportunity to get a taste of what this experience might feel like…\n\nMaking its festival debut in 2022, Cuervo developed an immersive, multi-level 40’ x 40’ experience that began by taking consumers on a journey through a replica of the Cuervo Express—yes, a real train owned and operated by America’s most beloved tequila.\n\nThe Cuervo Express entry was built using the original as an inspiration alongside real materials from the Cuervo Express, complete with digital assets showcasing a modern, trippy portrayal of the sites seen by those riding the Cuervo Express in Tequila, Mexico.\n\nCuervo Tradicional, the brand’s premium 100% agave tequilas, was the exclusive tequila showcased in a variety of signature cocktails to drive sampling at scale. Each drink was served in an eco-friendly cup with a sustainable straw. In an effort to reduce waste at the Cuervo distillery, both items are custom made using bagasse, the fibrous byproduct of tequila production.\n\nIn efforts to raise awareness for their newest extension, Cuervo Tradicional Cristalino, strategic elements were implemented to engage and education consumers. This was done atop the second level Cuervo Cristalino bar, featuring cocktails available only from the top-level, and a coveted bird’s eye view of the festival. As the sun set, consumers were treated to live DJ performances pulling in festival talent providing a memorable, intimate experience.\n\nThe footprint offered ample lounge seating, inspired by modern-Mexico, and encouraged social sharing with trendy graphics. One-of-a-kind pod lounges were created and inspired by the agave plant, which is integral to tequila production. Guests were able to relax in the neon-lit agave pods, sip cocktails and charge their phones.\n\nResults\n\nOnce the festival season wrapped, the results were in for Cuervo’s Festival Express:\n\n- 3 National Festivals Activated\n\n- 18K+ Crushable Cuervo Tequila Cocktails\n\n- 25K+ Fans Engaged\n\n- 1K+ Branded Merch Items Sold"
