The show was a multi-artist, multi-city concert tour that captured the spirit and imagination of a generation. The entire experience was filmed both off-stage and on, but the extensive footage of the events remained locked away for decades, only recently having been restored. Festival Express is a momentous achievement in rock film archeology which combines the long-lost material with contemporary interviews that add important context to the event nearly 35 years after being filmed.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nDetails\n\nTitle: Festival Express Genre: Rock, Music Video (Concert/Performance) Starring: Buddy Guy Blues Band, Delaney & Bonnie & Friends, The Flying Burrito Brothers, The Grateful Dead, The Band Director: Bob Smeaton Release Date: 2/11/2014 Original Year: 2003 Product Type: Blu-ray Catalog #: 14359 UPC: 826663143591 Item #: 981224X\n\nTechnical Information\n\nStreet Date: 2/11/2014 Closed Caption: No Studio: Shout Factory"
