Review by worldfilm.about.com In the Summer of 1970, a number of rock bands, including the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, the Band, and Buddy Guy, played a series of festivals across Canada.

        "text": "Rail…Riots…Rock ‘n’ Roll –\n\nAnd, Janis is on ‘it’…\n\nReview by worldfilm.about.com\n\nBut the film’s many privileged glimpses at some of rock history’s legendary icons are only a side show, and Smeaton never loses sight of the music. Mixed by Eddie Kramer (famous for his work with Jimi, Zeppelin, and Santana), “Festival Express” showcases the incindiary guitar work of Buddy Guy, the antics of Sha Na Na, and the country-rock of the Flying Burrito Brothers. The Band does “The Weight” and “I Shall Be Released,” and the Dead play “Don’t Ease Me In” and a beautiful afternoon “New Speedway Boogie.” The highlight of the film are two absolutely stunning performances by Janis Joplin: “Cry Baby” and “Tell Mama” are tight, intense, and so emotionally raw that it seems hardly surprising Joplin died only two months later.\n\nExuberant, outrageous, and seriously smokin’, “Festival Express” is an essential document of the heady days when, as Bob Weir puts it, “rock ‘n roll mattered.” It’s impossible to imagine a comparable trip–and movie — with today’s crop of ClearChannel performers. Garcia and Joplin appear as obsessively dedicated musicians who are as serious about their craft as they are about having a good time. The decision to retain the look of the original 16mm stock and to use montage and split screen effects truthful to the period turn “Festival Express” into a lost gem, an instant classic. The only complaint is the film’s brevity: I would gladly have sat through more than 90 minutes of this outstanding material."
