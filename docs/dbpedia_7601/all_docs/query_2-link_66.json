        "text": "The Festival takes place at the Fair Grounds Race Course, 1751 Gentilly Boulevard.\n\nTravel\n\nTo make it easier for travelers to plan their trips, Expedia launched the new Jazz Fest Travel Hub which features city guides, travel resources and exclusive offers for One Key™ members such as hotel discounts and access to giveaways and VIP experiences.\n\nParking\n\nParking on site is available for pre-purchase ONLY with the Big Chief, Grand Marshal and Krewe of Jazz Fest VIP packages.

Patrons are encouraged to use alternative modes of travel, such as Jazz Fest Express (The Official Jazz Fest Shuttle), public transportation, carpools and bicycles.\n\nJazz Fest Express Shuttle\n\nThe Jazz Fest Express shuttle in 2024 will provide continuous round-trip transportation between 4 departure points and the Fair Grounds, the site of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.

Ticket, food, beverage, craft, and merchandise booths accept credit cards, debit cards and digital forms of payment such as ApplePay, etc. For Festivalgoers who come to the event with only cash, the Festival will offer two cash exchange booths.\n\nWhat Forms of Payment Will Be Accepted?\n\nAll Major Credit Cards\n\nDebit Cards\n\nPrepaid Cards\n\nApple Pay\n\nGoogle Pay\n\nSamsung Pay\n\nWhat’s the Cash Exchange Process at Jazz Fest?\n\nPatrons without credit cards or digital payment options, can bring their cash to a Cash Exchange location and obtain a prepaid card. There is a maximum exchange of $500 per card. Multiple cards can be purchased. There are no fees associated with getting a card. Any balance remaining on a prepaid card can be spent outside the Festival.\n\nPlease see the Jazz Fest Map for Cash Exchange locations.\n\nThe weather in New Orleans can range from pleasantly warm to uncomfortably hot, so you’ll want to dress in cool, unrestrictive clothing. Lightweight cotton is never a bad idea. There are a few shady trees scattered here and there throughout the Fair Grounds, but the infield is, for the most part, wide open to the sun. Therefore, most people consider sunglasses to be essential, not to mention sunscreen or sunblock. A hat with a wide brim or visor is also a good idea. Wear comfortable shoes, as you may be doing a lot of walking. You’ll want to keep hydrated, too: there are beverages available throughout the Heritage Fair, and cold drinking water can be found in the Grandstand, which is also a good source of shade and air conditioning, not to mention many of the Festival’s hidden treasures. Also, several stages on the infield and in Heritage Square are under tents that offer relief from the sun.\n\nJazz Fest Food Vendor Inquiry Information\n\nFor the past four decades the Food Fair at Jazz Fest has famously served some of the most delicious, restaurant quality, authentically prepared food to be found anywhere, let alone at a multi-day outdoor festival. Jazz Fest’s carefully developed menu encompasses traditional Creole and Cajun recipes, contemporary Creole innovations, New Orleans standards, and foods that reflect the rich influx of international influence in Louisiana.\n\nWhat started out with a small handful of food items has now grown into an [irresistible] menu\n\nfeaturing over 200 offerings, including many beloved dishes that have become a part of the Festival’s culture and, indeed, a part of the culinary culture of New Orleans.\n\nThe food items are prepared by vendors who have, for the most part, been participating in the Food Fair for many years. Festival food vendors have learned over the years to adapt to the challenges inherent to serving hundreds of thousands of Festival-goers over the course of seven days in an outdoor environment. It is a rigorous task given the fact that the food is prepared mostly by hand, with fresh local ingredients.\n\nIn any given Festival season there are very few openings for new vendors. In most years, there are none. On the rare occasion when there is an opening is it usually for a specific food item. There is no formal application process, but the Festival is always interested in learning about experienced food vendors who are creating exciting new Louisiana food items or superior quality versions of classic regional dishes.\n\nIf you feel your business model is compatible with the Festival criteria, you are welcome to fill out our Food Vendor Inquiry Contact Sheet (click here).\n\nPlease keep in mind the following:\n\nAll potential vendors must be full-time Louisiana residents.\n\nNo self-contained vending structures or vehicles are permitted.\n\nNo “carnival” food items or beverages will be considered.\n\nThere is minimal, if any, duplication of food items.\n\nFood items must be prepared and served by the vendor and vendor is required to operate all Festival days.\n\nGeneral liability, vehicle liability and worker’s compensation insurance are required.\n\nThe information on the Food Vendor Inquiry Contact Sheet will be added to the Festival’s Food Fair database. This database is used for informational purposes only and does not obligate the Festival in any way.\n\nThank you for your interest."
