        "text": "Festival Express 1970 movie + Various Festival Express 2 DVD\n\nfull\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e9UAe61y9k\n\nwatch…\n\nhttp://www.festivalexpress.com/index2.html\n\nwatch..\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/gd1970-07-00.aud.miller.106571.flac16\n\nwatch\n\nhttp://deadessays.blogspot.gr/2013/07/the-festival-express-guide.html\n\nI wish I had a time-machine. Like Marty McFly in Back To The Future. I would climb inside Doc Brown’s DeLorean DMC-12 and set the controls to 27th June 1970 and join Janis, Robbie, Levon and Jerry on the Trans-Continental Express, as they grooved their way across Canada by train.\n\nThe Trans-Continental Pop Festival (better known as the Festival Express) set off on this day in 1970. The now legendary tour was unique in that rather than flying to each city, most of the acts traveled on a chartered train. The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin (with her Full-Tilt Boogie Band), The Band, Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, The Flying Burrito Brothers and Buddy Guy Blues Band all jammed, drank, slept and rode the train in between playing shows in Toronto, Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Calgary.\n\nThe chartered Canadian National Railways train consisted of 14 cars, equipped with lounges and sleeping compartments, with electricity sockets so that musical instruments could be plugged in. Allegedly, during the trip, a coke-fuelled Jerry Garcia talked his way into sitting in the driver’s seat and was left at the controls, regularly sounding the train’s whistle.\n\nThe train journey between cities ultimately became a combination of non-stop jam sessions and partying, fueled by alcohol. One highlight of the documentary is a drunken jam session featuring The Band’s Rick Danko, Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir from the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin.Unsurprisingly the passengers drank the bar dry and, as is shown in the film, the musicians passed around a hat and the train made an unscheduled stop to find a liquor store for much needed supplies. I seem to remember that, much to the bemusement of the owner, they bought most of the contents of the store.\n\nThe tour had an original budget of about $900,000 but, largely due to less than predicted turnout, it ultimately lost between $350,00 and $500,000 for the promoters. Part of the reason for this was The May 4th Movement (inspired by the killing of four students by Ohio National Guardsmen at Kent State University), who demanded free music and an end to “The RRRRip-Off Express” decrying ticket prices; over 2,500 protestors gathered outside the first show in Toronto.\n\nThe tour featured now-legendary performances by the Grateful Dead, The Band and Janis Joplin. The Dead were in the process of transforming their sound from dense, jammed psychedelia to the country/folk harmonies of Workingman’s Dead and American Beauty, The Band’s performance showed them at the pinnacle of the their powers and for Joplin, it would turn out to be some of her last performances, as she died two months later.\n\nBecause the Festival Express tour turned out to be a complete financial disaster, the film project was shelved as the promoters sued the film-makers, and the footage mysteriously disappeared. Some of the film’s reels turned up in the garage of the original producer Willem Poolman, where they had been stored for decades and used at various times as goal posts for ball hockey games played by his son Gavin.\n\nEventually, in 1999, a plan was hatched to resurrect the film, and many more reels were found in the Canadian National Film Archives vault, where they had been kept in pristine condition. Director Bob Smeaton (The Beatles ‘Anthology) was hired, and the eventual finished show was premiered in 2003, grossing more than $1 million in movie theatres before being released on DVD to much acclaim.\n\nShowing that a good idea is never too good to keep down, in 1978, legendary UK Indie label Stiff records borrowed the idea for the ‘Be Stiff Route 78 tour’, all the acts travelling round the UK by specially-chartered train. Wreckless Eric, Lene Lovich, Jona Lewie, Mickey Jupp and Rachel Sweet were the recipients of the honour this time around, although the tour was a lot longer than the original Canadian week. The ‘Be Stiff’ Tour lasted from October 10 to November 19, 1978, a full 5 weeks of riding the rails, with a lot less excess: 16-year-old Rachel Sweet was doing sums rather than lines as the train crisscrossed the country.\n\nStill, it’s the only way to travel……..\n\nCanada’s Travelling Music Festival\n\nOn June 27 and 28, 1970, a touring rock and roll show commonly referred to as the “Festival Express” opened in Toronto. Toronto was the first of three stops of a moveable musical feast; whereas most music festivals of the time were held in a single location, the Festival Express moved from Toronto to Winnipeg and then on to Calgary, with many of the performers including Janis Joplin, The Band, and the Grateful Dead travelling between venues on a Canadian National train chartered by the festival’s organizers.\n\nThe organizers of the show were Eaton-Walker Associates, who were Ken Walker and brothers George and Thor Eaton (the latter being great-grandsons of Timothy Eaton), three men in their mid-20s intent on organizing a unique kind of music festival. By 1970, rock festivals had become frequent occurrences across North America. The previous summer had seen the famous Woodstock Music & Art Fair, a concert which by 1970 was being hailed as a cultural success by Life Magazine, even if it was a financial and organizational disaster for the organizers. Woodstock, in fact, only proved financially profitable when the concert’s documentary film came out the subsequent spring; the film was still playing at Toronto’s Uptown Theatre the weekend that the Festival Express opened in Toronto.\n\nOperating out of a townhouse near Dupont and Davenport, Eaton-Walker Associates (with reported help from Maclean-Hunter Publishing, Ltd.) had organized shows in Toronto the previous summer, including the “Toronto Rock and Roll Revival” at Varsity Stadium, where 20,000 saw (amongst others) Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Doors and the debut performance of The Plastic Ono Band.\n\nIn preparation for the crowd of 30,000 anticipated at Exhibition Stadium, Eaton-Walker hired 100 off-duty police officers to assist with security; the Festival Express took place only six months after the infamous Altamont Speedway Free Festival in California, where poor security was partially blamed for four deaths, including one homicide. Eaton-Walker also made sure ample measures were taken to cope with the anticipated number of “bad trips” brought on by hallucinogenic drugs. The Globe and Mail noted that the organizers worked ahead of time with the Queen Street Mental Health Centre “as routinely as they work with the fire department or the traffic control unit.”\n\nThe actual concert line-up featured many of rock music’s elite, including the Grateful Dead, The Band, Ian & Sylvia, Buddy Guy and Janis Joplin. Several acts only played in the Toronto portion of the festival, including Traffic and Ten Years After. The press mentioned Miles Davis as an expected performer multiple times prior to the concert, but did not actually perform.\n\nLike Woodstock and Altamont, the Festival Express was hampered by groups of radicals who protested the high ticket prices, demanding that the concerts be given for free. A few weeks before the tour opened in Toronto, several local radical groups lead by the “May 4th Movement” began protesting the Festival Express’ ticket prices, condemning the organizers and musicians for charging what was then the highest rate ever for a Toronto rock concert: $16 for both days ($14 advance) or $10 for one day ($9 advance). According to a June 24th Toronto Star article, the protesting collective not only condemned the high prices, but demanded that 20% of the gate receipts “be turned over to them for daycare centres, a bail fund, and equipment for people’s parks.” The May 4th Movement, who named themselves after the date of the shootings at Kent State University the previous month, distributed leaflets and received publicity in the Toronto newspapers. They urged those who could not afford the high prices to storm the gates outside the concert to try to get in for free.\n\nBy all accounts, however, most of those who attended in Toronto paid, and the protestors comprised a minority. The Globe and Mail estimated that about 2,500 protestors actually turned up, some of whom broke in, but most of whom were initially detained outside.\n\nBut 2,500 protestors is still a considerable number, and confrontations did indeed occur. A few threw rocks, firecrackers or pepper at the police providing security, whereas others were content to merely hurl insults. Based on the newspaper accounts, between 27 and 34 arrests were made, a few for drug offenses (accounts suggest most casual drug use was ignored by police, with the Globe and Mail likening the blind eye shown by authorities to that traditionally applied towards hip flasks at the Grey Cup), others for assault. Most sentences were reduced to fines, but one 17 year-old from upstate New York was sentenced to thirty days in jail for assaulting a mounted officer, after he threw a rock (which missed), grabbed the horse’s bridle and spat in the officer’s face.\n\nIn order to appease the protestors demanding a free show, several musicians, lead by Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, agreed to set up a second stage at nearby Coronation Park, where the public was admitted for free. This move appeased most of the protestors as several thousand people attended the free companion concert.\n\nDespite the episodes of violence, most concert-goers paid their way and behaved with goodwill and reason. Drug use, particularly marijuana and LSD, was prevalent, with accounts giving the number of “bad trips” being treated by units set up by the Queen Street Mental Health Centre near 1,000. In most of these cases, however, the staff found the sufferer could simply be “talked down” from their supposed emergency, and no serious drug cases were reported.Relations between police and peaceful concert-goers appear to have been excellent, as seen in an incident reported on the front page of the June 27th Toronto Star. Toronto Police Constable John Sagar encountered eight college students up from Ohio to see the show (according to some reports, “Go to Toronto” shirts were a popular item in the U.S. all that month), who had camped out downtown in a tent. Sagar and his partner, Constable Gordon Srigley, much to the students’ surprise, invited the youths to get out of the rain and stay at the officers’ homes with their families for the duration of the weekend. One of the students, 16 year-old Rita Svanks, was quote as saying “we heard that Toronto cops were different from any American cops but never thought they were so friendly.”Promoter Ken Walker had considered cancelling the show if the violence escalated too far, but claimed to be satisfied by the end of the weekend. Attendance figures for the Toronto dates vary considerably, but the Star reported that the Festival Express left Toronto having grossed just under $500,000, with the organizers still on pace to make a profit.\n\nReviews of the musical content were generally positive, Bill Dampier writing in the Star that “it was worth that much [the $16 admission] and more to see and hear Janis Joplin sing with the insistence and power of a pile-driver and generate enough personal electricity to light up a stadium all by her herself.” Upon taking the stage at 11:30 PM on Sunday, Joplin said “Man, I never expected this of Toronto. You’re really looking beautiful, man.” Three months after the Festival Express closed in Calgary, she was dead.\n\nKen Walker’s comments at the time about the festival being on target to make money may have been tactical, designed to encourage ticket sales in the remaining cities, where protests over ticket prices continued. Events reached a head when Calgary Mayor Rod Sykes tried to have the Calgary portion of the tour made free; Ken Walker claims he responded by punching Sykes in the face. By the end of the Festival Express tour the promoters had failed to recover their costs, and the Festival Express reportedly lost over $500,000.\n\nLike the Woodstock organizers before them, however, the Festival Express promoters also invited a film crew. For years afterwards the film footage languished, finally edited and premiering as Festival Express at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival to critical acclaim. The documentary includes footage of the shows at Exhibition Stadium and Coronation Park (as well as the Winnipeg and Calgary shows, and many memorable “jams” on the train itself, which was fully rigged with instruments and alcohol, in the hopes of fuelling creativity and comradery). Viewers can judge for themselves the merits of the music.\n\nThe released film also includes scenes of protest, providing a record of some of the dissent that the concert provoked. Some of the recent interviews included in the film suggest that the Toronto concerts were a complete debacle, but by contemporary newspaper accounts the Toronto portion of the Festival Express was a financial and organizational success, and an example of how musicians, promoters, security, mental health workers and audience members can overcome dissent and work together to create a wonderful event. At the conclusion of the weekend in Toronto, promoter Ken Walker was quoted in the Globe and Mail as saying “the media blew up the whole situation. They forgot about all the kids who just wanted to come down and have a good time. There were more of them and they made the festival, as far as I’m concerned, an operational and financial success.”….By David Wencer………\n\nIn the summer of 1970, a series of music festivals were held across Canada. After the first concert in Toronto, the musicians, roadies and a film crew boarded a private train to travel to the remaining events in Winnipeg and Calgary.\n\nThe Festival Express was the brainchild of two brash, young promoters named Ken Walker and Thor Eaton. Not satisfied with assembling one of the most incredible travelling concert bills in history (performers included Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, The Band, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Eric Andersen, Buddy Guy, Great Speckled Bird, and many more) Walker and Eaton decided that \"packaging” the tour in the form of a CN railcar moving across the vast landscape would make for good times and good music.\n\nHow right they were. At the crest of the musical and social explosion that was the sixties, this contrast between the greatest musicians of their day (and, arguably, any day) and a leisurely mode of travel made for a combustible bell jar that vibrated with artistic camaraderie. They rocked, they rolled, they jammed – all part of a bacchanal that chugged its way across the Canadian Shield and all documented on film.\n\nThe performers were confronted at every concert stop by protesters angry about the $14 ticket price (“Free the music – the music should be free!”) but this did not prevent them giving their all for the thousands who flocked to see them. This never-before-seen footage (in which Willem Poolman, father of producer Gavin Poolman, captured performances both on stage and onboard the train) reminds us of the sheer electricity performers like Joplin were capable of creating.\n\nThe footage was lost in legal proceedings for years, but ninety hours of raw negative and forty hours of uncut sound recording fortuitously found their way to the Budge Crawley vault in the National Archives of Canada. With music mixed by Eddie Kramer (producer of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Santana), Bob Smeaton.s documentary immortalizes performances that – in comparison to those found in the controlled set-ups of most concert films – are unmistakably raw and immediate. Festival Express is more than the sum of its extraordinary parts; it captures a uniquely Canadian experience and the spirit of an age.\n\n–Jane Schoettle………….\n\nIn 1970 a train journeyed across Canada carrying some of the greatest rock bands of all time. Janis Joplin, The Band, The Grateful Dead, Ian & Sylvia, Buddy Guy, Delaney & Bonnie, and others lived (and partied) for five days, giving concerts where and when they stopped. The train was called the Festival Express. Nicknamed the million dollar bash by Rolling Stone Magazine Festival Express was designated to capitalize on then-burgeoning craze for multi-day, talent heavy music festivals. Festival Express was planned as a festival with a difference–it would be portable. This proved to be stamp of genius, indelibly stamping the event with an aura of magic, as a large number of the performers signed on despite being offer fees substantially below their going rate. The musicians thought the train ride sounded like the party to end parties…………\n\nJohn Einarson Loved the festival but it was looooong. My girlfriend and I got there at 8:00 am to wait in line to get a decent spot on the field. The show ran late. I’m pretty sure it was well after 1:00 AM when Joplin finally hit the stage. I was pretty wiped by then. She was worth it, though (Joplin, not my girlfriend). I remember the Grateful Dead being rather “testy” to say the least. When someone in the crowd shouted something to them I’ll never forget Phil Lesh stepping to the mike and replying, “Suck my cock, hard rock!” Yikes. Where’s that San Francisco hippie peace and love fellas?? Buddy Guy had a huge, massive, roadie with a guitar cable that must have been 300 feet long and as Buddy came out into the crowd to play he’d let out more and more cable. Bachman’s appearance was bizarre and shortlived although he later returned to jam with Delaney & Bonnie & Friends. Loved The Band and the Great Speckled Bird. Jerry Garcia from the Dead stood onstage and watched the GSB’s steel player Buddy Cage through their whle set. Eric Andersen and Tom Rush had a tough time holding the crowd’s attention. Mashmakan were cool and “As The Years Go By” went down a storm. Robert Charlebois was bizarre. Leslie West was red hot with Mountain……………..\n\nOn Tuesday, June 30, 1970 the infamous Festival Express train pulled into Union Station (now Via Rail) on Main Street south. The 14-coach private CNR train was a sort of rolling thunder revue crossing Canada with stops for concerts at several key cities. Onboard was the cream of the rock ‘n’ roll scene at that point including Janis Joplin, The Band, Grateful Dead, Delaney & Bonnie, Mountain, Ian & Sylvia and more. As Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart later explained, “Woodstock was a treat for the audience but the train was a treat for the performers.” Indeed, it was.\n\nDubbed the Million Dollar Bash, the tour was the brainchild of promoter Ken Walker and partner Thor Eaton of the wealthy department store family. Costs were pegged at roughly $500,000 with tickets priced around $10. In the end, the tour lost big money, partly due to poor attendance at the Winnipeg concert as well as cost overruns keeping the performers well lubricated on the journey (the train had to make 2 unscheduled stops on the trip to restock the bar).\n\n“One lounge car was for blues and rock and the other was country and folk,” recalls Sylvia Tyson. “There were jam sessions nonstop. The Grateful Dead ran out of other substances around Winnipeg and started drinking and it was not a pretty sight,” she laughs. According to Ian Tyson’s recollections, “I recall getting into a drinking contest with Janis Joplin and I was seriously outmatched. She drank me under the table. I remember me and Jerry Garcia crawling onto the roof of one of these train cars and howling like coyotes.”\n\nInitially conceived with concerts held in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary and concluding in Vancouver, the opening and closing dates were ultimately scuttled due to scheduling problems. Some 37,000 attended the inaugural Toronto event, expanded to 2 days with buses chartered to bring in Montreal ticket-holders, buoying hopes for a financially successful tour. However protests outside the CNE Grandstand by a group calling itself The May 4th Movement (after the Kent State massacre) disrupted festivities forcing an increased police presence and reports of violence. The protesters urged those who could not afford the high prices to storm the gates outside the concert to try to get in for free. Fears of similar violence kept many from attending in Winnipeg as protesters outside the Manisphere (Red River Exhibition) site decried the excessive ticket price. Only 4600 tickets were sold here (20,000 tickets needed to be sold for our show to break even).\n\n“It was ridiculous because it was a cheap ticket price for the top acts in music at that point,” states Sylvia. “The presenters in each city were terrified there was going to be some kind of riot from this May 4th Movement. That had such an adverse affect on the whole thing. The mayor of Calgary got in on the act declaring, ‘Let the children of Calgary in for free’ and Ken Walker said ‘Screw you’ and punching him. Then the manager of the stadium said, ‘I have a solution. We’ll let them in for free but they have to pay to get out!’”\n\nNonetheless, the Winnipeg stopover proved memorable for performers and attendees. Having spent two days partying non-stop on the two lounge cars commandeered for jam sessions, several performers went in search of some local colour. The Grateful Dead and their crew headed to the Pan Am Pool on Grant Avenue where Jerry Garcia organized a relay race between various stoned musicians.\n\nDelaney and Bonnie Bramlett chose to disembark and take a room at the downtown Sheraton Carlton Hotel. Front desk man Brian Levin and fellow Expedition To Earth bandmate Dan Norton took the two performers on a tour of the city. “We spent the day driving around showing them highlights of our Winnipeg,” recalls Dan. “We stopped at the A&W Drive Inn on Portage Avenue across from Polo Park and confused the patrons as we got out and walked around, had our burgers and fries and continued on back to the train to check out what was doing. One of the reasons they were at the Sheraton was Bonnie wanted to protect Delaney from Janis Joplin. Delaney and Bonnie were two of the nicest, most down to earth people that you could ever hope to meet. No pretensions.”\n\nJoplin herself determined to take in the sights. “A few of us got a cab and said, ‘Take us where the freaks are,’” she told Winnipeg Free Press reporter Ken Ingle. “We went to this park and there was an entire beautiful crew of people just lying around and playin’ the guitar.” The carefree ambiance surprised the hard-living singer. “There’s hippies in the fountain and nobody’s bustin’ them. I mean, if you walked into a fountain in New York City, you’d be in jail in five minutes. But there’s forty hippies floundering around in the fountain and standing under the spray.” Festooned in feathers, scarves, garish costume jewelry, and pink sunglasses, Joplin waded into the warm waters under the watchful gaze of the Golden Boy. Few hippies took notice of her.\n\nThat same casual air was also present on the train. “There was no security, no bodyguards, nothing,” recalls Jerry Dykman. “I just walked through the coaches. Nobody stopped me. I was able to chat with everyone. Janis Joplin was there drunk as a skunk, a bottle of tequila in her hand. It was all peace and love.” Local music journalist Andy Mellen also boarded the train and encountered the queen of the hippies. “I sat down with Janis in this empty coach and she poured me a finger of Southern Comfort. I had my tour program with me and I asked Janis to sign the photo of her in it,” he recalls. “She signed it ‘Love, non-professionally, Janis Joplin’. I have that framed on my wall. I was this 20 year old kid and here was this legend. She was so courteous to me.” Three months later Joplin would be dead.\n\nAnother visitor to the train was Randy Bachman, recently departed from the Guess Who. “I was sitting there with Jerry Garcia and other members of the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Delaney & Bonnie and their band, guys from The Band, Leslie West from Mountain. Players would wander in and out, pull up a chair, plug into one of the little amps they had and just pick up on the flow of the ongoing blues jams.” An abstainer, Randy had to deal with the various substances passed around. “I sat by an open window because the smoke was so thick. As the joints were passed around someone would nudge me and offer one. ‘No thanks’ and it would get passed along to the next player. I just wanted to play with anybody.”\n\nThe following afternoon, Canada Day, the performers decamped for the Stadium concert. Ticket-holders began queuing up hours before the 11:00 gate opening then made a dash for a prime spot of the turf to spread out blankets. The concert commenced at 1:00 with local acts Walrus (featuring Joey Gregorash) and Justin Tyme before the headliners took to the stage beginning with Montreal’s Mashmakhan who were enjoying hit status with “As The Years Go By”. Folksingers Tom Rush and Eric Andersen had a tough time soothing the crowd looking to rock. Bluegrass trio James & the Good Brothers had not been together long but managed to earn applause. James was ex-Winnipegger Jim Ackroyd formerly of The Galaxies. Quebecois singer Robert Charlebois tried vainly to stir up the crowd but his set of mainly francophone songs went unappreciated.\n\nBlues guitarist Buddy Guy brought the audience to their feet for a rousing set that included wading into the audience playing his guitar. An enormous roadie in a jumpsuit followed behind letting out what must have been a 100 ft cord. Ian & Sylvia were backed by their recently formed country rock band The Great Speckled Bird featuring guitar virtuosos Amos Garret and Buddy Cage. Throughout their set, Jerry Garcia stood right onstage oblivious to the audience to watch Buddy play his steel guitar. “In Winnipeg some drug-crazed hippie climbed up on the stage and tried to grab N.D. Smart’s drum sticks,” laughs Sylvia. “Big mistake. N.D. put down his sticks, punched him, and went back to playing without missing a beat. By the time we turned around it was all over.”\n\nMountain, led by massive guitarist Leslie West playing a tiny Gibson Les Paul junior guitar, blew the audience away with their powerhouse sound (and earned an ovation introducing Canadian drummer Corky Laing), ending with “Mississippi Queen”. Between changeovers, Randy Bachman wandered out onstage unannounced armed with an acoustic guitar. “I was so nervous that I ended up spelling ‘American Woman’ wrong,” he recalls.” I was doing the ‘I say A, M, E’ intro and I missed a letter. I was going to do a whole mini set but I got so flustered I walked off halfway through. People thought I must be stoned but I was just out of my element.” He later returned to jam with Delaney & Bonnie whose raucous R ‘n’ B set was punctuated by the singing of Happy Birthday to Delaney.\n\nSome of The Grateful Dead were not in a friendly mood and at one point uttered a profanity-laced invective aimed at an audience member. But as Chris Doole recalls, “When the Dead performed ‘Alligator’ it got into this groove where it started to sound like 25 perfectly synchronized locomotives with Garcia’s tasty little trills on top of it all. Everyone’s attention was just nailed to it.”\n\nIt was past midnight by the time The Band and Joplin each mounted the stage and some concert goers had already left. Looking like rustic mountain men, The Band played an exceptional set drawing from their first two albums along with a few old chestnuts including Little Richard’s “Slippin’ & Slidin’”. Garth Hudson’s elongated organ intro to “Chest Fever” drew on several old hymns and was mesmerizing. Backed by The Full Tilt Boogie Band (consisting of mostly Canadians), Joplin rocked hard and won over the weary crowd. “I remember she said, ‘You guys certainly know how to throw a … train’” recalls Chris Doole.\n\nA brazen young man managed to amble onstage near the end of her set. “How about a kiss for the boys from Manitoba?” he queried. Smiling, Joplin consented. As he turned to leave, the young man thanked the stagehands. “Why are you thanking them, honey?” sassed Joplin, “They didn’t do nothing for you!”\n\n“Everyone on that train was at their peak,” notes Sylvia Tyson. “The Band was at their best and Janis, too. She was just coming into her own as the singer she really was just before she died.”\n\nThe following morning, after another night of partying and jamming, the train slowly pulled out of Union Station bound for Calgary and the final concert. “I knew a girl who was at the Winnipeg concert,” remembers Hilary Chase, “who ran up to the stage at some point, was noticed by guys in Janis Joplin’s band and ended up travelling to Calgary with them on the train.”\n\n“It’s amazing,” concludes one local observer ruefully, “that anyone can remember anything about that event by the amount of drugs and alcohol that was digested both by fans and performers.”\n\nJohn Einarson /Winnipeg Boomer Magazine August 2012…………\n\nFESTIVAL EXPRESS is a rousing record of a little-known, but monumental, moment in rock n’ roll history, starring such music legends as Janis Joplin, The Band, and the Grateful Dead.\n\nSet in 1970, FESTIVAL EXPRESS was a multi-band, multi-day extravaganza that captured the spirit and imagination of a generation and a nation. What made it unique was that it was portable; for five days, the bands and performers lived, slept, rehearsed and did countless unmentionable things aboard a customized train that traveled from Toronto, to Calgary, to Winnipeg, with each stop culminating in a mega-concert. The entire experience, both off-stage and on, was filmed but the extensive footage remained locked away – until now. A momentous achievement in rock film archeology, FESTIVAL EXPRESS combines this long-lost material with contemporary interviews nearly 35 years after it was first filmed.\n\nFESTIVAL EXPRESS has been described as the greatest and longest non-stop party in the history of rock n’ roll, and that is exactly what promoters Ken Walker and Thor Eaton imagined when they first conceived the event. They wanted to create a setting that would be irresistible to the talent they hoped to attract. They rented a train, named it the “Festival Express,” and, using the Orient Express as their model, stocked the dining car with food and drink that would be available to night owl musicians twenty-four hours a day.\n\nParticipating musicians thought the novel idea of the train ride sounded like “the party to end all parties” and many signed on at fees far below their going rate just to join the ride. Once they boarded the train, they never wanted to get off. Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead described the FESTIVAL EXPRESS as “a train of insane people careening across the Canadian countryside, making music night and day and then occasionally we’d get off the train to go play a concert.”\n\nAs the train rambled along for five days, it presented a unique opportunity for musicians such as Joplin, Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, Rick Danko of The Band, Delaney and Bonnie and Ian and Sylvia, Buddy Guy, and New Riders of the Purple Sage to collaborate. When they played traditional concerts, musical acts would rarely overlap because they were on staggered schedules. The train ride gave them a chance to party, and more importantly, to play music, together. Mickey Hart, drummer for the Grateful Dead, recalls that, “Everything was constantly revolving. There was a blues car, a country car, a rock and roll car. It was like musical chairs. There was never anything like that level of talent and musicianship encapsulated in such close quarters for that length of time.” As the trip progressed and the jam sessions lasted until the wee hours of the morning, the musicians began playing each other’s music. There was so much going on all the time that Buddy Guy admitted, “Every time I went to bed I was afraid I would miss something.” “It was fusion,” says Hart, “all these different kinds of players playing each other’s music. Here’s Buddy Guy playing country, Janis singing Canadian folk…” The trip even resulted in at least one famous song about the FESTIVAL EXPRESS, the Grateful Dead’s “Might As Well.”\n\nFESTIVAL EXPRESS provides an unusually intimate look at two of the film’s most legendary musicians, Jerry Garcia and Janis Joplin. There would be no “next time” for Joplin. Her life ended tragically just two months later. But while she is on the “Festival Express,” Joplin is relaxed and at the top of her game. Her performances, as documented by Peter Biziou, have never been shown in their entirety, or blown-up digitally with Dolby digital sound, making FESTIVAL EXPRESS a rare and powerful experience for Joplin fans. The Village Voice said, “This is by far the most vivid evidence of her presence ever committed to film.”\n\nThe film offers a remarkably personal look at Jerry Garcia, too. His delight in playing music – any kind of music – becomes apparent as he is photographed jamming with one group after another. “Jerry was the natural-born ringmaster of that three-ringed dream train,” recalls Buddy Guy. When asked about his experiences on the train, Garcia said “That was the best time I’ve had in rock and roll. It was the musicians’ train. There wasn’t any showbiz bullshit. It was like a musicians’ convention with no public allowed.”\n\nThere were times when it made sense to keep the public at bay. Ironically, most of the performers were not big drinkers: they were more experienced with other recreational substances that were impossible to import to Canada. Alcohol became the “high” of choice and a few days into the cross-country trip, the FESTIVAL EXPRESS ran out of supplies. The non-stop party – dubbed the “Million Dollar Bash” by Rolling Stone magazine – threatened to come to a grinding halt. But festival organizers came up with a quick and effective solution that has been described as a cross between the Marx Brothers and “Spinal Tap”, with a touch of “A Hard Day’s Night”. They literally stopped the train at a liquor store and reloaded, even walking off with a giant display bottle of Canadian Club. Erik Andersen, who was part of the FESTIVAL EXPRESS tour, is still somewhat incredulous as he recalls the moment. “They just stopped in Saskatoon,” he said. “The whole damn train just stopped like, in front of a liquor store.” Anything to keep the talent happy. And happy they were., Calgary, the last stop, the artists knew that they had shared a once-in-a-lifetime experience. One musician said, “It was a brief moment in time when everybody came together for one last time to celebrate that utopian vision we all started with.” And amazingly, that “brief moment” was captured on film. But, adding even more value to the experience, the footage – 75 hours of negative – was lost or overlooked for decades.\n\nBy the time the traveling concert came to an end, the promoters were feuding with Willem Poolman, the principal producer of the original planned film, and there was no one in charge of the production. The footage was scattered across parts of Canada and beyond, with unpaid cameramen taking portions as leverage and promoters taking reels as mementos. Work prints were stored in Poolman’s garage, where they survived severe Canadian winters, a fire, and being used as ice hockey goals by young Gavin Poolman and his friend, John Trapman. Bill O’Farrell, a young man involved with the original production, took whatever reels he could gather from various sources and drove them to the doorstep of the Canadian National Archives in Ottawa, with the caveat that they should hold on to them as “they will be worth something one day.”\n\nThe reels remained at the Archives for nearly 25 years, until a young music aficionado and documentary filmmaker named Garth Douglas and his friend James Cullingham – who long heard rumors of a filmed “Canadian Woodstock” – put out feelers to anyone and everyone who had information about the lost film. After some initial false leads, Douglas tracked down the footage at the Canadian National Archives. However, it took almost another ten years to finish the film, sync the audio, clear the performance rights, and shoot contemporary interviews to accompany the historic footage and fuse it together to create a truly amazing piece of rock n’ roll history.\n\n“Making FESTIVAL EXPRESS was like being handed a giant jigsaw puzzle, minus the lid to the box that shows the picture of how the film was meant to look,” says director Bob Smeaton. As each piece was put in place, the picture became clearer. Fortunately, he was working with remarkable raw material that was in excellent condition. FESTIVAL EXPRESS was shot in cinema verite style and edited in keeping with the time period in which it was filmed. This includes the use of split-screens, allowing the best possible use of so many hours of footage.\n\nOf the 75 hours of negative shot, 46 hours remained, of which 15 hours had never been printed. “One of the interesting things for me technically was the negative had been printed only once in 1971, and then it just sat in a film vault – perfectly stored at the right temperature and humidity,” producer Gavin Poolman explains. “What we had was the perfect negative.”\n\nThe producers’ first impulse was to try to make the film look modern. They changed their minds after seeing some tests. “We decided that this approach made the film lose its magic,” exlplains Poolman. “What we have on this negative is something nobody else can get. People pay a fortune to try to get their films to look like this and we actually have it. The colors are perfect, but they are the colors of the time.” Smeaton adds, “The original 16mm footage was blown up to 35mm. Peter Biziou, who had been the director of photography on the film, was a great help during the blow up and grading stage of the process. He insisted, and rightly so, that we retain the original look of the old 16mm stock and not try to make it appear too modern. This way, we were able to create a film that looked exactly the way it would have had it been completed in 1970.”\n\nThe footage is among the very first to document musicians’ lives, both on and off stage, for such an extended and continuous period of time, and offers glimpses of a lifestyle perhaps never to be seen again. Contemporary, first-person interviews with a selection of the musicians, crew, and even some of the music lovers who were there, provide a unique insight into what may have been the last great rock n’ roll ride.\n\nAccording to Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead, “That train was buzzing down the rails. We achieved lift off for sure.”\n\nFilm Songs\n\n1. Grateful Dead Casey Jones\n\n2. Grateful Dead Don’t Ease Me In\n\n3. Grateful Dead Friend of the Devil\n\n4. The Band Slippin’ and Slidin’\n\n5.
