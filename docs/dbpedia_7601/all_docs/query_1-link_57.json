For Bruce Good, his twin brother Brian and guitarist James Ackroyd, it was their first tour, a journey that kicked off a lifetime of adventures in music.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThe Good, the Dead and Janis: Brothers remember a special train ride Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

You literally bump into people. It was an incredible experience, and they had it set up really great: there were actual jamming cars where you could go in and play music when you’re rolling along.”\n\nIn one of those jamming cars, the Goods sat down to play with Garcia, the iconic Dead leader. Bruce immediately warmed to him.\n\n“I gotta say I wasn’t a Grateful Dead fan back in those days,” he recalls. “It was later when I really got into their music and realized that a lot of their rock ‘n roll was really rootsy stuff.\n\n“On the train, when we sat down and played bluegrass music with Jerry, I thought, ‘I like this guy.’ He wasn’t just stuck on rock ‘n roll. He played all types of music and he really loved bluegrass music. He was a good guy. He was honest with his music.”\n\nThe Goods also became friends with Janis Joplin, often hanging out with the flamboyant singer when the train made its stops. They would dine together and go shopping.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I tell you, when Janis wasn’t on stage, she was still Janis,” Bruce recalls. “She still had the boa and the pink sunglasses walking down the street. You knew it was Janis Joplin. She certainly didn’t slip into something a little more incognito. She was a ‘here I am’ kind of girl. It was very cool.”\n\nLess than a year later, the Goods were devastated to hear of Joplin’s death; sad but honoured when they were invited to perform at a celebration of her life.\n\nFestival Express was a turning point for the Goods. After the trip, the Dead invited them to San Francisco to record an album in their studio. They took them up on it. James and the Goods’ self-titled, major-label debut was released in 1971, and included contributions by various members of the Dead.\n\nJames and the Goods spent a few more months touring California until the twins decided it was time to head back to their wives and children in Ontario (Bruce’s sons, Travis and Dallas, grew up to form their own band, the Sadies). James, who was single, stayed in the U.S.\n\nBack home, there was a shift in musical direction when the twins’ banjo-playing younger brother, Larry, joined the lineup. Inspired by Garcia, as well as the bluegrass music their mom loved, the Goods scaled back the country-rock and became more rootsy.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“We kinda evolved after James left, we started playing more country and bluegrass,” Bruce says. “There were other times in our career we had keyboards and saxophones and a full drum kit and the whole nine yards on our stage. The music has evolved as we went along: it got to a peak and sorta got right back home again.”\n\nThe three Good brothers are still trucking along, their sibling harmonies and fine picking featured at fairs and festivals across Canada.They also tour extensively in the United States and Europe, with their 38th tour of Europe scheduled later this year.\n\nOn the recording front, a new deal with an independent L.A.-based label led the Goods to record a couple of radio-friendly new songs that are scheduled to be released this year. Bruce isn’t expecting the tunes to set the world on fire — after all, country music is a youngster’s game right now, he observes – but there’s nothing to lose.\n\n“We took our music out of the kitchen of our home to places we never dreamt it would go, all around the world. We got a lot more out of it than we ever expected to get. We weren’t sitting there saying we wanna be a rock star or a country star,” he says.\n\n“We just wanted to play music because it was fun to do. To get paid for it, was a huge plus. Somebody asked us why we still do it. And I say, ‘that’s just what we do.’ As long as people want to hear our music, we’ll play it.”\n\nGood Brothers\n\nWhen: Jan. 24 at 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: North on 29, 7109 Country Rd. 29 S, Carleton Place\n\nWhen: Jan. 25 at 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Neat Cafe, Burnstown, Ont.\n\nTickets: $35 for each concert, available through neatfood.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
