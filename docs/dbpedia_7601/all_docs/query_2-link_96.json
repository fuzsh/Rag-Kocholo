As part of this work, we commit to learning and growing alongside other festivals on how to create more inclusive experiences that demonstrate in action (and don’t just say) we want you to feel comfortable to enjoy our incredible artists and extended community.\n\nA Note On Eligibility\n\nWe will **never** ask for proof of a disability or accommodation request. That being said, it is not acceptable to fake or exaggerate a disability to receive an accommodation. We are a small team run by volunteers and the magic of Newport is our ability to show up as our most supportive, present, and kind selves. This extends to our Accessibility work too.\n\nAccessibility Wristbands\n\nTo gain access to the Accessibility Services at the festival you will be required to register for a specific wristband. Patrons can be accompanied by a plus one companion if needed (Festival ticket needed for entry). You can either register in advance to get this wristband using this REGISTRATION FORM LINK or sign up on site at the Accessibility Hub located at the festival. Once you arrive at the festival, you may pick up your wristband at the Accessibility Hub. Registering for a wristband also allows you to add one additional person in your party to have a wristband during your time at the festival.\n\nAccessibility-Specific Areas\n\nThe Accessibility Hub – New to the Festivals in 2024, this hub will be a specific tent that offers shade, water, bathroom access, charging for mobility devices, and Accessibility-specific volunteers to assist with anything you might otherwise need.\n\nHarbor and Quad stages – As in previous years, we will have chairs specific to people in need of accommodations. The only way a patron may enter these areas is with a wristband. We cannot guarantee that there will always be seats available. Additionally, please do not “save” chairs so that other guests may come and go like any other part of the festival.\n\nFort Stage – An area at the Fort Stage is reserved for our patrons with accessibility needs. Seating is located in a roped off area to the side of the sound board. This area is accessible by a paved road from the event entrance. Because space is limited, each patron is allowed one guest to accompany. Seating is not provided in this area so guests should bring lawn chairs.\n\nNote: The wristband does not guarantee a spot in these areas. Please note that viewing areas have a limited capacity and are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Once it’s determined that an accessible viewing area is filled to capacity (including adequate aisle space for entering and exiting the area), the area will not be available for additional entry.\n\nAccessible Bathrooms – There will be accessible bathrooms as part of all Restroom areas stationed around the festival. Additionally, there will be one bathroom next to our Accessibility Hub with a restricted entrance.\n\nMobility Devices\n\nThe Newport Festival site is designed to be accessible to any mobility aids that a patron might require. It is also a Fort built over 175 years ago and so we hope like all attendees that you’ll have some grace and patience as you figure out how to navigate our unique layout. If you have specific needs that you would like to discuss prior to the festival, please reach out to us at accessibility@newportfestivals.org.\n\nRouting – The bulk of the festival grounds is grass with some portions paved. We have volunteer ushers stationed around the festival to keep paved pathways as free for movement as possible. For the areas that require moving across grass, we use accessible pathing for wheelchairs. If you are having a particular issue navigating to a location, please let a member of our team know!\n\nCharging – We will have a power bank at our Accessibility Hub if your mobility device needs to be recharged. Please bring your own charging devices and ensure that they are compatible with a 110-volt, 20-amp circuit.\n\nAcceptable Devices – We do not restrict your mobility device if it is what you use to navigate your daily life. Please exercise caution though with patrons, particularly in crowded areas, as we do not want anyone to get hurt.\n\nParking\n\nParking for patrons with disabilities is located within a designated lot. The standard parking fee applies. When entering Fort Adams State Park, vehicles with patrons needing access to this lot must show their ADA license plate, placard or other state-issued identification. The holder of the placard or identification must be a passenger in the vehicle. There will be a shuttle bus fitted with a wheelchair accessible lift to bring patrons from the parking lot directly to the event entrance, running from 9am until the end of the day. Violation of any ADA placard or license carries a fine of up to $500.\n\nVerification – In order to use these spaces, you must have a government-issued placard. If you are traveling from out-of-state, please bring your placard with you if you’ll be using a vehicle that is not your own.\n\nAccessible Parking Shuttles – We will have Accessible-Parking specific shuttles to/from the festival entrance. These shuttles will be equipped with lifts and tie-downs for wheelchairs and our shuttle drivers will be trained on how to use them. We do not allow people to be dropped off at the entrance for security reasons.\n\nAccessible Van Parking – In addition to our designated parking spaces, we will have available Accessible Van spaces for vans that come equipped with their own lifts.\n\nAccommodations\n\nParking for patrons with disabilities is located within a designated lot. The standard parking fee applies. When entering Fort Adams State Park, vehicles with patrons needing access to this lot must show their ADA license plate, placard or other state-issued identification. The holder of the placard or identification must be a passenger in the vehicle. There will be a shuttle bus fitted with a wheelchair accessible lift to bring patrons from the parking lot directly to the event entrance, running from 9am until the end of the day. Violation of any ADA placard or license carries a fine of up to $500.\n\nService Animals – As animal lovers, we appreciate that many of our patrons think of their pets as members of their family. Despite this, we have to follow very strict rules when it comes to service animals at Newport Festivals in order to maintain a safe festival for all.\n\nNewport Folk Festival allows ADA* recognized service animals trained specifically to assist a person with disabilities at all events. Animals whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA and are not permitted at the festivals. You will be required to have your service animal with you at all times. Under the ADA, service animals must be harnessed, leashed or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal’s work or the individual’s disability prevents using these devices. You are solely responsible for the safety of your service animal and the safety of others around your animal. You will be responsible for cleaning up any solid waste.\n\n*Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the definition of “service animal” is limited to a dog (or pony) that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability who is in attendance. The task(s) performed by the dog must be directly related to the person’s disability. Under the ADA, “comfort,” “therapy” or “emotional support animals” do not meet the definition of a service animal. – U.S. Dept. of Justice\n\nConcessions: Our team has intentionally curated the available concessions to ensure that almost any dietary need can be met. If you have allergy concerns it is best to ask the individual vendor.\n\nMedical: We have a first aid station with trained staff available at the festival. They will be marked on a map and our team members at our Accessibility Hub can direct/accompany you in case you need help. In the case of an emergency, it is best to simultaneously contact 911 and have someone nearby immediately alert a member of our festival staff.\n\nASL Interpreters/Assisted Listening Devices: Unfortunately at this time we do not offer this option for 2024 but hope to bring this service to you in the near future.\n\nAdditional Services/Feedback: The world of accommodation requests is constantly changing and so we are more than happy to consider any request you have either to be met this year or in future years. The best way for you to ensure someone hears your suggestions is either by emailing accessibility@newportfestivals.org or by talking to a member of our Accessibility team at the Accessibility Hub."
