        "text": "In 1970 a train journeyed across Canada carrying some of the greatest rock bands of all time. The Grateful Dead along with Janis Joplin, The Band and many others lived (and partied) for five days, giving concerts where and when they stopped. The train was called the Festival Express. This rock-filled documentary combines live footage shot during the concerts, as well as footage aboard the train itself, interspersed with present-day interviews with tour participants sharing their often humorous recollections of those crazy days."
