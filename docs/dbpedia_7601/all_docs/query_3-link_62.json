In the summer of 1970, a chartered train crossed Canada carrying some of the world's greatest rock bands. The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, The Band, Buddy Guy, and others lived (and partied) together for five days, stopping in major cities along the way to play live concerts. Their journey was filmed.",

        "text": "“It was a brief moment where everybody came together for one last time to celebrate that utopian vision we started with.”\n\nIf I had the opportunity to go back to one music festival, this very well might be my pick. It is hard to fathom the idea of all of these incredible musicians of the time taking a train across Canada together and performing a few shows in between their free collaboration (and partying) on that train. But it happened. And we have footage of it.\n\nFestival Express is gorgeously filmed stage performances, incredibly intimate footage from the train, all weaved together with recollections from those on that train.\n\nIt takes you on the train, to the shows, everywhere- you feel like…\n\nThe 60s were indeed a different time. In addition to sex, drugs, and rock and roll, the decade offered a spirit of freedom, a period of extreme indulgence, and a sense of community—at least among those who thought alike. It is a period both easy to romanticize and to ridicule. The rockumentary Festival Express captures some of the joys and excesses of the time.\n\nIn the summer of 1970, as much of what has come to be associated with the 60s continued spilling over into the new decade, promoters Ken Walker and Thor Eaton hired a train, called the Festival Express, to take a group of musicians on a three-city, five-day tour of Canada. Festival Express consists of highlights of…\n\nI L<3ve Musicals!\n\nOne for those of us who loved Woodstock and Murray Lerner's Isle of Wight Festival films, this is mainly worth watching for the force of nature that is Janis Joplin in the last few months of her short life (this is June/July 1970, she died in October).\n\nA series of festivals across Canada were planned with the performers travelling between cities by train (hence the name Festival Express).\n\nSo although a large chunk of this film is on stage performances from people who might have slipped from the litany of popular music, there are also travelling jams and the obligatory talking heads reflecting back on the tour.\n\nWithout the big names you may have seen on similar…\n\nWell this is highly underwhelming. In 1970, a bunch of rock and psychedelic heavyweights travelled across Canada by train, partying hand, jamming endlessly and playing three huge open-air shows along the way. Stuck in a vault for 30 years, footage of the venture was eventually spruced up and edited into a movie which went over big with the classic rock crowd. But while there are some incredible things in Festival Express, this frustrating, disjointed documentary is neither one thing or another, an unfortunate and shambolic melange of short-sighted social document, hagiography, backstage musical, corporate statement and concert film.\n\nThe good stuff is mostly on stage: the Grateful Dead doing an impromptu Friend of the Devil free in a park (a…"
