        "text": "Our terrific local Bryn Mawr Film Institute (every town should have one!) screened \"Festival Express\" last night, documenting the Summer 1970 Toronto-Winnipeg-Calgary train excursion of, among others, the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Buddy Guy, Flying Burrito Brothers, The Band. \"The festival comes to you\" sort of idea. Not a great film in my opinion, and the ugly vibes of Altamont 8 months earlier hang over the backstory - there's even Sam Cutler again, trying to calm the \"revolutionaries\" demanding free music. And regrettably a lot of the music footage suffers from the 1970 \"extreme close-up-and-oh-it's-nighttime-we-should-have-brought-some-lights\" syndrome. So with the exception of The Band & Levon, who gets to fill the screen from behind his kit, you had to struggle to grab a view of the drums & drummers.\n\nBut in any event, what I saw included\n\nGrateful Dead - curiously, the Toronto stop only has Bill on stage, the Calgary video has Bill & Mickey. Bill is playing a red sparkle Rogers kit (2 up, 1 down; could not catch if it was a 12 & a 13 or two 12s). Mickey is playing a champagne sparkle Rogers kit (also 2 up 1 down).\n\nThe Band - Levon has his vintage single tension wood kit with matching snare with thumb screws on the reso side. I never noticed before how much Levon's riding on the cymbal to left of rack tom relies on his beautiful 'windshield-washer' sweeping back and forth. Elegant.\n\nBuddy Guy Band - Did not catch name of his drummer as credits rolled. Kit looked to be either a MIJ 2 up 1 down, or perhaps a Slingerland as dbl tom tilter looked like that old single ratchet/spade Slingerland mount. Lighting did not allow for a guess at color.\n\nBurritos - Rogers 4-piece kit in black onyx. Might have been 20-12-14, drummer did not get much coverage, so hard to tell. There was a lot of turnover in the FBB so I'm not sure which drummer this was\n\nJoplin's Full Tilt Boogie Band - Clark Pierson looked to be playing a champagne sparkle Gretsch 4-piece kit - also did not get much screen time, so hard to catch.\n\nOn the train but not in the film\n\nJim Gordon w/ Delaney & Bonnie\n\nCorky Lang w/Mountain\n\nThe youtube link above seems to be to the entire film, if a bit fuzzy, so maybe some of the DFO folks will fill in some more details.\n\nThere was a thread here some time ago about how drummers tend to hear the drums when listening to music; I guess the video analogue is waiting for the camera to cut away from the singer and show the band. Fortunately many drummers set up behind the lead singer, so sometimes we get lucky. (There must be a gazillion photos of Springsteen on stage all of which include Max right behind him.)"
