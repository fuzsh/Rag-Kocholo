        "text": "In 1970, a collection of the most revered alternative rock bands -- including the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, The Band, Buddy Guy and the Flying Burrito Brothers -- set out on a five-day concert tour. Starting in Toronto, the bands traveled east-to-west across Canada in a luxury train nicknamed the \"Festival Express.\" What took place in those boxcars has since been described as the \"greatest and longest nonstop party in the history of rock and roll,\" while the tour itself is regarded as a \"Canadian Woodstock.\" Much of what ensued both on and off the Festival Express -- from the artists' alcohol binges and jam sessions to impassioned concert performances by Joplin and Jerry Garcia -- was caught on film. But despite an all-star lineup and a unique mode of transportation, Festival Express has been one of the more obscure events in rock and roll history.\n\nNow, thanks to director Rob Smeaton, audiences can see what unfolded in the course of those five days in 1970. Composed of original footage of the tour -- most of which had been collecting dust in the Canadian National Archives for about 25 years -- Smeaton's Festival Express is a panoramic yet straightforward documentary. In a summer where nonfiction pieces have become political weapons, Festival Express simply presents facts, film, and random interviews, letting audiences draw their own conclusions. And believe me, it's a soothing alternative to the attacks leveled by Bush's Brain, Out-foxed and, of course, Moore's cogent Fahrenheit 9/11.\n\nAt times, Festival Express runs like a concert video punctuated by minimal commentary. Smeaton's film focuses on the artists' set pieces just as much as, if not more than, their post-performance activities. After a while, it becomes evident that Festival Express is a movie by rock aficionados for rock aficionados. For example, Smeaton, a two-time Grammy winner, enlisted producer Eddie Kramer, who had worked with Santana, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix, to mix the film's music. All of the footage has been presented in its original form, which gives Festival Express a gritty, down-to-earth feel that underscores its time and setting.\n\nTo say the least, it is enlightening, if not overwhelming, to watch Garcia's mellow, inspired guitar playing and Joplin's anguished, uninhibited ballads. But Festival Express is at its most winning when it moves from the stage to the events that took place on the train itself. For the artists, the Festival Express -- termed the \"million-dollar bash\" by Rolling Stone -- was a near-utopia.\n\nAt the end of each concert, the groups could retreat to a world of custom-prepared food, hallucinogen-laced alcohol and endless jam sessions. Audiences will be happy to know that some truly revealing and amusing moments -- including an inebriated sing-along with Joplin and Garcia, a massive alcohol run on a track-side liquor store, and a number of disgruntled musings on crowd control -- were captured on the Festival Express' candid camera.\n\nDespite the merits of Smeaton's film, any rock scholar expecting new, ground-breaking insights will be sorely disappointed. It is true that Festival Express puts a microscope to its subjects, particularly Garcia and Joplin. But at the end of the reel, Janis is still the free-wheeling folk genius that we recognize and Jerry is still the gregarious, creative frontman for the Grateful Dead. Its view of '70s culture is perhaps an even huger nihil novi. Of course, there are the bizarre crowd-control shots, gyrating hippie, and inane declarations from the far, far left about the evils of commercialism. Unlike the summer's other notable rockumentary, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, Festival Express does not shoot for any level of psychological insight or iconoclastic thought. Presenting the facts seems to be enough.\n\nBut what we do get from Festival Express is the unshakable impression that the Dead, Joplin, Buddy Guy and the Band lived in a world quite removed from today's manufactured pop landscape. There is, in their music, a genuine feel and a sense of vitality that rock and roll may never resurrect. To listen to these bands is one thing but to watch Joplin blast audiences with raw emotion, to view Guy's soulful performances, to look on as the Garcia unloads melodies from every genre known to modern guitar -- that is an entirely different experience.\n\nRegardless of all that it had to offer, the actual Festival Express tour was a commercial disaster. At many concerts, disenchanted fans protested the $14 admission fee, storming arenas and claiming that they should be allowed entrance free of charge. In retrospect, it seems ludicrous that anyone would protest paying such a low price, especially when most people today would have offered up a small fortune to have seen that same lineup. At least now audiences have a way to re-live the tour that almost disappeared from the face of rock and roll history. Even this film is worth a lot more than a $14 ticket."
