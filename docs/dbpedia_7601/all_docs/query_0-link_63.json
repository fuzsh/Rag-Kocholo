        "text": "Festivals Acadiens et Créoles announced the music lineup for the 50th annual three-day FREE Cajun and Zydeco music festival, which will take place Friday, Oct. 11, Saturday, Oct. 12, and Sunday, Oct. 13, at Girard Park in Lafayette.\n\nTo mark its 50th anniversary, Festivals will kick off with an exciting Friday night lineup featuring performances that pay homage to the inaugural event at Blackham Coliseum in 1974. The organizers have arranged a special tribute to the first concert, with family members and local musicians taking the stage to perform songs originally played at the very first event by Cajun and Zydeco music legends such as the Balfa Brothers, Nathan Abshire, Dennis McGee, Marc Savoy, the Ardoin Family, and Clifton Chenier.\n\n\"Reaching this pivotal milestone of 50 years really speaks volumes about the contributions this festival has made to preserving and nurturing our Cajun and Creole traditions,\" says Patrick Mould, VP of Programming and Development. \"I am especially excited about the Friday night concert that will pay homage to the standing-room-only 1974 Tribute to Cajun Music at Blackham Coliseum, which evolved into Festivals Acadiens et Créoles. This year's theme, '50 Years and Tomorrow,' will highlight how we have successfully passed down our traditions—whether our music, food, art, or French language—one generation at a time!\"\n\nFestivals Acadiens et Créoles has published One Generation at a Time: Celebrating 50 Years of a Cajun and Creole Music Festival. Center for Louisiana Studies will host interactive workshops and performances, and the Bayou Food Festival and Louisiana Crafts Fair will showcase the best local cuisine and crafts. Each day, Festivals Acadiens et Créoles will broadcast live for fans worldwide via KRVS.org.\n\nThe Official Pin and Poster will be revealed at the Acadiana Center for the Arts on September 14 at 6:00 p.m. during Downtown Lafayette’s Second Saturday ArtWalk. Megan Barra is the 2024 festival visual artist.\n\nTent rental spaces in Girard Park are available for Festival goers, Festival Friends are also appreciated, and volunteers are needed over the three days.
