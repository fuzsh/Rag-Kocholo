        "text": "Folks, If this has been posted already I apologize. Last night I saw the Festival Express. Highly recommended. The film is grainy, the acoustics are only fair, but the scenes with Janis and the Band are incredible. Go see it if it comes to your area.\n\nI took in a screening last week. Terrific movie. Janis is electrifying. I only wish the film was longer, I'd love to see more footage. Here's hoping for an expanded DVD release sometime soon.\n\nIf you get a chance, go see it!\n\nThe tour came to my hometown, Winnipeg, Manitoba. I was too young to see the concert. My parents didn't let me go to shows until a year or two later. Had an original poster on my bedroom wall for about 10 years. Wish I saved it.\n\nFestival Express was a tour that took place shortly after Woodstock. Janis, The Dead, The Band, Buddy Guy, Ian & Sylvia (featuring Buddy Cage on steel guitar!) and many more!! The tour was a financial disaster, but the musicians didn't seem to care. They were having so much fun on the train that the gigs seemed almost an afterthought.\n\nIt's a really good documentary, but the first five notes of Janis's Cry Baby are worth the price of admission alone!!\n\nWoodstock On Wheels is a good description. The official Festival Express website is excellent and has the basic background on the tour;\n\nwww.festivalexpress.com\n\nThere is also an article at the San Francisco Chronicle's web site detailing all the legal problems that the tour and the film went through over the years.\n\nhttp://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/07/12/DDGHK7JAR91.DTL\n\nAnd by the way, the film is great! I hope the upcoming DVD will have additional performance tracks. A commentary track by the musicians would be interesting, too.\n\nDuring that era there was a lot of debate that music should be free (nothing's changed today). There was even a semi-organized group who's goal was to get in to the concert for free. I recall bands of kids trying to climb the barb wire fence at the Toronto concert. Police on horseback charged the crowds in an effort to disperse them. The demonstrations followed the tour from city to city. Great concerts though! IMO one of the great unheralded festivals now finally getting some recognition.\n\nFrom a local newspaper article.\n\nI gotta see this movie! And buy the (hopefully available soon) DVD!\n\nDoug, You should not see this film the first time in a download, go to the movies.\n\nThink Doug was talking about the Times article costing $$ to download.\n\nIt's funny how back then, people were happy to pay for records but thought that concerts should be free. Now, people are happy to pay $100 or more for a concert ticket, but think downloading records should be free.\n\nThe Dead's on stage performances were good, but the best part was when they had them on the train jamming especially Jerry. He looks so young in this film.\n\nWho are you, Andy Rooney?\n\nYou're right, though, it's an interesting point.\n\nthe 2 disc DVD came out yesterday. I picked it up at Best Buy on sale for 19.99 at lunch today and can't wait to go home and see it. I've been reading about it for years, and missed it in the theaters."
