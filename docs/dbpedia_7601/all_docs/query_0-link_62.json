        "text": "Every year, Musikfest comes around to Bethlehem, giving both big-name musicians and relative unknowns an opportunity to take the stage and share their art with close to 1 million festival goers over 11 days.\n\nThe festival kicked off with a preview night on Aug. 1 and continues through Aug. 11 at venues on both Bethlehem’s northside and the SteelStacks campus on the Southside.\n\nEveryone has their own favorite genre when it comes to music and is likely to spectate certain shows that align with their preferred genre. If you’re not sure what artists you should gravitate toward, these friendly suggestions may help guide you along.\n\nLehighvalleylive.com will be publishing this daily guide each day of Musikfest 2024. Two notes: 1.) We focused on the free stage shows. If you’re reading this, chances are you already know what kind of music you’re getting with each ticketed headliner show. 2.) This is a subjective sampling of some offerings each day. Refer to the Musikfest website for a complete daily schedule.\n\nAug. 7\n\nWednesday will bring another full schedule of musical acts.\n\nSafiyah Hernandez | 9 p.m., Highmark Blue Shield Community Stage\n\nSafiyah Hernandez is a great option for those looking for a break from the standard covers to hear something unique and original. The singer’s voice and delivery share some of the same qualities as Lorde. Her piano-driven ballads would probably also appeal to fans of Norah Jones. And her lyrics, particularly on songs like “9pm” and “Mars,” draw from sharp imagery and clever metaphors.\n\nArtist’s site: Safiyah Hernandez\n\nThe Aw Shucks Corn Eating Competition | 7 p.m., PNC Stadtplatz\n\nThere’s nothing musical about this event other than it’s happening at Musikfest, but we’d be remiss if we didn’t steer you in the direction of The Aw Shucks Corn Eating Competition. For the uninitiated, Aw Shucks corn on the cob is perhaps the most recognizable food item sold at Musikfest. Participants will compete to see who can be the fastest to eat five ears of corn. The winner gets $100. Seems like it could be highly entertaining.\n\nShwayze | 9:30 p.m., Air Products Americaplatz at Levitt Pavilion SteelStacks\n\nShwayze’s 2008 breakout “Buzzin” brought the rapper-musician enough acclaim to earn him and singer-producer Cisco Adler a spot on the Vans Warped Tour. That single, featuring generous acoustic guitar, is indicative of some of Schwayze’s later, genre-bending work with other collaborators. Much of it is catchy and should please the ears of most mainstream hip-hop fans.\n\nArtist’s site: Shwayze"
