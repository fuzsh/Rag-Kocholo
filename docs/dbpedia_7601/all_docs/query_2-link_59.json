        "text": "COVID-19 is an extremely contagious disease that can lead to severe illness and death. There is an inherent and elevated risk of exposure to COVID-19 in any public place or place where people are present and there is no guarantee, express or implied, that those attending the festival will not be exposed to COVID-19\n\nFestival now operates with a cashless payment system using RFID wristbands. This means you will use a digital wallet (your wristband) for all Festival food, beverages and Festival merchandise. Load your wristbands up with funds via our Festival app OR in person at Festival at a Wristband Registration tent.\n\n*You can add funds to your wristband with cash or card, your choice.\n\n*Get the full RFID wristband rundown here.\n\n*View our site map for ATM locations\n\n*Art vendors accept cards and cash. They do not operate with our RFID wristbands.\n\nThere are many ways to show Festival support! If you love Festival, please consider donating to help secure the event's future. Click HERE to see all the different ways to support as an individual donor or as a sponsor.\n\nAll Festival merchandise (pins, posters, apparel, etc.) and Festival beverage purchases at the event are also support opportunities.\n\nThank you for your interest in becoming a vendor! Applications for the 2023 Festival will be available on our website October 1st and the deadline to apply is always December 1st.\n\nCheck back, in October, for more information about Festival 2023.\n\nIf you use a credit or debit card, you will ONLY be charged for what you purchase. No more top-ups or refunds needed!\n\nIf you use cash onsite, simply fill out the refund form that will be on our RFID page within 30 days after Festival is over. We will process these requests weekly and send the money directly to your bank account.\n\nRead more about RFID wristbands here."
