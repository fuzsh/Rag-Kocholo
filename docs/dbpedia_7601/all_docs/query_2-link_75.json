Registration opens August 6, 2024.\n\nPack For Every Occasion – Be Weather Ready\n\nSXSW is more than just a conference. You’ll be attending sessions, meeting potential clients, viewing films, networking at clubs, and hopping from one showcase to the next. If you’ve ever been to Austin, you know that the weather can be unpredictable — be sure to check weather forecasts before you set off each day. That being said, Austin is a really casual city. If you want to attend panels in your pajamas, we won’t judge.\n\nPlan To Walk… A Lot\n\nFor those of you in fitness challenges counting your steps — get ready to score big this March! You’re going to be doing a lot of walking, so be comfort-conscious when selecting footwear. If you can manage it, you may want to have a change of shoes (and socks!) available. Your feet will thank you.\n\nStay tuned for the Registrant Walking Map for a quick look at nearby venues. On the SXSW Schedule and SXSW GO mobile app, you can also access a venues list and interactive maps.\n\nHop on a SXSW Shuttle\n\nA free circulating shuttle route runs between the Austin Convention Center and most SXSW venues. Plan accordingly to make it to your event on time – explore routes and daily hours of operation. Keep up with the status of the shuttles on the SXSW Shuttle Tracker.\n\nStay Hydrated\n\nWe strongly recommend that you pack sunscreen and a reusable water bottle. The Texas heat can be dehydrating and the air in the convention center can be quite dry, but you’ll find water stations throughout the building to refill your bottle and stay hydrated.\n\nWhile SXSW makes efforts to provide recycling stations during the event, many single-use plastic bottles end up in the trash.\n\nMake a Schedule\n\nYou don’t have to stick to it, but having a place to start will make all the difference. The process of making your schedule is a useful discovery tool for events. Use the SXSW Schedule or SXSW GO mobile app to build your customized schedule. Events can be filtered by conference, festivals, event type, venue, and time. Simply click the star next to the event’s listing to add it to your schedule.\n\nExplore events outside of your industry! All registrants have secondary access to events not associated with their badge type. Our Convergence programming spotlights cross-industry topics and encourages networking between registrants from many different fields of expertise.\n\nUse event navigation tools to help you navigate and access conference and festival events. Review our Attendee Safety page for general safety guidelines and resources.\n\nFind a New Collaborator\n\nSXSW provides unlimited networking opportunities in an eclectic, social atmosphere. Even if you arrive in Austin on your own, you’ll be saying heartfelt goodbyes at the end of the week. Connect with other registrants at various Exhibitions, session formats including mentor sessions, meet ups, lounges and parties, and more.\n\nSet up your profile on SXSW Social and use the Chat feature to network with other attendees before, during, and after the event.\n\nPace Yourself\n\nYou will have the urge to hit the ground running and try to cram as much into your first day as possible. Resist it! You will only be overwhelmed and disappointed with yourself that you don’t have the energy to go to that great evening event you had your heart set on. Experienced registrants know that SXSW is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nEnjoy your SXSW adventure!"
