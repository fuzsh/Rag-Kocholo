        "meta_description": "Director Bob Smeaton's rock 'n road-trip movie, featuring some of 1970's preeminent musicians on a five day train tour through Canada, is an essential time capsule of what happened when the swinging sixties made its awkward leap into the unforgiving after-party of the '70s. There are eye-opening run-ins with hostile fans along the way but the camaraderie of the musicians, including Janis Joplin, The Band and The Grateful Dead keeps spirits high (literally). Because the tour was a financial disaster, the footage sat unused in a garage for years before being resurrected for presentation at the 2003 Toronto Film Festival.",
