The film features the musicians' shenanigans and jam sessions along with amazing performance clips of stops in Toronto, Winnipeg and Calgary. Other featured artists include the Band, Buddy Guy and New Riders of the Purple Sage. The film was not released at the time it was filmed because of a dispute between the promoters and the producers."
