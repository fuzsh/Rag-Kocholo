Royal Irish Academy [Transactions of RIA, Vol. XXVII; Polite literature and Antiquities, VI] (Dublin: RIA 1885) [cited in Rev. George Thomas Stokes, DD., and the Rev. Charles H. H. Wright, DD, Writings of St Patrick, the Apostle of Ireland, a revised translation, with Notes, Critical and Historical (Dublin: Hodges Figgis & Co. [for Dublin Univ.]; London: James Nisbet & Co. 1887). [See further under Ferguson, q.v., supra.]\n\nPhilip Freeman, St. Patrick of Ireland (NY: Simon and Schuster 2005), 240pp. Publishers notice: Born to an aristocratic British family in the fifth century, Patrick was kidnapped by slave raiders at age 15 and sold to an Irish farmer. After six years of tending sheep he escaped, walked 200 miles to a port city he had seen in a dream, and sailed for home. Years later, as a priest or bishop, he returned to Ireland. Bribing petty kings for safe passage through their rural domains, he preached, baptized and established churches in his beloved adopted land. This information about the saint's life is known from two lengthy letters he wrote late in life, both included in a lively translation by Freeman, a classics professor and author of three previous books about the Celtic world. Dismissing many familiar tales as myths, he relies on archeological discoveries as well as Greek and Roman writers to create a colorful picture of Ireland at the end of the Roman Empire: its kings and headhunting warriors, gods and human sacrifices, belief in the Otherworld. I am a stranger and an exil living among barbarians and pagans, because God cares for them, Patrick wrote. Besides, time was running out: As Freeman observes, The gospel had been preached throughout the world and was even then, by [Patricks] own efforts, being spread to the most distant land of all. There was simply no reason for Gods judgment to be delayed once the Irish had heard the good news. In the storytelling tradition of popular historian Thomas Cahill, this small book offers a fascinating and believable introduction to Ireland's patron saint.[Reed Business Information/ Reed Elsevier Inc.]\n\nAnn Dooley & Harry Roe, ed. & trans., Tales of the Elders of Ireland [Acallam na SenÃ³rach] [Oxford World Classics] (OUP 2008), xliii, 245pp. Pub. notice: Tales of the Elders of Ireland is the first complete translation of the late Middle Irish Acallam na SenÃ³rach. Dating from around the end of the twelfth century it is the largest literary text surviving from early Ireland, mingling the contemporary Christian world of Saint Patrick, the earlier pagan world of the ancient, giant Fenians and the parallel, timeless Otherworld, peopled by ever-young, shape-shifting fairies. It also provides the most extensive account available of the Otherworld's music and magic, internecine wars, malice toward, and infatuation with, humankind - themes still featured in the story-telling of present-day Ireland. This readable and flowing new translation is based on existing manuscript sources and is richly annotated complete with an Introduction discussing the place of the Acallam in Irish tradition and the impact of the Fenian or Ossianic tradition on English and European literature.\n\nSt. Patrick\"s Cathedral, Melanie Le Brocquy (1942) Tara Hill - Winter (photo of 2023).\n\n[ top ]\n\nCriticism\n\nBiography\n\nEdmund L.

My father was Calpornius, a deacon, son of Potitus, a priest, of the village Bannavem Taburniae; he had a country seat nearby, and there I was taken captive./I was then about sixteen years of age. I did not know the true God. I was taken into captivity to Ireland with many thousands of people - and deservedly so, because we turned away from God, and did not keep His commandments, and did not obey our priests, who used to remind us of our salvation. And the Lord brought over us the wrath of His anger and scattered us among many nations, even unto the utmost part of the earth, where now my littleness is placed among strangers. /\n\nAnd there the Lord opened the sense of my unbelief that I might at last remember my sins and be converted with all my heart to the Lord my God, who had regard for my abjection, and mercy on my youth and ignorance, and watched over me before I knew Him, and before I was able to distinguish between good and evil, and guarded me, and comforted me as would a father his son [ ] (Trans. by Ludwig Bieler; rep. in Seamus Deane, gen. ed., The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing (Derry: Field Day 1991), Vol. 1.)

And he gave me one of them and I read the opening words of the letter which were The voice of the Irish and as I read the beginning of the letter, I thought that at the same moment I heard their voice - they were those beside the Wood of Foclut which is near the Western Sea - and thus did they cry out as with one mouth: We ask thee, boy, come and walk among us once more. ([Trans Ludwig Bieler;] quoted in Tomás Ó Fiaich, The Beginnings of Christianity, in The Course of Irish History, ed.

Do. [trans. by Ludwig Bieler]: I, Patrick, a sinner, unlearned, resident in Ireland, declare myself to be a bishop. Most assuredly I believe that what I am I have received from God. And so I live among barbarians, a stranger and exile for the love of God. He is witness that this is so. Not that I wished my mouth to utter anything so hard and harsh; but I am forced by the zeal for God; and the truth of Christ has wrung it from me, out of love for my neighbours and sons for whom I gave up my country and parents and my life to the point of death. If I be worthy, I live for my God to teach the heathen, even though some may despise me. / With my own hand I have written and composed these words, to be given, delivered, and sent to the soldiers of Coroticus; I do not say, to my fellow citizens, or to fellow citizens of the holy Romans, but to fellow citizens of the demons, because of their evil works. Like our enemies, they live in death, allies of the Scots and the apostate Picts. Dripping with blood, they welter in the blood of innocent Christians, whom I have begotten into the number for God and confirmed in Christ! [...] I ask earnestly that whoever is a willing servant of God be a carrier of this letter, so that on no account it be suppressed or hidden by anyone, but rather be read before all the people, and in the presence of Coroticus himself. May God inspire them sometime to recover their senses for God, repenting, however late, their heinous deeds - murderers of the brethren of the Lord! - and to set free the baptised women whom they took captive, in order that they may deserve to live to God, and be made whole, here and in eternity! Be peace to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Amen. (Rep. in Seamus Deane, gen. ed., The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing, Derry: Field Day 1991, Vol. 1; see longer extract in RICORSO Library, Irish Classics, via index, or direct.) Unde enim Coroticus cum suis sceleratissimis rebellatores Xpisti ubi se uidebunt. Qui mulierculas baptizatas praemia distribuunt. Ob miserum regnum temporale quod utique in momento transeat. Sicut nubes uel fumus qui utique uento dispergitur ita peccatores fraudulenti a facie Domini peribunt. Iusti autem epulentur in magna constantia cum Xpisto iudicabunt nationes et regibus iniquis dominabunter. In saecula saeculorum. Amen. Whence, then, Coroticus with his most shameful men, rebels against Christ, where will they see themselves, they who distribute baptized little women as prizes because of a pitiable temporal realm which may indeed pass away in a moment? Just as a cloud or smoke, which indeed is dispersed by the wind, so fraudulent sinners will perish from the face of the Lord. But the righteous will feast in great constancy with Christ. They will judge nations, and they will lord it over unjust rulers for ages of ages. Amen.

I was free born according to the flesh; I am born of a father who was a decurion; but I sold my noble rank - I blush not to state it nor am I sorry for the profit of others; in short I am a slave in Christ to a foreign nation for the unspeakable glory of the eternal life which is in Christ our Lord. (Letter to Coroticus; quoted in Oliver St. John Gogarty, I follow St. Patrick, 1938, p.42.)\n\nLife of Tirechan: Et quocumque essent aut quacumque forma aut quacumque plebe aut quacumque regione non cognouerunt, sed illos uiros side aut deorum terrenorum aut fantassiam estimauerunt [And they did not know whence they were or of what shape or from what people or from what region, but thought they were men of the other world or earth-gods or a phantom]. One of the girls:Who is God and where is God and whose God is he and where is his dwelling-place? Has your God sons and daughters, gold and silver? Is he ever-living, is he beautiful, have many fostered his son, are his daughters dear and beautiful in the eyes of the men of the earth? Is he in the sky or in the earth or in the water, in rivers, in mountains, in valleys? Give us an account of him; how shall he be seen, how is he loved, how is he found, is he found in youth, in old age? Patrick: Our God is the God of all men, the God of heaven and earth, of the sea and the rivers, God of the sun and the moon and all the stars, the God of high mountains and low valleys; God above heaven and in heaven and under heaven, he has his dwelling in heaven and earth and sea and in everything that is in them; he breathes in all things, makes all things live, surpasses all things, supports all things; he illumines the light of the sun, he consolidates the light of the night and the stars, he has made wells in the dry earth and dry islands in the sea and stars for the service of the major lights. He has a son, coeternal with him, similar to him; the Son is not younger than the Father nor is the Father older than the Son, and the Holy Spirit breathes in them; the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are not separate. (Quoted by Charles Doherty in Kingship in Early Ireland, in Tara: A Study of an Exceptional Kingship and Landscape, Edel Bhreathnach, Dublin 2005, pp.3-31, pp.7-8, citing Bieler, Patrician Texts; see alternative presentation under Commentary, infra.)\n\nThe Irish Ecclesiastical Record: A Monthly Journal Conducted by a Society of the Clergymen under Episcopal Sanction\n\n[Legend:] Ut Christiani ita et Romani sitis. / As you are children of Christ, so be you children of Rome. - Ex Dictis S.

See Cathy Swift, John ODonovan and the Framing of early Medieval Ireland in the Nineteenth Century, in Bullán: An Irish Studies Journal, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Spring 1994), pp.97-98. Swift further notes that the association of Tara and the mythical palace of King Loiguire [Laoghaire] is more plausibly to be interpreted as a sign of that sites political imprtance in the later seventh century than as an indication of the Fertaes geographical location. (Swift, ftn. 17, p.102.)\n\nNovel treatment: Stephen Lawhead, Patrick: Son of Ireland (London: HarperCollins 2003), is a full-length fictional life of Succat, son of a distinguished Roman family who is is kidnapped into slavery and becomes known as Corthirthiac among the Druids, whose novice he becomes before assuming the name of Magonus (famous) and later the ordination-name of Patricius; told in pseudo-archaic English; includes physical details (viz., micturition).
