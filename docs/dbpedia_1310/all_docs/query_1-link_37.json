        "text": "Born Ryan Thomas Gosling on November 12, 1980, in London, Ontario, Canada, he is the son of Donna (Wilson), a secretary, and Thomas Ray Gosling, a traveling salesman. Ryan was the second of their two children, with an older sister, Mandi. His ancestry is French-Canadian, as well as English, Scottish, and Irish. The Gosling family moved to Cornwall, Ontario, where Ryan grew up and was home-schooled by his mother. He also attended Gladstone Public School and Cornwall Collegiate & Vocational School, where he excelled in Drama and Fine Arts. The family then relocated to Burlington, Ontario, where Ryan attended Lester B. Pearson High School.\n\nRyan first performed as a singer at talent contests with Mandi. He attended an open audition in Montreal for the TV series \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" (The Mickey Mouse Club (1989)) in January 1993 and beat out 17,000 other aspiring actors for a a spot on the show. While appearing on \"MMC\" for two years, he lived with co-star Justin Timberlake's family.\n\nThough he received no formal acting training, after \"MMC,\" Gosling segued into an acting career, appearing on the TV series Der junge Hercules (1998) and Breaker High (1997), as well as the films The Slaughter Rule (2002), Mord nach Plan (2002), and Gegen jede Regel (2000). He first attracted serious critical attention with his performance as the Jewish neo-Nazi in the controversial film Inside a Skinhead (2001), which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. He was cast in the part by writer-director Henry Bean, who believed that Gosling's strict upbringing gave him the insight to understand the character Danny, whose obsessiveness with the Judaism he was born into turns to hatred. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award as Best Male Lead in 2002 for the role and won the Golden Aries award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics.\n\nAfter appearing in the sleeper Wie ein einziger Tag (2004) in 2004, Gosling won the dubious honor of being named one of the 50 Hottest Bachelors by People Magazine. More significantly, he was named the Male Star of Tomorrow at the 2004 Show West convention of movie exhibitors.\n\nGosling reached a summit of his profession with his performance in Half Nelson (2006), which garnered him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. In a short time, he has established himself as one of the finest actors of his generation. Throughout the subsequent decade, he has become all three of an internet fixation, a box office star, and a critical darling, having headlined Blue Valentine (2010), Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011), Drive (2011), The Ides of March - Tage des Verrats (2011), The Place Beyond the Pines (2012), The Nice Guys (2016), and La La Land (2016). In 2017, he starred in the long-awaited science fiction sequel Blade Runner 2049 (2017), with Harrison Ford.\n\nRyan has two children with his partner, actress Eva Mendes.\n\nAmiable and handsome James Garner had obtained success in both films and television, often playing variations of the charming anti-hero/con-man persona he first developed in Maverick, the offbeat western TV series that shot him to stardom in the late 1950s.\n\nJames Garner was born James Scott Bumgarner in Norman, Oklahoma, to Mildred Scott (Meek) and Weldon Warren Bumgarner, a carpet layer. He dropped out of high school at 16 to join the Merchant Marines. He worked in a variety of jobs and received 2 Purple Hearts when he was wounded twice during the Korean War. He had his first chance to act when a friend got him a non-speaking role in the Broadway stage play \"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial (1954)\". Part of his work was to read lines to the lead actors and he began to learn the craft of acting. This play led to small television roles, television commercials and eventually a contract with Warner Brothers. Director David Butler saw something in Garner and gave him all the attention he needed when he appeared in Playboy - Marsch, marsch! (1956). After co-starring in a handful of films during 1956-57, Warner Brothers gave Garner a co-starring role in the the western series Maverick (1957). Originally planned to alternate between Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) and Bret Maverick (Garner), the show quickly turned into the Bret Maverick Show. As Maverick, Garner was cool, good-natured, likable and always ready to use his wits to get him in or out of trouble. The series was highly successful, and Garner continued in it into 1960 when he left the series in a dispute over money.\n\nIn the early 1960s Garner returned to films, often playing the same type of character he had played on \"Maverick\". His successful films included Was diese Frau so alles treibt (1963), Eine zuviel im Bett (1963), Gesprengte Ketten (1963) and Nur f√ºr Offiziere (1964). After that, his career wandered and when he appeared in the automobile racing movie Grand Prix (1966), he got the bug to race professionally. Soon, this ambition turned to supporting a racing team, not unlike what Paul Newman would do in later years.\n\nGarner found great success in the western comedy Auch ein Sheriff braucht mal Hilfe (1969). He tried to repeat his success with a sequel, Latigo (1971), but it wasn't up to the standards of the first one. After 11 years off the small screen, Garner returned to television in a role not unlike that in Auch ein Sheriff braucht mal Hilfe (1969). The show was Sheriff ohne Colt und Tadel (1971) and he played the sheriff who would try to solve all problems with his wits and without gun play. When the show was canceled, Garner took the news by having Nichols shot dead, never to return in a sequel. In 1974 he got the role for which he will probably be best remembered, as wry private eye Jim Rockford in the classic Detektiv Rockford - Anruf gen√ºgt (1974). This became his second major television hit, with Noah Beery Jr. and Stuart Margolin, and in 1977 he won an Emmy for his portrayal. However, a combination of injuries and the discovery that Universal Pictures' \"creative bookkeeping\" would not give him any of the huge profits the show generated soon soured him and the show ended in 1980. In the 1980s Garner appeared in few movies, but the ones he did make were darker than the likable Garner of old. These included Der Tank (1984) and Die zweite Wahl - Eine Romanze (1985). For the latter, he was nominated for both the Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Returning to the western mode, he co-starred with the young Bruce Willis in Sunset - D√§mmerung in Hollywood (1988), a mythical story of Wyatt Earp, Tom Mix and 1920s Hollywood.\n\nIn the 1990s Garner received rave reviews for his role in the acclaimed television movie about corporate greed, Der Konzern (1993). After that he appeared in the theatrical remake of his old television series, Maverick - Den Colt am G√ºrtel, ein As im √Ñrmel (1994), opposite Mel Gibson. Most of his appearances after that were in numerous TV movies based upon Detektiv Rockford - Anruf gen√ºgt (1974). His most recent films were Ein Pr√§sident f√ºr alle F√§lle (1996) and Space Cowboys (2000) .\n\nWith an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer's The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival's The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets' drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols.\n\nFreeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including \"Easy Reader\", \"Mel Mounds\" and \"Count Dracula\" on the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children's adventure, Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade - Der Kontrabulle (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica - Revolte hinter Gittern (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Der Augenzeuge (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Glitzernder Asphalt (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of Miss Daisy und ihr Chauffeur (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama Glory (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.\n\nHis star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in Fegefeuer der Eitelkeiten (1990), Robin Hood - K√∂nig der Diebe (1991), and Im Glanz der Sonne (1992). Freeman's next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in Clint Eastwood's de-mythologized western Erbarmungslos (1992). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for Gene Hackman, a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on Bopha! - Kampf um Freiheit (1993) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment.\n\nMore strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker Tim Robbins in Die Verurteilten (1994). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in Sieben (1995), starred alongside Keanu Reeves in Au√üer Kontrolle (1996), and was pursuing another serial murderer in ...Denn zum k√ºssen sind sie da (1997).\n\nFurther praise followed for his role in the slave tale of Amistad - Das Sklavenschiff (1997), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in Deep Impact (1998), appeared in Neil LaBute's black comedy Nurse Betty (2000), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in Im Netz der Spinne (2001). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama Der Anschlag (2002), was a military officer in the Stephen King-inspired Dreamcatcher (2003), gave divine guidance as God to Jim Carrey in Bruce Allm√§chtig (2003), and played a minor role in the comedy Hawaii Crime Story (2004).\n\n2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend Clint Eastwood to appear in the drama, Million Dollar Baby (2004). Freeman's on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie \"Scrap Iron\" Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer Hilary Swank. Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy's judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated Steven Spielberg's Krieg der Welten (2005) and appeared in Batman Begins (2005) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman for director Christopher Nolan. Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy.\n\nRoles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in Lucky Number Slevin (2006), a second go-round as God in Evan Allm√§chtig (2007) with Steve Carell taking over for Jim Carrey, and a supporting role in Ben Affleck's directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone - Kein Kinderspiel (2007). He co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the breakout hit Das Beste kommt zum Schluss (2007) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, Wanted (2008), then segued into the second Batman film, The Dark Knight (2008).\n\nIn 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director's true-life drama Invictus - Unbezwungen (2009), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of Nelson Mandela in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics' Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.\n\nRecently, Freeman appeared in R.E.D. - √Ñlter. H√§rter. Besser. (2010), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the Conan (2011) remake, starred in Rob Reiner's The Magic of Belle Isle - Ein verzauberter Sommer (2012); and capped the Batman trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Freeman has several films upcoming, including the thriller Die Unfassbaren - Now You See Me (2013), under the direction of Louis Leterrier, and the science fiction actioner Oblivion (2013), in which he stars with Tom Cruise.\n\nMichelle Branch was born on July 2, 1983 in Sedona, Arizona as Michelle Jaquet DeSevren Branch. She was born 7 weeks early, weighing only 3 lbs. 11 oz. When she was 3, she recorded herself singing Beatles covers on her parents karaoke machine & sent them off to her grandmother. She took up singing lessons at 8 but had to stop when she moved at 11. Afterwards, she took singing lessons w/ Gina Bettum. A year after picking up the guitar, she began lessons w/ Gina's husband but soon stopped after she found herself constantly being technical instead of artistic. At 15, she left school & was home-schooled tutored by her mom w/ a clear warning that if her grades dropped, she had return to school.\n\nHer 1st break into the music industry happened when she was at home looking after her younger sister. A family friend called her, telling her that a music manager named Jeff Rabhan was taking a time share tour at her company & to get down to her office w/ a demo tape. Since she was unable to leave her sister alone, lacked a driver's license & her parents weren't at home, she stole her neighbor's golf cart & made her way down to the resort. When she got there, he wasn't interested, but after forcing her tape on him, he listened to it on his way home in the car. A few months later, she unexpectedly received a phone call from him, asking to sign her.\n\nAfterwards, she went into the studio to record an indie album titled Broken Bracelet, planning to give it away at local shows. In summer 2000, she received another phone call-this time from Hanson's reps, asking her to play in some of its upcoming shows. She happily accepted, packed her bags & flew to California. There, she was spotted by a rep at Maverick Records who offered a record deal. In December 2000, she eventually signed w/ the label.\n\nIn summer 2001, her 1st hit turned out to be Everywhere. It shot to #12 on the Billboard Hot 100, establishing her as an up-&-comer. Several artists wanted to work w/ her such as Lifehouse, Jude, The Calling, Sheryl Crow & The Chicks. In January 2002, All You Wanted debuted at #6, eventually reaching #1 on the TRL top 10. That summer, Carlos Santana asked to collaborate w/ her for the Game Of Love, a song off his comeback album Shaman. It cracked the top 5, gaining her worldwide recognition.\n\nIn April 2003, she finished recording the album Hotel Paper. The 1st single was Are You Happy Now?. Since then, she has gone on to perform at the Super Bowl & Latin VMAs.

During his teen years, he attended Putnam City North High School which was located in Oklahoma City. After graduating in 1991, he attended Oklahoma State University and studied Broadcast Journalism. While in university, he became a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.\n\nWhile vacationing with his family in Hawaii, he met actor Kirk Cameron, and his actress sister, Candace Cameron Bure. They eventually invited James to visit them in Los Angeles. After studying in Oklahoma State for over a year and appearing in his college production, \"Bye Bye Birdie\", he left school and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his interest in acting. James got his first job on the pilot episode of Die Nanny (1993) as Eddie, who was Margaret Sheffield's boyfriend. He then became part of the Canadian television series, Boogies Diner (1994), which aired for one season. After that series ended, he got a brief role as the original Griffin on Fox's Party of Five (1994). His first big break came when he became the lead on the short-lived ABC series, Second Noah (1996). Although the show didn't last long, the young actor received enough exposure from the public and even managed to win the hearts of fellow teenage girls. In 1996, he attended an audition for a movie titled Zwielicht (1996) but unfortunately lost that role to Edward Norton. Two years later, he was offered a lead role in Studio 54 (1998), which he turned down. The role later went to another actor, Ryan Phillippe.\n\nJames' star power increased when he starred in David Nutter's Dich kriegen wir auch noch! (1998), alongside Katie Holmes and Nick Stahl, which had mixed reviews, but mostly positive ones. His role in the television series as Glenn Foy in Ally McBeal (1997), is probably one of his biggest achievement to date. He became one of the main cast members during the first half of season 5, where he showcased his singing abilities. It was in that show where he was able to grab the attention of audiences from different backgrounds. The 5' 10\" star later played Lon Hammon Jr. in the romantic movie, Wie ein einziger Tag (2004), which was based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks of the same name. His movies, Alibi (2006) and Streets of Philadelphia - Unter Verr√§tern (2006) was also released around the world to audiences in the year 2006. One of his most memorable roles to fans is his role as Cyclops in the X-Men (2000) movie franchise. The movie was well accepted by audiences and critics, which eventually made James one of the hottest stars since it was released. He was among the actors who starred in all three of the X-Men movies. James had the honor of working alongside Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen and Hugh Jackman in the film. However, not many people know that he actually had to wear lifts for most of his scenes in the X-men movies, because his character Cyclops is supposed to be 6\" 3\" compared to a 5' 3\" Wolverine. In reality, he is actually under 6' 0\", shorter than Famke Janssen who plays his love interest, Jean Grey, and even shorter than Hugh Jackman who played Wolverine.\n\nIn the year 2006, he played Richard White in the highly anticipated movie, Superman Returns (2006), which coincidentally was directed by Bryan Singer, who also directed previous X-Men installments. Although he appeared in X-Men: Der letzte Widerstand (2006), the third installment of the X-Men franchise, many would notice that he in fact had more screen time in 'Superman Returns', as Lois Lane's long awaiting fianc√© who had to accept the fact that his fianc√©e is in love with the man of steel. James earned great reviews from that movie, which led to him getting more movie roles. In 2007, James played Corny Collins in the film Hairspray (2007), an adaption of the Broadway musical based on John Waters movie, Hairspray (1988). He joined a star-studded cast, starring alongside top names such as John Travolta, Queen Latifah and Michelle Pfeiffer. James not only acted in that movie, but also sang two of the film's songs, \"The Nicest Kids In Town\", and \"Hairspray\". Being part of Hairspray catapulted James to a different level of stardom as audiences got to see another side of him. His next role was in the Disney movie, Verw√ºnscht (2007), playing Prince Edward, where he acted alongside Amy Adams, Susan Sarandon and Patrick Dempsey. Once again, James had the opportunity to sing in two songs from the movie, \"True Love's Kiss\" and \"That's Amore\". Verw√ºnscht (2007) appealed to not only older audiences but also to those who were fans of Disney's network productions. Following his huge success in the years 2006 and 2007, James played the male lead role in the romantic comedy, 27 Dresses (2008), opposite actress Katherine Heigl in 2008. The movie did well at the box office, earning a gross revenue of over $159 million, which exceeded the expectations of crew members especially since it was under a $30 million budget.\n\nMarsden played the male lead in the horror film, The Box - Du bist das Experiment (2009), based on the 1970 short story \"Button, Button\" by author Richard Matheson. He starred opposite Cameron Diaz in the movie.\n\nHe co-starred in Accidental Love (2015) (previously Liebe ohne Krankenschein (2015), a politically-themed romantic comedy, directed by David O. Russell and filmed in Columbia, South Carolina. Marsden's recent film roles include the sequel comedy Anchorman - Die Legende kehrt zur√ºck (2013), the romantic drama The Best of Me - Mein Weg zu dir (2014), and the comedy Big Business - Au√üer Spesen nichts gewesen (2015).\n\nJames was married to Lisa Linde, an actress known from her role in Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965). Lisa is the daughter of legendary country music songwriter Dennis Linde. The couple wed on July 22, 2000 and have a son, Jack Holden Marsden who was born on February 1, 2001, and a daughter, Mary James, who was born on August 10, 2005. They divorced in 2011. James has another son, born in 2012, with model Rose Costa.\n\nMany would assume that with all this success achieved by James at this age, he would be somewhat high-headed but James mentioned that despite all the attention he's getting from the public eye, he tries to keep himself as grounded as possible. He even admits that he flies coach instead of first class while traveling with his family. In an interview he mentioned that he believes he has a certain responsibility to let his children know that he isn't special because of what he does, but who he is as a person. With a great humble attitude and a bright future ahead of him, there's definitely more to expect from this Oklahoma native."
