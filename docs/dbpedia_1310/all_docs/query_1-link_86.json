Third Edition. Folio.Â  A good copy in dust jacket.  Illustrated with 27 plates of Coats-of-Arms in Ireland.   \"The author - Dr. Edward Maclysaght, M.R.I.A. - was sometime Keeper of Manuscripts in the National Library of Ireland and held office as Chief Herald in Dublin Castle. It has taken him twelve years to collect the material for this book which makes available in easily accessible form a wealth of reliable information on Irish Genealogy. The armorial bearings have been illustrated by the artist attached to the genealogical Office from the blazons officially recognized there and will be especially important in correcting many careless or misinformed representations of Irish arms which are in frequent use. It is hardly too much to claim, therefore, that this book is the most authoritative and accurate ever produced on the subject.\"-",
