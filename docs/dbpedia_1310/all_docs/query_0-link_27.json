The film stars Palka and Jason Ritter (with whom she met in 1999), Martin Starr, Mark Webber, Charles Durning and Tom Arnold. Palka received the Directing Award from Sean Connery for the film. The film explores what intimacy truly can be for someone who has been sexually abused in their childhood. Critics have related it to Hitchcock's Marnie for its vulnerable and strong, masculine and feminine male and female characters. It's been described as the only film with only one female character; that still passes the Bechdel Test. Good Dick played internationally in cinemas across the globe. And has never not been top 5 streaming on Hulu. It was self-released in the US in 2009, in the states, and the New York Times wrote about its success, creating the phrase \"The Good Dick business model\" At the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, Palka was a Juror with the Alfred P.

This the exact same bathing suit Palka wore on the show. Along with her Scottish kilt which her Polish grandmother Babcia bought for her from Marks and Spencer's when Palka was 14.\n\nPalka wrote her Sundance 2017 critically acclaimed feature film BITCH over a weekend in Lake Tahoe because she was inspired by Maya Angelou's habit of writing in hotels. The film was produced by Elijah Wood, Daniel Noah and Josh Waller's who's company Spector Vision developed the film and sold for America right after Sundance and it sold for the world at Cannes 2017. It stars Palka, Jason Ritter, Jaime King, Rio Mangini, Brighton Sharbino, Jason Maybalm and Kingston Foster. The film is based on a true story from Scottish doctor R.D.

Glow aka Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling. With 14 actresses in the show Palka trained as a wrestler with them for 6 weeks.

Balancing perfectly between the small screen and big screen, this cultural icon proudly became the first Black cast member on Bravo's \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" (2020). Cementing her status as a media queen, she released a memoir titled Love Me as I Am (Harper Collins) about life, love, and the pursuit of true happiness. It quickly rose in the ranks, landing in the #1 spot on Amazon and garnering a great deal of press attention including Good Morning America, Nightline, and PEOPLE Magazine. Most recently she expanded her empire to include a home line with HSN called \"Garcelle at Home.\" Garcelle has expanded her career with a Lifetime partnership to executive producer original titles, including most recently the award-winning film \"Black Girl Missing\" (2023) and it's second installment \"Abducted at an HBCU: A Black Girl Missing Movie\" (July 20, 2024) and \"Terry McMillan Presents: Tempted By Love\" (August 17, 2024).\n\nA look back at Garcelle's career shows a hybrid of businesswoman and mother who has been a cherished face in Hollywood for over three decades. She got her start in 90s comedies \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" and \"The Jamie Foxx Show.\" She went on to appear in television on series such as SyFy's \"The Magicians,\" NBC's \"Chicago Med,\" \"NYPD Blue,\" \"Franklin & Bash,\" HBO's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Arrested Development,\" \"Power\" on Starz and many others. In addition to scripted TV, she co-hosted on Fox's daytime talk-show \"Hollywood Today Live,\" where she broke down the latest in entertainment, pop culture, and celebrity news, as well co-hosting for E!'s \"Fashion Police,\" and \"Access Hollywood Live\" on NBC. On the voiceover side of work, Garcelle was heard in HBO Max's \"The Prince\" with Gary Janetti. Recently, she wrapped her final season on the multi-award-winning talk show Fox's \"The Real\" as co-host.\n\nShe could also recently be seen in Netflix's \"Survival of the Thickest\" and Hulu's \"The Other Black Girl.\" Working in film has always been a passion for Garcelle. She has starred in box office hits \"White House Down\" with Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum as the First Lady of the United States, \"Flight\" with Denzel Washington, \"American Gun\" with Forrest Whitaker, \"Coming to America\" (1988), and the sequel \"Coming 2 America\" (2021) where she worked once again with Eddie Murphy, \"Bad Company\" with Chris Rock, \"Barbershop 2: Back in Business\" with Queen Latifah, and \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" with Tom Holland, among others.\n\nAbove all, Garcelle's most important job is being a mother. She was inspired by motherhood to write a children's book series entitled I AM, addressing identity issues relevant to many children today. There are three successful books in the series. The book series was re-released in April 2020 for its fifth anniversary. Garcelle is an ambassador for Cybersmile, a multi-award-winning nonprofit organization committed to digital well being and tackling all forms of bullying and abuse online and she also supports the Step Up Women's Network, a national non-profit that empowers women and girls to be strong and reach their full potential. She is also an active supporter of UNICEF and CORE, raising money for Haiti. Garcelle also supports the W.K. Kellogg Foundation \"Pockets of Hope\" campaign focused on the investment in locally led initiatives that are building a strong and equitable future for Haitian children, families and communities.\n\nShe resides in Los Angeles and has three sons; Oliver, her firstborn who has made her a proud grandmother and her twins, Jax and Jaid.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, California, the middle of three siblings, Johnny began performing from the age of 5 at a small performing arts school, making his debut as a Chanukah candle.\n\nPursuing the acting profession, he appeared with success in many TV and film projects, handling both drama and comedy with finesse.\n\nJohnny was what used to be called a Renaissance Man. He was not only a superb actor, but excelled in the other arts as well. He was a prolific writer, poet and painter.\n\nHe also was a philanthropist, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to worthy causes, as well as being an active member of a number of charitable organizations.\n\nHe had seen too many of his friends succumb to the curse of drug abuse, and so he became an outspoken advocate against drugs, using his celebrity status to speak to large groups of educators and law enforcement officials about the dangers of street and psychiatric drug abuse.\n\nHe created friends everywhere he went. And he went everywhere. Europe, Asia, South America. He slept with natives in grass huts in Southeast Asia, and was the first white man allowed passage to a sacred lake in Laos.\n\nOf his many talents, one that he treasured was the mentoring of other artists. Many successful performers, some of whom have reached the top of their profession have ascribed their success to Johnny.\n\nHis most recent work includes Sons of Anarchy (two seasons), Felon, The Runaways, 186 Dollars to Freedom and Lovely Molly.\n\nIn late October 2011 he suffered head injuries from a motorcycle accident. Immediately thereafter his thinking and behavior took a serious turn for the worse. He was arrested on January 3, 2012 for allegedly trespassing at a neighbor's home. He was beaten violently in the head approximately 17 times before the police arrived, causing further injuries. In jail, following additional head injuries he was diagnosed by the prison medics as suffering from internal bleeding in the brain. Despite the diagnosis of Traumatic Brain Injury and despite never testing positive for drugs that year he was treated for psychosis and chemical dependency. Two more arrests followed, including near drowning (another traumatic brain incident). Symptoms of Traumatic Brain Injury include impaired judgement, sensitivity to light, and sudden inexplicable violent behavior. Typical of the misperception on the part of law enforcement officials was the often-quoted remark by the probation official who expressed that Johnny suffered from mental health issues as well as chemical dependency. Prior to his injuries Johnny had never had a brush with the law. And the toxicology report following his death revealed absolutely no drugs whatsoever in his system.\n\nIn late May of 2012 the Santa Monica Superior Court allowed his admission to Ridgeview, a drug rehab center in Alta Dena, California. Though a drug rehab facility, the rest and quiet were a tonic for him, and he gradually, over the summer, regained himself. He wrote, in a journal entry, \"Felt more whole today. . .more complete. Like parts of myself had been stolen in my sleep and scattered all over the world and they've begun to return. So I think better, my thoughts aren't being sent off on their own.\" He began planning for a return to acting, via the stage, and spoke of possibly bringing Shakespeare to inner city kids. In August he tragically accepted the DA's offer to serve \"just a couple more days in jail,\" in exchange for his freedom. The \"couple days\" became nearly two months, during which he suffered additional abuse and a violent downturn in spirits and health. Finally released in late September, he died in sad and disturbing circumstances on September 26, 2012."
