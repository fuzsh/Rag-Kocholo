The names are in their Anglicized form, that is, the most\n\ngenerally representative forms in English. Several categories of names appear, including names of the\n\nfamilies covered in Part II, by ethnic group; important variant forms of names found in Part II; and\n\nnames of families which are direct branches of one of the families dealt with in Part II, as opposed to\n\nmore distantly related tribal branches. Included in this latter category are blood-related septs of the\n\nScottish clans. (Scottish clan septs can be of two kinds; firstly there are the male-line branches, the\n\nidentifiable of which are covered here, but then secondly there were those not related in the male line,\n\nyet who nonetheless followed the chief of the clan, adhering to him for protection. This reflects Scottish\n\nclanships slightly different development in this regard, as discussed in Part I.)\n\nFinally, it should be noted that in some cases more than one distinct sept bore the same name in\n\nEnglish or Gaelic or both, and when one or more of such families are dealt with while others of the\n\nsame name are not, confusion may arise. To avoid confusion, those not dealt with are listed here but\n\nmarked \"IVL\" (indeterminate, various localities), which generally indicates that these families simply\n\ndid not fall within the main Gaelic tribal sphere, either because they resided outside the Gaelic area, or\n\nelse because they did not form a cohesive group with the level of real political significance common to\n\nthe tribal and clan families listed in Part II, hence their exclusion from further consideration. They are\n\nincluded to show, for instance, that all ONeills are not necessarily of the great Ulster clan, or ONeill\n\nmight be the name of a minor family or of some other clan, or even of a family with no historical or tribal\n\nsignificance. In this way I have cross-referenced family names throughout the Gaelic area, so that\n\naccuracy might be maintained.\n\nFor the genealogist, connection with a particular family bearing such an often-used name must be\n\nmade on a territorial basis (e.g., if your Maclnerney great-grandmother was from County Clare, then\n\nthat shows her to be Dalcassian, and not of the famous Roscommon family of hereditary abbots or erenaghs).\n\nIf a family is only known to originate in a metropolitan area such as Dublin, or Cork City,\n\nthen a family tradition must be extant to determine the origin of the family (unless a family connection\n\nto the city is very old). The same is true if the families in question lived in areas adjacent to each other,\n\nthough this is relatively rare for families of the same name. For the most part the genealogists track is\n\nstraightforward when logic and some sense of history are employed. For Scottish families, holding a\n\nsept-name is often a better indication of actual descent than holding the clan chiefs name itself,\n\nunless a knowledge of ones exact connection to the chiefly line is known (see remarks in Part I,\n\nChapter 1). This again reflects the particular differences of Scottish clanship. In addition, many\n\nScottish families also appear in Ulster after the sixteenth century, as a result of large-scale\n\nimmigration. The genealogist will find this cross-referenced appendix invaluable, and a further look to\n\nthe bibliography is also advised, especially where doubt may exist. Also, when using this, name-forms\n\nshould be searched with and without the prefixes \"0\" and \"Mac.\"\n\nFamilies Ethnic Group Branch of Abbot MacNab Abbot IVL- Ireland Abernethy MacDuff Alexander MacAlister Alexander IVL-South Scotland Anderson Ross Anderson IVL-South Scotland Ardencaple Gaels MacAulay Arthur (Limerick) Vikings Arthur IVL-South Scotland Bain MacKay Balquhidder Cruithne Barrett Normans Barron Fitzgerald Barron IVL-Mayo, Angus Barry Normans Bartholomew MacFarlane Bartholomew IVL-South Scotland Baxter MacMillan Baxter IVL-South Scotland Bell MacMillan Bell IVL-South Scotland Bisset Normans Black Lamont Black MacGregor Black IVL Blake IVL-Mayo, Fermanagh Blake Normans Tribes of Galway Bohannon IVL - Clare\n\nFamilies Ethnic Group Branch of Cavan O'Keevan Cawley MacAwley (Fermanagh) Chalmers Cameron Cheyne, Chesney IVL - Ulster Cheyne IVL - Northern Scotland Chisholm Normans Clarke O'Cleary Clarke O'Hara Clarke IVL Cleary O'Hara Coffey IVL - Connacht, Kerry, Tipperary Cogley O'Quigley Collier, Colyear Robertson Collier, Colyer IVL - Ireland Collins O'Cullane Collins IVL - Ireland Colquhoun Normans Colson MacDonald (Clan Donald) Comrie MacGregor Condon IVL Condon Normans Conlon, Connellan O'Quinlan Conlon, Connellan IVL - North Connacht Conn MacDonald (Clan Donald) Conn IVL - South Scotland Conry O'Mulconry Conry IVL - Galway Cowan MacKeown Cowan IVL - Ireland, S.
