        "text": "Three year old Etzio Vidal, is living without his father, Aaron, who was killed in a horrific crash. David Vidal, Arron's dad, Etzio's grandfather, Chief Inspector of Police and Co-Founder of Road Trauma Support Group, NSW is calling for tougher penalties for road crimes. \"They're not accidents; people make choices, taking lives,\" David says. Little Etzio is a poignant reminder. Each number in the road toll is a life, a family, a story. Treat vehicles responsibly—they're deadly weapons when misused. Chris Minns Hon. Jenny Aitchison MP #RoadSafety #DriveResponsibly #RTSG #TowardsZero #ItsACrash"
