Appendix I - The Coats of Arms

Regarding the armorial shields listed in this appendix, these are arms that had ancient and tribal

significance, as opposed to arms that were later assumed by an individual as a part, for instance, of a

nonhereditary British knighthood. The symbols used are often highly significant within the

tribal-dynastic sphere, in a uniquely Gaelic way. Some common abbreviations are: ar. = argent, az. =

azure, betw. = between, gu. = gules, quart. = quarterly, sa. = sable, 1 & 4 = first and fourth, and 2 & 3

= second and third. Sources are listed in the bibliography.

Appendix II - A List of Surnames

There are over a thousand families listed here. The names are in their Anglicized form, that is, the most

generally representative forms in English. Several categories of names appear, including names of the

families covered in Part II, by ethnic group; important variant forms of names found in Part II; and

names of families which are direct branches of one of the families dealt with in Part II, as opposed to

more distantly related tribal branches. Included in this latter category are blood-related septs of the

Scottish clans. (Scottish clan septs can be of two kinds; firstly there are the male-line branches, the

identifiable of which are covered here, but then secondly there were those not related in the male line,

yet who nonetheless followed the chief of the clan, adhering to him for protection. This reflects Scottish

clanships slightly different development in this regard, as discussed in Part I.)

Finally, it should be noted that in some cases more than one distinct sept bore the same name in

English or Gaelic or both, and when one or more of such families are dealt with while others of the

same name are not, confusion may arise. To avoid confusion, those not dealt with are listed here but

marked "IVL" (indeterminate, various localities), which generally indicates that these families simply

did not fall within the main Gaelic tribal sphere, either because they resided outside the Gaelic area, or

else because they did not form a cohesive group with the level of real political significance common to

the tribal and clan families listed in Part II, hence their exclusion from further consideration. They are

included to show, for instance, that all ONeills are not necessarily of the great Ulster clan, or ONeill

might be the name of a minor family or of some other clan, or even of a family with no historical or tribal

significance. In this way I have cross-referenced family names throughout the Gaelic area, so that

accuracy might be maintained.

For the genealogist, connection with a particular family bearing such an often-used name must be

made on a territorial basis (e.g., if your Maclnerney great-grandmother was from County Clare, then

that shows her to be Dalcassian, and not of the famous Roscommon family of hereditary abbots or erenaghs).

If a family is only known to originate in a metropolitan area such as Dublin, or Cork City,

then a family tradition must be extant to determine the origin of the family (unless a family connection

to the city is very old). The same is true if the families in question lived in areas adjacent to each other,

though this is relatively rare for families of the same name. For the most part the genealogists track is

straightforward when logic and some sense of history are employed. For Scottish families, holding a

sept-name is often a better indication of actual descent than holding the clan chiefs name itself,

unless a knowledge of ones exact connection to the chiefly line is known (see remarks in Part I,

Chapter 1). This again reflects the particular differences of Scottish clanship. In addition, many

Scottish families also appear in Ulster after the sixteenth century, as a result of large-scale

immigration. The genealogist will find this cross-referenced appendix invaluable, and a further look to

the bibliography is also advised, especially where doubt may exist. Also, when using this, name-forms

should be searched with and without the prefixes "0" and "Mac."
