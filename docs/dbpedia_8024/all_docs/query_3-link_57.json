        "text": "Getting Started\n\nWhen we start reading a story (or watching one), we usually have some idea what it’s about. Chances are we picked it up based on a back-cover blurb or advertisement, or a review. But the blurbs and ads are often “teasers,” aimed at drawing us in and getting us to start the story. They may not really tell us where the plot is headed.\n\nThe genre may also give us a clue. If the tale is presented as a mystery, we expect a crime (generally a murder) which will be solved. If it’s a thriller or action epic, we’re prepared for physical challenges and victories. In a romance, we anticipate a successful love affair. But the details are unknown. And in stories without a strong genre identification, we may be less sure about where the story is going.\n\nConsider the James Bond movies. Typically the film opens with an action sequence that may have little to do with the main plot. We can get quite a few minutes into the film before we know what the real plot is. There’s no danger of deterring us from watching; we all know what a James Bond story is like—that’s why we’re there. The action sequence is merely a genre-appropriate appetizer while we wait to get into the main story.\n\nWhat I’m interested in here is the reader’s developing sense of what the main action or conflict is: what goings-on will make up the main business of the story. It’s not as intangible as the theme or “meaning” of the tale. It’s more concrete than that: the overall shape of the plot.\n\nSequential Plots\n\nSome stories start out with one kind of plot, morph into another, and then take off in a third direction. This can result in a certain amount of reader whiplash, though an adroit author can carry it off. She may even gain points for taking the reader on a ride through unexpected twists and turns.\n\nDiana Wynne Jones’s The Lives of Christopher Chant (1988) is my favorite example. The first segment of this children’s fantasy novel is reminiscent of Dickens: the young Christopher, neglected by his parents, is used by a scheming uncle to bring back forbidden goods from alternate worlds. In the second phase of the book, Christopher is sent to a boarding school, where magic is one of the subjects routinely taught. This section recalls the classic British schoolboy tale, with the addition of magic; it’s a sort of predecessor of (and perhaps inspiration for) Harry Potter, which Jones’s book predates by about twelve years. The third part of the novel develops into a high-fantasy epic conflict. At the end Christopher is selected for the future role of “Chrestomanci,” a Sorcerer Supreme position in the British government.\n\nOn first reading, I found it a bit of a swerve to go from the narrative of a difficult childhood to that of a genial school-days story. When this evolved into a magical conflict of epic proportions, I was surprised again. But the story held together through the continuity of the strongly sympathetic character Christopher (and his alternate-universe friend Millie). The shifts in tone seemed natural concomitants of Christopher’s growing up and grappling with more mature problems.\n\nIn fact, starting on a small scale and gradually building up to grander events made the grander events more plausible, as in The Lord of the Rings. While the opening section of Christopher Chant wasn’t exactly realistic, the issues were more limited and personal. You had the sense of gradual expansion as the story went along.\n\nC.S. Lewis provides a more pronounced example of this effect in the last novel of his Space Trilogy, That Hideous Strength (1945). The novel starts out with extremely mundane matters of domestic ennui and academic politics. This establishes such a sense of realism and naturalness that the later fantastic developments, involving everything from cosmic entities and biological abominations to Merlin and Atlantis, gain plausibility from being built on so familiar a foundation.\n\nUncertainty About the Narrator\n\nAnother kind of story where it may be hard at first to make out the nature of the plot is the tale with an unreliable narrator.\n\nJo Walton’s Among Others (winner of the Best Novel Hugo Award in 2012) is a fantasy, but it’s set in the present day and much of the action is mundane. The main character, Morgana, is convinced that her mother is a witch. But for most of the book, I wasn’t entirely sure that was true; there was a distinct possibility that Mori was an unreliable narrator who was imagining the whole thing. Nor was it clear how the threat was going to be addressed. I only really grasped what the narrative arc was around p. 291 out of 302 pages—that is, at the very end.\n\nThe uncertainty didn’t impair my enjoyment of the story. Mori is an extremely sympathetic character, especially for those of us who loved F&SF back when those genres were considered odd and fans were regarded as uncool nerds. And the events of the tale are fascinating even when you aren’t quite sure they’re real. But the ambivalence of the plot kept me from forming a clear opinion about the book until the end.\n\nThe Nested or Layered Story\n\nOccasionally a story will contain one or more other storylines—not like the explicit play within a play that occurs briefly in Hamlet or A Midsummer Night’s Dream, but more subtly interwoven. This structure can make it hard to detect where the real plot of the overall story is.\n\nIn Patti Callahan’s Once Upon a Wardrobe, an Oxford student’s younger brother, who doesn’t have long to live, asks her to find out where the idea of Narnia in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (then just published) came from. The student, Meg Devonshire, tracks down the author, C.S. Lewis, and is drawn into hearing the story of Lewis’s life from Lewis himself. Sequences describing Lewis’s personal history are thus sandwiched with Meg’s reports to her brother. With the informal reportage building up to a kind of epiphany, one almost doesn’t notice that Meg’s own story is building toward a romance with a fellow student. The intertwined narrative arcs make it hard to guess in advance where the book will end up.\n\nMuch more complex is Jo Walton’s 2020 book Or What You Will, described in Wikipedia as a “metafictional fantasy novel.” The first-person narrator is a kind of character archetype in the mind of fantasy author Sylvia Harrison, the basis of characters in many of her stories. (The similarity of the imaginary Harrison’s oeuvre to that of the real-life Walton adds a further recursive layer to the story.) Fragments of Harrison’s personal history are intermixed with chapters about the story Harrison is writing, and also with the (fictional?) narrator’s plan to deliver Harrison from a fatal illness that may make this her last writing. Given these very different types of story, coexisting in the same book, it’s hard to know what kind of resolution we might expect. Yet in the end, as with Callahan’s book, the story works.\n\nThe Side Quest That Takes Over\n\nWe also see cases where what originally seemed to be a minor side trip or interruption turns out to be the main plot of the whole story. This can be irritating if we’re invested in what we thought was the original tale, and are waiting with mounting impatience for the interlude to conclude so as to get on with it. At some point we need to realize that the apparent side trip or side quest is the point.\n\nI had that reaction when first reading Howl’s Moving Castle (Diana Wynne Jones, 1986). Near the beginning, the young heroine, Sophie, is magically transformed into an elderly woman. Somehow I didn’t expect that transformation to last long. But in fact Sophie continues as an old woman for almost the entire novel. It took me a while to stop waiting for the transformation to be reversed and to accept it as a central feature of the plot.\n\nSometimes this is a matter of mistaking the main preoccupation of the author. David Weber’s Safehold series starts with the premise that alien invaders, attracted by Earth’s burgeoning technology, have wiped out the human race, with the exception of a secret colony planted on a distant Earthlike planet in hopes of growing back to a level capable of dealing with the invaders. The refugee world Safehold is deliberately kept under a rigid theocracy which suppresses technology, originally to avoid detection by the enemy, but later going far beyond that motive to a permanent proscription. One might expect that the main plotline of the series would involve reacquiring high technology and re-engaging the invaders. But so far the series has progressed through ten bulky books devoted almost entirely to detailing the military and political campaigns of a sort of Protestant Revolution to overthrow the dominant theocracy. I’m still waiting for the lengthy storyline to wrap around back to the plotline I want to see developed.\n\nSimilarly, John Ringo’s “Council Wars” series starts with an intriguing premise in which a high-tech near-future civilization on Earth collapses into a kind of pseudo-medieval chaos due to a conflict among the ruling council. In the initial high-tech utopia, people have entertained themselves by (among other things) participating in live-action game-playing, which involved biologically engineering dragons, randomly hiding useful minerals in artificial mountains, and so forth. The opening conflict thus sets up a situation in which the main characters need to operate in something rather like a D&D game or fantasy world, dragons and all, which they’d initially created themselves but no longer control. What baffled me as this story developed (four books so far) was that Ringo was more interested in military-SF preoccupations—what would combat be like using aircraft carriers with dragons instead of aircraft?—rather than riffing on the fantasy tropes themselves.\n\nDefying Narrative Conventions\n\nIn some cases, writers seem to be determined to depart from traditional narrative conventions in ways that make the storyline obscure. I’m generally skeptical about such attempted departures—they often seem mannered or artificial—but there’s no denying they sometimes produce interesting results. Or What You Will, cited above, is an example of an odd approach that nonetheless presents an engrossing and satisfying tale.\n\nThis Is How You Lose the Time War, a Hugo-winning 2019 novella, is a peculiar kind of epistolary story that consists of deliberately obscure messages left for each other by two time-traveling agents of opposing empires. It’s not clear at first where the story is going, and the message-writing format deprives the reader of the background information that might normally help establish what’s going on. But Time War eventually develops into a kind of romance, as well as a meditation on war and politics, that’s definitely worth reading.\n\nThere Is No Plot\n\nFinally, there’s a class of stories that don’t actually have an overall plot at all. This isn’t necessarily a fault, but can be a virtue: “a feature, not a bug.” In these kinds of stories, our natural tendency to look for a plot is bound to be frustrated.\n\nA fellow writer on Critique Circle, reading Kenneth Grahame’s The Wind in the Willows, expressed puzzlement about the plot of the book. I responded that it’s like Winnie-the-Pooh: a collection of linked but separate episodes that don’t actually have an overall plot. There is a sort of overall character arc for Christopher Robin, but it’s not really a plot—just as The Wind in the Willows develops a coherent plot only toward the end, within the background created by a set of separate episodes. My fellow writer, who was quite familiar with children’s stories, grasped the point at once from the Pooh analogy.\n\nWe also find the occasional short story that’s essentially a mood piece, evoking an emotion without actually depicting a sequence of events. In the science fiction canon, good examples include Arthur C. Clarke’s “History Lesson,” a meditation on the transience of the human species, and Ray Bradbury’s “There Will Come Soft Rains,” a moving story depicting the aftermath of a nuclear war. In these short pieces, however, there isn’t enough time to build up much readerly expectation to be frustrated; it quickly becomes clear that the point of the story is to express a mood rather than to tell a tale.\n\nWhen the plotline of a story doesn’t immediately become clear, or is subverted, the best advice may be simply to roll with it and see what happens. And I give myself that advice occasionally when I’m puzzled with a tale.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis does, however, require us to trust the author. Knowing an author’s work can give me confidence that taking the time to read will be worth it in the end. Hearing that an author or a work is highly regarded by others may, to a lesser degree, give us a similar confidence. If the author is new to us, though, that trust may be harder to come by. Lacking a sense of direction, we may give up on a story prematurely. If a writer isn’t going to meet the reader’s ordinary expectations about where a story is going, they’ll need to find other ways to reassure the reader that the tale is worth the investment of time.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEven though science fiction is often focused on the future, its assumptions are tied to the present.\n\nIn some respects this is obvious. A story about the near future can become dated by history itself. Every SF story prior to 1969 that describes the first moon landing in detail (happy 51st anniversary, last week!) is obsolete. And every story that predicted a smooth reach out into colonizing the solar system directly after that first landing, unfortunately, is also defunct. Stories can also be rendered unbelievable by scientific advance: all the delightful tales based on a habitable Venus or Mars are gone with the, er, vacuum.\n\nBut there’s also a subtler way. Even though F&SF specialize in examining our assumptions about the universe, the assumptions that seem plausible shift over time. Fashions change. To take a heartening example: SF stories from the late 1940s and the 1950s tended to take it for granted that there would shortly be a nuclear world war. (Hence it’s spot-on characterization when the 1955 version of Doc Brown in “Back to the Future” accepts Marty’s recorded appearance in a hazmat suit as logical because of the “fallout from the atomic wars.”) But for over seventy years, we’ve managed to avoid that particular catastrophe.\n\nOne assumption that’s always intrigued me is whether we are likely to meet people like ourselves—and I mean, exactly like ourselves—on another planet. If we discovered an Earthlike planet of another sun, might we climb down the ladder from our spaceship to shake hands with a biologically human alien?\n\nNot Really Alien\n\nI’m talking about a “convergent evolution” hypothesis—the notion that the human species might have developed independently more than once. And, incidentally, the standard biological definition of “species” as “interfertile” (a more precise definition can be found on Wikipedia) is what I’m using here; because, obviously, one of the potential uses of the assumption in a story is to make possible a romance between two characters from different worlds, and romance is not unrelated to sex and reproduction.\n\nSo we want to set aside, to begin with, a class of stories in which people from different planets are all human because they have a common ancestry. For example, in Jack Williamson’s classic space opera The Cometeers (1936), Bob Star finds his true love Kay Nymidee among the human subjects of the decidedly nonhuman masters of an immense assemblage of space-traveling planets, the “comet.” But the reason there are human beings present is that a research ship from Earth was captured by the Cometeers long ago, and these are the descendants of the crew.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for the inheritance to work the other way around. David Weber’s “Mutineers’ Moon” (1991) starts with the eye-opening assumption that our Moon is actually a long-inert giant spaceship—and reveals that the humanity of Earth is descended from the original crew members of that spaceship. Thus, it’s perfectly plausible when hero Colin MacIntyre falls for a preserved member of the original crew; they’re from the same stock. Similarly, in at least the original 1978 version of Battlestar Galactica, the human survivors of the “rag-tag fugitive fleet” are human because Earth itself was one of their original colonies, which apparently fell out of touch.\n\nThe Era of Planetary Romance\n\nIn the early days of modern SF—say, from about 1912 through the 1930s—it was commonly assumed that the answer was yes: human beings (with minor variations) might be found independently on other planets. Arguably, this may have been because the early planetary romances—melodramas set on exotic worlds, heavy on adventure and love stories—were less interested in science than in plot devices. But biology was less advanced in those days; recall that DNA was not identified as the basis of genetic inheritance until 1952. It’s easy to forget how little we knew about things we take for granted today, even in relatively recent periods.\n\nA classic early case is that of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Barsoom. In A Princess of Mars (1912), Earthman John Carter is transported by obscure means to Mars, called by its inhabitants “Barsoom.” Those inhabitants include the nonhuman “Green Martians,” but also people identical to humans in several colors, particularly the “Red Martians” among whom Carter finds his lady-love, Dejah Thoris. As a Red Martian, Dejah is human enough for Carter to mate with, and they have a son, Carthoris, thus meeting the “interfertile” criterion.\n\nTo be sure, the biology here is a little mysterious. Dejah looks entirely human, and even, to borrow a Heinlein phrase, “adequately mammalian” (see, for example, Lynn Collins’ portrayal in the loosely adapted movie John Carter (2012)). But Martians don’t bear their young as Earth-humans do; they lay eggs, which then develop for ten years before hatching. It’s not easy to imagine the genetics that could produce viable offspring from an individual whose genes direct live birth and one whose genes result in egg-laying. But that didn’t stop Burroughs.\n\nE.E. Smith, whose initial SF writing goes back just about as far as that of Burroughs, was willing to accept this trope as well. In The Skylark of Space (published 1928, but written between 1915 and 1921), our intrepid heroes travel to a planet inhabited by two nations of essentially human people—although the double wedding in the story does not involve any interplanetary romances, but is between two pairs of characters from Earth. Smith’s later Lensman series (1948-1954), which features one of the most diverse arrays of intelligent creatures in SF, also allows for apparently interfertile humans from a variety of planets. My impression is that this sort of duplication was also true of some of the nonhuman species in the Lensman unverse—there might be, say, Velantian-types native to planets other than Velantia.\n\nThis approach wasn’t universal in old-time SF. The more scientifically-minded John W. Campbell’s extraterrestrial character Torlos in Islands of Space (1930) was generally humanoid in form, but quite different in makeup: his iron bones, for instance. It’s been argued that a roughly humanoid form has some advantages for an intelligent species, and hence that we might find vaguely humanoid aliens on different planets—though this is pure speculation. But “humanoid” is a far cry from biologically human.\n\nWe see some persistence of this tradition into the second half of the twentieth century. Marion Zimmer Bradley’s iconic planet Darkover, for instance (first novel published 1958), is populated by the descendants of Terran humans from a colony ship and also by the elf-like indigenous Chieri, who, despite minor differences like six fingers and golden eyes, not to mention the ability to change sex at will, have interbred with the Terran immigrants.\n\nAn interesting variation can be seen in Julian May’s Saga of Pliocene Exile (first story published in 1981). When modern humans are sent on a one-way trip into the distant past, they are enslaved by the Tanu, aliens from another galaxy who have settled on Earth. The story indicates that the Tanu were specifically searching for a place where the local gene pool was similar to theirs—which might also account for why they came all the way from another galaxy (also a somewhat antique trope) to get here.\n\nIt’s slightly odd that, even where basically identical human beings turn up on other planets, other animals never seem to be similarly duplicated. On Burroughs’ Barsoom, one doesn’t ride horses, but thoats; is menaced not by tigers, but by banths; and keeps a calot, not a dog, as a pet. In a planetary romance or science fantasy setting, one is less likely to see Terran-equivalent fauna than parallel creatures with exotic names and slight differences—whence the SF-writing gaffe “Call a Rabbit a Smeerp” (see TV Tropes and the Turkey City Lexicon).\n\nAt the Movies\n\nThe all-too-human trope is carried on into the present day in video media—movies and TV. Again, this may be partly because the science is often subordinated to the plot; but the cost and difficulty of putting convincing nonhuman characters on-screen is surely another factor. Filmmakers’ ability to depict exotic creatures, however, has changed immensely in the last forty years, to a point where almost any imaginable creature can be created if the budget is sufficient. Thus, the original Star Trek series of the 1960s stuck largely to slightly disguised humanoid aliens, perhaps relying on the ‘universal humanoid’ hypothesis mentioned above, while later series were able to branch out a bit. Similarly, the Star Wars movies could readily give us nonhuman characters like Jabba the Hutt, Chewbacca, and C3PO; they, too, grew in variety as the capabilities of CGI and other techniques expanded.\n\nStill, it may be harder for us to adjust to interactions among characters where we can see their nonhumanity, rather than just reading about it. So we still tend to see extraterrestrial humans on-screen. The Kree in Captain Marvel (2019), for example, are indistinguishable from humans—an actual plot point, since this makes it possible for Yon-Rogg to tell Carol that she’s an enhanced Kree rather than a kidnapped human. The Kree do have blue blood, in the movie; it’s not clear what kind of biological difference (hemocyanin?) might result in that feature. We also see a number of alien humans in Jupiter Ascending (2015), though I think of that tale as a deliberate throwback to pulpish science fantasy or planetary romance.\n\nI keep wanting to cite the fictional novel written by George McFly as shown in the closing scenes of Back to the Future, “A Match Made in Space,” since the cover seems to suggest an interplanetary romance (and one thinks of George as a nerdy romantic); but it isn’t actually clear whether that’s the case. All we have to go on is the title and the cover, and that could just as easily depict a match between two humans, fostered by an alien matchmaker (or vice versa).\n\nThe Modern Era\n\nWe don’t see nearly as many extraterrestrial humans in modern SF, and for good reason.\n\nThe more we understand about genetics, the less likely it seems that another human species, so closely similar as to be interfertile, could evolve independently. What we know about evolution suggests that there are just too many random chances along the way—cases where the prevailing mutations might have turned out differently. Even if we assume that humanoid form is probable, why not have six fingers, or hemocyanin rather than hemoglobin? While I’m not well enough educated in biology to venture any actual probabilities, I think our growing sense of the complexity of the human body and its workings, over the last seventy years or so, has simply made it seem vanishingly unlikely that an independently evolved intelligence would come out that close to the human genotype.\n\nFor example, the scientifically-minded Arthur C. Clarke depicted a galaxy in which each intelligent species, including humans, was unique: The City and the Stars (1956, developed from an earlier story published in 1948). In one of the unused story fragments he wrote while working on 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), his hero, well along on his journey into mystery, thinks:\n\nHe did not hesitate to call them people, though by the standards of Earth they would have seemed incredibly alien. But already, his standards were not those of Earth; he had seen too much, and realized by now that only a few times in the whole history of the Universe could the fall of the genetic dice have produced a duplicate of Man. The suspicion was rapidly growing in his mind—or had something put it there?—that he had been sent to this place because these creatures were as close an approximation as could readily be found to Homo sapiens, both in appearance and in culture. (Clarke, The Lost Worlds of 2001, ch. 39, p. 220)\n\nContemporary SF writers who are really adept at building interesting and coherent aliens—David Brin and Becky Chambers, to name two of the best—give us a wide range of wildly exotic creatures from other planets, but not humans.\n\nIf we are still fond of the idea of interplanetary romance, we might find a possible work-around in the shapeshifter. The Tymbrimi female Athaclena in Brin’s The Uplift War (1987) uses her species’ unusual abilities to adjust her appearance closer to that of a human female—but of course she has an entirely different genetic heritage, as that ability itself demonstrates. The result wouldn’t meet our criterion of interfertility, no matter how close the similarity in physical structure. To adjust one’s genes in the same way would be another order of change altogether.\n\nThe 1984 movie Starman, in a way, plays off this idea. The alien in this case is apparently an entity made of pure energy, without a physical structure of its own. Using hair from the female lead’s deceased husband, it creates a new body with a human genetic structure. The two do, eventually, prove to be interfertile. If we’re willing to accept the notion of an energy being in the first place, this approach is actually more plausible than, say, mating with the oviparous Dejah Thoris.\n\nIf one were writing a SF story today, it would be rash to assume that Earthborn characters could run across independently evolved humans elsewhere. The idea may not be entirely inconceivable. But it’s out of fashion for good reasons. Attractive as the notion of interplanetary romance may be, at this point we’d best confine it to the kind of case noted above, where some common ancestry—no matter how far-fetched—can account for the common humanity.\n\nIntroduction\n\nI set out to do an analytical essay on Three Theories of Time Travel—until I realized that Larry Niven’s astute and entertaining brief article “The Theory and Practice of Time Travel” (1971) had already covered those theories pretty well. (You can find that article in Niven’s All the Myriad Ways, and a couple other locations.) So I decided instead to comment on how they’re used in Avengers: Endgame, which seems to invoke at least two and possibly three different theories.\n\nMaybe I’d have been better off sticking with the original plan; this post has turned out to be considerably longer than I’d planned.\n\nEndgame came out on April 26, 2019, and was released on disc August 13, so it’s still new enough at this writing that I should issue a\n\nI’m not going to address the mechanics of how one might travel into the past—whether via Tipler machines, or wormholes, or simply thinking oneself into the past à la Jack Finney. (Endgame manages it via what the movies refer to as the “Quantum Realm,” which is completely incoherent in one way but rather fascinating in another—a side issue I won’t go into here.) I’m interested in what happens if you let causality turn back on itself. I can think of three main ways of handling the question of changing the past. Each has its pros and cons, from a storytelling point of view.\n\n“Make It Didn’t Happen”\n\nFirst, let’s suppose we can change the past (and, by extension, the present and future). The idea arises because we often wish we could go back and undo something—either our own actions, or the broader course of history. Niven observes, “When a child prays, ‘Please, God, make it didn’t happen,’ he is inventing time travel in its essence.” He goes on to note, “The prime purpose of time travel is to change the past; and the prime danger is that the Traveler might change the past.” These twin aspects of the idea generate plot tensions and conflicts immediately, on both a personal and a historical scale, so it’s not surprising they’re so popular.\n\nThe most familiar example, of course, is Back to the Future (1985-1990). In the three movies, Zemeckis played several variations on the idea of making history come out differently. The cultural reference is so well-known that Marvel was able to riff off it for a comic moment in Endgame. Scott Lang, the young and relatively naïve Ant-Man, says they’ll be okay if they obey the ‘rules of time travel’ (at about 0:35). Tony Stark, the all-round genius of the Marvel movies, derides Scott for having gotten his “rules” from BTTF, and proceeds to shoot the notion down as hopelessly unscientific.\n\nAnd Tony’s right, in the sense that building a theory of time travel purely on the assumptions made in fictional stories is silly. We don’t know what would happen if it were possible to change the past; we haven’t done it. That would make time travel really dangerous if it could be attempted in real life. On the other hand, that same lack of knowledge leaves a wide field open for the fiction writer. We can make whatever assumptions we like, as long as they’re consistent. We can imagine that you can only go back in time a certain distance, at a certain geographical location, as in Julian May’s Saga of Pliocene Exile (1981-84). We can imagine that the transition requires vast energies, as in Arthur C. Clarke’s story “Technical Error” (1950). Or we can invoke the imaginary “Pym particles” of Ant-Man lore and time-travel at will.\n\nThis first theory of time travel generates the paradoxes we know and love. We have the “grandfather paradox,” in which an effect removes its own cause. (I go back in time and kill my grandfather.) We have what Wikipedia calls the “ontological paradox,” in which an effect becomes its own cause. (I go back but my grandfather fails to show up, so I marry my grandmother instead and name my son after my dad…) I talked about these a bit in a 2016 post on the TV series Timeless.\n\nOne thing that’s not always obvious is that the idea of changing the past requires a second time dimension. There’s the familiar one that’s typically represented by a “timeline,” a one-dimensional line ordering events from past to future. But if someone changes the past, then the old line has to be replaced by a new one: imagine a second timeline lying next to the first. Every time a change is made, another timeline gets added. The set of lines forms a plane, extending through a second dimension, in which each new timeline happens after (in some Pickwickian sense) the last. Otherwise, it wouldn’t make any sense to say that we’d changed history. Marty can’t rejoice in having “fixed” his family unless the new timeline succeeds the first, just as events along the timeline succeed each other. Hence, a second time dimension, to accommodate the sequence of timelines. (This may, or may not, be related to what TV Tropes calls “San Dimas Time,” a reference from Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure (1989).\n\nAs a narrative device, the chance to change the past creates suspense. But it only works if you don’t look too closely. The author has to stage-manage things carefully so that changes of all sorts don’t start happening in all directions, and this means that time travel must be rare. If we imagine a period of hundreds or thousands of years, during which people invent time machines every so often and start changing the past, it would become impossible to make sense of what was happening. Different changes, each with their rippling “butterfly effects,” would take place, one after another—or even at the same, er, time. (I tried playing around with that idea in an as-yet-unpublished story called Getting to Gettysburg.) So I’m skeptical about stories based on letting time travel become routine, as in “Time Patrol” scenarios or Asimov’s The End of Eternity.\n\nAvengers Disassemble\n\nDoes Endgame, after all Tony’s disclaimers, involve changing the past? Maybe not; but it’s hard to see how the story can avoid it.\n\nThe screenwriters chose to set themselves an interesting dilemma that makes the simple time-travel solution (go back and kill Thanos) unusable. When the time-travel possibility arises, five years have passed since the Snap, in which Thanos killed off half the people in the universe. Life has gone on. Tony and Pepper, for example, have an adorable little girl. But eliminating the Snap would also eliminate Tony’s little daughter Morgan, along with everything else that’s happened since. That’s unacceptable (at least to Tony). So the Avengers are not trying to avert the Snap; instead, they want to bring back, in the present time, all those who disintegrated.\n\nThe reason they have to go into the past is to retrieve the six Infinity Stones, which Thanos destroyed after the Snap. The Avengers will need to use the Stones for a Snap of their own to bring back all the people Thanos destroyed. But in order to avoid changing the past, they will have to put the Stones back in their earlier times after they’ve been used. This is a clever idea, but it’s going to be really tricky to execute in practice, as we’ll discuss below.\n\nIt’s Already Happened\n\nMeanwhile, the business of a second time dimension may make us start to wonder about the whole idea of changing the past. Maybe we’ve forgotten to take into account the integrity of the original time dimension. After all, if something happened in the past, it has already happened. The effects of past events should be baked into the present that follows from them. If I go back to 1800 and leave a hidden time capsule, let’s say, I should be able to dig it up in 2019. You might say that the change I wish to make has already taken place.\n\nBut it follows that if I can find the evidence in the present, then I know the event occurred in the past. (That’s what “evidence” means.) If I find the time capsule, I know that it was buried. This may allow me to predict or “retrodict” my future changes to the past on the basis of what’s known now. If I find the time capsule, I know I’m going to bury it—or someone else will. A key scene in Kate and Leopold (2001) relies on just such a discovery about a future event that changes the past. (Have we mixed up the tenses enough yet?) Bill and Ted makes even more comically inventive use of this aspect.\n\nBut on this theory, the event in the past isn’t really a change. It was always that way. The time capsule persisted through all the intervening time. You can’t change the past, because your change is already included in the past we know and thus embedded in the present. As Niven puts it, “any attempt on the part of a time traveler to change the past has already been made, and is a part of the past.”\n\nThis approach deprives us of the fun of changing history, but I rather like it. It ensures the timeline remains consistent with itself. In fact, one version of this postulate is referred to as the “Novikov self-consistency principle,” named for Russian physicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. We avoid grandfather paradoxes: we already know I didn’t succeed in traveling into the past and killing my grandfather, because here I am. If I try, something will go wrong. On the other hand, ontological paradoxes are still allowed, as in Heinlein’s classic novella By His Bootstraps (1941). In fact, I tend to think of this as ‘Heinlein’s theory of time travel,’ because he used it extensively—not only in Bootstraps and the even more baffling “—All You Zombies—” (1959), but also in the delightful The Door Into Summer (1957). Of course, Heinlein’s by no means the only writer using a Novikov-type theory.\n\nOne reason I like this type of time travel story is that everything fits neatly together, like a puzzle. The fun of the story is in seeing how they’ll fit. In that sense, the enjoyment of you-already-changed-the-past stories resembles that of the Greek tragedies, in which an oracular pronouncement tells what’s going to happen, and the story shows how it happens. No matter how Oedipus tries to avoid the awful future foretold, he can’t. The efforts to avoid the predicted outcome may themselves produce it.\n\nIn such a tragedy, where time travel isn’t involved (except to the extent the oracle itself is future information acting on the past), the Greek tragedy tends to suggest that the outcome is determined by some kind of Fate, whether we like it or not. (Niven puts this view under the heading of “determinism.”) But the Novikov-type theory can also be seen as compatible with free will. Even actions freely taken, once they are complete, become part of the fabric of history, not subject to further change afterwards—except to the extent that backward causation via time travel is possible, which alters the whole meaning of “afterwards.”\n\nA subclass of these stories assumes that the time continuum somehow defends itself against change. It may automatically “self-heal” to swallow up minor changes, or all changes: Edison doesn’t invent the light bulb, but someone else does. Or the time stream may simply be designed so that with “fail-safes” that prevent catastrophic causality failures. At the end of The Door Into Summer, the engineer hero seems to be speculating in this direction: if time travel could be used commercially, he thinks,\n\nit will be because the Builder designed the universe that way. He gave us eyes, two hands, a brain; anything we do with them can’t be a paradox. He doesn’t need busybodies to “enforce” His laws; they enforce themselves. (p. 158)\n\nIn a modern context, God seems to take over the role of Fate—not by predetermining everything, but by designing the system (i.e., the universe) so nothing can go fatally wrong with causality. Something similar, I think, lies behind the way the time travel “net” portal functions in Connie Willis’s time travel stories. If allowing something through the net would create a paradox, the net simply won’t open—which leads to some tortuous reasoning by the characters as to what is keeping the net from openingaat a particular moment. Something like Providence seems to be at work. The only causal loops allowed are what we might call ‘virtuous loops’—those that work out right.\n\nWhat makes this confusing is that we’re used to analyzing causality by looking at the conditions preceding the effect. Here, we don’t see the ‘virtuous loop’ conditions being set at any particular point in time. The conditions have to apply to the continuum as a whole—from outside it, in effect.\n\nYou Can’t Avenge the Future\n\nWhen Tony initially declares Scott’s proposed “time heist” impossible, the remaining Avengers bring in Bruce Banner as a substitute scientific resource. Banner (who now combines his own brain with the Hulk’s body) does make a nod to the fact that his scientific expertise is primarily in biology, not physics, but the story remains basically true to the comic-book idea that a scientific genius is a genius in every science. At about 0:59, Banner says something that sounds rather like the Novikov principle we’ve been discussing: if you kill someone in the past, that doesn’t erase their later selves. Apparently causality doesn’t propagate down the world lines of already-existing characters to wipe them out when their original causes go away. On this theory, Marty wouldn’t have had to worry about disappearing even if he couldn’t get his parents back together.\n\nOn the other hand, Bruce doesn’t seem to be saying you can’t kill the person in the past; he seems to be saying that if you did kill them, it wouldn’t make any difference. This may have more to do with what TV Tropes calls “ontological inertia” (see here, but also here). Bruce’s approach seems to allow for wild inconsistency in the timeline, because I can be alive in 2019 even after being killed in 1971.\n\nThe simplest answer may be to conclude that Bruce wasn’t a very good physicist; maybe Tony silently corrected Bruce’s theory when Tony finally did agree to join the party.\n\nBranching Timelines\n\nAt some point in SF history, people realized that the whole paradox thing could be avoided by introducing a third theory, the notion of multiple branching timelines. Niven’s phrase is “multiple time tracks.” If you change the past, the original future going forward from that point remains unchanged, but a new future comes into existence, branching off to take into account the change. (The character making the change always seem to end up in the new branch, not the old.) We can have our cake and eat it too: one version of me devours the cake, but another, equally real, version of me prudently saves the cake for later.\n\nThe multiple-timeline approach gains some headway from the general popularity of alternate-history stories, and some plausibility from the fact that physicists take seriously the suggested “many-worlds” interpretation of quantum mechanics. It appears to solve the problem of time paradoxes. However, it runs very close to an assumption that would make it impossible to tell a good story at all.\n\nStories are about action and choice. A mere recounting of a series of experiences that happen to someone wouldn’t be much of a story (which is one reason the ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey is so weak). James Michener’s introduction to the novel Hawaii (1959), which describes the geological formation of the islands, is only part of a story because it lays the groundwork for what the characters later say and do.\n\nIf every possible alternative branched off a new timeline whenever there were options, there would be no point in making a choice, because whichever choice I made, another version of me would make the opposite choice. Niven captures the problem exactly:\n\n. . . did you ever sweat over a decision? Think about one that really gave you trouble, because you knew that what you did would affect you for the rest of your life. Now imagine that for every way you could have jumped, one of you in one universe did jump that way.\n\nNow don’t you feel silly? Sweating over something so trivial, when you were going to take all the choices anyway. And if you think that’s silly, consider that one of you still can’t decide . . . (p. 117)\n\nThe title story in All the Myriad Ways explores exactly that issue—what would happen if people really started to believe that all alternatives were equally real.\n\nBut suppose we assume that every choice doesn’t spawn alternate universes—just the changes caused by time travel, by backward causality. That doesn’t destroy all narrative in the way just described. It just ruins the story you’re trying to tell. The main characters move heaven and earth to get into the past and make the necessary change. They succeed! Whew. Victory. —Except that in another universe, the original one, they didn’t succeed. Somewhere, the sad failures who are Marty McFly’s parents still languish by the TV. That’s not a really satisfying conclusion.\n\nAlternating Avengers\n\nThe multiple-timeline approach certainly comes up in Endgame. What I can’t make out is whether it prevails in the end, or is averted.\n\nAt about 1:24 in the movie, Bruce Banner is having a tense conversation with the Ancient One (Dr. Strange’s mentor) about the plan to return the stones to their original places in time. The idea is that if he takes the Time Stone from the Ancient One at (let’s say) 1:03:12 p.m. on January 31, 2010, and eventually Steve Rogers returns it to her at 1:03:13 p.m. on January 31, 2010, there won’t be a need for a branch to form. History continues on as it had always been. (Steve describes his mission concisely at 2:43 in the movie: “I know. Clip all the branches.”) Thus, the timeline of the movie, in which Thanos Snapped half the universe away, and five years later the assembled Avengers brought them back and did away with Thanos, remains the one-and-only timeline. There’s a helpful description of this procedure in an article from July 2019 (which is also full of spoilers, by the way).\n\nIf we leave aside how hard it would have been to put things back exactly as they were, given the butterfly effect—not all the Stone retrievals were as simple as Bruce’s—does this work? Did the screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) come up with a way to manage the dizzying time loops and still save the story?\n\nI’m still not quite sure. One glaring plot hole, as various people have pointed out, is that we have to account for Thanos himself. In order to give us a great battle at the end (and what a battle it is!), the movie has Thanos in pre-Snap 2014 discover what’s going to happen and time-travel forward to 2019, where he’s ultimately disintegrated by the Avengers. He never returns to 2014. That seems to mean that the disappearance of Thanos did create a branch, since if he vanished from 2014 and never came back, the Snap would never have occurred.\n\nAt least that reduces us to two timelines, the one we see in the movie and another where Thanos does not continue to exist after 2014. And, interestingly enough, the Avengers’ actions saved both of those timelines from the Snap. The people who lived through the movie timeline experienced the Snap, but the lost people were eventually returned. Meanwhile, in the new alternate timeline, Thanos never came back, he never got the Infinity Stones, and the Snap never occurred. That’s not such a bad (dual) ending.\n\nI don’t know. All these causal loops produce a kind of shell game in which I’m not quite sure how things came out. Nonetheless, it’s a great movie, if you like the Marvel characters at all. If you haven’t seen it, you shouldn’t have been reading this (but maybe the circuitous account above will be helpful). If you have—see it again! Just don’t try to go back to April to catch the premiere a second time; who knows what that would do to the space-time continuum.\n\nOne of the specialties of science fiction—and to some extent fantasy—is to evoke a sense of strangeness. In dealing with the alien, the cosmic, that which is far away in space or time, SF can make us feel we are encountering something that passes the limits of our knowledge or understanding.\n\nThis isn’t as easy as it looks.\n\nThe Used and the Unusual\n\nSince at least the original Star Wars (1977), it’s been good practice to portray a “Used Future.” Star Wars gave us a world full of beaten-up, grimy equipment that looked as if it had been duct-taped together. This is generally a good technique. It adds realism. We feel at home in a world where everything is not perfectly cleaned and aligned; it’s like where we actually live. There’s a sense of familiarity.\n\nOne opposite to the “used future,” of course, is the kind of earlier SF movie that was full of shiny, spotless spaceships and immaculate gizmos. But the sense of familiarity also has its own opposite: the thrill of unfamiliarity.\n\nOne way the challenge arises is with extraterrestrials. Suppose a story has us meeting intelligent aliens. If they seem just like us—“rubber-forehead aliens”—they won’t be convincing. We expect something from another world to be different. The writer or director has to show creatures, technologies, behaviors that are unlike anything we’ve seen on Earth.\n\nYet these things must also be believable. Something that simply looks random or arbitrary, like an abstract swirl of colors, won’t convince us we’re seeing a real thing at all. How do we thread the needle between the too-familiar and the unintelligible?\n\nJust Alien Enough\n\nNatural laws do enforce certain constraints on physical objects. But other characteristics are a matter of custom, design choices, or aesthetics. To show something convincingly alien, we need to know the difference.\n\nSometimes a single feature can be odd enough to alert us that we’re “not in Kansas any more.” The alien ship that appears in the movie Arrival looks strange at once, because it’s smaller at the bottom than at the top. It looks as if it’s upside-down or sideways. Not the way we’d build, yes. But is it physically impossible? Nope. The ship isn’t on the ground, balanced implausibly on a narrow end. It’s floating in the air. This not only frees the ship from the usual need for wheels or other supports; it also introduces a second, subtler strangeness. When we humans land somewhere, we expect to land, to set ourselves down securely on a surface. These folks seem quite comfortable floating just above the ground.\n\nA classic example is Arthur C. Clarke’s Rendezvous with Rama. A massive spacecraft—a spinning O’Neill cylinder—enters the solar system, apparently inert. A human crew matches course to explore it before its hyperbolic orbit takes it out into interstellar space again. The ship begins to “come alive” around them—but there’s no sign of intelligent life aboard. The explorers find one strange and amazing feature after another. The purpose of some becomes clear: the long, shallow rectangular valleys turn out to be immense lights that illuminate the interior. But they never find out the reasons for many other objects. In the end they have to cut loose from the vessel, letting it go on its mysterious way.\n\nClarke’s mastery of clear detail—how the airlock doors open, for instance—gives us the necessary sense of realism. But leaving many things mysterious evokes the sense of mystery and wonder that is among the most distinctive experiences in science fiction. The unfamiliar is clearly and concretely depicted, but the purpose remains obscure.\n\n(Parenthetically, I advise paying no attention at all to the dreadful sequels Gentry Lee wrote to Rama under Clarke’s direction. They make the classic mistake of erasing the mystery without replacing it with anything at all interesting. As with certain other sequels, the only thing for a conscientious reader to do is declare them non-canonical and pretend they never happened.)\n\nFor another Clarke treatment, remember 2001: A Space Odyssey. The mundane and even humdrum character of the long space voyage makes the psychedelic sequence at the end feel even weirder than it is in itself.\n\nSufficiently Advanced Technology\n\nExtraterrestrials need not be involved. Distance in time or space, and the concurrent advances in technology, can also provide a good foundation for the sense of strangeness. (It was, after all, Clarke’s Third Law that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”)\n\nAmong the numerous virtues of David Brin’s Hugo-winning novel Startide Rising is that sense of entering a new and unaccountable world. His Earthly spaceship crew of “uplifted” dolphins, with their small group of human companions, use advanced techniques that are still recognizable to us. But they’re dealing with galactic cultures that draw on hundreds of millions of years of accumulated science. The results can be mind-boggling. One species, for example, travels by using a captive creature that creates portals “by the adamant power of its ego—by its refusal to concede anything at all to Reality.” This isn’t your grandmother’s hyperdrive.\n\nThe body of another species, the Jophur, consists of a stack of distinct rings, like a child’s toy. The Brothers of the Ebony Shadows employ a probability weapon that sends out “waves of uncertainty.” The fact that these species are nonhuman is incidental to the fact that their immense background of far-advanced science lets them use techniques that seem to surpass our understanding.\n\nFor a purely human example, let’s look at Arthur C. Clarke’s The City and the Stars. (Clarke really had the knack for this sort of thing.) The main character, who bears the pedestrian name of Alvin, lives in Diaspar, the last city on Earth, billions of years in our future. The city’s structure does not erode or decay; it’s maintained by “eternity circuits” according to the model held in its master computers. The people do not die in a conventional sense. After living for a thousand years, each individual walks back into the Hall of Creation and is dissolved—but is also retained in the memory circuits, to be rematerialized eons later. Thus the population of the city is always changing, but the individuals continue. And that’s only the beginning . . .\n\nExotic Ways of Life\n\nTechnology is one thing; behavior is another. The City and the Stars does a terrific job of imagining how the society of Diaspar is shaped by the extraordinary conditions under which its people live.\n\nWhen I read Yoon Ha Lee’s Ninefox Gambit, it was billed as ‘military science fiction’—but it’s nothing like the general run of military SF. The six factions in the story make use of technologies that create real-world effects based on “formations” of people and their consensus beliefs. Much of the plot revolves around a revolt based on “calendrical heresy”—which is just what it sounds like: deviation from the standard calendars. In Lee’s world, calendrical uniformity isn’t just a matter of convenience, but of crucial importance. The resulting society is correspondingly peculiar. Reading the story makes you feel as if you’re constantly being knocked sideways.\n\nGreg Bear’s City at the End of Time combines present-day characters with those living in a city one hundred trillion years in the future. The far-future people consist of “noötic” or virtual mass, are defended by “reality generators,” and are trying to fight a cosmic entity that’s trying to destroy the universe by disintegrating its history, acting backward through time. The present-day people in mundane Seattle keep us grounded, but trying to understand the end-of-time characters and what they are doing requires a constant stretching of the imagination.\n\nStrangeness and Wonder\n\nThe sense of strangeness or mystery is one form of the “sense of wonder” often used to characterize science fiction. It takes us out of the mundane, makes us strain to conceive the inconceivable. We’re often told that world travel expands our horizons by exposing us to different places and cultures. Science fiction goes further: it exposes us to ideas and places and people that don’t exist in the world at all. At its limits, SF seeks to show us more than we can even comprehend. The lack of reality is compensated by the greater impetus to go beyond our mental limitations.\n\nTo achieve that experience, we seem to need the right combination of the familiar and the exotic. The weird stuff at the end of 2001 isn’t entirely successful, in my view: it’s too strange. Not only do we not understand what’s happening; we don’t quite feel there is anything to understand. You have to read the book to figure out what’s going on.\n\nBut when we have enough groundedness to effect the “willing suspension of disbelief,” yet enough mystery to defeat (in part) our attempt to understand, the combination is uniquely fascinating. As I noted at the beginning, this isn’t an easy balance to strike. But the payoff makes it worth attempting."
