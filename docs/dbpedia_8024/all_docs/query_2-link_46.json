        "text": "I recently noted while ‘Looking Back on the 2022 Clarke Award’ that the collection containing this chapter would be out shortly. And here it is …\n\nThe table of contents are as pictured below:\n\nAs you can see, it’s chock-full of good stuff but what particularly leapt out at me was the opening of Andrew M. Butler and Paul March-Russell’s ‘Introduction’:\n\nWriting in The Village Voice in 1998, Jonathem Lethem offered a day-dream of science fiction’s ‘squandered promise’, an alternative history in which Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow rather than Arthur C. Clarke’s Rendezvous with Rama, won the Nebula Award in 1973. Sf, liberated from its genre ghetto by the experiments of the New Wave, re-joined the literary mainstream. Lethem’s essay, even as it desires the dissolution of generic boundaries, insists upon them… (1)\n\nIf Lethem had been able to see further than the conventionality of Clarke’s prose, they argue, he might have been able to see in ‘the peculiarities of Clarke’s narrative’ – which include not just the sublime, but also queerness, weirdness and the decentring of the classical liberal human subject – a writer who deserves re-evaluation. This set-up works nicely for me because it eventually pays off in Butler and March-Russell’s description of my chapter:\n\nNick Hubble turns to the history of the Clarke Award, and assesses both the extent to which the prize has sustained Clarke’s legacy and the degree to which the annual shortlists have blurred the boundaries between sf and mainstream fiction, perhaps in ways that simultaneously disprove Lethem’s thesis and vindicate his former hopes for the genre. (10)\n\nI particularly like the apparent paradox highlighted here by the editors concerning the relationship between SF and mainstream fiction: the boundaries have blurred precisely because SF didn’t follow the apparent trajectory of the New Wave and merge fully into avant-garde literature. I’m tempted to write a cautionary alternate history in which the 1973 Nebula is the Jonbar point and the counterfactual victory of Gravity’s Rainbow leads to a present in which the high literary canon reigns supreme and SF is found only in grubby paperbacks with lurid covers, read by men in anoraks. The reality, of course, is that categories such as ‘mainstream fiction’ – and even ‘English Literature’ itself – are maintained by exclusion of genres that are considered irredeemably beneath them. (For that matter, Golden Age SF was generated and maintained by excluding the more heterogenous blend of fantasy, horror and adventure that previously characterised genre magazines in favour of a science/engineering focus). The ongoing collapse of all these boundaries just leaves us with fiction – a field in which SF (&F &H etc) is as good as any other bookshop category with the added bonus that it speaks to the accelerated social and technological changes we are living through.\n\nIn this respect, Clarke is one of the key cultural figures of our time. This was really brought home to me by Butler and March-Russell’s introduction, in which they argue that the disparity between Clarke’s continued popular influence, over everything from science communication to tech utopianism and environmentalism, and his critical status demands reassessment of his standing. They then launch this reassessment through a biographical account. What struck me in reading this are the parallels between Clarke and H.G. Wells, who was one of his literary heroes. Like Wells, from a very modest family background, Clarke first established himself as a popular science writer, he went on advocate world government and he ended up with a similar international status – mixing with political leaders and Nobel-Prize-winning scientists. There is a case to be made that they are the writers who frame the twentieth century. Wells’s status within English Literature has shifted over the last decade or so: where once he was framed as the straw man in relation to writers such as Henry James or Virginia Woolf, he has gained more prominence recently. Clarke has been largely ignored but, at the very least, he clearly should be included in even very traditional academic Eng Lit history – I do manage a brief discussion, alongside lengthier analyses of Tolkien and Wyndham, in my (literary history of the decade) chapter in The 1950s: A Decade of Modern British Fiction (in the Bloomsbury ‘Decades Series’, which I co-edit). However, with the gradual but consistent decline of ‘English Literature’ as an academic discipline (in terms of the numbers studying at A level and BA level), the opportunity has arisen to break with the canonical conceptions that have held sway since the Second World War. Clarke, with his legacy enshrined in the US-based Arthur C. Clarke Foundation for science education, the Sir Arthur C. Clarke Awards for space exploration and, of course, the Clarke Award, does offer a useful peg for supporting the kind of new cultural paradigm that is so desperately required as we go further into the twenty-first century.\n\nThis brings me back to my chapter on the Clarke Award. The title, ‘Thirty Years is Ample Time’, is a play on Clarke’s provocative statement in Childhood’s End (1953) that ‘Fifty years is ample time in which to change a world and its people almost beyond recognition’ (75). As I conclude in the chapter:\n\nIn fact, thirty years has proved ample time enough for the Award bearing his name to change completely how we think about the relationship between sf and literature. By being the bridge, as [Neil] Gaiman suggests, between the world of sf and the world outside, the Clarke has not just showcased the full range of possibilities of sf but also enticed mainstream literature within its portals. While some mainstream authors have been awarded for employing sf devices to illuminate their concerns, the net result has been as [China] Miéville implies, to make sufficiently advanced forms of sf and literature indistinguishable. (250)\n\nThis last claim derives from Miéville’s play on Clarke’s ‘Third Law’ (‘any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic’): ‘More and more readers can now agree, as Clarke Award-watchers have long known, that any sufficiently advanced science fiction is indistinguishable from literature’ (Miéville 2018: 189). But, less this be seen as a one-sided statement of values, Miéville goes on to confirm that, for him, the really exciting idea implicit to the Clarke Award is ‘that any sufficiently advanced literature must be indistinguishable from science fiction’ (Miéville 2018: 192). Clearly, ‘advanced’ here is not a reference to literary technique so much (although it still helps of course) as a measurement of sensitivity to social and technological change.\n\nThe time has come to set out in more detail the parameters of this ongoing paradigmatic cultural shift. Hence, I will be following up this chapter with project analysing the full history of the Clarke Award and what it reveals about the changing status of SF over the (now) thirty-five years of its existence. The idea is that this will eventually result in a book but in the first instance will consist of further posts here and elsewhere.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAndrew M.
