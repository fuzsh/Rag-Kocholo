        "text": "Clarke proposed geostationary communications satellites in a letter to Wireless World magazine in early 1945. Later in the same year he expanded on this idea in two more papers, one of which was published as Extra-Terrestrial Relays in Wireless World in late '45.\n\nThe article mentions the orbital altitude needed for a 24-hour orbital period (42000 km orbital radius), suggests a solar-thermal power source (photovoltaic technology being in its infancy, and possibly unknown to Clarke), and provides some figures for useful radio signal strength. Clarke was envisioning crewed science stations in geosynch orbit, with communication relays as an afterthought, which obviously isn't how things played out."
