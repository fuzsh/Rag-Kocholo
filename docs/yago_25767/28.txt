Princess Maria Anna Josepha of Saxony, Duchess of Saxony (Full German name: Maria Anna Josepha, Prinzessin von Sachsen, Herzogin zu Sachsen[1][2]) (born 13 December 1929 in Bad Wörishofen, Bavaria, Germany[1][2]) is a Princess of Saxony and member of the House of Wettin by birth and a Princess of Gessaphe and member of the House of Afif-Gessaphe by marriage. Mathilde is the third child and second-eldest daughter[1][2] of Friedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen and his wife Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn and Taxis and a younger sister of Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen[1][2], the current head of the Royal House of Saxony and senior claimant to the defunct throne of the Kingdom of Saxony.

Marriage and issue[]

Anna married Roberto de Afif, Prince of Gessaphe, son of Alexander de Afif and his wife Maria Atthye[1][2], on 1 May 1953 in Paris, France.[1][2] Anna and Roberto had three sons:[1][2]

Alexander de Afif, Prince of Saxe-Gessaphe (born 12 February 1953 in Munich)

Friedrich Wilhelm de Afif, Prince of Saxe-Gessaphe (born 5 October 1955 in Mexico City)

Karl August de Afif, Prince of Saxe-Gessaphe (born 1 January 1958 in Mexico City)

In May 1997, Anna's elder brother Maria Emanuel, who has upheld the dynasty's marital standards despite its deposition and exile, recognized her eldest son Alexander de Afif as his heir. By formally adopting him two years later, Maria Emanuel conferred upon Alexander the legal surname of "Prinz von Sachsen" (Prince of Saxony). Thus was created the family of Saxe-Gessaphe, a cognatic offshoot of the royal House of Wettin: With the approval of Maria Emanuel, Alexander, his sons and brothers are also known as Princes of Saxe-Gessaphe.[3]

In the spring of 1997, it was announced that the remaining male dynasts of the Royal House of Saxony (presumably Princes Albert, Dedo, Gero (1925 - 2003) had met and consented to the designation of Alexander as dynastic heir in the event that none of them leave sons by dynastically valid marriages.[4]
