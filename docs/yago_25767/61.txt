Friedrich Christian became the heir apparent in 1923 when his older brother, Crown Prince Georg renounced his rights and became a Roman Catholic priest. King Friedrich August III abdicated in November 1918. He died in 1932, and Friedrich Christian succeeded as head of the Saxony royal house.

Princess Maria Teresita is the first Saxon princess to wed in Dresden, the capital of the former kingdom, since 1886, when Princess Maria Josefa of Saxony, sister of King Friedrich August III, married Archduke Otto of Austria. They were the parents of Karl I, the last Emperor of Austria.
