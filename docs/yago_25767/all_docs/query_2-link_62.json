        "text": "From Harper's BAZAAR\n\nThis weekend, Prince Konstantin of Bavaria got married, and a whole host of celebrities and members of the royal family stepped out to celebrate, including the much-loved Princess Sofia of Sweden.\n\nPrince Konstantin married Deniz Kaya in St Moritz in Switzerland this weekend, in a stunning church ceremony. As the son of Prince Leopold and Princess Ursula of Bavaria, Prince Konstantin's wedding attracted a lot of famous faces, some of whom traveled quite a distance to witness the nuptials.\n\nNotably, Princess Sofia and her husband, Prince Carl Philip of Sweden, Duke of Värmland, were in attendance at the big day. As always, Princess Sofia looked completely flawless as she donned a jaw-dropping baby blue gown.\n\nPrince Konstantin's wedding took place in a French church, Eglise au Bois, in Switzerland, that looks like it was plucked right out of a fairytale:\n\nMeanwhile, the bride and groom looked completely in love as they posed for photos after the ceremony:\n\nSpecial guests attending the wedding included model Marlies Pfeifhofer:\n\nMaria Astrid Princess of Liechtenstein was also invited:\n\nAs was actress and director Mafalda Millies:\n\nPrincess Sofia and husband Prince Carl Philip of Sweden welcomed their second child together just last year. Back in August 2017, People reported that the royal couple's announcement read (translated from Swedish), \"On Thursday, 31 August at 11:24 a.m., Princess Sofia welcomed a healthy and prosperous child at Danderyd Hospital. Both mother and child are doing well.\" The royal couple's first child, Prince Alexander, was born in April 2016.\n\n('You Might Also Like',)"
