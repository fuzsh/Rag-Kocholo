        "text": "Visiting Hungary you can often see the statues of St. Stephen (1000-1038), the first Christian king of the country and visit historical monuments that were named after the king, such as St. Stephen’s Basilica in Budapest. Unfortunately, there is little talk about the spouse of the Hungarian king, even if the role of Gisela is undeniable in the Hungarian history.\n\nGisela of Liudolf dynasty was born in Bavaria. The date of birth is not certain, based on some sources 974-975, based on other ones around 984. Her father was Henry, duke of Bavaria and Carinthia, while her brother was Henry II, the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Unfortunately, we don’t know many about Gisela’s childhood. The princess was educated according to Christian values ​​and wanted to dedicate herself to the life of a nun. She was very young when the Hungarian delegation made the marriage offer to the imperial court and since then Gisela prepared to help her future husband spread Christianity in whole Hungary. Gisela married crown prince Stephen in the following year in Scheyern (Southern Bavaria). This marriage was the first dynastic marriage with a Western European bloodline in the Hungarian history, and at the same time, it was an important step towards Western Christianity.\n\nIn the princess’ companion, many German knights and missionaries came to Hungary. Thanks also to Gisela, Stephen was crowned as king at the Christmas of 1000 (previously he was prince of Hungary) and therefore he was the first Christian king on the Hungarian throne. Of course, not everyone accepted the new religion or the new order of succession of the throne. The German knights defended it both in the war against Koppány in 997 and against other rebels.\n\nGisela chose Veszprém for her residence that was the centre of an important bishopric already in that period. The princess, together with her husband, also founded the Church of Óbuda and Veszprémvölgy and several monasteries, furthermore, she personally helped the spread of Christianity in Hungary. Gisela together with her German and Hungarian maids-of-honour embroidered numerous chasubles and cloaks including the coronation mantle of Stephen.\n\nStephen and Gisela probably had five children, two of whom are also known by name: Otto and Henry (later Imre). The three daughters and Otto died as infants so Imre became the crown prince of Hungary. Gisela lost her last son in 1031 in a hunting accident and her husband in 1038. She then remained in Hungary but her position was not stable during the reign of the following kings, Peter I. and Samuel I. In 1044, she left Hungary and returned to Bavaria. At the end of her life, she lived in Passau in a monastery until her death in 1065. Her tomb in the Monastery of Niedernburg is a pilgrimage site, and the cross used by her during her prayers (Gisela Cross) became a relic that nowadays you can visit in Munich.\n\nThanks to her abstinent life and her important role in the spread of Christianity in Hungary, Gisela was beatified in 1911 by Pope Pius X."
