        "text": "In my previous blogs, I wrote about Marie Valerie, Sisi’s favorite daugther and the mystery around her son’s death, Rudolf, at Mayerling. But did you know that she had another daughter? Her name was Gisela Louise Marie of Austria and she was born on the 12th of July 1856. She was the second child and daugther of Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Elizabeth (Sisi).\n\nYouth and death of her sister Sophie\n\nBoth girls were taken away from their mother by Archduchess Sophie (Sisi’s mother-in-law and aunt) directly after their births on account of the Empress being too young to raise two children. Elisabeth tried for a long time to have Franz Joseph change his mother’s mind, but wasn’t succesfull.\n\nWhen the couple visited Hungary in 1857, she was allowed to bring along her two girls – against the will of her mother in law. Unfortunately, both sisters fell ill with diarrhea and had a very high fever. Ten-month-old Gisela recovered quickly. However, two-year-old Sophie’s body could not take it. At 21:15 in the evening, after eleven hours of struggling to survive, Sophie died in her mother’s arms.\n\nThe death of her oldest child would haunt Empress Elisabeth during her entire life. Elisabeth was held indirectly responsible for Sophie’s death by her mother-in-law. After this, Archduchess Sophie indisputably took the responsibility of the upbringing of the imperial children. Elisabeth also started to neglect her surviving daughter, and their relationship was never a close one.\n\nIn 1858, the Imperial couple had another child, Rudolf, the long awaited son. Gisela and Rudolf would be very close.\n\nGisela was also close with her father. Their characters were quite similar. Her father collected some of the family’s personal items, such as her first pair of shoes and a poem written for him by a young Gisela one Christmas – the poem was said to be the most treasured item among this collection.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn 20 April 1873, at the age of 16, Gisela was married to Prince Leopold of Bavaria in Vienna. Prince Leopold, son of Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria, was Gisela’s second cousin. Leopold initially wanted to marry Princess Amalie of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, but she was already intended for Sisi’s younger brother Duke Maximilian Emanuel in Bavaria. An encounter was arranged by Sisi at Gödöllő Palace between Gisela and Luitpold and they got engaged.\n\nSisi was not present at Gisela’s wedding celebrations. The young couple settled after the wedding in the Palais Leopold residence in Schwabing. The street opposite the Palais was renamed Giselastraße in her honor in 1873.\n\nFamily\n\nA year after her wedding, she gave birth to her first child. Empress Elisabeth was present during the baptism. Gisela and Leopold had four children in total:\n\nPrincess Elisabeth Marie of Bavaria (1874–1957), who married Otto Ludwig Philipp Graf von Seefried auf Buttenheim\n\nPrincess Auguste Maria of Bavaria (1875–1964), who married Joseph August, Archduke of Austria\n\nPrince Georg of Bavaria (1880–1943), who married Archduchess Isabella of Austria\n\nPrince Konrad of Bavaria (1883–1969), who married Princess Bona Margherita of Savoy-Genoa\n\nAfter her brother’s death in 1889, Gisela took over a variety of social and political issues and founded charities. She was commonly known as the Good Angel from Vienna and became patron for a number of institutions.\n\nThe end\n\nGisela and her husband celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1923. Her husband died in 1930, and Gisela only survived him by two years. She died aged 76 in Munich on 27 July 1932, and is buried next to Prince Leopold in the Colombarium at the St.Michaelskirche, Munich.\n\nDo you want to see more pictures of Gisela?
