        "text": "-FAMILY THEME-\n\nArchduchess Gisela Louise Marie of Austria was the second daughter and first surviving child of Franz Joseph and Sisi. She was born on 12 July, 1856. She had an older sister and two younger siblings. She was christened like Gisella, but she wrote her name with one ‘l’.\n\nJust like her older sister Sophie, her grandmother, Archduchess Sophie took her from her mother and she raised Gisela too.\n\nIn 1857, when the imperial family visited Hungary she became ill, but recoverd quickly. Unfortunatelly Sophie died, her body couldn’t fight with typhus.\n\nAfter that Sisi suffered from depression and she left Gisela’s raise to her mother-in-law. That was the point, when mother and daughter started to be further from each other.\n\nIn the next year Rudolf was born. Sophie took him from Sisi too, so the children grew up together. Their relationship was very good and they were so close to their sibling.\n\nGisela lived in the Austrian court, with or without her mother until 1873. In this year she got married to her second cousin, Prince Leopold of Bavaria.\n\nThe husband’s family welcomed Gisela so warmly, and I can say that their marriage was happy. The couple lived in Munich as members of the Wittelsbach family.\n\nGisela’s first child was born in 1874. The baby was a girl, called Elisabeth (1874 – 1957) after her grandmother. Sisi was the baby’s godmother.\n\nLater the couple had three other children:\n\nPrincess Auguste (1875 – 1964), who was Archduchess of Austria by marriage.\n\nPrince Georg (1880 – 1943), his wife was Archduchess Isabella of Austria.\n\nPrince Konrad (1883 – 1969), who married\n\nPrincess Bona Margherita of Savoy-Genoa.\n\nGisela’s mother didn’t visit them a lot, but her father and younger sister, Valerie did. Gisela had a good relationship with her father and sister too. She also kept touch with Rudolf so seriously. After his death she was sad. Before that she tried to propitiate Franz Joseph and the Crown Prince, but she failed.\n\nSince she lived close to her maternal grandparents she visited them often.\n\nAfter her mother’s death she inherited the Achilleon. She sold it to Emperor Wilhelm II.\n\nBetween 1898 and 1916 she was the head of the Order of the Starry Cross.\n\nDuring the World War I she hewed a hospital in their palace. After the end of the war the couple had to escape. They lived in lots of place, once they went to Tyrol (Austria). When the situation seemed to be fine they moved back to Munich.\n\nOn 20 April, 1923 the couple could celebrate their golden anniversary. Leopold died in 1930, and Gisela survived him by only two years. She died on 27 July, 1932 at the age of 76 in Munich. She was the last member of Sisi and Franz Joseph’s immediate family.\n\nGisela was raised to be a good mother and wife. She loved helping people very much."
