Her parentage of Liudolf is confirmed by the sources, and her marriage was c1002, so her DOB here has been changed to c989.\n\nGisela of Swabia (989 or 990 – February 14, 1043 in Goslar) was the daughter of Herman II of Swabia and Gerberga of Burgundy.\n\nShe first married Bruno I, Count of Brunswick, in 1002.

MARCH of FRISIA\n\nThe March of Frisia was presumably established by the kings of Germany as a response to the activities of Dirk III Count of Holland, whom Thietmar records (as \"Dietrich the empress's nephew\") attacked Adalbold Bishop of Utrecht in 1018, before his forces were attacked by the Frisians and suffered numerous casualties[815].\n\nThe precise date when the March was first established is not known. Liudolf von Braunschweig is the first person who appears with the title, from 1028.\n\nHis candidature was presumably approved because his paternal grandfather, Ekbert [I] \"der Einäugige\", held counties in Frisia (see the introductions to Chapters 8 and 9 above). According to Vanderkindere, Liudolf's son and grandson, both named Ekbert, were also installed in the march of Frisia[816]. Although the primary sources indicate that they held land in Frisia, their march was Meissen.\n\nHeinrich Graf von Northeim, whose wife was heiress of the Brunswick family, was installed as Markgraf in Frisia in 1101 but was killed while trying to subdue the territory.\n\nLIUDOLF von Braunschweig, son of BRUNO [I] [von Braunschweig] & his wife Gisela of Swabia ([1003/05]-23 Apr 1038).\n\nThe Annalista Saxo names \"Liudolfus comes Saxonicus, filius Brunonis de Bruneswic et Gisle inperatricis\", when recording his death[817].\n\nHis parentage is confirmed by the charter dated 1051 under which \"Heinricus…Romanorum imperator augustus\" donated \"comitatum quem Brun eiusque filius noster frater Liutolfus nec non et eius filius Echbreht comites…in pagis Northduringen, Darlingen, Valen, Salthga, Grethe, Mulbeze\" to the church of Hildesheim[818].\n\nName: Gisela von Schwaben //\n\nName: /Gisele/\n\nName: Gisele /Swabia/[1]\n\nName: Gisela, of Swabia.
