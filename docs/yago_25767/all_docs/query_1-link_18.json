        "text": "​\n\nThe Ducal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha​\n\nHouse of Wettin​\n\nThe line was founded in 1680 by Johann Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Saalfeld, who inherited Saxe-Coburg from his brother in 1699.\n\nAssumed the title Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in 1735.​\n\nOn the rearrangement of the Saxon Duchies following the extinction of the line of Gotha in 1825, Duke Ernst I received Gotha and ceded Saalfeld to Saxe-Meiningen.\n\nIn 1826 he became Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.​\n\nThe dynasty ceased to reign in 1918.​\n\nMembers of the Ducal Family bear the title of Prince or Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duke or Duchess of Saxony, with the qualification of Highness.​\n\nThe current Head of the Ducal House is HH Andreas, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, born 1943.​\n\n+ + + + + + + + + + + + ​\n\nI would like to start a thread about the current Coburgs. Photos, current goings on of this family, their organization, discussion about any and all relevant factors to them. Perhaps some general history, etc... I know little about them and there is surprisingly little info beyong basic bio stuff. It seems to me that there should be more about them, as they are rather central in a hereditary and historical sense to rest of the European royal \"community\". Any and all info posted would be of great interest to me, and I'm sure to the rest of the LTR group. Thank You, DM​\n\nJosefine said:\n\ncan someone post some bios of a few of the members of this family and maybe some photos\n\nwhat kind of conacts do theu have with different royal famlies\n\nApart from the family webpage that i posted above, there is not a great deal available on the family, however Netty's page below features a couple of small biographys:\n\nhttp://www.nettyroyal.nl/\n\nAs for links to other Royal Familys - the most famous is that the British Royal Family had the House name Saxe-Coburg-Gotha between 1901-1917. Queen Victoria married Prince Albert of SCG and thus their son Edward VII took the name. However the House name was changed by Prince Alberts grandson George V in 1917 to the House of Windsor in view of anti-german centiment during WW1.\n\nKing Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden's mother was Princess Sybilla of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nThe Royal Families of Bulgaria and Belgium are also decendents of the Saxe-Coburgs.\n\nsachsen-coburg and gotha\n\nwhat about the children of prince andreas of sachsen-coburg and gotha?\n\nwhat they are doing?\n\nno one of them is married or not? i heard prince hubertus has an girlfriend since some years now? is she noble or commoner?\n\nand what about prince alexander and princess stephanie?\n\ni heard prince alexander is a little kind of \"playboy\"!! he has a lot of girlfriends and changes them a lot.\n\nwho are the goodparents of them?\n\nHis Lordship said:\n\nThat is correct, the British Royal Family's name before the name change was Wettin from Albert. The name change came about from the anti-German sentiments around WWI and the hatred against Kaiser Wilhelm.\n\nThe correct family name now is Mountbatten-Windsor...QEII made the change I believe around 1960.\n\nNo it's not. The name of the RF is still Windsor. Mountbatten-Windsor is for the (male line ) descendants of EII and Phillip.\n\nVon Schlesian said:\n\nIn addition, HM Queen Victorias' mother was also a member of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha family. Her older brothers being HM King Leopold of the Belgians, and HRH The Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nDuring the 19th century and/or early part of the 20th century there were Saxe-Coburgs on thrones in Germany, London, Lisbon, Sofia, Brussles, Mexico City, Bucharest, and briefly in Rome (Marie Jose), and even almost in Austria (Crow Princess Stephanie). Plus descendants via female lines sat on numerous thrones as well -- e.g. Russia, Spain, the German Emperor, Hesse, Greece, Norway, etc.\n\nThe Many Houses of Wettin\n\nCharles said:\n\nI always refer to this family as the House of Wettin. The territory was called Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha (Saxe-Coburg and Gotha).\n\nThe problem here is that \"Wettin\" can refer to the dynasties of any one of the Saxon Duchies and Kingdom. So I guess that's why its more accurate (or specific) to call them Saxe-Coburg, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Weimar, and Saxony.\n\n.\n\nInfo on Duke Carl Eduard of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\n\nI found some info on this royal from the following websites: \"Online Gotha\" and \"Monarchies of Europe\".\n\nCarl Eduard (1884-1954) was born: Leopold Charles Edward George Albert, Prince of Great Britain and Ireland. He was the son of Prince Leopold of Great Britain and Ireland (1853-1884) and Princess Helene of Waldeck-Pyrmont (1861-1922). He succeeded his uncle Prince Alfred on July 30, 1900. He became known as CARL Eduard, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. He and his family were stripped of their British titles in 1919. Carl Eduard became a Nazi supporter. He was placed in an internment camp after WW II. He later lived a life of seclusion.\n\nHe had the following children:\n\n(1) Johann Leopold (1906-1972)\n\n(2) Sibylle (1907-1972) (Married Gustaf Adolf of Sweden in 1932)\n\n(3) Dietmar Hubertus (1909-1943)\n\n(4) Caroline (1912-1983)\n\n(5) Friedrich Josias (1918-1998) (Grandfather of Hubertus, Alexander, and Stephanie).\n\nHere is a postcard I have of the family of Duke Carl Eduard:\n\nhttp://photobucket.com/albums/y138/loejil/Royal%20Families%20from%20different%20parts%20of%20Germany/?action=view&current=RoyalFamilyofSachsen-Coburg-GothaCircaWWIera.jpg\n\nLeft to Right: Dietmar Hubertus, Viktoria Adelheid, Sibylle, Caroline, Johann Leopold, and Carl Eduard. Friedrich Josias was not born yet when this photo was taken. Circa 1915.\n\n*You can also see other postcards I have of other German Royals by clicking on \"next\" at the top of the page that I have the above postcard on it.\n\nI know that this is a forum about the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha Family but I would like to ask a question about the Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach family. Can someone translate the writing on this German postcard? It is suppose to be a message written by Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen (1890-1972), who was married to Grand Duke William Ernst of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1876-1923). The postcard shows her children-Sophie (1911-1988) and Wilhelm Ernst (1912-1988). What does anyone know about this family?\n\nHere is the link to view the postcard:\n\nhttp://photobucket.com/albums/y138/loejil/Royal%20Families%20from%20different%20parts%20of%20Germany/?action=view&current=WilhelmErnstandSophie.jpg\n\nHi, this is my first post here. It's very interesting the amount of interest in the Royal families.\n\nI found this thread and wanted to say that the Coburg family is doing fine. Hubertus is now a lawyer, Alexander and Stephanie are working with the family organization. Andreas and Carin are doing well attenting to the family organization as well in Coburg.\n\nYou will find some interesting information on the Coburgs here:\n\nHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha\n\nHead of Ducal House\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Andreas_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha\n\nInteresting story of Andreas's father\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Friedrich_Josias_of_Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\n\nciaobetty22 said:\n\nI agree, there is not a lot of information about this family and it would be nice to get more info. They are very under-represented in any royal forums. Current pics would be a plus too!\n\nThe reason we don't see much of them is that the Saxe-Coburgs keep a very low profile. They may well attend the German and Austrian aristocratic weddings and social events, but any photographs don't seem to be widely published.\n\nciaobetty22 said:\n\nCurrent pics would be a plus too!\n\nIt's hard to find pictures of this family, but there's a nice photo session of the head of the Ducal family, Prince Andreas, with his wife, Princess Corin, and their children (Stephanie, Hubertus and Alexander), from their vacations in Karwendelgebirge, back in 1998.\n\n(I must add that Hubertus is even more good-looking now... )\n\nPhotos by SeegerPress:\n\nPrince of Chota said:\n\nMy favourite line of Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha is the Kohary branch, which is descended from Louis Philippe of France and Don Pedro II (Emperor) of Brazil.\n\nAre you able to read German? Then this book might interest you, if you don't know it already, that is...\n\n[FONT=arial, helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=-1]KNODT, J.:\n\nFerdinand der Bulgare.

One Saxe-Coburg-Gotha marrying the Kohary-heiress, then their son marrying the heiress of Portugal, another descendent becoming first the duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, then duke of Saxony and finally tsar of Bulgaria... quite the career!\n\n[/SIZE][/FONT]"
