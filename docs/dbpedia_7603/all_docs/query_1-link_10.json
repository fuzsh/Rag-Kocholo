        "text": "Dennis Schröder became the majority owner of Basketball Lowen Braunschweig, according to Braunschweiger Zeitung and SPONSORs. The point guard of the Hawks said in February that his goal was to become the co-owner of the German team and help the club to become of the top five in Bundesliga.\n\nHawks, Clippers interested in Aleksa Avramovic?\n\nAleksa Avramovic has drawn the attention of the Atlanta Hawks and the Los Angeles Clippers, according to Ozon Press. The two NBA teams are reportedly interested in acquiring the Serbian guard, who has an NBA out clause in his contract with CSKA Moscow.\n\nMarc J. Spears: Word on the street is the Dallas Mavericks are hiring former Knicks scout Makhtar N’Diaye as director of pro personnel and international scouting. The former Vancouver Grizzlies big man was with the Knicks as a scout for nine years.\n\nOn Saturday, hundreds of Wake County families found much-needed relief at the Boys and Girls Club on North Raleigh Boulevard, where a large back-to-school giveaway took place. Organized by North Carolina Central University basketball coach LeVelle Moton and LA Clippers star PJ Tucker, the event provided more than just supplies; it offered hope and inspiration.\n\n“Hakeem is a beast in every sense on the floor. He’s in the Top 10 in every NBA category—steals, rebounds, points,” Cassell said. He acknowledged that Jokic might score more points but believed Olajuwon’s relentless pressure would be decisive. “I think Jokic would score more points, but Hakeem would win because he would constantly pressure him. Jokic wouldn’t be able to do damage in the post; it simply wouldn’t happen.”\n\nOscar Robertson says Russell Westbrook receives unfair blame in the NBA\n\nSpeaking exclusively with Denver Nuggets on SI at the 24th Annual Harold and Carole Pump Foundation Gala, Oscar Robertson said Russell Westbrook has been receiving unfair blame throughout his NBA career. “For some strange reason, I don’t know why they want to keep blaming everything that happens on him,” Robertson said of Westbrook. “When he plays he is dynamic, he gives the team a spark. Then all of a sudden they don’t care for him, they don’t want him.”"
