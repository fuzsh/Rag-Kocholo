        "text": "Players from United Soccer League (USL) in Germany! Over the years I transferred many dozen of players from Major League Soccer, United Soccer League (USL) or Canadian Premier League to Germany. In DFB we have the three federal pro leagues: Bundesliga 1, 2 and 3. Liga (~56 teams) and five leagues in 4th tier/division Regionalliga S√ºdwest, West, Nord, North-East and Bavaria (~90 teams). Within all of those levels from Bundesliga down to Regionalliga (most U23/21 teams of the top teams play there) I signed and/or transferred many North American players. If a player or club approaches me about a move to Germany we do our research about the player and then (like it or not üòâ) tell them our honest opinion. Important for a successful career or transfer is to find the right environment for the player. With environment I mean the level, the setup of the club, the team, the technical staff, our experience with the interested clubs, the mind set of the player, his goals, the goals of the club, the chances/opportunities, etc. etc.etc‚Ä¶ A lot of people in pro soccer not really knowing the German pro market react to our assessments with something like this: ‚Äû‚Ä¶but he/I can play on a higher level‚Ä¶‚Äú. We then explain how important a (good/impressive) start is for any international coming first time to Germany and especially if the plan of the player or ‚Äûselling‚Äú club in North America is a longer career/higher ‚Äûrevenue‚Äú (i.e. participation on future transfers, etc.) in the UEFA /DFB pro world. A lot of clubs / players just focus on getting to Europe, making a/any transfer fee, etc. but do not see the opportunities, risks, downsides, etc. if a wrong /risky decision is made. The publishing /articles of clubs making a transfer (fee) to Europe is often euphoric when it happens and we understand that, but don‚Äôt forget about year two, three, four, etc. We established a data base about United Soccer League (USL), Major League Soccer or Canadian Premier League Players who signed or got transferred to Germany to see if and how their career progressed. I am sure pro leagues or clubs in North America also track their transfers/‚Äúsales‚Äù to Europe to see if they made the right decision, worked with the right people, clubs, etc. and what could have been better and (!) how their / his decision influenced the career of their/the player‚Ä¶. To round up my small post (‚ÄúPlayers from United Soccer League (USL) in Germany!‚Äù) I just read an article about the German club Greifswalder FC (Toni Kroos & Felix Kroos started their career at this club) and I happend to sign two players from United Soccer League (USL) with Greifswalder FC and David Wagner and Lars Fuchs. https://lnkd.in/ezS4Cu_n\n\nEuro 2024 kicks off tonight at 21:00 with the match between Germany and Scotland in Munich. After the poor opening games of previous tournaments, the German team led by Julian Nagelsmann is determined to get off to a better start today. Fabian Wunderlich's and my European Championship predictions, which will also be published daily this tournament, give us hope that things will go better this time. The two teams that meet are compared in four categories: their ranking at the last European Championship in 2021, their place in the world rankings and the average market value of the players in the squad. The most important category, however, is the probability of victory, which is derived from the betting market data. And things are actually looking really good for the German team, who are 74.5% likely to win according to the forecast. Scotland's probability is only nine percent.

The UTS is an amazing format and brings a fresh wave of excitement, modernity, and entertainment to the tennis court, breaking traditions and embracing a vibrant, faster-paced, and spectator-friendly format. But does the future of racket sports only lie in tennis? At TIO TIO Social Sports Felix Petersen and I believe ‚ÄúThe Future is Padel!‚Äù. Beyond the benefits enjoyed by active players, padel also offers a remarkable experience for spectators: The compact court paired with glas walls and its emphasis on double play make padel a sport with spectacular rallies and shots laden with a high tension and mental engagement. For this reason, prominent brands like CUPRA Deutschland, American Express, Renault, Volvo Cars or Carlsberg Group have already recognized the potential of what we at TIO TIO do not only call a sport but a lifestyle. In conclusion, the emergence of new formats such as the Ultimate Tennis Showdown (UTS) and the rise of padel exemplify the evolving landscape of racket sports. Both are forward-facing and demonstrate a keen sense of what modern audiences seek. _________ #padel #padeltennis #UTSTennis #tennisinnovation #tiotio #thefutureispadel\n\nSports biz: Americans snap up down-and-out Swiss #soccer team Maybe you saw investors behind the FC Los Angeles (LAFC) just bought Grasshoppers Club Zurich (GCZ), a #swiss pro soccer team. It's a super interesting deal that offers insights into why US groups are buying European #football teams, and how they hope to make money at it. #LAFC's Larry Freedman says his group, which already owns second-division Austrian club FC Wacker Innsbruck and has a partnership with German soccer giant FC Bayern M√ºnchen,wants to restore GCZ to former glory while building a player development and transfer network. For relatively modest sums -- actual amounts are undisclosed -- LAFC, the most valuable US pro football team, gets control of down-on-their-luck European teams with the potential to improve. It's a bit of a \"Moneyball\"-style approach: LAFC investors can use their European teams to develop promising young players who one day could command sizeable transfer fees, should they make it to the Bundesliga or Premier League. And while Swiss and Austrian leagues do represent the provinces of European football -- quality of play here isn't quite up to the levels of the UK, Germany, Italy or even France -- their top teams still get to play in the #ChampionsLeague. By buying teams like the Grasshoppers or Innsbruck, investors secure a reasonable shot at eventually vying for a very lucrative Champions League slot. That could pay off: Appearances against the world's best-known teams are rewarded with tens of millions of dollars. Back in 2018, for instance, the Young Boys Bern got something like $18 million for its @Champions League group-stage debut. It adds up. In this regard, the Grasshoppers in Zurich seem like a decent bet. Over the Swiss team's nearly 140-year history, it's won more national championships than any other club. GCZ were relegated to the country's second division after a disastrous season in 2019. While it rejoined the top Swiss division a couple of years ago, drama has continued as relations more or less soured with its previous owner, China-based Champion Union HK Holding Limited. The LAFC deal puts the club on more stable financial footing. One investor from the US group told the local #zurich newspaper, \"We want to win, and we're going to spend money so that we do win.\" And about the goofy ü§™ Grasshopper's name: Its origins are a bit unclear, but it might have something to do with the wild celebrations its players would throw on the pitch in the early days after scoring a goal. Sounds reasonable to me. At the 2023-2024 winter break, the Grasshoppers sit in 8th place. I'm sure the Americans are hoping the wild goal celebrations return as they look to make their bet pay off. But my favorite GCZ story is how it drove the Swiss author, Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt, who wrote the great crime novel \"The Pledge\", to suffer from writer's block. \"When the Grasshoppers from Zurich lose, I can't write for a week,\" D√ºrrenmatt once wrote.\n\nYesterday I wondered once more: \"Why am I a football fan and, of all teams, a member of VfL Bochum, a team that usually fights to avoid relegation?\" Maybe it goes back to when I was 8 years old, won second place in a drawing competition, and got to walk onto the pitch with captain Darius Wosz at a game against Bayern Munich in front of 45 thousand people... Yesterday, I experienced another unforgettable moment. After a 0-3 home loss to Fortuna D√ºsseldorf, the odds were against us. Everything was set up in D√ºsseldorf for a huge party, Campino, lead singer of die Toten Hosen and a huge D√ºsseldorf fan himself said prior to the game that \"it feels like Christmas and Easter on one day\". But Bochum did the impossible: equalizing in the second leg, going into extra time, and finally winning in a penalty shootout - one of the biggest comebacks in German professional football history. Our goalkeeper Andreas Luthe ended his career as a hero. Chatting with colleagues over lunch today, I realized just how excited I still was by what happened. The game really showed how important mental strength and coaching are. These qualities matter just as much in the business world. There is certainly many more important things in this world than football. And yet, a sport like this connects and provides joy to so many people in such a unique way. This passion and dedication are mirrored in our professional challenges. Mental fitness and coaching can turn seemingly impossible situations into successes. Here's to extraordinary comebacks and believers ü§ç üíô ..! photo credit: Reuters #coaching #mentalfitness #comeback #vflbochum VfL Bochum 1848 GmbH & Co. KGaA\n\nAs we kick off the 50th season of the 2. Bundesliga, there's a lot for the football business community to get excited about. Clubs like Hertha BSC (Olympiastadion, 74,649), Schalke 04 (Veltins Arena, 62,271), and Hamburger SV (Volksparkstadion, 57,000) regularly draw over 40,000 fans, which is pretty incredible for a second division. With nine former German champions like Fortuna D√ºsseldorf, 1. FC N√ºrnberg, 1. FC Kaiserslautern, 1. FC K√∂ln, and Hannover 96, the league is a thrilling mix of competitive spirit and rich traditions. What‚Äôs truly fascinating is that this level of brand presence and attendance is quite unusual for a second-tier league. The 2. Bundesliga‚Äôs average attendance last season was ahead of Spain‚Äôs La Liga, with figures around 29,189, reflecting Germany's unique fan-first football culture. The league‚Äôs affordable ticket prices and strong local club connections help maintain this extraordinary support. This lively atmosphere offers fantastic opportunities for brands to connect with loyal fans and gain significant exposure. The presence of these historic clubs guarantees not only exciting matches but also strong commercial potential. By partnering with these teams, brands can tap into their large, dedicated followings and long-standing heritage, boosting brand recognition and loyalty. With attendance numbers that can rival top-tier leagues, the 2. Bundesliga is a standout platform for creative marketing efforts. The blend of historic legacies, passionate fans, and substantial viewership makes this league an intriguing prospect for anyone in the football business. #2Bundesliga #FootballBusiness #Sponsorship #SportsMarketing #GermanFootball #BrandOpportunities #Bundesliga2 #HerthaBSC #Schalke04 #HamburgerSV #FortunaD√ºsseldorf #1FCN√ºrnberg #1FCKaiserslautern #1FCC√∂ln #Hannover96 #HistoricClubs #StrategicPartnerships #FootballMarketing #Attendance #FanEngagement\n\nHans-Joachim Watzke: The architect behind Borussia Dortmund's remarkable journey Discover how Hans-Joachim Watzke transformed Borussia Dortmund from the brink of bankruptcy to a footballing powerhouse, epitomizing resilience and strategic genius in the world of sports. 1: What were the pivotal moments under Watzke's leadership at Dortmund?
