It is located north of the Harz mountains at the farthest navigable point of the Oker river, which connects to the North Sea via the rivers Aller and Weser.\n\nHistory[]\n\nHistorical population Year Pop. ±% 1330 16,000 — 1550 16,000 +0.0% 1671 15,500 −3.1% 1758 22,500 +45.2% 1788 26,000 +15.6% 1811 27,600 +6.2% 1830 35,300 +27.9% 1849 39,000 +10.5% 1880 75,000 +92.3% 1890 100,000 +33.3% 1900 128,200 +28.2% 1925 146,900 +14.6% 1939 196,068 +33.5% 1950 223,767 +14.1% 1975 269,900 +20.6% 1989 253,794 −6.0% 2004 239,921 −5.5% 2010 248,867 +3.7%\n\nFoundation and early history[]\n\nThe date and circumstances of the town's foundation are unknown. Tradition maintains that Braunschweig was created through the merger of two settlements, one founded by Brun(o), a Saxon count who died in 880, on one side of the river Oker – the legend gives the year 861 for the foundation – and the other the settlement of a legendary Count Dankward, after whom Dankwarderode Castle (Dankward's clearing), which was reconstructed in the 19th century, is named.[6] The town's original name of Brunswik is a combination of the name Bruno and Low German wik, a place where merchants rested and stored their goods. The town's name therefore indicates an ideal resting-place, as it lay by a ford across the Oker River. Another explanation of the city's name is that it comes from Brand, or burning, indicating a place which developed after the landscape was cleared through burning.[7] The city was first mentioned in documents from the St. Magni Church from 1031, which give the city's name as Brunesguik.[6]\n\nMiddle Ages and early modern period[]\n\nUp to the 12th century Braunschweig was ruled by the Saxon noble family of the Brunonen, then, through marriage, it fell to the House of Welf. In 1142 Henry the Lion of the House of Welf became Duke of Saxony and made Braunschweig the capital of his state (which, from 1156 on, also included the Duchy of Bavaria). He turned Dankwarderode Castle, the residence of the counts of Braunschweig, into his own Pfalz and developed the city further to represent his authority. Under Henry's rule the Cathedral of St. Blasius was built and he also had the statue of a lion, his heraldic animal, erected in front of the castle. The lion subsequently became the city's landmark.\n\nHenry the Lion became so powerful that he dared to refuse military aid to the emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, which led to his condemnation and fall. However, his son Otto (IV), who could regain influence and was eventually crowned Holy Roman Emperor, continued to foster the city's development.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages Braunschweig was an important center of trade, one of the economic and political centers in Northern Europe and a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th century to the middle of the 17th century.[8] By the year 1600, Braunschweig was the seventh largest city in Germany.[9] Although formally one of the residences of the rulers of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, a constituent state of the Holy Roman Empire, Braunschweig was de facto ruled independently by a powerful class of patricians and the guilds throughout much of the Late Middle Ages and the Early modern period. Because of the growing power of Braunschweig's burghers, the Princes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who ruled over one of the subdivisions of Brunswick-Lüneburg, finally moved their Residenz out of the city and to the nearby town of Wolfenbüttel in 1432.[10] The Princes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel didn't regain control over the city until the late 17th century, when Rudolph Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, took the city by siege.[11]\n\nIn the 18th century Braunschweig was not only a political, but also a cultural centre. Influenced by the philosophy of the Enlightenment Dukes like Anthony Ulrich and Charles I became patrons of the arts and sciences. In 1745 Charles I founded the Collegium Carolinum, predecessor of the Braunschweig University of Technology, and in 1753 he moved the ducal residence back to Braunschweig. With this he attracted poets and thinkers such as Lessing, Leisewitz, and Jakob Mauvillon to his court and the city.[12] Emilia Galotti by Lessing and Goethe's Faust were performed for the first time in Braunschweig.[13]\n\n19th and early 20th century[]\n\nIn 1806 the city was captured by the French during the Napoleonic Wars and became part of the short-lived Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815 Braunschweig was made capital of the reestablished independent Duchy of Brunswick, later a constituent state of the German Empire from 1871. During the 19th century industrialisation caused a rapid growth of population in the city, eventually causing Braunschweig to be for the first time significantly enlarged beyond its medieval fortifications and the river Oker.[14]\n\nAt the end of World War I, on 8 November 1918, a socialist Workers' council forced Duke Ernest Augustus to abdicate his throne. On 10 November the council proclaimed the Socialist Republic of Brunswick under a one party government of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD). However, the subsequent elections on 22 December 1918 were won by the Social Democratic Party of Germany (MSPD), and USPD and MSPD formed a coalition government. In 1919 an uprising in Braunschweig, led by the communist Spartacus League, was defeated when Freikorps troops under Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker, by order of German Minister of Defence Gustav Noske, took over the city. Subsequently, a SPD-led government was established, and in December 1921 the new constitution of the Free State of Brunswick, now a parliamentary republic within the Weimar Republic, again with Braunschweig as its capital, was approved.[15]\n\nDuring World War II thousands of forced Eastern workers were brought to the city. During the years 1943–1945 at least 360 children taken away from the workers died in the Entbindungsheim für Ostarbeiterinnen.[16]\n\nDuring the war, Braunschweig was a Sub-area Headquarters (Untergebiet Hauptquartier) of Military District (Wehrkreis) XI. It was also the garrison city of the 31st Infanterie Division, which took part in the invasions of Poland, Belgium, France, and Russia, and was largely destroyed during the German withdrawal from Russia. The city was severely damaged by Anglo-American aerial attacks. The air raid on October 15, 1944 destroyed most of the Altstadt (old town), which had been the largest ensemble of half-timbered houses in Germany, as well as most of the churches. The cathedral, which had been converted to a national shrine (German: Nationale Weihestätte) by the Nazi government,[17] still stood.\n\nPostwar period to the 21st century[]\n\nAfter the war, Braunschweig ceased to be a capital when the Free State of Brunswick was dissolved by the Allied occupying authorities (most of its lands were incorporated in the newly formed state of Lower Saxony). The cathedral was restored to its function as a Protestant church. The rebuilding of the city was intended to make it modern and automobile-oriented. A small section of the Altstadt survived the bombing and remains quite distinctive. In the 1990s efforts increased to reconstruct historic buildings that had been destroyed in the air raid. Buildings such as the Alte Waage (originally built in 1534) now stand again in their pre-war glory.\n\nSubdivisions[]\n\nBraunschweig is made up of 19 boroughs (German: Stadtbezirke),[18] which themselves may consist of several quarters (German: Stadtteile)[19] each. The 19 boroughs, with their official numbers, are:\n\n112: Wabe-Schunter-Beberbach1\n\n113: Hondelage\n\n114: Volkmarode\n\n120: Östliches Ringgebiet\n\n131: Innenstadt\n\n132: Viewegs Garten-Bebelhof\n\n211: Stöckheim-Leiferde\n\n212: Heidberg-Melverode\n\n213: Südstadt-Rautheim-Mascherode\n\n221: Weststadt\n\n222: Timmerlah-Geitelde-Stiddien\n\n223: Broitzem\n\n224: Rüningen\n\n310: Westliches Ringgebiet\n\n321: Lehndorf-Watenbüttel\n\n322: Veltenhof-Rühme\n\n323: Wenden-Thune-Harxbüttel\n\n331: Nordstadt\n\n332: Schunteraue\n\n1Formed in 2011 out of the former boroughs of Wabe-Schunter and Bienrode-Waggum-Bevenrode.\n\nMain sights[]\n\nThe Burgplatz (Castle Square), comprising a group of buildings of great historical and cultural significance: the Cathedral (St Blasius, built at the end of the 12th century), the Burg Dankwarderode (a 19th-century reconstruction of the old castle of Henry the Lion), the Neo-Gothic Town Hall (built in 1893–1900), as well as some picturesque half-timbered houses, such as the Gildehaus (Guild House), today the seat of the Craftsman's Association. In the centre of the square stands a copy of the Burglöwe, a Romanesque statue of a Lion, cast in bronze in 1166. The original statue can be seen in the museum of Dankwarderode Castle. Today the lion has become the true symbol of Braunschweig.\n\nThe Altstadtmarkt (\"Old Town market\"), surrounded by the Old Town town hall (built between the 13th and the 15th centuries in Gothic style), and the Martinikirche (church of Saint Martin, from 1195), with important historical houses including the Gewandhaus (the former house of the drapers' guild, built sometime before 1268) and the Stechinelli-Haus (built in 1690) and a fountain from 1408.\n\nThe Kohlmarkt (\"coal market\"), a market with many historical houses and a fountain from 1869.\n\nThe Magniviertel (St Magnus' Quarter), a remainder of ancient Braunschweig, lined with cobblestoned streets, little shops and cafés, centred around the 13th-century Magnikirche (St Magnus' Church).

City roads are generally wide, built after World War II to support the anticipated use of the automobile. There are several car parks in the city.\n\nBicycle[]\n\nMany residents travel around town by bicycle using an extensive system of bicycle-only lanes. The main train station includes a bicycle parking area.\n\nTrain[]\n\nThe city is on the main rail line between Frankfurt and Berlin. Deutsche Bahn (German Railways) serves the city with local, inter-city and high-speed InterCityExpress (ICE) trains, with frequent stops at Braunschweig Central Station (German: Braunschweig Hauptbahnhof).\n\nTram and bus[]\n\nThe city has an inexpensive and extensive 35 km electric tram system. First opened in 1897, it has been modernized, including a 3.2 km extension in 2007.[24] The system has an 1100 mm gauge unique for a European railway or tram system. This is being supplemented in stages by a 1435 mm third rail, to allow future joint working with the main railway network.\n\nThe municipally owned Braunschweiger Verkehrs-AG currently operates five tram lines and several bus lines. The tram lines are:[25]\n\nLine from to M 1 Wenden Stöckheim Tram 2 Siegfriedviertel Heidberg M 3 Volkmarode Weststadt Weserstraße Tram 4 Radeklint Helmstedter Straße M 5 Hauptbahnhof Broitzem\n\nAir[]\n\nThe Braunschweig Airport (BWE / EDVE) is located north of the city at , elev. 295 ft (90 m)\n\nPolitics[]\n\nCity council[]\n\nThe council of the city is made up of the fractions of the different parties (54 seats) and the lord mayor, who is elected directly, with one seat.\n\nThe current lord mayor of Braunschweig is Gert Hoffmann (CDU).\n\nResults of the local elections on 11 September 2011:[26]\n\nParty Seats Votes (%) Votes CDU 21 38,2% 108.529 SPD 16 29,5% 83.965 Bündnis 90/Die Grünen 9 17,4% 49.357 Bürgerinitiative Braunschweig 3 4,8% 13.649 PIRATEN 2 3,9% 11.209 Die Linke 2 3,5% 10.044 FDP 1 2,1% 5.959\n\nVoter turnout: 49.4%.\n\nInternational relations[]\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany\n\nBraunschweig has 8 sister cities:[27]\n\nBandung, Indonesia (since 1960)\n\nNîmes, France (since 1962)\n\nBath, England, United Kingdom (since 1971)\n\nSousse, Tunisia (since 1980)\n\nQiryat Tivon, Israel (since 1985/1986)\n\nMagdeburg, Germany (since 1987)\n\nKazan, Russian Federation (since 1988)\n\nOmaha, Nebraska, United States (since 1992)\n\nName[]\n\nMany other geographical locations are named after Braunschweig such as New Brunswick in Canada due to the personal union of the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Electorate of Hanover) with Great Britain from 1714 to 1837 (see House of Hanover, also referred to as the House of Brunswick, Hanover line).[28] For a list of places named after Braunschweig see Brunswick (disambiguation).\n\nGovernment offices[]\n\nThe offices of the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA, \"Federal Aviation Office\") and the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation (BFU) are located in Braunschweig.[29]\n\nResearch and science[]\n\nBraunschweig has been an important industrial area. Today it is known for its University and research institutes, mainly the Johann Heinrich von Thuenen Institute, the Julius Kühn-Institut, and the Institute for Animal Food of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, until the end of 2007 all part of the Federal Agricultural Research Centre, the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The PTB Braunschweig maintains the atomic clock responsible for the DCF77 time signal and the official German time. The region of Braunschweig is the most R&D-intensive area in the whole European Economic Area investing 7.1% of its GDP for research & technology.[30] Braunschweig was named Germany's City of Science 2007 (German: Stadt der Wissenschaft 2007).[31]\n\nEducation[]\n\nAlso located in Braunschweig is the Martino-Katharineum, a secondary school founded in 1415.

During the 19th and early 20th century the canning and railroad industries and the sugar production were of great importance for Braunschweig's economy,[35] but eventually other branches such as the automotive industry became more important, while especially the canning industry began to vaish from the city after the end of World War II.[36] The defunct truck and bus manufacturer Büssing was headquartered in Braunschweig. Current factories in the city include Volkswagen, Siemens, Bombardier Transportation, and Bosch.\n\nThe fashion label NewYorker, the publishing house Westermann Verlag, Volkswagen Financial Services and Volkswagen Bank have their headquarters in the city.

Both companies were founded in the 19th century. Additionally Sandberg Guitars is based in Braunschweig.\n\nCulture[]\n\nBraunschweig is famous for Till Eulenspiegel, a medieval jester who played many practical jokes on its citizens. It also had many breweries, and still a very peculiar kind of beer is made called Mumme, first quoted in 1390, a malt-extract that was shipped all over the world. Two major breweries still produce in Braunschweig, the Hofbrauhaus Wolters, founded in 1627, and the former Feldschlößchen brewery, originally founded in 1871, now operated by Oettinger Beer.\n\nNear Braunschweig at Cremlingen-Abbenrode, there is a large medium wave transmitter, which transmits the program of Deutschlandfunk on 756 kHz, the Cremlingen transmitter.\n\nBraunschweiger Mettwurst is named after the city.\n\nFestivals[]\n\nSchoduvel, a medieval Northern German form of carnival was celebrated in Braunschweig as early as the 13th century.[39] Since 1979 an annual Rosenmontag parade is held in Braunschweig, the largest in Northern Germany, which is named Schoduvel in honour of the medieval custom.[40]\n\nAn annual Weihnachtsmarkt (christmas market) is held in late November and December on the Burgplatz in the centre of Braunschweig.

Despite playing the German 2nd division now (as of the 2012–2013 season), the club still attracts a large number of supporters. Braunschweig was also arguably the city in which the first ever game of football in Germany took place. The game had been brought to Germany by the local school teacher Konrad Koch, also the first to write down a German version of the rules of football,[nb 1] who organized the first match between pupils from his school Martino-Katharineum in 1874.[44]\n\nThe New Yorker Lions (formerly Braunschweig Lions) are the city's American football team, winning a record number of seven German Bowl titles, as well as two Eurobowls.\n\nThe city's professional basketball team, the Phantoms Braunschweig, plays in the Basketball Bundesliga, the highest level in Germany.\n\nOther sports in which Braunschweig has or had bundesliga or 2nd bundesliga teams include field hockey (Eintracht Braunschweig and Braunschweiger THC), ice hockey (Eintracht Braunschweig), volleyball (USC Braunschweig), field handball (Eintracht Braunschweig), team handball (MTV Braunschweig and SV Süd Braunschweig), rugby union (Welfen SC Braunschweig), water polo (Eintracht Braunschweig), and baseball (Spot up 89ers).\n\nAnnual sporting events held in Braunschweig include the international equestrian tournament Löwen Classics, Rund um den Elm, Germany's oldest road bicycle race,[45] and the professional tennis tournament Sparkassen Open.\n\nNotable people[]\n\nSee also: Category:People from Braunschweig\n\nNotable people associated with Braunschweig include:\n\nSee also[]\n\nMetropolitan region Hannover-Braunschweig-Göttingen-Wolfsburg\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nDefinitions from Wiktionary\n\nTextbooks from Wikibooks\n\nQuotations from Wikiquote\n\nSource texts from Wikisource\n\nImages and media from Commons\n\nNews stories from Wikinews\n\nLearning resources from Wikiversity\n\nOfficial website (English)\n\nBraunschweig – 360° Panoramas\n\nDaily newspaper Braunschweiger Zeitung\n\nBremen Hamburg Wolfsburg, Berlin Hanover, Osnabrück Magdeburg\n\nBraunschweig Paderborn, Bielefeld Göttingen, Kassel Halle"
