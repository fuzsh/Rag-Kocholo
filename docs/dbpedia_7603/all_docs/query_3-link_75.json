        "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted sports around the world, with leagues paused and schedules upended.\n\nBut it hasn’t stopped a host of former Michigan State players from finding ways to still suit up on the hardcourt.\n\nThe pandemic appears to have thinned out the ranks of former Michigan State players playing in overseas leagues compared to recent years, but at least eight former Spartans are still suiting up somewhere overseas.\n\nAnd the ranks of former Michigan State players in the NBA is growing, as two new members are set to join the league as rookies.\n\nThe ranks are likely to get larger, too, when the NBA G-League finalizes its rosters in the coming weeks.\n\nHere’s a look at where former Michigan State players are currently suiting up in professional basketball:\n\nMiles Bridges, Charlotte Hornets\n\nBridges is entering his third year in the league after a year in which he became a full-time starter and averaged 13 points and 5.6 rebounds per game. He’ll enter this year playing alongside LaMelo Ball, the No. 3 overall pick by the Hornets. Bridges is on the last year of his rookie contract unless the Hornets pick up a fourth-year option.\n\nBryn Forbes, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nAfter a four-year stint with the Spurs in which he went from a two-way player to the team’s starting point guard, Forbes signed a two-year free agent deal with the Milwaukee Bucks last month. Forbes has shot 40 percent from 3-point range in his four seasons and has been a double-digit scorer the last two seasons.\n\nDraymond Green, Golden State Warriors\n\nPlenty is different about the Warriors, who went from the NBA finals in 2019 to the worst record in the league in 2020 due to a series of departures and injuries. But Green is still there, getting ready for his ninth NBA season after turning 30 earlier this year. He averaged 8.0 points, 6.2 assists and 6.2 rebounds last year.\n\nGary Harris, Denver Nuggets\n\nHarris is back for season seven with the Nuggets, after he returned from an injury in the NBA bubble and helped them advance to the NBA’s Western Conference finals. His shots per game dipped a bit last year, as did his scoring, but Harris was praised by coach Mike Malone for his defense.\n\nJaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies\n\nJackson will start the season on the bench as he continues recovering from a torn meniscus suffered in the NBA bubble in July. When he’s gotten on the floor, though, Jackson has been a revelation: he averaged 17.4 points per game last year while shooting nearly 40 percent from 3-point range.\n\nXavier Tillman, Memphis Grizzlies\n\nTillman reunites with Jackson in the Grizzlies’ frontcourt after being selected by the team in the second round last month. He played in just one preseason game due to patellar tendonitis.\n\nDenzel Valentine, Chicago Bulls\n\nValentine will return to the Bulls for a fifth season after he signed a qualifying offer with the team earlier this month. He’s been limited in his opportunities with the Bulls – he played just 13.6 minutes per game last year -- but will now be playing for his third head coach in former Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan.\n\nCassius Winston, Washington Wizards\n\nWinston went to the Wizards in the second round, and had a high profile name join his team’s backcourt soon in Russell Westbrook soon after. Winston\n\nBen Carter, Hapoel Eilat, Israel\n\nCarter, born in Israel, has played his entire professional career in his home country since leaving East Lansing in 2018. He’s averaging 6.6 points and 5.5 rebounds as a starter in the country’s top league and was selected to the Israeli National Team earlier this year.\n\nMarvin Clark, Kangoeroes, Belgium\n\nClark left Michigan State after two seasons and finished his college career at St. John’s. He played his rookie professional season in Belgium last year, averaging 12.7 points and 4.7 rebounds per game, and resigned for a second season with Kangoeroes Basket Mechelen.\n\nMatt Costello, Gran Canaria, Spain\n\nCostello is back for his second season in Gran Canaria, where he plays in Spain’s Liga Endesa, considered among the best basketball leagues in the world outside of the NBA. Costello averaged 11.1 points and a team-high 7.6 rebounds last year.\n\nKenny Goins, Kolossos Rhodes, Greece\n\nGoins had a strong first professional season, averaging 11.5 points and shooting 54.5 percent from the field playing in Italy’s A2 league. He’s now moved from Sicily to another Mediterranean island, Rhodes, to play for Kolossos in Greece’s top league.\n\nKalin Lucas, Ironi Nahariya, Israel\n\nLucas was back in his home state playing for the Grand Rapids Drive last year, after briefly making it back to the NBA in 2020 with the Pistons. Now, he’s back in Israel for his second stint as a professional, where he’s averaging better than 20 points per game.\n\nRaymar Morgan, Pinar Karsiyaka, Turkey\n\nThis well-traveled former Spartan is back in Turkey, where he signed a two-year contract earlier this summer to return to the country where he played nearly a decade ago, in 2011-12. He’s played in five countries, most recently in Russia for two years.\n\nGavin Schilling, Lowen Braunschweig, Germany\n\nSchilling is back for his third year playing in the BBL in his native Germany. After two seasons with Ratiofarm Ulm, where he averaged 5.6 points and shot 60 percent from the field last year, Schilling is on to a new team in Lowen Braunschweig.\n\nNick Ward, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nWard spent time as a rookie playing both overseas and in the NBA G-League for the Hawks organization. He’s back overseas for the start of his second season, where he’s off to his typical high-scoring ways, averaging better than 20 points per game early in the season."
