        "text": "how much do pro basketball players make in Germany?\n\nOverseas basketball salaries in Germany can reach as high as $1 Million USD/per year if playing in the top league (Basketball Bundesliga).\n\nMore realistically though, a salary between $1,000 - $10,000 USD/per month is most common for overseas players playing in Germany’s pro circuit (BBL, Pro A, Pro B, Regionalliga 1-2).\n\nAccording to our overseas basketball salaries study that examined 100-plus pro leagues in the world, this would put Germany’s top league - the BBL - in the highest pay grade of overseas leagues.\n\nBut the lower divisions (Pro A, Pro B, Regionalliga 1/2) would fit into the mid to lower-tier.\n\nSo how exactly is the money distributed?\n\nLet’s break down each league fully.\n\nNow understand something:\n\nWithin this system, each league promotes and relegates a couple of teams on a yearly basis.\n\nThat means (usually) the top two teams advance to the next division while the bottom two go down a division.\n\nBut while every team is looking to do well and potentially advance, that doesn’t mean every team will pay to try and get there.\n\nFor the first four divisions you can typically expect the vast majority of players on each club to receive a salary (we’ll go into how much for each league in a sec).\n\nBut once you hit Regionalliga 2 (RL 2) it gets a bit murky.\n\nSome teams will pay in this league.\n\nOthers won’t.\n\nIt all depends on the ambition of the club:\n\nDo they want to advance (i.e. do they have the funding to support the next level)?\n\nAre they coming up from Oberliga with little budget/resources?\n\n…etc.\n\nThat means if you’re an overseas basketball player (i.e. foreigner to Germany) and you’re looking to get paid for playing basketball then your options are limited.\n\nSo let’s start with the best case scenario: the BBL.\n\nThe Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) - also known as easyCredit BBL - pays the highest basketball salaries in German professional basketball. Typically, a foreigner can expect between $100,000 - $300,000 USD/per year.\n\nBut salaries can go as low as $30,000 USD to a MAX of $1 Million USD/per year depending on the club.\n\nHow much do pro basketball players make in germany?\n\nWhen it comes to purely German players, the best German BBL hoopers (i.e. National Team members) can expect roughly $100,000 - $115,000 USD/per year according to insiders.\n\nTo no one’s surprise however, NBA Hall of Famer Dirk Nowitzki holds the title as the highest paid German-born player ever.\n\nHis career earnings in the NBA were $255 Million USD over a 21 years.\n\nGermany basketball bundesliga team budgets\n\nIn the Basketball Bundesliga each team is required to have a minimum budget of €3 Million (approx. $3.4 Million USD) to even register in the league.\n\nA handful of German teams are able to push the $10 million USD mark but the biggest budget currently belongs to Bayern Munich at roughly €20 - 23 Million Euros ($23 - 26 Million USD).\n\nThe second-largest team budget (on record) I could find was Alba Berlin - winner of 10 Basketball Bundesliga titles - with an €11 Million ($12.7 Million USD) budget in 2019.\n\nBrose Baskets Bamberg, Baskets Oldenbug and Baskets Bonn are some others that are speculated to be amongst the highest-paying (although I could not find actual reports on these. I will link them if I ever do).\n\nWhile multiple BBL clubs pushing $10 million USD budgets may seem like a huge deal, when you take a step back and analyze it - it’s really not.\n\nIt’s quite feasible.\n\nJust consider (a.) that $10 Million USD is not too far off from the minimum league entry ($3.4 Million USD) and (b). Germany has the fourth-largest GDP (economy) in the world.\n\nThere is money to be had in this country.\n\nThe only question is, will business owners and sponsors find value in spending it on basketball rather than soccer or handball (Europe’s most popular sports)?\n\nAnother important consideration:\n\nThese team budgets are reflective of the total team costs.\n\nThat means they aren’t just dedicated to player salaries.\n\nSo beyond player salaries - the following expenses have to also be accounted for:\n\nTransportation\n\nCars\n\nTaxes\n\nInsurance\n\nVenue\n\nUniforms\n\nLeague registration\n\nAll of these will eat away at the budget and reduce player salaries in the BBL - although they are still some of the best in the world.\n\nLuckily for imports, there are currently six spots allowed for them - making this a very accessible league.\n\nOther BBL considerations:\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, that same year the club signed its highest profile player in team history in nine-year NBA veteran Greg Monroe.\n\nAccording to reports, \"Moose” made $1 million USD after clearing performance-based incentives and bonuses.\n\nAlba Berlin forward Luke Sigma is amongst the highest-paid players currently in the BBL at an alleged €400,000 - €500,000 per year according to insiders.\n\nOverall, one should expect the highest salaries in the Basketball Bundesliga to typically be landing with Bayern just based on its operation budget alone.\n\nMuch like the other top European professional basketball leagues, there is a huge drop-off from the first level of German professional basketball to the next.\n\nWhen playing the Germany Pro A league, overseas basketball players can typically expect between €1,500 - €2,500 per month ($1,740 - $2,900 USD/per month).\n\nBased on player feedback, MAX salaries top out at roughly €7,000 - €9,000 per month ($8,130 - $10,500 USD).\n\nThe good news is the European season runs for 8-9 months straight.\n\nSo a MAX Pro A player could expect somewhere between €63,000 - €81,000 ($73,000 - $94,000 USD).\n\nThat’s a nice chunk of change.\n\nBut in the grand scheme of things, it ultimately falls below what even the average foreigner would make in the BBL.\n\nThe steep decline in salaries shouldn’t come as a complete surprise however.\n\nJust consider:\n\nIn Germany’s Pro A league each team is only required to have a €600,000 ($695,000 USD) budget in order to operate in the league.\n\nThat’s 5x less than what is obligated to operate in the division above, the Basketball Bundesliga.\n\nNaturally then, salaries will suffer.\n\nBut that doesn’t necessarily mean the game atmosphere does.\n\nThese matches can still get wild.\n\nSee it for yourself below.\n\nSo while salaries may be smaller in Pro A it is still a highly respected league.\n\nAnyone fortunate enough to get into this division has the potential to make some serious coin whether being promoted to the BBL or elsewhere in Europe.\n\nIt also offers an unlimited amount of import spots - although only two can be on the court at the same time.\n\nSo you’ll have to earn every minute in this league.\n\nGermany’s Pro B Basketball League (third division) requires each team to operate on a €300K team budget ($348K USD) to register in the league.\n\nBeyond that, player salaries typically end up in the €1k - €2k/per month ($1,600 - $2,300) range with MAX salaries going for €3k - €4K/per month ($3,400 - $4.600 USD).\n\nMany players also noted that living expenses such as rent, WIFI and transportation (car) were also covered.\n\nThe most common exception was food with multiple hoopers being responsible for covering their own meals.\n\nSo that would eat a bit into your take-home pay.\n\nWith 24 teams in Pro B, the league is split up into a North and South division.\n\nCome playoff time, the 1st of South plays against the 8th of North in a cross-over format.\n\nThen it’s the 2nd of South vs. 7th in North etc.\n\nThe top two teams of the playoffs are promoted to Pro A.\n\nMeanwhile the teams that finished between 9 - 12 in the regular season play in a play-down series with the bottom two teams in both divisions being relegated to Regionalliga.\n\nThe average salary in the Regionalliga will fall between $700 - $1,000 USD/per month but some teams in Regionalliga 1 who are vying for promotion to Pro B will pay their players as high as $3,000 USD/per month players say.\n\nThe Regionalliga is split into two levels:\n\nRegionalliga 1 (58 teams)\n\nRegionalliga 2 (130 teams)\n\nWith 180+ teams combined in the two divisions, the Regionalliga offers one of the best starter league options in the world for overseas basketball players.\n\nJust don’t expect to get rich.\n\nWhile RL1 teams are much more likely to be paying the majority of its players, that isn’t always the case in RL 2.\n\nRemember:\n\nMany of these RL2 clubs are just fresh out of the semi-professional ranks (Oberliga - 5th division - and lower).\n\nSo that means multiple teams simply won’t have the budget or sponsors in place yet to completely professionalize their clubs.\n\nFor instance:\n\nI spoke with one import on a lower-end RL2 team and he told me he was making €450.00/per month through a side job provided by the team (more on this in a sec).\n\nNo one else on the team was getting paid.\n\nBut then there is the other end of the spectrum.\n\nRL1 teams that are serious about advancing to Pro B will usually have the necessary budget in place already to do so.\n\nFor example:\n\nI have it on good authority that prior to SBB Baskets Wolmirstedt being promoted to Pro B a few seasons ago, they were already operating on a €400,000 budget in RL1.\n\nRemember:\n\nThe minimum operating cost for a Pro B team is €300,000 so that means SBB Baskets was already above the Pro B threshold while still playing in RL1.\n\nBut again:\n\nThis is very rare.\n\nCurrently only one other team in Landesliga has imports (two Americans) who are getting paid.\n\nOutside of that, these lower divisions will be made up of:\n\nUniversity players\n\nYounger guys (18-21) looking to move up the ranks\n\nOlder players out of their prime but still looking to play on a competitive team\n\nThink of it as more of a men’s league than anything else.\n\nPractices are sparse.\n\nIntensity isn’t the greatest.\n\nIt’s not professional in that sense.\n\nWith that being said:\n\nTeams will pay a foreigner if they are desperate enough to advance to the next division.\n\nBetter yet:\n\nAlongside paying for all the foreigner’s amenities (flight, housing, transportation, WIFI, washer/dryer etc.) - which they typically do, many teams will also try to hook you up with a side job to offset their lower salaries.\n\nSome examples may include:\n\nBasketball academy coaching (I did this)\n\nEnglish tutoring\n\nGraphic design/social media for the team\n\nFactory job (I was offered this but I declined)\n\n…etc.\n\nWith Germany having such a high-powered economy, often times teams will get creative in how to attract import players in these lower-end levels.\n\nThe greatest benefit of starting in a lower-level team in the European system?\n\nThe ability to advance to the next division alongside that club via Europe’s league promotion system.\n\nThen as the team climbs the divisions, so does your sponsorships, fanbase, player salaries etc.\n\nThis is a great way to ‘hack’ the system so to speak.\n\nEventually you could play in the league you always wanted to (e.g. BBL) after a few years of hard work.\n\nThen more eyeballs can be on you and more opportunities and competitions could arise.\n\nBut obviously this is harder said than done.\n\nYou must first win your division for this to work - no easy task!\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSo there you have it.\n\nThe most comprehensive guide on German professional basketball salaries on the internet.\n\nWhether looking at the German Basketball Bundesliga (BBL), Pro A, Pro B, Regionalliga or the lower divisions, you’re now set.\n\nAnd with a well-powered economy there are also creative ways to make some nice side cash for overseas basketball players playing in this basketball powerhouse."
