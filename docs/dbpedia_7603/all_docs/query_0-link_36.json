        "text": "The individual districts in Braunschweig offer living options for every taste and every budget: shared flats in old buildings in creative neighbourhoods such as the western ring area, your first own flat alone in apartment buildings with a garden or student living in a flat or room in the centrally located halls of residence. The central campus can be reached from all parts of the city in less than 25 minutes by bike.\n\nThere are many cult student pubs and cafés in the immediate vicinity of the campus. When it gets warm outside, Braunschweig's pubs put well over 10,000 chairs out on the nicest squares and streets. On hot days, beach bars right by the Oker or above the city's rooftops invite you to relax with friends.\n\nMore about living in Braunschweig:\n\nStudierendenwerk OstNiedersachsen\n\nHousing\n\nThe culture ticket included in the semester fee invites you to visit the State Theatre, LOT Theatre and Figurentheater Fadenschein free of charge. There are also special offers such as many open-air concerts, the \"Sommerlochfestival\", the \"Culture Night\" or \"Culture in the Park\". Concerts in the Volkswagen Hall, the Westand Culture and Event Centre Westand, but also newcomer performances and hip DJs in clubs in the Kultviertel: in Braunschweig you can clear your head and get going again.\n\nAnd if you are looking for something a bit different at the weekend: The German capital Berlin is only a 90-minute train ride away the Hanseatic city of Hamburg can even be reached with the semester ticket.\n\nThe river Oker, which springs in the Harz Mountains, surrounds the city centre with its historic canals. Alongside disused railway tracks, the approximately 20 km long and greened “Ringgleis” invites you to circle the city centre by bike. In the whole city area there are also around 20 parks, which are ideal for strolling, jogging or barbecuing.\n\nThe many sports clubs and fitness studios in Braunschweig also offer innumerable possibilities for sporting activities. Whether Aikido or American Football, crossfit or frisbee, rowing, bouldering or tennis: there's something for everyone. Naturally, the university sports facilities are particularly attractive for students and staff of our university. They are inexpensive and open to all members of the university.\n\nAnd since you can also watch sports very well without having to take action yourself, we gladly recommend a visit to Braunschweig’s elite sports clubs: Eintracht Braunschweig is a traditional German soccer team and plays in the 2nd Bundesliga, the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig brought forth NBA stars such as Dennis Schröder and Daniel Theis, and the American footballers of the New York Lions have been among Germany’s elite for years. By the way: Did you know that Braunschweig is the cradle of German soccer? In 1874, teacher Konrad Koch organized the first soccer match on a field located directly next to the TU Braunschweig campus. One year later he published the first version of the German soccer rules."
