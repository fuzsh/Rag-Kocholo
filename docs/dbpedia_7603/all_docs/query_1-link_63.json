        "text": "The first Michigan State product is locked in for The Basketball Tournament 2021. Gavin Schilling has been added to the roster of Kimchi Express, the tournament announced.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 forward spent the 2020-21 season with the Braunschweig Lions of the Basketball Bundesliga, Germany’s top professional league.\n\nTBT, now entering its eighth year, is a single-elimination tournament for a seven-figure cash prize, with teams primarily made up of recent college basketball standouts and international professionals. Many teams are built around a common trait, like alumni of the same college program or players who grew up in the same region. This year’s winner will split $1 million.\n\nThe 2021 iteration of TBT features four regionals: Wichita (July 16-20), West Virginia (July 17-21), Columbus (July 23-27) and Illinois (July 24-28). The tournament moves to Dayton, Ohio on July 31 for the quarterfinals through the championship, which is set for Aug. 3.\n\nKimchi Express will be participating in its fourth TBT and starting in the Wichita regional. The team was created “to spread Korean culture through sports,” per TBT’s website. Schilling joins a roster that includes guard Garlon Green, formerly of TCU, forward Jordan Loveridge (Utah), guard Marcus Graves (Sacramento State), guard Nijal Pearson (Texas State), guard Trey Davis (Massachusetts) and forward Will Davis (California-Irvine).\n\nBecome a Spartan TailgateVIP subscriber today and get 30% off your first year!Or start a monthly plan for just $1!CLICK HERE to get full access to the entire 247Sports Network and stay informed on all things Michigan State!\n\nFour former MSU players appeared in TBT 2020, which was held at one self-contained site in Columbus. Nick Ward and Javon Bess teamed up with Big X, and Branden Dawson and Brandon Wood played for Team Heartfelt.\n\nSchilling averaged almost 11 points and 7.5 rebounds in 22 minutes, 47 seconds per game with Braunschweig. He signed with the club from another German team, ratiopharm ulm.\n\nSchilling’s bio on Braunschweig’s website includes the following comments upon joining the team: “I already knew coach Pete before my time in Ulm and the good relationship with him is one of the main reasons why I chose Braunschweig. I am convinced that I can take the next step in my career with the Lions and at the same time help the team play a very successful season. I am already in contact with a few guys from the Löwen team and can already feel the family atmosphere. That’s not the only reason why I’m very happy to be in Braunschweig in the future and to get to know the beautiful city as well as the great fans.”\n\nSchilling appeared in 134 games during his five-year MSU career from 2013-18. He made 39 starts and averaged 3.3 points and 3 rebounds per game throughout his time in East Lansing."
