        "text": "Brunswick[dead link] (German: Braunschweig) is a city of around 250,500 people (2018) in the federal-state of Lower Saxony, Germany. It is north of the Harz mountains at the farthest navigable point of the Oker river, which connects to the North Sea via the rivers Aller and Weser.\n\nThe date and circumstances of the town's foundation are unknown. Tradition maintains that Braunschweig was created through the merger of two settlements, one founded by Bruno II, a Saxon count who died before 1017 on one side of the river Oker - the legend gives the year 861 for the foundation - and the other the settlement of a legendary Count Dankward, after whom Castle Dankwarderode (Dankward's clearing), which was reconstructed in the 19th century, is named. The town's original name of Brunswik is a combination of the name Bruno and Low German wik, a place where merchants rested and stored their goods. The town's name therefore indicates an ideal resting-place, as it lay by a ford across the Oker River. Another explanation of the city's name is that it comes from Brand, or burning, indicating a place which developed after the landscape was cleared through burning. The city was first mentioned in documents from the St. Magni Church from 1031, which give the city's name as Brunesguik.\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nBrunswick was a city of importance in medieval Germany. Economically, it was situated at the intersections of major trade routes; moreover, the river Oker was navigable from Brunswick, allowing access to the sea port of Bremen. It was among the last nine cities of the Hanseatic League.\n\nPolitically, Brunswick gained importance through one of its most important rulers, Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and Bavaria. During his reign, Henry founded several German cities (among them Schwerin and Munich), defying his cousin German Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, and married Richard the Lionheart's sister Matilda of England, thus establishing familial ties to the royal family of England, which still exist. His son, Otto of Brunswick, was crowned German emperor in 1209. To document his claim to power, Henry had the Lion monument erected in 1166, which also appears in the city's coat of arms. You can still find the red lion on the coat of arms of Scotland and the British Royal Family.\n\nBrunswick is considered having been one of the most tumultuous cities of Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe (next to Paris and Ghent). Numerous constitutional conflicts ended in uprisings and civil unrest.\n\nDespite its rich medieval tradition, Brunswick's appearance today owes much to its almost complete destruction during World War II. Allied bombing destroyed 90% of Brunswick's medieval city centre (leaving only 80 of over 800 timberframe houses). Only a small number of buildings have been re-erected; the majority of downtown buildings nowadays exhibit the sombreness of 1950s post-war architecture.\n\nAn important industrial hub, the district of Brunswick is home to many companies, such as the steel industry in Salzgitter (Salzgitter AG) and Peine, or Volkswagen in Wolfsburg.\n\nThe region of Braunschweig is the most R&D-intensive area in the whole European Economic Area investing a remarkable 7.1% of its GDP in the research & technology sector (places two and three go to Varsinais-Suomi and East Anglia with 4.1% each). It is home to the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), the national institute for natural and engineering sciences and the highest technical authority for metrology and physical safety engineering in Germany. Part of its assignments is the accurate measurement of time. It is responsible for the German atomic clock CS2 and the longwave time signal DCF77. In addition, the PTB operates time servers for the distribution of time on the internet.\n\nBrunswick is further known for its universities Technische Universität Carolo-Wilhelmina zu Braunschweig, Hochschule für Bildende Künste Braunschweig, Ostfalia Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften, Welfenakademie Braunschweig, and 19 research institutes, among them the Johann Heinrich von Thuenen Institute (the Federal Agricultural Research Centre until 2007), and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research.\n\nBraunschweig was declared Germany's City of Science in 2007.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nearest commercial airport is Hannover Airport (HAJ IATA) (approximately 30–40 minutes by car, or around 1 hour by train).\n\nBraunschweig Airport (BWE IATA) is mainly a research airport and is primarily used by the Technische Universität Braunschweig, the German Federal Agency of Aviation (Luftfahrt-Bundesamt), and the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation (Bundesstelle für Flugunfalluntersuchung). It is, however, served by Volkswagen Air Services, Volkswagen 's corporate airline, with a few destinations in Europe (Prague, Poznań, or Ingolstadt). Tickets can be booked through the airline, or directly at the airport.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its location in the centre of Germany, Braunschweig Hauptbahnhof is well-served by German national railway company Deutsche Bahn. There are lots of high-speed trains ICE that stop in Brunswick.\n\nPicturesque Goslar and the Harz Mountains, as well as the Luneburg Heath can be reached by local train. Travellers can purchase a Niedersachsen-Ticket, valid on local trains in the whole state of Niedersachsen for €21 for a single ticket, or €29 per ticket valid for up to 5 people. A Schönes-Wochenende-Ticket, which is valid for up to 5 people for all local routes of Deutsche Bahn in Germany on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).\n\nBrunswick main station is not very close to the centre, and the surrounding area does not offer a lot of sights worth seeing (Ringcenter commercial centre and the clubbing area behind it Stereowerk/Cube 11. Take the bus or tram from here to reach your final destination in Brunswick.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nBrunswick is served and easily reached by the German Autobahn highway system. Autobahns include one of Europe's main traffic artery the A2 (sometimes jokingly referred to as Europe's biggest parking lot since traffic jams are not uncommon, especially on Fridays). In addtition, the A39 cuts through Brunswick, connecting the city with adjacent Wolfsburg and Salzgitter, and merging into A7 to Kassel and Frankfurt. City autobahns are the A391, A392 and A395.\n\nDepending on the traffic, Berlin can be reached in two hours - Hamburg, Bremen and Kassel in one hour and a half, Frankfurt in 3½ hours, Hannover in 30–40 minutes, and Magdeburg in one hour using the autobahn. Goslar and the Harz mountains are approximately 30–40 minutes away by car.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nBrunswick serves as a major stop for bus travel throughout the country and Europe, thanks in large part to its central location. Buses frequent cities in Eastern Europe, especially Poland. Tour operator Rainbow Tours[dead link] offers low-cost (and often bumpy) trips to European metropolises.\n\nFor information on domestic bus routes see Long distance bus travel in Germany\n\nThe (Zentraler Omnibus-Bahnhof or ZOB) is on Berliner Platz between the main station and the German Mail building (next to the Steam Locomotive monument).\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city centre is easily explored on foot. Most places of interest can be reached walking. The downtown shopping district is a car-free pedestrian zone. In case you need to visit places further out, you can rely on the public transportation system.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nAll major car rental companies have branches in Brunswick. But since Brunswick's highways tends to get gridlocked during rush hours (neighbouring Peine is the county with the largest number of commuters in Germany, most of which commute into either Braunschweig or Hanover). Moreover, Brunswick is rumoured to have the highest per-capita-density of traffic lights in Germany. Try to count your number of stops when moving around by car in Braunschweig.\n\nBrunswick has many parking garages, which are organized through a pretty efficient parking guidance system. You can access information on spaces available, fees, and opening hours via your cell phone at wap.braunschweig.de\n\nBy public transportation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Braunschweiger Verkehrs-AG serve the city and the district of Braunschweig. Places within city limits are easily reached by public transportation, either bus or tram. Ticket prices vary depending where you need to go based on various zones [dead link] .\n\nPrices are available here[dead link] . Tickets can be purchased at the driver, at certain stores[dead link] , or via cell phone. The price for a one-way ticket within city limits is €2.50 (€2.30 by mobile, €1 less for children 6-14), or €5.50 for a day ticket (€5.30 by mobile) (Dec 2018).\n\nInformation on schedules and connections can be found either at the BSVAG[dead link] itself, or on the EFA site, where you can look up connections for all of Lower Saxony and Bremen.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxis are comparatively expensive in Germany, and Brunswick is no exception. They are usually used by locals on weekends (after buses and trains stop running) for a ride home, or if you need to move lots of luggage to, e.g. the train station. The concept of sharing a cab with strangers is foreign to locals and drivers alike, although some people can be persuaded to share a cab, if your stop is on the same way (and when cabs are sparse, e.g. in inclement weather).\n\nPublicly registered taxicabs - those with yellow signs on top which say Taxi and are usually taxi-colored (creamy eggshell color) - can be phoned (☏ or ☏ ) or hailed. Private companies, such as MiniCar or HighlineTaxi[dead link] , only pick you up with a prior reservation.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nHaving been one of the most important cities of medieval Germany has left its traces in the Brunswick cuisine, be it the Mumme (Brunswick Mum) (apparently the oldest man-made nonperishable food) or its rich selection of sausages and cakes. Take the opportunity to shop for Mumme specialities. A must-try are Eulen und Meerkatzen (owls and guenons - Ulen un Apen in Brunswick dialect), which, according to legend, were baked by Braunschweig trickster Till Eulenspiegel to play a prank on the people of Brunswick, and which are to this day sold by Braunschweig bakeries. Watch out for seasonal food; the asparagus grown in the Brunsick district is regarded as one of the best in the world, curly kale, served as Braunkohl, is a specialty of the Brunswick region, as well as the local chanterelles. A good opportunity to try Brunswick specialities is the Christmas market in December. Vendors have lots of local food to offer, and you can try and share various dishes without having to sit and order in a restaurant\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen you are in the city centre some good options for a fast meal are the pizza restaurant in the 'Burg Passage' and the Dutch French fries \"Imbiss\" near 'Karstadt'.\n\nTurkish-German dish doner kebab places can be found all over town (like in any major German city). Most renowned for its Doner are the Bohlweg (Beyti Grillhaus and Kebab Haus), Tandir near night club Merz, and the Dönerdreieck (Doner Triangle - Mesopatmien Grill, Güney Grill, Olive, and others) wedged in between the downtown shopping district and the red light district.\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]"
