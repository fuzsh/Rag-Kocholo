For example, you can stream on your iPhone, another on your laptop, and another on a Connected TV device like Roku at the same time.\n\nFloSports streams thousands of events every year. Occasionally, events are restricted to specific geographical regions based on contractual agreements with rights holders and we aren’t able to stream to all geographical locations.\n\nIf a stream or event replay is not available in your location, we will display an event \"is not available in your location\" message on the Event’s page or our Schedule pages. If you believe this is an error, check your VPN or proxy settings and try turning the setting to 'Off'.\n\nYes, you can cancel anytime. Your subscription will remain active through the remainder of the last billing cycle.\n\nVisit the Account Details > Subscription page to make a change to your subscription."
