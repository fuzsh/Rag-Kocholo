        "text": "As fall training camp continues, so do the preseason watch lists for college football’s top awards. Today, Kentucky wide receiver Ja’Mori Maclin found himself in early consideration for the Biletnikoff Award, given annually to the most outstanding receiver in the FBS.\n\nThe Tallahassee Quarterback Club Foundation, Inc. named Maclin one of the 49 student-athletes on the 2024 preseason watch list for the Biletnikoff Award. Only six others from the SEC join Maclin as Biletnikoff candidates to watch: Kelly Akharaiyi (Mississippi State), Nic Anderson (Oklahoma), Andrew Armstrong (Arkansas), Luther Burden III (Missouri), CJ Daniels (LSU), Tre Harris (Ole Miss), Robert Lewis (Auburn), and Squirrel White (Tennessee).\n\nAny player who catches a pass is eligible for the Biletnikoff, regardless of their position. The list also includes two tight ends, a running back, and, surprisingly, one cornerback. Colorado’s Travis Hunter is that corner for his two-way contributions in Boulder.\n\nPrior to Kentucky, Maclin spent two years on the sideline at Missouri, where Bush Hamdan was his position coach, and then two playing seasons at North Texas. He has 74 receptions for 1,389 yards and 13 touchdowns over the course of his career and was named AAC Second Team in 2023 for his 1,000-yard season, which included four 100-yard games and a school-record 17.6 yards per catch for the Mean Green."
