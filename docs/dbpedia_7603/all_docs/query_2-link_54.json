        "text": "By Eurohoops team/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nDennis Schroder is fulfilling his wish to help out Basketball Lowen Braunschweig, his hometown team.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who a signed four-year, $70-million contract with Atlanta Hawks in 2016, is joining the Lowen GmbH as the majority shareholder as Braunschweiger Zeitung reported. He is going to help deal with the increased share capital for the next season. Instead of the previous 100,000 euros, the Basketball Bundesliga demands from each of the 18 clubs in the future a deposit of 250,000 euros.\n\nLooks like Schroder is doing good on the plans for the German team that he spoke of earlier this month while visiting his hometown during the All-Star Game break:\n\n“We want to build a top-five team here in Germany. That’s my dream because I come from Braunschweig“, he said amongst other things."
