        "text": "-THE FANTASTIC Dortmund Youth Work continues as they annouce that\n\n03 RB Semic, 03 M Lutke-Frie, 04 W Bamba, 04 GK Kirsch, 04 CB Husseck's contracts will not be renewed. They overall axed or not renewing 13 players.\n\nBamba is nonesensical with 1st team he got 3 caps this season in 1BL but always bench with II. Has been said that even Terzic didn't really get it, LOL. Lutke-Frie is always injured and recently finally back but this club has 0 interest to integrate their own Academy and already piling up Ms for next season. Kirsch too many GKs and that Dortmund kept Lotka for WAY too long blocked everyone else. Husseck a lot of injuries issues but even then was never gonna get chances as they would have blocked him for older players. Semic, imagine Dortmund convinced him years ago to stay with them to block a 2BL HSV transfer only for them to screw him at every chance....\n\nNONE of the Academy youth even the foreign ones even stick around in II. II just playing guys who are more like 23 y/o too.\n\nand does one have to wonder why a 05 M Lubach wants to bail from club? LOL.\n\n-on topic of 06 CF Brunner with transfer of 07 CF Kegni to Dortmund U19 next season......I don't think he's needed anymore to play Dortmund U19 next season. Dortmund has now like 4-5 CFs for next season. Its been said that Kegni is Tullberg's dream player etc. Brunner has outgrown Youth shit and would just block dev of others. So yeah, we could see Brunner leave the Youth crap after the U19 Championship Final next week. Whether 1st team next, II next or bails perm who knows.\n\n-03 GK P.Schulze has interest from 3rd Liga Verl and others for next season.\n\nhttps://www.kicker.de/waldschmidt-cozza-und-co-es-muessen-loesungen-her-1026943/artikel\n\n-04 GK Koch moves to 2BL KSC, will be #3 and likely #1 for revived II team that will play next season.\n\nStuttgart fans still seem to think/prop up/salivate about\n\n05 GK Seimen, 05 M Ulrich, 05 M di Benedetto as players they see making the 1st team perm in future.\n\none also sees them propping 02 M Meyer.\n\nman now that's a player who YEARS ago was being prepped for 1st team in 1BL along with 02 AM Egloff and 03 CB Suver (poached By Croatia) but what happened=3/3 DESTROYED BY INJURIES. This is main reason why nobody has emerged at Stuttgart besides them being A-Holes about Academy is the older propsects all got wrecked by injuries.\n\nits been said that Meyer's comeback from injury and XI in last 5 matches made huge contribution for Stuttgart II to win RL Sudwest and get promoted.\n\nnow its about how he plays/devs in 3rd Liga next year, will likely determine his future.\n\nI recall Meyer looked good in every single 1st team friendly too. The potential is there.\n\nthe main question is gonna be whether Stuttgart will open 1st team door or block them. For example if Angelo Stiller bails in Summer 2025, if you block them with a transfer In, now that veers towards nonesensical BS. That would be the right time for someone to take his spot in 1st team.\n\nI mean less we forget that Hoeness is one who brought Stiller to 1BL Hoffenheim directly from where???..........Bayern II in 3rd Liga. So for Hoeness (also brought Stiller with him when he became Stuttgart coach) he shouldn't have problem with upping players from 3rd Liga.\n\nLOL troll poster getting mental breakdown due to the U19 loss. Like its a C-team playing a friendly and he's going on rant and blaming everything on Torsiello not being a big and physical CF, LOL what???\n\nwhen you lose that badly, it means NOTHING clicked, NOTHING worked. It has nothing to do with big/physical CF or not.\n\nreminds me when Bayern II were in 3rd Liga in their last season and Arp was playing everyone shat on him. LOL. When nothing works for the team, nothing the CF can do if the whole XI is not working and if your not getting much chances created. Yeah ******** you Arp, you should have dribbled past 6-7 players solo and scored. What a shitty and pathetic CF!!!!\n\nbut CFs always get all the blame for any Ls. If the behind the CF doesn't work, then the attack ain't gonna work.\n\nbut what does one expect from a deranged person. Also this was Torsiello's DFB debut too.\n\nPejcinovic was our CF during qualifiers and ended up U19 Euro Qualifiers TOP Scorer but it wasn't enough to qualify with the B/C team.\n\nmakes no difference if the issue is the coach and lineup constantly has like 2-3 max attackers and everyone else is Defensive player.\n\nlike Pejcinovic+Bischof did as much as possible but 2 players aren't enough to carry a team.\n\nWorns is one of the most incompetent most recent YNT coaches. Like he's really bad coach.\n\nI believe if we played A-team 05s we qualify and win U19 Euro.\n\nwith B/C Team we could have qualified if he wasn't so defensively obsessed and benching talented players for more Defensive players, LOL. Like its clear he was aiming on semi-bus parking+trying to grind out results instead of winning matches. Although the Croatia match unfortunate that we conceded 2 goalazos to a team that we should have beaten. So Worns's shitty tactics ALMOST worked, LMAO.\n\nI mean troll poster was shitting on Worns for not calling up Rolke of Hertha, I mean Rolke was busy scoring 3 goals in 2 games vs Dortmund U19 in Championship SF. How would Worns call him up???? Weiper just came back from long term injury and Pejcinovic was being rested along with other A-teamers. But yeah Weiper will breakthrough 1BL with Mainz. Shame that Wolfsburg sucks and still not sure how they lured Pejcinovic to their club......they can't even integrate a CF that dominates in Germany and International footy NT, carried Germany u19+Wolfsburg U19 singledhandly too.......a top talent CF......he's 100% bound to have TONS of 2BL level interest. I hope can go to a club like Furth or KSC, both clubs have shown that they play CF/forwards in XI all season and on loan like they did with Lemperle+Matanovic. But more Wolfsburg sleep on it the more the chances to go to those clubs will be gone......\n\nin fact from A-team only Baum fits this from entire squad called up. Nobody else would fit A-team, rest of squad is more C list, with very few B list players.\n\nbut if we take the XI\n\nHermann - Baum (K), Barthel, Atom, Münz, Wagner - Ndikom, Njike Nana, Grüger - Popp, Torsiello.\n\nBaum=breakingthrough 1BL Frankurt\n\nMunz+Wagner=moving to 2BL Furth\n\nNdikom=pro contract and debut at 2BL H96\n\nPopp=breakingthrough 2BL Furth\n\nTorsiello=breakingthrough next season 2BL Darmstadt\n\nas of now that is it\n\n-02 CF Scherhant wants to leave 2BL Hertha but Hertha wants to convince him to stay and hope that future coach will convince him to stay. If he does leave they will likely ask for decent amount of $$$.\n\nhttps://www.liga-zwei.de/hertha-bsc-derry-scherhant-will-weg-smail-prevljak-bleiben/\n\n-02 AM Egloff is linked with 1BL Promotion Playoff Candidate FD. I'm curious to see what happens if FD goes up to 1BL? What do they do with the 03 CF Schmidt (Summer Transfer), 03 W Rossmann (Summer Transfer), 04 M Bunk+05 RB Savic+05 M Suso from Academy.\n\nhttps://www.liga-zwei.de/fortuna-duesseldorf-lilian-egloff-als-moeglicher-tanaka-ersatz/\n\n-2BL KSC have rejected millions from Wolfsburg to poach 04 GK Weiss who they claim is best 04 GK in Germany. Also that they seem to have no interest in listening to offers for him. Interesting that they seem more potential in him than Backhaus.\n\nhttps://www.fussballtransfers.com/a8646318453605987289-wolfsburg-blitzt-beim-ksc-ab\n\n-bodes well for U21!!!\n\n-Scouting on 05 W Boakye.\n\n-on 05 AM/W Wanner\n\n-Bayern needs to get a ********ing life, they want 05 AM/W Krattenmacher and then loan him out to 2BL Ulm......how about letting him be and go pro without being a loan player? Not every player should be on loan and not every German youth needs to be tied to Bayern and their loan army.\n\nand yeah Adeyemi, Pejcinovic, Krattenmacher etc are all Bayern youth DUMPED out of the club too. This club is notorious for writting off players early too.\n\nSome Updates on 1BL Stuttgart\n\n-on 05 GK Seimen\n\nDennis Seimen, who is considered the future number 1 at VfB, was originally supposed to be loaned out. After Stuttgart U21's promotion to the third division, this plan is off the table for now.\n\nDennis Seimen has been in the Bundesliga squad for VfB seven times in the last two seasons, including in both relegation games last year and once in the DFB Cup. The 18-year-old was denied any missions. However, these are predicted for the goalkeeper talent and are undoubtedly promised by those responsible. Exactly when is unclear, especially since the Swabians do not want to take any risks with qualifying for the Champions League in view of the increased demands nationally and internationally.\n\nSeimen should be carefully introduced to the challenges. In the shadow of the experienced Alexander Nübel, who will be in Stuttgart on loan until at least 2025 and possibly until 2026 according to his contract. The question remains about the necessary match practice for the young professional. The native of Heilbronn, who played 23 games with the U21 in the regional league, should possibly get this abroad. With VfB II's promotion to the third division, the idea of a loan was put to rest.\n\n-on the plan for the II team in 3rd Liga, LOL kicker is 100% disengenous, the 8-1 L was because they were down 10 men, 6/8 goals conceded with 10 men.\n\nDespite their future membership in the third division, the Swabians want to continue to focus primarily on their in-house talent. Coach Markus Fiedler achieved the unplanned and certainly not expected coup of promotion in the first year of his term in office. “Before the season, none of us expected this,” explains Bundesliga coach Sebastian Hoeneß, who welcomes the higher bar for the talent. This offers “the chance that developments may happen a little faster and that experiences that are particularly valuable can be gained.”\n\nAt the same time, we are pleased to have a promising young coach in Fiedler at the club. The 38-year-old, who gained his first experience in the U-team of TSG Hoffenheim and was promoted to the U-21 via VfB's U-17 in the summer of 2023, represents courageous and attractive football. With 78 goals, the Swabians scored the most goals in the league. Pure attack that can sometimes backfire. Like on matchday 8, when they lost 8-1 at FC Homburg.\n\nNothing changed in the approach of continuing to rely on the offensive and, above all, on the talents from our own academy. And nothing should change in the future. Even with the risk of avoiding relegation. “First and foremost, the second team is about player development and secondarily about team goals that you want to achieve,” said Hoeneß.\n\nhttps://www.kicker.de/seimen-leihe-ist-erstmal-vom-tisch-1027168/artikel\n\n07 GK Herdes moves to 2BL EB from Dortmund U17. Damn Dortmund U17 is losing loads of talents. Guy was #1 as Dortmund U17 won U17 Championship.....\n\nLeon Herdes joins Eintracht Braunschweig\n\nGoalkeeper comes from Borussia Dortmund\n\nGoalkeeper Leon Herdes will join Eintracht Braunschweig from the coming 2024/2025 season. The 17-year-old goalkeeper is moving from Borussia Dortmund's U17 team to the Lions and has signed a contract until June 30, 2027. Herdes will be part of the extended professional squad and will initially get match practice in the U19 team.\n\nLeon Herdes (March 7, 2007) spent his entire youth career with Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund. As the regular goalkeeper (25 games, 15 of which without conceding a goal) for BVB's U17s, the keeper won the German championship this season and defeated Bayer Leverkusen with his team in the final.\n\n“Leon has a lot of potential in the goalkeeper position. We are very happy to have convinced him, a top talent, to join us. It is important that we find a good mix of training sessions with the professionals, match practice with the U19s and a responsible approach to his school obligations for his sporting and personal development. “We want to and will support Leon holistically and gradually integrate him into men’s football,” said Benjamin Kessel, delighted about his commitment.\n\nLeon Herdes adds: “We had very good discussions in Braunschweig. The long-term plan presented convinced me, my family and my advisor and we see a good development path in the transition to professional football. I’m looking forward to my time at Eintracht and to a new, exciting chapter in my young career.”\n\nits like Wanner if he was at almost any 1BL club he would have brokenthrough instead at Bayern they dump him on 2BL loan and because Bayern doesn't give a shit about 2BL, they want 1BL next.\n\nClubs like Stuttgart because of 0 integration and they haven't integrated anyone in AGES too, they tend to act like Bayern in mentality. NOoooooo the jump is tooo big, more like they pile up transfers and block their own youth. So then there is 0 room for such players. Its clear that if Ulrich wasn't at Stuttgart he very likely would have brokenthrough...............\n\nits funny that every top club in Germany wants Gruda but like majority of 1BL would NEVER have integrated him like Mainz did and statistically speaking Gruda looks like one of best Ws in 1BL and this is his 1st ever 1BL season. Shows how stupid German footy is. Nobody wants to do the integration work. And it also shows how soooooo many are just at the wrong clubs tbh.\n\nand same reason why every 1BL club fight each other for any successful 2BL young player because none want to do the work themselves but will fight when they see others do it for them.\n\nI'm not a fan of Ulrich loan because continues to show blocking of own youth. Continues to show how even top talents don't get integrated in 1BL (Pejcinovic at Wolfsburg and sooo many others also show this).\n\nbut at end of day, Stuttgart has SHIT youth integration. NO WAY they would have integrated both di Benedetto and Ulrich. di Benedetto after half a season injured (annoyingly after making his 1BL debut) is more likely one to stay next season. So if we get a scenerio where\n\n-Ulrich goes on 2BL-1st Abroad loan and plays XI all season\n\n-di Benedetto plays 3rd Liga XI+1st team chances.\n\ncome 2025-2026 BOTH could be part of 1st team but if both stay, 10000000000000000% sure that would 1 be screwed over if not both......... 1BL clubs have also shown that most CANNOT integrate too many players in same position. 1 MAX is best you can hope for when it comes to direct jump.\n\nalso if Ulrich goes on loan he's not gonna take game time from the Meyer, Laupheimer, Munst etc.\n\nreports mention that 05 M Gruger might get pro contract until 2028 at 2BL S04. Would be 3rd 05 with pro contract after 05 GK Podlech+05 LB Becker and so far 2 06 pro contracts with 06 RB Bulut+06 M Ouedraogo.\n\nI guess that a player like 05 CB Barthel will likely have to impress in II to get chances. He's only relevant 05 left.\n\nif Gruger gets pro contract, for 05 Ms looking like (I'm ignoring caps)\n\n-Ulrich+di Benedetto=pro contract at 1BL Stuttgart\n\n-Bischof=pro contract at 1BL Hoffenheim\n\n-Raebiger=pro contract at 1BL Frankfurt\n\n-Aseko=pro contract at 1BL Bayern\n\n-Schulz=pro contract at 1BL Mainz\n\n-Amoako=pro contract at 1BL Wolfsburg\n\n-Kojic=pro contract at 2BL Paderborn\n\n-Neto=pro contract at RB Salzburg\n\n-Suso=pro contract at 2BL FD.....on track to become 1BL FD\n\n-Klemens=pro contract at 2BL Hertha.........used to be a CB. Since he's fixed XI, he's already attracted 1BL interest. One would expect Summer 2025 with 2 seasons in 2BL XI under his belt will end up in 1BL.\n\n-Marino=pro contract at 1BL Freiburg? Was XI all season in 3rd Liga II and with them going down, one would assume he either breakthrough 1st team or ends up on loan next season. RL would be downgrade and won't help him improve. And yeah he's a 1st team prospect too.\n\n-Lubach=looks to be leaving Dortmund and likely to end up somewhere where I assume he'll get pro contract. He's helping himself by playing role in Dortmund U19 Championship final where there is going to be more attention towards aka scouting/other clubs watching.\n\n-Gruger=pro contract at 2BL S04????\n\nI mean LOL, already 14 names mentioned and plenty more to add. And of course X amount from this list is likely to end up on 2BL-1st Abroad loans. But who cares their U21 cycle starts in Summer 2025-onwards. Still enough time to breakthrough 1BL.\n\nmentioned this before but 04-05 Ms are gonna be STACKED FOR M Options. And one has to take into account also 3 06s M in Ouedraogo (likely 1BL in Summer 2025), Watjen (1BL), Harchaoui (good chance might breakthrough 2BL Koln next season. Once he does who knows if Summer 2025 to 1BL is too early or not) can't be ignored either.\n\nLOL, can every big club just ******** off. These stupid big clubs all need to chill and wait for players to become #1 in 1BL or equivalent level. Stop being interested in players from 2BL-1st Abroad level. No point in going to big club who would make you play in their II team or loan you out. Its pointless. But we all know that the logic is more about getting X or Y now while still cheap.....\n\naccording to reports, 04 GK Backhaus who was #1 on Eredivisie loan has attracted interest from Barcelona.\n\nbut does show that the next gen young German GKs are attracting loads of interest.\n\nplayers like Ramaj (no longer youth), Atubolu, Urbig, Ernst, Backhaus, Weiss, Seimen are players who have TONS of domestic and International interest. But its a bad move for every single one of them even Atubolu, he only played his 1st 1BL season, needs few more years before he should even consider leaving.\n\neven domestically there are sooooooo many more very promising GKs that most of the International clubs aren't even aware of but will be, once they emerge as #1s in future. International clubs are aware of Heide+Schmitt for impressing a LOT in U17 Euro+U17 WC and aware of Babatz+Schlieck for impressing in UEFA YL when it comes of topic of 06 GK Age Group for example. Plenty more to come too.\n\nWAIT is this true???\n\nSky Info: FC Barcelona is interested in a German goalkeeper: Mio Backhaus (20/ ) was scouted locally by the Catalans several times this season.\n\nThe goalkeeping talent from Werder Bremen attracted attention with outstanding performances at FC Volendam during his loan in the Eredivisie and was named the best goalkeeper of the season despite relegation.\n\nAccording to Sky information, other clubs besides Barça have the 1.94m tall keeper on their list and have made specific inquiries.\n\nIn the summer, he's going back to Bremen - battle for the number 1 spot in the Werder goal or maybe a change?\n\nI wasn't aware that he was named best GK of Eredivisie this season. Interesting to see.\n\nUrbig+Ernst also seen as some of best GKs in 2BL especially Urbig who most saw him as best GK of 2BL this season.\n\nand Atubolu had some up and downs which is normal for a young GK who is working his way towards stability and ended up as one of the GKs with most clean sheets in 1BL too. Played a great M34 too. Atubolu also got to play EL and got some European footy experience as well.\n\nso yeah 4/4 of the young GKs German U21 GKs who are #1s in Relevant pros all did well this season. Like I keep saying wave of next Gen German GKs is 100% a thing and only begining as MORE will emerge besides these 4.\n\nalso what's interesting about these 4 is 4/4 are expected along with Seimen on becoming 1BL #1s soooooooooooooooooon. Like by Summer 2025 or 2026 we could see 5/5 being #1s in 1BL level.\n\nas for Backhaus frick Barca, should go back to Bremen, he's better GK then Zetterer."
