        "text": "Thanks to the large number of students in the city, Braunschweig has a lively and colourful nightlife: You will find all sorts of clubs, ranging from mainstream to alternative to electro, from pubs to jazz clubs. If you're looking for recommendations for going out, the Erasmus Student Network is a good place to find one. And if you are looking for something a bit different at the weekend: The German capital Berlin is only a 90-minute train ride away.\n\nThe river Oker, which springs in the Harz Mountains and flows into the Aller about 40 km northwest of Braunschweig, surrounds the city centre with its historic canals. Alongside disused railway tracks, the approximately 19 km long and greened “Ringgleis” invites you to circle the city centre by bike. In the whole city area there are also around 20 parks, which are ideal for strolling, jogging or barbecuing.\n\nThe many sports clubs and fitness studios in Braunschweig also offer innumerable possibilities for sporting activities. Whether Aikido or American Football, crossfit or frisbee, rowing or tennis: there' s something for everyone. Naturally, the university sports facilities are particularly attractive for students and staff of our university. They are inexpensive and open to all members of the university.\n\nAnd since you can also watch sports very well without having to take action yourself, we gladly recommend a visit to Braunschweig’s elite sports clubs: Eintracht Braunschweig is a traditional German soccer team and plays in the 2nd Bundesliga, the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig brought forth NBA stars such as Dennis Schröder and Daniel Theis, and the American footballers of the New York Lions have been among Germany’s elite for years. By the way: Did you know that Braunschweig is the cradle of German soccer? In 1874, teacher Konrad Koch organized the first soccer match on a field that is now part of the TU Braunschweig campus. One year later he published the first version of the German soccer rules."
