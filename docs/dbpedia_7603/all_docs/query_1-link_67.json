But what did it mean in terms of catching the eye of the NBA? A big zero.\n\n“I had no reason to be looking at the draft. They only had two rounds (60 players),” said an honest Doornekamp, who did have his sights set on playing pro ball since the day he entered Carleton in 2004.\n\nOttawa’s Kim Pierre-Louis totally understands Doornekamp’s thinking. After graduating as an athlete scholarship student from the University of Massachusetts, she was bypassed in the WNBA draft, but also dreamed of playing professionally.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nInstead of having NBA or WNBA initials after their names, Doornekamp and Pierre-Louis have found hoop happiness playing the pro game in Europe. And they have plenty of company from Ottawa, enough to fill two quality teams.\n\nThere are as many as 23 male and female players from or with connections to Ottawa playing for professional teams in the United States, Russia, Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria, Slovakia, The Netherlands, Hungary, Brazil and Canada.\n\n“Our (national senior and youth) programs are ranked fifth in the world and that means we’re producing good quality players,” said Andy Sparks, the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees women’s head coach. “They’ve come from universities where they’re grounded kids overall and relatively mature … and no problems when they go over.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOne moment they’re shooting the lights out at the Ravens’ Nest, Montpetit Hall or another university gym and the next moment they’re gone. But where did they go? Are they still playing ball? Some players will pop up on the media alert radar playing for a Canadian team at an international tournament, but what club team is paying for their talents?\n\nWhen Doornekamp, 33, left Carleton in 2009, he hired an agent, but all was quiet. But Doornekamp changed that during a national team tour in Italy. He made an impression and signed with Pasta Reggia JuveCaserta for one year and then two more years.\n\nWhat Doornekamp had going for him was what he learned during his five years with Carleton head coach Dave Smart, who has emerged as an elite national- and international-level coach.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I was lucky to be at Carleton. We played and developed the right way. Under Dave, you learned how to pass and that’s such an under-rated skill. But that translates well in Europe,” he added.\n\n“I did shoot well at Carleton but there’s a big difference shooting at university and playing pro. The (pro) game’s a lot faster. Every year you’re adjusting. The biggest thing for me is shooting greater than 40% for three-point shots. The last five years I’ve stayed above that mark.”\n\nPierre-Louis, 25, had two first-year pro offers for 2015-16 and elected to play for Sepsi Sic in Romania, where she started all 27 games and averaged 10 points, 5.4 rebounds and 14.5 minutes a game. She helped Sepsi Sic win the Romanian league’s regular season and playoff titles (before sold-out home crowds) as well as the Romanian Cup.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“It was a great experience. Everyday practice was a dogfight, insane,” she said in an interview. “They were high-level players. It was a total learning experience.”\n\nIn Doornekamp’s first year as a pro, JuveCaserta unexpectedly overachieved in 2009-10. But the next two years were great disappointments and Doornekamp had to go to court to get his salary from the disgruntled owner.\n\nAn injury kept Doornekamp off the court in 2012-13. After playing the next year in Germany for Basketball Lowen Braunschweig, he spent the next two years with Fraport Skyliners, which won FIBA’s third-tier Europa Cup in 2015-16.\n\nFor 2016-17, he headed to Spain’s top league, where he averaged 11.5 points and 4.3 rebounds in 25.9 minutes a game for Iberostar Tenerife, which captured the Champions League season. Doornekamp also was named to the league’s Star Lineup Best Team.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDoornekamp then signed a two-year contract with Valencia Basket last season, where he started 37 of 68 games, and averaged 21 minutes, 6.2 points, and 3.4 rebounds a game.\n\nWhile he found his entry into the pro experience “a bit of an eye-opener,” Doornekamp has enjoyed it overall, receiving some guidance from his older brother Nate, who played three years in Germany.\n\nPlaying for Valencia, which is owned by Spanish supermarket chain (Mercadona) billionaire Juan Roig Alfonsa, he has a six-figure, tax-free salary, a vehicle and free accommodation.\n\n“I essentially pay for food,” said Doornekamp, who is married with two children and can ride his bike or walk to practice.\n\n“Where we are now, I like it. I’d like to stay in Valencia as long as they let me. It’s a great club, an unbelievable city and being here has definitely outdone my expectations.”\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPierre-Louis would second that statement.\n\nAt the end of her opening season in Romania, Pierre-Louis received an offer to become “the” player for TH Wohnbau Angels Nordiingen of Donau-Ries in Germany’s top league. It was too hard to resist.\n\n“I had an opportunity for more playing time and money,” said Pierre-Louis, who was the All-German division one centre of the year last season, and a multiple all-star for the past two seasons.\n\nPierre-Louis took another step up the ladder for 2018-19, signing with and starting for defending division one German champion Gruener Stern Keltern.\n\n“It’s very exciting to play for this team. We’ll be playing against (elite) EuroCup players . . . who I have watched for so long,” said Pierre-Louis, who earns about $40,000 a year with all expenses paid plus a car and accommodation.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“It’s very stimulating year after year. I get to travel and play a game I love. It’s cool. I wouldn’t want to be at a desk for seven hours a day.
