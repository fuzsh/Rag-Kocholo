        "text": "Munich. At every home game for FC Bayern Munich Basketball, there is always one winner who is not out there on the court: since the start of the season, the “Dunks for Tomorrow” initiative from BMW München and the basketball team has donated 1,000 Euro to SOS-Kinderdorf e.V. for each dunk made by the home team at the BMW Park.\n\nTwo more dunks were added to the total during the Bundesliga encounter against Löwen Braunschweig on Sunday (91:61), celebrated by around 60 children and young adults from the SOS Children’s Villages in Ammersee-Lech, Augsburg and Weilheim, who had been invited to enjoy a thrilling afternoon at the BMW Park by the BMW Group. FCBB partner Sixt, who provided the buses, made the journey to and from the event possible.\n\nThey had to wait until late in the fourth quarter before Niklas Wimberg and Isaac Bonga sank two dunks to deliver a perfect conclusion to the SOS Children’s Villages outing that had provided such pleasure for all the children and young adults – true to the motto of the partnership between BMW München and FC Bayern Munich Basketball: „We Power Joy. Together“."
