        "text": "By Johnny Askounis/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nSeeking reinforcements in the wake of two players limited to the injury list, SIG Strasbourg added plenty of Basketball Champions League experience in the form of Martin Peterka.\n\nPeterka, 28, inked a contract for the remainder of the season with Strasbourg, the team announced Monday.\n\nThe Pardubice-born forward is a veteran of 46 games played in the Champions League stemming from his long spell at CEZ/ERA Nymburk. He previously played in the 2015-16 edition of the FIBA Europe Cup with the lasting champions of the Czech Republic’s NBL and in the 2011-12 edition of FIBA EuroChallenge with his hometown BK Pardubice.\n\nRepresenting Czechia at the international level, the experienced sharpshooter has appeared in 60 games with the senior national team, including the 2020 FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Victoria, the 2019 World Cup, and the 2017 and 2022 editions of EuroBasket.\n\nMartin Peterka moved from Turkey as an injury relief\n\nThe French outfit located in the east of the country near the border with Germany will be his third team this season. Staying in Germany’s easyCredit BBL following the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons focused on Basketball Lowen Braunschweig, switched to Wurzburg Baskets and moved on to Yukatel Merkezefendi in Turkey’s BSL. Following an agreement with the team based in Denizli, Strasbourg completed the transfer.\n\nLast week at Rhenus Sport, the team coached by Luca Banchi edged out Hapoel Atsmon Holon in overtime to go up to 1-0 in Group I of the BCL Round of 16. Both Matt Mitchell and Leo Cavaliere were sidelined with injuries and are expected to remain out for several more weeks.\n\nPhoto Credit: Basketball Champions League"
