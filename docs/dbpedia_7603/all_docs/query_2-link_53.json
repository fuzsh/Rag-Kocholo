BUT.. I am definitely proud that we never gave up. I never stopped believing in this great group of guys & in ourselves. I was always sure that in the end we will all together find the way like we always do.. & this is what happened! In hard times we got each other's back & our guys showed big character putting the Team over themselves. Last but not least, being 4 years in Basketball L√∂wen Braunschweig GmbH , I am in place to say that the support from our fans this year was absolutely unbelievable & they must know that they were a huge part of making it in the end. With this support the club has nothing to fear & the future is bright! #mentality & #character is everything üôåüèª F√ºr mich und meine Familie, Braunschweig ist unser zweites Haus! üôèüèª Vielen Dank f√ºr eure Unterst√ºtzung! #thankgod #blessed"
