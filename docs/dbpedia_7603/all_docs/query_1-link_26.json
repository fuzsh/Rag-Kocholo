        "text": "Do you feel confident about Reed Sheppard or Rob Dillingham earning NBA Rookie of the Year honors? You can now back up that optimism financially with varying levels of value.\n\nAnd the odds might surprise you considering the other top contenders in the running for the prestigious award.\n\nWith the NBA Summer League tipping off across the country, starting in California (July 6-10) and Salt Lake City (July 8-10) and followed by Las Vegas (July 12-22), Sheppard has opened with the fifth-best odds to take home ROTY while Dillingham owns the ninth-best odds.\n\nAlex Sarr of the Washington Wizards sits atop the list at +650, followed by Zach Edey of the Memphis Grizzlies at +700, Zaccharie Risacher of the Atlanta Hawks at +750, Dalton Knecht of the Los Angeles Lakers at +850 and Sheppard of the Houston Rockets at +1000 to round out the top five.\n\nMatas Buzelis of the Chicago Bulls joins Sheppard at +1000, as does Stephon Castle of the San Antonio Spurs while Ron Holland of the Detroit Pistons and Dillingham of the Minnesota Timberwolves come in at +1500. Donovan Clingan of the Portland Trail Blazers rounds out the top 10 with +2000 odds.\n\nTake a look at the complete Rookie of the Year outlook below, courtesy of FanDuel:\n\nAnticipated role plays a massive part in rookie projections, worse teams needing first-year players to make an immediate impact — hence Sarr leading the way as the early favorite. The Washington Wizards won 15 games in 2023-24 and will lean on the younger brother of former Kentucky forward Olivier Sarr early and often.\n\nThe Rockets (41 wins) and Timberwolves (56 wins), meanwhile, are coming off solid campaigns from a year ago with elite young cores, the former led by Alperen Sengun and Jalen Green and the latter headlined by Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns coming off a run to the Western Conference Finals. They’re positioned extremely well for the future and aren’t necessarily relying on the former Kentucky stars to lead them to glory. They’ll certainly help — both franchises have made it clear they’ll play key roles as rookies — but they won’t be thrown in with the sharks in sink-or-swim situations.\n\nThat may be the public perception for oddsmakers, at least. The Lakers didn’t make a high-profile move this offseason and will need Knecht to make shots, the Grizzlies needed size next to Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. and Edey does nothing but produce as a walking double-double, the Bulls will need wing production after losing DeMar DeRozan and Buzelis is a high-ceiling pickup — just go down the list.\n\nIf you want my personal take, though, Dillingham at +1500 is pretty, pretty intriguing. The Timberwolves lost both Monte Morris and Kyle Anderson this offseason while Jordan McLaughlin remains a free agent, leaving the former Wildcat as the lone point guard option behind 36-year-old Mike Conley.\n\n“I don’t think you make a move as aggressive as this and sit on him,” Minnesota President Tim Connelly said upon trading valuable future assets to land Dillingham on draft night.\n\nHe’s going to produce early on a team that will be in the national spotlight all season long. Getting him with the ninth-best odds in the Rookie of the Year race is solid value."
