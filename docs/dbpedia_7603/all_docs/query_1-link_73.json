        "text": "Wöhlking: What does the surname Wöhlking mean?\n\nThe last name Wöhlking is German in origin. It is derived from the German term \"wöhlken,\" meaning \"to call, to proclaim, to cry out.\" This term is thought to be derived from an ancient Germanic root word, possibly connected with the Old High German word \"wioli\" which means \"king.\" As such, Wöhlking could be interpreted to mean \"royal proclamation\" or \"king's cry.\"\n\nIn English-speaking countries, Wöhlking has been anglicized and can be seen in various forms, such as Wohlfking, Wohlfeld, Wohlfing, and Wolffking. Other variants can be encountered in Germany too, such as Wohlfeldt, Wohlfarts, Wohlfingest, or Wohlsing, all derivatives of the original German Wöhlking.\n\nThe Wöhlking name may have its origins in the region of Teutonic Prussia, where a group of German settlers from Swabia, Mecklenburg and Pomerania sought refuge in the 12th century. This group of settlers formed part of the Rustemers, a group of colonizers who moved into eastern Europe during this period to escape war or persecution. The Wöhlking surname is thought to have emerged from this group of settlers, and is often associated with nobility in Germany.\n\nThe Wöhlking surname is believed to have had such royal connotations due to the prominent role of the Rustemers in the formation of Prussia. As such, it is associated with leadership, strength and success. This reputation would have been passed from generation to generation, the Wöhlking lifestyle and name were therefore cemented in German culture as a mark of power and strength.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nWöhlking: Where does the name Wöhlking come from?\n\nThe last name Wöhlking is primarily found in Germany, primarily in the northern and central regions of the country.
