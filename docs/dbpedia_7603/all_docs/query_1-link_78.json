It is speculated that it was the name of an individual with a weaving related job. It is a common surname in southern Germany and among the German diaspora.\n\nThe surname is also found in East Prussia, Poland, and the Netherlands, which suggests the potential of an early medieval migration from the region. During the 19th century, immigrant surnames in the United States from this region include Wiggemann.\n\nThe German surname could also be derived from a nickname for someone who was considered \"swaying,\" meaning not committed one way or another, was easily influenced, or simply that their family came from an area that had a swinging gate.

Today, it remains most heavily concentrated in northern Germany, especially Hamburg and Lower Saxony.\n\nIt is believed that the surname is derived from the Old German word Wigin which is a diminutive form of a name ending in -wig. This suggests that it was originally a name bestowed as an endearing nickname, most likely to someone small or young.\n\nSince Germany is a major destination for immigrants from around the world, Wiggemann can also be encountered outside of its native country in countries like Austria, Switzerland, Canada, and the United States.\n\nIn the 21st century, the presence of the Wiggemann surname in Germany remains strong. Over 17,000 people bear the Wiggemann surname there and it is ranked the 812th most common surname in the country.
