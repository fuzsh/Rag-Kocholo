        "text": "Players from United Soccer League (USL) in Germany! Over the years I transferred many dozen of players from Major League Soccer, United Soccer League (USL) or Canadian Premier League to Germany. In DFB we have the three federal pro leagues: Bundesliga 1, 2 and 3. Liga (~56 teams) and five leagues in 4th tier/division Regionalliga S√ºdwest, West, Nord, North-East and Bavaria (~90 teams). Within all of those levels from Bundesliga down to Regionalliga (most U23/21 teams of the top teams play there) I signed and/or transferred many North American players. If a player or club approaches me about a move to Germany we do our research about the player and then (like it or not üòâ) tell them our honest opinion. Important for a successful career or transfer is to find the right environment for the player. With environment I mean the level, the setup of the club, the team, the technical staff, our experience with the interested clubs, the mind set of the player, his goals, the goals of the club, the chances/opportunities, etc. etc.etc‚Ä¶ A lot of people in pro soccer not really knowing the German pro market react to our assessments with something like this: ‚Äû‚Ä¶but he/I can play on a higher level‚Ä¶‚Äú. We then explain how important a (good/impressive) start is for any international coming first time to Germany and especially if the plan of the player or ‚Äûselling‚Äú club in North America is a longer career/higher ‚Äûrevenue‚Äú (i.e. participation on future transfers, etc.) in the UEFA /DFB pro world. A lot of clubs / players just focus on getting to Europe, making a/any transfer fee, etc. but do not see the opportunities, risks, downsides, etc. if a wrong /risky decision is made. The publishing /articles of clubs making a transfer (fee) to Europe is often euphoric when it happens and we understand that, but don‚Äôt forget about year two, three, four, etc. We established a data base about United Soccer League (USL), Major League Soccer or Canadian Premier League Players who signed or got transferred to Germany to see if and how their career progressed. I am sure pro leagues or clubs in North America also track their transfers/‚Äúsales‚Äù to Europe to see if they made the right decision, worked with the right people, clubs, etc. and what could have been better and (!) how their / his decision influenced the career of their/the player‚Ä¶. To round up my small post (‚ÄúPlayers from United Soccer League (USL) in Germany!‚Äù) I just read an article about the German club Greifswalder FC (Toni Kroos & Felix Kroos started their career at this club) and I happend to sign two players from United Soccer League (USL) with Greifswalder FC and David Wagner and Lars Fuchs. https://lnkd.in/ezS4Cu_n\n\nSports biz: Americans snap up down-and-out Swiss #soccer team Maybe you saw investors behind the FC Los Angeles (LAFC) just bought Grasshoppers Club Zurich (GCZ), a #swiss pro soccer team. It's a super interesting deal that offers insights into why US groups are buying European #football teams, and how they hope to make money at it. #LAFC's Larry Freedman says his group, which already owns second-division Austrian club FC Wacker Innsbruck and has a partnership with German soccer giant FC Bayern M√ºnchen,wants to restore GCZ to former glory while building a player development and transfer network. For relatively modest sums -- actual amounts are undisclosed -- LAFC, the most valuable US pro football team, gets control of down-on-their-luck European teams with the potential to improve. It's a bit of a \"Moneyball\"-style approach: LAFC investors can use their European teams to develop promising young players who one day could command sizeable transfer fees, should they make it to the Bundesliga or Premier League. And while Swiss and Austrian leagues do represent the provinces of European football -- quality of play here isn't quite up to the levels of the UK, Germany, Italy or even France -- their top teams still get to play in the #ChampionsLeague. By buying teams like the Grasshoppers or Innsbruck, investors secure a reasonable shot at eventually vying for a very lucrative Champions League slot. That could pay off: Appearances against the world's best-known teams are rewarded with tens of millions of dollars. Back in 2018, for instance, the Young Boys Bern got something like $18 million for its @Champions League group-stage debut. It adds up. In this regard, the Grasshoppers in Zurich seem like a decent bet. Over the Swiss team's nearly 140-year history, it's won more national championships than any other club. GCZ were relegated to the country's second division after a disastrous season in 2019. While it rejoined the top Swiss division a couple of years ago, drama has continued as relations more or less soured with its previous owner, China-based Champion Union HK Holding Limited. The LAFC deal puts the club on more stable financial footing. One investor from the US group told the local #zurich newspaper, \"We want to win, and we're going to spend money so that we do win.\" And about the goofy ü§™ Grasshopper's name: Its origins are a bit unclear, but it might have something to do with the wild celebrations its players would throw on the pitch in the early days after scoring a goal. Sounds reasonable to me. At the 2023-2024 winter break, the Grasshoppers sit in 8th place. I'm sure the Americans are hoping the wild goal celebrations return as they look to make their bet pay off. But my favorite GCZ story is how it drove the Swiss author, Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt, who wrote the great crime novel \"The Pledge\", to suffer from writer's block. \"When the Grasshoppers from Zurich lose, I can't write for a week,\" D√ºrrenmatt once wrote.\n\nJust read this very interesting article by kicker about the future of racket sports highlighting new Ultimate Tennis Showdown (UTS Tour) initiated by Patrick Mouratoglou. The UTS is an amazing format and brings a fresh wave of excitement, modernity, and entertainment to the tennis court, breaking traditions and embracing a vibrant, faster-paced, and spectator-friendly format. But does the future of racket sports only lie in tennis? At TIO TIO Social Sports Felix Petersen and I believe ‚ÄúThe Future is Padel!‚Äù. Beyond the benefits enjoyed by active players, padel also offers a remarkable experience for spectators: The compact court paired with glas walls and its emphasis on double play make padel a sport with spectacular rallies and shots laden with a high tension and mental engagement. For this reason, prominent brands like CUPRA Deutschland, American Express, Renault, Volvo Cars or Carlsberg Group have already recognized the potential of what we at TIO TIO do not only call a sport but a lifestyle. In conclusion, the emergence of new formats such as the Ultimate Tennis Showdown (UTS) and the rise of padel exemplify the evolving landscape of racket sports. Both are forward-facing and demonstrate a keen sense of what modern audiences seek. _________ #padel #padeltennis #UTSTennis #tennisinnovation #tiotio #thefutureispadel"
