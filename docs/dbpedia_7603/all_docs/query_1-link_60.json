        "text": "Heading into this season, expectations are a lot higher than they have been in recent years thanks to the hiring of Kenny Brooks. He’s being paid (contract details here) with the expectations of eventually getting Kentucky close to the top of the mountain in not only the SEC, but in all of college basketball.\n\nSo, in year one in Lexington, what should we expect from Brooks’ squad?\n\nSure, you could make an argument for Kentucky being 3rd or 4th in the conference, but there’s also a very real possibility that the ‘Cats finish 6th, 7th or even 8th in the SEC. It’s a tough, grueling conference. On any given night, anyone can beat anyone (except for South Carolina, perhaps).\n\nHowever, from the top to the bottom of the Kentucky women’s basketball organization, expectations for themselves are very high. At Kentucky’s summer media day, Clara Strack talked about how the ‘Cats can play at a high level and how they can put everyone on notice by coming out with a bang.\n\nPlus, if the team can really start out hot, it won’t take the BBN, the most passionate basketball fanbase in the country, very long to rally behind the Coliseum ‘Cats.\n\n“Obviously, Kentucky basketball, like that’s an amazing fanbase,” Strack said. “I think that we have to come out and make a statement. Nobody knows what to expect from us I feel like. I think we can capture that fanbase if we come out and play the way we all know we can.”"
