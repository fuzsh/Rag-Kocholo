        "text": "Long before he worked for Dennis Schröder, Nils Mittmann was his driver. Or rather, his ride home – because at 17, even though he was playing professional basketball in his native Germany, Schröder was not yet old enough to drive.\n\nMittmann was in his early 30s, a few short years away from retirement while Schröder’s career was only starting to bloom. But through conversations with the scrawny teenager perched in his front seat, the car weaving through the cobblestone streets and red roofs of Braunschweig, he found a kind of kinship – and something he admired. To see Schröder darting through and past men twice his age on the court was to see brilliance unfolding.\n\n“You could see his talent, how special he is, how fast he adapted,” Mittman said. “What really impressed me is his attitude: If he decides on something, he will execute it.”\n\nThat early observation has played out into Schröder’s eight-year NBA career. He has one of the NBA’s quickest first steps, driven as much by his decisiveness as speed. When the Lakers guard drives into the paint, or when he lunges into a passing lane for a steal, his strength (and sure, sometimes his weakness) is commitment – the belief that what he’s doing is absolutely going to work.\n\nOwning a team is a much more deliberate decision than any Schröder would ever make on a basketball court, but he’s no less invested: In May, he bought out a group of his partners to become the sole owner of Braunschweig Löwen, his hometown basketball club of which he is the most famous alum. Being a team owner at 27 might smack of audacity and ambition, but those are things Schröder has never lacked.\n\n“The people who were involved before didn’t have the same understanding we had,” Schröder told Southern California News Group in a recent interview. “I think if I invest in something, I want it the right way.”\n\nSchröder didn’t buy his hometown team for vanity, or as a rich man’s collector’s item, or even just to make a little money on the side. The goal is basketball development for players like him: young Germans, especially those with an immigrant background. And yes, in full scope, it is rampantly ambitious, requiring attention to detail varying from which executives and players to bring in, down to the color of the walls of the office.\n\nThat might make Schröder the perfect man for the job.\n\nDEVELOPING GERMAN TALENT\n\nOn his first day of work after the offseason trade that landed him in Los Angeles, Schröder was still settling after flying in from Germany. But teammates had no problem making getting-to-know-you small talk.\n\nQuinn Cook, perhaps one of the most effective networkers in pro basketball, came up to Schröder unprompted: “You signing players from my area!”\n\nOf course, Cook knew that Braunschweig had signed Bryon Allen and James Robinson, two Americans with Maryland-D.C.-Virginia ties. Cook had worked out with them before they turned pro. Now, Schröder is cutting their checks.\n\n“It’s a small world,” Schröder laughed.\n\nAs small as the basketball world is, the successful teams are even more exclusive. In Germany’s top professional league, the BBL, the landscape is historically dominated by clubs from Berlin and Munich, the largest and most robust cities in Germany. What sets those teams apart is the best foreign talent, typically from the United States.\n\nAt the moment, you won’t find Braunschweig at the top of the BBL standings (and recently, they’ve been hamstrung by quarantine protocols that have postponed two straight games). But the team also follows a dramatically different approach, pushing German talent to the fore and signing fewer foreign players.\n\nThere is no better example of this than Schröder himself, who toiled with the club’s farm team for two seasons as a teenager, then exploded onto the scene in 2012 alongside fellow future NBAer Daniel Theis (“they called us the dynamic duo,” Schröder said) before becoming the No. 17 draft pick in 2013 – the highest a guard from the BBL has ever been drafted until Killian Hayes this past year at No. 7.\n\nMittman, who took over as the team’s general manager in November, proudly points out that 65 percent of the team’s minutes are doled out to domestic players, the highest ratio in the BBL. Most teams have six Americans; Braunschweig only has three.\n\nBraunschweig (typically known as Brunswick in English) skews as a blue-collar town, with many citizens working at the nearby Volkswagen factory. Financially, they’re an underdog. But what can help them, the team leadership believes, is finding the next Dennis Schröder.\n\n“We force these young guys to take the step in their development,” Mittman said. “We really are keen on this factor that we want to bring these kinds of players.”\n\nOne of Braunschweig’s two German co-captains is Karim Jallow, a 23-year-old, 6-foot-7 forward who also plays for the national team. Born in Munich, he rose through the well-established club system but hit a glass ceiling: The best playing opportunities were for Americans, not Germans. His agent convinced him to play in Braunschweig, where he’s now the team’s leading scorer (16.5 ppg).\n\nNo one is pumping up Jallow’s opportunity more than Schröder, who besides being the team owner is a national team teammate and one of the numbers in Jallow’s speed dial.\n\n“He told me, ‘You need to use this because there’s not a lot of clubs that would give a German player a really big role,’” Jallow said. “It’s been hard for me to be a captain a lot of times, but I learn and grow with every game. And I know if we want to make the playoffs, I need to step up.”\n\nHANDS-ON APPROACH\n\nOf course, being an owner is not all about motivating your players.\n\nThere was a problem this season, Jallow remembered, when some new players were stuck in some not-so-nice apartments. One of them called Schröder to ask if there were other accommodations available. It was swiftly taken care of.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Schröder handles every issue, and with a full-time playing career in the NBA, he certainly doesn’t handle them all personally. But players feel empowered to approach him.\n\n“Some owners that you have don’t know nothing about basketball,” Jallow said. “It’s not like, ‘I have to talk to the owner of the club about some issues or something and it’s some old guy.’ … Every week we’re in contact, and he’s asking stuff about basketball, about business, as a basketball player but also as a friend.”\n\nIt has not always been this way. When Jallow arrived at the club a year-and-a-half ago, he describes the set-up as “total chaos.” Players couldn’t reach people in the team office who could help them with logistical issues such as the apartment problem. That even stretched to payroll: Jallow said certain players weren’t being paid the same salary they were told they would make.\n\nSchröder has only been in the ownership group for the last three years, but the stewardship of Braunschweig over the last decade has been unsteady to say the least, including what Schröder and Mittman consider to be one of the most short-sighted decisions: The club sold its farm team license to focus on the top-league group, which saved money, but cut off the very developmental system that helped propel Schröder into stardom.\n\n“This was always a platform for the youth, these were the players who developed,” Mittman said. “This is the structure we have to rebuild.”\n\nThe steady accumulation of these missteps prompted Schröder, who owned 70 percent of the club chiefly as a figurehead, to buy out his partners and take a hands-on approach with his brother, his attorney and Mittman, who left a job in a digital agency to get back into basketball.\n\nAs a player, Schröder was deeply impressed by his time in Oklahoma City and the brisk efficiency of General Manager Sam Presti. The Thunder were adept at handling any and all issues off the court, he said, and it gave the players the ability to focus on their jobs. His short time with the Lakers has been similar, he said, and has helped lay out the template of the kind of organization he wants to run.\n\n“You see the vision: Everybody’s really professional; everybody knows where to go with a problem; everybody from the players to the coaches to the weight room guys and trainers are all on the same page,” Schröder said. “What we had the last couple years, it wasn’t like that. I want to bring a little bit of touch from the NBA.”\n\nThat varies from the organization’s strategy of talent development to issues as mundane as the team colors, which have been swapped to black and gold, which Schröder thinks is both more modern but will also have staying power. The team itself has stripped sponsor names from its title, now just standing for the city where it is based.\n\n“Hands-on” is not lip service: Schröder spent part of his shortened offseason repainting the office walls with his associates. He also has made time to practice with some of the players on the court – which Jallow said despite how that might sound hasn’t been intimidating. He talks to players, to coaches and gives everyone advice in search of building the kind of culture he’s seen in the NBA.\n\nHometown pride animates this process: Like his boss, Mittman was born and raised in Braunschweig, and after being a part of top-four teams during his playing career, he was disappointed to see it tail off into irrelevance. They want to make it a team that the residents are proud to call their own again.\n\nMittman had to move from his wife’s hometown to accept the GM job – but when his old teammate called, he couldn’t turn him down.\n\n“I was criticizing the club, but if you have the chance to be a part of it and change it, then you cannot hide,” he said. “Dennis and I, we really started to feel, ‘Hey we want to say we want the same thing.’ So I am thrilled to be a part of this, bring him my ideas and bring Braunschweig back to where it was.”\n\nCREATING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nIf you want to start a sprawling conversation with Schröder, the quickest way is to ask him about his annual summer visits to Gambia, where his mother is from.\n\nSchröder will stay in Gambia for weeks at a time, bringing with him a boatload of donations. But he is endlessly fascinated by the humility and simplicity of life in the West African nation, where it’s custom to share large meals while eating with one’s hands.\n\nThey play basketball there, too. And Schröder has seen some talent that he wants to import to Braunschweig.\n\n“They don’t have a league or any structure: They just play outside and play streetball,” he said. “We want to get those people playing on these platforms and get that opportunity. It means a lot for me and my family.”\n\nThe NBA has identified Africa as one of the world’s most important emerging talent bases. Before the pandemic, the NBA and FIBA were poised to start the Basketball Africa League to serve as a meaningful platform to showcase talent in that continent, but develop it, too (the BAL is still expected to launch in 2021). On a small scale, Schröder would like Braunschweig to help create that pipeline.\n\nJallow also has a Gambian background, which didn’t escape Schröder when they first met with the German national team. They were playing a FIBA qualifying game in Hamburg, and already at that time, Schröder was the top German player. But Jallow felt warmly embraced when he got an invite for dinner at the apartment Schröder was renting next to the team hotel.\n\n“He’s like, ‘Let’s go to my apartment: We’re from the same country, my mom will make us some African food,’” he said. “A lot of people told me he’s a little bit different, he’s arrogant, stuff like that. But if he likes somebody, he’s the nicest guy. You wouldn’t even recognize that he’s a millionaire in the NBA. He’s just a normal person like me.”\n\nHis years in the NBA have changed Schröder, but perhaps not in the ways one might think: He has a family now. He’s a little less tempestuous than he was when he first started. He has a stronger sense of the player he wants to be, and with the Lakers, a firmer grasp on what it takes to be part of a winning team.\n\nAnd as for being an owner, his impulse, now more than ever, is to find a way to pay his career forward – to help his hometown, the team that helped make him an NBA prospect, and more young players in his home country and his mother’s homeland. Even though he’s striding forward as decisively as ever, owning Braunschweig Löwen might be the most definitive sign that Schröder is also looking behind him, too.\n\n“I made it. I’m there,” he said. “Now it’s time to help other people make it, too.”"
