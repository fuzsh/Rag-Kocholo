        "text": "TORONTO - The Big Blue Nation will get its first look at the 2023-24 Wildcats about four months before the start of the regular season, as Kentucky will represent Team USA at Globl Jam in Toronto beginning Wednesday.\n\nThe four-game, four-team event will see Kentucky playing as Team USA, taking on Germany in the opener on Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. EST, Canada Thursday at 8:00 p.m. and Africa Saturday at 1:30 p.m. It will then play in either the Gold or Bronze Medal Game, depending on the first three game's results Sunday against a repeat opponent.\n\nLast season, Kentucky played a four-game exhibition slate in the Bahamas and posted a perfect 4-0 record, but the competition it will face in Toronto will feature a far tougher challenge.\n\nDuring the 2022 installment of Globl Jam, the Baylor Bears, who went on to post a 23-11 record in its upcoming season following the summer trip, went just 1-4.\n\n\"We are heading to play in an event that will require us to be even more physical and compete even harder against these older players,\" UK head coach John Calipari wrote on Twitter ahead of the team's flight to Toronto. \"There will be grabbing and physicality. Thatâ€™s FIBA basketball. Will we be physical enough and have enough fight to compete?\n\n\"Baylor went 1-4 in this event last year, so we know the challenge. There's going to be a lot of randomness to how we play, but we are a really unselfish group and can score in a variety of ways. I'm so excited to learn more about our team!!\"\n\nThe event will feature the unofficial Kentucky debuts of seven new scholarship players, including freshmen DJ Wagner, Robert Dillingham, Justin Edwards, Reed Sheppard, Jordan Burks and Joey Hart, along with West Virginia transfer Tre Mitchell.\n\nAs UK gets set to battle in Toronto, here's a closer look at the competition it will face which includes plenty of NCAA DI talent."
