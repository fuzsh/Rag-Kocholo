        "text": "Karagounis said, “We put a smile on Greek faces. It’s not just that we went through, but it’s the way we did it. I can’t describe the feelings I have tonight.”\n\nThe veteran, however, was unfairly booked after being judged to have dived in an effort to penalty and will now miss out on Greece’s quarter final tie with Germany.\n\nThe captain will be sorely missed. Against Russia he was inspirational for the team, as he has consistently performed throughout his international career. It is not the first time Giorgos Karagounis has been the hero for his country after scoring the first goal of Euro 2004 which Greece went on to win.\n\nKaragounis is unlikely to appear at a major tournament for Greece again but his gallant display against Russia will not be forgotten.\n\nTo pick your Man of the Day and be in with a chance of winning some fantastic prizes go to our competition page here."
