        "text": "Position: Midfielder\n\nDate of Birth: March 6, 1977\n\nClub: Fulham\n\nInternational Debut: v El Salvador (August 19, 1999)\n\nWorld Cup Appearances: 3\n\nWorld Cup Goals: 0\n\nAlthough he has won more than 130 caps for Greece, a sense of missed opportunity is sure to inspire Giorgos Karagounis in Brazil.\n\nDespite being a near ever-present in his country's midfield for the last 15 years, Karagounis has sat on the sidelines for two major moments in Greek football.\n\nGreece's stunning UEFA Euro 2004 win - which culminated in a 1-0 final triumph over tournament hosts Portugal - shocked the football world and made Karagounis and his team-mates well-known across the continent.\n\nYet suspension saw Karagounis, who scored a long-range stunner against Portugal in the tournament opener, miss out on a final appearance.\n\n\"It's hard to takeâ€¦they (UEFA) changed the rules after that tournament and wiped yellow cards off at the semi-final stage,\" he told The Guardian last year.\n\n\"I was the last one to miss out on the old system. Jinxed.\"\n\nFurther disappointment was to come at Euro 2012, with the tenacious midfielder - part of his country's 2010 FIFA World Cup campaign, which saw them claim their first win at the tournament - ruled out of a quarter-final against Germany.\n\nHe scored the goal against Russia that sent Greece through from the group stages, only to receive his second tournament booking for a dispute with referee Jonas Eriksson in the same match.\n\nKaragounis - so determined to bring joy to his compatriots, who were in the midst of a crippling financial crisis - felt Greece should have been awarded a penalty when he appeared to be tripped and was booked for his protests.\n\nAnd although Greece's progression to the last eight brought immense joy to the nation, they lost 4-2 to Germany without their captain.\n\nThe good news for Karagounis is that he has another chance to shine at a major tournament, having made light of his advancing years to play a key role in Greece's run to the 2014 World Cup.\n\nColombia, Ivory Coast and Japan will confront Greece in Group C, and a relatively open pool would appear to provide Fernando Santos' men with an opportunity.\n\nGreece have never made it past the group stages of a World Cup, but can take confidence from the defensive strength they displayed in qualifying, conceding just six goals in 12 matches, including a two-legged play-off against Romania.\n\nWhile Karagounis may no longer be as quick as he used to be, his range of passing and set-piece ability should not be underestimated.\n\nHis wholehearted displays are also likely to inspire team-mates and he should be fresh in Brazil having been frequently overlooked by club side Fulham following the arrival of Felix Magath as manager in February.\n\nGreece's most-capped player would seem to be nearing the end of his career and previously claimed that leading his country to the World Cup would be \"the perfect way to go out\".\n\nWhether he still has retirement on his mind remains to be seen, but with this year's showpiece in Brazil almost certain to be his last major tournament, Karagounis will be determined not to miss out on another key date in Greece's football history."
