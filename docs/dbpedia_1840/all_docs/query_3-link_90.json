And then you try to get into the next phase.\n\n\"We will try to do everything possible (to make that happen).\"\n\nKaragounis also talked up the ability of Celtic striker Georgios Samaras but dismissed suggestions Otto Rehhagel's side relied too much on the 25-year-old.\n\n\"He is a good player but we have others. We have a good team, not relying on one player.\n\n\"Our strength is overall but Samaras is a good footballer.\"\n\nCameroon will be without captain Samuel Eto'o when they take on Georgia in Lienz.\n\nThe Inter Milan striker is being afforded a week-long rest after helping the Nerazzurri win the Champions League with a 2-0 victory over Bayern Munich on Saturday.\n\nEto'o will join the squad when they move their training base to Portugal at the end of the month.\n\nWorld Cup qualifiers Nigeria and Paraguay are also in action tomorrow.\n\nNigeria meet Saudi Arabia in Wattens, Austria while Paraguay take on the Republic of Ireland in Dublin."
