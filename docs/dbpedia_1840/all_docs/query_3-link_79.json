        "text": "GIORGOS Karagounis promised there's more to come after making his Fulham debut in last weekend's defeat to Manchester City.\n\nThe veteran Greek midfielder came off the bench following an injury to Chris Baird in the late stages of the 2-1 reverse at Craven Cottage.\n\nAnd Karagounis, who signed a short-term deal until the end of the season last month, insists he will get better with more games under his belt.\n\nHe said: “I feel good and I’ve been working hard here now for 25 days. I’ve trained hard and played a practice match too to allow me to get used to the rhythm of play.\n\n“The main focus for me now is to get used to the pace of the game, I feel good and physically I am ready.”\n\nThe Whites have won three of their opening six games to leave them ninth in the table ahead of Sunday's trip to Southampton.\n\nAnd Karagounis reckons the sky's their limit.\n\nHe added: “our aimt is to do as well as we can in the Premier League and to be as high up the table as possible, hopefully do well in a cup also.\n\n“For now, I think we are progressing well and we are playing good entertaining football and scoring a lot of goals, one of the highest scoring teams in the Premier League, and this is a good basis to move forwards.“\n\nMeanwhile, fans are invited to join Fulham Football Club’s mascot, Billy the Badger, for a sponsored walk in aid of local children and teenagers with life-limiting conditions.\n\nThe event, which starts at the club's Motspur Park training ground and ends at Craven Cottage on the banks of the Thames, takes place on Saturday October 13.\n\nThe scenic stroll is a total distance of seven miles, achievable by all, and begins at 3pm. Participants, accompanied on the walk by Fulham FC’s very own Billy the Badger, are expected to complete the route by approximately 7.30pm. On arrival at Craven Cottage, all those taking part will be welcomed by Fulham FC and have the opportunity for refreshments at the stadium.\n\nParticipants are asked to contribute a joining fee of £10 for adults and £5 for children and raise a minimum of £50 sponsorship per entrant with all proceeds being split equally between Shooting Star CHASE and Fulham Football Club Foundation.\n\nTo find out more and to sign up please visit: http://www.shootingstarchase.org.uk/events/community/billy-badgers-twilight-stroll\n\nFollow us on Facebook and Twitter for the latest Fulham news."
