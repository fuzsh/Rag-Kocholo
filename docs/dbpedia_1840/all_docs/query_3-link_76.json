        "text": "ATHENS — Greece says it has reached an agreement with former captain Giorgos Karagounis to join the national team staff, as the midfielder ends a playing career that included European Championship glory in 2004.\n\nThe football association on Friday said the 37-year-old midfielder would work alongside new national coach Claudio Ranieri, but said details of his new position remained to be worked out.\n\nKaragounis ended his international career at the World Cup in Brazil, making his 139th appearance in the second-round penalty shootout loss to Costa Rica.\n\nIt was unclear whether he would continue with club football after a second season at Fulham last year. A longtime star at Greek club Panathinaikos, Karagounis also played for Inter Milan and Benfica."
