        "text": "Giorgos Karagounis is ending his playing career and will become a member of Greece's coaching staff, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe country announced Karagounis' hiring Friday as the former Fulham player gets set to work alongside manager Claudio Ranieri during the country's bid to qualify for the 2016 European Championships.\n\nKaragounis earned 139 caps for Greece and was a member of the squad that went to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup. He announced his international retirement shortly after Greece was eliminated in the second round by Costa Rica.\n\nHe was a member of Panathinaikos on two separate occasions where he helped them capture the Superleague Greece title and the Greek Cup in 2010.\n\nKaragounis made the move to England the following season when he joined Fulham. After playing in the Premier League for two seasons, he was released from Fulham after the club was relegated, and failed to sign on with a team before the start of the new season..\n\nHis proudest moment, however, will undoubtedly be Greece's championship winning performance in Portugal when the country won its first major trophy during the 2004 European Championship."
