        "text": "Georgios Karagounis was born in 1977 in Pyrgos, Greece. His professional playing career began at Apollon Smyrnis in 1996 and in 1998 he moved to Panathinaikos, where he played until 2003 and made 118 league appearances.\n\nIn the summer transfer window Karagounis signed for the Italian Serie A team Internazionale. In the 2003/04 he wasnât used on a regular basis and also wasnât given enough playing time the following season and Inter was dissappoined with the third finish in the league and the quarter final of the UEFA Champions League.\n\nKaragounis left Italy for Portugal, signing for Benfica in 2005. There he spent two seasons, showed a good play and in 2007 he returned to Greece, re-joining Panathinaikos. He stayed there until 2012 and in 2010 they won Superleague Greece and Greek Cup. In September 2012 he moved to Fulham. In the summer 2014, upon Fulham's relegation from Premier League, the 37-year old Karagounis was released from Craven Cottage.\n\nKaragounis earned his first cap for the Greece national team in 1999 in the match against El Salvador. He was a part of the team winning Euro 2004 and since then he was the national team regular, taking part in major international tournaments. In the 2010 World Cup he was the Greece national team captain, playing in the last eight of the EUFA Euro 2012 Karagounis received two yellow cards and that kept him aside from the quarterfinals. In 2014 Karagounis captained the national team in Brazil, and retired from international football after Greece were beaten by Costa Rica in the round of 16."
