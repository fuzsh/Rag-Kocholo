        "text": "In an interview with Italian news outlet Il Posticipo, former Inter midfielder Georgios Karagounis has reflected on his spell with Inter among other Inter related topics.\n\n“After having played well with Greece, Inter came for me. In Milan I had two difficult seasons,” he began the interview.\n\n“There were many great players in the team, but many problems too. When you don’t win, there’s so much pressure and it grows day by day. That was our case.”\n\nHe then reflected on his time with Inter as a while and admitted he met several great people whilst at the Nerazzurri side.\n\n“Playing at Inter was a great experience. There were great people there, the staff was excellent. Moratti was a fantastic person. It was really nice for me.”\n\nNext he went on to spoke what it was like to come up against Jose Mourinho’s Inter in the Champions League in 2008 when he was back at Panathinaikos.\n\n“It was not easy to take on my former teammates at San Siro. It was a historic victory for Panathinaikos as we beat a very strong team led by Mourinho.\n\n“With that success we ended the group in first place in front of the Nerazzurri. It was a great feeling for all of us. Being at San Siro was special, it always invokes good memories.”\n\nHe then discussed what he makes of the current Inter who are managed by former Italian national team boss Antonio Conte.\n\n“Today I am following Inter and cheering for the team. Unfortunately after the last results I think it is difficult for the team to win the league.”\n\nKaragounis then proceeded to speak on one of Inter’s latest recruits, compatriot Georgios Vagiannidis, and has insisted that Vagiannidis can be a success if he works hard.\n\n“Unfortunately I don’t know him, because he has only played few times for the Panathinaikos first team and only once game in the Greek league.\n\n“I have been told that Vagiannidis has real potential. We all hope he does well. He has joined a great team, we all know it’s not easy to impose yourself but when you are young, you can learn but if you work hard, you can do it. Vagiannidis has his future ahead of him.”\n\nIn conclusion he spoke on what it is like to be able to play for Inter Forever alongside some of his former teammates and other Inter legends.\n\n“We all have fun together. It’s good to see old friends, we are happy to meet each other. There is a beautiful relationship between us. I like playing for Inter Forever, the games are always good.”"
