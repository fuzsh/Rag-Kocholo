        "text": "Fulham have signed Giorgos Karagounis until the end of this season. The 35-year-old Greece captain joins on a free transfer, having been without a club since his contract with Panathinaikos ended earlier this year.\n\nThe Fulham manager, Martin Jol, said: \"Giorgos Karagounis has a wealth of club and international experience and I'm happy that he's joined us for this season.\n\n\"He's been an influential player for his club sides and is a renowned player in world football as he's about to become the most-capped player for Greece. He brings many certain qualities to our squad.\"\n\nThe veteran, who has also played for Internazionale and Benfica, will help to fill the void left at Fulham by the summer departures of Clint Dempsey and Moussa Dembélé to Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nKaragounis said: \"I'm delighted to have signed for Fulham and I am excited by a new challenge in England and the Premier League. I'm looking forward to working under Martin Jol and playing alongside some fantastic players at this club.\"\n\nEuro 2012 saw Karagounis earn a record-equalling 120th cap for Greece before missing the outright record after being controversially suspended for their quarter-final defeat to Germany. He has not played for his country since and was left out of the squad for their opening World Cup qualifiers this month, apparently because he was without a club."
