He is best remembered for scoring the first goal of UEFA Euro 2004, a very long range effort that helped his team to win the opening game of the tournament, in which the Greeks surprisingly emerged as champions.\n\nHis style of play combined with his rather small stature have earned him comparisons with the former Greek midfield star Mimis Domazos. ESPN football analyst George James stated that he was \"one of the most underrated players in the world.\""
