        "text": "“Karagounis was there at the beginning, scoring the opening goal of Euro 2004, when Greece stunned Portugal. And he is still there now, captaining the side at the age of 35.\n\n\"He is the second-most capped player in Greek history and remains both a dogged worker in midfield and a deliverer of fine set plays -- his most memorable free kicks probably being the two he scored against Portugal in a friendly in Germany in '08.”\n\n\"For us this is the second time that it's happened. Of course, we have good memories from the tournament in Portugal eight years ago, and I hope we manage to do the same. Playing in the opening match of the tournament is great for us.\n\n\"On the pitch, the atmosphere was great and both the Greek and Portuguese fans contributed to that. Everything was positive for us and for me especially, with scoring the first goal of the tournament.\n\nWe're not so interested in knowing what predictions the experts make about us. We're focused on our job, on what we believe, and if we truly have faith in our potential, we can achieve a lot of things."
