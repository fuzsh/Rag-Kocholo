AFP

Evergreen Giorgos Karagounis has been a cult figure since scoring the first goal of Euro 2004 to set Greece on the road to an astonishing title. Now 37-years-old the midfielder is going strong in the Premier League at Fulham, and for Greece as Fernando Santos' man on the pitch. He is a gritty, streetwise leader with a huge work rate and a knack for important goals. He spent two five years spells at Panathanaikos, two years at Inter Milan and two years at Benfica and is Greece's most capped player ever. The old warhorse is desperate to do well at Brazil 2014 in honor of his compatriots, who he says have had the smiles wiped from their faces by the economic crisis.
