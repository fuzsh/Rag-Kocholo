        "text": "Every year, “gamescom” attracts more than 350,000 visitors, making it the biggest consumer trade fair in the global gaming sector. “Games are an international phenomenon,” says Felix Falk, Managing Director of ‘game’, the German Games Industry Association. “Around three billion people from all over the world are players. For this international community, ‘gamescom’ is the highlight event of the year. The global nature of our industry necessitates central events where the community and industry representatives can come together.”\n\nThis year Xbox and Porsche will be showcasing a Taycan 4S with a unique, colourful livery wrap to celebrate the car manufacturer’s 75th anniversary. This uniquely wrapped all-electric Taycan 4S along with a 917 wrapped in the iconic “hippy” livery is being offered to Forza Horizon 5 players to mark this special anniversary starting today to download.\n\n“We are proud to be celebrating our anniversary together with Xbox at ‘gamescom’,” says Deniz Keskin, Director of Brand Management and Partnerships at Porsche AG. “Porsche and Microsoft have had a strong partnership for many years. The racing games in the Forza series give people the opportunity to experience our sports cars virtually. We now have millions of fans worldwide.” And in the new Forza Motorsport game being presented at the trade fair, sports cars from Zuffenhausen are once again playing a major role.\n\nOnly 75 consoles worldwide\n\nPorsche has collaborated with Xbox to create six different Porsche-inspired Xbox Series X consoles with matching Xbox Wireless Controllers, each commemorating famous motorsport designs. These include that of the 917 Salzburg and the current 963, and for the first time all six of the designs can be seen by the public together at \"gamescom”. The series is limited to 75 units worldwide, with each one only being available via a sweepstakes that is running until 1 October. Six lucky visitors to the Xbox stand at \"gamescom” will also have the chance to take home one of the individually designed consoles.\n\n„Showcasing our Porsche-inspired Xbox Series X limited edition consoles and controllers at 'gamescom’ serves as an exciting moment to celebrate Porsche's 75 th Anniversary for Xbox and Porsche fans alike,” said Marcos Waltenberg, Director of Global Partnerships at Xbox. “For decades, Porsche has created some of the most iconic liveries ever to take to track and it was an honour to bring those to life through our custom consoles and controllers.”\n\nAt gamescom, Microsoft’s “Turn 10 Studios”, the developers of the Forza series, will be giving fans a first-hand look at Forza Motorsport’s single player career mode, “Builder’s Cup”. This latest edition to the Motorsport franchise, includes a suite of Porsche models to choose from including super sports cars, motorsport icons and historic models that can be raced on world famous tracks rebuilt for a new generation. Forza Motorsport will be available beginning 10 October 2023 on Xbox Series X|S, PC and Steam.
