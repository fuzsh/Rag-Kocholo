        "text": "The indie scene has been around for as long as there have been video games, so it’s no surprise that it’s had its fair share of wild success stories, from Minecraft in 2009 (well before Microsoft bought Mojang, the studio that created it) to the recent Palworld, which became the second-most played game on Steam ever—out of completely nowhere.\n\nIn many ways, indie games are what excites some people the most, thanks to some of the best creativity and innovation within the gaming industry. After all, indie developers can push boundaries in a way that AAA developers can’t, so the indie scene has some of the best studios, not only in this sphere but also in the industry at large.\n\nWhat is an indie game studio?\n\nTypically, indie studios are defined by their small nature, usually fewer than 100 people—sometimes just one—and being independent, meaning they aren’t tied down to a big publisher. Sometimes, the waters can get a little murky. Take, for instance, Ori and the Blind Forest, and its sequel, Will of the Wisps.\n\nBoth of these great games were made by a studio that retained its independence, Moon Studios, but received help from and was subsequently published by Microsoft. While we would’ve loved to put Moon Studio on this list, No Rest for the Wicked just came out, it’s hard to make room amidst all these other great studios.\n\nTypically, though, indie games are either self-published or published by specifically an indie publisher, like Devolver Digital.\n\nWhile any game that’s on the cheaper side and has “indie sensibilities” can get given the label, sometimes those games aren’t indie at all. Another example, the Rayman series, looks and plays like a lot of indie games, but these are Ubisoft games through and through. That makes them great games … just not indie.\n\nThe history of indie games\n\nThere have been “independent” games as long as there has been a video game industry. On some level, you could consider Pong, one of the earliest and most successful video games ever, to be an indie game. But back then, when it came out in 1972, there wasn’t really an indie scene, or any scene at all.\n\nIndie games, as we know and love today, started to arise in the early 2000s. During this time, digital distribution made getting your game out there and in the hands of ravenous gamers all the easier. No longer did developers have to go through the effort of finding a publisher so that they could have their games packed up and shipped off to brick and mortar stores. They could just put them on Steam.\n\nOne of the first examples of these types of games, Cave Story—which narrowly missed this list—came out even before Steam was a thing, although Cave Story+ hit Steam in 2011. Since then, indie game after indie game has come out. Today, indie games come out by the truckload—you can just look at the Steam new releases for a glimpse into the delightful madness.\n\nWhat’s more, the indie game industry shows no signs of slowing down, with some great titles to look forward to in 2024 and beyond, created by the best indie studios out there. Let’s dive into just a small selection of ten of them, in no particular order.\n\nThe best indie game studios\n\n1. Wildboy Studios\n\nFounded: 2017\n\nLocated in: Wellington, New Zealand\n\nTeam size: 3\n\nKnown for: ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree, Nitro Kid\n\nWildboy Studios is the brainchild of three close friends, who founded the studio with the goal of making not only captivating artistic expressions but also great games. It’s fair to say that they’ve achieved all that and more.\n\nTheir first project, ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree, was an Apple Arcade launch title in 2019. This narrative puzzle game jumps out at you from the moment you lay your eyes on the fantastic, hand-drawn angular art that’s as hyper-stylized as it is beautiful.\n\nOnce the freshness of the art settles, you can truly appreciate what else ATONE has to offer with its Norse-inspired story. Make decisions as the main character, Estra, and be left with the consequences if you’ve chosen poorly. The plethora of choices leads to subtle narrative branching, and this, mixed with superb voice acting, leads to a replayable experience, giving you something different each playthrough.\n\nUltimately, with a deft mix of rhythm combat, complex puzzles, and engaging narrative, ATONE maintains a great pace through the five hours or so that it takes to complete. And though this adventure game left Apple Arcade in the middle of 2022, ATONE came out a few months later on PC, PS4, and Switch in January of 2023.\n\nWildboy Studios’ second game, Nitro Kid, hit Steam in 2022, which, thanks to the wonders of publishing, was a year before ATONE had its own Steam release. Nitro Kid is a synth-fueled, deck-building rogue-like featuring over 30 musical tracks by the likes of LudoWic, Tonebox, and Jules Reves. Meaning that Nitro Kid might be a game worth buying for its music alone, especially if you’re a fan of synthwave. It’s just an added benefit that the game itself is excellent.\n\nThis great little game flew under the radar for a lot of people, so there’s a good chance that you haven’t heard of it before. Nitro Kid has a lot in common with Slay the Spire—another great indie game—build a deck of movies, and try to make it as far as you can without dying. It’s an addictive loop that’s only made more engaging by the awesome sound design, art, and music.\n\nAs for what’s next for Wildboy Studios, we know that the three-man team is diligently working on their third project, but it has yet to be revealed, nor do we know for sure whether it will be out in 2024. Nevertheless, with any luck, it won’t be long before we see what Wildboy Studios is cooking up next.\n\n2. Thunder Lotus\n\nFounded: 2014\n\nLocated in: Montreal, Canada\n\nTeam size: 34\n\nKnown for: Spiritfarer, Jotun\n\nSince its inception, it seems like Thunder Lotus’s great games have done nothing but give the studio more and more prominence.\n\nAfter a successful Kickstarter campaign that netted over $64,000, Thunder Lotus found a great deal of success with their first title, Jotun, back in 2015. This action/adventure game was based on the deep, interesting Norse mythology and featured engaging gameplay, as well as a hand-painted art style that was nothing short of breathtaking.\n\nFrom there, Thunder Lotus went on to make Sundered in 2017, which is a must-play for any who loves not only the studio’s fantastic art, but also a Lovecraftian-inspired story. With this second game, the studio firmly established itself as one of the best indie studios out there, with not only some of the best art in the industry, but also the great gameplay to back it up.\n\nThen came Spiritfarer in 2021, a game that covers the sensitive topic of loss from a personal and intimate perspective as you take over Charon’s job of ferrying the dead to the afterlife. Part sim and management, part narrative adventure, Spiritfarer broaches a subject that some might find uncomfortable—but does so adeptly and with the fantastic art the studio has become known for. Arguably, it is also Thunder Lotus’s best game.\n\nWhat’s in store for Thunder Lotus in 2024? Not one immortal, but 33 of them. Their next game, 33 Immortals, is an action-roguelike that forces 33 players to work together in an effort to rebel against God’s final judgment—now we know where all the spirits in Spiritfarer were headed, or at least that’s going to be my own personal headcanon.\n\n33 Immortals conjures up images of big MMO raids like that of World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, or, if you’re a true gamer, Everquest. If the thought of that tickles your fancy, you can rest assured knowing that you won’t have to wait too long to sink your teeth into the game. 33 Immortals is due out this year, and if you happen to be reading this before May 24th, 2024, then you can sign up for a beta that runs from then until June 2nd.\n\nWhile we can’t exactly predict the future to know whether 33 Immortals continues Thunder Lotus’s string of great games, the studio is easily trending upward, so hopes are high for their next game.\n\n3. Team Cherry\n\nFounded: 2014\n\nLocated in: Adelaide, Australia\n\nTeam size: 3\n\nKnown for: Hollow Knight\n\nAlthough Team Cherry currently only has one game to its name, that one game is a doozie: Hollow Knight. Inspired by the side-scrolling action games of yore, like MegaMan, the team originally conceived what would become Hollow Knight in 2013. Team Cherry then took to Kickstarter at the end of 2014 for a little extra support.\n\nThey blew past their original goal of AU$ 35,000 to make over AU$ 57,000. From there, it was only a matter of time—quite a bit of time—and in 2017, Hollow Knight finally came out. (As is the case with most Kickstarters, they had no hopes of meeting their original Just 2015 goal, but such is the way of game development and stretch goals.)\n\nHollow Knight was an instant hit. At its core, the game is a side-scrolling, 2D action platformer, jam-packed with Metroidvania influences. Metroidvania, for the unaware, is a subgenre of games in which you explore vast worlds, earning upgrades that unlock new areas and paths as you go. The word itself is a portmanteau of Metroid and Castlevania, the two games that inspired the genre.\n\nThe game sees you assume the role of the insect-like “Knight” as you delve deep into an underground kingdom, fighting enemies and earning upgrades along the way. Make no mistake, Hollow Knight is fantastic, with tight controls, and even tighter art and sound design. So, if you haven’t played it yet, you owe it to yourself to check it out. If you have played it—you probably still wake up in the middle of the night with the Hornet cries and giggles that you heard so often while fighting her.\n\nIf you’ve been a Hollow Knight fan, chances are you’ve now been waiting for the sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, for what feels like a lifetime. Originally announced way back in 2019, Silksong puts you into the shoes of the aforementioned Hornet, who—as it turns out—is the princess of the kingdom you bounce around in during the first game.\n\nSilksong originally began as DLC for the main game, but over the years, it has expanded in scope to become the sequel to Hollow Knight, and after five years of development, one could only hope that it must be almost done and that an announcement for a 2024 release date is looming on the horizon.\n\n4. Yacht Club Games\n\nFounded: 2011\n\nLocated in: Los Angeles, USA\n\nTeam size: 24\n\nKnown for: Shovel Knight\n\nFortunately, there’s enough room on this list for two knights, one hollow and one wielding a shovel. Founded in 2011 in Los Angeles, Yacht Club Games is the team behind the ever-popular Shovel Knight, and the booming franchise it spawned.\n\nMuch like Hollow Knight, Shovel Knight found a lot of success with Kickstarter—more than even the other knight. In 2013, supporters blew past the original goal of $75,000 and reached well over $300,000, achieving all the stretch goals; it also only took them until 2019 to deliver all of those stretch goals.\n\nTake one look at Shovel Knight, and you can see exactly what inspired the indie studio: the games they and a lot of other people grew up with. To say that the game has retro sensibilities would be selling it short. With its delightfully crafted 8-bit graphics, Shovel Knight looks like it would be right at home on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and the team at Yacht Club Games even created the music to emulate what would be heard on the old NES’s sound chip.\n\nWith underlying humor—you’re a knight who bonks enemies with a shovel, after all—and a presentation that feels like it’s straight out of 1989, it’s no wonder that Shovel Knight catapulted Yacht Club Games’ success and kept them quite busy.\n\nSince Shovel Knight’s release in 2014, Yacht Club Games has produced a steady stream of expansion packs and spin-offs for Shovel Knight, adding more and more content to their golden little goose. The Shovel Knight himself has also appeared in other games as a cameo, and the studio has now also published a couple of games.\n\nAs for what’s next for Yacht Club Games, in 2022, the studio ran a Kickstarter for their next all-new project, Mina the Hollower—not to be confused with Hollow Knight! This time around, the studio was aiming to make an homage to the old Gameboy Color games in this action-adventure title. The campaign met its goal in under 12 hours, and by the end of the campaign, Yacht Club Games had raised over $1.2 million.\n\nWe’re still unfortunately unsure when Mina will be out; while the original campaign had an estimated delivery of December 2023, that date has come and gone, and with the massive success of the Kickstarter, even a 2024 release date is looking a little iffy. But Yacht Club Games can take as long as they want, because we know that Mina the Hollower will be great.\n\n5. ⁠⁠Supergiant Games\n\nFounded: 2009\n\nLocated in: San Francisco, USA\n\nTeam size: 24\n\nKnown for: Bastion, Hades\n\nSupergiant Games is practically a household name in the indie game scene. The studio hit the ground running in 2011 with its first game, Bastion, which, to date, has sold over three million copies. Bastion kicked off Supergiant’s enticing and masterfully executed mix of art, audio, and gameplay: voice acting, music, killing enemies with a sword—these games have it all, and have it all well.\n\nOne of Bastion’s defining qualities is the game’s narrator, who accompanies the player throughout their journey. This feature worked so well that every one of Supergiant’s games through the years has leveraged voice-over to great effect—and by the same voice actor: Logan Cunningham.\n\nAnother fun Supergiant fact is that if you were heavy into gaming in the mid-2000s, you might’ve recognized another Supergiant team member from the reviews he wrote for Gamespot: Greg Kasavin. He went on to become the creative director of Supergiant, and helps to create each game’s stellar narrative.\n\nAfter Bastion, Supergiant released Transistor in 2014 as a sort of spiritual successor. Transistor traded Bastion’s fantasy setting for a sci-fi setting, and its action-RPG gameplay for a turn-based strategy/RPG experience. Pyre came next in 2017; while still retaining the great art and narrative chops of Supergiant’s previous games, this one tried something new gameplay-wise and based the experience around a competition, making it an RPG/sports game.\n\nThen, in 2018—just when maybe you could think that Supergiant had no more tricks up its sleeve—Hades entered early access and was fully released a couple of years later in 2020. Hades has perhaps become the game that the studio has become best known for. This one combined what everyone loves most about their games and melded it with the rogue-like genre, which has risen to prominence in the last decade. The end result is arguably one of the best rogue-like games ever made.\n\nSupergiant must’ve liked making Hades so much that they decided to make another one, and in 2022, they announced their first sequel: Hades 2, which, coincidentally, coincides with what they’ve been up to in 2024. Though Hades 2 is nowhere near done, Supergiant is planning once again to launch it into early access this year, and relatively soon. They held a technical test in April of this year, with the early access launch planned sometime soon after that ends. So, fans of Hades have a lot to look forward to, as Hades 2 looks to carry on the legacy of the first game, cementing Supergiant Games as one of the best indie studios out there.\n\n6. Playdead\n\nFounded: 2006\n\nLocated in: Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nTeam size: 70+\n\nKnown for: Limbo, Inside\n\nWhile Playdead has only released two games, those two games are absolutely phenomenal, more than earning the studio a spot on this list.\n\nThe first game, a puzzle/platformer by the name of Limbo, is undoubtedly known to many and has been a mainstay in the indie scene since its release in 2010. This creepy little game follows a boy as he searches the land of the dead for his sister. As one might expect from the land in between, Limbo is a beautifully bleak game, entirely in black and white, with silhouettes expertly utilized so that you can see where to go and how to get there.\n\nAll in all, Limbo is a harrowing and very satisfying experience, well deserving of the acclaim it’s received over the last fourteen years. This heartfelt experience will linger with you from the moment you beat the story.\n\nIt took nearly six years, but in 2016, Playdead released the follow-up to Limbo: Inside, which received as much acclaim as the first game, firmly cementing Playdead as one of the best indie studios out there. Inside was a true successor to Limbo; both games are side scrollers, but Inside upgrades the experience from a 2D to a 2.5D experience, meaning that Inside’s world has depth, and though you are running in a straight line from left to right (mostly), there’s a world happening the background in every scene.\n\nThat world, as it happens, is a dystopian fever dream, with virtually zero dialog and lots and lots of atmosphere. The boy (not the same boy as from Limbo, mind you, but a boy nonetheless) adventures through a world that in some ways seems similar enough to ours, but you can immediately tell that something isn’t quite right. It’s creepy in the best possible way, urging you to uncover more about the nature of the world.\n\nWhile not fully black and white like Limbo, Inside uses a muted, nearly monochromatic presentation, with colors used sparingly to highlight things of importance. The end result is a game that is unexpectedly beautiful yet depressing.\n\nFor nearly eight years now, Playdead has been hard at work on their third game; unfortunately, we don’t know much about it yet, but they’ve been teasing since 2017, and about the only thing we do know is that it will be sci-fi in nature. We can, of course, cross our fingers that Playdead’s third game will be out in 2024, and who knows, we might be right—but it would be mostly thinking.\n\nNevertheless, if it’s anything like Limbo and Inside, we can expect great things.\n\n7. Oddworld Inhabitants\n\nFounded: 1994\n\nLocated in: San Luis Obispo, USA\n\nTeam size: 75\n\nKnown for: Oddworld\n\nOddworld needs little introduction. In 1994, a couple of special effects veterans, Lorne Lanning and Sherry McKenna, got together and founded Oddworld Inhabitants, the studio handling all things Oddworld, and for thirty years and counting, the duo has been the franchise’s keepers.\n\nEver since the first Oddworld game, Abe’s Odyssee, in 1997, the series has become known for its unique world, which is, in a word, much more odd than ours. Each game in the series is unique and funny, and while most of them have been 2D, side-scrolling platformers with lots of puzzle-solving, Oddworld Inhabitants flexed their first-person shooter muscles with Stranger’s Wrath in 2005.\n\nAnother odyssey rivaling that of even Abe or Munch themselves is Oddworld Inhabitants’ experiences with publishers through the 90s and 2000s. The first two games, Abe’s Odyssee and Abe’s Exoddus, were on the PlayStation, while the next two games, Munch’s Odyssee and Stranger’s Wrath, were both on the original Xbox. Just looking at the Wikipedia list of the studio’s publishers between 1997 and 2005 gave some indication of the roller coaster of platforms and publishers.\n\nThat’s probably why the Oddworld series basically went dormant for five years, from 2005 to 2010. After that, the studio started to show some activity: they started working with Just Add Water, who, alongside Inhabitants, remastered Stranger’s Wrath and released it on Steam (and other platforms) starting at the end of 2010. After that, the duo remastered Munch’s Oddysee in 2012. Both of these titles are great updates to the games, bringing them to a wider audience—and making them a little prettier in the process.\n\nJust Add Water and Oddworld Inhabitants then teamed up again for a ground-up remake of Abe’s Oddysee in 2014: Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty. While fundamentally similar to the original game, this remake transitioned the game to a 2.5D perspective, adding plenty of depth to the experience, and making Oddworld truly come to life for a new generation.\n\nIt took seven years, but the next Oddworld game came out in 2021, this time created solely by Oddworld Inhabitants. Oddworld: Soulstorm, much like New ‘n’ Tasty, is a remake of Abe’s Exoddus that takes the original game and expands on it, reimagining and retelling the story for a new generation of both people and consoles. While mostly great, Soulstorm was a little rough around the edges, and an enhanced edition of it came out in 2022.\n\nAs for what’s next, Lorne Lanning and the inhabitants of Oddworld intend for this new series of games to be a pentalogy, so if everything goes according to the plan, we can hopefully expect at least three more Oddworld games. However, the studio hasn’t announced what’s next, or when we might expect it, so while the legacy continues, it might be a while before we see another entry to the series.\n\nHowever, thanks to that fantastic legacy, Oddworld Inhabits has more than earned its place on this list.\n\n8. Drinkbox Studios\n\nFounded: 2008\n\nLocated in: Toronto, Canada\n\nTeam size: 15\n\nKnown for: Guacamelee, Nobody Saves the World\n\nYou might know this next studio for Guacamelee! and its sequel—two games would probably also win an award for “best pun in a video game title.” But Drinkbox Studios has had a long history of making great games, starting with the PlayStation 3 exclusive Tales from Space: About a Blob in 2011.\n\nThis little title established the stylized and eye-catching art that would fuel all of Drinkbox’s games moving forward and was ultimately a fun little platformer. A year later, in 2012, the sequel, Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack, invaded the PS Vita and PC and PS3, Xbox 360 in 2014, and in 2019, it landed on the Switch.\n\nWith their artistic juices flowing, next, Drinkbox hit it out of the park with Guacamelee! in 2013. Another Metroidvania, this one has a lot in common with the aforementioned Hollow Knight—only with a lot more punching and kicking. As one might expect from the title, Guacamelee! draws its inspiration from Mexican culture and absolutely nails the look and feel, with whimsical goofiness that’s hard not to love—plus, it allows drop-in co-op with one other player.\n\nGuacamelee! had super long legs, too, receiving plenty of updates and DLC, culminating in the Super Turbo Championship Edition (complete edition) in 2014.\n\nWhile fans didn’t have long to wait for Guacamelee! 2, Drinkbox first took a slight detour and made Severed in 2016, which came out on PlayStation and Nintendo systems, as well as iOS. This action/adventure game was intended to use touch controls, making it perfectly suited for the Wii U and 3DS. Severed definitely flew under the radar, so if you have a platform that can play it, it’s worth checking out.\n\nNot long after that, Drinkbox Games unleashed Guacamelee! 2 in 2018. Like a good sequel, it’s bigger and better than the first, and upgrades from two-person to four-person co-op, for absolute and exceedingly fun bedlam. By this point, Drinkbox had established itself as an indie powerhouse.\n\nIn 2022, they tried something new after having cut their teeth with primarily side-scrolling action games with Nobody Saves the World. This time around, Drinkbox took its inspiration from Zelda to create a top-down RPG, full of goofiness and charm, similar in a way to their previous games, just taking place in an all-new world and adventure. Nobody Saves the World, much like Severed, flew under the radar for a lot of people, so it’s still worth checking out if you missed it.\n\nAs for what’s next for Drinkbox, the studio released DLC for Nobody Saves the World toward the end of 2022, so it’s still a bit early for them to reveal their next project, but if we’re being optimistic, we could see it as early as late 2024, or early 2025.\n\n9. ConcernedApe\n\nFounded: 2012\n\nLocated in: Seattle, USA\n\nTeam size: 1\n\nKnown for: Stardew Valley\n\nWhile there are some small teams on this list, with Wildboy Studios and Team Cherry both clocking in at three developers, it doesn’t get much smaller than ConcernedApe—the solo developer who made Stardew Valley.\n\nWay back in 2012, Eric Barone, who goes by ConcernedApe online, began working on what would eventually become not only one of the most successful indie games of all time, but one of the most successful video games ever: Stardew Valley.\n\nHeavily inspired by the Story of Seasons (previously known as Harvest Moon) series, ConcernedApe aimed to capture what made the early games in the series great, and in the process, he produced—all on his own—something that could arguably be considered even greater than its inspiration.\n\nIt took him over four years, but Stardew Valley eventually came out in 2016, and it hit the ground running, selling more than two million dollars within two months; to date, the game has sold over 30 million. In the years since, Stardew has done nothing but grow and grow, receiving new content regularly, and though ConcernedApe is still the primary developer behind it all, he has received a little help over the years.\n\nNot only is Stardew Valley still updated, but those updates are still quite language and feature-rich. Just this past March, version 1.6 of the game increased the multiplayer co-op count from four players to eight, among other major changes.\n\nAnd just looking at the game, you can tell what a labor of love it is: the pixel art is meticulously crafted, the music is splendid, and it’s perhaps one of the most wholesome games you can play, either by yourself or with friends.\n\nStardew Valley has also spawned a board game for those who want to grow their own farm and explore the valley from their very own tabletop. What’s more, the music of Stardew Valley went on tour in 2024 with the Festival of Seasons, performed by a live chamber orchestra. Unfortunately, though, if you were thinking of going, you’ve missed out since the tour is completely sold out, except for a couple of shows.\n\nWhile Stardew Valley is nothing short of a phenomenon, ConcernedApe has been working on a few other projects, one of which has been announced: Haunted Chocolatier, a game in which you move into a haunted castle with the sole purpose of selling delicious chocolate. He’s been working on this one since 2020, and with no known release date, it could be a while before we see it, especially since the entire time while developing it, Concerned Ape has also been continuing to work on Stardew Valley.\n\nBetween his passion, and the long-term support he’s provided to Stardew Valley, it’s no wonder that ConcernedAPe earned himself a spot on this list; it’s just an added bonus that the game itself is a masterpiece.\n\n10. Playtonic\n\nFounded: 2014\n\nLocated in: Derby, UK\n\nTeam size: 27\n\nKnown for: Yooka-Laylee\n\nIndie or not, Playtonic has an impressive pedigree; this studio is composed primarily of former developers from Rare Limited. If Rare doesn’t ring any bells, their games probably will, from Donkey Kong Country to GoldenEye 007 to Perfect Dark. Most notably, perhaps, among the studio’s storied career—which dates back to the 80s—is Banjo-Kazooie.\n\nGet it? Banjo-Kazooie … Yooka-Laylee. Indeed, after being founded, Playtonic’s first act was to create a spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie—a game that harkens back to the 3D platformers of old.\n\nOriginally revealed as Project Ukulele, it wouldn’t be long until Yooka-Laylee was formally announced in 2015, along with a Kickstarter to help fund the development of the game. Showing just how gung-ho people were for a 3D platforming throw-back such as this, the campaign for Yooka-Laylee became one of the most successful video game Kickstarters ever. It blew past the original goal of £175,000 and came in just shy of £2,100,000.\n\nNeedless to say, the interest was there. After all, countless people—present company included—spent their childhood playing Donkey Kong Country and Banjo-Kazooie until they knew the inner workings of every level.\n\nSo, after much anticipation, Yooka-Laylee launched in 2017 to … relatively mixed reviews. All things considered, the general consensus was that the game nailed the look and feel of a classic 3D platform, like the ones Rare once made—but it was perhaps a bit too close to that original formula and felt a little dated as a result. Still, though, for anyone hankering for a new 3D platformer that felt like the ones you might’ve played when you were a kid, Yooka-Laylee had you covered.\n\nThe good news is that Playtonic followed up Yooka-Laylee a couple of years later in 2019 with a spin-off entitled Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair. This time around, the duo shed their fully 3D world for a 2.5D experience. In a sense, the game went from Banjo-Kazooie to Donkey Kong Country and was all the better for it, receiving an overall better reception.\n\nWhile Impossible Layer wasn’t technically a sequel, fret not, for Playtonic is working on a direct sequel to the first game. Although nothing has been revealed yet, considering that it’s been five years since their last game, one can only assume that Playtonic must be pretty far along with the sequel to Yooka-Laylee, which—we’re sorry to say—probably won’t be called Yooka-Tooie, as great as that would be.\n\nIn the five years since Impossible Layer came out, Playtonic has also begun publishing games under the moniker Playtonic Friends, so the studio is most definitely keeping busy. Let’s just hope they’ve been busy enough to release Yooka-Tooie sometime within the next year or so.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nCompiling a list of all the best indie game developers out there is always a difficult task; there are just so many, and the great ones all provide something unique and great to the gaming industry at large. While we painstakingly tried to pair it down to ten of our favorites, this list could have definitely kept going and going and going.\n\nIf reading this tickled your nostalgia bones in just the right way, then maybe tonight, you should bust open your favorite indie game—or one you’ve never played before—and immerse yourself in a great experience created by a relatively small number of people."
