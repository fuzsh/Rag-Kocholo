        "text": "Game Design students explore the entire game design pipeline, from concept to execution. Using both traditional drawing techniques and CGI tools, you’ll ideate and build both 2D and 3D assets to produce immersive gameplay experiences across mobile, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) platforms, as well as realistic environments and assets for game, film and animation.\n\nThrough sponsored projects with major companies that include Epic Games, Unity 3D and GM, you’ll gain valuable, direct experience with industry professionals.\n\nEA Game Design alumni work on major projects for the world’s top game studios, serving as character artists, environment and vehicle designers, technical and VFX artists, creative directors, and AR/VR developers, among many other creative roles.\n\nCCS’s use of cutting-edge platforms such as Unreal and Unity strengthen students’ skill sets for application not only to gaming but also to the automotive, film and television industries, and beyond."
