        "text": "Like the seemingly unending comic book movie craze, Hollywood loves to find a type of film that it can turn into the next big cultural touchstone. Over the years, we've seen movies based on video games attempt to reach that level, with varying levels of success. We've seen adaptations of games for decades, but, to be fair, a lot of these were awful adaptations. Many of them missed the point of the source material and were clumsily executed--although we'll always have a soft spot for the 1994 Street Fighter movie--but lately, we've seen some big changes in this genre.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie took the world by storm last year, earning an obscene amount of cash at the box office, while the Uncharted and both Sonic the Hedgehog movies were also successful. With fresh new IPs to option, dozens of video game movies have been announced over the last couple of years, and while production is moving swiftly on several of them, many more appear to be trapped in the lowest levels of development hell.\n\nWe're hopeful that we'll see some progress on these long-in-development films, but until Hollywood says otherwise, here's a deep dive into the video game movies that could be showing at your local cinema in the future. If there's not an attached release date or it's not a sequel, though, keep in mind these could also just never be made in the end.\n\nRelease date: August 9, 2024\n\nThe road to Pandora has been a long one, but at least 2024 will finally see the Borderlands movie land in theaters. Curiously, only a sparse number of details for the adaptation of the hit video game have been revealed in the years it has been in post-production, but what we do know is that it has a great cast attached to it. Directed by Eli Roth--and Deadpool director Tim Miller, who stepped in for reshoots--Borderlands stars Oscar-winner Cate Blanchett as Lilith, Ariana Greenblatt as Tiny Tina, Kevin Hart as Roland, Edgar Ramirez as Atlas, Jamie Lee Curtis as Patricia Tannis, and Florian Munteanu as Kreig. Jack Black is also in the film, lending his voice to the motor-mouthed service droid Claptrap.\n\nIf you've never picked any of the games, Borderlands is a popular looter-shooter set on an alien planet inhabited by bloodthirsty bandits, treasure-seeking Vault Hunters, and massive corporations given free reign to plunder the galaxy as they see fit.\n\nRelease date: December 20, 2024\n\nParamount's Sonic the Hedgehog movies have been a blast of fun--and horror--on the big screen, and with two films in the can, Sega's Blue Blur is getting ready for what could be the biggest race of his life. As part of Paramount's ambitious plans for a Sonic the Hedgehog cinematic universe, which will also include a Knuckles-centric TV show on Paramount+, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will once again be directed by Jeff Fowler and will reunite Sonic (Ben Schwartz) with Knuckles (Idris Elba) and Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey).\n\nOne big name missing from the cast? Jim Carrey, who played Sonic's greatest nemesis Dr. Robotnik in the first two films. Carrey has mentioned in previous interviews that he is retired from acting, so chances are slim that the egotistical scientist will be back to menace Sonic. But that might not be a bad thing, because as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 teased in its end credits, Sonic might have his work cut out for him when Shadow the Hedgehog eventually appears.\n\nComix Zone, a game for which advertisements were plastered over pretty much every Marvel and DC comic book in 1995, is another retro game property coming to the big screen eventually, maybe. First announced in 2022 and described as a loose adaptation of the game--which was inspired in turn by comic books of the era--the film will follow \"a jaded comic book creator and a writer who find themselves sucked into the final issue of his popular series and must fight their way out of the printed pages to stop a supervillain hellbent on destruction”. Written by Mae Catt (Young Justice), the film is also aiming to explore the power of storytelling.\n\nHideo Kojima's Death Stranding takes place in a fascinating universe, one where an extinction-level event has almost wiped out humanity and where being caught out in the rain is a painful death sentence. It's also weird as hell, packed with some very recognizable Hollywood faces, and it has no shortage of material to explore. The feature film adaptation was announced back in 2022, and in December 2023, film and television company A24 officially revealed its partnership with Kojima Productions to bring Death Stranding to life… or Death.\n\nKojima has big plans for this IP, as not only is he involved in the production of the Death Stranding movie, but he's also planning to create a Death Stranding film universe.\n\nBased on the 2022 horror game of the same name by David Szymanski, the adaptation of Iron Lung has already been written, directed, and produced by Mark Fischback AKA Markiplier, who's also starring in it. While it is complete, the movie doesn't have a release date yet, but the teaser trailer does look suitably bloody. If you've never played the game, Iron Lung is set in a universe where an event known as \"The Quiet Rapture\" has caused all known stars and habitable planets in the universe to vanish. After an ocean of blood is discovered on a lifeless moon, one convict is sent to explore the crimson waters from inside a rickety submarine.\n\nIf there's one thing that Hollywood has proven over the years, it's that anything can be a movie--even a collection of mobile apps featuring anthropomorphic animals talking back to you. The jury is still out on whether a good Talking Tom movie is possible, and to make things even weirder, this live-action project from Outfit7 has recruited Assassin's Creed producer Jean-Julien Baronnet to help it make the leap from mobile to big screen. Baronnet is also the producer of the Rabbids Invasion television series, so this looks like a good fit."
