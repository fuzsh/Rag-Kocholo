We particularly like to obsess about improvement and \"growth hacking\"​ our gameplay on competitive ladders. All of our lives, we have struggled with limited tools to acquire critical feedback. Although, most gamers still they could find an awesome mentor to talk to and personally coach; watching and learning has become a reality in the age of Twitch and replays. Video games are way ahead of other fields when it comes to providing users with data, but, we have realized that most people don’t have the time or the expertise to be able to bridge the information with their play. That’s where we come in. We take all that information out there (believe us, that’s a lot of it), and we funnel it through our intelligent algorithms and expert staff to be that bridge between you and the next level of your game. Our dream is to become the scientific standard for video game performance assessment and improvement and share that with the world so that everyone brings out their best self thereby elevating the level of competition on the playing field. TechCrunch loved us and we are well on our way to becoming an industry standard but at the end of the day we are a bunch of dudes who love to play games and talk about how awesome we and other players are at the game (mostly other players :S). If that sounds like you, join us and let's conquer performance assessment together.\n\neCommerce • Gaming\n\n<p>When we first started working on the Burstly toolset in early 2009 it was clear to us there was a huge need for developers to have complete control over their app business. And thats even more true today given some of the large shifts that have already taken place in the app ecosystem. While its still early in the mobile app market and we aren't satisfied yet, we're working with some really great partners and we've taken some great steps to empower developers. Today, Burstly helps app developers cross-promote their new apps and drive in app purchases, work with a ton of 3rd party monetization partners, as well as enable them to create direct sales relationships. The toolset works across multiple products including custom badges and buttons, display ads, and in-game rewards.</p>"
