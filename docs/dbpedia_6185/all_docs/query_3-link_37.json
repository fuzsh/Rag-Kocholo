        "text": "After years of waiting, Forza Motorsport is just weeks away from launch. We've known that developer Take 10 has been hard at work on this new generation of high-speed racing games for three years now, and featuring hundreds of vehicles, an upgraded physics system, and greater visual fidelity than anything we've seen before, Motorsport looks set to stun.\n\nIt's one of our top new games for 2023 to keep an eye out for, and being a first-party title form Xbox Game Studios, we have high hopes for it to join the ranks of the best Xbox Series X games out there. Here's everything you need to know about Forza Motorsport 2023, from a release date to gameplay details, mechanics, and more.\n\nForza Motorsport news\n\nForza Motorsport revolutionizes its use of machine learning to craft its most realistic racing competition yet\n\nThe Forza Motorsport release date has been confirmed for October 10, 2023. Turn 10 has confirmed that the new Forza will be coming to Xbox Series X and PC, and that it'll be a day one entry into Xbox Game Pass.\n\nForza Motorsport gameplay\n\nForza Motorsport gameplay is going to be a big update on what came before. While the game is set to be another simulation-leaning, serious racing experience like its predecessors, this 2023 release has an even more detailed simulation engine. Each tyre's physics will be sampled at six points instead of one, and with eight times the number of samples per second, making for a 48x improvement in the fidelity of the physics calculations per tyre over Forza Motorsport 7. New gameplay additions include selectable tyre compounds, tyre and fuel management, and 'car-building' which suggests deeply customizable mechanical modding.\n\nMultiplayer will receive an overhaul too, now with full free-practice sessions and qualifying available along with fuel strategy options for those who want a deeper experience, with real calendar-based race times, similar to Sony's Gran Turismo 7. There has also been official mention of 'all-new, different modes of game', though these are under wraps at present.\n\nForza Motorsport Developer Direct\n\nDuring the Xbox Developer Direct in January 2023, the Turn 10 Studios development team gave us a closer look at Forza Motorsport and the tech that's bringing it to life to make it look, sound, and feel real. Creative director Chris Esaki opened the showcase by stating that Forza Motorsport has been \"built from the ground up\" to take advantage of the Xbox Series X, and claimed it is the \"most technically advanced racing game ever made.\"\n\nAs well as going into detail about features such as ray-tracing and customization, we also got to hear about sound design, how it renders at 4K at 60fps, and more. It certainly looks and sounds impressive from what we saw in the teaser, and most excitingly the studio says that Forza Motorsport it's the most comprehensive game in the series so far, which promises to have better tech advancements than Forza Motorsport 5, 6, and 7 combined.\n\nForza Motorsport confirmed tracks\n\nEvery Forza Motorsport track will be built afresh 'for the new generation'. Long-time fan favourite Maple Valley Raceway was shown during the showcase, now with luscious detail in the surrounding countryside that you might not even notice during normal gameplay. But this world-building is one of the new game's big steps forward, with new procedural generation techniques for populating the trackside scenery, and full dynamic time of day effects. These will be available for every single track in the game, and fully adjustable in terms of how fast time passes.\n\nAccurate sun position, track temperatures and ambient temperatures will affect your grip, as well as new dynamic 'rubbering in' of the racing line, and of course weather. Other series favourite tracks include freshly laser-scanned WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca and Circuit de Spa Francorchamps, but two new circuits were shown too â€“ South Africa's Kyalami (a former F1 circuit) and the fictional, high-speed GP style course, Circuit Hakone, set in Japan near Mount Fuji. Further all-new tracks will be announced closer to launch.\n\nForza Motorsport cars\n\nAn official list will be announced at a later date, though we know of 37 Forza Motorsport cars thus far. The main star of the showcase was the BMW M8 GTE, adorned with 'Mission-8' livery. New cars spotted so far include the Nissan 370Z Nismo, the Audi RS E-Tron GT, and Brabham's BT62 hypercar. Other returning cars include the 2019 McLaren Senna GTR, the 2020 Lamborghini Huracan EVO, and the gorgeous 1966 McLaren M2B. Ferrari, Mercedes, Audi, Aston Martin, Chevrolet, and Porsche are standouts among the other marques shown so far, and we were also treated to a close-up of the legendary 1991 Le Mans-winning Mazda 787B. It has been confirmed that the focus will be on modern cars and motorsport, and that selection shown so far should give you a good indication of what to expect from the game.\n\nForza Motorsport damage modelling explained\n\nOne area that was shown off in detail is the revised Forza Motorsport damage system. Naturally, in a game full of licensed cars, you're not going to see Burnout or Wreckfest levels of automotive destruction. But car bodywork clearly dents to a modest degree and scratches up during collisions, particularly around the edges of metal elements, including abrasions on the spokes of alloy wheels. However, when presented with an opportunity to talk about how damage and dirt affects the car in more ways than aesthetics, the game's Creative Director, Chris Esaki, dodged the question and talked about how 'the story of the car' is told through its scars, so there probably won't be mechanical damage in Forza Motorsport.\n\nForza Motorsport ray tracing\n\nTurn 10's GM Dan Greenawalt confirmed that ray-tracing will be applied to all scenes of Forza Motorsport, including real-time, on-track gameplay. That's an impressive feat given Gran Turismo 7 on PS5 only lets you use it in replays and showroom scenes, and even then at a reduced frame-rate. With Forza Motorsport ray tracing, you can see cars reflected in other cars' bodywork, themselves exhibiting spot highlights from the twice-reflected sun. There will even be globally-illuminated ray-traced lighting available for non-gameplay scenes, which should be spectacular."
