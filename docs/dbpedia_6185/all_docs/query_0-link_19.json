At the beginning of every month we'll be rounding up the big news stories and game releases from the month just gone and popping them in a blog post for you to read over a coffee. We're calling it 'Portal's Month in Games' and this first edition is packed with info including: The great Xbox leak. It feels like an age ago now but this really did happen in September. There's news of an all-digital Xbox Series X, a new controller and maybe even a next-gen console in 2028. Unity successfully uniting all developers in opposition to their proposed Runtime Fee. It's been partially walked back, but will that be enough to restore trust between devs and the engine maker? Industry layoffs. Sadly, the industry has been hit by a wave of redundancies with Mediatonic Games, Ubisoft London and Creative Assembly all impacted. Our article includes links to various online resources which may be useful to anyone who has been affected. Read the full article via the link below and give us your thoughts in the comments. https://lnkd.in/ekacK2-S #gamesindustry #gamesnews\n\nShould Slay The Spire 2 be a commercial and critical success (which I dearly hope will be), I think it will be a historic moment for the game industry. While there are already games made with Godot that have enjoyed commercial and critical success, they have always been relatively unknown. Developers are obviously afraid to commit to a new engine, since the amount of knowledge from the previous engine could be effectively lost when transitioning. After Unity's massive PR mismanagement last year, many developers lost confidence in their integrity, but it wasn't enough to make people shift to a new engine entirely because Godot doesn't have a big flagship title that shows off its technical capabilities. Should Slay the Spire 2 be critically and commercially successful (essentially becoming what Hyper Light Drifter was for GameMaker) it would be a clear sign that the engine does have promise. And since it is open source, it would be the perfect fit for studios that don't want their subscription money going to corporate overlords rather than being reinvested in the engine. Couple this with the industry-wide developer layoffs since last year, and we might be poised for a new indie renaissance in the future, which is quite exciting! (unless you are Unity, I suppose...)\n\n🚀 Latest Gaming News Update! 🚀 Microsoft is closing several Bethesda Game Studios Studios, including Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Tango GameWorks. Some employees are being reassigned, but details on layoffs are unclear. Redfall had a troubled launch, and Tango GameWorks’ closure is surprising given the success of Hi-Fi Rush. Nintendo plans to release the next Switch by March 2025, with no announcements expected at the June Direct. Meanwhile, Hades 2 is in early access on PC and has already surpassed the original game's player count.
