        "text": "TL;DR With over 15 years in the video game industry, I can tell you: there are no jobs for idea people. Ideas are not valued as much as ability to execute and perform. Your best best: go to school and get a game design or software engineering degree (with a focus on gameplay programming if possible), or learn enough programming to do everything yourself (except art, almost everyone outsources art). There's tons of opportunity, with free or cheap online classes, stuff you needed to commit a four year program to access just a decade ago. There are tons of tools, including incredible game engines that would have cost thousands to license just a decade ago. With little to no programming skill, you can get your ideas made on your own, or at least with minimal assistance. That is how you best show your ideas have value.\n\nIdea people are only team members with the power and/or respect to have their ideas listened to. The \"easiest\" way to get there without design or programming skill is get loads of money to start your own company. This is also the easiest way to lose loads of money and make a name that no one wants to work with. Of course, this is actually only easy for people born into loads of money. Also, making people do your ideas instead of theirs is a great way to get people to never want to work with you again.\n\nSo, you don't have money or family to force doors open for you, then what?\n\nWell, get honest with yourself. What do you really want out of being \"the one with ideas\"? Is it fame, like Sid Meier, having your name in the title? Is it power, being able to tell people how to make the game of your dreams? Is it money, to make millions from your ideas and you live a life of luxury? Or is it something that's hard to name other than \"fun,\" you simply want to make games because you love games and a creative passion to make them for others to enjoy?\n\nOf those, only the last one is a good reason to get into the game industry. You will find more fame pursuing front-of-camera entertainment, like acting, politics (at least if you're American), or \"content creator.\" You'll find more power pursuing business, a legal career, or politics. You'll find more money in every single tech industry that's not games, also politics (if you have no morals).\n\nReal talk: your passion is real and powerful and important. Also, nearly everyone in games has that same passion (or at least they did when they started). Your ideas are real and have immense potential. Also, almost every one in games has hundreds of ideas they want to make, too. Passion and ideas are not enough. They are not valuable. You also cannot thrive by making your passion or your ideas more important than everyone else you work with (unless you have the money, power, or fame to get away with it, even then, that rarely goes well for long).\n\nOne path (my path as example) is to get your foot in the door, tester most likely. Then beat the odds and make full time. Then get into production, likely as an associate or line producer. From there, you can leverage your experience to do more design tasks, but you're already in the room hearing ideas. Whether you are welcome to contribute significantly will vary widely from team to team and company to company.\n\nThis was me. I did great, even found a niche in narrative design. I wrote scripts for games, including big hitters like Disney and EA! Even then, I wasn't \"the one with ideas.\" Much of the gameplay and locations had been decided. I mostly connected existing ideas. And due to experience and connections, I finally made my dream as Creative Director for a startup publisher after 13 years. I was the guiding force for all our projects. Despite being \"the one with ideas,\" I couldn't responsibly force others to take them. My team also had ideas, and I wanted their ideas heard. This was good otherwise they never would have hired me despite our history together. Our partners also had ideas, and we all wanted to respect our partners. My job was mostly: suggest, massage, collect, and collaborate.\n\nAlso: I couldn't code. So my ideas were always translated by someone else, usually lots of someones. I performed well and all my coworkers liked my work, but I was deeply dissatisfied that I couldn't make my ideas happen. I couldn't show anyone what those ideas were; only tell; only explain. When the company folded in less than two years (due to financials mishandled by our parent company, not because of our work; this is extremely common) I went back to school to learn programming. It's never too late. But then that changed my life. I also discovered a whole work world of competent people managers, with work-life balance and 2x pay rates unheard of in games. So, I haven't gone back to games and now I have skills valuable outside of games. Honestly, some fair amount of burn out watching people chase money over fun has been a big factor in not rushing back.\n\nIn my day, testers were rarely outsourced, so it was an easier way in. These days, the way in is more likely with a degree in programming or design, or a portfolio that communicates accomplishment with making your ideas reality. A good intern program at a school is super helpful, too. Without at least some of that, its unlikely you'd get hired at all. On the other hand, it's also much easier for a single person to make and publish a multi-platform game these days. So really ask yourself, is your goal to work at a big company or to make your ideas into games? It feels good the first few times, your name buried in the credits. It's real magic when you're on a small team, but riskier with less pay. By yourself (maybe a partner or two for coding help and/or art at some point), you get almost complete freedom for almost no pay.\n\nPerhaps the best way to become an idea person these days is to learn programming and/or design (most artists are not as highly valued) and put out games with any of the free-to-use/easy-to-develop game engines. When its just you, you're automatically the idea person. You have to be, which can be a drawback with so much pressure and so little certainty.\n\nIf you are extremely lucky, you could have a multi-million dollar hit and your pick of jobs. Congratulations, you're \"the one with an idea\" that made millions, more importantly, you're a game designer with a proven hit. You probably won't be the idea person, not with only one hit, but a few years more hard work anywhere might get you into that position.\n\nIf you are just lucky, you make a game that pays the bills. Congratulations, you're still an idea person. More importantly, you're a game designer that doesn't have to worry about food (at least for however long that game can pay your bills). This could get you a job, probably low to mid level, so you won't be \"the one with ideas\" for a while. Maybe you could find a niche quickly, like narrative or UI/UX and command ideas with a limited scope from there.\n\nAgain, those are very rare. Most likely, you'll have learned valuable skills that will let you get better on the next project. This can be true even you publish and no one ever buys it. This can be true even if you give up on the project entirely! This won't likely get you a job on its own, but it makes a good portfolio addition.\n\nStill, even being extremely lucky, a massive company like Ubisoft is not likely to hire you for your ideas. They might want you for your experience and skill, but not your ideas. If your game was a big enough hit, with continued profits (aka monetization), someone might offer to buy you out and then you could negotiate a directorship. Maybe. Most likely, you just have a better resume than most can hope for. Your best path would be to invest in what is now your own company, and keep putting out the hits. Which is still extremely difficult, even if its just sequels. But it ensures you remain the one with \"ideas.\"\n\nIf that does work, then with a proven track record, you'll almost certainly enjoy the freedom of running your own studio (or at least being creative director with trusted colleagues running the business) rather than join a big company. The path there is having your studio acquired a big company, who already have their ideas and franchises. You will at best be a creative director, maybe a studio head, both of whom is more of an idea collector than the sole idea generator. But at this point, most who sell do it for the money, or to get away from the \"hit franchise\" and do something they can't do because their studio is too big to risk it, or just retire. A company I worked for sold because our skills, not IP or ideas, were valuable, especially the 12 of us bundled. The founders sold because, despite continued popular titles, they would have run out of funds in a year. It was way cheaper to buy us than head-hunt for 12 people with our skills.\n\nSid Meier, probably the industry's first famous and most well known \"idea guy\" got his start in 1981, already with a background in non-game programming (which was the only kind, really). He co-founded MicroProse in 1982. His name was made by putting out solid titles, all flight sims. Even then, it wasn't until Robin Williams (yes, that one! he was a huge gamer since early days and attended the tiny software conferences popping up in California) told Bill Stealey, the CEO and other co-founder, that Sid's name meant something, they should promote him like a star. They did on Sid Meier's Pirates!, because it was thought that Sid's flight sim fans would try this game, instead of ignoring it for the different genre it was. They were correct and Sid Meier's Civilization came shortly after.\n\nThis is back when computer games was barely a $1 million industry, not the $1 billion industry it is today. No celebrity comedians are going to make you an idea generator (certainly not without a string of titles under your belt). It was easier in the 80s and 90s because no one cared. Now video games are market movers. Everyone cares.\n\nIf I show that my ideas can bring in a steady stream of profit, will big game companies like Ubisoft hire me and give me a team to develop them?\n\nAbsolutely! But, how do you prove that without a studio or skills in programming and design and a proven track record?\n\n2nd TL;DR: In order to prove your ideas are worthy of a company like Ubisoft, you have to have published successful games! It's a huge gamble to do it on your own, but that way you can be the one with \"ideas\" from day 1. Otherwise, get training and degrees to get hired, and you might be able to get there in a decade or two, if you don't burn out before then. Although the big companies do often grind people down, any creative work for extended periods runs a risk of burnout. Being the person putting ideas out there means putting your heart out there, and that means anyone can poke it and stab it for any reason at all. Forget ideas, forget company names, forget titles. Focus on the core of your passion. Think small. Make a game for a loved one. For yourself. Do the other stuff to make a living, to make a name, to get a job with Ubisoft, whatever sounds great, but you definitely don't need Ubisoft, or any other company, to make you happy.\n\nPS Oh right, and Sid these days? He basically manages Firaxis now, enabling others to bring their ideas together. He can't even get his big ideas made. His stated passion is a dinosaur game, publicly announced in 2001 and publicly shelved in 2005. They're just \"too busy\" making games based on others' ideas to make his idea. So, in the end, even \"the one with ideas\" isn't free."
