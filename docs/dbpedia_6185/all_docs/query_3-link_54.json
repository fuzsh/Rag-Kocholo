        "text": "Super Mario Bros. Wonder\n\nDeveloped By: Nintendo\n\nDirected By: Shiro Mouri\n\nPlatforms: Nintendo Switch\n\nRelease Date: October 20, 2023\n\nThe latest addition to the Mario franchise, Super Mario Bros.

Whether you’re a die-hard fan of the series or a newcomer to the world of Mario, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is sure to leave a lasting impression on you.\n\nSea of Stars\n\nDeveloped By: Sabotage Studio\n\nDirected By: Thierry Boulanger\n\nPlatforms: Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4|5, Xbox Consoles\n\nRelease Date: August 29, 2023\n\nBeginning life as a Kickstarter project (meant to serve as a follow-up to The Messenger), Sea of Stars absolutely swept gamers off their feet. This indie darling managed to recreate the feel of those retro RPGs from days of gaming’s yore while refining the mechanics and giving players a compelling new story to enjoy.\n\nFinal Fantasy XVI – Composer Masayoshi Soken\n\nDeveloped By: Square Enix\n\nDirected By: Hiroshi Takai, Kazutoyo Maehiro\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 5, Windows\n\nRelease Date: June 22, 2023\n\nNo Final Fantasy game is complete without a great soundtrack to go with it (at least no good Final Fantasy game), and FF XVI is no different. Masayoshi Soken’s impressive score not only spotlighted the emotional beats throughout the story, but made each enemy encounter feel suitably epic, no matter how big or small. Even the quieter moments back at base were filled with a serene melody that gave players the respite needed from the action.\n\nHi-Fi Rush – Lead Art Director Keita Sakai\n\nDeveloped By: Tango Gameworks, Bethesda Softworks\n\nDirected By: John Johanas\n\nPlatforms: Xbox Series X|S, Windows\n\nRelease Date: January 25, 2023\n\nTango Gameworks demonstrated a clear understanding of their objectives when they developed Hi-Fi Rush. The game’s design was intended to encapsulate the dynamic action and culture of anime and gaming. With careful attention to detail, the developers incorporated numerous Easter eggs, anime references, and elements that resonate with the gaming community. Hi-Fi Rush is an exceptional game that delivers hours of entertainment. We extend our gratitude to Tango Gameworks for their ingenuity and for creating a masterpiece that ranks among the best games available on Xbox GamePass.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\n\nDeveloped By: Respawn Entertainment\n\nDirected By: Stig Asmussen\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Windows\n\nRelease Date: April 28, 2023\n\nWhere Fallen Order helped establish new characters and set the path for this type of action game in the galaxy far, far away, Survivor blew the doors off and came out swinging confidently. From the refined mechanics, impressive visuals, and expanded story everything about Survivor is a gigantic leap forward. The new, streamlined, features made exploration a ton of fun, encouraging players to return for more even after they’d left an area. Most of all, it left us eager for more, in the best way possible.\n\nStarfield\n\nDeveloped By: Bethesda Game Studios\n\nDirected By: Todd Howard\n\nPlatforms: Xbox Series X|S, Windows\n\nRelease Date: September 6, 2023\n\nStarfield is an incredibly vast and immersive game that offers players a truly unforgettable experience.

The story is equally impressive, with a compelling narrative that draws players in and keeps them on the edge of their seats. Whether you’re a seasoned gamer or new to the world of gaming, Starfield is a must-play title that is sure to leave a lasting impression.\n\nDune: Spice Wars\n\nDeveloped By: Shiro Games\n\nDirected By: Sebastián Vidal\n\nPlatforms: Xbox Series X|S, Windows\n\nRelease Date: September 14, 2023 (Full Release)\n\nEven in its Early Access state, it was clear there was something special about Dune: Spice Wars. The full release manages to fulfill all of the potential we saw in the previous year and deliver a compelling strategy game within this iconic universe. Considering Dune II essentially created the modern RTS genre as we know it, there was obviously a lot of legacy to live up to. Not only does it exceed those expectations, but the deft inclusions of the 4X Grand Strategy elements helps set a new standard for the genre as well.\n\nDead Space (2023)\n\nDeveloped By: Motive Studio\n\nDirected By: Roman Campos-Oriola, Eric Baptizat\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Windows\n\nRelease Date: January 27, 2023\n\nMotive Studios was faced with an intimidating task when taking on the Dead Space remake project – to recreate the same level of fear and terror that the original game had instilled in its players. Nevertheless, through meticulous planning and careful execution, it is evident that Motive and EA were able to take on this challenge head to head. The result is a game that is not only true to the original in terms of its gameplay and storyline but also manages to surpass it in terms of its graphics, sound design, and overall immersive experience. The Dead Space remake is a testament to the dedication and talent of the team at Motive Studios, who have managed to breathe new life into a classic horror game while retaining its core essence.\n\nForza Motorsport\n\nDeveloped By: Turn 10 Studios\n\nDirected By: Chris Esaki\n\nPlatforms: Xbox Series X|S, Windows\n\nRelease Date: October 10, 2023\n\nTurn 10 has crafted an extraordinary game with Forza Motorsport. As someone who used to play a lot of racing games in my younger years, I found myself losing interest in them over time due to their lack of excitement. However, Forza Motorsport is different. It’s not just another racing simulator or arcade game; it’s a revolutionary racing title that immerses you in the experience of real-life racing. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the meticulously crafted tracks to the lifelike opposing racers, and the stunning locations that make you feel like you’re really there. With Forza Motorsport, you’re not just playing a game; you’re living the racing experience.\n\nDiablo IV\n\nDeveloped By: Blizzard Team 3, Blizzard Albany\n\nDirected By: Joe Shely, Sebastian Stepien, Luis Barriga\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 4|5, Xbox Series Consoles, Windows\n\nRelease Date: June 5, 2023\n\nBy all accounts, there’s no reason Diablo IV should be as addictive as it is…and yet, it’s nearly impossible to stop playing. Blizzard proved they still had the goods when it comes to this franchise, proving the long wait was definitely worth while. While being set in an always online “world” had some drawbacks, it also made playing with friends, or crawling through dungeons with total strangers, a blast.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder\n\nDeveloped By: Nintendo\n\nDirected By: Shiro Mouri\n\nPlatforms: Nintendo Switch\n\nRelease Date: October 20, 2023\n\nCan you believe it? One game has won not one, but two awards! And it’s no surprise, really, given the sheer brilliance of Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The game is an absolute masterpiece in terms of creativity and innovation, which undoubtedly earned it the Best Game Direction Award. But that’s not all – it’s also an incredibly fun and engaging game to play with family or friends. Whether you’re a full time gamer or a complete novice, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is sure to bring out the child in you with its magical, family friendly world.\n\nStreet Fighter 6\n\nDeveloped By: Capcom\n\nDirected By: Takayuki Nakayama\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 4|5, Xbox Series Consoles, Windows\n\nRelease Date: June 2, 2023\n\nAs highlighted in our review, Street Fighter 6 is a game that has undergone a complete transformation from its predecessors. The developers have left no stone unturned in bringing a fresh and engaging experience to the players. Every aspect of the game, from its various modes that offer diverse gameplay experiences, to its improved gameplay mechanics, and stunning graphical upgrades, presents an unparalleled gaming experience. The musical score, environmental design, cutscenes, and other in-game features have been crafted with meticulous attention to detail, resulting in a game that is nothing short of astounding. Capcom’s exceptional achievement in elevating an already successful game franchise to new heights is truly commendable.\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man 2\n\nDeveloped By: Insomniac Games\n\nDirected By: Bryan Inthihar, Ryan Smith\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 5\n\nRelease Date: October 20, 2023\n\nInsomniac Games has truly raised the bar in the gaming industry with their exceptional titles over the past few years.
