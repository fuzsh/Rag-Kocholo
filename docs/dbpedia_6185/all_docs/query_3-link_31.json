        "text": "Tapping into passionate fans and younger generations\n\nCentral to many of these successes are the fandoms that have grown around these stories, characters, and the worlds they exist within. Fans and fan communities make these stories more durable by sharing their passions with each other, welcoming new chapters and spin-offs, and following them across TV and film, gaming, and social media, and out into the physical world of merchandise and live experiences. Continuously renewing and stoking the passion of fans has helped successful franchises to span decades and generations, but it has often required innovation and a willingness to evolve and engage with old and new fans alike.\n\nIndeed, the rising importance of video games is being driven by generational shifts in media and entertainment behaviors. Millennials and Generation Z are less enthralled by TV and film and are just as likely to give their entertainment time to social media and video games.14 They expect to engage with content, creators, celebrities, and stories across all these channels. Among them, gamers can be highly engaged, with many giving 60-100 hours or more to vast narrative games that can cost over US$200 million to produce.15 Players can embark upon the hero’s journey and work to build relationships with game characters, overcome challenges, and ultimately save the world. Done well, such gameworlds develop strong fandoms that feel like they’re both a part of the story and the franchise. Similarly, live game services drive strong engagement and retention through social bonds, multiplayer competition, and in-game economies.16\n\nA passionate fanbase can also make it easier for franchises to expand into new media—if franchises stay true to the core values and uniqueness that make a franchise compelling. Some metrics show that most core fans would rather engage with a new installment of their favorite franchise than something new and they are more likely to buy products related to the franchise.17 However, fan communities are often empowered to voice their opinions and expectations and will likely hold studios to account if they veer too far from the canon. At the same time, more decision makers in media have now grown up with popular gaming franchises as a part of their lives.18 They may be more attuned to the expectations of fans, with a better sense of where the franchise should honor its core value and where it can stretch and evolve without disrupting its value.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nGames not only have IP that can help fuel TV and film but they can also offer strong fandoms that can be tapped into for more engagement and monetization. But studios should be careful to honor the core principles that make a story universe unique and compelling, not only to fans but to new audiences as well. Likewise, studios may be drawn to gaming as a way to expand but they should carefully consider the challenges of doing so, while honoring fans and building relationships with game studios. They should understand, however, that it may be harder to make games from movies than it is to make movies from games. Ultimately, adapting to the media behaviors of younger generations could mean that TV and film studios may have little choice but to enter gaming.\n\nCritically, innovations in technology are likely making it easier to develop IP strategies that move across these media. As Deloitte noted in our 2023 TMT Predictions, virtual production tools are bringing game engines into the center of production, able to generate and deliver assets directly to TV screens, cinemas, and gameworlds.19 This can not only make it easier to develop IP for both games and video but could also enable a new platform for cross-media storytelling. However, TV and film studios may face challenges in adopting virtual production tools and hiring the talent needed to make the tools perform, and in crossing the gap from making great TV and movies to developing compelling video games.\n\nMore relationships can help: Game companies are likely well-versed in developing 3D content and experiences and may already have talent working in the game engines that power virtual production. Successful game adaptations of cinematic universes may benefit from collaborations with independent game studios to develop them. Conversely, film and TV can offer game companies ways to expand their IP into additional revenue streams while potentially driving interest and engagement back to their games. Some of the most successful video properties based on games have made a point of speaking directly to core fans.20\n\nFilm and TV studios offer expertise in storytelling, cinematic experiences, and reaching and engaging audiences. Such relationships could be key to driving down exorbitant production costs—the biggest summer theatrical blockbusters and the largest AAA games can cost US$300 million or more to develop and market.21 More strategic coordination could, for example, centralize digital assets and production tools that can then make it easier to develop different stories and experiences within a story universe. Combining such production optimizations and strategic planning with strong audience data could further derisk decisions about content, casting, and distribution.\n\nRelationships and production tools can make it easier to deploy stories to different media, but the unique value of the stories themselves and the fans that cherish them are often still the core strength of a studio. The fandoms that grow around a franchise and help sustain it are frequently drawn by something unique and meaningful about those stories, characters, and worlds. Studios across media should focus on and reinforce what makes them unique and meaningful, then clearly articulate this through all channels. Studios can more easily change the storylines and main characters, and move between games, TV, and film, if the core value is truly represented in each instance. This can enable flexibility to feed fans, reach new audiences, and deliver novel experiences to younger generations, while still staying true to what makes the franchise great."
