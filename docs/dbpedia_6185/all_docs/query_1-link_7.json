        "text": "You know the saying, “money makes the world go round.” In the gaming industry, it takes considerable funds to produce world-class games.\n\nOne of the most preliminary stages of game development is to acquire funds to build a video game. Some gaming studios under independent direction may have funds from previous projects and/or crowdfunds to build their own games, but that’s not the case for many studios in today’s competitive industry.\n\nWhen gaming studios are strapped for cash or on tight budgets, they may need to approach a publisher with their concept and framework for a game.\n\nWhat is a video game publisher?\n\nA video game publisher is a company that finances the design, development, marketing, and distribution of a video game. It is common for gaming studios to work under the umbrella of a video game publisher, although it is not required.\n\nOnce a proof of concept is approved by a publisher, the production of a video game can proceed. In this report, we’re going to profile 13 of today’s most prominent video game publishers.\n\nJump ahead to:\n\nSee also:\n\nVideo game publishers today\n\nVideo game publishers can be found all across the world, each with its own culture and preferences. For example, some publishers exclusively publish role-playing games (RPGs) while others prefer to publish first-person shooters (FPS).\n\nPublishers also have their own styles of governing projects – this becomes extremely important for gaming studios during the production cycle. For example, some publishers are notorious micromanagers and require check-ins after every milestone. These publishers may also restrict creative freedom for studios and even decide that key features need to be scrapped after months of development.\n\nMore lenient publishers could provide complete creative freedom to studios. The downside to this is less structure, leaving the studio and its project leads completely accountable for meeting deadlines and ultimately the launch date. Either way, it’s up to the studio to decide how much involvement they’d like from a publisher and whether or not it’s worth the boost in budget.\n\nProminent video game publishers\n\nNow that you’re aware of the role publishers play in video game development, it’s time to look at specific publishers, where they’re located, their revenue, subsidiaries, and some notable games published under their umbrellas.\n\nTencent Games\n\nTencent is a Chinese multinational conglomerate holding company founded in 1998. While Tencent focuses on many areas of information technology – like search engines, social networking, music, e-commerce, and even artificial intelligence – it still reigns as the world’s largest video game publishing company.\n\nWhat does Tencent Games own or have a partial stake in?\n\nGrinding Gear Games\n\nMiniclip\n\nRiot Games\n\nGlu Mobile\n\nBluehole\n\nEpic Games\n\nActivision Blizzard\n\nUbisoft\n\nParadox Entertainment\n\nSupercell\n\nNotable Tencent games\n\nLeague of Legends\n\nClash of Clans\n\nPUBG\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\nSony is a Japanese multinational conglomerate corporation founded in 1946.

Both Activision and Blizzard have had previous successes before the merger, however, Vivendi decided the merger would make the most sense for having a stronghold on the MMORPG market. Activision Blizzard, located in California, produces and publishes some of the world’s most popular video games.\n\nWhat does Activision Blizzard own or have a partial stake in?\n\nInfinity Ward\n\nTreyarch\n\nSledgehammer Games\n\nRaven Software\n\nBeenox\n\nDemonware\n\nKing Digital Entertainment\n\nMajor League Gaming, the leading Esports organization\n\nHigh Moon Studios\n\nVicarious Visions\n\nNotable Activision Blizzard games\n\nWorld of Warcraft\n\nCall of Duty\n\nDiablo\n\nElectronic Arts (EA)\n\nElectronic Arts, popularly known as EA, is an American video game corporation founded in 1982.

Like Konami, Sega’s early days were focused on arcade machines, but this quickly changed with the rise of consoles. The Sega Genesis and Dreamcast consoles, however, have greatly struggled compared to its competition. Now, Sega’s focus is mainly on developing its intellectual properties.\n\nWhat does Sega own or have a partial stake in?\n\nAmplitude Studios\n\nAtlus\n\nCreative Assembly\n\nDemiurge Studios\n\nHardlight\n\nRelic Entertainment\n\nSports Interactive\n\nTwo Point Studios\n\nNotable Sega games\n\nSonic The Hedgehog\n\nYakuza\n\nTotal War\n\nCapcom\n\nCapcom is a Japanese video game producer and publisher founded in 1979.

Here are the most recent reported revenues compiled by Newzoo:\n\nTencent Games is routinely the highest-grossing publisher with $19.773 billion in revenue in 2018 alone. With a portfolio of stakes in other publishing companies, this comes as no surprise.\n\nMetacritic of video game publishers\n\nMetacritic is one of the world’s most popular video game and publisher review sites on the Web. Essentially, Metacritic aggregates reviews across many sources to produce satisfaction scores. For example, a Metascore (the purple bar) is a weighted average based on the relevance of a publication or video game critic. More in-depth, high-quality reviews are more important to the score compared to vague, low-quality reviews.\n\nTotal Metacritic points (the green bar) is determined by adding up factors such as Metascore, percentage of “good” games, percentage of “bad” games, and percentage of “great” games – each factor weighted accordingly.\n\nHere are the most recent scores compiled by Metacritic:\n\nPublishers with high Metascores and total Metacritic points typically release high-quality video games, according to user reviews. Interestingly enough, Capcom and Sega, which were near the bottom of total revenue, have the highest scores. This shows us that money doesn’t always equate to quality.\n\nNote: Tencent Games wasn’t listed on Metacritic’s latest roundup of publisher rankings.\n\nReady to learn more about gaming?"
