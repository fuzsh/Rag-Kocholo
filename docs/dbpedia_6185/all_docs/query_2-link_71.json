        "text": "Launched on October 10, Forza Motorsport is a reboot for the sub-series in the Forza franchise and the first Motorsport release since 2017’s Forza Motorsport 7. The game received positive reviews from critics, with an average Metascore of 85 (Xbox Series X|S) and 84 (PC).\n\nPlayer reception, however, hasn’t been warm so far. According to SteamDB, Forza Motorsport only peaked at 4,703 concurrent users (CCU).\n\nFor comparison, Forza Horizon 4 and 5, also available on Steam, had a peak CCU of 40.3k and 81k respectively. Of course, the Horizon brand is more causal and aimed at a wider audience, but the initial metrics for Forza Motorsport are still pretty weak for a big AAA release.\n\nConcurrent player count for Forza games on Steam\n\nAt the moment of writing, the latest game from Turn 10 Studios has a “Mixed” rating on Steam, with only 43% of the 975 user reviews being positive. On the US Xbox Store, the game currently holds an average score of 2.5 stars out of 5 based on 869 reviews.\n\nMany players criticized the car leveling system, comparing it to grind typical for free-to-play mobile titles. When it comes to the PC version, it seems to be poorly optimized with numerous performance issues. “Changing settings requires restarts. On each restart the game recompiles shaders for 5 minutes. I’ve had about 20-30 crashes in 35 hours and 2 BSOD,” one user wrote."
