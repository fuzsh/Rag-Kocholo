Make sure that prospective employers can try out your work by ensuring the demo can be downloaded or if this isn't possible, have some video footage of the game in action available.\n\nTake advantage of any studio visits, field trips or work experience as part of your course to develop your skills and build up a network of industry contacts. Look out for opportunities to test games before they go on the market as this can help you get a foot in the door.\n\nEmployers value the ability to work in a team as well as independently. Taking part in game jams will provide the chance for you to develop your teamworking skills as you design big game projects online. This experience will also help you to develop your social network, project management and problem-solving skills.\n\nAny experience or volunteer work gathered in a creative, design or interactive role will improve your chances of getting into games design. Options include work with a web design company, design agency, advertising agency or multimedia development firm.\n\nSearch for placements and find out more about work experience and internships.\n\nTypical employers\n\nThere are almost 2,300 UK-based gaming design studios. These range in size from small independent studios to multinational games producers and overseas games companies with headquarters in the UK. International opportunities are available if you're prepared to travel.\n\nGames design is a fast-growing sector and there are some opportunities emerging in areas such as business, education and healthcare as more companies and sectors begin to find uses for in-app or online games. Employers include advertising and broadcasting companies, creative agencies, and PR and communications firms.\n\nEmployment in this field is competitive and relies to some extent on personal contacts and recommendations, so be prepared to network.\n\nFind information on employers in information technology, media and internet, creative arts and design, and other job sectors.\n\nSkills for your CV\n\nAs a games design student you learn how to design, document and communicate your design ideas and turn them into finished games. You can apply your game design skills to a range of design challenges, both within the games industry and in other industries where these skills are desirable.\n\nYou also gain a range of transferable skills valued by employers. These include:\n\nteamworking and communication - from collaborating with teams consisting of developers, programmers and artists and forming good working relationships at all levels\n\ntechnical ability - as you become familiar with a range of programming languages and software packages\n\norganisational skills - for effective workload management and meeting deadlines\n\npresentation skills - to present your ideas to others in a way that is easy to understand\n\ncommercial and sector awareness - of what makes a game popular and where enthusiasm lies within the games industry.\n\nFurther study\n\nPopular options for further study include Masters degrees in 3D computer games design, commercial games development, artificial intelligence for games, games programming, games engineering and mobile app development.\n\nFurther study can have a significant positive impact on your portfolio as you spend considerable periods of time working on high-quality advanced artwork and game designs. This can give you an advantage in the workplace over undergraduates. Look for courses that are industry focused and have strong links with employers.\n\nSome students pursue a PhD following their Masters, although this isn't very common.\n\nFor more information on further study and to find a course that interests you, see Masters degrees and search postgraduate courses in computer game design.\n\nWhat do games design graduates do?\n\nA quarter (26%) of games design graduates are working as IT professionals 15 months after graduation. 10% are working as web and multimedia design professionals, 9% as IT technicians, 4% as teaching professionals and 3% as sales, marketing and related associate professionals.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of what games design graduates are doing 15 months after graduation, see What do graduates do?\n\nGraduate Outcomes survey data from HESA."
