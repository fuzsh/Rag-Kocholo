        "text": "The best-selling video games of all time, Tetris and Minecraft, both happen to be indie hits. That’s not to conflate return with value, but it illustrates an undeniable fact: even in this era of AAA-studio supremacy, a truly inspired independent vision always has the potential to emerge, thrive and — in exceptional cases — even dominate the gaming landscape.\n\nThat potential has never been stronger than it is right now, as we’re in the midst of an indie-gaming boom.\n\nThe indie gaming sector has blossomed with everything from platformers and multiplayer puzzlers to run-and-gun’s and role-playing games (RPGs). The effect of these works is often a deep sense of community among players and, for game inventors, an ever greater sense of personal identification. As Fez designer Phil Fish said in the documentary Indie Game: The Movie, “It’s not just a game. I’m so closely attached to it that this is my identity.”\n\nCheck out these indie game developers who’ve made a name for themselves in the gaming world.\n\n22 Indie Game Developers to Know\n\nMobilityWare\n\nLocation: Irvine, California\n\nFounded: 1990\n\nMobilityWare is a mobile gaming company focused on producing card and puzzle games for players across mobile platforms.

Barone, who labored completely alone for four years on the game, originally began the project to only practice C# and be able to add it to his resume. The result was the Stardew Valley title, a Harvest Moon-inspired farming and dating simulator. The game is ranked under USA Today’s 100 best video games of all time, and is noted by GQ as “the unlikeliest independent-video-game triumph since Minecraft.” Barone’s next release, Haunted Chocolatier, is currently in development.\n\nToby Fox\n\nLocation: Manchester, New Hampshire"
