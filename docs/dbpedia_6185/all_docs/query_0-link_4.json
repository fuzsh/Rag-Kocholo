        "text": "So when do we hear from Esaki and Greenawalt?\n\nThey’re the faces of this mess, not this Hartman guy. Whatever he told them to do, they implemented it. They own this just as much as him. Maybe more.\n\nWhy have they disappeared right off the map?\n\nNo, he’s still with Turn 10, and made a few public statements about the game on the run-up to release; Esaki, obviously, was the major face of the production.\n\nI wish there were eyes on this game like there are eyes on Call of Duty right now for being such a mess because neither Esaki nor Greenawalt should get to hide and send underlings out to take all of the blame and the heat. They’re the project lead and GM of the franchise, respectively. Why aren’t they out there right now? Because someone on that level has to be, and if it’s not going to be them, then yes, Hartman should speak up since this technically happened on his watch. And if he has to, then I hope he does it with the guarantee to both of them that their careers end the moment his words do, because they have essentially failed at their jobs.\n\nWhen I read this announcement it pretty much marked the expected end of my Xbox consumership. If the next game to come out of Xbox studios is anything like this I will be done with them. Most my games are PC anyway. My kids will just have to suffer until I can get them all PS5s.\n\nI can’t help but wonder what metrics they evaluate themselves by when they can keep their jobs & even get rewarded/promoted after repeatedly performing like this for years.\n\n4 titles in a row in this series have seen reductions in features, little (or nothing) new & innovative added, declining sales, deteriorating quality, worsening customer satisfaction, shrinking player engagement, and little ongoing/regular (favorable) coverage by “iNfLuEnCeRs.”\n\nAll typical outward signs seem to indicate the brand has been in major decline for a while, with no hopeful signs of bouncing back.\n\nSo I’m guessing that whatever criteria they rate themselves by internally are completely disconnected from customers, from quality, & from the genre/market/competition.\n\nThey seem to be working for some other audience & for some other purpose towards some other goals that have little (or nothing) to do with making great racing games that players will love."
