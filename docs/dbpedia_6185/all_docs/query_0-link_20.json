        "text": "Although a slew of post-launch updates have improved Forza Motorsport following the title's October launch, it's fair to say the franchise's big reboot has fallen short of fan expectations. It had been six years since Forza Motorsport 7's release, and the follow-up still hit consoles and PCs with glaring graphical and gameplay bugs, incomplete features, and an unpopular single-player campaign—not to mention the Nürburgring Nordschleife's absence. A first-hand account of the game's development published to YouTube by one of its artists may give us insight as to why the day-one product turned out the way it did.\n\nAdrian Campos was employed by Forza developer Turn 10 Studios as a Senior Environment Artist on a contract basis from June 2022 to October 2023. Campos was tasked with building the terrain and scenery surrounding the circuits, \"essentially everything not on the track,\" in his words. His tenure began with work on Mugello and Spa-Francorchamps, but just a month and a half in, he learned that the other environment artist on the team who was showing him the ropes had to leave because their contract was ending. This, unfortunately, would become a theme of Campos' employment.\n\nIn time, Campos says Microsoft hired three additional artists to assist him. His description of \"crunch\" to meet Turn 10's target of 20 environments on launch day, particularly during the period when he was working solo, is regrettably all too common in the realm of triple-A game development. But the key here is what Campos describes as the \"18/6 Rule.\" Basically, the developers that Microsoft would hire on a contract basis—that is to say, for a fixed term without healthcare or benefits—could only work for a maximum of 18 months before being required to take six off.\n\n\"Fast forward to around June of 2023, I received an email from the contractor company that really stun-locked me. It said 'hey, your contract is almost up.'\" Campos thought he was contracted for 18 months rather than a year, and all Microsoft was willing to do for him was extend his term by a few more months.\n\n\"I feel bad—not necessarily for the system or the higher-ups,\" Campos said. \"But I feel bad for the coworkers I'm leaving behind. That's one extra hand they don't have. So much knowledge and niche things I found out about the [game] engine, gone, simply because I didn't have time to write down documentation, because I had to finish a track.\" He left a week before Forza Motorsport's release last fall.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/8WG_cBQu01Y\n\nForza Motorsport Developer Shares 'Exhausting' Experience Making the Game\n\nMicrosoft's long-reported insistence on contract hires took its toll on the rebooted racing sim's development, according to one artist.\n\nI don't get the contract bit as it sounds like MS can (shittily) employ contractors to work for 18 months before they have to take 6 off. If that's the case why get rid of someone after 12 months?\n\nLots of rights for workers kick in after 2 years employment. So MS does the extra shitty move of the contractor system with 6 month break to cover any overrun of times (but still short of 2 years). I believe IBM does something similar.\n\nYears ago in the UK workers had holiday rights changed to state that they kicked in after 12 weeks. Companies would routinely get rid of people at 11 weeks, and then rehire them again a week later. The law was changed again to stop this practice and holiday is now accrued from the 1st minute you are on the clock. Travel time for carers was another where companies would not pay carers for travel between homes (for home visits), which meant the law had to be written again to make sure such cases were paid... Care companies still ignore this, but they can get in a lot of trouble and owe backpay for all staff if caught.\n\nIf the law says one thing, companies will do that exact thing and even then do things like the MS contractor system to try and get around it.\n\nThis part...\n\n\"I feel bad—not necessarily for the system or the higher-ups,\" Campos said. \"But I feel bad for the coworkers I'm leaving behind. That's one extra hand they don't have. So much knowledge and niche things I found out about the [game] engine, gone, simply because I didn't have time to write down documentation, because I had to finish a track.\" He left a week before Forza Motorsport's release last fall.\n\nThat's why you know Phil's comments about keeping the right people and his word salad answer on layoffs is all bullshit.\n\n\"I have a commitment to the company on the Xbox business being a profitable and growing part of Microsoft,\" he said. \"And I need to put us in the best position for long-term growth. Most of that is about building great products that exceed their expectations and find millions of customers. But honestly, you know, the cost of building the products inclusive of the people who work on them—I need to make sure we have enough of the right people and the right number of people in the right places for us to succeed.\""
