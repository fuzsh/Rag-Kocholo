        "text": "Forza Horizon takes the critically-acclaimed simulation franchise in a new direction. Developed by British studio Playground Games, it's set on the open roads of Colorado and sees players showcasing cars and taking part in races against a festival backdrop.\n\nWe chat to series director Dan Greenawalt from Turn 10 Studios about establishing the festival vibe, how handling is approached and the technical demands behind an open-world.\n\nWhy take Forza in this direction?\n\n\"The vision for Forza has turned gamers into car lovers and car lovers into gamers. It's all about passion. Thus far the expression of that passion has been very much in the motorsport branch. That is, it's an epic game and it's all about community, but it's really mirroring the player's own passion for cars as such a broad diverse group.\n\n\"What we wanted was to find another company that basically spoke our language and our culture that could be a partner, [and] moving forward into the future, defining a larger Forza experience for people.\"\n\n\"It wasn't really about taking Forza one way or another, it was about expanding the overall framework of Forza itself. But they actually are the same vision, right? Gamers to car lovers, car lovers to gamers. The difference is, this one is using music festival and social gaming.\n\n\"It's using a new vibe to try and hopefully not just reflect the player's own passion but actually amplify and create passion where they never thought of it before. They're like, 'Yeah, summer music? That sounds awesome. Cars, yeah, cars would be cool there. That'd be awesome!'\"\n\nHow do you establish that sort of vibe?\n\n\"Creatively it started with the festival. Playground Games actually worked with a DJ out in the UK, the pretty famous Rob Da Bank on BBC1 and he actually is the founder of Bestival.\n\n\"So having him actually come in and know what he knows, but also not just about the UK festival scene - he goes to Coachella - all that so he was able to come in and say, 'Look, music festivals are about this. If you were going to be parking it would be like this, health and safety is this' - everything down to the little detail.\n\nHe also curated the three radio stations in the game, so we have three different styles of music - we have DJs. So he's adding that whole music summer festival vibe.\"\n\nHow does that have an effect on how you race or how the campaign plays out?\n\n\"Well, it's all endemic, it's all in there together. The radio stations will mention races going on and talk to you about other competitors in the festival. Then when you actually show up at the races - so circuit races, point-the-point races, racing for pink slips, as well as showcase races - it's all in that festival.\n\n\"Everyone's hanging out in the same way they would at a summer music festival. Its summer, right? So you're there with your friends, in groups, things like that. So it's all the way through it.\"\n\nWhen it comes to handling, was it changed to become more arcade-orientated? Or is it the same feel as Forza?\n\n\"Same feel as Forza.\"\n\nWere you tempted to change it?\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\nSo it translated over pretty fine?\n\n\"Absolutely. I think there's this idea of arcade and sim, and I think it's a really outdated idea. I think there are sim games that are really hard - not because they're a sim, but because they didn't actually take the time to make the game with assists that make it easier to play.\n\n\"There are arcade games that are unsophisticated. That doesn't mean that unsophisticated is easy to play. I've played arcade games that are damn hard, and I've played sim games like Forza 4 that an 8-year-old can play.\n\n\"So what we wanted was for it to be approachable, you could go high speed on the open road. That doesn't mean it has to be simplistic. So we started with a Forza Motorsport physics base running at 360 hertz - all the spring rates, fly-wheel rates, everything - and then added assists to make it easier to drive. Then you can turn those off and drive the Forza you love.\"\n\nWhat was it like going from designing closed circuits to more linear ones out in the countryside?\n\n\"The world has to be different, obviously, because in a closed circuit run-off is split in places to keep drivers alive, you know what I mean? It's very designed. Whereas in open world, you actually want experiences like those fences you can go smashing through and explore new areas, find different types of races.\n\n\"So it totally changes how you design it, honestly. So you end up designing the open road first and you design the circuit second, the actual races, you pick them out.\n\n\"So every road in here, there's no dead ends in this game. In the real world there's dead ends, when you start the open road you design everything so you can keep on driving and driving and it never ends. That makes it possible to put circuits and point races kind of anywhere.\"\n\nTechnically, did it have any new demands?\n\n\"Oh yeah, huge new demands. Part of it is when we did Forza Motorsport 4 we had the Bernese Alps, and in the Alps you could look into the distance and see these great vistas, they looked amazing - high detail - but you couldn't drive there.\n\n\"When you're in this, in Colorado, you look over and you see the red rock canyons over there and you can keep driving and you can see them. We need to keep that detail from 20km away, all the way till you get there.\n\n\"That actually required a new system called the 'Uber LOD'... this Uber Level of Detail is the new system that is put in place to always allow you to have incredible detail even in the distance, but to have that basically updating, updating, updating without ever seeing it, as you're getting closer and closer until eventually you can drive on it.\"\n\nA big part of Forza the series is collecting cars. Is that the same here?\n\n\"Yes and no. We're not talking a lot about the actual number of cars for this game, we'll be metering that over the summer. Part of the reason why the motorsport branch has so much collecting aspect is because it is that mirror, and you need to find the five cars that matter to you.\n\n\"This is about that summer music festival, so it's the cars that you're going to bring to show off, it's a different side of that car culture. It also means having cars that actually work in this world. There's a lot of off-roading here, there's a lot of gravel.\n\n\"There's 65 different surface types to drive on and so having cars that drive really well on that - like in the video there's the Evo and the old Audi Quattro - those are cars that you may or may not want to collect, but they're great for racing off-road. So it just changes what cars are included.\"\n\nSo can you analyse the car you collect and walk around it in Auto Vista?\n\n\"Auto Vista is not a feature we're talking about right now. We do have showcases in here where you can come and see the car in the showcase environment, and it's done with like a Handycam style, which gives it more of that music festival look.\n\n\"Everything in here really started with the festival, so every feature that was put in, and every feature that was added. Even things like, you're like, 'Woah, is that motorsports?' Well it is, but it's not because it's based on the festival.\n\nOne thing I liked about Forza 4 was the philosophy where you play how you want to and a campaign builds around you. Is that the same here?\n\n\"It is, in that it's an open-world. So there is a linear structure to unlocking, just like there is in Forza 4. It's not like its 100% everything's unlocked, bam, like that. And that's to meter people into experiences and actually control some amount of their emotional level going through it.\n\n\"But we never try to be so restrictive as to say one, two, three, four. We always want that branching bit so you can follow your own passion. This is an open-world game which makes it even easier to do things like that, so as you're becoming popular by drifting round corners and things like that, and as you're doing more of the festival you unlock more and more events all over the map.\n\n\"That includes showcase events where you'll race against planes, all kinds of cool events all over the world.\""
