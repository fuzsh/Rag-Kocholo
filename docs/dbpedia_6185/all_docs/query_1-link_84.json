        "text": "In game development, choosing a game engine that matches your project, team, and scope is vital. Using an incompatible game engine can cause hiccups resulting in a delayed release (or even shelving the project indefinitely).\n\nThe problem is that there are so many types of games, programming languages, and platforms that it can take time to decide where to start.\n\nIn this post, I’ll cover the game engine foundations and explain why it’s essential to choose your engine carefully. After that, I’ll provide you with the five best game engines available today and a list of things to consider before making your final decision.\n\nNote: If you already know the fundamentals, feel free to jump to the list of game engines.\n\nWhat is a Game Engine\n\nWhen I say game engine, I’m not talking about an engine you build inside a game. Instead, I’m talking about how you build games using engines.\n\nWhen the gaming industry was in its infancy, games would be created from the ground up using the developer’s proprietary software.\n\nAt some point, developers realized that the game program they created could be used to make other games and started creating standalone programs that did just this.\n\nThese became known as game engines.\n\nIn short, a game engine is a specialized development software used to create games. It’s essentially the platform or foundation upon which the game is built.\n\nA game engine does all the heavy lifting for a game, like drawing the animations, handling events in real time, dealing with behind-the-scenes game functions, and more.\n\nIf every developer had to create their engine from scratch, video game development would take exponentially longer. Instead, an engine cuts down the time and effort it takes to create a game.\n\nOn the other end, if you’re very proficient with game engines, but you don’t understands what type of gameplay experiences players enjoy and how to provide them, you’ll create polished and pretty games that no one cares to play.\n\nAnd if you’re trying to get hired by studios, you’ll be judged by your proficiency in both skills sets.\n\nSo make sure you develop both sets of skills.\n\nThe Components of a Game Engine\n\nGame engines generally include a suite of tools in an integrated development environment (or Application Programming Interface (API), enabling developers to construct the game from start to finish in one place.\n\nThe main development tools in a game engine include:\n\nPhysics engine: Together, game physics and collision engines will work to detect collisions in-game and calculate the results. In other words, it lets you simulate laws of physics inside your game.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI): In games, AI gives non-playable characters (NPCs) responsive, intelligent behaviors. The more sophisticated the AI, the more realistic in-game scenarios can become.\n\nAudio engine: The sound or audio engine provides the framework to create and manage sound effects and music within the game.\n\nAnimation engine: This is responsible for generating animations in the game based on keyframes (or positions) designated by animators. Depending on the complexity of your animations, the engine may be able to interpolate animations between keyframes to create smooth-looking motion.\n\nRendering engine: The rendering engine is responsible for managing the 2D and 3D assets displayed on the screen. It takes the models, lighting, texturing, and shading data and turns them into an image on the screen.\n\nGame engines may also include tools for multiplayer and networking, virtual reality (VR) implementation, scripting, I/O device management, and resource management.\n\nAnalysis of 10 Best Game Engines\n\nThere are hundreds of game engines to choose. However, since most of them no one uses (or are bad), I won’t waste time analyzing each. So instead, I picked the 10 most useful ones (in my opinion).\n\nChoosing the best game engine depends on your specific requirements, skill set, and goals. That’s why to help you make the best decision, I’ve analyzed each game engine according to the following:\n\nWho they’re better for (beginners to large teams)\n\nThe type of games they’ve been used to create\n\nThe platforms they can create games for\n\nThe coding language used\n\nThe pricing model\n\nBut without further ado, here are the five best game engines, starting with a brief comparison table.\n\nMobile Export Console Export PC Export 2D or 3D Experience Level Cost Unity Yes Yes Yes Both Beginner, Indie, Pro Free Unreal Engine Yes Yes Yes 3D Pro Free Godot Yes No Yes Both, 2D preferred Beginner, Indie Free GameMaker Studio 2 Yes Yes Yes 2D Beginner, Indie, Pro $4.99/$9.99/$89.99 per month Stencyl Yes No Yes (limited) 2D Beginner, Indie, Pro (mobile developers) $99 or $199 upfront RPG Maker Yes No Yes 2D Beginner, Indie $80 upfront Construct 3 Yes No Yes 2D Beginner, Indie $21.29 per month or $129.99 per year Cocos Creator Yes No Yes 2D, some 3D support Beginner, Indie Free CryEngine No Yes (older gens) Yes 3D Professional Free Phaser Yes No No 2D Beginner, Indie, Professional (web devs) Free\n\n1. Unity\n\nThe Unity game engine, created by Unity Technologies, has been on the market since 2005 and is by far the most popular engine on the market today. In fact, Unity has been used to create more than half of all games on the market today.\n\nUnity has great community support, with thousands of written and video guides on how to use the engine and learn the C# coding language. For this reason, the engine is hugely popular with indie developers.\n\nWho is it for?\n\nBeginner to professional, especially powerful for small indie teams who can’t afford to write their own engine.\n\nWhat platforms can it export to?\n\niOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux, all major consoles, and virtual reality platforms such as Oculus and Steam VR.\n\nWhat types of games can it be used to create?\n\nThe engine is suitable for 3D and 2D games. It has also been used for interactive simulations and industries outside gaming such as film. Examples of games created with Unity include Pokemon Go, Cuphead, Beat Saber, and Hollow Knight.\n\nWhat coding language does it use?\n\nC# with visual scripting and drag-and-drop functionality\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nUnity offers a four-layer licensing model:\n\nFree for developers who earn less than $100,000 from their game\n\nPlus package from $399 per year per user\n\nPro package from $2,040 per year per user\n\nEnterprise package available on request\n\nWhy is Unity popular?\n\nEasy to learn with stacks of resources, tutorials, forums, and community support\n\nVersatile, with one of the largest asset stores of any game engine, including free and paid assets\n\nFree to use if you make less than $100,000 per year on your game\n\nCross-platform game support\n\nWhat are some of the drawbacks?\n\nNeed to know C#\n\nVisual scripting extensions not be as well-integrated as Unreal Engine 4’s blueprints\n\nFrequent updates mean many UI changes\n\n2. Unreal Engine 5\n\nUnreal Engine (UE) was first released in 1998, making it one of the longest-running game engines on the market. Developed by Epic Games, it is currently in its 5th iteration (UE5).\n\nUnreal Engine is behind many of the most popular AAA games on the market. This is because it’s an incredibly robust platform with the ability to be customized to suit the individual needs of specific gameplay styles.\n\nWho is it for?\n\nSuitable for any level developer, but especially suited to large teams working on large projects.\n\nWhat platforms can it export to?\n\nWindows, Mac, mobile devices, most major consoles, the web, and some virtual reality platforms.\n\nWhat types of games can it be used to create?\n\nPrimarily 3D, but 2D-capable. Some examples include Valorant, Fortnite, Gears of War, and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG).\n\nWhat coding language does it use?\n\nC++ with an intuitive visual scripting language called Blueprints\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nCommercial use of Unreal is free with a 5% royalty fee for every sale after the product exceeds USD $1 million in gross revenue. The fee is waived under this revenue if developers publish the game on the Epic Games Store.\n\nUnreal Engine also offers an Enterprise program that comes with premium support, private training, and custom terms for $1,500 per user per year.\n\nWhy is Unreal Engine popular?\n\nEnables high-end graphics, making photorealistic games possible.\n\nProvides visual blueprinting for non-coders.\n\nHas a large asset marketplace with free and paid assets.\n\nProvides scalability.\n\nHas powerful, baked-in multiplayer functions.\n\nWhat are some of the drawbacks?\n\nHeavyweight; meaning it isn’t always the best choice for solo developers or small projects.\n\nResource-intensive, meaning high-end computers are often required.\n\n3. Godot\n\nGodot was released in 2014 and has only recently begun to pick up steam.\n\nGodot is completely free and open-source (through an MIT license), meaning you can access and modify the source code. Godot lets you maintain ownership of the complete rights to your game, with no hidden costs or royalties.\n\nThe hugely active community is consistently adding features, fixing bugs, and helping answer questions for beginners.\n\nWho is it for?\n\nBeginners and indie developers, with the ability to be scaled to larger productions. Modifying the core source code is only recommended for experienced engineers.\n\nWhat platforms can it export to?\n\nWindows, Mac, iOS, Android, MacOS, Linux and web support with HTML5 and WebAssembly. Console support is only available using third-party providers.\n\nWhat types of games can it be used to create?\n\n3D and 2D games. Games created with this engine include Gun-Toting Cats and Sonic Colors: Ultimate.\n\nWhat coding languages does it use?\n\nGDScript (a language with similar syntax to Python), C++, and C#.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nGodot is commercially free and open-source, meaning you can use the Godot Engine for any purpose and distribute modified versions of the engine.\n\nWhat are the advantages of the Godot Engine?\n\nIdeal for 2D game development.\n\nFree and open-source.\n\nIntuitive, with a unique visual-scripting technique and language.\n\nWhat are some of the drawbacks?\n\nThe GDScript language may be tedious for experienced developers to learn if they already know other languages. Use C# instead.\n\nThere aren’t as many tutorials or assets for Godot as there are for Unity and UE.\n\nThe community is much smaller than Unity and UE’s, meaning less support (but it’s growing).\n\nThe engine isn’t suitable for complex, detailed 3D games.\n\nNo support for consoles.\n\n4. GameMaker Studio 2\n\nGameMaker has been creating game engines since 1999. The latest version, GameMaker Studio 2, was released in 2017.\n\nGameMaker Studio is widely popular because it doesn’t require any programming knowledge. The downside of this is that it’s not quite as powerful as engines like Unity or Unreal Engine.\n\nWho is it for?\n\nBeginners and those with no experience coding, with the capacity for more advanced projects.\n\nWhat platforms can it export to?\n\nMicrosoft Windows, Mac, Ubuntu, Android, iOS, HTML5, and current-gen consoles with next-gen (PlayStation 5 and Xbox X|S) support under a higher subscription tier.\n\nWhat types of games can it be used to create?\n\nGameMaker is designed for 2D with very limited 3D support. GameMaker has been used to make UNDERTALE, Spelunky, and Hotline Miami.\n\nWhat coding language does it use?\n\nStudio 2 uses a visual scripting drag-and-drop interface. It also enables users to use the custom GameMaker Language to go beyond the visual scripting capabilities.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nGameMaker has four subscription tiers:\n\nFree: Export to Opera GX gamer browser only.\n\nCreator tier: $4.99 per month, export to Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n\nIndie tier: $9.99 per month with mobile and web support added.\n\nEnterprise tier: $79.99 per month with PS4 and Xbox One support (if you’re a registered developer).\n\nWhy is GameMaker popular?\n\nIt’s very beginner friendly with an intuitive interface.\n\nIt has a robust marketplace for assets.\n\nWhat are some of the drawbacks?\n\nUpfront payment is required for export to popular platforms.\n\nIt’s expensive to publish on consoles.\n\n5. Stencyl\n\nStencyl is a 2D game engine focused on Android and iOS game development.\n\nIt provides a great introduction to game development with an accessible visual programming language known as “Design Mode”.\n\nDespite the entry-level feel, it’s very possible to create viable games with Stencyl, and many of the top games on iOS and Android devices were created using this engine.\n\nWho is it for?\n\nmobile game developers and beginners.\n\nWhat platforms can it export to?\n\nMobile, Windows, Linux, Mac, and the web via Adobe Flash and HTML5.\n\nWhat types of games can it be used to create?\n\nStencyl is strictly a 2D engine.

The context surrounding your game and developing team plays a significant role in determining which engine is best for you.\n\nThis is why a succinct game design document is always recommended as the first step in game development.\n\n6 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Choosing a Game Engine\n\nOnce you start, the engine you’ve chosen is the one you’re going to be using throughout the entire development process (unless you want to start over).\n\nWith that in mind, here are five things to think about before you choose an engine:\n\n1. What are You Comfortable Working With?\n\nWhether you’re flying solo or running a team, there’s a stack of skills required to make a functioning (and fun) game.\n\nFor example, while robust engines like Unity and Unreal Engine can be used on your own, you may spend the bulk of your time learning the ins and outs required to progress on your project.\n\nOn the other hand, these engines also feature extensive content marketplaces in case you lack the skills or time to create assets yourself.\n\n2. What’s Your Budget (and Profit Expectations)?\n\nYour budget and how much you expect to make from your project will have a considerable impact on what engine you choose.\n\nWhile many engines offer free versions, they might limit the functionalities to paying users only. This may affect your team later on when you realize you will indeed have to pay in order to achieve the vision you had for your game.\n\n3. What’s Your Timeframe?\n\nLike any project, determining exactly when you want to finish is vital (even if it takes longer than you expect).\n\nIf you’d rather have a shorter time-to-market, you might want to look at creating a smaller, more focused game using one of the more condensed engines like GameMaker Studio 2.\n\n4. What’s The Size of Your Team?\n\nIf your game is a solo or small-scale project, you might want to choose a more lightweight game engine that you can utilize without the help of a large team.\n\nA larger team will be able to handle the complexities of more powerful game engines like Unreal, since different members can take on specific roles within the development process.\n\n5. What’s Your Scope?\n\nYour goals will help to define what game engine you should use.\n\nAre you developing a triple-A first-person shooter or a small-scale indie platformer?\n\nHeavy-duty engines like Unity and Unreal Engine may perform better on large projects, but you will also need to spend more time (and money) on optimization.\n\n6. What Platform Will You Publish On?\n\nKnowing your target platform early on will help streamline the process in the later stages of development.\n\nUnderstanding the limitations, design, and purpose behind your game engine will ensure that you choose one suitable for your game’s genre, style, and goals.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nChoosing the right game engine for your project is vital if you want to get your game to market as fast as possible.\n\nIf you’re just starting out in game development, just dive in and get your hands dirty.\n\nChoose an affordable, lightweight engine and learn the ropes on a few small projects in parallel to learning how to design enjoyable gameplay interactions.\n\nWith some experience in your belt, you can move on to more ambitious projects with higher stakes, where you’re better equipped to execute.\n\nIf you have any questions about game engines, feel free to leave a comment below!\n\nOther Game Engine Lists\n\nTo help you make better decisions faster, I’ve ranked the game engines I analyzed above into a few “best of” lists depending on the contexts.
