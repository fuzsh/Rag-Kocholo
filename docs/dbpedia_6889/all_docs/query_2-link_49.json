        "text": "Tina Turner\n\nAllmusic Biography : One of the most dynamic soul singers in American music history, Tina Turner was a vibrant force from the moment she stepped on-stage as lead singer of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue in the late 50s. Her gritty and growling performances beat down doors everywhere, looking back to the double-barreled attack of gospel fervor and free-spirited abandon that had originally formed soul in the early 50s. Divorced from Ike in the mid-70s, she recorded only occasionally later in the decade. In the mid-80s, she resurfaced with a series of hit singles and movie appearances that secured her a second life as a powerful solo artist. Her high-profile status was assured well into the 21st century as she entered her late era as a major influence on younger generations.\n\nBorn Annie Mae Bullock near Brownsville, Tennessee, she began singing as a teen and joined Ike Turners touring show as an 18-year-old backup vocalist. Just two years later, Tina was the star of the show, the attention-grabbing focal point for an incredibly smooth-running soul revue headed by Ike and his Kings of Rhythm. The couple began hitting the charts in 1960 with \"A Fool in Love,\" and notched charting singles throughout the 60s, though the disappointing position of \"River Deep, Mountain High\" -- cited by Phil Spector as one of his best productions -- was very hard to take. All expectations were fulfilled in 1971 with \"Proud Mary,\" a number four hit that became the capstone of Ike & Tinas Revue. However, behind the scenes, Ike grew increasingly violent and abusive. Tina finally managed to break free from him in 1976.\n\nShe celebrated her newfound freedom with a critically acclaimed role in the film version of the Whos Tommy. Playing the Acid Queen, she delivered an outrageous, all-too-brief performance in an otherwise forgettable mistake of a movie. Several albums were recorded for United Artists during the late 70s, but her career appeared to be stalled by the turn of the decade. Surprisingly, Tina returned in 1983, first teaming with a Heaven 17 project named B.E.F. on a remake of the Temptations \"Ball of Confusion.\" Tinas vocal offering was understandably apocalyptic, and she gained a solo deal with Capitol that same year. Her first single, a cover of Al Greens \"Lets Stay Together,\" hit the Top 30 early in 1984. Second single \"Whats Love Got to Do with It\" became one of the years biggest hits, spending three weeks at number one. Her album Private Dancer included two more Top Ten singles, the title track and \"Better Be Good to Me.\"\n\nWith another movie role in 1985 (Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome), she found a number two hit with its theme \"We Dont Need Another Hero.\" Her next big hit followed in 1986 (\"Typical Male\"), after which Tinas career began to plateau -- she still charted occasionally and had respectable sales with albums including 1989s Foreign Affair, 1996s Wildest Dreams, and 2000s Twenty Four Seven. In 2009, Turner oversaw and added spoken word segments to Beyond: Buddhist and Christian Prayers, which featured singing from Regula Curti and Dechen Shak-Dagsay. The CD was officially released in 2010. Four years later, a collection of her romantic solo material called Love Songs appeared in time for Valentines Day.\n\nDuring the late 2010s, Turner focused on a bio-musical about her life, which began production in 2016. Starring Adrienne Warren, Tina: The Tina Turner Musical debuted in London in 2018. That year, she also published her second memoir, Tina Turner: My Love Story, and was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at that years Grammys.

But, of course, Turner is anything but predictable, and Acid Queen is thus an immensely enjoyable affair from start to finish. Her version of Led Zeps \"Whole Lotta Love\" takes the dynamics of the original and turns them upside down to deliver an affair that is on par with some of Isaac Hayes finest moments. There are also a few originals, including the last big hit (\"Baby Get It On\") she recorded with her husband, Ike. Not only did Acid Queen prove that Tina was the force to be reckoned with in the duo, it also foreshadowed the brilliant second phase of her career that lay ahead.

A few years earlier, it was hard to imagine the veteran soul/rock belter reinventing herself and returning to the top of the pop charts, but she did exactly that with the outstanding Private Dancer. And Turner did so without sacrificing her musical integrity. To be sure, this pop/rock/R&B pearl is decidedly slicker than such raw, earthy, hard-edged Ike & Tina classics as \"Proud Mary,\" \"Sexy Ida,\" and \"I Wanna Take You Higher.\" But she still has a tough, throaty, passionate delivery that serves her beautifully on everything from the melancholy, reggae-influenced \"Whats Love Got to Do With It\" to the gutsy \"Better Be Good to Me\" to heartfelt remakes of the Beatles \"Help,\" Al Greens \"Lets Stay Together,\" and David Bowies \"1984.\" A reflection on the emptiness of a strippers life, the dusky title song is as poignant as it is depressing. Without question, this was Turners finest hour as a solo artist. Album: 8 of 26\n\nTitle: Break Every Rule\n\nReleased: 1986-09-24\n\nTracks: 11\n\nDuration: 50:44\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Wikipedia Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Typical Male (04:16)\n\n2 What You Get Is What You See (04:31)\n\n3 Two People (04:10)\n\n4 Till the Right Man Comes Along (04:11)\n\n5 Afterglow (04:30)\n\n6 Girls (04:56)\n\n7 Back Where You Started (04:27)\n\n8 Break Every Rule (04:02)\n\n9 Overnight Sensation (04:40)\n\n10 Paradise Is Here (05:35)\n\n11 Iâll Be Thunder (05:21)\n\nBreak Every Rule : Allmusic album Review : Because it contains its share of memorable and inspired material -- and even a few gems -- it seems inappropriate to call Tina Turners Break Every Rule a disappointment. But because Private Dancer was so incredible a comeback, one greeted this anxiously awaited follow-up with such high expectations that anything less than outstanding would have been disappointing. And the album isnt outstanding -- its generally quite enjoyable and far from weak -- but not outstanding. Be that as it may, theres a lot to savor here. \"Two People\" is forgettable, but Turner definitely has some gems in the power ballad \"Ill Be Thunder,\" the driving rocker \"Back Where You Started\" and the haunting David Bowie piece \"Girls.\" While Private Dancer would be a much better introduction to Turners work as a solo artist, this has more pluses than minuses.

This set was comprised of 12 mature, middle-range, adult rock and pop songs. Turner tackled rock on \"Steamy Windows\" and \"The Best,\" the latter a universal hit. She created fine club tracks such as \"Falling Like Rain,\" \"I Dont Wanna Lose You,\" and \"Look Me in the Heart.\" Still, she cooled down long enough for a couple of gutbucket ballads in \"Be Tender With Me Baby\" and \"Ask Me How I Feel.\" The most interesting cut was the scorching return to Turners Delta roots on the flawless \"Undercover Agent for the Blues,\" one of the finest pop-blues performances since B.B. Kings \"The Thrill Is Gone.\" Despite the slight musical style variations, the whole project was wrapped in an enticing pop style that gave it buoyancy and synthesis.

Tina Turners work for Capitol past Private Dancer was spotty, she made a bunch of appearances on soundtracks and other artists albums, and most of the tracks on Private Dancer are good enough to own twice. Almost half of Private Dancer shows up on Simply the Best, but you dont have to endure the way the original album spiraled down into slick fizzle. Instead you have to endure a misguided, pumped-up house remix of \"Nutbush City Limits,\" but thats it. Everything else here is either top-notch or campy, certifiable fun. A duet with Rod Stewart on \"It Takes Two\" supplies the fun along with the new track, \"I Want You Near Me\" (Turner to lover: \"Youre so good with your hands/To help me with a hook or zip\"). The two other new tracks tacked to the end beat out most of the album cuts the collection passes on, plus you get the bombastic \"We Dont Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\" without having to buy a dull soundtrack. The oldest cut by years is the monolithic \"River Deep-Mountain High,\" which is a bona fide classic but sonically out of place here. Reprogram the disc to play it at the beginning or end, skip the new \"Nutbush\" completely, and youve got sparkling, nearly perfect overview of Turners postcomeback career.

As such, her typically impassioned performance of Tammy Wynettes \"Stand by Your Man\" probably will strike listeners as the most curious selection on the album. Those looking for clues to the future, however, may be inclined to concentrate on such titles as \"If This Is Our Last Time\" and \"We Had It All.\" Actually, the original title of the album is more appropriate than the one on this reissue. Turner doesnt really go country on the disc. What she does is perform a batch of country songs in her own inimitable R&B;/rock style. For better or worse, Turner has only one mode. She sings full-out, which means that, for instance, the nuances of Kris Kristoffersons \"Loving Him Was Easier\" escape her, but that, on the other hand, her take on the Box Tops \"Soul Deep\" (not actually a country song, even if it comes from Memphis) is masterful. And she goes right to the emotional core of Loretta Lynns \"You Aint Woman Enough to Take My Man.\" Other singers might \"go country\" by making an album full of steel guitar and fiddle arrangements. But whatever the nominal style of music, when Tina Turner sings it, it becomes Tina Turner music.

Now over 60, Tina has picked a suite of songs about survival, a topic she knows well, and imbued them with as much soul as she can muster. Tina still puts Mariah Carey and Celine Dion to shame. But unfortunately, on Twenty Four Seven, the famous Turner passion is often submerged in glossy production that virtually defines \"adult contemporary.\" In some transcendent moments, Tina reminds us of the woman who sang \"River Deep, Mountain High\" -- like when she spits out \"Ive never been a winner but I still play the game\" in \"All the Woman,\" or during the powerful coda to \"I Will Be There.\" As Tina sings in \"Absolutely Nothings Changed,\" shes lived to fight another day, and thats proof she aint been broken.

From the early years to \"River Deep Mountain High\" to re-recordings of some of her work with husband Ike to her magnificent and triumphant return to the charts, its all here in one form or another. There are a few new songs on here that are easily forgettable, and at two discs get a bit bogged down in filler (her cover of Robert Palmers \"Addicted to Love\" is a totally unnecessary inclusion) this could have been a powerhouse single disc. These small misgivings aside, all of the major hits are here, including those previously only available on soundtracks or singles, making it a perfect starting point for those looking to get just the hits for their collection.

Whereas Tina! was released in North America, The Platinum Collection was released in Europe a few months later in anticipation of the European leg of her tour. The Platinum Collection is almost definitive at 48 tracks in length. It includes all of Turners major hits, including six Ike & Tina Turner-era recordings (\"Nutbush City Limits,\" \"River Deep, Mountain High,\" \"I Want to Take You Higher,\" \"Get Back,\" \"Come Together,\" \"Proud Mary\"), and goes all the way up to the latter-day hits \"When the Heartache Is Over\" and \"Whatever You Need\" from her most recent studio album, Twenty Four Seven (1999), and \"Open Arms,\" the one-off single from her best-of compilation All the Best (2004). In addition to all the hits, The Platinum Collection includes a couple new songs co-written by Guy Chambers (\"It Would Be a Crime,\" \"Im Ready\"), and fortunately it also includes her stunning collaboration with Italian superstar Eros Ramazzotti on his 1998 hit \"Cose Della Vita.\" Unlike Tina!, The Platinum Collection includes the studio versions of \"I Cant Stand the Rain\" and \"Lets Stay Together\" rather than live recordings. All in all, The Platinum Collection is a treasure trove of hits by Turner. Not only does it include all of her solo hits, but it also includes several songs released by others on which she is featured as a guest (e.g., \"Tonight\" with David Bowie, \"Tearing Us Apart\" with Eric Clapton, \"It Takes Two\" with Rod Stewart).

The 2014 compilation Love Songs, however, bends the rules of what qualifies as a love song, finding space for her arena rock anthem \"The Best,\" \"Whats Love Got to Do with It?,\" the adult contemporary standard \"I Dont Want to Fight,\" and Ike & Tinas \"River Deep, Mountain High,\" which may be about love but is bombastic in the way none of the other 17 songs here are. That quick list of songs reveals how many of her hits are here -- also included are \"Lets Stay Together,\" \"Missing You,\" \"Private Dancer,\" and \"When the Heartache Is Over,\" her second-to-last Top 40 Adult Contemporary single; missing are tougher songs like Typical Male,\" \"One of the Living,\" \"Better Be Good to Me,\" and \"We Dont Need Another Hero\" -- and this is why Love Songs is an imperfect but generally worthwhile comp; it has just enough big songs to warrant a purchase and, through a selection of album tracks from the 80s and 90s, it sustains its highly polished romantic mood fairly well."
