        "text": "not to condone anybody's bad behavior, but I'm pretty sure Tina was no angel herself.\n\nIke Turner was one of the most important and influential people in music in the 20th century, period. his credits as an agent, producer, and performer are incredible.\n\nhis guitar of choice was often the Stratocaster and dang, could that man ever play!\n\nI've seen pics of Ike with a blackguard Tele (could have been an Esquire or Nocaster, really) and I'd reckon that's what he was playing before he ever got a Strat. what was he playing on Rocket 88? who knows? could have been anything from a Danelectro to an archtop! definitely small funky amp with an emphasis on \"funky\" but I'd bet he was playing a fairly crummy guitar to match the amp at that point. note: a quick check of Wikipedia says Willie Kizart played the distorted guitar on the song and his amp supposedly had taken a fall but they liked the sound and went with it.\n\nConehead is right. Ike hadn't learned to play guitar yet when Rocket 88 was recorded. He was the piano player and producer. The band on that recording was his band- The Rhythm Kings.\n\nMy Ike Turner story-\n\nBack in early '66 (I'm ancient) I used to attend \"Teen Towns\" around St. Louis, MO. They were basically halls that were rented out to hold concerts for teens with local bands appearing on a regular basis. Ike & Tina Turner Review played at a venue named Regal Hall in So. St. Louis once a week from 8pm-11pm for us teens. Then they'd breakdown and head to East St. Louis, IL to play in the night clubs over there untill the wee hours. An acquaintance of mine who played guitar in another local band knew Ike Turner professionally and knew I was looking to purchase a Stratocaster to upgrade from my Fender Mustang. He said that Ike was selling a Strat and that I should check it out. He let Ike Turner know that I'd be stopping by at the next show at Regal Hall to see it so that he'd bring the guitar. I attended the show that night not sure how to approach Ike Turner. After chickening out during the breaks I waited until the show was over and while they were packing up I saw my opportunity to approach him. He was coiling up some cords as I walked up to him and introduced myself as a friend of our common acquaintance and I was there to see a Strat he had for sale. He nodded and pulled the guitar out of a large duffel bag. It was a '50s sunburst Strat with maple neck that looked like it had been played hard and put away wet. Fingerboard was worn and the body was \"reliced\" for real. Plus no case, just the guitar. He said he wanted $200 for it but I could buy it for $175. I was very disappointed in the appearance of the Strat. I never considered a maple board- that was old-fashioned in 1966 and the playing wear made it look worse. No way I'd pop 175 bucks for this battered axe to replace my shiny Daphne Blue Mustang with the dark Brazilian Rosewood fretboard. After a few minutes of looking at it I told him I'd think about it and kept my money in my pocket. I left feeling good about waiting for the right Strat to come along. A few months later Ike & Tina moved to L.A. to record with Phil Spector and the rest is history.\n\nSometimes you look back at things you did or didn't do and you just feel like kicking yourself in the a**!"
