Have an account? .\n\nTina and Ike Turner were married between 1962 and 1976.\n\nIn 1986, Tina accused Ike of physically abusing her throughout their relationship.\n\nHere's a complete timeline of their tumultuous relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTina and Ike first met in 1957.\n\nAccording to her 1986 autobiography, Tina, 17 at the time and going by her birth name Anna Mae Bullock, became a fan of Ike's band, Kings of Rhythm, after watching them perform at the Manhattan Club in East St. Louis, Illinois.\n\nShe quickly became friends with Ike, 25, and the other band members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then fell pregnant with a child fathered by the band's saxophonist.\n\nBullock began dating Raymond Hill during her senior year of high school and soon fell pregnant.\n\nShe gave birth to their son, Raymond Craig, in 1958.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIke discovered Tina's talent when she grabbed the microphone at one of his shows.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Ike was playing a rendition of B.B. King's \"You Know I Love You\" at the Manhattan Club in 1957 when Bullock grabbed the microphone and began singing.\n\nImpressed by her voice, Ike had asked Tina to join the Kings of Rhythm by the end of the night.\n\nThe pair began dating a year later.\n\nAfter moving into Ike's home in East St. Louis, Bullock and Ike began dating in 1959 and she became pregnant soon after.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIke and Tina released their first single, \"A Fool in Love,\" in July 1960.\n\nOriginally written by Ike for singer Art Lassiter, Bullock ended up providing the vocals on the track after Lassiter failed to show up to recording.\n\nAfter realizing the song was going to be a hit, Ike renamed Bullock \"Tina Turner\" and copyrighted the name.\n\nThe song was the first released under the name \"Ike & Tina Turner\" and sold over 1 million copies.\n\nIke and Tina's son, Ronnie Turner, was born later that year.\n\nTina also adopted Ike's two children from a previous marriage. In turn, Ike adopted Raymond Craig, the son of Tina and his former band member.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey married in 1962.\n\nAfter releasing their debut album in 1961 and enjoying a string of successful hits, Ike and Turner married in Tijuana, Mexico, before moving to Los Angeles.\n\nTogether, they enjoyed mainstream success.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1975, Ike and Tina Turner had 20 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, including one top 10 hit. They also had 12 albums on both the Billboard 200 and Top R&B Albums charts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThings fell apart in 1976, however.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, in July 1976, Ike, who was addicted to cocaine, and Tina got into a physical bloody altercation in their car ahead of a show in Dallas, Texas.\n\nTina subsequently fled from Ike and would hide at several friends' homes for a while.\n\nLater that month, she filed for divorce from Ike, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir divorce was finalized in March 1978.\n\nTina later said that she only received two cars and the rights to her stage name in the settlement.\n\n\"The divorce, I got nothing. No money, no house,\" she recalled in 1986. \"So I said: I'll just take my name.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1986, Tina accused Ike of physically abusing her throughout their relationship.\n\nIn her autobiography \"I, Tina,\" the singer detailed the historical abuse she allegedly suffered from Ike.\n\nShe also recalled trying to take her own life in 1968 by overdosing on Valium after learning Ike had cheated on her with three women in the same night.\n\nIn her 2018 memoir \"My Love Story,\" Tina wrote: \"He threw hot coffee in my face, giving me third-degree burns. He used my nose as a punching bag so many times that I could taste blood running down my throat when I sang.\"\n\nTina described her intimacy with Ike as \"a kind of rape – especially when it began or ended with a beating.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIke later admitted to abusing Turner.\n\n\"Sure, I've slapped Tina. We had fights and there have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking,\" he wrote in his 1999 autobiography \"Takin' Back My Name: The Confessions of Ike Turner.\"\n\n\"But I never beat her,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIke would spend the years after his divorce from Tina doing drugs and getting into trouble with the law.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Ike was arrested multiple times for drug and firearm offenses.\n\nIn February 1990, he was sentenced to four years in jail after being convicted of cocaine intoxication and driving under the influence of cocaine. He was released on parole in September 1991 after completing 18 months of his sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTina, however, enjoyed a successful solo career.\n\nTina began launched her solo career in 1983 with the single \"Let's Stay Together.\"\n\nHer next singles were her cover of The Beatles' \"Help!\" and \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" — which scored her a first and only No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nTina's chart success continued with hits such as \"Private Dancer\", \"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome),\" and \"The Best.\"\n\nTo date, the eight-time Grammy winner has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the highest-selling recording artists of all time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing depression or has had thoughts of harming themself or taking their own life, get help.
