        "text": "I first saw Tina Turner perform in 1966, in the Orchid Ballroom in south London. A long, long way from the stadia where many years later she would thrill crowds of tens – hundreds – of thousands, the Orchid, to paraphrase Sam Cooke’s song, was heaven to me, regularly staging visiting American R&B acts – Otis Redding and the young Stevie Wonder – of whom the Ike & Tina Turner Revue was just one.\n\nTo see Tina, barely 20ft away, legs pumping, her lion’s mane wig flying, almost swallowing her microphone in a way that left nothing to the imagination as she sang Redding’s I’ve Been Loving You Too Long, was one of the most enthralling experiences of my, admittedly young and callow, life.\n\nI was running a soul music fanzine from my bedroom, in the evenings, when I should have been doing my homework, and after the show I finagled my way backstage, hoping I might secure an interview. My request was refused, of course. (I settled for a conversation with another of the Revue’s singers, Jimmy Thomas – a good-natured man, kind enough to convey the impression that there was nothing he’d rather be doing than talking with a nervous teenager about his life and career). Is it my memory playing tricks that even then, striding around the dressing room area, lean and domineering, Ike struck me as a man you would cross at your peril?\n\nIt was to be another 30 years before I encountered him again.\n\nHe was visiting England with his new bride, a spirited 32-year-old blonde named Jeanette. Ike was 64. They had booked into their hotel as “Mr and Mrs Honeymoon”.\n\nIt was Turner’s 12th or 13th matrimonial adventure – he claimed to have first got married at 14 – although he was somewhat hazy on the exact number. But there was only one marriage that anyone ever wanted to talk about – and that, he claimed, wasn’t even legal. \"Hell, I was still married to some other woman. Didn’t get divorced from her til ’74.\"\n\nIt was Ike Turner’s great good fortune to have been married to Tina, but it became his curse. Anna Mae Bullock, to give her her proper name, was just 17 when she took the microphone in the St Louis club where Ike was performing, beginning a relationship that would lead to Ike and Tina Turner becoming one of the hottest acts in R&B.\n\nAnd then in 1976, after 19 years together she walked out on him. Ten years later she published a memoir What’s Love Got to Do With It, in which she portrayed Ike as a wife beater, serial adulterer and cocaine addict – a picture that was to be dramatically embroidered in the film of the same name.\n\nThe musical Tina opened in the West End in 2018. It has been running non-stop ever since. A celebration of her extraordinary talent and her story of triumph over adversity, it has also ensured that Ike, who died in 2007 of a cocaine overdose, will continue to be remembered not as one of the great pioneers of rock and roll – talent-scout, producer, arranger and bandleader – but as the husband from hell.\n\n“This Tina s---…” is how Turner referred to it when we met, sighing deeply. “See, when Tina first came out with this stuff saying we fought, I didn’t care. I figured she felt she had to say that to get her career off the ground. I wasn’t thinking it was going to hurt me. I would have stopped it then. But this thing just grew and grew...”\n\nIn person – and this might surprise you, as it surprised me – Turner was a courteous and obliging man. His lack of any formal education had left him with an artless, at times almost childlike manner – a man alternately angry at the world and seemingly baffled by it. Yes, there had been fights, he said – but what married couple doesn’t fight? – and there had been times when he punched Tina \"without thinking\", but he never beat her.\n\nI hesitated to mention the coat-hangers, shoes and walking cane – and the suicide attempt – all of which had featured in Tina’s revelations. He had vigorously denied firing bullets into her house after they'd split up: “That’s a f---ing lie,\" he once said. \"I’ll tell you one thing. If I was the n----- people think I am, I’d go up to her house and blow it up.”\n\nWhen I asked whether there had been equality in his marriage there was a long pause. \"When you say equality,’ he said at last, \"I don’t know what you mean.\" Well... equality.\n\n\"I never looked at marriage that way,’ he said. \"If you play around on your wife, and she stays at home crying every day and taking it, she’s just as much at fault as you are. Because when it first happened she should have left.\"\n\nTina had got all the sympathy, all the success – success she’d never have had without him - and he’d ended up scorned and villified. \"I’m always the bad guy…. The image they built of me, man... I’m not saying I’m glad Nicole Simpson is dead – no way – but man, I was glad when OJ Simpson came along because he knocked me out of the box.\" He cackled. \"In other words they got someone else to pick on.\"\n\nBy his own account, Turner was just four when he witnessed his father, a Baptist preacher, being beaten by a gang of white men, led by the jealous lover of one his father’s girlfriends. Refused admittance to a whites-only hospital, he later died in a tent put up outside the Turner family home. Ike’s mother remarried, to a man who would beat the young Ike with barbed wire.\n\nAt the age of 13, he was playing piano behind Robert Nighthawk and Sonny Boy Williamson, then out on the road as a sideman, talent scout and producer, recording artists such as B.B. King, Johnny Ace and Howlin’ Wolf. \"We were just going through the South and giving people there $5 to $10 or a fifth of whiskey while we recorded over a piano in their living rooms,\" he once recalled.\n\nIn 1951 he wrote, arranged and produced Rocket 88, with a singer called Jackie Brenston. Sam Philips, who discovered Elvis, would describe it as \"the first rock and roll record\". Turner was paid just $40. Then in 1957, Anna Mae Bullock walked into the Club Manhattan and everything changed.\n\n\"My whole thing,\" Tina once said, \"is the fact that I am to Ike – I’m going to use the term ‘doll’ – that you sort of mould.\" He dressed her to kill, schooled her in her dance steps, unleashed the hurricane that was her voice – \"soul music with the grease\", as she would put it, and worked her half to death.\n\nA friend once recounted the story of how Tina was in hospital with bronchial pneumonia, her body packed with ice to reduce her temperature of 104, and Ike visiting, berating her with \"You get out and sing, or you get out of the house!\"\n\nTogether they made a series of records – A Fool In Love, It’s Gonna Work Out Fine – that stand as exemplars of gritty Sixties R&B, and worked the black Chitlin’ Circuit relentlessly, but it was Tina’s explosive performance on Phil Spector’s production of River Deep Mountain High that propelled them to international recognition.\n\nWhile the record was credited to Ike and Tina Turner, Ike played no role in it. Spector paid him a substantial figure to keep away from the studio. A huge success in Britain, it failed dismally in America, prompting Spector to temporarily retire from the record business.\n\nIke revelled in success, disporting himself in a slick, pompadoured style. He had a flamboyantly enthusiastic approach to drugs, money, firearms and interior decoration. One visitor to the Turners’ Los Angeles home (whale shaped television cabinet, guitar shaped coffee table, mirrored ceilings, and a bookshelf lined with sharkskin-bound \"how-to\" books including How to Scheme Your Way to Fortune and How to Legally Avoid Paying Taxes) was moved to remark \"you mean you can actually spend $70,000 at Woolworth’s?\"\n\nHis studio, a mile away, had a private sanctuary fitted with steel doors and security cameras, which Tina referred to as \"the whorehouse\".\n\nTina was left to while away the hours at home, awaiting his summons. When I interviewed her in 1979 she told me that in search of peace of mind she had started studying Buddhism in the face of stiff disapproval from Ike. “He always thought it was dumb to sit and study a book in another language.”\n\nIke’s philosophy was always less to do with contemplation than in your face acquisition.\n\nThe record executive Bob Krasnow recalled how Turner once came into the office “and threw $70,000 on the floor, in cash, and dared anyone to touch it. Just to blow everybody’s mind”.\n\n(Ironically, Tina told me, it was Buddhism that gave her the strength and self confidence to walk out of the marriage.)\n\nIke’s drug consumption was legendary. Turner had first taken cocaine with Krasnow in Las Vegas. When Krasnow told him it would help maintain an erection, that same night Turner splashed $3,000 on a deal with the sax player King Curtis. When he showed it to Krasnow, he told Turner he had just blown $3,000 on powdered drain cleaner. But Turner was not easily discouraged.\n\nHe told me that in the Seventies he had been spending in the region of $14,000 a week on cocaine. \"But I wasn’t doing it myself, you understand. I was giving it away. Even here. We were at a big hotel in London one time, and I had cocaine just sitting out in big bowls, people just helping themselves.\" He shot me a suspicious look. \"Were you there?\"\n\nAfter Tina’s revelations, things had gone to hell. Without Tina, his bookings dried up; friends (if you could call them that) and business associates no longer returned his calls. When in 1980, a police SWAT team raided his studio they discovered a live hand grenade and reportedly found Ike hovering over a toilet, surrounded by several empty plastic bags and holding seven grams of cocaine.\n\nIt was just one in a long line of arrests – for drugs, assault, and shooting a newsboy in the leg after he reportedly kicked Turner’s dog (although the “newsboy” was 49 and had a gun, too). Being apprehended for stealing crockery and bath-towels from a hotel was a particular low-point. Had he not spent two years in jail, he told me, he would likely have died on the streets. Not untypically, it was a situation he had been able to turn to his advantage, at one point amassing $17,000 in a month selling candy, cigarettes and coffee to inmates. \"I was always a hustler,\" he said.\n\nAt the time I met him he was in Britain attempting to resurrect his career. \"All I want to do now is get on with my life and play music.\" He sighed. \"I’m done with defending myself.\" He was taking advice from Max Clifford. Despite everything, it was hard not to feel sorry for him."
