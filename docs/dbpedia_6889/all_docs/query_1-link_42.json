        "text": "Ike and Tina Turner were one of the most iconic duo of rock ‘n’ roll in the 1960s. Ike Turner grew up in Clarksdale, Mississippi where he learned to play he piano from Pinetop Perkins. By the time he became a teenager Turner began leading his own band with over 30 members. The band ultimately split into two separate bands, the Top Hatters and Ike Turner’s Kings of Rhythm. They were known for playing and performing various early R&B and rock ‘n’ roll numbers. In 1951, Ike Turner recorded “Rocket 88” at Sun studio in Memphis along with saxophonist Jackie Brenston. Brenston and the Delta Cats ended up getting all the label credit instead of Turner and the Kings of Rhythm when the got became a #1 R&B hit. “Rocket 88”is widely considered to be the first rock ‘n’ roll record. Ike Turner continued to succeed in the 1950s as a top guitarist, scout and producer who performed with many talented artists such ass B.B. Kings, Otis Rush and Johnny Ace.\n\nOriginal “Rocket 88” recorded by Ike Turner and Jack Brenston\n\nIke Turner and the Kings of Rhythm\n\nIn 1956, as the Kings of Rhythm were playing in nightclubs throughout St. Louis they met Anna Mae Bullock at Club Manhattan. She was a young, vibrant nurse at the time that grew up singing since an early age at talent shows. Bullock repeatedly asked Turner is she could be a singer in his band but he ignored her request. After being given a microphone by the band’s drummer Bullock proceeded to sing with the band various songs throughout the night. She began singing as a background vocalist as Ike Turner trained her on voice control and performance. In March 1960, Turner had written the song “A Fool in Love” for Art Lassiter to record but since he failed to show up he substituted him Bullock. The song became a hit after it’s release, reaching #2 R&B, #27 on the Billboard Hot 100 and selling millions of copies. Turner changed Anna Mae’s name to Tina Turner, with the intent that if anything occurred he could just give the name to someone else. She was also given a look to match Jane from Tarzan. Ike and Tina Turner got married in Mexico in 1962. The group began performing as “Ike and Tina Turner Revue”. The group consisted of nine musicians and three female background singers and dancers called the Ikettes.\n\nIke and Tina Turner Revue became a huge staple during the 1960s. In 1961 they charted with “It’s Gonna Work Out Fine” and “I Idolize You” In 1962, “Poor Fool” and “Tra La La La La” were hits. In the mid-60s they became revolutionary in England. In 1966 they recorded one of their most famous songs “River Deep, Mountain High”. The band also appeared in a featured concert film called The Big T.N.T. Show. The Turners crossed over to make pop hits in the late 60s and opened up for the Rolling Stones in their 1969 tour. In the 1970s came their hits “Come Together”, “I Want to Take You Higher”, and “Proud Mary”, which won them a Grammy in the Best R&B Vocal Performance by A Group category. Their album Outta Season in 1969 made the Top 100 albums chart and Workin’ Together in 1970 was the highest charting pop album reaching #25. The Ikettes also had a couple hits such as “I’m Blue” and “Peaches ‘n’ Cream”.\n\nAs the decade wore on Tina Turner began a unsuccessful solo career. Her marriage and artistic partnership with Ike Turner took a turn for the worst as his alcohol and cocaine addiction led to severe physical and emotional abuse to his wife. In 1976, Tina Turner left him after she escaped out of her hotel room with 36 cents in her pocket. In 1983 after signing with Capitol records Tina made one of the greatest comebacks with the song “Let’s Stay Together”. In 1990, Ike Turner ended up getting arrested just before he and Tina were inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January of 1991."
