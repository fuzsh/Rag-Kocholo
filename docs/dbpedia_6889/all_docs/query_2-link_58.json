        "text": "Tina, born Anna Mae Bullock on 26 November 1939, began her career as a singer in 1960 with Ike Turner, whom she would marry a couple of years later. The two would go on to produce several songs that would climb the charts until their separation in 1976. She went on to reinvent herself as a solo act in the 1980s and made one of the most successful comebacks in music.\n\nHer talent, voice and energetic dancing earned her the title “Queen of Rock” and would see her inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice. Tina Turner passed away at the age of 83 at her home in Switzerland on Wednesday 24 May after a prolonged illness. Even though the world is mourning her death, her music and spirit lives on. Here’s a look at some of her most cherished and chart-topping songs.\n\n‘A Fool in Love’: Ike and Tina Turner 1960\n\nReleased in August 1960, Ike and Tina Turner made their chart debut at No. 10 on the Hot R&B Sides chart. It raced up over the next two weeks to reach No. 2 and on the Billboard Hot 100 it reached No. 27.\n\n‘Proud Mary’: Ike and Tina Turner 1971\n\nIn 1971, Ike and Tina Turner did a cover of ‘Proud Mary’ by Creedence Clearwater Revival which had reached No. 2 on the charts two years prior. Their much more sizzling version did almost as well, reaching No. 4, but it did much more for their careers. The song launched the duo into the wider American public’s consciousness and earned Tina her first of 12 Grammys.\n\n‘Typical Male: 1986\n\nTina Turner was on a run in the 1980s as she came roaring back to the limelight. ‘Typical Male’ in 1986 was her second song to peak at No. 2 in as many years.\n\n‘We Don’t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)’: 1985\n\n‘We Don’t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)’ was the title track for ‘Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome’ in which she played a leading role, and reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 in 1985.\n\n‘What’s Love Got to Do With It’: 1984\n\nTina Turner initially didn’t want to do ‘What’s Love Got to Do With It’ but was finally convinced after she confirmed that she could sing it her way. The song would cement her comeback and earn her first No. 1 on the Hot 100 in 1984.\n\nOther Tina Turner songs that made the charts or a fan favorites"
