        "text": "Ike Wister Turner (November 5, 1931 – December 12, 2007) was an American musician, bandleader, talent scout, and record producer. Considered to be one of the fathers of rock and roll, his first recording, \"Rocket 88\" by \"Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats,\" in 1951, is considered by some to be the \"first rock and roll song\" ever. However, he is best known for his work with his ex-wife Tina Turner as one half of the Ike & Tina Turner revue. In Tina Turner's 1986 autobiography, I, Tina, later filmed as What's Love Got to Do with It?, Tina accused Ike of violent spousal abuse, which Ike repeatedly denied for many years. However, in his 2001 autobiography Ike admitted, \"Sure, I've slapped Tina... There have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I have never beat her.\""
