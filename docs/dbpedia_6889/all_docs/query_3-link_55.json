OK, so before all of you gang up on me, I want you to realize that I do not approve of any spousal violence.\n\nIke has been gone for several years and, no matter what you think of his private life, I want you to consider only the Music part of it. Yes, I know this will be controversial but I am a big fan of his “Music”, not him as a functioning part of society.\n\nYou can say what you want but Ike did record what is considered the “First” Rock and Roll Record in 1951. I do not agree with this selection, but a lot of people agree. That song has been credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but it really was Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm with Brenston being the sax player.\n\nIke had a horrible life during childhood. He was raped and treated terribly; I’m amazed he survived. He did claim to have 11 wives, of which I guess Anna Mae Bullock was the most famous; she was no Angel, but a great singer.\n\nLook into Tina’s Biography: Ike was really bad, but Tina was no angel either. I digress.\n\nIke was paid a total $20 for Rocket 88, the first Rock and Roll record. He was self taught; piano first then guitar. He was a tough Task Master. That’s why the Kings of Rhythm were such a Tight Band.\n\nAll I ask is that you just look at the music; Ike Turner was definitely not “Father of the Year”, but man he rocked R&B like nobody else.\n\nIke Turner (1931-2007)\n\nVideos\n\n.\n\n2002 / North Sea Jazz Festival / Ike Turner & The Rhythm Kings – Live In Concert (DVD)\n\n.\n\n2002 / North Sea Jazz Festival / Rocket 88 /\n\n.\n\n2002 / Steel Guitar Rag (the man could play) /\n\n.\n\n2004 / Vienna Jazz Festival /\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMusic\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHere are a couple of songs from over 60 years ago by Ike Turner and the Kings of Rhythm\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n–o–"
