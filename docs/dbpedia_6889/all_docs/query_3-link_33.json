        "text": "Ike Biography\n\nIke Turner and Tina Turner, a husband and wife musical team from the United States, performed together. They appeared live as the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue from 1960 until 1976, accompanied by Ike Turner’s band the Kings of Rhythm, and backup vocalists known as the Ikettes. One of the most powerful live acts on the R&amp;B circuit, The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue was praised for its live performances.\n\nEarly recordings by the pair included “A Fool In Love,” “It’s Gonna Work Out Fine,” “I Idolize You,” “Poor Fool,” and “Tra La La La La.” These songs pioneered straight-midtempo R&amp;B and had an impact on succeeding genres like funk and rock music. Their success in Europe grew after the 1966 release of “River Deep – Mountain High” and a UK tour with The Rolling Stones. Their latter works are renowned for soulful interpretations of rock tunes including “Honky Tonk Woman,” “Proud Mary,” and “Come Together,” the latter of which earned them a Grammy Award in 1972. The first Golden European Record Award was given to Ike &amp; Tina Turner in 1974 for their worldwide hit “Nutbush City Limits.” Numerous albums were recorded by them; Workin’ Together and Live at Carnegie Hall were their most popular albums. Their album River Deep – Mountain High was named one of the best of its time by Pitchfork.\n\nWhen it was released in July 1960, “A Fool In Love” immediately became popular. On August 15, it peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B Sides. Ike assembled the Kings of Rhythm, Jimmy Thomas, a trio of female singers known as the Ikettes, and Tina Turner to form the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue. They transitioned from performing in bars to places like the Apollo Theater in Harlem as the track rose to the pop chart. When Tina was nearly eight months pregnant, they made their first national broadcast debut on American Bandstand on October 3. On October 17, “A Fool In Love” reached its Hot 100 high at position number 27, eventually selling one million copies.\n\nIn 1991, Ike and Tina Turner were admitted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n[Two of their tracks, “River Deep – Mountain High” and “Proud Mary,” were recognized by the Grammy Hall of Fame. They came in at number two on Rolling Stone’s list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.\n\nThe Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue traveled by plane to Dallas, Texas on July 1, 1976, where they performed at the Dallas Statler Hilton. The Turners got into a physical altercation in the car on the way to the motel. Tina escaped as soon as they arrived and later hid at numerous friends’ houses before going to the nearby Ramada Inn. Tina filed for divorce on July 27, 1976, citing irreconcilable differences. Years later, she claimed that Ike had assaulted her during their marriage in her autobiography I, Tina: My Life Story, which was published in 1986. In his autobiography Takin’ Back My Name: The Confessions of Ike Turner, published in 1999, Ike stated that Tina started their final argument by purposefully agitating him in order to give her an excuse to end their relationship before they were supposed to sign their new contract.\n\nOn March 29, 1978, their divorce was legally concluded. In the settlement, Tina granted Ike her part of their publishing companies, real estate, and recording studio Bolic Sound, while he kept his four cars. Ike received the publishing earnings for both his and her works, but Tina kept her songwriter income from songs she had written. Along with her stage name, she kept her two Jaguars, furs, and jewelry. Tina accepted responsibility for the obligations resulting from missing concert dates and an IRS lien.\n\nIn response to the sudden breakup, United Artists finished the albums from their final recording sessions and released Delilah’s Power (1977) and Airwaves (1978). Ike released “Party Vibes”/”Shame, Shame, Shame” from The Edge as a single in 1980. The song’s position on the Billboard Disco Top 100 chart peaked at number 27.\n\nIke And Tina Turner Discography\n\nTop Videos\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhy Did Tina And Ike Break Up?\n\nThere are a number of reasons that Tina and Ike might have broken up.
