        "text": "Tina Turner, the American-born singer who left a hardscrabble farming community and an abusive relationship to become one of the top recording artists of all time, has died at age 83.\n\nShe died peacefully after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich, Switzerland, her representative said on Wednesday.\n\nTurner began her career in the 1950s during the early years of rock and roll and evolved into an MTV phenomenon.\n\nIn the video for her chart-topping song What's Love Got to Do with It, in which she called love a \"second-hand emotion,\" Turner epitomized 1980s style as she strutted through New York City streets with her spiky blond hair, wearing a cropped jean jacket, mini skirt and stiletto heels.\n\nWith her taste for musical experimentation and bluntly worded ballads, Turner gelled perfectly with an '80s pop landscape in which music fans valued electronically produced sounds and scorned hippie-era idealism.\n\nSometimes nicknamed the \"queen of rock 'n' roll,\" Turner won six of her eight Grammy Awards in the 1980s. The decade saw her land a dozen songs on the Top 40, including Typical Male, The Best, Private Dancer and Better Be Good to Me.\n\nHer 1988 show in Rio de Janeiro drew 180,000 people, which remains one of the largest concert audiences for any single performer.\n\n'An international sensation'\n\nBy then, Turner had been free from her marriage to guitarist Ike Turner for a decade.\n\nThe superstar was forthcoming about the abuse she suffered from her former husband during their marital and musical partnership in the 1960s and 1970s. She described bruised eyes, busted lips, a broken jaw and other injuries that repeatedly sent her to the emergency room.\n\n\"Tina's story is not one of victimhood but one of incredible triumph,\" singer Janet Jackson wrote about Turner, in a Rolling Stone issue that placed Turner at No. 63 on a list of the top 100 artists of all time.\n\n\"She's transformed herself into an international sensation — an elegant powerhouse,\" Jackson said.\n\nIn 1985, Turner gave a fictional turn to her reputation as a survivor. She played the ruthless leader of an outpost in a nuclear wasteland, acting opposite Mel Gibson in the third instalment in the Mad Max franchise, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.\n\nMost of Turner's hit songs were written by others, but she enlivened them with a voice that The New York Times music critic Jon Pareles called \"one of the more peculiar instruments in pop.\"\n\n\"It's three-tiered, with a nasal low register, a yowling, cutting middle range and a high register so startlingly clear it sounds like a falsetto,\" Pareles wrote in a 1987 concert review.\n\nTributes from Mick Jagger, Mariah Carey\n\nMick Jagger of the Rolling Stones said he was saddened by Turner's death, calling her \"enormously talented.\"\n\n\"She was inspiring, warm, funny and generous,\" Jagger wrote on Twitter. \"She helped me so much when I was young and I will never forget her.\"\n\nMariah Carey said Turner will always be a survivor and an inspiration to women everywhere.\n\n\"The words legendary, iconic, diva, and superstar are often overused and yet Tina Turner embodies them all and so many more - an incredible performer, musician and trailblazer,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nActor Angela Bassett, who was nominated for an Oscar after portraying Turner in the 1993 film What's Love Got To Do With It, said she was honoured to have known her.\n\n\"Tina Turner showed others who lived in fear what a beautiful future filled with love, compassion, and freedom should look like,\" wrote Bassett on Instagram.\n\nCanadian singers Bryan Adams and Jully Black also paid tribute to Turner on social media.\n\nAdams, who paired with Turner on the 1985 single It's Only Love, said \"the world just lost one hell of a powerhouse of a woman.\"\n\n\"Thank you for being the inspiration to millions of people around the world, for speaking your truth and giving us the gift of your voice,\" Adams said on Twitter.\n\nBlack posted on Instagram that Turner was her \"music mommy.\"\n\n\"My renaissance in my 40s is because of you not giving up and you exploring new sounds and you allowing your gift to make room for you,\" the R&B singer wrote.\n\nBlack later told CBC News that she was even more inspired by how Turner lived and who she was.\n\n\"Tina Turner to me as an artist represents possibility, represents resilience, endurance, hope, longevity... strength, courage, wisdom, spirituality, so many things,\" she said.\n\nAt the White House, spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre called Turner's death \"a massive loss to the communities that loved her and certainly the music industry. Her music will continue to live on.\"\n\nCommercial success and abusive marriage\n\nShe was born Anna Mae Bullock on Nov. 26, 1939, in the rural Tennessee community of Nutbush, which she described in her 1973 song Nutbush City Limits as a \"quiet little old community, a one-horse town.\"\n\nHer father worked as an overseer on a farm and her mother left the family when she was 11 years old, according to the singer's 2018 memoir My Love Story. As a teenager, she moved to St. Louis to rejoin her mom.\n\nIke Turner, whose 1951 song Rocket 88 has often been called the first rock and roll record, discovered her at age 17 when she grabbed the mic to sing at his club show in St. Louis in 1957.\n\nThe band leader later recorded a hit song, A Fool In Love, with his protege and gave her the stage name Tina Turner, before the two married in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nTina employed her strong voice and strenuously rehearsed dance routines as lead vocalist in an ensemble called the Ike and Tina Turner Revue. She collaborated with members of rock royalty, including The Who and Phil Spector, in the 1960s and 1970s and appeared on the cover of the second issue of Rolling Stone magazine in 1967.\n\nIke and Tina bounced between record labels, owing much of their commercial success to a relentless touring schedule. Their biggest hit was a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's Proud Mary.\n\nTurner left her husband one night in 1976 on a tour stop in Dallas, after he pummeled her during a car ride and she struck back, according to her memoir. Their divorce was finalized in 1978.\n\nThe Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inducted Ike and Tina Turner in 1991, calling them \"one of the most formidable live acts in history.\" Ike died in 2007.\n\nMore than 200 million records sold\n\nAfter leaving her husband, Turner spent years struggling to regain the limelight, releasing solo albums and singles that flopped and gigging at corporate conferences.\n\nIn 1980, she met new manager Roger Davies, an Australian music executive who went on to manage her for three decades. That led to a solo No.1 hit — What's Love Got to Do With It — and then in 1984 her album Private Dancer landed her at the top of the charts.\n\nPrivate Dancer went on to become Turner's biggest album, the capstone of a career that saw her sell more than 200 million records in total.\n\nIn 1985 Turner met German music executive Erwin Bach who became her long-term partner and in 1988 she moved to London, beginning a decades-long residency in Europe. She released two studio albums in the 1990s that sold well, especially in Europe, recorded the theme song for 1995 Bond movie GoldenEye, and staged a successful world tour in 2008 and 2009.\n\nAfter that, she retired from show business. She married Bach, relinquishing her U.S. citizenship and becoming a citizen of Switzerland.\n\nShe battled a number of health problems after retiring and in 2018 she faced a family tragedy, when her oldest son, Craig, took his life at age 59 in Los Angeles. Her younger son, Ronnie, died in December 2022.\n\nHer name continued to draw audiences years after her retirement. The musical stage show Tina: The Tina Turner Musical, with Adrienne Warren initially acting and singing the star's life story, was a hit first in London's West End in 2018, and later on Broadway, and is still running. In 2021 HBO released a documentary about her life, Tina.\n\nShe is survived by Bach and two sons of Ike's that she adopted."
