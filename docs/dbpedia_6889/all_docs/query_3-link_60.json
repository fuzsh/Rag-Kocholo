        "text": "Ike & Tina Turner\n\nAllmusic Biography : As husband and wife, Ike & Tina Turner headed up one of the most potent live acts on the R&B; circuit during the 60s and early 70s. Guitarist and bandleader Ike kept his ensemble tight and well-drilled while throwing in his own distinctively twangy plucking; lead vocalist Tina was a ferocious whirlwind of power and energy, a raw sexual dynamo who was impossible to contain when she hit the stage, leading some critics to call her the first female singer to embody the true spirit of rock & roll. In their prime, the Ike & Tina Turner Revue specialized in a hard-driving, funked-up hybrid of soul and rock that, in its best moments, rose to a visceral frenzy that few R&B; acts of any era could hope to match. Effusively praised by white rock luminaries like the Rolling Stones and Janis Joplin, Tina was unquestionably the star of the show, with a hugely powerful, raspy voice that ranks among the all-time soul greats. For all their concert presence, the Turners sometimes had problems translating their strong points to record; they cut singles for an endless succession of large and small independent labels throughout their career, and suffered from a shortage of the strong original material that artists with more stable homes (Motown, Atlantic, Stax, etc.) often enjoyed. The couples well-documented marital difficulties (a mild way of describing Ikes violent, drug-fueled cruelty) eventually dissolved their partnership in the mid-70s. Tina, of course, went on to become an icon and a symbol of survival after the resurgence of her solo career in the 80s, but it was the years she spent with Ike that made the purely musical part of her legend.\n\nIzear Luster \"Ike\" Turner, Jr. was born in Clarksdale, MS, in 1931; initially a pianist, he formed his first band in high school and put together the Kings of Rhythm in the late 40s. In 1951, that group cut the pivotal \"Rocket 88,\" a tune often pinpointed as the first ever rock & roll record; however, since sax player Jackie Brenston took the vocal, the song was credited to Brenston & His Delta Cats rather than Turner & the Kings of Rhythm. Not long after, Turner switched from piano to guitar, and he and his band became a prolific session outfit in Memphis, backing various Sun artists and bluesmen during the early 50s. Turner moved the Kings of Rhythm to East St. Louis in the mid-50s, where they became kingpins of the local R&B; circuit. In 1956, he met a teenage, gospel-trained singer from Nutbush, TN, named Anna Mae Bullock, and promised her a chance to sing with his band. That chance kept failing to materialize, until one night Bullock simply grabbed the microphone and started belting. Impressed, Turner made her a part of his revue, changing her name to Tina. After Tina became pregnant by the bands saxophonist, Raymond Hill, she moved into Turners house, an arrangement that led to their own relationship; the two were married in 1958 and soon had a child of their own.\n\nIn late 1959, Turners band entered the studio to cut a song called \"A Fool in Love\" for the Sue Records label. The scheduled male vocalist failed to show up for the session, and Tina was pressed into service. Released in 1960, \"A Fool in Love\" shot to the number two spot on the R&B; charts, also making the pop Top 30. Tina was now clearly the focal point of the act, which Turner rechristened the Ike & Tina Turner Revue; with a large, horn-filled ensemble and a group of leggy backup singers dubbed the Ikettes (who complemented Tinas short-skirted, uninhibited gyrating), the Revue eventually developed a reputation for putting on one of the most exciting live shows in R&B.; The R&B-chart; hits came fast and furious during the early 60s: 1961s \"I Idolize You\" (number five) and \"Its Gonna Work Out Fine\" (number two), 1962s \"Poor Fool\" (number four) and \"Tra La La La La\" (number nine). It was an impressive run, but the well went dry over the next several years; Ike supplied much of the bands original material, and although he was responsible for many of the early successes, he simply wasnt a world-class songwriter who could deliver hit-caliber tunes with regularity. Much of the Revues repertoire consisted of bluesy, chitlin circuit R&B; that wasnt exceptionally memorable. Ike & Tina branched out from Sue Records and spent the next few years issuing records on additional labels, including Kent, Modern, and Loma. While they had some undeniable high points and several chart entries, none reached the level of their initial run of Top Ten hits.\n\nIn 1966, the Turners worked with legendary producer Phil Spector, who was seeking a way to restore his artistic and commercial standing at the forefront of pop music in the wake of advances by the Beach Boys and Beatles. The powerful instrument that was Tinas voice appealed to Spectors sense of grandeur, and he conceived of a massive-scale production framing that voice that would rank as his greatest masterpiece. Ike already had a reputation for demanding control, and Spector struck his deal accordingly: although the records would be fully credited to Ike & Tina Turner, Ike would not be allowed to enter the studio or alter the finished recordings (in effect, Spector was paying him not to meddle). The centerpiece of Spectors collaboration with Tina was \"River Deep - Mountain High,\" a monumental pop symphony that cost over $22,000 to produce (in 1966, this was a whopping sum for an album, let alone a single). The single represented Spectors so-called Wall of Sound style at its most gloriously excessive, and Tinas was one of the few voices in popular music strong enough to cut through the monolithic orchestral backing. With the high cost and his own slipping stature, Spector was betting the farm on \"River Deep - Mountain High,\" and although it rocketed into the British Top Five and made Tina a star in the U.K., it flopped in America, where its mixture of black and white musical aesthetics was still slightly ahead of its time. A crushed Spector retreated from the music business not long after, and his Philles label yanked the accompanying album of the same name from American release (Spector wound up producing only five of the 12 cuts). Although some critics dismiss \"River Deep - Mountain High\" as overproduced bombast, many still consider it one of rocks greatest singles; George Harrison famously described it as \"a perfect record from start to finish.\"\n\nAfter the Spector deal fell through, Ike & Tina returned to their somewhat mercenary recording habits, cutting songs for Modern and Innis, then moving to Minit and Blue Thumb in 1969. That year, they went on the road as the opening act for the Rolling Stones, and Ike slightly retooled the Revues sound to appeal to white rock audiences in addition to their core black following. In 1970, they signed with Liberty/United Artists and recorded Come Together, which incorporated contemporary rock & roll covers into their repertoire; versions of the Beatles title track and Sly & the Family Stones \"I Want to Take You Higher\" made the R&B; Top 30. Released later that year, Workin Together became the most popular album of their career, making the Top 25 on the strength of a storming reinterpretation of CCRs \"Proud Mary.\" Featuring a notorious spoken intro by Tina, the \"nice...and rough\" version of \"Proud Mary\" gave Ike & Tina their first Top Five hit on the pop charts, and returned them to the same heights on the R&B; side as well; it also won them a Grammy. The covers gimmick couldnt last forever, though, and their formula soon grew predictable; their last major success was 1973s \"Nutbush City Limits,\" a semi-autobiographical song written by Tina that made the R&B; Top 20 and just missed that placing on the pop side. By that point, Tina had grown increasingly uninterested in the duos well-established act, and was tiring of the largely unchallenging material she continued to perform.\n\nUnfortunately, the music itself wasnt the only factor in Ike & Tinas downturn. As a bandleader, Ike had long been a disciplinarian, but during the 60s he developed severe addictions to alcohol and, especially, cocaine. Wanting to maintain control over the star of his show at any cost, Turner kept his wife in line through an increasingly violent pattern of emotional and physical abuse; often drug-related, his flights of rage could result in severe beatings or burns that pushed Tina to attempt suicide in 1968, according to her autobiography. She continued to endure Ikes dominance through the early 70s, and her performances were clearly weary by the end; finally, she walked out on her husband and generally declined to pursue claims for financial compensation from their work together. Their divorce became official in 1976. After a long period of struggle, Tina re-emerged triumphantly in the 80s as a superstar solo act; Ike, meanwhile, ran his own recording studio for a time, but his drug problems worsened, resulting in several arrests. Sadly, and perhaps fittingly, he was serving prison time when he and his former wife were jointly inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, and was unable to attend the ceremony.

They were far from a finished, polished act, especially in the studio. Tina was still determining how much power and sensuality she had in her voice and was developing her delivery and presentation, while Ike was honing the backdrop, and his band learning when to push and when to lay out behind Tina.

This period of their discography is marked by burning early R&B; fused with the same fireball energy of the also quickly developing rock & roll culture. Things slow down only slightly with the soulful title track and the swanky \"Why Should I,\" but the energy is on ten for most of the set. This album notably features Tina Turners first ever lyrical composition in the form of would-be dance craze tune \"Tinaroo.\" Album: 4 of 40\n\nTitle: River Deep - Mountain High\n\nReleased: 1966\n\nTracks: 12\n\nDuration: 35:52\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Wikipedia Allmusic AlbumCover 1 River Deep - Mountain High (03:39)\n\n2 I Idolize You (03:47)\n\n3 A Love Like Yours (Dont Come Knocking Every Day) (03:05)\n\n4 A Fool in Love (03:13)\n\n5 Make em Wait (02:22)\n\n6 Hold On Baby (02:59)\n\n7 Save the Last Dance for Me (03:03)\n\n8 Oh Baby!

The title song was Phil Spectors last major effort, a Wall of Sound production from 1966 that hit in the U.K. but flopped in the U.S., leading to his retirement. There were a few other Spector tracks with the Turners (actually, only Tina appears on \"River Deep -- Mountain High\"), and an album was scheduled on Spectors Philles Records label. Discs were printed for a 1967 release, but no covers, and the LP never appeared. Two years later, A&M Records (its catalog now controlled by Universal) finally put it out. It turned out that Spector hadnt produced a whole albums worth of material; in addition to his productions (\"A Love Like Yours [Dont Come Knocking Every Day],\" \"Ill Never Need More Than This,\" \"Save the Last Dance for Me,\" and the title song), Ike Turner had produced a batch of typical Ike & Tina material, including remakes of their early-â60s hits \"A Fool in Love,\" \"I Idolize You,\" and \"Its Gonna Work Out Fine.\" Turners simple, direct R&B production style has nothing in common with Spectors everything-but-the-kitchen-sink style, so the resulting collection is full of odd juxtapositions in sound. But no matter whos in the producers chair, the center of the music is still Tina Turner, emoting for all shes worth.

It contained routine soul and R&B; numbers sung with little variety or emotion by Turner, and produced and arranged with almost no variety or flair. It was more a collection of singles than an actual album, but was rushed out among the raft of Ike and Tina product that glutted the market. It has since been deleted, and deservedly so. Album: 6 of 40\n\nTitle: So Fine\n\nReleased: 1968\n\nTracks: 10\n\nDuration: 26:25\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nAllmusic AlbumCover 1 Betcha Cant Kiss Me (Just One Time) (02:54)\n\n2 Aint Nobodys Business (02:09)\n\n3 It Sho Aint Me (03:09)\n\n4 Too Hot to Hold (02:10)\n\n5 A Fool in Love (02:52)\n\n6 I Better Get Ta Steppin (02:47)\n\n7 Shake a Tail Feather (02:17)\n\n8 So Fine (02:44)\n\n9 We Need an Understanding (02:49)\n\n10 Youre So Fine (02:30)\n\nSo Fine : Allmusic album Review : In the late 60s, Ike & Tina Turner were churning out such a rapid succession of albums on various labels that its hard even for dedicated fans to keep them straight. So Fine is typical of these LPs in that a certain minimum satisfying level of quality soul is guaranteed by virtue of the duos talents. But at the same time, theres also the sense that theyre grinding out recordings too quickly to consistently present the outstanding original material and interpretations of which they were capable at their best. Tinas vocals are reliably passionate, but the songs and arrangements are fairly average, at times even generic soul, mixing a few Ike Turner originals (including a remake of their early hit \"A Fool in Love\") with covers of well-known staples like \"Shake a Tail Feather\" and \"So Fine.\" (Speaking of which, it was surely careless to cover \"So Fine\" and, just two tracks later, add a cover of the entirely different song \"Youre so Fine,\" which in this context sounded downright redundant.) The best cut here is \"It Sho Aint Me,\" which has a more slow-burning bluesy feel (and Stax-y feel, with its horn, organ, and churchy backup vocals) than much of its surroundings, but nothing here ranks among the pairs best work. Album: 7 of 40\n\nTitle: The Hunter\n\nReleased: 1969\n\nTracks: 9\n\nDuration: 30:15\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic AlbumCover 1 The Hunter (06:30)\n\n2 You Dont Love Me (03:00)\n\n3 You Got Me Running (03:00)\n\n4 Bold Soul Sister (02:35)\n\n5 I Smell Trouble (03:45)\n\n6 The Things I Used to Do (03:10)\n\n7 Early in the Morning (03:00)\n\n8 Youre Still My Baby (02:45)\n\n9 I Know (02:30)\n\nThe Hunter : Allmusic album Review : Released just a few years after the epochal Phil Spector-produced River Deep Mountain High and close to six years before their breakup, Ike and Tina Turners Hunter often gets lost in the duos long and stormy existence. And while the album certainly is not on the same plane as the Spector album or later work like Workin Together, Hunter still boasts several fine blues workouts in the inimitably electrifying Ike and Tina mode. The Stax sound figures prominently here, with producer Bob Krasnow (Captain Beefheart) keeping things nice and uncluttered to better frame Tinas intense vocal workouts. Maybe not the best first-disc choice, but still a worthwhile title for Ike and Tina fans. Album: 8 of 40\n\nTitle: Cussinâ, Cryinâ & Carryinâ On\n\nReleased: 1969\n\nTracks: 11\n\nDuration: 27:36\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nAllmusic AlbumCover 1 Cussinâ, Cryinâ, & Carryinâ On (02:39)\n\n2 Poor Little Fool (02:47)\n\n3 So Blue Over You (02:32)\n\n4 Nothing You Can Do Boy (to Change My Way) (02:27)\n\n5 Iâm Fed Up (02:14)\n\n6 You Got What You Wanted (02:25)\n\n7 Make âem Wait (02:18)\n\n8 Beauty Is Just Skin Deep (02:14)\n\n9 Thinking Black (02:40)\n\n10 Black Beauty (02:30)\n\n11 I Better Get ta Steppinâ (02:50)\n\nCussinâ, Cryinâ & Carryinâ On : Allmusic album Review : If youre stacking this against the numerous OK-but-not-great LPs Ike & Tina Turner issued in the late 60s, this might stand out a little by virtue of featuring a higher percentage of Ike Turner originals than those records typically did. In fact, all but one of these ten tracks are Turner compositions, though the variety of styles makes one suspect they might have been cut over a period spanning quite some time. There are some fairly decent girl group-influenced sides (\"So Blue Over You,\" \"Make Em Wait\") that have the sound of something that might have been done a few years prior to this albums 1969 release date. At the more modern end of the spectrum, \"Thinking Black\" and \"Black Beauty\" are quite good funk-rock instrumentals with a sinister edge, a little ahead of the curve that would find such material gaining greater favor in the soul world in the early 70s. Other offerings are more in line with the husky Tina Turner-sung soul that usually comes to mind when you think of Ike & Tinas work during this era, though \"Poor Little Fool\" is a throwback to an early-60s R&B; ballad approach. Its an uneven LP -- more in style than quality -- but worthwhile for serious fans of the duo, though it doesnt have any of their very best material.

They never had a bigger hit (the closest was their Blue Thumb release, Outta Season, which peaked at 91), and, in many ways, they didnt make a better album. After all, their classic 60s sides were just that -- sides of a single, not an album. Even though it doesnt boast the sustained vision of such contemporaries as, say, Marvin Gaye and Al Green, Workin Together feels like a proper album, where many of the buried album tracks are as strong as the singles. Like its predecessor, it relies a bit too much on contemporary covers, which isnt bad when its the perennial \"Proud Mary,\" since it deftly reinterprets the original, but readings of the Beatles \"Get Back\" and \"Let It Be,\" while not bad, are a little bit too pedestrian. Fortunately, theyre entirely listenable and theyre the only slow moments, outweighed by songs that crackle with style and passion. Nowhere is this truer than on the opening title track, a mid-tempo groover (written by Eki Renrut, Ikes brilliant inverted alias) powered by a soulful chorus and a guitar line that plays like a mutated version of Dylans \"I Want You\" riff. Then, theres the terrific Stax/Volt stomper \"(Long As I Can) Get You When I Want You,\" possibly the highlight on the record. Though they cut a couple of classics over the next few years, most notably \"Nutbush City Limits,\" the duo never topped this, possibly the best proper album they ever cut.

This one yielded no hits, but included an interesting version of \"Baby (What You Want Me To Do)\" and a remake of \"Tell The Truth,\" from their first album. It was otherwise prototype Ike and Tina, but Tina didnt sound so enthused and Ike wasnt generating much magic behind her.

The Turners would score one more big hit with their next album, but it was evident that Tina had little interest in continuing to do soul and R&B; ballads, and that their domestic problems were causing professional havoc. Her voice hadnt lost its power or resilience, but she had absolutely no energy or conviction in her vocals. The band was now on cruise control, and the entire operation was near its end.

This results in a supremely sleazy, utterly addictive record, one thats relentless in its rhythms and fearless in its funk as Ike lays down nasty rock & roll guitar -- check his solos on \"Feel Good,\" where hes as elastic as rubber -- and Tina tears it up with pure, unbridled passion. Feel Good is quintessentially 70s -- the fuzztoned funk practically conjures up platform shoes and mile-wide collars -- but it doesnt belong to any one sound, it casually draws from Southern soul, James Brown funk, black pride, Superfly style and juke joint R&B;, a sound that is uniquely identified with Ike & Tina. And while this contains no flat-out classics like \"Nutbush City Limits\" or \"Proud Mary,\" as an album Feel Good undoubtedly ranks among their very best: its a non-stop party.
