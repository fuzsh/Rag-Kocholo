        "text": "Limited 180gm vinyl LP pressing. Daylight Again is the seventh album by Crosby, Stills & Nash, and their fourth studio album comprising original material. It peaked at #8 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Three singles were released from the album, all making the Billboard Hot 100: \"Wasted on the Way\" peaked at #9, \"Southern Cross\" at #18, and \"Too Much Love to Hide\" at #69. The genesis of the album lies in recordings made by Stephen Stills and Graham Nash at intervals in 1980 and 1981 and the album was originally slated to be a Stills-Nash project. Executives at Atlantic Records, however, had little interest in anything but CSN product from any member of the group, and held out for the presence of Crosby. They began to turn toward the company's point of view, however, and decided to invite Crosby to participate at the eleventh hour."
