        "text": "SONG LIST*\n\nM1 Bright Size Life (Pat Metheny), Bright Size Life, Pat Metheny, Released ECM, LP 1976, (4:55)\n\nM2 Sirabhorn (Pat Metheny), Bright Size Life, Pat Metheny, Released ECM, LP 1976, (5:27)\n\nM3 Unity Village (Pat Metheny), Bright Size Life, Pat Metheny, Released ECM, LP 1976, (3:38)\n\nM4 Unquity Road (Pat Metheny), Bright Size Life, Pat Metheny, Released ECM, LP 1976, (3:36)\n\nM5 So May It Secretly Begin (Pat Metheny), Still Life, Pat Metheny Group, Released Geffen Records, LP 1987, (6:24)\n\nM6 Last Train Home (Pat Metheny), Still Life, Pat Metheny Group, Released Geffen Records, LP 1987, (5:38)\n\nPat Metheny is an American guitarist and composer. He has worked as a soloist, in duets and small jazz ensembles, and, for decades, with the Pat Metheny Group. His musical styles include Jazz Fusion, Jazz (both progressive and contemporary jazz) …..and also Latin Jazz. He was born in Lee’s Summit, Missouri in 1954. Lee’s Summit is a suburb on the southeast side of Kansas City.\n\nHis main influences have been other musicians, his musical family and the British Invasion.\n\nMusicians influencing Metheny include trumpeter Miles Davis, Gary Burton on vibes, jazz guitarists Jim Hall and Wes Montgomery and Jazz Sax players John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman. PAUSE\n\nA major foundational influence for Metheny is his musical family. His father played trumpet, his brother Mike Metheny plays jazz trumpet, and Pat’s maternal grandfather was a professional trumpeter. Brother Mike taught Pat how to play the trumpet, and so trumpet is actually Pat Metheny’s first Musicians in the family. Metheny attributes his early success to the local musical environment he was brought up in – the years 1964-1972, in Kansas City. Much of this is described in his biography titled BENEATH MISSOURI SKIES. Seems like Metheny is destined to become a great trumpeter, with all that musical environment…. PAUSE\n\n.. there was a bump in the road at age 10. The BRITISH INVASION was in full force. Metheny saw the Beatles perform on TV in 1964, probably the Ed Sullivan Show, because that year the Beatles appeared. The Beatles are what inspired Metheny to defect from Trumpet to Guitar.\n\nMetheny persuaded his father to buy him a guitar for his 12th birthday. That first guitar was a Gibson ES-140. PAUSE\n\nThat’s a hollow-body guitar, built in ¾ scale for young players and small hands. It’s a scale model of the Gibson ES-175 hollow body. Metheny soon got bigger hands and acquired a Gibson ES-175 …and that guitar is featured on his early albums like those in this podcast episode… Metheny started playing in pizza parlors at age fourteen (that’s 1968). At age 15, Metheny won a scholarship from Down Beat Magazine to attend a jazz camp (1969). That camp led to a meeting with Jazz guitarist Jim Hall, and bassist Ron Carter. So, by the time he graduated from high school (1972) he was the first-call guitarist for Kansas City jazz clubs, private clubs, and jazz festivals. Metheny had A LOT of support from his musical environment. Even though he switched from trumpet to guitar.\n\nMetheny briefly attended college at U of Miami in Florida, but quickly realized after practicing on guitar for years all day long… he was unprepared for a college program … He realized then he was first and foremost, a serious guitarist and composer.\n\nMetheny moved to Boston to teach at Berklee College of Music at the age of 19, where he met Jazz Vibraphonist Gary Burton. Teaching Jazz Theory and Performance was in demand.\n\nBIT BUCKET\n\nand for those not familiar, the ES-175 is sought-after by jazz country and rock guitarists – – – these vintage guitars today sell for $3,000 to $25,000. Back in the day, made in Kalamazoo MI. How about that for your first guitar? I am jealous, my first guitar was a Kay (named after John Kay) and it was … a very basic and cheap and crude electric starter guitar. Metheny, on the other hand, got a wonderful instrument, because\n\nThere have been many collaborations with Metheny and Burton over the decades since then.\n\nthat guitar was retired 20 years later- – in 1995.\n\n­­\n\nM1 Bright Size Life (Pat Metheny), Bright Size Life, Pat Metheny, Released ECM, LP 1976, (4:55)\n\nMetheny released his debut album, Bright Size Life (ECM, 1976), with Jaco Pastorius on electric bass guitar and Bob Moses on drums. This is a studio album, recorded in Ludwigsburg Germany. It is amazing to think that this is a debut album. Released in 1976, BRIGHT SIZE LIFE is still fresh today. In this title song, Metheny begins his work in a signature way, his entrance is unmistakable with a quick ascending line. Many of his solos begin with the signature Metheny sound….and Pastorious presents an equally inmistakable bass guitar part. Here’s that fabulous BRIGHT SIZE LIFE INTRO\n\nSAMPLE Play that intro ascending line with Jaco solid bass line in Bright Size Life\n\nPastorius and Metheny are weaving together guitar and bass lines in this song. The bass is so much more than a rhythm support role, Pastorius is playing in parallel improvisation with Metheny. Bright Size life sets the table for a fine album of jazz fusion by 22-year old Metheny.\n\nAnd now, BRIGHT SIZE LIFE, 1976\n\nPlay M1\n\nDon’t Touch That Dial\n\nThat was M1 BRIGHT SIZE LIFE, 1976\n\nAt the time of this recording, Metheny was living in Boston and teaching at the Berklee School of Music. His mentor was Gary Burton, the jazz vibraphonist. They collaborated on the arranging of the songs to be recorded for this album, and Burton attended the recording sessions in Germany. Interesting that Burton did NOT receive a PRODUCER or ARRANGER credit on this album.\n\nCredits\n\nPat Metheny – 6-and 12-string electric guitar\n\nJaco Pastorius – electric bass\n\nBob Moses – drums\n\nBIT BUCKET\n\nPASTORIUS FOR ANOTHER PODCAST !\n\nM2 Sirabhorn (Pat Metheny), Bright Size Life, Pat Metheny, Released ECM, LP 1976, (5:27)\n\nNow we review the second track on side 1…. the song is titled SIRABHORN\n\nI attempted to analyze the magical sound of this song and how that never heard before /from another planet sound is structured. Surely it is structured, with a Pastorius bass line and with Bob Moses supplying the heartbeat throughout this song. The song is so difficult to describe in words . A skilled composer named Dr. Guy Shkolnik described SIRABHORN this way:\n\nThe beautiful harmony is made of chromatic alterations of pure​ diatonic harmony​ and three modulations.\n\nPAUSE\n\nMillions of amateur guitarists, myself included, remain in awe of Metheny. He is a trained musician from childhood, with composition, arrangement and performance skills and teaching skills. His guitar performance is complex and mind-bending. Decades later, his signature sound is imitated but never duplicated.\n\nPAUSE\n\nA little info about the bassist JACO PASTORIUS. The SIRABHORN song features a Jaco electric fretless bass solo and is from the earliest recording of Pastorius. He employed the use of a fretless bass, a 1962 Fender Jazz Bass that he called the Bass of Doom. As a youngster, he had modified the bass by removing the frets (which is outrageous) using a butter knife, then smoothing the gaps on the fretboard. Along with his use of distortion, 2-note power chords, the use of harmonics, and bass solos that sound lyrical…he is regarded today as one of the best electric bassists of all time. Here is an example of a LYRICAL SOUNDING SOLO from Pastorius….\n\nSAMPLE Insert example of a LYRICAL SOLO by Jaco. Suggest Sirabhorn, about 60% into the song a solo that runs 60 seconds. Alternate is the solo in BRIGHT SIZE LIFE song.\n\nWhat about that equally strange song name? Sirabhorn is named after a jazz guitar student of Metheny’s at Berklee.\n\nAnd now here is SIRABHORN 1976\n\nPLAY M2\n\nDon’t Touch That Dial\n\nthat was M2 Sirabhorn (Pat Metheny), Bright Size Life, Pat Metheny, Released ECM, LP 1976, (5:27)\n\nSong credits M2 go to\n\nPat Metheny – on a chiming twelve-string guitar with alternate tuning\n\nJaco Pastorius – electric bass guitar with lyrical bass solo\n\nBob Moses – drums providing the hearbeat of this song\n\nIn this same year, Pastorius released his own debut, self-titled, solo album.\n\nBIT BUCKET\n\nSirabhorn is an alteration of C – Am – F – Dm a common musical theme.\n\nThis is altered to become C – B flat m – G flat – E m –\n\n“Sirabhorn” Metheney said that The chiming opening bars have that open, pastoral sound that Metheny has said is rooted in his Missouri upbringing. The vast majority of guitar enthusiasts never get beyond 3-chord popular songs and their evolutions from the 1960s.\n\nM3 Unity Village (Pat Metheny), Bright Size Life, Pat Metheny, Released ECM, LP 1976, (3:38)\n\nI do recall distinctly seeing Metheny TWICE at the Amazingrace, a small speakeasy in Evanston. It was 1977 and I have my tickets from the January show and the August show. This was early in career of Pat Metheny, playing then at a BYOB event in a shell of a building on Chicago Ave. Metheny was 22. Large hair. Large hollow body Gibson guitar. Seeing this kid just nail the songs from the Bright Size Life album drove it home and made Metheny a lifetime favorite jazz guitarist. This kid is for real.\n\nNow the song UNITY VILLAGE. Here we have a deep guitar solo. The song is named after a tiny 100-person village UNITY VILLAGE bordering Kansas City and Lee’s Summit in Missouri. It’s the headquarters for a spiritual movement, the UNITY Movement which “offers positive, practical Christianity” and describes itself as being “for people who might call themselves spiritual but not religious”. The church was a part of the Metheny family history, with his grandfather working there, and both his dad and his brother had played in the church’s Unity Village Band. The song “Unity Village” is back down to earth. Peaceful and pastoral. It has two guitar parts.\n\nOne guitar part plays the changes with bass line.\n\nThe other plays the melody and variations.\n\nThere is a head to the song, typical of a contemporary jazz. The song really sounds like a story.\n\nAnd now\n\nUNITY VILLAGE Pat Metheny 1976\n\nPlay M3\n\nDON’T TOUCH THAT DIAL\n\nThat Was M3 Unity Village (Pat Metheny),Bright Size Life, 1976, (3:38)\n\nCredits M3\n\nCREDITS\n\nPat Metheny – solo 6-and 12-string electric guitar, and song’s composer\n\nM4 Unquity Road (Pat Metheny), Bright Size Life, Pat Metheny, Released ECM, LP 1976, (3:36)\n\nNow for another of Pat Metheny’s mind-bending masterpieces, UNQUITY ROAD. UNQUITY ROAD starts as a jazz tune opening and closing with the head piece and featuring several rounds of improvisations on is. You will hear Metheny and Pastorius working in parallel and playing off each other throughout the song. This is relatively short one for a Metheny composition, at only 3:36.\n\nBob Moses delivers powerful rhythm and accent, and again, is the pulse of this song.\n\nMetheny’s composition features a series of rapid chord changes with a three-note motif. It really feels like forward motion. This track also features a full-on Metheny guitar solo, not heard yet on BRIGHT SIZE LIFE album.\n\nAnd the song title? – Unquity Road is a road in Milton Massachusetts, 10 miles south of Boston and the Berklee College of Music, where Metheny was working at the time of this recording.\n\nAnd now M4 Unquity Road (Pat Metheny) 1976\n\nPlay M4\n\nDON’T TOUCH THAT DIAL\n\nThat was M4 Unquity Road (Pat Metheny),Bright Size Life, Pat Metheny, Released ECM, LP 1976, (3:36)\n\nCredits\n\nPat Metheny – 6-and 12-string guitar\n\nJaco Pastorius – electric bass guitar\n\nBob Moses – drums\n\nPAUSE\n\nThe album BRIGHT SIZE LIFE sold slowly, only 900 copies sold after its first release. That had to be a disappointment. I proudly own one of those LP gems, from that first release in 1976. It was used in this podcast and after 47 years it sounds perfect.\n\nThe Bright Size Life album did achieve #28 on the Billboard JAZZ Albums chart.\n\nThe Life album was recognized by JAZZWISE as one of the 100 Jazz albums that shook the world.\n\nPAUSE\n\nJaco Pastorius released his self-titled debut album in 1976. That same year, he became a member of the jazz fusion group Weather Report from 76 to 81….\n\nTragically, Pastorius died in 1987 as a result of injuries sustained outside a South Florida nightclub. He was only 35.\n\nBIT BUCKET\n\nnone\n\nM5 So May It Secretly Begin (Pat Metheny), Still Life (Talking), Pat Metheny Group, Released Geffen Records, LP 1987, (6:24)\n\nMetheny evolved from a trio to a larger format, The Pat Metheny Group. PMG which was founded by Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays in 1978, following the success of BRIGHT SIZE LIFE. In this recording, in addition to the trio of guitar bass and drums, is piano/keyboards, percussion, and three vocalists.\n\nPAUSE\n\nLyle Mays is on Piano and keyboards. Mays and Metheny composed and arranged nearly all of the Pat Metheny Group’s music. Mays was chief musical architect and sound designer of the group for more than three decades. The album Still Life (Talking) is the fifth studio album by the Pat Metheny Group and was released in mid-1987. This song, SO MAY IT SECRETLY BEGIN, largely due to Lyle Mays piano, has a refined, classy, polished, sophisticated sound. The song features an innovative bass line. That’s Steve Rodby. A refined acoustic bass line that drives the song’s rhythm. Here is an example of the bass line lead-in for the song….\n\nPAUSE AND PLAY song intro, leading up to Metheny entrance. Bass line > Strings. > Metheny\n\nExample piano and bass line\n\nWith this sound and bass rhythm, I am transported in style, hearing a musical storyline. Pat Metheny is the song’s composer. Lyle Mays piano talent makes the song feel like it is his own. Both Mays and Metheny have classy demos in the piece.\n\nAnd Now:\n\nSo May It Secretly Begin (Pat Metheny), 1987 (6:24)\n\nPLAY M5\n\nDon’t Touch That Dial\n\nthat was M5 So May It Secretly Begin (Pat Metheny), from the Still Life (Talking) album\n\nCredits:\n\nPat Metheny – composer, electric guitar, co producer and arranger\n\nLyle Mays – piano, keyboards co producer and arranger\n\nSteve Rodby – acoustic bass\n\nPaul Wertico – drums – a Chicago local – professor of music at Roosevelt University these days\n\n…And 3 vocalists ….\n\nArmando Marçal – percussion, backing vocals\n\nMark Ledford – vocals\n\nDavid Blamires – vocals\n\nBIT BUCKET\n\nThe PAT METHENY GROUP recording with American jazz piano player, Lyle Mays.\n\nJaco Pastorius died 1987 September Ft Lauderdale FL. This album released July 1987.\n\nM6 Last Train Home (Pat Metheny), Still Life (Talking), Pat Metheny Group, Released Geffen Records, LP 1987, (5:38)\n\nAccording to Metheny, the writing of his next tune, LAST TRAIN HOME, came to him very quickly, he said it was written as one complete phrase, then he added the bridge sometime later. Featured on this song are the pulsing bass line and the drum brush tempo, which indeed does resemble the chug-a-lug sound of rolling steam train.\n\nPAUSE EXAMPLE OF CHUG A LUG\n\nAlso featured IN LAST TRAIN HOME is the sound of electric sitar. In this case I belief Metheny is playing a guitar synthesizer, such as the GR-300 polyphonic analog guitar synth, which he did pioneer the use of. IT DOES REALLY SOUND LIKE A SITAR !\n\nPLAY SITAR SOUND\n\nAbout that electric sitar sound. Here is a flash back 20 years before LAST TRAIN HOME….to 1968 with this sitar sound. An electric sitar was used in the 1968 pop song “Hooked on a Feeling” written by Mark James and performed by B. J. Thomas. This version featured the sound of the electric sitar that was played by guitarist REGGIE YOUNG, from The Memphis Boys band. The sitar was really the HOOK that made this song so popular. Here is the sitar sound from that 1968 pop hit JOOKED ON A FEELIN:\n\nPLAY EXAMPLE CLIP FROM BJ THOMAS HOOKED ON A FEELIN\n\n… and now….\n\nLast Train Home (Pat Metheny),from Still Life (Talking) 1987,\n\nPlay M6 FOUR AND TWENTY by Stephen Stills, the Déjà Vu album,\n\nDON’T TOUCH THAT DIAL\n\nThat was M6 Last Train Home (Pat Metheny), Still Life (Talking), Pat Metheny Group, Released Geffen Records, LP 1987, (5:38).\n\nCredits:\n\nPat Metheny – composer, electric guitar with synth, co producer and arranger\n\nLyle Mays – piano, keyboards co producer and arranger\n\nSteve Rodby – acoustic bass\n\nPaul Wertico – drums\n\n…And 3 vocalists\n\nArmando Marçal – percussion, backing vocals\n\nMark Ledford – vocals\n\nDavid Blamires – vocals.\n\nStill Life (Talking) won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance and was certified gold by the RIAA in 1992.\n\nBIT BUCKET\n\nThe GR-300 polyphonic analog guitar synth was introduced mid 1970s. These sell for 2000 to 4000 today used. Pat Metheny was a pioneer in its use.\n\nHear it on this album?\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nConcluding comments\n\nAs of 2023, the combined musical groups consisting of Pat Metheny Group, Unity Band and Metheny as a Solo artist, have earned 20 Grammy awards for albums and performances in the 30 years between 1983 and 2013. His discography is extensive with 53 albums released in the 47-year span between that first BRIGHT SIZE LIFE ALBUM in 1976 and now, 2023.\n\nThat’s it for today’s show PAT METHENY GUITARIST\n\nPlease SUBSCRIBE to hear new episodes of this FREE PODCAST.\n\nTODAY’S PROGRAM……\n\nM1 For What It’s Worth (Stephen Stills), Buffalo Springfield, Buffalo Springfield, Released ATCO, LP 1969 (3:00)…\n\nM2 Bluebird (Stephen Stills) Buffalo Springfield Again, Released ATCO, LP 1967, (4:28)…\n\nM3 Suite: Judy Blue Eyes (Stephen Stills), Just Roll Tape, Recorded 1968, Released Eyewall, LP 2007 (6:33)….\n\nM4 Wooden Ships (Stills, Kantner, Crosby) Just Roll Tape, Recorded 1968, Released Eyewall, LP 2007 (2:26)…\n\nM5 Carry On (Stephen Stills) Déjà Vu, Crosby Stills Nash & Young Taylor & Reeves, Atlantic LP 1970 (4:25)…\n\nM6 4+20 (Stephen Stills), Déjà Vu, Crosby Stills Nash & Young Taylor & Reeves, Atlantic LP 1970 (1:55)…\n\nM7 Sugar Babe (Stephen Stills), Stephen Stills 2, Atlantic Records LP, 1971 (4:04).\n\nM8 Change Partners, (Stephen Stills), Stephen Stills 2, Atlantic Records LP, 1971 (3:14)…\n\nStephen Stills is an American musician, singer, and songwriter best known for his work with\n\nBuffalo Springfield\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash\n\nManassas …\n\nand as a SOLO ARTIST.\n\nHe was born in 1945 in DALLAS TEXAS. He is 78 at the time of this podcast’s production. He is still active. He plays guitar, bass guitar, keyboards… he’s not only a singer and songwriter… also an arranger and producer.\n\nStills has had a long and prosperous career. Starting out in 1963, he has given us some 60 years of songwriting and musical performance.\n\nToday I FEATURE original compositions by singer songwriter Stephen Stills. From my collection we will hear 5 albums:\n\nBuffalo Springfield album and For What It’s Worth,\n\nBuffalo Springfield Again album with Bluebird\n\nStephen Stills’ demo tape album JUST ROLL TAPE with Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, and Wooden Ships\n\nCrosby Stills Nash and Young’s DÉJÀ VU album with 4+20 and Carry On\n\nAnd finally, the STEPHEN STILLS 2 solo album with Sugar Babe and Change Partners.\n\nWe are now listening to ROCK AND ROLL WOMAN from BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD AGAIN.\n\nThese selections were each recorded between 1966 and 1971. Just a small time slice of this singer/songwriter’s career.\n\nStills was between the ages of 21 and 26. These works are important because these songs are each hand crafted by Stills. I also wanted to showcase his array of talents like multi-instrumental musician, arranger, and producer. In addition to being a successful singer/songwriter, who work has had a large musical impact.\n\nMuch more for future podcasts.\n\nM1 For What It’s Worth (Stephen Stills), Buffalo Springfield, Buffalo Springfield, Released ATCO, LP 1969 (3:00)\n\nStephen Stills’ first HIT recording was FOR WHAT IT’S WORTH (or “Stop, Hey, What’s That Sound”). It was 1966. Stills was just 21 years old. This was his first big break. He had written several songs, by now.. Not only did he have an inventory of original songs, he had helped to form a new band. Along with two other singer-songwriters, Richie Furay and Neil Young… they formed Buffalo Springfield out in Los Angeles. Neil Young came from Winnipeg Alberta, and Furay and Stills left a New York City gig with the Au Go-Go Singers, a 9-member group performing at the Café Au Go-Go. Two other Canadians — bassist Bruce Palmer and rock drummer Dewey Martin were added — 5 band members in all. 2 Americans, 3 Canadians.\n\n“For What It’s Worth” became one of the most recognizable songs of the 1960s. It was first released as a 45 RPM single in late 1966. In t1967, For What It’s Worth featured on the first Buffalo Springfield LP.\n\nThe lyrics in FOR WHAT ITS WORTH are all about a confrontation Stills had with LAPD Riot Police in Los Angeles’ earlier that year. There had been many summer nights of rowdy crowds of kids causing late-night traffic issues in the Sunset Strip neighborhood. LA responded by announcing a curfew of 10PM. As a result, there were reported to have been over 1,000 persons out on the Strip protesting and trouble broke out. There were clashes between police and young people. Peter Fonda was handcuffed by police. Jack Nicholson was also on the scene. Whisky a Go-Go was a nightclub on the Sunset Strip, where many great bands have performed. At that time, in 1966, their house band was Buffalo Springfield. Because of continuing issues of unrest, some clubs on the Sunset Strip were forced to close their doors for weeks. It was because of these civil disturbances on Sunset Strip that Stills recorded “For What It’s Worth”.\n\nAnd now, For What It’s Worth (Stephen Stills)\n\nPlay M1\n\nDon’t Touch That Dial\n\nThat was M1 FOR WHAT ITS WORTH – STOP HEY WHATS THAT SOUND\n\nCredits\n\nStephen Stills – Guitar and Vocals and songwriter\n\nRichie Furay – Guitar and vocals\n\nDewey Martin – Drums\n\nBruce Palmer – Bass\n\nRecord Company ATCO, a division of Atlantic Records\n\n“For What It’s Worth” became a top ten hit, reaching No. 7 on the US Billboard 100 in Spring of 1967.\n\nBIT BUCKET\n\nI was a very impressionable age 14 at the time of this song’s release… the song chorus lyrics were very impactful on me…\n\nI think it’s time we stop.\n\nHey, what’s that sound?\n\nEverybody look, what’s going down?\n\nM2 Bluebird (Stephen Stills) Buffalo Springfield Again, Released ATCO, LP 1967, (4:28)\n\nThe Buffalo Springfield band was really about their two biggest egos, those of STEPHEN STILLS and NEIL YOUNG. Buffalo Springfield was still a young band, only 9 months old at this point in late 1966. After their hit “For What It’s Worth”, they were eager to have a repeat success. For a SINGLE, two songs, “Bluebird” Mr. Soul were available for a single. Stills writing Bluebird, Young writing Mr. Soul. These were recorded and released by ATCO Records as a single. The version I will play today is from the LP, titled Buffalo Springfield Again, released later that year 1967. This LP version is much improved with lots more guitar work by Stills and Young. BLUEBIRD features the trading off of guitar solos between Neil Young and Stephen Stills. Stills plays the acoustic guitars, some is finger-picking. Young the rocker plays the distorted lead guitar part, on Les Paul guitar. In this song, Stills is ALL ACOUSTIC, Young is ALL ELECTRIC.\n\nPAUSE EXAMPLE GUITARS\n\nAbout that acoustic guitar we hear – Stills had just purchased a fine old guitar, a 29-year old acoustic Martin D-28. It was first used in the recording of Bluebird. On this song, Stills uses D-modal tuning … he tuned his guitar DOWN a full note to DADGAD, tuning DOWN 3 of the guitar’s 6 strings.\n\nEXAMPLE: Record yourself d-tuning an acoustic guitar to DADGAD.\n\nIt’s a full rich sound used in Celtic music, Folk and Rock. The acoustic guitar work and this recording is sharp and clear because of some early recording expertise in SOUND PROCESSING, the use of compression and equalizers to highlight the picking and full dynamic range of that acoustic guitar. This is an ultra clear recording of Stills on that Martin D-28. AND there is also a BANJO PART.\n\nPLAY BANJO BACKGROUND The banjo part is played by Charlie Chin, bluegrass style, from Greenwich Village – Stills’ worked earlier there. This LP VERSION with the added guitar and banjo parts, lengthens this 2-minute single to 4:28.\n\nAnd now here is Bluebird … complete with dueling guitars and banjo.\n\nPLAY M2\n\nDon’t Touch That Dial\n\nthat was M2 BLUEBIRD (Stephen Stills) Buffalo Springfield Again, Released ATCO, LP 1967, (4:28)\n\nSong credits M2 go to\n\nNeil Young electric lead guitar\n\nBobby West Bass\n\nRich Furay vocal\n\nDewey Martin drums\n\nCharlie Chin – Banjo\n\nStephen Stills – singer, songwriter, producer along with Atlantic Records, acoustic rhythm and lead guitars\n\nThe single reached number 58 on the Billboard chart, some critics see the song as their most accomplished piece. It spent 7 weeks on the HOT 100 chart. Buffalo Springfield did not last / could not last, with 3 egos as large as a house, all of this talent had dismantled by 1968 and each artist went on to their own individual successes…Neil Young departed to form Crazy Horse, Richie Furay departed to form Poco, and Stephen Stills went on to form Crosby Stills Nash and Young. BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD is a foundation of ROCK AND ROLL.\n\nBIT BUCKET On the lyrical side, lyrics are usually lost on me. I am identifying much more with the guitar, drum, and bass parts on these songs. Some say the lyrics in this song Bluebird have to do with Stills’ musings about Judy Collins. He would soon be writing a tong he titled Suite Judy Blue Eyes. More on that later. The closing verse in the SINGLE is:\n\nDO YOU THINK SHE LOVES YOU?\n\nDO YOU THINK AT ALL?\n\nM3 Suite: Judy Blue Eyes (Stephen Stills), Just Roll Tape, Recorded 1968, Released Eyewall, LP 2007 (6:33)\n\nThe next piece is titled Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” and is written by Stephen Stills and performed by Crosby, Stills & Nash (CSN). It appeared on the group’s self-titled debut album in 1969 and was released as a single.\n\nThe song is indeed a SUITE…. it imitates a classical music suite with a set of THREE musical pieces, in this case.\n\nThe inspiration for this Crosby, Stills & Nash classic “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” is Stills’ romantic relationship with Judy Collins They were both singer songwriters and had a romantic relationship that lasted only two years, but numerous songs written by Stills down the road, would muse about Judy Collins.\n\nThe recording features a UNIQUE version of the Suite. This recording is from a DEMO tape made in April of 1968. It was done at a recording studio where Judy Collins had just finished a recording session and there was remaining studio time. Stills evidently paid the recording engineer privately to help him record the demos. He asked the engineer to “JUST ROLL TAPE” and Stills proceeded to perform 13 of his originals – – solo. The tape is available in LP form (very expensive) and on CD.\n\nPAUSE AND PLAY EXAMPLE OF THE EEEEBE tuning at beginning of song.\n\nThe guitar is tuned to modal tuning EEEEBE and was used on later songs from the Déjà vu album— Carry On and 4+20. We will hear each of those later in this podcast\n\nThe Suite has 3 pieces on the demo tape:\n\nSegment one – You Make It Hard\n\nSegment two – What Have You Got To Lose\n\nSegment three – Be My Lady\n\nAnd now\n\n… here is Suite: Judy Blue Eyes played solo by STEPHEN STILLS in 1968\n\nPlay M3\n\nDON’T TOUCH THAT DIAL\n\nThat Was M3 Suite: Judy Blue Eyes (Stephen Stills), Just Roll Tape, Recorded 1968\n\nCredits M3\n\nCredits\n\nStephen Stills solo Guitar and Vocals\n\nListening to this demo ROLLL THE TAPE I can understand the high street value. There are in all 13 songs recorded solo, on one tape, and one take, and there are few gaffs, if any. CLEARLY, Stills not only had inventory but he had great command of the song ideas. Great vocals and use of innovative guitar tunings. These demo songs are solid prototypes!\n\nIn 1970, this song appeared on the group’s self-titled debut album – “Crosby Stills & Nash”\n\nSuite: Judy Blue Eyes reached number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart.\n\nIn Canada, “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” peaked at number 11.\n\nM4 Wooden Ships (Stills, Kantner, Crosby) Just Roll Tape, Recorded 1968, Released Eyewall, LP 2007 (2:26)\n\nNext, we go to Fort Lauderdale Florida. It is 1968, and there is a large sailboat named MAYAN. The ship MAYAN was owned and operated by David Crosby for 45 years. The WOODEN SHIPS story goes like this. Crosby composed the music to WOODEN SHIPS and the lyrics were written by Stephen Stills and Paul Kantner, founder of JEFFERSON AIRPLANE. Crosby said that he composed numerous songs aboard MAYAN, which he considered to be his sanctuary. MAYAN is a 59-foot Alden centerboard schooner-rig, built in1947. It’s actually 66-feet overall, including the bowsprit, and with the centerboard up, can sail in water as shallow as 5 feet.\n\nWOODEN SHIPS is thought to be a look at the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. The 60’s was the cold war and a time of nuclear threat between the USA and USSR. For example the CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS in 1962 was perhaps the closest the US has come to a nuclear disaster.\n\nPAUSE\n\nWOODEN SHIPS was inspired by nuclear holocaust and also real life – as David Crosby said about sailing aboard the MAYAN:\n\n“The world has gone to hell … The idea was that we were sort of sailing away from that madness.”.\n\nThis rendition of WOODEN SHIPS is from Stephen Stills demo tape, the album is JUST ROLL TAPE.\n\nplays a de-tuned guitar and delivers the vocals.. This demo is a shorter version of Wooden Ships, 2:26. Later the song will evolve out to 5:29.\n\nAnd now M4 Wooden Ships recorded in 1968\n\nPlay M4\n\nDON’T TOUCH THAT DIAL\n\nThat was M4 WOODEN SHIPS from JUST ROLL TAPE recorded in 1968 and released in 2007 as an LP and CD with compelling lyrics…..\n\nPAUSE insert lyrics.\n\nWooden Ships on the water\n\nVery free and easy peasy. You know,\n\nThe way it’s supposed to be.\n\nSo how is it this demo tape remained unreleased for so long –2007 was 25 years after the original recording. Somehow, Stills left the demo session without taking his demo tape. Years later, the studio closed down, and many tapes, including this one, were given to another musician ….who finally succeeded in returning the demo tape to Stills, who then produced and released this album (CD and LP versions) in 2007. A great find.\n\nCredits\n\nStephen Stills solo Guitar and Vocals\n\nStephen Stills and Paul Kantner lyrics\n\nDavid Crosby song composer\n\nPROPER VERSIONS of these last two DEMO tracks, Suite Judy Blue Eyes and Wooden Ships, appeared on the debut album of Crosby Stills and Nash a year later — 1969. That debut CSN album sold over four million copies and CSN went on to win a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.\n\nBIT BUCKET\n\nThe theme of WOODEN SHIPS reminds me of Canadian folk singer BONNIE DOBSON’s song released that same year, (WALK ME OUT IN THE) MORNING DEW, a dialogue between the last man and woman left alive after some apocalyptic catastrophe.\n\nThe version recorded and released on the 1969 CSN album is 5:29.\n\nM5 Carry On (Stephen Stills) Déjà Vu, Crosby Stills Nash & Young Taylor & Reeves, Atlantic LP 1970 (4:25)\n\nIn 1968, following the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Stills worked with American singer-songwriter David Crosby from The Byrds, and with English singer songwriter Graham Nash from The Hollies. They worked as a TRIO called Crosby, Stills & Nash or CSN. Some months later they added a familiar name from up north, Canadian singer-songwriter, Neil Young, and became Crosby Stills Nash and Young. Imagine that, Four singer songwriters in one band. With all of that ego and creativity, will CSNY have a chance of a long future ? We go to the second studio album titled DEJA VU, which was the first time Neil Young was included in recordings. Released in early 1970 by Atlantic. On SIDE ONE / TRACK ONE – – the song is CARRY ON. A title that seems to continue on Stephen Still’s persistent theme . “that romantic breakup with Judy Collins”.\n\nSHORT PAUSE\n\nInteresting fact about Carry On is that there is a familiar tune BUNDLED within, making Carry On a musical Suite. That bundled song is QUESTIONS. According to Stills, “Carry On” was completed in about eight hours from conception to finished master.\n\nAnd Now:\n\n….Carry On (by Stephen Stills) from Déjà Vu, Crosby Stills Nash & Young Taylor & Reeves, released in 1970\n\nPLAY M5 Carry On (Stephen Stills) Déjà Vu,\n\nDon’t Touch That Dial\n\nthat was M5\n\nCarry On (Stephen Stills) Déjà Vu, Crosby Stills Nash & Young Taylor & Reeves, released in 1970\n\nCredits:\n\nSong credits go to\n\nDavid Crosby – vocals\n\nStephen Stills – vocals, guitars, bass, organ, and percussion and song composer\n\nGraham Nash – vocals,percussion\n\nNeil Young – does not appear on this song….\n\nDallas Taylor – drums\n\nBIT BUCKET\n\nNot only was Stills songwriter on many of CSN’s songs, Stills really showcased his versatility and talent by playing bass, guitar, and keyboards on their DEBUT, self-titled album released in 1969.\n\nThe album sold over four million copies and at that point had outsold anything from the three members’ prior bands: the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, and the Hollies.\n\nThe album won the trio a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.\n\nM6 4+20 (Stephen Stills), Déjà Vu, Crosby Stills Nash & Young Taylor & Reeves, Atlantic LP 1970 (1:55)\n\nNext we go to Side 2, Track 3,,,,,,,, the song is 4 + 20\n\n4 and 20 years ago I come into this life ….\n\nthe son of a woman and a man who lived in strife\n\nhe was tired of being poor\n\nand he wasn’t into selling door to door…\n\nIt’s a sad song, depressing actually. Stills sings solo and plays a D-tuned guitar, a common tuning of his.\n\nSo let’s listen to a very heavy, a troubled side, of Stephen Stills.\n\n… and now….\n\n.\n\nPlay M6 FOUR AND TWENTY by Stephen Stills, the Déjà Vu album,\n\nDON’T TOUCH THAT DIAL\n\nThat was M6 4+20 (Stephen Stills), Déjà Vu, Atlantic Records 1970, clocking in at a short …..1:55.\n\nCredits:\n\nStephen Stills solo vocal and guitar, and the song composer.\n\nNOTE:\n\nGraham Nash, David Crosby, Neil Young do not appear on this track.\n\nSome Stats about the Déjà vu album\n\nIn March 1970, Déjà vu was certified Gold in the US, JUST 14 days after release!\n\nThe album spent 88 weeks in the Billboard 200 charts\n\nCertified 7× platinum by RIAA, the album’s sales currently sit at over 8 million copies.\n\nDeja Vu remains the highest-selling album of each member’s career ,,,,to-date.\n\nBIT BUCKET\n\nRIAA Recording Industry Association of America\n\nM7 Sugar Babe (Stephen Stills), Stephen Stills 2, Atlantic Records LP, 1971 (4:04)\n\nAfter the breakup of CSNY in 1970, Stills went through another prolific songwriting stage, composing over 20 songs for his 2nd SOLO album – – Stephen Stills 2. That was fast work because the album was released by Atlantic in 1971…….just a year after Déjà vu was released. Fast and Prolific indeed.\n\nOur next song from Stephen Stills 2 is SUGAR BABE. I believe this song is about Stills relationship with Rita Coolidge – with the lyrics……..\n\nCome on sweet Rita\n\nYou’re my sugar baby\n\nAnd now, another Stills creation, SUGAR BABE\n\nPLAY M7\n\nDON’T TOUCH THAT DIAL\n\nThat was M7 Sugar Babe (Stephen Stills), from the Stephen Stills 2 SOLO album,\n\nCredits M7\n\nI love that gnarly Hammond organ grinding away on the right hand track.\n\nOn the Stephen Stills 2 album there are only general credits, not song-specific.\n\nEven upon further research I have:\n\nStephen Stills – vocals, guitars, keyboards, bass guitar, composer, arranger, conductor and producer\n\nCalvin Samuels – bass\n\nConrad Isidore, Dallas Taylor – drums\n\nUnknown keyboards\n\nUnknown harmony vocals\n\nBIT BUCKET\n\nIn this song, one of the best things is the muffled organ on the right side and Still’s distorted guitar on the left side. I’ve seen him perform this song solo on a big grand piano. It’s pretty cool, Stills is a self-taught basic piano player, but what a talented composer arranger and songwriter. Great sound.\n\nM8 Change Partners, (Stephen Stills), Stephen Stills 2, Atlantic Records LP, 1971 (3:14)\n\nLast on today’s Stephen Stills Singer Songwriter podcast is CHANGE PARTNERS, also from that 2nd SOLO album.\n\nStills said “it was about growing up in Texas. Going to debutante balls, dancing and changing partners.”\n\nYou will hear a lovely pedal steel guitar. That is none other than Jerry Garcia on pedal steel guitar played throughout this song. This version released on Stephen Stills 2 was recorded in early ‘ 71 in Miami.\n\nPLAY M8\n\nAnd now, CHANGE PARTNERS\n\nDon’t Touch That Dial\n\nThat was M8\n\nChange Partners, (Stephen Stills), Stephen Stills 2, Atlantic Records LP, 1971\n\nSong credits M8\n\nAs far as song credits, again there are only general album credits,\n\nUpon further research, here is what I found on CHANGE PARTNERS::\n\nStephen Stills – vocals, guitars, keyboards, bass guitar, composer, arranger, conductor and producer•\n\nCalvin Samuels – bass\n\nDallas Taylor – drums\n\nJerry Garcia – pedal steel guitar on “Change Partners”\n\nGraham Nash, David Crosby, Henry Diltz, and Fred Neil on backing vocals.\n\nSTATS\n\nStephen Stills 2 album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200 and was certified as a gold record.\n\nTwo singles were released from the album,\n\n“Change Partners” peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart:\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis podcast on Stephen Stills EARLY YEARS -1966-1971 included 8 of his original compositions from 5 albums and singles.\n\nOF COURSE this ONLY SCRATCHES the surface of his great talent. There will be a subsequent podcast on STEPHEN STILLS.\n\nStills has combined record sales of over 35 million albums. He is a Hall of Fame inductee, in fact he was the first person to be inducted twice on the same night into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame – that was 1997.\n\nStephen Stills is 78 at the time of this podcast’s production. Neil Young is 77. Graham Nash is 81.\n\nSadly, we lost David Crosby earlier this year, at the age of 81.\n\nOn a lighter note, Judy Collins is 84.
