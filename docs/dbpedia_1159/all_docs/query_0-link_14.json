        "text": "Graham Nash will release A Life in Focus: The Photography of Graham Nash, a new book featuring art and photos from his personal archive, on Nov. 16.\n\nThe singer-songwriter — best known as a member of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and the Hollies — began taking photos at age 10, inspired by his father. A Life in Focus, available to preorder, features images captured on tour, abroad and with friends in the famed Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles.\n\nA press release notes that the collection showcases “intimate moments with family and friends,” including Joni Mitchell, Stephen Stills and Neil Young, among others. The book — which includes Nash’s personal reflections behind the visuals — is rounded out by a foreword from photographer and producer Joel Bernstein and a preface by filmmaker and journalist Cameron Crowe.\n\n“From a very early age, photography has always been an extremely important part of my life and has allowed me to express a different side of my personality than music,” Nash said in a statement. “In fact, I’ve been taking photographs longer than I’ve been making music.”\n\nNash recently looked into his musical archives for the 50th-anniversary box set of CSNY’s landmark LP Deja Vu. The May reissue bundled the original LP with four CDs of demos, unreleased studio recordings and alternate versions of tunes; one of those previously unheard tracks was a demo of Young’s “Birds” with Nash on the high harmony.\n\n“I know it’s just me and Neil doing it with his acoustic guitar, but that’s a beautiful piece of music,” Nash told Rolling Stone at the time of the reissue's release. “It’s me trying to be the best harmony singer I can be with somebody of the stature of Neil Young.\""
