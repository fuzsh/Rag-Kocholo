        "text": "Happy Birthday to the Monkees' Micky Dolenz, who turns 77 today (March 8th)!!! Micky Dolenz will always be best remembered for singing lead on such group classics as \"(Theme From) The Monkees,\" \"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone,\" \"Pleasant Valley Sunday,\" along with the Monkees' first two singles -- and chart toppers, \"Last Train To Clarksville\" and \"I'm A Believer.\"\n\nDolenz, the sole-survivor of the group, will honor his late-Monkees bandmates on tour this spring. The shows will mark Dolenz' first proper tour dates since the Mike Nesmith's death last December at age 78.\n\nThe trek, which is billed as \"Micky Dolenz Celebrates The Monkees,\" will spotlight the contributions of Mike Nesmith -- as well as those of Davy Jones and Peter Tork -- during the upcoming shows, said in a statement, \"I felt it was important to gather the fans and properly celebrate the lives of Davy, Mike, and Peter. People have been contacting me, requesting that I honor them in a way where the extraordinary impact of the Monkees can be properly acknowledged. We spent such a great deal of time together; they were like my brothers, and I want to share some of the great joy we had together.\"\n\nOn November 14th, 2021 Mike Nesmith wrapped up the final Monkees tour dates in L.A. with Micky Dolenz as part of the pair's farewell tour. Nesmith had been struggling with heart disease in recent years and in 2018 underwent quadruple bypass surgery.\n\nHe was the third of the Monkees to pass with Davy Jones dying from a sudden heart attack on February 29th, 2012 at age 66 and Peter Tork dying on February 12th, 2019 at age 77 following a decade-long battle with adenoid cystic carcinoma -- a rare cancer of the salivary glands.\n\nIn 2021 Micky Dolenz released a Mike Nesmith tribute album, titled Dolenz Sings Nesmith. The set was produced by Nesmith's eldest son Christian Nesmith, who also toured as part of his father and Dolenz' Monkees revue.Dolenz Sings Nesmith features songs written throughout Nesmith's career -- including his Monkees years.\n\nOver the years, Micky has appeared in such Broadway, regional, and touring casts of Elton John and Tim Rice's AIDA, Pippin', Grease, A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum, and Hairspray. In recent years he's also performed a solo revue of Monkees classics with his sister Coco.\n\nMicky Dolenz says that he isn't bothered by the ever present \"Monkee\" tag, mainly because he stopped reading his own press years ago: \"The press, whenever they do an article, of course, they want a long line. They want something to catch your eye, and there's nothing like the word 'Monkee' to do that. Y'know, I don't really pay much attention anymore to be honest. I never read articles that have been written about me. To be honest, I never listen to interviews, I never read reviews.\"\n\nMicky Dolenz Celebrates The Monkees tour dates (subject to change):\n\nMarch 19 - Manistee, MI - Little River Casino Resort\n\nMarch 25, 26, 27 - Miami, FL to Nassau, Bahamas - The Beach Boys Good Vibrations Cruise\n\nApril 5 - Nashville, TN - Ryman Auditorium\n\nApril 6 - Richmond, KY - EKU Center For The Arts\n\nApril 8 - Nashville, IN - Brown County Music Center\n\nApril 9 - Cincinnati, OH - The Andrew J Brady ICON Music Center\n\nApril 12 - Akron, OH - Goodyear Theater\n\nApril 13 - Joliet, IL - Rialto Square Theatre\n\nApril 15 - Riverside, IA - Riverside Casino & Golf Resort\n\nApril 16 - Madison, WI - Overture Center For The Arts\n\nApril 23 - Lancaster, PA - American Music Theater (with Felix Cavaliere's Rascals)\n\nApril 24 - Glenside. PA - Keswick Theatre (with Felix Cavaliere's Rascals)\n\nMay 12 - Red Bank, NJ - Count Basie Center (with Felix Cavaliere's Rascals)\n\nMay 14 - Patchogue, NY - Patchogue Theatre For The Performing Arts (with Felix Cavaliere's Rascals)\n\nJune 3 - New York, NY - Palladium Times Square (with Felix Cavaliere's Rascals)\n\nJune 4 - Lynn, MA - Lynn Auditorium (with Felix Cavaliere's Rascals)\n\nIt was 58 years ago tonight (March 8th, 1964) that the Dave Clark Five (DC5) made their debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. The group was the second British Invasion act to infiltrate the U.S. shores, following the Beatles. The DC5 originated from North London and had 17 records on Billboard's Top 40 between 1964 and 1967. They were best known for their string of '60s hits, including \"Glad All Over,\" \"Bits And Pieces,\" \"Because,\" \"Any Way You Want It,\" \"Catch Us If You Can,\" \"Over And Over,\" and \"Having A Wild Weekend.\" All told, the group racked up a total of 18 appearances on the Sullivan show -- more than any other musical act -- and all of them were reportedly lip-synched.\n\nOut on DVD is PBS' Great Performances: The Dave Clark Five And Beyond - Glad All Over. The documentary focuses on the Brit-pop path created by the DC5 and the Beatles, featuring filmed appearances by Paul McCartney, Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt, Stevie Wonder, Dionne Warwick, Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne, Gene Simmons, Tom Hanks, Whoopi Goldberg, '60s fashion icon Twiggy, among others.\n\nIncluded in the film are the DC5's' iconic performances on The Ed Sullivan Show, along with rare live concert footage and their countless appearances on television with American musical icons. Much of this material -- much of it on 35mm film -- has not been seen in decades, either on television or home video.\"\n\nBeatlefan magazine's executive editor Al Sussman says that the DC5 were clearly the Number Two British invasion act during the peak of Beatlemania: \"They were the Number Two group mainly because of the fact that -- first of all, they were the second group to come over here after the Beatles -- but also because they released a new record, like, every two weeks. They had, I think, seven singles that hit at least the Top 20 -- at least -- during the course of the year.\"\n\nSussman says that most people don't realize that although the Dave Clark Five are synonymous with the British Invasion, they were always far more popular in the U.S. than they were in their native Britain: \"What happened was, it became apparent very quickly to Dave Clark that they were much bigger here than they were in England. Because after 'Glad All Over' and 'Bits And Pieces,' they didn't have another big hit until 'Catch Us If You Can.' They appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show more than any other band at that time.\"\n\nDave Clark told us that the band's secret weapon was their lead singer, songwriter, and keyboardist, the late great Mike Smith: \"He didn't realize how good he was. I think I say that in the film. He had an amazing talent, Mike. I mean, he studied classical piano originally, so he was a musician. His dad got very disillusioned when he got his first job in a pub (laughs), y'know? But, it, it worked. He had a great voice, and he had a great look, y'know?\n\nLongtime fan Tom Hanks inducted the DC5 into the Rock Hall in 2008. In his speech, he explained that a few things which separated the band from the pack: \"The Dave Clark Five were sensations in particular ways, not the least of which was their eschewing of animals or minerals in their choice of name. The Dave Clark Five were one of the few British bands of the day that never replaced their drummer.\"\n\nThe group broke up in 1970, with Clark becoming a multi-millionaire music mogul. Although the band's material never made the switch from Top 40 to album oriented rock in the latter half of the 1960's, Clark explained that the DC5 actually influenced the harder-edged bands that followed in their wake: \"All the bands that were actually influenced by us -- I mean, (Bruce) Springsteen and Kiss and all, all heavy metal -- the Ramones. Y'know, I mean, the last song they ever played was ‘Any Way You Want It.' It's a totally different audience, I suppose, looking back, that it appealed to the Beatles or even the (Rolling) Stones.\" Stones\n\nIn 2003, the group's lead singer, keyboardist, and main songwriter, Mike Smith, was paralyzed after falling off his roof in Cadiz, Spain. In 2005, a fundraiser for Smith's medical bills was held in New York City, featuring the reunion of Peter & Gordon, Billy J. Kramer, the Zombies, and former Moody Blues and Wings member Denny Laine.\n\nSmith died just weeks before the band's 2008 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The previous December, the group's saxophonist Denis Payton died of cancer at age 63. On February 11th, 2013, bassist Rick Huxley died after a long battle with emphysema. Huxley, who grew up in Dartford, England -- the same town as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards -- went on to work for Vox amplifiers before moving on to his own music equipment and electrical wholesale businesses.\n\nFAST FORWARD\n\n2019 saw the release the Dave Clark Five's All The Hits. The 28-song set, which is available as a single CD and double-album set, features newly remastered sound by Dave Clark himself and London's legendary Abbey Road Studios.\n\nAmong the highlights on the collection are the DC5's most timeless tracks, including the band's signature hit \"Glad All Over,\" \"Bits And Pieces,\" \"Because,\" \"Any Way You Want It,\" \"Catch Us If You Can,\" \"I Like It Like That,\" \"You Got What It Takes,\" and their sole chart-topper, \"Over and Over.\"\n\nBritney Spears detailed the abuse she suffered at the hands of her family and demanded justice after returning to Las Vegas as a \"guest\" for the first time since her residency ended in 2017.\n\nAccording to TMZ, The \"Toxic\" singer wrote on Instagram Sunday (March 6th), \"Being a guest in Las Vegas is way better than being me…or wait…is it because my family got to be the stars when I worked in Vegas??? I mean damn they were given star treatment…spas…alcohol…the whole 9 years…but guest what!!! This was my first time! It was absolutely lovely being treated like an equal in Las Vegas for the first time in 13 years.\"\n\nThe post has since been deleted.\n\nShe continued writing about the way she was mistreated by her family in a subsequent post. Spears shared, \"In a world where it's okay to lock your daughter up and make her work 7 days a week … 8:00 am to 6:00 pm … no days off … 105 people are in and out of a small trailer home weekly … No private baths … seen naked when changing … drugged … can't even speak or talk … has to be available to the treatment people and show up every day for 10 hours a day … if not will have to stay longer … never given a date on when you can leave … 9:00 pm bed every night … like 8 gallons of blood weekly … this happened to me for 4 months after I worked for my dad and my family for 13 f---ing years … I gave my all when I worked only to be literally thrown away.\"\n\nThe pop star concluded, \"I want justice and won't stop until something is done to those who harmed me … and YES I was harmed !!!! This is a message to all who have been threatened for their life … You are NOT ALONE !!!!\"\n\nSpears and her fiance, Sam Asghari, stayed at Resorts World Las Vegas this weekend for UFC 272 Saturday (March 5th) night.\n\nWill Paul McCartney and the Rolling Stones divide British fans by making appearances at competing UK festivals??? Industry whispers are stating that the Stones are prepping for a June 25th return to Britain's Hyde Park BST Festival -- the same day the former-Beatle is set to headline Glastonbury. Britain's Daily Mail posted: \"No artist has yet been named to play that empty Saturday slot (at Hyde Park), but the site suggested that the artist headliner would be the Rolling Stones.\" If the Stones do sign on for the June 25th gig, their night will be bookended by respective appearances by Elton John and the Eagles.\n\nThe Stones' first Hyde Park gig took place on July 5th, 1969 and served as the band's tribute to late-co-founder Brian Jones -- as well as the live introduction of his replacement, Mick Taylor. The band returned to Hyde Park on July 6th and 13th, 2013, highlights of which were released on their Hyde Park Live collection.\n\nPaul McCartney last headlined Glastonbury in 2004 and had planned to play the 2020 festival before the Covid shut down. McCartney also played Hyde Park on June 27th, 2009.\n\nKeith Richards was an immediate fan and friend of the Beatles. He admits that following manager Andrew Loog Oldham's brief that the Stones become the opposite of the lovable \"Mop Tops\" was ingenious and important in separating the Stones from all the other British beat groups that followed in the Beatles wake: \"There was no competition between the bands, per se, y'know -- but in the greater world, the Beatles were the \"Fab Four,\" y'know? As I say, that's wearing the ‘white hat.' So the only other (laughs) place to go is to wear the ‘black hat' (laughs), y'know? And at the same time, we were pretty natural, and I think all we really did was, we didn't ‘showbiz' ourselves up.\"\n\nIn 2005 when the Stones performed as the Super Bowl's halftime act the year after Paul McCartney, he echoed John Lennon's 1970 statement that the Stones did everything the Beatles did a year later: \"It's not bitchy, but if you look at the career of the Beatles and the Stones, they always do stuff a year after we do. So we do Sgt. Pepper and about a year later they do Satanic Majesties, they do their psychedelic album. The Beatles come to America, about a year later the Stones do. So I like it. They're holding true to form.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg has recently revealed that Jay-Z threatened to end his NFL deal unless Dr. Dre, Snopp Dogg, etc. performed at the the Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show. During an interview with TIDAL, Snoop said, \"We love each other. Like, not secretly, like publicly, we love each other. It is what it is, so it's like for him to go to bat for us and tell the NFL, ‘F**k that. They perform or I quit,' that was the most gangster sh*t out of everything.\"\n\nThe NFL was also concerned about Snoop's onstage attire, but JAY-Z told him not to worry. Snoop explained, \"Then with attire and kneeling and all this … you can't wear your gangbang sh*t? JAY-Z hit me like, ‘Wear what the f**k you want to wear. Peace to the Gods.'\"\n\nSnoop said that he and Jay performed after the performance, saying, \"So then he came down, and soon as he came in he hugged me. We hug each other tight. It was as if we won a championship. Like, you know when you're genuinely happy for each other? People don't understand, me and him are the ones. He's the one on the East. I'm the one from the West.\"\n\nDR. DRE'S ATTORNEY CLARIFIES THAT HE STILL OWNS 'THE CHRONIC'\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Dre's attorney Howard King has released a statement claiming that his client still owns The Chronic despite recent comments that Snoop Dogg made where he told Complex that he owns Dre's debut album.\n\nKing told Complex earlier this week in a statement, \"There are false reports out regarding ownership by Death Row of Dr. Dre's The Chronic. Dr. Dre owns 100 percent of The Chronic.\"\n\nReports say that Kim Kardashian is not too happy about Kanye West's new video for \"Eazy.\" As previously reported, the video features a claymation version of Kim's boyfriend Pete Davidson being tied up, kidnapped and buried.\n\nAccording to People, Kim is \"furious\" about the video. A source said, \"She thinks it's way too violent and is upset. She really upset with Kanye that he'd do this. She's completely over all of this and she wants it to stop.\"\n\nThe source added, \"Kim's No. 1 concern right now is making sure that her children are protected from the situation because everything plays out in the public eye and that's very difficult when there are children involved. She is very angry about the violence and she just feels that it's inappropriate and wrong.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Davidson reportedly finds the video hilarious. The source told Entertainment Tonight, \"He finds the fact that Kanye included a cartoon version of him in his music video hysterical. He is almost flattered by it all because it is so ridiculous to him.\"\n\nThe source added that Pete \"is not threatened by Kanye in any way, shape or form.\"\n\nKanye responded to backlash of the \"Eazy\" video, saying, \"Art is therapy just like this view. Art is protected as freedom of speech. Art inspires and simplifies the world. Art is not a proxy for any ill or harm. Any suggestion otherwise about my art is false and mal intended.\"\n\nKANYE WEST SHARES FEELINGS ON KIM KARDASHIAN DIVORCE\n\nMeanwhile, Kanye took to social media to reveal his feelings on his divorce from Kim Kardashian. He posted aa poem via Instagram, saying, \"Divorce feels like your kids were snatched from your control/ Divorce feels like you've been shot and traffic is slow/ Divorce feels like heavy breathing/ Divorce feels like grandma never got over that cold/ Divorce feels like suffocating/ Barely breathing.\"\n\nLast week, due a judge ruling, Kim Kardashian was declared legally single and no longer has to go by \"Kim Kardashian West.\"\n\nGraham Nash says that estranged partner David Crosby was the first artist to raise a red flag regarding Spotify's gross underpayment to artists for their music streaming across the online platform. The disbanded Crosby, Stills, & Nash made a rare show of unity behind Neil Young when he demanded his music be taken off the streaming platform, accusing the service of spreading false information about Covid via Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\nNash gave credit where credit was due, saying that Crosby was the first to go public about the pittance artists were receiving through streaming: \"Crosby, basically on our behalf, has been rallying against Spotify because of the amount of money that they don't pay musicians. As a several-billion-dollar company, all they do is play other people's music and pay them very little. And then when Neil came upon Joe Rogan letting people express opinions saying that the vaccinations don't work and masks don't work, and all that stuff that Neil has been upset with Joe Rogan and we totally agree. And that's why we took our music from Spotify also. But it started out with Crosby talking about how much they didn't pay musicians.\"\n\nGraham Nash says that musicians predicted the digital revolution long before their record companies recognized it, by which time it was too late. Nash told us that it serves the record companies right for being so slow in understanding and embracing the new technology: \"We tried to tell the record companies that this digital revolution was coming and they took no notice of anybody, and so got stuck behind the 8-ball. And record companies, like, the big, y'know, CBS and Warner Brothers and all. . . don't exist anymore. They don't want physical product. They want it all to be a digital download.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen has just issued Quicken Loans Arena, Cleveland OH - 11/10/2009, the latest official bootleg of his ongoing monthly archive series. The show was culled from his 2009 trek behind his Working On A Dream album, which soon saw the E Street Band tackling full albums within their massive setlists.\n\nThe set marks \"The Boss'\" fifth dip into the soundboards from the tour, which has also seen the release of shows from Long Island's Nassau Coliseum, Manhattan's Madison Square Garden, Buffalo's HSBC Arena, and Philly's Wachovia Spectrum.\n\nIn addition to performing 1975's Born To Run in its entirety, Springsteen's 28-song-show features such highlights as \"Red Headed Women,\" \"Pink Cadillac,\" \"Back In Your Arms,\" and covers of Jackie Wilson's \"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher,\" an impromptu take on Elvis Presley's \"Can't Help Falling In Love,\" along with a show-closing rendition of \"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight).\"\n\nNew Jersey and its legendary shoreline have never been far from Bruce Springsteen's lyrics -- especially on his earliest albums. Springsteen always believed that although 1975's Born To Run album is not about the same person -- all the stories could definitely be intertwined: \"Born To Run has got that feeling of that one endless summer night. That's what the record, what the whole record feels like. It could all be taking place in the course of one evening in all these different locations, y'know? All these different stories on one, sort of, long summer night.\"\n\nWe asked Nils Lofgren what his favorite tune off of the Born To Run album is: \"Gosh, y'know, I love the whole album, but, it's weird 'cause it's a song I really don't get to play on, but 'Meeting Across The River.' We did it recently -- well we did it in Red Bank (New Jersey), one of Max Weinberg's Seven guys Mark Pender played trumpet and Gary (Tallent's) on bass. That's just a haunting beautiful piece I love off that record.\"\n\nThe tracklisting to Bruce Springsteen's Quicken Loans Arena, Cleveland OH - 11/10/2009:\n\n\"Wrecking Ball\"\n\n\"Prove It All Night\"\n\n\"Hungry Heart\"\n\n\"Working On A Dream\"\n\n\"Thunder Road\" - Born To Run album\n\n\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" - Born To Run album\n\n\"Night\" - Born To Run album\n\n\"Backstreets\" - Born To Run album\n\n\"Born To Run\" - Born To Run album\n\n\"She's The One\" - Born To Run album\n\n\"Meeting Across The River\" - Born To Run album\n\n\"Jungleland\" - Born To Run album\n\n\"Waitin' On A Sunny Day\"\n\n\"Raise Your Hand\"\n\n\"Red Headed Woman\"\n\n\"Pink Cadillac\"\n\n\"Back In Your Arms\"\n\n\"Radio Nowhere\"\n\n\"Lonesome Day\"\n\n\"The Rising\"\n\n\"Badlands\"\n\n\"No Surrender\"\n\n\"Bobby Jean\"\n\n\"American Land\"\n\n\"Dancing In The Dark\"\n\n\"Can't Help Falling In Love\"\n\n\"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher\"\n\n\"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers have just dropped \"Poster Child,\" the second single from their upcoming album, Unlimited Love. The album, which is set for release on April 1st, reunites the band with famed producer Rick Rubin.\n\nIn a new interview with Classic Rock magazine, the L.A. natives talk about the hair band scene that dominated the Sunset Strip as they were also making their bones in clubs around town. Flea remembered, \"We were definitely against the hair-metal scene. We were, like, 'F*** them. We're the underground, art-rock, get-weird east side guys; those guys are just rehashing Aerosmith and Kiss.' In retrospect it was all petty bull***. A lot of those bands were f***ing great. Guns N' Roses was a great band.\"\n\nFrontman Anthony Kiedis spoke about the difference between the Chili Peppers and the other bands coming up at the time: \"We were a party band, but you have to have something to bring to the party. Flea was instrumental in saying: 'We have to be good, we have to write some new s***, we have to have something to move these people.' We always came fully loaded.\"\n\nFlea explained, \"There was a certain arrogance. A 'F*** the world, f*** the system, f*** the authority, f*** the powers that be, we're us and we're doing our thing our way, we're street kids' thing. We were going hard and being wild.\"\n\nKiedis added: \"It didn't dawn on us that there was something other than selling out clubs and making people happy and being original.\"\n\nFlea told us a while back that their love of music has kept the Chili Peppers going through good times and bad: \"No matter what has happened, no matter how vulnerable and raw our pain, how much pain we went through or how much was good and we worked really hard and reaped rewards from it -- no matter what happened, we've always, like the thing that has remained really earnest and really humble is our love for music and our willingness to be students of music.\"\n\nIt was 52 years ago this week (March 7th to 13th, 1970) that Simon & Garfunkel's final studio album, Bridge Over Troubled Water, began it's 10-consecutive-week run on top the Billboard 200. The collection, which was the band's fifth and final set, displaced Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin III from the top spot.\n\nBridge Over Troubled Water was released on January 26th, 1970 and spawned four Top 20 singles -- \"The Boxer\" (Number Seven) -- which pre-dated the album by 10 months; \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" (Number One); \"Cecilia\" (Number Four); and \"El Condor Pasa (If I Could)\" (Number 18).\n\nThe album enjoyed an 85-week stay on the chart, and has been certified eight times platinum for sales of eight million units.\n\nThe tracklisting to Bridge Over Troubled Water is: \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"El Condor Pasa (If I Could),\" \"Cecilia,\" \"Keep The Customer Satisfied,\" \"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright,\" \"The Boxer,\" \"Baby Driver,\" \"The Only Living Boy In New York,\" \"Why Don't You Write Me,\" \"Bye Bye Love,\" and \"Song For The Asking.\"\n\n\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" won six Grammy Awards in 1971: Record Of The Year; Song Of The Year; Best Contemporary Song; Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s); and Best Engineered Recording; with the Bridge Over Troubled Water album snagging the coveted prize for Album Of The Year.\n\nArt Garfunkel recalled how the album's title track was tapped for single release, going on to top the singles charts for six straight weeks: \"You always knew the animal called 'the single,' and you knew what was an album piece that was really happening. This seemed the latter. As a single -- too slow, too long. Clive Davis came in the studio, President of CBS, and said, 'No, I wanna get behind it all the way. It's the title of your album. It is the first single. Be unapologetic about such a slow song, 'cause I'm gonna get behind it with faith.'\" SOUUNDCUE\n\nPaul Simon recently broke down the magic behind Simon & Garfunkel's classic sound: \"With Simon & Garfunkel, we would sing a take together on mic -- on one mic. And when we got the take that we wanted, then we would double it individually. I would sing my part individually on mic, and Artie would sing his individually on mic. And when you combine them together, and they would be, y'know, perfectly in sync; that's what Simon & Garfunkel sounded like. That's what the sound was.\"\n\nFAST FORWARD\n\nOut now is the digital EP, Simon & Garfunkel - Live At Carnegie Hall 1969. The newly-released tracks have been issued in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the duo's final album, the chart-topping Bridge Over Troubled Water, which dropped on January 26th 1970.\n\nAccording to the press release, \"Recorded in November 1969 during a sold-out two-night run at New York's Carnegie Hall, this new four-song EP captures Simon & Garfunkel's live magic at the height of the folk-rock duo's massive popular success. (The collection) includes previously-unreleased early live versions of 'Bridge Over Troubled Water,' 'So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright,' 'The Boxer' and 'Song For The Asking.' The recordings from Carnegie Hall capture early performances of songs that Simon & Garfunkel were introducing in concert to their fans.\"\n\nCoincidentally, the Carnegie Hall tracks -- which were recorded on November 27th and 28th, 1969 -- were taped on the very same nights the Rolling Stones were performing at Madison Square Garden and taping their legendary Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out live collection.\n\nStevie Nicks believes she inspired Prince's 1984 chart-topper \"When Doves Cry\" through her own 1981 hit single \"Edge Of Seventeen.\" During a chat with The New Yorker, Nicks spoke about coming up with the song's hook line featuring the phrase \"white-winged dove\" after being inspired by a menu on an airplane. She recalled, \"Coming from Phoenix to here. And who knew that the white-winged dove was this bird in Phoenix, or in Arizona, that made its home in the saguaro cactus, because it was protected in there? I didn't really know anything about doves or pigeons or whatever you want to call them. But they literally said, 'This bird, when it makes a sound, sounds like it's saying 'Ooh, ooh, ooh,' right?\"\n\nShe went on to say, \"I instantly went into writing that song, which then ended up being about Tom Petty and John Lennon and a bunch of people. But think about this: the white-winged dove really inspired Prince to write 'This is what it sounds like when doves cry.'\"\n\nNicks went on to talk about songwriting inspiration, revealing, \"I don't think that you pick your experiences in heartbreak. 'Gypsy' was about my friend who died (Robin Snyder Anderson). And that was the worst year of my life, y'know? But I wrote 'Gypsy' about it, and about her. Little bits of her are in a lot of my songs.\"\n\nShe added, \"So you can use the tragedy. 'Always been a storm' (from the Fleetwood Mac Tusk) song ('Storms') -- that I wrote about my best friend who moved in with my boyfriend, Mick (Fleetwood), and her husband had to call and tell me that. 'Sarah moved in with Mick, I just wanted you to know that.' And I jetted out the back door into the mountains and sat out there for three hours contemplating my future, 'cause, well, I just lost my best friend and I lost Mick, and I'm in a band with Mick, which means I can't just dump Mick.\"\n\nStevie Nicks explained to us that unlike many singer-songwriters, her music doesn't come from hours slaving over a piano: \"I write in a journal every night and most of my songs come out of the prose that I write in my journal. Then, I'll write a formal poem to some situation that I've written about. So, I have many, many, many long, two-to-three page formal poems that are ready to be made into songs. What I haven't done is, I don't take them to the piano until I know there's a reason to do it.\"\n\nRECORD STORE DAY HONOR\n\nPaul McCartney's McCartney III standout, \"Women And Wives\" has been named Record Store Day's \"Song Of The Year.\" The song, which will be released as a limited edition vinyl single on the 15th annual Record Store Day on April 23 and the June 18 RSD Drop, features McCartney's original version on the A-side, backed with previous RSD U.S. Ambassador St. Vincent's remix from the McCartney III Imagined album.\n\nIn a statement by Record Store Day co-founder Michael Kurtz, \"I was driving down a Montana highway one sunny, snowy morning when St. Vincent's imagined version of 'Women And Wives' came on Sirius Radio. I was stunned by the song's message of chasing the future. When St. Vincent's Jeff Beck-like guitar solo arrived at the end, I got goosebumps. This is a classic McCartney song, up there with some of his best. Record Store Day is thrilled that we can celebrate 'Women And Wives' as our Song of the Year with a side-by-side 12-inch record, old school style.\"\n\nLIVE SPOTIFY PLAYLIST\n\nPaul McCartney has just uploaded a new 10-song Spotify playlist on his official PaulMcCartney.com site. Every month \"Macca\" posts a new \"Sticking Out Of My Back Pocket\" tracklist with a specific theme and for March -- in celebration of his upcoming \"Got Back\" tour -- his team has selected live versions of his hits, deep album cuts, and concert fan favorites.\n\nAmong the tracks picked for this month's playlist include Wings' final chart-topper, \"Coming Up (Live In Glasgow)\" from 1980, \"Let Me Roll It\" from the 1974 One Hand Clapping soundtrack, \"Get Back\" from his 2007 Amoeba Gig set, a soundcheck performance of \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" from 1993's Paul Is Live, and the barnstorming \"Beware My Love\" from 1976's Wings Over America.\n\nA message to fans on the site reads in part:\n\nA Paul McCartney show is a once in a lifetime experience and if you're anything like us you'll be counting the days till he comes to your town - we're less than 60 days away from Paul's first live show of the year!\n\nSo whether you're making a custom sign for the show, dreaming up the setlist or already planning on what to wear; we've complied a playlist full of some of our favorite live performances. . . Get ready for GOT BACK with the live edition of the ‘Sticking Out Of My Back Pocket' playlist.\n\nPaul McCartney recalled the emotions behind writing \"Maybe I'm Amazed,\" which is arguably, his first solo classic: \"That was very much a song of the period. Y'know, when you're kind of in love with someone and -- God, it sounds, y'know, soppy, doesn't it? But, when you are in love with someone, it's new, like it was for me and Linda and the Beatles were sort of breaking up and stuff. That was my feeling.\"\n\nNearly 50 years after recording it, the Band On The Run Wings standout \"Let Me Roll It\" remains a highlight of Paul McCartney's live show: \"The nice thing about 'Let Me Roll It' for me, is having a sort of distinctive guitar riff. We used to do a lot of riffs in the Beatles -- and it's not easy to keep coming up with 'em, but that (sings guitar riff) -- and stand. . . Anyway, so, it's kind of that theatrical thing of that, that I like. And then the song it's a kind of slightly dramatic quality, where I used an echo that John used to use a lot. So, people thought the vocal sound was a bit like John Lennon -- it's the echo.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's Live Spotify playlist for March 2022:\n\n\"Get Back\" - Amoeba Gig\n\n\"Maybe I'm Amazed\" - Wings Over America\n\n\"The Mess (Live At The Hague)\" - Wings Over Europe\n\n\"Dance Tonight\" - Amoeba Gig\n\n\"Best Friend (Live In Antwerp)\" - Wings Over Europe\n\n\"I Wanna Be Your Man (Live In Sydney)\" - Paul Is Live\n\n\"C Moon\" - Amoeba Gig\n\n\"Beware My Love\" - Wings Over America\n\n\"Let Me Roll It\" (1974 'One Hand Clapping' version) - Band On The Run\n\n\"Coming Upon (Live At Glasgow)\" - McCartney II"
