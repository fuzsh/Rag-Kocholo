        "text": "In late May 1969, an album of folk-rock music with some stunningly beautiful songs was issued by a group named Crosby, Stills and Nash. It was their debut album, simply titled in their last names, Crosby, Stills & Nash. The three musicians, shown below – David Crosby, Graham Nash, and Stephen Stills – had each played previously with other groups. Crosby, with the Byrds, played guitar, sang and wrote songs; Stills, a guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist and songwriter with Buffalo Springfield; and Nash, a guitarist, singer and songwriter with The Hollies – all groups that had made hit songs and albums. By mid-1968, however, these three singer-songwriter-musicians came together forming a new group to make new music. And what good music it was – fashioning a distinctive and beautiful sound, along with a social statement or two as they went.\n\nLegend has it, that at a July 1968 party in Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles (at either Joni Mitchell or Cass Elliot’s house) Crosby, Stills and Nash tried out a new song written by Stills, “You Don’t Have To Cry,” revealing to themselves and others they had very good vocal chemistry and exceptional harmonies. Before long, excepting a rejection at Apple Records, they were signed by Ahmet Ertegün at Atlantic Records, hiring David Geffen and Elliot Roberts as their management team. Their new album came out in May 1969. And with the help of progressive FM radio in those days, which served up generous portions of new albums over the air, Crosby, Stills & Nash became a wildly popular album. The boys also added to their rising standing by performing at the enormous Woodstock music festival in August 1969, where Neil Young joined the group (later becoming “Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young”). Their performance at Woodstock — then the largest gathering at a rock festival to that date — helped place them among the leading troubadours of the counterculture era.\n\nIn the U.S., Crosby, Stills & Nash peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard album chart and had a 107-week stay on that chart. The album also spawned two Top 40 hits – “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” and “Marrakesh Express.”\n\n“Marrakesh Express” was released first, in July 1969. It’s a song by Graham Nash describing a Moroccan vacation he took in 1966 by train from Casablanca to Marrakesh – a song that was turned down by Nash’s earlier group, the Hollies, as not being commercial enough. Released with “Helplessly Hoping” on the B side, another song from the CSN album, “Marrakesh Express” would rise to No. 28 on the Billboard pop chart by August 23rd, 1969.\n\n“Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” is a song about Stephen Still’s former girl friend, folk singer Judy Collins. It’s the opening song on the album and was released as a single in September 1969 with “Long Time Gone” on the B side. It peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart by December 6, 1969 and also rose to No. 11 in Canada. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” at No. 418 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s “500 Songs That Shaped Rock & Roll.”\n\nOn the success of their break-out album, Crosby, Stills and Nash won a 1970 Grammy for Best New Artist. The album would continue to be a best seller in later years, earning a RIAA triple platinum certification in 1999 and quadruple platinum certification in 2001.\n\nIn one sense, the album was ground-breaking; its music in perfect step with the times. It set a new tone and would prove to be very influential in advancing the singer-songwriter movement of that era, and helped define a kind of “California” or “soft rock” sound that rose to prominence through the 1970s with groups and solo performers such as The Eagles, Jackson Browne, Joni Mitchell, and others. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Crosby Stills & Nash at No. 262 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In addition to its vinyl edition of 1969, it has been issued on compact disc three times: the mid-1980s, again in 1994, and as an expanded edition in 2006. Worldwide is has sold in excess of 6.5 million copies.\n\nAlthough the album’s two pop hits, “Marrakesh Express” and “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” are notable and worthy songs, there are other songs on the album that are arguably better – more beautifully written and performed, more entrancing, more melodic. Among two of these, for example, are “Guinevere” and “Lady of the Island” (“Guinevere” was initially spelled with two “n’s,” later corrected).\n\n“Guinevere”\n\nThe lyrics of “Guinevere” appear to be patterned, in part, after Queen Guinevere of King Arthur/Knights-of-the-Roundtable lore, using a Sir Lancelot-type perspective (who had an affair with the queen). However, Crosby has also explained the song has relevance to loves in his own life. Guinevere in the song is clearly the object of the singer’s affection.\n\nAccording to a Rolling Stone interview with Crosby: “That is a very unusual song, it’s in a very strange tuning with strange time signatures. It’s about three women that I loved. One of who was Christine Hinton, the girl who got killed [in an auto accident] who was my girlfriend, and one of who was Joni Mitchell, and the other one is somebody that I can’t tell. It might be my best song.” Elsewhere, Crosby has said of the song, “It’s three women – three verses, three different women…” – one of whom he promised he wouldn’t reveal.\n\nMusic Player\n\n“Guinevere”-4:40\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash\n\n1969\n\nhttps://pophistorydig.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Guinnevere.mp3\n\nGuinevere, in the song, provides glimpses of various behaviors and personality traits. The song also deals with the importance of freedom, with Guinevere described longingly by the male narrator as an inspiring beauty, but also as a free spirit, never quite attainable. “Why can’t she see me,” he asks as one point. And later, recalling a time “when we’d ride…down by the bay.” But in the end, it seems, free spirit prevails, with narrator accepting.\n\nThe music, in any case is, as one writer put it, “mesmerizingly beautiful,” and fans of this song have not been bashful about singing its praises.\n\nSome posted comments reacting to one YouTube airing of the song a few years ago are indicative of the impressions this song has left on many listeners:\n\nJudith Petree: “I still think this is one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded.”\n\nGuitar BS: “This song is so beautiful and haunting. The feeling described in this song doesn’t seem to exist in the 21st century. I dunno, I could be wrong but don’t think so.”\n\nBurt472: “One of the most beautiful songs of the last 2,500 years.”\n\nLimestonegoth: “I wore this album out on vinyl, mostly listening to this song over and over.”\n\nComer: “Is there any way to describe this song? I consider this one of the most perfect songs ever written. Nothing compares to it.”\n\nMike Kenwright: “One of the greatest songs ever recorded, I was around 23 when I first herd this track and it always makes my hair on my neck stand on end. The whole album is superb, but this track stands out from the others.”\n\nAdrienne Spy: “Still has the magic. This song will never age.”\n\nKealani: “Perfection. And no other song is anything like it. Crosby totally knocked it out of the ballpark with this one.”\n\nThundergod129-7307: “Call me a purist but this is the definitive version of this great ballad. Just David and Graham and a guitar. Pure Bliss…”\n\nMtjgw: “This song from 1969 is as timeless as they come. Was 11 then and now at 55, the full power of this piece resonates with me every time I hear it. I’m not sure music can ever be better than this as it truly sets the ‘Gold Standard!’.”\n\nTheDocrock100 says, “I constantly hit replay when I get this song on Pandora. Amazing harmony. Timeless.”\n\nRobert Scott adds: “…Always the song I need to hear when I haven’t listened to them for a while.”\n\nCrosby’s skills in writing and arranging “Guinevere” have been praised by Lindsay Planer in one review of the song at AllMusic.com, as follows below:\n\n“Although David Crosby’s contributions to the Byrds had hinted at the depth of his capacity as a singer/songwriter, it would take the calibre of material such as “Guinevere” to reveal his prowess as a true craftsman. This ballad musically spotlights Crosby’s intricate and highly inventive open chord structures. He possesses an uncanny sense of harmonics, which can be likened to that of Brian Wilson or, perhaps more aptly, jazz icon Thelonious Monk. “Guinevere” is likewise structurally designed to augment and support the equally complex vocal harmonies from he and Graham Nash.\n\n“The name “Guinevere” itself instantly conjures up romantic images of knights in shining armour and virtuous maidens fair. Lyrically, Crosby weaves those connotations with his own unique minstrel-like qualities — even incorporating the use of “m’lady” when describing the different muses that influenced his hauntingly beautiful verse.\n\n“The acoustic backdrop is sublime, providing ample space for the crystalline vocals to blend with the sparse instrumentation in an organic way. It also allows Crosby to demonstrate his amazing jazz influenced guitar playing.”\n\nAs for what musicians might hear in this song, consider the comments and reaction of Michael Kaulkin, a San Francisco based teacher and composer. Kaulkin has written about how he belatedly discovered “Guinevere” in 2006, quite by accident, when he was downloading “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,” the only CSN song he had previously known. His reaction to “Guinevere,” praising it highly in musical terms, follows:\n\n…What a gorgeous song! … It opens with an almost Sondheim-like chromatic vamp, which turns into a beautiful repeating Dorian-mode figure before the vocals come in. This use of modality is something in common with other music that I like, particularly Reich and early Adams. Do you think David Crosby was sitting around with the score to Ravel’s Mallarmé Songs, turning pages between bong hits?\n\nThen there’s the vocal writing. It’s your standard CSN three-part homophonic harmony at first, which is lovely as usual. But there’s a nifty mixing trick at the end of each verse. The two higher voices are faded in (muted trumpets if I were orchestrating it), holding D and F# (we’re in E dorian, by the way), and they step down in thirds, crossing the remaining voice who has the melody. Some wonderful dissonances result naturally from this, and it’s a terrific effect.\n\nThe melody is particularly expressive. It’s rhythmically complex in that it often avoids landing on the beat, which is something I find myself doing a lot in my own music. This is easy for a solo vocalist to pull off — Sinatra is most famous for it — but hats off to these guys for accomplishing it in three parts.\n\nFor those listening to this tune with a musical ear, Kaulkin advises: “…Stick with it until the end to hear those descending parallel thirds.”\n\nAnother noteworthy song on the Crosby, Stills & Nash album is “Lady of the Island,” a folk song written by Graham Nash. It is the second track on side two of the original edition of the Crosby, Stills & Nash album.\n\nLike “Guinevere,” this song is also a love song, in this case taking its inspiration from fellow folk musician Joni Mitchell, with whom Nash was romantically involved at the time. The lyrics describe the narrator’s impressions and feelings over the course of one or more intimate engagements between he and his lover.\n\nMusic Player\n\n“Lady of the Island”-2:39\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash\n\n1969\n\nhttps://pophistorydig.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lady-of-the-Island.mp3\n\nNash had come up with the melody/music for this song when he was with the Hollies sometime in 1968, but the lyrics weren’t quite there yet. They came later after he began working with Crosby and Stills.\n\n“When I came over to America and I started working with David and Stephen and Neil [Young] and Joni [Mitchell],” explained Nash in a later interview, “I noticed what words they were putting to their melodies and I realized that I would have to get serious about songwriting. I knew I could write melodies, but it was only after I came to America that I really got into changing the way I wrote songs.”\n\nOne listener at a YouTube posting of “Lady of the Island” using the name “Charleybones,” noted: “Nash and Crosby make a perfect vocal blend in this song. The sensitivity of Nash’s voice singing the words and melody, with Crosby singing harmony notes that perfectly flow around Nash’s voice. These two were always special together, and Stills simply added the bottom of the three- part harmony and the musicianship to help the other two flush out the instrumental side of their songs in order to produce them on record and in concert. This first CSN album was truly phenomenal….”\n\n“Wooden Ships”\n\nA third song from the Crosby, Stills & Nash album worth mentioning here is “Wooden Ships,” which is the first track on side two of the original album. It was written and composed in 1968 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on a boat owned by Crosby. The song was written by David Crosby, Stephen Stills, and Paul Kantner of the Jefferson Airplane, who also recorded a version of the song around the same time. Crosby composed the music, while Kantner and Stills wrote most of the lyrics.\n\nThe song came during the social upheavals of the late 1960s, and at the height of the Vietnam War. Bob Dylan by then had written several songs with anti-war sentiment, and his “A Hard Rain’s a Gonna Fall” was being heard in 1962 around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Barry McGuire’s “Eve of Destruction” came out in 1965. “Wooden Ships” was also aimed at the Cold War clench between the U.S. and Soviet Union and their nuclear arsenals – but in this case, what might happen in the aftermath of a nuclear exchange.\n\nMusic Player\n\n“Wooden Ships”-5:28\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash\n\n1969\n\nhttps://pophistorydig.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wooden-Ships.mp3\n\nThe song opens with a series of innocent-sounding guitar picks, landing on a loud and full guitar power riff, sounding at first confrontational and defiant, but then settling into a quieter story mode.\n\nThe lyrics depict the horrors of a post-nuclear war landscape. A man from one side stumbles upon another survivor, hoping for a smile as a sign of trust. He can tell by this survivor’s coat, he’s “from the other side.” Then he asks, perhaps with a shred of sarcasm, “Can you tell me, please, who won?”\n\nThe conversation then moves on to their survival and the sharing of “purple berries,” which appear safe; “haven’t got sick once” (re: nuclear fallout).\n\nThe narrative then turns to wooden ships on the water, those on board, and a sighting of “silver people on the shoreline,” who David Crosby has described as “guys in radiation suits” — authorities scouring the devastation, perhaps, or other survivors protecting themselves from fallout? In any case, those on the ships are “let be” by those on the shoreline.\n\nCrosby has noted that he and the other authors “imagined ourselves as the few survivors, escaping on a boat to create a new civilization.”\n\nIn the presumed departure of the ships then escaping the devastation, those on board look back in horror at those remaining, feeling helpless, “as all human feelings die.” Those aboard the ship are heading “away from this foreign land” – someplace unnamed, but “far away, where we might laugh again,” adding, “we are leaving, you don’t need us.”\n\nFor some listeners in that late 1960s early 1970s period, this music and verse no doubt resonated metaphorically regarding the tumult of those times. Some were then opting out of mainstream culture, seeking new values and alternative lifestyles. The year 1968, for example, from top to bottom was truly annus horribilis in the U.S. in terms of the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, presidential election tumult, as well as convulsive events abroad.\n\nThe Crosby, Stills & Nash album of 1969 also included “Long Time Gone,” a David Crosby song reacting to the July 1968 assassination of Robert Kennedy. And in May 1970, Neil Young was then with the group, and he wrote the CSN&Y protest song, “Ohio,” reacting to the National Guard shooting of student anti-war protesters at Kent State University (see separate story, “Four Dead in O-H-I-O.”). Other songs on the Crosby, Stills & Nash album of 1969 include: “You Don’t Have to Cry”( Stills), “Pre-Road Downs” (Nash), “Helplessly Hoping” (Stills), and “49 Bye-Byes” (Stills).\n\nDéjà Vu & Beyond\n\nClose on the heels of their success with the Crosby, Stills & Nash debut album, the group – now with Neil Young aboard – turned out another album titled Déjà Vu. It was released in March 1970 and rose briefly to No. 1 on the Billboard album chart. It also generated three Top 40 singles: “Woodstock” (written by Joni Mitchell), “Teach Your Children”, and “Our House.”\n\nDéjà Vu would become a monster hit album, selling over 14.3 million copies worldwide. In 2003 it would be ranked at No.148 on Rolling Stone‘s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, however, had their internal squabbles and artistic differences, and not long after a summer tour in 1970, they had an acrimonious parting of the ways. It would be the first of many such splits. They would break up and reform several times over the next few decades, sometimes with and without Neil Young. They split off into twosomes and solo acts (separate solo albums were issued by each member in 1970-71) and they would hold a number of reunion tours of one kind or another. Yet, they would continue to have a loyal fan base, as their touring and subsequent album sales would make clear. (Note: most album, record, and book images displayed in this story link to Amazon.com pages for those items. Click on images to go to those pages).\n\nFour Way Street, a live double album issued after their first breakup in 1970, became another No. 1 hit (8.7 million worldwide). In 1974, they re-formed for a summer stadium tour, but did not cut a new record. Still, a compilation album was released – So Far – and it too became a No. 1 album, their third straight (10.2 million worldwide).\n\nIn 1977, Crosby Stills & Nash re-formed without Young for the album CSN, another giant hit (6.8 million worldwide). They followed that album in 1982 with Daylight Again (2.4 million worldwide). By the mid-1980s, however, David Crosby was in the throes of drug addiction and some legal problems, landing in jail during 1985-1986. But he cleaned up his act and returned to the music scene.\n\nIn 1988, CS&N along with Young this time, reunited for what would become only their second studio album, American Dream (1.8 million worldwide). Two years later, CS&N followed with Live It Up, which was not a commercial success, though the trio remained a popular live act. CS&N embarked on a 25th anniversary tour in the summer of 1994 and released a new album, After the Storm (200,000 worldwide).\n\nThe trio reunited with Young once again for 1999’s Looking Forward (600,000 worldwide), followed in 2000 by their CSN&Y2K tour. A decade or so later, CSN 2012, a DVD/CD set, filmed and recorded during a 2012 tour, was released that same year. As of early 2017, there appeared to be the possibility that Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young were at least open to the idea of reforming yet again. In any case, they have certainly made their mark musically over the last 50 years or more.\n\nLauded for their lasting influence on U.S. music and culture, both for kicking off the singer-songwriter movement that soared throughout the 1970s, and their sterling, indelible harmonies, Crosby, Stills & Nash were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. All three members of the group were also inducted for their work in other groups – Crosby for the Byrds, Stills for Buffalo Springfield, and Nash for the Hollies. Neil Young, meanwhile, with an amazing body of work on his own and with other groups, has also been inducted as a solo artist and as a member of Buffalo Springfield.\n\nThere is a lot more detail on the history and biography of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young – both together and as solo artists.

The film stars Tom Hanks, who plays dying AIDS victim and young lawyer Andy Beckett who is wrongly fired from his job at a prestigious law firm.\n\nMusic Player\n\n“Streets of Philadelphia”\n\n(scroll down for lyrics)\n\nhttps://pophistorydig.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/bruce-springsteen-streets-of-philidelphia1.mp3\n\nSpringsteen’s song, “The Streets of Philadelphia,” is a haunting, powerful tune that captures the pain and tragedy of AIDS — the immune system disease formally known as “acquired immune deficiency syndrome.”\n\nIn the film, the song is used in the opening credits, played over street scenes of Philadelphia as the story opens with Hanks as rising young lawyer Andy Beckett working at a highly-regarded private law firm.\n\nBut the power of Springsteen’s song, which fit the movie well, went beyond the film’s airing. For some, the music later helped recall particular movie scenes, and for others, their own experiences with AIDS victims. In its day, the film, and the “Streets of Philadelphia” song, helped provide a much-needed and more sympathetic understanding of AIDS victims and the epidemic. Tom Hanks received an Oscar for his performance in the film, while the Springsteen song won an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and four Grammys.\n\nReleased in early 1994 as a single, and also on the movie soundtrack, the “Streets of Philadelphia” became a top-of-the-charts hit, peaking at No.9 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and reaching No.1 in several European countries including France, Germany, Ireland and Norway. Along with the soundtrack, sales of the song exceeded one million copies worldwide. There was also a music video made for the song in which Springsteen is featured walking through the streets of Philadelphia with a short appearance by the Tom Hanks character as well.\n\nThe song itself has spare musical sound, using a single drum beat at its opening, then merging with an organ/synthesizer, Springsteen’s vocals, and some nice, light backing by a male chorus. The lyrics and arrangement do the rest, making for quite a powerful rendition, especially with lines, such as: “Ain’t no angel gonna greet me, it’s just you and I my friend.” Or, “I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin…”\n\nHelping the song’s exposure through 1994 and early 1995 were three Springsteen performances during high-profile, prime-time TV shows: the Hollywood Academy Awards in March 1994; the MTV Music Video Awards in September 1994; and the Grammy Awards in March 1995. Tens of millions saw the song’s performance on those shows.\n\nBy then, millions had also seen the film and “Streets of Philadelphia” had also racked up various music awards: a Golden Globe for Best Song; an Oscar for Best Song; four Grammy awards (Best Song, Best Rock Song, Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, Best Song Written for a Motion Picture); and finally, an MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film.\n\nCritics generally had high praise for the film, some noting the effects of its music. Jonathan Demme, the director (Melvin and Howard, 1980; The Silence of the Lambs, 1991), had a particular strategy in mind regarding the film’s music. Demme wanted people not familiar with AIDS to come to the film, and felt that rock musicians contributing to its score might help bring an audience that would not ordinarily come to film about a gay man dying of AIDS.\n\nDemme had first thought about using a song like Neil Young’s “Southern Man” for the film’s opening sequence. But he later decided not to use Young’s music at the opening, and kept looking for other possibilities. However, Young would write and perform another quite moving song used at the film’s ending wake scene and gathering of friends. More on that later.\n\nStill needing an opening song, Demme asked Springsteen to do it. Working from his home studio in New Jersey in the summer of 1993, Springsteen produced a piece using lyrics he had previously written about the death of one of his friends. Not quite satisfied with what he came up with, and finding a rough fit with a rock beat, Springsteen nevertheless sent an early, unfinished demo to Demme for a listen. Demme liked what he heard and the piece soon became part of the film. (Trailer for the film follows below for those who may not be familiar with its subject and story line).\n\n“Streets of Philadelphia” is perhaps the most memorable tune that came from the film. But Demme also used other music throughout the movie to enhance and imprint its message. In one quite memorable scene, Hanks’ Beckett character is in the advanced stages of AIDS, but is preparing for his court appearance in a meeting at his home with his attorney, played by Denzel Washington.\n\nHanks/Beckett is taking on-going treatment for his illness, and during this meeting he is tethered to a mobile IV unit as the Italian opera Andrea Chénier is playing in the background. Maria Callas is singing “La Mamma Morta.” Hanks, moving around the room attached to the IV unit, proceeds to make an emotional interpretation of the opera song, line by line, for Washington, who is moved and shaken by the episode as he leaves Hanks that evening. Film critic Roger Ebert explains:\n\n“…Washington isn’t an opera fan, but as the music plays and Hanks talks over it, passionately explaining it, Washington undergoes a conversion of the soul. What he sees, finally, is a man who loves life and does not want to leave it. And then the action cuts to Washington’s home, late at night, as he stares sleeplessly into the darkness, and we understand what he is feeling.”\n\nAt the end of the film, too, sometime after the Hanks character has succumbed to AIDS, there is another powerful and moving scene that is amplified by its music. The setting is at a gathering of friends at a private residence paying their respects to Andrew Beckett’s family and friends for their loss, captured by the video clip below.\n\nAs the camera pans the room of guests, friends are shown arriving and greeting one another, some embracing family members for their loss. After a time of panning around the room showing the guests, the camera then begins to slowly zoom in on a video monitor that is playing a loop of home movies with the Hanks’ character as a child. In the background is the voice of Neil Young, accompanied only by a spare piano. Young sings plaintively in what has been described as his “lost-little-boy” voice. He sings a gentle song with lyrics that cover a lifetime — from childhood and sexual discovery ( “When we were boys and girls / And the secrets came unfurled”), to the grown man’s final fight with AIDS and his community ( “City of brotherly love / Place I call home / Don’t turn your back on me / I don’t want to be alone”).\n\nThe Young song — titled “Philadelphia” — was also nominated for the Best Song Oscar in the same year with “Streets of Philadelphia,” which took the prize. Demme generally won praise for “book-ending” his film with the two moving, contemporary songs rather than using the more traditional classical scoring.\n\nIn the end, Philadelphia went a long way in helping to increase AIDS awareness while removing some of the disease’s social stigma. The film was one of the first Hollywood productions to make AIDS its primary subject, and is historically important for that reason. Now more than 25 years old, Philadelphia and its music seem to hold up quite well with each passing year.\n\nAdditional stories on film music at this website include: “The Saddest Song,” a story which tracks the history and impact of Samuel Barber’s “Adagio for Strings” and the powerful use of that music in film scores for Elephant Man (1980), Platoon (1986), and other films; “Philadelphia Morning, 1976-77″, a story about an underrated but highly effective song from Bill Conti’s popular score for the first Rocky film; and Carly Simon’s rousing “Let the River Run,” the theme song for the 1988 film, Working Girl.\n\nOther stories at this website exploring the use of music in film include: Mickey & Sylvia’s 1957 song, “Love is Strange” and The Contours’ 1962 song, “Do You Love Me?” (both used in the 1987 film, Dirty Dancing); and the Righteous Brothers’ songs “You’ve Lost That Lovin` Feelin`” used in Top Gun (1986), and “Unchained Melody,” used in Ghost (1990).\n\nThanks for visiting – and if you like what you find here, please make a donation to help support the research and writing at this website.
