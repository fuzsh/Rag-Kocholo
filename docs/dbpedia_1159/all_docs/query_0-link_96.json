        "text": "Live Nation Urban and TCG Entertainment are teaming up to pay tribute to Prince with the 35-city tour titled “4U: A Symphonic Celebration of Prince. It is the first and only official Estate approved symphonic presentation of Prince’s music. The setlist and orchestral arrangements have been curated by avid Prince fan Questlove of The Roots, with input by Brent Fischer, Grammy Award-winning arranger.\n\nBy The Iconic Prince, September 22, 2018\n\nThere could not have been a more regal setting befitting a Prince than the Kings Theater, Brooklyn for “4U: A Symphonic Celebration of Prince,” curated by Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson and approved by The Prince Estate. Everyone entering its hallowed halls was undoubtedly aware that its opulence and grandeur matched the magnificence and splendor of the Man of Honor who was about to be celebrated in grand style. Cameras panned the interior of the theatre and stage, and obligatory selfies to commemorate this auspicious occasion were taken.\n\nBefore the start of the show, songs from deep within the catalog (“After Hi School,” by The Time and “All Day, All Night” by Jill Jones, among others) fill the arena, as members of the Wolf Trap Orchestra skillfully assemble their equipment and assume their positions. Patrons are stthe way to their seats with a mix of reverence and awe.\n\nThen comes the moment everyone is awaiting as Questllove’s voice booms:\n\n“This is Questlove and Welcome to 4U: A Symphonic Celebration of Prince. I curated this show to pay homage to one of the greatest musicians of our times with an entirely new vibe – with a symphony orchestra. The first part of this show we’ll go deep into his hidden gems. I picked all the songs in this category I know you’re going to like. Second half of the show we chose the hits. I know this is a symphony but if you to get up and dance and sing and celebrate him, that’s cool with us. Sit back and let’s go on a journey.”\n\nA lone violinist opens with a dramatic lead-in that spoke of the marvel that is to come as the arena falls silent, followed by a collective whoop and his voice, like that of an angel, sings “For You” (as has been used to open concerts in the past creating for a case of Déjà vu) then his booming voice speaks the words:\n\n“I tend to have a great affection for people who respond to music like I respond to music with the deepest of love and appreciation…”\n\nLadies and Gentleman, Prince is in the building.\n\nThe “thump, thump, thump” introducing “Controversy” follows quickly on the heels of “For You” and whips everyone into a frenzy, bobbing heads, moving hands, and from that point on it is impossible to sit still. Musical samples, à la Prince concerts, come fast and furious: “Something in the Water,” “Computer Blue,” “Automatic,” and, at this point Prince emerges on screen dancing with members of The Revolution” and the images are irresistible and poignant.\n\nThe symphony continues with its rising and falling crescendo and Clare Fischer’s influence is deeply felt. Fischer began working with Prince in 1982, assisted by his son Brent Fischer, who went on to become a Grammy Award-winning arranger. Their influence can be felt on “Sign O’ The Times,” “Graffiti Bridge,” “Parade,” “Under The Cherry Moon” and “Batman.” It is obvious why Questlove invited Brent Fischer to be a part of this incredible event.\n\n“It Ain’t Over Until the Fat Lady Sings” plays, signaling that there is so much more to come, and that’s when the real fun begins with footage of Prince dancing in “Under the Cherry Moon” and looking decidedly old-school glamor and Charlie Chaplinesque. This is played in conjunction with “Christopher Tracy’s Parade” and one can certainly recognize Prince’s affinity for humor and acting as his playful antics unfold on screen.\n\n“New Position,“ and “I Wonder U,” are performed to the accompaniment of graphics and lyrics splashed on screen feature “The Beautiful Ones.”\n\nA galaxy of stars on screen is a reminder that Prince has taken his rightful place in the Heavens, among the stars, where he rightfully belongs.\n\nLyrics are still being shown on screen, one prominent line reads, “If we cannot make babies maybe we can make some time.”\n\n“I Wonder U” goes on for an extended period of time after which Prince’s voice, as heard on the Larry King Live show, says:\n\n“I pretty much wanted to be dependent upon God. And when you get the inner calling to do something and you know that you’re being inspired by God, you pretty much know you’d better answer that call or suffer the consequences.”\n\n“Nothing Compares 2 U” renders everyone even more speechless as beautiful images of Prince from “Lovesexy” and “Under the Cherry Moon” eras fill the screens, one on either side, followed by more “Parade” footage featuring Prince, Tricky and the entire cast. Emphasis is placed on Prince’s sense of humor as he and Tricky have a good laugh at the expense of Mary Sharon who is having a hard time pronouncing “Wrecka Stow.” Hearing this song get the symphonic treatment from a violinist, who has distinguished herself by putting on a stellar show, ups the ante even more, and the audience gives a rapturous applause.\n\n“Venus de Milo” brings cheers and a feeling of sweet nostalgia, both for its delivery and visual accompaniment of Prince as a young boy, and Prince with Morris Day and others.\n\n“Venus de Milo” continues lulling everyone into a sense of complete bliss, only to be awakened by the rush of “Alexa de Paris,” the visual display revealing Prince’s draft of a proposed symbol with the notes “Can we see one like this?” that would become his actual symbol. The draft matches perfectly the finished symbol hovering over the stage in bright purple for the first part of the show.\n\n“The Beautiful Ones” gets a rise out of everyone as it usually does,” as Glam Slam visuals, and Love God’88 signature come into focus on double screens followed by footage of Prince dancing and smiling.\n\nHearing “The Beautiful Ones” in symphony is an indescribable experience, but suffice it to say that it is heavenly.\n\n“All my Dreams” by Prince and The Revolution and “1999” round out the first part of this celebration. The main violinist brings this part to an energetic and climactic end as she sings 1999 and plays her instrument with much aplomb and finesse, and the audience joins in on the action.\n\nPART II – THE HITS\n\nPart II begins with a visual of Prince’s back showing “3121” but this is just a tease. The symbol turns from Purple to Gold, perhaps demonstrative of a new age. A saxophonist plays a soulful lead-in to “Let’s Go Crazy” and the crowd goes wild as “Purple Rain” footage explodes on screen. There is clapping, and singling, and a hollering. Just when you think the song is over, you’re in for a surprise, much the same way gospel choirs sing the refrain repeatedly, and everyone goes crazy for a second go-around of what would be a fantastical climax with screaming violins. The symphonic treatment of this song brings out more of the spiritual flavor for which it was originally created.\n\nHere Prince talks about Uptown being a state of mind, not a place.\n\n“When Doves Cry” is heavy on the horns and features the entire video of Prince and The Revolution graphically enhanced. This is followed closely by “Little Red Corvette” and appropriate video footage that ends with that spectacular bathtub scene and rapturous applause. Drums signal the beginning of “Erotic City” and that pulsating beat brings some of the patrons to their feet.\n\nPrince speaks: “One thing I’d like to say is that I don’t live in a prison. I am not afraid of anything. I haven’t built any walls around myself, and I am just like anyone else. I need love and water, and I’m not afraid of a backlash because, like I say, there are people who will support my habits as I have supported theirs.”\n\nA “Starfish & Coffee” teaser seems to take everyone by surprise, and they are happily singing along and clapping, much to the delight of some of the orchestral band members who are able take in the audience for a change.\n\nPrince with an Afro appears on screen and creates for such a beautiful sight. The main violinist doubles as a vocalist, and does a great job inciting the crowd to follow her lead singing, “Take Me with You.”\n\n“Raspberry Beret” allows for that foot-stomping and hand-clapping action then ends in a rising crescendo leading directly into “Baby, I’m a Star,” which shows footage of Prince performing Live from Landover, Maryland during the Purple Rain tour bedecked in white lace. A judicious amount of this video is shown and the joy and laughter this video evokes is contagious. There are many false starts and stops, as is the norm when Prince entertains, much to the delight of everyone who just can’t get enough. The symphony mirrors the performance, in that it goes on and on, never looking the worse for wear.\n\nThe symphony orchestra takes it up a notch. Prince is dancing, impersonating James Brown and saying “Good God.” And off he goes again, moving across the stage, taking off his shirt, dancing up a storm and having a rollicking good time.\n\nGimme one, gimme, two y’all, gimme three, gimme 4 Mama. and then comes the biggest part of the evening – the part we’ve all been waiting for but never wanted to come so soon.\n\nIt is Purple Rain, with its magical violins, building up to what would be the sweetest song I have ever heard, that of Prince playing the guitar and singing “Purple Rain” while the band accompanies him softly, giving him center stage. He sings:\n\nI never meant to cause you any sorrow\n\nI never meant to cause you any pain\n\nI only wanted to one time to see you laughing\n\nI only wanted to see you\n\nLaughing in the purple rain\n\nPurple rain, purple rain\n\nPurple rain, purple rain\n\nPurple rain, purple rain\n\nI only wanted to see you\n\nBathing in the purple rain\n\nWhen the purple rain begins to fall from the heavens, bathing Prince in its wake, you are once again reassured that all is well with his soul. That he is among the angels, up on high, among the stars, dancing and singing in the Purple Rain.\n\nCynthia Horner Right On January 1979\n\nPrince is a mystery man. His record company biography is a collection of information similar to a Right On! fact sheet. It simply tells his name (the name he chooses to use), his age, and the fact that he’s the youngest producer in the history of Warner Bros. Records.\n\nWhen you finally meet him; he’s still a mystery. It’s no wonder that Right On! (one of his favorite magazines) is one of the few publications that’s granted the opportunity to meet him, because those who have, have gone away unsatisfied? Because Prince refuses to talk about himself. Getting answers from him is like trying to pry open a clam.\n\nIt’s not that he’s trying to keep himself a mystery, he just doesn’t have much to say. Sometimes it’s because he’s being a tease, and other times because he really doesn’t know what to say.\n\nWhen I was sitting in a recording studio listening to him play an intricate piece of music on equipment I’ve never even seen before, I was amazed at the talents this young genius possesses. His finesse on these instruments is better than musicians twice his age. Sunglasses temporarily hide his resemblance to one of the Sylvers, but outside in the bright sunlight, your struck by his handsome looks, his wistful, longing expression, and his glorious head of hair. Surprisingly, this strong masculine figure is really short—no more than about 5’2″ probably.\n\n“Prince’s home is in Minneapolis, Minn., a city, not typically known for producing music giants the way California and New York churn them out. His musical background consists of piano playing father (the person who insisted his first name be Prince) and a mother who sings. No, he didn’t grow up taking music lessons. “I took one piano lesson and one guitar lesson/’ he recalls. “I didn’t learn anything. I taught myself.”\n\nThinking back, he laughs for a second and reveals a tiny part of his nature. “I’m stubborn,” he said, his brown eyes boring right through me. ”I took a few music classes in school but mainly, I worked on my own.”\n\nAs the amazing success story unfolds I find it necessary to tell you that Prince not only wrote, composed, arranged, and produced all the tunes on his debut album, For You, but he also played all the instruments. Funny that he never had. anybody teach him how to use any of them. When questioned about the amount of instruments he plays, he shrugs nonchalantly and says, ’I don’t know, I never counted. I am learning to play the flute, though,” he offered.\n\nA teenager’s deep immersion into the recording business is indeed rare. While other young men are exploring the wonder of the opposite sex or trying to prepare themselves for a career, Prince was creating an album which was so exciting, that it immediately drew interest from multiple record companies. The fact that his parents aren’t musical giants on a level of Maurice White or a Stevie Wonder makes it even more of a phenomenon. His personal manager Owen Husney, the person Prince turns to the most, explains.\n\n“Prince is from a regular family, depending on how you define ‘regular,’ Compared to having been born in a Maurice White family, yes. But I think that the best thing Prince had was that he knew how to work with the right people intuitively in making the kinds of decisions that furthered him. This know-how helps him get to the right places at the right time.’’\n\nBesides being at the right place at the right time, Prince’s self-confidence (even though outwardly he appears to be very withdrawn and reticent) has taken him to unbelievable heights. After all, how many musicians would be bold enough to produce their very first album?\n\nAs Prince sees it, “I thought I knew my material better than any other producer and it seemed like I was best suited for the job,”\n\nObviously, Warner Bros. agreed since there was no hesitation in allowing this Gemini to produce his package the way he saw fit. In fact, his disco tune “Soft And Wet” which incidentally, is one of the tunes he sent to the record companies on demo tapes, is rapidly climbing record charts as well as being played constantly. How does he feel about it?\n\n“It doesn’t seem like me,” Prince admitted, moistening his lips. Without meaning to, he does it very sensually. “Mainly because where I live is kind of isolated from the musical scene in itself. I can only tell what’s going on from reading magazines. When I hear ’Soft And Wet’ on the radio, it seems like someone else is singing.”\n\nI’m inclined to agree because even though Prince, the singer, belts out his tune in a very high falsetto tone, his speaking voice is low and deep.\n\nOn a not-so-serious side, I ask Prince what are his interests besides music? Not a bit hesitantly, he replies, “Women, all kinds.” When prodded, he elaborates, “I like the ones with nice personalities.”\n\n“Do you get out much?”\n\n“No. Not really.”\n\n“What age range of young ladies do you like?”\n\n“It doesn’t matter.”\n\nWhat are some of his “favorites”? He ponders but can’t think of any special activities or movies.\n\nNo favorite musicians either because as he puts it, “I haven’t had a lot of time to develop a favorite artist. I try not to listen to too many people. It’s distracting.”\n\nSpoken like a dedicated musician.\n\n“What kinds of clothes do you like to wear?”\n\n“I hate clothes.”\n\nThen you Probably seldom shop.”\n\n“Well, no, not really, somebody goes for me.”\n\nHe looks down at his slacks and his nearly open-to-the-navel shirt over which a scarf rests fashionably.\n\n“And foods?”\n\n“Mashed yeast,” he says seriously, with eyes sparkling in humor. “I don’t know,” he laughs.”\n\n“You just like to play around. Now tell me some of your favorite foods.”\n\n“Bubble yum.”\n\n“Okay, you win,” I tell him. “Tell me what your favorite subjects were in school besides music and I’ll stop.”\n\n“Dismissal,” he says. “I didn’t like school or sports. Only when I was younger.”\n\nHas success changed the Minneapolis boy wonder?\n\nHe shakes his head no. “But it changes everybody else,” ,he observed. “How they treat you. It’s not bad though,” he screws up his brow trying to figure out how to explain the phoniness of people involved with show business. “I don’t dislike it yet. The only thing I have disliked is the late hours. Not that I like to go to bed early, it’s just that when I’m working, it gets pretty weird.”\n\nWhen told he’s becoming a sex symbol probably faster than he’s becoming a respected musician, his eyes naively widen in amazement. He’s not sure how he feels about it but he does know he won’t be getting married soon. When? “By the time I’m ready to get married, there won’t be marriage,” he said philosophically. “Probably in the year 2066.”\n\n“I wouldn’t mind having a child though, a test tube baby,” he said looking at me through those , that could turn a body to jelly.\n\n“And I just want to say one last thing,“ added, taking over the tape recorder ” I really want to thank everybody for buying my album.”\n\nAfter all, it was written for you!\n\nPrince is funny. That may sound like too basic a descriptor for one of the most iconic, eccentric, and enigmatic pop artists of our time, but after spending several hours with him last night at Paisley Park I was left thinking that he is really, really funny. It’s rare that more than five minutes goes by without Prince cracking a joke, and there was something contagious about observing the sheer joy and bemusement with which he experiences everything around him.\n\nI got the call to visit Paisley Park last minute, as is Prince’s style. The drummer for Prince’s early ‘80s band the Revolution, Bobby Z, emailed around dinnertime to invite me out to Paisley Park to hear new music from 3RDEYEGIRL’s forthcoming album, Plectrum Electrum. I RSVP’d yes.\n\nPrince and 3rdEyeGirl at Paisley Park March 30, 2014\n\nIt was approximately 10:59 p.m. when I pulled up to the front of Paisley Park, which was lit up with purple lights. Bobby Z himself was talking at that moment on the Current, setting up the song “Let’s Go Crazy” with an anecdote I had just recorded with him in the studio last week, and then there he was in the parking lot, waiting for me outside Prince’s glowing purple complex as the squealing opening guitars of that song filled my car. I parked, walked over to Bobby, held my breath, and did everything in my power to stay calm as he and I walked inside. It became quickly apparent that we had driven two of the only cars in the parking lot and might be the only guests for whatever was about to unfold.\n\nBobby and I were ushered into the smaller of Paisley Park’s two live performance rooms, a narrow little space with a stage on one end, a row of oversized plush purple chairs and tables along one side, and a commercial kitchen in the back. The three members of Prince’s band 3RDEYEGIRL–drummer Hannah Ford, guitarist Donna Grantis, and bassist Ida Nielsen—were already in the room, along with a few members of Paisley’s house band and the facilities manager. As 3RDEYEGIRL poured glasses of wine we were also joined by Taja Sevelle, an artist and songwriter who was signed to Paisley Park Records back in the ‘80s, and her husband, who happened to be in town visiting family.\n\nNot long after the small group started mingling, Prince himself appeared with his new protégé, who was introduced simply as Marissa. He was casually dressed in a stretchy black pantsuit, ornate necklace, and black platform sandals, and he took a moment to shake hands with each person and insist that we “make ourselves at home.” Everyone had gigantic smiles across their faces.\n\nWe went over and sat at one of the tables for a moment—a long, dark oval table with these comically gigantic plush purple chairs that seemed straight out of Alice in Wonderland. I felt like a little kid pulling the tall chair out away from the table so I could sit down. A DJ blasted music overhead—a sparse solo Prince track I hadn’t heard before followed by Earth, Wind & Fire—while the movie Finding Nemo played on two gigantic screens in the room. After a few minutes Prince popped around to the side of my chair and said, “Let’s all go to Studio B.”\n\nAs soon as we got up to start walking Prince fell into step alongside me.\n\n“I saw what you and Bobby did today,” he said. I knew he must be referring to the 30th anniversary Purple Rain blog post that I had published earlier that day, which contained quotes from Bobby about each of the album’s tracks.\n\n“Oh?” I said. “What did you think about that?”\n\nHe shrugged and rolled his eyes. “I don’t know why people need to do that. To look back on the 30th year of something. When else would we talk like that?”\n\n“You don’t like anniversaries?” I asked, immediately realizing what a dumb question that was given his thoughts on birthdays.\n\n“Why would anyone want to talk like that? Unless you’re married, I guess, or have a high school reunion.” He turned behind him and teased Bobby in a playful, high-pitched tone. “Bobby, do you remember when we went to high school together?” He turned back to me. “Why do people do that? I guess they don’t have anything interesting happening in their lives. I’m not interested in looking back. I’m too busy doing this.”\n\nAnd with that he ushered me into Studio B. “Sit anywhere you’d like,” he said, and I chose one of the more inconspicuous spots on a plush red couch with perfect little tasseled purple pillows that sat along the back wall. The whole studio was immaculate: purple carpeting, a state-of-the-art soundboard, beautifully designed wooden soundproofing elements coming out of the ceiling, and my favorite feature, a door that simply had the letter “P” inscribed on its glass. The door led into the live recording room, and as the other people settled into the chairs around the studio Prince disappeared behind the glass. Once everyone took their places he came back and sat in a swivel chair right next to Bobby.\n\nWith his engineer (and Hannah Ford’s husband), Joshua Welton, sitting at the controls, Prince sat back and dictated which songs to play us and for how long. The first song was the opening track of the new 3RDEYEGIRL album, Plectrum Electrum, a punchy, Prince-led track that also appears on Liv Warfield’s new album under the title “The Unexpected.”\n\nHaving heard quite a few songs from Prince’s new 3RDEYEGIRL project in the past, the track wasn’t far from what I was expecting, although the music sounded richer and more complex on those studio speakers than anything I’d ever heard before. The song strutted with a classic Prince funk groove and featured stacks of tightly recorded vocal harmonies. Everyone in the studio was bobbing their heads to the beat.\n\nAfter the song ended he looked around and asked us, “Is that too loud?” and everyone yelled “NO!” “No!” he echoed back, falling into a fit of laughter.\n\nNext up was “Ain’t Turnin’ Round,” a far poppier song that featured drummer Hannah Ford on lead vocals and a ripping guitar solo by Donna Grantis. Then we heard part of “Stop This Train,” a duet between Hannah and Josh that almost had an Owl City vibe. By this point Prince was getting impatient and he started cutting off the songs before they could finish so we could move on to the next one.\n\n“This next one is an instrumental, guitar band jam,” Prince said, and Josh cued up the title track of the new album, “Plectrum Electrum.” It was grimy and swampy and heavy and satisfying, reminiscent of the Led Zeppelin song “The Ocean” in its opening riff and then wandering off into a feedback-laden freakout. When the guitar squalor ended Prince leapt out of his chair and pretended like he was going to storm right out the door. “Donna, you owe us an apology,” he joked, sitting back down. “That was rude,” he added, laughing.\n\nNext he said he was going to play a song that he wrote for Rita Ora, who is “the biggest thing in UK fashion” at the moment, and who he described as “really rough… she’s one of those ruffians. Like they’re just putting some fancy clothes on her, but she’s rough.” The song was easily the freshest and most forward-thinking track he played for us, with a crazy breakneck beat and some quick-paced sing/rapping that reminded me a bit of Lizzo’s work with Lazerbeak and Ryan Olson.\n\n“She’s 22 going on 49,” he cracked. Later, I would ask him if he discovered her on his latest tour to Europe (where he played just last month) and he said that it was the first time he had connected with her, though they had known of her for a while. “Like a lot of artists, she came to a show, paid her respects,” he said.\n\nAnd then we had the chance to sample all of the new song “Gold Standard,” a frenetic, funky, fun single that had a jittery guitar hook reminiscent of “Kiss” and some fast-talking lyrics. (“Did he just sing ‘hashtag put your fun in your bag?’” I scribbled into my notebook. It turns out it was “hashtag put ur phone in ur bag.”) The chorus was “Gold standard, crazy amazing,” once again sung in those trademark tight vocal harmonies stacked up all the way to the ceiling. The song built into an amazing horn-heavy funk breakdown and then ended with some bizarre bubbling noises and Prince speaking slowly and suggestively. When I looked over at him he was almost falling off of his chair laughing. Remember what I said about his sense of humor?\n\nWhen I asked him about the bubbling noises in the song he said, “If I told you, I’d have to…you know,” then added, “Let’s just say we were watching Finding Nemo in the studio.”\n\nThe final song he played was from his protégé, Marissa, who is working with Welton on some new recordings. The beat was AWESOME, a fast-paced, dizzying drum roll, and the vocals were poppy, similar to the work that Hannah Ford has been doing with 3RDEYEGIRL.\n\nAs soon as we started walking out of the studio Prince caught up with me and asked, “Will you pay for that?”\n\n“Maybe,” I said. “What’s the price?”\n\nHe shrugged and smiled. “Get your checkbook.”\n\nOnce we got into the hall I started marveling over all of the awards displayed in little cases along the wall and all the photos that I had been too distracted to take in before. There is a timeline running in chronological order along one wall that has photos of Prince from every stage in his career, and he paused and pointed to a blown up version of a 1985 issue of Rolling Stone. “See that?” he said. “They wanted me to pose for a photo shoot but I was too busy, so they took a screen grab of my video and blew it up for the cover.” He scoffed.\n\nBobby Z pointed out how pixelated it was, and how he had never noticed that before.\n\n“Look at my teeth, see these gaps?” Prince said.\n\n“Did the distortion do that?” Bobby asked.\n\n“No,” Prince said, “but c’mon. They were obviously like, ‘Fine, you don’t want to pose for a photo? Here!’ Brother ain’t got no teeth!”\n\n(I almost lost it here. I couldn’t help but giggle uncontrollably. Did I mention Prince is hilarious?)\n\nWe started walking again. “I wanted to ask you about something, since you say you don’t look back,” I said. “How do you feel about the MNHS photo exhibit, with all the Charles Chamblis photos? They have a very early photo of you on display right now.”\n\n“Oh, that’s ok,” he said. “I don’t mind that. You know, I’d like to see that!”\n\nBy this point we had gotten back into the room with the stage, and Prince lingered near the back of the room to continue our conversation. He was sure to mention Jon Bream’s recent writeup of his visit to Paisley several times, oftentimes quoting what he had written about the new music word for word. He also criticized the way his conversation about radio stations was represented in the piece, scoffing at how simplistically the conversation had been reprinted for the paper.\n\n“What I’m saying is really basic,” he said. “I don’t know how you could misunderstand it. Clear Channel owns all the radio. Someone is making the playlist for all the stations across the country, and it’s all corporately owned. You know iHeartRadio? They don’t sell records… If I’m going to play, I get paid a million dollars. How are they going to make that if they don’t sell any records? That’s why you see the same few artists playing all of their festivals; they own the publishing, they own the songs, they own everything.”\n\n“When I was with Warners, the album I sold that year would make more money than anything else on the label,” he continued. “I was earning all the money for them. That’s why we had to put out a new record every year; to make money for the label.”\n\n“The 1% was making the profits for the other 99%,” Bobby added.\n\n“It was me and Madonna,” Prince said, nodding. “Basically. That’s why I had to get out. I was releasing albums once a year, which felt too slow for me, but too fast for them because they had to figure out how to promote it.”\n\nHe paused, adding, “You get the music you deserve.”\n\nBobby nodded, repeating it. “You get the music you deserve.”\n\nBy this time a band had started up—a young guitarist named Darren Harts, plus three of Prince’s session players, who had formed something of a house band behind him. “He’s from Australia,” Prince said, pointing to Darren. “He doesn’t have any real musicians he can play with back home. Isn’t that weird? So I invited him here.”\n\n“That’s nice of you,” I said.\n\n“He reminds me of how I was at that age,” he said, obviously impressed with Darren’s guitar abilities. “I want him to have the opportunity to play with real musicians.”\n\nAfter a few minutes of listening Prince seemed like he was going to wander away, but he turned back and looked at me again. “Do you want to dance?” he asked me, extending his hand. Before I had time to react, he pulled his arm back and said, “Just kidding!” He walked away again, then turned back and said, “No really, do you want to dance?” and “Just kidding!” again.\n\nNot long after that, Prince disappeared. It must have been roughly 1:30 a.m., and just as producer Joshua Welton started shaking hands with all of us to bid us adieu, I looked up and noticed that Finding Nemo had just finished playing for the second time and the credits had started to roll. It was time to go home."
