The venue is located on Main Street across from the town library. performances will take place at The Gazebo which is set in a natural amphitheater on a downward slope. A recent refurbishing took place during the COVID-19 pandemic as audiences now have a spectacular view of each show they are attending.\n\nIn case you missed out on one of your favorite acts, fear not as our friends at Community Television for Southern Berkshire record the programs and videos are available online by going here. They will also playback these shows on cable TV by tuning in to channel 1301.\n\nHere is the rest of this year's entertainment that is on the docket:\n\nJuly 31: Here she is, The ONE & ONLY Wanda Houston and the HBH Band featuring Charlie Tokarz (jazz, R & B, rock, gospel) Once again, Wanda and company will grace the stage. If you have not seen her perform, you are in for a real treat, guaranteed. WE LOVE WANDA!\n\nAugust 7: The Pug and John Show* featuring acoustic rock classics.\n\nAugust 14: The Matchstick Architects featuring my radio brother Tom Conklin as this trio ROCKS the house!\n\n(Video clip of JoAnne Redding (lead vocals) and Benny Kohn (keyboard) performing at Lilac Park courtesy of www.youtube.com)\n\nAugust 21: Soulâ€™d Out Featuring JoAnne Redding and Ed Moran with classic rock & blues. FYI--I worked with JoAnne in the 90's when we were colleagues at WKZE-AM in Sharon, Connecticut. We specialized in country music with a mix of classics and currents from that genre of music!\n\n(Photo image of South Egremont's BTU's courtesy of https://www.fireflylenox.com/event/the-btus-52/)\n\nAugust 28: The BTU's will end the season on a ROCKIN' note!\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Summer is here, free shows await in \"Lovely Lenox\" so bring your lawn chairs, blankets and enjoy!
