        "text": "At three in the morning, we were heading into the second hour of this beery rap, Stills disposing of his thoughts on Gulag and Russian history, on the history of art and his own recent tries at painting; on how he wanted to find a printer to do a Stephen Stills songbook in the fashion of an old hymn book. The next afternoon–late the next afternoon–getting ready to leave for Denver, Stills tries to keep his eyes open long enough to look into mine, forms a smile, then laughs: “Bob sang all these great new songs and then he turned the guitar over to me and asked me to sing him a new one, and I was so wasted I couldn’t remember the words!” Stills is genuinely amused. “Hey, all that stuff last night. I hope you disregard it.”\n\n“What stuff?” I say.\n\nEven friends dismiss much of what Stills has to say when he’s off the stage. He talks about moving back to California, to the Bay Area, in fact, where the rest of the group now have homes. Michael John Bowen, his manager and friend from high school days in Tampa, Florida, pshaws in his tart, jock-strapped voice: “That’s this week.” Stills had talked about the burden on Solzhenitsyn’s shoulders and I relay what I recall of his thinking to Graham Nash.\n\nNash snaps back: “That’s this book.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nAs he says, Stills doesn’t have to apologize his entire past away; he can, in fact, be forever proud of much of it. Neither do audiences–the minority that have minded when Stills lost either his voice or his head–have to forgive. Still, today he does find it easier to admit or at least rationalize mistakes. “When I did ‘For What It’s Worth’ and did the rant and all that, you point out what an incredible bust it was for me. It was really dumb. But the last generation, that’s what they wanted to hear and, of course, being an entertainer, I was behind it. “And I’ll blow records sometimes,” he says, “’cause I get so far into getting it recorded, and some of the mixes are so difficult, I’ll get too hung up and blow the performance of the gig. But, you know, I’m learning.”\n\n***\n\nIn the studio, Stills used to be the seldom-disputed captain. He clearly and cleanly dominated the first album–producing, mixing, arranging and dubbing in most of the instrumentation (guitars, organ and bass) on the 10 tracks. Stills won’t talk about the stories of battles over Déjà Vu; he thinks ahead to the next CSNY album, to be done in the studios after the tour. “That’s going to be a whole different kind of thing to deal with,” he says. “It’ll be give and take and getting a consortium of opinion. The erroneous assumption is that we are gonna hassle about it and nobody’s into that any more.”\n\nDavid Crosby has also talked about growth, about how “everybody’s willing to give each other more room and respect.” Michael John Bowen breaks into a conversation Stills is having just before the show in Vancouver. “They’re reworking the first set,” his manager tells him. “Graham wants you. They want to put ‘Cut My Hair’ into it.”\n\nStills: “OK, all right. We can do that instead of ‘Black Queen.'”\n\nBowen: “But Graham says ‘Black Queen’ follows ‘Cowgirl’ nicely.”\n\nStills finally excuses himself. The impression is that he’ll go along with whatever anyone wants. “Maturity,” Crosby is saying, “has lessened the pressure between us. I’m knocked out with how good partners we’re being and how hard everyone’s trying.” But doesn’t stepping back and holding tongues approach a kind of dishonesty?\n\nTrending\n\nCrosby says he’s talking musically: “You’ll hear us playing along and we’re playing to a place where we’re storming and somebody, without even looking, will come to a peak”–Crosby, in his hotel room, mimes a lead guitarist creating a storm–”and everybody goes fwhooop! and drops way back, and one guitar will come out speaking right out of it, just clear. Now that’s leaving room for people, and that happens when you’re gettin’ to be a band.”\n\nRelated\n\nWhen I first enter his suite at the St. Paul Hilton, Crosby, dressed down to just shorts, is near to attacking his vanity mirror. He is five months into kung fu–that’s maybe two months past the cut-off point for most faddists–and finds time to work out every day. I tell him how much fun I had the night before and how Stills and Dylan stayed up to at least 5 a.m. “I don’t do that any more,” he says, like a kid who’s had a pleasant bad habit forcibly changed. “It just doesn’t pay off. It’s mostly my throat. If I don’t get enough sleep, I get a cold and blow it, and 18,00:, 40,000; even 60,000 people don’t get a righteous count. It sounds corny but it’s true.” He also wants to trim himself down (he’s now a “bear-shaped” 155 pounds) before it gets too late. But most important: “When you’re physically active, your mind feels better, you think more clearly and you’re less likely to be irritable.”"
