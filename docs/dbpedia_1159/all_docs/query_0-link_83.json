        "text": "I was sitting with Ariel in the storehouse car park, collecting my thoughts before we went to Wetherspoon’s – again, for the cheapest meal in town. We can’t cook so we have to go out but as the storehouse closes at 5 PM it’s a little early and usually, we have been rushing around at high speed in the dying moments. So then we (me at least) hobble to the car and sit there – recovering. We are parked next to some small buildings that are actually three other businesses beyond the corner of the storehouse car park. The first is painted red but it’s peeling as the water has penetrated the ancient paint. One piece of paint about two inches long had somehow disconnected itself from the wood and was hanging from a cobweb and swinging in the wind. It makes you realise the power of water as it slowly seeped and destroyed the paint, rotted the wood and in a matter of time the whole side of the building will crumble and collapse. But it’s not just porous wood that it affects. An ally in rust, it has destroyed the guttering on the corner of the storehouse building, a gaping hole in the metal.\n\nI asked for extra beans at Wetherspoon’s and paid for them. When they arrived I could almost count them so I said to the poor young lad who brought them to our table, “That doesn’t look like extra beans to me”. So he took them back to the kitchen and returned a minute later and said, “This is actually the extra beans”. Haha, the kitchen was refusing me extra, extra beans, I’d already had my quota. The manager walked by as this was all happening and told the lad to go and get me more beans and was aghast at the thought that the kitchen could turn this into an issue. I remembered last week, one of the chefs, a dishcloth of purple hair on the top of his head, outside smoking a cigarette. From where he stood and where we were you could see a beautiful sunset. I mentioned it to him, his response a cynical, “I see it every day, mate”. I guess he sees the beans every day too.\n\nIt’s not so cold tonight and I didn’t forget my coat but I don’t think I quite imagined sitting in a field typing in the middle of the night at any temperature. Three weeks just in the storage along gives you an idea of the size of the job and that was with Fred and Gerri Ann’s help for one of those weeks. Tomorrow we hope to hit the tip. I called them today and asked would there be a problem arriving at a recycling centre (posh name) in a left-hand drive van with foreign reg and dumping a load of stuff (at Frome, pronounced Froom) in the middle of Somerset? He was positive about it all, I told him the circumstances and that we had moved to Portugal and used to live in Croscombe, a village in the area. So we’ll see tomorrow but first, they need to move the big truck (one of six) outside the storehouse door because today we couldn’t get everything out even if we wanted to. I hope we can do this tomorrow and then we’ll be nearly done.\n\nWe are planning to go to Stonehenge on Friday on the way back to London for Friday and Saturday where we will stay with our friend Biggles, partner Colleen will be away on the Isle Of Wight with old friends. I have to take my computer back to Mohamad in Queensway on Saturday to have last week’s replaced battery replaced. Sunday we will be back here again, our last visit to the storehouse to load up Ariel with the things we want to take to Portugal on Tuesday – the rest will come later when I have a schedule, the money and a place to put it all in Porto, working on it.\n\nYou can support THE BIG MOVE here\n\nMusic today Was:\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience – Electric Ladyland (1968)\n\nThe Mars Volta – The Bedlam In Goliath (2008)\n\nMarvin Gaye – What’s Going On? (1971)\n\nThe Motels – Motels (1979)\n\nQueens Of The Stone Age – Songs For The Deaf (2002)\n\nRon Sexsmith – Other Songs (1997)\n\nTraveling Wilburys – Vol. 1 (1988)\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers – Damn The Torpedoes (1979)\n\nThe Chameleons – Script Of The Bridge (1983)\n\nMusic Of The Daze\n\nThe day started with a chill in the air and a mist that swallowed up the hills. Olivia bravely took a shower and I stayed with Ariel and my computer where I confirmed that my new battery didn’t work. 100% plugged in and then almost immediately dead when it’s let out on its own, which means I have to go back into London at the weekend to be pushed, squashed and breathed upon by the swarm. Here in the field in complete contrast to London at night, it’s quiet and empty and there is a brilliant bright sky that’s almost as good as Piccadilly Circus! That’s what people up north used to say when it got busy somewhere, ”it’s like Piccadilly Circus”, probably not having been there but acknowledging that it might be pretty busy all the time down in the smoke. Cold again in the passenger seat typing, but it has been worse – I forgot my big coat which usually protects me so I’m covered in blankets instead, yawning but not quite shivering. I need a heated poncho.\n\nWe made some progress today and although we’re still not done we managed to get into the boxes sent down to me after Aunty Gwen died. She was a major music fan and I inherited all her records. A very mixed middle of the road selection with lots of older singers too like Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. I was surprised then to find a copy of Guns N’ Roses‘ Appetite For Destruction (1987) with the original troublesome cover. I suppose the publicity for that album got into every corner of the world – there must be a picture of a yak somewhere carrying the album on its back. There were some great singles from the sixties that she’d bought brand new and still in their original sleeves – Sandie Shaw’s Girl Don’t Come (1964) for example. It was sad to go through Aunty Gwen’s things now she’s gone but we will be forever grateful for her for making it financially possible to move the archive and studio to Portugal.\n\nWe worked hard today, trying to label everything, naming each box and giving it a number. There are so many small boxes – you can’t fill a big box with 78s, too heavy, too fragile. There’s also a lot of heavy boxes and I’m freaking out about the quotes to come. There’s no point worrying about it, we just have to hope that the Aunty Gwen inheritance and moving to Portugal are compatible and the costs are covered between that and some donations through GoFundMe (we’ve contacted GoFundMe about the issues you’ve been reporting – no answers).\n\nAfter leaving my coat, my bag and my brain cells in the storehouse we went around to Wetherspoons to meet our drummer Ed (Noctorum, Ahad’s record, Space Summit, MOAT). Great to see him, he works close to here, teaching drums and this will probably be the last time we see him before (hopefully) seeing him on a project in Portugal. I always said that you can probably fly to Porto for about the same price as driving to Penzance. We met for food and after yesterday’s expensive Indian meal (£50) we were happy to get back to reality and ate for £11.50.\n\nMusic today was:\n\nEgg – The Civil Surface (1974)\n\nBlack Mountain – Wilderness Heart (2010)\n\nBridget St John – Songs For The Gentle Man (1971)\n\nThe Beatles – Please Please Me (1963)\n\nBudgie – Never Turn Your Back On A Friend (1973)\n\nDef Leppard – Hysteria (1987)\n\nGentle Giant – Free Hand (1975)\n\nThe Groundhogs – Thank Christ For The Bomb (1970)\n\nBlack Sabbath – Vol. 4 (1972)\n\nMusic Of The Daze\n\nAs I sit here cold in the passenger seat, typing away, staring into the darkness, I’m reflecting on how noisy it was out there when we got up this morning. There were crows and all kinds of birds in the hedges (or ‘bush fences’ as Olivia likes to call them), it was a real cacophony of shrieks and whistles, croaks and piercing high notes. To steal Neil Diamond’s words, it was a “Beautiful Noise”. Talking of reflections, my computer is in all the windows so I can’t stare out and imagine the mysteries of the darkness. We slept in a little longer this morning after the drive yesterday but it was a beautiful morning at 9 AM and the sun was warm on the skin. We arrived at the cold storage room and continued with the mega task and although so much has been done it just continues on and on so tonight after we’d packed, sealed, repacked, had thrown old boxes away and seen some progress, we decided that on the closing of the storage house we would do something different.\n\nSo today when the storehouse was closed at 5 PM we drove five miles to Glastonbury. Ed, who plays the drums on released albums, Space Summit, MOAT, Noctorum, lives in Bristol and works close to here some days and we were hoping to catch him, it didn’t happen so we decided to climb up and experience the Glastonbury Tor instead. I’ve done it once 100 years ago but Olivia hasn’t so we parked by the famous Chalice Well and walked up the hill to the back of the Tor where a footpath leads you to the summit. The place is drenched in mythology as this is Avalon, they even say this could be the resting place of the Holy Grail, although nobody has found it yet. Just before we entered the footpath we talked to a girl who lived in a van, she was very nice and there in the field were the dreadlocked alternative culture that lives in this area. We asked her what her van was called, “Crusty,” she said. That should make you laugh if you know the term.\n\nThe climb was quite steep and I was begging my back and my knees to let me do it. We zig-zagged our way to the top, reaching the roofless tower and the 360 degrees view of the surrounding countryside that shows you Wales, Wells and the villages that dot the fields. The beauty of this place is really quite stunning, the green fields of England at their best. You can easily immerse yourself in the beauty of the view, the breeze on your face, the setting sun over the Somerset Levels and the Mendip Hills in the distance. We stayed until the sun set and the cold pressed its boney fingers around the tops of your arms. We left behind revellers, musicians, a man with tap dancing shoes, another with a bodhrán and another with a djembe and a didgeridoo. Apparently last night there were 100 people up there dancing and playing music, it’s a mythical mecca and attracts the searchers, the believers, the alternate lifestylers, and you can see why.\n\nWe went back down the opposite path at the front of the Tor and found Ariel at the bottom of the hill. We decided to go and eat something in Glastonbury and found an Indian restaurant which was way too expensive. Lots of the shops in the high street reflect the mythology of the area. Years ago I saw Daevid Allen’s Gong here and that really was a cosmic experience, as was being up on the Tor today.\n\nMusic today was:\n\n10cc – How Dare You! (1976)\n\nHome – Pause For A Hoarse Horse (1971)\n\nHawkwind – s/t (1970)\n\nDavid Sylvian – Dead Bees On A Cake (1999)\n\nPrincipal Edwards Magic Theatre – The Asmoto Running Band (1971)\n\nHairy Chapter – Can’t Get Through (1971)\n\nMike Oldfield – Man On The Rocks (2014)\n\nGong – Expresso II (1978)\n\nGong – Flying Teapot (1973)\n\nMusic Of The Daze\n\nAh, that lovely warm bed at Trev and Trish’s house is vivid in my memory as I sit in the van in a field wearing a T-shirt, shirt, hoodie, big coat, scarf and two blankets – and I’m cold. I also have a cough. It’s midnight and I just finished a sesh with Jed working on the songs for the second Space Summit album. The wind is howling, driving through the hills and keeping all creatures great and small embedded in their dens. (Olivia is napping in the back.) The day started in the Buzzard, with a sesh with Arktik Lake Tony, me half an hour late because the clocks have changed in Australia and I confused the sesh time. The sun was shining, goodbye to Trev and Trish and their house before they move as we drive down through the country lanes to Biggles and Colleen’s house to pick up Ariel’s spare key which we forgot when we visited them last. It was just a drop in for a cup of tea, pick up the keys and get going as the drive to Somerset was going to take a while. We managed to leave while it was light but the sun, a burning miracle in the sky, was setting fast and twilight quickly turned to darkness.\n\nWe stopped to fill up the tank, £53, I’m sure it was cheaper than that before the self-imposed fuel crisis. It reminded me of the beginning of the pandemic when some shops were selling hand sanitiser for ten times the price, how could you do that? People were losing their jobs and had less money so how could you ask for more? I love that story about Tom Petty, when his record label MCA wanted to put the price of his album up to $7.98 and he said if they did that he’d call the album $6.98. I live in a world of making records that overall people don’t buy because of streaming. There are manufacturing costs and one of the killers is postage and then duty. I’m more or less giving my music away with streaming whilst hoping to pay for costs to make the records with physical sales and when I say make, I don’t just mean manufacture, I mean record with lots of great musicians and an engineer/producer in a proper studio. I know, I know, I’m one of the lucky ones, I don’t have to go through anything like what people have to endure but I just wish we would try and help each other out and that means business too, make a profit by helping people with your products, not by skinning them alive.\n\nI had some indigestion th’ other day and I bought a bottle of Gaviscon, it cost £10.99. A box of Kellogg’s bran flakes is £3.50. Can you imagine what the markup is on these products? Especially when the generic brands are less than half the price. Surely they should charge costs plus a decent profit instead of costs plus a profit that is outrageous.\n\nThe balance of money between men and women, car park attendants and footballers, people in the developing world, and Europeans is hard to reconcile. In England, a qualified nurse starts on £25,000 a year, de Gea, Man United’s goalkeeper, is on £20,000,000 a year, I guess you get what you can and even a nurse’s pay is a dream if you are fleeing from war in your country with your family and two bags.\n\nOn the way to the campsite (Woodlands), we drove past Stonehenge in the dark. You could just make it out and as we are in a left-hand drive car I could see it from the right-hand side, Olivia couldn’t see it at all. But we plan to go there on Thursday if we get the packing done in time – apparently, the scaffolding has gone. We wanted to go up north and do lots more sightseeing but it’s too busy and Wookey Hole and Tintern Abbey will have to wait. Off to freeze to death.\n\nMusic today has been c/o Trevor’s world with the second and self-titled Free album (1969), Robin Williamson’s Journey’s Edge (1977), Espers‘ The Weed Tree (2005) and Mark Fry‘s Dreaming With Alice (1972).\n\nMusic Of The Daze\n\nQuestion: How do you get into London with a diesel car from 1993? Answer: With great difficulty. We left Wing and headed for Brent Cross shopping centre, free parking and at the end of the M1 with an underground station nearby. It didn’t take us long to realise the plan wasn’t going to work. Traffic everywhere as usual on the M1, both directions, an overwhelming presence of humans, they’re everywhere careering down the M1 one after another in these little tin bubbles, pressing engagements that can’t wait. Or? They’re leaving, heading north to see the family or to get married or escaping the hoards in the south. For us the problems began when a big sign appeared on the side of the road saying that we were entering a low emissions zone, I’m pretty sure we qualify for not being allowed in, but it was only a couple of miles from where we thought we could park. We carried on, got to the shopping centre, the car park was slammed, cars everywhere, on the roundabouts, turning left and right, speeding off in all directions. As soon as we parked it felt like a bad idea, go in for a coffee, get a receipt, put it in the window and sneak off to London via Tube. An unfriendly looking parking agent walked by Ariel, Ariel withdrew. We looked at the rules and breaking them was a £100 fine. We got our coffee and decided to leave and find another way.\n\nA lady from Galicia walked by with her daughter and noticed the Portugal reg. I chatted with her and her daughter. She was very happy to see a car from close to where she was from, her husband was from Bolivia and I talked to her daughter about going to La Paz, where she’d never been as well as Cuzco in Peru and seeing Machu Picchu. I told her my story of sleeping on the third floor of the hotel, no lift and having to rest after two flights of stairs because of the high altitude. So we left where we were and decided to head for Watford, park up north somewhere and take an overground train into London. As we drove towards the M1 we passed the entrance to the Brent Cross underground and there at the bottom of a residential street was an empty parking space, no threat, perfect – now we have to hope we don’t get fined for entering the low emission zone.\n\nI was taking my old computer and my really old computer in to have new batteries fitted so I spent most of the afternoon sitting in a computer store with Mohamad the fixer. Olivia went off across Kensington Gardens to Gloucester Road to find an open post office. When she came back she went down to CEX, an electronic secondhand store and managed to find me a secondhand 160GB iPod. Time was passing and we needed one more trip to Soho for me to exchange a record and for Olivia to buy taiyaki in China Town. It was INSANE down there! There were people queueing up for clothes shops, pubs and restaurants. There were so many people that at times you were standing still waiting for the bottleneck ahead to clear – swarming throngs! Soon enough we were back on the Tube to Brent Cross and back to The Boydies for dinner and talking.\n\nNow, after all of the hoo-hah of getting to London, parking near London and dealing with London, I’m absolutely exhausted. Back to the campsite in Somerset tomorrow so I really should go and take advantage of the welcoming double bed – back to basics tomorrow.\n\nMusic today has been just one album, the inimitable John Martyn and Bless The Weather, his fifth album, released in 1971. I have to stop now, I can’t keep my eyes open.\n\nMusic Of The Daze"
