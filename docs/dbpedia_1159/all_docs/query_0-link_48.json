        "text": "Another year has passed and again we’ve had to deal with planning and attending events around the never-ending coronavirus pandemic. Although we joyously headed back out to concerts, movies, and sporting events this spring and summer, we operated with limited hours until June and there wasn’t a Record Store Day in April. Thank goodness we had many notable new releases to get us through it all! Here’s how the year played out:\n\nAs part of Delco Arts’ Spring Fling in May, we hosted an event with author and painter, George H. Rothacker. Paintings and prints of his Rock Legends were available for sale and we presented a slide show of the paintings on the big screen throughout the day. George was on-site to sign his memoir, “The Diverse Artistic Universe of George H. Rothacker: A Memoir with Pictures,” too.\n\nWe went back to regular hours in June, started staying open late once a month for evening shopping, and we resumed our Band Fan Nights with music and videos by Santana and Jimi Hendrix. We held the first of two RSD Drops but without live music, food, or drinks.\n\nJuly featured the second RSD Drops event and a Band Fan Night featuring The Doors in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jim Morrison’s passing.\n\nWe celebrated the Stones at our August Band Fan Night and sadly lost Charlie about a week later.\n\nOur September Band Fan Night featured The Faces, Humble Pie, Robin Trower, and Ten Years After and we hosted a FirstGlance Film Festival Preview Party and ticket giveaway.\n\nFor Delco Arts Week in October, we hosted a special a screening of Shawn Swords’ documentary, “Charlie Gracie Fabulous.” Charlie joined us for the event so we surprised him with an award for his contributions to the arts and music in Delaware County. We also participated in Kids Music Day, hosting a music-themed craft for kids.\n\nRecord Store Day Black Friday took place in November without a hitch and we held Pop-Up Shops for Finding Shelter and Animal Friends of Lansdowne, fundraisers for the two animal rescues on Small Business Saturday.\n\nAs 2021 comes to a close, we’re thankful that we were able to stay open and present at least a reduced number of special events under the circumstances. We’re hanging in there with the help of great music and hope you are too! Thanks for shopping with us!"
