        "text": "U.S. vocal and instrumental group. Beginning in the late 1960s, singer-songwriter-guitarists David Crosby, Stephen Stills, and Graham Nash parlayed their high harmonies and soft-rock songs into multi-platinum hits to become (with the later addition of Neil Young, born on November 12, 1945, in Toronto, Ontario) one of the supergroups of the 1970s. Their distinctive sound, widely imitated by other soft rock groups, brought them critical and commercial success that continued despite upheavals within the group.\n\nDavid Crosby (born David Van Cortland on August 14, 1941, in Los Angeles, California—died on January 18, 2023), Stephen Stills (born on January 3, 1945, in Dallas, Texas) and Graham Nash (born on February 2, 1942, in Blackpool, England), had performed and recorded as solo artists as well as in other bands before they formed Crosby, Stills & Nash. Crosby had left the Byrds in 1967, in part because of the group’s refusal to record his songs. Meanwhile, he produced singer Joni Mitchell’s debut album. (Later, Mitchell’s song “Woodstock” became a huge hit for Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.) Stills had been with Buffalo Springfield, a popular but short-lived rock group of the late 1960s, in which he had performed with singer-guitarist Neil Young until just before the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. Nash had played with the Hollies, a band he formed in Great Britain in the early 1960s. He quit in 1968 when his partners refused to record several of his own songs, including “Marrakesh Express,” which subsequently became a hit for Crosby, Stills & Nash.\n\nCrosby, Stills, & Nash formed their new group in 1968 in Los Angeles. Their debut album, Crosby, Stills & Nash (1969), which included “Marrakesh Express” and “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” (written about singer Judy Collins), was an immediate hit. They began touring after the album was released, playing their second live concert in front of half a million people at the Woodstock festival in 1969.\n\nWith the addition of Neil Young, who had joined the band prior to Woodstock, they released Déjà Vu (1970) which contained the hit singles “Woodstock,” “Teach Your Children,” and “Our House.” Although their voices sang in harmony, their individual egos were decidedly at odds. By the time the quartet released their next live album, Four Way Street (1971), Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young had disbanded.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Crosby and Nash released successful solo and duo albums and occasionally toured together while Stills and Young pursued solo careers, also with considerable success. Stills had a big hit with “Love the One You’re With” (1971), recorded with guest artists Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nAfter a long hiatus, Crosby, Stills & Nash reunited for CSN (1977), their second album as a trio. The album went multi-platinum and generated a tour the following year. In late 1979, Crosby, Stills & Nash performed at the Musicians United for Safe Energy (MUSE) benefit. Over the next few years they would release several more albums as a trio, including Replay (1980); Daylight Again (1982), which featured the hit singles “Wasted on the Way” and “Southern Cross,” and Allies (1983).\n\nCrosby, who had well-known substance abuse problems and had several run-ins with the law, spent time in a drug rehabilitation program. Except for a few appearances, such as the 1985 Live Aid concert, the trio did not record together again until their Live It Up (1990) album. The second album that they released under the title CSN (1991) followed, with mediocre sales. Next came After the Storm (1994). In spite of low record sales, the band’s loyal fans continued to attend their live concerts.\n\nThe induction of Crosby, Stills & Nash into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 made Stephen Stills the only artist to be inducted twice in the same year (he was also inducted as a member of Buffalo Springfield), and it marked David Crosby’s second induction, his first having been as a member of the Byrds in 1991."
