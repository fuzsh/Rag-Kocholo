        "text": "What Are Their Names\n\nDavid Crosby\n\nWhat Are Their Names comes from David Crosby’s 1971 solo album If I Could Only Remember My Name.\n\nCrosby had written (or co-written) some songs that were often on my turntable. Long Time Gone, Wooden Ships, Deja Vu, Almost Cut My Hair – from the albums Crosby, Stills & Nash & Deja Vu. Triad, from Jefferson Airplane’s Crown Of Creation was another favourite written by Crosby. And also the haunting Everybody’s Been Burned from The Byrds‘ 1967 album Younger Than Yesterday.\n\nI really like his songs.\n\nHe’d lined up a veritable who’s who of West Coast psychedelia to play on the album. Most of The Grateful Dead, Grace Slick & Paul Kantner from Jefferson Airplane, his colleagues from CSNY, Joni Mitchell, Greg Rolie & Michael Shrieve from Santana, & David Frieberg from Quicksilver Messenger Service.\n\nMy school lunch money would be much better saved and spent on this album … than on a couple of pies from the canteen.\n\nI wasn’t disappointed.\n\nUnfortunately, my vinyl copy was lost sometime in the late 70’s or early 80’s. A time when I was lost and my collection was decimated through various household moves, break-ups, break-ins, and desperation sales.\n\nCrosby himself, was lost for an extended period around the same time and a bit later … ending up with a list of convictions and eventually spending some time in prison in Texas. He was in a dark place. By the mid-90’s he needed a liver transplant – primarily due to his immoderate approach to drug and alcohol consumption. He survived and will turn 72 in August this year.\n\nHow do What Are Their Names & Ohio relate to each other?\n\nA song from Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young makes for an easy link to songs from any of the individual members of CSNY.\n\nThe 3 songs coming out of the Ohio crossroad were each selected because they have a political edge. What Are Their Names has continued political relevance today, being used as an unofficial anthem in the Occupy Wall Street leaderless resistance movement in late 2011.\n\nThe song’s progression seems to match that of the Occupy movement – a soft, leaderless and loose movement of sound, connecting & threading its way to finally aggregate into a moving, powerful song that is all too brief … then petering out and fading away.\n\n.\n\nOther Stuff You Might Enjoy.\n\n* Personal Notes (about the album tracks) from Stephen Barncard, producer of If I Could Only Remember My Name.\n\n* During December 1970, around the time of recording If I Could Only Remember My Name, David Crosby, Jerry Garcia, Phil Lesh & Mickey Hart, played a few nights at The Matrix in San Francisco. It seems they were billed as Jerry Garcia & Friends but also called themselves David & The Dorks; Jerry & The Jets; or David & The Ding-A-Lings.\n\nThis link takes you to 6 recordings from those sessions: David & The Dorks. And this one to a little information: Willard’s Wormholes.\n\n* What Are Their Names is the subject of a post in a great blog called Political Tunes – The Politics In Popular Songs.\n\nAnd the next road takes us to?\n\nNorth: Chestnut Mare by The Byrds\n\nEast: Greasy Heart by Jefferson Airplane\n\nSouth: New Speedway Boogie by The Grateful Dead\n\nWest: We just visited Ohio\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOhio\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nSo much has been written about this song, Ohio, and the event that inspired Neil Young to write it. The event was, of course, the killing of 4 students, on 4th May 1970, during a peace demonstration at the Kent State University. If you want more detail on this there are links below, under the heading “Other Stuff You Might Enjoy”.\n\nAmerica was at its own crossroad.\n\nOhio was recorded just 17 days after the killings and released as a single in June 1970, the “B-side” was Stephen Stills’ Find The Cost Of Freedom. It first appeared on an album in 1971 when Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young released their live double album – 4 Way Street.\n\nMy first recollection of hearing Ohio was when listening to 4 Way Street – over a year after the Kent State U events, it still poignantly conveyed the sense of disbelief and shock. I guess that is understandable as 4 Way Street was recorded around the time Ohio was released.\n\nAlthough I never owned this album, it regularly traveled through our networked community vinyl collection – it was under my arm a few times as I walked home from visiting it’s “home” collection at Glen Davidson’s place.\n\nThe studio version of Ohio finally appeared on the 1974 CSNY compilation So Far and then on Neil Young’s 1977 compilation Decade. Neil Young wrote the following in the sleeve notes for Decade:\n\nIf this is illegible to you, it says:\n\nOHIO. It’s still hard to believe I had to write this song. It’s ironic that I capitalized on the death of these American students. Probably the biggest lesson ever learned at an American place of learning. My best CSNY cut. Recorded totally live in Los Angeles. David Crosby cried after this take.\n\nHow are Ohio and Oh Susannah connected?\n\nBy the “Oh”? No! Well, yes they do both start with “Oh”.\n\nBut, just as obvious … the connection is Neil Young who performs Oh Susannah, and writes Ohio.\n\n.\n\nOther Stuff You Might Enjoy.\n\n* “Four Dead in O-hi-o”. An excellent, if long, article on the Kent State University killings written by Jack Doyle for the website Pop History Dig.\n\n* Neil Young’s Ohio – The Greatest Protest Record a very interesting article published in The Guardian in 2010. Written by Dorian Lynskey.\n\n* The Official Neil Young YouTube Channel\n\n* Neil Young Documentary: Part 1 (14m 51s); Part 2 (13m 57s); Part 3 (14m 21s); Part 4 (7m 49s).\n\n* Cover of Ohio by DEVO. Jerry Casale, a founding member of Devo, was at Kent State and witness the shootings that killed two of his friends. Casale, at the time saw the Young song as a means for “rich hippies” to make money out of a horrible event. Many years later Devo would play with Young and they suggested the title Rust Never Sleeps for a later project of Young’s. Unfortunately this video has been deleted from You Tube due to copyright claims.\n\nAnd the next road takes us to?\n\nNorth: Chicago by Graham Nash\n\nEast: What Are Their Names by David Crosby\n\nSouth: Oh Susannah.\n\nWest: For What It’s Worth by Buffalo Springfield\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
