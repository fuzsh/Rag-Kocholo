        "text": "Beach Boys co-founder Al Jardine is back on the road with Brian Wilson's daughters -- two-thirds of Wilson Phillips -- Carnie and Wendy Wilson. The shows, billed as Al Jardine Family & Friends, also feature his son Matt Jardine, Carnie's husband and Brian Wilson band guitarist Rob Bonfiglio, and legendary Beach Boys sidemen Bobby Figueroa on drums and Ed Carter on bass.\n\nIn addition to a spate of Beach Boys classics, the group will be performing a mini-set of Wilson Phillips favorites.\n\nIn the late-1990's Jardine, the Wilson sisters, along with son Matt and his brother Adam, toured as Al Jardine's Beach Boys Family & Friends.\n\nAl Jardine told us that ultimately, both then and now, the Beach Boys' biggest hits serve a bigger purpose than just entertaining fans: \"Each song, or each track selection is a special little messenger. And they convey a certain optimism, I think. And collectively, they're extremely powerful and it reminds of a better time -- a more positive time of growing up and experiencing things as a culture.\"\n\nMatt Jardine -- who's revered as having one of the greatest sets of pipes in the business -- has been providing falsettos vocals and harmonies to the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson touring band's for a combined 30 years now. He recalled to us when he finally got the nod to move up from being a P.A. into a performer with the Beach Boys: \"I was basically a gopher out there, just corralling drivers and making sure bags didn't get left behind backstage and all the loose ends that could turn into major (laughs) disasters if they're not taken care of -- that's the stuff I was doin' and I got a call sayin,' 'They need you onstage.' That's how it started. It was a trip.\"\n\nDave Grohl revealed that none of the Foo Fighters expected their new movie Studio 666 to come out as professionally as it did. Grohl spoke to Rock Cellar and admitted, \"Originally, none of us imagined we were going to make a full-length feature film. We thought, in true Foo Fighters fashion, it would just be some low-budget run-and-gun thing, maybe a longform video that would make people laugh, y'know? But we made the mistake of hiring the most talented people in town to make the film. (Director) BJ (McDonnell) is a legitimate badass, he's worked on some really, really amazing films. And Tony Gardner did the special effects. I mean, that guy, he's full f***ing Hollywood legend. And then the entire crew. . . I think we were surrounded by a like-minded group of people that were there just to f***ing have a good time.\"\n\nAfter acting in his videos and directing his various documentary projects, Dave Grohl was asked how it felt to be directed as an actor in a major motion picture: \"It's very, very different. And different process, too, I mean, like, if we're doing a documentary, when I sit down to interview someone, they say 'action,' and I just have a conversation, I very rarely hold questions. And I'm learning as much as the viewer as I'm doing this. With the film, oh my god, there's so much, like, hurry up and wait, and the prosthetics and makeup and the scripts, and the take after take. A very, very different process, but both really fun.\"\n\nHe went on to explain, \"These are things that. . . we wouldn't do these things if they weren't enjoyable to the band. We don't do anything unless it's enjoyable for the band.\"\n\nFoo Fighters perform on Friday (March 4th) in Geelong, Australia at GMHBA Stadium.\n\nMarilyn Manson has sued ex-fiancee Evan Rachel Wood over her abuse allegations. According to Deadline, the suit claims that Wood's rape and abuse allegations are a \"malicious falsehood\" that has derailed Manson's music, TV and film career. He also accused Wood of defamation and impersonation of an FBI agen.\n\nThe complaint -- which was filed Wednesday morning (March 2nd) in Los Angeles Superior Court, read, \"This action arises from the wrongful and illegal acts done in furtherance of a conspiracy by Defendant Evan Rachel Wood and her on-again, off-again romantic partner, Defendant Ashley Gore, a/k/a Illma Gore, to publicly cast Plaintiff Brian Warner, p/k/a Marilyn Manson, as a rapist and abuser—a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner's successful music, TV, and film career.\"\n\nThe suit -- which is seeking a jury trial, goes on to make some accusations against Wood and Gore, alleging that the duo hacked into the singer's computers and social media, as well as \"created a fictitious email account to manufacture purported evidence that Warner was emailing illicit pornography.\"\n\nThe suit continued, \"It's incredibly important to differentiate between the character of ‘Marilyn Manson' and the man Brian Warner. Wood's claims may resonate because of the intentionally ‘shocking' character of ‘Marilyn Manson' but they simply do not reflect the truth. The manufactured facts these conspirators scripted a decade after the event never happened.\"\n\nManson later posted a message on Instagram, saying, \"There will come a time when I can share more about the events of the past year. Until then, I'm going to let the facts speak for themselves.\" He advised viewers to click the link in his Instagram bio which directs them to a PDF of the lawsuit.\n\nManson is asking for unspecified damages.\n\nWhile publicizing the Foo Fighters' new horror spoof Studio 666, Dave Grohl revealed he actually partied at the site of the infamous Manson murders. Grohl recalled hanging out at 10050 Cielo Drive where pregnant actress Sharon Tate and three of her house guests were mercilessly slain by followers of Charles Manson on August 8th, 1969.\n\nGrohl recalled to Britain's The Independent, \"When I was young, I was kind of obsessed with the macabre and knew everything about the Manson Family and those killings. Then, in the summer of '92, I was staying in California with a friend in this tiny house with no air conditioning.\" Grohl went on to say that every day the pair would search out a new swimming pool to cool off in.\n\nHe remembered, \"My friend called me and said, 'Guess where we're swimming today? The house where Sharon Tate was killed by the Manson Family.' It was f***ing dark because it became real, everything I knew about it: walking into that house, it was real. And that house had not changed; the front door, the living room. It was f***ed up. It was legitimately f***ed up. It was not cool at all.\"\n\nGraham Nash is finally back on the road after delaying his solo tour several times due to Covid. The twice-inducted Rock Hall veteran kicks the run off tonight (March 2nd) in Collingswood, New Jersey at the Scottish Rite Auditorium and winds down the current dates over two nights -- April 2nd and 3rd -- at Kent, Ohio's Kent Stage.\n\nNash's shows feature just him, Shane Fontayne -- Crosby, Stills, & Nash's longtime road guitarist, and keyboardist Todd Caldwell. The setlist features a cross-section of Nash's career -- tackling hits by the Hollies, along with new solo work, and classics by Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young.\n\nGraham Nash told us that not worrying about his partners' material on a nightly basis has proven to be a liberating thing for him: \"It's really interesting having to deal with my music, not having to wonder whether (David) Crosby has equal songs, or Stephen (Stills) has equal songs, or Neil (Young) has equal songs. You know me; I've always been the democratic one in the band. But having to deal with just my music is kind of refreshing. It's very satisfying, actually.\"\n\nNash admitted that his acoustic shows have brought him closer to his audience than ever before: \"They more and more seem to think I'm one of them, and I like that a lot. ‘Cause I don't want it to be, y'know, a bunch of people looking at some guy onstage as a star, y'know? Whatever we have done in our lives, every single decision we have ever made, up to this point will bring us to the show. So, why not have the best time? Why not have me do my job, which is as a musician, I go there, I sing songs, I hope to touch their hearts, I hope to touch their minds, I get paid money, and they leave smiling. What's wrong with this picture?\"\n\nGraham Nash tour dates (subject to change):\n\nMarch 2 - Collingswood, NJ - Scottish Rite Auditorium\n\nMarch 4 - Glenside, PA - Keswick Theatre\n\nMarch 5 - Rocky Mount, VA - Harvester Performance Center\n\nMarch 6 - Atlanta, GA - Variety Playhouse\n\nMarch 8 - Charleston, SC - Charleston Music Hall\n\nMarch 9 - Ponte Vedra Beach, FL - Ponte Vedra Concert Hall\n\nMarch 11 - Clearwater, FL - Capitol Theatre Clearwater\n\nMarch 12 - Coral Springs, FL - Coral Springs Center\n\nMarch 13 - Ponte Vedra Beach, FL - Ponte Vedra Concert Hall\n\nMarch 15 - Durham, NC - Carolina Theatre - Fletcher Hall\n\nMarch 16 - Asheville, NC - Diana Wortham Theatre - NC\n\nMarch 19 - Huntsville, AL - Mars Music Hall at Von Braun Center\n\nMarch 22 - Cincinnati, OH - Memorial Hall\n\nMarch 23 - St. Louis, MO - The Pageant\n\nMarch 25 - Evanston, IL - Evanston SPACE\n\nMarch 27 - Nashville, IN - Brown County Music Center\n\nMarch 29 - Iowa City, IA - The Englert Theatre\n\nApril 1 - Ann Arbor, MI - The Ark\n\nApril 2, 3 - Kent, OH - The Kent Stage\n\nOctober 12 - Santa Cruz, CA - Rio Theatre\n\nLindsey Buckingham has just added 10 new cities to his April U.S. swing prior to his 10-country European jaunt. The ousted-Fleetwood Mac leader has tagged on April stops in San Francisco, Napa, Monterey, and Santa Barbara, California; Stateline, Nevada; Denver, Colorado; Skokie, Illinois; Charlottesville and Tysons, Virginia; and Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nWhen we last caught up with him, Lindsey Buckingham told us his band is slowly finding out how the new material fits into his live setlists: \"As always, I'm trying to sort of push forward the presentation of the guitar and voice pieces, so we're opening the show with just me coming out and doing, like five songs by myself. So, I don't know, I think it's really a smart show, everyone's real excited about how the new stuff's been working live. And it's kinda been in a vacuum (laughs), so we're excited to get it in front of some audiences finally.\"\n\nUPDATED: Lindsey Buckingham tour dates (subject to change):\n\nApril 5 - San Francisco, CA - Palace Of Fine Arts Theatre\n\nApril 12 - Napa, CA - Uptown Theatre Napa\n\nApril 13 - Monterey, CA - Golden State Theatre\n\nApril 15 - Santa Barbara, CA - Lobero Theatre\n\nApril 16 - Stateline, NV - Harrah's Lake Tahoe\n\nApril 19 - Denver, CO - Paramount Theatre\n\nApril 21 - Skokie, IL - North Shore Center For The Performing Arts\n\nApril 22 - Kent, OH - Kent Stage\n\nApril 24 - Ithaca, NY - State Theatre Of Ithaca\n\nApril 25 - Glenside, PA - Keswick Theatre\n\nApril 27 - Charlottesville, VA - The Paramount Theater\n\nApril 28 - Tysons, VA - Capitol 1 Hall\n\nApril 29 - Memphis, TN - Beale Street Music Festival 2022\n\nApril 30 - Louisville, KY - The Kentucky Center For Performing Arts\n\nMay 17 - Dublin, Ireland - The Helix\n\nMay 19 - Glasgow, Scotland - SEC Armadillo\n\nMay 21 - Liverpool - Philharmonic Hall\n\nMay 22 - London, England - The Palladium\n\nMay 24 - Ghent, Belgium - Capitole\n\nMay 25 - Paris, France - La Cigale\n\nMay 26 - Utrecht, Netherlands - TivoliVredenburg Grote Zaal\n\nMay 28 - Berlin, Germany - Theater am Potsdamer Platz\n\nMay 30 - Stockholm, Sweden - Cirkus\n\nMay 31 - Oslo, Norway - Folketeateret\n\nJune 2 - Copenhagen, Denmark - Heartland Festival 2022 at Egeskov Castle\n\nBlondie has just rolled out a 10-date summer tour with legendary punk rockers, the Damned. As it stands now, the bands will kick things off on August 12th at Mashantucket, Connecticut's Grand Theater and wrap things up on August 27th in Chicago at the Chicago Theatre.\n\nDebbie Harry says that with radio playing so hard to specific and narrow demographics, the Internet provides a wider range of musical choices for perspective fans that radio ever did: \"Y'know, my audience is, y'know, the spectrum of ages. It's not just one little demographic, it's a lot of different demographics and I think people now, because of the Internet, they really get to choose. They're not really being force-fed. They can really select, they can shop, they can listen, they can. . . y'know, it's a much more open field.\"\n\nUPDATED: Blondie North American tour dates (subject to change):\n\nApril 14 - Huntington, NY - The Paramount\n\nMay 14, 15 - Pasadena, CA - Cruel World Festival 2022\n\nMay 17 - San Francisco, CA - The Masonic\n\nMay 18 - San Diego, CA - Humphreys\n\nMay 21 - Guadalajara, Mexico - Corona Capital Guadalajara\n\nAugust 12 - Mashantucket, CT - Grand Theater (with The Damned)\n\nAugust 14 - Boston, MA - Rockland Trust Bank Pavilion (with The Damned)\n\nAugust 17, 18 - New York, NY - The Rooftop at Pier 17 (with The Damned)\n\nAugust 20 - Bensalem, PA - Xcite Center at Parx Casino (with The Damned)\n\nAugust 21 - Washington, DC - The Anthem (with The Damned)\n\nAugust 23 - Cincinnati, OH - The Andrew J Bradley Music Center (with The Damned)\n\nAugust 24 - Nashville, TN - Grand Ole Opry House (with The Damned)\n\nAugust 26 - Detroit, MI - Fox Theatre (with The Damned)\n\nAugust 27 - Chicago, IL - Chicago Theatre (with The Damned)\n\nIt was 53 years ago today (March 2nd, 1969) that John Lennon and Yoko Ono made their first live public concert performance. Although the couple had first played together the previous December for the Rolling Stones' Rock And Roll Circus TV special, Lennon's appearance at Ono's concert at Cambridge University's Lady Mitchell Hall marked the first time the couple performed to the open public.\n\nLennon and Ono, along with saxophonist John Tchicai and percussionist John Stevens, performed the cacophonous experimental piece \"Cambridge 1969,\" which featured a bearded, denim-clad Lennon creating a wall of feedback guitar under Ono's avant-garde singing. The song was eventually released later that year, and made up the entire second side of the couple's second album, Unfinished Music No. 2: Life With The Lions.\n\nYoko Ono told us that she has mixed emotions about her and Lennon's performance that day: \"It was an iconic moment, because when I did that in Cambridge with John, I was, like, thinking, 'This is it!' I really sent a message to the world, saying 'This is the thing!' But then, when that was on lacquer, people attacked it so much. And John was the only one who was in love with it. John would say -- in the car when we were going somewhere, cross country or something -- he would say, \"Okay, let's play 'Cambridge 1969' I said, 'Please don't do that John (laughs),' because by then it was attacked so much that I was like, 'Ugh, I don't want to hear it.'\"\n\nYoko Ono believes -- both then and now -- trying to pin down what John Lennon meant to the world is impossible: \"John was an artist and musician -- and a poet, as well. And also, he was a songwriter, singer, rocker. So, he was a very complex character.\"\n\nA remixed and revamped version of Lennon and Ono's \"Cambridge 1969\" was featured on Ono's album, titled Yes, I'm A Witch. The critically acclaimed set features modern rockers the Flaming Lips' updated take on the track, which is re-titled \"Cambridge 1969/2007.\"\n\nIt was 55 years ago today (March 2nd, 1967) that the Supremes recorded their hits \"The Happening\" and \"Reflections.\" \"The Happening\" was the theme song to the 1967 movie of the same name, which starred Anthony Quinn, George Maharis from TV's Route 66, and Faye Dunaway. The song was the final Number One by the original lineup of the Supremes, and also featured one of co-founder Florence Ballard's last performances with the group. The song hit Number One on May 13th, 1967, topping the charts for just one week.\n\n\"The Happening\" was the tenth and final Number One song written for the group by Motown staff writers Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland -- who in this instance were joined by The Happening's musical director Frank De Vol, best known for composing the theme song for the TV shows My Three Sons and The Brady Bunch.\n\nAlthough Ballard sings on both tracks, she left the group after the release of \"The Happening.\" She was replaced by Cindy Birdsong, and Motown head Berry Gordy Jr. renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes.\n\n\"Reflections,\" which was released later that summer, was actually the bigger hit, despite the fact that it never got higher than Number Two. The song was a change of pace for the group and featured a more modern sound, which strayed from the orchestral rhythm tracks of their previous singles.\n\nIn the '80s the song went on to be featured as the theme to ABC's Vietnam drama China Beach, and served as the opening number for Diana Ross' ill-fated Supremes reunion tour in 2000 with two latter day, non-original Supremes.\n\nNot long before her death on February 8th, 2021 at the age of 76, Mary Wilson talked bout how important the legendary songwriting team of Holland-Dozier-Holland -- who wrote most of the Supremes biggest hits, including, \"Baby Love,\" \"Come See About Me,\" \"You Can't Hurry Love,\" and \"I Hear A Symphony\" -- was for the group: \"These three guys have actually made my life. I mean, it's been over 40 years and I've got to say, before I met them, before Diana met them, before Florence met them, we were called 'the no-hit Supremes.' These guys are artisans, because they have created a musical mass of music that has not been passed by anyone. I mean, their catalog is just tremendous.\"\n\nSongwriter/producer Lamont Dozier recalled how he and the Holland brothers worked while at Motown: \"There was a time clock. Nine o'clock in the morning we punched a clock and at six we punched out. During that day we would have lunch. It was like school, in a sense. We had an in-house band, so if we came up with anything we would either cut the song that day or the track. And after on, we would dub it in, say, a couple of days later, after we had finished the lyric. But that was, y'know, the general work schedule that we had.\"\n\nBrian Holland recalled that once their songs clicked with the Supremes, it was onward and upward for the Motown team: \"When we first started getting hit records on them, we were writing songs, and we were asking, 'Well, who can sing this?' But once we locked in and it was a hit, then we knew where you were. Because, before you've gotten a hit record you really haven't established (an) identity, so to speak. Once you get those hit records, a hit record, or whatever -- depending on how big it is -- you really kind of establish a direction at least for a while.\"\n\nPaul McCartney has added a second Fenway Park show to his upcoming tour itinerary. The pre-sale for the new show, set for June 8th, goes on sale today -- Monday, February 28th -- for American Express Card Members at 12 noon local time. General on-sale begins Friday, March 4th at 10 a.m. local time.\n\nAs it stands now, \"Macca's\" 14-date 2022 \"Got Back\" tour will kick off on April 28th at Spokane, Washington's Spokane Arena and wrap on June 16th at East Rutherford, New Jersey's Met Life Stadium -- just two days before the former-Beatle's 80th birthday, which falls on June 18th.\n\nBrian Ray, McCartney's touring guitarist for the past two decades, told us he's still amazed by his boss' onstage stamina: [\"We get a break, and he doesn't. He stands up there in front of the crowd for another, I don't know, 20 minutes more than we do, doing his solo bit in the middle. We get a break, and I am flattened by the end of the night!\"] SOUNDCUE (:12 OC: . . . of the night)\n\nAlthough once on the road his set lists don't vary much from night-to-night, Paul McCartney explained that at the start of each tour he likes to throw a few unproven rarities in to shake up the mix: [\"I just like doing it, and whenever I go out on tour it's exciting to stick a few things in that I haven't done before, just 'cause then it's sort of like there's a bit of a nervous edge to it, which is quite cool -- except on the first night when you think 'Why did I do this? Why didn't I stay safe?'\"] SOUNDCUE (:19 OC: . . . I stay safe)\n\nMcCartney admitted that his primary reason for still going out and embarking on globe-trotting tours is that he loves performing more than almost anything: [\"Then the audience is the other big thing. The audience is amazingly warm these days. And what I do is, I tell my promoter, I'll say, 'Just put one of the shows on sale and just see how we're doing.' And he might ring me back and say: 'Fantastic! Sold out in an hour -- the whole thing!' So, I go 'Okay, I'm cool. They like me!'\"] SOUNDCUE (:19 OC: . . . they like me)\n\nUPDATED: Paul McCartney tour dates (subject to change):\n\nApril 28 - Spokane, WA - Spokane Arena\n\nMay 3 - Seattle, WA - Climate Pledge Arena\n\nMay 6 - Oakland, CA - Oakland Arena\n\nMay 13 - Los Angeles, CA - SoFi Stadium\n\nMay 17 - Fort Worth, TX - Dickies Arena\n\nMay 21 - Winston Salem, NC - Truist Field\n\nMay 25 - Hollywood, FL - Hard Rock Live\n\nMay 28 - Orlando, FL - Camping World Stadium\n\nMay 31 - Knoxville, TN - Thompson Boling Arena\n\nJune 4 - Syracuse, NY - Carrier Dome\n\nJune 7 - Boston, MA - Fenway Park\n\nJune 8 - Boston, MA - Fenway Park\n\nJune 12 - Baltimore, MD - Oriole Park\n\nJune 16 - East Rutherford, NJ- Met Life Stadium\n\nIN OTHER McCARTNEY NEWS\n\nMary McCartney, Paul and Linda McCartney's 52-year-old photographer daughter -- and host of the Food Network's Mary McCartney Serves It Up -- shed light on her famous dad's culinary talents.\n\nMary told London's The Express that there's definitely a difference between him when he's at home and at work: \"I see my dad in two very different ways. When it’s family, it’s family, and when he tries to tell a story everyone talks over him. Then when he’s on stage I think, 'Wow. He’s pretty amazing.'\"\n\nShe went on to explain, \"Dad can cook, he likes to make the lasagna out of mum's first cookbook, and he makes a very good mashed potato. If we’re all having Sunday lunch, he’s in charge of mash. He doesn’t put any special ingredients into it, I think it’s just because he takes the time. He mashes it and then spends ages whipping it with a fork -- and he’s not shy with the butter either.\"\n\nFor more info on the Food Network's Mary McCartney Serves It Up, log on to: https://bit.ly/35vBToj\n\nStevie Nicks had some tough words for Russian president Vladimir Putin comparing him to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler for his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday (February 26th), Nicks took to Instagram and addressed the loss of life and displacement of the Ukranian people following Russia's unwarranted invasion:\n\nAt 4 am this morning me and a friend sent a message to a lady in Ukraine who sent us a beautiful hand painted box -- to thank her again and check up on her after watching the news all night -- she immediately wrote back that she was home and still fine...\n\nAt 4:45 am she wrote us back that she was now 'just trying to escape'; that changed everything. Now I know someone, an innocent person, who is having her freedom taken from her. I have been crying ever since. My mom said to me after 9-11 – don’t forget what your father and I were fighting for; don’t forget it. . . (I am glad she isn’t here to see this).\n\nThis is Hitler coming back to haunt us. In one evening -- until now, an entire sovereign country has been full on invaded. How dare he. My heart is broken for our new friend – and for people of Ukraine -- I am so, so sorry.\n\nLove and prayers for them.\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nIn celebration of Billy Joel's 50th anniversary, the \"Piano Man\" has launched the \"Billy Joel New York State Of Mind\" Landmarks website -- and the digital-only release of Places, the first in a series of thematic EP's showcasing select tracks from across his career.\n\nFans can log on to the \"Landmarks\" website at https://nysom.billyjoel.com/ to explore an interactive map highlighting 50 special New York locations connected to Billy's life and songs, \"from Cold Spring Harbor to Madison Square Garden, from Sullivan Street to the Hudson River Line.\"\n\nThe site includes song histories, listening/saving options, and more. Fans can offer up their own suggestions for the \"New York State Of Mind\" website, which could expand the map beyond its current 50 locations.\n\nPlaces, the five-track EP showcases songs associated with New York locations on the interactive map: \"New York State Of Mind,\" \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song),\" \"Big Man On Mulberry Street,\" \"Everybody Loves You Now\" and \"Miami 2017 (Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway).\"\n\nAny time that New York has faced tough times -- be it 9/11 or Hurricane Sandy, Billy Joel has been front and center -- often on the front lines supporting and cheering for New York on many levels. He recalled back in the '70s when the \"Big Apple's\" dire straits made him realize New York was the only place he could truly call home: [\"I had moved back to New York from California; it was 1975 to '76. There was a famous headline when New York City was going to default. And New York turned to the feds and said, 'Can you help bail us out?' -- and there's a famous Daily News headline, 'Ford To New York: 'Drop Dead.'' And I remember seeing that headline -- I was out in L.A. -- and I said, 'I'm goin' back. I'm goin' home. If the city's goin' down, I'm goin down with the city.'\"] SOUNDCUE (:24 OC: . . . with the city)\n\nIN OTHER BILLY JOEL NEWS\n\nDuring his Saturday night (February 26th) concert at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium, Billy Joel paid tribute to Procol Harum leader Gary Brooker, who died on February 19th at age 76 after a battle with cancer.\n\nFollowing his nightly rendition of \"Only The Good Die Young,\" Billy tackled Brooker's 1967 \"Summer Of Love\" standard, \"A Whiter Shade Of Pale.\"\n\nDavid Crosby revealed that despite selling his music catalogue to music mogul Irving Azoff's Iconic Music Group -- he'll soon be strapped. Crosby, who gladly followed estranged bandmember Neil Young in pulling his music off Spotify in the face of the recent Joe Rogan controversy, has long blamed music streaming and its owners unwillingness to compensate artists as a huge reason for his financial woes.\n\nIn a frank new interview with Stereogum, Crosby revealed, \"I’m going to run out of money in a couple of years and then I’ll have to sell my house. That’s just how that is. I can’t do s*** about it. I can’t play live anymore. I’m 80-years-old and I’m very fragile health-wise. I can’t change the marketplace. They’re making the money and they’re not going to change that. They’re not going to suddenly develop a sense of moral responsibility. They’re scummy people.\"\n\nAs far eventually allowing his music back on the streaming platform: \"No, I don’t want to be in there. I don’t like ’em and their quality’s lousy and their payscale’s lousy and I don’t want anything to do with them. . . I do not envision going back.\"\n\nCrosby went on to say, \"You have to understand -- I don’t like Spotify. I don’t like any of the streamers, because they don’t pay us properly. Their proportion is wrong. They’re making billions with a b and they’re paying out pennies with a p. That’s not OK. It’s not OK in that it took away half my income, and it’s not OK in that, especially, it makes it impossibly difficult for young people to make it in the business. It doesn’t pay them anything. It’s wrong. I don’t like Spotify on purpose because of that. I don’t like their quality level either. They bum up the signal pretty badly. But they and all the other streaming services are ripping us off. They’re quite happy with it. They have no intention of changing it.\"\n\nNot too long ago, David Crosby told us that these days he doesn't enter into any aspect of his life -- personally or professionally -- without a great deal of soul searching: [\"I look at myself a lot, I made an awful amount of mistakes in my life, and I've done harm. And I've had to look at myself. I had a year in a prison cell to look at myself. A lot of time to think. So, I do think about what I do and why and what it means and if it's significant, or not.\"] SOUNDCUE (:18 OC: . . . significant or not)"
