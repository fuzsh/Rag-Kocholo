In 2023 there were 350 new species described.\n\nWe record 36,936 valid fish species, including 18,781 valid fish species with the tag âHabitat: freshwaterâ.\n\nNew feature: See the latest additions and changes made to Eschmeyer's Catalog since the previous monthly update.\n\nEschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes contributed to Shoal's New Species 2023: The Freshwater Fish Species Described in 2023, the third in an annual series to promote freshwater fish species awareness and conservation. Check them out at ShoalConservation.org.\n\nNotice from Apr. 9, 2020 - Authors' Count of Species/Subspecies Descriptions. See how many species/subspecies each author has described.\n\nThis list was previously posted as a list of \"batting averages\", comparing total number of species descriptions to number still considered valid. The \"batting average\" concept was originally conceived by Dr. Eschmeyer for our 2010 paper \"Marine fish diversity: history of knowledge and discovery (Pisces)\", and was meant to show differences between previous eras and the modern era. It was not meant to be a critique of any individuals, nor a measure of any individual's scientific acumen. The \"batting average\" concept having served its purpose, it's no longer relevant to present it. In addition, most individuals are only interested in the total number of new descriptions, which is what we present here. - Jon Fong\n\nWe are making additions to:\n\nVan der Laan, R., W. N.

Van der Laan.\n\nBy default, search results will not include item 3 names -- unavailable names that detract from the main list of available names.

Please remember that the title of a paper often differs in three places: the title on the paper itself, the contents listed by the journal, and in the PDF provided by the journal. Ron tends to follow the title on the pdf for recent papers and the title on the original for earlier publications. Many of our dates of publication are documented for priority purposes.

Fishbase is a more comprehensive database for a different audience, but they use Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes in their authority file.\n\nSome other useful sites for fishes are (1) Fishbase [Fishbase team, Manila]; (2) www.stri.org/sftep -- A comprehensive database on Shorefishes of the Tropical Eastern Pacific (and of the Western Atlantic) [Ross Robertson]; (3) shark-references.com -- A database on elasmobranchs, with over 13,000 references, information on taxa, type specimens, etc. [JÃ¼rgen PollerspÃ¶ck]; (4) FishWisePro.com -- a comprehensive relational database of more than 99,350 scientific species name combinations and over 34,300 well-identified (mostly marine) fish pictures [Dennis Polack]; (5) Freshwater Fish List, 38th edition August 2023; (6) ETYFish Project (derivations of Fish Names) by Christopher Scharpf; and (7) BioStor, for Biodiversity Heritage Library references. A very useful site is Worldfish.de [not associated with Fishbase or Worldfish]. Maintained by Michal MikÅ¡ik and Erwin Schraml. They post new fish taxa and references as they are published.\n\nNotes\n\nA summary paper was published in 2010 from Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes database that might be of interest to users of the Catalog. \"Marine fish diversity: history of knowledge and discovery (Pisces).\" By William N. Eschmeyer, Ronald Fricke, Jon D. Fong & Dennis A. Polack. Zootaxa, no. 2525:19-50 (2 July 2010, open access, click title to download).\n\nAs always, notifying us of missed original descriptions and errors in the database or providing PDFs of recent papers is most welcome.\n\nBill Eschmeyer edited type localities and standardized many place names. Our style is to use current place names found on an English map (or from Wikipedia and Google sites). Should you need original localities, they can be found in the original descriptions or from particular museum holdings (often online).\n\nMany scientific names of fish species are based on personal names; some were found to be incorrect. For example, Jordan and co-workers spelled Japanese names ending in \"a\" with a terminal \"e\" as in matsubarae; that is acceptable, with the name Latinized first. So those names do not end in \"i\". Remarks are provided by Eschmeyer in this version for most species based on personal names. For a review of this very technical subject, see Dubois 2007: Zootaxa No. 1550:49-68.\n\nNew treatment of synonyms: Often an author revises a genus and treats a species in detail but does not mention the species synonyms (if any). If he/she does not mention the synonyms (rather common in recent treatments) and moves the valid âparentâ species to a different genus, do we move the synonyms automatically, although the revising author may not have studied or assessed the synonyms? In the past, we did not move the synonyms. Typically, this often resulted in the synonyms being in a different current genus than the valid parent species. We now move the synonyms to the genus of the valid parent species, but no âstatus referenceâ showing the new generic placement is found with the synonym. Some synonyms will be moved incorrectly, but it is considered more desirable to have the potential synonyms in the same current genus as the valid parent species.\n\nSome conventions used in Eschmeyer's Catalog\n\nAuthor plus date and a species code: The code of Zoological Nomenclature does not require a comma between the author and date, only a suggestion. In fact, we consider that confusing as that is traditionally used to show a cited reference in journal publications and not a species authorship and date. Genus+species+author+date (with parentheses as needed) is a (nearly) unique code or formula to define every species [2 known exceptions]. So you will find no comma between the author and date. Some journals are now treating species in this way.\n\nFigures: Under a new species heading, some journals list (a) only the major figure, some list (b) all figures (including maps, habitats and graphs), and (c) some give figures showing the full view and any illustrated parts of the species. We give all figures that show a full view and any anatomical part of the species, so our listing of figures often differs from the treatment by a journal in the original description (as listed in the species heading).\n\nType localities: We give a current place name that one will find on a Google search or in an âEnglishâ atlas. For some species described many years ago, one may find both the original locality and in parentheses a modern name for that locality. Many collections now have their holdings on-line, and it is there one can usually find the actual original locality if needed. Current localities are often augmented by additional information, such as coordinates.\n\nAuthors: We have added initials in brackets to distinguish all individual authors of genera and species.\n\nOther sections\n\nGenera/Species of Fishes by Family/Subfamily -- Total valid taxa reflect new taxa added minus taxa moved into synonymy plus taxa newly moved to valid. The classification is as used in Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes. Prepared by Bill Eschmeyer and Jon Fong, with modifications by Richard Van der Laan.\n\nFamily-Group Names -- Priority applies to Family-group names. It did not in early years. As classifications are refined with use of more subfamilies and tribes, it is required to use the oldest available family-group name for these new taxa.\n\nIchthyological Collections -- Presented are those specimen collections mentioned in the main Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes database, especially as repositories of type specimens. Besides museum names and abbreviations, this includes WWW sites, cross-referencing of abbreviations, and selection of museums by country, along with type catalogs, historical articles, name changes, transfers, and other items for individual collections. Prepared by Ron Fricke and Bill Eschmeyer.\n\nIchthyological Journals -- There are nearly 2600 individual journals or monograph series in Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes database. We provide full citations, and other information such as changes in titles, published duration, ISSN numbers, WWW sites, etc. Prepared by Ron Fricke and Bill Eschmeyer.\n\nChanges and Additions -- We present a list of status and spelling changes made since the previous update. From left to right, we show the basionym with the previous status and name, followed by the new status and name. Below that we list the genera and species added since the last update.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nAcknowledgments for Ron Fricke (2024): Arturo Acero Pizarro, Rosalia Aguilar-Medrano, Harald Ahnelt, Gerald Allen, Felipe Alonso, K.
