        "text": "Learning from my generational perspective\n\nMy name is Aryam and I was born in the 80’s in Venezuela. This 2023 I turned 38 years old and my curiosity about technological adaptation, and learning processes is bigger than ever! I always felt I was a part of a generational joint between millennials and those who belong to the X generation because of my preference for the classic and traditional over the innovative and new. I have always marveled about the immense technological evolution throughout my life, perhaps because, we’ve grown being the blessed when it comes to new devices. I open my eyes there’s a Betamax. Close them and open again there’s a VCR. I remember clearly it was the year 1998 when I used to collect an edgy indie biweekly newspaper that was sold in my city. This was my way, among others, to keep up to date with what was going on around the music, fashion, and those people that were 8–10 years on average older than me. I felt they were my tribe way more than those people reading Seventeen. There, in the Urbe magazine is where I read for the first time about the DVD; that there are psychotropic drugs which effects could last up to 20 years or indefinitely, that sex was quite a dangerous thing, and almost everything about Y2K! I remember thinking to myself that the idea of DVD was stupid because, where are we going to put all of these Blockbusters and what, is everybody gonna toss their VCRs? Impossible! Or so I thought. I was so wrong I owned these devices myself in a way short blink of an eye and found myself profoundly desiring to own one of those Kindles released when I started to study Literature and Linguistics around 2008. I still study a similar thing and constantly question myself about the technologies surrounding us. Such and immense amount of technology that I get concerned we depend on the technological crutches so much that we get, to a degree, to forget how to use our own brain plasticity for regular tasks (memorizing a price at the store, recalling a number, handwritten notes in class). This is the background of this conversation I have the pleasure to have with two of my friends who happen to have a wide experience when it comes to education. I want to share this conversation with you, especially if you’re younger than me, because we might throw away our prejudice toward new technologies and learning.\n\nI initiate this conversation with Dr. Eddy Borges-Rey, who is an Associate Professor at Northwestern University-Qatar with an emphasis in Digital Journalism and Emerging Media. Welcome, Eddy! Please tell those who don’t know you a bit more about what is it that you do.\n\nEddy: “I’ve been fortunate enough to spend about 15 years working as a broadcast journalist and media producer before academia. Alongside my professional journey, I have a profound passion for music, which I explore in my research. I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the field and to my students’ growth.”\n\nAry: I am personally a pen and paper person, where do you fall in this line; are you team pen and paper as well?\n\nEddy: “I find myself drawn to writing within digital platforms, mainly because it aligns with my work in digital journalism and scholarship. The ability to quickly edit, share, and collaborate online is incredibly useful. That said, for more conceptual stages of my research, I still cherish the tactile feel of pen and paper. It’s a more direct way of creating.”\n\nAry: In my investigation, I found several sources that explore the subject of adaptation to technologies, handwriting, and learning processes, some of them concluding that handwriting is perhaps better for our brain and memory if you were to choose one over the other, but that’s not the whole story. For me this tactile feeling is a necessity as well, I noticed that I could memorize better, and, turns out, that it’s almost impossible to write a recipe, mathematical calculations, or, in my deeply subjective experience, a poem. The more I research it the more I believe both are in movement and that there are several instances in which that choice might have a reasonable basis.\n\nIn your experience and from your perspective, how has education evolved since you were a kid and, if there were any, what elements of the education you had should be back or gone forever?\n\nEddy: “Education has transformed dramatically over the years, particularly with the advent of technology. In my view, the emphasis on critical thinking and ethical considerations, especially in media, should be a focal point. While many traditional aspects of education are invaluable, the integration of technology in learning is something that we should continue to embrace and refine.”\n\n“While it’s essential to stay abreast of digital tools and platforms, foundational skills like critical analysis and ethical judgment are timeless and crucial”.\n\nAry: For the generations reading this article, what are you best education tips you can offer? Pen, paper, a little bit of it all?… Do you have any “secrets”?\n\nEddy: “My advice to students would be to value both traditional and modern learning methods. While it’s essential to stay abreast of digital tools and platforms, foundational skills like critical analysis and ethical judgment are timeless and crucial. It’s about finding the right balance and being open to continuous learning.”\n\nAry: As an experienced Lecturer and Professor, do you consider learning advantageous nowadays? Which elements of new technologies are essential inside the classroom?\n\nEddy: “Learning today is more dynamic and interconnected than ever, thanks to technological advancements. In my field, understanding the implications of data journalism, AI, and digital media is crucial. These elements help students navigate the complex media landscape. I believe that blending traditional educational values with modern technological tools is key to effective learning.”\n\nA cup filled with colors\n\nAry: Now that you mention effective learning, I want to confess I’ve been keeping the questions I want to ask Maritza for the second part of this interview because I’m familiar with the work you’ve been producing with her on Instagram under@periodismobonito (which translates to beautiful journalism in Spanish as the three of us are native Spanish speakers). One of the first things that came to my mind, is specifically how scary artificial intelligence can be, as a potential threat to our intellectual capabilities, thinking, our jobs, etc. Sometimes I get the sensation that we’re inside this dystopian surrounding that could be so harmful, but yet again, I think about Stephen Hawkings, one of the most prominent minds of humanity, and I reflect on the extent to which technology was an imperative necessity for him. How many more minds are trapped inside their body or their own disability that makes artificial intelligence and newer technologies so miraculous and important for education in the moment we live now? Thanks why I want to ask you, Maritza, all your views about this important conversation. Welcome, Maritza! Tell us more about this work that you do.\n\nMaritza: “My name is Maritza Pinto. I am deeply involved in the realms of education, music, and journalism. Currently, I am a Learning Assistant at an International School. My academic background includes an MA in Education from the University of Malaga, focusing on innovative practices in education and social inclusion, and a BA in Broadcast Journalism. Music is a significant part of my life; I’ve been a flute and piccolo player in various orchestras and currently study Arabic music and the Ney. My journey in journalism has led me to speak at TEDx and manage social media for one of the radios of Qatar Media Corporation.”\n\nAry: What is your take on this, are you team pen and paper or digital writing, or perhaps in your view, there’s a better team today?\n\nMaritza: “I appreciate both traditional and digital mediums. Pen and paper hold a special place for musical compositions, creativity, overcoming writer’s block, and personal reflections, offering a tangible connection to thoughts through the sensory experience. However, in journalism and education, digital writing is indispensable for its efficiency and reach. Nowadays, the use of digital writing in music also has immense potential because you can listen to the music that you are transcribing or practicing, even obtaining real sounds from the most famous musicians for your own creations. You can practice your solos with a digital orchestra; it is indeed an incredible tool”.\n\nAry: Tell me, from the time Maritza was a little girl to now, how do you see learning processes and how do you reconcile, in retrospective, traditional education with the present moment?\n\n“I believe in blending the best of both worlds, using my experiences to bridge traditional values with modern methodologies. Technology is our reality, and we should know how to use it as a resource to enrich the learning processes”\n\nMaritza: “Looking back, I’ve seen a substantial shift in learning processes. Traditional education provided a strong foundation, but today’s dynamic and technology-driven environment demands adaptability and innovation. I believe in blending the best of both worlds, using my experiences to bridge traditional values with modern methodologies. Technology is our reality, and we should know how to use it as a resource to enrich the learning processes”.\n\nAry: I agree with you as this digital literacy is essential in our day, but as I mentioned above, this might be more than a matter of preference and rather a necessity to many people. Tell us more about the work you’ve done, including your work @peridismobonito, and based on that, what are the pearls of knowledge you’ve gathered about technological education, and what do you think is needed, not only for neurodivergent people but also, other minorities for who classic learning might not be the best or only option?"
