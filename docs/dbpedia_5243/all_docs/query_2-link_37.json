        "meta_description": "Con Sentimiento by NOSLEN NOEL, released 09 July 2021\n\n1. El Carretero\n2. Paisajes Naturales\n3. La Sitiera\n4. Camina Y Ven Pa La Loma\n5. Midley Cubano\n6. Siboney\n7. Camino Por Vereda\n8. El Gallo Pinto\n9. Habanera Tu\n10. Con Sentimiento\n\n„Con Sentimiento“ is the debut of NOSLEN NOEL, one of the most promising young talents in Cuban music and disciple of great Cuban lute virtuosos like NISITO, JORGE FELIX, BARBARITO TORRES and MARIO FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\nBorn february 15th, 2002 in Guines (54 km south of Havana), NOEL NOSLEN is still very young but already has an impressive CV: at the age of 12 he started performing at the Casa de la Trova, toured as soloist in Mexico and Venezuela in 2016 and a year later (age 15) NOSLEN won the first prize in the instrumentalist category of the prestigious “Eduardo Saborit Competition”. Actually not very surprising when you consider that NOSLEN’s teachers were great Cuban lute players like NISITO, JORGE FÉLIX, MARIO FRANCISCO and the famous BARBARITO TORRES.\r\nNow the time has come to present this incredible and highly promising talent to the audience outside Cuba: „Con Sentimiento“ displays not only the instrumental and artistic virtuosity of the young musician but also his skills as a composer and arranger (the title track has been penned by NOSLEN himself). 10 tracks of classical Cuban music that everybody knows and loves from the famous BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB (including IBRAHIM FERRER‘s classic „Camino por vereda“) and that transport the unmissable nostalgic and touching „Cuban flavour“.\r\nFrom the liner notes by Cesar Perea:\r\n“NOSLÉN is an artist with excellent technique, fluency and expressiveness who will surely earn a place among the most renowned musicians of his country within a short time … this is his first record production and he has done it very well, he included anthological and new songs of great quality to which he has put a lot of flavor and respect; there is here a combination of classic themes of the sonera tradition and of the song in which appear indispensable names: ERNESTO LECUONA, RAFAEL HERNÁNDEZ, CELINA GONZÁLEZ, GUILLERMO PORTABALES, EDUARDO SÁNCHEZ DE LA FUENTE, ABELARDO VALDÉS, IBRAHIM FERRER, RAFAEL LÓPEZ GONZÁLES who share the program with some new ones like those of the virtuoso of the tres PANCHO AMAT, JOSÉ MANUEL RODRÍGUEZ and even Noslén himself.\r\nFor now, we can enjoy this album that is more than good for that, it has all the ingredients, we just need to put it to sound and will be caught by its flavor ... and nostalgia.\r\nLong live your art, Noslén!”",
