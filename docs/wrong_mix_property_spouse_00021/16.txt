Co-owners of IPL's Kings XI Punjab team, Preity Zinta and Ness Wadia were in a relationship from 2005-2009. The couple maintained a cordial relationship even post break up. So what went wrong?

The couple, were considered to have one of the most stable relationship in tinsel town.

While they were always open about their relationship from the beginning, there were constant speculations about their marriage or break up.

in this file picture, Preity Zinta and Indian industrialist Ness Wadia were spotted leaving the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) head office in Mumbai January 24, 2008.

Even though they broke up in 2009, they remained friends and worked together as they co-owned King's XI Punjab team together.

According to the recent FIR that Preity has filed against Ness, she had warned him earlier as well for misbehaving with her.

The couple also never got the blessing of Ness Wadia's mother, Maureen who reportedly never approved of their relationship and maintained a stoic 'No Comments' stand whenever she was asked about to speak about Preity.

In December 2006, another controversy featured Zinta when Ness Wadia was reported to have attacked construction workers at her residence in Bandra. Reportedly, a woman was critically injured and a child was hurt in the incident.

Zinta reacted angrily at hearing these rumours reported in the national news and confronted journalists, criticising their conduct. She challenged the press to deliver proof, and offered Rs 1 crore if an injured woman was found. No evidence was found and the rumour has subsequently been regarded as false.

The couple had appeared hand in hand at Abhishek Bachchan and AIshwarya Rai's wedding in 2007 and many, at that point of time, had believed that they were next in line.
