Two years after a case of molestation and criminal intimidation was registered against him by actress Preity Zinta, businessman Ness Wadia on Thursday recorded his statement with the police in connection with the case.

In June 2014, Ms Zinta had approached the Marine Drive police and had alleged that Mr Wadia had verbally abused her as well as manhandled her during an argument that erupted at the Wankhede stadium during an Indian Premier League cricket match in May 2014.

Sources said that on Thursday evening, Mr Wadia reached the office of Deputy Commissioner of Police Manoj Kumar Sharma, Zone I with his lawyer and recorded his statement.

When contacted, Mr. Sharma confirmed that the statement had been recorded but declined to go into the details.
