        "text": "Mumbai: Actress Preity Zinta was at Mumbai's Wankhede stadium on Tuesday evening as the police recorded her supplementary statement in the case against her former boyfriend Ness Wadia. According to the police, Preity has named 14 witnesses, whose statements will also be recorded soon.\n\nThe actress identified three places where she was allegedly abused. Preity has said that Ness's friends were also there when she was abused.\n\nThe actor also told police that an Australian national who is a relative of a team member got up and asked Ness to keep quiet when Ness was abusing. Preity has told the police that two team staff members were also witness to the incident.\n\nMumbai Police said, \"Preity has narrated the entire incident and it was required. We didn't have the list of the witnesses and wanted to know the named of the people from the three spots she has mentioned in her compliant. So, that is why the spot panchnama was sone and her statement was recorded in BCCI office. There are 12- 14 new witnesses with us. We could not record direct evidence so far.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Wadia's lawyer has informed the police that Wadia is willing to cooperate and is ready to be questioned.\n\nPreity has accused Wadia of abusing and threatening her during an IPL match between Kings XVI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede stadium on May 30. The police have, so far, recorded statements of eight people in the case.\n\nIn her written complaint to police, Preity had claimed, \"I left for my seat, but he (Ness) came up to me at my seat and started screaming and abusing me in front of everyone.\"\n\nPreity had filed a police complaint on June 12 alleging that Wadia outraged her modesty at the stadium on May 30 during an IPL match, a charge dubbed as \"false and baseless\" by him.\n\nPreity and Wadia ended their five-year-old relationship a few years back but continued to share business interests."
