(Also Read: Don't Want to Harm Anyone, Only Protect Myself: Preity Zinta on Complaint Against Ness Wadia)\n\n\"A fairy tale love story turns into a hate story! What an unfortunate end to the Priety Zinta Ness Wadia romance,\" tweeted Mr Bhatt, who co-wrote the 1999 film Sangharsh which starred Preity Zinta.\n\nMs Zinta lodged a written complaint against the Bombay Dyeing scion with the Marine Drive police station on Thursday night. She is said to have accused him of grabbing her hand and abusing her during a cricket match held in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium on May 30.\n\nMr Wadia, who co-owns the the Kings XI Punjab IPL team with the actress, has denied the allegations, terming them \"totally false and baseless\".\n\nThe duo reportedly started dating in 2005, and their relationship came to an end in 2009.\n\nEntertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.
