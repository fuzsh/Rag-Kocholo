Until there is a change in the thought-process of men here, until they stop thinking of women as an inferior sex, whether she is an actress or a menial worker, any female will be a target for harassment.\" National Commission for Women (NCW) Chairperson Mamta Sharma said, \"Basically, they are co-partners for the Punjab team. They have also been together for a long time. They broke up in 2009. I feel that no man has the right to touch or behave badly with a woman. Nevertheless, let the investigations take place,then only we will know how far the allegations are true.\" Preity Zinta is the co-owner of Kings XI Punjab cricket team of the Indian Premier League series (IPL). Reportedly, the actress and the businessman had broken their five-year long relationship sometime back. Although a rape is reported in India every 21 minutes on average, law enforcement failures mean that such crimes - a symptom of pervasive sexual and caste oppression - are often not reported or properly investigated, human rights groups say. Sex crimes against young girls and women are widespread in India. Victims are often females from poor, marginalised, low-caste communities. Women's rights experts and lawyers say rape victims also have to endure harsh treatment from an archaic, poorly funded and insensitive criminal justice system. (ANI)"
