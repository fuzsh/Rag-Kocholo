        "text": "Bollywood actor Preity Zinta, who has accused industrialist Ness Wadia of outraging modesty of a woman, has said her former boyfriend had thrown burning cigarettes at her and locked her up in a room even before the May 30 incident at Wankhede Stadium after which she filed a police complaint.\n\nMumbai Police continues its investigation in the case and Preity had submitted a letter to Commissioner of Police Rakesh Maria on June 30 when she met him to seek permission to go abroad.\n\n\"Ness's behaviour towards me is getting more and more aggressive and violent over a period of time. From throwing burning cigarettes at my face to locking me up in rooms and manhandling me, I have seen it all with him,\" she said in a letter to Mumbai Police Commissioner.\n\nA police officer privy to the probe told a news agency in India (PTI) that Preity is worried Ness might harm her physically.\n\nShe wrote: \"I (Preity) just want him (Ness) to be kept away from me so I can live in peace, otherwise one unfortunate day, in a fit of rage, he will kill me and that really scares me.\"\n\n\"I had no intention to harm him (Ness) in anyway by lodging a police complaint, but I had no option left but to come to the police department for my safety. I am genuinely paranoid that he will try to harm me directly or indirectly in the future,\" she said.\n\nIn her complaint to the police on June 12, Preity had accused Ness of molesting, abusing and threatening her during an IPL match between Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings on May 30 at Wankhede Stadium.\n\nBoth are co-owners of IPL team Kings XI Punjab.\n\nWadia had dismissed the charge as \"false\". There was no response from Wadia group on fresh allegations made by Preity against the industrialist in her letter to the police."
