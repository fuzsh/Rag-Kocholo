She also hit the headlines for her complaint against former boyfriend, businessman and Kings XI Punjab co owner Ness Wadia. Preity alleged that her ex molested, abused and threatened her inside the Wankhede stadium during an IPL match between Kings XI Punjab the Chennai Super Kings. Preity even took to social media to speak her mind and wrote a long note to express her feelings. As we look at Preity Zinta's life, here are a few lesser known facts about the actress who once dominated the Box Office and made her mark in Bollywood through sheer hard work!\n\nPreity faced a personal tragedy when her father, Durganand Zinta, an officer in the Indian Army was involved in a car crash when Preity was only 13. He passed away and her mother, Nilprabha Zinta, who was also in the car, became bedridden. She has two brothers, out of which one is an officer in the Indian Army. Preity herself narrowly escaped death twice: both in the year 2004. Once after a temptation concert in Colombo in 2004 and the second time in December 2004 when Preity was vacationing in Thailand and tragedy struck when the Tsunami swept Thailand and its popular tourists spots, claiming many lives. According to a report in The Times of India, the actress was quoted saying, \"I wrote down all the things that I have in life to be grateful about and it was quite a long list.\" (sic)\n\nIs a major fan of the hit TV series The Simpsons. Was the original choice for the film 'Marigold' which also starred Salman Khan. But Ali Larter stepped in to play the character. Preity is very close to her Koi Mil Gaya co star Hrithik Roshan and interestingly, she was supposed to make her debut opposite him in Tara Rum Pum Pum but it got shelved. Is not a follower of any religion in particular. According to her interview in The Times of India, Zinta was quoted saying, \"I believe in good deeds, in karma, I don't believe in going to temples. For me, religion is very personal. It's all about having faith ... We have heard and read that all religions are equal. Now I am increasingly believing in this.\"\n\nWas a complete tomboy growing up and was fond of literature and the works of Shakespeare. An entrepreneur actress and activist, Preity has never been afraid to speak her mind. During the 2003 Bharat Shah controversy where some Bollywood celebs were dragged into it, Preity was the only witness not to retract her statements in court against the mafia. Her bravery did not go unnoticed and she was awarded the Godfrey Phillips National Bravery Award. Was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of East London in 2010.\n\nIn 2004, Preity joined a group of South Asian commentators for BBC News Online where she wrote several columns and her first was titled, \"The changing face of Bollywood\". She went on to write columns like \"Odds stacked against Indian women\" and Facing death in Sri Lanka and Thailand where she spoke about her Tsunami experience. An activist at heart, Preity has spoken against female infanticide, has been involved in AIDS awareness drives and was also a part of campaigns to clean Mumbai with former beau Ness Wadia where Preity took to the streets to clean the city up. Preity also adopted 34 girls from the Mother Miracle orphanage in Rishikesh in 2009 where she took up the responsibility to give financial aid to these girls by providing them with food, education and clothing.\n\nIs also good friends with SRK and his wife, Abhishek Bachchan, Bobby Deol, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Saif Ali Khan. Was said to be very close to her father and loved him dearly. Her favourite dish is said to be kadi chawal and the actress digs ice creams. Her idols include Guru Dutt, Madhubala, Waheeda Rehman and Sridev from Bollywood and Al Pacino from Hollywood. Was appointed as an Ambassador for the Loomba Trust which works for the welfare of widows and their children. Preity was also the Indian Goodwill Ambasaador of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).\n\nWas the youngest owner to own an IPL team as of 2009 and all the partners reportedly paid $76 million to acquire the franchise. This also included ex boyfriend and businessman Ness Wadia. At this year's IPL final match between Kings XI Punjab and Kolkota Knight Riders, Preity accused Ness of allegedly molesting her and filed a case against him. Was linked to former model marc Robinson and was dragged into a controversy by singer Suchitra Krishnamurthy who alleged that she split from husband Shekhar Kapur because of Preity. She issued a statement claiming the accuses [accusations?] to be false.\n\nAbout working with Shah Rukh Khan, Preity wrote, \"The only actor who can make me cry at the drop of a hat in an emotion scene is @iamsrk omg ! I have cried in soooo many scenes with him\". [sic] Much to everyone's surprise, Preity even revealed that she was scared of working with Salman Khan. She wrote, \"The only actor I used to be scared of before I worked with him was @BeingSalmanKhan I don't know why but I was\". [sic] However, both Salman and Preity share a good rapport today. (The Times of India)\n\nHer love life\n\nPreity Zinta's controversial love life\n\nThe Times of India The Times of India, With inputs from PTI\n\nPreity Zinta may well be out of the Bollywood scenario of late. The actress was last seen in her home production - Ishkq in Paris. However it seems that things are now looking up for Preity Zinta. She recently made a revelation that she is involved in a romantic relationship. However Preity Zinta refused to give a name to the mystery man. The actress-turned-entrepreneur was reported to have said, \"Tired of personal life being played out in the tabloids.\"\n\nNess Wadia\n\n(See below)\n\nYuvraj Singh Preity Zinta has been infamously linked to Yuvraj Singh. It all began when Preity became the co-owner of Indian Premiere League team - Kings XI Punjab. The first season saw the cricketer as the captain. At that time things were reportedly on the rocks between Preity and Ness Wadia. Reportedly that is when Preity and Yuvraj came together. The actress has been caught several times hugging Yuvraj. According to reports Preity Zinta also went on record to say that Yuvraj Singh is a flirt. Rumours were also rife that Yuvraj had bought a lavish pad close to Preity's suburban home so that the couple could spend more time together. However with no ground for the rumours, things between Preity and Yuvraj fizzled out.\n\nShekhar Kapur Shekhar Kapur and Preity Zinta's affair is considered one of most outrageous ones. Initially Shekhar was to make a film with Zinta, but things never materialised. While all along Preity was in a relationship with Ness Wadia, but a new blame game made shocking headlines. Reportedly, Shekhar Kapur's ex-wife Suchitra Krishnamoorthy alleged that she parted ways with Shekar because of a brewing affair between Shekhar and Preity. With such mighty claims, Preity was as shocked as the entire industry. According to a DNA report, Preity had stated then, \"It is unfortunate that I am bearing the brunt of someone else’s paranoia. She’s clearly unstable and I wish her a speedy recovery.” Interestingly Shekhar Kapur was last seen on the big screen in Preity Zinta's film 'Ishkq in Paris' where he played her father.\n\nMarc Robinson Years back Preity Zinta was reported to be in an intimate relationship with model Marc Robinson. The two were reportedly in a live-in relationship. However after staying together for a couple of years, the duo broke off. Marc Robinson later made several revelations on a reality show he had been a part of. Reports suggested that Marc spoke about his alleged affair with Preity, and they broke off due to their chalk and cheese lifestyles. Rumours were rife that the couple didn’t hit off well because of differences in their daily life.\n\n2014: Engagement?\n\nThe Times of India reported in June 2014: If the latest grapevine is to be believed, bubbly actress Preity Zinta has been engaged to Los Angeles based corporate executive named Jin.\n\nWith Ness Wadia\n\nSources\n\nThe sources of this section include: Ness Wadia's new love reason for Priety Zinta's charges?

The duo had started dating in 2005, and their relationship came to an end in 2009.\n\n(Famously, there is little love lost between Preity and Ness' mother Maureen Wadia who once pointedly remarked that she didn't care whether her son dated a Zinta or a zebra).\n\nNess being a businessman, had come up in a partnership with Preity Zinta when they were together. The two became co-owners of Kings XI Punjab team. The inseparable couple was reportedly seen avoiding each other. In 2009, the IPL matches had Preity and Ness were reportedly cheering from two different sides of the stadium. Later the duo tried to maintain a ‘friendly’ relationship. The actress had moved on amicably.\n\nFor a while.\n\nYes, of course we are friends. When you date someone for that long how can you not be friends? But we are not best friends. We don't talk to each other every day because that's weird! I'm sure if something ever went wrong he would stand by me and vice versa but there's nothing more than that. -- Preity Zinta\n\nThat's what Preity Zinta had said when asked about moving on after the break-up of her five-year-old relationship with Ness Wadia (The Times Of India, April 17, 2012).\n\nKXIP\n\nThey maintained a professional relationship as coowners of KXIP, and neither has been known to seriously date another until Wadia starting seeing this dusky model-actress. Sources in KXIP say arguments and bust-ups between the two team owners are not uncommon with Preity herself mentioning another incident of bad behaviour on Wadia's part during a team auction.\n\nThe former lovers, who both have a23 per cent stake each in KXIP, have also feuded over their involvement in the team. While Wadia's camp accuses her of being just the face of the team and staying away from the nitty-gritty of day-to-day operations, it is learnt that Preity had written a letter to Ness a couple of months ago listing out her contribution, and to which he did not even reply adding to the acrimony between the two.\n\nWhy did they break up?\n\nFriends of Wadia allege that the bad blood between the two former lovers was the result of his having found love with another woman and moving on.\n\nSources close to Preity denied such suggestions and said, \"Preity is in a relationship and is safe and secure about it. She is not upset or hurt about Ness Wadia's relationship with someone. In fact, she is enjoying the happy phase in her life.\"\n\nSince his breakup, Ness has had been associated with several women - Nargis Fakhri, among them. We believe, the object of his affections is also a certain heiress from the Middle-East with desi roots, who goes by the name of Hannah. She is a stunner, with Mommy Wadia reportedly approving her poise and her pedigree. This is not the first time that Ness has reportedly dated an heiress.Wadia is now reportedly dating a sultry model-turned actress who broke off her engagement with her long term beau a few months ago.\n\nNess Wadia's B-Town connection: The industrialist was good friends with Manisha Koirala in the early '90s. Almost a decade later, he was also said to be good friends with Lara Dutta.\n\nMay 2014/ A preity nessy affair (or The Ness Mess)\n\nIn 2014 things took an ugly turn when Preity Zinta filed a police complaint against her former boyfriend and businessman Ness Wadia (born 1970), alleging that on May 30 2014 he molested, abused and threatened her inside Wankhede stadium in south Mumbai.\n\nOn the day of the match on May 30 2014 which was also Ness Wadia's birthday, the long-simmering resentments between the two erupted into an ugly and very public spat. Sources say that as part of his birthday celebrations, Wadia had invited his mother Maureen, his nephew and several of his friends to his box in the Garware Pavilion at Wankhede for KXIP's match against Chennai Super Kings. But when his party arrived Ness found that all his reserved seats had been taken by Preity's associates leaving his mother standing and waiting for a seat for several minutes.\n\nSources claim that Ness, distressed by this, took up the matter with Preity asking her how she would feel if her mother had to be made to stand and wait. Wadia claims that his request to Preity to get the seats vacated went unheeded. The actress on her part claims that Wadia blew his top and started to misbehave with her.\n\nIn her FIR she states: \"He came up to me at my seat and started screaming and abusing me in front of everyone... He used foul language saying, 'You f****** b****, you have shown your class, f*** you, f*** you' which was demeaning to my reputation and character.\"\n\nShe alleged that he had then told her, \"Who the hell do you think you are? I am the owner of Wadia group and you are nobody.\"\n\nPreity claimed Wadia also threatened her saying he could \"make her disappear.\"\n\nWadia has publicly erupted at Preity and used abusive language in the past.\n\n\"He continued his bad behaviour, which I resisted, but finally the chief executive officer of the Indian Premier League intervened and told us to remain quiet,\" she stated in her complaint.\n\nHowever, in what may be a jolt to actor Preity Zinta in the case she has filed against businessman Ness Wadia, the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Indian Premier League Sundar Raman has denied that he was present at the IPL auction in Bangalore where Zinta and Wadia allegedly had an argument.\n\nThe 39-year-old actress filed the police complaint on Thursday night alleging that she was molested by Wadia (44) inside Wankhede stadium . On that day, an IPL match between Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings was played at the Wankhede stadium. During the match, when Preity was at the Garware Pavillion, Ness reportedly accosted her and also bad mouthed her in front of many people.\n\nShe gave a written complaint following which an FIR was registered against Wadia under IPC sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), police sources added.\n\nPreity Zinta hasn't alleged sexual molestation, her lawyer pointed out.\n\n\"I am shocked and dismayed. The allegations are totally false and baseless,\" Wadia told The Times of India.\n\nHighlights of the allegations\n\nPreity was at Wankhede stadium when Wadia allegedly pulled her hand and abused her in front of many people.\n\n1. In her complaint, Preity Zinta said that she was molested by Ness Wadia inside Wankhede stadium on May 30.\n\n2. Preity was at Wankhede stadium when Wadia allegedly pulled her hand and abused her in front of many people. She also claimed that after their break-up, Wadia used to often harass her.\n\n3. On May 30, an IPL match between Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings was played at the Wankhede stadium.\n\n4. The FIR was registered against Wadia under IPC sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman).\n\n5. Zinta gave an application to the police on Thursday, which was converted into an FIR on Friday. Her full statements could not be recorded as she had to take a flight out of the city. \"The actor claimed that she had to go out of the city and hence she could not approach the police earlier. As soon as she returned, she lodged a complaint,\" a police officer said.\n\n6. Preity Zinta and Ness Wadia had broken their five-year long relationship sometime back.\n\n7. Reacting to Preity's complaint, Ness Wadia said that he was \"shocked\" and \"dismayed\". \"The allegations are totally false and baseless,\" Wadia told TOI. \"It is disgusting that she would stoop to this level.\"\n\n8. Preity Zinta was \"upset as Wadia was seeing someone\", sources told TOI. Sources close to Zinta and Wadia said he started seeing someone two months ago and they got close when the IPL was being played in the UAE.\n\n9. \"Zinta could not digest the fact that her former boyfriend, who is still her business partner, was involved in another relationship,\" said sources close to the Wadia camp.\n\n10. Ness Wadia's mother had to undergo serious discomfort when attending a Kings XI Punjab match resulting in an argument between the two. Zinta has been trying to garner publicity out of whatever is left of her relationship with Wadia, sources said.\n\nE-mail A Mid-Day report says that the police also want [Zinta to give them a copy of] the e-mail that Preity had sent to Wadia warning him about his behavior. The police feel that could be important evidence. The report adds that the actress has said in her previous statement that she had already warned Wadia against his behaviour in that e-mail.\n\nOn 22 July 2014 timesofindia.indiatimes.com reported that Preity Zinta had alleged that her former boyfriend Ness Wadia had thrown burning cigarettes at her face. However, the website removed the story a few hours later.\n\nWhat witnesses to the incident said\n\nAn Indian Express report says that Danish Merchant, who is a builder by profession and a neighbour of the actress, has told police that she showed him bruises on her arm on May 31, a day after she was allegedly molested and abused by Ness Wadia.\n\nMr Merchant was seated at the Garware Pavilion where the incident occurred. He has told police that he saw Jean, an Australian national—whom Zinta had invited, intervene when Ness grabbed Preity's arm and heard Jean tell Ness to back off and stay away from her.\n\nJai Kanojia, who is a common friend of actor Preity Zinta and industrialist Ness Wadia, told the police that he saw Ness drag Zinta but was unable to hear any conversation between the two due to the commotion at the Garware Pavilion.\n\nThe fallout\n\nThe fallout of what Amul calls a ‘preity nessy affair’ and The Times of India ‘the Ness mess’ has been quite messy.\n\nUnderground don threatens Wadia\n\nSix days after Zinta filed her complaint, the Wadia group has filed a police complaint claiming they received threatening calls and a text message from an underworld don\n\nA police officer said when the caller wanted to speak to Nusli, he was told the industrialist was out of the country . He left a message: “We are all from underworld. Preity Zinta should not be harassed or else...“ The caller rang again, but the secretary disconnected. Soon, a text message came: “Give message to Wadia, don't f*** around with Preity Zinta or else I will f*** whole of your business. Don Ravi Pujari.“\n\nA secretary to industrialist Nusli Wadia received calls on his cell phone from a person, who claimed to be fugitive gangster Ravi Pujari (who is said to be living abroad), on Monday and filed a complaint with NM Joshi Marg police station\n\n“Preliminary inquiries suggest that the international call was made using VOIP (voice over internet protocol, a technology that allows calls to be made over internet) and the mobile number from which Wadia's secretary received the SMS was from Iran,“ said police commissioner Rakesh Maria.\n\nZinta wants to leave India?\n\nA report in The Telegraph stated that Preity Zinta is keen to sell her IPL stake and shift to Los Angeles, where she has bought a property and spends most of her time. the next day Zinta said that she won't settle in the US\n\n2018: Preit, Ness settle;HC quashes case\n\nShibu Thomas | Preity & Ness settle, HC quashes case | TNN The Times of India | 11 Oct 2018\n\nCriminal charges against industrialist Ness Wadia for outraging modesty and criminal intimidation were dropped on Wednesday after a settlement with actor Preity Zinta who had lodged the complaint in 2014.\n\nThe Bombay high court quashed the charge sheet and first information report lodged at Marine Drive police station after Preity said that she had no objection if the case was dropped. Preity and Ness appeared for an in-chamber hearing before a division bench of Justice Ranjit More and Justice Bharati Dangre. The terms or grounds of the settlement were not disclosed.\n\nPreity had lodged the complaint following an incident at Wankhede Stadium on May 30, 2014, during a T-20 match. Preity had alleged that Ness had abused her and outraged her modesty by grabbing her arm. Ness had denied the allegations.The marine Drive police had charged Ness under relevant sections of the IPC and if convicted, he faced a jail term of up to two years. In an affidavit filed before the court, Preity had said that she had received an apology from Ness and the dispute had been amicably settled with the intervention of elders in society. She had added that she had moved on in life.\n\nFollowing the court appearance, Preity posted on Twitter: “It feels good to move on. Put to rest and forgive. It’s amazing how one simple word can give closure. The windscreen is always larger than the rare view mirror.”\n\nThe low points of her life\n\nPreity Zinta: 5 low points of her life\n\nThe Times of India\n\nMolestation charges- Believe it or not but Preity Zinta has pressed molestation charges against her former boyfriend Ness Wadia. According to news reports floating in the media currently, Preity has lodged a written complaint against Wadia with the Marine Drive police station late on June 13, 2014. Preity has alleged that Ness touched her inappropriately in full public view and hurled abuses at her during the play-off between Punjab and Chennai in Mumbai on May 30, 2014. Earlier, TV channels quoted Wadia as denying the allegations against him as \"totally false and baseless\". The police may contemplate any action against Wadia only after questioning witnesses and examining video clips of the IPL match in Mumbai when the alleged incident of molestation took place. Preity's former love Ness Wadia has expressed shock and shown his disgust towards the entire incident.\n\nAccording to a Mumbai Mirror news report, the incident occurred in the Garware Pavilion at Wankhede stadium during the play-off between Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings on May 30. According to Preity's complaint, Ness, who was her business partner and a co-owner of Kings XI Punjab before a fallout between the two in 2009, turned aggressive when he tried to speak to her and was cold shouldered. \"Ness held me by my arm and tried to pull me towards him. When I resisted, he began abusing me,\" the actress has said in the complaint. Some of Preity's friends and team officials intervened, Ness abused them too. \"Even when he was dragged away, he kept screaming and threatening me,\" she has said. Preity and Ness were one of business-Bollywood's most-talked-about couples for nearly five years.\n\nFinancial problems- Before she pressed molestation charges against Ness Wadia, Preity Zinta was in the news for another reason. The actress is rumoured to be going through a financial crisis. While Preity has brushed those rumours aside, off and on news reports alleging Preity's monetary problems have been making headlines. Preity produced the debacle 'Ishkq In Paris' and reports of her alleged money problems have come to the forefront ever since. During interviews at that time, Preity confessed that Salman Khan offered to help her financially. The reports have resurfaced after Preity put her apartment where she had been living for many years up for rent. Preity's track record apparently has been fanning the gossip stories even more as writer-director Abbas Tyrewala who wrote 'Ishkq In Paris' slapped a case against the actress for non-payment of dues.\n\nPreity got entangled in another financial dispute and this time with late Shandar Amrohi and his family. According to reports, Preity had given Rs 2 crore to Shandar Amrohi to fight legal battles on assurance it would be returned. But before this could happen, Amrohi passed away. After his death, Preity reminded the Amrohi’s family regarding the refund of the outstanding amount but her requests fell on deaf ears. Following this, the actor has now moved to the Bombay High Court and filed a suit seeking to recover a principal amount of Rs 2 crore and Rs 80 lakh calculated at an annual rate of 18 percent from the day after Amrohi passed away (August 22, 2011). Though Preity is seeking recovery of the money from the Amrohi’s family, Shandar's brother Tajdaar has rubbished her claims, and stated that they will decide their next course of action when the time comes.\n\nDebacle of a comeback- Preity Zinta was more than a pretty face during the prime of her career but the actress' efforts of a comeback failed like no other. Preity made a comeback into films as the leading lady in the film she produced herself 'Ishkq in Paris'. The film bombed at the box-office and Preity's second innings in Bollywood shattered. Once a Yash Chopra heroine who starred in the director's most ambitious 'Veer-Zara', Preity Zinta today finds herself with no work than a few item numbers to her credit. While Preity spent a fortune producing 'Ishkq In Paris', she didn't get the expected returns and there are no more lucrative film offers for her.\n\nBreak-up with Ness Wadia- Preity Zinta and Ness Wadia's relationship was the talk of the town and the couple in their five years being together had the limelight on them. Till one day, when Preity Zinta walked out of the relationship and called it quits. Apparently, it is believed that Ness had a roving eye and the rich industrialist boy's match with a bubbly Bollywood star wasn't meant to last. It was common knowledge that Ness' mother Maureen Wadia disapproved of his match with Preity Zinta and even called her a zebra in an interview. Ness being a mama's boy, the relationship had to go kaput!\n\nThreatened by the underworld- Unlike most of her colleagues in the film industry who succumb to the pressure of the underworld, actor Preity Zinta stood out in that respect and headed straight to the courts after she was threatened by the underworld. It all started when Preity received threatening calls from the underworld while she was shooting for the film 'Chori Chori Chupke Chupke; in 2000. Zinta told the sessions court in Mumbai that she received a call from a man who said, \"Main bhai ka aadmi Razak bol raha hoon aur mujhe 50 lakh chahiye\". The producers of the film Bharat Shah and Nazim Rizvi had been charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA). While the brave Zinta girl was lauded for her guts, Preity surely had to go through a lot and can be easily termed as the biggest low of her life.\n\nPreity Zinta: the toughest decisions of her life\n\n5 bold decisions made by Preity Zinta\n\nThe Times of India\n\nWhen Preity testified against the underworld: Preity is known for her straightforward nature, honesty and for speaking her mind. However, all these were proved during the Bharat Shah Case when she decided to testify against the underworld. Bollywood superstars like Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan retracted from their statements but Preity was the only witness who didn't turn hostile to the prosecution. This quality of Preity was recognised by one and all and the actress became the first recipient of the Godfrey's Mind of Steel Award at the annual Red and White Bravery Awards.\n\nHer claim to fame film Kya Kehna : In 2000, when Preity made an entry into Bollywood, the actress stunned everyone by signing up a controversial film 'Kya Kehna'. The film directed by Kundan Shah was ahead of its time and dealt with teenage pregnancy and single parenthood. In the film, Preity played an unwed mother who decides to give birth to her child after her boyfriend abandons her. During her first release Dil Se with Shah Rukh Khan and Manisha Koirala, Preity surprised everyone by asking Shah Rukh's character about his virginity.\n\nWhen Preity called Suchitra Krishnamoorthi unstable: Preity Zinta, who has given hits like Kal Ho Na Ho, Veer Zaara, Koi Mill Gaya, Dil Chahta Hai to name a few has always found herself in the midst of all controversies, thanks to her views. She has been a part of a series of controversies and one such is when Suchitra Krishnamoorthi accused Preity Zinta of breaking her marriage. In 2007, actress Suchitra alleged Preity of being the main reason behind her break-up with her husband Shekhar Kapur. After keeping mum for some time on the issue, the actress said that Suchitra is unstable and she wishes her a speedy recovery. Zinta also issued a press release saying she had only met Shekhar for about five times in the last 10 years and asked him to clarify the issue.\n\nWhen Preity filed a defamation case: Another courageous decision of this strong lady came into the limelight when in 2005, Preity filed a defamation suit against a Mumbai tabloid for publishing the transcribe of a tape allegedly featuring the voice of another Bollywood superstar Salman Khan. In the tape the alleged voice of Salman Khan was heard talking in a disrespectful manner about her. Preity, who is very close to Salman Khan and shares an amazing camaraderie with him, took the strong decision against the tabloid who tried to defame her.\n\nContinued to own the IPl team and work with Ness Wadia even after break-up: The list of brave decisions made by Preity doesn't stop here. Preity is one of those actresses who has successfully made her mark in the field of entertainment and business. The actress bought the Kings XI IPL cricket team in 2008 when she was dating Ness Wadia. However, the former couple broke-up after a few years but still continued to own the team even post their break-up. Though, business was new to Preity as she belonged to Bollywood, the actress was seen walking tall with her former businessman boyfriend. Rather than just being an arm candy, Preity chose to be involved in all the decision making processes.\n\nMarriage with Gene Goodenough\n\nHiten J Trivedi et al/ The Times of India | Preity Zinta-Gene Goodenough's wedding: All you need to know TNN | September 01, 2016\n\nOn February 28, 2016 Preity Zinta tied the knot with beau Gene Goodenough in a private wedding ceremony in Los Angeles. The wedding was a low-key affair which saw only a select few guests in attendance. The only people present at her wedding were her besties Sussanne Khan and Surily Goel.\n\nPreity thereafter had a grand wedding reception in Mumbai and had the who's who of Bollywood gracing the event. However, her wedding pics never made it online. The bubbly actress had even stated that her wedding pics won't be out or leaked as she wanted to sell them for charity purpose. But an Instagram handle just got hold of all the pics and we are bringing it straight to you! The gorgeous bride is seen decked in a Manish Malhotra creation and her husband is seen complimenting her in a crisp white ensemble. They definitely look royal, don't they?\n\nAfter a house-full of movie A-listers showing up for her Mumbai wedding reception, actor Preity Zinta wanted to show new husband Gene Goodenough another slice of India. Posh India of course. Zinta and hub, and his parents, took off to a five star luxury spa in Rishikesh, Uttaranchal.\n\nFilmography\n\nAs an actress\n\n1998 Dil Se..\n\n1998 Premante Idera\n\n1998 Soldier\n\n1999 Dillagi\n\n1999 Raja Kumarudu\n\n1999 Sangharsh\n\n2000 Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega...\n\n2000 Kya Kehna\n\n2000 Mission Kashmir\n\n2001 Chori Chori Chupke Chupke\n\n2001 Dil Chahta Hai\n\n2001 Farz\n\n2001 Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke\n\n2002 Dil Hai Tumhaara\n\n2003 Armaan\n\n2003 Kal Ho Naa Ho\n\n2003 Koi...
