        "text": "New Delhi:\n\nPreity Zinta's Instagram timeline is one happy place. The actress often shares pictures and videos with her fans, taking them through her personal and professional milestones. Now, on Thursday, Preity has shared an image of herself with her friend of several years, interior designer and entrepreneur Sussanne Khan. In the image, the two beauties are seen smiling for the camera in black and white T-shirts. In the caption, Preity looked bad at their journey as friends and said, “There are friends in life and there are friends for life. Never a dull moment with you my darling, Sussanne Khan. Three decades and counting #friendsforever #friendslikefamily #ting.”\n\nThe geotag on the post points to Los Angeles, California where Priety lives with her husband and two kids. Sussanne Khan has been previously married to Hrithik Roshan, Preity's co-star of several films.\n\nSussanne Khan too shared an image with her interaction with Preity Zinta in California. Also in the image are actors Abhay Deol and Arslan Goni, Sussanne's boyfriend.\n\nSharing a selfie from the fun meetup, Sussanne Khan wrote, “Best nights are those you can't explain. (Heart emojis) friends more than family, tagging Preity Zinta, Arslan Goni and Abhay Deol.”\n\nMeanwhile, a few days ago, Preity Zinta celebrated 22 years of her hit film, Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega by sharing a video of the iconic song Piya Piya Ho Piya. In the caption, she mentioned the name of the film with heart emojis.\n\nA few weeks ago, Preity Zinta and her husband Gene Goodenough were also seen partying with Sussanne Khan, Arslan Goni, Hrithik Roshan, and Sonali Bendre.\n\nPreity Zinta has been married to Gene Goodenough since 2016. The couple has two children together, Jai and Gia."
