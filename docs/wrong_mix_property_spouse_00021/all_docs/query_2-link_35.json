        "text": "Ranjit Mahanti\n\nTHE Marine Drive police on Thursday recorded statement of Indian Premier League’s (IPL) Chief Operating Officer COO) Sundar Raman in connection with Preity Zinta and Ness Wadia episode. Raman’s statement was “affirmative” and may be go against the Ness Wadia.\n\nAddressing to media Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP Zone-1) Ravindra Shisve told media personals that Raman’s statement was recorded in BCCI’s office. Raman told that Zinta had verbally communicated to him about the spat with Ness Wadia on May 30.”\n\nAt least six witnesses’ statements, including a BCCI employee Ankit Baldi, have been recorded.\n\nZinta had alleged that Wadia had publicly humiliated her on several occasions, including once at an IPL auction where Raman was present. Preity also claimed in the police complaint that she had informed Raman about Ness’s unparliamentarily language and behaviour.\n\nNow, it is clear that the duo argued at three different places in the stadium. Once it was before the team staff, the other one in the ground and the third one near her seat.\n\nAccording to Shisve Preity Zinta and some more witnesses’ supplementary statement would be recorded in this week. After that Ness Wadia would be called for questioning.\n\nZinta, the 39-year-old actress had filed a police complaint on June 12 alleging that she was molested by Wadia (44) inside Wankhede stadium on May 30 when an IPL match was played between Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings.\n\nBased on Zinta’s written complaint, Marine Drive police registered an FIR against Wadia under IPC sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her\n\nmodesty), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman)."
