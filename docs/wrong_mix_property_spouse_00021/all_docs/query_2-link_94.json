        "text": "Actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha took to Twitter on Friday to express his views on the ongoing feud between Bollywood actress Preity Zinta and businessman and her former boyfriend Ness Wadia, saying it is their “internal matter” and they should be “left alone”.\n\nIn a series of posts, Sinha shared his views on the episode. “I know both of them; they seem to be nice people; I do not see any reason to speculate on possible angles in this unfortunate development,” he tweeted.\n\nOn June 12, the actress lodged a complaint of molestation against Wadia with the Marine Drive police station in Mumbai. Wadia, who co-owns the the Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kings XI Punjab with the actress, has denied the allegations, terming them “totally false and baseless”.\n\nAccording to sources, Zinta has accused Wadia of grabbing her hand and abusing her during a cricket match in Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on May 30.\n\n“It is their internal matter; they should be left alone. No matter how weak and defensive the Mumbai police may have become after 26/11, the investigations and the legal process will take its own course and truth shall prevail. We shall wait and watch. Meanwhile my best wishes to messy Ness and love to pretty Preity Zinta. God bless! @realpreityzinta,” he tweeted."
