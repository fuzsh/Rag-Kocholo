This is an exceptional moment for our dedicated staff, aspiring students, and for the dynamic city of Birmingham and the wider West Midlands region.\"\n\nZinta’s life story has captivated audiences worldwide – especially so in the Indian subcontinent, Asia and the Middle East. The winner of two Filmfare Awards, the actor has a string of blockbusters to her name. She has also made charitable contributions, both as a former UNAIDS ambassador and member of the UN Foundation’s Global Entrepreneurs Council.\n\nHer visit to the region coincided with the Birmingham Indian Film Festival, Europe’s largest platform for Indian and South Asian cinema as an off shoot of the London Indian Film Festival. It spotlighted the West Midlands as an option for filming locations for Bollywood movies, with upcoming feature films ‘Mom Tane Nai Samjay’ and ‘Coke’ shot in the region earlier this year. The region also has a growing screen sector, with new creative assets such as Digbeth Loc Studios set up by ‘Peaky Blinders’ creator Steven Knight. The venture is expected to boost the region’s creative economy already worth £4 billion.\n\nNeil Rami, Chief Executive of the West Midlands Growth Company (WMGC), said: “The West Midlands’ screen sector is thriving and on top of that we have one of the youngest, most diverse populations in Europe.\n\n\"We want to see more Indian films produced here to take advantage of our many beautiful filming locations – from the urban city centres of Wolverhampton and Birmingham to the Georgian splendour of Coventry and Leamington Spa – to nurture the talent we have and bring more investment into this sector across the region.\""
