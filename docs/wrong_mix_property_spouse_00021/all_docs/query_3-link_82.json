        "text": "Preity Zinta has been away from the big screen for many years now. Her last major film role was Jhoom Barabar Jhoom back in 2007. Since then, she has made numerous cameos in different movies, such as Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, Happy Ending, and Welcome to New York.\n\nMost recently, in 2018, Preity Zinta was seen in the movie Bhaiaji Superhit alongside Sunny Deol, Arshad Warsi, Ameesha Patel, and Shreyas Talpade. The movie, which was supposed to initially release in 2012, was delayed for a long time due to production issues. When it did release, it failed to leave a mark at the box office and was declared a flop.\n\nBut, why did Preity Zinta stay away from the big screen for so long despite starring in hit movies like Dil Chahta Hai, Kal Ho Naa Ho, Koi... Mil Gaya, and Veer-Zaara, all of which are considered modern day Bollywood classics? Well, the actor spoke about the reason behind her long hiatus in an interview with DD India.\n\nPreity Zinta said, “I didn't want to do a film. I was focusing on business. I wanted to focus on my personal life. People forget that for women, as actors, your craft is important, you want a body of work, but you have a biological clock. I've never dated anyone in the industry. I've never dated an actor. So the logical thing was I also needed to have my own family. It's great to play various lives, but you shouldn't forget to live your life. So I wanted to have children. Business was also exciting since it was something new. But mostly, I wanted to focus on my personal life. I really don't want to be an accomplished actor and a lonely person.”\n\nShe also spoke about how tough it is for female actors to maintain a work and life balance as compared to male actors.\n\nZinta said, “It's for every woman who works out there. Everybody tells you that I want equality, I want to work as hard as a man. But the world, they don't give you equality. You have a biological clock. Nature isn't equal to you, so you have to leave what you're doing and focus on that. My kids are two-and-a-half and I'm back at work. I'm loving work, but there's so much guilt everyday that I'm missing out. My daughter Gia and my son Jai look at me and say, ‘Mumma, please stay with us,’ and I start crying.”\n\nPreity Zinta will soon return to the big screen with Lahore 1947. A period drama, it’s being directed by Rajkumar Santoshi and also stars Sunny Deol. Lahore 1947 is produced by Aamir Khan."
