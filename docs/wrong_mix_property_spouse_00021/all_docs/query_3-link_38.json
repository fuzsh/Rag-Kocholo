        "text": "Bobby Deol is enjoying a wave of success with his latest movie, Animal, earning critical acclaim and capturing the hearts of his fans with his compelling performance. Amidst this success, there is growing buzz about a sequel to his 1998 hit movie, Soldier. Bobby Deol previously hinted at the possibility of a sequel, expressing his wish for producer Ramesh Taurani to bring it to life.\n\nRecently, Ramesh Taurani, who produced the spiritual sequel to Ishq Vishk titled Ishq Vishk Rebound, confirmed that plans for a Soldier sequel are indeed in motion. According to News18, Taurani stated that they are moving forward with the sequel and that filming is set to begin next year. While Ishq Vishk Rebound did not feature the original cast members Shahid Kapoor, Amrita Rao, or Shenaz Treasury, it remains uncertain whether Bobby Deol and Preity Zinta will return for Soldier 2. Taurani mentioned that casting decisions will depend on the story's development.\n\nReflecting on his career, Soldier stands out as one of Bobby Deol's most successful films. When asked about the sequel, Bobby acknowledged the long gap since the original movie.\n\nHowever, with a hopeful smile, he expressed his desire for Ramesh Taurani to consider making a part two, especially after the success of Animal.\n\nIn an old interview with Radio Nasha, Abbas of the Abbas-Mustan director duo recalled how Preity Zinta was cast in Soldier. Producer Taurani had arranged a meeting with Preity, who was initially set to work on a film by Shekhar Kapoor. However, since that project hadn't started, Abbas and Mustan met her at Tauraniâ€™s office. Despite the lack of auditions back then, Preity's lively and natural demeanor impressed them instantly, leading to her being cast in the movie."
