        "text": "Ness Wadia and Preity Zinta\n\nUnderworld don Ravi Pujari has confirmed that he had called the office of industrialist Nusli Wadia, asking not to mess with Preity Zinta as he was a very big fan of the actress and no one was standing up for her in the row with former boyfriend Ness Wadia.\n\nPujari told Headlines Today that he had called Wadia's office to speak with Ness but did not get any response even when he left a message. He claimed it was neither a threat call nor meant for extortion.\n\n\"I just left a message, but they did not respond. I gave a message in English... don't **** around with Preity Zinta or I will **** your business. I did not get a response after two to three calls, so a person like me will respond like this right?\" he said.\n\nThe underworld don, believed to have contacts with several celebrities, said he did not want to speak to Nusli Wadia but had asked for Ness and sought his mobile or landline number. The call was received by a secretary.\n\nAsked if he had sent a message to Nusli Wadia, Pujari said, \"No, not his father... he has a secretary. The lady was talking to me in English. I just talked to her. I called their office. She was some Shetty, I think... some South Indian... then I talked to her in English... so I asked... who am I talking to?\n\n\"She said some 'Shetty'... so I spoke to her in my style... direct... she asked who is this... I said, 'this Ravi Pujari'. I asked if she had heard my name... she started laughing... I said don't mess with Preity Zinta, take it easy. That's it. No extortion... if they take it as a threat, what can I do?\"\n\nPujari went on to claim that Nusli was a powerful man with political connections and that is why no one will talk against him. He said Zinta was scared and had been threatened.\n\nThe gangster said when he came to know about Zinta's problems, he called the Wadias, gave them his satellite number from Iran and asked them to resolve all problems."
