What happened to being gracious we wonder? Preity claims that Ness manhandled her and was rude with her while Ness rubbishes all the claims and refutes them, saying she is jealous.\n\nNow we know that Ness Wadia is happily in love with this new model-turned-actress who broke off her relationship with her long term boyfriend. Allegedly Preity, who has been trying to rekindle her relationship with Ness, just can’t digest the fact that he has moved on while she hasn't.\n\nAccording to this Mumbai Mirror report, what actually transpired between the two of them, which led to this case is as follows.\n\nOn May 30, which happens to be Ness’ birthday, he invited his mother and friends to his box to watch the match at Wankhede. When the party arrived, they found the seats were already taken by Preity’s associates. Now we all know about Maureen Wadia’s infamous comment about Zinta where she claimed that that she didn't care whether her son dated a Zinta or a zebra; so we can only imagine how miffed she was to see Zinta and gang in their seats.\n\nNess, apparently, went up to Preity and asked her to move her friends. When his request was declined, there was quite an exchange of words.\n\nIn the F.I.R, Preity states, “He came up to me at my seat and started screaming and abusing me in front of everyone... He used foul language saying, 'You f****** b****, you have shown your class, f*** you, f*** you,' which was demeaning to my reputation and character.\"\n\nOnly time will tell the truth though. Let sit in our best seats and watch the show, shall we?\n\nImage courtesy BCCL\n\nMore On >> Celebrities\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news."
