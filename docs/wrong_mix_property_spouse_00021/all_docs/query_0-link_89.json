An official reported that \"We filed the charge sheet in the court yesterday. Wadia who was present in the court was granted bail‚Äù.\n\nMeanwhile according to the law, a person who is not arrested in a crime has to take bail after the investigating agency files the charge sheet. In May 2014 Zinta, who is also co-owner of the Kings XI Punjab IPL cricket team, had currently filed a police complaint against Wadia, alleging that he had molested, abused and threatened her inside Wankhede stadium."
