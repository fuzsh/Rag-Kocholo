        "text": "Preity Zinta has joined Sunny Deol in the upcoming film, Lahore 1947. She took to Instagram on Tuesday to share some behind-the-scenes (BTS) photos from the sets. She will be making a comeback with the film, which is directed by Rajkumar Santoshi and produced by Aamir Khan.\n\nSharing the photos of the clapper board for the film, along with a snap with director Rajkumar Santoshi, Preity wrote in the caption, “On set for Lahore 1947. #newmovie #shoot #ting.”\n\nPreity was last seen in Bhaiaji Superhit in 2018 which also starred Deol. The two have worked together in the past in films like Hero: Love Story of a Spy (2003) and Farz (2001).\n\nLahore 1947 was announced in October last year and marks the first collaboration between Aamir Khan and Sunny Deol. Santoshi and Deol have previously collaborated in three box office successes, including Ghayal (1990), Damini (1993), and Ghatak (1996). It also marks the reunion of Aamir Khan and Santoshi after their iconic cult classic, Andaz Apna Apna (1994)."
