        "text": "Preity G Zinta is an Indian actress known for her work in Hindi films. She made her debut in 1998 with a supporting role in the drama Dil Se... Later that year, she starred in the commercially successful thriller Soldier.[1][2] For the films, she won a Filmfare Award in the Best Female Debut category.[1] In 1999, Zinta played the role of a CBI officer in the psychological thriller Sangharsh.[3] She followed this with the role of a teenage single mother in the Kundan Shah-directed drama Kya Kehna (2000),[1][3] a sleeper hit.[4][5] That same year, she starred in the romance Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega, and the crime drama Mission Kashmir, the third highest grossing Bollywood film of the year.[6][7]\n\nIn 2001, Zinta featured in the dramedy Dil Chahta Hai, which is cited in the media as a defining film of Hindi cinema.[8] Later that year, she portrayed a prostitute-turned-surrogate in the romantic drama Chori Chori Chupke Chupke.[9] Her only screen appearance of 2002 was in the box-office flop Dil Hai Tumhaara.[5][10] Zinta featured in four films in 2003. Her first role of the year was opposite Sunny Deol in Anil Sharma's drama The Hero—the most expensive Bollywood film to that point.[11] She played a negative role in the romantic drama Armaan, which saw her portray a rich, schizophrenic woman.[12] Following this, she starred in two blockbusters—the science fiction film Koi...
