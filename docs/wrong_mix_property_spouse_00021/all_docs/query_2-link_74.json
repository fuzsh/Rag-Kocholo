        "text": "The Mumbai Police earlier in the day told Zinta that they would like to record her statement at the Wankhede Stadium - the site of the incident.\n\nZinta, who was in the United States, returned to India on Sunday to join the investigation process in the case.\n\nOn arriving at the Mumbai airport, the actress reportedly avoided media.\n\nThe Mumbai Police had earlier tried to reach out to Zinta through various means, urging her to record her statement in the case filed by her against Ness. It finally wrote to the actress asking her to record the statement in a week's time, media reports said.\n\nMumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria said the police want Zinta to record a supplementary statement.\n\nZinta filed a case against Ness accusing him of outraging her modesty, which she claimed was done to protect herself rather than hurting anyone.\n\nDenying her allegations, Ness said he was \"shocked\" and termed them as \"false and baseless\".\n\nThe police has registered a case under Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nIn her statement to the police, the actress alleged that Ness outraged her modesty and abused as well as threatened her during the IPL qualifier for the final between Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede Stadium on May 30.\n\nShe reportedly said that during the match, while in the Garware Pavilion, Ness came up to her, grabbed her by the hand and started using abusive words in front of other spectators.\n\nThe actress dated the Bombay Dyeing heir from February 2005 until May 2009."
