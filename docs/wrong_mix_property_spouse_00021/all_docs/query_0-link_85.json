        "text": "Two personal secretaries to industrialist Nusli Wadia received calls on their cell phones from a person, who claimed to be fugitive gangster Ravi Pujari, on Monday and filed a complaint with N M Joshi Marg police station on Tuesday, Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria said on Wednesday.\n\n“Don’t run around Preity Zinta. Give my message to Wadia. Otherwise his business will be in trouble,” said a text message received by one the secretaries, the police said.\n\nMaria said, “On June 16, Nusli Wadia’s office and two personal secretaries received phone calls with threats. A total of five phone calls and a text message were received. Mumbai Crime Branch’s Anti-Extortion Cell is probing the matter.”\n\nMaria did not go into the content of the text message but added, “the phone number (of the caller) is supposed to be from Iran. The caller identified himself as Ravi Pujari and we are going to check with voice samples we have with us to ascertain the identity of the accused.”\n\n“The complainant did not record the caller’s voice,” he added.\n\nNusli Wadia’s elder son Ness is locked in a bitter feud with Zinta, his former girlfriend, who has accused him of abuse and molestation during an IPL cricket match on May 30 in full public view, a charge the Bombay Dyeing group scion has rejected as “false and baseless”."
