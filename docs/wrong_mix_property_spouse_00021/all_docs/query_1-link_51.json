We have been told by the court not to divulge anything more,\" Wadia's lawyer Aabad Ponda said later.\n\nZinta's lawyers also refused to give any details. On October 1, the court had suggested that Wadia and Zinta settle the issue amicably. Zinta's lawyer had said she was willing to settle the matter if Wadia was ready to apologise.\n\nAdvocate Ponda had then said that his client was ready to bury the hatchet, but he would not apologise.\n\nThe alleged incident had taken place at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on May 30, 2014 during an Indian Premier League (IPL) match.\n\nZinta and Wadia are co-owners of the IPL team Kings XI Punjab.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Wadia was abusing the team staff over ticket distribution when Zinta asked him to calm down as their team was winning.\n\nHe abused her too and molested her by grabbing her arm, Zinta alleged, as per the first information report (FIR) lodged on June 13, 2014 under IPC sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 504 (intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (using word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman).\n\nIn February this year, police filed a charge sheet against Wadia, following which he approached the high court seeking quashing of the case.\n\nIn his petition, Wadia claimed the case arose out of \"personal vengeance\" and the incident was merely a \"misunderstanding\".\n\nSection:\n\nDomain:\n\nOthers\n\nHome Title:\n\nHC quashes molestation case lodged by Preity Zinta against Ness Wadia\n\nNews Source:\n\nYes\n\n0.00\n\nNo\n\nFacebook Instant Article:\n\nYes\n\nMobile Title:\n\nHC quashes molestation case lodged by Preity Zinta against Ness Wadia\n\nHeading for Modify by Author:\n\nEdited By:\n\nShow 1st Tag on Story Page:\n\nYes\n\nPublish Later:\n\nNo\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nAkshara Singh and Amrapali Dubey's 'Piya Piya' video will remind you of Preity Zinta and Rani Mukerji - Watch\n\nMumbai: On-screen competitors Akshara Singh and Amrapali Dubey are very good friends off-screen.

I hear an idea, a thought and if it is good and I like it, I just jump for it. I don't go into the detailings of it. Right now, you need to do that but back then filmmaking was different. I never read scripts,\" Sunny told PTI.\n\n\"I just hear the idea from the director and go for it. I have always interacted with the story writer and heard the subject because that's what is going to eventually come over on screen,\" he adds.\n\nSince his debut in 1983 with \"Betaab\", Sunny has featured in some strong content driven films like \"Ghayal\", \"Damini\", \"Darr\" and \"Gaddar Ek Prem Katha\", among others.\n\nA process of not reading scripts can be considered risky but Sunny still goes by his instincts while giving nod to a film.\n\n\"One never takes it as gamble. I do it because I love it and I'm enjoying the story. Obviously sometimes in the journey you realise the production, the director, writer, or some things are going here and there but you don't disown it. You don't run away because it's everyone's baby,\" he says.\n\nThe actor is seen in \"Bhaiaji Superhit\", which also features Preity Zinta and Arshad Warsi.\n\nThe film is set in Sunny's familiar territory, action-comedy, but the actor says it does not mean he goes to the sets thinking it will be a cakewalk.\n\n\"I don't think I have ever worked with the attitude that 'This is easy I can do it.' Hats off to those who say and do it. For me, I need to enjoy it. You can't be nervous while performing a scene because then you wouldn't be able to,\" he says.\n\nThe 62-year-old actor, however, is aware that to stay relevant, he has to pick up roles which move according to times.\n\n\"I cannot be a teenager in films. You move accordingly and your experience makes you do certain subjects which you wouldn't have done when you were younger. As the time goes, you interact and become more aware of certain things.\n\n\"It'll be stupid if I still want to play a college boy. Besides that nobody would want to make it also. It's only when the filmmakers know that this actor can pull it off, is when they approach you,\" he adds.\n\nDirected by Neerraj Pathak and produced by Chirag Dhariwal, \"Bhaiaji Superhit\" releases on Friday.\n\nSection:\n\nDomain:\n\nOthers\n\nHome Title:\n\nI've never read a script in my career: Sunny Deol\n\nNews Source:\n\nYes\n\n0.00\n\nNo\n\nFacebook Instant Article:\n\nYes\n\nMobile Title:\n\nI've never read a script in my career: Sunny Deol\n\nHeading for Modify by Author:\n\nEdited By:\n\nShow 1st Tag on Story Page:\n\nYes\n\nPublish Later:\n\nNo\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDharmendra prays for success of Sunny Deol's film\n\nMumbai: Veteran actor Dharmendra says he does not know anything about film promotion and asked his actor-son to pray for the success of his latest release 'Bhaiaji Superhit'.\n\nDharmendra on Friday took to Twitter, where he shared a photograph of Sunny and tweeted, \" Sunny, my darling son, we don`t know the 'abc' of promotion, let us pray for the success of your new film 'Bhaiaji Superhit'.\"\n\nThe father-son duo has together worked in films like 'Yamla Pagla Deewana', 'Apne' and 'Sultanat'.

Nepotism does exist. But then there are stars like Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and others who are not from industry and are superstars,\" she told PTI in an interview.\n\n\"There will always be nepotism and you can't change that but one should never underestimate those who have a hunger to prove themselves in the industry.\n\nThe actor said growing up, she always wanted to be financially independent.\n\n\"My dad passed away when I was young. There was a strong desire within me to be financially independent. I was doing criminal psychology, I wanted to crack crimes. I am a great investigator, I can find out anything. I used that part of me in developing characters,\" she said.\n\nPreity, who stars in 'Bhaiyaji Superhit' opposite Sunny Deol, said she took a break to focus on her IPL team.\n\nLooking back, Preity said she had no knowledge about cinema when she entered Bollywood but knew that hard work wins over talent.\n\n\"I never thought I would become a big actor or star, I didn't even think it was possible. Then I was sure I would work till I am excited. After I did 'Veer Zaara' and 'Salaam Namaste', I reached a point where nobody let me experiment.\n\n\"I felt I should try something different. I went and met all the producers and directors with whom I had worked and said, \"Please don't offer me any films as I am getting into sports'. They thought I was crazy and part of me was. It was new and so I was excited and nervous. Also, it was my dream to be an entrepreneur,\" she said.\n\nPreity, 43, said the film's offer came to her at a time when she was feeling restless as her entrepreneurial journey was now on autopilot.\n\n\"..That's when Sunny Deol called me for this film. I am grateful that whenever I have wanted to do something different I have got an opportunity.\"\n\n\"I have much respect for Sunny. He is older to me. Shah Rukh and Salman are my buddies. I heard the script and I loved it and I laughed a lot during the narration.\"\n\nPreity said she was initially reluctant despite liking the character but her husband Gene Goodenough encouraged her to continue doing what she loves - acting.\n\nShe said she felt like a newcomer on the sets and for a moment she felt that she had 'forgotten how to act'.\n\n\"I was shaking so much. There was a very intense four page scene which I shot first. When I do an intense or emotional scene, I don't like any kind of distraction. I did the first scene and everyone started clapping. I went into my vanity van and had tears rolling out of my eyes.\"\n\nShe says, as an actor, she needs to feel excited, nervous and challenged to bring her best onscreen. \"I am the worst person when I am too confident, then I don't put efforts and feel I am amazing and I fall flat on my face.\"\n\nSection:\n\nDomain:\n\nOthers\n\nHome Title:\n\nNepotism will always exist in Bollywood: Preity Zinta\n\nNews Source:\n\nYes\n\n0.00\n\nNo\n\nFacebook Instant Article:\n\nYes\n\nMobile Title:\n\nNepotism will always exist in Bollywood: Preity Zinta\n\nHeading for Modify by Author:\n\nEdited By:\n\nShow 1st Tag on Story Page:\n\nYes\n\nPublish Later:\n\nNo\n\n↧\n\nBhaiaji Superhit movie review: An obsolete, tedious rom-com\n\nFilm: Bhaiaji Super Hit\n\nDirector: Neerraj Pathak\n\nCast: Sunny Deol, Preity Zinta, Arshad Warsi, Ameesha Patel, Jaideep Ahlawat, Brajesh Kala, Shreyas Talpade and Ranjeet\n\nRating: 2\n\nDirector Neerraj Pathak's 'Bhaiaji Superhit' is a romantic comedy with situations and emotions which seem anachronistic, including its setting and characters.\n\nBhaiaji aka 3D (Sunny Deol), a Mahadev bhakt, is a don in Benaras whom everyone fears, but he is actually a saviour of the poor and the needy. His wife Sapna Dubey (Preity Zinta) is of a suspicious nature and owing to some misunderstanding, she leaves him.\n\nHow Bhaiaji pines for her and in order to get her back, even agrees to produce a film to impress her and the complications that arise as a result, forms the crux of the story.\n\nThe characters are all trite and appear obsolete. The situations are predictable and the dialogues, replete with hackneyed humour and thus, a forced attempt at eliciting laughter. \"Pen nahin hai par pain hai,\" is a case in point.\n\nThe plot lacks originality and no attempt is made to inject freshness anywhere in the film. It appears outdated, oft-seen and cliched, from the word go. However, there are some exaggerated comic scenes and double entendres, which do make the audience chuckle, no matter how incredulous.\n\nSunny Deol as Bhaiaji is an extension of himself -- bashing people, blazing guns and breaking glass with aplomb, sans any expression on his face. His gawky dance steps along with his characteristic, insipid dialogue delivery, too are the same as always. There is nothing he does that you have not seen him do before.\n\nPreity Zinta as his zesty wife Sapna Dubey, is bubbly and energetic and performs convincingly, but her fake UP accent with an urban twang, is irksome.\n\nArshad Warsi as Goldie Kapoor, a successful Bollywood director, is his usual whacky self and it is his impeccable comic timing, along with some goofy lines, that make his character endearing.\n\nAmeesha Patel as a popular Bollywood actor, Malika Kapoor, is lacklustre, trying hard to exude oomph, but adds nothing to her character.\n\nShreyas Talpade as Porno Ghosh, a struggling writer, is the quintessential Bengali caricature in Hindi films, albeit, funny in parts.\n\nJaideep Ahlawat as Helicopter Mishra, another don, keen to usurp Bhaiaji`s positon and become the numero uno, is impressive and has a good screen presence too.\n\nThe rest of the ensemble cast, including Sanjay Mishra, Ranjeet, Brajesh Kala, Pankaj Tripathi, are capable and deliver what is expected of them, but are stereotypical, never rising above their cliched characters. Perhaps it is their poorly written characters that limit them too.\n\nBeing a Sunny Deol film, the action scenes are astutely handled. The music is mediocre, with \"Sleepy sleepy akhiyaan\" and \"Do naina\", decently picturised.Overall, \"Bhaiaji Superhit\" is a leave-your-brains-behind rom-com which entertains you in parts, but is mostly tiresome.\n\nSection:\n\nDomain:\n\nBollywood\n\nHome Title:\n\nBhaiaji Superhit movie review: An obsolete, tedious rom-com\n\nNews Source:\n\nYes\n\n2.00\n\nYes\n\nFacebook Instant Article:\n\nYes\n\nMobile Title:\n\nBhaiaji Superhit movie review: An obsolete, tedious rom-com\n\nHeading for Modify by Author:\n\nEdited By:\n\nShow 1st Tag on Story Page:\n\nYes\n\nPublish Later:\n\nNo\n\n↧\n\nSunny Deol-Preity Zinta starrer Bhaiaji Superhit Box Office collections out\n\nNew Delhi: Bollywood superstars Sunny Deol and Preity Zinta starrer 'Bhaiaji Superhitt' released last week and the film has got a lukewarm response at the Box Office.
