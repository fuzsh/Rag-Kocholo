She also worked in India as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS. She is also recognized for her forthright thoughts and frank statements. Moreover, she was the only witness in the 2003 Bharat Shah case who did not reverse her prior remarks.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter meeting a director at a party in 1996, Preity became immersed in the glamorous world. He gave her the chance to participate in a perk chocolate advertisement. Preity began her acting career with Hrithik Roshan in Shekhar Kapoor's Tara Rum Pum, but this film was cancelled due to some reason, and after this, she began filming Kya Kehna and Soldier. However, these two projects were also postponed, and she made her film debut with a very small role in the film Dil Se. She has appeared in films like Lakshya, Dil hai Tumhara, Dil Chahta Hai, Kal ho na ho, Veer Zara, etc. Preity Zinta has worked in various regional languages, including English, Punjabi, Telugu, and Hindi films.\n\nFilmography\n\nPreity Zinta is an Indian actress best known for her roles in Hindi movies. She made her acting debut in the drama film Dil Se in 1998, playing a supporting role. She starred in the financially successful thriller film Soldier later that year. She also received a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for the movie Dil Se and Soldier. Zinta starred as a CBI officer in the psychological thriller film Sangharsh in 1999. She then went on to play a teenage single mother role in the sleeper hit Kya Kehna (2000), directed by Kundan Shah. She also acted in the romantic comedy Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega and the criminal drama Mission Kashmir, which was the year's third highest-earning Bollywood film.\n\nZinta starred in the film Dil Chahta Hai in 2001, dubbed the \"defining film of Hindi cinema\" by the media. Later the same year, she starred in the love drama Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, where she played the role of a prostitute-turned-surrogate. In 2002, she only appeared in Dil Hai Tumhaara. In 2003, Zinta appeared in four films. Her first film of the year was Anil Sharma's drama film The Hero with Sunny Deol, which was the most costly Bollywood film at that time. She portrayed a wealthy, psychotic lady in the love drama Armaan, in which she played a bad role. Following that, she starred in two blockbusters: Koi... Mil Gaya, a science fiction film, and Kal Ho Naa Ho. She got the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the film Kal Ho Naa Ho later.\n\nZinta starred as a journalist in the 2004 war movie Lakshya, a box office flop. In 2004, she portrayed the role of the Zaara opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Yash Chopra's star-crossed romance Veer-Zaara. The film was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. She later starred in the romantic comedies Salaam Namaste and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, both of which did well outside of India. Despite her role as a radio DJ in Salaam Namaste, Zinta was viewed as an unhappy married lady in Salaam Namaste. After that, she appeared in the commercial flops Jaan-E-Mann (2006) and Jhoom Barabar Jhoom (2007). Zinta's first Canadian film was Heaven on Earth (2008).\n\nZinta hosted the reality show Guinness World Records - Ab India Todega in 2011 and the talk show Up Close Personal with PZ. In the same year, she founded her production business, PZNZ Media, and produced and acted in the 2013 love comedy film Ishkq In Paris, a box office flop.\n\nMarriage and Children\n\nPreity Zinta married her American lover Gene Goodenough in a private wedding in Los Angeles on February 29, 2016. Goodenough is the Senior Vice-President of Finance for NLine Energy, a hydroelectric power firm established in the United States. Following her marriage, Zinta relocated to Los Angeles and regularly visited India. Through surrogacy, she and her husband became parents to twins, a boy, and a girl, in 2021.\n\nNet worth\n\nPreity Zinta has a total net worth of 15 million dollars,about 110 crores in Indian currency. Her main source of income is brand sponsorships, for which she charges between Rs. 2 and 2.5 crores for every endorsement. She is also a television host and a film producer. Preity is also a co-owner of King's XI Punjab, an Indian Premier League franchise. She has also made significant investments in real estate property. Preity is among the top celebrities who pay the government's highest income tax because of her large earnings. Preity never falls behind in philanthropy and social causes.\n\nControversies\n\nPreity Zinta also has to face many controversies; let's see some important controversies.\n\n1. Ness Wadia Controversy\n\nNess Wadia, Preity Zinta's ex-boyfriend, has been charged with molestation. According to news sources presently circulating in public, Preity filed a written complaint against Wadia with the Marine Drive police station late on June 13, 2014. Preity claims that during the play-off between Punjab and Chennai in Mumbai on May 30, 2014, Ness groped her improperly in the full presence of the audience and screamed obscenities at her.\n\nWadia has previously denied the claims against him as \"completely untrue and unjustified,\" according to television reports. After interrogating witnesses and reviewing video footage from the IPL match in Mumbai, the police took action against Wadia.\n\nPreity and Ness were one of Bollywood's most talked-about couples for over five years. According to Preity, \"Ness grabbed my arm and pulled me closer to him. He began assaulting me when I protested. \"According to the actress's accusation. Preity's friends and team officials tried to intercede, but Ness also assaulted them. \"Even as he was being hauled away, he continued yelling and threatening me,\".\n\n2. Financial Disputes\n\nPreity Zinta was in the headlines for a different reason before filing molestation claims against Ness Wadia. It is said that the actress was having financial difficulties, while Preity had dismissed the rumours. Preity produced the flop 'Ishkq in Paris, and it is said that after producing this film, she was in big financial difficulties. 'Ishkq in Paris' writer-director Abbas Tyrewala had complained against her for non-payment of the amount due after this Preity listed her flat for rent, where she had lived for many years. Preity said in interviews that Salman Khan promised to help her financially.\n\nPreti was also embroiled in another financial dispute with the late Shandar Amrohi family. According to sources, Preity had handed Shandar Amrohi Rs 2 crore on the condition that it would be repaid. However, Amrohi died before this could happen. Preity informed the Amrohi family about the unpaid sum after his death, but her appeals fell on deaf ears.\n\nFollowing this, the actress filed a suit in the Bombay High Court, requesting the recovery of Rs 2 crore and Rs 80 lakh, calculated at an annual rate of 18 per cent from the date Amrohi died (August 22, 2011). Preity attempted to retrieve the funds from the Amrohi family, but Shandar's brother Tajdaar dismissed her accusations, stating that they would decide their next line of action when the time came.\n\n3. The debacle of Comeback\n\nAt her peak, Preity Zinta was a very successful actress, but her return attempt was a flop. Preity made a comeback in films as the leading role in 'Ishkq in Paris,' a film she produced herself. When this film underperformed at the box office, Preity's second innings in Bollywood were shattered. Preity Zinta, who had been a Yash Chopra heroine who starred in the filmmaker's most significant movie, 'Veer-Zara,' now has only a few item numbers to her credit. Preity spent a lot of money on 'Ishkq in Paris,' but it didn't make any profit with this movie, and she hasn't had any bigger film offers after this.\n\n4. Threatened by Underworld\n\nUnlike most of her colleagues in the film business, who cave to the mafia's pressure, Preity Zinta stood apart in this regard, going straight to the courts after being threatened by the underworld. It all started in 2000 when Preity got threatening phone calls from the underworld while filming 'Chori Chori Chupke Chupke' for demanding 50 lakh.\n\nZinta told about this to the sessions court in Mumbai. Bharat Shah and Nazim Rizvi, the film's producers, were accused under the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA). For this, the courageous Zinta was praised for her bravery, but Preity had to go through a lot.\n\nPhilanthropic Work\n\nShe worked as a philanthropist in addition to acting, modelling, and hosting. She works in India for women's issues, blood donation, and AIDS awareness. She performed in concert in 2005 to benefit the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake victims. In 2009, on her 34th birthday, she adopted 34 girls from Rishikesh's Mother Miracle orphanage, took their responsibilities, and pledged her whole devotion to their upbringing. She also represents a variety of social service groups as a spokesman.\n\nZinta performed in the \"HELP! Telethon Concert\" in 2005, with other Bollywood stars, to fundraise for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake survivors. Zinta visited a blood donation camp hosted by the Rotary Club of Delhi and the Godfrey Phillips Awards the next year as a representative of the Godfrey Phillips National Bravery Movement.\n\nShe also advocated blood donation and extended her support to the issue of women's empowerment. \"She stated,\" Donating blood does not result in death, but it does save someone's life... Donated blood becomes universal and may be utilized by anybody in need, regardless of group, caste, or geography. It is the glue that holds people together.\"\n\nIn 2007, she visited the army training facility in Hisar, Haryana, and also visited a unique school run by the army for disabled youngsters. Zinta painted for the non-governmental organization Khushi in 2007 alongside Mumbai-based artist Gurcharan Singh for the cause of street children. In December, she joined the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) efforts to combat human trafficking in India. She advocated for more public knowledge of the practice, protection and rehabilitation for individuals who have been rescued from it, and punishment for perpetrators."
