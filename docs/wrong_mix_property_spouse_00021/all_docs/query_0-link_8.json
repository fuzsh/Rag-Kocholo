Ms Zinta has agreed to return from a foreign trip to record her testimony for the police this week, said Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria.\n\nMs Zinta and Mr Wadia, scion of the Wadia group, an Indian conglomerate with interests including in real estate, textiles and a low-budget airline, called off their five-year relationship in 2009.\n\nPromoted\n\nListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nIn a statement last week, Mr Wadia called the allegations \"totally false and baseless\".\n\n."
