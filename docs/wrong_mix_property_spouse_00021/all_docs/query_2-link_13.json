        "text": "It seems Bollywood actor and IPL team owner Preity Zinta has moved on in life after her break-up with businessman Ness Wadia. In an interview to Mumbai Mirror, she's admitted to being in a new relationship\n\nYes, Preity has found the love of her life.\n\nThe dimpled beauty in an interview mentioned that there is something going on and we will get to know about in soon.\n\nPreity later confessed that she is in a relationship, however, did not reveal his name.\n\nShe said, \"Yes, I'm in a relationship with someone nice. Finally, I have time for myself...\"\n\nLast year the actress had filed an assault case against her ex-boyfriend Ness Wadia. The duo shares the ownership of IPL team Kings XI Punjab.\n\nOn being asked whether it is difficult to work with Ness Wadia after that traumatic episode, she says, \"I know when to move on.\"\n\nAt another point in her interview she says, \"I've reached closure with Ness. My glass is always full, never half empty and will remain that way.\"\n\nLately, Preity's been making frequent trips to Los Angeles where her rumoured friend is said to be based.\n\nPreity Zinta has been synonymous with Kings XI Punjab.\n\nThe Indian Premier League team has had the best Australian and Indian players in their ranks, but the Bollywood actress has been the team's most visible face ever since IPL was launched in 2008.\n\nThe eighth edition of IPL could well be Preity's last, in a recent interview she said, \"IPL doesn't need me anymore.\"\n\nAs Kings XI Punjab's co-owner Preity has made policy decisions for the team, was seen at player auctions and has been the team's leading cheerleader throughout.\n\nThe other co-owners, including her former boyfriend Ness Wadia, have very much lived in Preity's shadows.\n\nPreity's bubbly demeanour and dimpled smile will be missed at IPL matches for sure."
