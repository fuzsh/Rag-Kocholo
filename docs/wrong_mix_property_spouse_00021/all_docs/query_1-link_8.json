        "text": "Preity Zinta gave her consent to dismiss the case against her former boyfriend and entrepreneur Ness Wadia, after he apologised to her as well as submitted an affidavit to that effect. The two were appearing together in the Bombay High Court in the chamber of Justice Ranjit More. The court has now quashed the case against Ness.\n\nOn June 13, 2014, Preity filed a complaint against her ex-boyfriend and co-owner of the Kings XI Punjab IPL (Indian Premier League) team alleging that he molested, abused and threatened her during an IPL match.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Mumbai Police filed a charge sheet in the case in February this year, four years after the incident took place. The charge sheet was filed under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nAccording to Preity's complaint, the incident took place on May 30, 2014, during a Kings XI Punjab vs Chennai Super Kings match. Ness was allegedly abusing the team staff over ticket distribution when Preity was seated in the Garware Pavilion. When she asked him to calm down, he abused and manhandled her by grabbing her arm, she claimed.\n\nEven though she changed her seat, Ness continued to verbally abuse her. He also allegedly abused her on the ground in front of their team members.\n\nPreity had alleged that he \"intimidated me by saying that he could make me disappear as I was a nobody and only an actress and he's a powerful person\". Ness had vehemently denied the allegations, calling them \"totally false and baseless.\"\n\nALSO READ: What is the Preity Zinta and Ness Wadia molestation mess all about?\n\nALSO READ: Preity Zinta reveals she almost died in 2004 tsunami"
