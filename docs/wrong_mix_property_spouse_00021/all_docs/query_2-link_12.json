        "text": "Mumbai: Bollywood actor Preity Zinta, who has accused her ex-boyfriend and business partner Ness Wadia of manhandling, abusing and threatening her, is likely to record her statement in front of the Mumbai police at her home in Bandra today.\n\nMs Zinta, 39, had filed a police complaint on June 12 accusing Mr Wadia, 44, of abusing her after the pair got into an argument while watching their team, Kings XI Punjab play the Chennai Super Kings on May 30.\n\nIn her complaint, Ms Zinta has claimed, \"I left for my seat, but he (Ness) came up to me at my seat and started screaming and abusing me in front of everyone.\"\n\nIn a statement last week, Mr Wadia called the allegations \"totally false and baseless\".\n\nMr Wadia has alleged in a police complaint that his company received threatening calls and texts from an underworld gangster referencing the Bollywood star.\n\nThe caller identified himself as fugitive underworld don Ravi Pujari, the police said. A threatening message allegedly warned the Wadias against troubling Ms Zinta.\n\nPolice has provided Mr Wadia with security after his complaint.\n\nMs Zinta and Mr Wadia ended their five-year-old relationship in 2009 but have continued to work together since then."
