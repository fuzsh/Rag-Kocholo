        "text": "Police probing the threat calls received by the secretary of Ness Wadia's father, allegedly from gangster Ravi Pujari, may meet the Bollywood actress Preity Zinta as well\n\nWhile Marine Drive police has been eagerly waiting for the return of Bollywood actress Preity Zinta, to record her supplementary statement, Mumbai Crime branch and Anti Extortion Cell are also not far behind.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso read: Is B-town playing it safe in Preity Zinta-Ness Wadia spat?\n\n39-year-old Preity Zinta arrived at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport on Sunday afternoon. Pic/PTI\n\nSources from the crime branch revealed that the investigation of the case of threat calls, which were made to the Wadia office, might also require them to meet the actress.\n\nOfficials are currently investigating the case from all angles and trying to find out how gangster Ravi Pujari managed to get the telephone numbers to Wadia’s office. Pujari had called Wadia’s office about ten times on the personal numbers of people associated with the group.\n\nAlso Read: Preity-Ness case: Cops probe mafia threats to Wadia clan\n\n“We suspect it to be an inside job, a person who may have passed the numbers to Pujari, who may be doing it for publicity. For a fair investigation, we will record statements of all people associated with the case,” said an officer from Crime Branch."
