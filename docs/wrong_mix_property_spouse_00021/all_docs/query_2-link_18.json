        "text": "Synopsis\n\nEarlier this month, the court had asked the couple to 'finish off' the case.\n\nThe Bombay High Court cancelled the molestation case today which was filed by actress Preity Zinta against industrialist Ness Wadia. The court had earlier asked the actress to finish off the 2014 case lodged against him by the actress for allegedly outraging her modesty.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nBudget Highlights: Your 2-minute guide\n\nFM 's plan for Viksit Bharat: A look at key numbers\n\nWhat's in Sitharaman's Budget for you?\n\nThe reports suggested that Zinta's advocate told the court that the actor is willing to settle the matter if Wadia is ready to apologise. The lawyer said they were not insisting on a written apology.\n\nHowever, Wadia's counsel Abad Ponda, however, said the industrialist was not ready to apologise.\n\n\"We want to bury the hatchet, but my client(Wadia) is not ready to apologise. The complainant (Zinta) wants to extract an apology and get media attention,\" he told HC.\n\nThe bench then suggested the parties settle the matter.\n\n\"Just finish it off now,\" Justice Ranjit More, shared by Justice Bharti Dangre, said while directing both Wadia and Zinta to appear before the court on October 9.\n\nHe said the matter would be heard in chamber on the next date.\n\nPreity Zinta and Ness Wadia\n\nThe alleged incident had taken place at the Wankhede Stadium on May 30, 2014 during an Indian Premier League (IPL) match. Zinta and Wadia are co-owners of the Kings XI Punjab IPL team.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Wadia was allegedly abusing the team staff over ticket distribution when Zinta asked him to calm down as their team was winning.\n\nHe, however, abused and molested her by grabbing her arm, the actor had alleged.\n\nZinta had lodged an FIR against Wadia on June 13, 2014 under IPC sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 504 (intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (using word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman).\n\nIn February this year, police had filed a charge sheet in the case against Wadia.\n\nLater, the industrialist approached the high court seeking to quash the case.\n\nIn his petition, Wadia claimed the case arose out of \"personal vengeance\" and that the incident was merely a \"misunderstanding\".\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nWhat's cheaper and what's costlier?
