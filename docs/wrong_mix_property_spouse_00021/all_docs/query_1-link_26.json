        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe witness, recently recorded her statement in the Wadia-Zinta episode involving charges of assault and molestation levelled by the actress.\n\nMUMBAI: A witness listed by industrialist Ness Wadia has told police she saw him having a conversation with Bollywood actor Preity Zinta during an IPL match here on May 30 but did not see him grabbing arm or pulling her as alleged by the film star.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nBudget Highlights: Your 2-minute guide\n\nTax tweaks, jobs & more: All that FM announced in Budget\n\nFM 's plan for Viksit Bharat: A look at key numbers\n\nThe witness, Farah Oomerbhoy, recently recorded her statement in the Wadia-Zinta episode involving charges of assault and molestation levelled by the actress.\n\nOomerbhoy, who was watching the match from Garware Pavilion, said there was no heated argument between the two and she did not see him (Wadia) pulling Zinta by her arm on the day of alleged incident.\n\n\"Around 30 minutes into the match, Ness went to Preity and leaned over to have a conversation with her after which he just walked away. I couldn't hear them due to noise (in the stadium). But he was leaning over her seat as if to speak to her softly. I didn't see anything that made me to feel that Ness was speaking to her loudly. I didn't see any argument happening between the two,\" Oomerbhoy said.\n\n\"At half time, I, my husband and son went to the air- conditioned box, where Ness was standing with his family members and friends. I was standing with Ness' mother and his sister-in-law. All seemed fine between them (Preity and Ness),\" the witness said.\n\nPooja Dadlani, another witness listed by the businessman, in her statement, told the police, \"I did not hear anything or see anything that indicated there was an argument between Ness and Preity.\"\n\nIn her police complaint in June, Zinta had accused her former boyfriend of molesting, abusing and threatening her during an IPL match between Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings on May 30 at Wankhede Stadium in South Mumbai.\n\nWadia has dismissed the actor's charges. Despite their break-up, Wadia and Zinta continue to co-own Kings XI Punjab.\n\nAmong those whose statements had been recorded are IPL Chief Operating Officer Sundar Raman, BCCI Secretary Sanjay Patel and COO of Kings XI Punjab Fraser Castellino.\n\nWitnesses Danish Merchant, Jai Kanojia and Parul Khanna have told the police Wadia had \"pulled\" Zinta by hand during a \"heated\" argument, while Castellino said he did not see any fight or argument between the two.\n\nNess had listed nine witnesses and requested the police to record their statements. They are: Serieka Lal, Loretta Joseph, Dadlani, Anneline Adams, Oomerbhoy, Sweetie Burman, Kamlesh Shah, Rayaan Mustapha and Sharat Nath.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nWhat's cheaper and what's costlier?
