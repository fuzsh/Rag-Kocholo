        "text": "Suchitra Pillai, known for her role in Dil Chahta Hai, recently revealed an intriguing connection to Preity Zinta. During an interview, Suchitra shared that her husband, Lars Kjeldsen, once dated Preity Zinta. However, she was quick to clarify that she did not come between them, addressing rumours and misconceptions about her involvement.\n\nSuchitra Pillai opens up about Preity Zinta’s past relationship with her husband Lars Kjeldsen: “Preity and I were never friends”\n\nIn a conversation with The Indian Express, Suchitra disclosed, “No, that’s another story from somebody else. Preity and I were never friends; we were acquaintances because we had a common friend. But yes, Lars Kjeldsen did date Preity Zinta for some time but that was the breakup he had before he met me.” She emphasized that their relationship ended before she entered the picture.\n\nReflecting on the label of 'boyfriend snatcher,' Suchitra recounted, “The big news that happened, which was a big misunderstanding, was not because of me. It happened at the time I came back from England. I was called a ‘boyfriend snatcher’ on the cover of several magazines. The headline read, ‘Suchitra Pillai is a boyfriend snatcher.’ This was because I started dating Andrew Coyne, who had started Star Television in India. This was the relationship in question, but it was not because of me that Andrew and his partner, model Achala Sachdev, fell apart. It is water under the bridge after many years, and Achala and I have a laugh about it.”\n\nSuchitra and Lars married in 2005 and have a daughter, Annika Kjeldsen. Preity Zinta, meanwhile, married Gene Goodenough in 2016 and welcomed twins Gia and Jai via surrogacy in 2021. Preity is currently in India filming Lahore 1947 with Sunny Deol, marking her return to the big screen after several years. The film, directed by Rajkumar Santoshi and produced by Aamir Khan, promises to be a significant project, featuring a stellar cast and crew including Shabana Azmi, AR Rahman, and Javed Akhtar.\n\nAlso Read: Preity Zinta calls out paparazzi for intrusive photography in Mumbai: “You all are scaring me”\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES"
