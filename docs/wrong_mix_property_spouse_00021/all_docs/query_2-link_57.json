        "meta_description": "Witnesses ‘affirmed’ incident occurred       MUMBAI: Indian Premier League COO Sundar Raman on Thursday corroborated actress Preity Zinta’s claim that she had informed him about her May 30 spat with former boyfriend and industrialist Ness Wadia at the Wankhede Stadium, police said. The 39-year-old actress had filed a complaint on June 12 alleging she was molested by Wadia (44) at Wankhede stadium on May 30 when an IPL match was played between Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings. Wadia has termed the accusations as “false and baseless”. “Sundar Raman’s statement was recorded in BCCI’s office in connection with Preity Zinta case. The statement was affirmative. There was a mention by Raman in the statement that Zinta had verbally communicated to him about the spat with Ness Wadia on May 30,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police Ravindra Shisve. The IPL Chief Operating Officer’s statement was recorded over anhour- and-half, Shisve said, adding statements of six witnesses have been recorded so far, including that of a BCCI employee Ankit Baldi. The witnesses were “affirmative” about the “incident having taken place”, the officer said without clarifying whether they were eyewitnesses to the happenings or divulging details of their statements. The officer said CCTV footage examined by police so far had not given any “substantial leads” as to what exactly happened between the two. “We are seeking more CCTV footage from BCCI,” Shisve added. Meanwhile, the actress denied she would sell her stake in Kings XI Punjab team. Zinta tweeted that she was neither going to sell her stake in the team, nor was she planning to settle in America. NEW WITNESS? Sachin Tendulkar's minor son Arjun Tendulkar may have his statement recorded by Mumbai Police in connection with actress Preity Zinta's harassment complaint against Wadia Group scion Ness Wadia, unconfirmed reports are saying. Arjun Tendulkar was apparently present at the Wankhede Stadium when the incident took place, and some reports are saying that Wadia may have abused him too.",
