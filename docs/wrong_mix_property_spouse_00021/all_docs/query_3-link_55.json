        "text": "THE IPL is underway and Preity Zinta is hoping Kings XI Punjab can win their first ever title.\n\nThe Bollywood star was the first female owner of a cricket franchise in the league, when she helped the Mohali-based franchise launch in 2008.\n\nWho is Preity Zinta?\n\nPreity Zinta was born in Rohru in Shimla district, Himachal Pradesh, in 1975.\n\nShe was forced to mature rapidly at the age of 13 after her father, who was an officer in the Indian Army, died tragically in a car crash.\n\nZinta says she was a tomboy as a child, inspired by her dad's military background.\n\nShe debuted in 1997 in Mani Ratnam film Dil Se...\n\nIn 2003, she was the female lead in India's three highest grossing films - The Hero: Love Story of a Spy, Koi... Mil Gaya and Kal Ho Naa Ho.\n\nLinking up with Ness Wadia, Mohit Burman and others in a consortium, she acquired the rights to the IPL's Mohali franchise for £53m and chose to name the team Kings XI Punjab.\n\nZinta said: \"My involvement with the team is total. I am extremely passionate about our team and I do believe that I am the team's good luck factor, so I want to be there for everything.\"\n\nWhat is Preity Zinta's net worth?\n\nAs of 2014, Preity Zinta's net worth was £21m, making her the least wealthy of all the IPL owners.\n\nBut it is believed to have increased significantly since that figure was released by Wealth-X.\n\nDoes Preity Zinta have a husband?\n\nZinta got married in 2016 to her longtime American partner Gene Goodenough, Senior Vice-President for Finance at NLine Energy.\n\nBefore that, she dated Ness Wadia between 2005 and 2009."
