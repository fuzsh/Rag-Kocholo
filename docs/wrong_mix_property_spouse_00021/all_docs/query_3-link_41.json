        "text": "Rajkumar Santoshi reunites with Sunny Deol after 28 years for Lahore 1947, produced by Aamir Khan and that stars Preity Zinta as the female lead.\n\nWhen asked about the collaboration for the film, the director shared, “Lahore 1947 is a very special film, emotionally attached and very important project in my career.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added, “Also, it’s a reunion with the most talented people. I worked with Aamir in Andaz Apna Apna and this time he is collaborating as a producer. On the other hand, with Sunny Deol, we made the most loved films like Ghayal, Damini, and Ghatak. For a film of this magnitude, I can’t think of anyone else than A.R. Rahman as a music composer, he is one of the top composers in the world right now. Javed Akhtar and I share a very good bond with each other for many years, having him for this project as a lyricist is a delight. This is truly the best dream team and rare to come together. With all the positivity and full of energy, we will commence the shoot for the film very soon.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from this, Aamir Khan will also be working on the Bollywood adaptation of the Spanish film Champions. While he was expected to be a part of the drama as an actor, Aamir Khan later announced that he would only be producing the flick. Now, it is also being reported that Farhan Akhtar has been roped in to front the upcoming sports drama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the box office debacle of Aamir KhanâsÂ Laal Singh Chadha , Mr Perfectionist decided to take some time off work to be with his family. He revealed, âI feel I have been working for 35 years and I have single mindedly been focused on my work. I feel this is not fair to people who are close to me. It is not fair to me also in many ways.â\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Will Be Aamir Khanâs Forthcoming Project?\n\nUp next, Aamir Khan has not announced his next as an actor. However, trade analyst Taran Adarsh revealed via a Twitter post that Mr Perfectionist has locked Christmas 2024 as the release date for his next. This means that Aamir Khanâs next will be locking horns with Akshay Kumar starrerÂ Welcome To The JungleÂ at the box office. The third installment in the Welcome series enjoys an ensemble cast."
