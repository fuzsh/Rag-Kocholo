        "text": "One of the most gorgeous, exceptionally talented, highly educated, and successful actresses in the history of Hindi cinema, Preity Zinta is right up there with the best actors of Indian cinema. The actress had ruled the big screen at a time when the industry was filled with so many brilliant actresses like Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Bipasha Basu, and many more.\n\nNot only this, but at the peak of her acting career, she was charging a whopping sum of Rs. 2 to Rs. 2.5 crores for one movie, and her yearly income was around Rs. 12 crores. The actress has won numerous awards, as she had given so many memorable performances in her acting career that she deserves no introduction.\n\nRecommended Read: Women In Rajinikanth's Life: From An Alleged Affair With Silk Smitha To Marrying Latha Rangachari\n\nPreity Zinta's father was in Indian Army, and he passed away when she was just 13\n\nWhile everyone is aware of Preity Zinta’s illustrious acting career in Bollywood, not everyone knows that there’s a painful story about her childhood that transformed her into the kind of person she is today. For the unversed, Preity Zinta was born on January 31, 1975, to Durganand Zinta and Nilprabha Zinta.\n\nPreity Zinta's father, Durganand Zinta was in Indian Army, and one day, when he was travelling with his wife, Nilprabha Zinta, their car met with a severe accident. Unfortunately, the Indian Army officer died on the spot. However, luckily, by God’s grace, Preity’s mother escaped the accident with some major injuries. After her father's demise, a 13-year-old Preity became the head of the family as she started taking care of the house and guided her two brothers, Deepankar Zinta and Manish Zinta, in their respective careers.\n\nPreity Zinta's debut film and best movies\n\nThe ever-so-gorgeous actress, Preity Zinta made her acting debut in Bollywood with the film, Dil Se, in which she was paired alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Manisha Koirala. As per the reports, it was Shekhar Kapur, who recommended Preity’s name to Dil Se’s director, Mani Ratnam. Despite playing a supporting role in her debut film, the bubbly actress managed to grab the viewers’ attention.\n\nAfter which, she went on to feature in tons of successful films in her career. However, some of the best films of Preity Zinta’s career are the likes of Kal Ho Naa Ho, Veer Zaara, Lakshya, Salaam Namaste, Sangharsh, Koi… Mil Gaya, Kya Kehna, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, The Last Lear, and Soldier.\n\nPreity Zinta's infamous controversies\n\nThere is no doubt that Preity Zinta is one of the few celebrities in Bollywood, who rarely has any haters out there, as almost everyone is in love with the actress and her cute dimples. From her illustrious career to the kind of person she is in real life, millions of people admire Preity even to this very day. However, just like everyone else, she also had some dark patches in her life. Thus, today, we are going to talk about the five infamous controversies of Preity Zinta’s life and career that shocked the industry back then. So without further ado, let’s get straight into it!\n\n#1. When Magistrate Court issued a non-bailable warrant against Preity Zinta\n\nIn 2013, Preity Zinta donned the hat of a producer for the first time in her life with the film, Ishkq in Paris. The film featured the actress herself alongside Gaurav Chanana, Isabelle Adjani, Shekhar Kapoor, Chunky Panday, Salman Khan and more. However, the film turned out to be a disaster at the box office. It was a heartbreaking moment for Preity, both mentally and financially, as it was her first time as a producer.\n\nHowever, the film’s dialogue writer, Abbas Tyrewala filed a case against Preity Zinta in the court after his payment cheque of Rs. 18.9 lakhs bounced. Soon after his complaint in court, a non-bailable warrant was issued against the actress after she failed to appear in the court.\n\n#2. When Preity Zinta got furious after Tusshar Kapoor took her name for 'cosmetic surgery' on Koffee With Karan\n\nIn 2011, Tusshar Kapoor appeared in one of the episodes of Karan Johar’s celebrity talk show, Koffee With Karan. During the rapid-fire segment of the show, the actor was asked to tell the first name that comes to his mind when he hears ‘cosmetic surgery’. In a quick response to the question, Tusshar had taken Preity Zinta’s name, and it landed him in trouble.\n\nEven before the episode got aired on television, Preity Zinta called and reportedly slammed the actor for taking her name and speculating that she had undergone a cosmetic surgery. However, Tusshar had later taken his words back and admitted publicly in an interview that it was all for fun, but Preity had taken it quite seriously and got hurt.\n\n#3. When Preity Zinta filed a molestation charge against Ness Wadia\n\nIn 2014, Preity Zinta had filed molestation charges against her then-boyfriend, Ness Wadia. It was a shocking news for the entire nation, as the reports were rife that the couple, who had started dating back in 2007, would tie the knot soon. However, to everyone’s surprise, things got extremely ugly between them.\n\nFor the unversed, after a long gap of four years, a chargesheet was filed against Ness Wadia in February 2018. However, it was in October 2018 when the Bombay High Court told Preity and Ness to consider ‘finishing off’ their differences. Thus, after almost four years, Preity agreed to shut the case after Ness promised to issue an apology.\n\nDon't Miss: Bipasha Basu's Controversies: Kissing Cristiano Ronaldo, Alleged Sex Talk With Amar Singh, More\n\n#4. When Shekhar Kapur's second wife, Suchitra blamed Preity Zinta for their divorce\n\nThe critically-acclaimed filmmaker, Shekhar Kapur and his second wife, Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, got married back in 1999. The couple welcomed a baby girl in their lives whom they had lovingly named Kaveri Kapur. But unfortunately, the couple got divorced back in 2006 after Shekhar Kapur’s alleged affair with Preity Zinta.\n\nFor the unversed, Preity Zinta had given the first audition of her life to Shekhar Kapur, and he was the one, who recommended her name to Mani Ratnam for her debut film, Dil Se, which clearly speaks volumes about their friendship. However, as per Shekhar’s second wife, Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, they were more than just good friends; and their affair disturbed her married life with Shekhar. However, Preity denied the allegations and added that Suchitra wasn’t mentally well.\n\n#5. When Salman Khan allegedly admitted that he slept with Preity Zinta while dating Aishwarya Rai\n\nDuring the filming of Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, rumours were rife that Preity Zinta and Salman Khan were getting close to each other. However, the rumours didn’t turn a lot of heads, as everyone was aware of Salman's serious relationship with Aishwarya Rai. However, in 2001, an audio tape was leaked which was rumoured to be about a conversation between Aishwarya and Salman. In the 4-hour-long rumoured audio tape, Salman was allegedly heard confessing that he had slept with Preity Zinta during the making of their film, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke.\n\nThe audio tape shocked the entire film industry. However, with the lack of evidence and proof, soon, the matter was closed. But to everyone’s surprise, it was in 2001 only when Aishwarya Rai and Salman Khan parted ways, after which people started speculating that it was his closeness with Preity Zinta that resulted in his breakup with Aishwarya. However, even to this very day, the leaked audio tape is a mystery for everyone!\n\nYou May Like This: MM Keeravani: Golden Globe Awards, Avoiding Premature Death, Leaving Pregnant Wife Alone, And More\n\nPreity Zinta's husband, Gene Goodenough and their twin babies, Jai and Gia\n\nIt was on February 29, 2016, when the ever-so-gorgeous actress, Preity Zinta got married to the love of her life, Gene Goodenough, breaking millions of hearts.
