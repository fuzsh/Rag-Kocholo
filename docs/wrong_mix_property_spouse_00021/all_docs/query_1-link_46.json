        "text": "All hell broke loose when it was recently reported that actress and entrepreneur Preity Zinta, who was headed to Mohali for Kings XI Punjab’s match, was told she couldn’t board the GoAir flight owned by her former boyfriend, Ness Wadia. Now, the airlines have come to the forefront and issued a statement saying \"sections of the media have reported malicious and factually incorrect story that is false, fabricated and without any basis stating that 'Preity Zinta was stopped from boarding GoAir flight.'\"\n\nIt further went on to say,\"GoAir strongly and completely denies any such action. Contrary to the reportage, all the facts-on-ground clearly show that Ms Preity Zinta had a smooth flight Mumbai to Chandigarh GoAir G8-381 on Saturday March 30, 2019. Further, on April 2, 2019, she also booked herself on a return flight G8 382 from Chandigarh to Mumbai but did not show up. This clearly demonstrates that sections of media have reported mischievously and without verifying the facts with GoAir.\"\n\nPreity Zinta was previously in a relationship with Ness and it was in 2005 when the two made their relationship public and in 2008, the two together bought Kings XI Punjab team of Indian Premier League. However, In 2014, the actress lodged a complaint against ex-boyfriend Ness Wadia alleging her modesty was outraged. In the last hearing of the case, that was filed by Preity Zinta against industrialist Ness Wadia, the court suggested that both the parties resolve the issue in their personal capacity.\n\nPreity Zinta went on to find her Mr Right in Gene Goodenough, a management graduate from Marshall School of Business.\n\nPreity tied the knot with Gene in a private ceremony in Los Angeles on 29th February, 2016. He is a financial consultant of American origin and is associated with a US-based hydroelectric power company.\n\nMore Entertainment stories and picture galleries"
