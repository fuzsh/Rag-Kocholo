According to a report on Pinkvilla.com, Ness Wadia's mother, Maureen Wadia has finally broken her silence on Preity Zinta's FIR against her son. She spoke up on the issue during the Gladrags Mrs India 2015 auditions.

However, she refrained from commenting about it further.

Preity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case

According to reports, Preity Zinta is upset that while she would want to focus on cricket and her team's performance, all that gets written about is her link-ups and film career. Eyebrows were raised when she sat next to Wadia at the IPL players' auction last month. Ask her about it and she glares back. "Why don't you ask him why he came and sat next to me? What did you want me to do, cut the table into two halves? Kings XI Punjab is my team and I've given everything, my hard-earned money. I gave up on my film career to be part of this," she says. In an exclusive chat with TOI, the actress has been quoted as saying that, "What happened between me and Ness was unfortunate. But the franchise is my baby and there's no question of me cutting of my involvement with it," she says.

Bollywood's dimpled actress, Preity Zinta is known for speaking her mind. Be it the Ness Wadia case, or speaking against the underworld, Preity has never refrained from telling the truth. The rumour mills are abuzz with reports of her relationship with cricketer Yuvraj Singh but the pretty actress has refuted the claims vehemently. Preity Zinta recently took to Twitter to clear the air on the link-up rumour. Preity wrote, "Dear Media (Specially International Business times) HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE 2 SAY THAT I HAVE NEVER DATED OR INTENDED TO DATE YUVRAJ SINGH?" She further went on to add, "Comments like these are sexist & reek of cheapness at my place of work. Pls refrain from writing that YUVRAJ & PREITY were in a relationship." [sic]

While Preity has quashed rumours of her link up with Yuvraj, let's take a look at the time when she wrote an open letter talking about her relationship with Ness Wadia.

Preity Zinta and ex-boyfriend Ness Wadia are once again making headlines. According to a Mumbai Mirror report, an attempt at striking a compromise between the industrialist Ness Wadia and Bollywood star and business partner Preity Zinta has failed. The report says that it is because of her insistence on Ness tendering an unconditional apology.

Out of the five conditions Preity has placed in front of Ness, he has refused to honour one of them which is unconditional apology. While the report mentions that Ness was amenable to the other four stipulations. Preity had filed a complaint against Ness on June 12. The news report dated September 5, 2014 further elaborates that the Wadia family favoured a compromise but their scion Ness didn't want to offer unconditional apology.

I may not be super wealthy and powerful but I have truth by my side and I’ve worked very hard all my life and tried to earn respect for myself as a self made professional.

It saddens me that no one at work or around ever stood up for me in the past when I was abused and insulted publicly. This time I was left with no option but to take this stern step as this incident happened in front of way too many people.

Sometimes we are so ashamed and humiliated that we fool ourselves to believe that no one saw what happened . Everyone always looks away as if they don't exist or then we don’t exist. People are embarrassed just enough to look away, but not too embarrassed to intervene.

Ironically what happened at Wankade is being diluted by every other fabricated story about my character except the truth of what happened. I'm sure the witnesses will speak the truth and I trust and believe that the police will do their job fairly and quickly.

No woman likes to be involved in a controversy like this which makes her open and vulnerable for all to take a dig at.

Preity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case

I have worked for over 15 years in the film industry and have never been subject to such humiliating behaviour and for that I really want to thank all the men that worked with me. Through all our highs and lows my head was always held high.

Every human being has a limit to how much they can take; some of us foolishly call it strength and try to look ahead focusing on the positives of work and life.

Preity Zinta speaks her mind out on the Ness Wadia case

All these years I have never said anything about him in the media but now I have no choice.

I humbly request the media and my supporters to pls focus on the issue and the incident that happened in Wankade and not turn this and me into a TV soap. This is not easy for me and my intention is not to harm anyone but simply to protect myself and to stand up for myself. I don’t want any sympathy from anyone but I will sincerely appreciate it if people do not try to take away my dignity in the process of my fight for respect at my workplace. I think after all these years I deserve it and I’m not asking for too much.

Thank you.
