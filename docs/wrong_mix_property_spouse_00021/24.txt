Actress Preity Zinta on Tuesday recorded her statement with the police in connection to her allegations of molestation on former boy friend and industrialist Ness Wadia. She visited Wankhede stadium where she answered queries put up by the investigators.

The actress accompanied by her lawyer reached the Wankhede Stadium in south Mumbai at about 6.40 PM, where tight security arrangements were made by the police to handle the media and the crowd of onlookers.

Marine Drive Police recorded her statement, for more than one and half hours, with regard to the case while crime branch recorded her statement in connection with the threat calls received by Wadia's secretaries, allegedly from gangster Ravi Pujari. She recorded her statement at BCCI office till 8:20 PM. She also helped police reconstruct the sequence of events at the Wankhede stadium.

"I was physically misbehaved," she told cops. "My guest Jean intervened during the fight," she added, referring to a Danish merchant who was present during the alleged incident.

"When I was being misbehaved Mr Jean, who was my guest and sitting on level 2 and sitting aside me stood and forcefully separated me from Ness," she told police.

Preity identified the seats where the alleged misbehaviour took place. She also identified the three spots where the alleged encounter between her and Wadia occurred.

She has given a list of four witnesses to the police. Statements of all the four persons and staff members will be taken, informed police.

According to police, Preity had mentioned three arguments with Wadia in her complaint at three different places inside the Wankhede Stadium on May 30. During one of them, the alleged molestation took place.

Police sought answers from her to figure out these three locations, who may have spotted them while arguing, and what was the trigger for the spat.

Police also asked her about the emails she had exchanged with Wadia before May 30 which had a sense of argument between the two.
