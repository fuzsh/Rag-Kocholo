They agreed that this situation was not typical of the partnership between the two countries and should be tackled only in the spirit of compromise and without infringing on the rights of ordinary people.\n\nMr Aznar extended an invitation to Mr Putin to come to Spain on an official visit. The invitation was accepted."
