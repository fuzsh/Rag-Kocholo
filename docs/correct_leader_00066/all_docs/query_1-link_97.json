        "text": "Spain's new ministerial team was sworn in yesterday after Jose Maria Aznar's biggest cabinet reshuffle in his six-year conservative government.\n\nThe change, which notably brings in new faces as foreign, justice and interior ministers, comes as the Popular Party government faces mounting criticism and a revival of the opposition Socialists.\n\nMr Aznar consolidated the position of his closest associates in the surprise reshuffle but he introduced scant new blood and few clues to a successor – Mr Aznar says he will stand down in 2004.\n\nMost striking is the demotion of Josep Pique who, as Foreign Minister, was deemed to have performed disappointingly, failing to have bathed Spain's recently concluded EU presidency in the international lustre Mr Aznar had hoped.\n\nBut Mr Pique also appears to have been punished for failing to deliver a much-vaunted agreement on Gibraltar. A deal that Mr Aznar hoped would be struck this summer and immortalise his name in history seems as far away as ever.\n\nSpanish commentators say Mr Aznar needs Mr Pique, a Catalan, to shore up party support in Catalonia ahead of elections next year.\n\nAna de Palacio – an MEP and sister of European commissioner Loyola de Palacio – takes over from Mr Pique, who is shunted to the Ministry of Science and Technology to grapple with the troubled telecommunications industry. Ms Palacio, admired in Brussels for her tenacity against cancer, was offered the post only after a Catalan nationalist leader, Miquel Roca, turned it down.\n\nMs de Palacio was applauded by her fellow parliamentarians in Strasbourg when she appeared before them completely bald, having decided against wearing a wig despite the obvious effects of chemotherapy.\n\nA rising star, Angel Acebes, the hardline Justice Minister who steered on to the statute book a controversial Political Parties Law – tailor-made to promote the banning of the pro-Eta Batasuna party – becomes Interior Minister.\n\nHe will be in charge of implementing security measures against Eta terrorists and will be asked for ideas to solve the Basque conflict, the government's biggest challenge.\n\nThe floppy-haired government spokesman, Pio Cabanillas, was sacked shortly after announcing to an incredulous nation that no general strike occurred on 20 June and everything operated normally. The Labour Minister, Juan Carlos Aparicio, who defended until the end the strict employment law that prompted the first general strike in nearly a decade, has also gone.\n\nAnother victim was the health minister, Celia Villalobos, who was criticised for having no medical background. Her successor, Ana Pastor, is a doctor.\n\nRodrigo Rato at economy, and Mariano Rajoy who leaves interior to become deputy prime minister consolidate their position as heavyweights.\n\nMr Aznar is on record as saying he will not seek a third term in elections he must call by the spring of 2004.\n\nSpanish commentators said Mr Aznar wanted to go into regional and municipal elections with a fresh slate and a team packed with big hitters."
