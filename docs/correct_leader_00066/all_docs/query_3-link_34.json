        "text": "The Spanish prime minister, José María Aznar, will call a general election on March 14 after sticking to a pledge not to serve more than two continuous terms, the government spokesman Eduardo Zaplana said yesterday.\n\nThe announcement opened the way for Mr Aznar's deputy prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, to take over as his People's party goes into the election with opinion poll leads of up to 11% over the Socialist opposition.\n\nThe Socialist leader, José Luis Rodríguez, has so far been incapable of denting the lead which gave Mr Aznar an outright majority at the last elections in 2000.\n\nMr Aznar has proved to be the leader of a Teflon party that has moved progressively to the right in the past eight years in government.\n\nIt has survived overwhelming popular opposition to its support for George Bush's war in Iraq and the ecological disaster caused by the sinking 14 months ago of the oil tanker Prestige off the north-west coast.\n\nMr Aznar did not dare send troops to take part in the invasion but has since sent 1,000 soldiers to join the occupation force. Eight members of the Spanish military intelligence service have been killed in Iraq.\n\nBut support for the war, which Spaniards largely associate with Mr Aznar himself, only dented the People's party's support for a few months.\n\nConstant economic growth and job creation have eventually weighed more heavily in the polls.\n\nMr Aznar chose Mr Rajoy as his successor in preference to other candidates, such as the economy minister, Rodrigo Rato, partly because of his ability to deflect criticism of the government's handling of the Prestige affair.\n\nMr Rajoy has been a faithful ally to a prime minister whose style has become increasingly presidential over the years. He has acted as campaign manager and fireman in times of crisis.\n\nSome commentators say that, with Mr Aznar making all the decisions, it has been impossible to work out what Mr Rajoy stands for.\n\nMr Rajoy himself, though far more affable than the dry and combative Mr Aznar, has promised continuity if he is elected.\n\nThe election is likely to be decided by the two main parties' stance on whether more power and autonomy should be handed to Spain's regions, especially Catalonia and the troubled Basque country.\n\nMr Aznar has overseen an effective police campaign against the Basque separatist group Eta, which killed three people last year, but his aggressive refusal to give away power has helped cause a considerable rise in tension with some regions.\n\nBut this increasingly acerbic and violent debate wins his party votes, since Spaniards in other areas respond to his claim that regional nationalist parties, with the help of the Socialists, are trying to break up the country.\n\nThe Socialists have been more emollient towards the regions. and accuse the People's party of driving a permanent wedge between Basques, Catalans and other Spaniards.\n\nIf Mr Rajoy does not win an absolute majority at the elections he may be forced to depend on the support of those Catalan and Basque nationalist parties he and his party regularly attack with such ferocity. The party's first government, elected in 1996, relied on their support.\n\nMr Aznar, still only 50, has shown no sign yet of what he intends to do in the future. He has made friends with Tony Blair and the Bush family and there is speculation that he might win their support for any of a number of international posts.\n\nMr Aznar will formally ask King Juan Carlos to dissolve parliament and call the election after a cabinet meeting on January 19, Mr Zaplana said."
