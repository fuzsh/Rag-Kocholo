        "text": "International Students\n\nInternational students also are encouraged to share the cultures of their home countries with classmates both informally and through organized events. Many of these activities are planned by student organizations such as the Middle East Graduate Alliance, the Asia Business Consortium, the European Business Association, the Japan Club, the Latin American Business Association, and the South Asian Business Alliance. These organizations host cultural events and activities, organize trips and outings, and lead initiatives to explore global career opportunities in international markets.\n\nAt the annual International Festival, students gather to share the cuisine, dress, culture, and customs from their home countries with the rest of the MBA community. This family-friendly event often includes dance and cultural demonstrations and boasts attendance of more than 300 MBA students and family members each year.\n\nAs part of our commitment to your academic success, Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business provides a variety of resources to assist international students throughout their time in the MBA program. These resources and workshops include:\n\nAn optional three-week, pre-term course, English Skills for Graduate Students, that teaches practical techniques and effective strategies for reading, writing, and presenting business concepts both in the classroom and in professional settings.\n\nAn International Student Orientation designed specifically to address the needs and concerns of international students when starting the MBA program.\n\nA course in cross-cultural business practices designed to enhance internship experiences that take place in a location outside one’s home country.\n\nWorkshops with immigration attorneys and employment authorization experts to help students understand the regulations and paperwork around MBA visa and immigration issues, including student visas and F-1 visas.\n\nA dedicated representative on the Student Government Association, the vice president for international, whose responsibilities include advocating for the international student population.\n\nDedicated advisors in the Office of Global Services to guide international students in both academic and cultural scenarios.\n\nAs part of its mission to incorporate a global mindset into the classroom experience, Georgetown McDonough also attracts international business leaders to speak to students on campus.
