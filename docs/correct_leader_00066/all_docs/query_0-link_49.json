        "text": "Tallinn, Stenbock House 13 February 2004 Prime Minister Juhan Parts met with Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar today, and praised the Spanish government for promoting trans-Atlantic relations. Parts and Aznar also discussed the current situation in the European economy and the challenges to come. Parts also met with Mariano Rajoy, the former Spanish Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary General of the Spanish Peoples´ Party, and candidate for prime minister. Rajoy introduced Spain´s domestic policy priorities, and Parts recognised significant similarities in the policies of the two rightist-centrist governments, namely the alleviation of unemployment and the promotion of economic growth as the engines of welfare. At the meeting, Parts raised the issue of relations between the European Union and Russia, and both parties to the meeting agreed that Europe´s consistent communication with Russia is in the interests of both Europe and Russia. Parts and Rajoy came to the conclusion that the promotion of trans-Atlantic relations and the struggle against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction must continue. Both Parts and Rajoy admitted that the EU Constitutional Treaty is important, but so is the price at which it is finalised. \"The Constitutional Treaty can be born only when it guarantees equal opportunities to all Member States,\" said Parts. Parts wished the leaders of the Spanish People´s Party success in the election campaign and expressed hope that Rajoy would become the next prime minister of Spain. Parts, who visited Spain within the framework of the meeting of the leaders of the Christian Democratic and People's Parties International, gave a short speech to the assembly in Madrid. Dozens of state and government heads and opposition leaders from all over the world participated in the meeting, and they jointly approved the principles for strengthening the struggle against terrorism. Parts also invited Aznar to Estonia after the elections and the handing over of the prime minister´s post. Government Press Office Phone +372 693 5706, +372 693 5792"
