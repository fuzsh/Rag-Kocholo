        "text": "The victory of the right in Spain on 12 March can be explained first by a booming economy that has been run effectively by the People’s Party (PP) since it came to power in Madrid in 1966. This has given José Maria Aznar and his team the reputation of being sound managers - one they were able to put to good effect.\n\nThe defeat of the left is explained by three things. The first is the record of criminality and corruption built up by the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) after 14 years in power (1982-96). Then there is the split between the party machine and the militants on whom the party imposed a candidate, Joaquin Almunia, even though the grass-roots had rejected him during the primaries in 1998. Last, the union of the communist and socialist left, cobbled together at the last minute, was seen as an electoral ploy incapable of breathing life into a bland campaign that had neither pace nor projects.\n\nAznar’s victory shows that in Spain the right’s Francoist past is not seen as a crippling handicap. The blanking out of political memory during the transition period (1975-82) succeeded in making dictatorship seem ordinary, and finally making the Franco era just part of history. General Franco’s authoritarian regime (1936-75) was, it is said today, “needed” to put an end to the chaos of the Republic (1931-39), and to save the people from communism, bring them into Europe and give them a democratic king.\n\nHow is such a perversion of democratic memory possible? And how does one reconcile a solidly left-wing stance where the affairs of daily life are concerned - of which la movida, that snook-cocking Spanish view of life and morals, is the best-known expression - with the radical shift to the right on 12 March?\n\nIn most developed countries the 1980s were a time of disenchantment: opting-out as citizens, breakdown of social ties, withdrawal into private life, increasing polarisation, rejection of the state, disaffection with politics. Classical democracy was an increasingly leaky ship. In the first part of the 20th century, the move from minority to mass democracy had to pay its dues to the fascist regimes. But the way democracy is practised today in a mass-media society takes the meaning out of the basic features of the democratic model - public opinion, political debate, participation and pluralism.\n\nOn top of these breakdowns in the system, the parties are engulfing state and society: politics are becoming a field reserved entirely for the professionals the parties have recruited and trained. Ordinary people’s loss of interest in politics is largely a reaction to their exclusion from society; it stems not so much from a weakening of democratic principles and values - those are stronger than ever - as from the failure of a model and of institutions that are incapable of governing our complex societies or measuring up to the political and social expectations of the population as a whole.\n\nGovernability is becoming the main problem, and all the proposals made to deal with the crisis in democracy seek to solve this central problem. We are seeing democracy become an instrument of legitimation and control. It sees a limit to participation and pluralism as a good thing, and is turning consensus and direct negotiation between groups into the new pillars of political life.\n\nSmooth transition\n\nIt was in a context like this that in the mid-1970s Greece, Portugal and Spain moved to democracy, followed later by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. All of these transitions have been in line with the concept of controlled democracy. They have all been top-down, run mainly by the parties and large institutions who push out to the sidelines the popular forces that are the real motor of change. Amnesia about the autocratic past, and the patronage of the Western powers as guarantors of the result, complete the picture.\n\nIn the countries of southern Europe, too, it is a matter of changing the political regime while confirming the social system. There is one difference, however. Greece and Portugal are making a total break with the previous regimes, and putting their political personnel out to grass. In Spain, on the other hand, that break is not being made by those who alone could have made it - the parties of the left. They say that calling for that break would have provoked a head-on clash with the armed forces, and ended in a return to dictatorship in its harshest form.\n\nReading official American documents that have now become available makes it impossible to sustain this assumption of a military intervention. The contacts that Vernon Walters, a key figure in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Richard Nixon’s special envoy, kept up with Franco and his generals were designed to keep Spain in the Western camp once Franco was gone. When the latter, talking about his death and after, said “Everything’s tied up, and the knots are tight”, he undoubtedly had Washington’s assurance in mind.\n\nSo it was not for fear of the army that the idea of a break with the dictatorship was abandoned, and reform based on doing a deal put in its place. This made it possible for the transition to become a mask behind which the Franco regime could transform itself. Because of it everyone - from the head of state (the king) and the president of his government to virtually the entire power structure of the dictatorship, including the political police - was able to acquire a new legitimacy, allowing them a share in fathering the new democracy.\n\nFrom then on, resistance to Francoism was wiped out, dissolved in the transition that gave everyone, whether they had been pro- or anti-Franco, the same status as authors of the change. The break with the past that had been announced at the beginning was quickly reduced to mere institutional tinkering, a mechanism for confirming the social structure of the Franco days - economic groups, the big families, the top people in the professions, the upper ranks of the civil service, and the academic establishment. They were all there before and, with one or two tweaks and additions to the list, they are still there today. From this viewpoint, transition in Spain has indeed been exemplary.\n\nA faithful chronicling of the facts did not, however, measure up either to what the major world powers wanted - a post-Franco Spain washed clean of all stains - or to the urgent ethical needs of the Western democracies. Racked by guilt for having left the Spanish republic to its fate in 1936, they needed to believe that within a few months - without a shot fired or any painful episodes - Franco and his supporters had gone and the country now had nothing but true democrats. It was a miracle, and above all an outstanding model worthy of praise and emulation.\n\nGoya, Carmen and ‘la movida’\n\nYet for many foreigners this bland Spain was at odds with another - the Spain of Goya and Carmen - that in the European imagination embodied the strange and the picturesque and for which many felt a deep nostalgia. The film-maker Pedro Almodóvar, devoted to his films and to la movida, filled in the void of these frustrated expectations.\n\nAlmodóvar has been fêted in France, Europe and the US. His latest film All About My Mother, in particular, has won unanimous acclaim and over the last year has carried off the Western film world’s main prizes - from Cannes last May to last month’s Oscar for best foreign film. The remarkable thing about this adulation is that it highlights the social criticism that is part and parcel of any consideration of Almodóvar’s films, as well as his obvious link with the anti-Franco camp.\n\nAlmodóvar’s supporters all make the same point: “For 40 years, Spain was sunk in a deep sleep under the effect of three powerful soporifics - the police, censorship and the Church. The shift to democracy in 1975 was unable to bring an end to this slumbering reality. Only la movida has managed it - and Pedro Almodóvar is the man who embodies that gentle and radical revolution.”\n\nLeaving aside the undeniable quality of his work as films, how has Almodóvar managed to become the symbol of the break with Franco? He has identified himself with one dominant option, and set about a relentless dismantling of the Franco ethos in daily life. The choice is that of post-modernism; riding a liberal wave, it spurns public social values in favour of private ones: primacy goes to the individual and his interpersonal relationships (between a couple, or within the tribe), and to favourite themes - the religion of the ego, the end of certainty, the cult of success, the glorification of indifference, the dogma of pleasure, and so on.\n\nFlaunting vulgarity\n\nAlmodóvar embraces this option, moves his position to the extreme, and uses as his weapon the device of confrontation that has invaded every area of communication. In his hands the provocative treatment of his subject becomes mockery of the values of Franco’s Spain, a gibe at the dictatorship’s public and private institutions, and sarcastic comment on the social mores of its ruling class.\n\nIn High Heels Almodóvar holds the judiciary up to ridicule, showing the examining magistrate as both a “grass” and a cabaret transvestite. He pokes fun at religion whenever it appears and uses life in a convent - in Dark Habits Juliette, the mother superior of the Humble Redeemers, is a lesbian drug-addict - to finally settle his account with its arch-representatives, the enclosed orders and the parish priests.\n\nHe relentlessly pillories the police in all its forms, and makes it the protagonist of the counter-epic of order in Live Flesh. The motherland and the monarchies are his target in Labyrinth of Passion; and we are shown the traditional family as an out-of-date gimmick that, in What Have I Done To Deserve This? and All About My Mother, is fit only for the scrapheap.\n\nBut it is in the form more than the content of his films that Almodóvar brings about this demolition of dictatorship and its ways. He turns the forms of Francoism on their head. Faced with the horror of vulgarity and veneration of distinction that are the hallmark of the Franco bourgeoisie, Almodóvar flaunts his preference for the crude and the salacious. He espouses the cause of political correctness, and goes beyond it in the treatment of his subject. More than simple rebellion by minorities, what is claimed in his films is the right of minority groups to create values. For Almodóvar it is not enough to recognise that racial and sexual minorities and those on the margins of society have every right to exist. What he is after is to exalt the moral qualities of antisocial behaviour, thus conferring on the symbolic horizon of the deviant the status of excellence.\n\nIn the universe Almodóvar inhabits, the good people, the ones who redeem the evils of this world, are the transvestites, the drug addicts, the bad mothers and the rejects of society. For them to become the majority expression of society, however, it is essential for the values of the minorities’ marginality to gain public recognition. Public and collective acceptance of these values is the only thing that can make them the dominant benchmark.\n\nThis is why the iconoclasm of the Madrid movida - negligible in itself as mere copying of the more radical behaviour that had gone before - took on the value of a point of reference only when the public authorities had made them their own. If one compares them with the campaigns of social protest in the 1960s and 1970, the scandals of the movida have been very naive. What was most significant about the movida was not the intensity of the social breakdown it was able to bring about, but the effectiveness with which it became rehabilitated into the institutions. It made possible the move from the cultural dissidence of a tiny minority in the Franco days to the public and social adoption of the urban counter-culture of May 1968 as an expression of unfettered liberty.\n\nAlmodóvar perfects the official rubber-stamping of the private-social break with the Franco ethos by emphasising the popular note of his films, making a show of the happy feelings and happy endings, shedding their melodramatic dimension to adopt as his model the photo-romance where love conquers all.\n\nHis alienated Romeo and Juliet are the lawyer Maria Cardenal and toreador Diego Montes in Matador, for whom orgasm is inextricably bound up with the act of killing; so the fact of dying of love, the only possible fate, is played out in the joint action of loving and dying and consists of killing oneself so as to love oneself. St Augustin’s motto of Ama et fac quod vis - “Love, and do what thou wilt” - could well be that of Almodóvar’s films.\n\nBy combining the subversiveness of the drop-out with political correctness, Almodóvar put an end to everyday Francoism. Yet might not his triumph, a revenge for those who lost the civil war, have without his realising it provided an excuse for perpetuating the social hierarchy and economic forces inherited from the dictatorship? There is virtually unanimous acceptance, in every country, of his social protest, and his films reap a rich harvest of prizes. But might not these facts reveal the basic ambiguity that is the starting point for the system’s take-over of the iconoclasm inherent in his work?"
