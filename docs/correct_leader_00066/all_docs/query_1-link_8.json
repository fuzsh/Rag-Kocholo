        "text": "José María Aznar (born February 25, 1953, Madrid, Spain) is a lawyer and politician who served as the prime minister of Spain from 1996 to 2004.\n\nAznar was born into a politically active, conservative family in Spain. His grandfather was a friend of dictator General Francisco Franco, and both his father and grandfather held government jobs during Franco’s regime.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nSpain: The Aznar regime\n\nIn 1975, during Spain’s transition to democracy, Aznar received a law degree from the Complutense University of Madrid, and he subsequently worked as a government tax inspector. He became active in the conservative Popular Alliance, and in 1982 he was elected to the Congress of Deputies, the lower house of the Cortes (legislature). He served as the party’s secretary-general in 1982–87 and was elected its vice president in 1989 and its president in 1991. By the end of the 1980s the party, which by then had changed its name to the Popular Party (PP), had moderated its platform and abandoned much of its Francoist legacy, adopting centre-right positions on most issues. Aznar was active in this transformation, recruiting women and young people to the party.\n\nIn April 1995 Aznar was wounded in a car bombing that was attributed to the Basque separatist group ETA. In elections the following year, the PP benefited from the scandals and corruption plaguing the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party, which had governed the country from 1982. Although the PP failed to win an outright majority, it was able to form a governing coalition with several small regional parties, and Aznar took office as prime minister on March 6. He appointed a cabinet with a wide range of views and emphasized economic reforms, including a reduction in government expenditures. During the following years there were steady improvements in the economy, though unemployment remained stubbornly high. Aznar also attempted to strengthen Spain’s ties with Latin American countries and adopted a policy of refusing to negotiate with ETA. In September 1998 ETA announced a cease-fire but then broke it in January 2000 with a new wave of violence."
