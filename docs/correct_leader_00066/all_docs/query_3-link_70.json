        "text": "When Jose Maria Aznar was Spain’s prime minister and Rafael Bardaji served as his national security adviser, both men were concerned about terrorist acts committed against Israel and the growing lack of support for Israel by European countries.\n\n“We were very much sympathetic to the Israelis suffering from terrorism, particularly after the second Intifada,” Bardaji said. “There was a strategic assessment saying that Israel, as a part of the Western world, is at the forefront of this civilization battle between radical Islam on the one hand and the democratic values of the Western world on the other. Of immediate concern was the growing legitimization campaign against Israel’s right to exist, particularly in Europe, but also in Latin America.”\n\nIn 2010, Aznar and Bardaji formed the Friends of Israel Initiative, a group of high-profile, non-Jewish leaders who promote the security and well-being of Israel to non-Jewish world leaders.\n\nAznar, who served as Spain’s prime minister from 1996 to 2004, will speak at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at Temple Emanu-El on “Fighting for Israel: My Second Career.”\n\nRabbi Michael Resnick, spiritual leader of Temple Emanu-El, said he’s appreciative of Rick Stone and the Stone Family Fund sponsoring the event as part of the synagogue’s 50th anniversary celebration.\n\n“Temple Emanu-El is delighted to open our doors to President Aznar,” Resnick said. “We’re honored to have him speak on behalf of Israel and look forward to welcoming him with open arms. We strongly appreciate his willingness to stand with Israel.”\n\nSome of the high-powered board members of FoII are: John Bolton, former U.S. representative to the United Nations; Alejandro Toledo, former president of Peru; Luis Alberto LaCalle, former president of Uruguay; Lord David Trimble, former First Minister of Ireland and 1998 Nobel Peace Prize winner; former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and Donna Shalala, president of the University of Miami and former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Resources.\n\n“Because of our network, depending on the issue, we have the ability to call world leaders and have a frank and direct conversation,” said Bardaji, speaking by phone Thursday from Spain. “For instance, the president of France, Germany or Italy. We have regular contact with all of them and try to engage them on specific issues as needed.”\n\nIn regard to the organization, “the main question people want to know is why a group of high-profile, non-Jewish people — with no particular personal interest in Israel or Israeli business — would stand up in favor of Israel,” Bardaji said.\n\n“They want to know what moves them to put themselves at the forefront of complicated issues, what are the fears about the future of Israel and why it’s important to fight openly in favor of Israel and against any international campaign proposals of boycotting Israel,” Bardaji said.\n\nAs Asnar has said, “If Israel goes down, we all go down.”\n\nPalestinians and their supporters have initiated a global campaign of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, which calls for boycotting all Israeli products and ending the occupation of the West Bank, and demands the right of millions of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes.\n\n“If you look at the whole map of actions taken by enemies of Israel, you see a pattern or delegitimization,” Bardaji said. “We are not defending any particular policy. We are not defending or criticizing settlements. We are supporting the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state and the defensible borders.”"
