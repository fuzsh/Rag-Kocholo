        "text": "From CNN Madrid Bureau Chief Al Goodman\n\nMADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, ending months of speculation, has chosen Deputy Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as the candidate to succeed him for the general elections scheduled for next March.\n\n\"It's true. That he (Rajoy) is the candidate is officially confirmed,\" an aide to Aznar told CNN.\n\nSpain's state-run television TVE and state-run news agency EFE broke the news at midday Saturday, ahead of Aznar's formal announcement expected Monday before the leadership of his ruling conservative Popular Party.\n\nAznar, 50, was first elected in 1996 and then re-elected in 2000.\n\nHe said more than a year ago that he would not run for a third term, setting off increasingly intense speculation as to which trusted aide would lead the party forward. Aznar intends to serve out his term, through the elections.\n\nRajoy, 48, has been the first deputy prime minister since 2000, and previously held other cabinet portfolios under Aznar. His political fortunes have been tied to Aznar's for years.\n\nThe main opposition Socialist Party has criticized Aznar for naming his successor in what it described as a regal manner rather than holding party primaries to let the rank and file conservatives decide among the candidates.\n\nTwo other key conservative candidates for the post were Rodrigo Rato, the second deputy prime minister, who also holds the position of economy minister; and the former interior minister Jaime Mayor Oreja.\n\nA government-run poll this week put the ruling conservatives ahead of the Socialists. At least one previous poll, for the SER radio network, had said the Socialist candidate, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, would beat the various conservative candidates, except Rajoy.\n\nAznar has faced mounting criticism in the last year -- from opposition parties and from large street protests -- for his government's handling of the huge oil spill from the tanker Prestige off of northwest Spain last November, and for his support of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, when opinion polls showed up to 90 percent of Spaniards opposed the war.\n\nSpain has just placed 1,300 combat-trained peacekeeping troops in Iraq, patrolling a section south of Baghdad.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
