        "text": "Yet not everybody thinks the party’s new strategy is a sound one.\n\n“What Casado is trying to avoid is the catastrophe,” said writer Zarzalejos, arguing that the conservative leader is “overreacting” in his pursuit of potential Vox voters.\n\n“He’s made a sort of tourniquet of the bleeding that was going away on his right,” Zarzalejos said. “Is this sufficient, is this enough, does it have a future? We’ll see on April 28, but I am very skeptical.”\n\nThe Anti-Rajoy\n\nBorn in Palencia 250 kilometers north of Madrid, Casado is married and has two children. He entered politics in the regional branch of the Popular Party in the region of Madrid, where he had moved for his graduate studies. He served as chief of staff for Aznar after the prime minister stepped down from office, became a national lawmaker in 2011 and his party’s vice secretary for communications in 2015 under Rajoy.\n\nCasado’s political vision was shaped by his early experiences in the party — first in Madrid under the leadership of Esperanza Aguirre, sometimes described as Spain’s Margaret Thatcher, then as a protégé of Aznar. He was nurtured by a wing of the party that is more conservative on social issues, more pro-market on economics, more pro-U.S. on international politics and tougher on regional nationalism.\n\n“He’s a very young person but with deep ideological convictions,” Zarzalejos said. “He represents the most conservative branch of the PP … and he’s injecting high doses of ideology in a party that lost them under Rajoy.”\n\nRajoy put Casado in charge of dealing with the press during a constant stream of corruption scandals among the conservatives. Casado trained himself with aggressive reporters and political rivals on TV shows, and cultivated relationships with journalists.\n\nWhile Rajoy dodged press conferences and difficult interviews, Casado argued that the party should make the most of any opportunity to make its voice heard, even in challenging circumstances.\n\nAfter Rajoy was toppled last summer, Casado was quick to seize the opportunity, winning a party primary against — among others — former Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, who was seen as more of a continuity candidate.\n\nCasado claims to have traveled 140,000 kilometers — the equivalent of three trips around the world — delivering his message from villages to towns to cities in all provinces of the country since he took the helm of the Popular Party.\n\nIt’s a telling figure that speaks to the energetic approach with which the 38-year-old lawyer and economist has replaced the cautious, sometimes leaden style of Rajoy. Indeed, in many ways, Casado is his predecessor’s opposite.\n\nRajoy made his first bid for the premiership after a long career of public office, that saw him rise from local councillor to minister to deputy prime minister. Casado is a member of parliament but lacks any managing experience as a government official.\n\n“We are going to tear down once and for all that wall of false moral superiority from the left” — Pablo Casado, leader of Spain’s Popular Party\n\nWhere Rajoy was seen as the face of experience compared to his much younger rivals, Casado is the youngest leader among Spain’s five big political forces — even as he leads the party with the oldest electorate, with nearly half of potential voters over 65 years old.\n\nWhile Rajoy sometimes appeared uncomfortable in social gatherings, party insiders say Casado enjoys rallies and contact with the public, something he himself has said is essential in electoral politics.\n\nRajoy was born in a bilingual region, Galicia, and although he never properly learned the Galician language, his origin exposed him to Spain’s cultural diversity in a way that Casado’s Castilian origin may have not.\n\nAnd Rajoy championed technocratic management, sidelined more ideological cadres and shifted to the center in his third — and eventually successful — bid for power in 2011. Casado, in contrast, defends the importance of ideology.\n\n“We must mobilize our values to solve problems,” Casado said in a speech in front of leaders of the European People’s Party Congress in Helsinki in November, where he advocated for “politics rather than mere bureaucratic management.”\n\nHis rhetoric reflects the renewed focus on ideological divisions. In January, Casado told a national party gathering: “We are going to tear down once and for all that wall of false moral superiority from the left.”\n\nCasado’s shift to the right and his openness to deals with the far right are the new normal for conservative parties in the EU, said Ignacio Molina, a researcher for Elcano, a think tank. He added that Sánchez used a similar strategy to counter the rise of the far-left Podemos, shifting sharply to the left before moderating after taking office.\n\n“Rajoy’s PP was akin to Merkel, while Casado’s PP is akin to Kurz,” said Molina, comparing the conservative party’s leaders to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who moved her party to the middle, and Austrian leader Sebastian Kurz, who is ruling the country in a coalition with the far right.\n\nSánchez problem\n\nOn the campaign trail, Casado has railed against the prime minister. “Pedro Sánchez is a public danger for Spain,” he told a rally last Thursday in Madrid.\n\nHe went on to draw a nightmarish portrait of the Socialist leader, who he said is ready to cut Spain into pieces and grant independence to Catalonia in association with the region’s separatists and the radical left for the sake of remaining in office.\n\nIn recent months, Casado has labeled Sánchez a “felon,” a “traitor,” “the most radical prime minister of Spain’s democratic history” and the “friend of terrorists and putschists.”\n\nThe conservative leader’s rough tone reveals the scale of the task he’s facing, with Sánchez polling a strong first and the right-wing electorate divided.\n\nCasado’s right-wing turn — plus the fact that the Popular Party and Ciudadanos toppled the ruling Socialists in Andalusia with the backing of Vox in December and have vowed to do the same at the national level — has allowed Sánchez pitch himself as the only moderate choice.\n\nIn a rally in Las Palmas over the weekend, Sánchez accused the Popular Party and Ciudadanos of “embracing” the far right. “It is one right with three names,” he said. “They’re going to act like a bloc if they add up a ruling majority after April 28, as they did in Andalusia.”\n\nThe prime minister has also maneuvered to deepen the divisions in the right. When Casado demanded a face-to-face debate with Sánchez, the Socialist leader declined, opting instead for a format including all five leaders of the major national parties.\n\nA series of mistakes during the campaign add to Casado’s problems. The conservative leader spoke of the minimum wage in a radio interview in terms that could be interpreted as a formal plan to cut it down if elected prime minister; his economic guru did the same talking about the pension system; and another candidate came up with a bizarre theory that a new law in New York had legalized abortions “after birth.”\n\nStill, with around 42 percent of the wider electorate still undecided, polls suggest the conservative leader remains the only candidate with a shot at replacing Sánchez at the top of Spain’s government.\n\n“I believe [our efforts] will be rewarded but, in any case, the situation I found wasn’t easy” — Pablo Casado\n\n“Pablo Casado is in a very delicate situation, but he could become prime minister,” said a Socialist official working on the party’s campaign.\n\nIf he doesn’t — and his party experiences the collapse in support some polls predict — Casado could soon face a leadership challenge of his own.\n\nAsked about the issue last week in a radio interview, Casado said he intends to continue to lead the party no matter the results, and reminded the interviewer that both Aznar and Rajoy lost two elections before they won one.\n\n“I’ve seized the reins of a party with 16 percent of voters’ intentions and with an electoral base split into three,” he said. “I believe [our efforts] will be rewarded but, in any case, the situation I found wasn’t easy.”\n\nNonetheless, a conservative counterrevolution could be in the offing."
