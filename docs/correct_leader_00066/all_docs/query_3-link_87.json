José María Aznar was a Spanish politician who served as Prime Minister of Spain from 1996 to 2004 as the leader of the conservative People's Party. He obtained a law degree and worked in the public sector before joining the Popular Alliance, which became the People's Party. As Prime Minister, Aznar pursued market liberalization and privatization policies that led to economic growth but moderately high unemployment. He supported the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, which hurt his popularity. The 2004 Madrid train bombings, which al-Qaeda carried out but the government initially blamed on Basque separatists, contributed to Aznar's party losing power in that year's election.",
