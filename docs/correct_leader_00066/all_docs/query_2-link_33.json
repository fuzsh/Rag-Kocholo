        "text": "The next Prime Minister: who is Mariano Rajoy?\n\nGiven this situation the Spanish again called on the People's Party, which is now led by Mariano Rajoy. A discreet, low-profile politician in spite of a sound education and remarkable experience, whom the ballot boxes granted the biggest centre-right majority in Spain since the restoration of democracy in 1977 [4]. Therefore within the next few days this Galician politician, who in his time became Spain's youngest property registrar [5], will take over the government, so culminating one of the most complete political careers in the country, which includes responsibilities on local, autonomous and national levels. He has served as a town councillor in Pontevedra (the capital of his home province), as chair of the county council of the same province (1983-1986); as MP and member of the Autonomous Government of Galicia (1986-1987), and as national MP from 1989 to the present. He was also a member of the government during José Maria Aznar's two terms in office (1996-2004); and has led the Opposition during Rodríguez Zapatero's period (2004-2011). As a Minister, he successively took care of the portfolios of the civil service, education, interior and the presidency, and in various times he was the government's spokesperson, as well as being its deputy leader. Moreover, he has also been the Deputy Secretary General of the People's Party (2003-2004), which he leads from 2004.\n\nIn the light of this career, it is not surprising therefore that Mariano Rajoy qualifies himself as a \"predictable\" man, and that this very concept occupies a major position in his electoral programme; indeed this won the support of the majority of Spanish society, especially with regard to European issues and economic policy. Great emphasis is placed on the need for Spain to become a \"reliable and dependable\" player again in the international arena and for it to undertake an economic reform programme that will make its position \"\"predictable\" [6]. We might then legitimately consider that the new government will adopt the principles established during the \"Aznar era\" placing specific emphasis on the need to guarantee economic stability.\n\nThis is why it might be useful to recall what José Maria Aznar declared in 2003, as leader of the Spanish government, to participants in the summer universities of the European Ideas Network, which met at the Escorial (Madrid): \"We (the Spanish) love the German culture of stability so much that we have made it ours. And this is very positive for a country like Spain which a few years ago was -quite rightly – suspected of generating a great deal of economic instability ....\" This explains why, in this difficult period, he maintained that the \"Stability Pact was one of the foundations of European growth\" and that he \"supported the introduction of new concepts into the European social model, such as budgetary balance.\" [7].\n\nUndeniably then it seems that the new government's policy will make \"predictability\" and economic, international stability, its priority. The first steps taken by the \"popular\" leader seem to confirm this trend, although this has not been firmly included in a government programme yet.\n\nIndeed one of the features of the Spanish institutional system is that it envisages excessively long delays in the formation of the new government after the elections. Although on 20th November it was clear that the People's Party had won the absolute majority, the new Chambers have met only on 13th December and only afterwards – probably on 19th December- the Chamber of Deputies will hold a session during which it will debate – and possibly approve- the programme put forward by the King's candidate to the presidency of the government in view of the electoral results.\n\nAnd so today it is still impossible to define the government's programme which the Spanish Parliament will have to approve. However we might note several important details which point to Spain's absolute priority in its commitment to the ongoing European integration process.\n\nThe government programme: the EU as a priority\n\n• Firstly, the electoral programme. It is no coincidence that the first paragraph, devoted to the economy and significantly entitled \"stability and reform for employment\" stresses that \"Spain will again be a base of economic stability and confidence for the euro zone. The policies which are in force in our country must no longer pose a problem for the other European partners. This is bad for Europe, but above all it is bad for the Spanish. We promise to assume and respect, in an exemplary manner, the commitments we make with regard to stability towards the other partners in the single currency. It is only like this that Spain will be able to recover the highest level of credit and that Spanish entrepreneurs will be able to access funding in conditions similar to those enjoyed by the most prosperous and credible nations in Europe.\" [8].\n\nIt is no coincidence either that in the last chapter, devoted to the foreign policy, it is stated quite literally that \"the European Union is the People's Party's vocation\"; quite logically it is added that \"we shall make policy towards the European Union the priority in our external activities\"; to do this \"we shall encourage greater economic coordination in Europe, we shall improve the euro zone's governance criteria and we shall foster economic integration.\" All of this is reflected in more or less concrete commitments such as \"defending the strict respect of the Stability and Growth Pact in European economic governance\", \"support the consolidation of European banks, the completion of the internal financial services market and progress towards truly integrated supervision,\" and even \"assume an active role in the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy which is laying the foundations of competitiveness and employment in Spain and Europe\" [9].\n\n• The same ideas occupy a major part of the interviews granted to various media during the campaign. Hence on the private TV channel Antena 3, Mariano Rajoy insisted on the economic importance of international relations, saying that he imagined \"a Foreign Ministry which is extremely up to date on economic issues\" [10]. In the daily El País on 16th November he said that the \"Stability Plan presented in Brussels plans for a commitment to a 4.4% deficit. I want to implement this. Everyone should know that my government's priority will be to keep the promises Spain makes to Brussels. (...) I firmly and unwaveringly want to honour our commitment to remain in the single currency. I am referring here to the commitment to austerity. This is why the first thing I shall do is to adopt the Stability Law which sets in place the constitutional reform that we decided on in the summer and which all administrative bodies will have to adhere to. But we are just as determined to undertake the necessary reforms to foster growth. The most urgent of these is the reform of the labour market before the summer. It is also urgent for us to finish restructuring of our financial system.\" [11]. • This is how we should also interpret Mariano Rajoy's declaration made on the evening of the election, after his victory had been confirmed [12]. In a text that was barely two pages and a half pages long he – quite naturally – stressed the priority given to economic issues and his determination to deal with them according to the criteria and principles set out previously: \"No one should be worried. My only enemies will be unemployment, the deficit, the excessive debt and economic stagnation ... Spain is at a decisive turning point, a cross roads that will decide the future of our country, not only for the coming years but also for the coming decades.\" And in this situation \"we want to be \"influential\" in the biggest integrated area: the European Union. Today, more than ever before our fate is being decided in and with Europe. The Spanish voice has to be respected again in Brussels, Frankfurt and in other places where our interests are at stake. We shall no longer be a problem, we shall be a part of the solution.\" Of course all of this was said calmly, employing the weight of experience: \"There will be no miracles. We have not promised them. But as we have witnessed on other occasions, when things are done well, the results are there to be seen. I am convinced that work, seriousness and constancy – which are the principles that I have always relied on – will also be implemented so that we can all reap the benefits rapidly. I invite you all to share the same confidence.\" • Almost identical arguments were used in a recent article published in the specialist review \"Política exterior\" [13]. It is repeated that \"the EU has to occupy a central place and be a priority in Spain's political action\" and that \"the European project is in great difficulty today, the extent of these problems has to be realised if we are to face them effectively. We need greater pro-European ambition and a pro-active attitude towards the economic crisis, which has revealed our weakest points that we have been ignoring for years. Greater economic integration, the defence of the euro, the strict respect of the Stability and Growth Pact, the completion of the internal financial service market, as well as budgetary consolidation and totally integrated supervision are some of the vital reforms that Spain has to promote (...). This is why we must play an extremely active role in reviving the updated Lisbon Agenda, the \"Europe 2020 strategy\" for intelligent, sustainable and unifying growth. Also in the negotiation of the upcoming Financial Perspective, Spain has to argue in support of adequate resources for the Union ...\" • Finally the same impression results from the information available about the activity (more than discreet) of the candidate who will surely become the next president of the Spanish government. That is the case of the recent meetings with European leaders such as Antonio Tajani, Vice-President of the European Commission and Commissioner for Industry and Enterprise (29th November) [14], and the British Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg (2nd December) [15].\n\nIn conclusion all of the available information seems to indicate that for the new Spanish government, the strict respect of commitments taken out with the European Union will comprise an absolute priority. It will be difficult for the main party of the parliamentary opposition, which supported the government that assumed those commitments, to challenge these. Particularly, when the next executive will count on the support of most of the local and autonomous governments, also won by the People's Party in the local and regional elections last May."
