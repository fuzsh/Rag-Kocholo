        "text": "FOR a ‘nobody’ with zero charisma, the man who’s just taken over as the EU’s president in office is not doing at all badly.\n\nWhen José María Aznar was elected as Spain’s first centre-right prime minister since the Franco era, the country’s press delighted in mocking the fact that the former tax inspector was, not to put too fine a point on it, boring.\n\n“Aznar was a Mr Nobody,” centre-right daily El Mundo wrote recently, referring to his 1996 election victory.\n\nOther papers ridiculed his Charlie Chaplin-style moustache, diminutive size, geeky forced smile and the fact that almost everyone agrees he has a dreary voice and no flair for public speaking.\n\nIn short, his detractors said, he was not a patch on his flamboyant, charismatic predecessor, socialist Felipe González.\n\nBut Aznar had the last laugh on his critics when he won a second, crushing election victory in March last year.\n\nAznar himself argues that the reason the voters so resoundingly endorsed his government is clear.\n\nAfter the allegations of scandal and corruption that mired the closing years of González’s reign, the people didn’t want another charismatic but flawed messiah.\n\nThey simply wanted somebody who could get the job done.\n\n“I am not a slave to my image and I don’t want to be one,” Aznar argues. Today, modern political leadership requires leaders that are stricter, more rigorous, who speak less but do more.”\n\nPoliticians and diplomats who have had dealings with Aznar also suggest he is not necessarily as tedious as his public persona might suggest.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, another man not noted for his sparkling repartee, said he was pleasantly surprised after meeting Aznar for the first time.\n\nHe said his advisors had warned: “The Spanish government leader is pragmatic, a bit dry, does not give much attention to the personal side of his job and is extremely difficult to negotiate with.”\n\n“To my great pleasure, this advice was not justified,” Putin declared after their meeting.\n\nAznar’s European partners, on the other hand, would no doubt argue that the Russian president’s advisors didn’t get it all wrong – especially when it comes to the Spanish leader’s bargaining style.\n\nAt practically every EU summit he has attended since taking office, Aznar has doggedly defended Spanish interests against all comers.\n\nHe has been particularly hard-nosed when it comes to ensuring that Madrid will remain a healthy beneficiary of EU handouts after enlargement and has not been afraid to threaten to use his veto on a wide range of issues.\n\nAznar’s stamina is legendary. He apparently works out with a personal trainer every morning to ensure that he is on top form for the day ahead – whenever it ends.\n\nAt December 1999’s crucial Agenda 2000 summit, which fixed the EU’s budget until 2006, he held out to\n\n5am until he got his way.\n\n“It was already late when Schröder told me ‘Look, this is what’s on the table’. And I said I would not agree to the proposals as they stood. Later on, in the early morning, Chirac said: ‘So you still disagree, what do you propose to do?’ I told him: ‘I will take out a cigar and then I will smoke it,'” Aznar recalled in a recent interview.\n\nBut while few question his abilities as a tough negotiator, Aznar’s reputation as Spain’s ‘Mr Clean’ has suffered a number of knocks in recent months.\n\nThe biggest blow came following the collapse of Spanish stockbroking firm Gescatera, one of the country’s most venerable financial institutions. A subsequent investigation into the affair revealed a web of kick-backs and corruption that went to the highest level.\n\nBoth deputy finance minister Enrique Giménez Reyna, whose sister worked at Gescatera, and the head of the Spanish stock exchange Pilar Valiente were forced to resign in July after the scandal broke and for a while it seemed as though finance minister Rodrigo Rato would also have to fall on his sword.\n\nHowever, on 15 November a parliamentary committee ruled that Aznar’s government had had no direct link with the Gescatera affair, apparently saving the premier’s team from disgrace at least for the time being.\n\nFor Aznar there is one area above all others in which he feels he must put his pledge to ‘do more’ into practice – balancing the country’s budget.\n\nHe describes his mania for balanced book-keeping as “a religion” and says everyone in his government must share his deeply held convictions.\n\n“It is the only subject on which I will not tolerate any discussion in my cabinet. Those who are not in agreement are free to go,” he said recently. Aznar’s belief in balanced budgets and minimal public spending also lies at the heart of his vision of European politics, a view he shares with the UK’s nominally left-wing Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nDespite the never-ending Anglo-Spanish spat over the rock of Gibraltar, Blair and Aznar have become a high-profile EU double act. Last month they even penned a joint call for a more dynamic de-regulated single market in the Financial Times. “We must have the courage to take the decisions needed to deliver jobs and prosperity for all our citizens,” the two argued. As part of this drive for a more dynamic Union, Aznar has said he wants to see further liberalisation of Europe’s energy, financial services and telecoms markets before he hands over the Commission presidency baton to the Danes in June.\n\nHe warns that the EU leaders will never achieve the goal they set themselves at the March 2000 summit in Lisbon of making the Union the world’s “most dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010,” unless they bite the liberalisation bullet.\n\nBut the Spanish premier is also under no illusions that moving the issue forward during the next six months will be easy.\n\nThis is not least because the planned market reforms are politically unpopular in France where the state-backed telecoms and energy companies are two of the country’s biggest employers.\n\nWith both parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled in France during the Spanish presidency, Paris will, to say the least, be reluctant to agree to any measures that could upset the voters. The other big theme of Spain’s presidency is sure to be the war against terrorism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAznar was pushing for greater EU-wide and international cooperation in this field even before the 11 September attacks in the US because of Madrid’s long-running feud with the Basque separatist organisation Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA).\n\nSpain warmly welcomed the recent EU agreements on a Union-wide arrest warrant and common definition of terrorism arguing that Europe had made more progress in the fight against terror in the few months following 11 September than it had in the previous\n\ntwo decades.\n\nBut Aznar’s critics say his approach to terrorism is also his Achilles’ heel.\n\nThey argue that when it comes to the Basque question, which he himself describes as “the Spanish problem”, Aznar has shown himself to be inflexible, arrogant and has made a difficult situation worse.\n\nHe has been particularly criticised for apparently tarring the moderate Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) with the same brush as ETA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPNV spokesman Inaki Anasagasti has accused Aznar of “immobilism” in his policy towards the Basque country and said the prime minister had failed to capitalise on a brief ETA cease-fire in 1998.\n\nHis remarks followed Aznar’s comments to the PNV that he had “serious doubts about which side you are on”.\n\nSome critics warn that Aznar’s hard-line stance on terrorism could see him pushing Union-wide measures that infringe basic civil liberties during the coming six months. What is certain about the forthcoming Spanish presidency is that it will be Aznar’s last as his country’s premier. He has made it clear that he will not stand for re-election in the country’s 2004 polls, arguing that two terms in office is enough for any prime minister in a democracy.\n\nHowever, he is unlikely to disappear from the European political scene altogether. Some pundits have already suggested he might make a good replacement for current Commission President Romano Prodi.\n\nOthers, however, point out that another boring, inarticulate ex-prime minister is the last thing the beleaguered institution needs.\n\nAdvertisement"
