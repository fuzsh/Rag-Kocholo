        "text": "Dastis now enjoys the position of Spain’s permanent representative to the EU – its ambassador to the EU institutions. The irony, however, is that he made his return to Brussels at a moment when Spain’s influence and standing in the EU were much reduced by the economic crisis. In the first two decades of its EU membership, Spain grew steadily in importance, but the last few years have been a story of decline.\n\nDastis was EU adviser to José Maria Aznar, Spain’s first post-Franco conservative prime minister, from 1996 to 2000. Among other things, he was in charge of organising Spain’s presidency of the Council of Ministers, which ran in the first half of 2002 (it included European Councils in Barcelona and Seville, the latter almost derailed by nationwide strikes in protest against labour reforms).\n\nAznar clearly trusted Dastis and at the end of 2001 nominated him to the convention on the future of Europe that drew up a constitutional treaty. Initially, Dastis played second fiddle to Ana Palacio, Spain’s foreign minister – or perhaps Sancho Panza to her Don Quixote. She was one of the 12 members (plus one observer) that made up the Praesidium, the inner core of the convention.\n\nHowever, Palacio stepped aside from the convention in the spring of 2003 at the outbreak of the invasion of Iraq, so Dastis took her place in what were the closing stages of negotiations (the draft constitutional treaty was published in July 2003).\n\nPeter Norman, in his account of the convention, “The Accidental Constitution”, writes that: “The promotion of Dastis provided much needed backbone for the government representative and brought to the fore a formidable negotiator.”\n\nMore bluntly, Le Monde described Dastis as “Giscard’s bête noire”.\n\nAznar was deeply opposed to the plans of Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, the chairman of the convention, to rewrite the EU’s voting rules in a way that would have diminished Spain’s influence relative to the biggest three member states. Dastis cobbled together an improbable alliance to resist those changes and maintain the voting rules of the Nice treaty. Eventually, Giscard d’Estaing and his two vice-presidents, Giuliano Amato and Jean-Luc Dehaene, had to mount a concerted campaign to dismantle Dastis’s alliance. Throughout the night of 5 June 2003, they peeled away Spain’s allies one by one until Dastis was forced to compromise. Nevertheless, the convention established Dastis’s reputation in EU circles.\n\nHe was in his element in that arena because, as those who have worked with him in Brussels are fond of remarking, he has “a great legal mind”. He had initially started out as a legal scholar and the law defined much of his early career.\n\nIn the 1970s, like many young men of good family, Dastis studied law at the University of San Pablo in Madrid – Roman Catholic and private – followed by the public Complutense University of Madrid. He embarked on a doctoral thesis on the freedom of establishment of insurance companies, but abandoned it in 1983 on gaining entry to the elite Spanish diplomatic service, where for the first few years he worked as a legal adviser.\n\nHe did not, though, cut off all contact with the world of academia. He continued to teach, coaching aspirants to the diplomatic corps to pass the entrance examination. And in 1987 he went to Luxembourg to work as a law clerk for one of his former professors, Gil Carlos Rodríguez Iglesias, Spain’s first judge at the European Court of Justice and a subsequent president of that court. Dastis has continued to contribute articles to academic journals, about the Spanish civil service, the Lisbon treaty, and the EU more generally, and has been heard to quote approvingly a comment by British diplomat Crispin Tickell, who aspired to be “a diplomat among academics and an academic among diplomats”. Clearly Dastis shares that ambition.\n\nIn 1989 his interest in public international law took him to New York, as Spain’s legal adviser at the United Nations. He deputised occasionally for Spain’s ambassador in 1993-94 when Spain held a seat on the UN Security Council and cast Spain’s vote at the Security Council meeting that accepted the Czech Republic and Slovakia as members after they had split.\n\nNowadays, among the diplomats in the Committee of Permanent Representatives, his contributions are – according to colleagues – “short and to the point” and “very thoughtful”.\n\nOne colleague describes him as less “impulsive” than some of his Spanish predecessors. He is also the first Spanish ambassador routinely to speak in the committee in English, although he is equally fluent in French.\n\nDastis, who is a keen golfer, hails from the ancient wine town of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, southern Spain. It is a region awash with customs and old traditions that shape the outsiders’ image of Spain – sherry, bullfighting, flamenco, traditional costumes, horsemanship. But the mild-mannered Dastis does not fit the loud, flamboyant and showy stereotype of the Andalusians. Those close to him describe him as private and cautious. He is very much a family man, though he has been forced by his posting to live in Brussels while his wife, who is a partner in the British law firm Clifford Chance, works in Madrid. They shuttle back and forth at weekends. The couple, who met while at university, have two grown-up children. A one-time fan of Atlético Madrid, Dastis now supports their arch rivals Real Madrid, offering as an explanation that: “My son is a fan of Real.”\n\nHe is more discreet, however, about where his political sympathies might lie – a question that inevitably surfaces occasionally. His predecessor as Spanish permanent representative, Luis Planas Puchadas, (2010-11) was an unabashed Socialist politician. With Dastis, the career diplomat, it is clear that his career has prospered under centre-right administrations. He was secretary-general for European affairs in Spain’s foreign ministry in 2002-04. After a socialist government came to power, in March 2004 under José Luis Zapatero, Dastis was made ambassador to the Netherlands (2004-07), but thereafter his career seemed to dip. He was deputy director-general for EU institutional affairs in the state secretariat for the EU, a sub-section of the foreign ministry, until December 2010.\n\nIn January 2011, he was despatched to Brussels, but only with the rank of counsellor in the permanent representation to the EU, below Planas. But within a year, in November 2011, the centre-right Partido Popular won the Spanish general elections. Mariano Rajoy, the new prime minister, immediately promoted Dastis to the position of permanent representative. So now he is where he clearly loves to be. And, with delicious irony, he will be doubtless on hand to watch as changes to the voting rules in the Council of Ministers, that he had resisted in the Convention, will start, thanks to the Lisbon treaty, to take belated effect from 1 November. Ministers wanting an explanation should know that expertise is at hand, if required."
