Spain will hold the presidency of the European Union during the first half of next year.\n\nSpain's prime minister will begin his tour to the Baltic States in Estonia, where he has a scheduled meeting with PM Mart Laar.

Mutual good understanding prevails between Estonia and Spain, the relations of the two countries have steadily tightened. This April Estonia was visited by Spain's foreign minister Josep Piqué, now for the first time in the history of the two countries Spain's prime minister will be visiting Estonia.\n\nThough Estonia and Spain are located in opposite corners of Europe and look different at first sight, yet there are similar features and points of contact in the development of the two countries. Rather similar are the state economic reforms which primarily aim at avoiding state interference in the economy and increasing the role of the private sector. The catchwords are openness and liberalisation, preferred areas of development are IT and new technologies.\n\nInformation to the editors!\n\nDuring the visit of Spain's prime minister the following events may be covered:\n\nSeptember 11th\n\n2:30 p.m. Arrival at Tallinn airport (photo and TV-cameras)\n\n3:00 p.m. Meeting with PM Mart Laar at the Stenbock House (opening moments, photo and TV cameras)\n\n4:30 p.m. Joint press conference of the prime ministers of Estonia and Spain (at the press centre of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs)\n\nPhotographers and TV-operators interested in covering the events are kindly asked to show up at the VIP lounge of the airport 40 minutes and at the Stenbock House 15 minutes prior to the scheduled time, registering at the latest on Monday, September 11th at 2:00 p.m. at the press centre of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (call 6317 630 or e-mail [email protected]).\n\nAdmission to the press conference is is free to all journalists.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nPRESS SPOKESMAN'S OFFICE\n\nTel (372) 6317654"
