        "text": "Fernando Savater is a philosopher. He taught ethics for several years at a university in the Basque city of San Sebastián, near the French border, and in 1995 he and his wife moved to Madrid, where he is now on the faculty of the Universidad Complutense, one of the oldest and most distinguished schools in Spain. The Savaters are avid admirers of horror movies. Their apartment in a drab high-rise in downtown Madrid is cluttered with kitschy mementos, including little plastic models of Godzilla and Frankenstein’s monster and the Ichabod Crane character played by Johnny Depp in Tim Burton’s “Sleepy Hollow.”\n\nSavater is a short middle-aged man with a bushy beard that is turning gray. He wears glasses with large, salmoncolored frames, and when I met him at home one Sunday morning a few weeks ago he was dressed in slippers and a blue-and-white checked bathrobe. We sat and talked next to a painted wooden statue of Tintin. Savater smoked a pipe and told me about a trip he had taken to Tokyo recently to attend an important horse race. He has just finished a book that is a sort of social and political commentary on the Kentucky Derby, Ascot, Longchamps, the Dubai World Cup, and several other races. Since his daily routine in Madrid is severely constrained, the occasional trips abroad are important to him. He was still in his bathrobe that Sunday, he said, because he had locked himself in for the weekend. It embarrasses him to make his bodyguards work every day. His wife was away and he had left his tranquillizers in his office or somewhere, but he was doing without them until Monday.\n\nFernando Savater has been in what he calls “internal exile” for five years. He is designated for assassination by ETA (Euzkadi Ta Azkatasuna, “Basque Homeland and Freedom”), the separatist group that has been carrying out political murders since 1968. ETA’s attacks on its critics have been brutal, and some seven hundred and fifty people in Spain are under police protection similar to Savater’s. “You stop doing certain things,” he said, “like walking in the park or going out for a drink, because it doesn’t seem right to put your bodyguards’ lives in danger for such frivolous reasons.”\n\nSavater writes about Basque separatism and terrorism frequently in El País, and he appears on panels and on television. Last February, he helped found a loosely organized “civic-action group,” Basta Ya! (“Enough Already”). The group took its name from a slogan that arose spontaneously during demonstrations all over Spain in 1997, following the abduction of a young politician, Miguel Ángel Blanco. ETA announced that it would kill him within forty-eight hours unless the government agreed to let imprisoned members of ETA serve their sentences in facilities situated in the Basque provinces. The government refused to move the prisoners, and ETA murdered Miguel Ángel Blanco. Since then, there have been demonstrations after each ETA killing. “The purpose of Basta Ya!,” Savater said to me, “is not to mobilize in reaction to deaths, although our members attend the demonstrations, but to affirm support for democracy and the Spanish constitution.” In December, he represented Basta Ya! in Strasbourg, where the organization was awarded the Sakharov Prize for the defense of human rights by the European Parliament.\n\nSavater grew up in San Sebastián, a resort town that is the capital of Guipúzcoa, the easternmost of the three Basque Country provinces in Spain, but his mother was from Granada and his father from Madrid. “I don’t have Basque DNA,” he said to me. He was making an ironic reference to the late-nineteenth-century ideas of racial purity promulgated by the founders of Basque nationalism, but he was also thinking about an argument he got into with a member of the European Parliament at the dinner after the award ceremony in Strasbourg. She was interested in the case that is made for the biological separateness of the Basques, and she pointed out that they have the highest percentage of Type-O and Rh-negative blood in the world. He said that this didn’t matter: “In Europe, we resolve problems with elections, not blood tests.” Savater thinks that the Basques’ belief in an exclusive national identity, “with a little Guevara and Fanon thrown in,” fuels terrorism. “The Basque problem is not so complex,” he said. “It is a matter of a minority group trying to impose itself on a majority.”\n\nMaría San Gil also lives with bodyguards—four of them. Gil is the lieutenant mayor of San Sebastián and the president of the Partido Popular in Guipúzcoa. The P.P. is the party of José María Aznar, the conservative Spanish Prime Minister. ETA tried to kill Aznar with a car bomb in 1995, and after he became Prime Minister the following year he toughened the country’s anti-terrorism laws and officially refused to negotiate with ETA.\n\nI met María San Gil in Bilbao early in January. She had driven over from San Sebastián, which is about two hours away. The day before, she had participated in a ceremony at the tomb of a P.P. official who was killed by ETA in 1998. The occasion went as planned, but anonymous phone calls alerted the police to the fact that a bomb had been planted in the cemetery, although it had not gone off. Several hours later, five kilos of dynamite were found concealed under the dirt and flowers in an urn. The dynamite had been used to make a type of bomb that is often triggered by a telephone call. A cell phone is left next to the bomb, and the call sets it off. In this case, the police activated the bomb in a “controlled” explosion that destroyed more than three hundred tombs and, as El País reported, “also brought human remains to the surface, which were left lying all over the ground.”\n\nSan Gil is thirty-six, thin and attractive, with well-cut short brown hair. She is married and has two young children. Her father was Spanish and her mother Basque, and she was born and raised in San Sebastián. “I feel absolutely Basque, proudly Basque, but I also feel very Spanish,” she says. She got involved in politics five years ago, when she was working as a secretary for a P.P. official and witnessed his murder. I met her at P.P. headquarters after passing through several security checkpoints. “It’s pretty crazy here today,” one of her aides said apologetically. “Our nerves are all shot.” It turned out that during the ceremony the day before, San Gil had been leaning against the tomb where the bomb was stashed.\n\n”Knowing that I could have gone flying through the air . . .” San Gil said. “It’s different somehow from knowing that you are on ETA’s hit list.” Her hands were trembling, and she was chain-smoking Chesterfield Lights. “I’m a bit shaken. It’s like understanding that if you smoke you might get cancer and then suddenly you are told that you have it.” The cemetery bomb was the second attempt at mass murder by ETA in less than a month. On December 18th, a bomb was placed in an elevator in the journalism department of the university in Bilbao. That bomb, which was intended for a woman on the faculty, also failed to go off because of a technical glitch, but if it had it could have become the most lethal attack ever staged by ETA—worse even than the massacre of twenty-one people in a supermarket in Barcelona in 1987.\n\nI asked San Gil what she thought ETA was trying to achieve with the bomb in the cemetery. “It would have been a drama of huge dimensions,” she said. The father, two sisters, and the widow of the murdered politician who was being commemorated were there. “It would have been terrible. And it would have killed the leaders of the P.P. in Guipúzcoa province. The Party would have vanished. Almost all of us were there. ETA hates us. It’s as if they have rabies. They are fanatics. They have totally different values from the majority of people.”\n\nMaría San Gil believes that ETA is able to exist because of the complicity of more moderate Basque leaders, particularly those in the Partido Nacionalista Vasco, P.N.V.—the Basque Nationalist Party—which has been campaigning for Basque autonomy since 1895 and has led the regional government since 1980. Under the constitution written in 1978, three years after Franco’s death, the Basques were given the right to elect a president, the lehendakari; to have their own police force; and to teach their language, Euskera, in schools. In exchange, they accepted limitations on Basque nationalist aspirations, including the right to hold a referendum that might alter the status of the Basque provinces as integral parts of Spain.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, the Partido Nacionalista Vasco helped broker a ceasefire with ETA and entered into a political alliance with Euskal Herritarok, a coalition of extreme nationalist groups that include ETA’s “political wing.” When the ceasefire ended, late in 1999, and ETA began killing people again, the P.N.V. severed its ties with Euskal Herritarok, but it continues to insist that negotiations with ETA are necessary. The Aznar government disagrees. “The solution to the problem is, first, the political defeat of the P.N.V.,” María San Gil told me, “and then effective police action against the terrorists. I say no to dialogue with ETA, because they’ll arrive at the table with pistols in their hands. If they put down their guns, we can talk about whatever they like—the color of their cells, the thickness of the bars on their cells, the quality of the food—but until then nothing.”\n\nMany Basque nationalists believe that the Partido Popular’s position is rooted in the Spanish ultranationalism that characterized Franco’s regime. (Aznar is the son of a former Franco official and the protégé of a politician who was a minister under Franco.) Following Franco’s death, most Spaniards shared this impression of the P.P., but in 1996 Aznar managed to unseat the Socialists, who had held power since 1982. Aznar kept his government just to the right of center, and last year he won a landslide reëlection. He had to make concessions to Spain’s autonomous governments in return for votes, however, and he would like to counter this by increasing the P.P.’s power in traditional nationalist bastions like the Basque provinces. Elections are tentatively scheduled for later this year.\n\nEuzkadi, which is the Basques’ word for their homeland, encompasses four Spanish provinces and three adjacent districts in southwestern France. The autonomous region on the Spanish side has a population of two million, about sixty per cent of whom support the idea of greater self-determination. Very few of them support ETA’s violent campaign for sovereignty, but they have learned to coexist with the violence. This has become more difficult to do, however, because the rate of murders has increased recently and the targets have become bigger. Since January, 2000, after rearming and putting a new, more hard-line leadership in place, ETA has killed twenty-four people. Its latest strategy, the “socialization of suffering,” is intended to insure that all Basques, and not just the members of ETA (more than five hundred of whom are incarcerated), share the pain.\n\nOne day I arranged to meet a Basque friend at my hotel in Bilbao. He arrived later than expected, and explained that he had been delayed by an urgent summons from an old family friend, a businessman in his early seventies. He had gone to the man’s home and found him in a state of extreme anxiety. The man had just received a letter demanding a “contribution” of seven million pesetas, about forty thousand dollars, “on behalf of the struggle for the independence of the Basque people.” My friend said that hundreds of others—including low-rung professionals and small shopkeepers—have received similar letters from ETA in recent months. In August, a businessman who was a well-known proponent of Basque self-determination was killed because he hadn’t paid his war tax. ETA has also expanded its hit list to include journalists and academics. Last spring, a reporter for the right-wing daily paper El Mundo was murdered, and there have been attempts on the lives of half a dozen other journalists. The campaign to bring the war home to Euzkadi is helped along by youth gangs, the Kale Borroka, which swarm into the business districts of Bilbao and San Sebastián and other towns to vandalize banks, destroy mailboxes, burn cars, and do battle with the police.\n\nGuernica, the symbolic capital of Euzkadi, lies about twelve miles east of Bilbao on a narrow tidal estuary that extends inland from the Bay of Biscay. Guernica is not much larger now than it was on the day in April of 1937 when it was repeatedly bombed and strafed on Franco’s behalf by German bombers. More than a thousand civilians were killed, and most of the town was turned into a scorched ruin. It has been carefully restored, and still has narrow streets and houses of only one or two stories.\n\nThe Tree of Guernica, the emblem of Basque autonomy, survived the bombing. The original Tree, an oak that was several hundred years old, died in 1860, and the present Tree was planted then, on a knoll at the edge of town. For five hundred years, beginning in 1371, Spanish rulers came to stand under the Tree and confirm Euzkadi’s autonomous rights and privileges. (The special rights of the French Basques ended with the French Revolution.) These rights were documented in fueros, or charters. The fueros were rescinded in 1876, restored briefly in the thirties, before Franco came to power, and partially restored again after his death, when Spain’s new constitution was written.\n\nAn elegant limestone meetinghouse with colonnades and a domed roof was built next to the Tree in 1826, and various Basque nationalist groups gather there regularly. I was invited to a special meeting by Txema Montero, a prominent Basque lawyer in his late forties. Montero drove me to Guernica in his black BMW sedan. On the way, he said that Juan José Ibarretxe, the lehendakari of the Basque regional government and a leader of the Partido Nacionalista Vasco, planned to issue a call for peace. Unfortunately, both the Partido Popular and ETA’s political ally, Euskal Herritarok, were boycotting the meeting. Aznar had condemned it as a Basque-nationalist propaganda exercise, and ETA viewed it as a gesture of appeasement. “Mao said that you had to swim like a fish in the water,” Montero said, “and the Spaniards believe that they must drain the water to finish off the fish. Nationalism is the water, and the fish is ETA.”\n\nIn the mid-nineteen-eighties, Txema Montero represented ETA in secret peace talks in Algiers with the Socialist government of Felipe González. Montero says that they had reached a deal, but then the government stalled and ETA withdrew from the talks. Around the same time, it became widely known that the death squads in the “dirty war” being waged against the Basques were made up of Spanish policemen and French mercenaries operating on the orders of senior security officials in the González administration. Montero remained closely allied with ETA until 1992, when he was publicly repudiated for writing an article condemning the group’s use of violence.\n\nMontero has a private law practice now, and a position at a think tank funded by the Partido Nacionalista Vasco. “I don’t know exactly what it means today to be a Basque,” he said to me. “But I do know that the majority of the Basque people want more political power. So why shouldn’t we be allowed, in some future election, to vote on whether or not to have a referendum?” He thinks the answer is, in part, that the Aznar government fears that a referendum on Basque self-determination would lead to similar demands from other autonomous regions, like Catalonia and Galicia.\n\nWe parked and walked to the meetinghouse, where a large group of men and women—including many who were old enough to remember the bombing of Guernica—stood watching the guests arrive. Several of them called out to Txema Montero in Euskera, and he waved. The lehendakari—a man in his mid-forties with very white skin, intense brown eyes, and a balding pate, like that of a Capuchin monk—was standing next to the venerable Tree, bathed in light from the lamps of a TV crew. Inside the hall, five rows of red seats wound steeply around an oval amphitheatre. There were stained-glass windows at the base of the dome. On the walls, several gilt-framed paintings of feudal lords from Vizcaya, the province in which Guernica is situated, hung with their oaths of allegiance written in large Gothic letters on plaques beneath them.\n\nEveryone stood and clapped when the lehendakari walked in and took his place at a wooden podium in front of two ornate candelabras and a tapestry of the Tree of Guernica. He said a few words of welcome in Spanish and then paused. The speech of reconciliation he had prepared had been overtaken by events. It was his sad duty, he said, to announce that just a few hours earlier ETA had murdered a young traffic policeman in Barcelona.\n\nThe lehendakari asked for five minutes of silence, during which I peered around at the crowd. People were chewing their lips and frowning, and one woman seemed about to cry. Then the lehendakari gave his speech, first in Spanish and then in Euskera. “It isn’t worth it to keep on living like this,” he said at one point.\n\nETA does not recruit its members from a disenfranchised indigenous underclass like the one that feeds the I.R.A. in Northern Ireland. It is made up largely of the offspring of middle-class families from one of the most prosperous regions of Spain. The Basque government has invested heavily in public services, and the Basques are among the best-educated people in the Iberian Peninsula. The level of unemployment is low, and pro-business policies have encouraged a wide range of multinational companies, such as Rolls-Royce, G.E., Daewoo, and Ericsson, to establish plants in the region.\n\nI went for a drive in the countryside outside Bilbao one day with a Basque friend, Alberto Letona, who works as a producer for a television station owned by the regional government. We drove out of town through the working-class neighborhoods clustered along the west bank of the Nervión River, which bisects the city on its way to the Bay of Biscay. Smoke-stained apartment buildings and terraced cottages abut abandoned or nearly abandoned steel mills, docks, and shipyards—vestiges of the old industrial economy. Downtown, to the south, wide brick sidewalks are flanked by finde-siècle stone buildings with distinctive glass-fronted balconies. The main shopping street has trendy boutiques, bookshops, cafés, and a Marks & Spencer department store. Most of the curving glass entrances to the city’s new subway system, which were designed by Norman Foster, are in this area. El Goog, which is how the locals refer to Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim Museum building, glistens near one of the main bridges, surrounded by cranes at the many construction sites in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Basque Country is wet and green, like Ireland. Rainclouds are constantly obscuring the small patches of blue sky, and on this day a leaden cloud cover moved over us permanently. On a misty green plateau high above the town, craters left by open-faced iron mines—Bilbao’s first industry—were covered by scrub and tall grass. A few long-haired Basque ponies roamed here and there. In the plaza at Gallarta, the village where Dolores Ibarruri, La Pasionaria, was born, two young teachers from Bilbao were talking to a group of high-school students in bright-colored parkas and sneakers who had come from the city on a field trip. Alberto explained that they were being given a lecture on the history of the area, and about life in the mines. The teachers were speaking in Euskera, which is guttural and clicky and full of “X”s. It was totally incomprehensible to me, as it is to most outsiders, including Spaniards.\n\nEuskera is not an Indo-European language and bears no relation to any other known tongue. It seems to have originated among the primitive Basques and not to have been tainted by the languages of adjacent peoples. During much of Franco’s tenure, it was against the law to speak Euskera in public or to teach it, but after he died and the regional government was established, Euskera-only schools, ikastolak, were officially recognized. Many Spaniards and non-nationalist Basques see the ikastolak as breeding grounds for Basque extremism. Alberto, who describes himself as a moderate Basque nationalist, said that he and his friends resented the Spanish campaign against Euskera. “I’m happy to live within a federal Spain,” he said, “although with more concessions to Basque autonomy. But the increasingly anti-Basque sentiments coming out of Madrid make me want to just go my own way and to hell with them.”\n\nWe drove back to the east side of the river and passed through the neighborhoods of Las Arenas and Neguri, where Bilbao’s wealthy families settled in the heyday of the Industrial Revolution. Their grand nineteenth-century mansions with gated gardens stand next to new, upscale apartment buildings. After an hour or so, we arrived in Bermeo, an old whaling town in a cove surrounded by steep, forested hills. Most of its small fleet of fishing trawlers—a couple of dozen red, green, and blue wooden boats with low gunwales and high, perky, ocean-going prows—were sitting at anchor in the stone harbor. A large brick building next to the harbor housed a bar and an indoor court for pelota, the handball game invented by the Basques. Two young men with the physiques of rugby players were practicing for a tournament. An older man wearing a cloth cap stood to one side watching them. He began speaking in Euskera, but for my sake switched to Spanish. One of the players was his son, he said, the past pelota champion of the entire Basque country. This was the original Basque pelota, the man explained, the most difficult kind, played without gloves, just tape on the hands. We watched as the two younger men, who were sweating heavily, took their turns catching the ball—a hard thing the size of a baseball—and then whacking it against the pockmarked brick wall at the far end of the court.\n\nAt the small restaurant where we went for lunch, everyone spoke Euskera. A pamphlet denouncing human-rights abuses committed against ETA prisoners lay on the table. There were grainy black-and-white photographs of torture victims, as well as pictures of Basques who had been killed by the government-sponsored death squads in the nineteen-eighties. One gruesome photograph that caught my eye showed a woman lying prone, evidently dead, with her head in a barbed-wire fence. I mentioned to Alberto that it had probably been taken during the Spanish Civil War. “I guess the idea is to show the long history of abuses by Spain,” he said. After lunch, as we walked through the narrow streets to the car, Alberto translated the words on a large banner that was hanging from the town hall. “Euskal Presoak—Euskal Herrira” was written in red letters: “Bring the Prisoners Home to the Basque Country.” As we walked on, I saw that there were dozens of similar banners hanging from balconies. “Bermeo is known as a very nationalistic town,”Alberto said.\n\nWe left the coast and drove inland, into the hills. After getting lost on a grid of new roads that took us through a subdivision of summer chalets, we found the track leading to the farmhouse, or caserío, that had been owned by Alberto’s family for most of the twentieth century. The caserío is a metaphor for the Basque homeland, and Alberto’s family had sold theirs in the late seventies, when his aged relatives moved to apartments in Bilbao. It was, I could see, typical—a large two-story building with ivory-colored limestone walls and a red-tiled roof. It sat alone in a sloping field under a small forested hill. Alberto walked onto the property and stood with his back to me. “All of that was my grandfather’s,” he said. “And that was where my grandmother used to plant potatoes.” After several minutes like this, he sighed and walked back to the car. As we drove away, he said that recently he had been looking for an old caserío to buy for his own family, but the prices were too high. He had been shown a ruined one that cost three hundred thousand dollars.\n\nJust as the afternoon light began to fade, we broke through a densely forested area and began descending into a small cove on the bay. Filling the space where the beach used to be was a rectangular concrete structure the size of a football field. It had two squat funnels on its roof, and a mess of high-tension lines and pylons stretched away from it inland. There was old construction debris on the roadside around us, and some rusting loops of barbed wire. This was the Lemoniz nuclear power plant, Alberto said. Franco had intended it to be the first of several such installations in the Basque Country, but there were large-scale protests against it. ETA mounted attacks on the plant, and in 1978 two workers were killed by a bomb. Three years later, ETA kidnapped and murdered an engineer there, and the government finally decided to halt construction. Alberto said that ETA’s opposition to the Lemoniz nuclear facility was one of its most effective and popular operations.\n\nETA is estimated to have about two hundred active members today—people who carry out the bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations—and a support network of perhaps two thousand collaborators who provide transportation, rent safe houses, and run errands. The members, who have noms de guerre like Mobutu, Qaddafi, and Tintin, usually work in three-person cells that are part of regional “commands.” The commands communicate with the ETA leadership, a collective that is believed to be based in France and Switzerland, via a complicated system in which messages are relayed through a number of people. ETA’s communiqués to the public often appear first in a Bilbao daily newspaper, Gara, which is published in Euskera and Spanish.\n\nETA describes itself as being aligned with other “liberation struggles,” like the Polisario Front’s war for the independence of Moroccan-held Western Sahara and the efforts of the stateless Turkish Kurds to gain a homeland. In the Bilbao office of Euskal Herritarok, the legal, aboveground party that speaks for ETA, there are posters of Che Guevara, the Zapatistas’ Subcomandante Marcos, and the late Nicaraguan revolutionary Augusto César Sandino. During the nineteen-eighties, some ETA members volunteered for duty in Latin America’s Marxist guerrilla insurgencies, but they were rarely noticed by journalists or other outsiders. I met a couple of them in 1991, when I was staying with the Fuerzas Populares de Liberación in El Salvador. Olga, a former factory worker from Bilbao, spent her mornings under a large tree with a couple of assistants, making political leaflets and posters. A burly man I knew as Alberto oversaw the guerrillas’ explosives factory, a crude bivouac where a half-dozen young, battle-mutilated men made land mines and booby traps they called quitapiés and vuela-huevos (“foot-takers” and “ball-busters”).\n\nETA’s longest-lasting bonds have been with the I.R.A., and the ceasefire called in 1998 was an imitation of the Irish negotiations that had led to the accords signed at Stormont earlier that year. But the Basques did not enjoy the clout of a powerful international intermediary like President Clinton to broker their talks with Madrid. During the ceasefire, in fact, Prime Minister Aznar said that he did not want third parties involved, and went so far as to ask other countries to coöperate more fully with the Spanish police in apprehending ETA fugitives. In the past, ETA members have been granted sanctuary as political refugees in Algeria, Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and even France. There have been a rash of extraditions of ETA fugitives recently, although Castro continues to be friendly. At the Ibero-American Summit in Panama last year, he refused to sign a document condemning ETA.\n\nIn mid-January, two of the principal members of ETA’s Barcelona command, which had killed four people since September, including Ernest Lluch, a former Spanish health minister, were stopped late one night by the police because their car had a crooked license plate and one of the doors was ajar. A Basque man in his late thirties was driving and a woman in her twenties was in the back seat, holding a large cooking pot (later found to be full of explosives). While the policemen were questioning the driver, they noticed that he had a gun, and they arrested him and his companion. The two are now in custody, and a great deal of evidence indicates that they were involved in the murder of the policeman in Barcelona in December, the day the Basque nationalist organizations met in Guernica. A third member of their cell, a young Catalan who is the son of a senior Barcelona police officer, was arrested a few weeks ago.\n\nErnest Lluch, ETA’s most prominent victim, had been involved in efforts to promote negotiations between Spanish politicians and Basque nationalists. He was killed, ETA explained in a recent communiqué, because he had been trying to “play good cop” in a political game “aimed at insuring the Basque Country’s dismemberment and continued domination by Spain.” Lluch’s murder was widely condemned, and there were many demonstrations against it.\n\nKepa Aulestia, a former member of ETA who spent two years in prison during the Franco years and has since become a writer for an anti-nationalist Basque newspaper, told me that he feels guilty about his generation’s failure to control the younger ideologues who now make up ETA. “There was some justification when the violence was directed against Franco,” he said. “But the violence now sometimes seems to take place for its own sake. And the most disquieting thing is the utter naturalness with which the young people utilize it, without even a trace of pity.”\n\nKepa Aulestia grew up in a tiny rural village where a dialect of Euskera was spoken. He and his two brothers joined ETA in the seventies, and his eldest brother, who became something of a legend in the organization, trained a number of ETA volunteers who went on to make names for themselves. Rather ruefully, Aulestia mentioned that one of them was Arnaldo Otegi, who is now the head of Euskal Herritarok. “Otegi joined ETA when most of the rest of us left it,” Aulestia said.\n\nETA’s base of support is estimated at around a hundred and eighty thousand people, close to ten per cent of the Basque population, as reflected in the number of votes received by Euskal Herritarok’s candidates in municipal and provincial elections in Euzkadi. The headquarters of Euskal Herritarok are on the ground floor of a modern block of offices and apartments in San Sebastián, not far from the university where Fernando Savater used to teach ethics. When I went to visit, a couple of bicycles were leaning against the wall outside the glass front door. A young secretary buzzed me into a room laid out in a typical open-plan corporate manner, with orange-colored wall partitions separating desks in the middle and a line of glassed-in cubicles along the sides. There was a sitting area with couches and tables covered with issues of the party’s magazine.\n\nArnaldo Otegi, a pleasant-looking man with short black hair, occupies one of the cubicles. He was wearing black jeans and a black T-shirt, and he had an emerald stud in his left earlobe. Otegi has a reputation for being media-savvy. During the ceasefire that was declared in the fall of 1998, he appeared before the press so often that he was referred to as “the Basque Gerry Adams.” Before he became the party’s spokesman, though, Otegi was one of ETA’s “hard men,” and he spent a number of years in prison for terrorist offenses.\n\nI asked Otegi what he and his colleagues in ETA were hoping to achieve. “We are proposing a question about political sovereignty,” he replied. “The imposition of a foreign culture is what impels the conflict, and the armed struggle as well.” As an example of what he meant, Otegi spoke of the need for a Basque educational system without Spanish interference. “We have only a forty-per-cent say over what our children learn in school; the Spanish state imposes the rest. We must create an educational system that conserves our cultural values.” There must be a public referendum in which the status of the Basque homeland could be decided, Otegi said. But first it was necessary to decide who is a Basque and who isn’t. “We say that anyone who lives in the Basque country and works here and wants to be a Basque, and who agrees to the principle of Basque self-determination, is a Basque.” In the future, he said, the party hoped to issue Basque identity cards. “We’re just different,” he said. “What are we supposed to do? . . . Some people say that we are the last indigenous people of Europe. In that light, the need to rescue Basque culture from extinction can be compared with the need to save the Amazon forest.”\n\nOn my last trip to Bilbao, I had a drink with Bernardo Atxaga, a Basque novelist. Atxaga is a rumpled, impish man of fifty with wild curly hair. He was worried about a close friend, Mikel Zuluaga, a writer and the owner of a travel bookstore in Bilbao. Zuluaga has been charged with belonging to ETA and has been imprisoned since November. Atxaga said that although his friend is a fervent believer in Basque independence, he is well known for his pacifism. Atxaga believes Zuluaga was arrested because he published a rather anarchistic personal manifesto last year that called for a campaign of nonviolent civil disobedience to bring about the creation of a Basque state. Atxaga describes Zuluaga’s manifesto as an effort to come up with an alternative to “the politicization of Basque cultural identity.”\n\n”I don’t mind living within Spain,” Atxaga said. “It has a more appropriate scale for a country than Euzkadi does. But it’s difficult to stomach so many attacks on our culture. We have a minority group of integristas, fundamentalists, on the inside, and then on the outside we have a state that wants to destroy everything the minority stands for. Most of us are stuck in the middle, and we no longer know which way to turn.”\n\nOn January 19th, the Aznar government announced that it was giving a posthumous medal to Melitón Manzanas, the head of a political-intelligence police unit in San Sebastián during the Franco regime. Manzanas had collaborated with the Gestapo and had helped capture Jews fleeing across the border into Spain from Occupied France. He was also responsible for the torture of hundreds of Basques, and in 1968 ETA assassinated him. He was the group’s first victim. Basque officials protested that the medal was an insulting gesture of approval for someone who had persecuted their people.\n\nOn January 26th, a cook who worked at the naval headquarters in San Sebastián was killed by a car bomb. ETA didn’t officially claim responsibility for the killing (it usually waits weeks or months to do so), but it was almost certainly an ETA attack, the first successful one of the new year. ♦"
