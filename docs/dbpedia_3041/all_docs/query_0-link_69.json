        "text": "Auteur Watch - Thomas E. Ikimi\n\nAh, these young punks. They don't know what directing's all about. But this Thomas Ikimi seems to have a good head on his shoulders... he is a he, right? I think so. His IMDb bio seems to declare it. But you know, gender roles are more fluid these days. And a tomboy's still a girl, right?\n\nOh, right. Guess I should say a little more. Well, I'll give you some advice: stop flooding Idris Elba's answering service with messages! He's not taking anyone's calls anymore. Yes, he's got all kinds of people already who have to \"remember him when.\" Yeah, winning the lottery's a bitch."
