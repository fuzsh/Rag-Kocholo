        "text": "Matthew McConaughey/Buster Moon\n\nBuster Moon the koala (voiced by Matthew McConaughey) has the big idea to put on a talent show, but a slight mix-up means that the prize goes from his intended $1,000 to a grand total of $100,000. McConaughey, who also voiced a character in this year's Kubo and the Two Strings, will next be seen in Gold and The Dark Tower opposite Idris Elba.\n\nNick Kroll/Gunter\n\nNick Kroll voices the star of the film's trailers, Gunter the pig, who sings proudly onstage clad in a glittery tracksuit. Kroll's list of credits this year run the gamut from the animated Sausage Party (as the voice of Douche) to the interracial marriage drama Loving to the dramedy My Blind Brother.\n\nTori Kelly/Meena\n\nThe painfully shy elephant who ends up working as a stagehand because she is too scared to sing is voiced by Tori Kelly, making her film debut. Kelly's album, Unbreakable Smile, dropped in 2015.\n\nScarlett Johansson/Ash\n\nThe porcupine punk, Ash, is voiced by Scarlett Johansson, who was in two of 2016's biggest movies, The Jungle Book and Captain America: Civil War, and next appears in Ghost in the Shell, which is set to premiere in March.\n\nReese Witherspoon/Rosita\n\nReese Witherspoon voices the character of Rosita, a put-upon pig mother of 25 who wants to follow her dreams. Witherspoon will next star as Mrs. Whatsit in Ava Du Vernay's star-studded A Wrinkle in Time, as well as in HBO's limited series Big Little Lies.\n\nNick Offerman/Norman\n\nNick Offerman's Norman, husband of Rosita (Reese Witherspoon), has ignored his wife's talents for long enough. She tries to get some much-needed attention at home, while he largely sleeps on the sofa. Offerman, best known as Ron Swanson on Parks and Recreation, was also seen this year on FX's Fargo and in the film The Founder.\n\nSeth MacFarlane/Mike\n\nThe Family Guy creator appears in Sing as the hustling mouse known as Mike, who boldly proclaims that he's not in the singing competition for fun, he's \"here to win.\" In 2017, Seth MacFarlane is set to appear in Logan Lucky alongside Adam Driver, Sebastian Stan, Channing Tatum and Katie Holmes.\n\nJohn C. Reilly/Eddie\n\nWreck-It Ralph's very own John C. Reilly voices the Sing character of Eddie, Buster's sheep friend, who at one point tries to convince his buddy to move on from his talent show idea. O'Reilly will be seen next in Kong: Skull Island before taking on the Sherlock Holmes tale with his pal Will Ferrell in Holmes and Watson, and then a sequel to Wreck-It Ralph coming in 2018.\n\nTaron Egerton/Johnny\n\nKingsman's Taron Egerton, who has signed on to play Robin Hood in the upcoming origin story, voices the Sing character of Johnny the teenage gorilla, who wants nothing more than to be a singer (and not be a part of his father's gang).\n\nBeck Bennett/Lance\n\nSaturday Night Live's Beck Bennett voices the character of Lance, former boyfriend of porcupine Ash (Scarlett Johansson). Next up for the comedian is the Disney XD reboot of DuckTales, in which he voices Launchpad McQuack.\n\nLeslie Jones and Jay Pharoah/Meena's Mother and Meena's Grandfather\n\nAdding to the SNL contingency on the Sing cast are Leslie Jones and Jay Pharoah, who play mother and grandfather, respectively, to Meena (Tori Kelly), the stage-fright-prone elephant who needs some encouragement to put herself out there."
