        "text": "Sesame Street Live! is a series of live stage shows occurring between February and November 2020. The first show took place at Madison Square Garden in New York City from Feb. 18-19, the second show was at Staples Center in Los Angeles from Apr. 14-15, the third was at Amway Center in Orlando from Jun. 10-11, the fourth at Wembley Arena in London from Jul. 20-21, the fifth at Rogers Centre in Toronto from Sept. 16-17, and the last show at International Convention Centre Sydney from Nov. 12-13.\n\nErnie and Bert are the hosts of a two-hour variety show (directed by Prairie Dawn with assistant Trevor Monster, who debuts in this show) featuring their Sesame Street friends (Elmo, Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Grover, Abby Cadabby, Oscar the Grouch and more) and presenting new performances of classic Sesame Street songs and sketches, as well as covers of musical classics such as \"Send in the Clowns\", \"Clap for the Wolfman\", and \"Copacabana\". Unlike other Sesame Street live shows, these shows utilized the official puppets used on the show itself rather than walk-around costume versions. The puppeteers, clad all in black, are exposed to the audience, while two large screens loom over both sides of the stage, both of which frame only the Muppet characters (however, the performers reveal themselves during the curtain call). Unusual for a live show, the Muppet performers both spoke and sang live, making the experience slightly different for each performance.\n\nIn addition, celebrities make cameos throughout the show (who vary from show to show), including John Oliver, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, James Corden, Seth Meyers, Tom Bergeron, Paul Williams, Michael Buble, Randy Rainbow, Gloria Estefan, LeVar Burton, Billie Eilish, Celine Dion, Sia, Lloyd Ahlquist and Peter Shukoff, Ryan Reynolds (reprising his role as Deadpool), ALF (performed by Paul Fusco), and Mark Hamill as the voice of the Joker.\n\nThe shows were produced by Sesame Workshop, the Jim Henson Company, HIT Entertainment, Sony Wonder, and Scholastic Media (a rare instance of a Scholastic-produced project that isn't a media adaptation of their books); the current Sesame Workshop logo, the 2002 Jim Henson Home Entertainment logo (with \"Home Entertainment\" replaced with \"The Jim Henson Company\"), the 2001 HIT Entertainment logo, the 1995 Sony Wonder logo (an animated version of the widescreen variant as seen in The Swan Princess: A Royal Family Tale), and the 2003 Scholastic logo are all seen during the beginning of each show, both live and on video. The MSG, Staples Center, and Amway Center shows aired on local PBS stations (WNET, KCET, and WUCF-TV), as well as on PBS Kids and Universal Kids, on Feb. 18, 2021, and on HBO, Cartoon Network and Boomerang in the days that followed. The Wembley Arena, Rogers Centre, and ICC Sydney shows aired on BBC and CBeebies, YTV and Treehouse TV, and ABC and ABC Kids in Australia, respectively, throughout April 2021.\n\nAll six shows received positive reviews from critics and audiences. Reviewing the Madison Square Garden performances, The New York Times lauded Sesame Street Live! as \"a children's concert with something to please all ages.\" The Los Angeles Times spoke of the Staples Center shows, \"Big Bird, Elmo and friends are as popular as ever!\", while the Wembley Arena shows were praised by The Sun as \"a hilarious blast from the most famous puppets on television.\"\n\nFilmed versions of the first two shows were released on DVD, Blu-ray and digital download by Shout! Factory (the MSG show) and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (the Staples show) in the United States and Canada in May 2021, each complete with bonus material, including behind-the-scenes/rehearsal footage, songs cut from the show, bios on the Muppet characters and their performers (read aloud by Trevor Monster), a trivia quiz game, a photo gallery, a sing-along feature, pop-up facts, trailers for other titles from their respective distributors, the bonus video Elmopalooza, and more. The Wembley Arena show received a Region 2 release by BBC DVD in June, followed by the Rogers Centre version from Corus Kids in July and the ICC Sydney version from ABC Kids Australia in August; both have similar bonus features as their U.S. counterparts. Every show from the tour (including an Amway Center performance) was released on the HBO Max streaming service in early September 2021, as well as on the Noggin mobile streaming app.\n\nAct I[]\n\nTV and video releases start off with the Sesame Street Muppets arriving on a tour bus driven by Cookie Monster as an upbeat song plays in the background. For example, the MSG show starts off with \"Celebration\", while the Staples Center show begins with \"Party Like It's 1999\".\n\nOscar the Grouch opens the show by singing the \"Grouch Anthem\" with some other Grouches. (This song was performed at Madison Square Garden, Staples Center and Amway Center)\n\nA Muppet version of Queen Elizabeth II (performed by Louise Gold) tries to find her seat before the show starts. (This was only shown at Wembley Arena)\n\nAn Anything Muppet Mountie (performed by Eric Jacobson) leads the audience in singing \"O, Canada\". (This song was only performed at Rogers Centre)\n\nA Muppet kangaroo named Keeshan (performed by Matt Vogel) goes over a few safety instructions for the audience before the show starts. (This was only shown at ICC Sydney)\n\nTrevor Monster, Prairie Dawn, Ernie, Bert, Cookie Monster, Big Bird, Count von Count, and Elmo sing a medley comprised of: \"Somebody Come and Play\", \"Sesame Street Theme\", \"Rubber Duckie\", \"Doin' the Pigeon\", \"C is for Cookie\", \"ABC-DEF-GHI\", \"Song of the Count\", \"Elmo's Song\" and \"Welcome!\" (joined during the last song by Telly Monster and Baby Bear)\n\nErnie explains the history of Sesame Street, including its co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney, the influence of Jim Henson and his Muppets, the importance of music on the show, and the topics it has tackled over the years, from healthy habits and social skills to emergencies and death. Telly Monster interrupts Ernie in the MSG show, frantically searching for the bathroom (not to go, but to search for his hairbrush), where Ernie tells him is at the end of the hall leading to the stage to the right. He is interrupted by Grover in the Staples Center show, who explains that he missed the tour bus to the arena, so a \"pretty limo driver\" named Marissa (played by Colleen Smith) drove him instead. Grover asks Marissa to drive him around L.A., since he won't be needed in the show for a while. In response, she drags him away by his nose. In the Amway Center show, Abby Cadabby interrupts Ernie by magically appearing and disappearing constantly to mess with him. When asked why she is doing this, Abby confesses that she wanted to play hide-and-seek with him.\n\nErnie spotlights the many co-productions of Sesame Street from around the world, including Mexico, Germany, the Netherlands, Kuwait, Israel, Egypt, India, Spain, France, Brazil, China, Japan, Bangladesh, Russia, South Africa, Canada, Indonesia, Palestine, Portugal, Norway, Turkey, Poland, Northern Ireland, and Britain (The Furchester Hotel). He and Bert originally scheduled a parade of international Muppets, but according to Prairie Dawn (who mentions that her shoes are being shined and her socks are \"this week's dirty laundry\"), no one from the international streets could make it, citing time concerns and travel costs. Ernie wonders if they could instead stage a salute to professional wrestling (MSG), comic books (Staples), American theme parks (Amway), children's television characters (Wembley), the animal kingdom (Rogers), and the nations of the world (ICC Sydney), but the idea is shut down by Prairie.\n\nA Lavender AM caricature of Michael Jackson lip-syncs to Jackson's \"The Way You Make Me Feel\", with backup by three Anything Muppet singers.\n\nOscar sings \"I Love Trash\", while other Grouches present the trash mentioned in the song. Grundgetta, Slimey the Worm, a rebuilt Bruno the Trashman, Oscar's mother, Irvine, Fluffy, Lassie, Iago, Spot, and Preposterous also make appearances. At the song's end, Oscar tries to feed his 13-month-old newspaper with fish filling to a Muppet raccoon (a rebuilt replica of a raccoon puppet first used on The Muppet Show), animals that Oscar calls \"a Grouch's best friend\", who happily chows down...on everything in Oscar's trash can.\n\nElmo leads Trevor Monster (and the audience) in a performance of \"Sing After Me\". For performances where Ryan Dillon performed Elmo, Trevor was operated on-stage by another puppeteer, lip-synching to Dillon's live vocals.\n\nThe Two-Headed Monster spells out a word and demonstrates its meaning (DANCE at MSG, BOOM at Staples, SWIM at Amway, RUN at Wembley, DUCK at Rogers, and FLY at ICC Sydney).\n\nZoe leads Julia and some monsters, and the audience, in a performance of \"A Very Simple Dance\". Zoe and Julia end up exhausted after the song.\n\nErnie, clad in his pajamas, sings and tap dances to \"Dance Myself to Sleep\" with some Muppet sheep while playing his bugle, even inviting Abby Cadabby and Prairie Dawn to dance with him. Abby is instantly eager to join in, while Prairie is initially reluctant, but after Ernie offers her dancing advice (\"Let your feet feel the beat and your body does the rest.\"), she and Abby get so caught up in tap dancing that they continue even after Ernie heads for bed (\"This is so much fun, I don't think I'll ever fall asleep!\" exclaims Prairie). The scene was executed in front of a black background, with nine puppeteers, three for each Muppet, dressed all in black and invisible to the audience.\n\nIn Ernie's dream, he sings \"I Don't Want to Live on the Moon\" with Christopher Cerf (MSG), Michael Buble (Staples), Randy Rainbow (Amway), Billie Eilish (Wembley), Celine Dion (Rogers), and Sia (ICC Sydney) (but only during opening performances; for subsequent and matinee performances, Ernie would sing alone or with another Sesame Street character, i.e. Abby Cadabby, Elmo, Big Bird, or Grover). Several Muppets also make appearances, including Slimey (referencing a story arc from the show's 29th season in which Slimey was one of five worms to fly to the Moon), a Martian, Wanda Cousteau, some Muppet fish, a Muppet shark, a Muppet octopus, a Muppet oyster, a Muppet clam, Chicago the Lion, Herb the Dinosaur, Shivers the Penguin, some Muppet penguins, Wolfgang the Seal, Old MacDonald, some Muppet sheep, Kathleen the Cow, Gladys the Cow, Alfred Duck, Mumford's duck, Buster the Horse, Fred the Wonder Horse, some Muppet chickens, some Muppet pigeons, some Muppet dogs, Little Murray Sparkles, Chip and Dip, and Iago the Donkey. The moonbeam that Ernie dances on during the song was achieved through an overhead light projection, and the shooting star that he wishes to return home on was animated on one of the CGI environments featured through the song.\n\nMurray Monster makes his triumphant return, and plays \"One of These Things\" (changed to \"Three of These Things\" in the Staples Center, Amway Center, and Wembley Arena shows) with his old friend Ovejita the lamb, using scissors, a sheet of paper, a bottle of glue, and a rock (MSG); Murray, Ovejita, and two other monsters (Staples); a cat, a dog, a mouse, and a tiger (Amway); a towel, a rubber duck, a bar of soap, and a pillow (Wembley); a kiwi, a pineapple, a plum, and a jellybean (Rogers); and a baseball, a basketball, a golf ball, a tennis ball, and an American football (ICC Sydney).\n\nIn Cookie Monster's Foodie Truck, Cookie Monster and Chef Gonger prepare beef Stroganoff (MSG), a strawberry cheesecake (Staples), watermelon gazpacho (Amway), Welsh rarebit (Wembley), jelly doughnuts (Rogers), and ants on a log (ICC Sydney). However, the monsters run out of sour cream, strawberries, bell peppers, cheddar cheese, raspberry jam, and raisins respectively, so they drive off in their Foodie Truck to get more of the missing ingredient (and learn about where those foods come from).\n\nErnie introduces the audience to \"the bathtime boogie that's sweeping the nation\" as he invites them to \"Do De Rubber Duck\", sung by Zoe instead of Ernie himself, who originally sang the song (though he does provide duckie squeaks), in a giant bathtub that covers the whole stage. She's soon joined by Telly, Oscar, Abby (singing Kermit the Frog's verse from the original version), the Count, Grover (singing Biff's verse), Guy Smiley, Gladys the Cow, and Hoots the Owl. While not getting verses, Elmo, Rosita, Baby Bear, Rudy, and Julia also appear in the bathtub. As the singers sing the chorus over and over, Prairie Dawn, feeling the \"bathtub bonanza\" has gone on long enough, uses a giant vaudeville cane and the moving services of Cookie Monster and Herry Monster to haul the tub and singers off-stage. Ernie and Bert chase after the tub, telling Prairie not to scratch it with the cane.\n\nAfter a spirited introduction from Mr. Snuffleupagus, The Oinker Sisters perform \"A New Way to Walk\".\n\nBig Bird, in desperate search of Barkley, sings \"Has Anybody Seen My Dog?\". Grover happens by the worried Big Bird and offers to help him find the missing dog. Grover proves to be less than helpful, though; he instead finds a cat, a frog, a lamb, a chicken, and a wolf (MSG), a duck, a pig, a cow, a goat, and an alligator (Staples), a squirrel, a horse, a monkey, a turkey, and a bear (Amway), a fish, a porcupine, a turtle, a spider, and an elephant (Wembley), a raccoon, a donkey, a snake, a penguin, and a lion (Rogers), a mouse, a camel, a kangaroo, a gorilla, and a rabbit (ICC Sydney). Eventually, both Big Bird and Grover start crying, thinking the dog's gone forever. Suddenly, Barkley comes running onto the stage, much to Big Bird's delight and Grover's confusion (\"Where did he come from?\").\n\nAccompanied by four AM Monsters on piano, guitar, saxophone, and flute, Trevor Monster sings \"Bein' Green\". Before the song, he lampshades the oddity of a yellow monster singing a song about the color green, lamenting that he's the wrong color before singing (\"Oscar didn't want to sing it, so...\") and changing one of the final lyrics from \"I'm green, and it'll do fine\" to \"If I were green, it would do fine\".\n\nSeven Honkers dance and honk to \"Honk Around the Clock\", until they destroy the clock offstage.\n\nRosita (wearing a Carmen Miranda-inspired hat, a glittery dress that stretches to her legs, and blue fabric attached to her fur, similar to her pre-2004 wings) sings \"Copacabana\" with The Oinker Sisters as backup singers, and Anything Muppets taking on the roles of Lola (Lavender), Tony (Green) and Rico (Pumpkin). The song tells the story of Lola, the star attraction at the legendary Copacabana nightclub, who falls in love with the bartender, Tony. One night, a man named Rico walks in and attempts to woo the showgirl to his side; however, Rico's attempt to have his way with Lola earns Tony's wrath, resulting in a bar room brawl that ends with Tony getting shot dead and Rico fleeing the scene. Years later, the club has been transformed into a disco; all that remains of the Copa's former identity is the presence of Lola (who is aging like milk, drunk out of her mind and unable to accept the loss of her love). Copacabana nightclub and disco patrons include Hoots the Owl, Guy Smiley, Mr. Johnson, Louie, Mae, Freddy, Maggie Cadabby, Roosevelt Franklin, Prairie Dawn, Betty Lou, Mama Bear, Papa Bear, Humphrey, Ingrid, Leo the Party Monster, Sherlock Hemlock, Forgetful Jones, The Amazing Mumford, Polly Darton, Lefty the Salesman, Don Music, Roxie Marie, Roosevelt Franklin's Mother, Little Jerry and the Monotones, Professor Hastings, Granny Fanny Nesselrode, Captain Vegetable, Harvey Kneeslapper, Simon Soundman, the Busby Twins, Monty, Herbert Birdsfoot, Benny Rabbit, Little Chrissy and the Alphabeats, Colambo, Leslie Mostly, Ruby, Lulu, Deena, Clementine, Madame Chairbird, Kingston Livingston III, Ferlinghetti Donizetti, Lily, Jesse, Aunt Jill, Placido Flamingo, Elizabeth, Sonny Friendly, Leo Birdelli, Aristotle, Sherry Netherland, Narf, Mel, Googel, Phoebe, Merry Monster, Kermit the Forg, Maurice Monster, Harvey Monster, Clancy, Billy Monster, Stuie Monster, Pearl, Old MacDougal, Biff and Sully. The Two-Headed Monster appears as a waiter, while Herry cameos as a disco DJ. Baby Tooth and the Fuzzy Funk dance in the background.\n\nElmo sings \"In Your Imagination\". Wolfgang the Seal and Hoots also make appearances.\n\nAbby sings \"Imagine That\". Other characters in the song include Ernie (who originally sang the song) as a king, the Muppet horse used as Pferd on Sesamstrasse, a Muppet dragon, and Elmo as a sea captain.\n\nPrairie Dawn leads the Count and the audience in a rendition of \"Beep\". Like in the original song, while Prairie demonstrates how to remember simple numbers by saying \"beep\" that number of times, the Count asks about higher and higher numbers, until Prairie grows frustrated and runs off.\n\nCookie Monster sings the hip-hop/rap song \"Healthy Food\", joined by a Muppet pineapple, apple, bread, pear, and broccoli. Later, they're joined by a Muppet tomato, banana, lettuce, potato, cheese, corn, eggplant, bell pepper, cucumber, carrot, peach, beet, zucchini, and pumpkin.\n\nThe Count and some backup Anything Muppets sing \"Clap for the Wolfman\", with Jackman Wolf providing witty quips. The music is played by a monster band consisting of Elmo on acoustic guitar, Telly on tuba, Herry on bass, Murray on electric guitar, the Two-Headed Monster on keyboard, Gonger on drums, and Trevor on saxophone.\n\nRosita, backed by a band that includes Herry on bass, Prairie Dawn on piano, Big Bird on maracas, Gonger on bongos, Ovejita on trumpet and Trevor on saxophone, plays guitar and sings \"Conga\". During the song, she is greeted by a conga line of Muppets including Ernie, Bert, Elmo, Abby, Zoe, Telly, Cookie Monster, The Count, Grover, Baby Bear, Rudy, Julia, Roosevelt Franklin, Betty Lou, Roxie Marie, Murray, Little Bird, Biff, Sully, Mumford, and a Honker. In the MSG show, Rosita is joined by Gloria Estefan, who originally sang the song.\n\nThe Count and some Muppet sheep perform \"Lambaba\". Mary from \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\", Little Bo Peep, a Muppet ram, duck, cow, chicken, and dog also make appearances. In this version, instead of counting them himself, the Count encourages the audience to count the sheep as they dance by. 41 Muppet sheep (the 40 sheep dancing by the Count and Mary's little lamb) were made for the show, as was a new Muppet ram.\n\nTo slow down the show's pace, the Sesame Street Muppets perform a medley of \"nice and easy\" songs. Ernie sings \"Smile\" by Charlie Chaplin (with the pitch the same as Jimmy Durante and Josh Groban's covers) and Hoots sings \"What a Wonderful World\" by Louis Armstrong. Elmo, Zoe, Big Bird, Abby Cadabby, Bert, Grover, Cookie Monster, Telly, Rosita, Prairie Dawn, Baby Bear, and Rudy are the backup singers.\n\nIn a diner setting, Bert, seated at an otherwise empty table, sings \"Send in the Clowns\" as he waits for a potential date, accompanied by a band consisting of Ernie on trumpet, Elmo on violin, Prairie Dawn on piano, Hoots on saxophone, Rosita on acoustic guitar, Baby Bear on flute, Telly on tuba, Herry on bass, Trevor on clarinet, and Abby on harp. The tragic scene is juxtaposed with the appearance of Grover, Zoe, Cookie Monster, Gonger, the Two-Headed Monster, Rudy, Murray Monster, Ovejita, a Honker, and several AM Monsters dressed as circus clowns, as a literal take on the song's title. The orchestration and pitch of the song are taken from Frank Sinatra's cover.\n\nAbby and Zoe sing a duet of \"Little Things\" and \"Picture a World\", while admiring Muppet butterflies, flowers, and other forms of nature.\n\nOscar sings \"Mad World\" (sung to a low-pitched instrumental of Gary Jules' cover), with lyrics changed to be about Oscar lamenting his failure in making everyone feel as grouchy as he is.\n\nPrairie Dawn plays a lower-pitched rendition of \"Fur Elise\" on her piano.\n\nTo close the medley, Big Bird sings \"When the River Meets the Sea\" from Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas, accompanied by Prairie Dawn on piano, Elmo on violin, and Rosita on acoustic guitar. He is soon joined by the other Sesame Street Muppets on backup, and in the Staples Center show, by Paul Williams (who wrote the song). The song ends with the curtain quietly closing on the cast.\n\nTo lighten the mood, Grover, Herry, Cookie Monster and Rosita come out to sing \"Fuzzy and Blue\". Elmo enters after their verses, wanting to join them despite being fuzzy and red. The four give in and change the song to \"Fuzzy and Blue (and Red)\".\n\nThe Michael Jackson Muppet takes the stage again, this time lip-synching to Jackson's \"Thriller\".\n\nIn perhaps their first time in a duet, Zoe and Prairie Dawn sing \"Loud and Soft\"; Zoe enjoys singing loud, low, and long, while Prairie prefers to sing soft, high, and short. They're soon joined by Big Bird and Snuffy, with Big Bird singing loud, high, and long, and Snuffy singing soft, low, and short. They all agree on one thing, though; they like to sing good. Details about Zoe and Prairie are revealed before the song (for instance, whereas Zoe is fond of ballet, Prairie prefers to tap dance; and while Prairie likes to play the piano, Zoe loves to play music on a trombone).\n\nPatti LaBelle and a chorus of Muppets sing \"Gospel Alphabet\", with Don Music on piano. The chorus includes Abby Cadabby, Baby Bear, Bert, Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Count von Count, Elmo, Ernie, Gonger, Grover, Herry Monster, Murray Monster, Prairie Dawn, Roosevelt Franklin, Rosita, Rudy, Telly Monster, Trevor Monster, and Zoe. During the \"gospel\" part of the song, the puppeteer operating Trevor upstages the other performers by making him dance frantically all over the stage instead of singing along.\n\nThe Wiggles perform a medley of \"Toot Toot, Chugga Chugga, Big Red Car\", \"Here Come The Wiggles\", and parts of \"Get Ready to Wiggle\", \"Fruit Salad\", \"Hot Potato\", \"Can You Point Your Fingers and Do the Twist?\", \"Rock-a-Bye Your Bear\", \"Dorothy the Dinosaur\", \"Big Red Car\", \"Move Your Arms Like Henry\", \"Wags the Dog\", \"Captain Feathersword Fell Asleep on His Pirate Ship\", \"Wiggly Party\", \"Dorothy's Dance Party\", \"Balla Balla Bambina\", and “Do the Wiggle Groove\".\n\nDuring intermission, Weldon the Internet troll appears, and attempts to drive the audience away from the theater. (This sketch was only performed at Amway Center). The intermission music is \"Pinball Number Count\" and \"Lullaby of Birdland\".\n\nAct II[]\n\nErnie, some backup monster singers, Cookie Monster and Gonger sing a parody of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", called \"Cookie's Rhapsody\". The song is about Cookie Monster as he becomes wrecked with guilt after he eats a flan that was meant for Gonger, with the singers not helping him feel better at all. Near the end, Gonger arrives and tells Cookie he's not angry at him; he doesn't even like flan. Cookie smiles, then breaks down in quiet tears as Gonger comforts his friend. Backup musicians include Sully (playing the piano), Ovejita (on the drums), Rosita (on electric guitar), and Herry (on bass).\n\nBig Bird, Elmo, Ernie, Abby, Zoe, Prairie Dawn, Trevor, Rosita, Bert, Oscar, Grover, Cookie Monster, The Count, Herry, Telly, Baby Bear, Snuffy, Murray, the Two-Headed Monster, Gonger, Little Bird, Roosevelt Franklin, Betty Lou, Barkley, Alice Snuffleupagus, Hoots, and Mr. Johnson all sing \"What's the Name of That Song?\"\n\nIn a new installment of \"Monsterpiece Theater\", Alistair Cookie reviews humorous film parodies: a film based on the Super Morphin Mega Monsters (themselves parodies of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers franchise) starring Elmo, Zoe, Telly Monster and Rosita (MSG), Grouch (a parody of the Todd Phillips-directed Joker) starring Oscar (Staples), Batmonster & Red Robin (a spoof of the 1960s' Batman TV series and tie-in movie) starring Cookie Monster and Elmo as superheroes battling Muppet versions of the Joker, voiced by Mark Hamill, and Harley Quinn, voiced by Tara Strong, with the help of Super Grover and Commissioner Prairie Dawn (Amway), Star S'mores: The Rise of Piewalker (spoofing Star Wars' ninth film installment) starring an older Luke Piewalker and Princess Parfaita, and seven new Muppets; Brulee (a parody of the character Rey from the sequel trilogy), Kylo Creme (spoofing Kylo Ren), Fin the Fish (a take on Finn), Poe Danishon (Poe Dameron), unnamed expies of C-3PO, R2-D2 and BB-8, and the evil Emperor (a spoof of Emperor Palpatine) (Wembley), The Producers starring Oscar as Max Bialystock, Telly as Leo Bloom, The Count as Franz Liebkind, Rosita as Ulla, Bert and Ernie as Roger De Bris and Carmen Ghia (Rogers), and a documentary film starring Cookie Monster spoofing Steve Irwin as \"The Cookie Hunter\" (with Zoe as a parody of Terri Irwin), a famous conservationist defending wildlife and their habitats against a vicious game hunter who seeks to kill every animal in a jungle, in The Cookie Hunter: Call of the Wild (ICC Sydney).\n\nA parade of classic Sesame Street Muppets marches by Ernie and Bert. The parade Muppets change each show: Roosevelt Franklin, Little Bird, The Amazing Mumford, Farley, Rodeo Rosie, Merry Monster, Sherlock Hemlock, Betty Lou, Forgetful Jones, Barkley (MSG); Roosevelt Franklin, Little Bird, Sherlock Hemlock, Betty Lou, Biff, Sully, Harvey Kneeslapper, Don Music, Forgetful Jones, Lefty the Salesman (Staples); Roosevelt Franklin, Little Bird, Ruby, Elizabeth, Lulu, Sherlock Hemlock, Betty Lou, Leo the Party Monster, Forgetful Jones, Deena (Amway); Roosevelt Franklin, Little Bird, Placido Flamingo, Sherlock Hemlock, Betty Lou, Frazzle, Kingston Livingston III, Wolfgang the Seal, Forgetful Jones, Simon Soundman (Wembley); Roosevelt Franklin, Little Bird, Roxie Marie, Dr. Nobel Price, Sherlock Hemlock, Betty Lou, Baby Natasha, Alice Snuffleupagus, Forgetful Jones, Benny Rabbit (Rogers); Roosevelt Franklin, Little Bird, Professor Hastings, Herbert Birdsfoot, Sherlock Hemlock, Betty Lou, Polly Darton, SAM the Robot, Forgetful Jones, Clementine (ICC Sydney).\n\nThe Michael Jackson Muppet returns for a third performance, lip-synching to \"Billie Jean\".\n\nGrover performs \"Monster in the Mirror\" with some other monsters. The twin Grover in the mirror was achieved with an identical spare Grover puppet behind a mirror frame, lip-synched to Eric Jacobson's vocals by another puppeteer. Backup singers include Maurice Monster, Clancy, Kermit the Forg, Harvey Monster, Harry Monster, Bruce Monster, the lavender Frazzletone, and Billy Monster.\n\nIn a remake of a classic Sesame Street song/sketch, Abby is sleeping over at Ernie and Bert's apartment (sleeping in Bert's bed) when she is scared awake by visions of scary monsters chanting the chorus to \"Monster in the Mirror\". She wakes up Ernie and tells him of her nightmares, to which Ernie replies that she's just imagining the monsters she sees, and encourages her to think of happier things like balloons. To help her, he sings \"Imagination\" with Abby joining in (Ernie singing Bert's verses from the original version of the song, and Abby singing Ernie's verses).\n\nErnie invites the audience (and Bert) to play three rounds of \"Guess What's Next?\", first using household items to create a shape pattern (circle, square, triangle), fruits and vegetables to create a color pattern (orange, red, green, yellow), and finally Muppet animals (duck, sheep, penguin, chicken, cow). The sketch ends with Horatio the Elephant running amok (which begins right after Bert expresses relief that the game didn't end with an elephant running around) and the entire cast running for their lives (destroying the stage in the process); the curtains close amid the chaos.\n\nAfter the crew cleans up the mess behind the curtain (and gets rid of the elephant), Trevor enters to introduce Dr. Thad and the Medications, singing \"their greatest, and only, hit ever\", \"The Ten Commandments of Health\" while their patient, Mr. Johnson (Harvey P. Dull in the Wembley Arena show) repeats the commandments.\n\nStunt Monster Grover attempts a dangerous act or unnatural magic trick: cutting through a pineapple on Telly's head while blindfolded (MSG), trying to become the first monster to successfully jump over the Moon (finally falling back to Earth before Bert and Ernie introduce \"Fat Cat\") (Staples), revealing his mastery at card manipulation (Amway), showcasing his mastery at mentalism (Wembley), using mind powers to reverse time to the first episode of Sesame Street (Rogers), and assisting Prairie Dawn in creating a real-life version of a comic book character (ICC Sydney). Grover's card manipulation trick combined live puppetry, real-time digital puppetry and motion capture; Grover's head and body were both operated through live puppeteering (though both of Grover's rodded hands were tucked inside the puppet). Behind the platform Grover was standing, noted card magician Shin Lim, his face and arms covered in mocap dots, performed his tricks live, in the dark; while Grover's hands, created and performed using the Henson Digital Performance System, were projected via hologram in front of Grover, synching to the magician's hand movements (and animating the props he handled) in real time.\n\nBert (MSG), Ernie (Staples), Telly (Amway), Zoe (Wembley), Elmo (Rogers) and Big Bird (ICC Sydney) sing \"The People in Your Neighborhood\", spotlighting a trash collector, a barber (MSG), a postman, a firefighter (Staples), teachers, a newsdealer (Amway), a grocer, a doctor (Wembley), a dentist, a bus driver (Rogers), a cleaner and a baker (ICC Sydney), all played by Anything Muppets. In each version, the main singer uses the AM's attire and accessories to figure out what their job is.\n\nBacked by a jazz band of Anything Muppets, Hoots sings \"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\", with \"Grinch\" changed to \"Grouch\" to make the song about Oscar, with Oscar himself quipping on some of the lyrics.\n\nHoots next performs \"Put Down the Duckie\" with Ernie, and backup by the AM jazz band.\n\nBacked by Mama Bear and the Monsters, Grover sings \"New York, New York\". (This song was only performed at MSG)\n\nIn a disco setting, Zoe, in an attire inspired by John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever, and Abby, with an attire patterned after Ginger Rogers, dance to songs including \"I Will Survive\", \"Car Wash\", \"That's the Way I Like It\", \"Funkytown\", \"YMCA\", \"Got to Be Real\", \"Hot, Hot, Hot\", and \"Sesame Street Fever\", while other Muppets watch and cheer them on. (This sketch was only performed at Staples Center)\n\nBert takes the stage to sing \"Can't Stop the Feeling\". Eric Jacobson was assisted in performing Bert, who was seen from head to toe throughout the song, by two assistant puppeteers, all of whom wore black velvet against a black background. (This song was only performed at Amway Center)\n\nThe Sesame Street Muppets sing \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\". (This song was only performed at Wembley Arena)\n\nCookie Monster and Gonger take the stage to sing \"Immigrant Song\". Ovejita and Trevor supply background music. (This song was only performed at Rogers Centre)\n\nMama Bear and the Monsters perform \"Waltzing Matilda\". (This song was only performed at ICC Sydney)\n\nThe Count and his bats teach \"The Batty Bat\", a dance that he reminisces of learning as a boy in his ancestors' castle in his native Transylvania, to the audience.\n\nIn a remake of a classic Sesame Street sketch, Bert becomes annoyed by a letter repeating itself on his TV while he was watching his favorite show (P in MSG, S in Staples, R in Amway, C in Wembley, G in Rogers, and M in ICC Sydney). Ernie offers to fix the TV, but after he unplugs the set, he checks inside and pulls out things that begin with said letter. In the MSG show, Ernie pulls out a pair of pants, a pencil, a plane, a plant, a paperclip, a slice of pizza, a penguin, a sheet of paper, a pig, a plate, and a (live) puppy. In Staples, Ernie finds a sneaker stuffed with a sock, a spoon, a saw, a strawberry, a snake, a spatula, a sandwich (specified by Ernie to be peanut butter, banana and honey), a star, a sailboat, a shark, a shovel (covered with sand), and a sheep. In Amway, he releases a rock, a radio, a raisin, a rooster, a roll, a raccoon (the same one from \"I Love Trash\"), a rug, a rake, a ring, a ruler, a rattle, and a (live) rabbit. The Wembley show sees Ernie reveal a can, a car, a cane, a chain, a crayon, a cow, a (chocolate chip) cookie, a camera, a cup, a chair, a crocodile, a camel, a chicken, and a (live) cat. The Rogers show features a glove, a bottle of glue, a guitar, a gumball, a grape, a gorilla, some gum, a goose, a grasshopper, a pair of glasses, garlic, and a tank of gasoline. In the ICC Sydney show, Ernie pulls out a mask, a marker, a mailbox, a monkey, a mop, a (chocolate) milkshake, a moose, a mug, a marshmallow, a magazine, a mirror, and a mouse. After the set is fixed, Ernie turns the TV back on, only to find it repeating the letter following the one featured. Bert seems to enjoy it, though.\n\nSailing on a canoe, Trevor Monster sings the Bobby Darin classic \"Beyond the Sea\", with Rosita playing Trevor's \"lover\". For this number, a 55 ft. long, 7 ft. deep tank of water was built across the stage from beneath the stage floor (the front-facing side is covered by mechanical waves to fit in with the water). To pull off the illusion of the puppet sailing across the sea in an aluminum canoe, Ryan Dillon performed Trevor's head and mouth through a hole in the top of a diving bell attached to the base of the boat (located under a long hole on the stage floor), which was moved across the tank by a slow-moving conveyor belt underwater. Trevor's arms were operated via animatronics by two additional puppeteers offstage. Inside the diving bell, oxygen tanks were installed and activated to give Dillon, wearing an enhanced headset that allowed his voice to clearly be heard from inside, air to breathe, and four puppeteers were assigned as a rescue team in case trouble arose during the live performance. This technique had been similarly utilized for the \"Rainbow Connection\" scene that opens The Muppet Movie. The Rosita puppet used was completely animatronic, controlled by Carmen Osbahr and two offstage assistants.\n\nIn a park, Oscar, Grundgetta, and a chorus of Grouches sing \"I'm Sad Because I'm Happy\" as characters like Baby Bear, Telly, Trevor, Rosita, Abby, Grover, Herry, Elmo, Zoe, Bert, Ernie, Cookie Monster, Gonger, Prairie Dawn, Roosevelt Franklin, Betty Lou, Little Bird, and Benny are blown away in a hurricane. (The Staples Center version replaces Grover with Mr. Johnson, since the former is still yet to leap over the Moon)\n\nThe Sesame Street Muppets perform a \"Salute to Broadway\", which consists of excerpts of select songs from A Chorus Line, A Little Night Music, Annie, Annie Get Your Gun, Avenue Q, The Book of Mormon, The Boy from Oz, Bye Bye Birdie, Cabaret, Carousel, Cats, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Chicago, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Come From Away, Dear Evan Hansen, Fiddler on the Roof, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Grease, Gypsy, Hair, Hairspray, Hamilton, Hello Dolly!, Into the Woods, The King and I, Les Miserables, Little Shop of Horrors, Mamma Mia!, Man of La Mancha, The Music Man, My Fair Lady, Oklahoma!, Paint Your Wagon, The Phantom of the Opera, The Producers, Rent, The Rocky Horror Show, Singin' in the Rain, The Sound of Music, South Pacific, Spamalot, West Side Story, Wicked, and The Wizard of Oz, among other shows. (This sketch was only performed at Madison Square Garden)\n\nThe Sesame Street Muppets perform a \"Salute to Disney\", consisting of excerpts of songs from 101 Dalmatians, Aladdin, Bambi, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Coco, Dumbo, The Fox and The Hound, Frozen, The Great Mouse Detective, Hercules, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Jungle Book, Lady and the Tramp, The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Mary Poppins, Moana, Mulan, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Peter Pan, Pinocchio, Pocahontas, The Princess and the Frog, Robin Hood, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Song of the South, Tangled, Tarzan, Toy Story, Winnie the Pooh, and more among other films. (This sketch was only performed at Staples Center)\n\nMuppet-style figure puppets, performed by special guest puppeteers, the Chiodo Brothers, dance along to \"I'm a Gummy Bear (The Gummy Bear Song)\". (This sketch was only performed at Amway Center)\n\nA Muppet marionette, performed by special guest puppeteer Barnaby Dixon, dances to \"Bad Romance\". (This sketch was only performed at Wembley Arena)\n\nRiding motorcycles, Cookie Monster and a gang of biker monsters sing \"Born to Be Wild\". To pull off the illusion of Cookie and co. riding motorcycles, the background screen projected a moving image of a highway, while each biker monster performer was surrounded by a team of three puppeteers moving the bikes on platforms. (This song was only performed at Rogers Centre)\n\nElmo and Zoe dance with robotic versions of themselves to \"One Click Headshot\". (This song was only performed at ICC Sydney)\n\nIn a barnyard setting, Ernie, three Honkers, and a Dinger have a \"Honker-Duckie-Dinger Jamboree\", and invite the audience to join the party.\n\nBip Bippadotta and three Anything Muppets sing \"Fat Cat\". As in the original version, Bip runs up and annoys the other three with a fast scat that combines the four main rhymes in each verse and others.\n\nIn a remake of a classic Sesame Street sketch, Ernie and Bert invite the Count to a sleepover at their apartment, with Bert offering to sleep on the couch so the Count can take his bed. However, the Count finds he is unable to fall asleep, so Ernie suggests counting (Muppet) sheep as they jump over a (CGI) fence, which the Count does, complete with his trademark thunder and lightning, which startles and frightens Ernie. The next morning, the Count wakes up feeling cheerful and energetic, leading Bert to believe the Count had slept well last night, to which the Count reveals that he didn't sleep at all. It soon becomes apparent that the Count had kept Ernie awake all night long with his counting, as Ernie is now sleepwalking and counting in a monotonous voice. The Count asks Bert if he can have another sleepover, to which an exhausted Ernie collapses offstage.\n\nTelly, alone onstage, sings \"All By Myself\" and \"My Heart Will Go On\". The orchestration and pitch of both songs are taken from Celine Dion's covers.\n\nElmo, Abby Cadabby, Big Bird, Chicago the Lion, Butch the Tiger, Horatio the Elephant, Kathleen the Cow, Shelley the Turtle, Dawg the Dog, Chip and Dip, Poco Loco, the Big Bad Wolf, Joey and Davey Monkey, Iago the Donkey, Athena the Owl, Jamie Fox, Sydney the Camel, Duke the Horse, Bug, a Muppet bear, fish, duck, goat, frog, sheep, chicken, pig, gnu, alligator, rabbit, toucan, penguin, blue jay, grasshopper, turkey, spider, robin, porcupine, woodchuck, mouse, bee, kangaroo, aardvark, gorilla, warthog, armadillo, mole, guinea pig, moose, squirrel, shark, swan, beaver, pigeon, koala, zebra, giraffe, ostrich, snake, crow, vulture, baboon, rooster, raccoon, skunk, and polar bear sing \"We Are All Earthlings\". During the song, a montage plays of various different habitats and animals, at one point showing Big Bird in his nest. The song ends with sunlight entering the arena. This performance of the song combines the key of the original version with the speed of the 2002 remake sung by Jill Scott. For the MSG performances, a gospel choir is added during the third verse.\n\nAfter the animals leave, the Sesame Street Muppets, led by Big Bird and Elmo, perform an epic rendition of \"This is Me\" from The Greatest Showman.\n\nBig Bird leads the audience in singing \"Sing\" and \"One Small Voice\" (both with slow, dreamy compositions) as part of the closing medley. For the third song in the medley, Ernie, Abby, Elmo, Bert, Prairie Dawn, and the other Sesame Street Muppets perform \"Just One Person\".\n\nAs an encore, the Sesame Street Muppets sing \"The Street I Live On\" with Ernie thanking the guest stars before the final verse. (This song was performed at every arena except Amway Center)\n\nThe Sesame Street, The Muppets, Fraggle Rock, Bear in the Big Blue House and international Sesame Street characters all come together to sing \"We Are the World\" with Ernie thanking the guest stars before the chorus is sung for the final time. (This song was only performed at Amway Center)\n\nAfter the song, the Muppet performers take their bows, with the main performers receiving a roll call as announced by an onstage celebrity: Stephen Colbert (MSG), Tom Bergeron (Staples), Steve Harvey (Amway), John Oliver (Wembley), LeVar Burton (Rogers), and the Wiggles (ICC Sydney). Toots Thielemans' classic harmonica instrumental of the Sesame Street theme song plays as the audience leaves the theater.\n\nAt the end of the final performance in ICC Sydney, new footage is shown of the Sesame Street Muppets boarding a tour bus and singing the George Strait song \"Somewhere Down in Texas\" (renamed \"I'll Be Somewhere in New York City\"), with lyrics rewritten to be about returning to Sesame Street after a long year of being on the road. As the song ends, a special credit is shown behind a black background: \"The Sesame Street LIVE! world tour is dedicated to JOAN GANZ COONEY, LLOYD MORRISETT, and everyone who made Sesame Street possible. We thank you for your creativity and imagination.\"\n\nOn TV broadcasts, the credits roll over footage of the Sesame Street Muppets on their tour bus, leaving the arena and travelling to their next stop; Ernie leads the cast in singing Willie Nelson's \"On the Road Again\". On video and streaming releases, a different closing sequence is used instead, featuring the Sesame Street theme (using the music track heard on the album Bob's Favorite Street Songs), sung by the Sesame Street Muppets instead of Bob McGrath.\n\nCast[]\n\nThe Sesame Street Muppet Performers\n\nPam Arciero\n\nGrundgetta, Oinker Sister, Dentist Patient\n\nJennifer Barnhart\n\nZoe, Maggie Cadabby, Mama Bear, Gladys the Cow, Granny Bird\n\nBill Barretta\n\nLouie\n\nWarrick Brownlow-Pike\n\nGonger\n\nTyler Bunch\n\nJackman Wolf, Chewie the Cookie, Ricardo, Firefighter, Welsh Rabbit, Louie understudy\n\nLeslie Carrara-Rudolph\n\nAbby Cadabby, Brulee, Rosa, Jesse, Lily, Oinker Sister, Raccoon, Rose\n\nKevin Clash\n\nElmo, Hoots the Owl, Benny Rabbit\n\nFrankie Cordero\n\nRudy\n\nStephanie D'Abruzzo\n\nPrairie Dawn, Mae, Oinker Sister, Curly Bear, Princess Parfaita, Doctor Patient, Berry Farmer\n\nRyan Dillon\n\nTrevor Monster, Don Music, Poe Danishon, Baker, Hunter puppeteer, Elmo understudy\n\nDave Goelz\n\nSly the Secretary Bird (Amway Center)\n\nStacey Gordon\n\nJulia\n\nBrian Henson\n\nSly the Secretary Bird (Staples Center)\n\nEric Jacobson\n\nBert, Grover, Oscar the Grouch, Guy Smiley, Two-Headed Monster, Mountie\n\nPeter Linz\n\nErnie, Herry Monster, Daniel, Luke Piewalker, Raisin Farmer, Cleaner\n\nJoey Mazzarino\n\nMurray Monster, Papa Bear, Zaftig\n\nCarmen Osbahr\n\nRosita, Ovejita\n\nMartin P.
