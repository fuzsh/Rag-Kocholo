        "text": "****\n\nI’d open a coffee shop for women only.\n\nThis is an interesting movie. If it were only about two adults who turn out to be In The Mood For Love, then this would have been a bittersweet movie. But this movie also offers a glimpse into Egyptian life. More than that, it shows Egypt without judging or offering glib solutions to what westerners see as problems.\n\nJuliette Grant—Patricia Heaton—arrives in Cairo to meet her husband, Mark—Tom McCamus. Mark is more or less a MacGuffin. Instead of meeting her at the airport, Mark’s friend and former colleague, Tareq—Alexander Siddig, Dr. Julian Bashir from Star Trek Deep Space 9—greets her on his behalf. It turns out that they worked at the UN together and Mark is stuck at his Palestinian refugee camp in Gaza. As they leave Tareq is greeted by a woman, Yasmeen–Amina Annabi, who invites them to her daughter’s wedding in Alexandria. Over the ensuing days Juliette learns about Cairo first hand and Mark still fails to appear. The relationship that develops between Juliette and Tareq is a complicated one, but beautiful in the way of Mrs. Chan and Chow Mo-Wan’s in In The Mood For Love, or the one in Lost in Translation. Again, if this movie were set in Des Moines it would be worth watching.\n\nHowever, Cairo Time takes place almost exclusively in Mumbai. Okay that was a lie, it takes place mostly in Cairo. Five years I would have thought this could have been in Cairo, Tehran, Riyadh, or even Islamabad, but I have actually been to Cairo and studied Egyptian Law (for a week). Several things jumped out to me about how Juliette looked and behaved in her first forays into Cairo alone—her just below the knee skirt, her short sleeve shirt, her lack of a male companion, and her pale white skin. Eventually she gets a gang of oglers who violate her personal space. That was consistent with my understanding of Cairo, as was the mix of outfits ranging from western—like Yasmeen’s—to full on black burkas. Into this environment Tareq is her hero, not that Juliette is merely passive. Upon learning that Mark is even further delayed she boards a bus for Gaza. This produces a tense encounter when the bus is stopped by members of the Israeli Defense Force. As the only American on the bus, she is treated at first with open distrust that turns to a modicum of respect. What she did was foolhardy, but broke the conventions of the hapless undercover princess rules that could have confined her. Juliette speaks her mind, like about the youthful beggars whom Tareq would just tell off. When Juliette says, “it seems like no-one cares,” Tareq does not unnaturally take on the mantle of the westernized Egyptian, instead he simply says, “it’s complicated.” Thankfully, so is the movie."
