        "text": "Every once in a while, we watch a film that we’re too shy\n\nto admit that we actually enjoyed. Cairo\n\nTime is one of those films that you really don’t want to like and the more\n\nyou resist; the more it grows on you.\n\nJuliette (Clarkson) is the wife of a Canadian diplomat\n\nstationed in Gaza.\n\nShe arrives in Cairo\n\nAirport and is greeted by\n\nan ex-colleague of her husband’s called Tarek (Siddiq). When Juliette’s husband\n\ngets held up in Gaza, Tarek becomes Juliet’s key to discovering the curious\n\nmetropolis of Cairo. Juliet becomes as enamoured with old-world Cairo traditions as with\n\nher charming guide.\n\nAside from the basic plot and all of the kitschy\n\npossibilities that may come from it, the film is lovely. From the Abdel Halim\n\nmusic in the old-school Cairo cabs to gorgeous footage\n\nof the famous El Shams ahwa, Cairo Time\n\ngives its viewers a tour of Cairo\n\nthat will make Cairenes and long-time expats fall in love with the city all\n\nover again. Juliette’s pure fascination with things that most Cairenes take for\n\ngranted is endearing, like passing the Pyramids of Giza or driving over the Nile .\n\nIt was also great to see Cairo depicted relatively\n\naccurately in the film and not overly-romanticised. Granted, there was some colour-tinting\n\nof the Nile, but it wasn’t the extremely false Hollywood version of Cairo. The traffic, noise\n\nand the street harassment was all there; and Juliette nonetheless managed to fall in love\n\nwith the city.\n\nThe only major problem with the film is that the romance\n\nbetween Juliette and Tarek is rather unconvincing. It’s very unlikely that an\n\nEgyptian man would make a move on an old friend’s wife. Thankfully, however, at\n\nleast the romance subplot is carried out in a tasteful way."
