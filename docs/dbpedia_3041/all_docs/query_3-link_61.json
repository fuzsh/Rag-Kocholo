        "text": "Cairo Time (2009)\n\nMovie Review by Debbie Winkler\n\nStarring: Patricia Clarkson, Alexander Siddig, Elena Anaya, Amina Annabi, Tom McCamus\n\nDirector: Ruba Nadda\n\nRelease Date: 13 September 2009\n\nLanguage: English\n\nLength: 90 minutes\n\nMovie Rating: PG\n\nView Format: Online Streaming\n\nMy Rating:\n\nSynopsis:\n\nJuliette (Patricia Clarkson) has finally traveled to Cairo to visit her husband, who works for the UN in the Middle East. Unfortunately, a crisis in Gaza pulls her husband away before Juliette arrives so he asks a good friend, Tareq (Alexander Siddig), to keep an eye on Juliette. Juliette finds Cairo is nothing like what she expected and struggles to get around on her own in a male-dominated country. She comes to rely more and more on Tareq to protect her and show her around. The more time these two spend with each other, the more they seem to be slipping into something more than friendship. Set against the stunning vistas of Egypt, Cairo Time tells an atypical story of a old-fashioned romance.\n\nReview:\n\nCairo Time was carefully crafted by someone who clearly loved the country and its people. The story is slow-moving with hidden depths, just like the Nile itself. This movie absolutely captured my feelings about the city of Cairo. I traveled there myself a few years ago and was thanking my lucky stars that I booked a guided tour after trying to get around Cairo myself for one day. The city is packed, hot and there are really no traffic rules. There are no crosswalks to get from one side of the street to the other so I did exactly what Juliette’s character did – find a local and cross when they did! Egyptian men are aggressive, have no idea of personal boundaries and yet are still oddly charming. The women you see out and about are covered up and pretty quiet. The men, on the other hand, are loud, effusive and have an old-fashioned well-mannered air about them. Unfortunately, they get the idea that all American women are like those they see on TV so they don’t have a very high opinion of tourists, particularly women.\n\nTareq (Alexander Siddig) was quietly charming and I found him very attractive. He had his heart broken while in college when the love of his life married another man. Tareq is still single and has recently retired from the UN. Juliette (Patricia Clarkson) is a successful magazine writer with two grown children and a husband who don’t seem to need her any more. Both of them start off their relationship with awkward silences and uncertain forays into conversation. But the more time they spend together, the more the silences become peaceful and quiet sharing times. The culmination of their relationship is a bittersweet visit to the Great Pyramids, an amazing sight that Juliette promised she wouldn’t see without her husband. There is no physical culmination of the relationship in this movie, which I found extremely effective and a great deal more believable than a torrid affair would have been in this setting. Juliette just wants to matter to someone again. Tareq doesn’t want to have his heart broken again, but accepts that this will happen with grace and dignity. There is a slow build-up to the relationship between these two, a relationship that you know is doomed to fail and yet cannot help but want to see develop. This is not a typical modern-day romance as we think of it today, but a more courtly love as in medieval times. Both man and woman accept that they will never be able to act up on the love that has developed between them, but they do not deny themselves the pleasure of a little flirtation, some shared moments and bittersweet memories that will see them through the lonely times.\n\nCairo Time was not at all what I expected, but I found that I enjoyed it. I was caught up in the sights, the smells and sounds of Cairo, Egypt all over again. There is something terrifying and, at the same time, alluring about this city. I truly enjoyed the romance between Juliette and Tareq and appreciated that the director, Ruba Nadda, showed their love in a more than physical way. The scenery was interesting and lovely and the story was nice and slow, which made it all the more enjoyable. Patricia Clarkson looks absolutely lovely in this movie. She has a gorgeous wardrobe and an amazing body that I would like to have! Alexander Siddig has that little something special that you look for in a leading man and I was utterly captivated by his character. If you are looking for something to watch that is not a typical romance movie, Cairo Time may just fit the bill.\n\nContent:\n\nThis movie contains a few scenes of drinking and smoking. There is some mild flirtation and discussion of current issues such as child labor, lack of education, extramarital affairs, out-of-wedlock pregnancy, detentions on the Gaza Strip, etc. Recommended for ages 12 and up."
