        "text": "Excellent restaurant! We had a 6:30 reservation on a very busy Saturday night. We arrived 15 minutes early and the hostess sat us quickly with no problems! Our waitress was so kind, upbeat and fun! The food was delicious and the food runner delivered each dish with a witty remark that truly made our dinner so fun!\n\nHow can I put this in words...it was perfectionâ€¼ Starting with the apps, the gazpacho was creamy to taste and the oysters were juicy and so fresh . Moving on, the wagyu bolognese was very chewy and complimented the beef so well. Felt like a taste of Italy. The short rib **literally** melted in my mouth and I will be dreaming of the truffle.\n\nI had the grilled pizza for an app and it was so delicious. The crust was crispy and it had just the right amount of sauce and cheese. I had the duck duo for my entree (duck breast & leg) with a mushroom risotto. The breast was delicious and cooked perfectly. I'm not a big fan of duck leg but the skin was cooked to perfection\n\nI always have a great time when I dine at Circe. The atmosphere is very sophisticated and lively. The evening we went, one of the bartenders was playing music and we absolutely loved the playlist. Our waitress was Jess and she was incredible. She was very friendly, funny, and checked in on us regularly. The cocktails are incredible here.\n\nThe service we received was amazing!! the waitress was personable and really let us take our time to enjoy the delicious food. My family usually does not like to go to the same restaurants twice, but before we left we agreed we have to come back in the near future! The food was very flavorful, cooked well."
