        "text": "PAWTUCKET – The remains of World War II veteran Henry McConnell were buried in the family plot in Pawtucket on Thursday, 80 years after his death, fulfilling the wish of his mother, Katherine McConnell.\n\nShe died in 1973, but not before exacting a promise from her only surviving son, John: Do everything you can to bring Henry's body home.\n\nJohn McConnell died in 2016, but the DNA he provided helped Department of Defense investigators positively identify the remains of Henry, who died in a Japanese prison camp. John is also buried in the family plot.\n\n“He made a promise to his mother that he would get his brother home, and he kept it,” said Charleen Primo of Cumberland, John McConnell's daughter. “I just wish he was here to see it, but I’m sure he is smiling down from heaven.”\n\nHenry McConnell was among those reported captured in April 1942 when, after three months without food and water and little military support, thousands of Allied soldiers were forced to surrender on the Bataan peninsula.\n\nIn the 1950s, Katherine McConnell received a letter from the U.S. government explaining a major effort underway at several former Japanese prison camps in the Philippines to exhume the remains of thousands of American soldiers and reinter them in Manila, where a 152-acre American cemetery was being readied.\n\nIn 2016, John McConnell died shortly after attending a memorial service for his brother and others like him at the Veterans Cemetery in Exeter.\n\n“He wasn’t even sick,” says Charleen. “I guess he figured the remains would never be coming home.”\n\nLaid to rest Thursday, Henry McConnell is by his brother's side once again."
