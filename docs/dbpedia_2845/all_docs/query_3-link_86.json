        "text": "Leilah Babirye (b. 1985, Kampala, Uganda; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nNamaganda owe Mbogo (Among the Beautiful Girls from the Buffalo Clan), 2020\n\nWood, wax, nails, screws, wire, plastic, and found objects\n\nCourtesy the artist, Gordon Robichaux, New York, and Stephen Friedman Gallery, London\n\nI am an artist-activist living in New York City, where I was recently granted asylum after fleeing persecution in my native Uganda. This new series of masks talks back to homophobia. Combining figurative and abstract elements, and employing a wide range of found objects, the masks portray queer archetypes that I’ve named after contemporary princes, princesses, and clans within the kingdom of Buganda’s royal family. Here, knotted plastic bags are woven through discarded tubing, and shredded to resemble hair.\n\nFirelei Báez (b. 1981, Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic; lives and works in the Bronx, New York)\n\nOn rest and resistance, Because we love you (to all those stolen from among us), 2020\n\nOil and acrylic on canvas\n\nCourtesy the artist and James Cohan, New York\n\nThis work is in reference to the 70,000 black women and girls in the United States currently missing. Who continue to be unnamed and uncared for, even though this should be a national crisis. The figure in this painting is inspired by an archival image of civil rights activist Freedom Riders sleeping in church pews taken by photographer Paul Schutzer circa 1961. It is a particularly tender inter-generational scene of women resting and supporting each other. In this place of respite, I center the transformative actions that can show ways beyond the spaces in our culture where care, love, and beauty are not naturally and equitably given.\n\nChloë Bass (b. 1984, New York, NY; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nPersonal Choice (#2), 2020\n\nDigital collage\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nPersonal Choice #2 is a digital collage combining an “excerpted” archival image from the New York Public Library’s Media Collection, and an original text I wrote. The image features the Broyards, a large multiracial American family previously unaware of each other due to legacies of slavery and its impact on mixed-race children, during their family reunion. The Personal Choice series is part of my larger project Obligation to Others Holds Me in My Place, a study of intimacy at the scale of the immediate family.\n\nMaría Berrío (b.1982, Bogotá, Colombia; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nFrom Such Soil It Blooms, 2020\n\nCollage with Japanese papers and watercolor paint on canvas\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nNew York is a city populated by dreamers. Even in our tumultuous present, these dreams are as vivid and abundant as ever. Here, a carpet of flowers symbolizes the constellations of people within the city who help each individual to realize their dreams. The shoulders we stand on are often simply those we stand shoulder to shoulder with: the dreamer is sustained by the same hopes that sustain those around her.\n\nElizabeth Bick (b. 1980, Houston, Texas; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York\n\nHawk Snipes and their Mother Mary Snipes, 2020Digital photograph\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nA chance encounter with B. Hawk Snipes on 34th street and 8th Avenue two years ago has resulted in a portrait of their life and the final component of a work entitled Movement Studies. Our collaboration has documented B. Hawk’s transition from identifying as a gay man to a transgender non-binary femme and a social activist. This work is dedicated to the #blacklivesmatter and #blacktranslivesmatter movement, and to B. Hawk and their mother Mary Snipes.\n\nArielle Bobb-Willis (b. 1994, New York, New York; lives and works in Union City, New Jersey)\n\nWest New York, 2020, 2020\n\nDigital photograph\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nThis year has been a test for everyone’s mental health to say the least. The countless killings of black men, women, and children, the carelessness of our government, and the virus are incredibly triggering. Having to adjust can be difficult. Although photography helps with my depression it isn’t a fix-all. My healing process is ever-evolving and I wanted to create something that captures the continuous effort needed to stay afloat. This work is just a reminder to all that we will never give up on the pursuit of peace and happiness.\n\nElliott Jerome Brown Jr. (b. 1993, Baldwin, New York; lives and works in Queens, New York)\n\nSound of the Rain, 2020\n\nDigital photograph\n\nCourtesy the artist and Nicelle Beauchene Gallery, New York\n\nMy photographs privilege the interiority of individuals and communing groups, often investing in how people tend to their space and less so how they become clear to others. Sound of the Rain is a new commission that abstracts a direct view of the Mount Morris Fire Watchtower in Harlem’s Marcus Garvey Park. As such, it references the history of its official use and its current informal and sentimental roles.\n\nThe work is titled after a song by Solange, which includes an animated video by visual artist Jacolby Satterwhite. As I reflected on the various functions of the park, I recalled the video’s use of fire as a medium for growth.\n\nZach Bruder (b. 1984, Cleveland, Ohio; lives and works in New York, New York)\n\nPedlar, 2020\n\nAcrylic and flashe on linen\n\nCourtesy the artist and Magenta Plains\n\nI love the hand-painted signs of New York–they exude warmth and pride, signaling more than the services and products offered. In Pedlar, tools of different trades wait for the return of artisans to resume their craft. Pictured in isolation, these instruments call to mind bustling neighborhoods on pause, longing for the familiar.\n\nJordan Casteel (b. 1989, Denver, CO; lives and works in New York, New York)\n\nMinnesota, 2020\n\nOil on canvas\n\nCourtesy the artist and Casey Kaplan, New York\n\nMinnesota, 2020, as part of my ongoing Subway Series, depicts a man, unknown to me, seen during my commute several months back. The word “Minnesota” is printed across his hat in bold letters. At the time, I didn’t process this language as anything more than a state. Now, this place couldn’t feel more meaningful — as the home state of George Floyd, whose wrongful death has forced a global reckoning with systematic racial inequities. Sometimes it feels like coincidence or a conjuring, and then I remember that my community has been speaking for a long time with intense clarity. These moments are right in front of us. We just have to be ready to receive them.\n\nSara Cwynar (b. 1985, Vancouver, Canada; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nScaffold Statue of Liberty, 2020\n\nDigital photograph\n\nCourtesy the artist and Foxy Production, New York\n\nMy photographs often take the form of sculptural constructions that are photographed, printed, tiled, and re-photographed as new images. This image is a reworked 1980’s photograph of the Statue of Liberty covered in scaffolding. I have collaged into the image with objects from New York City stores, art from MoMA, and my own iphone photographs of the recent protests in the city among other things. I wanted to re-animate this old New York icon and update it for the current time.\n\nJeremy Dennis (b. 1990, Southampton, NY; lives and works on the Shinnecock Indian Reservation in Southampton, NY)\n\nVincent (from the series ‘Shinnecock Portrait Project’), 2020\n\nArchival inkjet print\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nThis portrait of Vincent Cuffee is from a series titled Shinnecock Portrait Project. As Shinnecock tribal members, community members, and family members, one of the difficulties we all share are misconceptions portrayed by the media. Photography has traditionally been used as evidence of truth, which has been used historically against the Shinnecock to threaten our sovereignty and self-determination. This portrait, and the ongoing series, celebrates our continued presence and resilience.\n\nRafael Domenech (b. 1989, Havana, Cuba; lives and works in Manhattan, New York)\n\nPeripheral poem 68 (countermonument pavilion), 2020\n\nScanned laser-print on paper, tape\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nI walked, I walk through the conurbated city to retrace his steps, to document the ecology of relationships that sustains this place. Time passed—time regained. And now, I construct a landscape through layers of images from the archive. The landscape is no longer that of Frederic Church, but a decentralized picture with no vast depth of field, no clarity. It is not a postcard, it is an amalgamating message.\n\nIvan Forde (b. 1990, Timehri, Guyana; lives and works in Harlem, New York)\n\nAfter The Storm, 2020\n\nCyanotype and gouache on archival paper\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nThe horizon is a timeless image that connects all of humanity, from ancient to modern. Right now, it’s like we’re at sea: we speak of “first waves,” “second waves,” and how tumultuous our present time is in the wake of the global pandemic. So I offer a vision of the ocean after a storm. Five sailors (which are all photographs of myself) gaze upon golden constellations, as Venus follows the setting sun over the far deep purple horizon. A diver with hands covering his mouth swims toward a mysterious heliotrope crystal. I hope this image reassures us that we must continue to work together to harness the storm in creating a collective and just future.\n\nMarley Freeman (b. 1981, Boston, MA; lives and works in New York, New York)\n\nVenuses Balcony, 2020\n\nOil and acrylic on linen\n\nCourtesy the artist and Karma, New York\n\nVenuses Balcony takes its title from Samuel R. Delany’s 1999 non-fiction classic Times Square Red, Times Square Blue. In a kind of eulogy for the Times Square red light district of the 1970s and 80s, Delany theorizes the nature of interclass contact. The Venus—whose balcony figures prominently throughout Delany’s first-person account—was one of many iconic theaters lost to gentrification. Painted in oil and acrylic on linen, Venuses Balcony captures the vibrant, bustling character of social relations in New York.\n\nChitra Ganesh (b. 1975, Brooklyn, New York; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nUrgency, 2020\n\nDigital media\n\nCourtesy the artist, Gallery Wendi Norris, and Hales Gallery\n\nUrgency draws from collective archetypes around regeneration and rebirth, including: Birth of Venus, Mami Wata, Mahishasura Mardini, figures from Tarot, Jung’s Anima, the Phoenix, and other icons of femininity and power. This time has led me to think in depth about collective dreams, collective consciousness, and collectively held archetypes that are both primordial and future-facing. The work is also inspired in part by Iconologia, traditions of articulating moral emblems and psychic states in figurative form, compiled in Italy in the 1500s, a compendium of emblematic representation including but not limited to Egyptian and Roman iconography and myth.\n\nOto Gillen (b. 1984, New York, NY; lives and works in New York, New York)\n\nPath, July 22, 2019, 2020\n\nDigital photograph\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nReflecting on this photograph months after taking it in the summer of 2019, it seemed to embody my uncertainty of the future ahead coupled with my curiosity to witness it. Today, this image still sits ambiguously between the ominous and inviting; offering my imagination the opportunity to fall into an unfamiliar and strange terrain past its depths. I was motivated to include this photograph not only for the illusionistic effect I hope it has at street level but also for how it plays against the function of the bus shelter as a site of departure for New Yorkers moving across the city.\n\nBaris Gokturk (b. 1982, Ankara, Turkey; lives and works Brooklyn, New York)\n\n#26, 2020\n\nInk, oil, acrylic, pencil and image transfer on linen\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nI have been working on a series with the idea of protest fire as a simultaneous act of destruction and hope for change. I have been looking into street fires started during different protests around the globe for the destructive yet regenerative abilities of popular uprisings and how that dual capability can be paralleled in the plastic language of painting, as well as in the mechanics and philosophies of image-making in art.\n\nChase Hall (b. 1993, St. Paul, Minnesota; lives and works in New York, New York)\n\nA Great Day in Harlem, 2020\n\nAcrylic and coffee on cotton canvas\n\nCourtesy Chase Hall Studio\n\nA Great Day in Harlem is a rendition of a photograph by Art Kane, made in 1958, of fifty-seven Jazz musicians gathered in front of a brownstone on 126th Street in Harlem. I was thirteen when this image served as my introduction to the humanity behind Jazz, not just the sound of humanity. The strokes of paint and coffee on cotton that I used in this work create representations that are coded in improvisation and empathy. Redefining colonial instruments and re-working their function, creating Jazz is a reminder of the malleability of sound, life and history.\n\nLucia Hierro (b. 1987, New York, NY; lives and works in The Bronx, New York)\n\nThe Daily Bread/El Pan de Cada Día, 2020\n\nDigital image\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nFor this work, I not only wanted to replicate a bodega but also to highlight the moments which mimic Colmados in the Dominican Republic; depicting baked goods, root vegetables, and other items Americans may not immediately recognize. They function as everything stores but most importantly are a place where neighbors commune. The survival of these small businesses is so important to me. These spaces offer a little piece of home to those from the island.\n\nEsteban Jefferson (b. 1989, New York, NY; lives and works in New York, New York)\n\nWindow, 2020\n\nOil on linen\n\nCourtesy the artist, photo documentation by Adam Reich\n\nI’m interested in small and personal forms of resistance, and that’s what I saw in this window. Black lives matter.\n\nYifan Jiang (b. 1994, Tianjin, China; lives and works in Manhattan, New York)\n\nTrampoline, 2020\n\nOil on canvas\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nThe day was ending when I walked upon two kids jumping on the trampoline. They would climb into mid-air, hang there for a second, and fall back down. Repeated tirelessly, the scene solidified into an unlikely blend of cheer and serenity. During a time of turbulence, I hope this small moment can help one find gratitude in the simplicity of being in the world.\n\nCheyenne Julien (b. 1994, Bronx, NY; lives and works in the Bronx, New York)\n\nMosholu Parkway, 2020\n\nPen and ink on paper\n\nCourtesy the artist and Chapter NY\n\nThroughout my practice I have used personal narrative to explore larger issues that have impacted me, such as environmental racism, displacement, and generational trauma. I am interested in the idea that bodies inhabit a physical space to determine one’s perception of it. Using memories, I reconstruct people and places from my life. These figures are typically aware of, or responding to, the environment that confines them. The paintings and drawings are monochrome at times, and vibrant at others, to set the mood of what is being depicted. The cartoon-like figures are used to produce a sense of the uncanny, teetering on the edge of reality.\n\nAdam Khalil (b. 1988, Nyack, NY; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nanother day without a future, but what the hell another day…, 2020\n\nDigital image\n\nCourtesy of the artist, New Red Order, and Walker Tate\n\nUnderstanding there are many worlds within this world and they each have an end, familiar creatures appropriated from government seals and crests convoke to imagine indigenous futures within the post-apocalyptic present.\n\nBaseera Khan (b. Denton, TX; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nBlue White and Red, 2020\n\nPleather, leather, chromogenic print, and grommets\n\nCourtesy the artist and Simone Subal Gallery, New York\n\nThis new work is a banner, a seal, portal, flag, a garment — I don’t know yet. After a feverish dream in May, I knew how to achieve this new series: a flowing system of layers grommeted together to conceal and reveal different elements at different times. The cutout pleather patterns obscure intimate moments of photographic love. Akin to an older series of mine called the Acoustic Sound Blankets, this new body of work stems from radical-ornamentation histories.\n\nAndrew Kuo (b. 1977, Queens, NY; lives and works in Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York)\n\nIdeal Map of New York City 2020, 2020\n\nAcrylic on linen\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nIdeal Map of New York City is a re-imagining of New York as a place that probably isn’t perfect for everyone, but seems to me like a wonderful place to live.\n\nDoron Langberg (b. 1985, Yokneam Moshava, Israel; lives and works in New York, New York)\n\nJoe and Edgar, 2020\n\nOil on linen\n\nCourtesy the artist and Yossi Milo Gallery, New York\n\nJoe and Edgar captures a couple in tender repose, silhouetted by glowing afternoon light. The bold, atmospheric colors and expressive use of paint bring out the figures’ emotional world, highlighting their intimate connection. As we turn inwards as a society, I wanted to offer this moment that is both queer and relatable, as a source of solace and strength in the face of the unknown, focusing on our greatest asset – our love for one another.\n\nSophie Larrimore (b. 1980, Annapolis, MD; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nReunion, 2020\n\nWatercolor and colored pencil on paper\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nReunion depicts two dogs entwined in a tight embrace. As the warm weather of summer approached I wanted to address the issue of how we might come together following, and indeed during, a time of upheaval, uncertainty and change. The coming together, collision really, of two forms. Two friends coming together after a long separation; becoming one form through their closeness.\n\nNate Lewis (b. 1985, Beaver Falls, PA; lives and works in Harlem, New York)\n\nTidal Volume, 2020\n\nHand sculpted inkjet print and ink\n\nCourtesy the artist and Fridman Gallery\n\nIn this global pandemic we contribute to the fragility and resilience of each other, each nation and tribe occupying a different space on the spectrum. The complexity of Covid-19 continues to unfold before us as a multi-system agent sowing and revealing discord while testing our social fabric. Destabilized ground and lungs devoid of air became a catalyst for a global revolution. The landscape shudders luminescent with promise or destruction.\n\nSharon Madanes (b. 1985, Chicago, Illinois; lives and works in New York, New York)\n\nPulse, 2020\n\nOil on panel\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nI work both as a physician and an artist; my paintings explore the rituals, ethics, and aesthetics of medicine. I made Pulse in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and my experiences as a healthcare provider. When humans are veiled with layers of protective gear, moments of touch, regardless of their nature, are charged with heightened intimacy and poetic meaning.\n\nJoiri Minaya (b. 1990, New York NY; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nEmergence, 2020\n\nDigital collage\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nEmergence is a digital collage I made based on Containers, a performance and photo series featuring Caribbean women wearing enclosed bodysuits that symbolize societal projections and stereotypes through the use of tropical prints. At the same time, the bodysuits use camouflage and opacity as opportunities for respite, introspection, and strategizing against a system of hyper-visibility and oppression. Emergence depicts the moment of taking off the Container: a moment of relief, agency, resilience and self-determination.\n\nWilla Nasatir (b. 1990, Los Angeles, CA; lives and works in New York, New York)\n\nThe Long Ride #2, 2020\n\nDigital photograph\n\nCourtesy the artist and Chapter NY\n\nIn my photographs I use found objects to restage filmic tropes that connote sensations of suspense, seduction, and crisis. Before making them, I pick up things I see when walking under the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to my studio; loose gravel or car parts. In this work I made a sun out of a rearview mirror that had been run over. I see my pictures as a kind of abstract portraiture—imagery intended to evoke emotion rather than communicate a message. In that sense, the content of the work is abstract, but the pictures are constructed around where I live and what I see.\n\nJordan Nassar (b. 1985, New York, New York; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nRiverside Park NYC, 2020\n\nHand-embroidered cotton on cotton\n\nCourtesy the artist and James Cohan Gallery, New York; Anat Ebgi Gallery, Los Angeles; The Third Line, Dubai\n\nI hand embroidered this piece, Riverside Park NYC, as I do with almost all of my work, using the medium of Tatreez, traditional Palestinian embroidery. As a Palestinian-American, I grew up on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, overlooking Riverside Park, and for this piece I based the composition off of a boulder that is placed in the park outside my childhood apartment building. In imagining a future after this tumultuous year, I chose to re-imagine this vista of the park, an emblem representing home, envisioning a fantastical, magical and hopefully better future version of our city. Doing my part in dreaming up the world we want to live in.\n\nMadhini Nirmal (b. 1992, Chennai, India; lives and works in Queens, New York)\n\nGotham City (“Goat’s Town” in Old English), 2020\n\nGouache, watercolor, acrylic, and collage on paper\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nAmidst the cornucopia of fresh and affordable produce, in the loud, crowded and narrow aisles of a neighborhood Italian grocery store, I feel echoes of my homeland thousands of miles away. With its fearless and resilient nature, the goat is a symbol of joyful aspiration in my work. Since “Gotham,” originally meant “Goat’s Town”, you find goats playing free in a vibrant Queens street corner, the one with my favorite store, signaling a brighter future.\n\nStephen Obisanya (b. 1989, Lagos, Nigeria; lives and works in Staten Island, New York)\n\nAGAPE, 2020\n\nDigital photograph\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nAGAPE is a meditation on interdependence. As my father often recites “No man is an island, entire of itself.” These past few months have represented a personal moment of deep introspect and revelations on the things that matter most. To accurately capture that in an image is a lifelong quest, but solemn gestures and tender moments like these offer a useful language on what it means to be together but apart right now.\n\nDanielle Orchard (b. 1985, Michigan City, IN; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nNew Etiquette, 2020\n\nOil on linen\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nIn this work, I contrast objects which relay finite information (the telephone and newspaper) with modes of communicating the ineffable, namely physical touch. The painting also has a few symbols which relate to a shared hope for renewal within our new normal: a budding branch to represent regrowth; a broken bowl, poorly mended, but still in use; and a wine glass with two distinct sets of lipstick marks, suggesting physical intimacy and community.\n\nAnna Ostoya (b. 1978, Krakow, Poland; lives and works in New York, New York)\n\nThank You for _ Here!, 2020\n\nAcrylic paint, archival inkjet print, gold leaf, plastic shopping bags\n\nCourtesy the artist and Bortolami Gallery\n\nIn Thank You for _ Here!, my new composition on canvas, I used images of recent protests in New York together with gold leaf, sanding paper, plastic bags, and acrylic paint to convey the energy of the present moment—the rage over racism and inequality, the pandemic anxiety, and the pre-election unrest. In the center of the composition I set the stars from the American flag into motion towards a more just and greener future.\n\nAnna Park (b. 1996, Daegu, South Korea; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nGoose, 2020\n\nCharcoal on paper\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nI use charcoal as my predominant medium throughout my practice. Allowing the improvisational nature of the marks to dictate the image, my work weaves in and out of representation to abstraction. Goose is a new commission that focuses on the integration of an abstract visual language into my work. The expressive gestures and marks made by charcoal reflect the energy that is the essence of New York City. I have created a drawing that interprets the vitality of the environment through the immediacy of the medium.\n\nGaHee Park (b. 1985, Seoul, South Korea; lives and works in Queens, New York)\n\nStill Life with Living Things, 2020\n\nColored pencil on paper\n\nCourtesy the artist and Galerie Perrotin\n\nSince the pandemic started, I have been walking around Astoria, where I live, and I have been admiring people’s gardens in much greater detail than I had before. This has expanded what I think of as my ‘community’ to include the plants, animals, and insects in my neighborhood.\n\nJamaal Peterman (b. 1990, Fort Lauderdale, FL; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nStill Protesting, 2020\n\nOil paint, sand, and vinyl glitter on canvas\n\nCourtesy the artist and Vigo Gallery, London\n\nThis landscape focuses on a centered structure that represents abundance. The prosperity given by the structure comes from the conduits that meet at access points of information and resources. 8 min and 46 seconds is time expressed in the cement area that serves as a moment of remembrance that sparked another uprising and unrest in the black and brown community. The characters and marks give essence to the individual lives fighting in protest for one cause of social justice. Enough is enough, we demand a change!\n\nKameelah Janan Rasheed ( b. 1985, East Palo Alto, CA; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nPlot Twist, 2020\n\nDigital collage\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nA plot twist can be an offering, an opening. Christina Sharpe’s Monstrous Intimacies: Making Post-Slavery Subjects (2009) includes an epigraph from Dionne Brand’s A Map to the Door of No Return: Notes to Belonging (2001) referencing a line from Derek Walcott’s poem Six Fictions (1997). Walcott writes: “Pray for a life without plot, a day without narrative.” Like Brand who wishes “[t]o be without th[e] story of captivity…”, I hold on to this Walcott line. While I reference relief from plot loops or narrative tropes, we must also consider, as these authors do, what it means to have liberatory relief from narrative itself: to live or sprawl beyond the relationality that reinforces all too familiar subjugation.\n\nEmily Mae Smith (b. 1979, Austin, Texas; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nRevenge of the Flowers, 2020\n\nDigital collage of original oil and watercolor paintings\n\nCourtesy of the artist and Simone Subal Gallery, Perrotin Gallery, Galerie Rodolphe Janssen, and Contemporary Fine Arts Berlin\n\nDuring quarantine I was awestruck by the flora and fauna transforming the city landscape. There were major drops in air pollution levels. Reports of rat adventures appeared in the newspapers. Grasses grew wildly to waist high in former dirt patches. Yellow dandelions dotted ball fields, then turned into snowy puffballs casting off their airborne heads to unknown destinations. In our natural world I found a small respite, a parable, a warning, and a blessing.\n\nCynthia Talmadge (b. 1989, New York, New York; lives and works in New York, New York)\n\nLemon Tree And Household Mail, 2020\n\nInk on paper\n\nCourtesy the artist and 56 HENRY, New York\n\nLemon Tree and Household Mail depicts a decorative metal lemon tree from my living room that I repurposed to air out potentially infectious household mail in the beginning of the pandemic. I noticed that perched among the branches were artifacts from systems in states of dysfunction: a stimulus check, the U.S. census, and a sample ballot for the cancelled (later reinstated) New York Democratic primary. Matches and a scratched tribute at the tree’s base foreshadow combustion.\n\nAdrienne Elise Tarver (b. 1985, USA; lives and works in Atlanta, Georgia and Brooklyn, New York)\n\nManifesting Paradise: High Priestess, 2020\n\nInk, oil pastel, and colored pencil\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nDuring this difficult year, I’ve reflected on my desire to know there is progress and beauty in the future. This woman is based on the High Priestess tarot card—generally about reflection, intuition, and things yet to be revealed. Beyond asking to just matter, the High Priestess knows of greater potential, ventures into unknown futures to discern the symbols and omens among us and decipher the messages that we need to hear in the present.\n\nSalman Toor (b. 1983, Lahore, Pakistan; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nDowntown Boys, 2020\n\nOil on panel\n\n© Salman Toor; Courtesy of the artist and Luhring Augustine, New York\n\nThe painting shows an interior scene of revelry among friends and lovers. The central figure reaches out in a welcoming, serpentine gesture to two embracing figures, their limbs intertwined. Behind them on the lower left side is a tender kiss shared by a couple on a bean bag. With this painting I wanted to summon a sense of closeness and romance in this time without certainties and much isolated self reflection.\n\nAndre D. Wagner (b. 1986, Omaha, Nebraska; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nOld School, Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn NY 2020, 2020\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nAs the city starts to slowly open up, and I was thinking about the themes of reconnection and renewal, I wanted to make a work that felt uplifting. One day I was waiting at a bus stop in Brooklyn when I saw a man I know by the name of “Old School” spinning a basketball on his fingers. Basketball at the parks in the summer is a right of passage for Black boys and men, a way for us to escape and bond. So capturing this moment of joy was both nostalgic and about hope for the future.\n\nD’Angelo Lovell Williams (b. 1992, Jackson, MS; lives and works in Brooklyn, New York)\n\nUndetectable, 2020\n\nDigital photograph\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nThis work shows touch, kinship, and intimacy as aspects of life that are still happening, though they may be publicly disregarded at the moment. I depict people kissing, while wearing protective masks and exhaling smoke. The masks are a part of daily life and the smoke is visible in the air, unlike COVID-19. The idea is about taking the risk to live, even when it can and has resulted in death. I’m Black, gay, and HIV positive. Many of the people in my images are. There is still stigma surrounding HIV, Blackness, and queerness in the wake of the pandemic. With the history of Black and queer narratives in mind, and our altered states of living and interacting, it felt necessary to continue to visualize love in more nuanced ways.\n\nWong Kit Yi (黃潔宜) (b. 1983, Hong Kong; lives and works in New York and Hong Kong)\n\nYes-Jet-Lag / 你好時差, 2020\n\nDigital poster\n\nCourtesy the artist\n\nFor people who travel a lot, jet lag is the very fabric of their everyday reality. But with the pandemic keeping everyone at home, there’s no need to adjust to new time zones. For some, this itself takes some adjusting. Enter Yes-Jet-Lag, the new jet-lag-inducing patch, which turns the intangible jet lag into a household object. It returns you to your normal sense of dislocation in your very own home. At a time when many lack access to health care and the right to be treated equally, this new product balances things out by helping the elite jet-setters feel a bit worse."
