        "text": "Arthur Fenner is one of the earliest English settlers in the area now known as Swan Point Cemetery. His land includes the Slate Rock, the landing spot of Roger Williams. It is near the present Power, Gano, and Williams Streets. He expands his holding to East Manning Street. He names his property \"What Cheer Farm\" after the local traditional Indian greeting \"What Cheer.\" Henry Browne owns a tract near Swan Point that extends west near present-day Cole Avenue. His son Richard and grandsons William and Richard inherit the property which includes two houses--a gambrel-roof brick on the ground of Butler Hospital today and a gable-roof, wooden building known as the Cole Farmhouse at 12 Cole Farm Court.\n\nJune 9: Considered by some as the \"first real blow for freedom\" in the American Revolution as it predates the Boston Tea Party, the Burning of the HMS Gaspee occurs near Warwick. The British Gaspee's commander Lieutenant William Dudingston requires that all other ships lower their flags as a sign of respect. When the colonial vessel HannahÂ refuses, theÂ GaspeeÂ chases it across shallow waters which leaves the British ship stranded on a sandbar. That night, 64 Rhode Islanders board the ship, take the crew prisoners, shoot Dudingston, and set the vessel on fire.\n\nDexter Asylum is established in the will of Ebenezer Knight Dexter who leaves no heirs. Upon his death he leaves his estate \"for the benefit of the poor of Providence\" and stipulates that the family farm be set aside as an \"asylum farm\" for indigents who are former landowners or descendants of landowners. Unlike other asylums which require residents to earn their keep through farm labor, Dexter specifies that hired hands be brought in to work and farm produce that is sold at local markets. The profits are used to run the asylum until 1963 when the land is sold to Brown University and developed into athletic facilities.\n\nThomas Dorr, an elite land owner, and working people without land form the Rhode Island Suffrage Association. Thousands participate in a Providence parade for electoral reform and form a “People’s Convention” to author a constitution without property requirements for voting. In 1842 they organize an election on the new constitution and 14,000 vote for it, a clear majority indicating the new charter should be adopted. However, elite Rhode Islanders fear Dorr's growing strength after he runs in an unofficial election for governor and wins 6,000 votes. The state's governor enlists the promise of federal troops from President John Tyler. On May 3, 1842, Dorr holds an inauguration with a parade. At its end Dorr's \"People's Legislature\" attempts to attack the state arsenal, but its cannon misfires. Dorr flees but is arrested one year later, tried for treason and sentenced to life. His sentence is later reduced after he serves twenty months. In between his attack and ultimate capture, Dorr returns to Rhode Island where hundreds of followers are ready to fight for the People’s Constitution. However, there are thousands in the state's militia ready to defend it. Martial law is declared. One rebel soldier is captured, blind-folded, and placed before a firing squad, which fires blank bullets. A one-hundred person strong militia is taken prisoner. One prisoner describes being bound by ropes into platoons of eight, marched on foot 16 miles to Providence, “threatened and pricked by the bayonet if we lagged from fatigue, the rope severely chafing our arms; the skin off mineâ¦ no water till we reached Greenvilleâ¦ no food until the next dayâ¦ and, after being exhibited, were put into the State prison.”\n\nIn 1846 Thomas C. Hartshorn, an educator and reformer, purchases 59 1/2 acres in North Providence adjacent to the Butler Hospital, which at the time serves as the city limits boundary for Providence. The land is flanked by the Seekonk River on the east. The region is considered swamp land and the first road going through the area in 1684 runs from Dexter's Lane to Morris Avenue and Olney Street. The Providence engineers Atwater and Schubarth plot 109 groups on the land, each averaging 4,000 square feet in area and on October 20, 1846 86 groups are sold, totaling 860 lots, and costing $13,000. It is designed as a \"rural cemetery,\" a concept that emerges from progressive views on public health, nature, and spirituality. The old custom of creating city bound cemeteries is considered unsanitary.\n\n\"All proper persons were admitted on foot on weekdays, but only lot owners and their friends on Sundays. Tickets issued to lot owners were required for the admission of persons in carriages or on horseback. Neither dogs, guns, nor refreshments were allowed within the gates. No smoking on the grounds was prohibited. Visitors were require to 'observe the proprieties of a place consecrated to the tender association of the living with the dead; and abstain from inuring trees and shrubs, not plucking even the violet that springs by the grave of a child; for it is an emblem of immortality, for the consolation of bereavement and sorrow.\"\n\nEARLY RULES: Land owners must place bound stones at the corners of their lots. They are permitted to erect monuments, family vaults and sepulchral monuments at their discretion but cemetery personnel recommend that foundations be built 3 1/2 feet below ground, but the construction of tombs, wholly or in part above ground, is subject to the approval of the board of directors. No wooden fences are allowed around lots. Graves are to be dug and closed by the superintendent but owners can dig graves on their own lots. A charge of seven dollars is made for the construction of a brick or cement grave covered with slate stone. Land for a single grave might be obtained on ground appropriated for the purpose for eight dollars, including digging, closing and sodding. Entombments are permitted in the receiving tomb at no cost to prospective lot purchases for a period of fifteen days, after which a charge is made.\"\n\nThe Board of Directors negotiates with lot owners of the West Burial Ground in order to acquire title to those lands, aggregate seven acres and deed lots in exchange at Swan Point. By 1875, 418 lots are exchanged for lots in older cemeteries and these lots are \"widely scattered through the old portion of the grounds, with concentrated areas in the southeast section between Forest and Side Hill Avenues, in the east section between Beach and Willow Avenues, and in the west section bordering Prospect Avenue.\n\nIn 1878 author Albert J. Wright describes Swan Point Cemetery: \"Of the many interesting and beautiful localities which environ the city of Providence, there is none in which natural scenery is more befitting, none better adapted to the requirements of a sepulchre of the dead, than that comprised within the limits of Swan Point Cemetery. Respect for the dead is one of the noblest attributes of our nature; and the beautiful cemeteries that are being established and consecrated as the final resting-place of the departed, give evidence of the affectionate interest the living cherish in these beautiful repositories of their honored dead. Not upon unknown ground, but in consecrated lots, we lay the bodies of our loved ones, and the hand of affection still scatters fresh flowers over their graves, and, as in life they were the objects of our kindest regard, so are their remains the subject of our dearest thought and tenderest care, in these ever-growing cities of the dead.\n\n\"This lovely spot, secluded from the busy haunts of active life, with its picturesque scenery and boundaries, washed by the beautiful Seekonk River, in whose placid surface is mirrored the giant forms that overhang its wooded shores, forms indeed a fitting place for the repose of the departed. A visit among these sacred altars of the dead, has an influence upon the sentiment of veneration, and serves to harmonize and refine the hearts of the living; for reflection brings the thought, that ere long we, too, will be lying beside the now mouldering relics of what was once so dear to us. May the zeal that has already been manifested, in this enterprise, know no abatement, and all of its varied interests experience no decline.\""
