        "text": "With members of the Massachusetts Department of Corrections Honor Guard serving as bearers, U.S. Army Specialist Matthew Turcotte was laid to rest Saturday.\n\nHis funeral comes ten days after the North Smithfield resident died in a live fire exercise at Fort Carson, Colorado.\n\nThe Mass of Christian Burial was held at the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul in Providence.\n\nAmong the attendees, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo, who ordered flags across Rhode Island this week to half-staff in Turcotte’s honor.\n\n\"The sacrifice is real, people die every day in the service of our nation so we can have our freedom and it's right that we're here today to honor that,\" said Gov. Raimondo.\n\nSpecialist Turcotte joined the Army in 2015, after graduating North Smithfield High school. He had served in Kosovo, and earned many honors during his time in the military, including the Army Achievement Medal and National Defense Service Medal among others.\n\nRhode Island’s Director of Veterans Affairs also attended Saturday’s funeral to recognize Turcotte’s service and ultimate sacrifice.\n\n\"To illustrate the importance of freedom is not free, but our leadership stands side by side together as brothers and sisters, to honor Matthew, to honor his family, to be their support system for them,\" said Kasim Yarn.\n\nTurcotte, 20, leaves behind his wife of less than a year, his parents, sisters, extended family and a community who will never forget."
