        "text": "Old Cemetery\n\nWritten by Eugene Kuykendall\n\nThe Sloatsburg Cemetery dates back over 200 years to when Pvt. John Sloat was buried on a \"grassy knoll' in 1781 (His hand carved fieldstone may be viewed today in the Sloat Family Plot).\n\nBy 1832, this had become the Sloat family burial plot. Jacob and Stephen Sloat, the industrialists and founding fathers of Sloatsburg, are buried here as are their children and grandchildren.\n\nBy 1852, other local families began burials in what is now known as the \"hill section\" of the cemetery.\n\nIn 1878 a Sloatsburg Cemetery Association was formed. From 1878-1936 this Association acquired property, sold and maintained family burial plots.\n\nNearly 1,200 individual headstone inscriptions are to be found today in this approximately 5 acre cemetery, including veterans of all major wars. Perhaps half that many again are known to be buried there without headstones. It remains an active cemetery where a few people still own burial lots. The names on the headstones present a virtual history of the families who founded and populated Sloatsburg.\n\nSince 1936, this cemetery, like many other older burial grounds, has been effectively un-owned, unmanaged, ill-maintained and un-cataloged. Some families continue to provide care for individual family plots, but much of the grounds have become badly overgrown over the years despite several ad-hoc cleanup efforts and unsuccessful attempts to provide for continuing care. Headstones have become weather stained, sunken, fallen and broken, some vandalism has occurred, and other restoration actions are needed.\n\nThe Sloatsburg cemetery is one of the most significant historic sites in Sloatsburg, and, more importantly, the final resting place for many of the early local families. It is located in a secluded wooded area of the village with a stream running nearby. It is in the process of being restored and maintained as an attractive point of pride for our community.\n\nBrown's Gate\n\nWritten by Eugene Kuykendall\n\nThe area above and below the boundary of Orange and western Rockland counties in New York, was a major site of industrial development in the late 1700's and early 1800's. There were three natural contributing factors: Rich Iron ore deposits in the area, timber from the heavily wooded hills as fuel for furnaces, and the Ramapo river to provide water power to run mills and other forms of manufacture. A fourth factor added in the early 1800's was the Orange Turnpike and the Nyack Turnpike that permitted transporting goods to the Hudson river for shipment to markets in New York City.\n\nA common approach utilized by early entrepreneurs in utilizing the river to provide water power was to select one of the wider and deeper sections of the river, construct a dam to raise the water level creating a pond behind the dam, and build a sluice gate to regulate the flow of water from the elevated pond into a rapidly moving stream of water. This stream of water, generally referred to as mill races, would be channeled to a paddle wheel at a nearby mill operation to drive early mills, forges and other forms of manufacturing. Examples in this area include the following three:\n\nAs early as 1792, Isaac Sloat built such a system to power a saw mill and a tannery in what became the village of Sloatsburg in northeastern Rockland county. Isaac's son, Jacob Sloat, built a textile mill at that site in the early 1800's. This \"Sloat Mill\" was expanded over the years into a major textile factory and continued in operation until it was destroyed by fire in 1955. The dam and sluice gate were obviously rebuilt from what would have originally been a stone and wood structure to a cement structure during the mid 1800's. The \"Mill Race\" was filled in after a local girl drowned there, but its path and culvert under the Erie Railroad tracks remain visible. All remains of the \"Sloat Mill\" were razed by a potential land developer.\n\nAround 1795, Benjamin Pierson and his sons began constructing a similar and even larger system for powering nail making and later other iron products at \"Ramapo Works\" now the hamlet of Ramapo just south of Sloatsburg. Ramapo Works , under the Pierson family, grew to be a major employer, many of whose employees lived in company built homes in the current hamlet of Ramapo.\n\nAround 1800, Abraham Dater built a system for powering the first of six iron forges in an area first known as \"Dater's Works\". The Iron forges and subsequent grist mill and saw mill of the Dater family and the community of workers they created, became the hamlet of \"Pleasant Valley\" in the 1800's and, by the early 1900's, annexed to become part of the village of Sloatsburg, still known popularly as \"Upper Sloatsburg\".\n\nIt is interesting that only the earliest system, that of Isaac Sloat, remains virtually intact today.\n\nKnapps's Dam\n\nThe mystery of Knapp’s Dam in Sloatsburg.\n\nThe Ramapo River provided waterpower to drive the mills and forges of early industry in Sloatsburg. We can still see today Sloat's Pond Dam, Sluice Gate and Millrace just behind the O&R sub-station. The remains of Dater's Dam can also be seen just North of Dater's Bridge.\n\nWhen Sloatsburg's premier historian, Clarence Conklin, told me that Hiram Knapp also had a dam to power his Shoddy Mill (shoddy is a cheap form of cotton used for packing) that was new news-- I had never seen reference to it before. The old shoddy mill of the early 1800's was located on the site of what is now the Sterling Stone Company, just north of Seven Lakes Drive on Route 17.\n\nI walked the river and the property trying to find some sign of an early dam or millrace. I could find no signs whatsoever of any dam foundation along the sides of the Ramapo River. There is a culvert on the grounds under the RR track, well below ground level and completely filled in. Why was there only one culvert under the RR? There should have been two, one to conduct the water to the mill and a second to return the water to the river. More importantly, the ground level immediately to the west, where the mill was located is significantly higher than the level of the river. How could water flow uphill to power the mill? Was even Clarence Conklin capable of being mistaken? I had never known that to happen before.\n\nShortly thereafter, Craig Long, Ramapo Town Historian, let me copy a 1916 map of Sloatsburg in the possession of Suffern Museum. Lo-and-behold, that map shows three dams within Sloatsburg, all unlabeled. Clearly one is Sloat's Dam, another to the north is Dater's Dam and the third is in the right location to be Knapp's Dam.\n\nIn the absence of Clarence who had returned to Ohio, I conferred with Fred Waldron. Fred confirmed the existence of Knapp's Dam and explained the credibility problems I had observed, i.e.:\n\nThe area west of the Ramapo River was originally at the same level as the river allowing a millrace to run from the river to the Knapp's mill. When the Orange Turnpike was widened, dirt excavated for the project was used as fill to raise the area that had been the site of Knapp's Mill.\n\nThe stone foundation of Knapp's Dam has been completely eliminated by the wear of time and floods. Fred Waldron remembers as a child seeing remains of both Dater's and Knapp's Dam in the form of large timbers piled up along the banks of the river. The larger dams of Sloat and Pierson were originally built of stone and reinforced with concrete in the mid-1800's. The smaller dams of Dater and Knapp were constructed of heavy timbers cut square and anchored to the stone foundations on the riverbanks. Those timbers have long ago rotted and been swept away during flood periods.\n\nThe culvert still visible today, was the inlet for the millrace providing power to a paddle wheel at the damp located just south of the culvert. The millrace continued to flow south to a collecting pond then back under the RR through a second culvert. Today, the return culvert is completely covered over and it's exact location unknown.\n\nKnapp's Shoddy Mill was a major employer of Sloatsburg residents during the 1800's. A large bell at the mill sounded starting time and quitting time. That bell can still be heard every Sunday morning. It was a gift from the Knapp family to the Sloatsburg Methodist Church."
