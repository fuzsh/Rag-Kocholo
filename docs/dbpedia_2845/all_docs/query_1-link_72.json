        "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - Take One: Temps rise for practice 11\n\nThe Saints returned to work for practice 11 and were back in pads for the sixth time of camp. Though the conditions in California have been close to perfect, Monday may have been the hottest practice to date.\n\nThe team once again battled through 2.5 hours of work and put in four team periods. One of those periods was a 2-minute drill, where the team practiced an end of game situation down two points.\n\nTake Two: Rattler’s reps increase\n\nJake Haener had to miss Monday’s workout with a skin cancer procedure. With him out, Rattler took the second and third team reps and had one of his best practices to date.\n\nHe completed his first seven passes before Sampson Nacua dropped a drag route that would have been a big gain. He only threw two more incompletions after that all day.\n\nIn the process, Rattler flashed the arm talent that everyone knows he possesses. He converted two fourth downs with big-time throws. The first came during the first team period when he hit Marquez Callaway on a bootleg for 20 yards.. The next came during the third team period when he fired a dart to Mason Tipton on an out route for 12 yards.\n\nIn the two-minute drill, Rattler hit his first three attempts with the biggest going to Michael Jacobsen for 20 yards on skinny post. Three plays later, he had the offense in game-winning field goal range, but Blake Grupe hit the 46-yarder off the upright.\n\nIt was a good day for Rattler and one that he needed in the ultra competitive backup quarterback competition.\n\nDennis Allen said after practice that right now the team is trying to determine if they have a backup quarterback currently on the roster. It felt like a subtle challenge for both Rattler and Haener as the preseason gets closer.\n\nTake Three: Attendance Report\n\nTaysom Hill and Tyrann Mathieu were both back after veteran rest days. Alvin Kamara missed practice with a veteran rest day.\n\nNathan Shepherd and Payton Turner both returned after missing Sunday’s work.\n\nDemario Davis, Marshon Lattimore, Pete Werner, Equanimous St. Brown, Rashid Shaheed, Nick Saldiveri, Bub Means and Paulson Adebo didn’t practice.\n\nJuwan Johnson and Jaylan Ford were working with trainers off to side.\n\nTake Four: Top Plays\n\nTeam #1\n\nCarr and Olave connected on three straight passes for 12 yards. The longest was a 12-yard completion on an out.\n\nCarr misfired high on a throw to Mason Tipton, Shemar Jean-Charles was there for the interception.\n\nLinebacker Khaleke Hudson blew up a screen pass to James Robinson from Rattler.\n\nTeam #2\n\nWillie Gay, Jr. had back-to-back stuffs of Jamaal Williams on run plays.\n\nChase Young destroyed a pop pass to Taysom Hill for a big loss.\n\nWill Harris and Isaiah Foskey teamed for a TFL on a Robinson run.\n\nThere was a controversy when Khalen Saunders broke through the line to get to Rattler. He celebrated like he sacked him, but the offense believed Rattler got the ball off to Cedrick Wilson for a huge gain.\n\nTeam #3\n\nCarr hit Olave on a shallow cross for a first down on a third down play.\n\nGay stopped Hill for a loss on an end around.\n\nCarr hit Olave, who popped wide open on a double move for a 45 yard gain.\n\nCarl Granderson ran a twist up front and sacked Rattler. Niko Lalos did the same off the edge on a third down attempt by Rattler.\n\nTeam #4 (2-minute) The situation was end of game, offense down two with 1:15 on the clock.\n\nCarr opened with three straight completions, then missed two more to set up a 4th&4 with 22 seconds left. Carr and Olave both read blitz, and they connected on a hot route over the middle to move the chains.\n\nAfter a short run, the offense nearly experienced a disaster when the ball slipped out of Jordan Mims’ hands when he was trying to spot the ball. Fortunately, they were able to clock it with one second remaining.\n\nGrupe closed things out with a 48-yard field goal for the win.\n\nTake Five: Other Observations\n\nGrupe went 8/10 Monday and even hit a 61-yarder. He also missed that end of game 46-yarder and another earlier in practice. Allen said he’d like to see more consistency out of both kickers.\n\nMichael Jacobsen is a name that keeps showing up at tight end with the second team.\n\nThe Saints take the day off Tuesday before returning to work Wednesday for practice #12.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
