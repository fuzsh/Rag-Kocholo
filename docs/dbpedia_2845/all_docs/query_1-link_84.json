Rehabbing LHP DL Hall continues to pitch with impact - if unspectacularly. Perhaps, I am expecting too much, but my eyes continue to tell me the heater just isn't moving enough. The velo is sitting 94-95 mph and touching 96 mph (hitting 96.3 mph tonight). BUT, by my middle-aged eyes tell me it still isn't finding consistent ride or movement of the kind that will consistently make MLB bats miss. I count one single outing in his entire rehab tenure where I felt Hall was absolutely cooking with gas. Is this a problem? I don't really know. But, I'm a Brewers fan by nature so, inherently, despite my propensity for optimism I find things to worry about. Tonight, in a mostly successful 4 IP allowing 2 H, 2 BB, 1 HB, 3 K, 1 ER, 1 HR Hall still only mustered two swings and misses on the four-seamer he threw 47% of the time. The off-speed offerings - the change-up, slider, and curveball - continue to garner the most praise from my seat. Five swings and misses on 14 total swings. For a player who arrived with a reputation for filthy heat, I have yet to see anything of any consistency in 2024 that would indicate such. What I do see, however, is a player who could consider leading with his off-speed tool-kit. Until, of course, Hall begins touching those four-seamer peripherals we've only seen with fleeting glimpses. Look at me, the swivel chair pitching coach! Who says a man can't evolve as he ages?!?\n\nThree Quick Strikes:\n\n1) RHP JB Bukauskas is getting healthier and I'm here for it. He pitched an extremely efficient 12-pitch relief inning allowing zero hits, walks, runs or base runners. He grabbed one strikeout while managing to hold all exit velocities 94 mph and below. He is now scoreless in three straight relief outings since being brought back to the Sounds to continue his rehab work. Don't forget, this is a proven MLB caliber relief arm who can give the Brewers a lively 94-95 mph sinker with a low 80's slider. He uses this combination to very good impact. He has now gone three consecutive outings for the Sounds without surrendering a single run, a single walk, and only one hit. This is a fantastic peripheral development.\n\n2) I mentioned in the day's Minor League Game Thread (HERE) and, well let's be honest I've been saying this since he's been a Sound, C Brian Navarreto just continues to execute in clutch moments. He knocked aboard the Sounds game-tying run early and their go-ahead run late. His offensive peripherals pretty much stink so far in 2024 but that's a 99 AB sample size after a prolonged injury absence lasting the majority of the first half. He's a catcher splitting duties. The defense will always be a major plus. But, it's his ability to consistently rise to the occasion when it matters most that gets so overlooked. He's been doing this since joining the Brewers organization. I continue to love watching him play the game of baseball.\n\n3) There are ample storylines to run with here - 3B Tyler Black looked solid tonight at the hot corner making the right plays and the right reads with an accurate arm and a sure glove for the vast majority of the game. The offense as a whole was dynamite so be sure to peruse that box score and check the highlights adorning the Nashville Sounds twitter page. But, in the end, all roads point to the continued fantastic output we are seeing from the recently DFA'd INF Owen Miller - 3-for-4, 3 R, 1 RBI, 1 2B. Just a month after hitting 0.392 over 51 Triple-A AB, Miller is back to hitting 0.294 over 17 AB in August. As soon as those gap strokes start arriving that OPS will be rising back as well. In the recent push for a second half with possible playoff implications, no single player has played a larger part in this push than Miller. Gone from the Brewers dugout (for now) but certainly not forgotten. Special nod to CF Chris Roller as well who had a really solid game overall making plays all over the OF grass in a 1-for-3, 2RBI, 2 K, 1 SF effort.\n\nFinal: Biloxi 6, Montgomery (Rays) 3\n\nMartin's Ninth-Inning Triple Lifts Shuckers to Fifth Straight Comeback Win - Boeve Homers in Third Straight\n\nBox Score / Game Log\n\nPre-Game Media Notes\n\nThe Shuckers are absolutely giving us a fantastic second half of baseball - this was our thread of hope as we all endured that challenging first half and, better yet, we knew it was possible. Credit to the players, the coaching staff, and the entire organization for staying with it in this recent push. Clarke, Misiorowski, Yoho, and Carlos D. Rodriguez all sent North to Nashville? No problem. Depth is the answer and free agent pick-ups leaving their marks.\n\nLHP Nate Peterson continues to struggle outing-to-outing in and around the zone. For a young lefty with as much ride on his heater as he is capable of and with a decent set of off-speed deliveries, it really is about execution and failed location. I continue to be confused by the way he sets his pitch mix up within his outings - I am not blaming any party here other than to say it's all just a few ticks off. Peterson simply has a propensity for hanging pitches and he rarely gets away with it. Tonight wasn't all that much different tho the results were palatable and certainly helped keep his team within striking distance despite being knocked around a bit - 3 2/3 IP, 4 H, 2 BB, 1 K, 2 ER. He began the year as a starting pitcher, however Peterson hasn't pitched more than 3 2/3 innings in over two months. Due to recent promotions, at least in the near term, he is being asked to play the part of a fill-in piggy back arm it would appear (much like LHP Adam Seminaris in the current context of the Shuckers pitching staff). It has been a bend but don't break strategy to date as he has allowed a monthly BAA of 0.273 or higher every month since May. Thankfully, the Shuckers have pretty darn good bullpen to lean on as they look to keep a tight grip on first place. They remain 3.0 G ahead of second place Pensacola at 22-11 overall after tonight's game one road 'W'.\n\nThree Quick Strikes:\n\n1) He was mentioned in my headline. He was mentioned in the Shuckers' post-game write-up. Let us enjoy a moment of Zen together:\n\nPlease just stay healthy, Mr. Boeve. And, please, just keep hitting bombs 😂. What an unreal return from the IL we are in the midst of.\n\n2) INF/OF Casey Martin has been an integral part of two Shuckers comebacks over the course of the past week. He hit an absolutely clutch three-run bomb at Home last week. He hit the crucial triple to straightaway center field tonight to grab the Shuckers lead for good. AND, he did this as an emergency replacement for lead-off CF Dylan O'Rae who was tossed after arguing strikes after his second strikeout. You absolutely love to see players rise to the occasion in key moments - it's a boon to the entire team and it validates playing time when the overall production picture isn't all that noteworthy (that's putting it politely in this case). Keep at it, Mr. Martin. These are huge moments. It has been a joy to watch you meet them. Pay attention to the highlight on the left:\n\n3) Despite the exodus of RHP Craig Yoho, I continue to believe in the overall solidity of the Shuckers bullpen. They may not have their 'any scenario' shutdown Ace in the fold, but they do have a stable of bulldogs who truly compete inning-to-inning. The Shuckers pen, mind you, has a 30-23 record over 99 games. They have saved 24-of-30 opportunities. They have pitched 421 2/3 innings with 494 K-to-136 BB holding a 3.31 ERA. They are just a solid solid group. Tonight it was the combined efforts from unsung stallions RHP Nick Merkel (2 1/3 IP, 2 H, 1 BB, 1 HB, 4k, 1 ER), RHP Sam Gardner (2.0 IP, 0 H, 1 BB, 3 K, 1 W), and RHP Justin Yeager (1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 BB, 1 K, 1 SV - his 14th in 2024). I do wonder aloud: will RHP Aaron Rund ultimately get the call up from Wisconsin to further solidify the Shuckers staff? Regardless, they continue to thrive as a group and I am here to shine that light.\n\nFinal:Quad Cities (Royals) 5, Wisconsin 0\n\nQuad Cities Shuts Out Wisconsin - Rattlers Held Scoreless for Just the Second Time in 2024\n\nBox Score / Game Log\n\nPre-Game Media Notes\n\nThat's two consecutive series opener stinkers I've been party to over the past two weeks. No bueno! The Shuckers were outhit 8-to-5 but they absolutely had their chances to make this a competitive game. An 0-for-8 RISP mark adorned with 10 men LOB certainly didn't do them any favors. The Rattlers bats also struck out 11 times with three apiece for lead-off man CF Luis Lara and 3B Eduardo Garcia. The only true bright spot in this entire affair was the healthy return of SS Cooper Pratt and his consequent barrage of different doubles in a 3-for-3, 3 2B night. The sky is the limit here, folks. Truly.\n\nOn the pitching side of things, RHP's Patricio Aquino will lament his inability to execute in key spots - the two out run in the first and the two run bomb in the third were all a result of failed execution in his 4 2/3 IP of 6 H, 2 BB, 1 WP, 3 K, 1 HR, 3 ER work. He fell to 3-4 on his season. RHP Tyler Wehrle will lament his four free passes overall but his two walks to open the eighth inning in what was an otherwise solid game-finishing relief effort - 3 1/3 IP, 2 H, 4 BB, 6 K, and 2 ER. I'll tip the cap to Mr. Wehrle for helping preserve his bullpen mates. Lastly, we'll have to monitor the lineup cards over the next couple days - Midwest League Player of the Month award winner 1B Luke Adams stayed in the game but he was hit by a pitch directly off his lead left knee. He was in clear pain but, again, he never exited the game and finished the contest. It may be something that provokes a need to rest and ice for a game or two. It may be absolutely nothing for the man child. Let's toss this anomalous final result in the trash and move on to game two.\n\nFinal: Carolina 15, Fredericksburg (Nationals) 5\n\nBox Score / Game Log\n\nMudcats Rout Fredericksburg in Series Opener - Early 7-0 Lead Set the Tone for a Blowout\n\nRHP Manuel Rodriguez certainly didn't have one of his better outings of his 2024 season and his final line tells you just how incredible his season has been: 4 IP, 5 H, 1 BB, 4 K, 0 R. It was his first start since back on May 15th he didn't pitch into the fifth inning. Of the 11 Rodriguez starts since that May 15th outing, Rodriguez has thrown seven Quality Starts. Absurd. So, forgive me if I'm still going to give this young hurler some shine. He was also victim to some absurdly bad luck on some goose snorts to the shallow right field grass. Regardless, he gave his team everything it needed to protect their early seven-run lead. He remains one my absolute favorite storylines of the greater 2024 season.\n\nThree Quick Strikes:\n\n1) On to the Bitonti (2-for-5, 2 R, 4 RBI, 1 BB, 2 K, 1 HR, 1 2B) long ball fireworks. As alluded to above: we are seeing some uncanny power, not to mention an easy smooth level swing, the likes of which we haven't seen in the system in quite some time. Just take a look at this 430 foot bomb to one of the deeper portions of any park in the Carolina League. This just isn't an easy place to hit a ball in Fredericksburg. Sure, it was aided some by the swirling winds toward left field, but I still proclaim this is a mammoth shot:\n\n2) There is plenty to look over in that Mudcats box score but special mention should got to CF Yophery Rodriguez (3-for-5, 2 R, 1 BB, 2 2B, 1 RBI) and 3B Juan Baez (2-for-5, 2 R, 3 RBI, 2 K, 1 3B). Rodriguez absolutely set the tone for the day with a first inning lead-off first pitch rocket to the wall in RF. It was an absolute dart. That knock literally started it all. Kudos to Baez for continuing to provide that oh so valuable bat-to-ball contact lumber in the those crucial top of the order spots. What's more? Baez hasn't caused an out on the base paths in at least two contests!🤭\n\n3) Kudos to RHP Morris Austin who came aboard with the 10-0 lead. He pitched an effective 3 1/3 IP allowing 3 H, 2 BB with 5 K and 1 ER allowed. He was a steady force helping bridge the game to RHP Jeison Pena. Oh, Mr. Pena. In some respects, with such a vast lead you are simply looking for your reliever to throw strikes. And, this Pena did. However, given the greater context of Pena's time as a Mudcat you can't help but worry his 1 2/3 IP of 5 H, 2 K, 4 ER work may lead to a possible period of ineffective relief appearances. I'll defer to optimism after the blow out: he pounded the zone and took some runs for his team. The Mudcats moved to 21-15 in the second half only 1.5 GB the Fred Nats (though, we all know that really doesn't matter given the playoff spot already secured).\n\n**Special Shout Out to RF Luis Castillo who, fresh off his Carolina League Player of the Month award, impacted the game in an entirely different way: three walks and zero punch outs. You have to love a player taking what is given - especially after such an illustrious award!\n\nFinal: DSL Cleveland Goryl 7, DSL Brewers #1 2 (Monday 8/5)\n\nBox Score / Game Log\n\nThe DSL Cerveceros Uno took a 1-0 lead into the fifth frame. It all fell apart from there as the Goryl scored seven runs over the next three frames. The Crew Uno did manage to steal a run back in the eighth but that was all she wrote. The real sucker punch appears to have been a first pitch bases loaded inside the park grand slam to right field with two outs in the top of the seventh. Ouch! INF's Luis Pena (2-for-4, 1 RBI, 1 K) and Jesus Made (1-for-3, 1 R, 2 BB, 1 K) continued to do their impressive thing atop the DSL Brewers #1 batting order. On this morning it was not enough. On the pitching side of things, 18-year-old Venezuelan RHP Gabriel Colmenarez brought a shutout into the fifth frame (1 H, 1 K, 3 BB, 1 ER) but he was pulled after walking the lead-off batter. Dominican 19-year-old RHP Linbel Jimenez came on in relief and really struggled in his single frame: 1.0 IP, 1 H, 2 BB, 2 WP, 1 K, 2 ER. Three runs scored overall and the Goryl never looked back. Panamanian 17-year-old RHP Manuel Moreno surrendered the inside the parker but in a successful season overall we'll tip the cap for salvaging further damage to the Uno's bullpen going 4.0 IP of 4 H, 2 BB, 3 K, 1 HR, 4 ER work. It was a rough way to start the DSL week but things got better on Tuesday.\n\nFInal: DSL Brewers #1 4, DSL Pirates Black 3 (Make-up Game from July 16th)\n\nBox Score / Game Log\n\nSpecial credit to my wing man, @Jim Goulart, for offering up the following:\n\n*Just a reminder that box score lines will reflect stats through 6/16\"\n\nA Luis Pena RBI triple was followed by a Juan Martinez RBI single to give Team Uno a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the 1st.\n\nAn eventful top of the 2nd saw the Pirates first batter of the inning reach on a third strike wild pitch by Panamanian 17-year-old RHP Manuel Moreno, who has posted a 1.04 WHIP in his debut season. The very next batter doubled, but a 9-4-2 relay threw out that runner at the plate on a questionable send with none out. The very next man up clubbed a two-run HR, and there was additional action that inning, but Moreno limited the damage.\n\nThe Cervecero Prime retook the lead on a Ludwin Tejeda sacrifice fly and then the game was called on the 16th after that 2nd frame.\n\nUpon resumption Tuesday AM, new pitcher Ayendy Bravo, the 17-year-old Dominican RHP andnewly recognized for his outstanding month of July, did allow a triple to the first man he faced in the 3rd, allowing the tying run on an RBI double two batters later. But bravo to Bravo, who completed four innings without allowing another run.\n\nIt remained tied until the bottom of the 6th of this seven-inning affair as normally light-hitting 2nd-year LF Joan Gutierrez smacked a one-out line drive RBI single. The run was unearned thanks to an error by the Pirates shortstop earlier in the inning. It was a perfect day for Gutierrez who walked in his prior two at-bats and added a stolen base.\n\n18-year-old Nicaraguan RHP Ranwell Smith was brought on to close the game, and immediately walked the first two men he faced, A successful sacrifice bunt made things ominous, but Smith wrapped things up with a huge strikeout and then a flyout to left.\n\nFinal: DSL Brewers #1 2, DSL Pirates Black 1\n\nBox Score / Game Log\n\nAfter completing the earlier comeback, the Crew were in a 0-0 deadlocked battle until the top of the sixth inning when they plated both of their two winning runs. Despite DH Luis Pena's 15th double of his season earlier in the contest in his 1-for-3, 1 BB, 1 K day at the dish, it was unsung 17-year-old 1B Yohandy Cruz who poked a bases loaded two-run single to center field in his 2-for-3, 2 RBI, 1 K day at the plate. Those proved to be the winning runs. In a game where the Crew Uno outhit the Pirates Black 6-to-3, you can imagine there certainly weren't all that many offensive fireworks in the box score. However, on the pitching side of things there are several lines worth mentioning in the scheduled seven inning contest. Starter, Mexican 17-year-old RHP Carlos Carra kept his walks manageable with his 4.0 IP of 1 H, 2 BB, 6 K, 0 R innings - a very good sign and hopefully a springboard to close his season with a wee bit more control despite solid bottom line ongoing results. Two-way LHP Idalberto Santiesteban gave two crucial middle innings of 1 H, 1 BB, 2 K, 0 R innings - as he looks to continue his path on the mound he is showing signs of subtle improvements. Finally, Mexican 18-year-old RHP Ruben Saldana worked around a lead-off triple, a walk, and a wild pitch to grab all three outs by way of strikeout securing the 2-1 DSL Brewers Uno victory and picking up his first Save in the process. The DSL Cerveceros Uno moved within 1.5 G of the first place DSL Orioles Orange and sit at an official record of 28-15.\n\nFinal: DSL Brewers #2 6, DSL Dodgers Mega 4 (Completion of August 1st Suspended Game)\n\nBox Score / Game Log\n\nSpecial credit once again to my wing man, @Jim Goulart, for offering up the following:\n\nThe Dodgers' first run scored on a wild pitch in the first inning, and that 1-0 score after two innings carried over to Tuesday.\n\nWhen play resumed, we had the professional debut of 18-year-old 6'3\" Dominican RHP Miqueas Mercedes. The young man retired the first two men he faced before a walk, HBP, wild pitch and a three-run blast. Welcome to the pro's. That would be Mercedes' lone inning, better days to come.\n\nWhat's that you say, a 4-0 deficit heading to the bottom of the 5th in a seven-inning contest? Have no fear, as Team Dos put up two in the 5th and a four-spot in the 6th for the win.\n\nThat 5th inning saw four singles for the good guys, three coming with two outs.\n\n17-year-old Venezuelan catcher (aren't all backstops Venezuelan?) Luis Corobo clubbed his 4th home run to kick off the 6th inning rally. Two additional 17-year-old's, 3B Roderick Flores (two-run single) and 2B Jonathan Rangel (RBI single for an insurance run) had sweet games from the bottom of the order.\n\nNicaraguan RHP Josue Toledo was huge coming in after Mercedes' one-inning debut, as he tossed four scoreless to net the well-deserved win, which he closed out himself in the top of the 7th.\n\nFinal: DSL Brewers #2 3, DSL Dodgers Mega 2\n\nBox Score / Game Log\n\nWith the DSL Cerveceros Uno winning a 2-1 nail biter of their own in their game two, it was the DSL Cerveceros Dos turn upping the ante and winning a 3-2 game of their own to close out a 4-0 Tuesday in the DSL Brewers ledger. How sweet it is! Tied 2-2 in the late innings, it was an LF Angel Gonzalez (2-for-3, 1 RBI) single to right field that scored the go-ahead run in C Yoeniker Lugo from second base. It pays to have a catcher with some wheels as Lugo took second base after reaching by error for his fifth SB of his summer. Nicaraguan 17-year-old RHP Lonell Downs secured the victory working around a two out walk by striking out his final batter in a 4.0 IP, 1 H, 3 BB, 6 K, 1 ER effort. He ultimately picked up the victory and is 2-1 on the summer but he did also get the 'Blown Save' when allowing his sole run. It was his first such squandered opportunity. Will we see another OF Jose Anderson long ball after being so thrilled throughout most of the summer? I don't know. His last long ball was on July 15th. He went 1-for-3 today with 2 K and 1 SB. DH Jorge Quintana picked up his 10th double of his summer in a 1-for-3, 2 RBI performance - those two RBI's were obviously quite important and they came with two out. The DSL Brewers Dos, winners of four straight, moved to 24-19 on their summer and they've moved within 5.5 G of the first place DSL Cleveland Goryl. It's a nice little run they are on!\n\nThat was certainly a long and beautiful day of Brewers Minor League baseball. If we count the Big League club Brewers, we witnessed an 8-1 mark as a whole. What a time to be a Brewers fan! Let's not take any of these days filled with victories for granted. Tomorrow, I guess I'll have to watch the four full-season affiliates who are a combined 61 games above 0.500. SIXTY-ONE. Ooops, I must have hit the 'caps lock' button😁. These games will all be evening tilts which sets me for an epic night as a pseudo-bachelor - the wife and daughter are headed to the Washington Coast. RHP Daniel Corniel, LHP Mark Manfredi, RHP Jacob Misiorowski, and RHP Brett Wichrowski will be taking the hill for their respective ball clubs. I for one am very curious to see how Misiorowski comes back for his second outing after being exposed to the Triple-A Nashville coaching staff. The first Nashville outing certainly wasn't all that pretty.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading and thanks for supporting Milwaukee Brewers Minor League baseball and the many players deserving of our time and recognition.\n\nOrganizational Scoreboard including starting pitcher info, game times, MiLB TV links, and box scores\n\nCurrent Milwaukee Brewers Organization Batting Stats and Depth\n\nCurrent Milwaukee Brewers Organization Pitching Stats and Depth\n\nInterested in learning more about the Milwaukee Brewers' top prospects?
