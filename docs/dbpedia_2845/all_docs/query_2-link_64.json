        "text": "Concetta 'Connie' Razza, 89, passed away peacefully, surrounded by her loving family on Wednesday November 21 at the Philip Hulitar Hospice Center in Providence, RI. She was the beloved wife of the late Joseph Razza, her partner, best friend and the love of her life, who passed on September 3, 2018.\n\nBorn in Providence, she was the daughter of the late Carmine and Anna Del Vicario Calitri. She was a resident of Warwick for 53 years.\n\nFor 48 years Connie worked side by side with her husband Joe at the Raz-Mer Casting and Royal Plating Companies, founded by her husband in 1952. Prior to that, she was employed at Davol Rubber Company.\n\nShe leaves a daughter Susan Folco and son William Razza, two grandchildren Maribeth Zoglio and her husband Timothy, and Andrew Razza and his wife Georgia, all of Warwick, RI. She also leaves a sister; Marie Harrop and her husband James of Warwick, RI, two brothers; Louis Calitri and his wife Lucille of Lincoln, RI and Carmine Calitri of Warwick, RI. She was the sister of the late Antoinette Therault and husband Robert, Jeannette Philips and husband Henry, and Domenic Calitri and his wife Irene. She was the mother-in-law of the late Charles Folco.\n\nConnie was a strong, thoughtful and loving woman who devoted her life to her family and friends. She blessed those around her with her warm smile and her gentle and selfless acts of kindness. She provided comfort to those in struggle and never met anyone who was not welcome in her home or at her table. She mended their clothing as well as their hearts. Connie loved to travel with her husband and when she was not traveling you could find her in the kitchen cooking, baking and serving up love and warmth to all.\n\nHer funeral will be held Tuesday at 8:45 am from the Thomas and Walter Quinn Funeral Home, 2345 Warwick Avenue, Warwick, with a Mass of Christian Burial at 10am in St. Benedict's Church, Beach Avenue, Warwick, RI.
