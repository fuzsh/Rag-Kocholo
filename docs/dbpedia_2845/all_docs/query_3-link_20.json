        "text": "Politician, attorney and reformer, Dorr’s family owned the Bernon Mills, a textile mill in Woonsocket. Dorr was best known for his role in The People’s Convention, a group pushing for a new state constitution, and the Dorr Rebellion, a short-lived movement (1841-1843) led by Dorr to abolish property requirements for the right to vote. In 1843, after an unsuccessful attempt to change the constitution by an armed insurrection, Dorr was arrested, tried for treason and sentenced to life in prison with hard labor. After serving 20 months, he was pardoned and released. His civil rights were restored in 1851.\n\nJesse Metcalf’s wife, she founded the Rhode Island School of Design. She was praised as a benefactor of the poor, even extending generosity to striking workers at her husband’s company.\n\nDescendants of the Metcalfs include a United States Senator and publishers of the Providence Journal.\n\nA prominent banker, industrialist, U.S. Army officer, state senator and philanthropist, Robert Hale Ives Goddard was the son of Professor William Giles Goddard and Charlotte Rhoda Ives Goddard. Born in Providence, he was a graduate of Brown University. After leaving Brown, he began his business career with the Goddard Brothers, a Lonsdale, R.I. textile manufacturing firm. Goddard served with distinction in the Union Army in the Civil War, attaining the rank of Colonel. In 1865 at the end of the war, he resigned from the army and served as a military aide to four governors from 1874-1883. In 1870, Goddard married Rebekah Burnet Groesbeck of Cincinnati, Ohio. Together they had two sons and a daughter. Goddard served in the RI Senate from 1907-1908 as a member of the finance committee and as chairman of the education committee. He was a director of the RI Hospital Trust Company and owned a controlling interest in the Providence and Worcester Railroad. In 1927, Goddard’s family deeded his 489-acre estate in Warwick, RI to the state of RI. It is now the grounds of the Goddard Memorial State Park.\n\nCo-founder of Ostby and Barton Jewelers of Providence, Ostby was born in 1847 in Oslo, Norway, where he worked as a successful jeweler. In 1869, he emigrated to America and settled in Providence. In addition to being recognized as a successful businessman (Ostby and Barton became the world’s largest producer of gold rings), Ostby was well-known in Providence for his charitable acts. He was also a director of the High Street Bank and the Industrial Trust Company and a trustee of Citizens Savings Bank. Ostby and his wife Lizzy Macy (Webster) Ostby had 4 sons and a daughter. After his wife’s death at age 45, Ostby raised his youngest children with the help of his mother. In January 1912, Ostby and his 22 year-old daughter Helene traveled to Europe to take a vacation and survey the European jewelry markets. While in France, they boarded the Titanic as first-class passengers to make their journey back to America. After the ship collided with an iceberg, Ostby went back to his room to get warmer clothes for himself and his daughter. In the meantime, Helene was forced to board a lifeboat and survived. Her father’s body was subsequently recovered and identified in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was buried at Swan Point Cemetery on May 11, 1912. When Helene died in 1978 at the age of 89, she was buried close to her father.\n\nOften credited as H.P. Lovecraft, Howard Phillips Lovecraft was an American author of horror, fantasy and science fiction. Born in Providence in 1890, the son of Winfield Scott Lovecraft and Sarah Susan Phillips Lovecraft, he is regarded as one of the most influential horror writers of the 20th century. Lovecraft died in 1937 at the age of 46 and was laid to rest in the Phillips family lot at Swan Point Cemetery. Lovecraft, along with his parents, is listed on the Phillips family monument. In 1977, a group of loyal Lovecraft fans raised money to buy him a headstone of his own on which they had inscribed Lovecraft’s name, the dates of his birth and death, and the phrase “I AM PROVIDENCE,” a line from one of his personal letters."
