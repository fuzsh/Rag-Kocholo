        "text": "Visiting from Michigan, my sister and I decided to get some breakfast before leaving and stopped at this place. I cannot tell you how much this food tasted like home and sitting at my Ma's table. It was so good we came back a second time. We got sides of the corn beef hash and home fries because of how good it was. They make it all home made, corn beef hash was probably my favorite and the hot sauce was home made as well, sweet and tangy with a good zip at the end, and they actually put cuts of the corn beef into it. Got a Eastern egg breakfast sandwich and it will be my new go to when visiting. Nothing bad what so ever would always recommend to a passer by and friends. Cheers!\n\nSo today my husband took me to Louis for the first time and may I just say the food was delicious. Service was great and on top of everything I loved all the photos and art it made the place feel like home."
