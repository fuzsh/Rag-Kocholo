        "text": "Iris Marie (Ferreira) McDonald, a cherished resident of North Providence, passed away peacefully on Thursday, May 2, 2024, at the age of 97. She was surrounded by the love of her family as she reunited with her husband, Joe. Iris was the beloved wife of the late Joseph George McDonald, sharing a bond of love and companionship that spanned a lifetime.\n\nBorn in Woonsocket, Iris was the daughter of the late Joseph and Elizabeth (Mahon) Ferreira. Her roots ran deep in Rhode Island soil, and her presence brought warmth and kindness to all who knew her.\n\nBefore her well-deserved retirement, Iris dedicated herself to serving her community through her work at Almacs Supermarket in North Providence. As the salad bar expert, she ensured quality service and left an indelible mark on the hearts of her customers. In her early years, she was employed by Roger Williams Hospital as an Outpatient Services representative.\n\nIris's faith was a cornerstone of her life, and she was a devoted member of Saint Augustine Catholic Church in Providence. Her spiritual strength and commitment to her beliefs were unwavering.\n\nA true aficionado of the silver screen, Iris had a passion for classic movies, with a special fondness for anything featuring Elizabeth Taylor, whom she resembled in her youth. But if there was one word to describe Iris, it would undoubtedly be \"nice.\" Her congenial nature and infectious joy touched the lives of all who knew her.\n\nIris found solace and serenity at the ocean, taking leisurely walks along the beach and finding inspiration in the beauty of nature. She also had a deep appreciation for the arts, particularly ballet, and enjoyed the musical stylings of Julio Iglesias, the Three Tenors, Tom Jones, and Herb Albert & the Tijuana Brass.\n\nAt home, Iris surrounded herself with decor that reflected her passions, including beach themes, Gone with the Wind memorabilia, and elegant Lladró ballerina figurines.\n\nHowever, Iris's greatest source of happiness was her family, especially her grandchildren, whose laughter filled her heart with boundless joy. She cherished every moment spent with them, creating memories that will be treasured for generations to come.\n\nIris leaves behind a legacy of love and kindness that will continue to inspire all who were fortunate enough to know her. She is survived by her loving sons, Joseph G. McDonald Jr. (Jay) and John Vincent McDonald, along with their wives, Sheila (Supi) and Cheryle (West), respectively. She is also survived by her grandchildren, Kristi, Joseph, Taylor, and Sienna, as well as her great-grandchild, Emilia. Iris was predeceased by her husband, parents, and siblings (Arthur, Maurice, Paul, Ernest, Vincent, John, and Patricia), but she is survived by her sister, Clarise Ferreira.\n\nA Visitation will be held on Monday, May 6, 2024, from 4:30 pm – 7:30 pm at the Robbins Funeral Home, 2251 Mineral Spring Ave, North Providence.\n\nHer funeral will begin on Tuesday, May 7, 2024 at Robbins at 9:00 am, followed by a Mass at 10:00 am in Saint Augustine Church, 20 Old Rd, Providence. Iris will be laid to rest in the Rhode Island Veterans' Memorial Cemetery, 301 S. County Trail, Exeter at 11:30 am. Memorial contributions may be made to the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nIn the hearts of those who knew her, Iris's memory will forever shine bright, a beacon of love and light guiding us through the darkness. May she rest in eternal peace, her spirit forever cherished and her legacy forever honored."
