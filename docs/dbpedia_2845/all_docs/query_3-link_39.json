The park abuts a 205-acre shallow lake closed to motor boats, which makes this serene location great for canoeing, kayaking, or swimming. And don't forget that fish pole, because the fishing is great too. If paddling around at dusk trolling for that lunker bass or brown trout, listening to the sound of the loons, and watching the sun set sounds a little too relaxing for you then how about a modern ADA Accessible playground for the little ones, volleyball, horseshoes, basketball and more than 3 miles of paved roads for the biker or jogger. Whatever you choose to do with your time here, take time out to observe the abundant wildlife. Whitetail deer are everywhere and friendly.\n\nJust minutes away you can enjoy a chairlift ride to the top of McCauley Mountain to view Fulton Chain of lakes or drive into Old Forge and visit the multitude of shops and fine restaurants along Main Street. And once you visit Old Forge, you will have to spend at least one day at the Enchanted Forest / Water Safari.\n\nWhether your day is filled with one of the many activities available here or you chose to just sit back and enjoy the campfire, you can always start or end your day with a hot shower in one of our brand-new state of the art ADA Accessible restrooms.\n\nDirections\n\nFrom NYS Thruway, Exit 31 at Utica, Route 12 North to Alder Creek, Rte. 28 to Old Forge.

The UMP addresses specific objectives and actions for public use at this facility.\n\nFor more information regarding the UMP for this facility please contact the Bureau of Recreation, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY12233, Telephone 518 457-2500, and email for campground information"
