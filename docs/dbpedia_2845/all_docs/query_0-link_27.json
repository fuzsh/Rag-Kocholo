        "text": "THOMAS2 AND NICHOLAS3 HARRIS\n\nOF PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND\n\nHelen Schatvet Ullmann, cgsm, fasg\n\nThis compilation follows my own line for three generations from Thomas1 Harris, whose origin in Kent, England, is to be published in The New England Historical and Genealogical Register in 2013 along with a biography and list of his children.\n\nThomas2 Harris, son of Thomas1 and Elizabeth (­­­____) Harris, was born, perhaps in England but more likely in Providence, Rhode Island, probably about 1637. He died in Providence on 27 February 1710/1.[ ] He married in Providence on 3 November 1664 Elnathan Tew[ ] who was born in Newport, Rhode Island, on 15 October 1644, daughter of Richard and Mary (Clarke) Tew.[ ] She died on 11 January 1718 in her 77th year and was buried in St. Peters Churchyard in Johnston, Rhode Island, and moved to the North Burial Ground in Providence.[ ] An unreliable source says she died at Limerock, Rhode Island, on that date,[ ] Lime Rock being a village then in Providence, later in Smithfield, now in Lincoln.\n\nA few facts give glimpses of Thomas’s life. On 19 February 1665 Thomas acquired lot 49 in a division of lands. On 1 July 1679 he was taxed 8s 9d. He served as deputy, i.e., a member of the colony government in 1671, 1679–82, 1685, 1691, 1694, 1997, 1702, 1706–08 and 1710. From 1684 to 1686 he was on the town council. On 1 September 1687 he was taxed 14s 5d. In 1688 his ratable estate consisted of 10 cows, 4 oxen, 6 steers, 3 yearlings, 4 two-year-olds, 3 horses, a mare, 10 sheep and 4 swine.[ ]\n\nOn 9 January 1702/3, Thomas Harris of Providence and his wife Elnathan sold twenty acres in Smithfield (that had been laid out to Thomas) to John Angell.[ ]\n\nThomas signed his will on 21 June 1708, and it was proved on 16 April 1711. Executors were his wife Elnathan and son Henry. His eldest son was Thomas. Sons Richard, Nicholas, William and Henry also received land. Daughters Amity Morse, Elnathan Harris and Mary Harris received household goods and £20 each. Witnesses were James Coggeshall, Henry Tew, Jr., and Richard Tew. His death date appears on both the probate of his will and on his inventory, taken 22 March 1710/1.[ ]\n\nChildren of Thomas2 and Elnathan (Tew) Harris:\n\ni. Thomas3 Harris, born Newport 19 Oct. 1665;[ ] died (called Capt.) at Providence 1 Sept. 1741;[ ] married ca. 1695[ ] Phebe Browne, daughter of Henry and Wait (Waterman) Browne,[ ] who died in Providence 20 Aug. 1723.[ ] Thomas’s will dated 31 Jan. 1739/40, presented in court 18 Jan. 1741/2, names sons Henry, Thomas, Charles and Gidian, as well as daughter Wait Fenner.[ ]\n\nii. Richard Harris, born Providence 14 Oct. 1668;[ ] died 1750;[ ] married (1) ca. 1699 ___ King, daughter of Clement and Elizabeth (___) King,[ ] married (2) Susannah (Burton) Gorton, widow of Samuel Gorton and daughter of William and Hannah (Wickes) Burton,[ ] born 1665, died 25 June 1737.[ ] They lived at Smithfield, R.I.[ ] On 21 Sept. 1694 his father gave him about 200 acres and some meadow in Providence.[ ] On 25 July 1733 Susanna Harris, in her 68th year, made her will while her husband Richard was still living. She named her Gorton children and grandchildren. It was proved 15 Sept. 1739.[ ] Richard, “being grown old,” made his will on 6 March 1738/9, naming sons Richard, Amaziah, Jonathan, David, and Preserved, and daughters Amity Smith, Dinah Smith, and Elnathan Gile. It was proved on 15 Dec. 1750.[ ]\n\n+ iii. Nicholas Harris, born Providence 5 April 1671;[ ] married Ann ___.\n\niv. William Harris, born Providence 11 May 1673;[ ] died (called Lt.) at Providence 14 Jan. 1725/6,[ ] buried in the North Burial Ground in Providence;[ ] married by 1700[ ] Abigail ___, born ca. 1679, died Providence 4 Nov. 1724[ ] age 45,[ ] buried with William.[ ] Their son Job’s will, dated 15 Dec. 1729, refers to his wife Mary, sister Alice Harris, three daughters, brother-in-law Daniel Smith, his cousin [actually nephew] William Smith, and his uncle, Job Whipple.[ ] An attempt to identify Abigail’s family by identifying this Job Whipple has so far been unsuccessful.\n\nv. Henry Harris, born 10 Nov. 1675;[ ] died Providence 29 Mar. 1727;[ ] married Lydia Olney, daughter of Epenetus and Mary (Whipple) Olney,[ ] born Providence 26 Jan. 1688, died Providence 1727.[ ] Mary Whipple was the sister of Samuel2 Whipple who had married Mary2 Harris.[ ] In his will, Henry named sons Thomas and Henry and daughter Lydia Harris. His brother Thomas and brother-in-law Thomas Olney were to be executors.\n\nvi. Amity Harris, born 10 Dec. 1677;[ ] died Canton, Mass., 5 June 1749 age 71, buried in the Canton Corner Cemetery;[ ] married, probably in Providence ca. 1704 Rev. Joseph Morse,[ ] son of Joseph and Priscilla (Colborne) Morse, born Medfield, Mass., 25 May 1671, died Canton 29 Nov. 1732 in his 61st year, buried with Amity.[ ]\n\nvii. Job Harris, born 11 Jan. 1682 [1681/2?]; died Jan. 1689.[ ]\n\nviii. Elnathan Harris, born ca. 1684; died after 27 July 1749;[ ] married, intentions at Rehoboth, Mass., 24 Nov. 1711, Nathaniel Brown of Rehoboth,[ ] born Rehoboth 24 Sept. 1689,[ ] died, probably at Providence, after 1749, son of Nathaniel and Sarah (Jenckes) Brown.[ ] They were evidently deceased by 14 May 1757 when Mrs. Sarah Jacox, widow, administrator of their son Capt. William Brown’s estate, petitioned for guardians for Nathaniel and Elnathan’s three children, who were orphans.[ ]\n\nix. Mary Harris, born ca. 1687; buried at St. John’s Church in Providence 13 Sept. 1765;[ ] married (1) in 1712, as his second wife, Gabriel Bernon of Providence, born La Rochelle, France, 5 or 6 April 1644, died Providence 1 or 21 Feb. 1735/6, son of André and Suzanne (Guillemard) Bernon.[ ] “Mrs. Mary Bernoon” married (2) at Providence 23 Dec. 1737, as his third wife, Nathaniel Brown of Rehoboth.[ ] This was not the Nathaniel Brown who had previously married Mary’s sister Elnathan; Elnathan was still living in 1749. It was Nathaniel’s father, whose second wife, Hannah, had died in November 1736 in her 66th year. Hannah and Nathaniel, who died 13 Nov. 1739 in his 79th year, were buried in the part of Rehoboth which is now Seekonk.[ ] The will of Nathaniel Brown of Rehoboth, shipwright, “Late of Rehoboth, Now Residing in Providence. . . Now Aged and Well Stricken in years,” dated 20 May 1738 and proved 5 Dec. 1739, did not name a wife. However, the executor John Brown’s account includes £100 “to my Mother in Law Mary Brown by a Contract made before Marriage with my Honoured Father.[ ] This elder Nathaniel Brown was born at Rehoboth 9 June 1661, son of John2 (John1) and Lydia (Buckland) Brown.[ ]\n\nNicholas3 Harris, son of Thomas2 and Elnathan (Tew) Harris, was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on 1 April 1671. He died in Providence on 27 March 1746.[] He married about 1688, but whether it was to the Ann ___ of his will is not evident.[] She is often said to be the daughter of Thomas and Mary (Smith) Hopkins.[] An article on that Hopkins family lists an Anne as their daughter,[] but neither Thomas Hopkins’ will or Austin's Dictionary confirm that Thomas’s daughter Ann married Nicholas Harris. Thomas Hopkins’ will, dated 26 April 1711 and proved 19 May 1718, gives the daughter Ann an unspecified amount to be paid by his son Zebedee when she was 21 or married,[] so she was clearly much too young to be the mother of Nicholas Harris's children. If Nicholas Harris married this Anne Hopkins, it was as a second wife. The fact that the widow Ann declined serving as executrix of his will in 1746 suggests that perhaps she was quite elderly. On the other hand, it may have been because she was not the mother of his children.\n\nOn 27 April 1703 Nicholas Harris and James Thornton put in a bill requesting a highway from the “Neotaconkinitt” River westward.[ ] Ensign Thomas Harris, Nicholas Harris and others were summoned to give evidence in the Court of Magistrates in the case of Joseph Latham v. Benjamin Dayly on 14 July 1704. Both were described only as “of full age” and no details of the case appear.[ ] On 5 June 1710 Nicholas was elected as “way warden.”[ ] On 18 February 1713/4 he served on the jury at a coroner's inquest.[ ] On 4 June 1722 Mr. Nicholas Harris was chosen as constable but was excused from serving.[ ] In 1723 a town council record referred to a highway “from Newtaconconut River neere Mr. Nicholas Harris to Nicholas Sheldons orchard.”[ ]\n\nOn 27 January 1723/4 Nicholas signed and Ann made her mark on a deed for an undivided third of an acre of land in Providence, bounded on the west by the “main Towne Street,” owned jointly with his brothers Richard and Henry, bequeathed to him by his father Mr. Thomas Harris.[ ]\n\nOn 21 June 1731 Nicholas deeded three fifths of three rights of land, one fifth drawn by his grandfather Thomas, Sr., one fifth by his father Thomas, Jr., and one fifth in the original right of Christopher Onthank to Robert Gibbs of Providence, merchant. Ann did not sign. (This was evidently a mortgage because he later gave land of the same description to his son Thomas.) Among other deeds was another, this time signed by Ann, for land in the Plantation of Mashantuket, dated 25 December 1733.[ ]\n\nOn 25 March 1736/7 Nicholas and his brother Thomas divided a twenty-acre lot in the township of Scituate, and on 7 December 1738 Nicholas, Thomas and “our cousin [i.e., nephew] Henry Harris of Providence, son of Henry Harris deceased” divided their rights to 150-acre parcels in Scituate, laid out to Thomas Harris, Senior, and Thomas Harris, Jr., grandfather and father of Thomas and Nicholas and to Christopher Unthank. The piece Nicholas acquired lay on both sides of the “Pautuxett River,” the land where Nicholas' son Jedidiah was living.[ ] However, it appears that Nicholas had already given that land to “my son” Jedidiah “for love and affection” on 13 April 1732.[ ]\n\nNicholas signed his will on 16 July 1725 and added a codicil on 22 April 1739. It was proved on 7 April 1746. Executors were to be his wife Ann and son Thomas, but Ann refused, so Thomas alone was appointed. Son Joseph was under age in 1725. Thomas was to provide for Ann and for the daughter Amity. Sons Nicholas, Jedidiah and Christopher were given land by the will, but the codicil said that Joseph should get part of the land designated for Nicholas who should receive £100 instead of land. Daughter Ann Kilton received 5s and daughter Zerviah Waterman £10. Mary and Sarah were to receive £25 at age 21 or their marriage. According to the codicil the daughter Mary’s portion was to go to her son if he lived to 21.[ ]\n\nChildren of Nicholas3 Harris, all born probably at Providence:\n\ni. Thomas4 Harris, probably the eldest son; perhaps married (1) Mary Rutenberg,[ ] perhaps the daughter of John and Mary (Shippee) Rutenberg,[ ] but no verification of this statement has been located; it may be a confusion with his wife Sarah. Thomas married (2?) at Providence 31 March 1743[ ] Sarah (Collins) Rutenberg, born Warwick, R.I., 31 Oct. 1698, daughter of Thomas and Abigail (House) Collins of Providence and widow of John Rutenburg.[ ] On 25 March 1736/7 Thomas's father deeded him twenty acres in Glocester, R.I., on the Connecticut line, in addition to Nicholas's right in the “division of small lots.”[ ] On 17 March 1742 Nicholas, for love and goodwill, “not on a suddon or meane Motion but upon mature and Good Consideration. . .” gave land in Providence and Glocester and a fifth of three original rights in the common lands (see above) to his son Thomas.[ ] This could be the Thomas Harris who was a freeman at Providence in 1747.[ ] No sale of these lands in either Glocester or Providence appears and no further trace of this Thomas has been found.\n\nii. Nicholas Harris, born Oct. 1691[ ] or perhaps 10 Oct. 1696;[ ] m. Hannah Blake. This author’s article on Nicholas and his descendants was published in The Genealogist 15 (2001):201–218; 16 (2002):99–122. Further articles, also by this author, on descendants of Nicholas’s son John Harris have appeared as\n\n1. “John6 Harris of Hardwick, Mass., Washington and Goshen, N.H., and Springfield, Vt., and Some of his Descendants,” Vermont Genealogy 10 (2005):87–91;\n\n2. “Oliver6 Harris of Hardwick, Greenwich, and Dana, Massachusetts, and Some of His Descendants,” MASSOG 29 (2005):14–20, 42–47, 76–79;\n\n3. “David6 Harris of Washington and Newport, New Hampshire, and Many of His Descendants,” New Hampshire Genealogical Record 22 (2005):97–111, 149–63;\n\n4. “Descendants of Solomon5 and Margaret (Harris) Mason of Ashford and Willington, Connecticut, and Greenwich, Massachusetts” (Acton, Mass., 2004), 35 pp., computer printout at the Family History Library [FHL microfiche 6,008,087] and the New England Historic Genealogical Society.\n\niii. Jedidiah Harris, living Cranston, R.I., 1 April 1773[ ] but is not in the 1774 census of Rhode Island;[ ] m. Patience ___, said to have been a daughter of Othniel Brown.[ ] However, the only Othniel Brown of the right age made his will on 4 Sept. 1749, naming wife and children but no daughter Patience.[ ] On 13 April 1732 Jedidiah’s father deeded him land and the house where he was living in Scituate, on both sides of the “Pautuxet River.”[ ] On 5 Nov. 1744 Nicholas gave 20 acres to Jedediah.[ ] (See Jedediah's brother Joseph for information on some land in Scituate that they owned jointly). In 1747 “Jeddediah” was a freeman at Scituate.[ ] On 12 Feb. 1755 Jedidiah and Patience, of Scituate, sold a half acre with a grist mill in Scituate.[ ] Among a few other deeds are two signed by Jedediah and Patience Harris of Cranston on 23 May 1758 and 19 Sept. 1761.[ ] Cranston was formed from Providence in 1754, so they had apparently moved. On 1 April 1773 Jedidiah and Patience sold a 49-acre farm with house and barn in Cranston to Philip Burlingame of Cranston.[ ] Jedediah was not listed in the 1774 or 1777 censuses of Rhode Island. His son, Dr. Nicholas Harris, went to Stephentown, Rensselaer Co., N.Y.[ ] Born 26 Aug. 1749, died 22 April 1819, he is buried in Rensselaer Co.[ ] Jedediah’s son James may have lived in Lanesborough, Berkshire Co., Mass.[ ]\n\niv. Ann Harris, married Samuel Kilton of Providence,[ ] son of Robert and Bethiah (Fenner) Kilton.[ ] A cordwainer, he died 28 Dec. 1740, and Ann was appointed adminstrator on his estate 25 July 1741.[ ]\n\nv. Zerviah Harris, born 19 March 1701; married (1) at Providence 25 May 1722 Zuriel Waterman of Providence,[ ] born Providence 20 Sept. 1699, son of Capt. Richard and Abigail (Angell) Waterman,[ ] died Providence 12 Oct. 1739;[ ] married (2) at Providence 1 March 1740/1 James Williams, Jr.,[ ] born Cranston, R.I., 29 Feb. 1704, son of James and Elizabeth (Blackmer) Williams.[ ]\n\nvi. Amity Harris, evidently over 21 but perhaps under some disability in 1725 as her father specifically said her brother Thomas was to provide for her. On 13 Feb. 1732/3 an Amity Harris was found dead in Providence River, having fallen through the ice on 10 Feb. She was not further identified in the record of the Jury of Inquest,[] but it seems likely she was this Amity.\n\nvii. Christopher Harris, born 13 Dec. 1706; died Johnston, R.I., 27 July 1781;[ ] married Anna Harris, daughter of Toleration and Sarah (Foster) Harris, of Providence, born possibly 31 Dec. 1709, a descendant of William1 Harris.[ ] Nicholas sold the four acres in Providence where Christopher had his house, smith's shop, and waterworks for £200 to Christopher on 12 Oct. 1742.[ ] In 1747 he was listed as a freeman in Providence.[ ] In 1774 Christopher and his son Andrew Harris were listed together at Johnston with two males over 16, two under, two females over 16, two under and two blacks.[ ] A Christopher Harris was on the payroll in Col. Archibald Crary’s regiment in 1776.[ ] This must have been in or soon after Oct. 1776 when Lt. Col. Crary took over the 9th Continental Regiment.[ ] The 1777 military census listed Christopher Harris, aged over 60, at Johnston.[ ] The heading of the record of Christopher’s will calls him “Col.” Christopher’s will, dated Johnston 25 May 1777, proved 29 Sept. 1781, named sons William, deceased, and Andrew, daughters Ann, wife of Thomas Whipple, Sarah, wife of John Brown, and Amy, wife of Charles Lee, as well as Japhet, Joseph and Hiram, sons of William.[ ]\n\nviii. Mary Harris, born say 1708; under 21 in 1725. She had an unnamed son born between 1725 and 1739.[ ]\n\nix. Sarah Harris, born say 1710; under 21 and apparently unmarried in 1725; perhaps married Israel Carpenter,[ ] who is unidentified. This is not likely the Israel Carpenter born 3 Sept. 1722, son of Silas and Sarah (Arnold) Carpenter, Capt. in the militia, 1760, resident of Pawtuxet (a village partly in Warwick, partly in Cranston).[ ] Several deeds for a Capt. Israel Carpenter of Johnston show he bought land there on 2 July 1759, mortgaged to John Rutenborge of Johnston in 20 April 1761 [an in-law to Sarah’s brother Thomas?], witnesses being Henry and Caleb Harris, and redeemed 12 June 1761. He again mortgaged half his farm on 19 May 1767, witnesses being Henry and Josiah Harris, and lost the whole by execution 11 March 1768.[ ] Israel and Nicholas Carpenter evidently lived in the same house at Johnston in 1774.[ ] That was probably the Israel Carpenter who d. Johnston, probably in early March 1811, in his 94th year,[ ] thus born ca. 1718. That he had a son named Nicholas[ ] supports this possible identification.\n\nx. Joseph Harris, under 21 in 1725; married at Newport, 15 June 1738 Sarah Sweet,[ ] probably the daughter of the widow Sarah Sweet who was mentioned three times in the wills of various “mariners” at Newport, witnessed two of those times by Joseph Harris.[ ] Sarah, “Relict of the late Capt. Joseph Harris of Newport,” died in Providence 27 Dec. 1783 in her 63d year and was buried at the North Burial Ground in Providence,[ ] thus born ca. 1721.\n\nA Joseph Harris was listed as a freeman in Providence in 1747.[ ] But on 5 Sept. 1748 Joseph was of Newport, a mariner, when his brother Jedediah quitclaimed on the southern part of 218½ acres in Scituate given to them by their father Nicholas in his will and Joseph quitclaimed to Jedediah on the northern part. Both deeds were witnessed by Charles and Christopher Harris.[ ] On 5 Feb. 1756 the sheriff attached Joseph's part of the land under a judgment of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas at Providence on the third Thuesday of Dec. 1754, suit having been brought by A... or Paul[?] Tew of Providence, shopkeeper. The document says that Joseph had left the colony.[ ] Nothing about Joseph Harris has been found in Newport newspapers before 1800, except for the notice of his wife’s death cited above. A Capt.
