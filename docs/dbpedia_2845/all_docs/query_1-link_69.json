His birth year is uncertain [1] but Abraham is named in his father's Will. Based upon his fathers probated estate inventory Nicholas was a farmer and shepherd during a time when the colonies of Massachusetts Bay were bastions of \"relentless intolerance in the service of a Puritan state.\" [2] In 1655 Nicholas Brown (Sen.) was one of the Monmouth, New Jersey Patent investors granted by New York Governor Nicholls on behalf of the Duke of York, brother of King Charles II. [3] In 1665 settlers from Long Island and Rhode Island relocated to establish the settlements of Shrewsbury and Middleton in Monmouth county. The settlers reached \"more than 100\" the limit set by them at their general assembly in 1668. These landowners were also residents and heads of families and they included from Rhode Island Abraham Brown (Sen.), his brother Nicholas Brown (Jun.), [4]\n\nMarriage and Children\n\nUnless he married later than usual records have been lost as the identity of Abraham Brown's (first?) wife. [1] It also appears there were no surviving children from this earlier marriage if there was one as author Hornor believes. In his Will wife Mary and their children are named. Mary's last name at birth (LNAB) is Unknown although many family tree's make the assumption it was Potter. Author Hornor states that the surname Potter is conjecture [1] because there are no vital records during her life to support this assumption.\n\nAbraham and Mary (Unknown) Brown had the following children:\n\nMartha, author Hornor mentions her as a dau. [1] but she's the only child not mentioned in her father's Will., she may have d. bef that event in 1714; m.
