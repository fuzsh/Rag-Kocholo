(WLNE) — A Providence fire battalion chief who was killed in the line of duty was laid to rest Monday morning.\n\nA procession march took place from the Public Safety Complex to the Cathedral of SS Peter and Paul for his funeral services.\n\nLast week, the Providence Fire Department said James Varin’s line of duty death is attributed to occupational cancer.\n\nVarin served the city for more than 31 years. He was 52.\n\nAccording to his obituary, Vatin was born in Providence and followed in his father’s footsteps, joining the Providence Fire Department at an early age.\n\n“He always said that being a firefighter was the greatest job in the world and that not many people could say that about their profession,” read part of his obituary.\n\nA standout basketball player, he was named the Rhode Island Gatorade Player of the Year two years in a row.\n\nHe continued playing the sport at the Community College of Rhode Island and then later with the Providence Fire Department’s team, according to the obituary.\n\n“As of late, Jim loved cheering on the Providence College Men’s basketball team,” read the obituary.\n\nThe 52-year-old leaves behind his wife, father, sons, and stepdaughters."
