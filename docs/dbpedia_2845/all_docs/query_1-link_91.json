        "text": "The entire Sprint Car world has converged on Knoxville Raceway for “The Granddaddy of ‘Em All”\n\nNo more waiting. The 63rd running of the NOS Energy Drink Knoxville Nationals presented by Casey’s is here.\n\nThe Sprint Car world has traveled to the small town of Knoxville, IA. The population sits just north of 7,000 but grows exponentially this week as “The Granddaddy of ‘Em All” invites people from all over the globe to the Marion County Fairgrounds. More than 100 drivers are ready to chase Sprint Car immortality, and tens of thousands of fans are ready to watch.\n\nTo go along with the unparalleled prestige of the Knoxville Nationals, the event offers up a massive purse that hands out more than a million dollars to the competitors on championship Saturday alone. This year’s winner will bank $190,000, and it pays $15,000 to simply make the finale.\n\nIt’s the most anticipated week of the year in Sprint Car Racing, and it has arrived. Another important chapter in the sport’s history books is ready to be written.\n\nBUY KNOXVILLE NATIONALS TICKETS HERE\n\nWATCH LIVE ON DIRTVision\n\nLet’s look at the week’s top storylines:\n\nSCHATZVILLE NATIONALS: As always when the Knoxville Nationals take center stage, many eyes will be firmly fixed on Donny Schatz and the Tony Stewart/Curb Agajanian Racing No. 15.\n\nThe numbers for Schatz at the sport’s most prestigious race are astonishing. He’s made the Saturday finale 25 consecutive years. The Fargo, ND native has won the main event 11 times including streaks of four in a row (2006-2009) and five in a row (2011-2015). He’s finished second another eight times and brought home his first third place run last year, marking his 20th podium finish.\n\nThe 10-time World of Outlaws champion again enters the week with one of the sport’s most coveted records within reach. Steve Kinser claimed 12 Knoxville Nationals titles during his illustrious career. Another checkered flag on Saturday would equal Schatz with “The King.”\n\nBACK-TO-BACK?: Winning one Knoxville Nationals is difficult enough. Going back-to-back in the iconic event is another level of challenging.\n\n27 different competitors can call themselves a Knoxville Nationals champion, but only seven have topped two in a row. The opportunity stands in front of Kyle Larson, courtesy of him leading all 50 laps in last year’s 62nd running.\n\nThe 2021 NASCAR Cup Series champion is entered aboard the Silva Motorsports No. 57 as the pairing seek a second straight victory in “The Granddaddy of ‘Em All.” It would also be Larson’s third overall, which would put him in the company of Steve Kinser (12), Donny Schatz (11), Doug Wolfgang (five), Kenny Weld (four), Danny Lasoski, (four), and Mark Kinser (three) as the seventh with at least three Knoxville Nationals wins on their résumé.\n\nLarson is fresh off sweeping the Ironman 55 weekend with drives to victory from 21st and 12th along with a charge from 13th to the win at Monday’s Front Row Challenge.\n\nRETURNING WINNERS: Beyond Schatz and Larson, the pre-entry list also features five more former event champions.\n\n1983 winner Sammy Swindell will make a popular return after not partaking in the 2023 edition. In addition to his one Nationals win, the three-time World of Outlaws champion also owns seven more podiums including a trio of runner-ups (1981, 1985, 1990).\n\nBack in 2005 Kraig Kinser sat on the pole and joined his father Steve Kinser on the list of champions by leading all 30 laps. The Bloomington, IN native also picked up a top five in 2012. He’ll be aboard the Premier Motorsports No. 70 for the second consecutive year at Knoxville in August.\n\n2010 winner Tim Shaffer is looking to make his 17th main event. Shaffer’s triumph 14 years ago halted Donny Schatz’s run of four straight. The “Steel City Outlaw” is entered behind the wheel of the Deyman-Rudzik No. 49X.\n\nBrad Sweet will be aboard the Kasey Kahne Racing No. 49 in search of his second visit to the hallowed ground of Knoxville Nationals Victory Lane. The “Big Cat” won in 2018, podiumed in 2015 and 2021, and has been in the top 10 in eight of his 11 starts in the finale.\n\nDavid Gravel, the 2019 victor, may be the favorite to become the ninth different driver to earn multiple Knoxville Nationals victories. He and Big Game Motorsports have already amassed 13 World of Outlaws wins in 2024 including one at Knoxville in June. Gravel grabbed the first gem of the triple crown by winning the Kings Royal less than three weeks ago, and Knoxville could be the second piece to the puzzle for the current Series point leader.\n\nA NEW CHAMP?: Only 27 drivers have been crowned a Knoxville Nationals champion through 62 runnings, but several current stars of the sport stand out as potential favorites to add their name to the list of legends and Hall of Famers.\n\nCarson Macedo would love nothing more than to take the Jason Johnson Racing No. 41 to Victory Lane for the third time on the sport’s biggest stage. Johnson himself topped the wild 2016 edition, and David Gravel took JJR to the top again in 2019. Last year, Macedo won his prelim and finished a personal best fifth in the finale.\n\nGiovanni Scelzi has posted fourth-place finishes in two of the last three Knoxville Nationals Features with KCP Racing. “Hot Sauce” also topped the 2021 360 Nationals, one of his three victories at “The Sprint Car Capital of the World.”\n\nLogan Schuchart continues to bang on the door of a Knoxville Nationals title. He finished in the top five in three straight runnings including drives from 22nd to second in 2019 and 17th to third in 2022. Last year, he was running second in the Shark Racing No. 1S before a flat tire derailed his effort.\n\nBrian Brown is always one to watch at Knoxville when August rolls around. “Blackjack” put together three consecutive runner-ups in the finale from 2012 through 2014. He’s a 66-time Feature winner and five-time track champion at Knoxville and ready to add a Nationals victory to his résumé.\n\nRico Abreu is undoubtedly one of the sport’s best that is still lacking a Knoxville Nationals title. He scored a top 10 back in 2017 and looked primed to challenge Larson last year until an issue while running second ended those hopes. He’s fresh off an impressive victory in the Capitani Classic.\n\nMany more talented gassers including Sheldon Haudenschild, Michael “Buddy” Kofoid, Corey Day, Brent Marks, recent 360 Knoxville Nationals champion Tyler Courtney, and more will be in search of their first Knoxville Nationals win.\n\nDARK HORSES: While it’s a rare occurrence, not always do the favorites pull into Victory Lane when the checkered flag flies on Saturday night. And the 2024 roster features a handful of names that might make some noise up front in the finale.\n\nChase Randall continues to prove he’s one of the sport’s top rising stars, and his performance at Knoxville has been a key contributor toward that reputation. He’s won three times at the half mile this season including a pair in 410 action. Last year, he earned JETCO Rookie of the Year honors with TKS Motorsports.\n\nIt may be strange to think of a former World of Outlaws champion as a dark horse, but with Daryn Pittman only running a limited schedule these days, he’s behind most in terms of recent laps. The 2013 Series titlist linked with Kreitz Racing to bring the No. 69K out from Pennsylvania to Iowa. He owns a trio of top fives in the finale, peaking at third in 2019.\n\nAustin McCarl would love to be the first Iowan to claim a Knoxville Nationals title. The “Big Unit” sat on the pole two years ago in what was his third Feature appearance. McCarl is a two-time and the reigning Knoxville track champion in the 410 division.\n\nADDITIONAL ACCOLADES: Of course, the main goal of this week for every driver is to become a Knoxville Nationals champion, but there are plenty of other opportunities for achievement and recognition.\n\nThe battle for the MPV Express Jesse Hockett Mr. Sprint Car Award has already started as it takes points from the 360 Nationals, Capitani Classic, Front Row Challenge, and 410 Nationals to decide the winner of the $6,500 prize.\n\nThe JETCO Rookie of the Year acknowledges the highest finishing driver making their event debut. Every year the Knoxville Nationals invites a wide array of first timers looking to be the best among the rookie class.\n\nWith all the special paint schemes that team roll out, the DGRD Best Appearing Car Award rewards the one that stands out from the rest.\n\nTo go along with those unique liveries, many teams also create special uniforms for the week leading to the Avanti Windows and Doors Best Dressed Crew Award.\n\nFor the Saturday finale, there will also be the SprintCarUnlimted.com Pole Award and the KSE Racing Hard Charger & MPI Steering Wheel Hard Charger Award.\n\nTHIS WEEKEND AT A GLANCE\n\nWHEN AND WHERE\n\nWednesday-Saturday, August 7-10 at Knoxville Raceway in Knoxville, IA\n\nON THE INTERNET\n\nWorld of Outlaws NOS Energy Drink Sprint Car Series\n\nX – @WorldofOutlaws\n\nInstagram – @WoOSprint\n\nFacebook – Facebook.com/WorldofOutlawsSprintCarSeries\n\nYouTube – Youtube.com/WorldofOutlaws\n\nDIRTVision – DIRTVision.com – Platinum annual FAST PASS for $299 or monthly FAST PASS for $39/month\n\nCURRENT CHAMPIONSHIP STANDINGS (43/73 Races):\n\n1.
