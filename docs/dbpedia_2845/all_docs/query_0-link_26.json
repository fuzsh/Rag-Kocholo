        "text": "Rhode Island Presidents & Governors\n\n\"The State originally consisted of four towns: Providence settled in 1636. Portsmouth in 1638. Newport in 1639, and Warwick in 1642. The Executive heads of Portsmouth and Newport were entitled Judges until 164 then those two towns united, and the chief officer thereafter was called Governor. Providence and Warwick had no executive head until 1647.\"\n\n\"In 1651 a separation occurred between the Towns of Providence and Warwick* on the one side which continued the Government established under the charter [and thus had Presidents*] and Newport and Portsmouth** on the other under a new Government under the Coddington Commission [which first had Coddington as Governor** and then Presidents**].\" Starting with the Royal Charter of 1663 the executives were all called Governor. In the list below a [P] means President.

The earliest record of the name is in the Domesday Book, complied in the eleventh century. William Karre, who accompanied William the Conqueror into England, became the founder of the earliest families of Carr and Kerr, in England and Scotland. The posterity of this Norman ancestor settled in the North of England on the borderlands between England and Scotland; at a later date many went to the North of Ireland. In England the Norman-French Karre became Carr, just as Knut became Canute. In Scotland the surname has remained Karr, Kerr and Ker. The names of four of the family appear on the Ragman's Roll, a list of the Scotch baronets who swore fealty to Edward I. at Berwick in 1291 and a few years later. They were: Andrew del Ker, of Stirlingshire; Henry Ker, of Edinburghshire; Nicholas Kerre, of Peebleshire, and William Ker, of Ayrshire. The Kerrs appear among the East Border clans in 1547; in the Middle Marches in 1587; in Berwick in 1590; in Roxburgh and Lauderdale in 1597. The family has been represented from time immemorial in Berwickshire, Roxburghshire, Edinburghshire, Wigtonshire, Ayrshire, all tracing authentic pedigrees from the beginning of the fourteenth century A. D. The Kerrs and Carrs possess, or at different times have held, the Dukedom of Roxburgh; the Marquisats of Beumont, Cessford, Lothian, and Roxburgh; the Viscountcy of Boxmouth; the Lordships of Caverton, Ker, and New Battle. Many have been members of the Scotch Parliament. The surname signifies 'stout', accourding to Hanna.\n\nThe pioneers to America from Scotland, England, and Ireland during the colonizing period of our history were numerous. The first of the name to come to the shore of New Enlgand was George Carr, who with his wife Lucinda was a passenger on the 'Mayflower'. At a later date came Caleb Carr, founder of the most notable branch of the family in America, a figure of note in the early affairs of the Rhode Island Colony, of which he was president in 1695.\n\n(I) CALEB CARR, immigrant ancestor and progenitor, was born in London, England, December 9, 1616, the son of Benjamin and Martha (Hardington) Carr; he embarked in the ship 'Elizabeth and Ann', at London, in 1635, coming to America with his older brother, Robert Carr, in whose family he remained until he reached his majority. At an early age he became active in public affairs in Newport, and in 1654-1658-59-60-61-62 he served the Colony as general treasurer. On January 30, 1671, he was allowed Â£4 for services done by him. On April 11, 1676, he was appointed one of the commissioners 'to take care and order the several watches and wards of this island, and appoint the places.' This year he bought the services of an Indian captive (taken by Providence men). In 1679-80-81-82-83-84-85-86-90-91 he was assistant for Newport. In 1687-88 he was chosen justice of the General Quarter Session and Inferior Court of Common Pleas. In May, 1695, he was elected governor to succeed Governor John Easton, who had been in office for the five preceding years. Up to this period, for most of the time, public service had been rendered gratuitously by civil officers. It was now enacted that the governor should have ten pounds a year, the deputy governor six pounds, and the assistants four pounds each. Governor Carr did not live long enough to reap much reward for the discharge of his duties as chief magistrate. He died in Newport, December 17, 1695, the fourth governor who died while in office. He was buried in a small family burying ground on the north side of Mill street [moved to Jamestown], between Thomas and Spring streets, Newport. Caleb Carr married (first) Mercy ----; (second) Sarah Pinner, daughter of Jeremiah and Frances (Latham) Clarke, and widow of John Pinner; she was born in 1651, and died about 1706.\n\n(II) EDWARD CARR, son of Governor Caleb and Mercy Carr, was born in Rhode Island, in June, 1667. In 1698 he was made a freeman, and thenceforward until his death took a prominent part in official life. In 1669 he was deputy to the General Assembly from Jamestown. He filled the office again in 1702-03-05-06-07-09, serving at the same time as clerk of the Assembly. From 1701 to 1707 he served as member of a committee appointed to audit the accounts of the colony. Edward Carr was a resident of Jamestown, and was a large landowner there. On October 6, 1686, he married Hannah Stanton, who was born November 7, 1670, and died in 1712. She was the daughter of John and Mary (Harndel) Stanton, and granddaughter of Robert Stanton, founder of the family in Rhode Island.\n\n(III) SARAH CARR, daughter of Edward and Hannah (Stanton) Carr, was born in Jamestown, Rhode Island, December 28, 1708. On October 12, 1732, she married Resolved (2) Waterman, son of Captain John and Anne (Olney) Waterman."
