        "text": "A full-strength squad of 84 athletes and 27 support staff have been selected to represent Great Britain at the 2024 World Rowing Senior, Under 23 and Under 19 Championships, taking place 18–25 August in St Catharines, Canada\n\nIn the year of the Summer Olympic and Summer Paralympic Games, Senior categories are limited to non-Olympic and non-Paralympic boat classes. Therefore, fresh from being a reserve in Paris, Olivia Bates will race in the Lightweight Women’s single sculls (LW1x). Olivia has won several World Rowing Cup medals in this boat class and will be looking to build on those performances in Canada.\n\nAlso travelling will be a talented group of U23 and U19 athletes looking to develop their championship racing, many for the first time.\n\nPeter Sheppard, GB Rowing Team Head Coach for the Olympic Pathway said: “With the senior squad now returning from some excellent performances in Paris, our attention switches to our development age group teams of U23 and U19 athletes who will race at the combined Championships in Canada.”\n\n“Inspired by the recent Olympic Team results in Paris many of the U23s will be representing GB for the first time in Canada and will be taking the opportunity to demonstrate their potential to be future Olympians in either 2028 or 2032. There are however a number of experienced returning U23 gold medallists from 2023 in this years U23 M 4- (Jake Wincomb, Harry Geffen and Fergus Woolnough) and U23 M 8+ (Tom Bryce, Louis Nares, Luca Ferraro, Gabriel Obholzer and Toby Lassen) who will be looking to share their knowledge of championship racing throughout the team.”\n\nCommenting on the U19 group, Team Manager, John Layng said: “This is one of the most motivated teams that I have worked with, every crew and coach working with determination to make their boat go as fast as possible. We are lucky to have seven rowers returning with valuable Championships experience from 2023 to pass on to the rest of the team.\n\n“For the majority of the team this is their first opportunity to represent their country on the World stage against other U19s and for everyone it will be a memorable experience being part of the ‘mega-worlds’ with U23 and senior events as well. It is an exciting prospect for the young rowers as they start their journey towards further GB representation in the future.\n\n“It is pleasing to note that we have almost equal numbers of male and female rowers and that out of a team of nine coaches, four of these are female. There are special thanks due to the clubs, schools and coaches that have supported these rowers throughout the season; without their efforts they would not be ready to race in Canada.”\n\nSenior
