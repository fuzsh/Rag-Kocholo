        "text": "USC's head coach is \"on another level\" calling plays according to one coach, and was most-often mentioned amongst college football's best. His specialty is getting the most out of his quarterbacks and scheming guys open in space. He orchestrated Heisman seasons from three of his former quarterbacks — Baker Mayfield, Kyler Murray and Caleb Williams — and also helped develop Jalen Hurts into a premiere talent at the position after he left Alabama for Oklahoma ahead of his final collegiate season. Riley's passing game always produces and that's the expectation once more with Miller Moss penciled in as USC's starter.\n\nSteve Sarkisian is always respected by his peers as an offensive mastermind of sorts, but his most impressive display of coaching acumen might have come during his second stint at Alabama, this time as Nick Saban's OC during the 2019 and 2020 seasons. He helped cap a perfect season during his final year in Tuscaloosa with a game plan to remember against Ohio State in the national championship game, a 52-24 pounding of the previously-unbeaten Buckeyes. Alabama scored 35 first-half points, including three second-quarter touchdowns from Heisman winner DeVonta Smith, who accumulated more than 200 yards receiving before intermission. Alabama's offense set program records that season and Sarkisian is making his presence felt at Texas too with a top-five team entering the 2024 season.\n\nWhen Lane Kiffin reaches into his bag of tricks, especially on fourth down, you're defense is in for it. He's developed quite a reputation for his unpredictability in terms of play-calling and has finished inside the top 15 three times as a head coach, including twice at Ole Miss. With Jaxson Dart returning at quarterback this fall following an 11-win season, the sky is the limit for an offensive attack that goes five players deep at wide receiver and has an all-conference tight end. Kiffin went to the Nick Saban school of hard knocks as Alabama's play-caller after coaching at USC and Tennessee, something a couple others in this group have in common.\n\nDay said this summer he trusts Chip Kelly with his life, so hyperbole aside, suffice to say he's confident in the Ohio State offense and giving up play-calling duties in favor of the former UCLA coach. Kelly is known for his red-hot offenses at Oregon with Marcus Mariota and his tempo-based precision. With the Buckeyes, he'll have a wealth of talent to tinker with this season for one of the top-rated teams in college football. Leaving a head-coaching position for a coordinator role says a lot about where Kelly is during this stage of his coaching career.\n\n\"Oregon's guy\" is a diamond in the rough according to one coach, who highlighted the Ducks success with Bo Nix under the tutelage of Will Stein. Could he only be around for a couple seasons on Dan Lanning's staff in Egune? It's possible given the success level already achieved and now, Stein moves to former UCF and Oklahoma star Dillon Gabriel. Formerly a star on Jeff Traylor's UTSA staff, Stein played collegiately at Louisville and the former quarterback has mastered various offensive concepts and how to scheme guys open in the passing game. Well-respected within the coaching fraternity, Stein should get an opportunity to lead a program on his own very soon.\n\nPenn State has its star quarterback in Drew Allar, but needed to find a solution to unlocking his potential and the offensive output by the Nittany Lions. That is where Andy Kotelnicki comes into the picture after a successful three-year stint at Kansas. The new Penn State offensive coordinator is tasked with bringing more consistency and a potent passing attack to Happy Valley. The Jayhawks went from one of the worst offenses in the FBS to top-20 under the guidance of Kotelnicki. The only worry, according to a coaching source, is whether James Franklin will give Kotelnicki exclusivity with play-calling and not interfere.\n\nGus Malzahn, UCF\n\nMalzahn does things his way and offensively, there are few better at knowing which play to call at the opportune time. He was Auburn's OC during Cam Newton's run to a national championship and Heisman season before going to Arkansas State in 2012 and ultimately returning to the Plains to lead from 2013-20. He's 24-16 over three years at UCF and has former Arkansas quarterback KJ Jefferson to work with this fall in what's expected to be a ground-heavy attack with 1,400-yard ballcarrier RJ Harvey returning.\n\nCollin Klein, Texas A&M\n\nA couple Big 12 coaches spoke highly of Klein and said they were intrigued at the opportunities he'll have in College Station under Mike Elko. He's been one of the leaders at Kansas State since entering coaching in 2014, sans one season at Northern Iowa. Klein's goal in 2024 is to help develop Conner Weigman into an all-conference player and potential first-round pick.\n\nNeal Brown, West Virginia\n\nTalent has been an issue at times for Brown with the Moutaineers, but not this season. He's giving the keys to the offense to Garrett Greene, one of the more dynamic players at the position nationally. Brown likes to get the football quickly to playmakers in space and let them run. And Greene can move, too.\n\nZach Kittley, Texas Tech\n\nBefore calling plays for the Red Raiders, Kittley orchestrated the most potent offense in the Group of Five ranks — and second only to Ohio State nationally — in 2021 at WKU. The Hilltoppers led the nation in passing yards per game (433.7) and quarterback Bailey Zappe's 62 touchdown passes was 15 more than his nearest competitor (Heisman winner Bryce Young).\n\nBrennan Marion, UNLV\n\nMarion is coming up aces with the Runnin' Rebels thanks to his \"Go-Go Offense\", an attack designed to get you off-balance in the run game with tempo and spacing at the point of attack. Marion's name was mentioned by one coach who said he was a \"rising star\" in the profession.\n\nBilly Napier, Florida\n\nNapier is sticking to play-calling duties in his third season at Florida because, well, he's the best option the Gators have at doing so with the return of Graham Mertz at quarterback and the potential rise of five-star freshman DJ Lagway behind him. Napier first worked as OC at Clemson in 2009 before his career took off at Alabama, Arizona State and eventually as a successful head coach at Louisiana."
