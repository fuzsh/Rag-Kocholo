Last the world heard from Aaron Carter, he wasn't well. After spending two months toward the end of last year in rehab, Carter is now back, feeling "cautiously optimistic" about his health, and dropping new music. His new album — his first in 15 years! — is called LøVë and on it is the above remix of "I Want Candy."

Yeah. Like that "I Want Candy":

The new version came out on Valentine's Day and sounds like if now-30-year-old Aaron Carter were to sing his hit song "I Want Candy."

Wishing Aaron all the best (and thanks, @Aaron, for this pre-weekend trip down memory lane).
