It's one of Madonna's personal favourites from the album: \"I love Candy Shop coz it's cheeky and fun and it's the first thing I wrote with Pharrell, and I feel it sort of represents the fun, sassy side of me. And I just love the way it sounds. And I love candy!\"\n\nTour\n\n\"My sugar is raw, Sticky & Sweet!\" Having inspired the album and tour title, this track also got the privilege to open for both. A huge 'M' on the cubicle screen leads us to the Sweet Machine intro, which is heavily inspired by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It also takes the concept of a time portal by sampling the Donnie Darko soundtrack. Among the many Hard Candy snippets, there's the 'tick-tock' that serves as a leitmotif throughout the show. After the candy ball has been prepared and shot out, the pink letters C-A-N-D-Y blast on the screens and the upper stage spins around to reveal our Queen on her throne. Dressed in a black Givenchy ensemble, Madonna playfully poses with a large cane as she's joined by the dancers wearing top hats. Following her descent from the stairs, she gets her boots polished, and while candy patterns flash on the screens, she throws down an energetic choreography, making this tasty performance one of her danciest openers. On the 2009 leg, the backdrop video was replaced by Marilyn Minter's 'Green Pink Caviar' and Madonna wore a new outfit.\n\nMadonna did not lie when she claimed Candy Shop was one of her personal favourites, as it's among the songs that were repeated on the MDNA Tour right after the previous trek. During the highly sexual Masculine/Feminine segment, Madonna takes off her skeletal corset and channels one of her main inspirations, Marlene Dietrich as she appears in an androgynous outfit with her hair tied up. The setting turns into a brothel with a big chandelier and Madonna plays a madame (or a pimp) around her dancers who even offer her a drink. The opening track of Hard Candy gets a new arrangement, now heavily relying on seductive strings (sampling \"Ashamed of Myself\" by Kelley Polar). As an extra surprise in this unexpected performance, Madonna throws in the chorus of Erotica and she goes all literal with \"put your hands all over my body\" together with Brahim.\n\nMadonna loves to walk the fine line between unexpected and predictable, which is why Candy Shop made the setlist of the Rebel Heart Tour. As a now tried-and-true cabaret number for the third tour in a row, Madonna performs the briefest but sassiest rendition of Candy Shop in the Roaring Twenties final segment of the show introduced by the Give It 2 Me sample that gives us no break after the elongated Music performance. With an all-female choreography seen as an updated version of Hanky Panky, the insanely heavy bass driven version puts Madonna to her most carefree form. As one of the dancers go topless, they all perform a Charleston-inspired choreography for the fans near the catwalk."
