        "text": "Normani has shared a new single, “Candy Paint.” The fast-talking track is the second listen off the singer’s forthcoming debut solo LP, Dopamine, out June 14 via RCA Records. She previously teased the song in a trailer for the album earlier this month.\n\n“Candy Paint” follows “1:59” featuring Gunna, which Normani dropped in April. The song, written and produced by Normani alongside Brittanny “Starrah” Hazzard and Tommy Brown, sees her drawing inspiration from Houston’s iconic candy-painted lowriders. “If you let me take it you might not ever get him back, I’m a baddie and I don’t know how to act,” she sings. “Booty candy painting with the diamond in the back.”\n\nIn February, Normani revealed plans for Dopamine (though at the time, a release date was yet to be announced) and teased the new project with an image of the album cover. “It’s a representation of my evolution. It’s the version of me that’s been through some things over the course of the last few years,” Normani told Who What Wear when discussing the new songs on the LP.\n\nTrending\n\nSince launching her solo career in 2018, around the time that Fifth Harmony announced an indefinite hiatus, Normani has released numerous A-list collaborations and has hinted at a debut album for nearly six years.\n\n“For me, this upcoming album is not just about music coming out. It feels like a representation of everything I’ve gone through to get to this moment,” Normani told Who What Wear. “I know I needed time, experiences, and space coming out of [Fifth Harmony] in order to become the version of myself I needed to be. Without [all of that], I would not be able to exist within the creative space that I am in now. I would not be able to make the type of music I’m making now.”"
