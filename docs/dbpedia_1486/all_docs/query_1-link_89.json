        "text": "Brooke Candy has cooked up a treat and delivered with her second album CANDYLAND — her tasty, club-ready release expected to arrive in two parts.\n\nThe first installment, released in July as a 16-track, 37-minute-long project, was approached differently from the last album Candy put out five years ago. 2019’s SEXORCISM, which featured note-worthy collaborations with Charli XCX, Iggy Azalea, Ashnikko, and Bree Runway, blended her love for underground rap and trap while delivering uber-sexual, crass, and NSFW visuals and lyrics to match. CANDYLAND, on the other hand, presents itself with a wide range of pop genres from dance, future-pop, and experimental pop with a more toned-down, playful image.\n\nDubbed “candy-coated pop,” the California-born creative joins the likes of XCX, Tinashe, and Shygirl as forward-thinking, genre-bending stars setting their own rules. That said, the making of the album wasn’t a complete walk in the park. “At times it felt impossible to finish the record and get to a place I was happy with – I’ve never been so possessed with trying to get everything so perfect. The devil is in the details. It is a beautiful fantasy land for all the menaces in society. With this album, I tried to give a taste of each individual facet of my brain,” Candy says. “There’s a song for everyone and I tried to give as much sonic and artist feature variety as possible. It’s slutty but not crass. It’s hard, but still soft and femme. It’s candy-coated pop.”\n\nAs we continue to eat up part one and prepare for part two, EUPHORIA. caught up with Candy to discuss why she wanted to soften up her visuals, how Madonna and Britney Spears play a big part in her artistry, and what we can expect from future material.\n\nYou asked fans on Instagram to share their opinions on the album. How was their response?\n\nI think it was overwhelmingly positive. And I noticed many people saying that there were no skips on the album. That was a comment that I saw a lot, which was so cool. I was very honored to hear that. Of course, there was some hate as well. I had somebody write me a full novel about how the album was not cohesive, had no clear direction, and was all over the place. But then they ended their message with, “I love you, and I hope you’re not mad at me.” And I was like, “Wow. This is very interesting.” But, I mean, overall, people have been very kind.\n\nWhen you see comments like that, do you take them personally? Or do you accept that opinions exist on the internet for everyone?\n\nOh my gosh. I take everything personally. I can literally have thousands of positive comments and then if I have one negative comment, I will fixate on that and think about it and for a moment, believe it. I’m pretty good about snapping myself out of it and reminding myself that everyone has their opinion. It’s not the truth. But it definitely gets to me initially for sure.\n\nThe album artwork is also a slay! It’s probably my favorite visual of yours.\n\nThank you. My gosh. That was actually my friend, Jean Toir. He and I shot it in New York and it was totally unplanned. We just shot it for fun just as a little art project, and then the name came to me. When I was thinking about what I wanted to do for the visual, I already had the images. So it felt very kismet. I really appreciate it.\n\nYou’ve been vocal about wanting to tone down the hypersexual visuals for this album. What made you want to do that and was that an easy decision to make after building a following who loved you for that?\n\nI think it’s a combination of things. I think with my age and lifestyle choices, just the life I’m living, I feel it doesn’t really suit me as much anymore. And I feel like I’m kind of a method actor of it. And so if I am gonna say something in a song, I have to be living that lifestyle or it has to be true and honest. I’m more toned down and tame, I guess, sexually. Also, I feel like the hypersexual crass vibe is very oversaturated at the moment. I wanna use the right word here but it now feels a little bit corny.\n\nBeen there, done that kinda vibe.\n\nExactly. Been there, done that. I feel everybody’s doing it, or it’s not as interesting to me anymore, as an outsider. I kind of also feel like it leaves people out, so I wanna make music that doesn’t alienate anyone. I’m trying to figure out how how to straddle the line of being tongue-in-cheek and sexy and kinda naughty, but having it be more abstract and not so full-on crass words. And that’s actually what I did in a session yesterday. We were trying to do that and trying to figure out little phrases that we could come up with and words that we could create that would paint a picture that was more still sassy and naughty, but more beautiful and less gross.\n\nI feel you definitely found the balance with CANDYLAND. It doesn’t alienate the fans who loved SEXORCISM but will still welcome new listeners.\n\nThat was what I was trying to do. I feel I’m still learning and figuring it out. I’m still working on new music now, and I’m trying to go even further in that direction. Yesterday, we were pulling from Madonna a little bit. I think she mastered that with the Erotica album. When you listen to that album, you feel so sexy and confident, but she never cusses really at all. It’s all very clever and intellectual. I’m trying to figure out how to kind of get into that space. She’s my biggest inspiration for sure. I feel you wouldn’t think it because I make rap music and stuff, but Madonna will always be my Queen.\n\nWhen I was 19 or 20, I saw the Truth or Dare documentary for the first time and that literally changed my life. It changed the trajectory of my life. I was living in San Francisco. The room was filled with just drag queens and trans people and like queer people that I knew. These are people that I met after I graduated from high school, and they taught me how to exist. We all watched Truth or Dare together, and it was honestly a pivotal point in my life.\n\nFrom another Queen to another, Britney Spears’ Blackout album has been consistently referenced as an influence for this album. What are some of your favorite songs from that album?\n\n“Hot As Ice” is a good one. “Freakshow.” “Piece of Me.”\n\nEven “Gimme More” still slaps.\n\nYeah, “Gimme More.” The singles were honestly so good. I think it’s her magnum opus. She was just rebelling and it felt like her most punk moment. And the music itself was experimental for pop at the time. It’s a perfect album. It’s so badass. That’s the kind of album where she’s kind of doing the same thing we were saying about Madonna, where it’s not overtly crass but still sexy. And when you sing it, you just feel like such a bad bitch and so confident. It’s so cleverly done. That album is one of my big inspirations for sure. Britney in general is so cool.\n\nI can especially hear the Blackout influence on “Respectfully” and “Crisis.”\n\nOh, totally. The team I worked with on “Crisis,” my friend Liam [Benayon], who helped me write it, and then my friend Slush Puppy, who produced it, are all obsessed with Madonna as much as we are with Britney. And so we go in with those references every time we work together. We’re like, “How can we take the two best pop stars to ever exist and make something that feels fresh?” Obviously, their talent is just incredible. I’m not on that level by any means, but I am like, well, “What can I take from them just to make my own do my own thing?” I’m always trying to reference them when I can. They’re so cool.\n\nI read that a few years ago, you said you were on the verge of quitting music altogether. What inspired you to record and release again?\n\nThat’s such a good question. I haven’t really thought about it. I was going to quit because I think with the pandemic, honestly, I don’t think I understood how traumatized I was. It quite literally changed me as a person and pushed me into a new identity. And then I just randomly became a tattoo artist. Tattooing is so singular. It’s so peaceful. You just go to your little hobbit hole in your little area and you draw all day quietly while you listen to music. And then you just meet people one on one. They’re always super nice, and you just give them a tattoo that they’ll have for the rest of their life. It’s intimate and really sweet, and I just wanted that over the rat race of trying to be a musician, and I feel I’ve failed so many times. Like, all I did was fail on music. I felt so exhausted. I think that success is a perception of things. I felt a bit down on myself. And I got back into it from encouragement from friends who helped me to see a clear picture of my trajectory as a pop musician wasn’t a failure. I had quite a lot of success, and I shouldn’t just throw in the towel because I felt I hadn’t reached my peak. So I wanted to just try again. I feel there is an open pathway and a lane for what I wanna do right now, and I think that I feel pretty confident that I can accomplish more or I can at least have more moments that are successful and special because I don’t see many girls doing what I wanna do. I guess that is a strange way to put it, but I just wanna get out there again, and be a representation for the crazy, freaky girls.\n\nI needed time to recharge my mind and spirit and be excited again and be motivated and inspired to try really hard and put my whole pussy and my soul into it, and actually achieve something special. I just needed a little moment.\n\nThe song “Block” was co-written by Charli XCX. You two go way back. What is it like working with her all these years later and seeing her career and artistry blossom?\n\nOh, good. Well, I recorded it. She had actually written that song years ago. She gave it to me two years ago or something. And then I just had it. Charli is just incredible. She’s literally the biggest pop star in the world. I’ve gotten the opportunity to tour with her, go to parties with her, and hang out with her. She’s always been super nice and supportive. She actually texted me when my album came out. I had a little party and I had invited her but she’s busy 24 hours a day.\n\nShe’s busy living her Brat Summer life.\n\nShe’s literally living her biggest pop star in the world life. She did it. I think she always wanted to be like that. She’s too cool. Most of the biggest pop stars in the world, they’re super mainstream. They’re not very cool. Or if they are cool, they hire people to make them cool. But Charli is a cool person, so I feel that it took longer for the public to catch on. The underground always knew.\n\nI have to say, “Cloud Aura” still goes so hard.\n\nOh my god, that video. It’s literally ridiculous. I have three dots on my face and my nails are insane. The things you do when you’re 22 and drunk all the time.\n\nCANDYLAND is part one of what you’re releasing. For the second installment, which is expected to drop this year, can we expect a continuation or will it gear in a different direction?\n\nIt’s a continuation, but obviously, I have little moments that are so cunt and different. It actually has quite a few collaborations that I feel are really cool. I asked all my coolest artist friends if they would feature, and some are very surprising. Some songs have more than one collaboration. It’s kind of very surprising and unique how I’ve placed together, I think. It was all created in the same headspace. I consider it one body of work even though the two albums will have different names.\n\nYour first-ever US headline tour kicks off in September. Can we expect it to drop before then or will you tease the material at the shows?\n\nI want to drop it before the tour, for sure. That’s what I was actually talking about yesterday. I wanna drop that before the tour and then a little remix EP after the tour wraps.\n\nYou’ve started working on album number three. How far are you into the creative process and how is it sounding so far?\n\nIt’s in its very initial stages. It’s funny because the last two-part album took me a couple of years. I mean, I was doing other things with tattooing. There was not the same focus and then setbacks. I was making this music forever. I think this album will be a lot faster, and I’ll be able to crank it out in a few months. But I’m still just kind of figuring out if I wanna take it even more pop and try to make it really polished and radio-friendly. Madonna will be a reference."
