        "text": "Today’s Ted Tocks is a story about a feisty character from the Bronx who defied all odds to become a songwriter and producer, whose music we have enjoyed for six decades. Here is the brief story of Bert Berns. Please read on. It really is a fascinating rise to glory that ended too soon. Fortunately, the music lives on.\n\nHe wasn’t the best, but his best was certainly as good as anybody’s best.”\n\nJoel Selvin\n\nThis quote from Bert Berns’ biographer Joel Selvin who wrote ‘Here Comes the Night: The Dark Soul of Bert Berns and the Dirty Business of Rhythm and Blues’ sums things up effectively. Berns was born in 1929, into a family of Russian/Jewish heritage. As a child he contracted rheumatic fever and although he survived, the damage it did to his heart lingered for the rest of his life. As a youth he was told he likely would not live past the age of 30. With this ominous cloud hanging over his head, music served as a form of escape. His parents had hoped he would become a classical pianist, but he opted to go in another direction. As a young man he was fascinated by the rhythms of African American and Latino music. This took him to the expression of dance, in New York area nightclubs. When that became a little too predictable Bert Burns headed down to the vibrant night life of Havana, before the Cuban revolution. Legend has it, he even ran weapons for Fidel Castro and his revolutionaries before heading back to the safety of the ‘Big Apple’.\n\nWith these inspiring rhythms dancing in his head, Bert Berns began his seven year stint as a songwriter out of the famous Brill Building. His starting wage was $50/week. In his early days as a songwriter Berns also dabbled in recording, where he had moderate success.\n\nThe first song that Bert Berns wrote that is considered to be a classic, was ‘Twist and Shout’, written along with Phil Medley in 1961 and recorded by the Top Notes. Because Berns was seen as a fledgling, the studio brought in a couple of more experienced engineer/producers. Enter Teddy Randazzo and Phil Spector. The result was a Top Notes recording that bared no resemblance to the style Bert Berns envisioned. A year later Bert joined forces with The Isley Brothers and created the more gospel/soul recording we have all come to know and love. The Berns brilliance was captured in this quote from Richie Unterberger of All Music.\n\nThe real master trick of this rearrangement was a new bridge consisting solely of four ascending sung notes, the tempo becoming more emphatic and dramatic, ending in exultant sustained whooping before a “shake it on baby” led the Isleys back into the verse.”\n\nRichie Unterberger\n\nFollowing ‘Twist and Shout’ was a series of strong collaborations that included ‘Tell Him’ with The Exciters and ‘Cry Baby’ with Garnet Mimms. ‘Cry Baby’ would go on to become a hit for Janis Joplin.\n\nBy 1963, Bert Berns had made a name for himself. This success caught the attention of Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records. The catalyst to this rise was Berns’ association with Solomon Burke. Atlantic made Berns their staff producer, where he replaced the legendary duo of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. One of the first hits Berns and Burke produced was ‘Everybody Needs Somebody to Love’, which was closely followed by ‘Under the Boardwalk’ by The Drifters and ‘Baby I’m Yours’ by Barbara Lewis. The interesting thing about Bert Berns in these early days is he managed to buck a trend that saw early songwriting duos divide the songwriting responsibility into one half responsible for lyrics while the other focused on the music. At the Brill Building this typical split was evident in such combinations as Hal David and Burt Bacharach, Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, Gerry Goffin and Carole King and of course Leiber and Stoller.\n\nFor inspiration, Bert Berns managed to draw from personal experience. Oftentimes this told the tale of personal angst, sadness and unrequited love. An underlying theme was his heart. The musical tool of choice for Berns was a beat up acoustic guitar. The songwriter channeled his thoughts through this device and with the help of many prominent artists of the day, his stories became the soundtrack of many a music fan’s lives in the ‘60s. Playwright Daniel Goldfarb who wrote the biographical play ‘Piece of my Heart’ affirmed this observation.\n\nI feel like Bert Berns was an artist who had a lot stacked against him and had to fight his way through it. Even though his music is so diverse, the songs are autobiographical. That’s why he’s a great artist: He has a voice and knew how to tap into it.”\n\nDaniel Goldfarb\n\nAfter The Beatles enjoyed immense success with ‘Twist and Shout’ Bert Berns became highly sought after among the artists of the British Invasion. As a result, he was the first American songwriter to head over to London and share his work with bands such as The Animals and Them, just to name a few. Baby, Please Don’t Go by Them is a prime example. This act featured the legendary Van Morrison.\n\nBy 1965, Bert Berns was so accomplished he was approached by industry moguls Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun and Gerald (Jerry) Wexler. The acronym B.A.N.G. Records was the result, and for the better part of three years they became home to such artists as The McCoys (‘Hang on Sloopy’), Neil Diamond, Van Morrison and the Strangeloves who recorded today’s feature song (more on that later).\n\nAs an aside, Bert Berns created Shout Records as an outlet for his love of R&B and soul music. It was here that Berns wrote the classic song ‘Piece of My Heart’ which was recorded by Erma Franklin. A short time later it was covered by Big Brother and the Holding Company fronted by Janis Joplin.\n\nSome of you may be wondering why a songwriter with the stature of Bert Berns is not more prominent in music lore? The short answer is, as much as he enjoyed a seven year career that produced over fifty hits, he also made some powerful enemies along the way.\n\nFrom here you need to look no further than the men who ran Atlantic Records: the Ertegun brothers, Ahmet and Nesuhi, and their colleague, Mr. Wexler. Berns’ partners in BANG had a falling out that was extremely acrimonious. In ‘Here Comes the Night’ Selvin quoted Jerry Wexler, who died in 2008 as saying,\n\nI don’t know where he’s buried, but if I did, I would piss on his grave.”\n\nJerry Wexler\n\nAccording to these accounts, the Atlantic triumvirate tried to muscle Berns out of the music publishing part of the deteriorating relationship by summoning Mafia contacts to threaten him. Rather than giving in, Mr. Berns prevailed by turning to a higher-ranking friend of his own, in the mob. This friend was Thomas Eboli, who eventually became the boss of the Genovese crime family.\n\nNo one said the music world was a harmonious.\n\nOn a more positive front, there are many examples of artists who attribute elements of their success to Bert Berns. One such example exists in the form of an up and coming studio musician in London England. This guitarist was a strong ‘presence’ while Berns was working closely with artists looking to capitalize on the British Invasion gold mine. Here is a brief recollection:\n\nIn 1964, I arrived in New York in transit to Los Angeles as a guest of Bert Berns and his wife Ilene. It was my first time in the US. Bert was a legendary R&B producer and songwriter for Atlantic Records who was responsible for countless hits including The Isley Brothers’ Twist & Shout, Erma Franklin’s Piece of My Heart and Solomon Burke’s Everybody Needs Somebody. During my stay, Bert took me to the legendary Brill Building and Atlantic Records where I met Jerry Wexler, Nesuhi Ertegun, and Tom Dowd. When people visit America, the very first port of entry always has a lasting effect on them. It certainly did for me, feeling the energy of New York and being introduced to these musical icons. I had first met Bert when he came over to England. Atlantic Records were being distributed by Decca in the UK at the time. It was a pretty unique situation to have a producer come over from the States to work with in-house artists. One of the sessions that Bert did in London was Here Comes the Night with Lulu, which he was also to produce with Them. Lulu’s version was recorded in Decca Studios in Broadhurst Gardens, West Hampstead. She sings a really credible version, which is worth hearing. I played guitar on this and also did some guitar overdubs on it.”\n\nJimmy Page\n\nThis quote is from none other than future Led Zeppelin guitarist, Jimmy Page. The relationship with Bert Berns and the introduction to Atlantic Records, specifically Ahmet Ertegun served him well. By the end of the decade Led Zeppelin took flight on a legendary trip that is still the stuff of legend over a half century later. Bert Berns contribution to their success was never forgotten. Here is a song that they recorded in his honour. It was initially intended to be released on their iconic debut album, but it didn’t make the cut.\n\n‘Baby Come on Home’ was eventually released in 1993 as part of their ‘Boxed Set II’ compilation. It originated as ‘Tribute to Bert Berns. Jimmy Page never forgot what Bert Berns meant to his career. The fact the Mr. Berns died on December 30, 1967 was fresh in Page’s mind when the ‘New Yardbirds’ took to the studio in the early stages of the incarnation that would become Led Zeppelin, made this homage even more personal. Bert Berns died of heart failure in his Manhattan apartment. He was only 38 years old.\n\nBefore I move on, it should be noted that ‘Baby Come on Home’ was originally written by Bert Berns for Hoagy Lands in 1964. Here is his version.\n\nOut of all of this emerges today’s feature song. I told you I would get here eventually.\n\n‘I Want Candy’ was written by Bert Berns along with Bob Feldman, Jerry Goldstein and Richard Gottehrer over 55 years ago. The trio of Feldman, Gottehrer and Goldstein had just enjoyed success with The Angels and ‘My Boyfriend’s Back’ so they were hot. As performers they adopted the name, the Strangeloves and recorded this addictive hit with the obvious Bo Diddley beat. As a humorous aside the Strangeloves adapted Australian aliases; Miles, Niles and Giles Strange and posed in publicity photos wearing shaggy wigs, acting as ex-sheep farmers. A precursor to The Traveling Wilburys? Perhaps!\n\nIn the end the song became a big hit in the United States, Canada and naturally…Australia.\n\nIn 1982, a new wave act out of the U.K. known as Bow Wow Bow recorded ‘I Want Candy’. It became a new wave classic and it is still immensely popular to this day.\n\nWhile searching for other covers I was able to find this version by American alt rock/punk band Good Charlotte. Here is a scene from ‘Not Another Teen Movie’.\n\nHere is the full version of their release.\n\nHopefully today’s feature displays yet another example of how musical influence carries through the decades. For the purpose of today’s edition of Ted Tocks Covers I want to be sure that the credit goes right back to Bert Berns. An amazing music story that needs to be celebrated."
