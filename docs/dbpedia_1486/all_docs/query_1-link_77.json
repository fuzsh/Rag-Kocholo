        "text": "Post by ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡² dollybaby ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡² on\n\nMadonna's 11th studio album released on April 29, 2008. She had collaborated with Danja, The Neptunes, Timbaland, and Justin Timberlake. Madonna had initially decided to portray herself as the Black Madonna for the cover art, and also call the album \"Black Madonna\", but later felt the idea may have been seen as controversial. She instead named the album Hard Candy, which refers to the juxtaposition of toughness and sweetness. Critical reaction to the album were generally favorable, though some reviewers condemned it for its attempt to harness the urban market. On release Hard Candy debuted at number one in 37 countries worldwide, including the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom and became the eleventh best-selling album worldwide of 2008. The album has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide.\n\n\"Hard Candy\" is generally not considered a favorite among fans. It's tend to be ranked at the bottom of their Madonna albums lists. Personally, I actually had enjoyed the album when it first came out. I don't regard it highly as the same level with her 80s and 90s work, but I was highly addicted to tracks like \"Candy Shop\" and \"Heartbeat\". They were on instant replay back then. I also consider \"Miles Away\", \"Beat Goes On\", \"Dance 2Night\", \"4 Minutes\", and \"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\" to be personal favorites of mines.\n\nI think my fave memory of this era was when she had appeared on BET's 106 and Park for the first time, and she had that \"I hope these people would like me\" look on her face as she had walked in the studio after her name was being introduced. I also remember her saying that she likes listening to Jay-Z's music while cruising down in her car. I will never forget that moment. It's still fresh in my memory.\n\n4 Minutes: #3 Hot 100, #1 Dance, #5 Top 40\n\nGive It 2 Me: #57 Hot 100, #1 Dance\n\nMiles Away: #2 Dance"
