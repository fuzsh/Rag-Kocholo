At least for one of the verses.\n\nIt's not terrible. I think what made the original work really well is the exaggerated production and vibrant vocal. This comes off like some random and fairly bland YouTube cover.\n\nAnyway... nice True Blue tribute on the cover art.\n\nPost by Harx on\n\n@mello said:\n\n\"She's got everything that i desire.\"\n\nMaybe I'd appreciate this more - and find it far more interesting - if he kept the original \"he\" lyrics. At least for one of the verses.\n\nActual original version from the 60s has \"she\" in the lyrics.\n\nPost by Bwol on\n\nDid I wake up in the year 2000? Next thing I know, Jennifer Lopez will be releasing her next single and Kylie Minogueâ€™s new album will be out soon.\n\nOh wait."
