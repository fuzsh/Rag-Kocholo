I don't know who did but it wasn't him.\n\nHe was 12 years old when I Want Candy came out.\n\nHow do you get people to notice your singing?\n\nYou want to get people to notice your good singing voice? Here are some things you might want to try to get people to notice your singing: -If there is a talent show or something like that, sign up for it! It doesn't matter if you have a good voice or not. Join it! Sing! -If your friends wants to hear you sing, sing for them. They might think that you have a good voice and they'll tell people about how good your voice is, and others might want to hear you sing, too. -Sing in the shower. Get your parents to notice your voice and if they think it's good, they might ask you if you want to take voice lessons or not. -Sing when you're bored. Practice singing is always good (but not if you have a flu or cold. Let your voice rest when you have a cold). -Don't be afraid to sing in front of people if you want people to notice your voice. Yepp, that's what you might want to do. It's optional, though. If you're shy, you don't have to do it if you don't want to. You can always think of other ways to get people to notice your singing. I hope this help :) P.S. If you don't sing well, take lessons first!"
