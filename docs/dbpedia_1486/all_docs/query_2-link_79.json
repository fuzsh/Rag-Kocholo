Honestly can't tell if it's her or not, but probably not.\n\nView attachment 48358\n\nApple Music has it as just BILLIE with copyright Billie Deganutti. Itâ€™s not Piper. Maybe Spotify just got confused with Billie becoming Billie Piper.\n\nIt's really nice to see some of her singles on streaming! I think I'm happiest to have the radio mix of \"Girlfriend,\" but the b-sides to \"Honey to the B\" are also very welcome!\n\nWhat is this? Says it was released last week. Honestly can't tell if it's her or not, but probably not.\n\nView attachment 48358\n\nFor a very split second I thought Billie might have actually pulled something iconic and surprise dropped a new single the same week as her earlier singles were digitized. Obviously, it's just a mix up.\n\nThe title \"Fucked Up World\" does remind me of I Hate Suzie. When it premiered, my partner and I joked that she should release \"Fuck This Life\" (that she sings in the first episode) as a single so her singles discography would go: \"Walk of Life\" (2000), [twenty year gap], \"Fuck This Life\" (2020).\n\nDoes anyone know much about this promo at all? It lists \"I Want Candy (Sgt Rock Mix)\" as a bonus track but I've not seen anything of that track anywhere else?\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/release/26738759-Billie-Billie\n\nThat will probably be the Sgt. Rock 'Old Skool' Mix of Because We Want To labeled incorrectly."
