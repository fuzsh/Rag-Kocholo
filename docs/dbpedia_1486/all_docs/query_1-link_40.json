        "text": "“I wanted to be a singer since I was very, very little,” Carter, who began singing at age seven, once said in an interview in 1998, when he was around 10 years old. “The first thing I did is I asked my mom, and she said ‘I’ll take you to lessons.’ So she started taking me to lessons.”\n\n“I love this job to much, and I’m always going to be doing it, all my life,” he added.\n\nBefore Carter embarked on his journey to child pop stardom, he tested the waters locally as a little kid: “I was in a rock band that was horrible, called Dead End,” Carter is quoted as telling PBS. “The name kind of described us. People liked us. We would go and perform at coffee houses and stuff. I was always off-key, and the band was always off-key. They would always mess up — drop their guitars right on stage. I would be head-banging. I had long hair. It was fun, though. I enjoyed it.”\n\nFor his first public solo performances, Carter started big: opening for the Backstreet Boys. Video footage from concerts in Germany circa 1997 show him taking the stage for a high-energy cover of The Jets’ “Crush on You.”\n\n“Crush on You” became his official first single, released on Aug. 15, 1997. Older brother Nick made a cameo in a music video for the bubblegum pop song, offering his little bro advice about how to get a girl to notice him.\n\nAaron’s first studio album, which was self-titled, made its debut in Europe on Dec. 1, 1997, before being marketed to the U.S.\n\n2001 was a year of some memorable appearances on popular scripted TV shows for Carter. On Feb. 23, 2001, he was seen on an episode of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, leading an “I Want Candy” dance party on the beach.\n\nCarter guest starred on a Lizzie McGuire episode that aired on the Disney Channel on March 23, 2001, performing “I Want Candy.” In the episode, Hilary Duff’s Lizzie gushes, “Aaron Carter coming here is the most exciting thing that’s ever happened to us! He’s cute, he’s cool, he’s talented.” She ends up meeting Aaron under the mistletoe, where he gives her a quick kiss.\n\nIn April 2001, he took his acting to Broadway, where he made his debut as JoJo in Seussical.\n\nCarter kept busy that year: He released a third studio album, Oh Aaron, notably featuring his first recorded duet with his brother Nick. Oh Aaron reached No. 7 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and had singles that included the Nick Carter and No Secrets collab of the same name, “Oh Aaron,” as well as “Not Too Young, Not Too Old” and “I’m All About You.”\n\nAnother Earthquake! was Carter’s fourth studio album, released on Sept. 3, 2002, and it peaked at No. 18 on the Billboard 200. “Another Earthquake!” the song was one of the collection’s singles, as well as “Summertime” (feat. Baha Men), “To All the Girls” and “Do You Remember.”\n\n“It was my favorite album I ever did as a child,” Carter said in an interview years later, in 2020.\n\nThe young star was also tapped that year to sing a theme song for PBS’ Liberty’s Kids, “Through My Own Eyes.”\n\nFeb. 10, 2017 introduced fans to Carter’s evolved sound and what was to come on his next full-length album with his five-song LØVË EP, which included “Fool’s Gold” and new single “Sooner or Later.”\n\n“The LØVË album and ‘Fool’s Gold’ era has been D.I.Y. hustle since day one,” the singer told Billboard at the time. “Everything from the production, songwriting, mixing, photoshoots, music videos, packaging and distribution have been a collective involvement from a team I like to call ‘Team Fool’s Gold.’ The rest of the team is Jon Asher, Melanie Fontana, Michel (Lindgren) Schulz, Taylor (Lakestreet Louis) Helgeson.”"
