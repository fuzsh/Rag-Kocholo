Lewis in galley proof form and thereafter taking a key part in the packaging. Sinatra obviously couldn’t be made to look like Lewis; and Lewis’ style of delivery is unique. But these are minor reservations in light of the major job Sinatra does – alternately sympathetic and pathetic, funny and sad.\n\nEddie Albert plays Austin Mack, Lewis’ longtime piano accompanist and intimate friend, with considerable feel. Jeanne Crain is touching and fits in fine as the wealthy gal who falls for Lewis (and he for her). The leggy, shapely, cutie-pie-faced Mitzi Gaynor is colorful as a chorus dancer who marries Lewis after Crain takes the powder.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nUnder Charles Vidor’s direction, Joker plays out in well organized and smooth fashion. But it goes overboard on length.\n\n1957: Best Song (‘All the Way’)"
