        "text": "Rita Hayworth (1918 - 1987) became known as a famous Hollywood actress and iconic screen siren who was directed by Charles Vidor in \"The Lady in Question\" (1940), \"Cover Girl\" (1944), \"Gilda\" (1946), and \"The Loves of Carmen\" (1948). Hayworth also appeared in the film, \"Affair in Trinidad\" (1952). This is a film that was directed by Vincent Sherman and not Charles Vidor.\n\nIn \"Affair in Trinidad\", Rita Hayworth stars with Glenn Ford. Ford plays Steve Emery and journeys to Trinidad, where he finds that his brother has been murdered. His brother's gorgeous wife, Chris Emery (Hayworth), seems to be nuzzling up to the culprit. It doesn't take long before Steve falls for the sultry beauty (Chris). He also finds that he will have to deal with the sizzling drama, international intrigue, and harsh conflicts that cling to Chris."
