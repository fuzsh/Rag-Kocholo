However, when Lewis opened without incident at the new club, she and other Chicago reporters of the time assumed the mobsters had a change of heart. Weeks later, however, Lewis suffered his near-fatal attack, as depicted in the film.\n\nIn Oct 1955, LAT reported that Lewis turned down $150,000 from M-G-M for the film rights to his life story, instead opting to have it produced as an independent feature by his old friend, Frank Sinatra. Var reported in Nov 1955 that Paramount had agreed to finance the independent production, which was to be headed up by Lewis, Sinatra, director Charles Vidor and Art Cohn, author of the Lewis biography The Joker is Wild, under the corporate name A.M.B.L. Productions. The studio agreed to pay the four partners $400,000, along with seventy-five percent of the film's net profits, and assigned Samuel J. Briskin to oversee the film's production. According to NYT, Sinatra's share of the partnership was $125,000, along with twenty-five percent of the film's profits. The DV review points out that supporting actor Hank Henry was the \"perpetual motion comic at Las Vegas' Silver Slipper.\"\n\nAccording to the file on the film in the MPAA/PCA Collection at the AMPAS Library, the songs \"Greatest Little Sign in the World,\" by James Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn, and \"The Bird Song,\" by Ben Oakland and Eddie Maxwell, were submitted to the PCA for use in The Joker Is Wild, but were rejected outright for their sexually suggestive lyrics. Van Heusen and Cahn received an Academy Award for their musical composition \"All the Way,\" which became one of Sinatra's signature songs.\n\nHR news items include Percy Helton in the cast, but he was not in the print viewed. The Joker Is Wild marked the last film of long-time character actor Harold Huber (1904--1959). Modern sources add the following names to the crew credits: Orch Leo Shuken and Jack Hayes.\n\nModern sources also report that a controversial event occurred following the film's premiere in Las Vegas, when Sinatra and his date, actress Lauren Bacall, walked out of Lewis' show at the El Rancho Vegas after the comedian, contrary to a prior agreement with his old friend, asked Sinatra to join him on stage and sing a song. It was claimed that a drunken Lewis had forgotten that Sinatra made it a policy never to perform anywhere in Las Vegas other than the Sands.\n\nLess\n\nIn prohibition-era Chicago of the late 1920s, up-and-coming nightclub singer Joe E.

Despite his insecurity about the differences in their social backgrounds, Joe and Letty are soon seeing each other regularly, and Joe starts a new career as a nightclub comedian, with Austin once again his accompanist. On the closing night of his highly successful Miami run, Joe announces two new engagements: his upcoming New York opening at the Copacabana, and his marital engagement to Letty. After returning to New York, however, Joe is told by his physician that his chronic alcoholism is killing him, and then learns his Copa opening has been cancelled following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Joe breaks his engagement to Letty and leaves on an overseas U.S.O. tour with Austin. Returning stateside months later, Joe has a change of heart and decides to settle down with Letty, only to learn from Cassie, Austin's wife, that his ex-fiancée has already married someone else. On the rebound, Joe marries Martha Stewart, one of the dancers in his nightclub act. Rather than leaving on a honeymoon, the two immediately go back to work, with Joe returning to the nightclub circuit, while Martha pursues an acting career in Hollywood. The newlyweds see little of each other, as she works all day, and he performs, drinks and gambles all night. Realizing that her marriage is in shambles, Martha follows Joe to Las Vegas, and, in a drunken stupor, she asks him for a divorce. That night, Joe attacks a heckler who insults Martha, and in the ensuing scuffle, he mistakenly punches Austin. With both his wife and his best friend lost to him, Joe returns to Chicago after a three-week hospital stay, where he visits the boarded-up Club 777. As visions from his past haunt him in various storefront windows, Joe is finally forced to look at himself and realizes that there is a life beyond the bottle. Having spent much of his life making others laugh, Joe now pledges to find humor and enjoyment in life for himself.\n\nLess"
