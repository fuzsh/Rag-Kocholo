        "text": "THURSDAY, MAY 30 AT 11:00AM\n\nRegular Admission Prices\n\nPasses Accepted\n\nExperience the greatest films from Hollywood’s Golden Age back on the big screen, every week at The Loft Cinema!\n\n“Gilda, are you decent?” Rita Hayworth tosses her hair back and slyly responds, “Me?” in one of the great star entrances in movie history. Gilda, directed by Charles Vidor, features a sultry Hayworth in her most iconic role, as the much-lusted-after wife of a criminal kingpin (George Macready), as well as the former flame of his bitter henchman (Glenn Ford), and she drives them both mad with desire and jealousy. An ever-shifting battle of the sexes set on a Buenos Aires casino’s glittering floor and in its shadowy back rooms, Gilda is among the most sensual and surprising of all Hollywood noirs. (Dir. by Charles Vidor, 1946, USA, 110 mins., Not Rated)"
