        "text": "This biographical drama stars Frank Sinatra in the story of entertainer Joe E Lewis, who had to reassess his career after being viciously attacked by the Mob.\n\nSinatra really manages to find the turmoil and conflict in the role, as Lewis’ personal life starts to spin out of control, and he gives a committed performance. Although the tone is quite downbeat, the film manages to explore a fascinating real life figure, although I think it’s a bit hesitant to get too dark at certain points in the story.\n\nIt’s quite long, and the amount of shows featured made everything feel slightly self-indulgent and repetitive by the end, although it still has some powerful moments. The way that Sinatra shows Lewis…\n\nAll The Way\n\n\"Post time!\"\n\nJoe E. Lewis gets a big break early in his career to sing at a bigger nightclub, but his current boss doesn't want him to go. In those days nightclub owners could be quite shady types and this one was no different - the film doesn't say it with that many words but the club was owned by a straw man for Al Capone - and Lewis would pay a huge price for leaving. He was viciously attacked, vocal chords slashed, skull bashed in and left for dead. It took him years to regain speech, but he would never sing the way he could. His trusted accompanist Austin Mack follows him wherever he goes, even…\n\nWhat an interestingly dark musical. Sinatra plays singer, Joe E Lewis, who's vocal chords get slashed by the mob and it takes him years to recover while becoming an alcoholic. It's a great bio, but having said that, I can't decide whether I liked Sinatra in that role or not. He plays a great mumbling alcoholic and Jeanne Crain is absolutely STUNNING in this pic, even though you don't see her until well into the movie. It's also nice to see a young Mitzi Gaynor taking a risk here. You don't see her getting drunk too often in her pics, so that was a nice change of pace. Someone who stole the movie for me, was Eddie Albert as Sinatra's…"
