He first came to prominence during the final years of the silent film era. Among his film successes are The Bridge (1929), Cover Girl (1944), A Song to Remember (1945), Gilda (1946), The Loves of Carmen (1948), Love Me or Leave Me (1955), The Swan (1956), The Joker Is Wild (1957), and A Farewell to Arms (1957). He was married four times, to Frances Varone (1927–1931), actress Karen Morley (1932–1943), actress Evelyn Keyes (1943–1945), and Doris Warner (1945-1959, until his death), daughter of Warner Bros.
