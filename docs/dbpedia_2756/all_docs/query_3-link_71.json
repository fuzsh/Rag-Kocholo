        "text": "PASO ROBLES, Calif.\n\nIT is just like the journey to Spanish Bit, Lionel Barrymore's grandiose ranch house in King Vidor's celebrated baroque Western, “Duel in the Sun.” The driveway sweeps through yellow rolling fields and clumps of eucalypt and conifer, up a steep incline through a roughhewn gate to a low‐lying house at the crest. Magnificently youthful and handsome at 78, Vidor comes to the front door himself, wearing a Western ranch tie clipped by a sterling silver medallion with the initials KV in turquoises, a white Western shirt, cotton pants and hand‐made brown leather boots. He walks from the hall to the window of his living room, gazing in a manner befitting his kingly name over his 1,248 acres of choice central California territory. In the remote distance, Hereford cattle graze peacefully, horses frisk in a paddock, clumps of oak trees toss in a spanking breeze. It is a classically appropriate setting for this master of the American rural film.\n\nThough he retired from feature film‐making in 1959, King Vidor is still active as a movie‐maker: like a young student of the medium that fascinates him, as much as it did 60 years ago, he has created a beautiful short film on 16mm, “Truth and Illusion,” an abstract work consisting of images of nature, pure distillations of his vision of life. This past Friday, the Museum of Modern Art in New York began a major three‐month retrospective season of his movies, ranging over 50 years from “The Jack‐Knife Man” (1919) to “Truth and Illusion.” On Thursday he will be in New York with Colleen Moore, the deliciously amusing comedienne of such Twenties classics as “Flaming Youth” and “Ella Cinders,” to introduce his 1928 Marion Davies vehicle “Show People” at the Museum, and to join in the festivities.\n\nKing Vidor's romance with Colleen Moore (b. 1900) is already a Hollywood legend. They first met in 1921, when he was married to his boyhood sweetheart, Florence Vidor: he directed Colleen in “The Sky Pilot.” They fell in love, and their affair continued until 1924. They met again exactly 40 years later; Vidor heard from Hedda Hopper that Colleen now lived in Chicago, and when he was there he made a point of seeing Colleen again. They resumed their romance with much of its original intensity. Now she lives some 15 minutes drive away across the Paso Robles hills, in her own splendid homestead, El Ranchito. “We have the same sense of humor, and we both love to travel,” Vidor says. They have just returned from a two‐month cruise of the South Seas and the Orient, where they bought paintings and carvings and screens for Colleen's immense collection of Oriental art.\n\nAbove all, they share a passion for the land. Vidor has always been a poet of the American landscape, creating vivid images of rural life in such films as “The Texas Rangers,” “Billy The Kid,” “Hallelujah,” “Northwest Passage” and “Duel in the Sun.” He has been from the outset a rebel in the Hollywood system, striking out for his own ideas. At the beginning, he championed the common man, most notably in his masterpiece “The Crowd” and in “Our Daily Bread,” more recently the rugged individualist, in such less admired films as “The Fountainhead” and “Beyond the Forest.” But his humanism, his passionate love of life, have never deserted him.\n\n“When I was a young kid in Texas at the beginning of the century, I used to hate movies. I hated their phoniness, their fakiness, the makeup which used to mask the actors’ expressions, their dreadful unreal acting with overdone pantomime gestures.\n\n“People find them laughable today. found them laughable then. I felt drama would be more vital if you could believe events were really happening while you were looking at them. I wanted to focus on small, important things. I decided in my teens to make pictures which would make people feel they were reliving their day‐to‐day lives through the characters.”\n\nHe began by shooting small films in Texas. with borrowed money—mostly documentaries about small‐town life, or the life of the soil. Later, a team of businessmen supported him in making a work exemplifying his own Christian Science principles—“The Turn of the Road.” He and his young wife Florence. Vidor started out for Hollywood in a Model T Ford and arrived with 50 cents between them; they landed jobs as extras, and he also worked as a general handyman. His first important break came with a contract from First National, which allowed him to make a simple film about an old man and a boy on a Mississippi shanty boat, “The JackKnife Man.”\n\nVidor went on to make a number of famous silent films, including “Happiness” with Laurette Taylor (which opened the Museum's season) and “The Wine of Youth.” None of these really exemplified his principles of subdued realism, but in 1925 at last he got his chance with “The Big Parade.” “I wanted to make an honest war picture. Until then, they'd been all phony, glorifying officers and warfare. There hadn't been a single picture showing the war from the viewpoint of ordinary soldiers and privates, not one that was really anti‐war.\n\n“Before the picture was released, I anticipated an attack from militarist factions. But there was none. In fact, one of the Duponts, who was one of the big war material manufacturers, visited the set and said that if exhibitors refused to handle the picture he would supply a tent to show it in. He liked it very much. Actually, the picture was a huge success. nobody criticized it, and it made a fortune. It really put me on the map as a big director.\n\n“Irving Thalberg asked me what I could do to cap it. I came up with the idea of ‘The Crowd,’ which I made in 1928. The Big Parade’ was one man's view of war. A simple man. I thought, ‘Why not do a movie reviewing life in peacetime?’ Thalberg said, when I gave him the whole outline, ‘Well, I guess we can afford one experimental film.’ So he let me do it. I showed a young couple, poor and struggling, getting married, going to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon, having a baby, the baby gets killed, we see the man in an office with desks as far as the eye can see, and at the end they are simply swallowed up in a mass of humanity.\n\n“The male star was an extra I discovered, James Murray. Later on he fell or jumped into the East River during a drinking bout and drowned. The girl was my then wife, Eleanor Boardman. [Married in 1926, Vidor and Miss Boardman were divorced in 1933.] Louis B. Mayer didn't like ‘The Crowd’ at all. In those days the Academy Awards were decided by a handful of people, including Douglas Fairbanks, Joe Schenck, Louis B. Mayer and Sid Grauman. The others wanted the picture to have an award, but Mayer wouldn't go for it. It was his own picture, but it was unglamorous, against the studio's image.”\n\nFrom then on, Vidor tried to sustain his vision by bargaining, making one realistic film for every three or four “studio pictures.” In 1929, he succeeded in inducing Thalberg to let him make the superb all‐Black “Hallelujah,” about a revivalist minister in the Deep South who falls in love with a good‐time girl. “MGM let me do it, but the New York office wouldn't distribute it. Loew's Inc. turned it down flat. They feared that too many black people would come into the theaters. It barely got released at all.”\n\nIn 1934, when Vidor wanted to make “Our Daily Bread,” a film about out‐ofwork people in the Depression who join together on a cooperative farm in order to survive, Thalberg of MGM said it was out of the question. Vidor mortgaged his house and sold everything he owned to do the picture. “It could have ruined me. Luckily, it made its money back out of individual theaters which booked it. Of course, I was accused of being a Communist. And then, when it went to the Moscow Film Festival, the Russian critics said it showed ‘evidence of Capitalist thinking.’ “\n\n“The Big Parade” and “Our Daily Bread,” which is currently being re‐discovered through its showings on public television, were the first and second parts of a trilogy Vidor thought of as “War, Wheat and Steel.” It was not until 1944, after a string of conventional successes, including “Stella Dallas,” “The Citadel” and “H. M. Pulham Esquire,” that Vidor got the chance to make the “Steel” portion. He called it “An American Romance.”\n\n“It was the story of a simple immigrant who rises through his own efforts in a world of machines, but doesn't lose his common humanity. I wanted to show how a man can become a major figure in an industry and still put on a pair of overalls and sweat and fix something when it goes wrong. The studio cut so much out of the picture, so many of the realistic scenes of factory lice, that was ruined.” Disappointed in the film, many critics noted that Vidor was now celebrating the individualist against the masses in his central figure of a Fordlike tycoon.\n\nVidor's earlier movies had tended to emphasize the virtues of the common man. But gradually he came to believe that the individualist was the most important of beings, that a man must ignore received opinion and hold ruthlessly to what he believes. Just recently, he has even gone a step further, developing a Berkeleyan theory of solipsism: today he believes that nothing in the world exists except in the individual consciousness.\n\n“In 1948 I got a chance to show how I felt about individualism in ‘The Fountainhead,’ from the novel by Ayn Rand. Miss Rand's central character, Howard Roark, an architect who follows his own principles of avant‐garde design regardless of the consequences, who has a contempt for mass culture, appealed to me tremendously. Miss Rand certainly lived up to her own principles. She said, ‘I have a bomb in my pocket and I'm going to blow up the studio if they change a line of my script.’ She wrote the script for nothing rather than let the studio, Warners, use an inferior screenplay.\n\n“When I made the picture, with Gary Cooper as Roark, I thought the hero's action was too extreme in blowing up an apartment building because it had been a travesty of his original concept. Now I'm not so sure.”\n\n“Beyond the Forest,” which followed “The Fountainhead” in 1949, was the story of a woman, Rosa Moline, played by Bette Davis, trapped in a marriage to a small‐town doctor. Like Howard Roark, Rosa strikes out for individual freedom. “I had some trouble with Bette on that picture. I suppose I exerted my will over hers. I told her to throw a bottle a certain way in a quarrel scene and she wouldn't. She stormed off the set and said to Jack Warner, ‘Either he goes or I do.’ Her career had been on a downgrade. He told her who would go. A couple of days later they cleared out her bungalow. She came to me and said, ‘After 16 years, they can do this to me?’\n\n“I'll never forget, years later, going to see ‘Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? When Elizabeth Taylor said, just like Bette in ‘Beyond the Forest’ What a dumppp!’ with all those p's I was stunned. It brought on an overpowering sense of total recall.”\n\n“The Fountainhead” and “Beyond the Forest” with “Ruby Gentry,” in which Jennifer Jones played a ferocious “free woman,” became a trilogy. “People said these pictures were unrealistic, exaggerated. But they weren't. They emphasized in a heightened realistic form, the frustrations and ambitions of real Americans. Let me give you an example. In “Ruby” I had a scene in which the lovers drive their cars into the moonlit sea off a beach. Unreal? Exaggerated? No. I added it to the script myself because I had recalled something from my own experience I wanted to use. In my part of Texas, lovers would drive out to the shore, gaze at the moon, neck, and by the time they wanted to move the tide had come in and they were stuck. At other times they would just, in the heat of the moment and for a joke, drive right into the sea deliberately. Crazy? Yes, but it really happened.”\n\nAfter the much‐criticized “War and Peace” in 1956 and “Solomon and Sheba” in 1959 (ruined because Tyrone Power died during the shooting and the film had to be hurriedly reshot with Yul Brynner) Vidor retired. He had bought his great ranch at Paso Robles in 1946, when he was shooting “Duel in the Sun” (he shot some of “Ruhy Gentry” there). He was glad to spena more time there, and he began writing philosophical essays and a screenplay based on the life of Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science. After “Truth and Illusion” he plans to make a film called “Solipsism,” about which, he feels, it is too early to talk. Despite his years, he gives an impression of immense vitality, talking vividly about the Paso Robles country, about his travels, about his undying love of motion pictures.\n\n“My first pictures back in Texas were documentaries. I guess you can say the wheel has swung full circle. And one thing I've kept all along. My feeling for the soil.”\n\nThe great director strides back to the view of his 1,248 acres. In the amphitheater of hills, during the hours we have talked, the light has changed. The shadows are lengthening across the valley, the horses are as still as statues in the paddock, the cattle have moved out of sight. King Vidor stretches out his arms like a patriarch. “I love this country,” he says."
