        "text": "*Eliot, T.S.\n\nhome\n\ntable of content\n\nunited architects – essays\n\ntable of content all sites\n\nEliot, T.S.\n\nAmerican/British, 1888–1965\n\nThe most influential and, arguably, the most important poet writing in English in the 20th century, T.S.Eliot was also a master essayist. As significant, for contemporary readers, writers, scholars, and teachers of literature in English as his thematic and stylistic innovations in Modernist poetry were his critical analyses and gnomic pronouncements in numerous essays, several of which have become classics of the genre: “Tradition and the Individual Talent” (1919), “Hamlet” (1919), “The Metaphysical Poets” (1921), “The Function of Criticism” (1923), “Dante” (1929), “Milton I” (1936), “What Is a Classic?” (1945), “To Criticize the Critic” (1961), and many more. Beyond literary criticism, there are also Eliot’s essays on sociological, educational, and theological subjects: “Thoughts After Lambeth” (1931) and “Modern Education and the Classics” (1932), for example. Two longer works of this kind, The Idea of a Christian Society (1939) and Notes Towards the Definition of Culture (1948) are properly classified as extended essays. Furthermore, in the way of articles and reviews, in the 60 years from 1905 to his death, Eliot contributed some 600 pieces to periodicals such as the Little Review and the Times Literary Supplement. As editor of the Criterion, Eliot was able to nurture the careers of other essayists, just as he promoted the works of younger poets at Faber and Faber.\n\nIn his literary-critical essays, especially those gathered in his most important collection, Selected Essays (1932; revised and enlarged, 1934, 1951), Eliot’s principal purpose is “the elucidation of works of art and the correction of taste” (“The Function of Criticism”). Most of the “works of art” to which he refers are from the English Renaissance and the “correction of taste” which he would accomplish is that to which he aspired in his own poetry: the eradication of the prevailing hegemony of Romantic priorities and practices (in their Edwardian and Georgian forms) in literary criticism and creativity. However, Eliot wanted to revive not only the appreciation of the artistry of the 17th-century poets, dramatists, and prose writers, but something, too, of the spirit of their cohesive civilization (as he envisaged it) in the fragmented modern world of The Waste Land.\n\nSo when Eliot defined “the general point of view” of his “Essays on Style and Order,” For Lancelot Andrewes (1928), as “classicist in literature, royalist in politics, and anglocatholic in religion,” his inspiration for these convictions came from Jacobean and Caroline England, in the lives and works of such as Andrewes himself, a translator of the Authorised Version of the Bible (1611), and Bishop of Winchester, whose sermons Eliot celebrates for their harmony of “intellect and sensibility” (“Lancelot Andrewes”). Later in the 17th century, however, in the discord of the Civil War, Eliot identified “a dissociation of sensibility…from which we have never recovered” (“The Metaphysical Poets”). This was not merely literary, but cultural and spiritual as well.\n\nThe association of “ordonnance, or arrangement and structure, precision in the use of words, and relevant intensity” that Eliot admired in Andrewes’ sermons is to be found in his own essays. They exhibit the combination of carefully evolved frameworks of argument (Eliot had begun as a philosopher), intellectual acuteness (seasoned with provocative aperçus), and impassioned assessment. Eliot’s is a prose decidedly not written, as Milton claimed his to be, with the poet’s “left hand.” His intended readership was those with a measure of his own literary culture. Many examples are occasional pieces, such as reviews. Yet as Eliot emerged as the premier poet of the modern age, his prose writings were also disseminated to a wider audience. The brilliant insights and sweeping generalizations achieved the status of canon law, and toward the end of his life Eliot confessed to having been dogged by his quotable pronouncements long after they had ceased to be adequate statements of his convictions (“To Criticize the Critic”).\n\nThe famous essay of 1919, “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” is a case in point, its very title being a credal statement about the combination and tension between received and innovative elements in literature. It first appeared in the Egoist and contains an untranslated quotation from Aristotle and references to Homer and Dante, in combination with Modernist convictions about objectivity in creativity and criticism—revolutionary by the literary standards of the time. Eliot’s procedure enacts his thesis, culminating in the declaration: “Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.”\n\nSuch dicta transformed literary criticism in the 20th century, as Eliot enunciated the precepts by which his own poetry—with its wry, ironic, and fastidious detachment— could be enjoyed: “the more perfect the artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates.” The confrontation of the classical ideal and Romantic experience which Eliot constructs in his essays, and the refinement of the latter by the former, is the leitmotif of his theory: “Tennyson and Browning are poets, and they think; but they do not feel their thought as immediately as the odour of a rose. A thought to Donne was an experience; it modified his sensibility” (“The Metaphysical Poets”).\n\nEliot’s individualistic essays, that is to say, in their iconoclastically legislative character, belong to “the tradition,” as represented in the 19th century by Matthew Arnold’s Essays in Criticism (1865–88) and, in the 18th, by Samuel Johnson’s Lives of the English Poets (1779–81). In “Hamlet,” for example, Eliot employs the quasi- Arnoldian touchstone of the “objective correlative” to pronounce, with a Johnsonian absoluteness, Shakespeare’s tragedy a failure. This judgment, as startling as Johnson’s repudiation of Milton’s “Lycidas,” derives from Eliot’s conviction that there is not “a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events” (that is, an “objective correlative”) to justify the emotion of the central character. Hamlet is “dominated by an emotion which…is in excess of the facts as they appear.”\n\nWith Milton, Eliot dealt even more rudely. F.R.Leavis, the Cambridge critic who was a principal purveyor of Eliot’s poetry and literary criticism, summarized (approvingly) the devastating effect of Eliot’s assessment, culminating in the essay of 1936, “Milton I”:\n\n“Milton’s dislodgment, in the past decade, after his two centuries of predominance, was effected with remarkably little fuss. The irresistible argument was, of course, Mr. Eliot’s creative achievement; it gave his few critical asides—potent, it is true, by context—their finality” (“Milton’s Verse,” 1936). The matter was not finalized, however. In “Milton II” (1947), Eliot substantially repudiated his earlier indictments. Here and elsewhere, we can trace the evolution of his thought in the sequence of his essays.\n\nLeavis took a phrase from Eliot—his definition of the collaborative process of literary criticism as “the common pursuit of true judgement” (“The Function of Criticism”)—for the title of his critical collection, The Common Pursuit (1952), which was one of several studies by scholars and, perhaps more importantly, teachers of international stature and influence who propagated Eliot’s precepts in the universities in the mid-20th century.\n\nTheir graduates took these ideas into the secondary schools to the point where, for two or three generations, Eliot’s literary-critical essays were formative and formidable across the gamut of English studies. The origin of the so-called “New Criticism” of the 1940s, for example, may be traced to the Cambridge of Leavis, I.A.Richards, and William Empson of the 1920s, and they had taken their cue from Eliot.\n\nThe breadth of Eliot’s subject matter in his essays, beyond literary criticism, must be emphasized. In “Second Thoughts About Humanism” (1929), for example, the philosopher is to the fore; in “The Aims of Education” (1950), the cultural critic and theologian; while in “Marie Lloyd” (1923), an essay on “the greatest music-hall artist of her time,” we are struck by Eliot’s humanity.\n\nHis two long essays remain to be mentioned. The Idea of a Christian Society began as a series of lectures at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in March 1939, which were published later that year. Eliot reflects, in the months leading up to World War II, on the future of Western civilization bereft of Christian spirituality. The Idea of a Christian Society is a valuable aid to the understanding of some of the themes in Eliot’s last important poetic work, Four Quartets (1936–42).\n\nEliot introduces Notes Towards the Definition of Culture (1948) as an “essay” which he began in the closing stages of the war, after completing the Quartets. It is, as he says, a piece of “social criticism.” Again, it is the centrality of religion in the development and sustenance of culture which is his theme: “no culture has appeared or developed except together with a religion.” Although by this period in his life Eliot had attained the status of a sage, having acquired the Nobel Prize and been admitted to the Order of Merit (both in 1948), his conservative views in these essays did not achieve popular acceptance.\n\nThe influence of Eliot’s essays today, especially in what remains of the discipline of English Literature, is negligible. In the 21st century—like Arnold’s Essays and Johnson’s Lives now—they will probably be regarded only as historical curiosities. Yet, like the essays of those earlier masters, Eliot’s will remain exemplary for their style—erudite, stimulating, and, above all, readable. To paraphrase the closing observation of his essay on “John Dryden” (1921), Eliot is one of those who have set standards for English prose which it is desperate to ignore.\n\nBARRY SPURR\n\nBiography\n\nThomas Stearns Eliot.
