Eliot first attracted widespread attention for his poem \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" in 1915, which, at the time of its publication, was considered outlandish. It was followed by \"The Waste Land\" (1922), \"The Hollow Men\" (1925), \"Ash Wednesday\" (1930), and Four Quartets (1943). He was also known for seven plays, particularly Murder in the Cathedral (1935) and The Cocktail Party (1949). He was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry\".\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of literary criticism, and strongly influenced the school of New Criticism.\n\n#marshallsbookcafe  #tseliot \n#bookcafe #punebookcafes #booklover #bookwriting #bookstagram #bookcafelovers  #punewritersgroup #punebooklovers #punefoodblogger #punefoodie #punewritersassociation #punewriters #punefoodbloggers #punefoodlovers #punekar  #cafe #cafelover #indianwriters #trending  #bestselfhelpbook  #aundh #aundhbooklovers #artist #artistsoninstagram #motivationalquotes\".",
