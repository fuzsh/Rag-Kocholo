        "text": "T.S. Eliot Timeline\n\nHow It All Went Down\n\nSep 26, 1888\n\nT.S. Eliot Born\n\nThomas Stearns Eliot is born in St. Louis, Missouri, the sixth and last surviving child of Henry Ware Eliot and Charlotte Stearns Eliot.\n\n1898\n\nEnrolls in Smith Academy\n\nEliot begins school at Smith Academy, an all-boys preparatory school for Washington University in St. Louis. His grandfather, William Greenleaf Eliot, was founder and chancellor of Washington University.\n\n1905\n\nGraduates from Smith\n\nEliot graduates from Smith Academy, where he studied Latin, French, Greek, and German. Rather than head straight to college, Eliot first spends a preparatory year at Milton Academy, near Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n1906\n\nA Harvard Advocate\n\nEliot enrolls at Harvard University. Amid his rigorous studies (he finishes his undergraduate work in just three years and completes his master's work in a fourth), Eliot finds time to write poems for the Harvard Advocate.\n\n1910\n\nHarvard to Sorbonne\n\nEliot graduates from Harvard with bachelor's and master's degrees. He then travels to Paris to study at the Sorbonne for a year, and to see the continent.\n\n1911\n\nBack to Harvard\n\nEliot returns to Harvard and begins work on a doctorate in philosophy.\n\n1914\n\nMerton College, Oxford\n\nEliot receives a fellowship to study at Merton College, at Oxford University. While there, he meets another young poet and fellow student named Ezra Pound. The two become lifelong friends.\n\n1915\n\nPublishes, Marries, Teaches\n\nHis first major poem, \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\" is published in the journal Poetry. On June 26th, Eliot marries his first wife, a governess named Vivienne Haigh-Wood, in a quiet civil ceremony. He takes a teaching job at Highgate School. What a year!\n\n1916\n\nDissertation But No Conferral\n\nEliot submits his doctoral dissertation, \"Experience and Objects of Knowledge in the Philosophy of F.H. Bradley.\" But because he does not defend it in person, Harvard does not confer his doctorate.\n\n1917\n\nPrufrock and Other Observations\n\nT.S. Eliot's first collection of poetry, Prufrock and Other Observations, is published. Eliot starts work as a foreign account manager at Lloyds Bank in London, his employer for the next decade. He also becomes assistant editor of the literary journal Egoist.\n\n1919\n\nTradition Over Emotion\n\nEgoist publishes \"Tradition and the Individual Talent,\" an essay by Eliot. In it, he argues that a poet is obligated to serve poetic traditions rather than his personal emotions.\n\n1920\n\nThe Sacred Wood\n\nEliot publishes The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism, his seminal collection of literary criticism.\n\n1921\n\nNervous Breakdown\n\nEliot suffers a nervous breakdown and is forced to take a leave of absence from Lloyds.\n\n1922\n\nCriterion and The Waste Land\n\nEliot launches Criterion, a quarterly literary journal. In its seventeen years of existence—all with Eliot as editor—the journal becomes a respected and influential source of literature and criticism. Its first issue carries Eliot's poem The Waste Land, a 434-line epic about the alienation of post-World War I life. Criticized by the poetic establishment at first, the poem is now thought of as a modernist classic.\n\n1925\n\nMoves to Faber & Faber\n\nEliot publishes Poems 1909-1925, a collection that includes \"The Hollow Men\" (the famous poem that ends, \"This is the way the world ends/ Not with a bang, but a whimper\"). He leaves his job at Lloyds and goes to work as an editor for the publishing house Faber & Faber, a position that he holds until his retirement in the 1960s.\n\n1927\n\nBritish Subject\n\nEliot becomes a British subject and a member of the Anglican Church at age 39. He first moved to the United Kingdom, though, in 1914 at the age of 25.\n\n1930\n\n\"Ash Wednesday\"\n\n\"Ash Wednesday,\" a poem about Eliot's religious awakening, is published.\n\n1932\n\nA Year at Harvard\n\nEliot accepts a yearlong teaching position at Harvard, his alma mater. The professional opportunity also gives him a break from his failing marriage to Vivienne, who remains in England while Eliot travels to Massachusetts. Eliot is instantly a well-liked professor, frequently inviting students over for tea.\n\n1933\n\nSeparation from Vivienne\n\nEliot returns to England and officially separates from Vivienne. Not long after their separation, Vivienne is committed to a mental hospital north of London, where she remains for the rest of her life.\n\nJun 15, 1935\n\nMurder in the Cathedral\n\nEliot's play Murder in the Cathedral, a drama about the assassination of Archbishop Thomas Becket, premieres at Canterbury Cathedral.\n\n1936\n\nCollected Poems 1909-1935\n\nCollected Poems 1909-1935 appears. The collection contains \"Burnt Norton,\" a poem inspired by material that Eliot had to cut from Murder in the Cathedral. \"Burnt Norton\" and the later poems \"East Coker,\" \"The Dry Salvages,\" and \"Little Gidding\" eventually become known as the Four Quartets, a series of poems that echoes the four elements and the four seasons.\n\nSep 1, 1939\n\nWWII Begins\n\nGermany invades Poland, prompting Britain and other countries to declare war.\n\n1940\n\n\"East Coker,\" Night Watchman\n\nThe poem \"East Coker\" is published, named after the village from which Eliot's ancestors had immigrated to the United States. Meanwhile, the Germans begin bombing London, and Eliot serves as a night watchman at his office building to look out for German planes.\n\n1941\n\n\"The Dry Salvages\"\n\n\"The Dry Salvages,\" a poem written during the London air-raid drills, is published.\n\n1942\n\n\"Little Gidding\"\n\n\"Little Gidding,\" the fourth poem of the Four Quartets, is published.\n\n1946\n\nMoves in with John Davy Hayward\n\nEliot moves into an apartment with a friend, editor and critic John Davy Hayward. Hayward takes it upon himself to archive Eliot's papers and poems, amassing a huge collection of the poet's works.\n\n1947\n\nVivienne Dies\n\nVivienne Haigh-Wood, Eliot's first wife, dies at her mental hospital in Northumberland. Though the couple was still legally married at the time of her death, they had not seen each other for years, and Eliot never visited her at the hospital."
