        "text": "“The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,\n\nIt isn’t just one of your holiday games;\n\nYou may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter\n\nWhen I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.\n\nFirst of all, there’s the name that the family use daily,\n\nSuch as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James,\n\nSuch as Victor or Jonathan, or George or Bill Bailey –\n\nAll of them sensible everyday names.\n\nThere are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,\n\nSome for the gentlemen, some for the dames:\n\nSuch as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter –\n\nBut all of them sensible everyday names.\n\nBut I tell you, a cat needs a name that’s particular,\n\nA name that’s peculiar, and more dignified,\n\nElse how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,\n\nOr spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?\n\nOf names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,\n\nSuch as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,\n\nSuch as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum –\n\nNames that never belong to more than one cat.\n\nBut above and beyond there’s still one name left over,\n\nAnd that is the name that you never will guess;\n\nThe name that no human research can discover –\n\nBut THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.\n\nWhen you notice a cat in profound meditation,\n\nThe reason, I tell you, is always the same:\n\nHis mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation\n\nOf the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:\n\nHis ineffable effable\n\nEffanineffable\n\nDeep and inscrutable singular Name.”\n\nThe Ad-dressing of Cats\n\n“You’ve read of several kinds of Cat,\n\nAnd my opinion now is that\n\nYou should need no interpreter\n\nTo understand their character.\n\nYou now have learned enough to see\n\nThat Cats are much like you and me\n\nAnd other people whom we find\n\nPossessed of various types of mind.\n\nFor some are sane and some are mad\n\nAnd some are good and some are bad\n\nAnd some are better, some are worse –\n\nBut all may be described in verse.\n\nYou’ve seen them both at work and games,\n\nAnd learnt about their proper names,\n\nTheir habits and their habitat:\n\nBut\n\nHow would you ad-dress a Cat?\n\nSo first, your memory I’ll jog,\n\nAnd say: A CAT IS NOT A DOG.\n\nNow Dogs pretend they like to fight;\n\nThey often bark, more seldom bite;\n\nBut yet a Dog is, on the whole,\n\nWhat you would call a simple soul.\n\nOf course I’m not including Pekes,\n\nAnd such fantastic canine freaks.\n\nThe usual Dog about the Town\n\nIs much inclined to play the clown,\n\nAnd far from showing too much pride\n\nIs frequently undignified.\n\nHe’s very easily taken in –\n\nJust chuck him underneath the chin\n\nOr slap his back or shake his paw,\n\nAnd he will gambol and guffaw.\n\nHe’s such an easy-going lout,\n\nHe’ll answer any hail or shout.\n\nAgain I must remind you that\n\nA Dog’s a Dog – A CAT’S A CAT.\n\nWith Cats, some say, one rule is true:\n\nDon’t speak till you are spoken to.\n\nMyself, I do not hold with that –\n\nI say, you should ad-dress a Cat.\n\nBut always keep in mind that he\n\nResents familiarity.\n\nI bow, and taking off my hat,\n\nAd-dress him in this form: O CAT!\n\nBut if he is the Cat next door,\n\nWhom I have often met before\n\n(He comes to see me in my flat)\n\nI greet him with an OOPSA CAT!\n\nI’ve heard them call him James Buz-James –\n\nBut we’ve not got so far as names.\n\nBefore a Cat will condescend\n\nTo treat you as a trusted friend,\n\nSome little token of esteem\n\nIs needed, like a dish of cream;\n\nAnd you might now and then supply\n\nSome caviare, or Strassburg Pie,\n\nSome potted grouse, or salmon paste –\n\nHe’s sure to have his personal taste.\n\n(I know a Cat, who makes a habit\n\nOf eating nothing else but rabbit,\n\nAnd when he’s finished, licks his paws\n\nSo’s not to waste the onion sauce.)\n\nA Cat’s entitled to expect\n\nThese evidences of respect.\n\nAnd so in time you reach your aim,\n\nAnd finally call him by his NAME.”\n\n“Gus is the Cat at the Theatre Door.\n\nHis name, as I ought to have told you before,\n\nIs really Asparagus. That’s such a fuss\n\nTo pronounce, that we usually call him just Gus.\n\nHis coat’s very shabby, he’s thin as a rake,\n\nAnd he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake.\n\nYet he was, in his youth, quite the smartest of Cats –\n\nBut no longer a terror to mice or to rats.\n\nFor he isn’t the Cat that he was in his prime;\n\nThough his name was quite famous, he says, in his time.\n\nAnd whenever he joins his friends at their club\n\n(which takes place at the back of the neighbouring pub)\n\nHe loves to regale them, if someone else pays,\n\nWith anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days.\n\nFor he once was a Star of the highest degree –\n\nHe has acted with Irving, he’s acted with Tree.\n\nAnd he likes to relate his success on the Halls,\n\nWhere the Gallery once gave him seven cat-calls.\n\nBut his grandest creation, as he loves to tell,\n\nWas Firefrorefiddle, the Fiend of the Fell.”\n\nMacavity\n\n“He’s outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.)\n\nAnd his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard’s.\n\nAnd when the larder’s looted, or the jewel-case is rifled,\n\nOr when the milk is missing, or another Peke’s been stifled,\n\nOr the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair –\n\nAy, there’s the wonder of the thing! Macavity’s not there!\n\nAnd when the Foreign Office find a Treaty’s gone astray,\n\nOr the Admiralty lose some plans and drawings by the way,\n\nThere may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the stair –\n\nBut it’s useless to investigate – Mcavity’s not there!\n\nAnd when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say:\n\n‘It must have been Macavity!’ – but he’s a mile away.\n\nYou’ll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs,\n\nOr engaged in doing complicated long-division sums.\n\nMacavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,\n\nThere never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.\n\nHe always has an alibi, and one or two to spaer:\n\nAt whatever time the deed took place – MACAVITY WASN’T THERE!\n\nAnd they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known\n\n(I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone)\n\nAre nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the time\n\nJust controls their operations: the Napoleon of Crime!”\n\n“Old Deuteronomy‘s lived a long time;\n\nHe’s a Cat who has lived many lives in succession.\n\nHe was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme\n\nA long while before Queen Victoria’s accession.\n\nOld Deuteronomy’s buried nine wives\n\nAnd more – I am tempted to say, ninety-nine;\n\nAnd his numerous progeny prospers and thrives\n\nAnd the village is proud of him in his decline.\n\nAt the sight of that placid and bland physiognomy,\n\nWhen he sits in the sun on the vicarage wall,\n\nThe Oldest Inhabitant croaks: “Well, of all …\n\nThings … Can it be … really! … No! … Yes! …\n\nHo! hi!\n\nOh, my eye!\n\nMy mind may be wandering, but I confess\n\nI believe it is Old Deuteronomy!”\n\nOld Deuteronomy sits in the street,\n\nHe sits in the High Street on market day;\n\nThe bullocks may bellow, the sheep they may bleat,\n\nBut the dogs and the herdsman will turn them away.\n\nThe cars and the lorries run over the kerb,\n\nAnd the villagers put up a notice: ROAD CLOSED –\n\nSo that nothing untoward may chance to disturb\n\nDeuteronomy’s rest when he feels so disposed\n\nOr when he’s engaged in domestic economy:\n\nAnd the Oldest Inhabitant croaks: “Well of all …\n\nThings … Can it be … really! … No! … Yes! …\n\nHo! hi!\n\nOh, my eye!\n\nMy sight’s unreliable, but I can guess\n\nThat the cause of the trouble is Old Deuteronomy!”\n\n“The Rum Tum Tugger is a Curious Cat:\n\nIf you offer him pheasant he would rather have grouse.\n\nIf you put him in a house he would much prefer a flat,\n\nIf you put him in a flat then he’d rather have a house.\n\nIf you set him on a mouse then he only wants a rat,\n\nIf you set him on a rat then he’d rather chase a mouse.\n\nYes the Rum Tum Tugger is a Curious Cat –\n\nAnd there isn’t any call for me to shout it:\n\nFor he will do\n\nAs he do do\n\nAnd there’s no doing anything about it!\n\nMagical Mr. Mistoffelees\n\n“He is quiet and small, he is black\n\nFrom his ears to the tip of his tail;\n\nHe can creep through the tiniest crack\n\nHe can walk on the narrowest rail.\n\nHe can pick any card from a pack,\n\nHe is equally cunning with dice;\n\nHe is always deceiving you into believing\n\nThat he’s only hunting for mice.\n\nHe can play any trick with a cork\n\nOr a spoon and a bit of fish-paste;\n\nIf you look for a knife or a fork\n\nAnd you think it is merely misplaced –\n\nYou have seen it one moment, and then it is gawn!\n\nBut you’ll find it next week lying out on the lawn.\n\nAnd we all say: OH!\n\nWell I never!\n\nWas there ever\n\nA Cat so clever\n\nAs Magical Mr. Mistoffelees!\n\n“Bustopher Jones is not skin and bones –\n\nIn fact, he’s remarkably fat.\n\nHe doesn’t haunt pubs – he has eight or nine clubs,\n\nFor he’s the St. James’s Street Cat!\n\nHe’s the Cat we all greet as he walks down the street\n\nIn his coat of fastidious black:\n\nNo commonplace mousers have such well-cut trousers\n\nOr such an impeccable back.\n\nIn the whole of St. James’s the smartest of names is\n\nThe name of this Brummell of Cats;\n\nAnd we’re all of us proud to be nodded or bowed to\n\nBy Bustopher Jones in white spats!"
