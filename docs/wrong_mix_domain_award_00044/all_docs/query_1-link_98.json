        "text": "2019: Lee Gelernt '80\n\nLee Gelernt has been a lawyer at the ACLU's national office in New York since 1992. He currently holds the positions of Deputy Director of the national Immigrants’ Rights Project and Director of the Project’s national Access to the Courts Program. Mr. Gelernt has won numerous awards for his work and is widely recognized as one of the 500 leading lawyers in the nation in any field, a list that contains only a handful of public interest attorneys. He has argued dozens of groundbreaking civil rights cases at all levels of the federal court system, including in the United States Supreme Court, and has testified as an expert before both houses of Congress.\n\nDuring the past two years, Mr. Gelernt has argued some of the most high profile cases involving Trump Administration policies, including:\n\nThe first case challenging the president’s January 2017 travel ban on individuals from certain Muslim-majority nations, even those with valid visas, which resulted in a federal court in Brooklyn issuing a nationwide Saturday night injunction against the ban, one day after the president enacted it.\n\nA national class action involving the Trump Administration’s unprecedented practice of separating immigrant families at the border. In June 2018, a federal court in San Diego issued an injunction holding the practice unconstitutional and requiring the Administration to reunite the approximately 3,000 separated families, which included babies and toddlers.\n\nA challenge to the Administration’s second asylum ban (the transit ban). In August 2019, a San Francisco federal district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the ban. The Supreme Court has allowed the ban to go into effect temporarily pending the outcome of the merits of the case. Mr. Gelernt is lead counsel and will argue the Ninth Circuit merits appeal in December 2019.\n\nThe first challenge to the president’s first asylum ban. In December 2018, a San Francisco federal district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the ban, which barred asylum for anyone who did not enter at a port of entry. Both the Ninth Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court denied the government’s request for an emergency stay of the injunction, and the case is ongoing. Mr. Gelernt is lead counsel, and argued the case before both the district court and the Ninth Circuit.\n\nA case involving the fatal cross-border shooting of a Mexican teenager in Mexico by a U.S. border patrol officer firing from U.S. soil through the border fence in Nogales, Arizona, which Mr. Gelernt successfully argued in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court ruling in favor of the boy’s family was the first federal court decision to hold that the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against the use of excessive force by law enforcement applies extraterritorially. The case is now pending in the Supreme Court.\n\nA major case in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals filed on behalf of cities and counties challenging Texas’s anti-sanctuary SB4 immigration law. In that case, Texas and the Trump Administration have argued that the State has the right to compel cities and localities to assist the federal government in enforcing federal immigration law.\n\nCases in Detroit, Boston, Miami and Los Angeles concerning the authority of the federal courts to block the Administration’s attempt to remove large classes of long-term residents to Iraq, Indonesia, Somalia and Cambodia, most of whom face persecution and torture on account of their religion if they are deported.\n\nIn the aftermath of 9/11, Mr. Gelernt litigated several high profile national security cases and served as one of only a few human rights observers at Guantanamo Bay for the first military trial conducted by the United States since World War II. In March 2011, Mr. Gelernt argued the case of Ashcroft v. al-Kidd in the U.S. Supreme Court, which challenged the constitutionality of the government’s post-9/11 policy of using the federal material witness statute to investigate and preventively detain terrorism suspects in cases where there was no probable cause to justify a criminal arrest.\n\nHe also successfully argued one the first major 9/11 cases to reach the federal courts of appeals, Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft, where he represented the media in their lawsuit seeking to prevent the government from holding secret deportation hearings. In its decision invalidating the government’s secret hearing policy, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stated that “democracies die behind closed doors,” a phrase that became one of the most cited and well-known admonitions issued by the judiciary in the aftermath of 9/11.\n\nHe is a frequent guest speaker and has lectured at such varied places as West Point, the NAACP national convention, the American Bar Association national conference, and virtually every major law school in the country. He regularly appears in national and international print and television media. In addition to his work at the ACLU, Mr. Gelernt is an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School, and for several years taught at Yale Law School as an adjunct. He received his J.D. from Columbia Law School, where he was a notes and comments editor of the Columbia Law Review. After graduation, Mr. Gelernt served as a law clerk to the late Judge Frank M. Coffin of the First Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n2018: Lynn Novick '79\n\nEmmy and Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Lynn Novick '79 has been making documentary films about American history for nearly 30 years. A director and producer, she has been a principal collaborator of Ken Burns since the early 1990’s. Together they have been responsible for more than 60 hours of programming, some of the most critically acclaimed and top-rated documentary films and series that have aired on PBS.\n\nNovick came to Florentine Films in 1989 to work on Burns's landmark 1990 series The Civil War as associate producer for post-production. She previously served as researcher and associate producer for Bill Moyers on two PBS series: Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth and A World of Ideas with Bill Moyers.\n\nIn 1994, she produced the most-watched series in the history of public television, Burns's nine-part, 18-hour series Baseball (1994) for which she received an Emmy Award.\n\nIn 1998, Novick was director and producer (with Burns) of two-part biographical documentary Frank Lloyd Wright, for which she received a Peabody Award. The film was shown at the Sundance, Telluride, Edinburgh, and Seattle Film Festivals.\n\nIn 2001, Novick produced Burns's 10-part series Jazz, which explores in detail the culture, politics, and dreams that gave birth to jazz music and follows this most American of art forms from its origins in blues and ragtime through swing, bebop and fusion. Jazz was nominated for five Emmy Awards.\n\nIn 2007, she was director and producer (with Burns) of The War, an epic seven-part series that told the story of the Second World War through the personal accounts of nearly 40 men and women from four American towns. The series explored the most intimate human dimensions of the greatest cataclysm in history and demonstrated that in extraordinary times, there are no ordinary lives. The War received three Emmy Awards as well as the Television Critics Association award for best news and information program of 2007.\n\nIn 2010, Novick was director and producer (with Burns) and writer (with Burns and David McMahon) of The Tenth Inning, a four-hour update of the 1994 series Baseball, which brought the tumultuous story of our national pastime up to the present day.\n\nIn 2011, Novick directed and produced (with Burns) Prohibition, a three-part, five-and-a-half-hour series that was viewed by 22 million people in its premiere broadcast, and received three Emmy nominations. The film tells the story of the rise, reign, and fall of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution and all of its consequences, intended and otherwise. Prohibition raises vital questions that are as relevant today as they were 100 years ago -- about means and ends, individual rights and responsibilities, the proper role of government, and who is -- and who is not -- a real American.\n\nThe fall of 2017 marked the release of The Vietnam War, a 10-part, 18-hour epic directed and produced by Novick (with Burns) that aired on PBS. The immersive series chronicled the war and featured the soldiers, protesters, politicians, and families who lived it.\n\nNovick’s newest project, tentatively titled College Behind Bars, is slated for release in 2019. The project is a four-part documentary series about the men and women who participate in the Bard Prison Initiative, a rigorous program for incarcerated people in New York to earn a college education.[i] She is also working with Ken Burns on Ernest Hemingway, a two-part biography of the writer slated for completion in 2020, and a multi-part series on Lyndon Johnson.\n\nIn total, she has won or been nominated for more than 12 Emmy Awards, and her work has been viewed by a Nielsen-estimated more than 1 billion aggregate viewers.\n\nShe is a magna cum laude graduate of Yale with honors in American Studies, and lives in New York City.\n\n[i] Topper, Jenn. “Reporters Committee Honors Lynn Novick with 2018 Freedom of the Press Award.” https://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news/reporters-committee-honors-lynn-novick-2018-freedom-press-award\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n2017: Renee Richards '51\n\nBorn in 1934 as Richard Raskind, Dr. Renée Richards grew up in New York City as the son of Jewish immigrants. His father was an orthopedic surgeon and his mother was a psychiatrist who practiced out of their home in Forest Hills, Queens. Raskind attended Horace Mann School and was a top-notch student who excelled on the football, baseball, tennis, and swim teams. His baseball skills even led to an invitation to join the New York Yankees, but he opted to focus on tennis.[1] After graduating from Horace Mann in 1951, Raskind went to Yale and then the University of Rochester Medical Center, where he specialized in ophthalmology. He earned his medical degree in 1959. After completing an internship at Lenox Hill Hospital, he helped to train hundreds of students as a resident at Manhattan Eye, Ear, and Throat Hospital and as a post-graduate fellowship at the Eye Muscle Clinic. He then joined the U.S. Navy as a lieutenant to further his medical training.\n\nBy 1973, as Raskind was becoming a prominent ophthalmologist, he reached a No. 6 ranking in the men’s 35-and-over bracket. Despite his success, his life was overshadowed by an agonizing struggle with gender dysphoria: he felt that his true self was a woman, trapped in the body of a man. After attempting hormone therapy, he fell in love, married, and became a father. With the exception of the time spent with his son, he was deeply unhappy. In 1975 at the age of 41, to relieve his suffering and fully embrace his female alter ego, Raskind underwent sex reassignment surgery, becoming Renée Richards.\n\nAfter the surgery, Richards resumed playing tennis professionally. In 1976, she applied to play in the U.S. Open and was denied. She sued the United States Tennis Association (USTA) and won, receiving injunctive relief against a policy requiring players to undergo a Barr body chromosome test. She argued that the test requirement was discriminatory, violated the New York State Human Rights Law and the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and was an arbitrary and capricious method to prove one’s sex.[1] As the first to address the legal rights of transsexuals, the case still resonates today.\n\nRichards’ victory against the USTA – and the eventual acceptance and respect she received after playing on the women’s professional tennis tour for five years – gave hope to countless sexually disenfranchised and transgender people who were fighting for equality. Her human rights achievements were recognized by Senior Advocacy for Gay and Lesbian Elders (SAGE), which honored her with its Lifetime Achievement Award, and with the Athlete Ally Action Award from Athlete Ally, which combats transphobia and homophobia in sports.\n\nIn sports, Richards’ accomplishments include captain of the Yale and U.S. Navy tennis teams, two-time All-Navy Champion, and U.S. tennis team captain in the 1973 Maccabiah Games. She was a U.S. Open doubles finalist in 1977 and won the 35-and-over singles title in 1979. At the height of her tennis career, Dr. Richards ranked 19th in the nation. She played professionally until 1981, then coached Martina Navratilova to singles titles in all four Grand Slam Championships. In 2000, the USTA inducted her into its Hall of Fame. Although she is known for her success as a player, what she is most proud of is her career as a coach and teacher -- not just of Navratilova – but of junior players for decades.\n\nIn 1982, Richards left professional tennis to return to the practice of ophthalmology. She re-established her medical practice, and since then – in a career spanning 55+ years -- has taught generations of residents in ophthalmology. In 2001, she was the honoree of Helen Keller Services for the Blind for her achievements in ophthalmology, as one of the most respected ophthalmic surgeons in the country. She is the Head of the Strabismus Department and Surgeon Director at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, and holds the position of Professor of Ophthalmology at NYU Medical School.\n\nRichards is the author of one medical textbook, many medical journal articles, two autobiographies, and one collection of personal stories. She still sees patients and performs surgery in both New York City and in Carmel, NY, close by her son and her loyal friends.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n2016: Todd Haimes '74\n\nSince 1983, Todd Haimes ’74 has transformed Roundabout Theatre Company from a small off-Broadway theatre into one of the leading cultural institutions in New York City. Mr. Haimes has been Artistic Director/CEO of the Roundabout Theatre Company since July 1, 1990. From 1983 to 1990, Mr. Haimes served as the theatre’s Executive Director, overseeing the company’s finances, marketing, and fundraising. During the extraordinary years that followed, he also oversaw the biggest period of growth in the company’s history. Today, Roundabout is the largest not-for-profit theatre in the country, producing award-winning revivals, musicals, and new works on five stages both on and off Broadway.\n\nUnder Haimes’ leadership, Roundabout opened the doors of its first Broadway home at the Criterion Center with Harold Pinter's The Homecoming in October 1991. By 1993, Roundabout was enjoying tremendous artistic success with critically acclaimed productions, including Friedrich Durrenmatt's The Visit and Eugene O'Neill's Anna Christie, gracing the Roundabout stage.\n\nIn 1994, Haimes jumped at the chance to transform the cabaret space next to its mainstage into an intimate off-Broadway theatre. With the extraordinary support of Laura Pels and Cory and Bob Donnalley, the 399-seat Laura Pels Theatre opened in 1995 with the American premiere of Harold Pinter's Moonlight, the first production in Roundabout’s newly established New Play Initiative.\n\nWhen Roundabout was evicted from the Criterion Center in 1999, Haimes led the search for the company’s new Broadway and Off-Broadway homes. Roundabout embarked on a $24 million capital campaign to renovate Broadway’s Selwyn Theatre into the renamed and restored American Airlines Theatre, which opened in 2000. In 2002, Haimes signed a long-term lease on the former American Place Theatre, the future home of the Harold & Miriam Steinberg Center for Theatre and the Laura Pels Theatre. After an extensive renovation, the Pels opened with Lynne Nottage’s Intimate Apparel in 2004. In 2007, Roundabout completed a new Black Box Theatre for readings, workshops, and the acclaimed Roundabout Underground program, which opened with Stephen Karam’s Speech & Debate.\n\nIn 2003, Roundabout purchased Studio 54, the unique theatre then featuring their award-winning, long-running production of Cabaret. In 2009, Roundabout opened the newly restored and LEED certified Henry Miller’s Theatre, renamed The Stephen Sondheim Theatre in 2010.\n\nIn addition to settling Roundabout into five permanent homes, Haimes has continued its acclaimed artistic legacy. Since 1990, under Haimes’ artistic leadership, Roundabout has been nominated for 36 Tony Awards, 50 Drama Desk Awards, 59 Outer Critics’ Circle Awards, and 11 Obie Awards.\n\nMr. Haimes has a Bachelor’s Degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from the Yale School of Organization and Management.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n2015: Milton A. Tingling '71\n\nThe Honorable Milton A. Tingling was born in New York City and grew up in Harlem and Washington Heights. He is a second generation judge and attorney, and is part of three generations of family lawyers.\n\nHis father, Milton F. Tingling, was an attorney with a private general law practice on 125th Street in Manhattan, and was elected to the New York City Civil Court in 1982. His mother, Eunice Tingling, received a Master of Arts in Teaching degree from Columbia University in 1950 and was a New York City public school teacher at PS 125 and PS 36. The Tinglings’ family life centered around education, community activity, and church.\n\nJustice Tingling attended public school in Harlem in the 1960's, first to PS 192 from kindergarten through third grade, and then to a gifted program at PS 129. He attended high school at Horace Mann School and was a member of the Class of 1971. Justice Tingling then matriculated at Brown University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in American History. He later received his Juris Doctorate, cum laude, from the North Carolina Central University School of Law in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nJustice Tingling was admitted to practice before the New York State Courts, First Department, in 1983. He was elected to the Civil Court, City of New York, in 1996 from the 7th Municipal District, which includes Columbia University, West Harlem, and Washington Heights, and was assigned and served in both the criminal and civil courts. In November 2000, he was elected to the Supreme Court, State of New York, from New York County.\n\nHe received national media attention for his decisions that banned a statewide policy of shackling youths during transfer from juvenile facilities to family court, and his decision that found Mayor Bloomberg's so-called \"soda ban\" unconstitutional.\n\nOn November 4, 2014, Justice Tingling was re-elected to a second 14-year term as Justice of the Supreme Court. On January 1, 2015, he accepted an appointment to become the County Clerk of New York County, Commissioner of Jurors and Clerk of Supreme Court, Civil and Criminal Divisions. By accepting this appointment, Justice Tingling became the first black County Clerk in the history of New York State.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n2014: Robert Carneiro '45\n\nDr. Robert Carneiro ’45 has been called “one of the most important social evolutionists of the present.” Since 1957, he has been a curator of South American Ethnology at the American Museum of Natural History, where he was a colleague of world-renowned anthropologist Margaret Mead.\n\nLong established as an authority on lowland groups in South America, his ethnographic field research has focused on the culture of contemporary Indian tribes in Amazonia, including the Kuikuru of central Brazil, the Amahuaca of eastern Peru, and the Yanomamö of southern Venezuela. His work there and his study of chiefdoms of highland Colombia led to influential articles on the role of warfare in the evolution of chiefdoms and states. His theoretical interests are in cultural evolution in general, and in political evolution in particular.\n\nAlthough his list of academic publications is extensive, including the highly acclaimed books Evolutionism in Cultural Anthropology: A Critical History (Westview Press, 2003) and The Muse of History and the Science of Culture (Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 2000), Carneiro is most identified with a classic article that changed the way anthropologists look at human society. In “A Theory of the Origin of the State” (1970), he proposed what has been called “The Circumscription Theory,” which challenged prevailing theories of political evolution.\n\nHis “Circumscription Theory” opened up a dialogue on political evolution that has had far-ranging effects, most notably the reintroduction of state formation as a significant concern for cultural anthropologists and archaeologists. As Carneiro stated, “the circumscription theory…explains why states arose where they did, and why they failed to arise elsewhere. It shows the state to be a predictable response to certain specific cultural, demographic, and ecological conditions. Thus, it helps to elucidate what was undoubtedly the most important single step ever taken in the political evolution of mankind.”\n\nCarneiro is listed in Who’s Who in Science and Engineering, Who’s Who in the East, and Who’s Who in the World, and he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1999. In 2012, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Currently an adjunct professor of anthropology at Columbia University and Professor Emeritus at the Richard Gilder Graduate School, he has also taught at the University of Wisconsin, the University of California at Los Angeles, Pennsylvania State University, Fordham University, Hunter College and the University of Victoria in British Columbia. Dr. Carneiro, who was born in New York City, earned his Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in anthropology, as well as a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science, from the University of Michigan. He and his wife, Barbara, live in Manhattan and have a son, Brett.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n2013 : Jonathan Rubinstein '74\n\nJon Rubinstein, a.k.a. “The Podfather,” is among the tech industry’s most accomplished and well-respected leaders. Over the course of his 30-year career, Jon has made multiple contributions to the conception and creation of some of the world’s most iconic products, including the iMac and iPod lines, and countless other Apple innovations.\n\nDuring his nine-year tenure at Apple, first as senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, then as senior vice president of the iPod division, Jon’s product vision and leadership helped fuel one of the most dramatic company turnarounds in history. At Apple, Jon overhauled its engineering teams, product roadmaps and manufacturing processes, and led the rapid development of Apple’s first iMac. The first iPod was conceived and then launched within a year under Jon’s watch. In addition to spearheading the roadmap for every iPod and Mac hardware line until his departure, he built the vast iPod ecosystem that has since become a multi-billion dollar industry.\n\nJon then joined Palm, first as Executive Chairman and then as CEO, leading the beleaguered company out of a multi-year slump. The introduction of Palm’s webOS software, with its forward-looking cloud synchronization and multi-tasking software, shocked Palm doubters and is still considered industry leading today.\n\nUpon Palm’s acquisition by Hewlett-Packard in 2009, Jon served as senior vice president and general manager of the Palm Global Business Unit, then as senior vice president of Product Innovation, and presided over the development and launch of HP’s TouchPad tablet.\n\nPrior to Apple, Jon held leadership positions in Stardent Computer and NeXT, which was founded by Steve Jobs and later acquired by Apple. Jon also founded and sold his own company, Firepower Systems.\n\nJon now advises tech startups, serves on the boards of Amazon and Qualcomm, is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a senior member of the IEEE. A 1974 graduate of Horace Mann School, Jon earned bachelors and masters degrees in Electrical Engineering from Cornell University, and a masters degree in Computer Science from Colorado State University.

Since 1985, he has led 16 expeditions, attempted five different routes from the Tibetan and Nepalese sides of the mountain and on seven occasions has attained the summit, more than any other climber of non-Sherpa ethnicity.\n\nEverest looms from Peter's resume, but his accomplishments on other peaks are equally impressive. Over a twenty-year period, Peter has been active on each continent, climbing, guiding and exploring. He has led expeditions to Lhotse, Nuptse, Makalu, Manaslu, K2 and has succeeded in forging a new line up the rarely climbed south face and ridge of Annapurna's South Peak. Peter’s rapid ascents of Cho Oyu, Ama Dablam and Pumori have been remarkable in their lightweight efficiency and speed.\n\nIn December of 1997, Peter was granted the David A. Sowles award for his dramatic rescue efforts high on Everest in 1996, assisting two frostbitten and exhausted climbers from Everest's south col. The Sowles medal is the highest award conferred by the American Alpine Club, given rarely and only to climbers who have distinguished themselves through assuming great personal risk, sacrificing their own objectives and going to the assistance of those in need. In 2005, he was awarded The Explorers Club Tenzing Norgay Award.\n\nDuring his frequent visits to Nepal, Peter has taken a particular interest in the Sherpa people, an indigenous population of western Tibetan descent who reside in the southern foothills of Everest.

Rugh '54\n\nThe Horace Mann Alumni Association presented the 2002 Award for Distinguished Achievement to former Ambassadors Donald M. Blinken ’43 and William A. Rugh ’54 at a dinner on September 25, 2002.\n\nThe two ambassadors were recognized for their years of outstanding service in government, as well as their continuing service in international organizations. The award evening, held at ‘21’ in New York City, offered those gathered to hear the Ambassadors address the critical questions of today’s international affairs, including the debate over Iraq and the Middle East conflict. Gideon Rose ’81, managing director of Foreign Affairs, moderated the discussion and question and answer period.\n\nIntroducing the two distinguished awardees, Alumni Association President Allison Baron ’89 described their careers.

Though much has changed, the pursuit of excellence continues, and students continue to pursue roles in public service.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n2001: Barry C. Scheck '67\n\nDistinguished Alumni Award recipient for 2001 and a member of the Class of 1967, Barry Scheck is Professor of Law, Director of Clinical Legal Education and Co-Director of the Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University in New York City.\n\nProfessor Scheck always has been a vigorous advocate. As an undergraduate at Yale, he was a vociferous protestor against the Vietnam War; after graduation from the University of California Boalt Hall School of Law at Berkeley, he spent five years working for The Legal Aid Society in the Bronx. Barry Scheck today is one of the most celebrated defense attorneys in the country. Many of his clients have had high profiles, and he has employed his knowledge of technologically sophisticated proof to defend them, along with a theatrical and dramatic style befitting a lawyer who also writes screenplays. But many of Professor Scheck’s clients have been unknown individuals, condemned to prison or death for crimes they did not commit. As the co-founder of the Innocence Project, a unique pro bono effort, and the co-author of Actual Innocence, he has led the effort to exonerate wrongly convicted inmates in states across the nation using DNA evidence. These efforts have had a major impact on the legal process and have helped trigger a national re-examination of safeguards surrounding the death penalty which is continuing to be the subject of debate and discussion in the courts, the Congress, state legislatures and executive branches.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n2000: Alfred Bloom III, Ph.D. '63, Anthony Hecht '40, and Robert S. Ledley, DDS '43\n\nA leader in national and international education for the past 25 years, Dr. Bloom has held positions of leadership at a number of prestigious colleges and universities, including the president of Swarthmore College for the past nine years.

In 1990, he was inducted into the National Inventor's Hall of Fame, and in 1997 he was honored with the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest honor for technological achievement. The award was presented to him by the president of the United States.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1998-1999: Hans J. Bär '45\n\nWhen Hans J. Bär first came to Horace Mann School in 1941, he and his mother, the second and third generations of a family that owned the only significant Zurich bank founded by Jews, were fleeing the threat of a Nazi invasion of their native country. He returned to the school on March 15, 1999 to accept the 1998-1999 Alumni Association Award for Distinguished Achievement after an outstanding career for which he is globally recognized in the banking and finance communities. On this side of the Atlantic he may be most recognized for his role in bringing about an investigation and ultimate settlement of Holocaust claims against Swiss banks. Mr. Bär helped draft the 1996 agreement between the Swiss Bankers Association and the World Jewish Congress, which established a commission to oversee an audit of Holocaust-related accounts at Swiss banks. Many credit him with leading the Swiss banking community to deal with this issue. As Israel Singer, director-general of the World Jewish Congress, said, \"I was doing the heating up, and he was doing the resolving.\" In addition to his work as a member of the Volcker Commission, more formally known as the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), which is overseeing the audit, Mr. Bär holds the title of Honorary Chairman of Bank Julius Bär Holding.\n\nBank Julius Bär Holding is regarded as one of the most prestigious of the private Swiss banks. It spans the globe, with offices in London, Geneva, Hong Kong, Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna, Munich, Montreal, and Los Angeles. It has a federally chartered branch in New York, which was the first foreign bank branch to be granted fiduciary powers by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, allowing it to perform both banking and securities-related functions. During a special reception and dinner, Mr. Bär received the Award for Distinguished Achievement after several remarks and recollections by classmates, Robert Carneiro '45 and Bruce Dohrenwend '45, as well as Pulitzer Prize winner and former recipient of the Award for Distinguished Achievement in 1964, Anthony Lewis '44. David Jacoby '72, vice president of the Alumni Council, made remarks to a crowd of over 120 guests including three other past Award for Distinguished Achievement recipients: Arthur H. Aufses, Jr. '42, Alvin M. Josephy, Jr. '32, and S. William (Bill) Green '46. \"I read many words that various writers have used to try to describe Hans Bär: statesmanlike, diplomatic, influential, driving force. But I think the single characteristic which perhaps most distinguishes Hans Bär is what John Tagliabue of The New York Times described as his ability in the last few years to put a human face on the response to a tragic period in modern history,\" said Mr. Jacoby.\n\nAfter receiving the award, Mr. Bär said, \"It's a great honor to receive the Award for Distinguished Achievement, especially as the first foreign recipient. Thank you for the honor to come back after many years.\" He went on to discuss recent difficulties in dealings between the United States and Switzerland and ended with an appeal for fair and good citizenship on the part of all world citizens.\n\nMr. Bär's visit to Horace Mann comes after a twenty year absence. \"It feels great to be back at Horace Mann,\" said Mr. Bär during a short interview at the Alumni House and Development Office. \"I knew very little English when I came to Horace Mann. For me, the years here were my formative ones. I learned everything here — I played the cello in the orchestra, played tennis, and swam for the swim team, which I continued in college.\" One of his most memorable teachers was Mr. William Nagle, who taught Latin. \"We had to buy green neck ties from him because he was Irish. He was awe-inspiring and tough. The other great personality, of course, was Mr. Tillinghast. Why he let me in to Horace Mann, I do not know. As I mentioned, I knew very little English at the time,\" recounts Mr. Bär.\n\nAfter graduating from Horace Mann, Mr. Bär received a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Lehigh University, a Master of Arts in Economics from New York University, and Visiting Fellowships at Oxford University and at Harvard Center for International Affairs. In 1951, he wrote a book on the banking system of Switzerland (Schulthess Polygraphischer Verlag AG, Zurich) that went through five editions. In 1997, Lehigh University conferred upon him an honorary Doctor of Laws. Over the years, Mr. Bär has held numerous leadership positions in banking industry associations as well as in Swiss-American organizations.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1997: Robert B. Shapiro '56\n\nRobert B. Shapiro, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Monsanto Company, received the 1997 Distinguished Alumnus Award.\n\nIn an illustrious career, Shapiro rose to the top ranks of American business leaders, putting aside plans when he was at Horace Mann to become a writer. \"As it turned out that would not have been a very good idea,\" he told a group of alumni and friends at the award ceremony last November. \"It turned out that while I liked the idea of being a writer, I didn't much like writing. In addition, I had absolutely nothing to say other than that all the people whom I resented and was angry at were just terrible. To have written that probably would have limited interest to anyone else.\" Instead, he went on to law school and several prestigious positions in business before joining Monsanto in 1990.\n\nAt the ceremony, Alumni Council President Suzanne Sloan '77 and Head of School Dr. Eileen Mullady extended greetings to the guests. Classmate Michael Katz introduced Shapiro. \"Together we span the Class of '56, \" Katz said. \"Bob was graduated at the top of the class; I, close to the bottom.\n\n\"I have only one class memory of him,\" Katz continued. \"Bob was asked to present a paper to our class on the romantic poets. He dissected each poet carefully, left not one out, talked about a few that none of us had ever heard of, probably made up a few, quoted poems at length, recited several, and finally sat down. Most of the class had fallen asleep or were peering at some interesting cracks in the ceiling...Mr. Baruth, however, was perfectly attentive and seemed quite interested. Mr. Baruth told Bob that his work was encyclopedic, exhaustive and totally comprehensive, but, Mr. Baruth said, 'Bob, you forgot one thing...' Baruth paused a beat, and the growled, 'Brevity!'\"\n\nKatz went on to describe Shapiro's considerable accomplishments which, at Monsanto, include the establishment of an exciting goal: \"to reach a zero state of negative impact on the environment. If only all chief executives had this foresight.\" Shapiro was an executive at Searle and then NutraSweet, now both subsidiaries of Monsanto, from 1979 until 1990. During his career, he was also vice president and general counsel for General Instrument Corporation, a professor of law and an attorney. He served the government as a special assistant to the general counsel and to the undersecretary of the Department of Transportation. He has been a consultant to state and local governments, and is a member of the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations and the Trade and Environment Policy Advisory Committee.\n\nFollowing are excerpts from Shapiro's remarks:\n\n\"One of the pleasures of an occasion such as this is to juxtapose the self that I was and the expectations that I had so long ago with what life has in fact turned out to be like. The two have very little in common. When I hear Mike Katz describe his impression of me when I was in school with him, I suspect that the inside experience and the appearance are really quite different, and it wouldn't be fully honest or appropriate for me not to note that the years of my adolescence, as is the case with many other people, were very difficult and very painful...I must say Horace Mann during those years supported me and allowed me to experience all the issues of adolescence without too much danger, keeping me within reasonable limits and giving me the chance to grow from there.\n\n\"One of the great sins, I think, and one which I have been uniformly guilty of, is failure to thank one's teachers. There are so many people who made a huge difference in my life. I want to mention two tonight. One was Walter Metcalf and the other was Willard Hurst. Metcalf tried to teach me Latin, and Hurst tried to teach me physics and chemistry. What they had in common was that neither of those subjects came very easily to me; I had to struggle with them. [Metcalf and Hurst] were extremely patient with me, kind, considerate and absolutely merciless in their insistence that I was going to do this. There were times when I really doubted that I could. And so what I learned from them was less of Latin and physics or chemistry than it was that in fact I could do, more or less, things that didn't come easily to me. And that, I think, was probably more valuable than the subjects they were teaching.\n\n\"...But the real discovery of my life and one which I never would have anticipated was the discovery of business. If anyone had asked me while I was at Horace Mann what I thought of business and businessmen I would have reacted fairly contemptuously. Babbitt was, I guess, kind of the model of that. It turned out that when I finally got a job in the business world, I discovered I loved it. I absolutely loved it. It turned out to be the thing I was meant to do. I first loved it for incomplete reasons, if not the wrong reasons: because it was the best game I had seen, and called for the exercise of more muscles than I had previously been called on to use. It was only over the years that I realized that the real value of this is not in the game; business is a fundamental human activity that affects the lives of an awful lot of people. And done well, it can affect those lives in a very positive way.\"\n\nOn a personal note, Shapiro spoke of his family: \"I have two older kids, both of whom are rock musicians - which is what happens when you send a son to Yale to study English and a daughter to Tufts to study art history...Late in life I've begun another family. I have now a two-year-old son, and another baby on the way in April, which tends to make me very conscious of these issues of work and family. In all of this I feel incredibly lucky, and very grateful to all those people and institutions that helped me get though some of the hard times and emerge more or less intact...I want to conclude by thanking my friends, my classmates, and my teachers at Horace Mann.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1996: Alvin M. Josephy '32\n\nMr. Josephy was introduced by faculty member Barry Bienstock, who holds the Daniel Rose Chair in History and who is, like the honoree, an avid student of American History. Following are Mr. Bienstock's remarks which sum up admirably the measure of this extraordinary man.\n\n\"It's not often that one is given the opportunity to offer words of praise for someone who has meant a great deal to him. As we convene here I am reminded that all across the country thousands of anxious high school seniors and maybe even one or two Horace Mann seniors are busy trying to finish up their early acceptance applications to college. Probably, one of the essays asked them to write about an individual, or event, that made a significant impact on their lives. I am standing before you tonight as an American history teacher and a historian of the American Indian because of Alvin Josephy.\n\n\"Nearly thirty years ago, Mr. Josephy published The Indian Heritage of America, easily the most authoritative survey of the Indians of the Americas. What was an interest in American Indian culture and history for me now became a passion. I moved on to Mr. Josephy's The Patriot Chiefs and the Nez Perce Indians and the Opening of the Northwest. Here were books that blended with deep sensitivity the worlds of academic scholarship and popular narrative and that made me realize what possibilities there were in the writing and teaching of American Indian history.\n\n\"And that, of course, is Alvin Josephy's gift. For more than fifty years through numerous magazine articles and more than a dozen books he has managed to join the past to the present in ways that delight, sadden, enrage, excite, and always instruct. He is, as David McCullough has said, 'one of our very best historians.'\n\n\"Whatever lessons Mr. Josephy learned about writing surely began at Horace Mann. This literary gift was continued at Harvard College and honed by years at the New York Herald Tribune, Time magazine, and American Heritage. Perhaps little appreciated now, but of great significance was his service during World War II. Serving with the Marine Corps as a combat correspondent in the Pacific theater and earning a Bronze Star, Mr. Josephy considers Iwo Jima 'one of the most important, if not the most important, experience' in his life.\n\n\"Mr. Josephy is a craftsman; in a very old and honored tradition, his prose has brought the world of Native Americans, the American West, and the American political tradition to countless readers. His scholarship has been praised for its originality and what is most remarkable about his writing and his historical interest is that he remains on the cutting edge of historical inquiry. He wrote with great sensitivity about Indians years before a new generation of historians followed his lead. He wrote what may be considered 'new' western history before Patricia Limerick made the term fashionable. There is hardly a television documentary that doesn't feature Mr. Josephy as historical consultant. Kevin Costner's '500 Nations', TBS's 'The Native-Americans', and Ken Burns's 'The West' all relied upon his sage counsel. Four years ago, as the nation celebrated the Columbus Quincentenary, Mr. Josephy, in consultation with the Newberry Library's D'Arcy McNickle Center for the History of the American Indian, edited America in 1492: The World of the Indian Peoples Before the Arrival of Columbus. In a year that saw hundreds of books published on that topic, his book was often cited as the one indispensable publication.\n\n\"Mr. Josephy's efforts to create what Wallace Stegner called a plausible past for generations of Americans have been tireless. He is the founding Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian. In his presidential address to the Western History Association, he summed up what the historian contributes to the American experience: 'The historian can join with the poet and the novelist in inspiring among the Westerners of today and tomorrow a feeling of this wondrous region of the United States and for their place within it so strong as to border on the scared.'...Alvin Josephy is a historian and a poet of the West and its people, an artist who, like Remington or Russell, has painted huge canvases that generations of Americans will go to learn about their past and their present.\n\n\"Let me conclude with Mr. Josephy's own words, comments he made ten years ago about his Iwo Jima experience: 'I recognized at Iwo, even more than at Guam, how abruptly and completely a life can be extinguished, taking with it all the hopes, promises and possibilities of that life. Because I was spared, I have regarded every year given me since Iwo as a bonus. But with gratitude, I look on the bonus as one that carries with it obligations to those who did not make it off the island: to try never consciously to hurt anyone else; to respect and help anyone who needs assistance; and to contribute what little I can to help make the world a better place before I, too, depart.'\"\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1995: Hon. Giles S. Rich '22\n\nThe Harmonie Club of New York was the setting for a reception attended by over 120 Horace Mann graduates in honor of Judge Giles Sutherland Rich. He received the Alumni Association's award in recognition of his achievements as an outstanding jurist and of his work as \"Founding Father\" of modern US Patent law. At age 92, he is the oldest sitting judge in the United States.\n\nA graduate of Harvard and Columbia Law School, he began his practice in 1929. During his career, he served as lecturer on patent law at Columbia and at Georgetown University Law Center. He was nominated to the US Court of Customs and Patent Appeals by President Eisenhower in 1956. In 1982 he became Judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal circuit. He is the author of numerous articles on patent law, and is a member of the American Bar Association the Association of the Bar of the City of New York and the American Patent Law Association.\n\nThe following is an abridged text of his remarks on the evening of the presentation:\n\n\"As you can all understand, it has taken me quite some time to attain my allegedly distinguished achievement status and I stand before you at a considerably advanced age. Therefore, you can hardly expect anything from me other than reminiscences.\n\n\"However, le me orient you a little further on how far back I go.\n\n\"When I came to New York and Horace Mann to start my second year of what in my home town was know as High School, I had just finished my freshman year during the course of which, on the 11th hour of the 11th month, the very first of what used to be called Armistice Day had occurred, ending World War I, the War to end Wars...since then there have been some additional wars to produce more veterans with a need to celebrate and take a holiday and close the government so they could go shopping on the 10th day of the 11th month.\n\n\"One other bit of orientation: on picking up the morning paper just one week ago...I was shocked to read of the assassination of yet another man of peace, Yitzhak Rabin...what caught my eye was 1922, the year of Rabin's birth and the year I graduated from Horace Mann, plus the statement that Rabin was 73 years old. That should orient you fairly well with respect of my class, from which you don't hear much in the alumni news anymore.\n\n\"The world was then a very different place. Radio was about to emerge. No TV of course. The source of home music and entertainment was the Victrola and some people I knew even had Edison phonographs with 1/4 inch thick records. To those we boys and girls of Horace Mann sometimes danced in each other's homes. But the boys and girls were then in different schools. The Parent-Teachers Association got us together for occasional dances with, for me, the distinct advantage of finding my first wife of 22 years. But not right away. Not until I got out of law school.\n\n\"As a newcomer to New York, my family had no friends here and my partner at school dances was my younger sister who went to the Girls' School. One fine day I drove my sister down to Barnard College during my first year at Columbia Law School and as we passed one of the classroom buildings I saw this attractive girl and said to my sister, \"That girl looks familiar. Who is she?\" My sister said, \"Oh, you know her! That's Gertrude Braun. You met her at the Horace Mann dance.\" One way or another I got to meet her again, after which meetings became more frequent. I met with the approval of her family and, after we both had jobs and though we could swing it, we got married in the second year of the greatest depression this country has ever know. Gertrude eventually became a professor in the Barnard philosophy department and , in effect, I had the status of faculty wife.\n\n\"We had many Horace Mann friends...I would like to mention one of them in particular because it is a small part of HM history which I think has become mostly forgotten.\n\n\"Gertrude's closest friend was a girl named Pauline Pierce. She was a direct descendent of the 14th President of the United States, Franklin Pierce (Lincoln was the 16th in case you don't remember Pierce). She married a man named John Mulholland. Let me read you what the 12950 Columbia Encyclopedia says about him: Born in 1898. American magician. While still a schoolboy, he established a reputation for his skill in magical tricks, and he came to be one of the most celebrated of stage performers of magic. He also wrote with simplicity and charm on the subject and on spiritualism.\n\n\"That's who he was. But what you are not told is that back in the early 20's when I was at HM, John Mulholland was the manual training teacher...In other words, we had our resident magician and he delighted in practicing his skill at the school. He was always collecting little crowds in the locker room and pretending to pick ping-pong balls out of some boy's mouth. He had marvelous large hands and was the ambidextrous prestidigitator par excellence, sometimes letting us in on some of the magician's secrets, or possibly pretending to while tricking us further. John was a frequent performer at school assemblies, one of his favorite displays of manual dexterity being to tear the pages of an entire Manhattan telephone book in two.\n\n\"I mention one other friend of Gertrude's who went to Horace Mann, just to emphasize a big change since 1922. She was Helen Robinson, the first woman to be admitted to Columbia Law School. The number of women in that school is now around 50 percent.\n\n\"In looking at a list of these to whom you have given this award, I noticed that in 1954 the awardee was my friend Kenneth Bainbridge of the class of 1921, an M.I.T. Professor, which reminded me of a couple of things. The first was a little adventure we had together and the second was why I did not go to M.I.T. I'll tell you about the latter first.\n\n\"When my father put me in HM, he told the Headmaster, Mr. Prettyman, that I would go to M.I.T. and to prepare me for that. I accepted his judgement but had always understood it was a very hard school...I lived with these assumptions until my father came home from a business trip to Boston. My father was a patent lawyer and had been talking to an inventor friend. This inventor said to him, \"What are you going to do with your boy?\" My father said, \"I'm going to send him to M.I.T.\" The inventor said, \"Why?\" My father said, \"It's a good engineering school, isn't it?\" and the reply was, \"Yes, but engineers nowadays are a dime a dozen. Why don't you get him an education? Did you ever think of sending him to Harvard?\" My father had to say \"no\" because he didn't know much about Harvard so his friend took him to Cambridge and must have given him a pretty good sales talk because when he came home he interrupted me at my homework with the surprising question, \"How would you like to go to Harvard?\" I knew nothing of the place either, but my immediate response was \"It's O.K. with me.\" such are the odd ways in which our lives are formed! Horace Mann was told of the change and did a good job of seeing to it that I met Harvard's entrance requirements.\n\n\"Now, I will tell you about the adventure I had with Ken Bainbridge, which touches on the history of electronics...Ken and I had a common interest in what we then knew as \"wireless.\" He was a very advanced wireless amateur and had gotten into the latest development, the wireless telephone. Lee deForest had a liking for these amateurs and liked to communicate with them about technical matters. At this time, WWI had recently ended and the Atlantic Fleet was parked in the Hudson River. Many of the ships were equipped with wireless telephones made by Western Electric. the Navy operators were having a picnic with these new toys. They would talk to each other, tell jokes and converse with the amateurs, to whom the Navy equipment was of great interest. You had only to go down to a dock and get a free ride in a Navy launch to any ship you wanted to visit.\n\n\"DeForest, too, was interested in the equipment and he wanted to acquire some of the vacuum tubes the Navy had. Evidently he couldn't get these tubes from the hone company so he made deals with the amateurs to buy them from the Navy operators...One day Ken invited me to go along to buy a couple of spare tubes, which we took out to the lab where we watched deForest himself test them. And that is how I got to meet the famous inventor. A strictly illegal transaction but the Statute of Limitations ahs run...\n\n\"I remember one other related event in a HM assembly when other classmates set up a wireless telephone demonstration. One group set up transmitting equipment in an apartment in Manhattan and another set up receiving equipment in the school. After much fiddling around and buildup of anxiety we finally heard the feeble sounds of a voice we all knew coming from several miles away - without wires! Thus were we boys introduced to the possibilities of what came to be known as broadcasting.\n\n\"I came to Horace Mann under its first headmaster, Prettyman. The second headmaster, Tillinghast, arrived the following year. The third was Mitchell Gratwick and I also became well acquainted with him. After my first wife died in 1953, I married a girl whose father was headmaster of Milton Academy...She had a classmate named Barbara Burnett who married Mitch Gratwick. One of their daughters has been a friend of ours in Washington ever since we have lived there. I called her up a few days ago to ask her some questions about her father's career - and told her about tonight's affair. She lost her husband a year ago and I learned that she is living alone. I told her I was too. \"I'll call you up when you get back from New York,\" she said. \"We can get together.\"\n\n\"The HM connection continues! It has been a pleasure being with you.\"\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1994: Arthur H. Aufses, Jr. '42 and Sondra Markowitz Miller '46\n\nArthur H. Aufses, Jr. is Chairman of the Department of Surgery at Mr. Sinai Hospital in New York, and Franz W. Sichel Professor of Surgery and Chairman of the Department at Mt. Sinai Medical School. He received his M.D. from Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. Upon completing his residency at Mt. Sinai, he was appointed to increasingly responsible roles in the surgical department there, culminating in his present position. In 1988 he was a member of the transplant team when Mt. Sinai became the first hospital in New York State to perform a liver transplant. He is a member of numerous medical societies and author of many scientific articles. His major clinical and research interests are in Crohn's Disease and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n\nThree generations of his family have attended Horace Mann. His son, Arthur III, was graduated in 1968, and grandchildren Kate and Arthur are in the classes of '04 and '08, respectively. His daughter, Carolyn, is a lawyer.\n\nSondra Markowitz Miller was appointed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court by Governor Cuomo in 1990. She previously served as a New York State Supreme Court Judge of the 9th JD and as Family Court Judge in Westchester. Among Justice Miller's \"firsts\" are her law degree from Harvard (in its first class to admit women), and her election to the Supreme Court in 1986 (the first woman in the 9th JD to be so recognized and its highest ranking female jurist).\n\nHer decisions are frequently cited especially for their impact on family law and children's rights. She serves on the New York State Permanent Judicial Commission on Justice for Children and the Governor's Commissions for the Study of Youth Crime and Violence and Reform of the Juvenile Justice System.\n\nJudge Miller is a 1946 graduate of the Horace Mann School for Girls. Her children, Seth Rubin Miller '74 and Miriam Rubin Reback '77 are Horace Mann graduates, as is her daughter-in-law, Amanda Neubardt Miller '83.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1993: Justin Kaplan '41 and Richard Kluger '52\n\nJustin Kaplan '41 is the author of Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain, which won both the Pulitzer Prize for Biography and the National Book Award in Arts and Letters. His biography, Walt Whitman: A Life, received the American Book Award, and other books include Lincoln Steffen, a Biography, and Mark Twain and His World. He has served as editor of many works, most recently of the 16th Edition of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. He is professor of contemporary letters at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, and lives in Cambridge with his wife, the novelist Anne Bernays.\n\nRichard Kluger '52, former book-publishing executive and prize-winning journalist, has written on a variety of subjects. Simple Justice, published in 1976, was hailed as the definitive account of the Brown vs. the Board of Education Supreme Court ruling outlawing segregation. It was singled out in the New York Law Journal as number one amongst the \"The Best Law Books.\" His book, The Paper, a history of the New York Herald Tribune, received the George Polk Award, and he has written several novels. He is currently at work on The Weed, a history of the tobacco industry. Dick and Phyllis Kluger live in Ringoes, New Jersey.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1992: Andrew Hacker '47 and Elspeth Davies Rostow '34\n\nAndrew Hacker '47 is recognized as one of the leading political scientists in the country. He has taught at many leading universities, for the last twenty years as Professor of Government at Queens College. He is the author of seven books in the fields of political theory and American government, and is a frequent contributor to such publications at Time, Newsweek, and the Atlantic Monthly. His most recent and widely acclaimed book, Two Nations: Black and White, Separate, Hostile and Unequal, explores the widening chasm between black and white races in America.\n\nElspeth Davies Rostow '34, a distinguished educator, author, and social scientist, is former Dean of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, and is currently the Stiles Professor of American Studies there. Under the auspices of the USIA, she lectured for the Department of State in Europe and conducted a series of \"Seminars for Diplomats.\" As past Director of the Lyndon Johnson Foundation and trustee of the College Entrance Examination Board Commission for the National Agenda for the Eighties, Ms. Rostow has exercised considerable influence on national education issues.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1991: Dr. Edwin Goldwasser '36 and Dr. Edgar Haber '49\n\nLast October 30, over 125 guests, including members of the Presidents Circle and classmates of the honorees, gathered to pay tribute to the recipients of the Alumni Association Award for Distinguished Achievement.\n\nThe always-festive reception and dinner was again hosted by former trustee Peter A. Brown '53, and brought back to Horace Mann many alumni who hadn't seen the school in over 50 years. There was much nostalgia and good feeling as graduates from several generations got re-acquainted.\n\nThe Class of 1936, boasting a third award winner from amongst its ranks, was well represented by both the boys school and girls school. Economist Robert Heilbroner '36, an earlier honoree, presented the award to his classmate and spoke of the life-long friendship begun at Horace Mann with Dr. Goldwasser and two other classmates, Peter Bernstein and John H. Loeb, affectionately remembering good times shared at Horace Mann and at Harvard.\n\nThe 1991 winners certainly don't lack for awards and honors, but Horace Mann takes pride in singling them out from amongst its own graduates for their outstanding scientific achievements.\n\nEdwin Goldwasser (known as Ned), did his undergraduate work at Harvard and received a PhD in Physics at Berkeley. Most of his career has been devoted to teaching and research at the University of Illinois, but he has also held many prestigious posts elsewhere.\n\nHe served as Chairman of the Division of Physical Sciences of the National Research Council and the Commission on Particles and Fields of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics. He was a member of the General Advisory Committee of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the National Academy of Science's committee for the evaluation of the sites for a 200-GeV accelerator laboratory. In 1967, Dr. Goldwasser joined the newly organized Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory as Deputy Director, taking an extended leave of absence from the University of Illinois. He returned in 1978 as Vice Chancellor of the Urbana-Champaign campus, leaving in 1986 to join the Central Design Group of the Superconducting Super Collider. In 1988 he returned to the University once again as Acting Director of the Office of International Programs and Studies.\n\nCardiologist Edgar Haber received his undergraduate and medical degrees from Columbia, and took further medical and scientific training at Massachusetts General Hospital, the National Heart Institute in the Laboratory of Cellular Physiology and the Cardiac Department at St. George's Hospital in London.\n\nDr. Haber has held a series of positions of increasing importance at both Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General. During two decades he built a world-renowned cardiology department with a staff of approximately 300. He is known worldwide for invention of the assays for digoxin and renin, for his early elucidation of the renin-angiotensin system, and as a pioneer in biotechnology. Currently he is Elkan Blout Professor of Health Science and Director of the Division of Biological Sciences at the Harvard School of Public Health, and Clinical Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. He also served for several years as President of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Research Institute. In 1987 Dr. Haber came to Horace Mann for its Centennial, speaking on \"Monoclonal Antibodies,\" a technique for fighting blood clots developed in his lab at Massachusetts General.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1990: Daniel Rose '47\n\nThe annual President's Circle reception held on May 16th was the occasion of a tribute to Daniel Rose, recipient of the 1990 Alumni Association Award for Distinguished Achievement. President R. Inslee Clark introduced Mr. Rose with the following remarks:\n\n\"First-rate institutions do not happen by luck but rather by having people in their midst with vision, sensitivity, and true leadership ability. This institution has been virtually singularly blessed by such people - no one of whom is more notable than the man we honor tonight. Dan Rose is a giant within this community as is his marvelous and unique family. They are special to us in a way that only a few families could possibly be. In honoring Dan this evening as Alumnus of the Year, we honor this school and all it stands for.\n\n\"A distinguished graduate of Horace Mann, Dan went on to a distinguished career at Yale, the University of Paris, and the Russian Language Program at Syracuse University. Following military service as an Intelligence Analyst and Russian Language specialist with the United States Air Force, Dan's professional career has been extraordinarily diverse, productive, and impressive. He has served as an Expert Advisor to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and to the Commissioner of Education. He has been a member of the Governor's Task Force on Housing, the Task Force on Taxation for the Municipal Assistance Corporation, and a Director of the New York Council for the Humanities.\n\n\"He is President and Chief Executive Officer of Rose Associates, a major force in the real estate and development world with projects and undertakings up and down the Eastern Seaboard. His educational interests and talents have called him to such a broad range of activities that it would take me an entire evening to begin to cover the list.\n\n\"Closer to home and even more important to me has been his work as a Trustee and Chairman of the Board of our school. From 1971 to 1974, Dan's inspired leadership as Chairman was a joy for all of us to behold. I probably worked closest with him at that time, and together we saw the school move through an exciting merger with Barnard to a totally co-educational institution Pre-K though twelve. I personally felt Dan's support, trust, and great friendship during that period and ever since. No school could be more blessed than ours in having Dan as its friend and supporter. He is truly a man amongst men and a leader in this community and in the world. What an honor for us to honor Dan Rose!\"\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1989: Helen Lehman Buttenwieser '23 and Morris E. Lasker '34\n\nTwo eminent jurists were chosen this year as co-recipients of the annual Award for Distinguished Achievement by the Alumni Association. Attorney Helen Lehman\n\nButtenwieser and the Honorable Morris Lasker received their awards at the\n\nPresident's Circle dinner on May 4 1989.\n\nLike many of her fellow graduates of the Horace Mann School for Girls, Helen Lehman Buttenwieser was a trailblazer - both as a lawyer and as a fighter for human rights. The City Bar Association has called her a \"Pioneer\" - and that indeed is what she is.\n\nMrs. Buttenwieser was the first woman to chair the Legal Aid Society in its 107-year-old history, the first to chair a standing committee of the New York Bar Association, ad first to serve as trustee of the Title Guarantee and Trust Company. She has been a director of the New York Civil Liberties Union since 1951, and is active in the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. She was honored by the City Bar Association, and received from the Legal Aid Society its \"Servant of Justice\" award.\n\nThe Horace Mann - Barnard Alumni Association Award, presented by Franklin Speyer '65, reads as follows: In recognition of her achievements as a distinguished lawyer and human rights activist, who has pioneered the causes of women, children, and minorities throughout her long and dedicated career; whose silent generosity has benefitted countless others; and whose accomplishments are a source of pride and inspiration tot he Horace Mann - Barnard family.\n\nJudge Morris Lasker has been heralded by American Lawyer magazine as the best of the 59 trial judges in the judicial circuit comprising New York, Connecticut and Vermont.\" The New York Times has called him one of New York's most distinguished jurists, who has \"acted with courage, compassion and patience in directing litigation over conditions in the city jails.\"\n\nHe worked for the Senate Committee for National Preparedness after completing Yale Law School, serving in the Air Force during World War II. He joined the law firm of Battle, Fowler in New York, ran as Democratic candidate for Congress in 1950 and, in 1968, was appointed to the Federal Bench by President Johnson.\n\nJudge Lasker, who has recently taken senior status on the court, was presented with the Alumni Association Award with this citation: In recognition of the achievements of a distinguished lawyer and jurist, who has served his community and his country with dedication; who with courage and compassion has championed the cause of prisoners' rights and of all human rights; the Horace Mann - Barnard School honors itself by conferring upon you this award.\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1988: Edward B. Koren '53\n\nAt the annual President's Circle Dinner, held on May 4, two graduates were honored by the Alumni Associates. Edward Koren, cartoonist whose work is regularly featured in the New Yorker, was named 1988 Distinguished Alumnus.\n\nHorace Mann and Columbia College were both privileged to have cartoons from the \"early Koren\" period. After studying print-making in Paris, Mr. Koren returned to the US to study for a Master in Fine Art from Pratt Institute. He later taught at Brown University, where those famous \"furry creatures\" were born. HM classmate and New Yorker colleague Gerald Jonas wrote the following citation for Mr. Koren's award: Through the legerdemain of reverse evolution, you bring out the fuzzy creature in all of us. Digging beneath the age-old fur, you tickle us - and when we are done laughing, we not only feel better, we know ourselves better. In gratitude, your fellow alumni take pleasure in conferring upon you this award for distinguished achievement.\"\n\nBack to Award for Distinguished Achievement\n\n1987: I. Michael Heyman '47\n\nSince 1980, I. Michael Heyman has been Chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley. After his graduation from Horace Mann in 1947, Mr. Heyman went on to Dartmouth and the Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal. His distinguished career in law has included a clerkship to Chief Justice Earl Warren and teaching positions at Yale, Stanford, and Berkeley Law Schools."
