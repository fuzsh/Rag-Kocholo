Duke University boasts a favorable student to faculty ratio of 8:1. This ratio generally indicates that you can expect smaller class sizes and increased interaction with your professors. Additionally, around 70% of their undergraduate classes have less than 15 students, which further emphasizes the small class environment.

While a low student to faculty ratio doesn't guarantee individual attention for each student, it does create opportunities for you to engage with professors and participate in class discussions. To make the most of the available resources, it's important to proactively attend office hours, engage with teaching assistants, and actively participate in class. Building strong relationships with your professors can also lead to research opportunities, career guidance, and more personalized letters of recommendation when needed.

Overall, the student to faculty ratio at Duke is quite competitive compared to other universities, and should enable you to receive the level of attention and support you're seeking in your college experience.
