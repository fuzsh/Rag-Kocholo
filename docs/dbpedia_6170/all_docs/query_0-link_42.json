        "text": "If you like studying people and seek to understand why they behave the way they do and what their experience is like, then you may enjoy psychology.\n\nKnowledge from psychological theory and research can help us to understand the world better, and to gain insight into how we can live healthier more productive lives. Psychology focuses on understanding how the brain and the environment contribute to behavior. Because psychology is a science, you will learn analytical skills and how to evaluate research. The psychology degree at Stockton offers many applied experiences, such as research opportunities and internships, to help students prepare for the next level.\n\nThe psychology major prepares students to work under supervision when providing psychological services and also prepares students for business, law school, research, teacher certification, and more."
