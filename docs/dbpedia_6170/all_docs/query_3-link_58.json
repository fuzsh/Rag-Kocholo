        "text": "Ivy League rankings discussion\n\n“The Big Three” rank among the top Ivy League schools on nearly every list\n\nHistorically, “The Big Three”—Harvard, Yale, and Princeton—have comprised the top three institutions across the board. However, recently Columbia has occasionally made an appearance in the top 3 on some lists.\n\nSelectivity is associated with each school’s desirability. The more selective a school is, the more likely it is that your child will list it as their dream school. Moreover, graduate programs, employers, and others who might one day evaluate your child’s resume will view higher-ranked schools slightly more favorably than lower-ranked ones. That said, all Ivy League schools are excellent. Evaluators will be impressed by your child’s attendance of any of them.\n\nOverall rankings are lacking when it comes to determining “fit”\n\nMost people would agree that Harvard, Yale, and Princeton are considered the most elite and prestigious Ivy League schools. However, based on your child’s subjects of interest, preferred setting, and opportunities, some schools might be a better fit than others.\n\nFor instance, if your child is interested in studying political science or drama, Yale would be an excellent choice. On the other hand, if your child wants to pursue engineering or hotel management, Cornell might be the better fit for them.\n\nIn addition, it’s important to consider each school’s setting when applying to Ivy League schools. Penn, for instance, might offer more immediate access to working with low-income communities than Princeton. Moreover, whether your child wants to attend school in an urban, suburban, or rural setting should influence their choice on where to apply. For example, do they want to live in a big city or be as close to nature as possible?\n\nStudent body size is another meaningful variable for your child to think about. Most of the Ivy League schools enroll somewhere between 4,000 and 8,000 undergraduate students, while Cornell is an outlier, typically enrolling over 10,000 undergrads. Whether your child wants to be part of a relatively small or large student body might contribute to their overall happiness and social opportunities during college.\n\nFinally, campus culture varies from school to school. For example, Harvard promotes close relationships among students through its residential college system, whereas Brown is widely regarded as the most progressive Ivy League school.\n\nIvy League schools aren’t the only prestigious schools in the country\n\nAlthough the Ivy League is often used synonymously with “best colleges”, there are a number of other institutions that are just as academically and reputationally elite. In other words, your child does not have to attend an Ivy League school in order for them to be considered among the country’s highest-achieving students."
