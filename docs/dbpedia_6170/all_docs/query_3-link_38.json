But first, we highlight some of the most popular colleges based on variables such as enrollment size, selectivity, and reputation.\n\nAll school data below comes from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Tuition and fees are from 2022-2023, while acceptance rates, enrollment statistics, net prices, and number of applicants are from 2021.\n\n1. Duke University\n\nAvg. Undergraduate Tuition & Fees: $62,688\n\nAcceptance Rate: 6%\n\nTotal Student Enrollment: 17,620\n\nDuke is one of the most prestigious universities in the U.S., especially when it comes to its business, engineering, and law schools. Duke is also among the most selective schools, with an acceptance rate of just 6%.\n\nIts campus spreads over 16,000 acres, including over 7,000 in one of the country’s largest private research forests, Duke Forest. Based in Durham, Duke may be best known for its men’s basketball program, often hailed as one of the best programs in college history.\n\nImage credit: deborah neumann kelly / Moment / Getty Images\n\n2.
