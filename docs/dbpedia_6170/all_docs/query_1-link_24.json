        "text": "Graduates â€“ Since its founding in 2000, the College has graduated over 1,200 students. Alumni have attended top-tier law schools including Harvard University, Yale University, the College of William & Mary, Duke University, and the University of Virginia, as well as respected graduate programs in other fields at Georgetown University, Johns Hopkins University, and The Catholic University of America (click here for additional graduate and law schools). They hold positions ranging from associate producers at news outlets, editors at publishing companies, and teachers at classical Christian schools to law clerks, legislative assistants, and analysts at intelligence agencies and other federal departments.\n\nThe 4-year graduation rate is 65% (2019 cohort); the 6-year graduation rate is 65% (2017 cohort). Data provided by responding alumni one year after Commencement indicates 100% of graduates were happily employed or in graduate school (source: 2021 Alumni One Year Post BA Survey). In a survey administered 5 years after graduation, 53% of alumni had applied to graduate/law schools, of which 100% were accepted and 78% enrolled in one of their top three choices (2021 Alumni Five-Year Post-BA Survey). The College does not offer and does not calculate placement rates for certificate programs or programs leading to licensure."
