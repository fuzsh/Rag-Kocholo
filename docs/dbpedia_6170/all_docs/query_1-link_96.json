Just saw the floorplans for my Southgate floor…</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, share your room size if you know it!</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, I would also really like to know where you guys found floor plans. Could anyone please post the floor plans for Gilbert-Addoms? Could anyone give a rough estimate of the average size of a single in East Campus, what about a single in Gilbert-Addoms?</p>\n\n<p>I think RLHS takes those down after roompix is over. I couldn’t find them when I was looking this summer but they were definitely up earlier this spring.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: nvm, it looks like RLHS posts floorplans for west/central campuses. I guess I wasn’t looking hard enough :-/</p>\n\n<p>but if you go to their website, you can see pictures of dorms on east</p>\n\n<p><a href=“http://rlhs.studentaffairs.duke.edu/newstudents/index.html[/url]”>http://rlhs.studentaffairs.duke.edu/newstudents/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n<p>When clicking on the link this is what appears:</p>\n\n<p>An Error Has Occured</p>\n\n<p>The page you requested can’t be found.

Boy, some of those floor plans don’t even look like they can fit the 6 foot bed frames and then some doubles have walk in closets about 3/4 the size of some of the singles.</p>"
