        "text": "Peer Institutions & Programmatic Aspirants\n\nAs Elon proceeds with the Boldly Elon Strategic plan, the Long Range Planning Committee took on the charge of creating a new institutional Peer and Aspirant list. The Committee conducted research and consulted with various groups across campus, including the board of trustees, academic units, senior staff, academic council, alumni, students and parents. A campus conversation was held on March 4, 2022.\n\nThe work of the Long Range Planning Committee substantiated Elon’s distinction as a mid-sized, liberal arts university that is grounded in the liberal arts and sciences and complemented by distinctive professional and graduate programs. Analysis of the data as well as a thorough examination of Elon’s Carnegie Classification indicated that there is no other school in the country exactly like Elon. Nonetheless, the study revealed several comparable schools in terms of size, scope, and resources.\n\nIt was in this spirit that the Long Range Planning Committee developed the following list of institutions that can be used in whole or in part for the purposes of general comparisons (Peer Institutions). Other lists, however, may be more appropriate for precise comparisons, such as those involving specific units or academic departments.\n\nPeer Institutions\n\nAmerican University (DC)\n\nBucknell University (PA)\n\nChapman University (CA)\n\nFordham University (NY)\n\nFurman University (SC)\n\nGonzaga University (WA)\n\nJames Madison University (VA)\n\nLehigh University (PA)\n\nMarquette University (WI)\n\nMiami University – Oxford (OH)\n\nSanta Clara University (CA)\n\nSouthern Methodist University (TX)\n\nSyracuse University (NY)\n\nUniversity of Denver (CO)\n\nWilliam & Mary (VA)\n\nWith regard to a new list of Aspirant Institutions, the Long Range Planning Committee decided to focus on a list of institutions to be called “Programmatic Aspirants.”\n\nElon University aspires to become an even better Elon, committed to creating the preeminent community for engaged learning in the tradition of a liberal arts university and in the context of a residential living-learning environment.\n\nIn aspiring, the University looks to other colleges and universities that exemplify excellence, specifically excellence in practices central to high-impact teaching and learning environments and, moreover, excellence across a number of such practices. Institutions rising to this exemplar status are not limited to a category, but rather span from coast to coast, from large to small, from very high research to baccalaureate. It is not a category to which Elon aspires; it is to excellence.\n\nThe following institutions characterize such exemplar status, reflecting excellence within specific high-impact practices but also across a number of high-impact practices.\n\nProgrammatic Aspirants – Institutions with Exemplary Benchmark Characteristics\n\nFirst Year Experiences\n\nBates College\n\nColumbia University\n\nDavidson College\n\nStanford University\n\nUniversity of North Carolina—Chapel Hill\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame\n\nUniversity of South Carolina\n\nWashington University in St. Louis\n\nLearning Communities\n\nSyracuse University\n\nUniversity of South Carolina\n\nVanderbilt University\n\nWashington University in St. Louis\n\nYale University\n\nInternships\n\nAmerican University\n\nCornell University\n\nDrexel University\n\nCollege of the Holy Cross\n\nNortheastern University\n\nUniversity of Southern California\n\nService Learning\n\nBrown University\n\nDuke University\n\nGeorgetown University\n\nNortheastern University\n\nStanford University\n\nUniversity of North Carolina—Chapel Hill\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nWake Forest University\n\nWashington University in St. Louis\n\nSenior Capstone\n\nBrown University\n\nCarleton College\n\nCollege of Wooster\n\nDuke University\n\nFordham University\n\nPortland State University\n\nPrinceton University\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nWagner University\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nBoston College\n\nCarleton College\n\nDickinson College\n\nGoucher College\n\nKalamazoo College\n\nStanford University\n\nUniversity of Kentucky\n\nUniversity of Minnesota\n\nWake Forest University\n\nUndergraduate Research\n\nCarleton College\n\nCollege of Wooster\n\nDartmouth College\n\nDavidson College\n\nDuke University\n\nNortheastern University\n\nPomona College\n\nPrinceton University\n\nStanford University\n\nUniversity of North Carolina—Chapel Hill\n\nUniversity of South Carolina\n\nVanderbilt University\n\nYale University\n\nWriting in the Disciplines\n\nBrown University\n\nCarleton College\n\nCornell University\n\nDuke University\n\nMiddlebury College\n\nNorth Carolina State University—Raleigh\n\nPrinceton University\n\nStanford University\n\nYale University\n\nIt is noted that in the U.S. News & World Report list of “Academic Programs to Look For,” Elon University has been recognized for all 8 high-impact educational programs. Based on a survey of higher education leaders across the country, Elon is noted for excellence in (1) study abroad, (2) internships, (3) service learning, (4) undergraduate research, (5) learning communities, (6) first-year experiences, (7) senior capstones, and (8) writing in the disciplines. Many institutions from Elon’s peer list may also be recognized for excellence in some of these high-impact practices but they are not included in the aspirational list because they will already be included in our analysis as peers.\n\nThe peer and programmatic aspirant lists are for institutional comparisons and can be used in planning and benchmarking. Departments and programs are encouraged to benchmark appropriate comparison schools."
