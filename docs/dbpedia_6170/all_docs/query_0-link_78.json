        "text": "Summer School 2000 registrants will be placed in one of two very modern, air-conditioned dorms, the Stevenson Towers, found on the West end of the campus. Suites, as well as single and double rooms are available in the dorms. Registrants may check into their dorms any time after 1:00 PM on Friday, July 28.\n\nAttendees will use single-sex bathrooms located on each floor. All Single Rooms have one twin bed, dresser, night stand, micro fridge and armoire. All Double Rooms have two twin beds, dressers, night stands and armoires, with one micro fridge. There are a limited number of Suites available with private bathrooms which consist of two bedrooms and a common lounge area. These suites will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis, with preference given to families. Some families and couples may wish to stay at local hotels (see the Alternate Housing section). Each bedroom in a suite sleeps up to two people and contains the same furniture as described above as well as two micro fridges, one in each bedroom. In addition, the common room in each suite has a couch, two easy chairs, a coffee table and end tables with lamps. Linens will be provided for each attendee. Attendees must bring their own alarm clocks.\n\nEach bedroom has a telephone with free campus and local calls. There are also pay phones in the main lobby. The Stevenson Main Desk telephone number is (815) 753-0371 and is open 24-hours a day. The Main Desk will give out guest phone numbers, but not room numbers.\n\nExcept for the IceBreaker and one special evening dinner, all breakfast and dinners will be served in the central Stevenson cafeteria located in the dormitory quad. Lunches will be taken at the Holmes Center cafeteria, convenient to the lecture hall. Housing registration includes meals and all meals will have suitable alternatives for Vegetarians.\n\nThe 2000 Summer School has appointed One-Stop Chicago as the official air travel coordinator for the meeting. One-Stop Chicago provides attendees with personalized, unbiased airline reservations and ticketing at the lowest available fare with one easy call. Chicago OHares International Airport is the closest and most convenient airport located near Northern Illinois University. For those people also attending the Chicago 2000 World Congress prior to the Summer School, OHares International Airport is also the closest to Navy Pier.\n\nFLY ON UNITED OR DELTA AND SAVE!\n\n5% discount off any domestic published air fare, including first class or 10% discount off unrestricted mid-week coach fares.
