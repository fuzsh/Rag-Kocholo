        "text": "Duke School is an inclusive, inspiring environment to teach, challenge, and guide your children from preschool through eighth grade. We have had children there since 2015. Our oldest is now in public high school and constantly says that he is excelling and prepared because of “that good Duke School model of reflect and share.” Some parents may wonder about the lack of grades or calling teachers by their first names. Trust the process - it creates learners who feel valued and engaged. And our teachers are respected as experts and trusted for their insight and knowledge of child development. We have also benefited from the financial assistance of Index Tuition. We are forever grateful for a place like Duke School to help us raise confident, compassionate and resilient kids.\n\nDuke School has given our children the best K-8th education we could have ever wished for! Our children have thrived academically in mathematics, writing and reading because of their Duke School education. Equally important, our children take responsibility for their own learning. They are also open to new opportunities and experiences. For example, our children have joined sports teams, math and debate teams, and investment groups in high school. They have excelled even at the national level in their activities because of the critical thinking and work ethic Duke School has instilled in them."
