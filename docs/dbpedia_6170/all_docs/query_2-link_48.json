        "text": "What We Do:\n\nHow We Stand Out:\n\nPrograms:\n\nWe offer a suite of majors in the biological sciences that range from those that focus on molecules and cells to those that focus on the interactions of organisms with their environments.\n\nPrograms Housed Within the Department:\n\nBiology - The biology major is the largest major on our campus and provides students with a strong background across the broad field of biology. It is an extremely versatile degree that provides an excellent foundation for careers in science and healthcare. Students in the major study the diversity of life on earth, focusing on fundamental concepts such as the relationship between structure and function, evolution, and integration across the discipline. Through one-on-one interaction with our faculty, our students gain in-depth experience in the process of science, learn laboratory techniques, and share in the excitement of scientific discovery.\n\nPhysiology - Students of physiology learn how organisms function at many levels of organization, from the molecular and cellular level up to the organismal and ecological levels. Our Physiology major maintains a focus on an integrated approach both in lecture and laboratory to facilitate student learning, enabling us to best prepare the next generation of biomedical providers and physiology researchers.\n\nInterdisciplinary Programs:\n\nBiochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology - The BCMB major is an interdisciplinary program of study between the biology and chemistry departments. The program provides students with an understanding of the fundamentals of biology and chemistry and the key principles of biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, as suggested by the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. There is a strong emphasis on genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics. Students who graduate from the program are expected to possess skills suitable for biotechnical work in the pharmaceutical, health and agricultural industries and for further academic pursuits in graduate or professional schools.\n\nEnvironmental Science - The environmental science major is an interdisciplinary program of the biology and chemistry departments. The program provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between biological, chemical, and physical aspects of the natural environment. The curriculum includes rigorous training in analytical and instrumental techniques commonly used to investigate environmental problems. Majors have the flexibility to concentrate their studies on either biological or chemical aspects depending on interests and desired career path. Experiential learning opportunities, such as an internship or an undergraduate research project, are also required. Exposure to social, political, regulatory, economic, and ethical concerns surrounding environmental issues and policy is integrated into the coursework as well.\n\nNeuroscience - With one of the oldest undergraduate neuroscience programs in the country (founded in 1987), 13 faculty and 110 students, Scranton provides a close knit community for learning and developing ideas that lead to an expanding number of careers in clinical settings, research, teaching, criminal justice, and other areas. Students who choose this remarkably flexible science major can choose courses that best fit their career paths while here, even if their initial specific goal changes as their college experience expands. The rogram is small enough to provide the small university benefits of personal connection and exposure, but large enough to provide large university opportunities to work toward career attainment in an expanding, enduring, socially relevant, and rewarding field.\n\nMeet Our Faculty:\n\nInside the Classroom:\n\nStudent Research:\n\nWe firmly believe that research is a critical and integral part of the educational process. The faculty of the Biology Department is deeply committed to involving students in their research endeavors.\n\nStudents work hand-in-hand with faculty collaborators. Students are also encouraged to attend and participate in local and national scientific meetings and conferences, allowing them to hone their scientific communication skills as well as network with other students and scientists from around the globe.\n\nCareer Outcomes:"
