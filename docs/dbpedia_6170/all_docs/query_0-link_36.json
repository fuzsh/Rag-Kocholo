        "text": "Surface Current Mapping: (IOOS Surface Currents Program Manager, Brian Zelenke, brian.zelenke@noaa.gov):\n\nCongratulations to MARACOOS on the launch of their latest oceanographic high-frequency radar (HFR) at Lewes Beach, Delaware! A dedication ceremony was held on Friday, June 25, 2021 on the beach with remarks delivered by (in speaking order): Gerhard Kuska (MARACOOS Executive Director), Ted Becker (Mayor of Lewes, DE), Robin Morgan (University of Delaware Provost), Stephen Smyk (Delaware House of Representatives), Shawn Garvin (Secretary of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources & Environmental Control), Tom Carper (United States Senator for Delaware), Louis Uccellini (Director of NOAA’s National Weather Service), and Carl Gouldman (U.S. IOOS Office Director). This new HFR significantly increases the IOOS Surface Current Program’s coverage in the Delaware Bay, providing surface current velocity and wave data that will benefit forecast models and data products that directly support U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue, National Weather Service forecasting, NOAA’s navigation services to Delaware pilots and mariners, oil spill and pollution tracking, and recreational boaters and sailors.\n\nGliders (IOOS POC Kathleen Bailey, kathleen.bailey@noaa.gov; Underwater Glider User Group (UG2) POC Bill Lingsch, bill.lingsch@noaa.gov); Click here to join UG2:\n\n2021 Hurricane Glider Deployments: As part of the coordinated hurricane glider effort, IOOS RAs, AOML and WHOI, alongside academic partners, OCOVI, and the Navy have deployed 12 ocean gliders to date during this 2021 hurricane season, with many more planned. These particular community gliders are traversing targeted areas in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Gulf Stream and contribute temperature/salinity profiles through the IOOS Glider DAC to the NOAA Real-time Ocean Forecast System (RTOFS) for data assimilation. The new data assimilative RTOFS is providing the initial conditions for the 2021 coupled regional hurricane forecast models, and is representing many of the essential ocean features important for hurricane forecasts. Data impact analyses are ongoing, however early analyses conducted by Rutgers in coordination with NWS partners indicate the glider data are having a significant positive impact on RTOFS, further improving the vertical structure of the essential ocean features beyond what is currently achieved through satellite data alone. Our partners expect to deploy many more gliders throughout the remainder of the hurricane season in critical areas, including the South Atlantic and Mid Atlantic Bights. These deployments are made possible by funding from OMAO, OAR/GOMO, AOML, and IOOS.\n\nUnderwater Glider User Group (UG2) Updates:\n\nUG2 Underwater Gliders Deployments: Please visit http://underwatergliders.org/index.php/deployments/ and update your 2021 and early 2022 operations and plans to share with the UG2 community.\n\nUG2 Webinars: Please submit interest to brief for the upcoming August series that includes glider sensors and/or operational lessons learned.

This NYSERDA report, currently in press, is intended to facilitate transparency and sharing of non-proprietary environmental data for offshore wind (OSW) energy development, including projects selling power to the State, by reviewing key wildlife-focused databases to which data owners can submit their raw data or derived data products. The Animal Telemetry Network (ATN) Data Assembly Center is included in a list of 15 databases that are recommended as primary or secondary repositories for different types of raw data generated by OSW developers and their contractors. Other recommended databases include OBIS-SEAMAP, Ocean Tracking Network, Motus Database, Seabird Tracking Database, NCEI Passive Acoustic Monitoring Archive and the National Database for Deep-Sea Corals and Sponges.\n\nNew Paper from the University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science and the Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy: An ecological assessment of large coastal shark communities in South Florida Abigail M. Tinari, Neil Hammerschlag https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569121002556?dgcid=author or https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105772 This paper presents the results from standardized surveys of large coastal sharks off South Florida, ranging from Miami through the middle Florida Keys. It is a culmination of research that began in 2009 that has been supported by many amazing individuals. Spatial, seasonal & environmental patterns in shark abundance, species composition, & size/sex structure were examined. In total, we surveyed 3,398 sharks of 15 species. The most common sharks surveyed were nurse, blacktip, bull, lemon, & great hammerhead. While the composition of species off Miami and in the Keys are generally similar, we found clear species-specific differences. Habitat type and depth emerged as the most important environmental factors affecting abundances and sizes of the shark species surveyed. Management zones with the most restrictive fishing regulations generally supported higher abundances of shark. These data serve as a baseline for future monitoring of shark populations in South Florida and assessing their response to future environmental change.\n\nAnimal Telemetry Featured in British Ecological Society, Methods in Ecology and Evolution Issue: Animal Telemetry made the cover of the June 2021 Issue of the British Ecological Society, Methods in Ecology and Evolution – photo by Rob Harcourt, Macquarie University.

Publication in the Federal Register began the 60-day public comment period for the Draft PEIS, which ends on August 24, 2021.\n\nSummer 2021 High Tide Bulletin Now Available: View the bulletin to see when you may experience higher than normal high tides for the period of time between June and August, 2021. Tides are the regular rise and fall of the sea surface caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun and their position relative to the earth. There are some factors that cause the tides to be higher than what is \"normally\" seen from day to day. Depending on non-tidal conditions (wind, storms, etc.), regions may experience impacts before or after the dates mentioned here. Higher than normal high tides alone do not necessarily cause coastal flooding. However, they are becoming increasingly impactful due to continued sea level rise. High tide flooding that inundates busy streets, and washes out beaches is more likely to occur during these periods depending on your location along the coast. More severe flooding may result if adverse weather — heavy rains, strong wind or big waves — conditions are present.

From mid-June through late summer, the forecast provides up to a two-day-early warning of the probability of occurrence of Vibrio pathogens, enabling state officials to educate the public and reduce the risk of Vibrio infections by taking appropriate measures. The forecast shows when and where the pathogenic V. vulnificus is most likely to be found. Vibrio bacteria occur naturally in coastal waters, but certain species and strains can be harmful to human health. Some species can cause a skin infection when exposed to an open wound. NCCOS led development of the forecast models, and CO-OPS helped make the forecast operational.\n\nEuroGOOS Publishes Policy Brief Promoting Ocean Literacy: EuroGOOS has published a policy briefpromoting ocean literacy as an emerging priority in oceanography.
