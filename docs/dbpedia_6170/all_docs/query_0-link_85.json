You've probably already heard those words from Duke alumni in your area, and between now and your 1983 Commencement, I hope you'll make other contacts with the Alumni Association. We're glad you chose Duke University and are con- fident you will bring distinction to our alma mater. The University, in return, will provide you with the stimulation, variety, and solid academic base that is the essence of good undergraduate education. A wide range of new friendships will be an impor- tant part of your Duke experience. That is why the Association wants you to have this class directory - a source of identification and, hopefully, a starting point of these new friendships. On behalf of all Duke alumni, my best wishes to each of you for a most rewarding undergraduate experi- ence. L. Neil Williams T'58, J.D. '61 Atlanta, Georgia President General Alumni Association One Person's Duke Being a native Southerner, although a reconstructed one, I have grown during my more than twenty-three years at Duke University to be keenly interested in and attracted by a special quality that I find in Duke's history and in the University today. It is not easy, especially for a long-winded professorial type, to explain in a few words. But it has to do with the fact that Duke is where it is — in North Carolina and the South— and the kind of institution that Duke has been and is. In the first place, North Carolina has always been in some ways both a quintessential southern state and, at the same time, an unsouthern southern state. Let me mention a few of the southern aspects first. The largest social class in the South before the Civil War, and for several decades after it too, was made up of yeoman farmers — men and women who owned their modest acreage and worked hard to make their livelihoods from it. North Carolina, with relatively few great plantations, was the special home of the small farmers. The individualism and self-reliance that once characterized so much of agrarian America lasted long in North Carolina— and has not, in fact, completely disappeared to this day. On the other hand, the Tar Heel state has never fully conform- ed to certain historic southern norms. There has always been an attractive element of other-mindedness about North Carolina. There have been, for example, more dissenters and exceptions-to- the-rule in North Carolina than in either of her neighboring states, Virginia and South Carolina. Perhaps that other-mindedness furnishes a clue as to why the trustees of struggling little Trinity College, our institutional forebear, picked an audacious, innovative Yankee, John F. Crowell, to become president in 1887. That was a time when so much of the South was still mired in bitter memories of the Civil War and sectional defensiveness, yet Trinity dared to be different. Trinity, in fact, aspired to excellence. Now, aspirations toward excellence are not uncommon among educational institutions. Practically all of them mouth the words, sooner or later. To dream of excellence and to begin to have the money to pay the inevitable costs of it, however, was an experience known to precious few col- leges in the poverty-stricken South of eighty or so years ago. President Crowell and the newfangled, young Ph.D.s he had to recruit for the faculty when Trinity moved to Durham in 1892 not only dreamed of excellence. They found patrons in Washington Duke and his son, Benjamin N. Duke, who gradually began to pay the bills for it. The momentum of the college increased around the turn of the century. The Dukes, rich Republicans in what was then a veritable sea of southern Democrats, preferred a broad national outlook to a sullen sectional one. North Carolina could tolerate such an institution as Trinity even if many in the state did not ex- actly love it, and many, especially Methodists, did love and try to support it. Money from the Duke family allowed Trinity College to enjoy an independence and a critical stance that few other southern educational establishments in the first decades of this century could match. When James B. Duke, Washington Duke's youngest son, prepared to underwrite the organization of a university around Trinity in 1924, the college was ready. An interesting college with a distinctive style and history became, rather gracefully and natural- ly, a university that still strives toward excellence — and still strug- gles to pay the mounting costs of it. So Duke University, like North Carolina, is both southern and unsouthern. On the wooded edge of a medium-sized industrial city, Duke is also on the edge of its own forest of some eight thou- sand acres. As a faculty member myself, I must leave it to others to speak about that component of today's university. But I will ar- bitrarily select a few of Duke's continuing, special attractions for me. As universities go, we are, thank God, still small, and all the evidence suggests that we will remain so. We have a cosmopolitan student body with whom, most of the time at least, it is both pleas- ant and challenging to engage in the learning process. Duke has one of the finest libraries in the country, not just in terms of the size of its holdings and the handsomeness of its facilities but in the friendly helpfulness of its dedicated staff. Five minutes from my office on West Campus, I can be in the Sarah P. Duke Gardens and the peaceful woods around them— and I go there first on most working days, in fact on the way to work. From different spots in those gardens, one can see the Gothic towers of West Campus. The stone is warmly colored and from a nearby hillside and, as Woodrow Wilson put it, we have put \"those lines in our architec- ture which point every man's imagination to historic traditions of learning in the English-speaking race.\" For those reasons as well as the sheer beauty of the buildings, I enjoy living with the Tudor- Gothic style of West. On East Campus, where I liked being officed for more than twenty years in one of the too few buildings that re- main from Trinity days, both the spacious grounds with their magnificent trees and the red-brick Georgian architecture are balms for anyone who will take the time to note his or her surroundings. Trinity and Duke were here long before any of us now in residence came on the scene. They will be here long hence. That fact, in itself, is one of the enduring satisfactions to be derived from being a part of an institution like Duke. By Robert F. Durden A Historical Sketch of Duke University Back in the 1830s, some Quaker and Methodist farmers living in the northwestern pocket of Randolph County, in central North Carolina, decided that \"Ignorance and error are not only the bane of religious but also of civil society.\" In that belief, they founded and nurtured several small schools. Historically, the evolution of Duke University dates from 1838, when Brantley York became the first permanent teacher of one of these, built by farmer John Brown — a crude one-room, log building with wooden chimney and earthen floor. The Reverend York, a self-educated teacher as well as Methodist minister, guided Brown's schoolhouse from its crude beginnings through its transition to Union Institute Academy in 1841. Union Institute, a name suggested by the Reverend York because it reflected the unity of Methodists and Quakers in promoting the educational interests of the community, was quickly accepted by the farmers of Randolph County. Shortly afterward, the Reverend York accepted another teaching position, and Braxton Craven, his assistant at the age of nineteen, was elected principal in 1842. From then until his death in 1882, Braxton Craven's life reflected the development of the academy, Normal College, and then Trinity College. There was a distinctly religious tone at the academy, whose annual enrollment by 1850 was about 105. The 1849 catalogue stated that \"students regularly attend Sabbath school exercises and Divine worship on the Sabbath: their morals are cultivated as well as their minds.\" By 1850, Braxton Craven felt that his second- ary school had reached its maximum growth as an academy. A night school had been opened for students who worked during the day, Union Institute had its own library by 1846, and Craven had recently introduced a course for teacher training. Needing a firm base of financial support in order to expand, he appealed to the state to support the institution as a teacher's college. On January 28, 1851, the North Carolina Legislature chartered the school as Normal College, qualifying its graduates to teach in state schools. It was perhaps the first institution in the South to be chartered especially for the training of teachers. But the legislature's appropriation, as it turned out, provided official recognition only and did not obligate the state to support the college financially. In addition, the idea of a normal school met with criticism, and in some instances, the public seemed dissatisfied with the teachers produced at Normal. In 1856, Braxton Craven turned to the Methodist Episcopal church, South, with a proposal that Normal College should educate future preachers without charge, in return for financial support from the church. The Methodist Conference voted to accept this arrangement in 1856, and three years later, the Randolph County institution became Trinity College, a liberal arts school operating under the auspices of the Methodist church. Two years after Trinity College was established, the Civil War broke out, bringing many changes to the campus. A Military Department was established, and the Trinity Guard was organized to keep as many students in school as possible. With enrollment dwindling in spite of President Craven's efforts, the school was forced to curtail its program, and in 1863 Craven resigned. After William T. Gannaway was named to succeed Craven, the school stayed open until April of 1865 and then it shut down. Trinity was reopened on January 11, 1866, with Braxton Craven unanimously elected to resume the presidency. The quarter-century following the war was a time of slow redevelopment in North Carolina. The rumblings of early in- dustrialization brought some degree of prosperity to a few towns across the state, but Trinity College, isolated in rural Randolph County, remained untouched by this uneven period of economic change. Nevertheless, there were several developments of interest and significance on the campus: the college's first female graduates (1878), the first foreign student (1880), new secret societies, fraternities, and by 1887, a Yankee president. Braxton Craven died in 1882 and the leadership of Trinity Col- lege passed through many hands until 1887, when a new president was named. The trustees' choice was surprisingly liberal in a time when many southerners still harbored bitter sectional memories of the Civil War and Reconstruction. They chose John Franklin Crowell, a twenty-nine-year-old Pennsylvanian and graduate of Yale University, whose twin passions were athletics and high academic standards. When Crowell arrived in North Carolina, a study had just ranked Trinity fourth among the state's four large colleges. The new president began an unrelenting drive to upgrade every aspect of Trinity's life— admissions, curriculum, financial resources, books and equipment, graduation requirements, and athletics. Crowell established Trinity's first football team and coached it himself. In fact, since Crowell introduced the game as Yale had played it (more rushing than kicking, with an oval ball in- stead of the round one used in rugby), Trinity's 16-0 victory over North Carolina on Thanksgiving Day, 1888, is considered the first real game of football ever played in the South. By the end of the century, President Crowell had come to the realization that, in order to benefit from the state's accelerating in- dustrialization, Trinity College would have to move to a larger center of population. Despite outspoken resentment from many alumni and Methodist church officials, Crowell explored possibilities in Greensboro, Raleigh, and Durham, but nowhere could adequate financial assistance be found. Then there was a fortuitous development: Raleigh was chosen as the site for a new Baptist Female College (Meredith College) on the grounds that Durham was \"a factory town ... no fit place for girls.\" This insult provoked the indignation of Durham's leading citizens, especially Washington Duke. Duke reportedly declared that he himself would donate the money needed to help finance the transfer of Trinity College to Durham if President Crowell was interested. Together, they persuaded Julian S. Carr to donate Blackwell Park, a sixty- acre racetrack and fairground on the western edge of Durham, as a site for the college and the move was arranged. The timing to move to Durham in 1892 was not propitious. There was hardly enough money for the college to survive in Ran- dolph County — the expense of the move added to the distress. Faculty salaries went unpaid; students slept in unheated and sometimes unfurnished rooms; and Crowell was still due $1,900 of his $2,000 salary for the preceding year. An overworked, underpaid faculty soon began to resent Crowell's ambitions. Some resigna- tions were submitted. Then, a few trustees began to wonder about Crowell's practical competence. Finally, Crowell left Trinity in mid- 1894, being replaced by Dr. John C. Kilgo. The Panic of 1893 in the United States had worsened the school's dire financial situation. The agricultural South was par- ticularly hard-hit by the nation's economic depression, and the Methodist church's support for Trinity College dropped off sharp- ly. Only a mortgage of all the college's property (arranged through the influence of Benjamin N. Duke) and three $100,000 donations from the Duke family between 1894 and 1900 pulled Trinity out of its morass of financial despair. One of these gifts was offered by Washington Duke in 1896 if Trinity College would agree to admit women on equal terms with men. Dr. Kilgo naturally accepted, praising Duke for his \"prophetic vision.\" In fact, President Kilgo even suggested changing the school's name to Duke College. Dr. William Preston Few succeeded Kilgo as president of Trinity College shortly after the turn of the century and continued to nurture the college's love affair with the Duke family. Trinity's enrollment climbed steadily until 1917, when the United States entered World War I. When enrollment began to drop because of the war, the college accepted a unit of the Student Army Training Corps. Then the 1918 influenza epidemic hit Durham, and condi- tions at the college sank to a new low— just as the war ended in November. Like some other schools following the war, Trinity bounced back with vigor. New courses were added in various fields; a sum- mer program was inaugurated for teacher training; the number of women enrolled increased dramatically; graduate education was expanded; and Dr. Few resumed his campaign to get support for a medical school. Dr. Few also spent a great deal of time talking with the Duke family. Some friends of James B. Duke knew that he wanted to do \"big things for God and humanity,\" but only his very closest con- fidants knew the magnitude of his plans. There was widespread surprise then on December 11, 1924, when Mr. Duke signed the Duke Indenture for a $40,000,000 Endowment. The endowment was designed expressly to benefit hospitals, orphanages, colleges, and the Methodist church in the Carolinas, and to create Duke University as a memorial to J. B. Duke's father. \"I have selected Duke University,\" the Indenture says in part, \"as one of the prin- cipal objects of this trust because I recognize that education, when conducted along sane and practical, as opposed to dogmatic and theoretical, lines, is, next to religion, the greatest civilizing influence.\" James B. Duke died just ten months later, leaving even more funds to the University in his will, including an appropriation of several million dollars for a medical school and hospital at Duke, and adding an additional $40,000,000 to the basic endowment capital. As Trinity College began planning major physical expansion, the land adjoining the existing campus became more expensive. So a large wooded tract, about a mile west, was acquired as the site for the new sections of the University. The Divinity School opened in 1926, followed by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, which was formally inaugurated in the 1926-27 academic year and awarded its first Ph.D. degree in 1929. The School of Law was also reorganized and given its own building. In 1930, the Gothic-style structures of West Campus were occupied as Trinity College (continuing as the University's undergraduate college for men) moved into its new quarters. The older East Campus, refur- bished in its traditional Georgian architecture, became the home of the coordinate Woman's College. The man who led the transformation of Trinity College into Duke University, William Preston Few, died in 1940 after serving for thirty years as president of the institution. To succeed him, the Board of Trustees chose one of his closest associates, Dr. Robert L. Flowers. President Flowers' tenure had only one year of \"nor- mal\" university life. After the United States entered World War II in late 1941, Duke pledged its allegiance to the needs of the nation. Many members of the faculty, administration, and staff were called into military service. Student enrollment dropped. A naval officers training corps, a course in the \"chemistry of explosives,\" and the Navy V-12 program were among innovations which grew out of the University's involvement in the war. From 1945 to 1949, the postwar half of the decade, the situa- tion at Duke was abnormal in the opposite direction. Wartime emergency measures were dropped; a special trimester system was replaced by the more familiar semester system; war-related courses were transformed back to their peacetime counterparts; and enrollment started climbing again. But none of these rever- sions brought normality back to the campus. Enrollment reached normal levels and kept on going up — until the University was struggling with serious logistical problems: how to feed so many students, where to house them, how to provide them with books and equipment, and how to achieve all this without sacrificing quality in the academic program. The answers that Duke found to these questions must have been successful, for by the end of the decade, national publications such as Time magazine were report- ing their favorable impressions of the growing stature and prestige of the twenty-four-year-old southern university. President Flowers retired in 1948, and A. Hollis Edens was elected as his successor. A period of self-analysis and reorganiza- tion was launched to accommodate the vastly changed cir- cumstances in which the University found itself as the 1950s began. The immediate problem facing the administration was that of determining future policy for the University. One obvious conse- quence of this period of evaluation was a greater selectivity of students. With the number of applications growing each year, and the number of acceptances holding relatively steady, higher ad- missions standards followed in course. Of all applicants for admis- sion in 1954, more than half were accepted. By 1959, however, less than one-fourth of those applying could be accepted. The period of the Edens administration was also notable for its fund-raising ef- forts and for developing academic sophistication. Over his eleven- year administration, alumni giving tripled, and University assets in- creased from $59,000,000 to $116,000,000. Academically, the period saw the establishment of such new programs as the Com- monwealth Studies Center, the Center for the Study of Aging, and the World Rule of Law Center. Following an administrative controversy, Dr. Edens resigned in 1960. The trustees then named Dr. Deryl Hart, professor of surgery, as president. Several progressive measures were advanc- ed or completed in President Hart's brief term. One such action raised faculty salaries into top-level pay grades as listed by the American Association of University Professors. Another action amended the University admissions policy to affirm (in President Hart's words) \"Duke's belief in the equality of opportunity for all persons of comparable ability and need, regardless of race, creed, or national origin.\" Both these measures furthered the promise of President Few to make of Duke University \"not a sectional but a national university.\" When Douglas Knight became Duke's president in 1963, he sensed that he was launching an extraordinary period in the University's history. He could not have forseen, however, that it would coincide with an even more dramatic period in the history of American society. For Duke, the period was extraordinary because of the Fifth Decade Development Program. It called for a virtual renewing of the University, including in its ten-year budget more than $100,000,000 in capital improvements— buildings such as the Paul M. Gross Chemical Laboratory, Perkins Library, the main en- trance building for the Medical Center, and the Edens Quadrangle dorm complex. Coinciding with these ambitious plans for the University was an extraordinary period in the history of American society. The na- tionwide student activist movement, which had developed from the first civil rights protests in North Carolina back in early 1960, turned its focus in the last half of the decade towards the escalating war in Vietnam. Frequent demonstrations (not always peaceful) became the rule on campuses across the country. Then almost predictably, students began to turn their frustrations and anger inwards towards the administrations of their own univer- sities. Their demands ranged from initiating black-studies pro- grams to the removal of military training programs from campus. 10 Duke was no exception during this period. In April, 1968, a group of Duke students marched on President Knight's home in support of improved benefits for nonacademic employees. After negotiations failed, they entered the home and refused to leave. Three days later, President Knight was ordered to a hospital for rest, and the students moved their protest to the main quadrangle, calling for a boycott of all classes. The \"Vigil\" lasted until the trustees met in special session to upgrade working conditions for Duke's nonacademic employees. Another major disruption occurred in February, 1969, when black students at Duke occupied Allen Building. Although they left the building before sunset, a general disturbance broke out on the main quad that night between Durham police and a large number of University students. A few weeks later, Douglas Knight resigned as president of the University, one of a long list of presidents of major universities whose resignations coincided with overwhelm- ing waves of student activism across the country. For Dr. Knight's successor, the trustees chose Terry Sanford, who had won nationwide respect as governor of North Carolina from 1961-1965. Governor Sanford had also attracted international attention to the ingenious educational innovations that were launch- ed during his administration. Now he was bringing his political and diplomatic talents into the turbulent arena of Duke University. In May 1970, President Nixon ordered American troops into Cam- bodia and campuses across the country erupted in protest — Duke's included. Terry Sanford had been on campus for only one month at that time. As hundreds of American schools made plans to suspend operations — many for the remainder of the academic year— President Sanford devised effective alternatives of protest for Duke students. These alternatives were accepted by Duke students and were hurriedly copied by a large number of other schools across the country. Other historical developments followed in short order: the merger of the men's and women's undergraduate colleges; the establishment of the University Planning Committee with member- ship to include students, faculty members, administrators, trustees, and alumni; the formulation of a major new fund raising drive to involve the University's Golden Anniversary Year of 1974; the creation of Duke's Institute for Policy Sciences and Public Af- fairs; and the breaking of ground for the new University Center. In keeping with its own remarkable history and that of its prede- cessor, Trinity College, Duke University under President Sanford was already presaging a new era in American higher education. 11 i 1 Although fashions, fads, professors, and courses have changed dramatically in the years since Trinity College became Duke University, certain events in the life of a Duke student have remained constant. The following are excerpts from a University publication entitled Duke Encounters (Elizabeth H. Locke, editor; 1977)— three short essays by former Duke students which demonstrate quite clearly the old adage that \"the more things change, the more they remain the same!\" Duke means quality education with outstanding faculty members who take a personal interest in the whole student— not just his mind. Duke's leadership in the South has helped raise the standard of education at many universities and colleges, as they strive to equal its greatness. This has improved the quality of education available for many more students than can attend Duke. Duke has trained many of our Methodist ministers. I would not like to live in a community where religion does not influence the lives of its citizens, and I feel this educating of our ministers is a great contribution. Duke is a medical center, not only educating great doctors, but also providing quality treatment for the very ill. Research per- formed by the medical center is too often unknown, yet it greatly affects our health. Duke medical center also trains nurses, hospital administrators, pharmacists, and paramedics to serve with knowledge and dedication. Duke is what it is today because many people have supported it. It is this dedicated support that made Trinity College great and that has enabled Duke to grow into a strong and vital university. The opportunity to work with the administration, trustees, alumni, friends, development staff, and to know some of the faculty and students has been a privilege for me and made my efforts and gifts seem far less than I wish I could do for Duke. I wish I could per- sonally thank all for their contributions to Duke. I am proud and grateful to be forever a part of this great university. Edwin L. Jones, Jr. '48 Trustee President J. A. Jones Construction Company 12 Spring fever struck early (about February 1) that year. It was the se- cond term of my junior year, and I was majoring in chemistry. Mid- term exams went badly— I believe I made a \"dog\" (the code word for a grade slightly above failing). Not being an alarmist, I didn't panic and do anything foolish like borrowing someone's notes and starting to study. Rather, I continued to be lethargic in the classroom while working diligently at basketball and on my golf swing. But the basketball season ended prematurely (an early loss in the ACC tourney) and all too soon, beach weekend arrived and departed. Finals were approaching and I, needless to say, was in deep trouble. In an attempt to extricate myself from this predica- ment, and also to garner a few \"brownie points,\" I went to see Dr. Bradsher in the chem building. I asked him what I might do to bet- ter my position going into the final, and he replied: \"John, it mat- ters not to me as far as your grade is concerned, but you could try coming to class.\" I thanked him feebly and slithered out of his of- fice, reminding myself to change deodorants, for this one had surely let me down. Meanwhile, all was not rosy elsewhere. My art history class, for which I had little aptitude, and less interest, was gnawing at me. Somehow I had managed a weak \"hook\" (C) at mid-term, but had forgotten thereafter that I was enrolled in the course. Classes ended early in May, though for me they had ended considerably earlier. Exam schedules were issued, and as luck would have it, both chemistry and art history finals were on the last day — the former at two in the afternoon and the latter at seven in the even- ing. My strategy was to hit the chem hard and let the chips fall where they might in art history. So, for three days I packed my brain with man's total knowledge of organic reactions. I strode out of the exam, head held high, confident that I had \"aced\" it, which in fact, I had. But my joy and relief were short-lived. A mere two hours later I was to face a firing squad of Renaissance artists. I rushed back to the room, picked up that two-pound book and started through it. No chance! I was frozen with fear. What are the alternatives? A \"no-show\" for a certain \"flag\"? I became resigned to disaster. I bummed a ride over to East for the execution, told myself to be a man, and entered the room. I also noted that my new deodorant (the fifth in the last two weeks) wasn't working either. The final was to consist of three hours of slides, projected before us, which we were to identify and comment upon. At precisely seven o'clock, the distinguished professor entered the room — without speaking, he proceeded to the filing cabinet to get the projector. It was locked! Could it be a reprieve? But the pro- fessor merely told us to wait quietly while he got the custodian. About fifteen minutes later he returned and said simply: \"I was not able to locate the custodian. There will be no final examination.\" In that instant I was gone, fast-breaking down the hall, down the stairs, past old \"Wash\" Duke, with a speed that would have made Coach Bubas mighty proud. I was ecstatic and very thankful. Should I go to the chapel to say thanks or to the U. G. (University Grill)? The latter won out. They didn't serve cheeseburgers and Budweiser in the chapel. Jack Marin '66 Professional Basketball Player 13 When I went to Duke it was after much deliberation upon its merits as opposed to those of the alternative merits of Smith. It was the hazy and uninformed deliberation of the last months of high school— so, I went finally to Duke by some choice and a lot of chance. And I listened all fall to people who exclaimed: \"You could have gone to Smith, and you came here? You're crazy.\" For a few melancholy months, I thought they were right. A few months after my graduation from Duke, I came to Chicago, after some deliberation as confused and limited as that of a few summers before, to seek fame and fortune— or at least steady work. And many people exclaimed: \"You could have gone to Europe, and you came to Chicago? New York, Boston, San Fran- cisco, maybe. Chicago — you're crazy.\" I am neither casting aspersions on any of the aforementioned locales, nor setting myself up as a brave, brazen bucker of trends in New England college attendance or postgraduate grand tours. But I have spared myself weeks of self-doubt which I could ill af- ford this fall by thinking of Duke and Chicago in much the same way. People who fancy themselves somehow beaten out of the number one slot do try harder. Harvard and all of New England were there first. And so Duke has labored along under the damningly faint phrase \"the Harvard of the South\" all this time. Duke rests on comparatively new laurels— but only for a second. It seems that Duke is always jump- ing up to justify itself once again. As competitive, brash, and even pushy as that often seemed to me, I now believe that it also fostered an atmosphere of creative trying which seems the best at- mosphere in which to come of age.
