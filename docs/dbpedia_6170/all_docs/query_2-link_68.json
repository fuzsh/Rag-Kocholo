        "text": "AP Credit Policy\n\nAll Advanced Placement Exams completed with a score of 4 or 5 are recorded on a student's permanent Duke record. The classes may be used for placement into higher-level courses and to satisfy departmental major and minor requirements, as allowed by the individual departments. Trinity College of Arts and Sciences students may apply up to 2 of these elective course credits toward the degree requirement of 34 course credits, with up to 6 additional credits awarded for acceleration toward the degree. The Pratt School of Engineering evaluates AP credit as Trinity College does, but students may receive credit and placement for all qualifying classes."
