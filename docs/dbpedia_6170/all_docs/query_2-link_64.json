        "text": "Choosing a college can be difficult for nature lovers because it’s hard to find a school with the perfect balance between academics and outdoor activities you can enjoy. But there are plenty of small colleges for outdoor enthusiasts out there, and we’ve compiled a list of 30 great small schools for nature lovers.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis list of schools was created using information from the National Center for Education Statistics’ College Navigator Database as well as the individual schools’ websites. We started with a list of colleges that have student populations under 10,000. We then used a number of articles about both top schools and cities for nature lovers to narrow down the list. While choosing these schools, we considered: the number of outdoor-oriented sports, clubs and teams; the proximity to outdoor opportunities; the university’s green status; the campus and surrounding area; and the number of nature-focused courses/degree programs. Each school on this list is ranked by the number of points we’ve given it for being nature lover-friendly so that our No. 1 school has the most points and No. 30 has the least.\n\nThe point system works as follows:\n\n1 point for 1-4 outdoor sports teams; 2 points for 5 or more; 3 points for more than 10\n\n1 point for 1-4 outdoor clubs; 2 points for 5 or more; 3 points for more than 10\n\n1 point for 1-4 green initiatives; 2 points for 5 or more; 3 points for more than 10\n\n1 point for being in a city/town where outdoor opportunities are abundant\n\n1 point for 1-4 nature-focused degree programs; 2 points for 5 or more; 3 points for more than 10\n\n30.

Students can also participate in the campus clubs and organizations that take advantage of the school’s location, such as sailing, river rafting and caving.\n\nLewis & Clark is ranked No. 1 by The Princeton Review’s list of “Top 50 Green Colleges.” Students have the option to major or minor in environmental studies.\n\n5. The Evergreen State College\n\nOlympia, WA\n\nPoints Awarded: 10\n\nStudent Population: 4,398\n\nStudent-to-Faculty Ratio: 23 to 1\n\nThe Evergreen State College lives up to its name, landing itself on just about any list you’ll find for top schools for nature lovers. The campus is set on over 1,000 acres of forest next to the Puget Sound, where students can escape the woods for a day at the beach. If the local hiking trails, beaches, bike paths, kayaking, etc. aren’t enough, Olympic National Park is just one hour north. The campus hosts an organic farm that provides food for the cafeteria, buys 100 percent clean power and is trying out electric vehicles.\n\nThe nature-based degree programs, clubs, organizations and sports are abundant. The school even offers reservation-based study programs, which provide students with the opportunity to live and work in tribal communities.\n\n4. Sewanee – The University of the South\n\nSewanee, TN\n\nPoints Awarded: 11\n\nStudent Population: 1,701\n\nStudent-to-Faculty Ratio: 11 to 1\n\nThe University of the South’s campus consists of 13,000 acres on the Cumberland Plateau, which “invites students to engage in both a multitude of outdoor activities and careful study of the natural environment.” About 1,000 acres of the campus—known as the “Domain” or “Mountain”—are actually developed. The rest of the land consists of coves, old growth forests, look-out points and caves. Students can hike the 20-mile perimeter trail that circles campus, or explore off-campus through the Sewanee Outing Program’s hundreds of guided trips year round.\n\nWhile many of the classes on campus take time to have class outside on nicer days, majors like environmental studies, natural resources, ecology and biodiversity, forestry and geology offer much more outdoor learning experiences. If you’re not interested in getting involved in an outdoor sporting activity, the University Farm offers other opportunities to spend your time outside productively.\n\n3. Bowdoin College\n\nBrunswick, ME\n\nPoints Awarded: 11\n\nStudent Population: 1,795\n\nStudent-to-Faculty Ratio: 9 to 1\n\nAlthough Bowdoin College’s main campus consists of 215 beautiful acres in Brunswick, Maine, students in the oceanographic program can work eight miles away at the Coastal Studies Center on Orr’s Island. And non-oceanographic students are given the opportunity to spend time outdoors because many of the college’s classes involve working in the field.\n\nBowdoin also hosts a large variety of outdoor clubs, including the school’s Outing Club, which takes students on more than 100 excursions a year near and away from campus. White water rafting, climbing and hiking on the Appalachian Trail are just a few examples of nearby outdoor excursions. Hamilton Audubon Sanctuary and Bradbury Mountain State Park are also close enough to campus for students to enjoy inland and coastal sites.\n\n2. Berry College\n\nMount Berry, GA\n\nPoints Awarded: 11\n\nStudent Population: 2,223\n\nStudent-to-Faculty Ratio: 12 to 1\n\nBerry College’s campus is the world’s largest at 27,000 acres, 16,000 of which are a Wildlife Management Area. Within that space, students have access to over 40 miles of trails for hiking, biking and horseback riding. The entire campus is considered an outdoor classroom and research laboratory to the School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences. According to the school’s webpage, “Berry has begun to establish itself as a world-class destination for studying the environmental sciences.”\n\nThe Berry Outdoor Leadership Development Program (BOLD) is an arm of the school’s Office of Student Affairs, which offers activities and classes like mountain biking, rock climbing, ropes courses, whitewater sports, cave leaderships and training in safety, leadership and first aid.\n\nIf this massive, nature-filled campus isn’t enough, students can get to Johns Mountain Wildlife Management Area, Little River Canyon National Preserve, Talladega National Forest, and the Chattahoochee National Forest in a short drive.\n\n1. Humboldt State University\n\nArcata, CA\n\nPoints Awarded: 12\n\nStudent Population: 8,293\n\nStudent-to-Faculty Ratio: 21 to 1\n\nHumboldt State University offers a Marine Lab, an on-campus fishery and one of the most diverse greenhouses in California. Students only have to travel a few minutes away from campus to access the Redwood National Forest, the NorCal coast beaches and mountains to climb and hike. Organizations within the university provide opportunities for students to ski, rock climb, surf and participate in many other outdoor sports, such as logging.\n\nThe school’s programs in natural resources and sciences are nationally-known, and according to the school’s website, “students find a long-standing commitment to social and environmental responsibility” throughout the curriculum. The nature-related education opportunities are endless and include certifications in swiftwater rescue, wilderness first response and wildfire management, as well as the chance to study with the world’s foremost expert on redwood trees and leading experts in sustainable energy systems. Some of Humboldt’s recent rankings include a top “Green College” by the Princeton Review and a “Top Vegan-Friendly School” by PETA."
