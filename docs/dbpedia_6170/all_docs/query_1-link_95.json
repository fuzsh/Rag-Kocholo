        "text": "April 8, 2024\n\nOne might expect to find only large research universities on a list of best colleges for chemistry majors, yet this is far from the case. While many big schools boast high-end laboratories and instructors, access to both can be limited for undergraduates, as graduate students often get first dibs. At many of the liberal arts schools listed below, such as Pomona, Bates, Haverford, and Carleton, the main focus is on teaching undergraduates and thus it is freshman chemistry students occupying the premier lab space, not doctoral students. All of the institutions on our list produce well-trained chemists who are welcomed by employers and top Master’s and Ph.D. programs alike.\n\nAs you work toward your bachelor’s degree in chemistry you’ll take coursework in general chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, calculus, physics, and more.\n\nMethodology\n\nClick here to read our methodology for the Best Colleges for Chemistry.\n\nBest Colleges for Chemistry\n\nHere’s a quick preview of the first chemistry institutions that made our list. Detailed profiles and stats can be found when you scroll below.\n\n1) Harvard University\n\n2) University of Chicago\n\n3) Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n4) California Institute of Technology\n\n5) Yale University\n\n6) Duke University\n\n7) Washington University in St. Louis\n\n8) Princeton University\n\n9) Rice University\n\n10) Emory University\n\nAll of the schools profiled below have stellar reputations in the field of chemistry and commit substantial resources to undergraduate education.

Even with a graduate population of over 14,000 to cater to, undergraduate class sizes still tend to be small, with 42% of sections having single-digit enrollments and 71% being capped at nineteen. Economics, government, and computer science are the three most popular areas of concentration at Harvard. Biology, chemistry, physics, math, statistics, sociology, history, English, and psychology all sit atop most departmental ranking lists.\n\nProfessional Outcomes: The Crimson Class of 2022 saw 15% of students head directly into graduate/professional school. Of the graduates entering the world of work (virtually everyone else), 58% were entering either the consulting, finance, or technology field. Over 1,000 Harvard alumni presently work for Google and over 500 for Microsoft, McKinsey & Company, and Goldman Sachs. Turning our attention to those moving on to graduate school, Harvard grads with at least a 3.5 GPA typically enjoy acceptance rates into medical school of 90% or greater.\n\nEnrollment: 7,240\n\nCost of Attendance: $79,450\n\nMedian SAT: 1550\n\nMedian ACT: 35\n\nAcceptance Rate: 3%\n\nRetention Rate: 98%\n\nGraduation Rate: 98%\n\n#2 Best College for Chemistry\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nChicago, IL\n\nAcademic Highlights: There are 53 majors at UChicago, but close to half of all degrees conferred are in four majors: economics, biology, mathematics, and political science, all of which have particularly sterling reputations.
