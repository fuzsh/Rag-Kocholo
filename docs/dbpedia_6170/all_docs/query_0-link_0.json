Earlier figures are taken from bulletins and other sources as available. Due to differences in accounting methods, figures prior to 1990 are not always comparable with the figures for later years.\n\nThe tuition figure is for first-year students in Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and does not include room, board and fees. Tuition in the graduate and professional schools varies.\n\nThe figures for faculty and students are full-time equivalent (FTE) figures for the fall semester.\n\nFor financial data since 2002, see past financial reports at Year in Review and the current financial report.\n\nThe value given for the endowment is the market value at the time the annual report is released. The figure does not include the value of funds held by other parties (e.g., The Duke Endowment)."
