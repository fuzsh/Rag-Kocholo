        "text": "Students at Duke pay on a sliding scale based on their financial circumstances. Over half of our students pay far less than the total cost of attendance, with 21% of our first-year class attending tuition-free in the last year. You can read below to find the cost before your aid is applied, but the most important thing is how much Duke is likely to cost you after our assistance. You can receive an estimate of your cost with aid here."
