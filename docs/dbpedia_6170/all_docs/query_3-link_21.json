        "text": "Exceptional academics, enviable spirit, and supportive community: there's no school like Duke.\n\nEndowed in 1924, we're a student-driven university with the ambition and audacity to make a global impact. We're Cameron Crazies and ballet dancers. We're lemur researchers and social entrepreneurs. We're hospital caregivers and public policymakers. We're Nobel laureates and National Champions.\n\nWith more than 50 majors, Duke will provide you with limitless intellectual opportunities to develop your mind through programs like Bass Connections and Focus.\n\nOn top of all the possibilities on campus, Duke is located in one of America's most dynamic areas: the city of Durham, in North Carolina's Research Triangle region. There are a million things to love on our home turf, from the fantastic food, to the arts, to technology.\n\nThe more you dig into what we're about, the more you'll find that this is one of the world's most responsive, engaging, and supportive universities."
