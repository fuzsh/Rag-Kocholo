        "text": "Overview of Duke University\n\nDuke’s Carnegie classification in doctoral universities shows a “very high research activity” classification. It is also affiliated with the United Methodist Church. There is a divinity school on campus, allowing students who want to go into ministry to earn their degrees.\n\nAdvanced placement credits are accepted from any students who have passed AP exams. Duke University holds an institutional accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges (it has been accredited since January 1st, 1895). Duke also holds programmatic accreditations for several degree programs, such as nursing, psychology, physical therapy, and theology.\n\nDuke Tuition Cost & Financial Aid\n\nDuke University costs money to attend‚ $58,031 for a recent academic year. Students who wish to attend Duke will likely need to apply for financial aid. The average net price is the amount of tuition, fees, and books that remains to be paid by the student or their family once their financial aid package has been applied to the original cost. In one recent academic year this was $19,785.\n\nBy income, the net price varies as follows:\n\nFamilies earning up to $30,000 pay nothing\n\nFamilies earning between $30,001 and $48,000 pay nothing\n\nFamilies earning between $48,001 and $75,000 pay $3,398\n\nFamilies earning between $75,001 and $110,000 pay $14,925\n\nFamilies earning more than $110,001 pay $45,529\n\nAverage net price 2017-2018 Net Price $19,785 Average Total Aid $52,681 Students Receiving Financial Aid 66% Room & Board $15,588\n\nAcademics\n\nThe student to faculty ratio is a comfortable 6 to 1, giving both students and professors ample time to meet with each other on class-related issues. The retention rate for first-time students is 98%; this is the rate at which freshmen return for their second year of school.\n\nThe 4-year graduation rate is 87% and the 6-year graduation rate is noticeably higher at 96%, this is not necessarily a bad thing, but evidence that their degree programs may be challenging enough that students need two extra years to complete them.\n\nThe overall student body population numbers almost exactly 16,600. Undergraduates make up 40% with 6,600+ students and graduate students make up the remaining 60%, with 9,900+ students enrolled. Evening classes are not offered for students who can’t take classes during the day. However, online classes are offered, allowing non-traditional or working students a flexible way to earn their degree.\n\nThe most popular degree programs are biological and biomedical sciences; business, management, marketing and related support services; computer and information sciences and support services; and engineering technology and engineering-related fields.\n\nOutcome & Salary\n\nStudents whose families earn less than $75,000 really reap the benefits of a Duke University education. The average salary for a Duke graduate is $84,000, their early-career salary is $73,500, and their mid-career salary is $146,600. Their 10-year salary earnings potential is $840,000 and their 20-year salary earnings potential is up to $2,306,000. Even knowing that the cost of education each academic year is $79,140, students should still be able to realize a return on investment (ROI) when they gain employment that pays handsomely. Their 10-year projected ROI is $760,860 and their 20-year ROI is $2,226,860.\n\nHigh school graduates’ national average salary is $38,792. Their 10-year projected income is $387,920 and their 20-year projected income is $775,840.\n\nGraduates Salary College Grads Early Career Salary $73,500 College Grads Average Salary $84,000 College Grads Mid Career Salary $146,600\n\nReturn on Investment (ROI) 10 Year Salary Earnings Potential $840,000 20 Year Salary Earnings Potential $2,306,000 Cost of Education (Net Price) 4 Year $79,140 10 Year Projected ROI $760,860 20 Year Projected ROI $2,226,860\n\nNo College Education Salary Comparison National Average Salary $38,792 10 Year Projected Income $387,920 20 Year Projected Income $775,840"
