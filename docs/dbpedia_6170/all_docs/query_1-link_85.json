        "text": "Founded by David Kraehenbuehl at Yale University in 1957, the Journal of Music Theory is the oldest music-theory journal published in the United States and has been a cornerstone in music theory’s emergence as a research field in North America since the 1960s. The journal is edited by a consortium of music-theory faculty at Yale, where it is housed in the Department of Music.\n\nThe Journal of Music Theory fosters conceptual and technical innovations in abstract, systematic musical thought and cultivates the historical study of musical concepts and compositional techniques. The journal publishes research with important and broad applications in the analysis of music and the history of music theory as well as theoretical or metatheoretical work that engages and stimulates ongoing discourse in the field. While remaining true to its original structuralist outlook, the journal also addresses the influences of philosophy, mathematics, computer science, cognitive sciences, and anthropology on music theory.\n\nJMT welcomes submissions in all areas of music theory. Our mission is to present music-theoretical research that has significant applications in the analysis of music or the history of music theory or that engages issues in the broader domain of music scholarship.\n\nSubmission. Upload submissions to the journal's online peer-review site at at https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/dup-jmt.\n\nSize. We prefer pieces of moderate length: 5,000–10,000 words, including notes.\n\nSpacing. Double-space the entire text, notes, and references.\n\nCitations. JMT uses in-text parenthetical citations, following the author-date style of reference detailed in The Chicago Manual of Style, seventeenth edition, and the JMT style sheet.\n\nGraphics. Position all graphic supplements as part of the running text, and refer to them as \"examples,\" numbered serially.\n\nAnonymity. Authors are responsible for ensuring blind review by not identifying themselves in their manuscripts. When referring to your own work in a way that might betray your identity, replace your name, and any other obvious clues to identity, with an anonymous placeholder such as \"Author.\" The author's name and contact information will not be circulated to readers.\n\nReview process. All submissions are reviewed anonymously by qualified researchers. The adjudication process, from receipt to initial decision, typically ranges from three to six months, with an average of four months.\n\nManuscript submission for accepted articles. Special typefaces, mathematical type, or in-text graphics must be prepared in consultation with the editor. Matters of style are referred to The Chicago Manual of Style, seventeenth edition, as modified by our style sheet, which governs musical terms and specifies our citation style.\n\nCopyright issues. JMT requires that authors assign their copyright to the journal once an article has been accepted. We cannot consider articles that are under review with other publications or publishers in any form, nor will we grant permission to reprint an article in a book within a year of publication in JMT. Authors are responsible for securing permission for reprinting copyrighted material quoted or otherwise used in their work.\n\nAll inquiries about JMT's content and editorial policies may be made to the managing editor at daniel.cox@yale.edu."
