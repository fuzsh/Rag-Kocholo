        "text": "The Duke University School of Medicine offers a variety of health professions and graduate degree programs. These include the Doctor of Medicine program, recognized nationally for its unique patient-centered curriculum; the nation’s first Physician Assistant program; Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy doctorates; 16 biomedical PhD programs; an innovative Master of Biomedical Sciences, and numerous other master’s degree programs. The School of Medicine also is home to the Medical Scientist Training program which allows students to combine an MD degree with a PhD in the biomedical sciences in partnership with The Graduate School. Duke's Graduate Medical Education includes more than 160 residency and fellowship programs and more than 1,000 trainees.

Our capacity for innovation stems from knitting together our existing strengths in fundamental basic science and deepening our growing translational capabilities, our integration with Duke’s nationally recognized clinical enterprise, Duke University Health System, and our unique scale and depth in clinical research. The combined efforts of the school’s basic and clinical faculty members in departments, centers, and institutes make Duke one of the largest biomedical research enterprises in the country with $1 billion in sponsored research expenditures annually.\n\nAbout Research\n\nPatient care is an integral part of what makes Duke University School of Medicine a hub for pioneering research and innovation. Every day, our investigators, clinicians, and staff work together to translate research findings from the bench to the bedside, and to learn from patients as we improve their care. This collaborative spirit fuels the translation of scientific discoveries to improve human health locally and around the globe. Duke University School of Medicine, Duke University School of Nursing, and Duke University Health System, comprise Duke Health, a world-class academic health care and research center. The Health System advances Duke Health's clinical mission by delivering care across three hospitals — Duke University Hospital, Duke Regional Hospital, and Duke Raleigh Hospital — and outpatient services including Duke Primary Care and Duke Health Integrated Practices, Duke HomeCare & Hospice, Duke Health and Wellness, and multiple affiliations.\n\nAbout Patient Care\n\nFaculty Memberships\n\n(Faculty with a primary or secondary appointment in the School of Medicine)\n\n2 Nobel Laureates\n\n15 American Academy of Arts and Sciences\n\n49 American Association for the Advancement of Science\n\n73 American Society for Clinical Investigation\n\n48 Association of American Physicians\n\n1 Howard Hughes Freeman Hrabowski Scholar\n\n4 Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators\n\n25 National Academy of Medicine\n\n14 National Academy of Sciences\n\n174 Faculty holding distinguished professorships\n\nData as of August 2023\n\nFaculty Resources\n\nDuke University School of Medicine works to attract and retain a diverse cadre of talent who positively impact how we teach, learn, and serve in an increasingly diverse world. The school is committed to enhancing racial diversity and equity, inclusion, and respect for our faculty, staff, trainees, and students.\n\nWhile there is still significant work to be done, the school wants to acknowledge where progress has been made. Furthermore, the School of Medicine knows that representation alone is not the full story and will continue to promote and ensure an equitable and inclusive environment across the Duke community.\n\nDuke University is internationally recognized as a leader in global health research, education, and capacity building. The Duke Global Health Institute (DGHI), brings together knowledge and resources from across the university to address today’s most important global health issues. Faculty, staff, and students are engaged in collaborative research with partners in 60 countries, as well as Durham and other communities in the United States, to improve access to health care and address disparities in health outcomes. DGHI researchers are at the forefront of work to identify emerging infectious diseases and new pandemic threats, as well as cutting-edge research addressing the global rise in non-communicable diseases, access to mental health, and the health impacts of climate and environmental change.\n\nDuke Global Health Institute\n\nPhilanthropic support is critical to the Duke University School of Medicine’s success in carrying out its core missions of research, education, patient care, and community partnership. Outright gifts, endowments, and investment income constitute nearly 20 percent of the school’s annual revenue, helping to meet key needs across the institution: scholarships and financial aid that help students afford the cost of attendance, endowed professorships that help Duke recruit and retain outstanding faculty; innovative research; and new buildings, facilities, and infrastructure.\n\nIn FY23, a record of nine new professorships were launched across several disciplines. Philanthropic support for endowed professorships is among the most lasting and meaningful investments that can be made in the School of Medicine. We aim to be the destination of choice for the nation’s most talented leaders and promising young faculty in biomedical sciences, and named professorships are perhaps the most valuable tool for the recruitment and retention of these high caliber individuals. They provide the brightest minds with the dedicated support needed to achieve boundary-pushing science, care for our patients and the community, and educate and train the next generation of leaders."
