        "text": "Academics\n\nFaculty\n\nFuqua employs nearly 150 full-time faculty members across eight academic areas of concentration. The areas are accounting, business administration, decision sciences, economics, finance, health sector management, management and organization, marketing, operations management, and strategy. Fuqua faculty contribute to the research agendas of the school’s centers, which include the Fuqua/Coach K Center on Leadership and Ethics (COLE), the Center for the Advancement of Social Entrepreneurship (CASE), Duke Innovation & Entrepreneurship (I&E), the Center for Energy, Development and Global Environment (EDGE) and Health Sector Management (HSM).\n\nCurriculum\n\nThe school’s guiding concept is “Team Fuqua,” and the academic environment of the MBA program certainly mirrors this cooperative, team-based mentality. Fuqua’s MBA classes of close to 400 students are divided into six sections, and students are further placed into learning teams of four to five peers. These study groups are changed up mid-year, all the while working together to complete assignments throughout the core curriculum.\n\nFuqua’s pre-term and orientation schedule begins in July. An optional Business, Communications and Culture Program is offered in early to mid-July, and MBA students in the Health Sector Management program take a weeklong, for-credit class in July that has become known as HSM Bootcamp. A mandatory orientation period takes place over three days at the end of July. Classes commence the following week for first-year students with an intense month of orientation and immersion in a rigorous, hands-on program of three courses that emphasize leading and managing in an uncertain world. Second-year students begin classes at the conclusion of the mandatory program, or sometime near the beginning of September.\n\nFuqua’s schedule is organized into four six-week terms per year, and classes do not meet on Wednesdays in order to provide students with a mid-week break. Full-time MBA students must earn a minimum of 79 credits to graduate, at least 41 of which are earned through electives, and maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher. In addition to completing 38 core credits, which can be earned through electives should students earn exemptions from core courses, students must complete an Applied Learning Requirement, which consists of an internship over the course of at least six weeks in a business that aligns with a student’s sector and function interests. Fourteen courses comprise the core and, along with at least four electives, round out students’ first year at Fuqua. The means to core exemptions vary by course, though many can be earned based on a student’s undergraduate coursework or results on exams offered by Fuqua in July and August.\n\nStudents may also opt to focus their studies by undertaking up to two academic concentrations within 14 fields of study. Each concentration is comprised of six courses in total. Fuqua further offers two certificate programs: the Certificate of Academic Excellence in Finance, and the Health Sector Management Certificate. In addition, second-year students can take their studies abroad through a variety of international study options. Fuqua’s Outgoing Exchange Programs (OEPs), for instance, can vary in length from a single short program to an entire semester or summer break. Meanwhile, Integrated Global Academic Travel Experience (GATE) courses give students the chance to spend six weeks studying a country or region in a three-credit elective course before traveling to that location for 12 days.\n\nOther MBA Degree Options\n\nFuqua’s 22-month full-time MBA is the longest of its four programs, tied with its 22-month Weekend Executive MBA that uses Durham residencies and hybrid learning to help executives earn their management degrees on the weekends. The Global Executive MBA program is slightly shorter at 21 months, and employs international residencies and distance learning to meet the needs of currently working professionals and executives. Fuqua’s newest offering is the 10-month Accelerated Daytime MBA, designed for students who have already earned their master’s degree in management and thus skip the business fundamentals. Fuqua also provides four dual degree options for full-time MBA students through other schools at Duke University and one dual degree in partnership with Seoul National University.\n\nConcentrations at Fuqua\n\nDecision Sciences\n\nDiversity, Equity, & Inclusion\n\nEnergy & Environment\n\nEnergy Finance\n\nEntrepreneurship & Innovation\n\nFinance\n\nFinancial Analysis / Accounting\n\nFin Tech (Financial Technology)\n\nLeadership & Ethics\n\nManagement\n\nMarketing\n\nOperations Management\n\nSocial Entrepreneurship\n\nStrategy\n\nCertificates at Fuqua\n\nFinance\n\nHealth Sector Management\n\nTrack Offering at Fuqua\n\nManagement Science and Technology Management (MSTeM)\n\nDegree Offerings at Fuqua\n\nFull-time MBA Programs\n\nDaytime, Health Sector Management\n\nhttp://www.fuqua.duke.edu/programs/daytime-mba/\n\nDual Degree Programs\n\nDoctor of Medicine, Juris Doctor, Master of Environmental Management, Master of Forestry, Master of Public Policy\n\nhttps://www.fuqua.duke.edu/programs/daytime-mba/dual-degrees\n\nExecutive MBA\n\nGlobal Executive, Weekend\n\nhttps://www.fuqua.duke.edu/programs/global-executive-mba\n\nhttps://www.fuqua.duke.edu/programs/weekend-executive-mba\n\nCampus Life\n\nClubs, Conferences & Competitions\n\nMBA students matriculating at Fuqua have over 60 student organizations and clubs to choose from and are encouraged to create organizations that match their interests. The Duke MBA Association, or MBAA, is the student governing body for these organizations. Fuqua offers activity, professional and diversity clubs, such as the MBA Energy Club, the Marketing Club and the Asian Business Club. In addition, many students and faculty, staff and community members meet informally at the student center each Friday for food and conversation at “Fuqua Fridays.”\n\nFuqua’s student clubs sponsor many conferences and events, ranging from the lauded Heath Care Conference—Fuqua’s largest conference—to the MBA Games, which have engaged top business schools in charitable competitions and supported Special Olympics North Carolina for over 20 years. Hosted by the Black and Latino MBA Organization or BLMBAO, the yearly BLMBAO Leadership Conference addresses topics of business leadership through panels and discussions. Meanwhile, Entrepreneurship at Fuqua, the VC Investment Competition and Entrepreneurship through Acquisition Conference offer perspectives on developments in VC and entrepreneurship.\n\nCampus Spaces\n\nFuqua lies within the West Campus of Duke University. The cornerstone of Fuqua’s campus is the Fox Student Center, which joins the main wings of the school while also providing spaces such as dining centers and an indoor winter event space. Fuqua’s most recently constructed building is Breeden Hall, which opened its doors in 2008 and includes class and meeting rooms as well as the Ford Library and MBA admissions offices. The school does not offer on-campus graduate housing options. Most MBA students live in the greater Durham area, and those accepted to Fuqua can access Duke’s Community Housing Office for guidance in securing accommodations.\n\nMBA Careers\n\nCareer Services\n\nFuqua’s Career Management Center serves students and alumni through a variety of career resources, including on-campus, regional and virtual workshops as well as on-campus recruiting options. Many of the staff members at the center specialize in different regions, functions and industries and also in advising students of Fuqua’s different MBA programs. The online Recruit@Duke service allows recruiters to directly post openings for Fuqua students in a centralized database of upcoming events and job fairs, employer profiles and more. Fuqua students can also contribute to a Résumé Book compiled by the Career Management Center. On-campus interviews for second-year students formally begin in early October, though networking nights and corporate presentations begin in mid-September.\n\nCareer Statistics\n\nOf the 442 graduates in the Class of 2023, 389 were seeking employment. Of those seeking employment, 93% had received job offers within three months of commencement, and 92% had accepted offers by then. The median reported salary was $175,000 with a median signing bonus of $30,000. By industry, consulting was the top draw for 2023 Fuqua graduates; 43% of the class entered the industry.

Twenty-one percent of Class of 2023 graduates positions in the Northeast U.S. The West drew 20% of graduates, and the South region hired 18%.
