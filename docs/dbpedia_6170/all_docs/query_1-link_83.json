        "text": "about me\n\nI am a Professor of Computer Science at Duke University. Before coming to Duke in 2013, I spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher in the theory group at Microsoft Research Redmond, where I did research in algorithms. In 2012, I obtained my PhD in theoretical computer science at MIT under the supervision of Prof. David Karger by defending this. Before coming to MIT, I worked at Bell Labs in Bangalore for a year, where I did research on algorithms and networks. I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science and Engineering at Jadavpur University, Kolkata in 2004 and IISc, Bangalore in 2006 respectively. At IISc, I did research in algorithms under the supervision of Prof. Ramesh Hariharan. A long time ago, I grew up in the industrial town of Durgapur where I went to St. Xavier's School.\n\nMy CV is available here.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nI am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, particularly in the design and analysis of algorithms. My two main research thrusts are graph algorithms and algorithms under uncertainty. In graph algorithms, I am interested in the study of network flows, graph cuts, and connectivity. Some recent highlights include the fastest deterministic algorithm to find a minimum cut of an undirected graph, the fastest (randomized) algorithms for finding a minimum vertex cut and a minimum cut of a directed graph, and the fastest algorithm for finding the connectivity of all pairs of vertices in an undirected graph. In algorithms under uncertainty, I am interested in both classical online algorithms, and also the design of algorithms that leverage machine learning to overcome worst-case performance barriers. Some recent highlights include new LP relaxations and algorithms for $k$-server and caching problems, and learning-augmented algorithms for fundamental online problems such as weighted caching and ski rental. I also work in approximation algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and algorithmic game theory.\n\nIn addition to theoretical research, I am also interested in the design of algorithms for practical problems. This includes algorithms for online search, advertising, social networks, and e-commerce, the design and management of computer networks, database management and query processing algorithms, and algorithms with applications in artificial intelligence. I have collaborated with researchers in these areas to design algorithms that are practical, implementable, and scalable. Most of this work has been published in peer-reviewed venues in the application areas, and some of it has led to patents and deployment in prototypes or products.\n\nFor a sample of my current research directions, see here.\n\nI am part of the theory group and am also affiliated/collaborate with the CS-econ, AI/ML, and database groups at Duke.\n\nA complete list of my publications (along with download links to papers) is available here (arranged chronologically) and here (arranged by topic). You can also download my PhD thesis here."
