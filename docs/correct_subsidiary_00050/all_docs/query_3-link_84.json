        "text": "Hydropower has been in use since the earliest human civilizations. Moving water contains energy that is easily harnessed by even simple technology. The amount of available energy is determined by the quantity and flow or fall of water. Swiftly flowing water in a big river, like the Columbia, carries a great deal of energy.\n\nHydropower operations typically involve water flowing through a pipe, or penstock, before pushing against and turning turbine blades connected to an electric generator.\n\nIn a “run-of-the-river system,” the force of the current applies pressure to spin a turbine-generator and make electricity. In a storage system, water is accumulated in reservoirs created by dams, then released as needed. The force of the water created by water pressure and gravity provides the energy to make electricity.\n\nAdvantages to hydroelectric power:\n\nFuel is not burned, so there is minimal pollution\n\nWater is a natural, renewable resource\n\nReduced greenhouse gas emissions\n\nRelatively low operations and maintenance costs\n\nTechnology is reliable and proven\n\nThe development of long-distance power transmission was a boon to hydropower development since most large hydropower operations are located on major bodies of water distant from the populations needing the electricity.\n\nLearn more:\n\nPackwood Hydroelectric Project"
