The surge in demand will be driven by robust economic growth, intense heatwaves, and increasing adoption of electric technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps. According to the IEA’s latest Electricity Mid-Year Update, solar PV is set to play a pivotal role, meeting half of the demand increase. Global electricity demand is projected to grow by around 4% in 2024, up from 2.5% in 2023, marking the highest annual growth rate since 2007, excluding rebounds following the global financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic, while this strong growth is expected to continue into 2025, with another 4% increase anticipated. “Growth in global electricity demand this year and next is set to be among the fastest in the past two decades, highlighting the growing role of electricity in our economies as well as the impacts of severe heatwaves,” said Keisuke Sadamori, IEA Director of Energy Markets and Security. “It’s encouraging to see clean energy’s share of the electricity mix continuing to rise, but this needs to happen at a much faster rate to meet international energy and climate goals. At the same time, it’s crucial to expand and reinforce grids to provide citizens with secure and reliable electricity supply – and to implement higher energy efficiency standards to reduce the impacts of increased cooling demand on power systems.” Renewable energy sources are expanding rapidly, with their share of global electricity supply forecasted to rise from 30% in 2023 to 35% in 2025. By 2025, electricity generated from renewables is expected to surpass coal for the first time. Solar PV alone is predicted to meet roughly half of the growth in electricity demand over the next two years, with solar and wind combined covering up to three-quarters of the increase. #cleanenergy\n\nUrtė Karklienė, Sustainability Manager at Oxylabs.io, wrote an article for Clean Energy Pipeline in which she outlines how data is helping businesses to build actionable ESG strategies. \"Businesses around the world are shifting their focus to sustainability, with an increasing number of companies investing resources to integrate ESG approaches into their daily business operations,\" writes Karkliene. \"For most companies, the shift is strategic rather than altruistic — today, important stakeholders, such as consumers, regulators, investors, and employees, expect companies to take an active role in promoting sustainable activities and mindset. \"However, a lot of companies still run into challenges when integrating sustainability practices into their daily operations. According to a KPMG report, sustainability-related data collection is among the most pressing issues for companies since they need complex data not only to report on their activities and the entire supply chain but also to build future strategies for addressing sustainability issues. \"At Oxylabs, we faced the challenge directly when accounting for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions in our latest Impact Report.\" The full article is available to read at Clean Energy Pipeline. #cleanenergy\n\nIntersect Power has closed two deals amounting to $837 million in financing commitments for the construction and operation of three standalone Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in Texas.
