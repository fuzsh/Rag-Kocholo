        "text": "Water as a scarce resource: solutions for a responsible use\n\nAs the world’s population continues to grow, so does water consumption. However, the growing demand is countered by a worsening water scarcity. Therefore, it will become increasingly important in the future to use this scarce resource responsibly. Wastewater from industry and agriculture must be treated so that it can be reused afterwards.\n\nWe support our customers in overcoming these challenges with reliable, innovative automation solutions. From water procurement and industrial water treatment to consumption measurement and the reuse of industrial water – we look at the complete water cycle to ensure that the greatest possible amount of our planet’s most valuable resource will continue to be available in the future.\n\nOur solutions, consisting of hardware and software, offer you the possibility to operate your plants in the best possible way in terms of Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)."
