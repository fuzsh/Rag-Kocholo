        "text": "After a comprehensive pitch process, Dig has been awarded the Tango Energy and Pacific Hydro Australia creative account.\n\nPacific Hydro Australia has generated 100% renewable energy for 30 years, and is recognized as a pioneer and a leader in the development and generation of renewable energy in the Australian market. Tango Energy, the retail arm of Pacific Hydro Australia, has 150,000 customers and is Australia’s fastest growing energy retailer.\n\nSays Matt Keen, COO/partner at Dig: “We are thrilled to be working with Tango Energy and Pacific Hydro Australia. There are strong synergies between both our businesses and culture, driven by a challenger mindset. As a pioneer of clean energy, their ability to offer 100% renewable energy, rather than just talk about it, is exciting and meaningful. We look forward to a successful partnership.”\n\nSays John Ballenger, general manager retail at Pacific Hydro Australia: “We are really excited to work with the team at Dig. We are committed to help lead the Australian transition to a clean energy future, and Dig clearly demonstrated their strategic and creative capability to help us both tell the story of our 30-year 100% renewable history and, more importantly, the changes that we will lead into the future.”\n\nThis latest win continues the momentum for Dig after recently being awarded the Mitre 10 creative business.\n\nDig commences work for Tango and Pacific Hydro Australia immediately."
