        "text": "The two hydro power plants La Confluencia and La Higuera are located in the central area of the country and are operated through a joint venture with the Australian company Pacific Hydro.\n\nIn 2015, we acquired Compañía Pilmaiquen Electric with projects and operations in the Pilmaiquen River basin, on the border of the Los Lagos and Los Ríos regions, in southern Chile. Statkraft operates the Rucatayo run-of-river power plant and is currently also constructing the Los Lagos hydropower project.\n\nThe Osorno project is not under construction. Statkraft Chile publicly announced its withdrawal from the Osorno project in January 2023, and in September of the same year, the Environmental Assessment Service (SEA) of Chile confirmed the company's resignation, which implies that the project will not be able to be executed. In addition to the resignation, Statkraft Chile restored the water rights associated with the project to the State of Chile.\n\nWe are promoting the development of wind power in Chile with the development of three wind farms accounting for more than 100 MW in the central area of the country. The operation of the three wind farms will contribute to a reduction of 100,000 tons of CO2 annually."
