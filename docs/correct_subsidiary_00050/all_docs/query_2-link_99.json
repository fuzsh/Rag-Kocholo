        "text": "Apart from playing poker with the Spaniards over the listed Pacific Hydro, Garry Arthur Weaven is also presiding over some smaller matters, such as dropping a writ for more than $10 million into AMP's lap.\n\nThe Weaven associated Industry Funds Management (Nominees) infrastructure funds group has wheeled in Arnold Bloch Leibler to issue proceedings against two AMP companies.\n\nIFM made a string of allegations, including that AMP Investment Services did not act honestly and in good faith and that it placed itself in a position where its duties to investors such as IFM conflicted with its own interests.\n\nThe IFM writ claimed breaches of trust and stated that AMP Capital Investors was liable to make good the loss and damage suffered by IFM.\n\nIt further claimed that AMP Capital Investors had made and continued to make profits in the form of fees payable to it under a long-term management agreement and that it was liable to repay the profits to IFM.\n\nThe deal at the centre of the litigation seems to have had its genesis in 1999 when AMP Capital Investors wrote to IFM saying it would be bidding for the two remaining gas distribution businesses to be sold by the Victorian Government.\n\n\"Bids are required to be submitted by March 11, 1999, and we will write to you, very soon, seeking your commitment to subscribe for equity in our bid vehicle, The Energy Partnership Ltd.\"\n\nIFM's board approved $30 million participation in the bidding process for the gas assets.\n\nThe writ went on to note that Energy Partnership bought Multinet Gas from the State Government for $1.97 billion.\n\nIt recited that Aquila Inc decided to exit its Australian interests and how a sale of the assets to AMP and Alinta was to be structured.\n\nThe writ said IFM's effective 6.2 per cent stake in Multinet was transferred for an implied price of $3.1 million, compared with the value of that interest based on the mid-point of a Grant Samuel valuation of $15.1 million.\n\nThat and a lot more very dry stuff was in a statement of claim drawn up over the names of m'learned Charles Scerri, QC, and Michael Garner.\n\nThe AMP companies' defences will not be known until they are filed.\n\nBuffett tables share strategy\n\nBits and pieces from the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, continue to surface from folk who were present and who scribbled down roughly - hence no direct quotes - some words of wisdom from Warren Buffett and Charles Munger.\n\nWith the sharemarket's long overdue correction on these shores in progress, Buffett once again recited how he liked falling share prices.\n\nHe was asked by a shareholder what his strategy was if the market got dismal. If the market got cheaper, Berkshire would have opportunities to do more intelligent buying, he said.\n\nBerkshire would be buying as prices dropped. He said he was always looking to buy stocks, just as he bought groceries every week. He preferred lower grocery prices. Berkshire spent no time trying to forecast what the market would do.\n\nBerkshire didn't know which way the market was headed. It did know sometimes that it was getting great value. There's always a list of reasons why the US would have problems.\n\nHe said he was a big bull on the US. It's the most remarkable success story in the history of the world.\n\nThere were 4 million people in the US in 1790, who were no smarter than the people in Europe and China, both of which had far bigger populations.\n\nMunger chipped in that the economics of the US would continue to improve, but America might be at or near the apex of a great civilisation.\n\nBuffett said people passed up opportunities because they got wrapped up in a single statistic. he would not wait a year because it would get cheaper due to a macro factor.\n\nBoard self-administers cash\n\nPhosphagenics' boardroom cost a pretty penny in calendar 2004.\n\nAccounts recently to hand show $622,854 was collected by directors, headed by Andrew Lancelot Vizard, the chairman.\n\nThe outfit was restructured during the year and associate professor Vizard declared Phosphagenics was now a \"focused and growing pharmaceutical and vitamin company\".\n\nShareholders would be hoping that the bullish words in the annual report would translate at some stage into earnings, as befits a company valued at $155 million, but which lost $3.1 million."
