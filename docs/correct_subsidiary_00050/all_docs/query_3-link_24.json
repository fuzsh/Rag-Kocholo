        "text": "Leading renewable energy company Pacific Hydro has received development approval to build its first utility-scale battery at the Clements Gap Wind Farm.\n\nWith an estimated capital investment of $77 million, the Clements Gap battery will store clean energy generated from the wind farm and help improve network security for the people and businesses of South Australia.\n\nPacific Hydro's Director of Engineering and Projects, Jonathan Spink, explained why technology such as large-scale batteries are so important to Australia's long-term energy security and stability.\n\n'As we transition to a clean energy future, Australia's energy mix requires greater firm capacity, which provides stability and helps prevent load-shedding events,' he explained.\n\n'Assets such as this battery can be quickly activated when there is a sudden peak in demand, or when the wind simply isn't blowing enough,' said Mr Spink.\n\nLocated adjacent to the Clements Gap Wind Farm substation, the battery will connect to the grid using the existing powerlines.\n\nOperational since 2010, the Clements Gap Wind Farm currently produces enough clean electricity to power the equivalent needs of around 33,000 homes each year.\n\nPacific Hydro also has a strong track record of delivering lasting benefits to the local community through the Clements Gap Wind Farm Sustainable Communities Fund, which has contributed over $400,000 to 110 local projects since 2009. This year alone, $55,000 was provided to ten local community groups.\n\nThe battery project is expected to create up to 20 jobs during construction, which is planned to commence in mid-2022. Tenders for the supply and install of the battery will be called later in 2021.\n\nContact:\n\nTel: 1800 730 734"
