The tracker includes 197 economies. Last updated on July 2, 2021.\n\nNOTE: The tracker focuses on discretionary actions and might not fully reflect the policies taken by countries in response to COVID-19, such as automatic insurance mechanisms and existing social safety nets which differ across countries in their breadth and scope. The information included is not meant for comparison across members as responses vary depending on the nature of the shock and country-specific circumstances. Adding up the different measures—tax and spending, loans and guarantees, monetary instruments, and foreign exchange operations—might not provide an accurate estimate of the aggregate policy support. The tracker includes information that is publicly available or provided by the authorities to country teams and does not represent views of the IMF on the measures listed.\n\nA\n\nBack to Top\n\nAfghanistan, Islamic Republic of\n\nBackground. Afghanistan reported its first COVID-19 case on February 24, 2020. As the infection spread, the government tightened containment measures, including introducing screening at ports of entry, quarantine for infected people, and closure of public places for gathering. It imposed countrywide lockdown in late March 2020, which was subsequently extended twice. Afghanistan experienced a relatively moderate second wave of infections during November-December 2020 with infections declining since early 2021. Schools reopened on February 28, and universities resumed in person instruction in early March 2021.\n\nAfghanistan is currently going through a severe third wave of infections, with the number of cases and deaths topping the peaks of the first wave a year ago. Almost a third of the individuals tested recently had the infection. In response, the authorities have closed schools until further notice and are trying to speed up vaccinations. In consultation with the neighboring countries, they have also halted the movement of people across borders while keeping them open to trade and cargo transit.\n\nThe authorities aim to vaccinate 60 percent of the population. Essential workers and groups prioritized by the National Technical Committee based on their vulnerability to COVID-19 will be vaccinated first. Inoculations using 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine donated by India started in February. The COVAX facility aims to provide vaccines covering 20 percent of the population, with the first shipments of 468,000 doses delivered in early March. Vaccination of another 28 percent of population is expected to be funded by World Bank and ADB grants. That said, less than one percent of the population has been fully vaccinated so far, and Afghanistan is facing a vaccine shortage after a large shipment has been delayed significantly. In response, China donated 700,000 doses, and the U.S. is delivering 3 million doses of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine this week. In addition to the vaccine shortage, the inoculation campaign is also facing administrative challenges and vaccine hesitancy in rural areas.\n\nThe pandemic and containment measures introduced at the onset of the pandemic disrupted domestic activity and trade. Border closures and panic-buying led to a temporary spike in prices of foodstuffs in April 2020, which has abated with the re-opening of borders in early June. Income and job losses in the formal and informal sectors pushed thousands of Afghan families into poverty, threatening to reverse social development gains of the past decade. Oxfam estimates that the number of people on the brink of famine in Afghanistan has risen to 3.5 million in 2020 from 2.5 million in September 2019.\n\nReopening of the economy.\n\nThe government progressively eased the lockdown from late May 2020, with most containment restrictions removed and businesses re-opened by end-August.\n\nBorders points were reopened over the summer of 2020, and cross-border traffic was nearly back to pre-crisis levels before the recent closing. Many domestic and international flights, including for exports via air corridors, have resumed.\n\nIn early August, working hours for government and non-government organizations were normalized to their pre-pandemic level. This was a change from alternating between odd and even weekdays from 7 am until 1 pm (and later 8am to 4 pm) instituted in June-July.\n\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network reported that the May easing of containment led to increased labor availability in urban areas and, in combination with assistance and Zakat, allowed some improvement in consumption. Still, many Afghans remain in a crisis phase of food insecurity.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of July 1, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nThe government initially used contingency funds for emergency pandemic response, including for urgent health needs, such as establishing testing labs; setting up special wards to boost hospitalization and care capacity; and procuring critical medical supplies.\n\nIn April-June 2020, the government provided free bread to the poor in Kabul, later extended to other cities. In May, it waived electricity bills of less than Af 1,000 (US$13) for a family residence in Kabul for two months and paid utility bills of the past two months for 50 percent of households in Kabul. The decision benefited more than 1.5 million Kabul residents.\n\nThe authorities rolled out about 0.8 percent of GDP social assistance under the World Bank-funded REACH program in 2020, with the remaining 0.6 percent of GDP continuing in 2021. The program targets Afghan households with incomes of $2 per day or lower (twice the national poverty line), with households in rural areas receiving an equivalent of $50 in essential food staples and hygiene products, while those in urban areas a combination of cash and in-kind equivalent to $100, in two tranches. .\n\nAltogether, the authorities spent about 2.2 percent of GDP to fight COVID in 2020, including:\n\nHealth package of around Af 10.9 billion, of which Af 2.6 billion on building hospitals and provincial clinics;\n\nThe social package of around Af 14.7 billion, of which Af 2 billion on the bread distribution program and Af 12.7 billion on the World Bank supported social distribution program\n\nTransfers to provinces to finance Covid-19 response of about Af 1.3 billion;\n\nSupport to agriculture and short-term jobs of about Af 5.2 billion and Af 1.0 billion.\n\nSimilarly, the 2021 budget includes the following COVID-related spending:\n\nHealth package of Af 2.4 billion;\n\nSocial package of Af 8.9 billion;\n\nOther Af 3.3 billion.\n\nRecognizing that taxpayers were facing liquidity strains, the government extended the tax filing deadline for the first quarter of 2020 by 45 days. No further extensions have been provided. In late 2020, the government offered to waive tax and customs payment penalties if taxpayers clear their due taxes before the end of the first quarter 2021.\n\nMonetary and Macro-financial\n\nThere have been no liquidity pressures in part thanks to Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB)’s actions to maintain confidence in the Afghani and high liquidity in the banking sector. The authorities increased the frequency of Financial Stability Committee meetings, enhanced the monitoring of early signs of liquidity stress, and reviewed banks’ business continuity plans. DAB postponed the IFRS 9 implementation to June 2021, subsequently by another year to June 2022, and froze loan classifications at the pre-pandemic cutoff of end-February. It also suspended administrative penalties and fees, with no retrospective applications for breaches/noncompliance.\n\nDAB phased out emergency pandemic measures in July 2020. It ended the freeze on loan classifications and recommenced the enforcement of all prudential requirements in August with flexible application of penalties and prudential triggers in recognition of persisting risks. The emergency measures for the nonbank sector were also allowed to expire in July 2020.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nDAB remains focused on achieving price stability in the context of a flexible exchange rate regime. With domestic demand subdued the Afghani has remained broadly stable against the US$. DAB has engaged money-service providers, who play a systemic role in financial intermediation, to ensure uninterrupted services.\n\nBack to Top\n\nAlbania\n\nBackground. Albania was mildly affected in the first wave of the pandemic in the spring of 2020. Due to its proximity and close links to Italy, Albania adopted some of the toughest lockdown measures in Europe in March 2020 as soon as it detected the first confirmed COVID-19 case. The government proclaimed a state of natural catastrophe which enabled it to use extended powers for its three months duration until it ended on June 23, 2020.\n\nReopening the economy and additional containment efforts. Albania removed all domestic restrictions in the summer of 2020 and re-opened its borders. As the second, more aggressive wave hit the country in the fall, some restrictions domestic restrictions were reintroduced (night curfew, ban on assembly of more than 10 people), but the authorities stopped short of a full lockdown. The epidemiological situation has improved consistently since spring, placing the country in good position to relax restrictions further in the summer. Albania imposes no quarantine or testing requirements to visitors from abroad.\n\nVaccination of medical staff started on January 11th, while mass vaccination started in April. As of July 1st , Albania has administered over 968,000 vaccines or 34 per 100 people.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of July 1st, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nThe government adopted two support packages in 2020 for people and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic of a combined size of Lek 45 billion (2.8 percent of GDP) consisting of budget spending, sovereign guarantees and tax deferrals. The first package adopted on March 19, 2020 through a normative act had support measures of Lek 23bn (1.4 percent of GDP) through a combination of spending reallocations, spending increases and sovereign guarantees to support affected businesses. The key measures are: (i) additional funding for health sector in the amount of Lek 2.5 billion (ii) Lek 6.5bn for the support of small businesses/self-employed that are forced to close activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic by paying them minimum salaries (up to two in the case of family businesses with unpaid family members), doubling of the unemployment benefits and social assistance layouts. (iii) Lek 2bn of defense spending reallocated toward humanitarian relief for the most vulnerable which were not used, (iv) Lek 11bn (0.6 percent of GDP) sovereign guarantee fund for companies to access overdrafts in the banking system to pay wages for their employees for up to 3 months with an interest rate capped at 2.85 percent for a maturity of up to 2 years. The government will bear the interest costs. The second package adopted on April 15 2020, includes (i) Lek 7bn (0.4 percent of GDP) fund to pay for a one-off transfer of Lk40,000 to employees of small businesses affected by the pandemic not covered in the first package, employees of large businesses laid off due to the pandemic, and employees in the tourism sector; (ii) a sovereign guarantee of Lek 15 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) to provide loans for working capital for all private companies that were tax-compliant and solvent before the pandemic. The government will guarantee 60 percent of the loans, and interest are capped at 5 percent. As of November 3, almost 98 percent of the overall budgeted direct support measures had been paid out while the take up for the first guarantee scheme was 59 percent and for the second scheme 42 percent. A third smaller support package was adopted on August 13, providing an additional minimum wage to public transport workers who resumed work one month later than the rest. The measure costing Lk135m is accommodated within the existing transport budget.\n\nThe government has also adopted tax deferral measures allowing all large companies (except banks, telecommunication, public enterprises and other essential businesses) to defer payment of profit tax for the second and third quarter of 2020 in 2021. Tourism, active processing and call centers can defer payments for the rest of 2020 to 2021. Small businesses with turnover below Lk14m will not pay profit tax for the remainder of 2021.\n\nIn September, the government launched an employment promotion program, that aims to cover part of reemployment costs of those who lost their jobs during the lockdown. For formal sector employees the government will cover half of the wages (at the legal minimum level) and the full employers’ share of social contributions for the duration of the program (4 or 8 months). Informal sector employees who lost their jobs during the lockdown, will have the full cost of social contributions (employees and employers share) covered for one year if they formalize.\n\nThe 2021 budget The 2021 budget adopted by parliament on Nov 16th, allocated Lk14.2bn (0.8 percent of GDP) in COVID-19 related spending. These include Lk7.2bn for COVID-19 treatment, Lk4.5bn for wage increases for doctors and nurses, and Lk2.5bn for a temporary increase in the payments for social assistance (until June 2021) and unemployment benefits. In successive budget amendments in March and April the government allocated additional Lk3bn to the purchase of Covid 19 vaccines. This brings the total of Covid-related spending in the 2021 budget to Lk17.2bn (1 percent of GDP).\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nTo address the liquidity bottlenecks of companies and individuals, the Bank of Albania extended a temporary suspension of requirements for loan classifications and provisioning to August 31, 2020, enabling clients to ask banks to defer loan installments without penalties. On May 28, the BoA also adopted regulations to allow banks to restructure loans within 2020 without additional provisioning or downgrades for borrowers’ status. Entry in force of more stringent classification and provisioning measures for reclassified loans was postponed by one year to 2022. Out of court restructuring for distressed borrowers under a special regulation will be possible for an additional year until 2022.\n\nOn March 25, the Bank of Albania cut its key policy rate the weekly repo, by 50 basis points to a new historic minimum of 0.5 percent. The Governor announced that the banking sector is liquid and well capitalized, and the central bank stands ready to provide unlimited liquidity for as long as needed. This policy was further extended until at least the third quarter of 2021.\n\nThe Bank of Albania suspended dividend distribution for banks until the end 2020 in order to boost capital and support lending during this period. On January 13, 2021, the central bank lifted the suspension on the distribution of 2019 dividends, but instituted a suspension on the distribution of 2020 and 2021 dividends until end 2021.\n\nTo urge the use of internet banking and reduce the number of people requiring services in bank premises, the central bank also waived the commissions for transfers in local currency.\n\nOn July 17, 2020, the Bank of Albania announced it had set up a €400 million repo line with the ECB. On February 4, the ECB announced a nine-month extension until March 2022.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nAlbania has a floating exchange rate. The Bank of Albania intervenes only in pre-announced purchases to boost reserves or to smooth excessive and disruptive short-term volatility. On June 30, the Bank of Albania announced it had intervened in the market in end-March 2020 to smooth temporary excessive volatility caused by initial disruptions of lockdown measures.\n\nBack to Top\n\nAlgeria\n\nAlgeria has been hit by two shocks in 2020—the spread of COVID-19 and the sharp decline in oil prices. Government policy is responding to both shocks.\n\nThe first case of COVID-19 in Algeria was reported on February 25, 2020. The authorities responded to the pandemic by implementing containment measures since early February 2020 (e.g., cancelling flights, and imposing quarantines to repatriated Algerians). Confinement measures included closure of schools, universities, restaurants, and shops; cancellation of public and private events; shut down of transportation services (internal and external); putting on mandatory leave half of civil servants and private workers with full compensation. Demonstrations and religious activities were cancelled, a lockdown of affected areas was ordered and a curfew was put in place in several cities including Algiers.\n\nA gradual easing of containment measured started in early June 2020. The authorities have continued to monitor and adapt the lockdown measures as needed, including during the second wave of the pandemic in Algeria in late 2020. International borders partially reopened in June 2021. The number of daily new cases, which had fallen sharply through late March 2021 following a peak during the second wave, is ticking up again. Algeria started the vaccination campaign in late-January 2021 and has since received additional doses through the COVAX Facility and other sources for a total of 2.7 million doses as at end-May 2021. Domestic production of the Sputnik V vaccine is expected to start in September, according to an official government announcement.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of June 28, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nIn terms of tax measures, in response to the economic impact on households and enterprises of the lockdown measures in 2020, the authorities postponed the declaration and payments of income taxes for individuals and enterprises. Further contractual deadlines were relaxed and penalties for companies that experience delays in completing public contracts were suspended. Imports of pharmaceutical products and medical equipment used in the fight against Covid-19 were temporarily exonerated from VAT and custom duties.\n\nThe 2021 budget law introduced a permanent tax holiday for foreign-currency-generating export activities and suspended VAT and custom duties for imported or domestically purchased inputs used in the production of goods. It also extended the repayment period of overdue tax claims to 60 months from 36 months previously,\n\nIn terms of spending measures, a supplementary finance law (SFL) enacted on June 4, 2020 included provisions amounting to DZD 70 bn dinars to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. For the health sector, this included DZD 3.7 bn for medical supplies, DZD 16.5 bn for bonus payments to health workers, and DZD 8.9 bn for the health sector's development. For the economic impact, the law included DZD 20 bn for allowances to the unemployed and DZD 11.5 bn for transfers to poor households. Overall, in order to adjust to the new low oil price environment, the SFL envisaged a reduction in current and capital spending by 5.7 percent (representing 2.2 percent of 2019 GDP) compared to the initial 2020 budget law.\n\nThe government estimates the total budget cost of spending measures taken in response to the pandemic at DZD 238 bn for 2020 and the first four months of 2021. Of this amount, DZD 99.1bn were in exceptional bonuses to civil servants contributing to the fight against the pandemic, mostly health workers, DZD73bn were in social support measures to low-income households and DZD 22.5bn for vaccine procurement.\n\nIn terms of economic reforms, a national socio-economic recovery plan was discussed at a conference in August 2020. The authorities published a 2020-2024 Economic Revival plan in June 2021. Among other things the plan aims at diversifying the economy, fostering high value-added sectors and international trade and promoting a favorable business climate and FDI.\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nOn March 15, the Bank of Algeria lowered the reserve requirement ratio from 10 percent to 8 percent, and its main policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent.\n\nOn April 6, the Bank of Algeria announced that it was easing solvency, liquidity and NPLs ratios for banks. Banks are also allowed to extend payments of some loans without a need to provision against them.\n\nOn April 30, the Bank of Algeria announced that it was cutting its main policy rate from 3.25 to 3.00 percent, that it was lowering its reserve requirement ratio from 8 percent to 6 percent, and that it was lowering haircuts on government securities used in refinancing operations.\n\nOn September 14, the Bank of Algeria announced a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio from 6 percent to 3 percent and the activation of 1-month open market operations.\n\nOn October 14, 2020, the Bank of Algeria announced that the easing of prudential requirements for banks, announced in April 2020, would be extended through the end of the year.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, the Bank of Algeria announced that the easing of prudential requirements for banks, first announced in April 2020, would be extended through March 31, 2021. On February 8 2021, the Bank of Algeria announced a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio from 3 percent to 2 percent effective February 15, 2021.\n\nOn April 1, 2021, the Bank of Algeria announced that the easing of prudential requirements for banks, first announced in April 2020, would be extended through June 30, 2021.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nThe authorities announced several measures to cut the import bill by at least USD 10 bn (6 percent of GDP). Authorities banned exports of several products, including food, medical and hygiene items.\n\nBack to Top\n\nAndorra\n\nBackground. Andorra has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, with the first confirmed case reported on March 2, 2020. To cope with the outbreak, which affected 1 percent of the population in the first wave, the economy was in full lockdown for a month until April 17. A phased reopening, coupled with mandatory use of masks and antibody testing for the entire population, started in May 18 and extended through the summer season. The decline in tourism due to travel restrictions, together with the domestic effect of lockdowns and social distancing measures, have severely impacted the Andorran economy, which shrank by about 12 percent in 2020.\n\nReopening of the Economy. With the economy's re-opening and the start of the 2020 summer season, activity picked up but there was a resurgence of cases, with daily new infections almost tripling those of the first wave. To cope with the health crisis the government adopted more stringent social distancing measures in September 2020, which remained in place throughout October and were only partially relaxed in November and December in lieu of the improvement in COVID statistics. Despite the efforts to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19 during the holiday season, including by providing free antigen tests to all Andorran residents, active cases, deaths and hospitalizations increased significantly in January 2021. The health situation improved in February, which allowed for partial relaxation of some containment measures, but this reverted in March for various reasons: the spread of other variants of the virus, the higher social interaction due to the carnival holidays, and the impact of large outbreaks in two villages. Since then, new cases have sharply declined and there have not been any new deaths in the past two months. This has allowed the authorities to significantly relax containment measures, including ending the mandatory use of masks outdoors (except when social distancing cannot be maintained), increasing the maximum allowed capacity for indoor activities and social/cultural events, and authorizing bars and restaurants to extend their operating hours until 1am. Regarding mobility at the borders, the travel restrictions have been completely lifted by Spain in March 31st and only partially by France in May 3rd, the latter still requiring negative COVID tests for trips longer than 24 hours or that go beyond the neighboring French regions. The vaccination campaign started in January 20th. So far, the pace of vaccination has been comparable to that of EU countries facing similar problems of supply, and doses for more than half the population have arrived. About 55 percent of the population had received at least one dose, and 35 percent were fully vaccinated, by the end of June.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of July 1, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nKey above-the-line measures in 2020, amounting to 2.7 percent of 2020 GDP (€68 million), include: (i) additional healthcare-related spending (€18.2 million); (ii) payment of 75 percent of the salary to workers under the schemes of temporary suspension of contract and reduction of working time (€24.6 million); (iii) social security contributions for workers who were temporarily laid off due to the pandemic (€3.5 million); (iv) extraordinary benefit for self-employed workers affected by economic activity suspension and other support measures to households (€11.7 million); (v) rent/mortgage payment support to the sectors most affected by the pandemic (€0.5 million); (vi) 30-percent reduction in the advance payment of the corporate tax and deferment or installment payments of tax debts without generating late payment interest (€9.1 million). The government also relaxed the requirements to access unemployment benefits and rental housing aid for individuals whose economic and social situation worsened due to the health crisis.\n\nIn 2020, the telecommunications and electricity public enterprises provided discounts on the monthly bills of firms that had to completely suspend activities or that experienced a significant decline in their business (€5.1 million, 0.2 percent of 2020 GDP), as well as the possibility of paying the bills in up to 12 monthly installments. In November, the government approved subsidies on electricity and telecommunication services to the businesses most affected by the pandemic that had already received the government’s support for rent/mortgage payments as well as those businesses whose workers are under either temporal suspension of work contracts or short-time work arrangements.\n\nExpecting a protracted crisis, on December 4th, 2020, the authorities approved a new package of measures, which came into force on January 1st, 2021, aimed at supporting the reactivation of the economy. This package extended for up to six months—until June 30th, 2021—many of the support measures for households and businesses already in place, and in some cases, it refined the conditions under which the measures were applicable to adapt to the health and economic circumstances. In addition, on December 16th, the government created a new temporary and exceptional involuntary unemployment benefit to support Andorran workers directly affected by the delayed opening of the ski stations To further help the ski sector to cope with the disappointing winter season, at the end of March, the authorities approved an extraordinary program of rental and mortgage support, retroactive to January 1st, and targeted to companies exclusively dedicated to the rental and sale of ski equipment.\n\nAt the end of May 2021, the authorities announced a new package of extraordinary measures, in force starting from July 1st, upon expiration of the previous package, and in place until December 31st, 2021 (or 90 days after the declaration of the end of the health crisis, if earlier). The new package extends existing measures, particularly those related to short-time work schemes (STW) and benefits to self-employed, but made conditions for applicability more restrictive, only to cases in which businesses activity continues to be severely affected by the pandemic. The government also approved a new program of rent/mortgage payment support for travel agencies and nightclubs, in place only during July.\n\nCompared to 2020, the authorities are planning to maintain the healthcare spending to finance the purchase of vaccines and tests, and the operation of the COVID Office. They are also keeping in place most support measures to households (including the benefits to the self-employed), while those to firms—particularly ERTO—are being rolled back as the economy is projected to recover. The cost of COVID-related measures in 2021 is estimated to be 1.4 percent of GDP (€38 million).\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nIn 2020, the government provided two packages of government guarantees for new bank loans to businesses, in which the government also takes on the interest payments. The first package, amounting €130 million (5 percent of GDP), to cover operating costs (€60 million) or to service existing debts with Andorran banks (€70 million). The second package, amounting €100 million (4 percent of GDP), to cover: (i) the service of existing debts with Andorran banks; (ii) the payment of the share of benefits associated with the temporary suspension of contracts; and (iii) investments needed to abide with the new health and social distancing protocols. The take up in 2020 was of €135.8 million (5.5 percent of GDP). Most of the second package is still available to use in 2021 and the government has relaxed the conditions to access it, incorporating additional purposes for requesting the guaranteed loans, which now include: the payment of rent and utility bills, leasing operations, fuel expenses for transportation, and the corporate contributions to job retention schemes. In addition, to facilitate repayment of the loans, the authorities approved a six-month extension of the maturity date of all the loans formalized in 2020 under the guarantee program, counting from the maturity date stated in the contract.\n\nThe Andorran government approved a legislative moratoria on April 18th, 2020, to provide repayment relief—and also extension of the repayment period in the case of mortgages—until December 31st, 2020, to households and businesses affected by the pandemic, which meet the requirements established by the law. This moratoria applied to mortgages and personal loans to finance housing or vehicles in the case of individuals and commercial property in the case of businesses.\n\nOn June 11th, 2020, the Andorran Banking Association (ABA) adopted non-legislative sector-wide moratoria to provide repayment relief to households and businesses, for 6-12 months depending upon the types of loan and borrower. This private moratoria scheme complemented the one approved by the government, and could not be applied simultaneously. In mid-December 2020, ABA extended until March 31st, 2021, the application deadline for the moratoria.\n\nSupervisory and regulatory action. The financial supervisor, Andorran Financial Authority (AFA), adopted as its own the European Banking Authority guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria. Furthermore, AFA adopted a set of measures, in line with the recommendations by the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank, including: (i) limiting in situ examinations to only those strictly necessary and postpone the non-priority ones to 2021; (ii) postpone stress tests, which are supposed to be done at least every three years for supervisory purposes, to 2021 if conditions allow; (iii) postponing beyond the 2020 exercise the requirement of establishing a capital buffer for systemic risks, which was supposed to be introduced in January 2020; (iv) recommending banks to not distribute dividends from the 2019 exercise. The government also extended the deadline for banks to report on their audited balance sheets to AFA from March 31, 2020 to April 30, 2020.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nNo measures.\n\nLinks\n\nhttps://www.govern.ad/coronavirus\n\nhttps://www.afa.ad/en/press-room/covid-19\n\nhttps://www.andorranbanking.ad/en/covid-19/\n\nBack to Top\n\nAngola\n\nBackground. The first COVID-19 case was reported on March 21, 2020, while community transmission started on April 27. In June 2021, the authorities kept the existing flight restrictions, limited the operating workforce of governmental and private institutions up to 50 percent, shortened the school year and approved co-payment of Covid-19 tests for international and domestic business trips. By end-June, average daily cases reduced to 120 cases (7-days moving average) from the peak of 300 daily cases in end-May. Angola received 624,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and over 100,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine delivered through the COVAX system, a donation of 200,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine from the Beijing Institute of Biological Products. As of end-June, about 1 million people had received the first dose and over 540,000 people had received the second dose. However, due to the shortage of doses, authorities have stop administering the first dose vaccination until the first half of July. The vaccination plan is estimated to cost US$ 217 million and aims to cover 20 percent of the population in the first phase. The Angolan government has authorized the purchase of additional 6 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, of which 40,000 were received. The World Bank, United Nations, European Union, African Development Bank and European Investment Bank are providing financial support and resources in several ways. In June 2021, the IMF approved the Fifth Review of the ongoing EFF program and disbursed US$ 772 million in budget support, accommodating Covid-19 vaccine procurement.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of July 1st, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nThe National Assembly approved revenue and expenditure measures to fight the COVID-19 outbreak and minimize its negative economic impact. About US$40 million on additional health care spending was announced and about US$80 million are being spent on 250 Cuban doctors who arrived in Angola to help. Tax exemptions on humanitarian aid and donations and some delays on filing taxes for selected imports were granted. On July 28, 2020, the National Assembly adopted a conservative supplementary budget, aiming at securing space for additional health expenditure, while balancing the need to keep debt on a sustainable path. The 2021 budget consolidated the nonoil revenue gains and expenditure restraint of the 2020 budget, while protecting priority health and social spending. On May 17, 2021, additional US$ 33 million were approved for purchase of 4 million vaccine doses through the African Union.\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nIn March 2020, the central bank (BNA) reduced the rate on its 7-day permanent liquidity absorption facility and expanded its credit-stimulus program to selected sectors. Financial institutions were requested to grant their clients a moratorium of 60 days for servicing debt. In April 3, the BNA increased the minimum bank credit allocation to producers of priority products and instructed banks to provide credit in local currency to assist importers of essential goods. In May 7, 2020, the BNA reinstated its Permanent Overnight Liquidity Provision facility to provide liquidity support to banks (Kz 100 billion), and extended access to large non-financial corporations on a discount line created for the purchasing of government securities. However, with inflation steadily rising and the worst of the shock seemingly passing, the BNA shifted to a gradual tightening in the second half of 2020. Actions included the enhanced use of open market operations to drain excess liquidity from the system and an increase in the reserve requirement on banks' foreign exchange deposits (to be settled in domestic currency) in September. In March 2021, the BNA implemented additional measures to control inflation, including increasing the 7-day permanent liquidity absorption facility (reversing the cut in the same rate made in March 2020) and, in May 2021, again increased the reserve requirement on banks' foreign exchange deposits. In June 2021, BNA requested the financial institutions to grant companies of the mostly impacted sectors by the pandemic (transport, tourism and sports), a moratorium of up to 6 months for servicing debt.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nOn April 1, 2020, the central bank introduced an electronic platform for foreign exchange transactions. By May 2021, the transactions between the largest players, including Oil, diamond, Treasury and BNA, were carried out in the platform. Exchange rate futures were also traded in the platform.\n\nBack to Top\n\nArgentina\n\nBackground. The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 3, 2020. The authorities adopted sweeping measures to prevent a rapid growth in infections, involving a full closure of borders and a nation-wide quarantine, beginning on March 20. The pandemic and the containment measures had a significant economic impact, with a GDP contraction of around 10 percent of GDP in 2020. In May 2020, the government first announced a gradual reopening aimed at raising regional mobilization, excluding the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. However, restrictions were subsequently tightened in response to an acceleration in infections and, in early June 2020, the mandatory lockdown was extended to other selected large cities. Another phased reopening of activities was announced in July 2020, but rising infections led to an extension of the mandatory lockdown until November 2020. As cases levelled off in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, the government announced a move to a stage of social distancing in November 2020. In January, after a rise in new cases, restrictions were once again tightened in some inland districts of Buenos Aires and other inland provinces. The number of new cases moderated in January and February, with 16 provinces returning to in-school learning. However, as in other countries in the region, new cases picked up again, prompting the re-imposition of mobility and travel restrictions to limit the spread of new virus variants. The gradual vaccination rollout has accelerated since May, mainly reflecting the easing of supply constraints.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of July 1, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nAnnounced measures (totaling about 6.5 percent of 2020 GDP, 4.5 percent in the budget and 2 percent off-budget, based on the authorities’ estimates) have focused on providing: (i) increased health spending, including for improvements in virus diagnostics, purchases of vaccines and hospital equipment, and construction of clinics and hospitals; (ii) support for workers and vulnerable groups, including through increased transfers to poor families, social security benefits (especially to low-income beneficiaries), unemployment insurance benefits, and payments to minimum-wage workers; (iii) support for hard-hit sectors, including reduced social security contributions, grants to cover payroll costs; and subsidized loans for construction-related activities; (iv) demand support, including spending on public works; (v) forbearance, including continued provision of utility services for households in arrears; and (vi) credit guarantees for bank lending to micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) for the production of foods and basic supplies. In addition, the authorities have adopted anti-price gouging policies, including price controls for food and medical supplies and ringfencing of essential supplies, including certain export restrictions on medical supplies and equipment and centralization of the sale of essential medical supplies.\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nMeasures have been aimed at encouraging bank lending through (i) lower reserve requirements on bank lending to households and SMEs; (ii) regulations that limit banks’ holdings of central bank paper to provide space for SME lending; (iii) temporary easing of bank provisioning needs and of bank loan classification rules (i.e. extra 60 days to be classified as non-performing); and (iv) a stay on both bank account closures due to bounced checks and credit denial to companies with payroll tax arrears.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nA broad set of CFMs have been in place since August 2019, aimed at restricting financial account transactions (limits on purchase of dollars, transfers abroad and debt service in foreign currency), and some current account transactions (surrender requirements on export proceeds, restrictions on imports of services, dividend payments abroad, and interest payments on foreign currency debt). CFMs helped limit outflows in the wake of the pandemic. The exchange rate has depreciated by over 50 percent vis-à-vis the US dollar since early March 2020.\n\nBack to Top\n\nArmenia\n\nBackground. The first confirmed case was reported on March 1, 2020. The pace of new COVID-19 cases has slowed down further in December, after its peak in October. The government extended a national state of emergency to September 11, and imposed strict containment measures, including school closures, travel bans on foreign citizens from high risk countries, and imposed fines to those who violate isolation orders during the state of emergency. The government announced an assistance package with a headline amount of $300 million (2 percent of GDP) to mitigate the socio-economic issues related to the pandemic, although this includes a variety of direct spending, state-sponsored loans and increased investment.\n\nReopening of the economy. Since May 2020, the movement restrictions were removed, and containment measures were eased, allowing for resumption of public transport, retail businesses, and restaurants. In September 2020, airspace was reopened, and the government lifted the state of emergency, and established quarantine in effect until July 11, 2021, requiring incoming travelers to have negative PCR tests taken within 72 hours prior to crossing border. As of mid-February, all restrictions on holding public events are removed.\n\nOn March 29, 2021, Armenia received the first batch of 24 thousand doses of AstraZeneca vaccine․ Since then, the second batch of 50 thousand doses of AstraZeneca, more than 15000 doses of Sputnik V and 100 thousand doses of Chinese CoronaVac arrived. Yet, as of May 23, 2021, only about 27 thousand people have been vaccinated, which is less than one percent of Armenia's population.\n\nStarting June 1, 2021, the Ministry of Health stated that wearing masks in open-air public places is no longer compulsory and as of July 1, 2021, fully vaccinated citizens don't have to wear masks indoors.\n\nOn June 19, a new batch of 60,000 doses of Sputnik V vaccine has arrived to Yerevan which covers 30,000 people.\n\nAs of June 22, 65,719 people are vaccinated in Armenia, comprising nearly 2% of the population and 80% out of them have received their first vaccine dose.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of July 1, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nThe measures fall into three broad categories:(i) subsidized 2-3 year loans to provide short-term support to affected businesses and SMEs; (ii) direct subsidies to SMEs and businesses to help maintain their employees; (iii) grants to entrepreneurs and firms; (iv) lump-sum transfers to the vulnerable including individuals who were unemployed after the COVID-19 outbreak, families with or expecting children, micro-businesses, general population who needed help with utility bills, and temporary part-time employment. As of end-October, the authorities have adopted 24 support packages and, together with bank supports, allocated around 192.3billion AMD ($367m) to those. Some measures were adapted to support corporate investment. The government also allocated parts of the budget for investment to support post-crisis recovery.\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nInitially, in the context of low inflation and weakening domestic demand, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) implemented four policy rate cuts, by cumulative 125 basis points, since the beginning of 2020 to support economic activity adversely affected by the pandemic. However, rising inflation prompted the CBA to start increasing the rate. It was raised 4 times by 225 bps cumulatively to 6 percent between December 2020 and May 2021. The interbank market has been active, and the central bank has met liquidity needs and provided a few FX swap operations to assure sufficient liquidity in dram and in FX. The volumes of weekly repos have been increasing. The CBA has been undertaking foreign exchange interventions to support the normal functioning of the market which is critical to the effective implementation of monetary and financial stability policies.\n\nThe CBA has not used macroprudential policies actively, except asking banks to consider voluntary prudent loan restructuring and payment holiday period from March to June. The CBA's authorities are supervising banks' liquidity positions and will act swiftly if required to safeguard financial stability.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nThe exchange rate has been allowed to adjust flexibly and has depreciated against the US$ since the military conflict in the fall of 2020 . No balance of payment or capital control measures have been adopted.\n\nBack to Top\n\nAruba\n\nBackground. Aruba has already undergone four waves of COVID-19. The first wave peaked on April 9, 2020, with 69 active cases. Coronavirus cases have resurged significantly following the reopening of borders on June 15, and the second wave tipped on September 9, with 1,630 active infections. The third and fourth waves peaked on January 13, 2021 and April 3, respectively with 624 and 706 active cases. The total number of confirmed infections as of June 30, 2021 stood at 11,135 with 29 active cases and 107 total deaths. The pandemic is affecting Aruba through the disruption to domestic activity from voluntary and mandatory social distancing and a sharp decline in tourism. Soon after recording the first case of coronavirus on March 13, 2020, the authorities have adopted containment measures, including a shelter-in place, a compulsory dusk-to-dawn curfew, travel restrictions, suspension of non-vital government services, closures of schools and non-essential business activities, and limits on social gatherings.\n\nReopening of the economy. The reopening stage has suffered setbacks. Initially, the government developed a phased reopening plan starting on May 4, 2020 and all economic activities had resumed by end-June. However, due to the resurgence of new cases, on August 3rd, the government re-instated some measures, including procedures to facilitate testing. On October 22 the government began to relax measures aimed at curbing the second wave, however, these relaxations were cut back on January 7, 2021, to fight the third and fourth waves. On May 25, the government started relaxing measures again, including curfew and beach restrictions. The country's borders reopened gradually, and as of December 1, 2020 all travel restrictions were lifted and commercial air traffic resumed subject to strict health and safety protocols. However, borders with Brazil have closed again on January 25, 2021, and air flights with Canada were suspended from January 29 until April 30, 2021 by the Canadian government. Since March 18, 2021, South African and Venezuelan residents are not permitted until further notice. Travelers must either take a PCR test upon arrival at the airport in Aruba or provide a certified negative test result before travel, and need to be insured for medical expenses should they test positive during their stay. On June 1, 2021, the government announced that vaccinated Aruba residents no longer need PCR test upon entry the country. On June 9, Aruba welcomed the first cruise ship. The authorities continue promoting Aruba as an alternative destination for foreigners to work remotely.\n\nA COVID-19 vaccination program began on February 17, 2021 with vaccines provided by the Netherlands. As of June 30, about 68 percent of Aruba's population received at least one dose and more than 59 percent is fully vaccinated.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of June 30, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nOn March 26, the parliament approved the amended 2020 budget, containing a higher spending related to the healthcare sector and three supporting programs: i) a relief package for employees who lose their jobs due to the virus outbreak; ii) a package to support social security; iii) and a package to support small and medium-sized enterprises. The government also introduced a 3-month payroll subsidy for businesses that have seen a drop of over 25% in their monthly revenues. The authorities reduced government expenditures, including the wage bill and goods and services, to contain the anticipated large deficit in the budget.\n\nOn October 4, the authorities extended salary subsidies and financial aid to medium and small businesses for 3 more months, until December 2020.\n\nOn the revenue side, tax relief measures were introduced in April-May to allow the postponement of tax payments without penalties. On October 26, the authorities announced a second emergency fiscal plan which consists of 11 initiatives, including indirect tax relief for small business and the abolition of special taxes on rental cars and motorcycles as well as training and education allowances. Starting January 1, 2021, income and payroll taxes were lowered although this was a previously planned reform in the context of the simplification of the tax system started in 2019.\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nOn March 17, 2020, the central bank of Aruba (CBA) lowered: the reserve requirement on commercial bank deposits from 12 to 11 percent; the minimum capital adequacy ratio from 16 to 14 percent; and the prudential liquidity ratio from 18 to 15 percent. Furthermore, the maximum allowed loan-to-deposit ratio was increased from 80 to 85 percent (see: https://www.cbaruba.org/cba/readBlob.do?id=6307)On May 5, the CBA further lowered reserve requirement to 7 percent. On June 30, the CBA published the results of its yearly stress test on the commercial banking sector concluding that the existing ample capital and liquidity buffers provide banks with sufficient room to withstand significant external shocks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, provided that the recovery starts in the second half of 2020 (see: https://www.cbaruba.org/cba/readBlob.do?id=6655).\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nOn March 17, 2020, the CBA announced that it would not grant any new foreign exchange licenses related to selected outgoing transactions, and that it stands ready to take further measures to preserve the peg. On June 1, the CBA started a gradual relaxation of the foreign exchange rate restrictions.\n\nBack to Top\n\nAustralia\n\nBackground. The first COVID-19 case in Australia was confirmed on January 25, 2020. Social distancing measures were increasingly tightened in late March/early April 2020, including banning public gatherings of more than two people and shutting down non-essential businesses. After the National Cabinet announced a three-step plan on May 8, 2020 to relax COVID-19 restrictions, States and Territories eased regional containment measures.\n\nFrom July to early November 2020, a regional COVID-19 resurgence triggered a renewed lockdown in metropolitan Melbourne and tightening of restrictions for the State of Victoria (outside of Melbourne). Since then, there have been temporary local lockdowns in South Australia (November 2020), Sydney's Northern Beaches (December 2020/January 2021), Perth and adjacent areas in Western Australia (January/February 2021 and April 2021), Brisbane (March 2021), and Victoria (May/June 2021). In mid-June, Greater Sydney started reporting a few new cases of the highly infectious Delta variant, followed by locally transmitted outbreaks in late June and a two-week lockdown (ending July 9). On June 27, the Northern Territory was also placed under lockdown, initially for two days, subsequently extended through July 2. Similarly, Queensland imposed a snap lockdown from June 29 until July 2, and Greater Perth and the Peel region were put under lockdown from June 29 until July 3. The new lockdowns are impacting nearly a half of Australia's population.\n\nAcross the country, state-level restrictions on public gatherings and social distancing rules remain. Overseas travel remains banned, and any arrivals in Australia are quarantined for 14 days, with the exception that travelers from New Zealand have been able to enter quarantine-free since October 16, 2020. A reciprocal travel bubble with New Zealand started on April 19, 2021, although it has been disrupted by local outbreaks, mostly recently in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. Travel is expected to resume from July 5, with some restrictions. COVID-19 vaccinations in Australia started from February 22, 2021.\n\nThe economy has continued to recover with real GDP increasing by 1.8 percent q/q in the first quarter of 2021, following the 3.2 percent q/q rise in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of July 1, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nAt the Commonwealth level, fiscal stimulus, consisting of expenditure and revenue measures worth A$312 billion (15¾ percent of 2020 GDP), has been put in place through FY2025. Nearly two-thirds of the stimulus is set to expire by end-FY2021 (June 2021), including a flagship JobKeeper wage subsidy program which disbursed estimated payments of A$89 billion (4.5 percent of 2020 GDP) through end-March 2021. The stimulus includes the health response package, amounting to A$20 billion (1.0 percent of GDP), to secure access to COVID-19 vaccines, roll out a national Vaccination Program, strengthen the health system, protect vulnerable people, including those in aged care, from the outbreak of COVID-19, and provide financial support to the States and the Territories. Major developments at the Commonwealth level include:\n\nOn May 11, 2021, the Commonwealth government revealed the FY2022 budget, with additional stimulus measures of A$48.4 billion (2.5 percent of GDP) through FY2025, including additional tax reliefs for low-and middle-income earners, extending temporary full expensing and loss carry-backs for businesses, and adding spending on infrastructure investment and training programs. Separately, the new budget adds significant social spending over FY2022-25, including for aged-care (0.9 percent of GDP) and disability programs (0.7 percent of GDP), as well as various programs to support women, including for their safety, education, health, and retirement. It also invests A$1.6 billion to fund priority low emissions technologies.\n\nOn December 17,2020, the government released its Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO), and introduced additional funding (A$7 billion, 0.4 percent of GDP) to strengthen the national vaccination program and extend the Coronavirus Supplement and other income support measures for another three months through end-March 2021.\n\nOn October 6, 2020, the FY2021 Budget unveiled an additional stimulus package (A$98.2 billion, or 5 percent of GDP). It included a new JobMaker program (A$73 billion), comprising new measures (such as loss carry-backs and a personal income tax cut), as well as the extension of existing measures (the temporary Coronavirus Supplement, other income support measures, full expensing, and infrastructure investment, among others). Separately, the budget showed the government's commitment to invest in green technologies (A$1.9 billion) to lower emissions.\n\nOn July 23, 2020, the government released an update to Australia's Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The July update revised the cost estimate of the JobKeeper wage subsidy program to A$85.7 billion (down from A$130 billion), including an extension of the program at a tapered level for six months through end-March 2021. The July update introduced a new JobTrainer Skills package (a training program for job seekers), and additional health support to boost the testing capacity.\n\nIn March 2020, the government unveiled a series of economic and health packages, amounting to A$217.1 billion (11 percent of GDP) through FY2024. The first round of stimulus measures, announced on March 12, amounted to A$17.6 billion and included a one-off stimulus payment to welfare recipients, accelerated depreciation deductions, expansion of applicable eligibility criteria for instant asset write-offs, cash flow assistance for businesses, and financial support (including tax and fee waivers) to sectors, regions, and communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic. On March 22, a second rescue package (A$66 billion) was announced, including the Coronavirus Supplement (a top-up payment to JobSeeker unemployment benefits and welfare recipients) and additional economic support for households and businesses. On March 30, a landmark JobKeeper wage subsidy program (A$130 billion) was introduced to help Australians maintain their jobs.\n\nOther measures include an allocation of up to A$15 billion to invest in asset backed securities to help funding for small banks and non-bank financial institutions, and A$20 billion for loan guarantees between the Commonwealth government and participating banks to cover the immediate cash flow needs of SMEs. The latter scheme has been extended twice (initially through June 2021 and then through end-December 2021). In March 2021, the government renamed it the SME Recovery Loan Scheme, under which the government guarantees 80 percent (previously: 50 percent) of new SME loan amounts (starting April 2021), with the maximum loan size raised to A$5 million and the maximum maturity extended to ten years. The scheme also offers up to 24 months of repayment holidays.\n\nState and Territory governments also announced fiscal stimulus packages, together amounting to A$50 billion (2.5 percent of GDP), including payroll tax relief for businesses and relief for households, such as discount utility bills, cash payments to vulnerable households, support for health spending, construction, infrastructure packages, and green investment (renewable energy and technologies).\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has announced a comprehensive package of monetary easing, including policy rate cuts, yield curve target, term funding facilities, and government bond purchases. The Overnight Cash Rate target was cut to 0.25 percent in March 2020 and further reduced to 0.1 percent in November 2020. The interest rate on commercial banks' exchange settlement balances at the RBA was reduced to zero. The RBA also introduced yield targeting on 3-year government bonds through purchases of government bonds in the secondary market, with the target rate set at the level of the overnight cash rate. During the initial phase of the pandemic, to ensure market liquidity, the RBA conducted longer-term repos and broadened the range of eligible collateral for open market operations to include investment-grade securities issued by non-bank corporations. It has also established a swap line with US Fed for the provision of US dollar liquidity up to US$60 billion. To support the provision of credit, especially to SMEs, the RBA established the A$90 billion Term Funding Facility (TFF) in March 2020 for banks to access three-year funding at 25 basis points until September 2020. The facility was subsequently expanded to A$200 billion at a rate of 10 basis points, with access extended through June 2021.\n\nIn addition, the RBA announced secondary market purchases of A$100 billion of 5 to 10-year government bonds issued by the Australian Government and the states and territories in November 2020. The purchase program was expanded to A$200 billion and extended through September 2021. The RBA also stepped up its forward guidance by stating that it would not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably back in the 2 to 3 percent target range and that it is not expecting to increase the cash rate until 2024 at the earliest.\n\nOn June 1, 2021, the RBA kept the cash rate target (0.1 percent) and the 3-year government bond yield target (0.1 percent) as well as the parameters of the Term Funding Facility unchanged. The RBA also reiterated that the conditions required for a cash rate hike are not expected to be met until 2024 at the earliest. The Term Funding Facility, which is set to expire on June 30, 2021, will not be extended.\n\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has provided temporary relief from its capital requirement, allowing banks to utilize some of their large buffers to facilitate ongoing lending to the economy provided minimum capital requirements are met. The scheduled implementation of the Basel III reforms in Australia was postponed by one year to January 2023. In March 2020, APRA granted a regulatory concession for six months, allowing banks to not treat deferred loan payment due to COVID as impaired and hence avoiding higher capital charges. The concession was later extended to March 31, 2021. APRA also suspended the issuing of new licenses in response to the large economic uncertainty. Dividend payment restrictions were put in place for banks and insurers in April 2020 to build capital buffers, then relaxed in July and fully lifted from January 2021.\n\nInsolvency relief measures for businesses were put in place by the Commonwealth government from March 2020 for six months, extended through December 2020 and have since expired. In January 2021, the government also introduced permanent changes to the insolvency law to streamline the liquidation and restructuring of small businesses\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nThe exchange rate has been allowed to adjust flexibly to absorb economic shocks.\n\nBack to Top\n\nAustria\n\nBackground. The pandemic began to spread in Austria since March, 2020 and the country was under the first lockdown during March 16- April 12. A gradual re-opening of the economy started after April 13, from small shops, construction and garden centers, while other stores and hairdressers were allowed to open at the beginning of May. Some re-opening process was accelerated due to low infection rates, such as the reopening of the borders with Germany, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary from June 5. On 16 June, traveling restrictions were lifted for most European countries. Adhering to EU policies, Austria lifted a travel ban with 15 countries, with the notable exceptions of US, Brazil, India, and Russia.\n\nSubsequent lockdowns. Since reopening, daily new cases significantly rose and, in October, surpassed the previous peak in March with the effective reproductive rate of above 1. A pickup in the infection rate prompted the authorities to reintroduce containment measures, including reintroducing mandatory mask since July. The authorities eventually announced a partial second lockdown between November 3 and December 6. This lockdown was subsequently tightened from November 17 and new cases have begun to decline again. The second lockdown has been less strict than the first. Industry and manufacturing remain open while restaurants, bars, non-essential shops, hairdressers, and schools are closed. Another lockdown was implemented during December 26 to January 18 and has been extended to February 8. From January 25, a higher-grade face masks (FFP2) are mandated in certain public areas, including air transportation. During April 1-May 17, some provinces (Vienna, Burgenland) have been under the light lockdown.\n\nVaccination. Austria had a slow start on vaccine administration but recently outpaced many other EA countries. As of May 5, 27 percent of population received at least one vaccine dose. Nonetheless, the process could slowdown from the supply disruption.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of June 3, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nIn 2020, the government announced one of the largest multi-year fiscal package in Europe, totaling 49.6 billion euros (12.6 percent of 2019 GDP) to support the economy. Financing includes support to the health care system, short-term work arrangement, liquidity support for firms (fixed cost subsidy, and loss compensation), and public loan guarantees. On the revenue side, the government announced deferral of personal and corporate income taxes, social security contributions (3 months), and VAT payments, as well as VAT reduction in some categories. In tandem with emergency support, the multi-year package also includes measures to jump start the economy, including investment in climate protection, affordable housing, health, and digitalization, innovation and research. The reduction of the lowest income tax rate from 25 to 20 percent, planned for 2021, was brought forward and made retroactive to January 2020. In 2020, majority of the spending was related to emergency support and these extraordinary measures resulted in the budget deficit of 8.9 percent of GDP.\n\nIn 2021, several emergency support measures have been extended in light of renewed lockdowns. They include a new phase of short-term work arrangement (June 2021), fixed cost subsidy, hardship fund for small businesses, revenue replacement, and unemployment assistance. At the same time, the budget envisages a significant amount of public investment as well as incentives for private investment to jump start the economy. Measures to reallocate labor including upskilling and retraining are also included. The latest 2021 stability program envisages a deficit of over 8 percent of GDP.\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nFor monetary policy at the currency union level, please see Euro Area section.\n\nThe Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) has declared readiness to supply sufficient cash to banks, ATM operators, and the economy in response to increased withdrawals. Working hours were extended to meet the increased demand. On March 18, the Financial Market Authority prohibited short sales for one month following the massive drop in prices on the Vienna Stock Exchange due to betting on covered share price losses and extended it on April 16 to May 18.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nNo measures.\n\nBack to Top\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nBackground. Azerbaijan has been adversely affected by COVID-19 and a collapse of oil prices. The authorities reported the first confirmed COVID-19 case on February 29, 2020.\n\nThe COVID-19 Operational Headquarters has been created under the Cabinet, Ministers and working groups within various ministries and at the CBA have been tasked with developing specific response measures. To contain the spread of COVID-19, the authorities introduced a special quarantine regime (state of emergency) starting March 24. It included border closures, mandatory quarantine of citizens returning from abroad, prohibition of mass gatherings, restriction of domestic movements; closure of retail outlets, airports, and transportation hubs; social distancing, and disinfection of public spaces.\n\nReopening of the economy. Starting May 4, 2020, the authorities began a staged relaxation of restrictions, enabling many businesses, facilities, and public areas to reopen and reestablishing freedom of private vehicular travel between cities and districts. On June 19, as new COVID-19 cases rose with the reopening (with cases doubling between June 1-18), the authorities announced retightening of the quarantine regime (including the closure of borders until August 1, closure of establishments such as shopping malls, cinemas, and museums in the capital and big cities, and requiring permits for people to leave their homes in these cities). On July 17, the special quarantine regime was extended in 13 cities and districts until August 31, with tighter provisions in place until August 5. With new inflections starting to decline in early August, the authorities relaxed some of the lockdown restrictions. On August 29, the special quarantine regime was extended until September 30. On September 28, in response to a rise in the number of new coronavirus cases, Azerbaijan has extended some of its lockdown restrictions until November 2 and decided to keep its borders closed. On November 19, following further rise in covid infections, Azerbaijan extend lockdown restrictions until December 28, 2020. On December 14, 2020, the new quarantine measures became effective and the special quarantine regime was extended until January 31, 2021. In January 2021, COVID vaccination started. As of end June, 1.3 million residents ( 12.9 percent of the population) have been fully vaccinated. Starting on June 10, Azerbaijan has eased air travel restrictions on visitors of Turkey and Russia. Baku metro and inter-city public transport resumed operations, and large shopping centers, places of worship, gyms and health centers have reopened, though with certain restrictions on the number of visitors.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of July 1, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nIn 2020, the authorities have increased budget spending on public health by AzN 0.37 bn (0.5 percent of GDP). This includes scaling up medical facilities (AzN 0.25 bn) with ten modular hospitals to be built adding 2,000 beds; purchase medical supplies & equipment, payment of allowances/benefits to medical workers (AzN 0.1 bn); and creation of a COVID Response Fund for public health needs with public and private sector contributions (total AzN 114 million or 0.14 percent of GDP, with government transfer of AzN 20 million (.02 percent of GDP). Azerbaijan's government has also provided AzN 8.5 million ($5 million) to the COVID-19 Fund as part of the WHO’s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan.\n\nOn April 4, the authorities announced support to the affected businesses and individuals in the amount of AzN 3.3 billion (4.85 percent of GDP). Measures aimed at redressing damage to entrepreneurs and supporting incomes include: partial coverage of salaries (AzN 215 million); support to microentrepreneurs (AzN 80 million); temporary public jobs (AzN 54 million); subsistence and unemployment payments (AzN 230 million); pensions (AzN 200 million); targeted social assistance (AzN 4.5 million); energy and education subsidies (AzN 20 million); allocation of additional funds to the Entrepreneurship Development Fund (AzN 50 million).\n\nOn June 2, the President approved amendments to the Tax Code, providing tax benefits to businesses affected by the COVID pandemic(AzN 0.12 bn or 0.2 percent of GDP). The amendments grant a one-year exemption from land and property tax to selected sectors, including tourism, passenger road transportation, and cultural facilities. Income taxpayers will also receive a 75 percent exemption and taxpayers filing under simplified procedures a 50 percent exemption. Moreover, the rental property tax in the COVID-affected areas is reduced from 14 percent to 7 percent.\n\nOn June 23, the Cabinet of Ministers announced a one-time extension of social assistance announced as part of the April 4 relief package for the unemployed and low-income people who lost earnings because of the special quarantine regime. An additional lump-sum payment of AzN 190 was paid once to the individuals who received social assistance under the April 4 relief package.\n\nOn August 6, the parliament passed a revised 2020 budget which reflected a lower oil price ($35 a barrel) and growth assumptions (-5 percent). The transfer from the Oil Fund was increased by AzN 850 million to offset lower state budget (SB) revenues, while SB expenditures were increased by some AzN 600 million. Overall, the projected 2020 SB deficit has increased from AzN 2.8 billion to AzN 3.4 billion (4.8 percent of GDP), while the consolidated government deficit increases from AzN 1.9 billion to AzN 8.4 billion (11.9 percent of GDP). However, mainly reflecting higher oil price and spending control, actual deficit for 2020 turned out to be lower than projected,, with state budget deficit reaching 1.74 billion (2.4 percent of GDP) and consolidated budget deficit AzN 4.8 billion (9.2 percent of GDP).\n\nThe 2021 budget assumes a consolidated budget deficit of AzN 7.35 billion (8.6 percent of GDP). The budget has allocated another AzN 261 million (0.3 percent of GDP) for fighting the pandemic.\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nOn March 19, 2020, the CBA left the refinancing rate unchanged at 7¼ percent, but raised the floor of the interest rate corridor (within a de facto floor system) by 125 bps to 6¾ percent.\n\nOn May 1, the CBA lowered the ceiling of the interest rate corridor by 100 bps to 8 percent. The authorities have extended the blanket deposit guarantee until December 4, 2020. The guarantee covers all manat (foreign currency) deposits within a 10 (2½) percent interest rate cap.\n\nOn June 19, the CBA lowered the refinancing rate by 25 bps to 7 percent, lowered the ceiling of the interest rate corridor to 7½ percent, and lowered the floor of the corridor by 25 bps to 6½ percent.\n\nOn July 30, the CBA lowered the refinancing rate by 25 bps to 6¾ percent, and similarly shifted the floor and ceiling of the corridor downwards to 6¼ and 7¼, respectively.\n\nOn September 18, the CBA lowered the refinancing rate by 25 bps to 6½ percent, and similarly adjusted the ceiling and floor rates to maintain a +/- 50 bps interest rate corridor.\n\nOn December 18, the CBA lowered the refinancing rate by 25 bp to 6 ¼ percent. The floor of the interest rate corridor was set as 5.75%, and the ceiling as 6.75%.\n\nOn April 23, 2020, the CBA undertook several measures to assist the financial sector. This included: (I) a relaxation of capital requirements (system wide and the countercyclical capital buffer) and risk weights on mortgage loans; (ii) a moratorium on late fees and interest rate penalties; (iii) guarantees on insurance premiums; and (iv) suspension of inspections of credit institutions.\n\nOn April 27, the CBA appointed temporary administrators in four banks. Two of the banks were closed on April 28, with the other two closed on May 12.\n\nOn May 19, the CBA signed a $200 million swap agreement with the EBRD, aimed at improving the flow of financial resources to the real sector. The swap enables the EBRD to provide domestic currency credit support to local companies, including for short-term liquidity needs, working capital, and restructuring of exposure for existing clients, as well as trade finance and emergency support to key infrastructure providers.\n\nIn January 2021, the CBA has lifted some measures: inspections at credit institutions that were suspended in 2020 resumed, and additional capital requirements for consumer loans were reinstated. Blanket deposit guarantee was replaced with limited guarantee program.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nThe CBA, with the participation of the State Oil Fund, has conducted scheduled and extraordinary foreign exchange auctions, and has satisfied all demands for foreign currency at the announced 1.7 AzN/US$ rate.\n\nLinks\n\nMinistry of Health of the Azerbaijan Republic\n\nMinistry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Azerbaijan\n\nKoronavirus.az\n\nCabinet of Ministers News Updates\n\nB\n\nBack to Top\n\nThe Bahamas\n\nBackground. The Bahamas has so far reported 11,849 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 230 deaths (as of May 30 2021). After successfully suppressing the initial spread, the reopening of international borders in July 2020 coincided with a sharp and prolonged rise in infections. Weekend lockdown measures, initiated in October, in worst hit islands curtailed the prolonged rise in new cases, as testing capacity and tracing also improved. As cases fell, travel and lockdown restrictions were gradually rolled back. Fully vaccinated international and domestic travelers are now exempt from testing requirements and allowed to resume indoor dining. The Bahamas received 20,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as a donation from the Indian government on March 10, and 67,200 doses thus far of the 100,000 purchased through COVAX . The Bahamas is currently experiencing a third wave, averaging above 40 new cases per day – roughly one-third that of pandemic highs. Since March, hospitalizations have also been rising again (55 persons on May 30).\n\nKey Policy Responses as of June 1, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nThe government is implementing various support measures totaling B$436 million (3.9 percent of GDP), including (i) B$25 million for health care, (ii) B$5 million for food programs, (iii) B$145 million for income support for job loss workers and self-employed , (iv) B$54 million to support business loans to SMEs with an additional B$5 million allocated to grants to assist with payroll expenses, (v) B$141 million to provide tax deferrals and credits to companies with a minimum of 25 employees and annual sales of B$3 million that retain at least 80 percent of staff, and (vi) B$1.8 million to support to Family Islands (specifically to be used for any COVID-19 related expenditure). So far , B$101 million (0.8 percent of GDP) of these measures were executed in FY2019/20, and B$195 million (1.7 percent of GDP) during FY2021Q1 – Q3.\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nStarting in March 2020, the Central Bank of The Bahamas (CBOB) arranged with domestic banks and credit unions to provide a 3-month deferral against repayments on credit facilities for businesses and households that were negatively impacted by the pandemic. Some financial institutions announced credit support extending well beyond the 3-month period.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nFor commercial banks, the ceiling on the Bahamian open position on foreign exchange transactions has been relaxed to the maximum of 5 percent of Tier-11 capital, removing the more binding limit of B$5 million on net long exposures that constrained most institutions.\n\nThe CBOB suspended approval of applications to purchase foreign currency for transactions via the Investment Currency Market (ICM) and the Bahamas Depositary/Depository Receipt (BDR) program. Both programs fund external portfolio investments.\n\nThe CBOB requested the National Insurance Board to repatriate some of its external assets, excluding any exposures to Bahamas and Caribbean domestic issuers.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBahrain\n\nBackground. Bahrain implemented a swift and well-coordinated policy response, which limited the spread of the virus, delivered rapid and widespread access to vaccinations, and extended targeted income and liquidity support to those in most need. The vaccination campaign began in December 2020 and are being administered at a rate of 119.2 doses per 100 people at end-June 2021, placing Bahrain among the best performing countries in delivering vaccinations. Despite the rapid vaccine rollout, a second wave of cases hit the country starting in early 2021. Bahrain has avoided strict lockdowns during the pandemic, but the authorities reintroduced a range of health containment measures to curb recent infection waves in the first half of 2021. Measures include closure of all non-essential retail businesses and limiting indoor activities in various high-contact sectors to vaccinated customers, halting in-person education, banning of social gatherings, and re-instating remote work schedules for public administration employees. In addition, in May 2021 Bahrain limited entry to travelers from some countries where COVID cases have recently increased.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of June 29, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nA fiscal package was first introduced on March 17, 2020 with measures totaling about 6 percent of GDP, including a budget appropriation to cover urgent health-related needs. The initial package was for three months, but throughout 2020 was subsequently extended and increasingly targeted to support sectors and individuals hit hardest by the crisis.\n\nMeasures in the 2020 fiscal package included: (i) payment of salaries for Bahrainis working in the private sector (financed by the unemployment fund); (ii) subsidizing of electricity and water bills for individuals and companies; (iii) redirecting Tamkeen (a semi-autonomous government agency that finances SMEs) programs to support adversely affected micro and small enterprises; (iv) doubling of the size of the liquidity fund to support SMEs; (v) excepting industrial and commercial entities from paying government fees; (vi) exempting tourist facilities from tourism fees; and (vii) extending support to workers in the transportation and education sectors.\n\nDuring 2021, parts of the fiscal support package have been extended through August 2021, including: (i) payment of salaries of Bahrainis in the private sector (financed by Tamkeen and the Unemployment Fund); (ii) financial support to SMEs through Tamkeen; (iii) fees exemptions for tourist facilities; (iv) municipality fees exemptions for affected commercial entities; (v) waivers on commercial registration fees; (vi) rent exemptions for tenants of government-owned companies and properties; and (vii) fees exemption to set up and operate e-stores. In addition, the authorities launched a national employment program aimed at creating private sector jobs and training the workforce.\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nOn March 17, 2020, the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) temporarily expanded its zero-interest lending facility to banks by up to BD3.7 billion (US$10 billion or 29 percent of GDP) to facilitate deferred loan repayments and extension of additional credit. The CBB also cut its one-week deposit facility rate (in line with the US FED) from 2.25 to 1.0 percent, the overnight deposit rate from 2.0 to 0.75 percent, and the overnight lending rate from 4.0 to 2.45 percent.\n\nOther key financial sector measures included: (i) reducing the cash reserve ratio for retail banks from 5 to 3 percent; (ii) relaxing loan-to-value ratios for new residential mortgages; (iii) capping fees on debit card payments; (iv) extending the number of past due days for stage 1 expected credit loss (ECL) classification to 74 days, excluding the six-months loan moratorium; (v) reducing the cooling off period for reclassifying restructured facilities from Stage 3 to Stage 2 from 12 months to 3 months; (vi) reducing the risk weight of loans to SMEs from 75 to 25 percent; and (vii) reducing the minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirements for all locally incorporated banks from 100 to 80 percent.\n\nFinally, the CBB implemented blanket deferrals on private sector loan repayments (both principal and interest) from March to August 2020, which were subsequently extended several times, with the latest deferral phase in place until December 2021.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nNo measures.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBangladesh\n\nBackground. Bangladesh reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 on March 8, 2020. Several measures such as general holidays, restricted movement, closures, mandatory wearing of masks etc. were put in place to contain the spread. In August 2020, Bangladesh witnessed its first wave under the pandemic. Daily new infection cases had been on the decline since end-November 2020, however, new cases rapidly increased starting March 2021 through the first week of April 2021 reflecting the second wave. A country-wide lockdown has been in place since April 14, 2021. This lockdown has been less strict allowing for public and private offices, and some industries to remain operational although transportation has been limited along with border control measures in place. Bangladesh is now at the onset of the third wave. The positivity rate has reached 25 percent which is higher than the peaks in April 2021 (23 percent) and in August last year (24 percent). The infection rate, in districts bordering India, is much higher than the rest of the country and testing remains limited. The government has announced a seven-day strict lockdown from July 1 through July 7 during which all government, semi-government, autonomous, and private offices will remain closed, excepting those that provide emergency services. All transportation, except emergency service providers, will remain suspended. However, industries are expected to remain operational, maintaining health protocols. As of June 30, 5.9 million persons had received their first vaccine dose while 4.3 million had received their second. New registrations have remained suspended since May 7. The third wave could dampen the recent pick up in exports. Remittances had initially declined around the onset of the pandemic but have steadily increased during FY21 partly reflecting the central bank's incentives to repatriate funds through official channels.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of July 1, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nAt end-March 2020, the Ministry of Finance issued a revised budget for FY20, including Tk. 2.5 billion in additional resources, to fund the Ministry of Health's COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan and expand the existing transfer programs that benefit the poor. Increased allocation was made to the Open Market Sale program to facilitate the purchase of rice at one-third the market price. On March 31, the Ministry of Finance announced a Tk. 50 billion (about US$ 588 million) stimulus package for exporting industries to be channeled through Bangladesh Bank (BB) and distributed by the commercial banks at a 2 percent service charge. This special fund, for worker's salary support, was disbursed through mobile financial services and bank accounts benefitting close to 4 million workers over a four-month period. The Ministry of Finance is also subsidizing interest payments on working capital loans of up to Tk. 600 billion (about US$ 7.1 billion) provided by scheduled banks to businesses. On April 15 2020, the Prime Minister announced the allocation of Tk. 21.3 billion (about US$ 250.9 million) under a housing scheme for the homeless, Tk.15 billion (about US$ 176.7 million) for the poor who faced job losses from the pandemic, Tk.7.5 billion (about US$ 88.3 million) to provide health insurance for government employees most at risk, and Tk. 1 billion (about US$ 11.8 million) in bonus payments for public health workers treating COVID-19 patients. The Prime Minister has also announced that Tk. 20 billion (about US$ 235.6 million) in interest payments on behalf of 13.8 million loan recipients negatively impacted by the national shutdown will be covered by the government. In January 2021, the government increased the COVID-19 Emergency Response and Pandemic Preparedness Project costs by Tk 56.6 billion (about US$ 666.7 million) mostly reflecting the procurement, preservation, and distribution of vaccines. The government has announced two additional stimulus packages - Tk. 15 billion for the micro credit and marginal people's lifestyle development program, and Tk. 12 billion for the old age and widow allowance expansion program. In the first week of May 2021, the government announced its second-round cash assistance program of Tk. 9.3 billion for the targeted population who lost their jobs from the ongoing lockdown. Thus far, Tk. 390.7 billion (about US$ 4.6 billion) of fiscal stimulus has been announced, of which Tk.186 billion (about US$ 2.2 billion) has been disbursed as of end-April, 2021. In addition, the National Board of Revenue has suspended duties and taxes on imports of medical supplies, including protective equipment and test kits. The FY22 Budget includes higher allocations (in Taka) for health, agriculture, and social safety net programs, although effective targeting remains a challenge. As a precautionary measure, the government has decided that 25 percent of budgetary allocations for development projects will be placed on hold, affecting low-priority projects. It has approached donors seeking budget support.\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nTo ensure adequate liquidity in the financial system, in March 2020, BB announced the purchase of treasury bonds and bills from banks. The repo rate was successively cut from 6 percent to 4.75 percent over three cuts from March to July. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks was reduced on both a daily (from 5 to 3.5 percent) and a bi-weekly basis (from 5.5 to 4 percent). The CRR was also cut for offshore banking operations, effective July 1, and for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs), effective June 1. The advance-deposit ratio and investment-deposit ratio was raised by 2 percent to facilitate credit to the private sector and improve liquidity. The Export Development Fund was raised from US$ 3.5 billion to US$ 5 billion, with the interest rate slashed to 1.75 percent and the refinancing limit increased. BB has created several refinancing schemes totaling Tk 415 billion (about US$ 4.9 billion), a 360-day tenor special repo facility, and a credit guarantee scheme for exporters, farmers, and SMEs to facilitate the implementation of the government's stimulus packages. In addition, BB has taken measures to delay non-performing loan classification, relax loan rescheduling policies, waive credit card fees and interests, suspend loan interest payments, relax credit risk rating rules for banks, extend tenures of trade instruments, lower farm loan interest rate and allow short-term farm loan rescheduling, and ensure access to financial services. BB imposed an additional 1.0 percent general provision against loans that have enjoyed deferral/time extension facilities.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nForeign exchange rules were eased by BB to: (i) provide foreign currency to Bangladeshi nationals facing problems while returning home due to travel disruptions; and (ii) allow foreign owned/controlled companies operating in Bangladesh to access short term working capital loans from their parent companies/shareholders abroad to meet actual needs for payments of wages and salaries. International factoring was introduced to accelerate exports. BB has been intervening in the foreign exchange market to keep the exchange rate relatively stable following the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBarbados\n\nBackground. The government took swift actions to contain the spread of the virus. Within days of the first confirmed case (March 16, 2020), measures to activate isolation and treatment centers, impose limits on public gatherings, and establish supplementary medical facilities were taken. On April 3, a 24-hour curfew became effective restricting non-essential personnel to their residences and closing non-essential businesses. Enhanced screening measures are in place at all ports of entry but the mandatory 14-day quarantine for all travelers arriving in Barbados has been replaced with a testing program to facilitate the resumption of tourism. Spillovers from the global pandemic to the critical tourism sector have been significant with the shut-down of commercial airlift at end-March 2021, which resulted in widespread labor furloughs and temporary hotel closures. Commercial airlift resumed on a limited basis in July but prospects for the recovery of tourism remain highly uncertain. The virtual collapse in tourism during the global pandemic—which accounts for 40 percent of economic activity—resulted in a 18 percent collapse in economic activity in 2020. The outlook for 2021 is highly uncertain following a resurgence of COVID-19 cases that necessitated the imposition of a second national lockdown in February.\n\nReopening of the Economy. The authorities adopted a four-phase approach to reopen the economy following the national lockdown in March 2020. The strategy ranges from a complete lockdown (Phase 1) to a phased removal of social and economic restrictions (during Phase 2 and3) ending with a resumption of life as normal once the population has been adequately vaccinated (Phase 4). The implementation of the National Vaccination strategy got underway in the second half of February 2021 with roughly 35 percent of Barbados' adult population fully (double) vaccinated to date (47 percent with a single dose). The rollout of the national vaccination program will continue as swiftly as access to vaccine supplies allows.\n\nKey Policy Responses as of July 1, 2021\n\nFiscal\n\nThe Government of Barbados (GoB) has pursued a targeted fiscal response to the COVID-19 health crisis aimed at protecting lives and livelihoods. The response to the pandemic has been phased and tailored to the evolution of the health crisis and magnitude of the economic fallout. Initial investments in health equipment and quarantine facilities in early 2020 were followed by expanded welfare payments to protect vulnerable households through the introduction of the Household Survival Program. Liquidity support was extended to the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) via the repurchase of government bonds to ensure adequate resources were available to accommodate a surge in unemployment benefit and severance claims. To support the tourism sector, which has been dealt a particularly heavy blow by the pandemic, the authorities created the Barbados Employment and Sustainable Transformation (BEST) plan. A 12-month COVID relief jobs program was also rolled out to generate contractual employment opportunities that promote health safety and boost food production, while targeted cash transfers frameworks were extended to small businesses and vendors affected by the second national pause in February 2021.\n\nWhile the Government of Barbados remains firmly committed to its long-term debt reduction goals that underpin the ongoing financial arrangement with the IMF, the unprecedented economic impact of the health crisis has required a flexible approach in the setting of fiscal policy and reform priorities. On balance, the pandemic response prompted the government to lower its primary balance target to minus 1 percent of GDP for FY2020/21 (compared to a surplus of 6 percent of GDP envisaged prior to the pandemic, and a surplus of 3 percent target announced during the March 2020 budget presentation). The FY2021/22 budget targets a primary surplus of about ¼ percent of GDP reflecting still weak economic conditions and ongoing expenditure needs as the fallout from the COVID-19 shock persists.\n\nMonetary and macro-financial\n\nThe Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) announced a series of measures (effective April 1, 2020) to help support commercial banks and other deposit-taking institution manage the economic fallout from the coronavirus shock. Specifically: i) the Bank’s discount rate at which it provides overnight lending to banks and deposit-taking non-banks licensed under the Financial Institutions Act was reduced from 7 percent to 2 percent; ii) the securities ratio for banks was lowered from 17.5 percent to 5 percent; iii) the 1.5 percent securities ratio for non-bank deposit taking licensees was eliminated; and, iv) the Bank indicated it stands ready to make collateralized loans for up to six months as liquidity support for licensees. These measures follow an agreement brokered by the GoB for commercial banks to provide forbearance in the form a 6-month debt-payment moratorium for individuals and business directly impacted by COVID-19 (expired end-September). Banks are now working with individual borrowers as needed on further repayment extensions.\n\nExchange rate and balance of payments\n\nNo measures.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBelarus\n\nBackground. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on February 28, 2020. It unfolded the first wave until July 2020. Belarus' second wave of infections started in October 2020, and it peaked in December 2020–January 2021 at around 2,000 cases per day. It has proven hard to curb with new cases hovering around 1,200 per day until May. Since late May new cases are declining with a 7-day average of around 650 cases as of June 28, 2021. The government has been implementing a range of measures to delay the spread of the disease and to support individuals and businesses.\n\nContainment measures currently in place—limited relative to other countries—include travel restrictions, social distancing, and recommendations for schools, education, and workplaces. The Ministry of Health issued enhanced recommendations to businesses and non-profit organizations on social distancing, limiting any meeting with more than 5 participants and encouraging video conferencing. In some regions such as Minsk, there has also been a cancelation of public events and compulsory use of facial masks was introduced. In December 2020, Belarus decided to close its land border partially. Belarusian citizens and residents are temporarily prohibited from leaving the countries, except for a limited number of cases.\n\nThe National COVID-19 Vaccination Plan for 2021-2022 was approved in February 2021. Belarus has started vaccination with people working in health, education and social sector and plan to expand the plan to people most likely to develop a severe form of the disease, people in high-contact jobs, and the general public. On February 26, 2021, Belarus started producing Russian vaccines Sputnik on its soil, expecting to produce sufficient vaccines to start mass vaccination beginning in April 2021. As of June 26, 2021, 11.3 percent of the population has received one vaccination dose, and 7.5 percent are fully vaccinated. Belarus also aims at developing its own vaccine.\n\nIn addition to the impact of the Covid pandemic, Belarus faces headwinds due to a gradual loss of oil price subsidies from Russia through the “tax maneuver” till 2024 and the political stalemate following the presidential election of August 9, 2020.
