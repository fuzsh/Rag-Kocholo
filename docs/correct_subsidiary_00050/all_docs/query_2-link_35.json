        "text": "Reliable alternative for float switches\n\nThe LI level sensor is perfectly suited for the detection of level and leakage. Thanks to the capacitive measurement technology, the sensor has no moving parts. Malfunctioning caused by deposits on the mechanical parts is thus excluded, saving maintenance costs and time.\n\nPlug & play point level switch with digital communication\n\nThe basic settings on delivery are suitable for use in oils or water, so that a plug & play installation can be carried out in these cases. In addition, the sensor can be adapted as required via IO-Link. The sensor also detects the temperature of the medium and transmits it digitally via IO-Link.\n\nWHG approval\n\nThe versions of the LI21x series are approved to DIBt and have an approval according to the German Federal Water Act (WHG). The law serves to protect surface water, groundwater and coastal water. Especially when it comes to the storage of substances hazardous to water, the tanks and the sensors installed on them must have WHG approval."
