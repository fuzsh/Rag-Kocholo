        "text": "The 32 per cent of the renewable energy group held within the Develop Australia fund managed by the Industry Funds Management group (part of the larger Industry Fund Services, or IFS, group Weaven leads) could, if he maintains his position, thwart the Spanish group's ability to achieve its 90 per cent minimum acceptance condition.\n\nFuelling the suspicion of the former ACTU heavyweight's motives are conversations IFM has had with Acciona's advisers, in which IFM had intimated its willingness to do some kind of deal that would give it an ongoing interest in the assets in return for its acceptance of the bid.\n\nIt could appear that Weaven is trying to use the leverage of a blocking stake to extract a special benefit for IFM.\n\nThe probable explanation for his stance, however, is not sinister and indeed is straightforward. Weaven and his client base - the big end of the industry fund sector - like Pacific Hydro and its renewable energy assets. They are keen on infrastructure assets generally and can't get enough of them.\n\nThe funds aren't profit-averse and would walk away from their investment with a massive profit if they accepted the bid. The problem they would face, however, is what to do with the $225 million cash that would be released.\n\nThe industry funds within the IFS stable are big, with average assets under management of about $6 billion. They are also growing at a compound rate of about 20 per cent each year. Those funds need to be invested.\n\nIndustry funds were among the earliest and most enthusiastic investors in infrastructure. They weren't deterred by its illiquidity because they see themselves as long-term, patient, socially responsible investors. Now, everyone is on bandwagon because of low correlations between infrastructure/alternative assets and traditional equities and fixed interest securities and the superior long-term returns.\n\nIt hasn't been widely noted but, a decade after establishing the Develop Australia Fund to invest in local infrastructure assets, IFS has started channelling funds offshore. IFM was a co-investor, alongside Macquarie Bank vehicles, in last year's $3.1 billion acquisition of the Wales & The West Gas Distribution Network from Britain's National Grid Transco and the similar-sized purchase of National Transcommunications and NTL Digital, also in Britain.\n\nIFM's industry fund investors like renewables, which they see as a sector with long-term growth potential and one that is socially responsible. They particularly like Pacific Hydro, which they helped develop into the third largest independent renewable energy group in the world, with wind and hydro operations in Australia, the Philippines and Chile.\n\nThere is no doubt that for conventional investors the $4.50 in cash for each share that Acciona has put on the table is attractive. It represents a 43.6 per cent premium to prices before announcing the strategic review which led to the recommended bid. More particularly, it is arguable Pacific Hydro's operations are worth perhaps $3 a share, which implies the Spaniards are offering $1.50 a share for the pipeline of potential projects. Those projects will require a lot of capital if they are to be developed.\n\nThe industry funds, however, would be happy to help finance Pacific Hydro's growth - they don't need more cash, they need more investments.\n\nIf they can't remain investors in the company - and neither Weaven nor his client base is likely to want to be locked-in minority shareholders in a Spanish-controlled subsidiary of a European-listed company - they would like Acciona to offer them equivalent exposure to renewables through some form of alliance.\n\nThere is a problem in matching their ambitions. IFM can't offer operational expertise, only funding the Spaniards don't appear to need. Weaven and the industry funds shouldn't, however, be underestimated, given their vast financial resources and Weaven's pivotal role in the creation and growth of the industry funds sector and the dynamic IFS group.\n\nDespite the board recommendation and agreement to a $6 million break fee, and the sale by the other big shareholder, US group AEP, of a 15.7 per cent interest in Pacific Hydro to Acciona, it isn't inconceivable that there could be a contest for control.\n\nNeither Macquarie Bank nor AGL was prepared to submit to Pacific Hydro's conditions for conducting due diligence. Either could form an alliance with IFM to privatise and share exposures to the business.\n\nWeaven's instant and deliberately public rejection of the Acciona offer may not have been designed only as an invitation to Acciona to deal; it may have been an attempt to attract other players with whom IFM would find it easier to create a structure which would allow the industry funds a continuing exposure to a set of assets that are uniquely appealing to them and which would be extraordinarily difficult to replicate."
