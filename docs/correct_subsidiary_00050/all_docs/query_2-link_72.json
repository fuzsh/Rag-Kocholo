        "text": "One of the commodities we all need is water. As a basic utility good, the water works on the Monopoly board, water is ready-made for long-term financing with large upfront capex needs and stable long-term cashflows. The sector is as sensitive as any other to rising interest rates and rising construction costs. The halving of the share price of Nextera Energy Partners in recent days is a salutary reminder of the ups and downs of development activity. But with water there really is no option.\n\nDesalination is one part of the water sector that lends itself readily to project finance. Schemes tend to be procured and built on a single asset basis. Only this week yet another mega independent water project (IWP) was signed, the 818,280m3/day Hassyan 2 scheme in Dubai. The project, one of the world's largest, will cost Dh3.357bn (US$914m) and was bid at a tariff of US$0.36536/m3. Project financing for the asset is expected to be led by MUFG and Standard Chartered.\n\nThere is plenty of IWP activity in the Gulf. Last month, the Rabigh 4 600,000m3/day scheme was signed in Saudi Arabia, a SR2.543bn (US$678m) project with debt totalling SR2.045bn, or 80% of the cost, provided by Standard Chartered, Saudi National Bank, Riyad Bank, Saudi Investment Bank and Bank of China. There are plenty of other IWPs in the region plus a host of other water-linked schemes in areas such as water pipelines and sewerage treatment works.\n\nThe other main market for desalination IWP projects has been Chile, to feed the water requirements of mining companies in desert areas. Australia has various assets, with the Sydney plant being an important strategic asset backing security of supply when local water levels are low, which was not presumably the case last year.\n\nIt is possible the demand for desalination will leap higher across the globe in the coming years if the hydrogen revolution takes off. Hydrogen projects need fresh as opposed to sea water and plenty of it. The fresh water cannot be supplied by rivers and I am not sure that would be a good idea in any case. Indeed, hopefully there is enough sea water to desalinate.\n\nBut that is for the future. In the here and now there is an interesting debate on how projects can be financed in the UK – either via a regulated asset base (RAB) model or concession/PPP type structures. The storm over Thames Water and its finances earlier this summer focused on how the company managed to ramp up significant debts, £15bn, under the regulated RAB model. Indeed, many if not all the UK water companies were able to raise leverage over the decades, if not to the same extent.\n\nWith the new five-year business plans for the next regulatory period submitted to water regulator Ofwat this week, financing new capital expenditure is key – alongside trying to keep the water bills down. Water companies are perceived to have under-invested in recent times and now is the time to put the best foot forward. New equity is being raised by many if not all the companies. Despite the woes in the sector, international investors are still coming. Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) put £500m into Severn Trent this week.\n\nBut regulator Ofwat, which has been hit by criticism too about the performance of the sector, is pushing hard for its third-party PPP-style direct procurement for customers (DPC) route to be used for capital expenditure over £100m. Water company responses have been interesting. On the one hand, Ofwat had to rein back the sector during the summer from applying for too many DPCs in their business plans. It was not meant for smart meters, for example. On the other hand, there is the standard utility reaction to handing over operations to outside parties – Severn Trent, for example, has reservations about its Minworth water recycling SRO being made available to a third party operating \"an aspect of our largest treatment works\", it said. \"However, we understand the policy aim and we will look to mitigate potential risks through contract terms.\"\n\nPlenty of DPC schemes have been put forward in the business plans. At a time when renewable developers are suffering from higher costs and the construction market is under pressure, the water sector could be a real spur to growth. The £1.75bn Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme (HARP) DPC tender is already under way. RAB has its proponents but PPP/DPC procurement can be more tightly focused. In one case, the Fens reservoir, it is DPC versus the specified infrastructure project regulation (SIPR) model used to finance the £4bn plus Thames Tideway Tunnel scheme.\n\nWhat about Thames itself? All the very detailed business plans of the water companies have been put up on the Ofwat website to see. The Yorkshire Water plan had some redactions but otherwise it was a good show. Apart from Thames, which has put up a 13-page summary. Oh."
