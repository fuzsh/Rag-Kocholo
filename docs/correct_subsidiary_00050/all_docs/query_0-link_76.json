In one case we had a particularly thorny issue and canvassed all the premiere tax lawyers in this space and Heather Cooper and Philip Tingle were the only ones who provided a clear practical solution that saved us millions.’\n\n‘I have worked across the table from Joel Hugenberger and he is worth mentioning here.
