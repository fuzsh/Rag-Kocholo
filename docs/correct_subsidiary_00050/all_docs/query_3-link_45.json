        "meta_description": "Hydroelectric power in California is broken down into two categories: large hydro, which are facilities larger than 30 megawatts (MW), and small hydro. Small hydro plants qualify as renewable energy under the Renewables Portfolio Standard. The annual hydropower production in California varies yearly and depends on rainfall.",

        "text": "Hydro facilities smaller than 30 MW of generation capacity are small hydro. Utilities such as Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District operate the small hydro facilities.\n\nLarge hydro projects are those larger than 30 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the state's Department of Water Resources operate large hydro plants in California such as Folsom Dam, Oroville Dam, and Shasta Dam.\n\nCaliforniaâ€™s hydro generation plants are mostly in the eastern mountain ranges. The state also imports its hydro-generated electricity from the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest."
