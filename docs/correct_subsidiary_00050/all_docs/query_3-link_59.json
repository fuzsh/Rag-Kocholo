As demand for renewable energy intensifies, utilities and companies are rapidly shifting focus to solar energy, offshore wind energy, hydropower, hydrogen, geothermal energy and energy storage.\n\nWe partner with clients facing ambitious low-carbon emissions goals to economically integrate renewable energy infrastructure. Our expertise is broad and diverse, bringing together experts in planning, environmental, regulatory and engineering services.\n\nIn Texas, we’re collaborating with Invenergy on the largest solar energy project in U.S. history to provide clean energy to three municipalities and five mega-companies. In the Pacific Northwest, we’re upgrading hydroelectric generators to help Seattle City Light maintain carbon neutral status."
