        "text": "Government plans to alter the renewable energy target (RET) and a drop in electricity demand has seen prominent fund manager IFM Investors accept a $685 million writedown on its Pacific Hydro clean energy subsidiary, The Australian Financial Review reports.\n\nIFM -- owned by 30 super funds, including Cbus, HostPlus and Australian Super – said the latest review of the RET had hurt confidence in the renewables sector.\n\n“There’s two primary factors [impacting the Australian assets] a ­lowering of energy demand and ­uncertainty around the current laws,” IFM chief executive Brett Himbury said, according to the AFR.\n\n“It’s a great shame that at a time when the likes of President Obama are saying there’s no bigger challenge for the globe than climate change we’ve got this policy uncertainty.”\n\nThe news will likely result in IFM’s Australian Infrastructure Fund losing 5 per cent of its value for the most recent quarter."
