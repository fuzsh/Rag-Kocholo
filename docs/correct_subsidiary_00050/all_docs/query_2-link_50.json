        "text": "Higher resolution, revised design\n\nThe new pressure sensors, which are available with different measuring ranges from vacuum to 100 bar, communicate via IO-Link 1.1 and offer a resolution of about 20,000 steps. This is especially important for applications where differential pressures are measured and thus only a small part of the measuring range can be used. Temperature compensation has also been improved in the new series.\n\nEven seemingly small improvements to the design of a sensor can have a big impact in the application. For example, the vent hole on the new pressure sensor has been offset by 90Â° and is now located on the side when mounted conventionally. This prevents condensate, for example, from collecting on the membrane of the vent hole and causing soiling or impairing the function. The PI has also been optimised in terms of user-friendliness: the new operating concept with three pushbuttons makes parameter setting much more convenient and thus also faster."
