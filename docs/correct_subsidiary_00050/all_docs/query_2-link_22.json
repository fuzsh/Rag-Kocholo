        "text": "PORTFOLIO POINT: IFM’s Garry Weaven says there are plenty of attractively priced infrastructure deals seeking financing.\n\nLast week Michael Delaney, the boss of Australia’s top super fund, MTAA, told us Garry Weaven at Industry Funds Management was sitting “in the sweet spot” as distressed owners of global infrastructure were suddenly looking for buyers. So we obviously thought we should check with Weaven – and thereby gain some insight into the problems facing the imploding Babcock & Brown empire.\n\nIndustry Funds Management is itself an interesting story, the child of the industry superannuation funds that is becoming a major player in its own right. IFM is now the number-two player in the Australian wholesale infrastructure market behind Macquarie; but with plans to be considerably more, having opened offices in London and New York.\n\nIFM has about $18 billion under management, with more than $7 billion of that in infrastructure, and it’s growing at more than 20% per annum. Here’s a major player with funds to invest with more projects now worth investing in.\n\nAs Weaven told us, IFM no longer has to ration the deals available to its clients.\n\nBut talking to him, you do begin to wonder about who would be selling infrastructure projects right now, unless they had to. Babcock & Brown itself '¦ well, the market is shouting the reality of its situation, but there’s also the curious case of Babcock & Brown Wind, which announced this week it was selling its Spanish wind farms (17% of its portfolio) in a curious exercise of selling the farm to prove the farm was worth owning.\n\nLike Delaney, Weaven casts doubt on the viability of listed infrastructure funds and retail-level access to infrastructure investments. To see if you agree with Weaven’s stance on self-managed super funds, read on.\n\nThe interview\n\nMichael Pascoe: In last Friday's Eureka Report MTAA’s Michael Delaney says that despite the turmoil in listed infrastructure stocks there are a lot of good infrastructure offerings out there (see Mr Super's infrastructure call). What do you think?\n\nGarry Weaven: Since the first hints of the subprime crisis hit the airwaves in August last year, I'd say the game has turned completely on its head. Until this year we were in a position where our client industry super funds had a lot of money available to invest in infrastructure but we couldn't find enough well-priced deals that we were confident to put them into.\n\nNow the situation really is that there are plenty of deals that are quite attractive and the difficulty is finding sufficient funding. We do have excellent funding support from our clients but in part they're restoring their listed equity values and things like that, and so we can actually do with an additional raft of clients to fund all the potential deals that are now available. It's partly because of the market and it's also partly because of globalisation and now, having opened offices in London and New York, that means the total deal flow available to us is much, much higher than it was.\n\nWhat sort of infrastructure investments are you talking about?\n\nAcross the board because, obviously, there are a number of companies having severe problems in refinancing existing infrastructure assets, and not just infrastructure assets – properties are looking a little bit the same. At the same time, governments are finding the need to actually start to look at a few projects and try to do a few things. I've been complaining long and loud about the lack of government leadership in Australia for many years in terms of facilitating necessary infrastructure. It does appear to be turning around so that governments are needing to overcome the backlog of lack of spending in infrastructure.\n\nIs it possible to quantify the bottom-line difference in terms of the sort of yields that are now on offer that weren't on offer a year ago?\n\nWell, not really because as you know it's not a homogeneous asset class and so returns of 9% and 10%, or 10–11% are quite acceptable for very stable sorts of revenue flows at one end of the spectrum, and much higher rates of returns are required at the other.\n\nWith higher cash rates obviously it's necessary to try to get higher absolute rates but it's not as though the market has fallen in a heap; it's not as though there are fire sales all over the place. There aren't. There are a few semi-distressed sales and there are many other assets that may become available but in a much more orderly sale process and not a distress sale process. It needs to be seen what happens in the credit markets over the next 12 months. It wouldn't take much to convert ordinary sales into fire sales and I'm by no means certain that all of the worst financial news is out on the table.\n\nIs Industry Funds Management holding back in case things do become cheaper?\n\nWe are obliged in our clients’ interests; because they own us, we have to acquire at the pace that our clients are capable of funding. We wish they were capable of funding at a faster pace right now so we'll be deploying every dollar we can raise.\n\nHas the confidence of superannuation funds in super fund in infrastructure been damaged by the trouble that some of the obvious names – Babcock & Brown, for example – seem to be in?\n\nNo, I think our clients would have very high confidence in the infrastructure space still because it's done what it's supposed to do for them. In fact, the returns that we've been achieving consistently have prevented them from sinking too far into the mire of the listed equity space, and so it's been very good for them.\n\nBut you'd get a different answer if you asked mums and dads investing in the listed infrastructure space. It raises the interesting question of the very different motivation of different people investing in this space. I think some fund managers have sort of invested in it to try to create listed vehicles and they're probably geared very highly. Maybe they've got their eye on quick returns and performance pay and things of that nature. The mum and dad investors by and large treated it as an income-producing space so they've looked for dividends, which some of those listed funds have then borrowed to provide.\n\nOur clients are not at all interested in dividends; they're interested in long-term investment and long-term, relatively stable returns and, in particular, diversification away from the listed market. So they want equity returns but without the volatility and without the correlation with the listed market. We provided that so they're happy, but mums and dads are looking for stable dividends as well as capital stability; they would be very disappointed of course in the listed market.\n\nIs there any way for retail investors to get into infrastructure investments the way you get into it?\n\nArguably at some point we could offer a listed vehicle, but if what they're really wanting is dividends then that's not really what our objective is. Our objective has been to get assets that have a good yield but we're interested really in building the portfolio for the long term. I think retail investing has a very high cost to it. I'd suggest that what they should be doing is investing in superannuation funds. Why wouldn't you put every dollar you can into your super fund and hopefully into a fund that invests in turn with reliable infrastructure managers?\n\nWhat about DIY funds that are looking for a way into the business?\n\nWell, speaking of self-managed funds, they're too small to be efficiently managed from our point of view. But there might well be opportunity to create a specialist vehicle for all self-managed super funds – as long as they have the same expectations. If their expectation simply is to be short-term investors and play the market, that's totally at odds with the way we select assets in the infrastructure space.\n\nAre you becoming another MacBank?\n\nYou would have to ask them how they see us, but I hope they don't see us in that way. Without criticising MacBank in any way, I think they would see our style and strategy as somewhat different.\n\nAnd your fees are different too?\n\nWe believe our fees are significantly below the market.\n\nDoes it make sense to you, as an infrastructure investor, to see people looking to sell wind farms at the moment unless they had to? (Babcock & Brown recently sold a package of wind-power assets in Spain. Weaven, through the Industry Funds group, controls the Pacific Hydro wind-power group).\n\nNo. I think the government is absolutely locked in on that policy. They went to the people very squarely on the 20% by 2020 and I think that's locked in and that means massive investment in wind. It may mean investment in other renewables but at the moment wind is a very, very clear leader in the renewable space and so those companies that have expertise in that area are pretty well placed and they’re good assets, I would think; provided you didn't pay too much for them, they're good assets.\n\nAre you talking your own book as an early investor in this area?\n\nYes, absolutely, except we’re investors in that area precisely because we thought it was a good thing to do, the right thing to do, and a happy meeting of social responsibility and economic returns.\n\nHave you had a look at Babcock & Brown wind-farm offering?\n\nWe make no comment on what we look at or don't look at. What I do know is that Pacific Hydro, on a number of past occasions, has been unable to match the bids of others for particular wind farms. That was a source of some chagrin to us, but I think everything now is more realistically priced."
