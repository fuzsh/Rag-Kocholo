They were the first company in the United States to license, fabricate, install and operate a grid-connected hydrokinetic (zero-head) power project. In the U.S., they presently hold the development rights to 300 MW of hydropower capacity at existing non-powered dams, equivalent to the energy production from approximately 1,000 MW of solar power or 650 MW of wind power. In Latin America, they are presently involved in the development of 15 MW of new, low-impact hydropower capacity.",
