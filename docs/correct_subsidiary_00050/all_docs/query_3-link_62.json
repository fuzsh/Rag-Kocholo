        "text": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Hydropower Program is the largest generator of hydropower in the US, with 75 power-producing dams housing 356 individual generating units. USACEâ€™s hydropower assets generate more than 70 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean renewable energy. This clean energy is enough to power 10 cities the size of Seattle. Additionally, the revenue generated by the USACE hydropower fleet is used to repay the original construction costs of the hydropower projects and to fund the operation, maintenance and modernization investments of the hydropower fleet."
