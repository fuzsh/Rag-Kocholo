        "text": "The wait for cleaner, renewable energy is over.\n\nAt Pacific Blue, we are impatient for change – we believe in action on clean energy, renewable generation and climate change right now.\n\nPacific Blue is a 100% renewable energy generator. We only generate energy from renewable sources - wind, solar and hydro.\n\nWhile you can’t choose where the energy in your house comes from, you can choose who to support. When you sign up to an energy plan through our retail business, you’re creating demand that enables our generation business to invest in more renewable energy projects right here in Australia.\n\nPacific Blue aims to double our clean energy production within the next five years, and invite you to join us in driving clean energy change now.\n\nOwnership structure\n\nPacific Blue (formerly Pacific Hydro) was acquired by the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) through its subsidiary, State Power Investment Overseas of China (SPIC Overseas) in January 2016. SPIC is one of the five major power generation groups in China and the largest solar power generation enterprise in the world. SPIC ranked 293rd among the Fortune Global 500 in 2021, with its businesses covering 46 countries and regions, including wind power, hydropower, thermal power, hydrogen energy, energy storage, integrated smart energy and green-energy powered transportation. By the end of 2021, SPIC’s overseas installed power generation capacity totalled 6.88 GW, with a clean energy ratio up to 73.6%."
