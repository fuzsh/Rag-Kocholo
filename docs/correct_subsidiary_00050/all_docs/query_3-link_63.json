        "text": "Yondee Shane Hansen is a Whadjuk Ballardong artist based in Perth, Western Australia. Born in Dumbleyung in 1964, Yondee spent his childhood around the Wheatbelt town of Narrogin and, later, near Guildford on the outskirts of Perth.\n\nIn his beautiful painting, Yondee represents the traditional songlines and walking paths of Derbarl Yerrigan (Swan River) waterways and Boorloo (Perth) coastal plains. This interconnected network of rivers, lakes and wetlands links the Noongar people to each other and their essential source of water, nourishment and culture.\n\nPacific Energy commissioned the painting in 2022 as a step towards elevating Aboriginal culture across its operations. Like the painting's interconnected river system, Pacific Energy's energy generation systems connect the people and the communities it serves, now and for the future.\n\nPacific Energy owns renewable, hybrid and thermal energy systems operating on Aboriginal Country across Australia. The various projects and their respective locations offer a platform for Pacific Energy to contribute meaningfully towards the promotion and appreciation of Aboriginal culture and engagement with local communities.\n\nYondee's artwork is displayed at Pacific Energy’s headquarters in Kewdale, Western Australia, on Whadjuk Noongar Country.\n\nAt Pacific Energy, we pay our continuing respects to Elders past and present and extend our respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples."
