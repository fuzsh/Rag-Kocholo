        "text": "About Marine Energy in the U.S.\n\nMarine energy technologies — powered by water-based renewable resources such as currents, tides, and waves — are undergoing rapid innovation. These technologies will be critical in helping to reach 100% clean energy targets and related climate change goals by 2035.\n\nThe National Hydropower Association’s Marine Energy Council (MEC) works with private sector companies, academia, and government partners to:\n\nEncourage the commercialization of marine energy technologies\n\nRaise awareness of the industry’s considerable potential to create good paying jobs and to secure an affordable, reliable, and environmentally friendly energy future.\n\nIn the United States, demonstration projects and research supported by the U.S. Department of Energy show that marine energy technologies will provide clear and competitive benefits to the electric system and facilitate off-grid “Blue Economy” market opportunities.\n\nServices related to deployment of marine energy technologies – including resource assessments, project feasibility studies, and site selection studies – can be a significant source of economic activity and revenue for U.S. companies.\n\nU.S. marine energy resources are significant and geographically diverse. According to the Marine Energy in the United States: An Overview of Opportunities, the fifty-state total technical resource of at least 2,300 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year is equivalent to 57 percent of total electricity generated in 2019 and could power approximately 220 million homes.\n\nThis does not include the significant potential for Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion and salinity gradient differentials.\n\nFor comparison, total solar generation in 2019 was 103 TWh, 2 percent of all U.S. electricity generation.\n\nMarine energy technologies are undergoing rapid innovation in the U.S. These technologies will be critical in helping to reach 100% clean energy targets and related climate change goals by 2035.\n\nGlobally available marine energy resources are vast, reliable, predictable, and environmentally friendly. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that by 2050 over 300 gigawatts (GW) of marine energy capacity will be installed globally, resulting in:\n\n$35 billion of investment\n\n680,000 direct jobs created\n\nReduction of 500 million tons of CO2 emissions each year\n\nIn the United States, demonstration projects and research supported by the U.S. Department of Energy show that marine energy technologies will provide clear and competitive benefits to the electric system and facilitate off-grid “Blue Economy” market opportunities.\n\nServices related to deployment of marine energy technologies – including resource assessments, project feasibility studies, and site selection studies – can be a significant source of economic activity and revenue for U.S. companies\n\nWAVE ENERGY\n\nThe U.S. wave energy resource is large (1,400 TWh/yr), and the vast majority of this energy is delivered directly to the nation’s shorelines where it can be utilized on land. The west coast is a particularly attractive region for wave energy because the resource reaches the shoreline (240 TWh/yr), where it can be readily utilized.\n\nTIDAL ENERGY\n\nA smaller resource by comparison (220 TWh/yr), tidal energy technologies are — in general — closer to commercialization than wave technologies. It is also a highly predictable form of renewable energy, and many sites are adjacent to markets that could utilize the power available. Tidal energy hot spots are located throughout the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and Alaskan coasts. Cook Inlet alone could power much of Alaska.\n\nOCEAN CURRENT ENERGY\n\nAt a similar level of commercialization as tidal, ocean current energy (49 TWh/yr) could provide clean reliable power to millions of homes along the southern Atlantic coastline. The Florida Current, part of the Gulf Stream, offers a significant opportunity.\n\nRIVERINE HYDROKINETIC ENERGY\n\nThe nation’s free-flowing riverine resource (78.86 TWh/yr) is appealing because it could provide a clean and reliable source of power to communities or other infrastructure along the nation’s river banks and waterways. This is a particularly interesting opportunity for remote Alaskan communities, many of which are located along rivers and typically rely on expensive diesel generators to power their electrical grids.\n\nOCEAN THERMAL ENERGY CONVERSION/SALINITY GRADIENTS\n\nThe potential for ocean thermal resources is vast and equivalent to 98 percent of all U.S. electricity generation in 2019."
