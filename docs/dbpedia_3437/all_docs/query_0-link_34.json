        "meta_description": "This article examines the evolution of disaster films and series broadcast by the BBC in light of major developments in the British televisual landscape, such as the competition for higher TV ratings and the ever-increasing criticisms, by private operators, of the BBC’s monopoly on the license fee. How far have these issues influenced TV productions? Why did films originally designed to educate and inform the population about potential dangers, for example the military use of nuclear power — Peter Watkins’s The War Game, 1965 — gradually evolve towards phobocratic series, like the 2004 If ... series? It would be shortsighted to put the blame on the BBC’s need to attract a larger audience only; instead, special attention will be paid to political reasons that may account for the public broadcaster’s recent decision to promote disaster films.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n2Smallpox 2002: Silent Weapon was a unique and daring assignment undertaken by the BBC and which was carried out against a backdrop of scathing criticisms for its catastrophic dimension. According to critics, the choice made by the Corporation was all the more surprising as this production did not fall within the remit of quality television by which the BBC has always claimed to abide and it was intended to elicit emotional rather than intellectual responses.\n\n5A diachronic approach of recent public channel programmes should highlight the irony of the success of Smallpox (2002), The Day Britain Stopped (2003) and Dirty War (2004), when considered in the context of the censorship imposed on Peter Watkins’s 1965 film. What place is there for reality, for thought-provoking and innovative ideas in films designed for a media seen nowadays mainly as a source of entertainment?\n\n6Finally, an examination of the If … series, broadcast by BBC2 in 2003, will provide answers as to how the broadcasting public sector has recently managed to prove successful in fulfilling its initial remits: informing viewers in an attractive way.\n\nThe War Game versus The Day Britain Stopped: from distance to hypnotism\n\n8Most of the scenarios of the disaster films commissioned by the BBC from 2002 onwards have been founded on scientific data, the most famous ones being Smallpox (2002), The Day Britain Stopped (2003) and Dirty War (2004). In the context of an increase in terrorist attacks, on a global scale, the large number of productions dealing with this sensitive issue helped increase the belief in an unavoidable threat in the short to medium term future. Yet, their main shortcoming was a trivialisation of issues, unlike Peter Watkins’s The War Game, which was designed to make up for the government’s improvidence and to warn the population about the effects of a nuclear attack on Britain, the film’s chronology spanning the impending threat, the actual explosion, and its aftermath.\n\n9Despite an aesthetic that hinges on all the tricks offered by modern cinematic technologies, The Day Britain Stopped is, in many respects, a copy of The War Game, which was highly experimental with its non-professional actors, its use of hand-held cameras, and its loosely-scripted scenario. Gabriel Range, the director of The Day Britain Stopped, went so far as to name one of his characters Pauline Watkins (Prue Clarke) as a thinly disguised reference to Peter Watkins himself. Pauline Watkins is a major character in this story and the death of her daughter — never seen but referred to as Charlie Watson — in an accident that caused a truck to overturn and start a chain of tragic events, turns her into the main witness of the chaos that happens on that day on the M25 motorway. Yet, the most obvious point both films share is the choice of a ubiquitous voice-over, manly and learned, that, in both cases, is used as a tool to convey the consequences of events that are presented in advance. The voice-over carefully arranges and ordains the viewers’ perception; it rationalises the course of events and claims that the images are of “major incidents turning into a national disaster”. Moreover, in The Day Britain Stopped, the voice-over delivers comments, which are strangely reminiscent of the narrative choices made by Peter Watkins in The War Game, in so far as, in both cases, things to happen are prophesies, rendering them ineluctable in the process.\n\n10Yet, unlike Peter Watkins’s The War Game, which explored an apocalyptic situation based on geopolitical data that informed the British population of the possible tragic outcomes of political decisions, The Day Britain Stopped corresponds to an anxiety-type of simulation that was originally intended to be more entertaining, thus garnering a large audience, than informative. Although all the British viewers could easily identify the places mentioned, they were confronted with a scenario that was both totally fictional and anticipatory, having no root in their then present time: the action was supposed to take place at the end of 2003, on 19 December precisely, while the film was released on 13 May, of the same year, with a series of events that were not related in any way to what was going on nationally at the time.\n\n12The impression of speed, of extreme tension, of chaos is one of the driving forces of these films, which rest on the editing of fleeting images. Visually, this impression comes from the succession of whip pans and zoom blur-effects, which characterize disaster films. Similarly, the use of fade-outs makes each image dissolve into the next, giving a feeling of inescapable succession between events which, consequently, become closely connected and which compound to generate a feeling of inevitability. A feeling that can also be found in the chronology of the events which begins with the train accident, leads to the unionist’s decision to go on strike, and then to traffic jams and accidents on the motorways. These incidents result in flight delays, and finally a collision between two planes. Gabriel Range opts for a form of representation centred on high frame rates, on deafening sounds and on violent and aggressive colours, which creates a saturation effect likely to generate inhibition. The director depicts the crisis as it is unfolding, which supports the feeling of inevitable impending doom. Unlike Peter Watkins, who opted to experiment with new forms of documentary, extensively resorted to changing viewpoints and close-ups — particularly ones of faces expressing fear and dismay — choosing to disrupt viewers and provoke reflections on images and their relationship to reality, Gabriel Range mimicked the aesthetics of news reports to which TV viewers are accustomed through the daily news.\n\n13While Peter Watkins imposed the distance that is required for analysis, Gabriel Range introduced a closeness that induces empathy and leads viewers to be completely absorbed by the disaster scenario that is presented to them. While, in the 1960s, Peter Watkins’s film anticipated the supremacy of TV journalism, The Day Britain Stopped mimics journalistic aesthetics to capture the attention of viewers better with awe-inspiring images. While the former had documentation and information as the main motive, the latter has entertainment in mind.\n\n14In both films, the image at the heart of the action is streaked by the movement of bodies that pass close to the camera lens, increasing the feeling of urgency and chaos. However, Peter Watkins remains faithful to the principle of identification and he is very explicit about the nature of the images he employs, even when he decides to use negatives to give the impression of bodies seen in the blinding light of a nuclear explosion. Any image is thus always easily and immediately identifiable, and viewers may, at any time, recognize the fictional world as the one they live in. The plot moves along a web of catastrophes that all converge on the impression of inevitability, of inescapability.\n\n15In Gabriel Range’s film, reality is digitalised and many shots display the digital mapping of the places mentioned, a stylistic device, which the filmmaker uses over and over again; this complete de-realization of the environment also contributes to making eerie that which is familiar. The omniscient narrator guides the viewers’ perception, reducing it or enlarging it at will. De-realization is also enhanced by images from CCTV cameras that show the comings and goings of passengers at Heathrow Airport or the traffic from stretches of the highway. The political implications of these stylistic devices need to be examined to determine how, forty years after The War Game, a docudrama, designed to inform viewers and document events, BBC disaster films are now mainly intended to provide entertainment.\n\nThe political scope of disaster scenarios\n\n16The major difference between recent disaster films for television and Peter Watkins’s The War Game is found, first of all, in the original intention. The War Game was intended as a political film criticising the government both for the possible use of nuclear weapons and for the lack of measures taken to protect the population, as explained by the filmmaker himself on the official site dedicated to the film:\n\nBY LATE 1964 Harold Wilson’s newly elected Labour Government had already broken its election manifesto to unilaterally disarm Britain, and was in fact developing a full-scale nuclear weapons programme, in spite of wide-spread public protest. […]\n\n13 http://pwatkins.mnsi.net/warGame.htm, accessed January 9th, 2019.\n\nAs part of my research, I had sent a letter to the Home Office inquiring how many hospital beds, etc. the Civil Defence would be able to provide following an all-out nuclear strike on the UK.13\n\n19The filmmaker emphasises the trade unionist’s responsibilities; it is all the less justified as he does not mention the true economic and political reasons which led to the mobilization that erupted into chaos. First among these is the deregulation of the transportation sector about which only anecdotal remarks are made. At the beginning of the fiction film, the voice-over notes that “decades of neglect have led to a day of disasters”, something that, incidentally, is echoed by a policeman when he mentions the lack of information on road works in progress. Similarly, an aviation expert, a doomsayer of air disasters, underlines the threat posed to aviation by savings made on fuel tanks filled to a minimum which, in case of diversion, can prove fatal. Finally, the same speaker mentions the specificity of the UK’s transport investment problem, which is echoed precisely at the end of the film by the Junior Minister of Transport himself: “Unlike other European countries, we do not invest enough public money in transport. In no way could we have foreseen this chain reaction.”\n\n22From a political point of view these TV films tend to disempower viewers, who are also citizens, by instilling in them the idea that the best strategy is to be passive and not to interfere with the professionals. The message that is conveyed is not to impede relief but to not get in the way of those who know best. It strengthens the feeling of fatalism that reinforces the citizens’ belief that they are living in a world whose complexity exceeds their understanding and which they are condemned to undergo. This type of programme represents the entertaining aspect of disempowerment; it corresponds to the political infantilization of citizens that benefits oligarchies and which Margaret Thatcher’s motto “There is no alternative” aptly encapsulated.\n\nThe dramaturgy of destiny as the alpha and the omega of disaster films\n\n24Staging social issues and representing them in a catastrophic way means depoliticizing them: in this type of film, the sensational becomes the driving force that obscures both the social and the political dimensions of issues. Viewers are confronted with some sort of live coverage, which offers no means to understand the events in a rational way.\n\n25The personalisation of issues associated with disaster movies requires transference and pathos, something which makes it difficult for viewers to grasp these very issues intellectually. Dissociating them from both their political and historical contexts to give them a personal dimension means reducing them to shocking images, images intended to impress. It means disguising reality and concealing responsibilities; it means turning the errors and shortcomings of policy makers into accidents, which were impossible for them to prevent, despite their supposed goodwill.\n\n28Naturalizing the tragic consequences of a social conflict by putting them on the same level as those from a natural catastrophe, like an earthquake, means evading any attempt at understanding them. Fictionalising these issues means obscuring them still further by failing to provide the necessary distance that is required to put them in perspective. The impact, even more than the reasons behind them, is highlighted and dissected but not analysed. By separating effects from causes, an impression of inevitability, in all its brutality and indiscrimination, is gradually instilled in the viewers’ minds and eventually prevails. By ignoring the historical and political aspects of events, all the catastrophes are put on the same level, whether natural or not, whether ineluctable or not, and responsibilities are diluted in a general feeling of acceptance, whatever the nature of the events since they result from the will of destiny. The weaker the body politic, the more fate, irrationality and cosmic order are invoked, all of which are forces beyond man’s control and, as a result, the more the viewers are likely to look for meaning in the consequences rather than in the origins. The unfolding of a tragic narrative is designed to replace explanations. The naturalization of social and political issues is a process of dumbing down, because it replaces meaning by observation; it is a form of censorship that reduces the disaster to its final phase, which involves avoiding considerations about the causes and so exonerates the responsible parties.\n\n30Yet, the explanations offered by these fiction films are specious on two counts. Firstly, they shift the problem from the origins to the consequences, thereby overshadowing the elements necessary for a rational analysis. Secondly, they urge viewers to accept and relinquish possible control over the course of events.\n\nWhat place for reality?\n\n31The main shortcoming of a fiction film like The Day Britain Stopped is the inextricable mixture of elements extracted from the real and from the imaginary worlds. Unlike Peter Watkins, Gabriel Range opts for entertainment with journalism as a mere foundation.\n\n33The message the director wishes to convey is completely blurred. The only tangible reality that remains at the end of the film is the violence of shocking images edited with a staccato rhythm and which have failed to inform viewers on how the crisis among transport workers got started and how it was solved.\n\n34In addition to its reactionary political viewpoints, trade unionists being described as a privileged class, this film fails to go beyond simulacrum and semblance, a criticism often levelled at the If … series.\n\nThe If … series\n\n36Most of the actions take place in a relatively near future — half a decade, on average — which creates increased tension because it means dealing with an issue that, according to probable scientific projections, is likely to arise and to affect viewers in the course of their lifetime. The time frame, the sequence of events and the issues related to time in general, are key elements: too pessimistic a scenario, one pretending that the tragedy may occur tomorrow, would jeopardize and even condemn the film on account of its lack of credibility; likewise, too distant a deadline would likely diminish the feeling of impending doom both inherent in the tragic dimension of the film and necessary to build tension and prompt viewers to realise that stakes are high. The concept behind the programme, despite the channel’s claims, is not so much the “If ” as it is the “When”, turning the programme into a mixture of both anticipatory and apocalyptic elements. The If ... series was far from being prescriptive. It cashed in on the probability that such events would occur; it was premonitory. Unlike Peter Watkins’s films, which were both political diatribes and remedies designed to help citizens face the challenges of their time, these productions were trivialisations of current issues, a conclusion drawn from the fact that all the themes were developed along identical scenarios, something which failed to give much substance to any of them and made them all banal.\n\n37The first three BBC productions, between 2002 and 2004 — Smallpox (2002), The Day Britain Stopped (2003), Dirty War (2004) — were used as prototypes, designed to test a formula that later became the If ... series. The If ... series was broadcast in the context of a public television network that, more than ever¸ needed to prove its worth with a view to the renewal of its prerogatives in 2006. For public television, the formula proved a rich seam into which it tapped extensively, and which allowed it to shoot a dozen episodes in two years.\n\n39Exhaustive in its intentions, this series intended to review scientific developments but also the sociological, economic and legal consequences of each of the topics it addressed. It allowed the BBC to position itself as public service television that educated and informed people while entertaining them at the same time.\n\nThe If … series or Investigative TV vs Examination TV\n\n40Up until the inception of the If ... series on public television, docudrama was very rarely followed by a post-broadcast debate and, before the early 2000s, the corresponding films would fall into the category of investigative television. This meant that filmmakers would undertake research and analyses about information previously treated by news and current events, and would present them in a personal and original way. The investigations, which resulted from field surveys among the people concerned and from the cross-checking of various pieces of information, served to highlight a different view or one hitherto insufficiently publicized. These auteur films dealt with subjects that had been treated extensively in the news in the recent past and adopted a perspective that was often voluntarily biased. The temporal distance from the events explained why a television repeat, or even a first broadcast following a period of censorship (ex: The War Game produced in 1965 but broadcast in 1985) would often become historical artefacts that reflected the approach of the subject at the time rather than a relevant point of view. Censorship and delayed broadcasting would rob the programme of its critical dimension.\n\n41With the If ... series, the BBC moved away from investigative TV to examination TV. Investigative television, which favoured reportages with journalists who would move to the scene of the events, was gradually replaced by examination television, or the television of experts, with the studio as the place where things happened. The programme substituted issues for events, either social or political, and the reporter disappeared, replaced by specialists. It is in this context that the political and societal debates would take place, on sets, where experts were given the floor. The investigative television of the 60s and 70s — centred around a fiction film that resulted from thorough investigation and which, by presenting the plurality of opinions, allowed for the search and expression of truth — gradually made room for the television of experts with radically different rules. On TV, these experts exchanged views they previously had the opportunity to highlight in their capacity as consultants for the films aired minutes earlier. This was the case for Danny Kushlick, director of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, who appeared in If ... Drugs Were Legal (2005) and who was one of the guests during the debate that followed the airing of the film. Rather than exchanging views, experts would come to fight for their interests, as they were already familiar with the arguments of their peers on the opposing side.\n\n42As for the docudrama itself, it was no longer political work but an alibi for engaging the attention of viewers in the early part of the evening and to absorb them in a theme that was debated throughout the whole evening. Unlike the type of docudrama practised by Peter Kosminsky, for example, the purpose of which is to arouse controversy on recent news on prime-time TV with the presentation of a counter investigation, the If ... series turned a social issue into a trivial topic.\n\n43These highly emotional programmes would deal with mankind’s survival as a group but also as individuals, in the context of some aberrant individual practices, addiction, whatever type, being one of them. Television would lend itself to themed evenings and the chosen topics would give coherence to all the evening’s broadcasts: while a theme like If ... The Toxic Timebomb Goes Off may have caused anxiety, If ... TV Goes Down the Tube was likely to feature both a lighter and more social touch. As for If ... We Do not Stop Eating, it had a potentially much lighter theme which may have been suited to more savoury filmic treatments. Yet, docudramas that introduced these thematic evenings borrowed heavily, stylistically, from investigative television. All the fiction films from the If ... series, along with the three disaster movies that preceded them, tapped into the processes pertaining to investigative journalism, such as proximity and spontaneity, effects elicited by hand-held cameras and the use of disruptive background sounds that would saturate the soundtrack.\n\n44However, unlike the political and controversial docudramas, which are highly exposed to litigation and require journalistic accuracy, the doomsday fiction films, as well as those presented in the context of the If ... series, are prone to inaccuracies since their aim is firstly to impress and entertain viewers. Everything is done to hold viewers captive until the end of the thematic evening. Scheduled on primetime, these fiction films obey the constraints of pure entertainment. Consequently the nature and value of the film are profoundly affected. Instead of an auteur film, viewers are confronted with a timely command whose purpose is only to give an overview of the topic.\n\n45The quality of the fiction does not lie in its aesthetic nature nor in a specific structure but in the content of the arguments put forward by the specialists who are the only qualified mediators of a television of experts. This is something the executives in charge of the programmes highlight by advertising the exceptional panel of British and foreign professionals but also, as in the case of If ... Drugs Were Legal (2005), of experts from other domains: on the evening the film was broadcast, Emma Bonino, former EU humanitarian affairs commissioner, was live from Brussels. In their intentions, the designers of this programme wanted it to be neutral to give viewers the impression that they had all the required elements to form an opinion.\n\n46The specialist must then act as a journalist or a storyteller and must be able to account for his experience and his knowledge, that is to say, to cast over them a look that is both analytic and narrative. The scientist must be able to speak about his subject in both scientific and sociological terms since today’s television is defined as a remedial tool; it must be able to act on the viewers’ behaviours by helping them understand the economic, political, and sociological perspectives of the issue. The expert, as a consultant or as a participant in the discussion following the film, then morphs into a pedagogue.\n\n47As the ultimate example of the BBC’s professionalism, the debates of the If ... series were moderated by journalists — Jeremy Paxman acting as host on the evening of the broadcasting of If.. Drugs were Legal — and were accommodated within the larger framework of Newsnight, the evening news programme. This example illustrates the deviance of journalism, which at the end of the 20th century shifted from the transmission of information — Newsnight being emblematic of it — towards forms of infotainment centred on a single subject and in which the journalist-presenter would stand at the centre of a panel of experts. This hybridization of genres is one of the latest developments in television induced by reality TV. The words of the expert have to be dramatic, and the way things are presented is of utmost importance. Dramatization becomes the main tool for the delivering of scientific information which, to be understood, must first be attractive. Scientists are rarely actors and managing speeches and transitions befalls the presenter who leads the debate and, above all, speeds up its rhythm when it becomes too slow or too complex. All the eloquence and pugnacity of a journalist like Jeremy Paxman were required to reach and maintain tension on a subject, in this case drug-addiction, which, because of its chronic character, had no direct connection with the then current events.\n\n48On such occasions, the night edition of the news does not exactly comply with the usual news conventions: it adopts infotainment conventions instead and focuses on the theme of the film previously aired; it then becomes a form of advertising designed to elicit loyalty.\n\n50At this stage, it is worth noting that examination television fails to rid itself completely of the weight and impact of investigative television, viewed by journalists as the only legitimate form of TV journalism. The If ... Drugs Were Legal programme (2005), for example, was built around a detective story: an agent from Ofdrug (a narcotics monitoring agency), aided by a former narcotics police officer, carried out an investigation designed to shed light on the accidental deaths of two girls. The structure of the police investigation is very popular and sits well with the hybridization of genres since it is a format that has been repeatedly used, whether in fiction with an educational value, as is the case of the If... series, or in documentaries like those on history, which the BBC has come to specialise in.\n\n51The police investigation format provides an easy narrative matrix, which offers viewers the impression of gradually participating in the discovery of the solution. Moreover, it fuels the myth that everything can always be explained, thanks, among other things, to science. Unlike the pedagogical use of hybridisation made by TV in the past, with directors like Peter Watkins and Ken Loach, it is not meant to draw the viewers’ attention to an aesthetic, which would be denounced as reactionary, but it is intended to facilitate the appropriation of the contents, thanks to a form that is easily accessible. Originally, this approach called for the active participation of viewers, which was an early form of interactivity, a mode nowadays extensively used by reality television. In addition to questions that viewers are encouraged to ponder over before and during the debate, television channels have, of late, increasingly extended exchanges with forums on the internet after the airing of the film. The link this type of programme weaves with viewers is proven by the abundant exchanges each broadcast generates on the internet.\n\nConclusion\n\n52The If ... series is a paragon of journalistic hybridity combining elements from investigative journalism and others from examination television. While it allowed the BBC to stem competition from reality television programmes that were rife on private channels at the time and that would garner wide audiences, it also raised denigration and disparagement on the grounds that it provided mediocrity through productions, which distorted, rather than explained, the topics selected.\n\n53Due to its obsession with ratings and its need to compete with privately owned channels, the BBC has given in to the worst forebodings with programmes designed to challenge reality television. It has lately failed to compete with Channel 4 for the best films television can boast of — namely Peter Kosminky’s The Government Inspector (Channel 4, 2005), Britz (Channel 4, 2007) and The Promise (Channel 4, 2011) — and has largely contributed to the distortion and the belittling of the genre of the docudrama which talented filmmakers like Peter Watkins and Ken Loach promoted. Finally, it has helped pave the way for infotainment which has gradually taken over from educative and informative programmes.\n\n54The compulsion the BBC feels to remain at the cutting edge of innovation leads it to use modern means of communication to keep in touch constantly with its audience, in particular after the broadcasting of its programmes. Unfortunately, this tendency is likely to increase the dumbing down of issues rather than raise the level of public debate."
