        "text": "Change can be difficult, and contemplating the climate crisis can be hard. But we believe that we need to lean into this transition and use it as a force for good. This is an opportunity to reconsider what we value, and how we’d like to live, work and interact with each other – all while creating new jobs and business models.\n\nCities are in a prime position to test new ways of working and living. Not only do they account for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions and are home to 75% of EU citizens, they are also centres of economic activity, knowledge generation, innovation and new technologies. Throughout history, cities have often been at the forefront of change and innovation, and now is no exception. We believe in cities and work with them to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, all the while ensuring decarbonisation efforts are equitable and contribute to the well-being of European communities.\n\nEurope has pledged to lead on climate action and has set forth ambitious goals and directives to achieve that commitment. The Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe research and innovation programmes, the European Green Deal and other European Union policies and directives propel European Member States towards a 55% cut in emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nAs part of the Horizon Europe programme, the EU has launched a Mission “100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030”. The objectives of the mission are to achieve 100 climate-neutral and smart European cities by 2030 and to ensure that these cities act as experimentation and innovation hubs to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050."
