        "text": "Lady Maud is desperate to have children but Sir Giles' refusal causes her to start divorce proceedings. Sir Giles seeks revenge by allowing a proposed new road to be built on their property and claiming the compensation from the government. However, he hasn't counted on their mysterious gardener, Blott, who may well turn out to be Lady Maud's unlikely hero. Based on Tom Sharpe's bestseller, this BAFTA-winning comedy drama is an epic farce about planning enquiries, motorway construction, stately homes and family disagreements. Not to mention the sex, violence, blackmail and anarchy. Appalled by the riot in Worford and under pressure from the Prime Minister, the ministry send a troubleshooter to conduct negotiations. Dundridge duly arrives to be faced with much more than he bargained for. Blott and Lady Maude are stepping up their campaign to save Cleene Gorge."
