Without their energy and motivation, we would not be living in the sphere of peace and stability that we take for granted.\n\nFrom resistance fighters to lawyers and parliamentarians, the EU pioneers were a diverse group of people who held the same ideals: a peaceful, united and prosperous Europe.\n\nBeyond the pioneers described below, many others have worked tirelessly towards and inspired the European project. This section on the EUâ€™s pioneers is therefore a work in progress."
