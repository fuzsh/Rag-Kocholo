Â Tim Williams and guest co-host Nicholas Pepin, from \"Pop Culture Roulette\" Podcast (who is a long-time \"Weird Al\" fan) give their SPOILER-FILLED reactions to the movie and share memories of their first exposure to the genius that is \"Weird Al\" Yankovic.\nSend us an email or reach out to us on social media to let us know what you liked, what you loved, what we may have missed, or what 80's movie we should discuss next!

        "text": "Remember the days when action figures ruled our imaginations and epic battles between good and evil played out in our living rooms? Step into 1987, when a beloved toy line and animated series leaped onto the big screen in a live-action spectacle. In this 80s flick a intergalactic battle spills from the fantastical world of Eternia into our own. Marketed as the âStar Wars of the 80s, it didnât quite live up to the hype. But today it is remembered as a cult classic that brought our favorite toy characters to life in a whole new way. So jump through the travel portal, grab the Power Sword and shout, 'I have the power!' as Tim Williams and guest co-hosts, Chris Adams (from \"Retro Life 4 You Podcast\"), Gerry D (from \"Totally Rad Christmas Podcast\"), and Laramy Wells (from \"Moving Panels Podcast\") discuss âMasters of the Universeâ from 1987 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover on this episode:\n\nThe Throne Room set of Castle Grayskull was originally two large adjoining sound stages. The wall between the sets was knocked down to make one gigantic sound stage. At that time, this was the largest set Hollywood had seen in over 40 years.\n\nProduction designer William Stout intentionally wanted the interior of Castle Grayskull to combine elements of both good and evil. In an online interview, Stout explained, \"This was the seat of power for the entire universe. I reasoned that power is neither good nor bad; it's what you make of it and how you use it. Above floor level were what I called the Space Godsâgiant bronze statues of those who had used the power based in that room for good. Below floor level was the dark sideâdemonic creatures that represented power used for bad or evil.\"\n\nMany reviewers compared the movie to the cartoon, but it was based on the toys. The toys initially portrayed He-Man as a barbarian in the first mini-comics, not as Prince Adam or Orko. Ed Pressman was interested in the property before the cartoon aired and purchased the movie rights for the Mattel characters, not from Filmation.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nhttps://www.cbr.com/heman-masters-of-the-universe-trivia-facts-1987-movie/\n\nSome sections were composed by ChatGPT\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

Step into 1986, a time when high-octane, patriotic thrillers ruled the big screen. In this 80s action flick, we witness an elite military team led by none other than Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin, taking on a hijacking crisis with rocket-powered bravery and martial arts skill. Based loosely on actual events, this film blended explosive action with a tension-filled storyline that may not have broken box office records, but entertained countless viewers who discovered it on cable and VHS. So assemble the team, get on your rocket-firing motorcycle and donât miss the plane as Tim Williams and guest co-hosts Chris Adams from \"Retro Life 4 You\" Podcast and Gerry D from \"Totally Rad Christmas\" Podcast discuss âThe Delta Forceâ from 1986 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover on this episode:\n\nThere were plans to produce a line of Delta Force action figures and vehicles that unfortunately for toy collectors everywhere never made it past the prototype stage. But a board game based on the movie called âThe Delta Force: Americaâs New Heroesâ was released in 1986 by Fun Designs.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, BoxOfficeMojo\n\nhttps://www.bulletproofaction.com/2021/06/15/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-delta-force/#google_vignette\n\nSome sections were composed by ChatGPT\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

But just when you thought it was safe to fall asleep again, Freddy returned with a vengeance in this 80s Flick sequel. This time, he's got his sights set on a new victim, Jesse Walsh, who discovers that his nightmares are all too real when Freddy attempts to take over his body.\n\nSo unpack the moving boxes, stay out of the locker room showers, and watch out for exploding birds as Tim Williams and guest co-host Laramy Wells from \"Moving Panels Podcast\" discuss âA Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revengeâ from 1985 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover on this episode:\n\nThe school used in this film is also the same school used in \"The Karate Kid\" (1984).\n\nThe last film in the original \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" series in which Nancy's house is the focal point of Freddy's terror. The rest of the series focuses more on the town of Springwood, with the house making an occasional appearance. In the hybrid film \"Freddy vs Jason\" it was referenced that Lori lived in Freddy's house, but the scene was cut from the theatrical release (it does, however, appear in the Deleted Scenes section on the DVD release).\n\nThis is the only film in the series not to use Charles Bernstein's original theme or a variation of it.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, BoxOfficeMojo\n\nSome sections were composed by ChatGPT\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

It could have been one of the biggest movies of 1986 but then tragedy happened. When the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded in January of 86, so did the filmâs marketing plan and hopes of blockbuster status. But thanks to VHS and HBO, it eventually found its audience and inspired future scientists, pilots and even astronauts.\n\nSo climb in the Space Shuttle, buckle up, and watch the oxygen levels as Tim Williams and guest co-hosts, Jeff Atkins, Ben Carpenter, and Nicholas Pepin (from \"Pop Culture Roulette Podcast\") discuss âSpaceCampâ from 1986 on this special bonus episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover on this episode:\n\nThe footage of the Space Shuttle Orbiter landing is from Challenger touching down at the conclusion of STS-8. This was the first night landing of the Space Shuttle program.\n\nIn earlier drafts of the storyline, a Russian shuttle is sent up to rescue the American kids. At the end of the film, it was to be revealed that Russian kids had rescued the American kids.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo,\n\nhttps://www.al.com/life/2019/07/secrets-of-the-80s-spacecamp-movie-revealed.html\n\nhttps://www.thedigitalcinema.info/single-post/2018/02/21/interview-with-harry-winer-director-of-spacecamp\n\nhttps://www.vulture.com/2020/01/disney-developing-a-tv-show-based-on-1986-space-camp-movie.html\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

Picture this: it's the summer of 1989, and two young employees are ready for a dream getaway at their boss's swanky beach house. But there's a twistâwhen they arrive, they find their boss, who unbeknownst to them has been stealing from the company, very much dead. What follows is a wild 48 hours filled with dirty-old drunks, bikini-clad ladies, and an unsuspecting corpse that seems to still be the life of the party. Sound ridiculous? Of course it does. But who needs logic and common sense when youâve got 90 minutes of slapstick and sightgags? This is one weekend we will never forget!\n\nSo grab your sunglasses, jump in the golf cart, and meet us at the big house at the top of the dune as Tim Williams and guest co-hosts Nicholas Pepin (from \"Pop Culture Roulette\" Podcast) and Chad Sheppard discuss âWeekend at Bernieâsâ from 1989 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nThere are no behind-the-scenes trivia that we were unable to cover on this episode.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nhttps://www.looper.com/904422/the-untold-truth-of-weekend-at-bernies/\n\nhttps://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/a-salute-to-weekend-at-bernies-the-stupidest-comedy-you-secretly-love\n\nhttps://www.slashfilm.com/1080355/one-weekend-at-bernies-scene-had-terry-kiser-gasping-for-air/\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

Layoffs in traditionally American male workplaces, especially the auto industry, had landed innumerable men on their living room couches - a stark contrast to the seventies when a total of six men reported being stay-at-home dads in America. Thatâs right, just six. This resulted in many of their wives having to head into the workplace themselves to help make ends meet, but it also meant these men were forced to tackle domestic responsibilities previously foreign to them. You know, like their kids.\n\nFor those of us who grew up in the eighties, a movie like this was a staple of cable TV. Itâs popularity coincided with the rise of HBO and Home Video rentals, so it was in constant rotation in a lot of households. It was also the launching point for stardom for its lead actor, Michael Keaton, and original screenwriter, John Hughes.\n\nSo grab your woobie, hide the chili from the baby, and get ready to make some home improvements (220, 221â¦whatever it takes) as Ben Carpenter and I discuss âMr. Momâ from 1983 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover on this episode:\n\nThe discussion between Jack and factory workers about the movie Rocky where Jack says \"when you're down, you're not necessarily out.\" A worker then imitates the Rocky theme song. Jack later heeds his own advice, and his turnaround montage uses the Rocky theme song.\n\nIn the scene where Jeffrey Tambor's character fires the engineers, he reassures them that \"you guys are terrific engineers. You're too good not to catch on somewhere.\" Michael Keaton's character Jack replies, \"Where are we gonna catch on? Nagasaki?\" Three years later Keaton starred in âGung Hoâ, a film which opened with his character, an automotive factory foreman, traveling to Japan to convince a Japanese automaker to reopen the factory.\n\nThis film wasn't released until a year or two later in some countries as in 1983 Michael Keaton was an unknown outside the USA and although Terri Garr was slightly better known, she wasn't considered a big enough name to carry the film. By the mid 1980s Keaton had a couple of moderate size hit films behind him so the film finally crept out into some cinemas or onto video.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes\n\nhttps://colehaddon.substack.com/p/on-its-40th-anniversary-its-time\n\nhttps://www.mentalfloss.com/article/84008/11-surprising-facts-about-mr-mom\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

It's the classic tale of renovation gone awry, starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long as a couple who snag a mansion at a bargain, only to realize after the deal is done why it was priced so low. While the critics weren't overly impressed, for countless fans, it remains a cherished early entry in Tom Hanks' filmography.\n\nSo watch out for collapsing stairs, airborne turkeys, and weak trees, as Tim Williams and guest co-host, Gerry D from \"Totally Rad Christmas\" Podcast discuss âThe Money Pitâ from 1986 on this special bonus episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover on this episode:\n\nFor the scene with the bathtub falling two floors down after being filled with water, Tom Hanks does an obnoxious laugh (which sounds like the imitation of a sea lion).

Producer Steven Spielberg and director Joe Dante knew this, so rather than maintain the bland seriousness of 1966âs âFantastic Voyageâ, they decided to have fun with it, and made a better movie because of it.\n\nLt. Tuck Pendleton, a daring Navy pilot, volunteers for a miniaturization experiment that becomes hijacked by industrial spies. He is accidentally injected into the body of a hypochondriac grocery clerk named Jack Putter. Inside Jack's body, Tuck must navigate through his host's bloodstream to survive and eventually reverse the process. With the help of Tuck's girlfriend, Lydia, the trio get tangled up in technological espionage to defeat some inept and unlikely arms dealers.\n\nSo get ready to shrink down, laugh it up, and twist the night away as Tim Williams and guest co-hosts, Ben Carpenter and Nicholas Pepin, discuss âInnerspaceâ from 1987 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover on this episode:\n\nThis is the only film directed by Joe Dante to win an Academy Award. It won the Best Visual Effects award.\n\nBefore the Scrimshaw meeting, Picardo's voice was overdubbed with Martin Short's. During the meeting, Picardo used his own voice (with a Short-esque lilt), as the filmmakers didn't think Short \"trying\" the Cowboy's voice would be convincing enough to make the scene work.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nhttps://theultimaterabbit.com/2019/09/01/joe-dante-talks-about-the-making-of-innerspace-at-new-beverly-cinema/\n\nhttps://ghostof82.wordpress.com/2015/09/16/revisiting-innerspace-1987/\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

For instance: donât dump pigâs blood on Carrie, never stay at The Shiningâs Overlook Hotel, and for goodness sake, tread lightly when dealing with a 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine.\n\nKing takes the classic tale of boy-meets-girl to frightening heights when a geeky teenager named Arnie falls for a red Plymouth Fury with a sketchy past. Christine falls hard for Arnie, too, which would be roses and balloon drops if it werenât for one tiny detail: the car is a killing machine with a long memory and a short fuse. Moral of the story: Never underestimate the fury of a Fury, particularly one that justâ¦wonâtâ¦die.\n\nSo jump in the Plymouth Fury, put out your cigar and try not to choke on your hamburger as Tim Williams and Guest Co-Host, Laramy Wells from \"Moving Panels\" Podcast discuss âChristineâ from 1983 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover on this episode:\n\nStephen King and director George Romero worked together on several projects early in King's career, including adaptations of \"Salem's Lot\" and \"The Stand.\" They also collaborated on the 1982 film \"Creepshow.\" During that time, Romero married actress and producer Christine Forrest. Although they divorced in 2010, Romero cast Forrest in several of his films. As a tribute to their friendship, King named the evil 1958 Plymouth Fury in his novel \"Christine\" after her.\n\nAfter reading over the book, actor Keith Gordon and the costume designer came up with a visual way to show Arnie being possessed by Christine. As the movie progresses, Arnie begins to wear clothes that reflect the era of Christine's make. At various points, especially when Arnie is yelling at Leigh on the phone, Arnie is seen wearing button up shirts open with black t-shirts, black pants, and boots like a 1950's \"greaser.\" When he's talking to Junkins, he's wearing a leather vest over a button up shirt (a nod to western TV shows which were popular in the 50's), and he even starts to wear a red suede jacket like James Dean in \"Rebel Without A Cause\".\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nhttps://www.cinemablend.com/movies/john-carpenters-christine-behind-the-scenes-facts-about-the-classic-stephen-king-movie\n\nhttps://www.hagerty.com/media/entertainment/fear-on-wheels-christine/\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

Together with the help of a crafty young thief, they must attempt to lift the curse for the sake of true love.\n\nSo grab your sword, put on your armor, and mount your horse as Tim Williams and guest co-hosts Nicholas Pepin from \"Pop Culture Roulette\" Podcast and Chad Sheppard discuss âLadyhawkeâ from 1985 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover on this episode:\n\nRutger Hauer has said that one of his proudest moments in this movie was being able to flip the dagger in his hand during the climactic fight without looking at it.\n\nWarner Brothers falsely marketed this movie as being based on a true medieval legend. The original screenwriter took the issue to the Writers Guild Association. He won a cash settlement from Warner Brothers, but the medieval legend claim wasn't dropped.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo,\n\nhttps://screenrant.com/ladyhawke-behind-scenes-details-making-trivia/\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

However Barry Levinsonâs 1984 Oscar nominated flick sparked a resurgence leading to over 18 baseball themed films in the next decade. On the surface it appears as a traditional sports biopic, but it reveals deeper, almost artistic layers upon closer examination. It trancends mere athletic drama to become a quenissentially American fable and a crowd-pleasing fairytale. The story follows Roy Hobbs, a gifted baseball player whose career is tragically derailed. Years later reappears and an aging outfielder for the fictional New York Knights. Armed with his mystical bat, âWonderboyâ. As Hobbs propels the underdog team towards victory, he confront his past and battles and formadible challenges, embodying the drama and spirit of Americaâs beloved game in a narrative of redemption and myth. So grab some peanuts and cracker jack to snack on as Tim Williams and guest c0-hosts, Nicholas Pepin and Ben Carpenter discuss âThe Naturalâ from 1984 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover on this episode:\n\nAlthough big league baseball players at the turn of the 20th century sported long hair, handlebar mustaches, and pork chop side burns, it had changed by the time of this story. The strict edict of the day from the Commissioner of Baseball required a player to possess a clean shaven countenance. This continued up to the early 1970s and included everyone; even the Black and Latin American prospects were compelled to comply, and yet, Manager Pop Fisher and coach Red Blow both sport thick walrus mustaches.\n\nGlenn Close's initial appearance at the ballpark was carefully planned to give her the appearance of a guardian angel. They waited until a clear day, when the setting sun would be just at the right spot in the background to shine through her translucent hat, making it appear as a halo around her head.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo,\n\nhttps://www.popmatters.com/the-natural-1984-2496248743.html\n\nhttps://70srichard.wordpress.com/2014/05/11/the-natural/\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

And Renâs locker, which appears several times in the movie, is still there and marked on the inside with a plaque that begins, âCongrats! Youâve got Kevin Baconâs locker!â\n\nAccording to Kevin Bacon, his credited main dance double in the famous warehouse scene, Peter Tramm, was married at the time to Marine Jahan, who was the famously uncredited dance double for Jennifer Beals in \"Flashdance\".\n\nIn the scene where Reverend Shaw shows Ren a picture of his deceased son Bobby, John Lithgow showed a photograph of his real son.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo, Blu-Ray Behind the Scenes Featurettes\n\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/footloose-just-turned-40-10-113814618.html\n\nhttps://www.fast-rewind.com/making_footlse.htm\n\nhttps://www.watchmojo.com/articles/top-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-footloose/the-final-dance-scene-got-a-late-makeover\n\nhttp://www.boxofficeprophets.com/column/index.cfm?columnID=20404\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

With the odds stacked against him and his own personal struggles looming large, Galvin embarks on a quest for redemption, determined to uncover the truth and deliver justice. As the trial unfolds, tensions rise, alliances are tested, and the line between right and wrong becomes increasingly blurred.

This formula has proven to be effective, resulting in a lot of success, with occasional bright spots in the modern era.\n\nIn 1986, a year before \"Lethal Weapon\" changed the game, director Peter Hyams directed this 80s flick starring two up-and-coming actors of the day, dancer Gregory Hines, and comedian Billy Crystal. Although the film didn't make any significant impact on cinema and has become largely forgotten, it remains a quality example of the genre and an entertaining film with a solid story and a memorable cast.\n\nSo jump in the spray-painted unmarked police car, donât lose your pants, and crank up Michael McDonaldâs âSweet Freedomâ as Tim Williams and guest co-hosts Gerry D from \"Totally Rad Christmas\" Podcast and Nicholas Pepin from \"Pop Culture Roulette\" Podcast I discuss âRunning Scaredâ from 1986 on this special replay episode of the 80âs Flick Flashback podcast!\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nWhen Ray and Danny were targeted by two muggers, it was obvious that the thugs were not experienced in their field. If you closely observe the tall thug in the black leather jacket, you will notice that his \"pistol\" was actually made up of a piece of wood with a metal rod that was kept in place by electrical tape.\n\nAfter returning from Florida, Ray wears a Tampa Bay Buccaneers hat. At the time the movie was filmed, the Buccaneers and Chicago Bears were division rivals.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

But this 80s flick isn't just your run-of-the-mill thriller; it's a mind-bending carnival ride of suspense. A Navy officer's clandestine affair takes a treacherous turn when he becomes a pawn in a high-stakes conspiracy within the Pentagon. As the plot thickens he finds himself in a race against time, desperately untangling a complex web of lies while facing the imminent threat of exposure and danger. With unexpected twists, the movie kept audiences on the edge of their seats, guessing who was playing whom until the grand finale.\n\nSo travel with us to our nationâs capitol, check your security clearance, and be sure to throw away any undeveloped Polaroid negatives as Tim Williams and guest co-host, JB Huffman from \"Manly Movies\" Podcast, discuss âNo Way Outâ from 1987 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nDuring the State Dinner that Farrell and Susan attended, a Maori group performed a war dance. The director, Roger Donaldson, included this reference as a tribute to his home country of New Zealand.\n\nThis was the final cinematography work by John Alcott. Within days of completing the film, Alcott went to France for vacation and died. He was 52 years old. The film is dedicated to his memory.\n\nIt was not known at the time of the movieâs release that there existed a group of Russian sleeper agents who had been staying in the United States for many years, without anyone suspecting them. These agents had children, coworkers, friends, and neighbors who were all unaware of their true identities. In 2010, some of these \"illegals\" were arrested and later sent back to Russia in exchange for some Americans held in Russia.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes\n\nhttps://filmschoolrejects.com/commentary-no-way-out/2/\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

Tasked with a decoy mission to distract attention from a genuine covert operation, the duo becomes entangled in a web of conspiracies, encounters with KGB agents, and a journey that takes them from the treacherous terrains of Afghanistan to the frigid landscapes of the Soviet Union.\n\nIt not only capitalizes on the chemistry between its lead actors but also serves as a parody of spy movie tropes prevalent in the '80s. Cleverly satirizing the political climate of its time, it offered a light-hearted take on the Cold War anxieties that gripped the world. By infusing humor into the serious business of espionage, the film manages to lampoon both political posturing and the conventions of the spy genre itself.\n\nSo start studying for the foreign service exam, pull out your book on Colloquial Russian, and meet us at the Ace Tomato Company as Tim Williams and guest co-host, Laramy Wells from \"Moving Panels\" Podcast to discuss âSpies Like Usâ from 1985 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nChevy Chase's co-worker asks him if he's going to take the Foreign Service Board Exam and explains \"it's supposed to be all new this year. There will be 500 questions in two hours.\" This means that an exam taker would have to answer a question at least every 14.4 seconds.\n\nChevy Chase's character tells the test administrator, played by Frank Oz, that he's late because he was at the reading of a will. In \"Knives Out\" (2019), Oz plays a lawyer reading a will.\n\nChevy Chase's most successful film at the North American box office in 1985. It grossed $60 million domestically, while his other pictures Fletch (1985) and National Lampoon's European Vacation (1985) grossed $50 million and $49 million respectively. Ironically the latter two less financially successful films inspired sequels while there never was a sequel to this film.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nhttps://ultimateclassicrock.com/spies-like-us-movie\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

Its enduring appeal lies in its ability to resonate with audiences of all ages, weaving a narrative that transcends its fairy-tale origins. Filled with memorable songs, this story of love, sacrifice, and the pursuit of one's true self remains as poignant and relevant today as it did over three decades ago. So plunge back into the magical waters with host, Tim Williams, to rediscover the charm, music, and timeless allure that made \"The Little Mermaid\" from 1989 a crown jewel in Disney's animated legacy on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nThis movie version of \"The Little Mermaid\" kept several elements from the original story written by Hans Christian Andersen. These include Ariel being the youngest of many sisters, the secret white marble statue, the polypi along the entrance to Ursula's cavern, and Ariel asking what she'll have left without her voice and the sea-witch's response. However, there is a major difference between the original story and the movie. In the original story, Ariel does not turn back into a mermaid at the end. Instead, when the sun rises on the last day, she turns to foam and dies. Later editions included her becoming a daughter of the air and rising to heaven.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

Screenwriter and director Danny Steinmann, whose limited filmography was mainly exploitation films, ventured beyond the well-trodden path of its predecessors, by introducing a narrative twist that left fans both confused and disappointed. But when Friday the 13th falls in the month of October, we had to cover the next one in the series. So get ready to be reacquainted with hockey masks, machetes, and jump-scares as Tim Williams and guest co-host, Nicholas Pepin from \"Pop Culture Roulette\" Podcast discuss âFriday the 13th: A New Beginningâ from (1985) on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nFriday the 13th producer Frank Mancuso Jr. didn't get on with the film's director Danny Steinmann. Mancuso called Steinmann a pervert and called the film a softcore porn sex movie rather than a slasher horror film.\n\nRebecca Wood (Lana) had a lot of fun filming her death scene to the point where she walked down the street with the axe glued to her head acting like a zombie causing people passing by to freak out not knowing if a movie was being filmed up ahead. Rebecca stated that she had a lot of laughs doing it.\n\nOne month prior to the film's release in the United States, the MPAA demanded that sixteen scenes featuring sex or graphic violence be edited in order to merit an \"R\" rating instead of an \"X\". The film ultimately required nine trips to the MPAA before finally being granted an \"R\" rating.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes,\n\nhttps://weminoredinfilm.com/2014/02/28/13-things-you-may-not-know-about-friday-the-13th-a-new-beginning/\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

The story takes place at an all-boys preparatory school in the 1950s, where tradition and conformity are the norm. Mr. Keating's unconventional teaching methods ignite a profound transformation in the lives of his students. By instilling a love for poetry, encouraging critical thinking, and inspiring them to seize the day, Keating inspires a revolt against the suffocating conventions of society. As we journey back to Welton Academy's revered halls, we'll discover a tale that still resonates with audiences today, reminding us of the enduring influence of non-traditional instructors, the quest for passion, and the timeless words: \"Carpe Diem.\"\n\nSo grab your copy of âFive Centuries of Verseâ, stand on your desk to declare âO Captain, My Captainâ, and then join us at the old Indian cave off campus as Tim Williams and guest co-hosts Laramy Wells & Nicholas Pepin discuss âDead Poets Societyâ from 1989 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nTo help guide Robin Williams' performance, Peter Weir nicknamed the character \"Robin Keating\" to incorporate some of Williams' own off-the-cuff dialogue into the script.\n\nDuring filming, Robin Williams was somber due to his ongoing divorce, resulting in no joking around between takes, as recalled by Norman Lloyd.\n\nThe emotional scene where Todd Anderson cries in the snow was done in one take. Originally meant to be indoors, the director moved it outside due to snowfall, which was about to stop. Ethan Hawke delivered a powerful performance, nailing it in one take.\n\nDuring the premiere, Kurtwood Smith noticed a family where the father was domineering his son, much like his own character in the film. After the movie, Smith saw the family leaving and noticed the father crying.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on our podcast!

This 80âs flick sequel is the third installment of George Lucas's space-faring epic and draws us back into a galaxy far, far away, where the eternal struggle between light and darkness reaches its crescendo.\n\nThe saga continues with Luke Skywalker as he discovers the truth about his family tree and battles the treacherous Emperor Palpatine with the help of his brave companions, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Lando Calrissian, and the faithful Chewbacca. While the Rebel Alliance entreats its final battle against the oppressive Galactic Empire, the movie captivates its viewers not only with its cutting-edge special effects but also by exploring the emotions and motivations of its characters.\n\nSo, ready your lightsabers and remember to use the Force as we journey back to a time when the Ewoks danced, the new Death Star was vanquished, and Anakin Skywalker's legacy was ultimately defined as Tim Williams and guest co-host, Chris McMichen, discuss âStar Wars: Return of the Jediâ from 1983 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nDuring filming, Carrie Fisher showed genuine concern for Warwick Davis' comfort, who had to spend long hours in a hot Ewok costume. She even went out of her way to bring him cookies and chocolate milk to enjoy during breaks. Davis fondly remembered her kindness, saying \"She was everything an eleven-year-old Ewok could possibly wish for.\"\n\nAlthough Luke is a Jedi, he exhibits certain behaviors that might attract him to the Dark Side, including using Force-choking, getting furious at Darth Vader when he threatens to convert Leia to the Dark Side, and dressing in black. Additionally, his attack on all of Jabba's henchmen at the sail barge could suggest signs of being drawn to the Dark Side. Nevertheless, even though Yoda instructed Luke that Jedi never use their powers for aggression, the original novel implies that attacking is acceptable only when a Jedi is outnumbered.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nWe would love to hear your thoughts about our podcast!

Thanks to this 80s flick sequel, the answer remains the sameâGhostbusters! Taking place five years after the team's first victory over the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and Gozer, the Ghostbusters have fallen out of business and out of favor with the city they fought so hard to protect. But when a malicious slime starts to cause chaos and empower the evil Vigo the Carpathian, the Ghostbusters are called out of retirement to save the day once again. So strap on your proton packs, call Janine and Lewis to babysit, and crank up the siren in Ecto-1 as Tim Williams, and guest co-host Laramy Wells from \"Moving Panels\" Podcast discuss âGhostbusters 2â from 1989 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nWhen Peter arrives at Ray's Occult book-store, pretending to be a strange customer looking for a particular book, the gag was originally intended to be that Peter had previously made a prank phone call to Ray asking for the book, and Ray realizing it was Peter who made the call when he arrives at the store repeating the act. The prank call was not used in the final edit of the film, resulting in it seeming that Peter is just fooling around as he enters the shop.\n\nA key prop in Ghostbusters II is the portrait of Vigo, in which the spirit of the 16th century warlord resides. The original plan had been to use an actual oil painting, and an artist was commissioned to produce it. However, it was soon realised that this would look unconvincing when Vigo stepped out of the painting and into the real world. Instead, actor Wilhem von Homburg was photographed whilst in full costume as Vigo. This photograph was then blown up to full gallery portrait size, and put through filters to make it look as much like an oil painting as possible.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nhttps://www.moviefone.com/news/ghostbusters-2-trivia/\n\nhttps://www.eightieskids.com/12-spooky-facts-you-probably-never-knew-about-ghostbusters-ii/\n\nWe would love to hear your thoughts about our podcast!

It was like a bomb went off and re-ignited the buddy cop genre with a bang! The perfect mix of an established director, two lead actors with undeniable chemistry, and an up-and-coming screenwriterâs knack for snappy odd-couple banter created a formula that was ripe for a follow-up. So when Warner Bros decided to make a sequel, they went all out. They pumped up the budget, added more comedic moments, and dialed down the dark and gloomy tones of the original. The result is an 80s flick sequel that was so insanely anticipated, they unleashed it right in the heart of the 1989 summer blockbuster movie season. So jump into the Murtaugh family station wagon, avoid going through the drive-thru, and be sure to bring the Krugerrands, if you have âdiplomatic immunityâ, as Tim Williams and guest co-host Nicholas Pepin, from \"Pop Culture Roulette\" Podcast, discuss âLethal Weapon 2â from 1989 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nLethal Weapon 2 was one of the first times that a Hollywood production displayed only the filmâs title at the start, without going on to list any further cast and crew credits. Early exceptions to this rule, which has become the norm for most modern-day films, were the original Star Wars trilogy films and 1989âs Ghostbusters II.\n\nIn the scene in the hotel pool after the failed assassination, Leo Getz says he's laundered half a billion dollars, \"give or take a few\". In the following scene where he explains how he laundered the money, he says \"two percent, standard\" is his fee. That comes to around $10 million in profit during his laundering career.\n\nThe scene where Murtaugh does his \"Free South Africa\" tirade - his statement of \"One man, one vote\" did, in fact, become part of then-South Africa's President F.W. de Klerk's agenda to end apartheid, lift the ban on the African National Congress (in the film, protesters outside the South African Consulate had the ANC flag), and released Nelson Mandela from incarceration. Danny Glover portrayed Nelson Mandela in the made-for-cable HBO film \"Mandela\", filmed before the release of the first Lethal Weapon film.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nhttps://www.eightieskids.com/things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-lethal-weapon-2/\n\nWe would love to hear your thoughts about our podcast!

The name itself evokes images of a relentless warrior, a solitary figure pushed to his limits, and an embodiment of pure adrenaline-fueled heroism. At the heart of his enduring legacy lies this 80s Flick sequel that propelled the franchise to new heights. While the first film introduced audiences to the tormented veteran struggling to readjust to civilian life, the sequel thrusts Rambo back into the heat of battle as a one-man army risking his life to rescue forgotten prisoners of war from a Vietnam camp and their Russian allies. So grab your red headband, custom-made survival knife, and explosive arrowheads as Tim Williams and guest co-host, Gerry D from \"Totally Rad Christmas\" Podcast, discuss âRambo: First Blood Part IIâ on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback Podcast.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nThe close-up shots of Rambo preparing for his next mission along with his iconic knife, were actually shot in a hotel room on what Cosmatos dubbed âHurricane Dayâ since they could not leave the hotel due to the hurricane outside.\n\nAccording to the stats given by Murdock, Rambo has 59 confirmed kills during the Vietnam War. However, Rambo kills 74 people during the course of this film, which spans two days. So, in two days, Rambo kills more people than his whole time in the war.\n\nDespite its anti-government stance, President Ronald Reagan was a big fan of this film.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nhttps://www.bulletproofaction.com/2022/05/21/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-rambo-first-blood-part-ii/\n\nhttps://www.eightieskids.com/dangerously-explosive-facts-about-rambo-first-blood-part-ii/\n\nWe would love to hear your thoughts about our podcast!

They even collaborated on a screenplay for a sequel titled National Lampoon's Australian Vacation, but unfortunately, the project was abandoned due to the difficulty of coming up with new ideas beyond a few shark-related gags.\n\nAlong with Caddyshack II (1988) and Nothing But Trouble (1991) this is one of few films Chevy Chase has said he regrets starring in and thus his least favorite Vacation movie.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes\n\nhttps://www.slashfilm.com/870581/why-amy-heckerling-hated-working-on-national-lampoons-european-vacation/\n\nWe would love to hear your thoughts about our podcast!

Joined by reluctant lounge singer Willie Scott and the wise-cracking Short Round, Dr. Jones battles his way through treacherous jungles, dark catacombs, and a heart-stopping mine cart chase that had audiences gripping the edge of their seats!\n\nSo, grab your fedora, dust off your leather jacket, and prepare for an exotic dinner you will never forget as Tim Williams and guest co-host, Nicholas Pepin from \"Pop Culture Roulette\" Podcast, discuss \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" from 1984 on this episode of the 80s Flick Flashback.\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nOne of the biggest mysteries in the Indiana Jones franchise is how the first human sacrifice victim manages to survive after having his heart ripped out of his chest. This is likely due to the magical nature of the stones.\n\nThe team of Lucas, Huyck, and Katz had been working on the production of Radioland Murders since the early 1970s. The opening music from that script was utilized in Temple of Doom. According to Spielberg, George wanted to begin the movie with a musical number that featured a Busby Berkeley dance routine. In their story meetings, George constantly reminded Steven of his desire to direct musicals, and Steven found the idea intriguing.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nâThe Making of the Temple of Doom: Indiana Jones Behind the Scenesâ Documentary\n\nSend us an email or reach out to us on social media to let us know what you liked, what you loved, what we may have missed, or what 80's movie we should discuss next!

The director â who himself was wounded twice while serving with the US Army in Vietnam â famously put his cast through a grueling \"boot campâ to help immerse them in the world of their fictional characters. With an all-star cast and loads of visually striking practical effects, this Vietnam War epic won more awards than any other film during the 59th Academy Awards. So prepare for digging foxholes, waking up with ant bites and surviving ambush duty as Tim Williams and guest co-host JB Huffman from \"Manly Movies\" Podcast discuss âPlatoonâ from 1986 on this episode of the 80âs Flick Flashback Podcast!\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nBig Harold falls and rolls down a hill during the opening credits. Forest Whitaker claims it was a real, unintentional fall.\n\nWhen they are cleaning the latrines, you can hear \"Good morning Vietnam\". A recording of the real Cronauer. This film came out a year before that movie.\n\nMilitary advisor Dale Dye witnessed Oliver Stone suffer an attack of post-traumatic stress disorder on-set while filming the village scene. He claimed that they had a good cry together afterwards, based on their mutual experience in Vietnam.\n\nThe final battle in the movie was a recreation of an actual event that was witnessed by technical advisor Dale Dye, who was a combat correspondent with the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines.\n\nToward the end of the film, when the reinforcements arrive after the battle, Rhah reaches into a dead VC's breast pocket, pulls something out, and keeps it, while looking around nervously. The item he is removing is heroin, which VC soldiers used as a painkiller. Many heroin-addicted U.S. troops did the same thing. The scene implies that Rhah's mystical quality is a symptom of a larger problem.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes\n\nhttps://coffeeordie.com/5-things-platoon\n\n\"A Tour of the Inferno: The Making of Platoon\" (2002) Documentary\n\n\"Brothers In Arms: The Making of Platoon\" (2018) Documentary\n\nSend us an email or reach out to us on social media to let us know what you liked, what you loved, what we may have missed, or what 80's movie we should discuss next!

Despite primarily negative reviews, it still did well at the box office and was a mainstay on cable television over the years, making it beloved by those who were watching basic cable channels in the late 80s and early 90s. So break out the calculators, get ready to spend some cash, and watch out for the oncoming train in the back of the baseball field as Tim Williams and guest co-hosts Nicholas Pepin and Chad Sheppard discuss âBrewsterâs Millionsâ from 1985 on this episode of the 80âs Flick Flashback Podcast!\n\nHere are some additional behind-the-scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nAnne, Princess Royal, only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, was in Los Angeles and paid a visit to the set of Brewster's Millions as part of her itinerary. She was greeted by Candy and producer Joel Silver; Candy and the princess discussed a fire that had recently broken out at Pinewood Studios in England. She was scheduled to visit a scene involving Richard Pryor, but it was shot a day earlier, as Hill had production ahead of schedule. \"I don't think she even knows Richard Pryor,\" an observer was quoted as saying. \"I'm sure she was more excited at meeting John Candy, who's a Canadian citizen.\"\n\nWalter Hill, director of The Warriors and 48 Hrs., admitted in 1988 that at the time the only film he didn't make out of passion was Brewster's Millions. Hill made the movie to \"improve his bank account and success quotient.\"\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo\n\nhttps://www.mentalfloss.com/article/80146/10-rich-facts-about-brewsters-millions\n\nSend us an email or reach out to us on social media to let us know what you liked, what you loved, what we may have missed, or what 80's movie we should discuss next!

As per series tradition, Jason was played by yet another stuntman in 'The Final Chapter,' this time Ted White. He did not like Feldman. When it came time to film the famous scene near the end when Jason reaches through a broken window to pull Tommy out of a house, White got to act out his frustration. They had worked out the timing of when White would grab Feldman beforehand, but during filming White waited a couple of beats to the point that Feldman assumed the stunt had gone wrong. So, just as he let his guard down White grabbed him exactly as you see in the film, meaning Feldman's screams of horror were completely authentic.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes\n\nSend us an email or reach out to us on social media to let us know what you liked, what you loved, what we may have missed, or what 80's movie we should discuss next!

While âThe Breakfast Clubâ and âFerris Buellerâs Day Offâ might have garnered all of the attention, it was this 80s flick that took the âteen movieâ from raunchy sex-comedy to more serious themes of losing innocence, living with regret, and navigating independence at such a young age. Released to little fanfare, with many expecting it to fail, the film became a surprise hit, showing the value of the teenage market.

His original reviews states âMaybe that's because it's not about âloveâ as a Hollywood concept, but about love as growth, as learning to accept other people for who and what they are. There's romance in this movieâ¦but what makes the film so special is that the (romance) and everything else is presented within the context of its characters finding out who they are, what they stand for and what they will not stand for.â Get ready to be swept off your feet and let love lift you up where you belong as Tim Williams and guest co-host, Ron West, discuss âAn Officer and A Gentlemanâ from 1982 on this episode of the 80âs Flick Flashback Podcast!\n\nHere are some additional behind the scenes trivia we were unable to cover in this episode:\n\nIn his book An Actor and a Gentleman Louis Gossett Jr. says that although he was honored to win his Oscar for this film especially being in competition with other veteran actors, he was disappointed that his co-star Richard Gere was not only not nominated for an Oscar, but he felt Gere should have been nominated and even won an Oscar for his role in this film. Many critics and others agreed with Gossett's sentiment feeling Gere should have been nominated for this performance, and as of January 2022 Gere has yet to be nominated for an Oscar.\n\nPaula (Debra Winger) shows Zach (Richard Gere) a photograph of her biological father, revealing that he was an Officer Candidate.

But in a way it makes sense. Both Superman and Santa are legendary superheroes, able to cure our pains through magical intervention. Both of them can fly through the air. Both have large supporting casts: Superman has Lois Lane, Jimmy Olson and Perry White, while Santa has Mrs. Claus, the elves and, of course, Dasher, Donner and Blitzen.

They settled on the example of Christmas Eve in New York, where people are nice to each other for one night, believing it to be a \"miracle we could live with\".\n\nMurray was concerned with how he should portray the final scene, with Glazer telling him to follow the script. Wanting a central acting moment, however, Murray gave an emotional and manic performance, deviating from his marked positions and improvising his speech. Glazer and O'Donoghue thought that the actor was suffering a mental breakdown. After he was finished, the crew applauded Murray, but O'Donoghue remarked \"What was that? The Jim Jones hour?\" Donner turned and punched O'Donoghue in the arm, leaving him bruised for a week.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes,\n\nhttps://www.mentalfloss.com/article/71730/22-fun-facts-about-scrooged\n\nSend us an email or reach out to us on social media to let us know what you liked, what you loved, what we may have missed, or what 80's movie we should discuss next!
