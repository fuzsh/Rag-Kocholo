In this video, we dive deep into the structure and triggers of laughter behind some hilarious stand-up comedy jokes. In this episode, we break down individual jokes, explaining their premise, setup, and punchline. We also discuss the comedy structures and laughter triggers used, such as: Compare and Contrast Incongruity Misdirection Exaggeration Double Entendres VAKS Fluff in Stand up Comedy Writing Irony Simple Truth Call Back Running Gag Don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more content that makes you laugh and think about comedy in a whole new way!\n\nHow are stand-up comedians faring with the boom in social media comedy? Bloomberg has it that stand-up comedy trebled in 10 years. Much of this is due to COVID-19 and the fact that comedians had no work, so resorted to SM. That aside, NETFLIX has played a role, offering up-and-coming comedians a platform to reach the world. But how do NETFLIX find their comedy stars? Why, social media, of course! With social media now, the days of sitcom stars being the only ones out there doing their bit for comedy are history. Much hard work and plenty of posts gives social media comedians access to a wider audience, and the pressure is not on them to make everyone laugh all at once. They build up their following in their own time. There is pressure though… SM platforms censor bad language and sensitive issues. So, what’s a man, or girl, to do? Censor their posts and lose engagement? Algorithms too, put pressure on SM comedians to come up with regular posts that are short and succinct. But, there’s enough silver to cross your palm and make a living on SM, and many are happy just to stay there and reap the rewards. We can’t all be NETFLIX or Comedy Central stars. #creators #joinKLIQ https://lnkd.in/evSkyF-e\n\nImagine sitting in front of the television, watching a comedy show, and realizing that the jokes don’t quite make you laugh. Many of us have experienced this with traditional comedy shows that often struggled to resonate with everyone in the room due to their scripted routines and limited interaction. Today's generation, growing up with the internet, might not relate to this. Social media has democratized comedy, allowing for diverse voices and perspectives to find their audience. Comedians now have the freedom to create unique content and reach a broader audience, revitalizing the art form to make it more accessible and relatable.
