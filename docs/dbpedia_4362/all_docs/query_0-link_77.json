Availability of water, good harbors (very important historically), workable land and other needed resources.\n\nThere is almost never a set of city planners that sit down and weigh all the pros and cons of a location ... they just tend to initially happen as people find what they need and start laying down roots.\n\nIf you live in the North, you take what you can get. These guys are just trying to improve a little on that.\n\nWashington DC used to be a malarial swamp and New Orleans is apparently below sea level. Did the city planners do a piss-poor job? Or were there other features that made it desirable?\n\nNobody comes along and says \"we're going to build a thriving city here\" -- well, China has apparently done it, and they're empty. I suspect most cities started in a much more random and organic manner."
