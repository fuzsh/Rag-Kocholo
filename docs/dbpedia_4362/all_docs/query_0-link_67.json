Comedians fling barbs, and nobody takes anything very seriously.\n\nBut in mid-March, on the night of Susan Rice's 30th anniversary show, the atmosphere is more like a family reunion than a typical comedy show. Warmth and affection flood the room at Northeast Portland's\n\nWith a boisterous laugh and outgoing personality, Rice greets those in attendance, embraces friends and family, and accepts a bouquet of flowers.\n\nGabe Dinger, a popular young stand-up in town, greets the audience and announces that he and other comics are here to celebrate \"one amazing comedian, Susan Rice.\"\n\nDinger is followed by other comics. Some are members of the younger generation of Portland performers, like Shane Torres, who jokes, \"It's nice to be here at Susan's AARP meeting.\"\n\nArt Krug, who came up in comedy with Rice during the Portland 1980s comedy boom, recalls that he and Rice used to be roommates.\n\nFinally, Dinger introduces \"the most wonderful human being on the face of the Earth!\"\n\nThough plenty of other funny people have already preceded her, there's no doubt who the star of the show is. With her graying black hair framing her face, the 61-year-old Rice takes the stage with an energy comics half her age would envy. Her language is salty -- \"I have a potty mouth,\" she says -- and her polished routine touches on sex, her own plus-size shape, the small annoyances of everyday life, and aging.\n\n\"The best thing about getting older?\" she says. \"Being able to slap people who ask stupid questions.\"\n\nRice has the audience in the palm of her hand. Then she dials down the pace, to share some personal memories about her years in comedy. She tells a story about visiting her ailing father in the hospital in March of 1983.\n\nShe went to see him fresh from the Leaky Roof pub in Southwest Portland, where Rice got up onstage and made people laugh.\n\n\"I told him, 'Dad, I know what I want to be when I grow up,'\" she recalls of her then-31-year-old self. \"I want to be a stand-up comic!\"\n\nHer father wakes up, she says. And he tells her, \"OK, be careful.\"\n\nPortland Comedy Profiles\n\nIn recent years, the Portland comedy scene has boomed, with open-mic events almost every night, two stand-up comedy clubs and an ever-growing number of comedians. This is one in an occasional series of profiles of the people who make Portland such a funny town.\n\nPortland is in the midst of a comedy boom, and it's not the first time that's happened. In the 1980s, when Rice was getting started, the local comedy scene was packed with places to perform and ambitious comics eager to get stage time.\n\nIt was part of a nationwide stand-up comedy explosion, which saw comedy clubs popping up in cities across the country. The comedy gold rush led TV network executives to find up-and-coming comics and build sitcoms around them, as happened with Roseanne Barr and Jerry Seinfeld. But by the early 1990s, the comedy club scene was deflating, a victim of oversaturation even as more and more comics turned up in their own TV series.\n\nThrough it all, boom and bust, and now in the midst of another comedy revival, Rice kept going and kept audiences laughing.\n\n\"She can go and handle any room, even what you would call the rowdies,\" says David Tribble, president of Entertainment Solutions Inc. in Vancouver. Tribble has been booking Rice in comedy venues since she first started out.\n\n\"She can go in and grab a crowd, no matter what,\" says Tribble. \"She doesn't strong-arm, she's a pro. It's not everybody that can do that. She reads crowds very well.\"\n\nThough she seems born to do stand-up comedy, Rice says her first love was acting. She grew up in Longview, which she remembers as \"Andy Hardyville. It was wonderful.\"\n\nHer father was an architect and her mother worked for a dentist before getting married and having three children.\n\nRice, the youngest of the three kids, remembers the family listening to the radio and then getting a TV. Her mother enjoyed comedians like Totie Fields, Jonathan Winters, Mort Sahl and Bob Newhart.\n\n\"I wanted to be Judy Garland,\" Rice recalls. She then went through an early folkie phase, playing guitar and singing tunes by Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and Peter, Paul and Mary.\n\nIn college, Rice studied theater and when she moved from Longview to Portland in the early 1980s -- \"I got an apartment in Northwest Portland for $75 a month\" -- she got roles in plays around town. She had a day job, working at a bank in the loan department. When homeowners racked up late fees on their mortgage payments, Rice's soft heart -- \"I'd just waive the charges\" -- would get her a talking-to by her supervisor.\n\nBut her heart, it was clear, wasn't in banking. Or, to her surprise, in theater. Comedy had gotten under her skin. The story about seeing her father in the hospital and telling him her plan is true, she says.\n\n\"After I told him I want to be a stand-up comic, he opened one eye and said, 'Well, just be careful.'\" Rice laughs and recalls that he died not long after that. \"He never got to see me do stand-up. But we laughed so hard at his funeral.\"\n\nThe early days performing around the Northwest were full of laughter and learning. \"I got asked to open for Jerry Seinfeld, and I didn't know who he was.\" At first, Rice was approaching comedy like the theater veteran she was. \"I was doing monologues and stories, character things. In theater, I knew how to get a laugh. Physically, I was funny. I'd come onstage and get a laugh -- I didn't have to open my mouth.\" She pauses, then adds, with pinpoint comic timing, \"Doesn't say much about my dating life.\"\n\nBeing a woman in comedy wasn't the easiest way to build romantic relationships, says Rice, who never married. She wasn't prepared for the rough-and-tumble life of the traveling comic.\n\n\"I was raised with manners,\" she recalls. Indeed, she welcomes guests to her cozy home in North Portland with a refreshing fruit juice-spritzer beverage and an artfully arranged plate of cookies and fresh fruit.\n\n\"I learned to swim with a book on my head. When I got into stand-up, I was way too polite. I realized I was out here on the road by myself. And it got scary. I was thrown into condos with strangers, and I had to be tougher and not mix with business with pleasure.\"\n\nRice dated some comics, she says, and she noticed time passing.\n\n\"Tick-tock,\" she says. \"I thought, 'Am I going to get married and have kids?'\" It turned out she didn't. \"Nobody asked. By 40, I figured I'm probably going to be doing this alone. It's a choice. I made a choice. I met some wonderful men, though.\"\n\nFor Portland comedians who build career momentum, the question usually comes up: Should I move to Los Angeles, to find more opportunities? Rice -- who had quit her job at the bank in 1985 to do comedy fulltime -- made the jump in 1986. She remembers hanging out at the famous L.A. club, the Comedy Store. \"There's Louie Anderson, Robin Williams, Richard Belzer, Sam Kinison, and I'm in the conversation. Just pinch me.\"\n\nShe got some TV gigs, including a spot in 1989 on\n\nThis was another attempt by CBS to compete with \"The Tonight Show\" in the late-night arena, and Sajak, who had made a splash as host of \"Wheel of Fortune,\" was very hot at the time.\n\nUnfortunately, Rice appeared in the first week of Sajak shows, and \"there was no studio audience,\" as she recalls. \"I was on the third show, and by that time they're asking the band members if they know people to come in and sit in the audience.\"\n\nThe few audience members who were there when Rice did her stand-up routine weren't exactly a hooting-and-hollering crowd. \"There was nobody in that audience that was under 85,\" she says. \"And I started off with an arthritis joke.\"\n\nSajak's late-night show didn't last long, but Rice dealt with the aftereffects of her disappointing performance for years.\n\n\"I went into a deep depression,\" she says. At the time, she didn't realize \"you always get a second shot. I stalled my career for about five years because of that set. I lost my confidence.\"\n\nBy the early 1990s, when the Seinfeld-era stand-up comedy boom was busting, Rice had logged plenty of years on the road. And when her sister became terminally ill with cancer, Rice began spending more and more time in Portland.\n\n\"I spent most of the summer up here, being with her kids. I kind of fell off the map.\" It was time to return to Portland. \"I was done, and I was broke,\" she recalls, so she moved back to Portland in 1998.\n\nWith her own health on her mind, Rice got a job at the call center for Hanna Andersson, the Portland clothing company. \"I hadn't had a day job since 1985,\" she says. \"But it's a great place to work. I get to talk to grandmas buying clothes for their babies.\"\n\nBut Rice never stopped performing. She still works two to three weekends a month, \"everything from the Elks to Microsoft.\" She's a favorite with \"The Red Hat Society\" groups, which generally consist of older women members.\n\n\"I start coveting their scooters,\" Rice jokes.\n\nHer older brother, Barry Rice, 68, is retired after spending his career working in the dental insurance business, including as executive director of the Oregon Dental Association. His sister, he says, was meant to perform.\n\n\"She always looked at the world a little bit differently than anybody else, and that's how she is able to develop her comedy. She's a great observer of things. She's a joy to have as a sister, and she's as funny in person as she in onstage.\"\n\nWhen she's not working, he says she likes to spend time with her siblings' children, and her cat, Zazzoo, a feral stray now bonded to Susan.\n\nAs she's gotten older, her brother says, \"the filter has come off. She used to filter things with the audience, and how she felt about things, but when she turned 50, she turned the filter off. I think that makes her feel better. She gets the message out whether people agree with it or not. She really hates injustice. She's a very fair person, and she's very empathetic about everybody that has had a rougher road in life.\"\n\nWhen she looks at many of the younger comics around right now, Rice says, there are some she thinks are great and others who don't seem cut out for a comedy career.\n\n\"It's not a hobby,\" she says. \"Comedy is the social consciousness of this country, and if you want to have a voice, you'd better have something to say.\"\n\nRice, at least, has no intention of stopping. As she said on the night of her 30th comedy anniversary show, \"I just hope I can do it for another 30 years.\"\n\n-- Kristi Turnquist"
