It is rumored that Kinison was to portray the \"Peter Blunt\" character, the role eventually went to Randy Quaid.\n\nInterred at Memorial Park Cemetery, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA. Memorial Park Cemetery is located 2 miles East of Interstate 44 (or 1.5 miles West of highway 169), at 51st St and Memorial Ave. Sam's burial site is next to his father and brother in Section 28 - Garden of the Apostles (Southeast quadrant), in the middle of the cemetery.\n\nIn 2011, the press reported that Kinison had a previously unknown illegitimate daughter. Comedian Carl LaBove (who often worked with Kinison) had a paternity test to confirm whether his daughter was actually his biological child. Her DNA did not match that of LaBove, but turned up to be a match for that of Kinison's brother. Implying that Kinison himself had fathered the girl."
