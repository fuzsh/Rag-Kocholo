        "text": "CBS REPORTEDLY HOPING LETTERMAN WILL RETURN\n\nDec. 24, 2023: I know nothing about newsbreak.com, but they published a report today that the success of Dave's appearance with Colbert in November is a sign that he'd do well in a return to late night TV. Oops! They're about to give away the marquee! ALAN KALTER'S CELEBRITY INTERVIEWS: 2005-10\n\nDec. 23, 2023: Christmas has come early. Don \"The Donz\" Giller, who needs no introduction, has miracled together 1.5 dozen episodes of the heartwarming (and ever-so-naughty) Alan Kalter's Celebrity Interview. (YouTube link) Be forewarned that Alan works blue in these segments, and several of them are rated PG-75. My, oh my, I loved Alan's indiscretions on LSDL. Watch closely, won't you? DAVE, PAUL, GAINES AND DARLENE LOVE\n\nDec. 19, 2023: It's a very special \"Barbara Gaines Show,\" because Darlene Love is in the house. Darlene did \"Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home)\" for 28 years on LNDL and LSDL. (Barbara Gaines Show YouTube link) Then there's Paul's discussion of his Cher impression of \"O Holy Night.\" (video link)\n\nBe sure to watch this, because Darlene and Paul reprise \"Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home).\" I loved this tradition so much. It was the Letterman shows' greatest tradition (even better than the tough guy beating up Alan Kalter)!\n\nFinally, if you'd like to go back in time for a number of Darlene's performances, visit my Video Archives, and scroll down the alphabetical list to Darlene Love.\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST: 102nd EPISODE COMPILATION\n\nDec. 15, 2023: I've been very distracted since Part 1 came out. I've just discovered Part 3, and will watch it very soon. Here's the link. I know it will be great. Thanks so much to TV's Don Giller! This blockbuster compilation (2 hrs. 13 min.) focuses on the CBS years, 1993 to 2015. It has the impressive subtitle, \"Inside Stories of David Letterman's Late Night and Late Show, as Told by the Writers, Producers and Musicians Who Guested on The Letterman Podcast.\" This is an exceptional effort... no surprise... by the one and only Don Giller. I'll close for now by reporting that this compilation features 30 guest interviews. I can't wait to see it! Oops. I forgot to put in the link! THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: 101st EPISODE COMPILATION\n\nDec. 12, 2023: I've been very distracted since Part 1 came out. I've just discovered Part 2, and will watch it very soon. Here's the link. I know it will be great. Thanks so much to TV's Don Giller! This compilation is subtitled, \"The Transition from NBC to CBS.\" DAVE'S AUTOGRAPHED JACKET GIVEAWAY\n\nDec. 13, 2023: It's another action-packed episode of The Barbara Gaines Show. (YouTube link) There's been an ongoing raffle for a piece of the Late Show marquee, to benefit Habitat for Humanity. Visit giveawaydave.com to contribute.\n\nWell, now... if you win... you not only get some marquee action, you get your very own 2011 Late Show letter jacket. (I have that jacket - a gift from a Late Show producer who shall not be named - and I love it! It's the warmest thing I've ever owned.)\n\nC. PAUL TILSON-SHAFFER TALKS ABOUT HIS SPECTACLES\n\nDec. 11, 2023: I've often wondered how many pairs of glasses there are in Paul's collection. The answer no doubt falls closer to the hundreds than dozens. Anyway, it's sure more interesting than collecting stamps. Here's Facebook video, with Paul's thoughts on the matter. THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: 100th EPISODE COMPILATION\n\nDec. 9, 2023: You have to see this: the first of four videos... kind of a best of \"The Letterman Podcast,\" with Mike Chisholm. It's focused on the LNDL years. This masterpiece was produced and edited by TV's Don Giller. Huge thanks, of course, to Mike Chisholm, who cooked up and hosted the interviews in the first place.\n\nI must confess that I've just seen the first hour, and I'm typing this while watching. (It's 4:30 A.M. I'll come back soon and fill in the gaps.) Anyway, Mike's guests you'll see include Robert \"Morty\" Morton, Jeff \"Flunky\" Martin, Gerard Mulligan, Fred Graver, Steve Young, Craig Thomas, Daniel Kellison, Tom Ruprecht. This compilation is full of anecdotes about guests, and really interesting stories about how various segments and running gags developed. Don't miss this! And... there are three more parts, yet to come! Thanks so much, TV's Don Giller! You truly are The Donz.\n\nDAVID LETTERMAN VISITS WITH LARRY KING\n\nNov. 26, 2023: A gent on the Cleveland Live Music YouTube channel has posted (three years ago, actually) Larry King's approx. 45-minute audio interview of TV Boy in January 1990. (YouTube link) He's promoting the 8th anniversary show of LNDL, and it's classic Dave from that era. Don't miss it. Hey! Have a look at the right-side navigation column on this YouTube site. There are numerous other interesting interviews from back in the day. GUESS THE THANKSGIVING 2023 PIE\n\nNov. 23, 2023: Today's episode of The Barbara Gaines Show begins with random discussion, with TV's David Letterman, Gaines and Mary Barclay. Then there's a brief segment with a young boy who tells Dave about visiting an upholstery farm. Priceless. Our hosts turn to Dorothy's Thanksgiving pie guesses. Dave brags about Dorothy's amazing pies, definitely including the crusts. Then it's time for pie guessing. (YouTube link) TV's DAVID LETTERMAN RETURNS TO THE ED\n\nNov. 20, 2023: David M. Letterman was a guest on Stephen Colbert's show tonight. Here are some clips. I'll be looking for a full video of the encounter. Thanks, of course, to Mike Chisholm for this.\n\nâ¢ Dave's entrance\n\nâ¢ Dave talks about Green Day and The National / sits at Stephen's desk\n\nâ¢ Mike Chisholm livestreams the show (56 min.) â Don't miss this!\n\nâ¢ Stephen reads his own Top Ten list (4/22/14)\n\nâ¢ Being a talk show host is a strange job. THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: DAN FLAHERTY\n\nNov. 19, 2023: Mike Chisholm's guest, Dan Flaherty, is the first camera operator to appear. Tonight's episode runs 1:48. Dan has all kinds of information about the how and why of behind-the-scenes activity and practices. And... his stories bring back lots of fun memories of segments and one-time events. (YouTube link) DAVE'S HAVING A RETURN VISIT TO THE LATE SHOW\n\nNov. 17, 2023: Deadline.com has reported that TV's David Letterman will visit Stephen Colbert in the Ed Sullivan Theater on Monday, Nov. 20. Air time is 11:35 P EST. (Facebook link) THE BARBARA GAINES SHOW: MARQUEE EPISODE\n\nNov. 15, 2023: It's the latest edition of The Barbara Gaines Show, starring TV's Barbara Gaines, David M. Letterman, and Mary Barclay.\n\nThe topic is the interplanetary raffle for one of the pieces of the Late Show with David Letterman marquee. (www.giveawaydave.com) Scroll down to Nov. 9 on this page, if you'd like to see the original announcement. Now... as you might expect, Mr. Letterman disrupts the promotion by warning us that displaying the sizable marquee on one's home is likely to result in a citation for some kind of zoning violation, or homeowners' association transgression. (Well... Rupert Jee sure never registered any complaints about virtually living under the thing, while on Broadway.) Then TV Boy further distracts the telecast by asserting that Mary Barclay is an offspring of Barbara Gaines. Is he a master of promotion, or what? Regardless of all this... my compliments to Barbara and Mary for their considerable patience with the King of Late Night's antics. (Facebook video link)\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST: ADAM UNGER\n\nNov. 13, 2023: Adam Unger was Warren Zevon's \"guy.\" From my episode logs, it appears that Warren appeared on LNDL 8 times, and on LSDL 30 times... and this doesn't include mentions of Warren over the years, and tributes to him after he died. Mike Chisholm, our host, chose to post this podcast live, while recording for later viewing. It runs 02:47!\n\nAdam began helping compile historical documentation of Warren Zevon's work. He put great effort into it, and turned out volumes of information on Warren. Even his early work was so impressive that he was invited to continue with similar projects. Warren Zevon - over about 27 years on Letterman shows - became a good friend of Dave and his staff. This is demonstrated... among other ways... by the fact that Warren sat in for Paul Shaffer a number of times, when Paul was under the weather, or there were Jewish holidays. OK... here's your Facebook video link. Finally, remember to Enjoy Every Sandwich.\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST: TIM KENNEDY\n\nNov. 10, 2023: Tim Kennedy was with LSDL from 1995-2015. He had been the technical director for the CBS Evening News, when Dan Rather was doing it. After LSDL, he worked for Colbert's show for four years. This podcast runs 01:23. Thanks to 20 years with Letterman shows, Tim has all manner of stories for us. My episode logs show: 1. Tim recognized in 9/12/05 [2424] for - along with others - winning an Emmy for technical work. 2. And, on that episode, Tim put away the Late Show bear. 3. On 7/12/10 [3338], Tim got another shout out for his technical directing Emmy nomination. 4. Guess what! On 7/23/12 [3706], we learned that Tim was nominated again. [How about this? As I was watching the podcast, I was searching for Tim in my episode logs. Just as I was typing, Mike started talking to Tim about a shelf full of Emmy awards in the background!.] 5. A couple of times in 2014, Tim was seen in an episode of \"Backstage Photo Club.\"\n\nI salute Tim Kennedy for his long-time contributions to LSDL, and for being an excellent guest on the podcast. Finally, I continue to be amazed at the encyclopedic knowledge Mike Chisholm has of the Letterman shows. Not only that... he's doing an outstanding job of communicating whatever he's reporting or discussing. / Here's the YouTube link!\n\nWILL LEE HAS JUST RELEASED AN ALBUM.\n\nNov. 9, 2023: I just learned about this. Here it is, on YouTube. To get it via another source, here you go. WIN THE RAFFLE FOR THE LATE SHOW MARQUEE\n\nNov. 9, 2023: The Hollywood Reporter has posted a notice about a raffle to benefit Habitat for Humanity. The grand prize is the beloved Late Show marquee. (photo by DDY, June 2008) Actually, it may be that what you'd win is one of the end pieces of the marquee.\n\nTo enter, visit this link. Any donation of $10 or more gets you one entry into the contest. To view the announcement video (with Dave and Paul), visit the LETTERMAN channel on YouTube.\n\nSTAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: DENCY NELSON\n\nNov. 7, 2023: Dency Nelson had a few roles on Dave's shows: cue cards on the morning show in 1980, a talent researcher for LNDL in 1982, and a stage manager with Biff. He has all kinds of fun memories. Be sure to click on this! Oh... there's a little bit of &%$#@ÃÂ§Ã¯Â¿Â½, so fast-forward through the Andy Kaufman / Jerry Lawler segment, if you wish. Thanks much to Dency for a very enjoyable look back! THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: AMY CHERIN HUMES\n\nNov. 3, 2023: Amy Humes started as a page in the early 1990s, then was a stage manager, and an assistant to Jerry Foley, early in his time as the director of LSDL. Mike Chisholm has been telling us that a lot of his best podcasts have been with individuals who aren't the most well-known Letterman staff, but who have all kinds of inside info and stories about interactions with guests, etc. Amy has nonstop stories about how things worked, etc. I definitely recommend this podcast. It runs almost 1Â½ hours! (YouTube link) STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: WILL LEE\n\nOct. 31, 2023: At long last, thanks to THE LETTERMAN CHANNEL, we get to hear from the great Will Lee! Don't let another day go by without watching this. (YouTube link) Will was with both Letterman late night shows for the full 33 years, on bass guitar. (Of course, he's an excellent singer, too.) He could tell stories for days on end about the countless musical guests he played with, and memorable moments on the shows. Be sure to have a look at the first link above, which lists the amazing variety of musical performances and recordings he's been part of. He's been involved with over 2,000 albums! I watched him on Dave's shows for 33 years, and must admit that I didn't have any idea how many different artists he's worked with.\n\nWhen I met Will, some years ago, and told him that I was from Manhattan, Kansas, I got a surprised look from him. That's because his dad, Dr. William Franklin Lee III, was at that time the leader of the International Association for Jazz Education, and I knew that Will had been to my home town to visit his parents.\n\nOn November 30, 1985, in the Late Night years, the band (at that time, The World's Most Dangerous Band) produced an epic video, Dress Cool. (Thanks, Don Giller.) A whole lot of work went into producing this... music, special effects, costumes and editing. Merrill Markoe directed it. It's tremendous! / Hey! The aforementioned Don Giller has a fun, 15-minute video, World's Most Dangerous Band Comedy Segments on Letterman, 1987.\n\nThese days, Will is keeping busy with his Beatles tribute band, The Fab Faux. (They have two shows scheduled in November 2023.)\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST: SUE HUM\n\nOct. 27, 2023: Costume Designer Sue Hum joined Mike Chisholm for an hour, to tell us all about how she brought together the annual Halloween Costumes segment. My logs show this going back to 1983. There's no point for me to write much about this awesome podcast, because Sue gives countless details about how this beloved tradition came together. Here's the YouTube podcast link. Also, here a link to 21 years' worth of Halloween Costumes, from DDY's Late Show Fan Page. ALAN KALTER HIGHLIGHTS COLLECTION, 1995 - 2015\n\nOct. 25, 2023: Wake the kids. Phone the neighbors! TV's Don Giller posted this extravaganza on Halloween 2021. It's 2 hrs. 50 min. of fun, featuring Alan, and it's time to watch it again. Thanks, Don! (YouTube link) THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: STEVE MAZAN\n\nOct. 23, 2023: Steve Mazan (pronounced MayZAHN) is a stand-up comedian and Emmy Award winner. Back in 2011, he faced a serious health concern. A documentary, Dying to Do Letterman, was produced. A dream of his came true, and Steve got to do stand-up on episode 9/04/09 [3177]. So... the documentary is not just about having that dream, but fulfilling it. (YouTube link) This interview runs 01:56!\n\nComedians who really had an impact on Steve included Sam Kinison and Andy Kaufman.\n\nMORTY'S FIRST DAY AS LNDL PRODUCER\n\nOct. 22, 2023: This is fun. Morty kind of gets baptized by fire, compliments of Dave, as he's the new producer. I didn't start keeping episode logs until 1985 - and they were very minimal at first - so I don't have a date for this. Anyway, it's fun. (video link) PAUL'S STILL OUT THERE, GETTIN' IT DONE\n\nOct. 18, 2023: Paul Shaffer, who needs no introduction in these parts, was on keyboard duty for The Kelly Clarkson Show recently, on NBC. (video link) They performed Patti LaBelle's New Attitude.\n\nKelly appeared on LSDL on 5/06/03 [1977], 5/08/07 [2749] and 7/13/09 [3148]. By the way... if you can imagine this... Paul was wearing designer spectacles.\n\nWAHOO! MIKE McINTEE'S STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS\n\nOct. 17, 2023: This is awesome! The LETTERMAN CHANNEL has just posted a blockbuster Staff Favorite Moments video, narrated by Wahoo Mike McIntee. Mike was tremendous to all of us at the annual DaveCons. He's referred to here as Production Coordinator, but in the latest credits roll for the show, he was an Associate Producer. Mike was with LSDL from 1994 to 2015.\n\nA huge contribution to the Letterman experience was his online recap after each episode, the Wahoo Gazette. The name came, no doubt, from LSDL calling Wahoo, Nebraska the home office. In April 1996, there was a competition between Grand Rapids, Michigan and Wahoo, Nebraska to be designated as the latest Home Office. On May 3, 1996, Dave proclaimed that Wahoo won. Anyway, sadly, this fun publication did not survive the end of the Late Show, as it was on cbs.com. Anyway, Part 2... After every episode, Mike posted his Wahoo Gazette, Don Giller added all manner of details to his Super Secret Internet Database, and I wrote my episode log. It was great fun comparing what I wrote about the show to Mike's gazette, especially since he had inside knowledge that I didn't have as a civilian.\n\nMike gives us the back stories on how segments that included him came together. He played a police officer now and then, and a ticket scalper. He stood in for Alan Kalter as announcer. He helped dump about 20 gallons of gravy on Dave at his desk. He was the pope. And his fans called him Wahoo Mike. Don't miss his stories: (YouTube link)\n\nRUPERT JEE'S RETIREMENT EVENT: VIDEO!\n\nOct. 10, 2023: I have no idea why Dave wasn't at the retirement whoopteedo, but earlier today, Dave posted a video to the Letterman channel on YouTube. It's 41-action packed minutes! Comments from Dave quickly transitioned to video of the retirement event festivities. (YouTube link) RUPERT JEE AND MAY THANK LETTERMAN STAFF\n\nOct. 10, 2023: Mike Chisholm of The Letterman Podcast was asked by Rupert Jee to pass on his gratitude for the retirement party in the Ed Sullivan Theater on October 6. Here's Rupert's message:\n\n\"Dear Late Show Family,\n\nWe send our heartfelt thanks to Dave for his gracious and generous kindness; to you, Walter, Nancy & the LS gang for your impeccable planning and HARD WORK. The celebration ws a memorable goodbye, and more so, a sentimental reunion of the Letterman Family.\n\nWalter, thanks for your great MC - hosting. The warm and funny speeches from Tom, Kathy, Mike, Chris and Tanya touched us all.\n\nWe were so pleased by the video presentations from Jill, Donick, Jon, Steve and, of course, the great Mr. Letterman!\n\nAnd Matt, it meant so much to us that you came from London, even though a Rupert Jee T-shirt was a meager compensation. Loving thanks go to all who traveled long distance to be with us.\n\nPaul, we cannot thank you enough for the support, on & off camera, you have given us through the years. Your musical performance, enhanced by the Vegas-style dancers, livened our celebration all the more!\n\nHow lucky we were to be among the sharpest minds and hardest workers of the entertainment industry of our Country! Thank you all for honoring us, giving us a journey that dreams are made of!\n\nOur love goes out to all of you!\n\nAlways,\n\nRupert and May\n\nHello Deli NY\"\n\nCHRIS ELLIOTT IS PAUL SHAFFER\n\nOct. 8, 2023: The LETTERMAN channel reportedly got a request for this gem. We can't have enough of Chris Elliott portraying C. Paul Tilson-Shaffer. From LNDL 3/25/87, here you go. (Paul was back moments after the performance, and said he was OK with it.) RUPERT'S RETIREMENT PARTY\n\nOct. 6, 2023: Bob Borden has posted a picture with Rupert at his retirement party. The location is the Ed Sullivan Theater, of all places! (Hello Deli is part of that building.) I can't imagine going to NYC without visiting Hello Deli. I certainly thank Rupert for his hospitality and friendship at our annual DaveCons, and wish him and May all the best. (Facebook link)\n\nHere we have Rupert briefly addressing attendees at his Hello Deli retirement event in the Ed Sullivan Theater on Oct. 6. Thanks to Marilyn Sargent for this. (video)\n\nMy Late Show episode logs' first record of Rupert dates back to episode 16, as Dave was meeting his neighbors:\n\n9/20/93 [16]: more visits to neighbors around Broadway / A heretofore unknown deli owner named Rupert Jee comes in and gets a standing ovation.\n\nHere's video from May 19, 2015, of Rupert's last appearance on the Late Show... one day before the final episode. Thanks to the LETTERMAN channel for this.\n\nTV's Rupert Jee with TV's Bob Borden DAVE'S MEAN BOSS (CHARLETON HESTON)\n\nOct. 5, 2023: Seriously... who better to lay the Ten Commandments on Dave than Moses... a.k.a. Ben Hur... a.k.a. the president of the National Rifle Association? Charlton's admonitions aired on 9/06/95, and are a production of the Letterman Channel. (YouTube link) DAVE ON STRIKE FORCE FIVE\n\nOct. 2, 2023: I'd never heard of strikeforcefive. It's a podcast comprised of talk show hosts. There's Dave, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, Stephen Colbert and John Oliver. A topic on this podcast is Dorothy Mengering. (Oct. 2 - partial clip) (Top 10 List by Celebrity Mothers) (Top Ten Pieces of Advice I Gave My Celebrity Child, presented onstage by mothers: Lance Armstrong - Linda, Stefan Marbury - Mabel, Liv Tyler - Bebe Buell, Avril Lavigne - Judy, Jimmy Fallon - Gloria, Carson Daly - Patty, Tyra Banks - Carolyn, Julia Roberts - Gerard Mulligan as Betty Lou, Beyonce Knowles - Tina, David Letterman - Dorothy) THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: JOANNA JORDAN\n\nSep. 29, 2023: Mike Chisholm's guest is the leader of Central Talent Booking, Joanna Jordan. Robert Morton hired her in November 1995. Her title, at least at first, was Talent Executive. At some point, her title was Talent Consultant. Regardless of those details, the important piece is that Joanna brought all manner of inside details and stories. Something fascinating is her specific stories about competing shows (Letterman vs. Leno) trying to snag ratings gems from the other show. Leno's show tried hard to get Jack Hanna to come over to the dark side, but failed. Another who was gold on Letterman was Julia Roberts. Then there was booking Norm Macdonald on the day he was fired by SNL. Joanna said, \"We could never get enough of Norm.\"\n\nJoanna talked about being able to foretell the future, and booking an Emmy or Oscar winner in advance, someone from the Super Bowl championship team, a Grammy winner, etc. Human interest stories were big. Oh... guess who had to inform a booked guest that they needed to be rescheduled, in favor of someone who was the hot topic of the day.\n\nThis episode runs 1.5 hours. Thanks much to Joanna and Mike for collaborating on an exceptional podcast! (YouTube link) (centraltalentbooking.com)\n\nISAAC ASIMOV PREDICTS THE FUTURE\n\nSep. 26, 2023: I have to admit, while I saw almost every episode of the 33 years of Letterman on late night, I never saw an episode from the morning show. I know I would have enjoyed Isaac Asimov's Vision of the Future, which aired on 10/21/80. When in college, majoring in science education, I read several of Asimov's books. Here's a 13-minute video of Dr. Asimov. STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: ANTON FIG\n\nSep. 26, 2023: This - from the Letterman Channel - is awesome. One of our heroes, TV's Anton Fig, has 16 minutes of clips and stories from his days on LNDL and LSDL. My logs show that we first saw Anton when he sat in on 3/16/86. His first official night as the drummer on LNDL was 5/05/86. On 4/30/87, Anton presented the Top Ten Least-Used Hyphenated Words. On 6/20/89, Anton and Ringo Starr had a cold open. On 8/15/90, we were treated to the premiere of \"Anton Fig's Expiration Date Guess.\" (Milk) Now, an epic performance was on LNDL on 1/08/88, when Anton bit the head off a canary. I have that one in my Video Archives. Anton really enjoyed playing with Miles Davis, James Brown, Pete Townshend, Warren Zevon, the Foo Fighters, and Bruce Springsteen on the final LSDL. Be sure to watch Anton's entire \"Staff Favorite Moments.\" (YouTube link) THE LETTERMAN CHANNEL: THE WRITERS' STRIKE\n\nSep. 25, 2023: Happy autumn, everyone. I very much enjoyed the Peace Through Dramatization Players, but I must admit that I forgot that the beloved recurring segment traced back to LNDL (8/09/88). This action-packed episode, \"Dave Explains the Writers' Strike,\" features Marie O'Donnell as Mom, and Jeff \"Flunky\" Martin as Dad. Finally, TV's Calvert \"Larry Bud\" DeForest-Melman delivers an unforgettable performance as the Phantom of the Grand Ole Opry or whatever. (YouTube link) THE LETTERMAN CHANNEL: WGA STRIKE FUN FACTS\n\nSep. 22, 2023: Hi. I'm sorry I'm behind on these links. I'm determined to catch up. / From LSDL 1/04/08 [2844]: Dave announces that he's probably getting shaved in Monday's episode. He cautions Barbara Gaines that he doesn't want a similar outcome as last time (July 5, 1988, I believe), when he looked like he'd been in a knife fight. It seems he wants a trim before the close work starts. \"It's the same thing they do with sheep,\" Dave says. / Guess what? The al-Qaida writers are on strike, too. / OK... here we have Dave's Fun Facts: WGA Strike Edition (YouTube link) (Dave's comments video) DAVE'S GENEROSITY DURING THE 2007 WRITERS' STRIKE\n\nSep. 19, 2023: This is kind of a big deal. For example, the Emmys have been delayed from September to January. In 2007, Worldwide Pants Incorporated announced that non-writer staff would continue to be paid. I know that Dave was always good to his staff. Check out the Rolling Stone link for details. Also, here's video from LSDL 11-01-07 [2840]. THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: THE DONZ!!\n\nSep. 15, 2023: My pal, the legendary Don Giller, began the podcast by informing host Mike Chisholm, \"I'm going to ignore all your questions!\" He did bring Show and Tell: It's a Rubik's Cube. It has various Dave pictures and Late Night with David Letterman references, logos, etc., which in March of 1982, TV Boy demolished on-air with a hammer. Next, Don produced a watch commemorating the 1,000th Late Night with David Letterman. Don has a trophy from the 10th annual Jay Thomas Holiday Quarterback Challenge. He has a Late Night letter jacket. In fact, he shows several, including the Thank You and Good Night jacket from 2015. (YouTube link)\n\nDon and Mike got into a lengthy discussion of how The Donz acquired tape of obscure happenings. Donz interacted often with Shecky (Rick Scheckman). (Here's a video tribute to him.) We sadly lost Shecky on March 10, 2023. Then Don told lots of stories about what he went through to acquire video of 4,000+ CBS episodes. Shecky was a helpful source of some, as he was the Film Coordinator for LSDL.\n\nDonz 28 minutes in: \"I don't know if you want to get into this, but what do I care?\" he he! Don brought up interesting facts from LNDL in the 80s, and variations in the shows' usual patterns along the way. For example, some specials ran 90 minutes. (Donz worried aloud during this stretch that there would be lots of yawns. Nope. I was wide awake, eating PlantersÂ® peanuts.) Then he talked about getting dubs of episodes from Shecky, early on.\n\nThen there was the 1/16/91 LNDL episode, which never aired, as the Gulf War had just begun. My episode logs from that week state that the 1/17/91 episode was never taped. Wendy Wasserstein, Danny Aielo, and Linda Evangelista were the scheduled guests. The 1/18/91 show began, but after three minutes, NBC cut to Tom Brokaw, with Gulf War updates. It was later aired on 1/25/91. Another interesting topic was outtakes from episodes.\n\nDon revealed that he's compiling a complete set of Rupert's appearances on LNDL. That comes to 446 episodes! Don's up to about 100 so far. What a project! My episode log for 9/20/93 [16] says: \"more visits to neighbors around Broadway / A heretofore unknown deli owner named Rupert Jee comes in and gets a standing ovation.\"\n\nSTAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: JEFF STILSON\n\nSep. 12, 2023: Jeff Stilson was a writer for LSDL from 1993 to 1995. Before that he did stand-up on LNDL, on 5/09/89, 8/02/90, 10/16/91, 12/22/92 and 5/11/93. On LSDL, Jeff appeared in \"Staff Nightmares\" (2/22/94), and did stand-up on 4/27/01 and 1/22/10. On 6/09/94, Jeff was \"Phil, the CBS Page Who Just Doesn't Get It.\" Jeff talked about Dave and Richard Simmons doing a remote. Something I appreciated was Jeff declaring that Hal Gurnee \"was the greatest late night television director of all time.\" (He's right!) (YouTube link) THE LETTERMAN CHANNEL: PAUL &AMP; DAVE ON SUMMER\n\nAug. 31, 2023: It's our pals, Dave and Paul, talking about summer activities. Paul has pool parties with Demi Lovato and others, he says. Next weekend, he's doing a fundraiser with Jeff Barry. Wikipedia says of Jeff (who's now 85):\n\n\"Among the most successful songs that he has co-written in his career are Do Wah Diddy Diddy, Da Doo Ron Ron, Then He Kissed Me, Be My Baby, Chapel of Love, and River Deep - Mountain High (all written with his then-wife Ellie Greenwich and Phil Spector), Leader of the Pack (written with Greenwich and Shadow Morton), Sugar, Sugar (written with Andy Kim), and Without Us (written with Tom Scott).\n\nAnd, as we've known for some time, Victoria Lily Shaffer is involved in pet rescue. Visit Victoria Shaffer's Pup Culture.\n\nFinally, TV Boy claims that he's going to sing a couple of songs in an upcoming Taylor Swift concert. I'm not buying it! As we know, sometimes Dave likes to make up stories.\n\nHere's your YouTube link.\n\nTHE LETTERMAN CHANNEL: ANDY KAUFMAN\n\nAugust 27, 2023: Here's a visit from Andy on Dave's morning show, 10/15/80. His grooming and personal hygiene are substandard, and he has a nagging cough. He's definitely off in la la land, but has enough presence of mind to enter the audience in hopes of a little cash. Thankfully, Andy would survive long enough to receive a prearranged sucker punch from Jerry Lawler on Late Night, on 7/28/82. Back to 1980... a page or production assistant escorts Andy out of the room, and thus ended his guest segment. (YouTube video) STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: THE SKIT THAT BOMBED\n\nAugust 18, 2023: LNDL writers James Downey and Andy Breckman give us the back story on the segment they've entitled \"The Skit That Bombed.\" (This Favorite Moments was posted on 6/28/22, by the way.) (YouTube link) The segment involved Dave holding for the camera a series of poster board cards with black and white photos. Dave would recite the hopefully-funny story the writers made up for each photo. It's a fun look back at Dave, 40 years ago, on 8/17/83. By the way, a very nice part of this episode was a look at make-up goddess Candy Carell, beginning at 09:09. THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: JOSH ROBERT THOMPSON\n\nAug. 16, 2023: I was extremely busy with work on May 30, and totally missed the posting of this episode. I'm now plugging it here. Josh was involved with Craig Ferguson's version of The Late Late Show, and a definite claim to fame is playing Craig's robot skeleton sidekick, Geoff Peterson. (Wikipedia) (YouTube link) This extravaganza runs 2.5 hours! THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: THE PAUL SHAFFER BOBBLEHEAD\n\nAug. 15, 2023: The great Will Lee has commissioned a bobblehead to honor TV's Paul Shaffer. He found a company that does them, and sent pictures of Paul to use in the process. In a special five-minute podcast, we'll see the unboxing. Don't miss the latest episode from Underpants Productions. (YouTube video) MUJIBUR & SIRAJUL's COAST TO COAST TOUR\n\nAug. 3, 2023: The proprietors of K&L's Rockamerica souvenir store, Mujibur Rahman and Sirajul Islam, were dispatched by Dave to tour America, from Niagara Falls to the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe westward tour began on June 10, 1994, and they were welcomed home at the Ed Sullivan Theater on July 18. Their stops along the way didn't all make sense geographically. In order of air dates, they checked in from Niagara Falls, St. Louis, Mt. Rushmore, Houston, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Montana, New Orleans, Washington D.C., the Grand Canyon, San Francisco / Golden Gate and had their grand return on July 18. Here are a few highlights from the LETTERMAN channel... posted today. (YouTube link)\n\nLETTERMAN FANS MOURN THE PASSING OF PEE WEE HERMAN\n\nJuly 30, 2023: I'm sad to report the loss of Paul Reubens, a fun Letterman guest, and a unique comic actor. (New York Post) Here's a link to Don Giller's Pee Wee Herman Complete Collection on Letterman.\n\nFrom the LETTERMAN channel, here are:\n\nPee Wee Herman Gets Extremely Close to Dave (5-17-83)\n\nPee Wee Herman Takes Dave for a Drive in the Country (7/05/83)\n\nPee Wee Herman and Dave's Haunted Mansion (10-31-83)\n\nPee Wee Herman's Big Adventure' Gets Big Reviews (7-30-85)\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST: TIGE RODGERS\n\nJuly 28, 2023: There's a school of thought that, \"The interns have all the great stories.\" Mike Chisholm had an hour and 11 minutes with Tige Rodgers, who began as an intern. Tige reported that at first he was disappointed when he was assigned to the mail room at first. Well, it turns out that the mail room interns get to run all over the theater delivering mail, and therefore he interacted with pretty much everyone on staff. I haven't finished watching the podcast yet, but I can report that Tige is a great story teller, and he has a bunch of fun stories to tell. Tige told Mike that he was a \"fan boy,\" but the mail room intern had to pretend that he wasn't a fan boy. Don't miss this! DAVE SURPRISES SHOPPERS IN IOWA BY BAGGING GROCERIES\n\nJuly 21, 2023: Our favorite co-owner of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing was in Des Moines for the Hy-Vee Indy Car race, so he stopped by a Hy-Vee store, and bagged groceries. TV Boy knows a thing or two about racing and supermarkets. He grew up in Broad Ripple, 12 miles from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. In the 1960s, he bagged groceries at the Atlas Supermarket. Here's the story. And... here's YouTube video! THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: MATT ROBERTS\n\nJuly 21, 2023: Wake the kids... phone the neighbors. Head writer Matt Roberts is in the house! Mike Chisholm is delighted to welcome him, along with TV's Don Giller, for 2 hrs. and 52 min.\n\nMatt began as an intern in the summer of '92. After college, he felt he should apply for a position at the big show, so he moved to NYC with about $2,000. He applied to work in the mail room, at about the time when the big show was headed to CBS. (episode 1: 8/30/93... but you knew that) Matt had just turned down a low-paying retail job when the phone rang, and LSDL offered him a ticket office job.\n\nAfter the ticket office, Matt held positions as talent researcher, segment producer, producer, writer, supervising producer, executive producer and head writer! OK... this episode was just posted this morning, and I haven't seen all of it, so I'll add to this introduction after seeing all of it. Here's the YouTube link!\n\nWILL LEE ANNOUNCES A NEW WEB SITE!\n\nJuly 14, 2023: Our bassist hero, Will Lee, announced today that he's rolled out a newly-updated web site, www.willlee.com. He said,\n\n\"I'm super psyched & proud of my new webpage. It's the product of many talented (and patient) people, and it's chock full of new features: Gorgeous graphics, music, videos, updated discography, info and more! You can even sign up for the newsletter there!\"\n\nHis e-mail announcement mentioned a recording session with Paul Shaffer and others in early August, and gigs in NYC, Japan and Germany. Unfortunately, the links are about two feet long, but watch for them on his site. Finally, don't forget The Fab Faux, Will's Beatles tribute band, who will be back together in November.\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST: MATT LARKIN\n\nJune 30, 2023: Matt Larkin was a Letterman fan in his teenage years. He journeyed to NYC, hoping to sign on as an intern. He worked in audience coordination, which means he was a page. He got to meet numerous celebrities along the way. So... here's your link to ~1.75 hours of YouTube fun. Remember to march yourself over to hello-deli.com to grab a bunch of Letterman shirts, etc. THE LATE SHIFT\n\nJune 28, 2023: Bill Carter, author of the 1995 book The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno, and the Network Battle for the Night, posted today that he had noticed a vendor of his excellent book was about to lower the price. I don't know if he meant Amazon, or what, but here's a link to some good prices for it. SHOUT OUT TO THE GREAT DON GILLER: 200,000,000 VIEWS!\n\nJune 26, 2023: Within recent hours, Letterman Superfan Don \"The Donz\" Giller passed a milestone, now with 200 million views of his Letterman video channel on YouTube!\n\nDon has all of the 6,028 shows recorded from Letterman's runs on NBC and CBS, and saved as digital videos. Having digital copies has made it practical for him to produce compilation videos. These include appearances by specific guests, popular segments such as Viewer Mail, Alan Kalter highlights, Tony Mendez highlights: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7), Dave Talks to Kids, Biff Henderson's interruptions, Hit by Cabs collection, Hal Gurnee's Network Time Killers, a Rick Sheckman memorial collection, a Julia Child collection, and New Catch Phrases. AND... Don has a huge database with all the details of every single Letterman show! Thanks so much, Don.\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST, WITH CANDACE CHISHOLM\n\nJune 23, 2023: Mike Chisholm is recently back from Rick Scheckman's memorial, Sheckfest, in NYC. While there, he visited with a number of our heroes, including Paul and Will, Steve Young. He went out for steak with none ofher than Rupert Jee. Guess what! Mike got to go to Don Giller's place! (Yes, I've had that amazing privilege.) This is surprising... Mike saw the Ed Sullivan Theater for the first time on this trip. This has been an Underpants production. (YouTube link) STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: CHRIS SCHUKEI\n\nJune 20, 2023: Chris Schukei was the music coordinator for a number of years, and he has an awesome collection of stories. Most of them involved Paul and the CBSO. This is a must-see 16 minutes of stories on the LETTERMAN Channel. I'll be delighted if he comes back to give us more! (YouTube video) THE DONZ ON ALEX BENNETT'S RAMBLE PODCAST\n\nJune 23, 2023: My friend, Don \"The Donz\" Giller, was a guest on Alex Bennett's podcast this week. (YouTube link) Alex begins with basic questions about Don's complete videotape collection of Letterman shows (which, over the years, have been digitized).\n\nSomething I definitely found interesting was a discussion on the rights to distribute Letterman shows. CBS took down all the Letterman content from cbs.com after the show ended on May 20, 2015. Of course, Worldwide Pants actually owns the rights to the shows from the Late Show years.\n\nAlex asked Don if he preferred the LNDL or LSDL years. Don gave the nod to the NBC years, when the show was more \"high school with money,\" as Dave called his shows.\n\nI was excited, thinking Don's guest appearance would last all 1 hr. 25 min. of the episode, but his segment was 27 minutes. There seems to be an agreement to continue their visit later on, and I'm sure it will be interesting!\n\nLENO ON LETTERMAN\n\nJune 19, 2023: This is really interesting. (YouTube link) Jay Leno is with Neal Brennan, on The Blocks Podcast, discussing Johnny's and Dave's quest for the Tonight Show. Jay was very complimentary about Dave's work. I felt he was being very frank about their relationship. He said Dave makes him laugh as much as anyone. He said his success was \"hinged\" to Dave. He really enjoyed making Dave laugh. He said \"If Letterman ever wanted anything, I'd be there.\" Ha! I didn't know until today that Dave appeared on Neal's podcast on Dec. 8, 2022! THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: JAMES HENDERSON III\n\nJune 16, 2023: James J. \"Biff\" Henderson was with Dave's late night shows for 33 years, in addition to the morning show. Mike Chisholm's latest podcast guest is his son, James III. (Who knew that Biff is a Vietnam vet?) It's a very enjoyable hour. Be sure to drop by soon. I hope Mike is also able to interview Biff one of these days! (YouTube link) STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: HAROLD LARKIN\n\nJune 13, 2023: This just in from the LETTERMAN channel: Harold Larkin was the head carpenter for LSDL from 1995 to the final show in 2015. He contributed by setting up the theater and equipment for stunts, as well as having the starring role in segments.\n\nHe tells us about the dive from the top of the Ed Sullivan Theater into a pool on Broadway. Harold and Co. set up an impossibly difficult motorcycle obstacle course on Broadway, with ramps, busses, a tiger cage, etc. They never even pretended to do it. Harold and Co. helped celebrities fly around the stage, including Richard Simmons (as Cupid), and Bill Murray. They reinforced the marquee so Paul McCartney and his band wouldn't collapse it. (That appearance attracted a multitude of people.) A recurring gag was for Harold to have a mishap that resulted in him bleeding out from his jugular veins (although the gushing blood was more like a fire hose). Then there was the gag when Harold sat buck nekked on every audience seat. (Thanks to Jerry Foley and Co. for the large blue dot over Harold's junk.)\n\nHarold really enjoyed the annual Christmas time visit from Jay Thomas, with his Lone Ranger story, and Darlene Love, with \"Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home).\" It was a highlight to be able to meet Darlene. (For me, it was my favorite show of the year, for sure.) (YouTube link)\n\nUNABOMBER STUFF\n\nJune 12, 2023: The Letterman Channel has a compilation of Top Tens from the LSDL years about The Unabomber. I just read that he kicked the bucket in prison, two days ago. Anyway, watch this Top Ten compilation, or else! DAVE HANGS OUT WITH JOHN MELLENCAMP\n\nJune 9, 2023: Dave begins by claiming that \"Trumpy\" is in a federal pententiary in Kansas, which, of course, would be Leavenworth. (It's two counties south of Denton, where I grew up.) I don't think I need to explain that Dave's just making stuff up. Donald may end up in Leavenworth, but I don't believe he's there now.\n\nDave very much enjoyed John Mellencamp's show, earlier this week. They're both from Indiana. Oh... then Mr. Wise Guy claims his parents saved their money when he was a boy, so that in the summer, Dave could go to Melon Camp. (YouTube link)\n\nLETTERMAN'S SWITCH TO CBS: SPIKE FERESTEN\n\nJune 9, 2023: Here's a clip from Cars & Comedy / Late Night Playset. Spike Feresten, a Letterman writer, recalls the uncertainty and happenings as the drama over who would replace Johnny Carson played out. Here's the link to the full video on YouTube from Late Night Playset. THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: JILL BAYOR\n\nJune 9, 2023: No... not the aspirin! Check the spelling. Jill signed on with LNDL in its early years, as an intern. She was 19. Having done one year of college, she realized that what she really wanted to do at that early stage of her adult life was to work with the Letterman show. She called frequently for six months. Her persistence paid off. She was selected as an unpaid assistant to Dave, and she was around him \"all the time.\" She wanted to be a TV writer. Guess what! She got to write intros for Bill Wendell. Jill has all kinds of stories about experiences and incidents related to her job. She occasionally took calls from Johnny Carson. Later, Jill moved to SNL.\n\nI send my sincere thanks and admiration to both Mike Chisholm and Jill Bayor for this fascinating and fun 1.75 hours. Jill is very upbeat, is a great story teller and she's had so many experiences with classic shows like LNDL and SNL. (YouTube link)\n\nJOHN MELLENCAMP WITH TV BOY (TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL)\n\nJune 8, 2023: TV's David Letterman showed up for this hour-long interview of John with a newly-shaved head. Apparently that's due to Harry recently finishing his school year. (YouTube link) Unfortunately, the people who produced this didn't provide microphones for the gents, so you'll hear their voices, as though from afar. (You get used to it after a while.) The course of the interview is fairly random. You get to see what John is like. About 60 minutes into the 63-minute interview, Dave asked John if there's anything he'd like to cover. John kind of mumbled something, and that was the end of it. STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: MATT ROBERTS\n\nJune 6, 2023: Matt Roberts went from intern to executive producer and head writer. Working for the Letterman shows was always his goal. He was attracted by nonsense like The Thrill Cam and The Dancing Waters. He reminds of Chris Elliott's antics. Then there was time 4/05/96 [569] when Marshall Sylver hypnotized him.\n\nMatt helped create The Weekend Late Show, with Bruce and Linda, with ran from October 2011 to 2013. (It was intentionally bad.)\n\nNathan Lane was a favorite guest. After a long wait, they booked Bill Clinton. Speaking of presidents... Matt recalls the final LSDL, when several U.S. presidents said, \"Our long national nightmare is over.\" (YouTube link)\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST: MIKE CHISHOLM ON BROADWAY\n\nJune 4, 2023: Mike is in New York today, strolling down Broadway on Facebook live. He has a long, unexpected visit with May Chin in Hello Deli, on all manner of topics. ROCKET MAN: THE EVERY-ORNERY DON RICKLES\n\nJune 2, 2023: Thanks to Henry Hanks for reminding us of this 10-minute compilation. The LETTERMAN channel put it together. (video) The last LSDL episode I was in the audience for was the last DaveCon, on May 11, 2015. Dave's guests included Don Rickles and Howard Stern. Boy howdy, was that ever fun! DAVE AND MARY, LIVE FROM TRUMP TOWER\n\nMay 31, 2023: Mary Barclay's the host of this action-packed episode from the Letterman channel, and Walter Kim's the videographer. It's action-packed, because there's Indy 500 footage. Mary and Dave were protected from falling off (or being blown off) the Trump Tower by chicken wire. (Donald Trump was a guest on 6/02/14 [4037], when I was in the audience for DaveCon 2014). Here's your YouTube link.\n\nWhen I'd visit NYC for DaveCon, which was near 53rd St., I always stayed at the Best Western President Hotel (later The Galivant), on 48th St. Once per visit, I'd walk up 5th Avenue to around 59th St., to the Apple Store, so I'd go by the Trump Tower, between 56th and 57th Streets. Trump Tower is 664 feet tall, which is more than two city blocks high! It reportedly cost $300,000,000. As TV's Paul Shaffer would say, \"I've got that on me!\"\n\nTINA TURNER MEMORIES\n\nMay 28, 2023: This gem from the Letterman channel is from LNDL on 5/31/84. To begin Tina's guest segment, Dave gives Tina a brand new Tuna TurnerÂ®. (YouTube link) And... here's a musical performance by Tina, \"I Don't Wanna Fight,\" from 4/30/93. (YouTube link) We lost Tina on May 24. She was 83. RIP to a legend. WILL LEE GOT A LETTER FROM SIR PAUL McCARTNEY\n\nMay 27, 2023: Will recently sang one of Paul's songs at Carnegie Hall. And, of course, Will is with The Fab Faux, a Beatles tribute band. So... Paul sent Will fan mail. Here's the story on Facebook. THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: BARBARA GAINES' URPFEST\n\nMay 24, 2023: Why is TV's David Letterman wearing a stocking cap on the 24th of May? Anyway, Barbara Gaines journeyed to Amsterdam last week. She visited an impressive restaurant there. Something didn't set well with her, and she urped. (She said she has the axid reflux.) Dave immediately diagnosed Barbara's disorder as gastroparesis. (It's when your tummy doesn't contract normally, your grub doesn't move through your digestive tract, and you regurgitate.) Maybe's he's onto something. Regardless, Gaines tossed her cookies very neatly and discretely.\n\nA while later, she was out and about, and she felt the urge to urp again. Barbara really let 'er rip this time. Her wife, Aari Ludvigsen, photographed the evidence, and we get to see pictures. The glop was green! (YouTube link)\n\nAT LAST! WALTER KIM GIVES US HIS FAVORITE MOMENTS\n\nMay 23, 2023: Walter Kim worked for Letterman shows from 1993 to 2015. I'm especially happy to see this, because Walter and Jay Johnson produced the Tony Mendez Show episodes, when I was in NYC for the annual DaveCon. (YouTube link) THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: ROB STOVER\n\nMay 23, 2023: Mike Chisholm's guest is fellow Canadian Rob Stover, an LSDL fan who was in The Ed on 5/20/15, for the last taping. Ha! Rob's wearing a Dick Assmania t-shirt! This podcast runs an hour and 26 minutes! Rob has a bunch of interesting bits and pieces to tell about being in the audience for the final show. I highly recommend this! (YouTube link) PAUL SHAFFER INITIALLY TURNED DOWN DAVE\n\nMay 22, 2023: Can you imagine Letterman in late night without Paul Shaffer? I can't. Here's a real interesting piece of history, with info that I don't remember reading elsewhere, including the fact that Paul originally turned down the offer. Ultimately, Paul clearly found happiness with Dave for 33 years, and he banked millions of $$$. Paul says he very much appreciated being allowed to do whatever he wanted on the show. (msn.com story) THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: ROBERT MORTON\n\nMay 19, 2023: Mike Chisholm's been pestering Robert \"Morty\" Morton to be on the podcast, and here he is! Morty was a producer for Dave's shows for quite a while, and fairly often, he ended up on camera. The first time on camera I have for him in my episode logs is 8/12/87, for a segment entitled list of differences between Barry Sand and Robert Morton. Morty has all kinds of stories about Dave and Tom Snyder. He has stories about John Gotti, too! (Wikipedia link) (YouTube link)\n\nBy the way... this video treasure ended abruptly. That's because there's a part two, coming soon, so stay tuned for more awesome stories from Morty. (YouTube link)\n\nOK... here we go! On May 26, we got Part 2. It's an hour and 21 minutes! There are all kinds of topics. Morty revealed that he got fired from LSDL. Something I really enjoyed is when Mike started naming well-known staff, and Morty commented. Merrill Markoe: genius, the heart and soul of the operation, the creator of the show and its sensibility / Steve O'Donnell: another genius, a great writer, carried the torch, a lovely guy, creator of the Top Ten / Pete Fatovich: the funniest guy you'll ever meet, a joy to be with / Chris Elliott: a natural, started as an intern, always delivered, his pieces on the show were my favorites / Madeline Smithberg: a force of nature, found the most obscure things and milking the comedy from them / Rick Scheckman: an enigma, everybody's pal, a photographic mind / Barbara Gaines: heart and soul of the operation, a good woman / Don Giller: (not safe for work)\n\nMike concluded by asking Morty for his suggestions on guests for My Next Guest Needs No Introduction. 1. Steve Martin 2. Dr. Fauci 3. a great director â¢ â¢ â¢ After signing off with Morty, Mike reported that he, Morty and Don Giller visited privately for another 1.5 hours!\n\nSTAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: JILL GOODWIN\n\nMay 16, 2023: Jill Goodwin had a few roles with LSDL: intern, receptionist, assistant to Jude Brennan & Barbara Gaines, a writers' assistant, and finally, a writer for the final five years of the show. She reminded us that for a time, Johnny Carson faxed monologue jokes to Dave. I especially enjoyed this bit of \"found comedy,\" when the Lt. Governor of Iowa, while giving a press conference about swine flu, coughed incessantly! And... she thought up some wacky entrances for Bill Murray's visits. Watch closely, won't you? (YouTube link) THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: JONATHAN GREEN\n\nMay 12, 2023: Jonathan Green wrote for LSDL from 2001 - 2004. After that, he wrote for the final season of The Office. This extravaganza runs 1.75 hours, so pack a lunch! This is a very upbeat, interesting visit. Jonathan was involved with Dr. Phil's Words of Wisdom, so he got the \"privilege\" of watching Dr. Phil every day, to harvest those gems. (YouTube link) Mike Chisholm's much-appreciated podcast is sponsored by hello-deli.com. DAVE REMEMBERS BRUCE McCALL\n\nMay 10, 2023: This is related to the May 7 entry below. Bruce McCall passed away on May 5. Dave, who co-wrote This Land Was Built for You and Me (But Mostly Me): Billionaires in the Wild with Bruce, has several minutes' worth of memories about him. I found it interesting that Dave, who I've long known has an excellent vocabulary, referred to Bruce as taciturn. (adjective: reserved or uncommunicative in speech; saying little) As I watched videos of Bruce's appearances with Dave the other day, I noticed that while he was known for cranking out funny, satirical books, he never once cracked a smile during his interviews. I wonder how Bruce would respond, if questioned about his stern demeanor, but I don't think he'd deny it. (YouTube link) FAVORITE MOMENTS: CARTER BAYS AND CRAIG THOMAS\n\nMay 9, 2023: Don't miss this!! Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wrote for LSDL in the late 1990s / early 2000s. Craig was a major player in the genius idea of Pat and Kenny Read Oprah Transcripts. I hadn't thought about the fact that Pat always played Oprah, and Kenny played her guest, as they read the transcripts. Carter and Craig were involved in the segments with General Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon. (Buzz was promoted to Brigadier General a few days ago.) Just before Carter and Craig left the show, they cooked up the idea of Will It Float?. They recognized how much the late, great Alan Kalter could bring to the show. They were in charge of CBS Mailbag for a few years. (YouTube link) BRUCE McCALL'S ZANY AFTERNOONS\n\nMay 7, 2023: This look at the past from the LETTERMAN channel is from 12/22/82... the first season of LNDL. Bruce McCall brought a bunch of off-the-wall paintings, which are included in his book Zany Afternoons (only $118.13, from Amazon). Some of Bruce's art is dark-themed, some ironic and some is plain weird. I don't remember this interview. Bruce is a total straight man, even though his work is wacky and funny. He didn't crack a smile once during the interview. Hey! We got a Berkshire Place commercial from Bill Wendell! Here's your YouTube link.\n\nMy logs don't show Bruce being seen again for 19 years... until 10/15/01 [1691], when he came on to plug a fairly similar book, The Last Dream-O-Rama, about cars that were never built. He came back on 3/16/04 [2139], to plug All Meat Looks Like South America. On 11/21/08 [3023], he re-emerged to plug Marveltown. After a near-five-year hiatus, Bruce came by for 11/04/13 [3932], to help plug the new picture book he wrote with Dave, This Land Was Built for You and Me (But Mostly Me): Billionaires in the Wild.\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST: CARTER BAYS\n\nMay 5, 2023: I just learned about this, and haven't seen all of it. Still, I wanted to get the word out. And, as you'll see above, Carter has just done a Staff Favorite Moments podcast for the LETTERMAN channel. See May 9 above! (YouTube link) DAVE REACTS TO WARREN ZEVON'S\n\nROCK & ROLL HALL OF FAME SNUB\n\nMay, 3, 2023: The latest on the LETTERMAN Channel has TV's David Letterman visiting with Barbara Gaines and Mary Barclay. We know Dave has campaigned for his late friend, Warren Zevon, to be added to the Hall of Fame. For some reason, Dave can't shut up about Brian Teta (a really swell guy) being the new producer of this channel. (YouTube link) The LETTERMAN Channel isn't sponsored by hello-deli.com, but go there, anyway. I command you! (You'll be glad you did.) STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: PAT FARMER\n\nMay 2, 2023: It was always great to have Pat Farmer, the show's prop master, on an episode. He was in on the \"dumping stuff off the roof of the Ed\" stunts. My episode logs show 38 installments of \"Pat and Kenny Read Oprah Transcripts,\" which were always fun. Here's Pat's video. (YouTube link) THE FIRST HALL GURNEE'S NETWORK TIME KILLERS\n\nMay 2, 2023: Thanks to the LETTERMAN channel for this, from 6/28/88, so obviously on LNDL. This was the first new episode after 16 weeks of reruns, because of the legendary writers' strike. We got to see Hal's new shirt, and Pete Fatovich played his accordion. I got in my episode logs, and found 40 episodes of Time Killers. They were awesome! I then checked my LSDL episode logs, and only found two Time Killers... in early 2008. By the way, the first one in 2008 was in the first episode in two months, because of another writers' strike! (YouTube link) THE BEST AND FUNNIEST OF WARREN ZEVON\n\nApr. 26, 2023: Here's a nice story, posted by vulture.com, by Devon Ivie. A whole lot of this offering is in David Letterman's own words. We already knew that Dave was a huge fan of Warren. A quick check of my LNDL and LSDL episode logs shows Warren appearing on 78 episodes. I definitely recommend having a look at this story. LETTERMAN/SNYDER PRESS CONFERENCE:\n\nTHE LATE LATE SHOW\n\nApr. 27, 2023: Tonight is the end the CBS's Late Late Show programs. To tie the ribbons on that, The Donz has miracled this video onto YouTube: a press conference with Tom Snyder, whose new show will follow TV Boy on weekday evenings. This event ran 46 minutes, on August 9, 1994. Watch closely, won't you? STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: JAY JOHNSON\n\nApr. 25, 2023: I loved this latest video from the LETTERMAN channel! I got to hang around with Jay a few times at the annual DaveCons, as he and Walter Kim would plan and record us for an edition of The Tony Mendez Show.\n\nJay began in the LNDL days... first as an intern. He was a talent researcher, and we knew him best (along with Walter Kim) as a Creative Director, Digital Media. So... Jay worked with lots of memorable remote segments. Jay mentioned a classic, which had civilians pick a new catch phrase for Dave. Remember \"They pelted us with rocks and garbage?\" (1984) How about, \"I'm a sweet little cupcake, baked by the devil.\" (5/11/89) Hey! Visit my Letterman Catch Phrases web page! In 1985, Today did a live broadcast outside, at Rockefeller Plaza, which Dave interrupted with a bullhorn. Jay got to be on the show dozens of times. One was a \"How Many Guys in Bunny Suits?\" episode. The Late Show's presence on cbs.com (with extra material) was one of the first of its kind. (That's where I appeared in the Tony Mendez Show.)\n\nJay was involved with Live on Letterman. It was a concert series, and its episodes appeared on cbs.com in mid-evening. Taylor Swift was one of the musicians who was seen in an evening mini concert, before her Late Show episode appearance, later that evening.\n\nThen there was the historic concert, 7/15/09 [3150], with Paul McCartney performing on the marquee of the Ed Sullivan Theater. Since the Beatles had their United States debut on the stage of the Ed Sullivan Theater, this had special meaning. Paul, earlier in the day, was seen looking at hallway photos of The Beatles. Anyway, Paul attracted a huge crowd on Broadway for his marquee concert. (YouTube link)\n\nTHE 1st ANNIVERSARY LETTERMAN PODCAST: PAUL SHAFFER\n\nApr. 21, 2023: Mike Chisholm's big secret is out. His first anniversary Letterman Podcast guest is Paul Allen Wood Shaffer... a.k.a. C. Paul Tilson-Shaffer... a.k.a. Babbitt, Order of Canada honoree, and (as you well know), the 33-year Letterman sidekick and musical director. (YouTube link) (Wikipedia) You'll get to enjoy an hour and 34 minutes of Paul, visiting with Mike about many, many aspects of his days with the show. Mike and Paul talked about his wardrobe and glasses, Andy Kauffman, Elton John, his WMDB and CBSO sidekicks, artists who sat in with the band, and Barry Manilow. They talked about being a live show on tape. Recently, Paul and Co. (as the WMDB) were the house band on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show.\n\nPaul told about something that became a fascinating tradition (but not until the LSDL days): playing on guests with a song that was - in some way - connected to the guest, even though the connection was sometimes fairly obscure. Mike asked Paul about adding horns to the CBSO on LSDL. Paul was apprehensive about this, as rock and roll doesn't generally include any horns. Don Giller, a musician by training, had some specific questions about some songs heard on the show, auditions for the band, etc. Mike asked Paul for a favorite rock song played on the show. The answer: A Whiter Shade of Pale. That one's amazing, in my opinion! Mike asked Paul about the late, great Warren Zevon, who sat in for Paul for a few episodes in October 2000. Don't forget to visit hello-deli.com.\n\nSTAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: DONICK CARY\n\nApr. 18, 2023: Donick Cary first was an intern for LNDL in 1989, and ultimately was head writer for both shows, from 1991 to 1996. He has about 18 minutes' worth of fun memories. The first segments presented are \"Just Bulbs\" and \"Just Shades,\" (12/07/83). As an intern, Donick was working for $0, but he got cast in segments now and then. He was involved with the \"Viewer Mail\" that had Dave's hair completely covered with mashed potatoes. On 2/04/93, for \"Biff Henderson's House of Rock and Rap,\" Donick went upstairs to SNL and pitched an appearance by Mick Jagger. (Ha! Biff was holding the prop upside down.) Donick enjoyed found comedy, like \"Dave's Record Collection.\" He came up with \"Dave's Video Collection.\" Donick came up with \"Late Night Pea Boy.\" (3/18/93 and a few more times that spring) / Something Donick really enjoyed was involving Dave lookalikes. Then there was Dick Assman! He showed up a few times in summer 1995, resulting in Dick Assmania! Something that Donick really enjoyed was \"Moe, the Meat-Slicing Man.\" So... there's 18 minutes of good stuff. Don't miss it. BACK HOME AGAIN IN INDIANA\n\nApr. 18, 2023: Ball State has posted a detailed report on TV Boy returning to Muncie, to be part of a documentary, Clear Reception, on May 1. (link) The documentary is related to Dave's support of their arts programs, and certainly for their broadcast media programs. It was no accident that the university named a building for their major donor. It's clear that the university greatly appreciates Dave's support over the years. THE LETTERMAN PODCAST 059: MARK MALKOFF\n\nApr. 14, 2023: It's anniversary week for the Letterman Podcast, as it premiered on April 20, 2022. Here's a Facebook link I placed on this fan page on exactly 4/20/22.\n\nI've plugged a lot of Paul Leslie's podcasts that are related to Letterman, and guess what... Paul interviewed Mr. Mark Malkoff on his Episode #172, on 11/12/18. I suggest going over to paulleslie.com and choosing your source for Paul's interview with Mark. Next... here's Mark's Wikipedia page.\n\nAlright, let's get to the YouTube link for Mike Chisholm's 1.5-hour visit with Mark Malkoff! Also, don't forget to visit hello-deli.com, as Rupert Jee sponsors Mike's podcasts.\n\nMark has worked with The Carson Podcast, and he played a part in helping Mike get The Letterman Podcast into existence. Mark enjoys wacky stunts: He has 95 keys to cities, he raced across NYC on a tricycle, he spent a solid month on a jet, he visited 171 StarbucksÂ® in a day, and he watched 252 Netflix movies in a month. So there! Oh... he got kicked out of an Apple store, for bringing in a goat.\n\nFinally... I just found this link, in the lefthand navigation column of this very page. It's an epic-length trip report, written by Mike Chisholm, for the April 20, 2015 episode.\n\nDAVE'S WARDROBE MALFUNCTION\n\nApr. 12, 2023: First, happy birthday (#76) to TV's David Letterman. Second, are we going to find out what he's doing wearing those mirror sunglasses. OK... here we go. Last night, Dave and Regina went to a premiere - as far as I can tell - at the Museum of Modern Art. (I can't find a word about the premiere on the Internet.) (The MOMA is on 53rd St., roughly 2Â½ blocks from the Ed Sullivan Theater.) The place was filled with A-listers. There was a screening of a film about some people named Tomkins. Anyway, Dave tells about a scandalous wardrobe malfunction at the museum. Our hero accidentally tucked his jacket into his pants, after a trip to the men's room. So... the owner of Worldwide Pants Incorporated had a pants malfunction! (YouTube link) COLLEEN BOYLE ON HER CLASSIC LATE NIGHT SURPRISE\n\nApr. 11, 2023: The date was 8/07/86, and the occasion was that evening's Late Night with David Letterman. Colleen Boyle had sent Dave a letter about wearing his AdidasÂ® high-top basketball shoes on the show. It resulted in a legendary response. Here's my video of the Viewer Mail segment. Dave took a crew to Colleen's family home in Hicksville, Long Island, only to find her away at the time, but the crew staked out the place. Eventually her brother, Neil, showed up. He took Dave and crew up to Colleen's room, then directed them to the SearsÂ® store where she worked. The stunned Colleen responded with nervous giggles, and she was even more embarrassed when Dave told her about his visit to her room. Then they went to lunch. The family was in the audience for the Viewer Mail episode.\n\nNow, 36+ years later, Colleen is hosting a LETTERMAN channel episode, Colleen Boyle Looks Back at Her Classic \"Late Night\" Surprise.\n\nAs I rewatched this, I'm thinking that I should have written a Viewer Mail about Dave's gigantic 1980s glasses. I'd forgotten how many wore those extra-large plastic glasses in that era. Finally (and I had forgotten this), on the May 1, 2015 episode of LSDL, Colleen showed up unannounced in the audience, and managed to get in a pre-show question on Dave's shoes. A bit later, someone on staff realized that it was our old friend, Colleen, asking the question, and they showed her in the audience. So... how about that?!\n\nHELLO DELI BIDS FAREWELL, SAYS RUPERT JEE\n\nApr. 8, 2023: Our good friend Rupert Jee was a very significant part of the Letterman experience, because of his hospitality to visitors, and countless appearances in Late Show segments. Rupert is the last person I talked to in New York, on my final Letterman show trip from Manhattan, as I headed to LaGuardia for the flight home. Angela Barbuti, of the New York Post, has published a very nice profile and photo gallery. Here's the link. THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: GLYNN BORDERS\n\nApr. 7, 2023: Mike Chisholm's latest guest is Glynn Borders, who worked with special effects on Dave's shows for a long time. (YouTube link) Glynn made it snow when Darlene Love sang Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home). That's just one of countless adventures, spanning 30 years. Get a snack. This podcast runs over 1Â½ hours! THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: MONKEY BUSINESS\n\nApr. 5, 2023: This legendary segment aired on LNDL on 8/26/87. Rena Smaha brought the two little varmints. They were supposed to have a tea party onstage, but there was one mishap after another. I remember this so well! It's one of my Top 10 Letterman segments ever... eight minutes of monkeyshines. The female monkey (wearing a fancy tea party dress) tried to swat and scare Dave several times. He egged her on by acting afraid of her.\n\nOther good stuff in this episode included: What's Hal Wearing?, Top Ten Things Overheard in a G. E. Research Lab, the Thrill CamÂ® loops around and comes in from the back, a call to the Brazilian Coffee House about the Pan Am Game loss, Sean Young, Dave playing horse with a Brazilian waiter, and Jerry Seinfeld. (YouTube link)\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST IS NOMINATED FOR A WEBBY\n\nApr. 4, 2023: We got word today that one of our two favorite podcasts is nominated. Here's the webbyawards.com link. It took several minutes, but I finally found the link for voting. It's listed as Letterman YouTube Channel. Well, there doesn't seem to be a special URL for the podcast you want to vote for, but the catetory is Variety. The link in the previous sentence will take you to the general area. Next, you'll need to sign in and establish a password in order to vote. (Look for a black box near the top of the page, marked SIGN IN.) STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: LEE ELLENBERG\n\nApr. 4, 2023: Lee started at LSDL as a page in 1994. He worked in the ticket department for a couple of years, then became a writer in 2000. I highly recommend this offering from the LETTERMAN channel.\n\nLee's first memory is a classic... the Colleen Boyle incident on LNDL, on 8/07/86. I have the video, right here. Colleen wrote a viewer mail to Dave about shoes. He and a video crew visited her house, and her brother led them to her room. Then he revealed the location of the SearsÂ® store where she worked. Dave and crew went there to surprise her. Colleen was overcome with nervous giggles.\n\nLee liked the Chris Elliott segments, like when he taste-tested dog food.\n\nRemember when Buzz Aldrin covered the Daytime Emmys in his astronaut suit? 5/23/00 [1410] Visits from Buzz were always great!\n\nHow about this! Lee thought up the idea of bringing a psychic on the show. There were a few different ones, but Deborah Lynn became legendary... appearing on LSDL for about 12 years! (Deborah wanted to be called an intuitive.) My logs look like her first appearance was on 5/09/01 [1603], and in the next month for \"Psychic Sandwich.\" A quick check of the logs shows about 20 appearances, to 2013. Lee doesn't recall her ever getting a single thing right!\n\nFrom 5/24/05 [2372], Lee remembers this one: Thurl Ravenscroft, 91, the voice of Tony the Tiger, died earlier that day. / bogus video tribute: \"Thurl's services were held in Orange County, California today, then he was buried in a grrrrrrrave.\"\n\nA segment that Lee took over after its first airing was Alan Kalter's Celebrity Interview. It ran 2005 to 2009, with Gwyneth Paltrow the first celebrity Alan embarrassed, Clint Eastwood for one, and ending with Nicholas Cage. Joe Grossman wrote one with Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman that never aired. It really crossed the line. Dustin did not appear amused, in the least.\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST: BILL CARTER\n\nApr. 1, 2023: This is tremendous! Mike's guest, Bill Carter, wrote about television for the New York Times for a long time. And... he wrote two very significant books about competition in late night programming, as well as the well-known drama over the transition from Johnny Carson to a successor. You'll find links to Bill's two books, conveniently located at the bottom of this topic.\n\nThis podcast runs 1 hr. 44 min.! (YouTube link) Bill Carter has many sources of information and perspective on the individuals and situations involved with late night shows, and I felt he was being very forthcoming with details, while at the same time being fair to all involved, and not overdramatizing. Our host, Mike Chisholm, is doing exceptional work with these podcasts. His recall on all things Letterman - and research on every podcast topic - is outstanding.\n\nOh... Mike says he's going to start giving away Late Show rejection postcards. (shown below) They were sent to people who wanted to be on the show, etc. I've got 25 of these cards! (No... I never tried to be a guest on the show!) The flip side of the rejection postcard says,\n\nDear Sir/Madam:\n\nThank you for your interest in THE LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN.\n\nUnfortunately, we feel that an appearance is not quite right for us at this time.\n\nOnce again, we appreciate your taking the time to write and wish you every success in the future.\n\nThe Talent Department\n\nTHE LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN\n\nThanks much to Rupert Jee of Hello Deli, who is sponsoring Mike's podcasts. Rupert's not just serving yummy sandwiches. He has a nice variety of Letterman shirts and souvenirs. Visit hello-deli.com!\n\nThe Late Shift The War for Late Night\n\nUNCLE WILL LEE & ANTON FIG: 'THAT'S THE POWER OF LOVE'\n\nMar. 30, 2023: It's great to see Will and Anton still gettin' it done, in this catchy number, composed by Antoine Cara. Gabriel Richards was with them, on saxophone. It kind of seems like they collaborated on this from different locations, maybe using Zoom. The audio sounds fine, regardless. (YouTube link) STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: EDDIE VALK\n\nMar. 29, 2023: Eddie Valk had different roles on the show, from 2000 to 2015. He was an intern, cue card boy and a stage manager. He was insulted by Don Rickles. He was Spidey on Broadway. He bled to death in Hello Deli. He was a monkey caller. My episode logs show him on about 30 times. (YouTube link) Don't miss this! Thanks, Eddie. STOP CALLING ME CHIEF\n\nMar. 24, 2023: The LETTERMAN channel's latest takes us back to 1998. This action-packed series was variably entitled \"Stop Calling Me Chief\" and \"Please Stop Calling Me Chief.\" Six of seven were in Joe G.'s Pizza, with the series finale in Hello Deli on 4/26/01 [1632]. The master of ceremonies was TV's David Letterman, a former weatherman from Indiana. It's safe to say that the guests gave permission in advance, but I'm guessing that he or she didn't know Dave was going to include Chief in pretty much every question. (YouTube link) To my knowledge, this series is not sponsored by Hello Deli, but visit Rupert's site, anyway! THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: ALEX BENNETT\n\nMar. 24, 2023: Mike Chisholm reports that Alex Bennett (Bennett Gordon Schwarzmann) is a legend, having hosted radio programs for over 50 years, and was a close friend of the late Rick Scheckman. In addition, he's considered a mentor to radio successes such as Howard Stern. This blockbuster podcast lasts 02:14, so pack a lunch (hopefully acquired from Rupert and May at Hello Deli). (YouTube link) (Alex Bennett's Wikipedia page) EMMA WATSON TALKS ABOUT HARRY POTTER ENDING\n\nMar. 23, 2023: Hermione's in the house! This fun interview is from 7/11/07 [2780]. Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson was promoting Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. She was 17. We learn that she really enjoyed the books, so she was intent on playing Hermione. She was a very charming and lovely guest! In May 2014, she graduated from Brown University in Rhode Island, with a B.A. degree in English literature. (YouTube link) TRUMP OR MONKEY?\n\nMar. 20, 2023: From 2/24/04 [2129]: A young lady who's living in Itally, teaching English and translating books, is today's contestant in \"TRUMP - or - MONKEY?\" She sings opera in her spare time, and gives us a mini concert. Amy made the same guess as me, but it was clearly a chimp. (YouTube video) SAD NEWS: RUPERT AND MAY PLAN TO RETIRE\n\nMar. 18, 2023: Good friends of people by the thousands, Rupert Jee and May Chin, announced on Facebook today their plan to retire soon from Hello Deli.\n\nI can't imagine going to New York and not stopping by Hello Deli. Rupert was the last person I talked to in New York, on my final DaveCon trip there, in 2015. He was always so patient and kind to fans of him and Dave. My fan friends and I had huge appreciation for the hospitality we received there, from both of them. I know we all wish them the very best.\n\nFUNNIEST LETTERMAN JOKES AND MOMENTS\n\nFOR THE COMEDY HALL OF FAME\n\nMar. 18, 2023: Dan Fritschie, for cracked.com, has a well-done review of significant Letterman recurring bits and epic moments. I'll summarize for astute viewers with Stupid Pet Tricks, Stupid Human Tricks, Drive Throughs, Drew, Rupert and Hello Deli, Zippy, Dave's Mom and Top Tens. (Have a look.) LETTERMAN VISITS JIMMY KIMMEL IN LOS ANGELES\n\nMar. 15, 2023: This happened, and it was fun and entertaining. Dave came loaded with topics and material. If I find pirate (or officiral) video, I'll post a link! Re-entry: I'm sorry... no pirate video, but I did find this YouTube video, posted by Jimmy Kimmel Live. The two gents compared notes on hosting the Oscars, and we learned more about the upcoming Bono & The Edge: A Sort of Homecoming. Apparently Bono and The Edge have written a song for Dave called The Forty Foot Man. Oh, my goodness! After two days on YouTube, the video linked here has 1,118,142 views! STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: BOB BORDEN\n\nMar. 15, 2023: Writer Bob Borden recalls a bunch of appearances during the Late Show years. My episode logs show him appearing - or at least mentioned - 73 times between 10/08/1993 and 6/13/2008. He started as a mail room worker, and was credited as a writer before he finished at the show. He continued to be asked to appear, because he was willing to do all manner of goofy things... and even to put his person and his car in danger. This is a real fun \"Favorite Moments.\" Watch it now... or else! (YouTube link) LATE NIGHT MONKEY CAM T-SHIRTS\n\nMar. 13, 2023: On 3/19/86, we had the premiere of the Late Night Monkey CamÂ® (with Zippy the chimp). Zippy apparently didn't reappear for six months. (Zippy 1) (Zippy 2) One of Zippy's appearances involved Dr. Ruth Westheimer. The two links in this paragraph are to different videos. I accidentally used the same title screen, back in 2005.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, our prayers have been answered, because Jed Rosenzweig has produced a selection of Letterman t-shirts for our purchasing enjoyment, and the first offerings celebrate Zippy.

The Donz is along for the ride, too! (YouTube link)\n\nThis runs 1.75 hours, and a lot of it is unscripted... just random memories and storytelling. Then Don Giller, whose birthday is today, fills in gaps with details, pictures, etc. While you're listening, open another web browser tab, and visit Rupert Jee's hello-deli.com. Oh... by the way... I just went back and put in code that will open Rupert's site in a new window, when you do the click.\n\nRICK SCHECKMAN HAS PASSED AWAY\n\nMar. 10, 2023: I'm very sorry to report that Shecky died today. He lived from December 1, 1955 to March 10, 2023. Long-time Letterman fans remember him as Film Coordinator through the 33 years of Letterman on late night. Tributes to Shecky will be turning up, and I will be posting them here. Don Giller has just posted a tremendous reflection and eulogy. (link) It includes Shecky's communications with Don, as well as Don's memories of him.\n\nPosted as part of the donzblog is a eulogy by Don Giller. Everyone who knew of Shecky will appreciate this.\n\nThe LETTERMAN channel has posted a 14-minute look back at various appearances by Shecky. (YouTube link) This has some priceless stuff. Don't miss it.\n\nShecky was amused by goofy, old-time music, which would turn up in legendary videos such as Monkey Washing a Cat. Don used that music in a brief video, posted to YouTube this morning.\n\nMy episode logs have Shecky turning up in various spots:\n\nLNDL: 1/08/86: \"Peace through Dramatization Players\" on Elvis's 51st birthday: \"Elvis: A Birthday Memory\" / 6/25/86: Rick as Elvis / 7/07/86: as an Elvis impersonator / 7/07/86: the ghost of Elvis / 4/16/87: as Elvis, in \"Viewer Mail\" / 5/07/87: as Elvis, in \"Viewer Mail\" / 8/24/88: as Elvis, in \"Who Asked for It?\" / 10/05/88: as Elvis, in \"Dave's Grab Bag\" / 10/13/88: as Elvis, in \"New Gift Items\" / 10/21/88: doing the show from the international arrivals area of JFK International Airport (with Rick Scheckman as Elvis, working a food stand) / 11/03/88: Campaign '88 Do's and Don'ts (with Calvert DeForest as Larry \"Bud\" Melman, plus Rick Scheckman as Elvis)\n\nLSDL: 8/18/94 [218]: Rick Scheckman vs. Carlos the Jackal / 4/29/98 [998]: Dave calls roll (with bodyguard Bill DeLace, Shecky and the Man on Fire for Highland Metals, Inc.) / 9/23/98 [1083]: Rick's new show, Animal Precinct / 2/19/99 [1173]: \"Late Show Stagehands Sit in Dave's Chair Naked\" / Shecky as cue card boy / 5/18/99 [1220]: 1/05/00 [1354]: \"Dave Spends a Day with a POKEMON Fan\" / \"Dave Spends the Day with a Star Wars Fan\" / 2/01/02 [1748]: Dave recognizing Shecky for 20 years with the shows / 2/02/04 [2114]: winner of the audience Super Bowl pool / 2/10/05 [2316]: 3-D Glasses / 6/15/07 [2772]: \"Late Show Father of the Year\" / 6/08/09 [3128]: a Bruce Willis action movie / 12/07/11 [3590]: Shecky as a rabbi / 2/23/12 [3635]: \"Princess Cruises' Late Show Experience\" / 8/14/12 [3711]: non-Olympians in the audience / 5/16/13 [3853]: \"Behind the Wheel of Fortune\"\n\nOK... I thought it would be fitting to list Shecky's appearances on Dave's shows. The LNDL part went OK, as shown above. The LSDL part started OK, as shown above, when I searched my episode logs for \"Rick Scheckman.\" As an afterthought, I did a search on \"Shecky\" in the Late Show episode logs. Well... he turned up 142 times. I'd like to list them here, but this is going to call for a separate web page!\n\nMike Carlin of The Hollywood Reporter posted a highly complimentary eulogy on Shecky on March 10.\n\nDAVE AND PAUL'S TOUR OF LOS ANGELES\n\nMar. 9, 2023: The LETTERMAN channel has just posted a remote featuring our pals, Dave and Paul, motoring around Los Angeles on 5/09/94 [156]. This is part of a week in Los Angeles. During the tour, they'll encounter two famous gents, Tommy Lasorda and Johnny Carson. Be sure to have a look! (YouTube link) BONO & THE EDGE: A SORT OF HOMECOMING WITH DAVE\n\nMar. 9, 2023: The world premiere of Bono and The Edge: A Sort of Homecoming with Dave Letterman had the aforementioned individuals together in Los Angeles yesterday. This story is on deadline.com. It doesn't appear that this event is available on any media at this point. STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: MIKE BUCZIEWICZ\n\nMar. 7, 2023: Mike Bucziewicz was a Late Show producer, who brought in a bunch of interesting human interest guests, as well as news anchors, Diet CokeÂ® + MentosÂ® scientists and politicians. He tells the story of the great Norm Macdonald's final appearance. You'll see the epic cold-open stunt for the final LSDL on May 20, 2015, with former Presidents of the United States Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush proclaiming that \"Our long, national nightmare is over.\" Barack Obama ties the ribbon on it with, \"Letterman is Retiring.\" You'll see daredevil stunts on 53rd Street. Mike enjoyed involving network news anchors in wacky stunts. This is a fun look back, so click the link! (YouTube link) No, Rupert didn't officially sponsor this presentation (as he does Mike's), but visit hello-deli.com anyway! THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: NADINE HENNELLY\n\nMar. 3, 2023: The long-awaited visit with Nadine Hennelly is here! It runs 2 hours and 17 minutes, because Nadine had so many stories and comments on her years with Letterman. Nadine is so upbeat and fun in this podcast. She offered countless compliments on fellow staff members. We get a great deal of insight on how everything worked on the show, and how staffers fit into the proceedings. Thanks so much to her, and I hope the Part 2 Mike mentioned happens, as time permits. (YouTube link)\n\nWhen Mike Chisholm was preparing for this extravaganza, he asked me for details on Nadine's appearances on Letterman's shows (mostly LSDL). I found a total of 392 appearances in my episode logs, beginning in 1993. I found 196 appearances as one of the two Hi Ho babes, who welcomed Dave onstage, and 196 appearances in other segments, like \"Will It Float?,\" \"Sex Club Sandwich,\" and \"Dave and Steve's Gay Vacation.\" During the podcast, they refer to 400+ appearances for Nadine, so I may have missed a few of them.\n\nThanks to Mike for a shout out related to background info I provided. It came at around 17 minutes in. Thanks much to Rupert Jee of Hello Deli, who is sponsoring Mike's podcasts. Rupert's not just serving yummy sandwiches. He has a nice variety of Letterman shirts and souvenirs. Visit hello-deli.com! Nadine and Andrea Sande had a number of visits to Hello Deli to present a Deli Platter to a segment contestant.\n\nHere's a very simple web page I put together for Nadine - from my LSDL episode logs - that shows 429 of her appearances.\n\nFinally... Nadine has been in the composite picture at the top of this page since I made it, because I always totally enjoyed her parts in the show.\n\nSTAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: BARBARA SHEEHAN\n\nFeb. 28, 2023: What a nice surprise! LNDL Production Assistant Barbara Sheehan introduces funny and offbeat appearances. There's a look back at Barbara Sheehan Week, in October 1987. Later that month, she helped announce a few episodes. On 4/24/86, Barbara served as the voice of a roughtail stingray (borrowed from a museum). She showed us Martin Scorcese's mother making pizza on 11/22/91. I always enjoyed Barbara's segments, because she's beautiful, and I loved her voice. She always played her role low-key, and sort of disinterested. OK... here's your link! (YouTube link) NATALIE PORTMAN CUT CLASS TO BE ON LSDL\n\nFeb. 27, 2023: I remember this one! Natalie Portman held her own with Dave real well. She was confident and fun in her first visit to see Dave, on 11/28/94 [279]. She was there, at 13 years old, to plug her first film, The Professional, directed by Luc Besson. It's been too long since I've seen it. She went on to be an A student at Harvard, and win an Academy Award. (YouTube link)\n\nBy the way, Natalie ultimately appeared on LSDL 17 times, from 1994 to 2013. An interesting pattern I noticed in my episode logs is that 13 of her 17 appearances occurred in February, May or November Sweeps.\n\nHENRY MANCINI CONDUCTS THE \"VIEWER MAIL\" THEME\n\nFeb. 27, 2023: This is on the short list of my favorite Letterman moments. It came up without advance notice. On 11/04/88, C. Paul Tilson-Shaffer announced that the great Henry Mancini had composed a new theme for Viewer Mail, and was in the house, with a string emsemble of about 10 musicians, ready to perform the catchy theme song. Lenny Pickett was sitting in on saxophone, by the way, and the World's Most Dangerous Band accompanied the emsemble. It was brilliant! (YouTube link) By the way, on 8/04/89, Henry Mancini and Johnny Mathis performed another Viewer Mail theme. THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: JASON ZINOMAN\n\nFeb. 24, 2023: Mike Chisholm, the proprietor of Underpants Productions, has as his latest guest Jason Zinoman, the comedy critic of The New York Times. And... Jason's the author of the bestseller, Letterman, The Last Giant of Late Night. (Amazon link) (Kindle edition) Jason traveled all over the place to get background info for the book: Los Angeles, Broad Ripple, Indiana and Ball State. He did visit with Dave, but at the point when most of the book had been completed. So... it's not one of those authorized biographies. Jason felt that Dave wanted some distance from the book. He said that the book was three years in the making, which resulted in some interesting dynamics along with way. Mike Chisholm asked the interesting question of how - if at all - the book changed after Jason met with Dave. The answer was that there were numerous things in the book that wouldn't have been included, had Dave not been available to verify them.\n\nAn interesting thing to me is Jason's emphasis of Merrill Markoe's influence on big picture - and very specific - aspects of Letterman's shows. He calls Merrill a forerunner. Jason also gives major credit to Hal Gurnee for memorable aspects of Dave's shows (like Dog Poetry). Another topic, which I've long known, is the significance of Dave as a reactor or straight man... for example, to crazy characters on the show, like Chris Elliott and Lyle the Intern, or visiting places like Just Bulbs.\n\nI highly recommend this 1.5 hours' worth of memories. Jason had so many interesting topics, and takes on things that Mike brought up. Finally, here's your reminder to visit hello-deli.com. Thanks, Rupert Jee! Finally, Part 2... here's your YouTube link for the interview! (I got so caught up in the podcast that I almost failed to properly link to it. I have no excuse.) Finally, Part 3, you can follow Jason Zinoman on Twitter: @zinoman, on Instagram @zinomanj and on Facebook.\n\nWILL LEE AND HIS SADOWSKY SIGNATURE BASS GUITAR\n\nFeb. 23, 2023: I have tremendous appreciation for Uncle Will Lee, because of his superior musical talent, and also for his loyalty to the Letterman shows (all 33 seasons in late night). In this web page, Will tells about collaborating with Roger Sadowsky on his ideas for the ultimate bass guitar. A fair number of the terminology was over my head, but you have to admire his knowledge! GERARD MULLIGAN AS PEYTON MANNING\n\nFeb. 20, 2023: This fun segment is from 2/05/07 [2698]. The gifted comedy writer and thespian, Gerard Mulligan, gives a touching portrayal of Super Bowl MVP Peyton Manning answering viewers' questions. I especially enjoyed the air horn. (YouTube video) / When you've finished that assignment, I recommend Gerard as Paris Hilton. THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: FELICIA COLLINS, PART 2\n\nFeb. 17, 2023: I'm 14 hours late announcing Part 2 of Mike Chisholm's visit with Felicia Collins. (YouTube link) You must not miss this!\n\nFelicia has all kinds of details on the CBSO, and its evolution over the years! An interesting comment was that her fellow musicians were so talented, that asking them to play a new song was never an imposition. MacArthur Park, by Will, was very special to Felicia. She said he's a genius and gifted.\n\nDon Giller mentioned (in Mike's earpiece, I guess), the Soul Survivors song, Expressway to Your Heart, released in 1967. (I clicked around on several versions, until I found this linked version, which sounds just like something the CBSO would play.) When Mike brought it up, Felicia sang a bit of it for us!\n\nFelicia said that once the band got ear monitors, the jokes they cracked to each other were nonstop and hilarious (and unknown to anyone else).\n\nFelicia says she can draw like Leonardo DaVinci. She especially likes using just a pencil. (She went to art school, and she also studied graphic design.)\n\nPaul's Cape Thing was something Felicia really liked. Don Giller had to jump in and announce that the song was Al Cooper's \"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know.\" She never knew which celebrity was going to put the cape on Paul. My episode logs show that the first episode was on 6/07/02 [1819], and it ran on Fridays, usually, to 6/11/04. (Hey... I have a special web page for Paul's Cape Thing!)\n\nOther topics include Warren Zevon, being in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame band, and the last few weeks of LSDL \"It felt different,\" Felicia said, and \"We felt grateful.\" Felicia says she be up for a reunion show.\n\nI'll conclude for now with my sincere thanks to Felicia and Mike for an extremely enjoyable, comprehensive, funny and uplifting 2 hours and 33 minutes of conversation, memories and behind-the-scenes fun facts.\n\nSTAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: JOE GROSSMAN\n\nFeb. 14, 2023: My, oh my, we're having some fun now! Will Joe be reading from his little notebook as he hosts tonight's festivities? (YouTube link) Yes! He read from his little notebook, and so did Harrison Ford!\n\nWhat an ending. It's one of my favorites... A Monkey Sneezing! The premiere, I believe, was on 11/27/08. Time passed, and on 12/19/12, we got A Baby Panda Sneezing. Are you still with me? One mere day later, 12/20/12, we had A Baby Panda and a Baby Llama Sneezing. To welcome in winter, on 12/21/12, we enjoyed A Monkey Sneezing and a Surprise Guest. Winter gave way to spring, and on 5/17/13 we had A Monkey Sneezing: Allergy Edition.\n\nIf you'd like to see more Joe Grossman, mosey on over to my Video Archives (alphabetized for your convenience), and scroll down to the Joe Grossman videos. Now, Rupert Jee didn't sponsor this Favorite Moments video, but visit hello-deli.com anyway!\n\nBEST OF BIFF HENDERSON AT THE SUPER BOWL\n\nFeb. 14, 2023: Here's a fun look back. Thanks, LETTERMAN Channel! (YouTube link) VALENTINE'S DAY ON LETTERMAN, 1996\n\nFeb. 14, 2023: Our pal, The Donz, has posted a video from the exciting days of yesteryear. Various LSDL staff revealed their plans (or hopes) for Valentine's Day, after TV Boy asked Mary Tyler Moore to get hitched, and she trotted offstage. (YouTube link) THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: FELICIA COLLINS, PART 1\n\nFeb. 11, 2023: If you're a fan of the CBS Orchestra, you must not miss this podcast, as Mike Chisholm visits with Felicia Collins, guitarist, for 1 hr. 9 min. (YouTube link)\n\nFelicia's first time on Letterman was with Cyndi Lauper, on 5/27/93, on LNDL. Then came a call from Paul Shaffer, to invite Felicia to join the CBSO on LSDL. She was on Episode 1, 8/30/93, and was formally introduced on 8/31/93. She was hesitant for a bit, as she was a busy musician, who didn't watch TV!\n\nThis is an incredible interview! The interaction between Felicia and host Mike Chisholm is awesome. Mike has extensive knowledge of - and appreciation for - music, and the questions and topics he brings up are so interesting. Felicia is very forthcoming with stories and memories, and is upbeat and funny. I'll definitely be watching this episode often.\n\nWhen I complimented Mike on this awesomeness (and asked about Part 2), he replied, \"Part 2 is quite a bit longer, and of course it goes into much more Letterman stuff... Some really cool, insightful highlights about the show, and Dave himself.\" (I don't know yet when the release will be uploaded.)\n\nThanks much to Rupert Jee of Hello Deli, who is sponsoring Mike's podcasts. Rupert's not just serving yummy sandwiches. He has a nice variety of Letterman shirts and souvenirs. Visit hello-deli.com!\n\nTHE LETTERMAN CHANNEL: SALLY FIELD\n\nFeb. 8, 2023: Here's a fun guest segment with Sally Field, from LSDL 2/06/95 [319]. She tells about her early acting work, including Gidget and The Flying Nun. She was so beautiful in this appearance, which is hardly a surprise. On this early February day, Sally ended up throwing snowballs at the CBS Orchestra. (YouTube link) DAVE SPENDS THE DAY WITH CONNIE CHUNG\n\nFeb. 8, 2023: It's supposedly Connie's day off, so she goes shopping with TV Boy. This is from LNDL, 3/17/89. There's a shoe store visit, a stop at a wienie stand. (At that stop, a bus with hubby Maury Povich's picture on the side! (LETTERMAN channel link) THE LETTERMAN PODCAST: JEFF MARTIN, PART 2\n\nFeb. 3, 2023: Here's the long-awaited Part 2 of the visit with Flunky himself, Jeff Martin! Part 2 runs 1:46! Guess what! The Donz will be sitting in on this part! (Part 2 link) (Part 1 link) Hey! Visit hello-deli.com, or else. I did not know or remember this. Jeff said that Joe Toplyn was the first actor-singer, but Jeff did it later. (This was a segment when something untoward would happen to an actor-singer, and Paul would throw an extended tantrum and rant.) PAUL SHAFFER TALKS REUNITING WITH THE WMDB / CBSO, AND RETURNING TO 30 ROCK\n\nFeb. 3, 2023: Jimmy Fallon's band members are off to the Grammys, I believe, so Jimmy contacted Paul about his band subbing for them today. Paul has a nice, four-minute visit with Jimmy about the old days. (YouTube link) BILL MURRAY CHEERS UP AN AUDIENCE MEMBER\n\nFeb. 2, 2023: Bill Murray, was an LNDL guest on 2/12/93, plugging Groundhog Day. First Bill treats us to a jazzy version of the LNDL theme song. Then Mr. Murray and Rev. Al Sharpton team up to console and cheer up a troubled teen from the audience. (YouTube link) CHRIS ELLIOTT DINES ON DOG FOOD\n\nFeb. 2, 2023: From the Letterman channel and the 9/08/89 LNDL, here's an epic \"Viewer Mail\" segment. Our beloved Chris Elliott, attired in a lab coat, taste tests older and new versions of Ken-L rationÂ®, making television history. (YouTube link) / Shelley Winters and O. J. Simpson were guests that night. LARRY \"BUD\" MELMAN HIGHLIGHTS FROM \"LNDL\" YEAR 1\n\nFeb. 1, 2023: Wake the kids, phone the neighbors! Here are about four minutes' worth of highlights (or bloopers, in some cases) from 1982, featuring Calvert. (YouTube link) DAVE RAFFLES AN AUTOGRAPHED LATE SHOW JACKET\n\nFeb. 1, 2023: On the occasion of the 41st anniversary of the first Letterman show, Dave is with Barbara Gaines, Mary Barclay and Bill Scheft. He's raffling one of his letter jackets, to benefit the World Food Programme. Raffle tickets cost $20. To get one or more, click here! (Hmmm. It appears that this raffle, announced on Feb. 1, has already closed, and $20,000 was raised. Ha! Guess what. I have one of that year's jackets! Here's the YouTube video link.\n\nHey! I'm back with a follow-up, posted on 2/07/23. Dave and Gaines have one of those spinning cages that you use to pick a raffle winner. The Late Show jacket about to be awarded is from 1995. 1,000 $20 tickets were bought. The $20,000 will go to the World Food Programme. Drum roll, please, Anton... Victor Alvis is our winner. (Letterman Channel link)\n\nTHE CRISPIN GLOVER INCIDENT\n\nFeb. 1, 2023: What do we think... the weirdest thing ever on a Letterman episode? This is from 7/28/87, when Crispin Hellion Glover came on in high-heeled shoes, kind of hippie clothes, old-fashioned glasses and a big, brown woman's wig. Crispin seemed extremely agitated and paranoid. His voice was shaky. He seemed terrified to be there. He brought a newspaper article about recent behavior on his part. Then he went on an unprompted tirade about his physical abilities. He showed his strong biceps. Then he turned toward Dave and did a karate kick. That's when Dave left the desk, and Hal went to commercials. Somehow, Crispin has managed to continue his career into 2022. (YouTube link) (Wikipedia link) STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: NANCY AGOSTINI\n\nJan. 31, 2023: Don't miss this! Executive Producer Nancy Agostini hosts the latest Staff Favorite Moments. It's a real good one! (YouTube link) Nancy spent the last 10 years of the show at the executive producer podium at stage left.\n\nOne great memory is from 6/24/04 [2194]. My episode log says: \"Summer Products\" / Things didn't go exactly as planned. Dave eats a fake charcoal briquette, which unexpectedly turns his tongue and teeth black. He's a mess. The stuff ends up on his face, and staffers start bringing items to try to help him clean up. He gets a moist towelette. He's given hydrogen peroxide, which he unknowingly drinks. What was that stuff, anyway?\"\n\nPAUL SHAFFER AND THE WMDB WILL SUB FOR THE ROOTS\n\nJan. 30, 2023: Jimmy Fallon has invited Paul and the WMDB to sub for his band on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, while they're at the Grammys. This will be on Feb. 3. Here's a report from Rolling Stone. I guess this will be my first time to watch a TV show since August 1, 2017! DAVE SPENDS THE DAY WITH JOE MONTANA\n\nJan. 30, 2023: I'm slow posting this, because I was busy following my Kansas City Chiefs winning the AFC championship. This is a really good remote segment, recorded in San Francisco, for 5/07/96 [586], on the occasion of the Late Show's week in S. F.\n\nHey... I just looked at that date again. I was in San Francisco that day, because I was in the audience the next day. CBS flew me and my friend Dave from Kansas for free, because I won the national Letterman trivia contest CBS ran to promote the week. By the way, Mujibur and Sirajul and Rupert made the trip out there, too. (YouTube link)\n\nTHE LETTERMAN PODCAST: JEFF MARTIN\n\nJan. 27, 2023: Mike Chisholm is really gettin' it done! Flunky the Clown himself, Jeff Martin, spent 1.33 hours with Mike, in his latest podcast. I'm watching it as I'm entering this announcement. Jeff is really forthcoming with fun stories and info for this episode. Jeff wrote only for LNDL, from 1983 - 1990. He was in Flunky episodes from 1986 - 1989. (Jeff got a goodbye bumper on 2/16/90.) (The Letterman Podcast YouTube link) (Flunky the Clown videos / Thanks, Don Giller.) Hey! At the end of the podcast, Mike announced that there will be a Part 2! Now, how about a visit to hello-deli.com! COUNTDOWN TO THE DEBUT OF LATE NIGHT\n\nJanuary 27, 2023: The big premiere of the 11-year run of LNDL was on February 1, 1982... but you knew that. TV's Don Giller posted this 1 hr. 33 min. retrospective on the premiere. It's a variety of clips. You'll hear from Hal Gurnee and Paul Shaffer. There are clips of Dave hosting Tonight. Dave's a guest on Tonight, to discuss his new show. We'll get the background on Calvert's somber warning, which was the cold open of Episode 1. Oh! I don't think I'd ever noticed... in the Episode 1 control room party scene, Pete Fatovich is who was playing the accordion. I catch on eventually... sometimes. Then we get into the full episode 1. Bill Murray, of course, was a guest on the first LNDL, and the last interview guest on LSDL. It was so good to see Mr. Wizard. I watched him all the time when I was a youngster. Thanks so much to Don for this look back! (YouTube link) STAFF FAVORITE MOMENTS: ERIC AND JUSTIN STANGEL\n\nJanuary 25, 2023: Over time, the Stangels were credited as Head Writers and Executive Producers. They have 19 minutes of fun, especially about segments. Stories include Dave's mom, Rupert, Henry Kissinger reading school absence excuse notes, outings with Biff, and the Aftonbladet. Then they get into the Super Bowl promo for LSDL, involving Leno, Oprah and Dave in 2010. A really fun part of this has clips of Jimmi Simpson as Lyle, the Intern. I think this was one of the funniest recurring bits ever done on the show. It was in 2008, at least. The Stangels had seen him on TV, and when he was doing a Broadway show, the Stangels got him to show up now and then, and do his super-creepy character. Those were priceless! (YouTube link) HAL GURNEE'S NETWORK TIME KILLER: GIANT DOMINOES\n\nJanuary 25, 2023: This is from LNDL, 6/27/90. Hal Gurtner sent Dave out to the 6th-floor hallway for a surprise. His mission: to topple. (YouTube link) 1. If"
