        "text": "The most recent concept album I bought was Green Day's American Idiot. Great power-punk rock with more than a little influence from The Who (by their own admission).\n\n+1 - yep this recent album def fits the \"concept album\" category - so much so that a musical was based on it.\n\nI saw that musical, and was somewhat underwhelmed, however - not in ANY way because of the music (which I quite like), but because of two other things:\n\nthe script kept screaming \"drugs are bad, drugs will kill you\" - true, but the main writer (Billy Joe) was in rehab at the very time I was seeing the play\n\nthe \"sanitized\" version of the songs (guitars way down in the mix, which IMO are the very essence of green day music) made the play sound more like the cast of \"Glee\" doing Green Day than an edgy musical, which it really should have been\n\nHopefully not, I never could stand them. I can think of few things more pretentious than a \"concept album\" - a bunch of off-their-faces hippies insisting they know the real truth of the universe.\n\nPlease....\n\nJust play your guitar!\n\nYour post reminded me of this vintage Sam Kinison along with Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nSam Kinison! Greatest contemporary history lesson EVER given! - YouTube\n\nSay it Say it!!!!! Love that part of that movie....lol\n\nI dig some concept albums. But I think they have to come with a hit or two somewhere within the concept in order to be fully listenable.\n\nAsia Alpha is a great album that revolves around a single concept of all the emotions of a relationship from heaven to hell but it doesn't seem forced.\n\nStyx was very good at churning out a central theme but with hits coming from that theme.\n\nAnd APP Tales of Mystery and Imagination as someone else mentioned is just flat out cool. But when is Poe ever not cool?\n\nI'm a huge Gilmour fan but I agree with the pretentiousness of Pink Floyd at times. But I think you see the culprit in a lot of that when you listen to Gilmour's solo albums or post Waters Floyd. Gilmour is certainly political and a hippie at heart but his music doesn't have to revolve around that.\n\nI love concept albums.\n\nRushÂ´s \"Clockwork Angels\" is maybe the last great concept album, but theres lots of em in the 70s, 80s, and 90s:\n\nPink Floyd - The Wall\n\nThe Who - Tommy\n\nJethro Tull - Thick As A Brick\n\nGenesis - The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\n\nRush - 2112 (as well as the Cygnus X trilogy on \"Hemispheres\" and \"Farewell To Kings\", just great)\n\nYES - Tales From Topographic Oceans\n\nAlan Parsons - Tales f Mistery And Imagination\n\nQueensryche - Operation Mindcrime\n\nIron Maiden - Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\n\nWASP - The Crimson Idol\n\nSavatage - Streets A Rock Opera\n\nDream Theater - Metropolis Pt2 Scenes From A memory\n\netc"
