        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — On a quiet residential street in Beverly Hills, a spacious cream-colored house is occupied solely on weekdays, mostly by women in casual T-shirts or sundresses, with multiple ear piercings and arrays of gold chains around their necks.\n\nScattered around the house are what might best be described as bohemian tchotchkes: crystal bowls from various vacations, large rocks, feathers, small statues picked up at flea markets and a shrine filled with, among other things, vintage dollhouse teepees. Frequently a well-known actress or model will stop by, stay for a few hours and leave with a shopping bag in hand. The overall aesthetic — relaxed, free-spirited, upscale but not showy — parallels what’s designed and sold here.\n\nThe unmarked home is the headquarters of Jacquie Aiche, a jeweler whose luxe, hippie-skewed pieces are stocked at stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche, the Paris store that this month unveiled a pop-up department spotlighting Ms. Aiche’s work and has included it in a storewide initiative showcasing Los Angeles-based brands.\n\nThe pieces that Ms. Aiche (pronounced eye-EESH) and her team create are designed for informal wear — and layering, as Ms. Aiche did on a recent warm morning, teaming the pieces she described as her “second skin” (including several delicate anklets and a thin gold chain with diamonds that stretched around her neck, down her torso and around her waist) with loose Levi’s cutoff shorts and a spaghetti-strap T-shirt.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
