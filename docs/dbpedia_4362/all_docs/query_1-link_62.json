        "text": "Anyone can write and edit the articles in Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia is a free online encyclopedia containing millions of articles. Anyone can write and edit the articles. This is seen by some as a weakness and by others as a strength. As anyone can write or edit an article you can never be sure that the information is not biased, out of date or simply incorrect. On the other hand, Wikipedia supporters claim that as so many people are constantly reviewing and updating the articles, any inaccuracies are swiftly identified and corrected. Some lecturers are opposed to students using Wikipedia and will mark down assignments which cite Wikipedia. On the other hand Wikipedia can be seen as a valuable and unique resource which many students use anyway... with or without their lecturers' approval."
