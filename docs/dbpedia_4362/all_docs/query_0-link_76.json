        "text": "Oh that's so cool - I was hoping somebody was trying out stuff. Don't know if you agreed with some of my comments on those albums - I remember \"Jane\" was a song I wasn't thrilled with and people pointed out that I was too tough on that one.\n\nFor Grace, her 4 solo albums are strange like they should be but 'Welcome to the Wrecking Ball' and 'Software' are derivative of sounds from the era - classic rock and then new wave. They have Grace stamps on them but I think 'Dreams' it all came together. She went to a couple of latin-tinged tunes, a Russian-styled pop song, some power ballads and classic rock and that combo I think worked best. It gave listeners some commercial, some creative and then jumped internationally into other styles. Great vocals - dramatic at times - a lot of dramatic moments and an admittance of her issues. It was her highest charter at #32 (I think 32) and with more promotion, it could have gone farther. That's her lost great album to me.\n\nI once did a four-CDR box set of JA/JS material from '66 - '76. Modeled after Flight Log, the double-LP set from 1977. Since it's two albums with four sides, I just expanded every side to fit on an 80 minute CDR. Flight Log is interesting in itself because it utilizes tracks from JA, Hot Tuna, JS, Paul Kantner, Grace Slick, etc. So I did the same, but I also included Great Society, Jorma Kaukonen, and Bodacious D.F. In other words, everything I owned from those ten years.\n\nLong story short, the Jefferson Starship material didn't sound out of place. If you only look at the highlights from the first three JS albums, then it feels like a seamless progression over a decade from the mid '60s to the mid '70s. I no longer have the track list but one could easily do the same if you have all of the CDs. The only song on Flight Log which is unavailable anywhere else is a live one at the end of the LP called \"Please Come Back\" which I had to have a friend do a vinyl to CDR transfer.\n\nAfter this thread popped up, I had tried out 'Flight Log' again and I still have issues with it. Though I like that there's no space between songs, I don't like the individual track choices sometimes and then I have trouble with the sequencing. There is one other comp that has a mix but that's it. I think for covering 20 years and 3 bands, it works somewhat well. I've only heard it once - I put it together as a playlist since I don't own it. But yes, it's missing Bodacious, all the solo stuff, Great Society, Hot Tuna, SVT, KBC, on and on."
