        "text": "Technically this should be called, “Meanwhile, Back In East Peoria’s Past,” because the subject of this week’s backward glancing post, Sam Kinison grew up in East Peoria. But Kinison usually just said he was from Peoria.\n\nKinison’s father was a preacher and they moved to East Peoria when Sam was just three months old. He grew up there and even went to East Peoria Community High School.\n\nHe tried his hand at preaching but after his first divorce in 1980, he decided to move to Houston, Texas and that’s where he turned his fire and brimstone style of preaching into one of the most unique stand-up comic styles ever.\n\nSam became one of the most popular and sought after comedians of his era, but he loved to come back to Peoria and bask in being a hometown hero. Lots of Peorian’s have Sam stories and I’m one of those people.\n\nYou can read my story and more about Sam’s East Peoria roots below.\n\nPlus there’s also a few photos of Sam with various people though the years.\n\n——"
