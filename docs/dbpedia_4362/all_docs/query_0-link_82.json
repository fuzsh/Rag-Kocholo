        "text": "Though by mounted, are they riding actual horses, weird puppets, or one of those pantomime costumes?\n\nWooden stick horse, rocking horse, prancing around banging coconuts together.\n\nMostly mounted on actual horse and donkey, and only there on occasion as an Easter Egg for those paying attention. But I'm sure some cast members will do the coconuts gag at some point, probably some Python fans.\n\nI still think this will lead to Disney forming a Smithsonian Chanel based off their work together.\n\nOkay, I admit that my mind is split on whether Disney should do an earlier Smithsonian Channel (instead of in 2006 with Showtime*), or do a National Geographic channel with NGS, unlike IOTL where 20th Century Fox did such (ITTL part ). Jim would definitely be behind what Nat Geo stands for, in both subject matter and what it stands for.\n\nEither seems a possibility. I can see good arguments either way. Smithsonian could be facilitated through PBS contacts. As someone else noted NatGeo via NBC.\n\nLew Grade just facilitated the discussion; the partner is Pearson PLC, who (in 1990) own the Tussauds Group. And it's just a 30% stake.\n\nYes this. Pearson is now essentially a shareholder in DLV and PD. Disney maintains majority stake in both cases.\n\nI know that Pearson has taken the brunt of the revenue, but I hope our friend LLG got a little bit of the cash for his role as the negotiator. BTW how has he been doing these past few years? Does he have a job again or is he still battling with bankruptcy?\n\nHe's been working deals on the West End. You will hear from him again.\n\nPlease @Geekhis Khan it's not entirely sure if we can even do Christmas Markets this year and now you come here and just casually rub salt into the wound! What have I done to you?\n\nEs tut mir Leid, mein Freund. Sorry to reopen any wounds there.\n\nI haven't experienced a German Christmas in decades, so I actually get it. They are actually a time of joy and goodwill. What a concept!!\n\nLook on the bright side, you still won't have to have an American Christmas:\n\n\"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas...\"\n\nI mean you probably could build Disneyland Antarctica if you spent enough, but it will always struggle to attract visitors.\n\nRecall that there was a \"Disneyland Antarctica\" reference in Card's Retirement Party Muppet performance.\n\nThat and \"Project Y (Shh! Shh! Shh!)\"\n\nAssuming a better public opinion of AIDS and HIV Isaac Asimov's family may not hide his HIV status when he dies in 1992, especially if they reveal how it happened:\n\nYes, they openly say the cause per his wishes to help destigmatize it.\n\nIf we're saving Sam Kinison this is the year to do it:\n\nRecall that he avoids the accident, but ODs in 1997.\n\nLets not forget Conor Clayton:\n\nWell, random butterflies pretty much prevent that very random and tragic death. I guess that means no \"Tears in Heaven\".\n\nBut to rebel against his famous dad, Connor never picks up a guitar and instead becomes a Certified Public Accountant.\n\nAnd I can't save everyone!\n\nOK. 1993 is on the horizon, so here's hoping that Dino-Force 5 becomes as big a hit as MMPR.\n\nIIRC someone or ones were writing up a guest post on the continuing adventures of BF5. I need to recheck my PMs.\n\nJim has, clearly, never been to Italy.\n\nTurning 1980s FIAT Panda models into deadly weapons is basically the national sport over here.\n\nLOL, what do you think inspired that line? I've done some crazy, death-defying shit in my life, but one of the scariest was the Gonzo-like stunt performance of Simply Crossing the Street in Downtown Cagliari.\n\nYou can't be serious -- I can see nighttime talk shows doing this -- but morning talk shows are a horse of a different color.\n\nMorning Talk Shows are apparently a Crapsacarine Hellmouth of Machiavellian intrigue. Or so has been alleged.\n\nSee: \"Matt Lauer\".\n\nCome on @Geekhis Khan I through this was supposed to be a realistic timeline!ðŸ˜‚\n\nAll jokes aside the OTL score was 1-1.\n\nAlso, no Octopus? I guess that's off the DisneySea menu....\n\nWell, he's not forcing other people to make his choices. And yes, he's self-aware of the little hypocrisy about pork. Doesn't even try to justify it.\n\nProbably not a siesta during a work day (he's probably still a workaholic), but maybe he'll enjoy his breaks more or actually spend time resting after work hours.\n\nUhhhh, I'm pretty sure Geekhis mentioned that Disney accommodated for the siesta for their cast members at Valencia a while back.\n\nYes, they have Siesta Rooms for the staff in the Tunnels. Staff can siesta on a rotating basis. He's been known to take \"power naps\" or occasionally just fall asleep in his chair working on something.\n\nI'd never - my father had one, and I would've gotten one too, if I were able to drive a car with manual transmission; I can't, due to weird medical reasons, so I had to get a Smart instead. It's a cool car still, I like small cars. Thank fuck Henson didn't try and plop a Disneyland somewhere in Italy though, even though we might be up there with Finland when it comes to fondness for classic Disney characters in Europe, and a Paperinik-themed ride would've been quite the sight, the chaos of it all would've been too much for even Henson to handle.\n\nYeah, my wife need to drive one for your same reason and frankly as a city car is very good especially if there is a lack of parking space. Speaking of Paperinik, it will be fun Jim reaction to the italian stable of disney characters and more importantly to the tradition of the Parodie.\n\nTo translate for everyone else, the italian local disney comic production in his 70 years old tradition had produced a lot of original characters that here and in many part of europe have become extremely linked to the name Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck among them Paperinik (in USA translated as the Duck Avenger) basically Donald Duck as a superhero like Batman and a scarily efficient and terrifying one and naturally John Davidson Rockerduck the eternal second richest duck of the world and nasty rival to Scrooge McDuck (sure it was created in america but there used very sparsely, here in Italy it's Scrooge number one enemy and characterizated by the fact that every time he lose he eat his hat...he lose so much that by now he had even preference on how that hat is cooked).\n\nThe Parodie are a tradition of the italian disney production, basically a retelling of myths and classic book and stories with disney characters recast as the protagonist, the first was the classic Dante's Inferno (Transformed in Topolino's Inferno) but we had also Moby Duck, Duckestein, the strange case of Doctor Mickey and Mr. Duck and many others."
