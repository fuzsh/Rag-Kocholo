Nik gains access to some of the most elite motorcycle collections in the world for his followers. Because of his love for Italian Motorcycles, especially Benelli, he was named the American ambassador for the cities of Pesaro, Italy and San Rafael, Argentina; Places he visits biannually.\n\nL.A. Nik was invited to throw out the first pitch for a Major League Baseball game between the Tampa Rays and the Minnesota Twins at Target Field. In 2015, L.A. Nik was featured in a Showtime Network documentary on comedian Pauly Shore where he recounts his friendship with Sam Kinison and Pauly Shore in the late 80s and early 90s.\n\nNik’s popularity in the midwest was cemented by a two-page cover story in Minneapolis' Star Tribune as well as a slew of morning shows and print stories after the 2013 release of his book, Life Is Short Then You’re Dead Forever. This led to the city of Fargo, North Dakota hiring Nik to showcase their city to visitors from outside of the midwest in an online advertisement.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, L.A. Nik joined his first band, The Prostitutes, at age fifteen as a drummer. The Prostitutes later joined forces with Billy Gram’s band Saints in Hell which had included Tommy Kiefer and Eric Brittingham of the future 80’s rock band Cinderella. Nik was known during this time as Nikki Fear. After being detained for drugs in the British West Indies, L.A. Nik missed a show with Saints in Hell and was replaced. Soon thereafter, Nik scored a gig with Joel Gray’s Cabaret through long-time friend and bassist Paul Barbas. When the show’s producer died of cancer Nik started the band, The Unexpected, with now famous Kiss guitar builder Jimmy Cara. After a long struggle to find a record deal for the band, L.A. Nik relocated to Los Angeles from the east coast.\n\nOnce in Los Angeles, L.A. Nik teamed up with Exposure 54 night club owner David Max and opened the after-hours club, The Pleasure Dome, at 2817 Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles. The club featured the 80’s rock band, Bang Tango. Nik was given an artists relation pass by Gypsy Carns of Gibson Guitars. With this, Nik outfitted the Pleasure Dome’s house band with unlimited gear. The pass allowed Nik to pull gear from Gibson at any time without question for use by the bands playing the club. The club lasted from 1987 to 1991 when it was raided by the Los Angeles Police Department. With the club closed down, Nik relocated to Palm Beach, FL to pursue his love of restoring vintage cars.\n\nL.A. Nik opened Delray Vintage and Palm Beach Vintage specializing in installing air-conditioning in vintage automobiles. He ran the business for eleven years then returned to Los Angeles. Nik was adopted by the family of comics at the World Famous Comedy Store on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood where he became a staple figure.\n\nSocial Media\n\nNik is a social media rockstar with over one million minutes viewed per day. Nik takes his followers on Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms into the most elite motorcycle collections in the world. Nik is currently available for branding partnerships.\n\nBook\n\nLife is Short Then You’re Dead Forever is a realistic self-help book. The book is the culmination of L.A. Nik’s life of experience with people, careers, drugs, poverty and wealth. L.A. Nik explores born-in “powers,” in the form of chapter titles that do not come easy for many, but are identifiable in all successful people. The book has a five star rating on Amazon.com.\n\nHost"
