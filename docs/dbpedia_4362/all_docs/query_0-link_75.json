        "text": "Category: Poplar Creek\n\nPOPLAR CREEK’S 14TH SEASON: 1993\n\nIt was becoming more and more clear by 1993 that the 30,000-seat Poplar Creek Music Theater was losing steam. Between the competition with World Music Theater in Tinley Park, IL and fewer large scale, big-name tours, it was getting tougher and tougher to book concert dates. That, however, didn’t stop agents from booking over 30 dates for that year.\n\nThe talent booker for Poplar Creek did a nice job of organizing a variety of acts that would appeal to the Chicagoland public. Most acts played rock music but there were others like Yanni who performed New Age instrumental pieces, Reba McEntire who sang country, and Johnny Mathis who was known for his easy-listening style.\n\nNot to be overlooked was the Disney Symphonic Fantasy. A Chicago Tribune article from August 3, 1993 stated this “live show uses a live symphony orchestra to perform music made famous by and in Disney features would seem a natural, which is what “Disney’s Symphonic Fantasy” is all about. The two-hour musical revue is on a 22-city national tour that touched down at Poplar Creek Sunday… Elaborately costumed and choreographed scenes from ‘Fantasia,’ ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,’ ‘The Jungle Book,’ ‘Mary Poppins,’ ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ ‘The Little Mermaid’ and ‘Aladdin’ form the heart of the show, with Broadway-like dance routines figuring heavily in to the entertainment mix.”\n\nMusic festivals were scheduled for six dates where multiple performers sang over the course of the day/evening. In comparison, there were 14 occasions where only one performer played onstage. And, there were only three acts who double booked two nights in a row: Rod Stewart, Jimmy Buffett and Bette Midler.\n\nJimmy Buffett was simply a powerhouse performer for Poplar Creek. He played every year from 1980 to 1989, skipped 1990, and was back again from 1991-1993. In fact, Paul Sloan, in a September 30, 1993 recap of the year in the Chicago Tribune, said he had two sold-out performances.\n\nTake a look at the Summer 1993 lineup:\n\nMay 30 Poison, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Damn Yankees, Enuff Z’ Nuff, Firehouse, Life, Sex and Death\n\nJune 6 Steve Miller Band with Paul Rodgers\n\nJune 11 10,000 Maniacs and World Party\n\nJune 13 WXRT Budget Show with Little Feat, Tragically Hip, the Connells and Sand Rubles\n\nJune 19 Chicago, The Stephen Stills Band\n\nJune 25 The Moody Blues\n\nJune 27 Tina Turner and Lyndsey Buckingham\n\nJune 29 Reggae Sunsplash with Freddie McGregor, Majck Fashek, Shinehead, Marcia Griffiths, Tiger, Mystic Revelers, Skool and M.C.

John played Jake Blues and Dan played Elwood Blues. The skit had actually originated as part of an opening act for Steve Martin, the comedian.\n\nThe “brothers” were dressed in dark suits, thin ties, black hats and sunglasses. They sang R&B songs from the ’50s and ’60s and eventually produced their first album that same year called Briefcase Full Of Blues.\n\nOther albums followed and, in 1980, the movie, The Blues Brothers, opened in theaters on June 20. It was a wild first week. A story by Gene Siskel in the June 29, 1980 issue of the Chicago Tribune, states that the film grossed approximately $6.9 million that week.\n\nCoinciding with that debut, according to both the Wikipedia article on The Blues Brothers and the recently released book by Daniel De Vise, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd subsequently began a musical tour with their band to promote the film. It opened for the first time on June 27, 1980. The location? The brand new Poplar Creek Music Theatre in Hoffman Estates.\n\nThey were the 9th act of the inaugural season following John Denver, Henry Mancini and Sarah Vaughn, Bob Hope and Barbara Eden, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Jefferson Starship, Marvin Hamlisch and Liza Minelli, and Sammy Hagar.\n\nAvailable through Ticketron, pavilion tickets sold for $12.50 and lawn tickets for $8.50. The show began at 8:00 p.m.\n\nWith various members of the audience dressed as Blues Brothers look-alikes, per a Daily Herald caption from June 28, 1980, the duo launched into their first number, a cover of Otis Redding’s song “I Can’t Turn You Loose.” Belushi was the lead singer, with Aykroyd performing intermittent backup.\n\nThey followed it up with 21 more songs, dancing and strutting across the stage. The concert was interspersed with Belushi’s cartwheels and Aykroyd’s harmonica playing. An encore of three songs closed the show and, in a rather unique move, they finished with the same song they started with.\n\nWere you there for that memorable night, for what, today, seems a VERY reasonable ticket price? If so, post some comments and let us know what caught your eye!\n\nJane Rozek\n\nLocal History Librarian\n\nSchaumburg Township District Library\n\njrozek@stdl.org\n\nPOPLAR CREEK’S 13TH SEASON: 1992\n\nIn 1992 Poplar Creek Music Theatre had 35 concert dates on their calendar and 32 acts scheduled. There were a few acts that played multiple nights and they included The Moody Blues, Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band, Crosby, Stills & Nash, and Elton John.\n\nTracy Chapman, who was originally scheduled as the opening act on June 3 to promote her new album Matters of the Heart, cancelled her show because of low ticket sales, as reported in O’Malley and Collin’s column in the June 3 issue of the Chicago Tribune.\n\nUnfortunately, too, the theatre was still unable to schedule the volume of acts that had populated the schedule in the 1980s. In fact, 1989 was the last year that saw 60 acts performing.\n\nThis was also the year that only saw musical acts on the schedule. There were no children’s shows, comedy acts or dance performers. It is curious to consider what might have driven them to make this change.\n\nHere is the 1992 schedule:\n\nJune 5 Chicago and the Moody Blues\n\nJune 6 The Moody Blues\n\nJune 13 Ringo and his All Starr Band featuring Burton Cummings, Joe Walsh, Todd Rundgren, Nils Lofgren,\n\nJune 14 Dolly Parton and Billy Ray Cyrus\n\nJune 20 The Smithereens, The Lemonheads, The Judybats, Peter Case\n\nJuly 1 The Temptations and the Four Tops\n\nJuly 5 Reggae Sunsplash featuring Aswad, Lucky Dube, Barrington Levy, John Holt, Papa San, Skool\n\nJuly 9 John Denver\n\nJuly 10 Paula Abdul with Color Me Badd\n\nJuly 11 Harry Connick Jr. and his Orchestra\n\nJuly 13 Willie Nelson and Sammy Kershaw\n\nJuly 15 the Cure\n\nJuly 24 Natalie Cole\n\nJuly 26 “Psychedelic Celebration” featuring the Band, Robby Krieger, Roger McGuinn and the Dave Mason Band and Richie Havens\n\nAugust 1 Santana with Phish\n\nAugust 2 James Taylor\n\nAugust 7 Beach Boys\n\nAugust 9 Dan Fogelberg\n\nAugust 12 Jimmy Cliff, Burning Spear and Majek Fashek\n\nAugust 14 and 15 Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band\n\nAugust 16 Joe Cocker\n\nAugust 19 Little Feat and George Thorogood & the Destroyers\n\nAugust 22 Reba McEntire, Vince Gill\n\nAugust 24 Eric Clapton with Curtis Stigers\n\nAugust 26 Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nAugust 27 “Blues Music Festival ’92” with B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Dr. John and the Fabulous Thunderbirds\n\nAugust 29 New York Rock and Soul Revue featuring Steely Dan’s Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, Boz Scaggs and Phoebe Snow\n\nAugust 30 Hank Williams Jr. with Patty Loveless and Doug Stone\n\nSeptember 1 Lynrd Skynrd with Delbert McClinton\n\nSeptember 4 Aretha Franklin\n\nSeptember 5 Summertime Country Jam featuring Charlie Daniels, Travis Tritt, Tanya Tucker, Marty Stuart and Mark O’Connor\n\nSeptember 11 and 12 Elton John\n\nSeptember 13 Morrissey\n\nIn Greg Kot’s column in the September 13 issue of the Chicago Tribune, he had this to say about Elton John’s Friday night show on September 11 that wound down the summer season at the arena:\n\n“On Friday at Poplar Creek, the circumstances were quite a bit less humbling, as a packed house saw a revitalized, slimmed down and pumped-up pianist run through his greatest hits and then some with a bouyancy that was lacking on past tours. On Friday, he let the songs carry the show, and why not? It only seemed like John owned the ’70s with one hit after another, and when he kicked off a string of oldies with “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” one of those crowd-pleasing, jukebox nights was in the offing.”\n\nIf you were in attendance at any of the shows, post it in the Comments.

This column originally appeared in the May/June 2023 issue of the Hoffman Estates Citizen, the village’s newsletter. The column appears here, courtesy of the Village of Hoffman Estates.\n\nThe recent announcement on March 14, 2023 by the Cook County Forest Preserve of the establishment of Arthur L. Janura Preserve as a Land & Water Reserve, took me back to the failure of the Leisure World development in 1965 with the financial failure of the Rossmoor Corporation’s Leisure World .\n\nLeisure World was successful in building their retirement communities across the country, in California, and on the east coast. They’re doing well and still draw people over 55 to their gated communities.\n\nFailure isn’t always a failure for all the parties involved in a project. After Hoffman Estates annexed the 3,700 acres needed to build Leisure World, the failure of the planned retirement community of a projected population of 50,000 opened the door for the Cook County Forest Preserve to snatch up the land that would become the Arthur L. Janura Cook County Forest Preserve.\n\nIt was hoped that the Forest Preserve would compromise a bit by allowing the village to keep some of the land for commercial development. No compromise was reached, but it was a very positive outcome for the people of Hoffman Estates.\n\nThe large Arthur L. Janura Preserve contains the Poplar Creek Preserve as well as miles of biking and walking tails. The newly named Poplar Creek Land and Water Reserve is bounded by the Canadian National Railway on the west, Shoe Factory Road on the north, Sutton Road (Rt. 59) on the east and Golf Road on the south, and contains 572.14 acres.\n\nIt is home to at least 27 plant and wildlife species that are in the greatest need of conservation. Poplar Creek is an extension of a rare gravel prairie. The remains of a melting glacial ice sheet appear as eskers which are long narrow ridges of gravel deposited by a stream flowing in an ice-walled valley or tunnel.\n\nThis area is adjacent to the Shoe Factory Road Nature Preserve that is already being restored by volunteers who remove invasive species, collect seeds and plant native plants.\n\nThe entire Arthur L. Janura Preserve is a treasure of wild birds, animals, prairies and forests that give our village residents the peace and recreation needed for our busy lives.\n\nThe failure of a commercial and residential development back in 1965 has given us a wonderful opportunity to continue to protect our environment of the rare land and animals. That failure has become an unforeseen plus for Hoffman Estates.\n\nA special thank you to Jenny Whidden, Climate Change and Environmental Writer for the Daily Herald, who kindly helped with this article.\n\nPat Barch, Hoffman Estates Village Historian\n\nEagle2064@comcast.net\n\nPOPLAR CREEK’S 12TH SEASON: 1991\n\nThe 12th season of Poplar Creek was a definite mix of acts. From the big names of Michael Bolton and Jimmy Buffett to smaller acts like Hall & Oates and Ziggy Marley to comedy acts to dance performances to cartoon characters, there appeared to be something for everyone.\n\nThere were a total of 31 acts signed up–down from 38 the year before. According to a May 12 article written by Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, Poplar Creek and other area venues like the World Music Theatre and Alpine, were already concerned at the lack of talent at the beginning of the season. He reported that it was attributed to big scale acts like Bruce Springsteen and John Mellencamp who were in the midst of producing new albums, prices had gone up and there were too many venues for the area which diluted the market.\n\nInterestingly, the highest ticket prices for Poplar Creek were Julio Iglesias, Liza Minnelli and Mikhail Baryshnikov. They were all $32 or higher and did not include parking.\n\nA list of shows and their dates follows:\n\nJune 8 Dan Fogelberg\n\nJune 22 Chicago\n\nJune 23 Maxi Priest/Dennis Brown/Shinehead/Charlene Davis/Little Lenny/A Team Band/Andrew Tosh\n\nJune 30 Andrew Dice Clay\n\nJuly 5 & 6 Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band\n\nJuly 11 Julio Iglesias\n\nJuly 12 Sisters of Mercy/Warrior Soul/Public Enemy/Gang of Four\n\nJuly 18 Joe Cocker with Johnny Winter\n\nJuly 20 Bruce Hornsby & The Range/Roseanne Cash\n\nJuly 21 Liza Minnelli\n\nJuly 26 Willie Nelson/Waylon Jennings\n\nJuly 27 The Doobie Brothers/Joe Walsh\n\nJuly 28 Three Dog Night/Dave Mason/Robby Krieger/John Kay and Steppenwolf/Arlo Guthrie\n\nAugust 1 Tony! Toni!

Guns/Bang Tango\n\nAugust 17 Mikhail Baryshnikov & White Oak Dance Project\n\nAugust 18 Mike Reid/Mark Collie/Pam Tillis/Kevin Welch/Diamond Rio\n\nAugust 24 Sharon, Lois & Bram\n\nAugust 25 Stevie B\n\nAugust 30 David Spade/Dennis Miller/Steven Wright/Tom Kenny\n\nSeptember 1 Ziggy Marley/Crystal Waters/Queen Latifah\n\nSeptember 6 Chris Whitley/Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers\n\nSeptember 14 Oleta Adams/Michael Bolton\n\nSeptember 19 & 20 Rod Stewart\n\nStevie Nicks was touring a new album–Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks. Two weeks after he opened Poplar Creek, Dan Fogelberg recorded a live album at the Fox Theater in St. Louis called Dan Fogelberg Live: Greetings From The West. Jimmy Buffett was so popular that the second night was added. Joe Cocker released another studio album later that year called Night Calls. Some of the groups who played at Poplar Creek were still doing big things.\n\nDid any of you attend one or more of these shows? Or, did you work there during the season?\n\nHow many times did you go to a concert and pay to see the opening act more so than the featured act?\n\nLooking forward to your replies!\n\nJane Rozek\n\nLocal History Librarian\n\nSchaumburg Township District Library\n\njrozek@stdl.org\n\nPOPLAR CREEK’S 11TH SEASON: 1990\n\nIn 1990 the World Music Theatre in Tinley Park opened for their inaugural season and it could not be denied that the Poplar Creek Music Theatre felt the heat. This was also the year that Sears announced it had purchased the Poplar Creek site where had concerts and shows had been held since 1980.\n\nPoplar Creek held its own, though, with 38 acts but the number had declined from 60 the previous year.\n\nProbably the biggest concert of the year was Frank Sinatra. His tickets commanded a steep price of $50 and, apparently, that was not a problem because it sold out. And, to boot, the review by Howard Reich in the September 3 issue of the Chicago Tribune touted the concert as “hot and often sultry, though not without several relaxed, light-hearted moments.” Clearly, it was a night to remember for all of those who attended.\n\nOne of the more interesting shows was a three night stand of “Jesus Christ Superstar.” This was the 20th anniversary tour for this rock musical. There was one show a night and only pavilion seating was sold.\n\nThe much awaited show in pre-season advertising was New Kids On The Block. By this year they were one of the most popular shows on the touring circuit. The prior year they had hit it big with “I’ll Be Loving You (Forever) from their Hangin’ Tough album. The concert proved to be a huge one.\n\nThis is the list of shows that I could find based on mentions in the Chicago Tribune and the Daily Herald.

This column originally appeared in the May 2021 issue of the Hoffman Estates Citizen, the village’s newsletter. The column appears here, courtesy of the Village of Hoffman Estates.\n\nWith the arrival of spring, I began thinking about the beginning of outdoor fun and activities. A lot of the entertainment that our village has had has disappeared over the years.\n\nAs I was filing away some of my folders and looking for ideas for May, I came across the Production Kit for Poplar Creek Music Theatre. It contained Technical Information, Musical Rental/Repair, a Travel Guide for Car/Truck/Plane and other helpful information if you were planning on performing or being part of the audience. What I found interesting were the behind the scenes information about the music theater. In the Production Kit was a detailed floor plan for the stage.\n\nThe stage was 60 feet wide with a depth of 28’ 3”. It had a proscenium stage that was in front of the curtain that measured 20’ 4’’ deep by 56’ 6” wide.\n\nLighting was listed as follows:\n\n3 strong “Super Troupers” follow spotlights\n\n18 10” x 15” 2000w Leko ellipsoidal reflector spotlights\n\n12 6” x 16” 1000w Leko ellipsoidal reflector spotlights\n\n107 Par 64 (6 very narrow, 80 narrow, 18 medium, 18 wide lamps available. Roscolene gels)\n\n10 6’ R-40, 3 color strip lights\n\nThe sound systems, contracted to Stanal Sound, consisted of a permanently hung ring of three-way, tri-amplified sound speakers and sub-woofers around the stage designed for very even coverage. There’s more about the sound but this is getting too techie for me.\n\nThe large berms and walls that surrounded the music theater were to keep unwanted noise from disturbing our Barrington neighbors who sued to stop the construction of Poplar Creek with worries about sound, traffic, trash and disruption of their rural way of life. We know it was built in 1980 and ended its concerts in 1994, but why?\n\nThe owners of Poplar Creek Music Theater, Nederlander, felt there was too much competition and they invested in the World Music Theater that opened in 1990 in Tinley Park with slightly more seating, and they also owned Alpine Valley in East Troy Wisconsin.\n\nSo the Poplar Creek Music Theater, so loved by so many, closed and was torn down to make way for the Prairie Stone Business area. The land was purchased by Sears, Roebuck & Co. and now is the home to many manufacturers and corporate centers. Two of my favorite retailers in Prairie Stone are Cabela’s and Duluth Trading.\n\nRemember some of the greats that performed at Poplar Creek Music Theater like Johnny Cash in 1981, Neal Diamond in 1986 or the Beach Boys in 1989? Many of us still talk about our favorite performers.\n\nPat Barch, Village of Hoffman Estates’ Historian\n\neagle2064@comcast.net\n\nA POPLAR CREEK TICKET MYSTERY\n\nThis ticket from a Poplar Creek concert has caused a bit of a mystery.\n\nIn the blog post about the 1985 Poplar Creek season, it states that Squeeze appeared on September 6. But this ticket is clearly for a Tuesday, August 13 date.\n\nTo try and clear things up, I searched the Chicago Tribune and the Daily Herald once again to see if there were any articles mentioning a rescheduled date. There was nothing to be found in the Daily Herald but there was a mention in Phil Vettel’s “Ticket Booth” column in the May 31, 1985 issue of the Chicago Tribune.\n\nHe says, “Those of us who mourned the breakup of Squeeze have double good news today. First the band has reunited [personnel includes Jools Holland, Chris Difford, Glen Tillbrook, and Gilson Lavis] and second, the reunion tour is headed our way–August 13 at Poplar Creek, to be exact. Tickets, at $10 and $15 go on sale today at the Box Office or Ticketmaster.”\n\nSo, we are firmly established that the original concert date was August 13.\n\nSomewhere in between, though, the actual date was changed to September 6. There was no mention of this change in either newspaper between the time of the original announcement, and the month of August when the September 6th date began being hyped in various newspaper columns.\n\nIt is assumed that the group’s management and Poplar Creek changed the date after the tickets were issued by Ticketmaster. But, interestingly enough, the original ticket was used to enter the show.\n\nIn fact, the ticket holder who brought this conundrum to me is very familiar with music memorabilia and said,\n\n“If you look at the upper left corner you see the event code as PME0813. This is how the Ticketmaster computer system would identify a show. So this one stood for Poplar-Music-Evening Aug 13. Obviously, if there were two shows that day the afternoon show would be flagged as PMM0813. Then in the bottom left corner you can see the date that I made the purchase, 31st of May, (198)5.\n\nThe tickets must have gone on sale and then the date was almost immediately updated. I’ve seen some print ads online from the ‘85 season and they all show the Squeeze date in September. But none of the ads have the entry flagged as a rescheduled event.”\n\nMy questions to those of you who may have worked for Poplar Creek, or were familiar with Ticketmaster, are the following:\n\nHow early in the season did Poplar Creek begin issuing their tickets?\n\nWhen a date or performing act changed, how was the ticket holder notified of the change?\n\nWhy was a new ticket not issued IF the ticket holder was notified of the change? Answer: See below.\n\nOnce the date changed, did Poplar Creek begin selling new tickets with the new date? Answer: A reader of the blog responds, “Talked to a friend of mine who worked in the box office, if the date changed after tickets went on sale they kept the original event code, it was a common practice.”\n\nIf you can help with any of the questions it would be most appreciated. Leave a comment or send me an email and I’ll add the comment under my name. It would be nice to get to the bottom of this!\n\nJane Rozek\n\nLocal History Librarian\n\nSchaumburg Township District Library\n\njrozke@stdl.org\n\nPOPLAR CREEK’S 10TH SEASON: 1989\n\nEven though the concertgoers of July 29 didn’t know it, they were witnessing history. It was the last time Stevie Ray Vaughan performed at Poplar Creek Music Theater. The following year he died in a helicopter crash on August 27, 1990 after a concert at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in Wisconsin. According to his In Step Tour Wikipedia page, he was not scheduled to play Poplar Creek in 1990 and was actually bringing the next leg of his tour to Europe in September. If you saw that 1989 concert on July 29, let us know your memories.\n\nIt’s always interesting to note which solo acts appeared without a warmup band. Kenny G, Stevie Miller, Rod Stewart, Jackson Browne, Julie Andrews, Carole King, Bobby Brown, David Sanborn, Elvis Costello, Debbie Gibson, Diana Ross, Elton John, Neil Young and Stevie Nicks.\n\nMost of them were big acts who commanded the stage and remain ever popular. Julie Andrews and David Sanborn had been touring for a while during the summer and it was not their first times at Poplar Creek. And Debbie Gibson was hot that year. Her second album, Electric Youth was released earlier in the year and spent five weeks at Number 1 on the Top 200 Album list.\n\nPoplar Creek had 61 acts scheduled and it was their usual great variety. The interesting thing is they did not carry any comedy acts that year. It was all kinds of music from metal to pop to country to rock to classical. Who did you see that year? Was there anything unique about the concert that sticks with you to this day?

In the 1987 season there were 47 acts versus the 66 they were able to book for the ninth season in 1988.\n\nUnique to the theater this year were comedians like Sam Kinison, Jackie Mason and Gary Shandling. If any one of you went to these shows, it would be interesting to know how long their act was and how many warm up acts they had before the main event. Also, did the comedy translate well onto such a large, outdoor venue?\n\nThe season was supposed to jump start with Whitesnake, a British hard rock band. Unfortunately, they cancelled, but were able to reschedule a show on July 13.\n\nIt was almost, too, as if the organizers read my blog post regarding the 1987 season, and scheduled a few more female acts. There were eleven this year versus the six that performed the prior year.\n\nMay 20 Depeche Mode and OMD\n\nMay 28 Richard Marx with Henry Lee Summer\n\nMay 29 Robert Plant with Mission U.K.\n\nJune 4 Julio Iglesias\n\nJune 10-11 John Cougar Mellencamp\n\nJune 12 Jethro Tull\n\nJune 16 Sam Kinison\n\nJune 17 Chick Corea Electrick Band and Herbie Hancock and Headhunters II\n\nJune 18 INXS with Steel Pulse\n\nJune 24 Billy Ocean\n\nJune 25 Johnny & the Leisure Suits\n\nJune 26 Dirty Dancing with Bill Medley, Eric Carmen and the Dirty Dancing Band and Dancers\n\nJuly 1 Kool & the Gang\n\nJuly 3 Heart with Michael Bolton\n\nJuly 4 Elgin Symphony Orchestra\n\nJuly 6 Loverboy\n\nJuly 8 Squeeze with the Smithereens\n\nJuly 9 Steve Winwood with Johnny Clegg & Savuka\n\nJuly 10 Moody Blues\n\nJuly 11 Jackie Mason\n\nJuly 13 Whitesnake\n\nJuly 14 Bob Dylan with the Alarm\n\nJuly 15 Dan Fogelberg with the Magical Strings\n\nJuly 16 Jimmy Buffett & the Coral Reefer Band\n\nJuly 17 Aerosmith\n\nJuly 19 Belinda Carlisle\n\nJuly 20 Country Explosion: Shenandoah with Southern Pacific, Baillie & the Boys, SKB\n\nJuly 23 Earth Wind & Fire\n\nJuly 24 Gary Shandling\n\nJuly 27-28 Barry Manilow\n\nJuly 29 “70’s Superfest” with Bachman Turner Overdrive, the Guess Who and Rare Earth; Grand Funk’s Mark Farner and Dr. Hook\n\nJuly 30 Tiffany\n\nAugust 2 Earth Wind & Fire\n\nAugust 3 Gloria Estefan & the Miami Sound Machine\n\nAugust 4 James Taylor\n\nAugust 5 Temptations and the O’Jay’s\n\nAugust 6 Chicago\n\nAugust 7 Beach Boys with America\n\nAugust 8 Willie Nelson\n\nAugust 10 Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam\n\nAugust 11 Sting\n\nAugust 12 Kenny G and Stanley Jordan\n\nAugust 13 Kenny Loggins\n\nAugust 14 Huey Lewis & The News\n\nAugust 15 The Moody Blues\n\nAugust 16 Neil Young & the Blue Notes, Tracy Chapman\n\nAugust 17 Robert Palmer\n\nAugust 19 Darryl Hall and John Oates\n\nAugust 20 The Jets with Stacey Q and Jermaine Jackson\n\nAugust 21 Wynonna and Ashley Judd, Randy Travis, Tammy Wynette\n\nAugust 22 UB40\n\nAugust 23 Debbie Gibson\n\nAugust 24 Crosby Stills & Nash\n\nAugust 25 Tangerine Dream\n\nAugust 26 Hank Williams Jr.\n\nAugust 27-28 Linda Ronstadt\n\nSeptember 1 Pat Benatar with the Rhythm Corps\n\nSeptember 2 Stevie Ray Vaughan\n\nSeptember 3 Barbara Mandrell\n\nSeptember 4 Bruce Hornsby & The Range\n\nSeptember 3 Barbara Mandrell\n\nSeptember 9 Sade\n\nSeptember 10 Swatch Impact Tour with skateboard and freestyle “action sport” show\n\nSeptember 16-17 Elton John with Wet Wet Wet\n\nSeptember 18 Santana\n\nSeptember 24 Pat Benatar with the Rhythm Corps\n\nAnd I would be remiss if I did not mention that the only band that had been performing for the entire run of Poplar Creek’s existence continued their booking into 1988. The band? Still performing today? Why Jimmy Buffet and the Coral Reefer Band.\n\nHow many of these acts would you love to see perform again in all of their 1988 strength and glory? My choice, even though she was past her Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2 albums, would be Linda Ronstadt. You have to love powerful alto voices like hers.\n\nJane Rozek\n\nLocal History Librarian\n\nSchaumburg Township District Library\n\njrozek@stdl.org\n\nCredit for the photo of Gary Shandling is given to Wikipedia."
