Anything that is comedy related is part of the project. So let's get tagging. Gran2\n\nAs per Wikipedia procedure for dispute resolution I am asking any and all members of this project to add input on a dispute over deletion of Taglines for this film, which was added to the National Film Registry in 2005. The original tagline \"A Different Set of Jaws\" is also listed as one of the most memorable taglines in history along with others. I also have at least one other reference source, an article on \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show as Cultural Performance\" with mention on the cultural impact of the tagline \"Don't Dream It, Be It.\" Input is needed to resolve a current \"Edit War\" where an Editor keeps deleting without adding a better reason than he \"Does not believe they are notable\" with no further reference to back up the assertion. Thank you. --Amadscientist\n\nI have noticed that the Tamsin Greig article has had its peer review compeleted. Does that mean that article should still be included in the peer review section? ISD\n\nIf the peer review is over then, as no one can make further comments, it can be removed from here. Also on the subject of PRs, I could use some comments at Notting Hill's PR, as it currently has none. Also good work on QI by the way. Gran2\n\nI was wondering if we should tag articles of individual episodes. I'm asking because the article for The Simpsons episode You Only Move Twice is currently an candidate for featured article status, and there already several Simpsons episodes which are good articles.\n\nIf we tagged these however, we would have to tag all the episodes, and considering there are over 400 Simpsons episodes, that will take a lot of work. Not to mention tagging all the episodes for other comedies. ISD\n\nI don't see why not. Especially as about half of those GAs were done by me, and one of the FAs as well. Gran2\n\nNow that we have been given some descendent WikiProjects, should we still tag episodes to this WikiProjects? ISD\n\nI have occured a problem witht the article on Ian Stone. A user removed a section critising him. On closer examination, I believe the user to be Ian Stone himself, mainly due the user being called Iandstone.\n\nFirst of all, is a Wikipedian allowed to edit their own articles? Second, do you believe the criticism should be returned? ISD\n\nIts a basic policy that if someone has an article about themselves they are \"encouraged\" to not edit it. There's a list of Wikipedians with articles, but the only person I'd heard was Jimbo. To edit your article your article is one thing, to edit your article to remove critcism is not allowed. I suggest you talk to him as it seems he is the real deal. Also, if you can find other sources that say the same thing as the one there. That'll show that it wasn't just one source reporting it. Gran2\n\nThe Colbert Report is a Featured Article Candidate here. Since it's within the scope of this wikiproject, I thought anyone interested could take a look and support or oppose. Cheers, Jude.\n\nOh, just noticed it's on your front page under \"Candidates\". Sorry. Jude.\n\nDo you think we should add lists of Parent and Descendent WikiProjects? For those who don't know, Descendent WikiProjects are ones that may form part of a larger WikiProject (For example, The Simpsons WikiProject) and Parent WikiProjects are ones in which this WikiProject would form part of (For example, the Entertainment WikiProject). ISD\n\nThat sounds like a good idea. It may also help us find more articles to tag with WikiProject Comedy. Magkaz\n\nTrapped in the Closet (South Park), please voice your comments at Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Trapped in the Closet (South Park). Curt Wilhelm VonSavage .\n\nThank you to all who commented at the FAC. Trapped in the Closet (South Park), was successfully promoted to a Wikipedia:Featured Article.

Your feedback would be appreciated, at Wikipedia:Peer review/Lord of the Universe (documentary)/archive1.

There are currently still two articles for consideration. ISD (talk)\n\nPortal:The Simpsons is on Portal Peer Review. Your feedback/comments would be appreciated, at Wikipedia:Portal peer review/The Simpsons, before I eventually nominate the portal to be a Featured Portal Candidate. Thanks, Cirt (talk) .\n\nNational Lampoon magazine was extremely important to American humor in the 70s and even the early to mid 80s, but after that it ran out of steam, and the name ended up being sold to to companies who wanted to simply license the name or cash in on the associations any which way they could. I think it is wrong for information about the current company, National Lampoon Inc to be added on to the article about the original magazine and its directly related projects. In fact the stuff about the company read very much like an advertisement before I tweaked it a bit. Does anyone feel it would be appropriate to divide the article into two articles? Or is there anything else we can do to preserve the info about the \"real\" NatLamp from contamination with the more recent more phony stuff? Invertzoo (talk)\n\nCan I get anyone from the Comedy project to weigh in on this? Nation Lampoon Inc. has no connection whatsoever to the original. They bought the rights to the name is all. They are using the article as a ad for their own ventures. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nHey there, everybody! I've recently submitted Duck Soup for peer review in order to find out some better ways to improve the article's (and other Marx Brothers articles) quality. If anyone's interested in leaving feedback, you can go to the article's talk page and follow the link.

Cheers. --Kife\n\nOver the past months, TV episodes have been redirected by (to name a couple) TTN, Eusebeus and others. No centralized discussion has taken place, so I'm asking everyone who has been involved in this issue to voice their opinions here in this centralized spot, be they pro or anti.

Be there! :) Wrad (talk)\n\nI'm a new member to WP:Comedy and noticed a lot of Comedy-related articles are not tagged. Has it been considered to have a bot go through comedy categories/templates and tag articles? Either someone can request a bot to do it, or I can seek approval for my bot to tag some (I've done tagging for WP:SHIPS). I made up a list of comedy categories and templates and it looks like there's 25,000 articles that aren't tagged. -- pb30<talk>\n\nI think creating a bot would be a good idea. Let's see what we can do. ISD (talk)\n\nIf theres some consensus I can apply for this new task using my bot. -- pb30<talk>\n\nDoes anyone object if I split the National Lampoon article into two separate articles? One would be National Lampoon magazine which would be all of the original work, I would like to add a lot more to that one. The other would be National Lampoon Inc, which is a modern company that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original NL except that they bought the name. Please let me know. If I have not heard from anyone in a month I will make the change. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nMade the split this morning. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nJust wondered why he wasn't High importance. He'll be a good FA in my opinion, and the article (Terry Pratchett which is coming along) could use the push. He's the 2nd highest-selling novelist in UK (next to JK Rowling, who over-leapt him), and 7th in the US. He out-sold everyone in the UK in for the 90's. He's also been in the news after having been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and has finally allowed a couple of film adaptations to happen too (Raimi and Gilliam). Whatever the genre, he's singularly comedy too.--Matt Lewis (talk)\n\n-- Update: Portal:Comedy has recently become a Featured Portal.

Thanks to the efforts of folks from this project, for churning out such great high-quality material! Keep up the great work getting articles to Featured Quality Status ! Cirt (talk)\n\nThere has been some trouble recently on the article about Alan Davies, in relaiton to a fact that has been reference on it, and whether it should be kept or removed. I would like to some help in trying to reach a consensus over the issue please. The issue is being discussed on the article's talk page. Thanks. ISD (talk)\n\nI notice there needs to be a lot of work done at several articles over the Marx Brothers films. While pages like Duck Soup, Monkey Business, and A Night at the Opera are getting much needed boosts, others like A Day at the Races and Horse Feathers require expansion or clean up. Is there a Marxist expert, preferrably one of the Groucho variety, who could help give those articles the attention they deserve? Cinemaniac (talk • contribs • critique)\n\nWhile checking through WP:Project Actors and Filmmakers assessments, I noticed that this project has the priority rating for Charles Chaplin as a high priority, rather than a top priority. Since Chaplin is one of the 200 WP:Biography core subjects, that should probably imply that he is of top priority. Since I'm not a member of this project, I thought I'd bring it up here for consideration by those in the group who do the assessments. Thanks. Wildhartlivie (talk)\n\nCurrently, there are three featured list candidates that have not garnered enough responses to them, that fall under this WikiProject.

Redfarmer (talk)\n\nsee Talk:Running gag for more info. Basically, There used to be a list in the article. It was removed by consensus, and I have placed 1 or 2 examples into the article, only to have them removed. The article really needs examples, because of the insufficient context of the article, and i pleaded the case on the talk page, yet it is looking grim. The whole argument that 2 editors are making is that having examples would somehow be 'un-managable' because in the past, the list has gotten slightly out of hand.\n\nany opinions would be very welcome. - -[The Spooky One] | [t c r]\n\nCurrently, 587 of the articles assigned to this project, or 33.8%, are flagged for cleanup of some sort.

The new description is available at WP:ASSESS.\n\nThe new C-Class represents articles that are beyond the basic Start-Class, but which need additional references or cleanup to meet the standards for B-Class.\n\nThe criteria for B-Class have been tightened up with the addition of a rubric, and are now more in line with the stricter standards already used at some projects.\n\nA-Class article reviews will now need more than one person, as described here.\n\nEach WikiProject should already have a new C-Class category at Category:C-Class_articles. If your project elects not to use the new level, you can simply delete your WikiProject's C-Class category and clarify any amendments on your project's assessment/discussion pages. The bot is already finding and listing C-Class articles.\n\nPlease leave a message with us if you have any queries regarding the introduction of the revised scheme.

Media franchises' scope deals primarily with the coordination of articles within the hundreds if not thousands of media franchises which exist.

Now it's just become something I need to know lol:) I can remember it being done- for instance when a comedy villain or goth is walking along the road or into a church, or when a child's planning something evil.

The primary goal is to improve the quality of articles about South Park episodes, with the ultimate end goal of getting sets of episodes by season to Good Topic or even Featured Topic status.

Cirt (talk)\n\nThe infobox for comedians includes spots for \"influences\" and \"influenced by\", and these are often filled in but very seldom backed by citations. It seems to me that such statements are presumptuous and in clear violation of WP:BLP unless verifiable by sources which indicate the information comes from the subject him/herself (for example, an external interview with David Letterman in which he cites Johnny Carson as an influence). I plan to start doing some quick searches to try to find and document support for the obvious ones (such as Letterman/Carson) but will probably end up deleting quite a few, pending more in-depth work by others. I have taken a similar approach on some music articles with some success; however, I suspect that external articles on comedic influences are a bit harder to come by than musical influences. Any comments or thoughts welcomed. Jgm (talk)\n\nI've been in talks with a member of the Simpsons WikiProject about tagging episodes of The Simpsons.

Since August 2007, WikiProject Good Articles has been participating in GA sweeps. The process helps to ensure that articles that have passed a nomination before that date meet the GA criteria. After nearly two years, the running total has just passed the 50% mark. In order to expediate the reviewing, several changes have been made to the process. A new worklist has been created, detailing which articles are left to review. Instead of reviewing by topic, editors can consider picking and choosing whichever articles they are interested in.\n\nWe are always looking for new members to assist with reviewing the remaining articles, and since this project has GAs under its scope, it would be beneficial if any of its members could review a few articles (perhaps your project's articles). Your project's members are likely to be more knowledgeable about your topic GAs then an outside reviewer. As a result, reviewing your project's articles would improve the quality of the review in ensuring that the article meets your project's concerns on sourcing, content, and guidelines. However, members can also review any other article in the worklist to ensure it meets the GA criteria.\n\nIf any members are interested, please visit the GA sweeps page for further details and instructions in initiating a review. If you'd like to join the process, please add your name to the running total page. In addition, for every member that reviews 100 articles from the worklist or has a significant impact on the process, s/he will get an award when they reach that threshold. With ~1,300 articles left to review, we would appreciate any editors that could contribute in helping to uphold the quality of GAs. If you have any questions about the process, reviewing, or need help with a particular article, please contact me or OhanaUnited and we'll be happy to help. --Happy editing!

Should it be fully populated, i.e. should all the male comedians under Category:Comedians have Category:Male comedians added to their articles? Note that the category survived a CfD in January 2011. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nHello comedy people, I wonder if there is anyone at all who would be willing to help me create a bunch of stub articles about all the cool items (recordings, books etc) that National Lampoon (magazine) spun off from 1970 to 1998 (when the magazine and its associated company folded)? I am prepared to do a lot of the work, but it would be so much better to have someone else working as well. We already have stubs for a few of the more important items. Take a look at the red links on the template here, they all need to become stubs. Even if someone just wanted to do one, that would be sincerely welcomed! Invertzoo (talk) .\n\nI question your assertion that \"they all need to become stubs\". If they are sufficiently notable and there is something meaningful to write about them, then they should become stubs. They shouldn't automatically be turned into stubs just because there is a redlink in a template. DH85868993 (talk)\n\nOK, you are right of course. I apologize, that was just my being careless about how I expressed myself. If reliable mainstream references cannot be found to support the notability of the links, then of course those ones cannot become stubs, and cannot be links in a template. Do you or anyone else anyone have any interest in National Lampoon? Or does anyone feel like helping out despite not knowing much about it?

The blurb as it stands now is below:\n\nFuck is a 2005 American documentary film by director Steve Anderson, which argues that the word is key to discussions about freedom of speech and censorship. The film provides perspectives from art, linguistics, society and comedy. Linguist Reinhold Albert Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw, language professor Geoffrey Nunberg and Oxford English Dictionary editor Jesse Sheidlower explain the term's history and evolution. The film features the last interview of author Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide. It was first shown at the AFI Film Festival at ArcLight Hollywood; it has subsequently been released on DVD in America and in the UK and used as a resource on several university courses. The New York Times critic A. O. Scott called the film a battle between advocates of morality and supporters of freedom of expression, while other reviews criticized its length and repetitiveness. Law professor Christopher M. Fairman commented on the film's importance in his 2009 book on the same subject. The American Film Institute said, \"Ultimately, [it] is a movie about free speech ... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend.\" (Full article...)\n\nUcuchaBot (talk)\n\nAbove was posted to my user talk page, posting here as well.

These leaflets will be printed at Wikimania 2014, and the designs can be re-used in the future at other events and locations.\n\nThis is particularly aimed at highlighting less discoverable but successful projects, e.g:\n\n• Active Wikiprojects: Wikiproject Medicine, WikiProject Video Games, Wikiproject Film\n\n• Tech projects/Tools, which may be looking for either users or developers.\n\n• Less known major projects: Wikinews, Wikidata, Wikivoyage, etc.\n\n• Wiki Loves Parliaments, Wiki Loves Monuments, Wiki Loves ____\n\n• Wikimedia thematic organisations, Wikiwomen’s Collaborative, The Signpost\n\nFor more information or to sign up for one for your project, go to:\n\nProject leaflets\n\nAdikhajuria (talk)\n\nFor those interested, I am reviewing this article's GA status as I do not believe it meets the criteria.
