It was later popularized by xkcd.\n\nAs per Wikipedia:Getting to Philosophy:\n\nAs of May 26, 2011, 94.52% of all articles in Wikipedia lead eventually to the article Philosophy. The rest lead to an article with no wikilinks or with links to pages that do not exist, or get stuck in loops. There have been some theories on this phenomenon, with the most prevalent being the tendency for Wikipedia pages to move up a \"classification chain.\" According to this theory, the Wikipedia Manual of Style guidelines on how to write the lead section of an article recommend that the article should start by defining the topic of the article, so that the first link of each page will naturally take the reader into a broader subject, eventually ending in wide-reaching pages such as Mathematics, Science, Language, and of course, Philosophy, nicknamed the \"mother of all sciences\".\n\nHere is another analysis. And here is another.\n\nThe failure cases are split fairly evenly between closed loops not containing Philosophy and chains ending in dead-ends (articles that don't exist, or have been deleted).\n\nOne example loop is Waste management -> Waste collection -> Waste management."
