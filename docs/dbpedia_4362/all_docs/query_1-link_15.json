        "text": "When citing Wikipedia in-text, all you need is the article title. This is because Wikipedia is a collaborative website and there is no author or published date. The citation, which will be in parentheses, will have the title of the page or article in quotations. In place of the published date the common practice is to use n.d., which stands for no date.\n\nTo put an in-text citation for Wikipedia in APA, you would use the following format: (\"Title of article,\" n.d.)\n\nAn example would be:\n\n(\"World War II,\" n.d.)\n\nIf you want to direct your reader to a specific section of the Wikipedia article, you can include the paragraph number at the end of your citation. For example:\n\n(\"World War II,\" n.d., para. 5)"
