        "text": "He sneered, snarled and shrieked. Assaulting his audiences with insults – and parlaying his outrageous brand of humor into numerous television appearances and his own HBO special.\n\nOne evening soon after Sam Kinison’s tragic death in a senseless auto accident, the marquees of every nightclub on the Sunset Strip blazed with farewell messages in memory of the fun loving evangelist-turned comedian.\n\nSam Kinison lived for confrontation. No sweet words and kisses from this comic–more like up-the-volume shrieks and hisses to get his message out.\n\nIn the ’80s, Sam Kinison served as comedy’s raw nerve, dipping below the surface of civility to become the screaming embodiment of blind, bewildered rage.\n\nComedian Sam Kinison, who died in a head-on collision in 1992 said to no one in particular: “I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die.” But then there was a pause as if Kinison were listening to someone. Bill Kinison, Sam’s brother/manager and best friend shares the truth behind what really happened during…\n\nSam Kinison kicks off the night by playing with the band and gives his take on world issues before the cops show up. Aired 11/15/86\n\n“If you’ve seen him before, you’re gonna want to see him again. And if you haven’t seen him before, you’re gonna get a kick out of Bad Sam.”"
