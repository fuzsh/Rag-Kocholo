        "text": "Tag: Norm MacDonald\n\nThe Hidden Gems of Adam Sandler\n\nHave I mentioned how much The 90s were formative years for people my age?\n\nOf course I did, a lot of great things wound up happening in that decade that shaped a lot of mentalities and perceptions for years to come. One of those perceptions, however, that has altered significantly through the passing years is the idea that Adam Sandler can actually be considered “Funny” (*SHIELDS SELF FROM SHARP PROJECTILES*). Yes, I know, there’s still people out there that will follow him to the ends of the earth no matter what waste of movie/Netflix budgets he finds himself in; but for me personally, the Adam Sandler that I watched growing up peaked sometime around 2002 when he put out a juvenile animated movie and a super-serious “Plays against type” kind of movie simultaneously…and audiences were left epically confused—not unlike when Belushi did “Continental Divide”—Yeah, Sandler was growing up before our eyes, but it still felt like a bit of a whiplash to go from adolescent comedy king to potential Oscar bait in the blink of an eye. I’d like to think THAT is the reason why Sandler has made all the movies he’s made since 2002; overdoing it on the course correction…Which is unfortunate, because in all the other semi-serious movies (and even in some animated stuff) he’s done since then, there actually is a strong talent trying to emerge—more unfortunate, the audience that goes to see these movies are disappointed that Sandler doesn’t go “A-shabada-hooo!” like he did in his earlier efforts. I’ve paraphrased Mulaney before, and I’ll do it again when I say “People Change”, Just because one guy acts one way at one time in their lives doesn’t mean they HAVE TO be that way for the rest of their life…maybe that’s why Sandler’s tenure as a cast member remains somewhat endearing to many, yet they can’t seem to let that era go. And because some can’t let that go, seeing Sandler do anything BUT what made him famous in the first place is gonna leave us with a lot of conflicting feelings—which is why when he returns to host SNL this weekend, we’ll be watching him like a hawk just to see how much of the “Old” Sandler we’re gonna get out of him. Until then, though, let’s take a look at some of the stuff that made him great to begin with…\n\nIt’s been a little while since we did a “Hidden Gems” piece, so before we start, a quick recap on how this works:\n\n*Non-Recurring characters (though I will allow some “Unofficial” ones).\n\n*No sketches I’ve already covered elsewhere.\n\n*Main/Supporting roles only, I’ll allow “Bit Parts” in special circumstances.\n\n*Nothing that has already appeared on a “Best Of” show (Except for sketches that appear in Montages).\n\n*Chronological Order except for the last one.\n\nSABRA SHOPPING NETWORK (12/8/1990 – Pictured) & SABRA PRICE IS RIGHT (5/9/1992) – Although Sandler was technically NOT a cast member when this aired, this WAS the first sketch he ever appeared in; yet at the same time, he barely gets any words out, thus counting as a “Bit Part”—though he does have a little bit more to do in the sequel sketch 2 years later. One thing I will say about this, however, is that it probably answers more questions about “You Don’t Mess with the Zohan” than I ever wanted answered—That, and having worked in the city for about 5 years now, it’s both comforting and concerning to know that Some things NEVER change…except maybe the ethnicity pool of who exactly runs these supposed “High Tech” shops once in a while. More than likely, Robert Smigel wrote these, and there were a number of elements in this that carried over into the movie (I.e. the constantly “Going out of Business” store, Items sold with brand name “guts”, the pushy storekeepers of questionable ethnicity, etc.). So even though Sandler barely appears in both sketches, I felt it was necessary to bring up considering it took about 15 years to turn the concept into (what was once) a minor part of the last Good “adult” movie Sandler did before realizing he would probably do better playing a cartoon vampire.\n\nUPDATE: SANDLER’S FIRST COMMENTARY…as Himself (4/20/1991) – I have to emphasize that because Sandler actually made his Update debut months earlier as “Iraqi Pete”, but since that appears on his “Best Of” DVD, let’s get to know Sandler out of character (more or less). Here, he appears as Update’s Travel correspondent talking about a recent trip to Greece—the main joke of which was that he didn’t really get to see Greece, he just stayed in his Hotel room for the whole trip and bugged people while he was there–and you can tell that he was still trying to get what was left of the Rookie Jitters out of his system; in the few times he appeared on the air by that point, you knew he could do characters and bit parts; but this was a different circumstance altogether, clearly Sandler was nervous—and who wouldn’t be considering this was one of his first times with significant airtime—but at least the bit was charming enough for the audience to enjoy it. Not unlike somebody else on the show Currently who pretty much had similar shaken nerves his first few times out.\n\nKIDDIE METAL (11/2/1991) – By the time Sandler hit his 2nd year, the jitters were (mostly) gone, and we saw more of him in his natural element. Him doing a spot-on impression of GNR’s Axl Rose–along with an assist from (host) Kiefer Sutherland as Slash, and that night’s MG, Skid Row–was probably one of the better “early” examples of just how well Sandler catered to young audiences—though in this case, maybe a little Too young; but that’s part of what makes this sketch as fun to watch as it is ludicrous; and really one of those rare moments when the scene speaks for itself.\n\nUPDATE: THANKSGIVING…But NOT THAT ONE (11/23/1991) – Emphasis again; this was before his legendary “Turkey For You, Turkey for Me” song about a year later, This was more of a unique way for Sandler to be with his family on Thanksgiving without actually being there—and it’s actually kind of a creative bit, not quite Kaufmanesque, but unique enough that I can only imagine how creative it might’ve been if the Sandler family actually played the tape at the dinner—especially considering how dark the tone gets after a minute. I’ll even ignore the fact that the whole bit takes about 90 seconds to do, so I can only imagine the hell the Sandler family’s VCR would’ve went through playing the bit over and over—though I’m sure Adam would’ve bought the family a VCR that Christmas to make up for it. There was also a similar version of this bit that he did for Mothers’ Day the previous year; but let’s just call that version the “Beta Test”.\n\nTHE ENERGY BROTHERS (12/13/1991) & HITTING ON WOMEN (4/18/1992) – (Grrr, Getty!) I mentioned this before on the Season 20 list, but for many years there was a misconception that the great SNL Duo of the 90s were Chris Farley & David Spade; while that may have been true-ish for the two feature films they did together, on the show it was Farley & Sandler that had the stronger pairing—Zagat’s is a prime example of just how well they played off of each other, but so are these two pieces. One of which I cannot find, but probably for good reason since it would be a little hard to describe stage direction outside of “Farley & Sandler make a Giant Mess on the stage”; but at least I enjoyed just how “Out there” the idea was. The other sketch, that I Can show you, hits a little close to home—ESPECIALLY in this day & age when it seems all but impossible to talk to a beautiful woman without either spouting random words like Farley did, or incomprehensible gibberish like Sandler does; but at least I can empathize with both (Note to self, join Toastmasters). Sandler does give a pretty good punchline when trying to justify his mumbling; “Forget it, she’s a Bitch!”—The “She” being (host) Sharon Stone, who really doesn’t retaliate at all here and winds up acting the same way as the two once Jon Lovitz makes one of his customary early 90s cameos.\n\nCLUCKIN’ CHICKEN (11/21/1992) – I know what you’re thinking; Sandler’s not in this, is he? Well, it took me Years to realize this, but yes, he’s actually the voice of the Title Character—and that’s something that I can only attribute to a lot of voice processing, filtering and pitch shifting (It pays to work in audio recording for 15 years). Of course, I could completely wrong about this; but NBC has him listed in the Credits of the sketch, and I don’t see him as a background extra, so by that logic, he must be Clucky—the happiest victim of decapitation of all time (does that make him a Sadist or a Masochist?). I always enjoyed this one, not just for Sandler’s (?) Over the top performance as said chicken, but because of the pain-staking details that he’s describing into just how Fast Food Chicken is made. This is accented by a series of odd exclamations made during the process (Yow-ze-yow Dow! Choppity Chop! Ga-ga-ga-Gooing!). If this is in fact Sandler doing the voice here, then consider this sketch the first formative step into the much more lucrative world of voiceover.\n\nDOGS (12/5/1992) – For the longest time, I thought this was a Version 1.0 of the character Sandler would play in the movie “Airheads”—but to be fair, I didn’t become a fan of the show until a few years After this aired, so it’s an honest mistake. Moving on, this was probably one of the last/most recent times when the show tried to capture lightning in a bottle the way they did with a certain Other musical group that started out on the show that happened to involve cast members. The difference between this and The Blues Brothers, is that BB were meant to be taken a LOT more seriously than “Dogs” were—but Damn if I don’t give this one points for just how conceptual the idea was. Basically, you take whichever Seattle Based music group was popular at this time (take your pick from this list if you want), and then Brundlefly it with some Canine DNA, and that’s pretty much the main joke. Thing is, Sandler went above and beyond to make the bit work—everything from fake dog nipples to various uses of a fire hydrant, and even having a doggy mosh pit. Those who probably saw this the first time were epically confused, and not sure whether to think this was a sketch, a musical performance, conceptual art or a combination of the three; but to everybody else who “Got it”, this was actually a good-humored way to mock the Grunge trend of the time.\n\nAUDIENCE McGEE (1992-93) – Moving on to “Unofficial” characters, this one popped up from time to time throughout Season 18 to help break the 4th wall a little. The three most notable ones were the week after Sinead O’Connor tore the Pope a new one figuratively & literally, and Jan Hooks (as O’Connor) tried to make up for it—Sandler ultimately piping in saying “We don’t want you to Hate, we Want you to Love!”. Next, in the 2nd to last “It’s Pat” sketch (UNAVAILABLE), when just as Julia Sweeney was about to reveal all to (host) Harvey Keitel, Sandler—as only he could—whines and pleads not to reveal because “The fact that we don’t know is part of the Fun!” The other one I remember was in that season’s finale when Sandler would call out Kevin Nealon for not being (host) Kevin Kline; That time with Kline also happened to be a sentimental one since this would be the last time we would see Robert Smigel involved with the show for a while—who appears alongside Sandler as a 2nd Audience McGee at the end of the show, that footage is Also UNAVAILABLE–He would leave that summer to be head writer for the (then) new Late Night Conan O’Brien, only to come back 3 years later to give us “TV Funhouse”—also, I’m pretty sure it was Sandler’s voice here that convinced me that he’s the Cluckin’ Chicken.\n\nCAPTAIN JIM & PEDRO (1994) – Note to self, Talk about Tim Meadows at some point in the future. Anyway, By Season 19, recurring characters were in overdrive. So much so, that these particular sketches felt like all but a blatant response to just how many of them the show had at their disposal. So much so even further, that there was a slight running gag within the sketches that shamelessly advertise the characters via inter-sketch commercials; so hats off to them for at least trying to be meta…but that’s not what’s important here. As far as humor contributions go, these sketches remind me of a joke Family Guy made once about the decline of Sandler’s style of humor—I’d like to think of these sketches as the beginning of the Sandler we would eventually see in some of his “Lesser” films (I.e. Little Nicky or Jack & Jill, MAYBE a dash of “The Waterboy”—though I actually Like that one.); all Sandler has to do is say some sort of bizarre non-sequitur in an overly goofy voice while Meadows and whoever’s hosting plays the straight man, and you’ve got yourself a recurring character! And yes, Sandler does seem to have a penchant for playing people who act rather bizarrely with a voice to match it up, but the first few times he did characters like that, it was more of a goofy oddity. It’s not terrible by any means; but looking ahead in his career, these particular sketches seem like a Patient Zero.\n\nUPDATE: GIL GRAHAM & TWO GUYS FROM A RELIGIOUS CULT (1994) – As much as I wanted to avoid talking about Season 20 again, there was no denying that certain cast members were being overused—Farley, especially—Sandler was a close 2nd in terms of exposure, but at least he kept in the back of his head that the Update desk was a sanctuary of sorts where new characters could be born, tried and died. These two, for instance, only got to be on the show two times a piece; but I always remember finding them not sucky. Graham was Update’s music/concert reporter trying to appeal to Gen Xers by giving us the lowdown on concerts that he was unable to get in, and ultimately lame ones that he did get into, all the while speaking with a voice that makes me wonder why Owen Wilson never tried to sue Sandler; The character was OK, but two times were enough. Two guys from a religious cult, on the other hand, was a bit that—for whatever reason—my sister wrote the transcript down in one of her 8th grade Poetry notebooks, so the bit had to have done something right, even though we were getting more of the same “Sandler does a Wacky Voice” routine from others. Maybe it was the combination of Sandler, Spade AND Farley put together that makes this the more memorable piece,\n\nTONY VALLENCOURT ON THE BOSTON GARDEN (1995) – I wanted to include this one not necessarily for humor, but because of Sandler’s roots in New England—yeah, he spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn, but he was born & raised in New Hampshire first. The character itself had appeared here and there on the show before, but those were mostly in small doses. This is the first, last, and only time the mulleted southie took center stage; and while doing so, lamented on the soon to be demolished Boston Garden (Sidebar, that “Boston Teens” sketch with Matt Damon makes a lot more sense now—YOU’LL NEVAH BE THE GAHDEN!). This flew over my head when this first aired, largely because I’m a born and bred New Yorker—but thanks to living in New England for a couple of years…it still flies just slightly over my head, but at least some of the references Sandler makes hear are easier to grab. One other thing that kinda blows my mind about this sketch was that this was the episode’s Cold Open—which seems nuts now considering that piece of show real estate is largely reserved for making fun of whatever the week’s Top Story was; or sometimes something New York related. The fact that they would open the show doing something that’s a tip of the hat to a Boston Sports venue is either (1) a telltale sign of just how bad Season 20 truly was, (2) Sandler being as popular as he was wanting to give his native land a shout out at the top of the show, or (3) there just wasn’t anything noteworthy in the news that week. I suppose the people watching in New England got a kick out of it.\n\nUPDATE: GRANDMOTHER SONG (2/17/1996) – I already made a mention of this on my Twitter, but I think it bears repeating here, that Sandler has actually been back on the show previously—just not as a host. Of course, we all know about “That’s when you Break” from the 40th anniversary, but there was also “Chanukah Song III” from 2002 (covered here), and this performance—one of the few bright lights from one of the all-time worst SNL episodes Ever (*coughBRAINIACcough*). By this point in time, Sandler had been away from the show for about half a year; and for the most part, he seemed to be doing fine—IIRC, this appearance MAY have been to plug Happy Gilmore—the fact that he came back after being unceremoniously dumped by the show shows that perhaps water Can go under the bridge….though not deep enough so that it takes an ungodly amount of time between appearances. Nevertheless, Sandler gives us one last song at the desk (for now), and it’s an ode to his late grandmother—while it’s not quite as memorable as the songs he does for all the other holidays, you can tell that this one in particular was a little emotional for the San-man. That, and about 90% of his other Holiday songs are played frequently enough on clip shows that sometimes it’s better to look at the overlooked—considering the episode this came from, that’s an understatement.\n\nAnd my Favorite Hidden Gem of Adam Sandler is…\n\nSHORTY: THE GUY WHO CAN’T CROSS THE STREET (9/25/1993) – While we’re on the subject of Sandler’s songs in general; most SNL cast members have that one “Silver Bullet” that’ll get them some screen time; and more often than not, it takes place at the Update desk. Belushi had his rants, Gilda had Two memorable characters, Kaz used placards, Al Franken used his own name, etc. For Sandler, his songs—childishly simplistic as they may be—did the trick, and he was able to parlay some of that energy (especially one PARTICULAR song) into a career that has spanned roughly 30 years and counting. But on the flipside, juvenility should not define someone unless they want to stick to that path—in order to be truly multi-faceted, you gotta take risks sometimes, even if it’s something that plays against type (which might explain why people are still a little skittish to this day over some of Sandler’s Dramatic work). It is for those reasons that I think this is not only one of Sandler’s most underrated performance on the show, but I think it’s a shame that This particular short film didn’t make it to his Best of DVD. Incidentally, this happens to be one of the very Last films that Tom Schiller would produce for the show (but not the last thing he ever did); so that alone earns this one some extra points. But this is about Sandler, and the fact that while he can come off as a little goofy sometimes, you just know that deep down he’s just trying to prove his worth as a well-rounded performer. By all outward appearances, Sandler is pretty much doing a version of various other characters he’s played on the show to that point; but thanks to the added benefit of no dialogue, he actually manages to excel in this performance and at the same time prove to us that he is actually capable of something marginally nuanced—even though I sort of half-expected him to go “A-shabada-hooooo” at some point. I’m not saying that this type of performance should’ve been done in “Punch Drunk Love” or “Spanglish” or that movie where Sandler becomes a street bum after 9/11, but if the show was willing to let their cast members show off a different side of themselves once in a while; the least we can do is be open minded about it.\n\nNEXT WEEK: We take a look at some passing ships in the night, as we view a unique list of performers who were supposed to be on the show in one form or another; but for whatever reason, it wasn’t meant to be.\n\nThe SNLenium (Season 25)\n\nOK, bear with me, we’re gonna try something slightly different.\n\nThe next few things that I was going to cover were more Retro Reviews from the “early” years of my reviewing stuff; but in looking up which ones that I wanted to revisit, I noticed that a couple of them from December & May of various years had some poorly written, hastily put together lists of what I thought were the best sketches, shows, cast members, etc. of that given year. Looking over some of these lists, there were a number of entries that still held up, a number of opinions that verge on “What the Hell was I thinking”, and a number of other items that I have long since forgotten about because human brains start to shrink by the age of 30. So with that; we’re gonna look at some of these lists for the rest of the month and see if anything from them holds up; or if I continue to do what most moody teens do, and automatically hate everything they see regardless of what everybody else thinks and overall lack of education on my end. I should also note that there was also a list of “Worst” sketches during this time, but I’m not going to focus on that…at least not right now. Partly because 8 out of 10 of the sketches involved Cheri Oteri, and I want to keep this a Happy place (And I also want to save that side of the list for a special occasion); so we’re only focusing on the “Bests” today. WARNING: The ongoing reminder that I first wrote these lists long before I had even a sliver of a clue of what I was doing. Let’s start with what I said in December of 1999…\n\nThe Best sketches of 1999:\n\n10.Celebrity Jeopardy(10/23/: Norm McDonald)\n\n9.Hanz & Franz: where are they now?(10/16: Heather Graham)\n\n8.Taxicab Confessions(12/4: Christina Ricci)\n\n7.Who wants to eat?(12/4: Christina Ricci)\n\n6.Mango Undercover( 11/6: Dylan McDermott)\n\n5.Kim Plunket: “he is going to eat you”( 11/20: Jennifer Aniston)\n\n4.Mr. peepers monolouge(12/11 Danny DeVito)\n\n3.And so this is Chanukah( 12/4 Christina Ricci)\n\n2.A Mango Christmas( 12/11 Danny DeVito)\n\nAnd the winner is:\n\n1.He’s dead, he’s alive, he’s dead( 10/2: Jerry Seinfeld)\n\nwith honorable mention going to:\n\nPick 4 hospital(11/6/ Dylan McDermott)\n\nNow, let’s break this down into a set of sentences that makes sense…\n\nCELEBRITY JEOPARDY (10/23/1999) – A sketch that I have mentioned not once, but twice. On this 3rd mention, I should probably rank a little higher than 10—top 5 maybe. Time saver away! Read both links to see what I have to say—there’s really nothing new to add to it…except maybe, this would rank a little higher here as the season went on.\n\nHANS & FRANZ; WHERE ARE THEY NOW (10/16/1999 – No Video/Transcript) -From here on out, there’s going to be a number of sketches that I won’t be able to find either in video or text format, so I’m gonna have to rely on what little memory I have of certain things; This sketch in particular was actually meant to air on the show’s 25th Anniversary special. The sketch eventually aired in its entirety on the DVD/VHS release of the 25th Anniversary, because when it aired on Heather Graham’s episode, they only show about half of it while still giving us the gist of the story. And since the occasion for it has now come up, let’s talk a little about Hans & Franz………I never “Liked” Hans & Franz, but I never “Hated” them either—they were characters that had (at most) a joke and a half; they wanted to pump (*CLAP*) you up, and then they follow that up with insulting the audience by calling them various forms of “Girlie Men” and/or “Flabby”. And yet, somehow, through whatever alchemy was involved, the characters were big hits; granted, they did at least try to mix things up on occasion by having the duo appear outside of their gym environment, but they took the same shtick with them….which actually makes This piece a little more palatable to watch despite how any kind of “Where are they now” related media in any context feels kinda awkward and sad to watch. Nevertheless, we actually get to see something that barely sees the light of day on the show; Character Development. This piece tries to make up for lost time by making Carvey & Nealon’s characters a little more 3-dimensional (especially when it came to their downfall). There was also rumors that there were supposed to be additional “Where are they Now” segments to further mark the show’s 25 years, but nothing ever came to fruition. Regardless, It’s always nice to see Carvey, and I think this was also Nealon’s first appearance on the show since 1995, you can’t go wrong with nostalgia no matter how much pathos is thrown in.\n\nTAXICAB CONFESSIONS (12/4/1999) – Getting personal for a moment, Christina Ricci was my first celebrity crush (Janeane Garofalo actually came later). It was thanks to “Casper” that I realized “Hey! Maybe girls (Especially Brunettes/Dark Haired ones) aren’t as ‘Icky’ as I thought!”…that was when I was about 10 years old. Fast forward a few years later, and seeing that same girl become a woman AND spouting off TV Friendly sex stories was enough to make my voice change…That painfully personal detail aside, I think it’s safe to say that this sketch wound up on the list for all the WRONG reasons. Don’t get me wrong; watching it again, I’m able to appreciate how funny it was in certain places (especially all the times Tim Meadows keeps getting distracted). But I wouldn’t exactly call this one of the best of the year—though to its credit, this “Taxicab” was Miles better than the one George Clooney rode in (as Jay Leno of all people) circa 1995. Now if you’ll excuse me, I seem to have misplaced my copy of “Buffalo 66”…\n\nWHO WANT’S TO EAT? (12/4/1999) – Speaking of my pre-teen crush, she appears in this sketch that I’ve also already covered—the details of which you can find out about on the same link I pasted on the “Celebrity Jeopardy” entry. One thing I will add, this was when “Millionaire” was a white hot phenomenon for the ABC Network, so parodies of it seemed like an inevitability. This one beats all the others, partly because nobody expected THAT kind of twist in the format…and that’s a good thing, because we don’t want to see the same thing happen every time (no matter how questionable playing for food can be). It’s a Solid sketch and it still holds up, moving on…\n\nMANGO UNDERCOVER (11/6/1999) – (*No Video/Transcript, but Thanks to The Wicker Breaker for the pic*)\n\n…………………(*TAKES DEEP BREATH*)………………(*TAKES AN EVEN DEEPER BREATH*)………………….Well folks, I can’t escape this anymore……….It’s time to talk about the character that, for years, was the bane of many an SNL fan’s existence………It’s time to talk about……………MANGO (What? You thought I was gonna link you to that “Everything but the Girl” song? Please). Yes, Chris Kattan’s male stripper with a high-pitched James Bond villain’s accent was as much memorable as it was excruciating to watch sometimes; and this is coming from someone who was a fan of Urkel growing up. It called a number of things into question like “Why is this funny?” or “Why are we seeing this week after week?” or “Is Chris Kattan trying to tell us something?” In retrospect, the character should not have been as insanely popular as it was, but it was. However, Given the benefit of OVERWHELMING doubt, it has been many years since I’ve actually seen a Mango sketch (whether for review purposes or for leisure), so perhaps my feelings could change a little—Hell, I put this in my “Best” list for SOME reason, right? After all, despite there being one main joke every time (Men go after Mango, they’re swayed by his Charm, Mango then gives a Monologue about why they Can’t have-a-the-Mango, process repeats), thank merciful GOD they mixed up the formula once they realized just how one-note these sketches could’ve been. That being said, The Mango sketches…………………………(*TAKES AN EVEN DEEPER BREATH*)……………………were OK, with a Strong emphasis on “Were”…sorry to disappoint some of you; but to be fair, they were ONLY good to a point—that point being complete and total overexposure by the time this episode aired. Sure, the sketches invoked just about every Not!Gay stereotype you could think of in the late 90s, but it was the late 90s—we didn’t know better back then. Chances are, if the character was rebooted in this day and age (and preferably with someone younger and talented playing it), it would probably fit in better as a contestant on RuPaul’s Drag Race. So you got that everybody, I don’t hate Mango…or at least I don’t hate it as much as I used to—Once again, in the words of St. John of Mulaney, “People Change”. There were actually a few Good episodes; Such is the case here, when Mango is the target of a Would-be assassin who shoots him in the butt. It is up to an undercover cop played by host Dylan McDermott (NOT Dermott Mulroney) to help find Mango’s assailant—in order to accomplish that, McDermott must Become Mango thanks to an 80s training montage—and for the most part, this actually WAS a clever deviation from the default…which is More than I can say about other recurring pieces in passing years. This ultimately leads to a punchline that may either be painfully outdated or scarily timeless, depending on which side you’re on politically. In spite of Mango pissing a lot of us off sometimes, at least this edition was one of the few chances where the writers realized “Let’s give the audience a LITTLE Credit”. Would I call this one of the best of Season 25? Not so much; but again, the character had to have been popular for SOME reason in order for it to appear every few weeks.\n\nKIM PLUNKET FOR ISLAND PRESIDENT (11/20/1999 – No Video/Transcript, or even a photo–this is about as close as I could get to how he looked in the sketch) – This was actually part 2 of a runner sketch; the first involving the unheralded Chris Parnell. This one—with Ferrell at his absurdist peak—stood out as the stronger of the two. It angers me that there’s no video of Ferrell’s performance floating around, because I VIVIDLY remember this as probably the best example of him acting like a “we the jury find the defendant” crazy person since the Lux 420SL commercial parody of ’96. Using what little information I can recall about the sketch (Thanks again, Wicker Breaker), Ferrell goes insane while running for Island President thanks to drinking seawater that claims to give him superpowers. I also recall Ferrell barking (yes, barking) rather ferociously while promising the viewers (in his head, presumably) that he will eat everybody who votes for him……………normally I would question the hell out of this; but then again, this seems like a role tailor-made for Ferrell to play.\n\nMONOLOGUE (12/11/1999) – Before we get to Kattan’s other Magnum Opus of Annoyance, three minor Nitpicks that have always bothered me here. First, Don Pardo screwed up in the credits when this originally aired; accidentally crediting the SNL Band as R.E.M., but having one mistake every 25 or so years is more “Odd” than negative. Second, the new Millennium actually Started in 2001, not 2000—because there was never a “Year Zero” AD or BCE; so DeVito proclaiming he was the “Last Person in the Millennium” to host is kinda awkward—“Century” would’ve been more accurate, and that would make Lucy Liu one year later the OFFICIAL “Last host of the Millennium” (I guess people were more excited to see the odometer turn over). Third, DeVito mentions that this is his 5th time hosting the show—double checking things for a second, he hosted in ’82, ’83, ’87, ’88, ’93 & ’99, which would technically make him a 6-Time host, BUT that time in ’83 was when he co-hosted with wife Rhea Pearlman. With that kind of logic; does this mean that when Tina Fey & Amy Poehler co-hosted a few years ago, they each hosted half a time? They must’ve since they both won Half an Emmy for their efforts. Anyway, for all intents and purposes, let’s just say that this is DeVito’s 5th SOLO time, so he’s long since earned his 5-timers smoking jacket. Now that we got that out of the way, let’s talk about “Mr. Peepers”; a character that was—surprisingly—one of the few Kattan characters that didn’t suck, but I would always still cringe watching whenever he would spit food—particularly in other people’s mouths. I do give this one credit for being one of the rare times (or at least “Rare” in this day and age) when a character appears in the monologue; and despite all the apple play, you gotta give Kattan all the credit in the world for the physical humor…Having said that, This would not make the “Best” list today; Peepers, not unlike Mango, was on far too frequently on the show back then. In hindsight, putting this (or Mango) on a “Best Of” list of any kind would be like recommending Wendy’s for a Zagat’s guide.\n\nAND SO THIS IS CHANUKAH (12/4/1999) – I mentioned a time or two before that I was born & raised Jewish (For the record, Mom was a catholic who converted for my father’s family), so seeing this sketch was not only a breath of fresh air, but it was also a welcome relief from watching Adam Sandler’s Chanukah song over and over again for 5 years in a row; I was looking for something different, and this was certainly that; An All-star impression showcase where Gentile performers take a Kosher spin on the similarly titled Christmas special “And so This is Christmas” where the stars of the day added a layer of Gefilte Fish to their existing songs. Among the highlights; Tracy Morgan as Lou Bega (and it wouldn’t be the Last time he would do that), Kattan in his natural spazzing element as Ricky Martin, Molly Shannon doing her Tori Amos/“Oil Spill” thing before Megan Mulally ever did, Fallon & Parnell re-enacting the infamous Bowie/Bing duet, all of which was in good fun……………Until the pop divas came; Ricci as Britney Spears, Ana Gastyer with her reliable Celine Dion, and human Tsetse Fly Cheri Oteri attempting to do Mariah Carey. This sketch actually attracted MORE controversy than “Who wants to Eat” thanks to a couple of ill-spoken stereotypes; Ricci/Spears saying the Jews killed Jesus, while Gastyer/Celine invokes the old “Jews run the movie studios and banks” cliché (Oteri, amazingly, steps out of harm’s way for the segment just commenting on her booty). I guess when one is 15 as they watch something for the first time, they fail to read in between the lines. Those blemishes aside, it doesn’t change the fact that the rest of the sketch is still entertaining—I sure as hell wouldn’t rank this at #3 today thanks to an increasingly PC society, but it’s still an interesting time capsule of the era.\n\nA MANGO CHRISTMAS (12/11/1999) – (No Video/Transcript, but Thanks again for the pic, Wicker Breaker!) See #6, but add Michael Stipe as a Christmas Fairy, a surprisingly good Jimmy Stewart impression from Fallon, and perhaps most importantly, once again…character development. The character had been on the air for a little over 2 years at this point, and there was very little that we knew about him aside from him constantly teasing his potential suitors (as well as the fact that he’s a happily married family man…you heard me). But now we get a look inside his childhood family, as well as his father’s past along a similar path—a thankless job from Danny DeVito. One joke from this episode that stuck out the most for me was the fact that EVERYBODY in Mango’s family wore the short glitter shorts no matter what kind of person they were—especially Ferrell’s small role as Mango’s big shot executive brother. Credit where credit’s due, the character continued to evolve after this appearance; which is far more than I can say for any other recurring character before or since with rare exceptions. Again, I wouldn’t put this on any top 10 despite how “Feel good” this piece turned out to be, but at least it was still a deviation from the default.\n\n1.THUG HOSPITAL (10/2/1999) – Still another massive blooper I’ve long forgotten about; and quite honestly, one that should’ve made the main list…but we’ll get to that. First of all, let’s revel in the fact that Will Ferrell and Jerry Seinfeld are getting to play off of each other for the first and only time not counting his appearance on “Comedians in Cars…”(Yeah, they do appear in other sketches together in this episode, but this one felt more like a direct team up). The premise is simple; Ferrell is a crime goon trying to get Seinfeld to talk about……something…I forget. Ferrell and his co-goons then beat the shit out of Seinfeld to try to get info out of him, only to realize that they’re beating him so unconscious that he needs to be revived with hospital equipment that they just happen to have nearby. The process repeats multiple times until we reach the climax of the sketch where Ferrell keeps punching and reviving Seinfeld to the point where even his co-goons wonder what the point is. It’s during all these constant beatdowns/revivals where we get our blooper; Seinfeld just couldn’t keep it together in the final minute—that one moment alone almost makes you forget to ask why the thugs keep beating/reviving him in the first place. What makes this the most surprising to me was the fact that this was the last sketch of the night; and historically speaking, the last sketch of the night brings things to a screeching halt 99.99% of the time—this was one of the rare exceptions to the rule, and all thanks to Seinfeld showing us that even the most professional of Comedians can break down too.\n\nHONORABLE MENTION:\n\nPICK 4 HOSPTIAL (11/6/1999) – Back to Derbel McDillett for a second, this piece was as much unique as it was cheesy. The idea that Lottery drawings are low rated as Ferrell states at the beginning, however, is probably the most laughable part (*MINI TANGENT*); working in various forms of media for a while, I can tell you from firsthand experience that not only do people watch lottery drawings, it’s probably THE #1 Reason why Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy and/or Family Feud are still popular to this day considering most cities air the drawings in between commercial breaks during that hour. To paraphrase Tom Bergeron in his memoirs, “Every Dreamer in the World watches the Lottery”, so naturally no matter how “Boring” a drawing can be, they’re still gonna flock to their TVs just to see if they’re gonna win Big Bucks…of course, this was long before the internet got a little more sophisticated and people could check their winning numbers online, but hopefully you get the drift (*TANGENT OVER*). That being said, I empathize with what’s going on here; since time and memorium, gimmicks get people to tune in to things—even if it means turning said lotto drawings into an episode of General Hosptial. I’ll give it points for going over the top like any other soap opera, but the gimmick does wear thin after a while.\n\nLooking back, I’d say 5 of the sketches would remain on the list, but not in their original positions (Jeopardy, Eat, Plunkett, Chanukah & Thugs). Other sketches I probably would’ve added in hindsight that I’ve already mentioned elsewhere:\n\nDEVIL CAN’T WRITE NO LOVE SONG (See “Scary” sketches list)\n\nJAVIS HOME SECURITY (See “Goes Commercial” section, August 2016)\n\nLOU GEHRIG (See “Norm ‘99” review via #10 on the list)\n\nSEINFELD AT OZ (See “TV Parodies” list)\n\nSince the archives show that I actually didn’t write ANY list for the end of this season (or I might have, but 15 year old me had yet to fully figure out the internet back then), NEXT WEEK, we’re gonna jump ahead and take a look at what I wrote mid-way through Season 26.\n\nMM: Notorious S.N.L – The “F” Word\n\nThe F-Word.\n\nOh, sure, I can say “Fuck” in typed form because this is (1) not exactly one of the more popular destinations on the internet, or (2) this isn’t a mass-read publication like certain “Failing” newspapers/magazines which do have higher standards—But that’s print. Television has its own set of rules when it comes to both this, and (apparently) 6 other words you can’t say unless you’re one of the premium cable channels—though they have at least allowed “Shit” on basic cable in recent years. But that’s over there; on Network television, however, they’re still stuck in the stone age. To this day, the word “Fuck” all but grinds everything to a halt, especially on Live TV—except in some cases where you’re allowed to because you happen to have the TV-MA symbol on your show. SNL since day one (or at least since they introduced TV ratings) may be for Mature audiences, but also commercially sponsored ones. If people get too carried away, kiss the sponsors and the ratings good bye…supposedly……as you can see below, not only has the F-Word been uttered a number of times on the show, but the show itself has managed to soldier on in spite of it…\n\nNow then, this list is gonna be judged slightly differently than the others. Mojo ranks the list based on how “Impactful” the F-Bomb occurrence was, which is fair; but based on some of the entries, the question becomes whether the impact is as big as they say it is. At the same time, there’s going to be a couple of times where enunciation is going to come into play (I.e. Did they ACTUALLY say the F-Word, or just enough of it so that people would THINK the person said it?). So with that, beware of Gray areas…also, apologies in advance for using the “Censored” versions of some of these sketches—they were all I could find…\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON IN “WUWT” (12/15/2012) – He is perhaps the all-time king of the F-Bombs, but he also hosted the show once in 1998; so when I first saw this, I thought he would at least be able to restrain himself…But this is Sam Jackson we’re talking about, it probably would’ve been more controversial if he DIDN’T drop the bomb……………………………OR DID HE?! Apparently, Jackson didn’t quite say the FULL “Fuck”, but rather (to some, anyway) he let out a “FUH”. I have searched high and low for a high quality and uncensored version of this moment; the closest I could find was This one, and even there it sounded like “FUH” to me, so it’s going to be debatable for some time to come. Jackson DID say “Bullshit” shortly afterward, however, but as Cable has shown us over the years, we’re pretty much desensitized to that word’s use. Further, I was about to award the point in our favor because it wasn’t really an “Impactful” moment like the other ones you will see; but since Mojo & I are equally on the fence about it (not to mention Kenan’s classic “That costs Money” ad lib), chalk one for the neutrals…\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nAEROSMITH – MONKEY ON MY BACK (2/17/1990) – This was a hard clip to find—as you can see (if you click on it), the host of the page hails from the soon-to-be-next location of the White House. To make matters tougher, this comes from a Comedy Central rerun of the show back when Comedy Central used to run the show; and sure enough, the (supposed) F-Bomb was muted. I say “Supposed” because there are some who believe to this day that Steven Tyler was actually saying “Funky” instead of “Fuckin’” because what other words can rhyme with “Monkey”? Tough call, but unless somebody out there has crystal clear broadcast quality audio of the performance and can therefore Prove that Tyler did indeed drop the bomb, I’ll be more than happy to change my mind. But until then…\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 2\n\nMORRIS DAY & THE TIME (10/20/1990) – As a rule, I often (if not most of the time) fast forward past the Musical Guests unless it’s somebody I want to watch. So I hope you can forgive me when I say……….Who??? Nevermind the fact that I was only 5 years old when this show aired; even when I caught the episode in reruns years later, I still had no idea who Morris Day was. I’ve heard of Mikey Day, Otis Day, Willie Day, Arbor Day, etc. Never Morris Day and/or The Time; so this might be a little lost on me. But still, we press on. This entry is probably one of the more fleeting expletives; and all because Mr. Day wanted Ribs instead of Chicken; or as he puts it “Where the Fuck did this Chicken come from? I thought I ordered Ribs!” (a line which, BTW appears Nowhere in the album version of “Chocolate”, this might’ve been just for the show) While I couldn’t find an uncensored version of the clip, there’s no doubt that he said it on the Mojo clip (I can still read lips); but as to it being “Impactful”, that’s where Mojo misses the mark. Sure, Day never came back, but I think it just might’ve been because his career ran out of gas, the F-Bomb would have nothing to do with it.\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 1\n\nPUSH: 2\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/215908538\n\nPRINCE………I THINK? (2/21/1981) – Speaking of things that are Morris Day related, Another highly debatable one; in fact, after watching this one with ears wide open, I have a feeling his Royal Badness might’ve pulled a Sam Jackson, nevermind that this happened a good 30 years before that happened. Just my luck, this was a censored version we’re looking at, because the alleged infraction happened just as the song ended cold. Even with the power of Lip Reading, it’s hard to tell through grainy 80s era video whether he actually swore or not—I know he says “Frickin’” earlier in the song, but that’s about as far as it goes. As is the case with Aerosmith, if any of my fellow SNL superfans out there can clarify, I’m more than willing to change the score. As for whether the moment had any “Impact”, (1) He’s Fuckin’ Prince, he could practically get away with anything—intentional or otherwise, and (2) His [supposed] F-Bomb paled SHARPLY in comparison to another one that happened the same night……….\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 1\n\nPUSH: 3\n\nCHARLES ROCKET (2/21/1981) – Now this one pisses me off…Rocket only came in 6th…………Sixth…………SIXTH?!?!?!? Say it with me, Audience (*CLICK*). I’m not going to waste too much time on this because lord knows I haven’t already done so years ago; but this entry position is totally offensive to me as an SNL fan. As I’ve said before, if it weren’t for Charlie’s F-Bomb, there would NEVER have been a need for sweeping changes, Dick Ebersol wouldn’t’ve come in to save the day, the show would’ve died a forgettable death, Eddie Murphy would never have a (decent) career, and “Fridays” would then become so popular by default that Larry David would never create “Seinfeld”—among other “Butterfly effect” theories. Charles Rocket is as much a sacrificial lamb as he is an unsung hero to the show regardless of how “Bad” the action was; and it probably goes beyond the realm of hyperbole (and perhaps good taste) to say that he Literally and Figuratively Died for the Show’s sins! Sixth Place??? Give me a God Damned Break, Mojo!\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 3\n\nSAM ROCKWELL (1/13/2018) – This is not only a fairly recent one, but it’s also one of the few I actually saw Live. You would think that with the moment being so recent, it’s “Impactful” nature would be minimal considering how loose TV Networks are with language today…But what Mojo forgot to mention was that this was the same episode where “Update” made more than a fair share of comments about the Sunkist Tumor’s “Black Nations are Shitholes” remarks, complete with actual use of the word “Shit” on the air. So, perhaps Lorne was feeling generous in writing several checks to Ajit Pai that week; thus leading to an otherwise freewheeling show—one that didn’t hurt Rockwell’s Oscar chances whatsoever. So, I guess you could say the “Impact” here was that everybody in 8H loosened up a little once Rockwell let loose; which ultimately led to a far more enjoyable show than most hoped. Funny postscript to this article, though; Some of my readers might know that I run a Twitter page devoted to Television; and during the last season, I started doing Live Tweets of the show. When Rockwell’s gaffe happened, a lot of people felt the urge to chime in—myself included. So much so, that the following Tweet remains the one with the most “Impact” in my feed’s short history, clocking in at over 40,000 online impressions (and counting)……\n\n……just thought you’d like to know.\n\nMOJO: 1\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 3\n\nNORM’S “FAREWELL PERFORMANCE” (4/12/1997) – This is gonna sound embarrassing to admit as an SNL fan, but I was about halfway through my 3rd year of watching the show regularly, and (no pun intended) I SWORE I Never heard this happening Live—Don’t get me wrong, I HAVE heard the uncut version since then, but chalk it up to being Too “Young & Innocent” to have even noticed anything in the first place. Nobody watching the show seemed to notice—or at least, Care—when the moment happened, and Norm was never penalized for doing so. In fact, he did what only a small number of the people on this list did; he made lemons out of Lemonade and made fun of himself in the process. Not just calling it his Farewell Performance, but also using one of his “Note To Self” gags to further dig the hole; topped off with “Maybe We’ll see you Next Week”. I’d also be remiss if I didn’t paraphrase one of his jokes; To recap; Swearing on TV = Legal. Making fun of a suspected murderer/network executive’s buddy = Illegal. I was going to award the point to us because it didn’t really have an “Impact”; but considering Norm owned up to it, it cancels things out.\n\nMOJO: 1\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 4\n\nJENNY SLATE – BIKER CHICK CHAT (9/25/2009) – I mentioned her and her incident many moons ago; and while it remains a rare feat to drop the bomb on your Very First episode; it’s an even rarer one when one’s career actually manages to make an upswing after said incident happens. Granted, Slate is not quite a “Star” just yet, but the fact that she hasn’t completely gone away since is an encouraging sign. So you know what, I’m gonna say that her accidental “Fuck” empowered her…even if the most high profile thing she’s doing these days is voicing on “Big Mouth”.\n\nMOJO: 2\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 4\n\nPAUL SHAFFER’S FLOGGING (3/15/1980) – Mentioned this one a long time ago too; and for what it’s worth, this particular F-Bomb (the show’s first) should’ve had a bigger impact than advertised. But because this was still the Original Cast—or what was left of it—the show developed a certain level of clout that all but allowed them to pretty much get away with it; which could also be said for why Norm’s slip was forgiven, but Rocket & Slate’s were not. Shaffer’s F-Bomb didn’t make any headlines, and was (at best) a blurb in his recent autobiography, but the world didn’t come crashing down because of it.\n\nMOJO: 3\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 4\n\nKRISTEN STEWART (2/12/2017) – (*SIGH*) Look Mojo, I know you want to appeal to the “Hip” crowd and all—as internet videos tend to do—but when you say at the top of your video that you are scoring these moments based on the “Impact” they had on both the show and the audience watching, you might need to re-study some history books. With THIS Logic, you might as well say George Washington Crossing the Delaware is less significant than (for instance) Barry Bonds hitting his record breaking home run while juiced. Just because something happens that’s “recent” doesn’t mean it will be memorable right away. You need to give the audience time to absorb it before making a judgement call like this. I’m not denying that Stewart casually letting the F slip was a surprising moment, or even a shocking moment—I’ll even give her extra credit for the improved quip that she’ll never come back. But You, Mojo, are taking it upon yourselves to say that this was more significant that Rocket, Shaffer or (to an extent) even Slate’s gaffes COMBINED. To which I can only say, Seriously? The Chick from Twilight? Screw You, Mojo (either that or you accidentally got your #6 Pick reversed, at least that would’ve been a forgivable mistake).\n\nFINAL SCORE (pending any changes):\n\nMOJO: 3\n\nBLOG: 3\n\nPUSH: 4\n\nNot gonna lie, a Rough list to go through. Even if controversy is in the eye of the beholder, there are still times when you have to get it right, #1 & 6, especially. Thankfully, though, this is the last of the “Controversial” lists we’ll be looking at for a while; and the next list we’ll look at will be more of a “Compare & Contrast” involving one of my own Previous lists.\n\nThat said, get ready to get your hands back on those buzzers…\n\nMM: Notorious S.N.L. – The ‘Red Flag’ Moments\n\nIt’s time once again for the C-Word………Not that one, though that would actually be an interesting first for the show—and I think the last possible Taboo they could break on network television. Anyway, It’s time now for moments on the show where lines were crossed and envelopes were pushed (in a “Bad” way)…\n\nNow, like I said a couple of weeks ago when covering infamous Monologues, Controversy is all in the eye of the beholder. Not everybody is going to react the same way to the same things, and what could be offensive to some might be water off a duck’s back to others—to say nothing of the fact that enough time may have passed so that what was once controversial is now considered tame by today’s standards (depending on how recent some of these entries are). That being said, I’m going to consider these entries based on the controversy they stirred When they Aired, and ONLY when they aired. Of course, if I actually found the moment more “funny” than “controversial”, we’ve got grounds for neutrality. Also, they say “Whether the joke is funny is irrelevant”; while I will TRY to keep that in mind, but I’m not 100% guaranteeing it on ALL of the entries.\n\nTHE POISONED CARROT’S TWITTER DUMPS (12/3/2016) – And we begin with a “Too Easy”, especially considering that he’s still actively President whether we like it or not. Naturally, with someone of a high profile still in the news, of course there’s gonna be controversy surrounding said party……………to a point. After a while, fatigue sets in, and the constant 280 character ranting becomes as common as going to the bathroom each morning; so eventually, we become desensitized over it. If/when he finally does leave office, however, these tweets will probably be seen less as “Controversial”, and more as fodder for the Daily Show’s next book or Exhibit A in one man’s competency/treason trial—God Willing.\n\nMOJO: 1\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nADRIEN BRODY’S JAMAICAN “SALUTE” (5/10/2003) – Quick Program note before we go any further; among the SNL lists Mojo has done, they did one that points out People who have been “Banned” from the show for whatever reason. You may recall last Christmas that thanks to an avid reader, I clearly did not know the difference between a “Ban” or “Not being asked to return” or “Waiting a long time to come back”, and that being “Banned” from the show is about as loose a term as you can get. I mention this because (1) I am purposely NOT going to cover that list because I don’t want to screw myself up again, and (2) because of the subject of this entry, Mr. Brody—who on the “Banned” list clocks in at #6–also, yes, I know, the screencap above is ENTIRELY misleading…not my fault, blame the Youtuber (though check out the rest of his channel while you can, he’s got a LOT of SNL Musical performances I forgot ever happened). When I first saw Brody embrace his inner-Rasta while introducing MG Sean Paul, I thought it was more “Odd” than “Offensive”—then again, I wasn’t quite an adult yet when I saw this, so I had no idea how poorly executed Brody’s performance would be among others—and the consensus on the video comments seem to agree that his heart was in the right place, just executed poorly. It doesn’t escape the fact that the—shall we say—“Homage” still rubbed people the wrong way; but surprisingly, not the ones you think. TV Rule number 1; Always let people know what you’re going to do before you do it; according to Mojo, apparently Brody forgot to tell TPTB that he was going to do this, thus leading to a lot of confusion backstage. I’ve worked at enough places in my lifetime to know that you can disagree with your boss, but you must NEVER go over their heads……And THAT is why the most high profile thing Brody has done in recent years is a Biopic on Harry Houdini—on Basic Cable……on the Friggin HISTORY CHANNEL for God’s sake!\n\nMOJO: 2\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nREMINISCING ABOUT DOWN SYNDROME (2/24/2007) – Yeah…I can see why certain groups didn’t like this joke; whether it was a throwaway line or otherwise. NBC has scrubbed this one from their pages, and the SNL Transcripts pages seems to not exist anymore (except through saved scraps via the internet archive, which is why we’re Lucky [?] to at least have evidence that the sketch happened). But that’s the thing, it was just ONE unfortunate joke in an otherwise funny sketch; in fact, they did several “Reminiscing” sketches for the next few years after this, so I can’t imagine the damage done being that great to begin with…Still though, people with disabilities are still people, and they deserve as much respect as the rest of us—no matter what certain human dumpster fires do in front of crowds in order to induce approval from drooling masses. Tough call, but as long as this draws the ire of someone—particularly a DS advocacy group—it’s pretty hard to defend it no matter if it’s a throwaway joke or an entire Plot point……isn’t that right, Mr. MacFarlane?\n\nMOJO: 3\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nMARTIN LAWRENCE’S MONOLOGUE (2/19/1994) – Well, well………You, again. I’m not going to belabor the point; anything worth saying about him, I already mentioned a few weeks ago. To recap; At the time, Yes, this WAS offensive to a lot of people (Women in particular), and Lawrence hasn’t returned since…But like I said before, it’s been nearly 25 years—I think it’s time for Lawrence to make a comeback; (most) people change, and with Lawrence pushing 50 now, I doubt that he’s the same guy now than he was back then.\n\nMOJO: 4\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nTIGER WOODS (12/5/2009) – Unlike Rainn Wilson & the Down Syndrome mis-fire, this sketch happens to still exist on NBC’s website—then again, so does an Update piece with Kenan as Cosby from the same episode, but let’s put out one fire at a time. As Mojo says, it would’ve been bad if the show DIDN’T make fun of Woods’ sex scandal a few years ago; but it was the Way they did it that seems to raise the flags. To which I say……….Really? I mean, it WAS a major news story at the time. And all the different ways Tiger’s Ex (host Blake Lively) are probably no more offensive than old Looney Tunes cartoons where a wife would probably clock a husband with a Rolling Pin. Yes, I know, there are a number of Double Standards buried here (Man hitting Woman = Bad, Woman hitting Man = Funny?), and I’m not one to condone Domestic Violence; but it’s not like the real Woods was exactly a saint during this time. Either that, or Maybe it was because the audience felt the show was kicking a man while he was down that the reaction to the sketch was the way it turned out to be…But then again (especially as the next entry shows), when has kicking someone while they’re down stopped them before?\n\nMOJO: 4\n\nBLOG: 1\n\nPUSH: 0\n\n“LOOK KIDS, A FALLING STAR, MAKE A WISH!” (12/10/1995) – I mentioned this moment already during “Update Week” last year, so hopefully you know the drill…………HOWEVER, even though they specifically mention this one incident; people often forget that this wasn’t the ONLY time they made fun of Murphy’s career on the downswing—as a matter of fact, they made fun of his career while he was in the middle of a comeback. In a sketch long-since scrubbed by NBC, Tim Meadows played Murphy in a piece called “Good Samaritan” (CLIP NOT AVAILABLE); which poked fun at a mis-guided hooker pick-up in 1997 (A throwaway joke on the same subject took place in 1998’s “George Clooney/Speed Racer” Smigeltoon–ALSO NOT AVAILABLE). A year or so later when Spade came back to host, he did one more “Hollywood Minute” where he (and a hand puppet of himself) proceeded as normal until the subject of Murphy was brought up again. Spade sort of glosses over the incident, and feels somewhat remorseful that it happened…only for the Puppet Spade to reply “But Did you see ‘Holy Man’, Holy Crap!” Mojo gets the point Because it’s one thing to offend; it’s a totally different thing altogether to offend Family. Yeah, there’ve been a few jokes made at the expense of former Cast Members/Hosts before and since; but at least they (presumably) realized “OK, I get it, very funny” and move on. Murphy was just flat-out O-FEN-DED! It takes a lot more than a couple of apologies to make things right; and I’m still holding out hope that Murphy makes a non-Anniversary appearance before Network television is rendered obsolete.\n\nMOJO: 5\n\nBLOG: 1\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nDJESUS UNCROSSED (2/15/2013) – This sketch I think you can file under “C’mon, Lighten Up!” I mean, if Monty Python can make light of Crucifixion, why can’t SNL? Unfortunately, just as sure as God makes Little Green Apples, it also makes Religious advocacy groups (Both Christian AND Muslim) that cry foul whenever their beliefs are being mocked. I honestly don’t find this offensive whatsoever; for what it is, I think it’s a very sharp parody of Tarantino movies in General regardless of its context; and if you’re actually offended by this……….then I would like to welcome our brand new Christian & Muslim viewers who are reading this…and please don’t Crucify/Fatwa me.\n\nMOJO: 5\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nFRED ARMISEN AS DAVID PATTERSON (2008-2010) – Not really much to say about this one; Fred Armisen made fun of blind people (and in particular, an Elected official); and there’s only so much of that an audience could take—that, and it simply wasn’t funny after the first time; and even the First time was a Stretch. The thing that gives this a “Push”, however, is The fact that the Real Gov. Patterson eventually came on to call out Fred & the show about the whole thing, and pretty much diffuses/negates any controversy there was in the first place…One point in Fred’s favor, though, he’s certainly on the nose about…………NEW JERSEY!\n\nMOJO: 5\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nNORM VS. OJ & OHLMEYER (1994-1997) – Another one I mentioned already, and one incident in particular that has been told and re-told ad infinitum by others since 1998……….But I’ll mention it again. Depending on which side you’re on, this actually pissed people off…however, Mojo doesn’t quite go into detail on just how many people they pissed off outside of Don Ohlmeyer. The controversy wasn’t so much Norm making hit after hit against OJ (though granted, it didn’t help), The REAL controversy—to me, anyway–lied in the resulting backlash after TPTB did what they did. There were letter writing campaigns to keep Norm on, but that fell on deaf ears (or should that be Blind Eyes?). To this day, a lot of the SNL faithful feel that Norm got screwed—which I guess is something of a Tradition among certain NBC talent—But at the same time, Television is still a business. If something isn’t working the way people expect it to, you either make changes or be prepared to go down with the ship. In spite of it being a no-win situation for everybody involved; the show went on, and eventually the wound would heal………Sort of.\n\nMOJO: 6\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 1\n\n(DIS)HONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\nCANTEEN BOY (1994) – Considering this sketch aired at/around the time Michael Jackson was first accused of Literally, Figuratively and Allegedly getting In Touch with his Outer Inner Child; this sketch understandably got people’s attention in a bad way. In fact, in the old Coffee Table book marking the show’s 20 years, they actually had a photo showing a list of how many viewers complained about the episode in question; though I don’t remember the Exact number, Canteen Boy’s ranged in the Thousands—Going by “Family Guy” logic, if one complaint equals 1 million viewers, that means the entire population of earth at the time AND people yet to be born saw Alec Baldwin making the moves on Sandler. Unlike Fred as David Patterson, though, this moment more than warranted more formal apologies; and they did so not only in reruns by adding a disclaimer at the top of the sketch, but also later in December ’94 when Baldwin put out the fire in his monologue.\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY’S FATAL ATTRACTION (2017) – Audience, say it with me now (*CLICK HERE*)…The fact that the real “daughter of Skeletor” was actually sort of “Forgainst” the sketch and Kate McKinnon’s performance in her own roundabout way shows that even the most soulless of beings can laugh at themselves once in a while.\n\nISIS FATHER/DAUGHTER AD (2015) – I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but I think people were way, Way, WAY too quick to pounce on this one…that’s right, I’m defending an ISIS Sketch (So much for my future political career). To its credit; unlike that OTHER “Sketch that shall not be named” when Chris Rock hosted earlier that season, at least this one not only uses “Gotcha!” humor correctly; but because it’s a commercial parody, it doesn’t belabor the point for too long—just get the joke in, and get out (relatively) unscathed, nothing wrong with that. Sure, It doesn’t change the fact that ISIS is Still a Major hot button even to this day, but at least a little more thought was put in here than it was with Rock. Say what you will about this one, I actually thought it was funny for the purpose it served.\n\nMOJO: 7\n\nBLOG: 4\n\nPUSH: 1\n\n1.UNCLE FESTER VS. THE POPE (10/3/1992) – Although my SNL fandom begins around 1994, my awareness of the show’s existence occurred in 1992; thanks in part to the “Wayne’s World” Starmaker tape, being able to stay up late to watch half of that year’s Christmas show with Glenn Close; and of course, This moment which made the rounds on newscasts for about a week or so, and my constant asking of my parents “I don’t get it, what does this mean?” at the age of 7 years old. I cannot speak for the Catholic religion considering I’m far from it; but yes, absolutely, without a doubt, this remains one of those moments you never forget; and for all the WRONG reasons…………or at least, that was the case when it first aired (and yes, I know, I’m about to break one of my own rules here). In 1992, it was a Genuinely shocking moment; one that sucked the energy out of the room and provoked a lot of debate since. But for those who are old enough to remember who Sinead O’Connor is outside of “Nothing Compares 2 U”, you have to realize that she was never in it for the fame or even the infamy; she just wanted to get a couple points across—if you don’t believe me, I want you to Really listen carefully to the words she’s singing in “War”, you’d be passionate about Child Abuse too—ESPECIALLY when it involves a branch of religion. Before her singing career, O’Connor was heavily involved with the Catholic Church as a former Nun; and even back then, there was a lot of things happening behind closed doors that nobody was bringing to light. Some have argued that O’Connor’s actions that night was Heresy in its highest form; but as the years progressed, and more evidence mounted as to what exactly the Church was doing that offended many, the result was the Church gaining a stigma that—to this day—it is trying to distance itself from. That being said, there are certain ways one can make a protest; O’Connor chose to do so in a way that grabbed a lot of attention long before “Going Viral” was even a gleam in Silicon Valley’s eye. Chances are, if she pulled a stunt like that in this day and age, she would probably be labeled as a folk hero; and I guess in some circles, she sort of still is today in spite of becoming all but a blip on the popularity map.\n\nFurther; looking at a few passages in Shales/Miller, the show somehow managed to take the incident in stride despite just how much of a lightning rod for Controversy it was. While I’m not going to go through every one of them, I feel that the whole incident—and even the other ones on this list–can best be described with a quote from former NBC President Warren Littlefield:\n\n“Even when it was ‘Oh My God, [she] tore a picture of the Pope’, I said to Lorne ‘When we go Too long without controversy, something’s wrong. This show is Supposed to Rock, it’s supposed to be the adolescent that’s not obedient to authority. And if we lose that, then we don’t have the show.’”\n\nCan’t argue with that.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\n\nMOJO: 8\n\nBLOG: 4\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nThere were some legitimately and rightfully controversial moments mentioned; but once again, it wouldn’t be a WatchMojo list if they left out a couple more moments that probably would’ve made it on the list were it not for the fact that there were only 10 spots to fill. There was no love for moments from the 70s or the 80s (It’s almost as though Canada had never even HEARD of “Dice”; or they’re too polite to mention him anyway); but I guess that’s a blessing in disguise—after all, if things were Too controversial, the show would’ve been axed a long time ago. That, and there’s also a fine line between Controversy, Pissing People Off, and “Unfortunate Mistakes”…The biggest one you could possibly make on Live Broadcast Television (short of public death) is our focus next time.\n\nMM: Strange Bedfellows\n\nIn the Words of Mel Brooks in “History of the World Part 1”; POLITICS! POLITICS! POLITICS! POLITICS! POLITICS!\n\nA while back, I did a couple of lists tied in to SNL’s history of Political skewering; one about debate sketches, the other was a super–sized list containing political sketches in general. This list is about Neither of those things, as this seems to be more of a “Character” Focused list—though you wouldn’t know that by looking at the title of the video. Seriously, why not say “Top 10 Political Characters” instead of “Political Parodies”? It would just make things less confusing for the viewer. So in order to avoid making this a list of Pushes, if they say it’s a list of “Portrayals”, I am going to judge it as such.\n\nDARRELL HAMMOND AS DICK CHENEY (2000-2008) – Hammond will always go down in SNL history as an impressionist extraordinaire; but while his impressions during his first 5 years on the show were largely walk-off home runs, his portrayal of evil Richard Dreyfus impersonator Dick Cheney took a little time to get used to. Hammond debuted the impression during 2000’s “Presidential Bash” special, and truth be told, it was incredibly stiff; hardly generating any laughs except for maybe a pity one over how awkward it was…But that Was just the first time. As time progressed, Hammond’s impression became one that we grew to tolerate, but it was still more “Accurate” than it was “Funny”; nothing that ever really set the world on fire…which gives this positioning a fair justification. That, and the impression came in handy whenever the show needed to figure out who’s gonna play Dubya next; can’t deny reliability.\n\nMOJO: 1\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nNORM MacDONALD AS BOB DOLE (1995-1996) – Although Norm was a fearless Update anchor, his sketch work was spotty at best—even Norm himself said that he never liked being in sketches; and especially playing Bob Dole. Unfortunately for him, Dole was the leading candidate in the 1996 suicide mission to dethrone Clinton; and after doing it a handful of times at the beginning of Season 21, my guess is that Norm was suddenly obligated to go all the way with it. Not that it was a bad impression or anything…then again, Aykroyd can run circles around him any day. The peak of this impression came when in March 1996, a classic spoof of MTV’s “Real World” (Which I have foolishly left behind on my TV Parodies list) where Dole is trying—almost desperately—to appeal to Younger voters by trying to fit in with Gen-X houseguests. This was also one of the rare times when a Character got a Formal “Ending”, when just after the Election, the real deal showed up to let Norm down easy about the impression. The fact that the real Dole was a good sport about everything made it all the more worth it for Norm. In a way, though, I’m kinda glad Dole lost that year; Norm would probably be as sick of doing this impression over 4 years as a certain someone is tired of doing another famous politico…but we’ll save that for later.\n\nMOJO: 2\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nJAY PHAROAH AS BARACK OBAMA (2012-2016) – Let’s be Frank; he should’ve done it 2 years earlier instead of having Fred Armisen flirt with controversy by donning a quasi-blackface look to play him. Pharoah’s is clearly a marked improvement; and I agree with Mojo in that he captured pretty much all of his mannerisms…at least, for a while. By the time Pharoah Left/got fired from/had his contract bought out by the show (or whatever version you want to believe), the impression became riddled with Senioritis; the mannerisms and the demeanor was still there, but it didn’t seem to carry the same energy as it did at the beginning–that, and by that point in time, Jordan Peele had a better impression of him going on anyway. One thing I have to point out against Mojo; Why would you use a clip of somebody who’s clearly NOT Jay Pharoah when talking about the guy? Since I don’t watch Fallon, I have no idea who the guy playing opposite Jimmy’s Trump is, but I know it ain’t Jay—not that the other guy isn’t talented or anything, but that just sticks out like a sore thumb inadvertently poking Pharoah in the eye. Nevertheless, at least Jay’s impression was still a solid one, and it helped correct an Armisen-sized wrong at the right time.\n\nMOJO: 3\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nDANA CARVEY AS GEORGE BUSH SR. (1987-2000) – Among the names on the list, this is actually my favorite Political impression of the bunch…Partly because his was one of the first ones that really stuck in my mind–Having him do it in the monologue on that fateful first time he hosted in ‘94 also helps (and so does having the Real Deal’s stamp of approval). But more than that, I’d like to think that Carvey’s impression of Bush Sr. (and to an extent, Ross Perot later in the 90s) was one of the major reasons why people my age started to pay more attention to politics in general; probably because we had to understand what was happening in the news that week in order to understand what was happening in the sketches we’d see at the end of the week. Otherwise, to the less informed who would’ve watched back then, they might’ve thought it was Carvey doing just another silly voice; and if Carvey stuck to the “Original” impression he did of him when he debuted the performance in ’87, it probably would’ve stayed silly, and not a subversive kind of silly like it would become. The only reason I would give this one a Push is because—as I said—this is my favorite Political impression; but despite including it on the list, Mojo feels it’s a little less than that to only warrant a #7. It’s an honor just to be nominated, I guess.\n\nMOJO: 3\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nMELISSA McCARTHY AS SEAN SPICER (2017) – Not gonna lie, when this first aired, it rightfully earned a place as Watercooler/Coffee Machine/Snack Vending television. It was funny as Hell, Everybody everywhere was talking about it, and the performance earned McCarthy a much deserved Emmy for her efforts………Unfortunately, for the fact that the Real Spicer is currently (at best) a Footnote in American History, give or take a couple appearances on Kimmel, McCarthy’s impression will probably never be able to stand the test of time unlike the other people on the list—Possibly because the rest of the people being portrayed on the list are far more prolific than an otherwise “humble” Press Secretary could be. I know I use the term “Strike while the Iron’s Hot” a lot, but McCarthy’s “Spicy” seems like something that could only happen at that moment, never to be heard from again (Unlike former Presidents who can pop back into the news at any time). I don’t disagree 100% with the selection; but I guarantee you, unless the Real Spicer is a part of whoever’s administration is next, or even if he runs for office himself, time won’t be friendly to these sketches later on…it’s barely friendly to them now.\n\nMOJO: 3\n\nBLOG: 1\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nALEC BALDWIN AS “YOU KNOW WHO” (2016-Present) – As I said a few years ago during our “Countdown to the Trumpocalypse”, Baldwin’s Trump impression has long since beaten the likes of Hartman’s, Hammond’s and Killam’s impressions of him since he donned the bronzer………That was 2016. In 2018, there seems to be some fatigue setting in not just with viewers, but quite possibly with Baldwin himself—and who could blame him? Of course, Baldwin started portraying KGB Agent Orangeski at a time when the Western World thought there was no way in hell the real deal could possibly win; and at best, Baldwin thought this was gonna be a temporary gig until after the election—how wrong we were; but Baldwin, being a professional, carried on anyway. Sure, the amount of times Baldwin played him has reduced significantly in the past year, but he’s still here, and Baldwin still does it…much to some fans dismay. Sidebar: If Baldwin is Really as sick of playing him as he says he is, the show should just do what KFC has been doing for a while now with their Col. Sanders; have a rotating stable of guest actors come on and do Their version of Trump. Hell, Fallon already has a decent one, and he can do it a number of times as a Penance cure for making the real one look human. Fatigue aside, it’s probably the most thankless job Baldwin has ever done aside from “30 Rock”; a steadfast soldier has to do what they have to do—and I’m certainly not going to argue about the significant impact it’s had on the show.\n\nMOJO: 4\n\nBLOG: 1\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nKATE McKINNON AS HILARY CLINTON (2014-2016) – Y’know what, I’m going to use one of my rare Deferrals on this one. Because as much as I love Kate’s portrayal of HRC, singling hers out kind of does a disservice to those who portrayed her in years past—not just on SNL, but elsewhere. So with that (and if you have about 17 minutes to kill), take a look noted film scholar Lindsey Ellis’ take on the people that lampooned Mrs. Clinton and how all the parts add up to a bigger whole. Otherwise, no complaints about Mojo’s position here; Kate is indeed the Alpha Vs. Hooks, Gasteyer and Poehler, There, I said it (and I Refuse to count Vanessa Bayer’s version—FAR Too cheerful)!\n\nMOJO: 5\n\nBLOG: 1\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nPHIL HARTMAN AS BILL CLINTON (1992-1994) – When talking about his Hidden Gems, I mentioned that the Early 90s were probably Phil at his Zenith thanks in part to taking more chances and a lot more leading roles in sketches. Well, you can’t ask for a bigger leading role than playing the leader of the free world; a role that he not only hit the ground running with in March 1992, but he did so with a genuine sense of “Happy Shock” from the audience—I mean it too, pretend you’ve had your memory erased up to ’92, and you have no prior knowledge of who Bill Clinton is aside from whatever it is you see in the news at the time, and THEN watch that particular sketch; almost instantaneously, you BELIEVE that Hartman is Bill Clinton. And while his impression remains one of the all-time greats; I can’t help but feel a number of “What Ifs”; What if Darrell Hammond was never hired, and they brought Hartman on as a “Special Guest” to do Clinton a la Jan Hooks’ appearances in the early 90s? What if Hartman had lived past 1998, and his Clinton had to go through all the Lewinsky stuff? What if he had the chance to act opposite any of the aforementioned women who played Hillary? Sadly, we’ll never know, but something tells me that he could’ve done all of the above and both he and the audience would Never get tired of it, Alec!\n\nMOJO: 6\n\nBLOG: 1\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nWILL FERRELL AS DUBYA (1999-Present) – As much as I love Carvey playing Bush Sr. Will Ferrell playing Junior comes a microscopically close 2nd—must be something about the name “Bush” that garners a laugh automagically. Pretty much take what I just said about Phil playing Clinton and just change a couple names and Details around, and you’ve got what I think of Ferrell playing everybody’s favorite War-mongering, English language battering, Pretzel Choking former President and part-time painter. Ferrell was already pretty well established by the time the 2000 elections were taking shape, but it’s pretty hard to argue that this portrayal put him on the map and kept him there. There’s really not much to add to the sentiment; Ferrell’s Bush was about as endearing as the Real Dubya was perplexing; and in the wake of all that’s going on in the world, I would Happily take somebody who’s bumbling over a textbook narcissist any day of the week.\n\nMOJO: 7\n\nBLOG: 1\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\nDAN AYKROYD AS JIMMY CARTER (1976-1979) – I guess it was OK, but a little too low-key at times. His impression Did get better as the years went on, but only because around 1977, Aykroyd finally got around to shaving his mustache; thus making the impression more realistic (Though if he kept it, he probably would’ve made a great Ted Turner). Push for Mojo.\n\nLARRY DAVID AS BERNIE SANDERS (2015-2017) – As talented as McKinnon is, it would be unfair for her to have the game all to herself. So when LD came along to play Sanders after countless internet memes suggest they were practically related (Oh, Wait…), it was both a welcome surprise to the audience, and a justifiable revenge for Larry after getting shafted in the 1984 “Steinbrenner Season”. Unless the Real Sanders tries again in 2020, Mojo just barely got it right.\n\nJON LOVITZ AS MIKE DUKAKIS (1988) – Really? I might be wrong but the ’88 Debate, “Dukakis After Dark” and a “Cheers” parody months later might’ve been the Only times I’ve seen Lovitz’s portrayal…and quite honestly, it wasn’t all that great. It sort of felt like he was Toning down his “Liar” character by about 90% and with far less lying; Mojo’s Wrong.\n\nMOJO: 8\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 2\n\n1.TINA FEY AS SARAH PALIN (2008-Present) – I think I may have mentioned a thing or two before about Tina’s portrayal of “Alaska’s Next Top Model of 1992”. And while I agree with Mojo that it was an important impression for both Tina and the Show, the Law of Diminishing returns kind of makes the #1 spot a little dubious—Incidentally, “The Ringer” just listed the portrayal’s debut appearance as one of the top 100 greatest TV episodes of the 21st century (so far), and pretty much echoes the sentiment of diminishing value over time. Quite honestly, Tina should’ve stopped doing it the night after the Real Palin cameoed in ’08—or by the end of the Election at the latest. But nope, she just kept going with it, even as recent as this past May’s finale. There was really no need for her to continue doing so (unless the Real one made the news in some way), she did what she had to do, and she should’ve taken a bow afterward……Then again, Rock stars are prone to doing encores whether they want to or not. I can’t imagine there was a high audience demand for the impression to keep coming back, but it did anyway. Not unlike Baldwin as Trump, this too was an impression that had a significant impact when it happened, but now just seems like beating a dead horse—even more so since the Real Palin’s relevancy grows dimmer every day she’s not on Fox News. In which case, just switch Palin with Carvey’s Bush Sr, and all will be right with the world.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\n\nMOJO: 8\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 3\n\nSo, Mojo was mostly right this time—and I also want to give them all the credit in the world for leaving out Chevy as Gerald Ford, because the impression was as much an “impression” the same way a Taco Salad could be considered a “Salad”. Unfortunately; they just didn’t have enough room to include Hartman as Reagan, Carvey as Perot, or even some vastly underappreciated ones like Chris Parnell doing John McCain or Piscopo’s version of Reagan—Hell, why limit things to the United States, I would’ve included McKinnon’s Angela Merkel or Beck Bennett as Putin in a heartbeat. The important thing, though, is that they hit all the “necessary” targets, so there was really little to complain about…….So, it’s only fair that next time we look at things that the rest of the viewing public (allegedly) complained about in much louder tones.\n\nMM: Notorious S.N.L. – The Monologues\n\nLet’s switch gears this week and talk about “Controversy”…Which I put in quotes because, as is the case with comedy and other things, it’s highly subjective and all in the eye of the beholder. SNL is no stranger to controversy, no matter how big or how small it ever got. Still though, some moments stuck out a little more than most—particularly in the show’s opening Monologue. Now, while I did do a list of Favorite monologues many moons ago, that was really more of a list of things that I enjoyed watching. This list, on the other hand, may contain enjoyable moments, but also moments that can make one squirm—especially in light of recent events. Take it, Mojo…\n\nThis list is probably going to fall in the same vain as the Original GSG article about “Not knowing what ‘Scandal’ Means”, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be a fair share of monocle popping; there will be certain people on this list who recently got themselves into their own kind of trouble—in those cases, I am going to TRY to judge their monologues based on their own merits/it being a product of when they aired…\n\nKUMAIL NANJIANI (10/14/2017) – There’s gonna be a number of “Recent” moments in this list, so a lot of these will be viewed with a fairly fresh perspective. Having said that, I’m pretty open minded when it comes to certain subjects. When something controversial rears its head, I try to look at the situation with as even a perspective as I can. This is Not Controversial by ANY means; if anything, Nanjiani raises several good points. Mainly that racism is bad, and ethnic/religious stereotypes are everywhere—Nanjiani defuses both using his own life experiences to his advantage, and the audience becomes better educated because of it. That’s what makes Nanjiani as popular as he is, he knows the problems that surround his life, and he takes it with a grain of salt. What sticks out about this entry is that Mojo never expressly says what was “Controversial” about it; nobody filed any complaints or anything…either that, or this country has become too polarized that we’re not sure what to find offensive anymore—to each his own, I guess.\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 1\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nSAM KINISON (11/15/1986) – Hell, No! If you think for a moment that joining in with the SNL band and jamming with them is considered “Controversial”, Congratulations, you belong either in the U.S. Congress, or running a Christian (*INSERT TRADE HERE*). What’s wrong with letting loose a little? The fact that his Jam session takes up about half of the monologue further dilutes whatever “Controversy” any actual comedy could entail—and even the ending with the NYPD on horseback confronting him was all part of the bit anyway. If Kinison actually told jokes that (1) he didn’t already tell in previous appearances or (2) were offensive even by 80s standards or (3) let loose a few F-Bombs, the show would’ve slapped the 7 second delay on him ahead of time. Incidentally, Mojo DID mention incidents where Kinison’s material wound up getting censored, ultimately resulting in a temporary spat between him & NBC……This appearance happened AFTER that, so I’m guessing they made up. I would’ve awarded the point to Mojo if they focused more on the Other incident instead of burying the lead.\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nKRISTEN STEWART (2/11/2017) – Speaking of F-Bombs, There are certain times when the F-Word can/should be considered controversial (and we’ll talk more about that subject later this summer). This—like 99% of them—was just an unintentional slip of the tongue that just HAPPENS to happen on Live TV, and no harm was meant to be inflicted, especially in the heat of the moment. On the other hand, Stewart is probably the least likely person to do so given how shy she seems to be in public; ergo, the fact that she lets one loose was really more “surprising” than it was controversial. Points to her, however, for playing it cool afterward—and considering her episode turned out a lot better than I thought it would, I wouldn’t mind seeing her come back—7 Second delay or otherwise.\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 3\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nAZIZ ANSARI (1/21/2017) – Kinda awkward talking about him considering he got sucked into #MeToo/#TimesUp’s Gravitational pull, but like I said at the top, I’m going to Try to judge this on its own merits. This was shortly after You-know-who’s inauguration took place, and a good chunk of the nation was still feeling angry about it (Though not as angry as people felt at selection #6); so, Ansari did what he could to put out the fire. He called out closeted racists (or “Lower-Case KKK”) who felt now that someone lighter-skinned is in power, it’s OK to let loose…I’ll let the last year and a half in this country speak for itself. He also points out the various quirks (?) of being Islamaphobic, and just how ridiculous those quirks (again, ?) can be sometimes. I see nothing controversial about either one of these things, Ansari—like 99.9% of All comedians—are just philosophizing about how we got to this point, and it’s an especially pointed perspective on his end because of his South Asian descent.\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 4\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nDAVE CHAPPELLE (11/12/2016) – The nation just experienced not just one of the most bitter elections in modern history, but also an aftermath that many of us are still experiencing today. Simply put, Somebody needed to put things in perspective, and maybe—just Maybe—help heal a wounded nation at the same time. Long story short; Hell. Friggin. NO, this was Not Controversial. If anything, Chappelle should be commended for doing this (In fact, he won an Emmy for doing so); Nevermind that he let a few N-Words fly, at least he’s allowed to do that. Granted the part where he says he wants to “Give Trump a Chance” backfired spectacularly since this aired, but at the time, this was a way to let off some much built-up steam and see a time-tested comedy warrior return to the battlefield with a vengeance.\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 5\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nNORM MacDONALD (10/23/1999) – (NOTE: I know the Actual monologue is on NBC’s website, I’m sort of in a time crunch, so I hope you don’t mind “Hearing” it instead) I’ve already spoken a great deal about this one elsewhere, and quite honestly, the inclusion of this one is probably the most puzzling of all. I mean, if you were fired from your job and then suddenly asked to come back, what would You have done? Pretend that nothing happened? Further, if this (or any of the other Monologues on this list) were so “controversial”, why would they allow them to air in the first place, or even make it past Dress Rehearsal? Clearly, somebody HAD to approve the dialogue being said here, and Nobody is going off script (That we know of). When I first saw this as a teen, I just thought Norm was getting his revenge, and nothing more. It didn’t earn the ire of any special interest groups, so I’d say this too was free of controversy.\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 6\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nCHRIS ROCK (11/1/2014) – It almost feels like a waste of time to talk about how Good a straight-up, stand-up monologue is—largely because monologues of this caliber are so few and far between these days that it almost acts as an oasis in between the barren wastelands that is Song & Dance. Chris Rock’s has always been more no-nonsense in his approach. Be that as it may, this is not without its faults. Pretty much Most of the Terrorist jokes might rub other people the wrong way (not that those jokes weren’t funny as hell to me…The Jokes about Christmas/Jesus/Shopping cooled down the uncomfortability). There really isn’t much else to be said here, it’s Chris Rock being Chris Rock; just about everything else he did hit the bullseye—regardless of the uncomfortability factor. At the time, yes, I could see why people were upset about this—especially with memories of the Boston Marathon Bombing still fresh at the time. Tough Call; but in terms of actual controversy, the Boston jokes were only a part of a much bigger whole; not enough to negate the entire thing.\n\nMOJO: 0\n\nBLOG: 6\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nLARRY DAVID (11/4/2017) – Full Disclosure: I’m Jewish. I’ve heard ‘em all; some even worse than what Larry did. I blame an overly-sensitive audience for the blowback. To further illustrate just how overblown the reaction was to this, may I recommend a documentary on Netflix called “The Last Laugh”. It’s about the Holocaust, the survivors, and their ability to cope with the bad times using humor. Mel Brooks (among other comedians) is in it, and it just goes to show that anybody can take a joke…no matter how dark the subject matter…On the flipside though, I can’t speak for the rest of the country who actually were offended—and there were a lot of them…perhaps even Larry himself, who clearly had a look of anguish on his face as he’s about to drop the bomb, so to speak. Not only that, but since he’s lumping things in with “Me Too”, it turns the whole thing into an “Apples & Oranges” scenario where some targets become less fair than others…which is why this is the First entry on this list that Mojo Actually got right. This piece actually (and rightfully) did get sufficient backlash from a number of Jewish Groups; and believe me, they can hold a grudge if not dealt with right away. Larry remains one of my favorites, but that set of jokes was probably better suited on HBO.\n\nMOJO: 1\n\nBLOG: 6\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nLOUIS CK (5/15/2015) – I’m just going to repeat and stand by what I said about this a year ago; if Baldwin came back after the infamous “Canteen Boy” sketch, then at least there’s some precedent for Louie to come back after making jokes like these…and he did, coming back to host in April of 2017, still doing jokes that seem to cross the line in some people’s eyes. Of course, the Molester jokes have been a part of Louie’s repertoire for years, and nobody complained then; but I’m trying really hard to judge this on its own merits…….twisted as they may be now. Still though, This monologue earns a “Push” because it has a similar problem to Chris Rock’s; in that it was largely funny, but then one moment sort of negates everything even though the rest of the stuff was still funny; but more so, that moment’s controversy actually gained a little heat because let’s see you try to defend pedophilia. Sidebar: Mojo mentions Louie’s “First” appearance on the show being the one you see here from 2015…which is only correct if every other number in the world was +3…but I digress.\n\nMOJO: 1\n\nBLOG: 6\n\nPUSH: 2\n\n1. MARTIN LAWRENCE (2/19/1994) – I didn’t become a fan of the show until months after this aired, so I kinda felt like I missed the boat with this one. To this day, I have never seen the “Original” version of the monologue, though I have read the Transcript to it. And Quite Honestly…………….Yeah, I can see why this is #1 in Mojo’s eyes…but not (quite) mine. Were it a different time or place, Dave Chappelle would probably tell the exact same jokes in his own way, and be labeled as a Hero for doing so. The great irony here is that the “Edited” version everybody has seen with Jim Downey’s disclaimer actually kind of makes things a little funnier; because here you have one of the most caustic comedians of all time acting manic while talking about John Bobbitt and Female Hygiene, and then you’ve got the complete opposite trying—almost in vain—to balance things out with how hushed and muted Downey is reading the disclaimer. Once again, I want to try to judge this based on how people reacted when it first aired; reading the transcript once again, I totally get why people were offended back then; but nearly 25 years later, it just feels like something any other comedian would talk about—gross as it may be for some. Time has not been friendly to this piece, and Martin Lawrence has certainly mellowed considerably since then……Don’t you think it’s time to lift the ban (pardon me, the “Ban”), Lorne?\n\nFINAL SCORE:\n\nMOJO: 2\n\nBLOG: 6\n\nPUSH: 2\n\nThough not a complete shutout for Mojo this week; I’m guessing their Canadian-ness that led them to these conclusions, otherwise they are wholly full of crap this round. What truly invalidates this list is the fact that they didn’t even bother mentioning bits that actually earned the title of “Controversial”; How about Richard Pryor’s set from ’75? Granted, it’s very tame now, but in ’75, they all but raised red flags for him hosting. How about Howard Hesseman imploring the home audience to moon a picture of President Reagan? OK, we never really saw his butt, but the implication is there. What about when Pamela Anderson (Lee) got Naked in front of the audience? (*SIGH*) Yes, there were well placed (and pixelated) pasties on her, so she wasn’t actually nude…but tell that to “Focus on the Family”. How about that one time in ’77 when Buck Henry tried to showcase a Live Sex act? Or Louise Lasser getting balls-to-the-wall high during hers (and the rest of her show in general)? Or Kris Kristofferson being blind-stinkin-drunk during his (AV Club kills two birds with one stone there)? Michael Palin sticking cats down his pants had to have earned the ire of the ASPCA, right? And, Oh, I don’t know, how about ANDREW FRIGGING DICE CLAY! Somebody (aside from Nora Dunn) HAD to have been offended by what he said when he hosted. How about Trump………Nah, that’s beating a horse into dog food by this point.\n\nHopefully you get the point, there were a LOT of moments that Mojo let slip through the cracks, and they didn’t even bother with Honorable mentions. Unfortunately, I have to be fair and say that with 40+ years of shows to sift through; of course they’re going to miss a detail or two. But I don’t want to keep using that excuse for the rest of the summer; so for our next list, I feel the need to tip the scale back in the other direction with something a little more “Agreeable”…\n\nAbove the Norm (UPDATED)\n\nTo recap; I started doing SNL episode reviews for a website that no longer exists all the way back in 1999—I was only 14 (going on 15) years old at the time. I only had the internet for a few months, so discovering there were honest to god Communities where people could gather to talk about a TV show, let alone any other random topic, felt revolutionary to me at the time—then again, so did the concept of increasing levels of nudity online. The first few times I ever wrote anything and had to submit it via e-mail, I had to use my Father’s e-mail address; and based on what I wrote about the following episode, the hate mail he wound up getting on my behalf prompted him to set up my own e-mail the following week. And after seeing what I wrote about this particular episode nearly 20 years later…………Yeah, I can see why the fanbase wanted to rip a 14 year old kid a new one. Then again, that’s why I do these Retro Reviews; to try and right the wrongs. Speaking of righting the wrongs, this was the episode where Norm MacDonald came back to host after one of TV’s greatest mis-managements of talent took place roughly 2 years earlier (*COUGH*); by this point in time, the ABC network took a chance on him and gave him his own sitcom—sure, it ran 3 years, but those are still “Cult Classic” numbers in my book instead of outright failure. Hell, not just Norm, but the rest of the cast were a TV Dream Team in retrospect (Longtime TV Producer/Writer Bruce Helford running the show, Ian Gomez, Nikki Cox, Faith Ford, Artie Lange, Max “WILLIE” Wright, and Laurie “Give Her an Oscar, DAMMIT!” Metcalf rounding out the cast—and yet, only 3 years…go figure). But Norm didn’t come back to SNL just to plug a TV show; No, no………..He came back for Revenge (or at least enough of it so that he doesn’t get in too much trouble with the network again).\n\nOld Thoughts Blocked, New in Blue, and you damn well better believe I’m leaving the grammar mistakes intact. ESPECIALLY for a review this primordial…\n\nNorm MacDonald/Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg & Eminem – Original Airdate: 10/23/1999\n\nSo Norm comes back, at first, I was excited. but little did I know, I would\n\nbe sitting through what would be the most\n\ndissapointing episode this season so far. You may dissagree with me, but\n\nthat’s just what you think. anyway…\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Not even 3 poorly wri"
