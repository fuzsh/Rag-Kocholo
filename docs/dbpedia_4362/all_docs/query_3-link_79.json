        "text": "PART ONE\n\nI have an addition to Music Monday. Naomi has written a beautiful post.\n\nClick on Here in the Hills for the story.\n\nI am posting the videos only.\n\nCAROL BRUCE 1919-2007\n\n\"Someone to Watch Over Me\"\n\nPART TWO\n\nI am dedicating this post to a friend.\n\nWelcome to Raggedyland!\n\nEach friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.\n\n~ Anaïs Nin\n\nYes'm, old friends is always best, 'less you can catch a new one that's fit to make an old one out of.\n\n~ Sarah Orne Jewett\n\nThis post contains a viewer discretion advisory!This post contains Adult content.\n\nWe are taking a walk on the wild side today.\n\nThis is a Music Monday mixed with some comedy because Sam is a multi talent and I can’t show the music without the comedy and do him justice.\n\nThe information for this post comes from a variety of sources,\n\nWikipedia\n\nSam Kinison Official Web Site\n\nAbout Sam Kinison\n\nRodney Dangerfield\n\nand video from You Tube .\n\nSam Kinison\n\nSamuel \"Sam\" Burl Kinison (December 8, 1953 – April 10, 1992) was an American stand-up comedian and actor.\n\nKinison was famous for his extremely raunchy humor and amazingly wild, colorful outfits.\n\nSome Sam Quotes:\n\nThat's when you know you're pretty f---ed up, when it makes sense to fall asleep... I was driving between Needles and Barstow... It's about 120 miles of desert... It's four in the morning, man...\n\nHey, this is a pretty good time to go to sleep ... (SCREAMS HYSTERICALLY) So I totaled this f---in' car out, man!... I f---in' totaled it! And it made SENSE at the time!\n\n-Sam Kinison\n\nDetox? There's a bargain. $13,000 for a 3 and a half week treatment. And, folks, I don't want to sound like a casual user or anything, but if you can come up with $13,000, you don't have a problem yet!\n\n-Sam Kinison\n\nJesus had a tough life. I read about that guy. Jesus is the only guy that ever came back from the dead that didn't scare the F--- out of everybody!\n\n-Sam Kinison\n\nI love women, I swear to God. It may not seem like it, but I do. It's so funny, women are always out there in the audience, going 'How come you don't say what's wrong with men?' BECAUSE A MAN NEVER BROKE MY F---ING HEART! A MAN NEVER LIED TO ME IN LOVE! A MAN DIDN'T MAKE ME WANNA DRIVE MY CAR INTO A F---IN' WALL!-Sam Kinison\n\nPeople are going: 'Man, aren't you afraid to tell jokes like that? Don't you get just a small chill that runs through your blood when you tell a joke like that? Aren't you afraid of going to hell?' No, I'm not worried about hell. Because I WAS MARRIED FOR TWO F---ING YEARS! HELL WOULD BE LIKE CLUB MED! -Sam Kinison\n\nOne of his albums featured four songs performed by him and his band, and during one notable The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson performance, he delivered what began as a straightforward version of Elvis Presley's Are You Lonesome Tonight, which descended into angry ranting during the spoken breakdown.\n\nKinison might be considered a \"heavy metal comedian,\" since he was occasionally accompanied by a touring band; he also had a prodigious appetite for drugs and alcohol. In 1988, he recorded a novelty version of The Troggs' \"Wild Thing.\" The record didn't make the Billboard Hot 100, but the video was a hit on MTV, featuring cameos from Steven Tyler and Joe Perry from Aerosmith, Slash, Billy Idol, rock guitarist Steve Vai, guitarist Frank Zappa's son Dweezil Zappa, Richie Sambora, Tommy Lee from Mötley Crüe, Robbin Crosby, Warren DeMartini and Stephen Pearcy of Ratt, Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin and a raunchy \"roll on the mat\" dance with Jessica Hahn. Sam hammered out some licks on a custom Stratocaster, with an airbrushed picture of his face frozen in his famous scream.\n\nA Love Song\n\nSam on Rap\n\nA former revival-style preacher, his standup routines were most often characterized by intense, angry ranting and punctuated by his trademark scream. Sam Kinison became one of the the loudest and rudest comedians of the 20th century. For some, his name conjures up images of a hard-partying, hard-drinking wild thing. His views on religion, women, and world hunger managed to put him on the shock comedy map. However, the fact is this demon from hell was an angel in disguise.\n\nA Comedy Clip\n\nBorn in Yakima, Washington, Kinison later attended high school in East Peoria, Illinois. He also lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma for a while with his parents who still live there. His father was a Pentecostal preacher. Sam and his brothers followed in their father's footsteps by touring churches across the Bible Belt and earning a decent living. He was originally a preacher before becoming a comedian. Recordings of his sermons reveal that he used a \"fire and brimstone\" style, punctuated with shouts similar to the ones he would later use in his stand-up routines. He was forced to leave preaching when he divorced his first wife, at which time he took up comedy.\n\nKinison's appearance on Late Night with David Letterman on November 14, 1985 is widely considered to be his breakthrough performance. David Letterman's introduction of Kinison would prove to be prescient: \"Brace yourselves. I'm not kidding. Please welcome Sam Kinison.\"\n\nDeath\n\nKinison was working to become clean and sober in the months before his death and he married his girlfriend Malika Souiri in 1992. Just six days after the wedding, Kinison's white Pontiac Firebird Trans Am was struck by a seventeen-year-old drunk driver on US 95, four miles north of where it intersects Interstate 40, near Fort Mohave, Arizona and Needles, California. He was not wearing a seat belt, and his chest struck the steering wheel upon impact. His best friends J.J. Wall and Carl LaBove were in the van behind Sam. Sam got out of his car and fell to the ground Carl picked him up and held him until help came. As they sat on the road Carl reports that Sam was looking down the road and laughed and was talking to somebody and said no not now. Then he laughed and said \"no, not yet\" and laughed again then he said \"ok, ok\". He then died in the arms of his best friend. Oddly enough he had a joke that said none of us plan to drive drunk but how are we going to get our car's home for work the next day. His wife survived the accident. The other driver received only minor charges because Kinison was found to have very slight traces of cocaine in his bloodstream, though friends and relatives insisted that the comedian was 100% sober at the time of the collision.\n\nHe is interred with family members at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nApparently when Sam had the accident, I heard he got out of the car and look up to the heavens and said, 'I don't want to die,' and then just said, 'Oh, okay,' and laid down and died. It sounds crazy and will probably offend a lot of my fans, but I believe there's a higher power. Some people may think Sam Kinison's in one place, but I know where he is: He's upstairs; he's next to God.\n\n-Ozzy Osbourne\n\nHe'll definately be remembered, because someone that funny and that wild you don't forget.\n\n-Rodney Dangerfield\n\nI found this Poem on Rodney's Site:\n\nFor Rodney\n\nAn old friend of mine died today,\n\na dear, old friend I never met.\n\nI never had a chance to thank him,\n\nto my great sadness and regret.\n\nHe made me laugh a million times.\n\nHe was always so much fun to watch\n\nmaking jokes about his wife, his dog,\n\nand his doctor, Vinnie Boom Botz!\n\nHe found the humor in a hard life,\n\nthough he was just a \"regular guy\".\n\nI've heard his act a thousand times\n\nbut I always laugh until I cry.\n\nThough he wasn't blessed with an actor's looks,\n\nthe world should be glad he heard the call\n\nbecause he gave a voice to every one of us\n\nwho ever thought, \"I get no respect at all!\"\n\nAh, Rodney, I wish you could have lived forever.\n\nThe world is a lot darker now that you're gone.\n\nBut I'm sure you're making 'em laugh up in heaven\n\nand the gifts you gave us will always live on.\n\nSince you were always at the top of your game,\n\nyour passing was something I didn't expect.\n\nBut I can see you cracking up God right now\n\nand hear Him saying, \"Rodney, you have my respect.\"\n\nThat would probably come as a surprise to you\n\nbecause, let's face it, you weren't exactly devout.\n\nBut I can't imagine God having no sense of humor\n\nand I don't think that's what heaven's about.\n\n\"Rodney,\" He'd say, \"I know you weren't a choirboy\n\nbut you're just as good or better, and here's why -\n\nYou made people laugh and forget their troubles\n\nin a world where laughter's often in short supply.\n\nI know you'll like it up here in heaven\n\nand I'm sure that you'll never be lonely\n\nbecause we've recreated your comedy club\n\nand the place is already standing room only.\n\nA lot of your old buddies are waiting inside.\n\nJust like on earth, up here, you're a star.\n\nDon't worry about being on your best behavior.\n\nThere's only one Rodney, so just be who you are.\n\nSam Kinison's sitting at the bar inside.\n\nAndy Kaufman wants to say hello, too.\n\nIn fact, there are millions of people here\n\nwho would love to say thank you to you.\"\n\nThen, with His arm around you, he'll walk you inside.\n\nAll your friends will be there, happy and healed.\n\nHe'll walk up on the stage, take the mic and say,\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen . . . Rodney Dangerfield.\"\n\n- Mark Rickerby\n\nIf God didn't have a sense ofhumor before, he does now.\n\n-Members of Motley Crue\n\nHis performance style was overpowering, with his screaming and wildman appearance, and it disturbed a lot of people. But to me the screaming was eloquent. It was a vent of rage. It added power and depth to his material.\n\n-Richard Belzer, comedian\n\nWhen Sam wasn't cracking jokes, he was so incredibly nice. That's one thing that really surprised me when I met him. Some of his jokes were so rude, but he was warm, down-to-earth, caring, full of compliments.\n\n-Lita Ford\n\nWhen most people memorialize Sam, they remember his scream; his partying; his never-ending diatribe on women, homosexuals and the religious right. I, however, choose to remember something else about him. His soft, vulnerable side. The twinkle in his eyes. The times I spent with him and Malika, giving ourselves home facials and conditioning our hair, while watching his well worn copy of 'North By Northwest'. That is the Sam that I miss most.\n\n- Hope Frederick\n\nSam Kinison was absolutely fearless. He was like a comedy combination of Chuck Yeager and Evel Kneivel. Most people go to the edge and then stop. Not Sam. He'd see the edge and then just keep going. And I think that scream he was famous for was just the sound he made on the way down.\n\n-Robin Williams\n\nWe would jam at Spice all the time, and Sam would intentionally go on out of tune, just to frustrate the other musicians! Sam was a great piano player too. He loved Paul McCartney, and no one could do Paul like Sam could. He'd sing and play and, I swear, something came over him.\n\n-C.C. DeVille, Poison\n\nHe hated to even hear the word religion, but he was definately a man who loved God. He had a cross inside the lining of that long coat he used to wear. It was no joke to him.\n\n-Jessica Hahn\n\nRIP Sam.You are missed.~Raggedy"
