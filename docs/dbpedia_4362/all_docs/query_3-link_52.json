        "text": "Preacher-turned-bawdy comic Sam Kinison was killed and his wife was seriously hurt when their car crashed into a pickup truck that swerved in their path on a desert highway, state police said Saturday.\n\nThe pickup struck the car head-on Friday evening on a two-lane highway near the California, Nevada and Arizona state lines, killing the 38-year-old comedian, the California Highway Patrol said.\n\nHis bride of six days, Malika, 27, was hospitalized with a concussion. Her injuries were not life-threatening, Kinison publicist Debbie Baker said.\n\nThe 17-year-old driver of the pickup was arrested and booked for investigation of vehicular manslaughter, the Highway Patrol said. He wasn't injured.\n\nThe Kinisons, who were married last Sunday in Las Vegas, had just returned from a Hawaii honeymoon. They were driving to a hotel-casino in Laughlin, Nev., where Kinison was to open Friday night.\n\n\"They hadn't been married even a week, and I saw him standing there at the chapel with tears in his eyes because he was so happy. His life was really on an upswing,\" said Florence Troutman, a Kinison publicist.\n\nThe teen-ager drove at high speed over the double-yellow line on U.S. 95 to pass traffic moments before the collision, the Highway Patrol said.\n\nKnown for his primal yowl, Kinison proclaimed himself a rock 'n' roll comedian with his profane, blunt and loud-mouth stage character who screamed his way through such topics as Christ's last words, starvation in Ethiopia, and the evils of women.\n\nHomosexual and women's groups often objected to his material.\n\nHe recorded a popular version of the song Wild Thing, which included a music video featuring Jessica Hahn, whose sexual tryst with evangelist Jim Bakker triggered the collapse of his PTL empire.\n\nIn addition to comedy albums and nightclub performances, Kinison was seen on television as a host of Saturday Night Live, and he appeared on Late Night With David Letterman and The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson. Most recently, he co-starred on the Fox network comedy Charlie Hoover.\n\nKinison was a Pentecostal minister but left the ministry after a divorce."
