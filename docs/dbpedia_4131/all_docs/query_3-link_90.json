        "text": "Sir John Sulston, who has died aged 75, won (jointly with Sydney Brenner and Robert Horvitz) the 2002 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for the decades of work he spent studying the genetic make-up of Caenorhabditis elegans, a tiny nematode worm; to the public he was better known for the leading role he played in decoding the human genome.\n\nHe was an unlikely scientific genius. Almost as self-effacing as the worm itself (among his recreations Sulston listed “avoiding people”), his student career had been undistinguished and he fell into research by accident. Yet he went on to become a high-profile opponent of the patenting of genome sequencing for commercial gain.\n\nSulston’s painstaking examination of the life cycle of the worm, from egg to adult, showed that the growth and, equally important, the programmed death of the hundreds of cells in the developing worm was a key to understanding the same processes in the human body.\n\nIt was the South African-born Brenner who first had the idea of studying the nematode to understand how genes control development. The transparent worm, only one millimetre long and with a life span of three days, could be kept in a Petri dish chomping its way through e-coli bacteria and easily viewed through a microscope.\n\nIn the 1970s Sulston extended and developed Brenner’s techniques to study every cell division from the fertilised egg to the mature worm.\n\nHe found that unwanted cells died in the developing worm through a controlled process and that certain cells are programmed to die off as new ones develop, maintaining the total cell number at 959, a process known as apoptosis. He traced the origin and fate of every cell, pioneering the techniques that made it possible to read the human genome.\n\nTen years later Horvitz, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, identified the first so-called “death genes”, necessary to prompt unneeded cells to commit suicide. Subsequent research has shown that most of the genes controlling cell death in the worm have their counterparts in humans.\n\nThe value of this for medical research is incalculable. In diseases such as Aids, neuro-degenerative diseases, stroke and heart attacks, cells are lost because of excessive cell death; other diseases such as cancer are caused by a reduction in cell death leading to the survival of cells that are normally destined to die.\n\nJohn Edward Sulston was born on March 27 1942, the son of an army chaplain and a teacher. His scientific curiosity was evident from childhood, although he did not shine academically. From Merchant Taylors’ School he went on to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he scraped a 2:1 in Organic Chemistry.\n\nAfter graduation, he decided to abandon a career in science and go overseas to work for VSO, but the idea came to nothing and he wandered along to the university’s chemistry laboratories and asked about becoming a research student. It was the 1960s, when universities were expanding, and they let him in.\n\nHe found himself doing a doctorate in the manufacture of nucleotides – the chemical chunks that carry information in DNA and RNA, and was hooked. At the end of his doctorate he moved to the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California to study prebiotic chemistry (the origins of life on Earth) under Leslie Orgel.\n\nWhen he returned to Cambridge in 1969 to work with Brenner at the MRC Laboratory, he was rather put out to find that he was only given a metre-wide stretch of working space – something of a come-down after the Salk Institute.\n\nBut, as he recalled, Brenner and Francis Crick, joint heads of the laboratory at the time, “believed that keeping the lab tightly packed encouraged people to interactivity and that desks encouraged time-wasting activities”.\n\nScientific opinion held that nematode worms hatched with all the cells they would ever need, but Sulston soon discovered that one part of the newly-hatched larva had only 15 nerve cells, whereas the adult had 57. So he placed a larval worm on a dab of bacteria and settled down to watch the innards of the worm developing. Soon enough, 10 new nerve cells swam into his field of vision.\n\nWithin two years, Sulston and two colleagues had mapped the development of every cell in the adult worm, so they could tell precisely how it grew from the moment of hatching. But it was the next stage that really made his name. Because the worm is transparent, it is theoretically possible to watch the embryos as they grow inside transparent eggs, but scientists had been unable to work out how.\n\nHalf way through he nearly gave up: “I had achieved little so far as I could see and felt it was high time to move on and do something different with my life.” But he went back to the laboratory and at the end he had tracked every cell that was born and died in the 14 hours that a worm’s egg is growing.\n\nBy choosing one cell at a time and watching it grow and divide, drawing the results on paper beside the microscope, he made a complete map of the cellular development of C elegans.\n\nSulston decided that his next task was to make a physical map of the worm’s DNA. Working with Alan Coulson, he broke the DNA into 17,000 overlapping fragments, all being grown inside bacteria. Then he had to identify all the different fragments and see how they overlapped.\n\nIn 1989, Sulston, Coulson and Bob Waterston, their American collaborator, showed the progress of their map as a wallchart a yard long.\n\nThe chart attracted the attention of Jim Watson, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, who was then running the human genome project in America. He was convinced that Sulston and Waterston were the people to take the project forward, because they had got further than any of the rival projects working on things such as fruit flies.\n\nIn 1992 Sulston and Waterston were offered large sums of money by an American businessman to move to Seattle and work on the human genome, the money to be recovered with the profits from patenting their discoveries.\n\nSulston, though, believed passionately that the information in genome sequences must be freely available and that it is morally and scientifically wrong to patent human gene sequences.\n\nLuckily, at this point the Wellcome Trust came up with £50 million to fund the continuing worm research and to build a huge new centre, the Sanger Centre, in the grounds of Hinxton Hall, outside Cambridge, where the British arm of the human genome project could be housed.\n\nWatson, who had urged the Wellcome Trust to do this, lost his job after accusations that he had damaged American commercial interests. But when the excitement died down Sulston, as head of the new centre, and Waterston, in St Louis, had become the champions of publicly funded and publicly accessible research on the human genome. In 1998 the two men completed the sequencing of the worm genome.\n\nThis approach came into its own in late October 2000, when the River Cam overflowed into the basement. Within two days the equipment had been relocated and was beginning to churn out human DNA sequences once more.\n\nSanger fought hard to ensure that the information was made publicly accessible. Results were published on the internet every day, as data became available.\n\nThe entry of a private competitor, Celera Genomics, into the genome-sequencing arena catapulted Sulston unexpectedly into the limelight and he found himself regularly speaking up for the project on Newsnight and on the Today programme, while The Observer placed him among the country’s 100 most powerful people.\n\nAlthough he disliked the way that the media distorted the science involved, he recognised that he could capitalise on the publicity by emphasising the benefits that the project could bring.\n\nIn 2001, the human genome sequence of 3 billion “letters” was published to great acclaim. As a result of Sulston’s stand, most of the information is freely available to scientists around the world.\n\nA bearded, sandal-wearing, self-professed “child of the Sixties”, Sulston remained a modest man, uninterested in material things. His colleagues recalled him arguing passionately in the 1970s that it was absurd for scientists to be paid more than dustmen, because they enjoyed their work.\n\nHe lived in the same house for decades and, even when running the Sanger Centre, would ride into work, and later down to the pub, on a bike.\n\nSulston was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1986. He stepped down as director of the Sanger Centre in 2000. Two years later he published The Common Thread (co-written with Georgina Ferry), a lively account of the search for the genome and the controversies surrounding it.\n\nHe was knighted in 2001 and appointed a Companion of Honour in 2017.\n\nJohn Sulston married, in 1966, Daphne Bate, who survives him with their son and daughter.\n\nSir John Sulston, born March 27 1942, died March 6 2018"
