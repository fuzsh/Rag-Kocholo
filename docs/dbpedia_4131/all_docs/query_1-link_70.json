        "text": "Nobel Prize Winners\n\nOne single building for vaccination treatment and research work, and where Pasteur and his family were housed, began the humble beginnings of the Institut Pasteur in 1887. There were initially five \"microbial\" departments where five scientists with very different training and personalities gathered around Pasteur to learn and tackle the mysteries of disease. This same community of scientists -- Pasteurians -- who, after having trained at the Institut Pasteur, were scattered across the globe to study and work on discovering better treatments, therapies, and cures for all of society. They, in turn, established the International Network which today still operates on the principles originally taught in Paris. For their efforts in changing the course of discovery, and improving and saving lives, Institut Pasteur scientists have been awarded 10 Nobel Prizes since 1900. Here are their stories.\n\nFrançoise Barré-Sinoussi, 2008\n\nLuc Montagnier, 2008\n\nFrançois Jacob, 1965\n\nAndré Lwoff, 1965\n\nJacques Monod, 1965\n\nDaniel Bovet, 1957\n\nCharles Jules Henri Nicolle, 1928\n\nJules Bordet: 1919\n\nIlya Metchnikoff, 1908\n\nCharles Louis Alphonse Laveran, 1907\n\nLuc Montagnier\n\nNobel Lecture, December 8, 2008\n\n25 Years After HIV Discovery: Prospects for Cure and Vaccine\n\nThe impressive advances in our scientific knowledge during the last century allow us to have a much better vision of our origin on earth and our situation in the universe than our ancestors. Life probably started on earth around three and a half billion of years ago, and a genetic memory emerged early, based on an extraordinarily stable molecule, the DNA double helix, bearing a genetic code identical for all living organisms, from bacteria to men. We are thus the heirs of myriads of molecular inventions, which have accumu- lated over millions – sometime billions – of years. Environmental pressure has of course both maintained these inventions and also modulated them over the generations, through the deaths of individuals and sexual reproduc- tion. For the last 30,000 years, our biological constitution has not changed: a hypertrophic cortical brain, a larynx to speak and a hand to manipulate. But for the last 10,000 years, another memory has emerged, which make our species quite different from the others: this is the cultural memory which transmits knowledge and societal organisation from generation to genera- tion, through the use of language, writing and more recently virtual means of communication.\n\nWatch a video of his lecture.\n\nFrançois Jacob\n\nNobel Lecture, December 11, 1963\n\nInteraction among Virus, Cell, and Organism\n\nAn organism is an integrated system of interdependent structures and functions. An organism is constituted of cells, and a cell consists of molecules which must work in harmony. Each molecule must know what the others are doing. Each one must be capable of receiving messages and must be sufficiently disciplined to obey. You are familiar with the laws which control regulation. You know how our ideas have developed and how the most harmonious and sound of them have been fused into a conceptual whole which is the very foundation of biology and confers on it its unity.\n\nFor the philosopher, order is the entirety of repetitions manifested, in the form of types or of laws, by perceived objects. Order is an intelligible relation. For the biologist, order is a sequence in space and time. However, according to Plato, all things arise out of their opposites. Order was born of the original disorder, and the long evolution responsible for the present biological order necessarily had to engender disorder.\n\nAndré Lwoff:\n\nNobel Lecture, December 11, 1963\n\nInteraction among Virus, Cell, and Organism\n\nAn organism is a molecular society, and biological order is a kind of social order. Social order is opposed to revolution, which is an abrupt change of order, and to anarchy, which is the absence of order.\n\nI am presenting here today both revolution and anarchy, for which I am fortunately not the only one responsible. However, anarchy cannot survive and prosper except in an ordered society, and revolution becomes sooner or later the new order. Viruses have not failed to follow the general law. They are strict parasites which, born of disorder, have created a very remarkable new order to ensure their own perpetuation.\n\nDaniel Bovet\n\nNobel Lecture, December 11, 1957\n\nThe relationships between isosterism and competitive phenomena in the field of drug therapy of the autonomic nervous system and that of the neuromuscular transmission\n\nPutting to good use the vast possibilities which organic synthesis offers, a number of workers have directed their efforts towards applying it to therapeutics, and have sought to establish the bases of a science of pharmaceutical chemistry, or, more exactly perhaps, the bases of a science of chemical pharmacology worthy of this name. If such an ambitious programme has not yet been fully realized, we are at least justified in recognizing, in the work which has now been in progress for fifty years, the appearance of a few guiding principles whose value has not ceased to assert itself. This is particularly true, for example, in the case of ideas in isosterism and competition.\n\nRead whole lecture.\n\nCharles Jules Henri Nicolle\n\nNobel Lecture\n\nInvestigations on Typhus\n\nI am going to give you an account of how I arrived at the results for which I have received the Nobel Prize for Medicine. I shall also summarize these results.\n\nIt did not seem likely that I was destined to undertake research on typhus. I was born, first studied medicine and undertook my first research work in a French province from which typhus had disappeared since 1814. It is true that I came across a few imported cases at Rouen in 1889. They made no particular impression on me.\n\nRead whole lecture."
