        "text": "Nobel Prize Winners\n\nWashington University and the School of Medicine have a long tradition of pursuing novel approaches and expanding the bounds of what is known.\n\nAt the School of Medicine, this tradition has roots in the vision of university board member Robert S. Brookings, who in 1909 was determined to transform the medical school into a model for American medical education and research. Among the first recruits to this “modern medical school” was Joseph Erlanger, who Brookings appointed head of the physiology department in 1910. Three decades later, Erlanger won a Nobel prize.\n\nTo date, 19 Nobel laureates have ties to the School of Medicine, and the tradition continues. With an ever-growing infrastructure that supports collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship, we equip our outstanding faculty, students and trainees with the resources to pursue discoveries that may shape science and medicine for generations to come.\n\n1927: Arthur H.
