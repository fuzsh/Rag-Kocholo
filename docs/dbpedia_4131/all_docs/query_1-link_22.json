        "text": "Discovered that B cells orchestrate the inflammation of myelin that causes multiple sclerosis, leading to a new B-cell targeting therapy that is effective for both relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms of the disease. (Stephen Hauser, MD, 2008 and 2016)\n\nIdentified receptors in cells of the peripheral nervous system that play key roles in the body’s ability to sense heat and cold, providing major insights into how the body experiences pain – findings that are valuable for development of pain therapeutics. (David Julius, PhD, 2002 and 1997)\n\nDetermined that chronic pain is a medical condition and not just a symptom, leading to improved strategies of management. (Christine Miaskowski, RN, PhD, 2001)\n\nDiscovered genes that can double the lifespan of the roundworm C. elegans. These genes encode components of a conserved hormone signaling pathway, and have now been linked to exceptional longevity in flies and mammals, including humans. (Cynthia Kenyon, PhD, 1993)\n\nDiscovered the regulatory machinery of the \"unfolded protein response,\" a signaling pathway that controls protein folding in the cell. Improper protein folding is the biological basis for numerous diseases, including cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. (Peter Walter, PhD, 1993)\n\nIdentified oral lesions as one of the first signs of AIDS, leading to major research breakthroughs in the oral aspects of AIDS and the role of viruses in oral lesions. (John Greenspan, BDS, PhD; and Deborah Greenspan, BDS, DSc, 1984)\n\nCo-discovered the AIDS virus – known as HIV, human immunodeficiency virus – originally calling it AIDS-related retrovirus (Jay Levy, MD, 1983), and discovered that the virus could be transmitted through blood transfusions, leading to new methods of screening donors. (Arthur Ammann, MD; Diane Wara, MD; and Morton Cowan, MD, 1982)\n\nCo-discovered embryonic stem cells in mice and coined the term embryonic stem cells, laying the groundwork for worldwide research on human embryonic stem cells to treat disease. (Gail Martin, PhD, 1981)\n\nReported for the first time that elevated blood sugar caused abnormal structures in cells, helping to pioneer the intensive glucose control strategies now used throughout the world for managing diabetes. (John Karam, MD, and Gerold Grodsky, PhD, 1980)\n\nIsolated the gene for insulin, leading to the mass production of genetically engineered insulin to treat diabetes. This was recognized as the first major triumph using recombinant DNA technology. Later, discovered the recombinant DNA techniques that led to the creation of the hepatitis B vaccine. (William Rutter, PhD, 1978, 1981)\n\nDiscovered that a missing protein called surfactant is the culprit in the deaths of newborns with respiratory distress syndrome. This led to development of a synthetic substitute for surfactant, reducing infant death rates significantly. (John Clements, MD; William Tooley, MD; and Roderic Phibbs, MD, 1961 – 1980)\n\nCreated the first recombinant organism through DNA splicing, an achievement that spawned the entire biotechnology industry and has led to development of numerous lifesaving treatments. (Herbert Boyer, PhD, with colleague Stanley Cohen of Stanford University, 1973)\n\nFirst to link obesity to type 2 diabetes, a finding that resulted in revolutionary changes in diabetes treatment and prevention. (John Karam, MD; and Gerold Grodsky, PhD, 1963)\n\nDiscovered vitamin E. (Herbert Evans, MD, during the period when the basic science departments were based at UC Berkeley, 1923)\n\nConducted initial studies on liver metabolism and the relationship between the liver and blood components, leading to successful treatment of pernicious anemia, a usually fatal form of the disease. (George Whipple, MD, who left UC in 1921, later received the 1934 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this body of research)\n\nLed the world’s first clinical trial using blood stem cells transplanted prior to birth, leading to the live birth of an infant with a normally fatal fetal condition called alpha thalassemia. (Tippi Mackenzie, MD, 2018)\n\nConducted first-ever genome editing inside a human body, aiming to treat a severe inherited disease called mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome. (Paul Harmatz, MD, 2018)\n\nLed a National Academy of Sciences Committee that recommended the creation of an extensive data network to revolutionize medical discovery, diagnosis and treatment, and coined the term “precision medicine.” (Susan Desmond-Hellmann, MD, MPH, and Keith Yamamoto, PhD, 2011)\n\nPioneered techniques in brain mapping to safely remove tumors without harming language and other pathways of the brain. (Mitchel Berger, MD, mid-1990s - 2008)\n\nDeveloped the ViroChip, a microarray that contains DNA from every known virus and a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying previously unknown viruses in both humans and animals. The tool was first used in 2003 to confirm the identity of the virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS. (Joseph DeRisi, PhD, and Don Ganem, MD, 2002)\n\nEstablished the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library to house and maintain tobacco industry internal corporate documents produced during litigation between 46 states and the seven major tobacco industry organizations. Today, the library has more than 80 million pages. (Stanton Glantz, PhD, 2002)\n\nCreated two of the first human embryonic stem cell lines in the world, enabling scientists to study how stem cells might be used to treat such diseases and disorders as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and birth defects. (Roger Pedersen, PhD, 2001)\n\nFirst to use the X-ray structure of HIV protease to identify an inhibitor that effectively blocks the enzyme's activity, the same method used today to design protease inhibitor drugs. (Charles Craik, PhD, 1990)\n\nProduced clear, dramatic images of the soft tissues of the body, using nuclear magnetic resonance (now known as MRI). UCSF researchers went on to direct some of the first clinical placements in the country of devices that provided the images. (Leon Kaufman, PhD, and Larry Crooks, PhD, 1983)\n\nEstablished the first special care units for AIDS patients in 1983 at San Francisco General Hospital, which led to the “San Francisco Model” that is now used worldwide.\n\nPerformed the first successful fetal surgery, which involves correcting a life-threatening birth defect on a still in the mother's womb. (Michael Harrison, MD; Mitchell Golbus, MD; and Roy Filly, MD, 1981)\n\nConducted groundbreaking studies on the importance of gender-based health care research that was instrumental in shaping the field of women's health. (Virginia Olesen, PhD, 1981)\n\nDeveloped a cochlear implant device that enables the deaf to hear. (Michael Merzenich, PhD; Robert Schindler, MD; and Robin Michelson, MD, 1979)\n\nDeveloped the first prenatal tests for inherited blood diseases such as sickle-cell anemia and thalassemia. (Y.W. Kan, MD, DSc, 1976)\n\nPioneered the field of “clinical pharmacy” that positioned pharmacists as active members of the health care team, working side by side with physicians and nurses, and trained as drug therapy specialists rather than simply drug dispensers. (Jere Goyan, PharmD; Eric Owyang, PharmD; Sidney Riegelman, PharmD; and Donald Sorby, PhD, 1966)\n\nFirst university west of the Mississippi to offer a doctoral degree in nursing.\n\nDeveloped basic sterilization and hygiene procedures for the U.S. canning industry to prevent botulism, thereby safeguarding consumers and saving the industry. (Karl F. Meyer, DVM, PhD, 1920s)"
