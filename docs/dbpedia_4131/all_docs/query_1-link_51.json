        "text": "The reason for this has been unequal access to education, technology and leadership positions, which has precluded many brilliant female minds from careers in science and blocked their progress.\n\nThe lack of prizes and acknowledgement is a reflection of the inequality that women too often experience throughout their careers. The gender gap in science, technology and innovations leads to wasted talent and unexploited discoveries. And without visible and recognized female scientists, who set an example and act as role models, young female scientists and researchers can be discouraged from dedicating their lives to scientific research.\n\nFollowing on from the first series of #contagiousstorieswe are dedicating a second series to the 12women who have won the Nobel Prize in Medicine.\n\nSee below timeline for their discoveries.\n\nOur goal is to draw attention to the women who have contributed to the future of medicine and who are still guiding new generations of young women by encouraging empowerment and gender mainstreaming.\n\nEach of them has made a fundamental contribution to research.\n\nLet’s just think about the discovery of artemisinin, the anti-malarial drug developed by the Chinese immunologist Tu Youyou(2015 Nobel Prize), or the research into cellular ageing, which led Elizabeth H. Blackburn and Carol W. Greider (2009 Nobel Prize) to understand how telomeres protect chromosomes from the deterioration of genetic matter.\n\nAs we will see, each of their stories is different. Yet, they have several traits in common.\n\nAudacity: they are not afraid to go down roads never travelled before by their colleagues\n\nBrilliance: they see unexpected connections between phenomena that seem very different\n\nCuriosity: they are interested in seemingly “minor” aspects and create new avenues of research\n\nEnergy: they work enthusiastically and tirelessly, which makes them unstoppable\n\nGenerosity: they know how to work as a team and share their discoveries with their colleagues\n\nPassion: they dream about changing the world and reducing people’s suffering\n\nResilience: they never give up when faced with the difficulties and obstacles they find along their path\n\nTenacity: as young scientists they study a specific area, which they take forward for the rest of their lives"
