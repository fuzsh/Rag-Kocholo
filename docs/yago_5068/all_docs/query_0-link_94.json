        "text": "It’s been more than three quarters of a century since Italy was declared a republic, with its last king, Umberto II, living out the rest of his life in exile in Portugal. A fresh legal battle, however, is now beginning to get underway, as his descendants launch a bid to have the former crown jewels returned to family ownership.\n\nThe Guardian reports that the prized items include more than 6,000 diamonds and 2,000 pearls mounted on tiaras, necklaces and brooches, which were worn by princesses and queens throughout the Italian monarchy’s 85-year history (active from 1861 to 1946). The valuable pieces have been kept in a treasure chest, housed in a safety deposit box at the Bank of Italy, since Umberto II was ousted as king in 1946 – during which time there has been no consensus over their ownership.\n\nUmberto II’s son, Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia, and three daughters, Maria Gabriella, Maria Pia and Maria Beatrice, have launched legal action against the bank after failing to reach an agreement over the return of the jewels, which they maintain should belong to the family. The case is set to begin in earnest this summer, with the first hearing scheduled for 7 June at the court of Rome, according to the siblings’ lawyer, Sergio Orlandi.\n\nOrlandi is quoted in the Guardian as stating: ‘We knew the mediation meeting [with the Bank of Italy] wouldn’t go anywhere but were obliged to have it before [suing the state]... I hope we manage to get the jewels returned, and it will now be up to a judge to establish if the family has the [ownership] rights.’\n\nThe Bank of Italy first obtained the jewels on 5 June 1946, just three days after Italians voted to abolish the monarchy and nine days before Umberto II was exiled from his birth country, after ruling for only 34 days (although he’d been de facto head of state since 1944).\n\nAt the time, Umberto II asked his minister of the Royal House, Falcone Lucifero, to deliver the jewels to the then governor of the bank (and future president of Italy) Luigi Einaudi. The chest is also said to have been accompanied by a note, stipulating that the ‘precious’ jewels should be ‘entrusted to the custody of the central cashier’ and ‘kept at the disposal of those who have right’.\n\nIntended as a temporary measure for safekeeping, the treasures are then thought to have become the only part of the royal estate that wasn’t confiscated by the Italian state when the country became a republic – which it’s thought could help bolster Umberto II’s children’s case.\n\nSubscribe now to get 3 issues of Tatler for just £1, plus free home delivery and free instant access to the digital editions."
