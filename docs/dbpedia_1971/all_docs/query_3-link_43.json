        "text": "Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the Pakistani singer whose thrilling voice carried Sufi devotional songs to the world, died yesterday in London. He was 48.\n\nMr. Khan, who suffered from problems with his liver and his weight, came to London last week for medical and business reasons. He was rushed to the Cromwell Hospital from the airport and later suffered cardiac arrest there, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMr. Khan was the greatest singer of his generation in the genre of qawwali, which means wise or philosophical utterance. Qawwali songs are based on the devotional poetry of Sufism, a mystical branch of Islam, and often speak of being intoxicated by divine love.\n\nThe music seeks to transport listeners, and it works its way to ecstatic peaks with driving rhythms, concise refrains and the spiraling improvisations at which Mr. Khan was unsurpassed. His voice had a raw, impassioned tone and an acrobatic agility. Whether he was repeating a refrain with ever-increasing intensity, streaking through elaborate zigzagging lines, letting loose a percussive fusillade or sustaining a climactic note, he made music that united virtuosity and fervor.\n\nIn Pakistan and across the Islamic world, Mr. Khan was a superstar whose fans danced, shouted, threw money and sometimes hurled one another into the air as he sang. He performed in the traditional style, backed by what is called a party, with harmonium, percussion, handclaps and a responsorial chorus.\n\nBut in the 1980's and 1990's, he also became what Ravi Shankar had been in the 1960's: a major South Asian traditional musician who also collaborated with secular musicians, Eastern and Western, among them Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Peter Gabriel. He was heard on soundtracks of films made in India and Hollywood; he was remixed for dance clubs. In any context, his voice was unforgettable.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
