        "text": "Name: Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan\n\nBorn: 1948\n\nNationality; Pakistani\n\nOccupation; Qawwali singer\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan is considered to have had one of the best voices ever recorded and possessed some of the most impressive vocal capabilities the world has ever seen. Having been performing since the age of 16, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan quickly became one of the world’s most treasured Asian vocalists known to history.\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan came from a family of musicians and continued the 600 year old family tradition of Qawwali. He became head of the family qawwali in 1971 and went on to be successful that he was signed by a recording company, Oriental Star Agencies, in Birmingham in the early 1980s. Many film scores and soundtracks were released all over the world that featured Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Following Nurat’s take over of the family Qawwali party, it became known as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Mujahid Mubarak Ali Khan & Party.\n\nAs the years went by, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan began to perform all over the world but did many of his concerts in the UK, primarily in London. In light of his performances, Nusrat gained a huge audience in the USA and can be heard on the soundtrack to the classic film Dead Man Walking.\n\nUnfortunately, at the time of Nusrat’s untimely death, he was part way through various projects, some of which had to be abandoned, and others were finished by other artists, for example, Alanis Morisette finished some of his unfinished vocals for an album being put together by Jonathan Elias.\n\nAfter his death, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan continues to be an inspiration for musicians all over the world, and his fame has not dwindled. There are many monuments and buildings named in his honour and his legacy only continues to grow."
