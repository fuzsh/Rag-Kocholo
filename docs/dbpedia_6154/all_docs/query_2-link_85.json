Crazy? Or why can't I find it?\n\nBTW no I'm not such a big fan of having to do these sorts of things using a select tool, either.\n\nI think there ought to be a line tool, also..\n\nI mean SURE, I CAN hold the alt-key down, but to an average user, it sure is difficult to find.\n\nMaybe it would be appropriate to include it in the same category as shapes?\n\nA line is a shape.\n\nAttached Files\n\nShapeToolMissing.xcf (Size: 8.81 KB / Downloads: 56)\n\nPixLab\n\nGimper extraordinaire\n\nPosts: 1,416\n\nThreads: 61\n\nJoined: May 2021\n\nReputation: 157\n\nOperating system(s):\n\nLinux\n\nGimp version: 2.10\n\nNo shape tool ➤ OK... something to go with\n\nTo do do straight line, make a dab with a brush tool or the pen tool or any drawing too ➤ then hold the Shift key on your keyboard, than go on the other side of the canvas and make another dab, you got a straight line\n\nTo make a star, I use the Symmetry painting tool, it's not showing up by default, thus go to Windows > Dockable Dialog > Symmetry painting, select Mandala number of point 5 (or whatever up to 100), Same as above make one dab, then hold the Shift key and dab down to the \"opposite\" side on the other point.\n\nResult:\n\n(If you're on a transparent layer, then Alpha to selection, then Select > Remove holes, fill with bucket fill if needed)\n\na circle:\n\nuse the Ellipse tool the go to Edit > Stroke selection\n\nSame for squares and rectangle\n\nLast but not least there is that Gfig things, in Filters > Render > Gfig... which is not really user friendly (I mean no real control on the size), but it makes shapes, many kind of shapes, more about it ➤ here is the official documentation ➤ https://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-gfig.html\n\nPatrice\n\nrich2005\n\nAdministrator\n\nPosts: 6,979\n\nThreads: 153\n\nJoined: Oct 2016\n\nReputation: 988\n\nOperating system(s):\n\nLinux\n\nGimp version: 2.10\n\n(06-18-2024, 11:34 AM)SiriusA Wrote: But I have one question..\n\nWhere's the shape tool?\n\nThe built in shape tool is called gfig see: https://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-gfig.html\n\n**but** it is a very old tool, goes back 20 something years and can be a bit flakey. Find it in Filters -> Render -> Gfig\n\nOtherwise, there are plugins to make shapes, usually via a path. I will attach one for you to play with arakne-path-shape-creator. Unzip and put all the files in your plugins folder. Linux users make the python file(s) executable.\n\nUse a selection to constrain the size of the shape (although that can be adjusted from the plugin) Looks like this.\n\nAttached Files\n\narakne-path-shape-creator6e.zip (Size: 21.95 KB / Downloads: 70)\n\nSiriusA\n\nNewbie\n\nPosts: 3\n\nThreads: 1\n\nJoined: Jun 2024\n\nReputation: 0\n\nOperating system(s):\n\nWindows Vista or 7, 8, 10 (64-bit)\n\nGimp version: 2.10\n\nOkay.\n\nWhile I DO appreciate these answers, all of that looks complicated as ****.\n\nOf course I KNOW that there are ways of making shapes in GIMP (duh-huh).\n\nThis is a bit more of a feature request.\n\nWhat I MEANT, was..\n\nWhy is there not a tool for these specific things?\n\nIs it due to a LEGAL issue?\n\nI think it PROBABLY can't be due to a lack of programming knowledge issue.\n\nI know I can do all of THOSE things but it's very COMPLICATED!\n\nPoint and click..\n\nIf that was one of my software patents I would just license it out to the GIMP team.\n\nThat would save a lot of time and hassle.\n\nIf that's one of mine, consider this to be the license.\n\nMrsP-from-C\n\nJunior Gimper\n\nPosts: 11\n\nThreads: 0\n\nJoined: Mar 2024\n\nReputation: 1\n\nOperating system(s):\n\nLinux\n\nGimp version: 2.10\n\nQuote:Why is there not a tool for these specific things?\n\nBecause up to now, nobody made it.\n\nIt's as simple as that.\n\nThe GIMP devs welcome new contributors who can code such tool.\n\nSiriusA\n\nNewbie\n\nPosts: 3\n\nThreads: 1\n\nJoined: Jun 2024\n\nReputation: 0\n\nOperating system(s):\n\nWindows Vista or 7, 8, 10 (64-bit)\n\nGimp version: 2.10\n\nYou might want to go very simple on this..\n\nLike, consider vectors..\n\nABC and so on..\n\nIf you want to make a five pointed star, you might want to consider it like this..\n\nAzByCzDwEv..\n\nTo make the algorithm as simple as possible.\n\nI right now programmed a bug.
