        "text": "GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a versatile raster graphics editing program\n\nDescription\n\nThe GNU Image Manipulation Program, more commonly known as GIMP, is a versatile, full-featured image-editing package that is commonly used for photo editing and retouching. GIMP is released under the GNU General Public License, making it free software (also known as open-source software), a type of software that protects the freedoms of the end user to share, modify, and copy the program.[1] GIMP offers a feature set comparable in many ways with proprietary software offered by Adobe and others. Combined with other free software tools such as UFRaw[2] and gThumb,[3] GIMP is an essential part of the digital photography workflow for photographers who wish to avoid the license restrictions of proprietary software, and indeed the financial cost of most proprietary software.\n\nGIMP is included as standard software in various major GNU/Linux distributions, including RedHat Fedora.[4] It has been dropped from Ubuntu (because GIMP targets advanced users while Ubuntu itself is designed to be palatable for beginners);[5] however, it can easily be installed for Ubuntu.[6]\n\nAvailable platforms include:\n\nGNU/Linux (i386, PPC)\n\nMicrosoft Windows (XP, Vista, Windows 7)\n\nMac OS X\n\nSun OpenSolaris\n\nFreeBSD\n\nFeatures\n\nFeatures of GIMP are comparable with other versatile photo editing tools. A sampling of features that may be of interest to photographers include:\n\nCorrections for perspective\n\nCorrections for lens barrel distortion\n\nSupport for most common raster image formats\n\nPlug-in support for most RAW image formats\n\nTransformation tools (e.g. rotate, scale, shear, flip)\n\nFull alpha channel support\n\nFull suite of anti-aliased painting tools\n\nFull suite of selection tools\n\nCustom brushes and patterns\n\nForeground extraction tool\n\nPowerful gradient editor and blend tool\n\nMultiple undo/redo\n\nEditable text layers\n\nSVG path import/export\n\nAdvanced scripting capabilities with a huge library of community developed filters and scripts\n\nFeatures often cited as absent from GIMP but offered by Adobe Photoshop are non-destructive editing and high bit-depth support. Both are now provided by the Generic Graphics Library (GEGL), which is being integrated into GIMP and should be generally available in version 2.8. The GEGL library will also eventually provide GPU-side rendering through OpenCL support.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1995 Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis developed the General Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) at the University of California, Berkeley; the first public release of GIMP was v0.54 in 1996.[7] The Free Software Foundation adopted GIMP as part of the GNU Project in 1997, changing the name to \"GNU Image Manipulation Program\". GIMP is developed as part of GNU's GNOME project primarily by volunteers. The graphic user interface software layer developed for GIMP, known as the GIMP Tool Kit (GTK), was adopted by GNOME as the foundation of the standard GNU/Linux desktop user interface.\"[8]\n\nThe GNU GPL makes it easy for programmers to create forks and variants of GIMP that better suit their needs, leading to a variety of derived applications. The most famous of these is CinePaint (previously called Film GIMP), which became widely used for motion picture visual effects and animation, including well-known films such as the Harry Potter series, The Last Samurai, and The Lord of the Rings.[9][10]\n\nNotes"
