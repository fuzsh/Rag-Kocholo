        "text": "Just out of curiosity I decided to do some calculations about 8 bit vs 16 bit, and what I discovered surprised me.\n\nA standard 8 bit image stores 8 bits for each of the either three or four channels. As only three of the possible four channels are useful for photography I will discuss only the R,G, and B channels. 8 bits gives you 256 possible values for each channel. Now most of you are probably aware of this, but using the three channels which cameras can capture this gives you 16,777,216 or over 16.5 million possible unique colors. If you add the alpha channel this number rises to 4,294,967,296 or over 4 billion colors.\n\nIf you are talking 16 bit per channel you have 65,536 values per channel. For a photographer this gives you 281,474,976,710,656 or more than 281 trillion possible colors (assuming there are any cameras that can capture true 16 bit color). If you add the alpha channel you can store 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 values. I'm not quite sure what the name of this number is , but it is quite large enough for anything .\n\nI personally don't know how many color values a camera is able to capture, but I don't think that it comes even close to the possible values 16 bit color is able to store.\n\n-Sonic\n\nI've been dual booting Windows and Slackware Linux for the past 8 or 9 years. I like GIMP, but I was not coming at it from the perspective of a long time Photoshop user (I've only been serious about photography for a little over a year). Those used to Photoshop have a difficult time with GIMP for a variety of reasons. The multi-window layout is bad enough, but the naming convention and layout of commonly used photographic tools is different enough to drive one nuts at first. Many don't commit to the learning curve and run screaming from the building before giving GIMP the chance it deserves. I hit the 8 bit limit in both GIMP and Elements, but I seem to be OK working with 8 bit TIFs.\n\nOne tool I love in Linux (if you go that route) is the KDE application digiKam. There is a Windows port for the 1.7.0 version, but it's very buggy so I don't recommend it on Windows other than to install for a peek at the interface. I would call it a Lightroom clone that uses your own directory structure instead of the library system. http://www.digikam.org/ I find the digiKam interface more intuitive than Elements, but I think it's more a case of the familiar winning out over the unfamiliar.\n\nI have moved to Windows for most of my workflow due to preferring ViewNX and soon Capture NX2 for RAW processing, but I do bounce between operating systems because I just like doing some thing more in certain programs. As if my workflow wasn't schizophrenic enough\n\nI find GIMP is much faster when running in Linux by the way.\n\nAnother Digikam user\n\nI like the program (and use it for storing/classifying my photos and for 90+% of my editing), but\n\n1- they seem to have trouble to get a decent windows installer and\n\n2- both 1.7.0 and 1.8.0 have nasty bugs in the RAW developer (1.7.0 drops metadata, and 1.8.0 has big issues with post-processing ); there is a 1.9.0 version that has both corrected, but I haven't seen a compiled version so far (and compiling that under windows is not for the faint of heart)\n\nSo, either wait a week or two for the 1.9.0, or 3 months for version 2.0 (which is supposed to have a lot of new functions, we'll see what they are worth)\n\nTo get back to the GIMP, note that it reads 16-bit formats quite well, and that it can do treatments in floating point.\n\nAs for it running faster under Linux, doesn't everything?"
