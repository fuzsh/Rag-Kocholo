But even before I scale them, they look really pixelated no matter what shapes or brush sizes/types I use.\n\nAm I using the wrong tool/technique? Would it be better to try and get one of those pads that you draw on that automatically renders your drawing to a computer screen?\n\nI tried to narrow the question down, but I'm really new to computer graphics and I'm not sure how to pinpoint what the problem is."
