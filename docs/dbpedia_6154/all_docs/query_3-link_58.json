        "text": "john and uwe,\n\nhere, here. i agree whole-heartedly. gimp is a raster (pixel) based program while inkscape is a vector (number) based program which produces \"smooth\" outlines. scribus is a page layout program that handles the job of combining raster images, vector images and text into a neat package that a good print shop can execute a quality finished product of your design.\n\nscribus exports directly to pdf and produces a cmyk file that is \"print ready\". design tools are just that, tools. would use a screw driver to try and pry a nail from a board? you would choose the appropriate tool for the job, correct? even though gimp can be used to design a page, inkscape is a better choice of the two. however, even though inkscape is a good program to use for page design, scribus is better. scribus will allow you to import text from an open document format (open office or libreoffice); it will also allow you to import a .svg (scaleable vector graphic) image or an adobe illustrator image. however, i have found that certain illy files after illustrator 9 will not import. but be not dismayed, illustrator will convert your image to the .svg format for importation.\n\nfor my work flow, i use a raster editor (gimp, photoshop, etc.) to size, color correct, etc. photographs; i use a vector editor (inkscape, illustrator, corel draw, etc.) to produce and size vector drawings and usually export to the .tif format (tif files contain more information than jpeg or png files - most commercial print shops prefer tif files for this reason); and i use a page layout program (scribus, indesign, quark express, etc.) to put the design elements together for the purpose of producing a print ready pdf file that produces a quality finished product.\n\ni need to mention that \"properly\" sizing a raster image is most important. most commercial printers use a certain image resolution for different types of paper and the \"use\" of the image. for instance, a fine art print would be printed at 175 dpi while a newsprint image would be printed at 75-80 dpi. all this depends on the paper used for the job. i usually use 300 dpi for raster images and size the image according to the size i want to produce on the page. most vector images are either 300 or 600 dpi, depending on the program i use to produce them.\n\nscribus will allow you to draw a container for an image and the program can size a large or small image to the container, but a 72 dpi image enlarged by this process will produce an ugly final image on the paper. there are some commercial printers that cannot print a scribus pdf file. since adobe is the \"industry standard\" software they calibrate their printers to adobe. small print shops use corel draw as their standard software. in this case, you can provide a native file with accompanying fonts in the file for printing. for most jobs where i use corel draw, i will convert text to curves so i don't have to provide fonts to the printer. and don't assume a printer knows how to print from a pdf. i have run across one that didn't understand that he didn't have to import my pdf into draw to print it. i guess he didn't know he could print from a pdf viewer to his chosen printer. but i digress. a page layout program is also a type setter. you can kern letters and paragraphs for \"readability\". i'm sure you have seen where some of your letters in a particular font will look closer together than other letters when printed. although raster and vector programs have the same capability, page layout programs do it better, because that's how they are designed.\n\ncolor management is key to the whole process, but that's another conversation all together.\n\nhope this helps.\n\nOn Tue, May 7, 2019 at 7:49 AM Jehan Pagès via gimp-user-list > wrote:\n\nHi!\n\nOn Fri, May 3, 2019 at 10:07 PM Uwe Sassnowski > wrote:\n\n> Hello,\n\n>\n\n> I designed a brochure in gimp with several picture and text levels / > layers.

All this makes realy sense. I now started to work with Scribus. To be honest I had some program crashes (I think because of my unknowingness in the first steps :)) and some color fields are difficult to design. But all in all it is easy to handle. You are right that this seems to be the correct program to make our print material. I made some test pdf's and it looks realy good. It will take some time to be on the same point where I was with gimp. I hope that our printer shop accept the pdf, but I have a good feeling, they are professional. I look forward to my first print. Thank you again! Nice to have such professional help!\n\nWith best regards, Uwe\n\nAm 10.05.2019 um 13:19 schrieb Dwain Alford:\n\njohn and uwe, here, here. i agree whole-heartedly. gimp is a raster (pixel) based program while inkscape is a vector (number) based program which produces \"smooth\" outlines. scribus is a page layout program that handles the job of combining raster images, vector images and text into a neat package that a good print shop can execute a quality finished product of your design.\n\nscribus exports directly to pdf and produces a cmyk file that is \"print ready\". design tools are just that, tools. would use a screw driver to try and pry a nail from a board? you would choose the appropriate tool for the job, correct? even though gimp can be used to design a page, inkscape is a better choice of the two. however, even though inkscape is a good program to use for page design, scribus is better. scribus will allow you to import text from an open document format (open office or libreoffice); it will also allow you to import a .svg (scaleable vector graphic) image or an adobe illustrator image. however, i have found that certain illy files after illustrator 9 will not import. but be not dismayed, illustrator will convert your image to the .svg format for importation.\n\nfor my work flow, i use a raster editor (gimp, photoshop, etc.) to size, color correct, etc. photographs; i use a vector editor (inkscape, illustrator, corel draw, etc.) to produce and size vector drawings and usually export to the .tif format (tif files contain more information than jpeg or png files - most commercial print shops prefer tif files for this reason); and i use a page layout program (scribus, indesign, quark express, etc.) to put the design elements together for the purpose of producing a print ready pdf file that produces a quality finished product.\n\ni need to mention that \"properly\" sizing a raster image is most important. most commercial printers use a certain image resolution for different types of paper and the \"use\" of the image. for instance, a fine art print would be printed at 175 dpi while a newsprint image would be printed at 75-80 dpi. all this depends on the paper used for the job. i usually use 300 dpi for raster images and size the image according to the size i want to produce on the page. most vector images are either 300 or 600 dpi, depending on the program i use to produce them.\n\nscribus will allow you to draw a container for an image and the program can size a large or small image to the container, but a 72 dpi image enlarged by this process will produce an ugly final image on the paper. there are some commercial printers that cannot print a scribus pdf file. since adobe is the \"industry standard\" software they calibrate their printers to adobe. small print shops use corel draw as their standard software. in this case, you can provide a native file with accompanying fonts in the file for printing. for most jobs where i use corel draw, i will convert text to curves so i don't have to provide fonts to the printer. and don't assume a printer knows how to print from a pdf. i have run across one that didn't understand that he didn't have to import my pdf into draw to print it. i guess he didn't know he could print from a pdf viewer to his chosen printer. but i digress. a page layout program is also a type setter. you can kern letters and paragraphs for \"readability\". i'm sure you have seen where some of your letters in a particular font will look closer together than other letters when printed. although raster and vector programs have the same capability, page layout programs do it better, because that's how they are designed.\n\ncolor management is key to the whole process, but that's another conversation all together.\n\nhope this helps.\n\nOn Tue, May 7, 2019 at 7:49 AM Jehan Pagès via gimp-user-list < gimp-user-list@gnome.org> wrote:\n\nHi!\n\nOn Fri, May 3, 2019 at 10:07 PM Uwe Sassnowski wrote:\n\nHello,\n\nI designed a brochure in gimp with several picture and text levels / layers.
