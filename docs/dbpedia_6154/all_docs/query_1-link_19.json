If you’re like me and hate the idea of “renting” software (essentially paying yearly fees to use a software) then you might want to look into alternatives. But will these alternatives be as powerful? Will they get the job done as efficiently as when you use Photoshop? Also, the most important question, will an alternative be costly? All these questions have simple answers. Here are my top free , open source and low cost raster graphics editor alternatives to Adobe Photoshop!\n\nAffintiy Designer\n\nAffinity Designer will show up in the Adobe Illustrator alternatives as well. Currently my favorite design software on the market, Affinity Designer is a powerful raster graphics editor. From custom brushing and artwork to logo design, typography design, icon design and more is available at your fingertips. The best part? Affinity Designer can import PSD Files as well so no resources are lost when you switch over.\n\nCurrently available for both Mac and Windows, Affinity Designer has a one time price of $49.99.\n\nKrita\n\nKrita is another favorite. Krita is an open source raster graphics editor that is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. The software just recently saw a massive update this year causing a surge in popularity. Krita comes packed with a full range of useful tools such as brush stabilizers, pop up color palettes and much more. Not to mention it has an easy to recognize user interface.\n\nAnother great feature is that Krita also supports PSD file imports. I would place this in your top two alternatives because of that fact.\n\nGIMP\n\nGIMP has been around as long as Photoshop (from what I remember). The put off of GIMP is its user interface. Three different floating user interfaces is a bit much to handle in the beginning. Trust me though, it is a pretty powerful software. You are totally able to create custom Icons, labels and artwork once you get past the initial learning curve. One thing I loved about GIMP was its filter gallery which has a few interesting effects.\n\nGIMP is completely open source and available for Linux, Windows and Mac.\n\nCanva\n\nCanva is a neat web tool for designers. Not a complete alternative, but a simple alternative for bloggers and businesses looking to create quick social media images/infographics. Canva is free to use and is web based and also available for iPad.\n\nGravit\n\nGravit is another neat web tool. Although it is web based you are able to export your artwork to your desktop. Gravit is mainly for use with screen design, vector illustration, branding and social media graphics, print design and presentations. This web tool is also free to use.\n\nOverview\n\nIt’s sort of slim pickings, but these alternatives are great. Choose one or choose them all! (Only one requires you to pay up-front) Stay tuned for Adobe Illustrator alternatives!\n\nHappy designing!"
