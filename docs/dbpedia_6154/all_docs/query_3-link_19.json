        "text": "Yes. Use vector-based software, probably in your case Inkscape. https://inkscape.org\n\nIf you want a commercial solution, there are probably 3 main options, Illustrator, Corel Draw, and Affinity design.\n\nThis program (depending on how you import them) will maintain the 500x500 pixels side the document, and you can resize them inside, maintaining the 500x500 size. I recommend embedding the raster file, not linking.\n\nThese transformations will happen using another type of resolution, the PPI. So you can scale them, stretch them and squeeze them. The internal raster image will maintain the same number of pixels.\n\nI do not recommend the usage of software like Indesign or Scribus in this case, because these link the original images externally. It is a different workflow.\n\nLet me complement my answer.\n\nA vector-based program allows you to use raster images, even to some extent edit them. You can use them as background, adjust the contrast, make them transparent, put them inside other objects like text, etc. It is the proper way to do banners, posters, and magazine covers; most of them use photos, digital paintings, 3D renders, etc.\n\nThere are a few things you need to complement using a raster program, like masking retouching a skin for a portrait, and detailed work IN the image itself. But a vector-based program is the center of most of the design processes.\n\nThe only exception is long publications like a book or a complete magazine, at the center is Desktop publishing software."
