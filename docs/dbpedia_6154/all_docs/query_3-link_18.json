Adobe Reader has no problem displaying a vectorized image, which seems to imply that the PDF file is vectorized, but when I open it with GIMP, it's rasterized. I can't figure out how to make it display as a vectorized image.\n\nIs it possible to make GIMP show the vectorized PDF, rather than a rasterized version?\n\nHere's the vectorized Adobe Reader image:\n\nAnd here's the rasterized GIMP rendition:"
