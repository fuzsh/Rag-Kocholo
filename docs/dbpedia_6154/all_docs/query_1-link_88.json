The designers use Photoshop for photo editing, image retouching, image manipulation, photo restoring, image masking, creative designing, and a lot more other services.\n\nGIMP\n\nGIMP stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program which is an open-source and free photo editing and retouching software.

As it contains numerous editing tools and advanced features, it serves the highest for bringing a professional touch to your works. You will never regret spending money on Photoshop. It even has a Smartphone version. So, choose it if budget is not an issue for you and you need professional standard features for editing and designing.\n\nWhen to Choose GIMP?\n\nIf you are someone who likes to edit photos for personal purposes, then GIMP is the best match. It also has many advanced features but unlike Photoshop, they are not of high- quality. You can get to know many features but using them in professional work is not recommended. Not to forget, it is free software. Another thing to consider is- that GIMP is very light and does not take up a lot of space, so you can use it on your laptop. In a word, keep GIMP handy for quick editing and the sake of a hobby.\n\nSpecialties in Photoshop\n\nPhotoshop offers RGB colors (Red, Green, and Blue) and CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key/Black).\n\nHigh-quality professional standard photo editing features are available.\n\nThe company provides excellent customer support.\n\nYou can learn using Photoshop from thousands of tutorials\n\nEasy photo transferring to Adobe Lightroom\n\nA mobile version is available\n\nSpecialties in GIMP\n\nSupports PSD files\n\nSupports multiple programming languages\n\nProvides a good amount of editing features free of cost\n\nProvides full-screen preview option of having a final check\n\nDorset effect (picture within a picture) available\n\nBest for batch processing\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros of Photoshop\n\nTurns ordinary images into a professional ones\n\nMany editing tools and features\n\nSupports high-quality graphic design\n\ncan create passport size and stamp size photos\n\nNumerous ready to use templates\n\nGreeting cards, birthday cards can be made\n\nPhoto retouching is easier and professional-quality\n\nmobile version available\n\nCan create social media-friendly photos with the advanced photo editing tools\n\nCons of Photoshop\n\nNot beginner-friendly\n\nRequires high-quality hardware\n\nNot free of cost even expensive\n\nDoes not support vector graphics\n\nOnly an experienced one can take full advantage of Photoshop\n\nTakes a lot of space to run\n\nPros of GIMP\n\nGIMP is free and open-source software\n\nDoes not take much space\n\nDoes not require heavy-duty hardware\n\nUser friendly\n\nContains a lot of advanced features\n\nPhotoshop files are supported\n\nAvailable on Linux\n\nCons of GIMP\n\nDoes not have a mobile version\n\nIt is not suitable for professional photo editing\n\nIt has limited 3rd party plugins\n\nNot good for multiple layer image editing\n\nGIMP and Photoshop Pricing\n\nAs we have said earlier, Photoshop is not free. You can choose different packs according to your requirement. For single-use, it costs $20.99 per month. You can buy a yearly pack that costs $289.88 per year. You need to repurchase it every year. Without paying for it, you will lose your access to the software.\n\nOn the other hand, GIMP is entirely free of cost. You can just download and use it throughout the time. To upgrade, you also do not require money.\n\nPhotoshop vs GIMP: To Wrap Up\n\nThere is no wonder that Photoshop wins over GIMP for its special features and advanced tools. But it is the only thing to consider? Certainly, not. As everyone’s requirement is different, it is not wise to tag something as “best”. If you need professional-quality features and advanced tools, choose Photoshop. If you don’t mind spending money on high-quality editing tools, go for Photoshop.\n\nGIMP also has many special features and advanced tools for photo editing. As it is lightweight and comes free, it is worth choosing for small business runners or personal purposes.\n\nSome Important FAQs\n\nLet’s have a look at some of the most searched queries along with their best possible answers regarding the fact Photoshop vs GIMP.\n\nIs GIMP just as good as Photoshop?\n\nGIMP is a powerful free and open-source image editing software that can perform many of the same functions as Adobe Photoshop, such as layering, photo retouching, and color correction. However, Photoshop offers more advanced features and a more refined user interface, making it the preferred choice for professional graphic designers and photographers.\n\nDo professionals use GIMP?\n\nWhile GIMP is a powerful and versatile image editing software, it is not as widely used by professionals in the graphic design and photography industries as Adobe Photoshop. This is partly because Photoshop offers a more comprehensive set of features and tools that are specifically designed for professional workflows. Additionally, many businesses and clients require designers and photographers to work with Photoshop files, which may not be compatible with GIMP.\n\nCan GIMP replace Photoshop?\n\nWhile GIMP can perform many of the same functions as Adobe Photoshop, it may not be a complete replacement for all users. Especially for professional designers and photographers who require advanced features and support for Photoshop file formats. However, Photoshop offers a more refined user interface, advanced features such as 3D modeling, advanced typography, and seamless integration with other Adobe products like Illustrator and InDesign. As a result, it makes Photoshop the preferred choice for many professional designers and photographers.\n\nWhat can Photoshop do that GIMP cant?\n\nAdobe Photoshop offers advanced features for typography, including the ability to create and edit vector-based text, apply text effects, and control kerning and leading. Also, it provides seamless integration with other Adobe products, making it easier for users to work across multiple programs.\n\nIn addition, Photoshop offers support for a wide range of file formats, including RAW, which is commonly used by professional photographers. These features and capabilities make Photoshop the preferred choice for many professional designers and photographers who require a complete and powerful image editing solution."
