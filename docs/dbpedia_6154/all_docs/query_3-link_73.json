        "text": "Do you think Photoshop is too expensive, but need help editing image assets for your website, social media or anything else? GIMP is a great software you can use! Alternately I've heard of some having success aggressively haggling online Photoshop customer service representatives into a lower rate, but I think just using GIMP for your photo editing needs may involve significantly less conflict.\n\nGIMP is a free and open-source raster graphics editor used for image manipulation and image editing. You can download it here:\n\nWe'll show you how to figure out image specs and uses GIMP to edit your photo assets.\n\nFinding Image Specs\n\nAs an example â€” let's find the specs for a banner image on Twitter using developer tools in our browser.\n\nRight click over the image and select \"Inspect\" to open developer tools and grab the \"intrinsic size\" which is 600 x 200 px in this example:\n\nHere you will find the rendered size and intrinsic size. The intrinsic size is the size of the image when it was uploaded, so that is what we'll use. The rendered size is after CSS (styling) was applied.\n\nGetting started with GIMP\n\nYou can use GIMP to resize and edit your images. In this example we need to resize a banner to 600 x 200 px.\n\nAs you are likely aware many of these sites will auto resize the images for you, but it doesn't always look very good, so a good way to control how the image actually appears is to create or resize the image with these specs in mind.\n\nGIMP has excellent documentation, and will show you everything else you need to know to resize your image and more here:"
