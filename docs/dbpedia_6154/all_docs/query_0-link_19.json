        "text": "Gimp¶\n\nIntroduction¶\n\nGimp ( for GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free and open-source raster graphics editor used for image retouching and editing, free-form drawing, converting between different image formats, and more specialized tasks.\n\nGIMP is released under GPLv3+ licenses and is available for Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nIt is very similar to other raster software like Photoshop.\n\nPresentation of the goal¶\n\nI took a drawing that I’ve made for my robotic team and I will use two software to correct and colorize this drawing in order to make some print on tee-shirt. So I will use :\n\nGimp to assemble and correct the drawing\n\nInkscape too colorize and add effect on the drawing\n\nI will talk about Inkscape in the dedicated pages.\n\nMy work¶\n\nPreparation¶\n\nSo first, I took photos of my drawing and of all the elements. I’ve draw elements separately so I can focus on the details, and I will assemble them after.\n\nMain character Speech bubble Pipe Space station\n\nAssemble / erasure¶\n\nThe first step in gimp is to import all the separated drawings and assemble them into only one drawing. After that, I has to erase some parts of the drawing to clean it up.\n\nAssemble Select Invert & erase\n\nSelect Invert & erase Finally use the rubber\n\nAdjust colors, black and white¶\n\nAdjust color levels Remove the gray Strengthen the blacks\n\nResults¶\n\nTada ! I’ve now a great result that I can use to add color in Inkscape !\n\nNow, the rest of my work is on the Inkscape page."
