        "text": "Choosing the right image file types might seem like a trivial decision.\n\nBut human beings are visual creatures, and images are an integral part of the online experience.\n\nMost pages and articles use screenshots and images to enrich the text content. In fact, only around 8% of websites don’t include any visual content.\n\nUnfortunately, many website owners still don’t understand which image file types to choose for different use cases. The result? They end up slowing down their site loading speed because their images aren’t the best format available, nor are optimized.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover all the most important image file extensions and when you should use them to provide the best possible user experience to your visitors.\n\nWhat Are the Different Image File Types?\n\nImage file types and formats are divided into two main different categories: raster image files and vector image files.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each category.\n\nRaster Image File Formats\n\nThe most common image formats for the web (JPEG, GIF, and PNG) are all under the raster category.\n\nRaster image file types display static images where every pixel has a defined color, position, and proportion based on their resolution (for example 1280×720).\n\nSince they’re static, you cannot efficiently resize the images, the original design and pixels will simply get stretched to fill the extra space. This ends up creating a blurry, pixelated, or otherwise distorted image.\n\nThe vast majority of the photographs or images you see on the internet use a raster image format.\n\nVector Image File Formats\n\nSVG, EPS, AI, and PDF are examples of vector image file types.\n\nUnlike the static raster image file formats, where each design shape and color is tied to a pixel, these formats are more flexible.\n\nVector graphics instead use a system of lines and curves on a cartesian plane, scaled in comparison to the total area, not any single pixel.\n\nThis means you can endlessly enlarge the original image resolution without any loss in quality or distortion.\n\nAs you can see, the difference between quality when magnified 7x is completely incomparable.\n\nSince the SVG calculates the positions based on a percentage of the total area, and not pixels, there’s no pixelation at all.\n\n15 Most Popular Image File Types\n\nBelow, we cover every major graphic file format, from raster web images, to vectors, to image editing software files.\n\nWe do a deep-dive and cover the pros and cons, browser and OS support, and ideal use cases for each format.\n\n1.JPEG (And JPG) — Joint Photographic Experts Group\n\nJPEG (or JPG) is a raster image file format with lossy compression that makes it suitable for sharing images. JPEGs are “lossy” meaning they reduce file size, but also the quality of the images when you use the format.\n\nJPEG is still one of the most used image file types that you’ll see on the internet because of its compression and virtually universal browser/OS support.\n\nMost social media platforms (like Facebook and Instagram) automatically turn uploaded image files into JPEGs. They also use unique social media image sizes to control the resolution of your photos.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nUniversal browser and OS support.\n\nFairly low file size.\n\nLossy image compression might lead to poor text readability.\n\nBrowser and OS Support\n\nSupported since version 1.0 of all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)\n\nSupported by default by all image viewers and editors of all major operating systems.\n\nUse Cases\n\nGood choice for blog and article images, like interviewee headshots, product images, and more.\n\nDo not use JPEG for infographics with a lot of small text or tutorial screenshots where the text is key.\n\n2. PNG — Portable Network Graphics\n\nPNG is a raster graphics format that supports lossless compression, maintaining detail and contrast between colors.\n\nIn particular, PNG offers much better text readability than JPEG.\n\nThis makes PNG a more popular choice for infographics, banners, screenshots, and other graphics that include both images and text.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nHigher quality (lossless) images and clearly visible text.\n\nLarger file sizes can slow down your website if overused (especially high-resolution images).\n\nBrowser and OS Support\n\nSupported by all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari).\n\nSupported by all major operating systems and their standard image editors.\n\nUse Cases\n\nGood choice for infographics, banners, blog graphics, screenshots, coupons, and other visuals that include text.\n\nDo not use for high-resolution photos, as it will create large files of up to several megabytes.\n\n3. GIF — Graphics Interchange Format\n\nThe GIF is another image file type falling within the raster format. It uses lossless compression but “constrains” the image to 8 bits per pixel and a limited palette of 256 colors.\n\nThe GIF format is most famous (and most used) for animated images because its 8-bit limitation keeps file sizes of animations small and internet-friendly.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nLow file size.\n\nAnimation support.\n\n8-bit limitation leads to limited image quality.\n\nBrowser and OS Support\n\nSupported by all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari).\n\nSupported by all major operating systems and their standard image editors.\n\nUse Cases\n\nUse animated GIFs not just to “spice up content” but demonstrate how to complete tasks in tutorials and guides.\n\nDo not use it if you need greater than 8-bit color images (JPEG supports up to 24-bit).\n\n4. WebP\n\nWebP is an image format developed specifically to provide better lossless and lossy compression of images.\n\nSwitching from JPEG and PNG to WebP can help save server disk space and significant bandwidth, with up to 35% smaller image files for identical quality.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nSmaller files for the same or better image quality.\n\nNot supported by all browsers and image editors.\n\nBrowser and OS Support\n\nGoogle Chrome (Version 17+ for desktop, 25+ for mobile), Firefox (65+), Edge (18+), and Opera (11.0+), support WebP natively. Safari’s planned version 14 will support WebP.\n\nThe format is still not supported by most native OS image editors, but professional options like Photoshop supports WebP.\n\nUse Cases\n\nReplace JPEG and PNG files to save bandwidth and speed up your site. If you’re using WordPress as your preferred CMS software, here’s how to use WebP images in WordPress and deliver other formats to legacy browsers.\n\n5. TIFF\n\nOne format that shouldn’t be missing in this guide to image file types, we have TIFF.\n\nTIFF, which is short for Tagged Image File Format, is a raster image format most commonly used for storing and editing images that will be later used for print.\n\nWhile it does support lossy compression, it’s typically used as a lossless image format. Furthermore, most professional graphics applications that support TIFF (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.) do not use compression. Thus, it’s common for TIFF images to be large in file size.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nHigh-quality files perfect for storage or print publishing.\n\nLarge file size due to typical use with no compression.\n\nLimited browser support.\n\nBrowsers and OS Support\n\nNo major browsers can render a TIFF file without add-ons or extensions.\n\nMainly available as an export format for professional image editing and publishing tools.\n\nUse Cases\n\nStoring and preparing images and graphics for publication.\n\nUsed by many scanners to preserve the quality of scanned documents or pictures.\n\n6. BMP — Bitmap\n\nBitmap (BMP) is a mostly outdated image file format that maps individual pixels with little to no compression. That means BMP files can easily become extremely large and are impractical to store or handle.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nGiant file sizes without noticeable quality gains over formats like WebP, GIF, or PNG.\n\nBrowsers and OS Support\n\nSupported by all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari).\n\nNative support in most default OS image editors, like MS Paint.\n\nUse Cases\n\nIn 2024, there are basically zero legitimate use cases for the BMP image format.\n\n7. HEIF — High Efficiency Image File Format\n\nHEIF, short for High Efficiency Image File Format, is an image format developed by the team behind the MPEG video format to be a direct competitor to JPEG.\n\nIn theory, the compression is almost twice as efficient as JPEG, leading to images of up to double quality with identical file sizes.\n\nIt’s a raster image format, based on pixel mapping, meaning you cannot scale up the images without losing quality.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nGreat quality to file size ratio.\n\nNo browser and limited OS support.\n\nBrowsers and OS Support\n\nNot supported by any major browsers.\n\nNative support in macOS Sierra and iOS 11 and later, but not in their respective Safari versions.\n\nUse Cases\n\nUsed by some newer phones and devices to store photos in higher quality than JPEG files.\n\n8. SVG — Scalable Vector Graphics\n\nThe Scalable Vector Graphics file format, usually referred to as SVG, was developed by W3C as a markup language to render two-dimensional images right within the browser.\n\nIt doesn’t rely on pixels like a raster format, but rather uses XML text to outline shapes and lines in a similar way to how mathematical equations create graphs.\n\nThis means you can scale up SVG images infinitely without any loss of quality.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nSmall file sizes and loss-free scaling for simple illustrations, shapes, and text.\n\nNot an ideal format for images or complex drawings.\n\nBrowsers and OS Support\n\nSupported by all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari).\n\nDefault image editors tend not to support SVG (as it’s not suitable for photographs), but most illustration software support SVG exports.\n\nUse Cases\n\nSVG is the ideal format for logos, icons, simple illustrations, and anything else you want to be freely scalable with your responsive design. If you’re using WordPress, make sure to check out how to enable WordPress SVG support for your website.\n\n9. EPS — Encapsulated Postscript\n\nIn essence, an EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) file is a vector image file used for storing illustrations in Adobe Illustrator and other illustration software like CorelDraw.\n\nLike SVG files, EPS is actually a text-based document that outlines shapes and lines with code, rather than mapping pixels and colors. As a result, EPS files also support lossless scaling.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nLossless scaling.\n\nPrinter support for documents and designs.\n\nBrowsers and OS Support\n\nEPS isn’t a standard web image file format and isn’t supported by any major browsers.\n\nUse Cases\n\nIt’s mostly used for storing, saving, and printing illustrations when working with Adobe Illustrator or other software.\n\n10. PDF — Portable Document Format\n\nYou probably associate PDF with storing, saving, and reading mostly-text based documents. That’s perfectly understandable — document is right there in the name after all.\n\nBut PDF files are actually based on the same PostScript language that powers EPS vector image files and can be used to save images and illustrations as well.\n\nIt’s the image format of choice for storing illustrations, magazine covers, and more for later printing. It’s also the preferred choice for our Kinsta ebooks.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nIndexable and searchable text makes it perfect for in-depth infographics or reports.\n\nCan include links, CTA buttons, and other interactive elements.\n\nLossless scalability.\n\nCannot be included in web content, must be loaded and read as a separate file.\n\nBrowsers and OS Support\n\nSupported by all major browsers, but you are forced to open the PDF as a separate file. (You cannot use PDF files to display images throughout your HTML content.)\n\nSupported as a format by most standard document editors (like MS Word or Google Docs), and illustration software (AI, Inkscape) but not by image editing software.\n\nUse Cases\n\nPDF is the best option if you want to create an interactive visual report or infographic that complements your content. Here’s a nice list of the best PDF viewer plugins for WordPress users.\n\n11. PSD — Photoshop Document\n\nAs the name suggests, the PSD file format is an image format used for saving image documents and works in progress with Adobe Photoshop.\n\nIt’s not a web-safe image format, so it’s not supported by any browsers or standard image viewers or editors.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nAll filters, transparency, paths, and edits are fully customizable and reversible.\n\nLossless image quality.\n\nLarge file sizes.\n\nUse Cases\n\nSaving and storing Photoshop projects before and after they’re completed.\n\n12. AI — Adobe Illustrator Artwork\n\nAI is another image format specifically developed by Adobe to not just save the image, but also the project state.\n\nLike PSD, it’s not meant for use on the web and isn’t supported by any browsers, nor most default image viewers.\n\nUnlike PSD files, you can freely scale AI files without any loss in quality.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nAll strokes, lines, shapes, filters, are customizable and reversible.\n\nScale up or down illustration sizes freely.\n\nLarge file sizes.\n\nUse Cases\n\nSaving and storing Adobe Illustrator projects before and after they’re completed.\n\n13. XCF — eXperimental Computing Facility\n\nXCF, which stands for eXperimental Computing Facility, is an image file type native to the open source image editor GIMP. It’s the equivalent of PSD files and saves paths, transparency, filters, and more.\n\nOnce again, this is a native file type for storing projects and it’s not supported by any browsers or default image viewers.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nAll paths, filters, and shapes are customizable and reversible.\n\nLossless image quality.\n\nLarge file sizes.\n\nUse Cases\n\nSaving and storing GIMP projects before and after they’re completed.\n\n14. INDD — Adobe InDesign Document\n\nThe INDD is a native file type for Adobe InDesign users where you can save project files including page content, styles, swatches, and more.\n\nAlthough sometimes referred to as an image file format, it tends to link to visual elements beyond text.\n\nIt isn’t supported by any browsers or default image viewers, as it’s not a web-safe format.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nStore large, multi-page design projects with customizable elements.\n\nUse Cases\n\nIt’s mainly used by graphic designers and production artists for designing and collaborating on posters, flyers, magazines, pamphlets, and more.\n\n15. Raw Image File Types\n\nRaw image formats are the file types a digital camera uses to store full-quality images for later post-production and editing.\n\nMajor raw image file types by camera maker:\n\nKodak: CR, K25, KDC\n\nCanon: CRW CR2 CR3\n\nEpson: ERF\n\nNikon: NEF NRW\n\nOlympus: ORF\n\nPentax: PEF\n\nPanasonic: RW2\n\nSony: ARW, SRF, SR2\n\nRather than the 256 shades per color channel (8 bit) available in a JPEG file, RAW files offer up to 16,384 shades per color channel (14 bit) in a single picture. That gives you more flexibility when tweaking colors and contrast in post-processing.\n\nRaw images aren’t meant for the web or sharing and aren’t supported by any major browser or image viewer.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nHigher quality pictures with more variability in colors.\n\nGiant image files (a raw file can easily be up to 20 to 40 megabytes).\n\nUse Cases\n\nSaving photos in the highest possible quality for post-processing and editing.\n\nImage File Types FAQs\n\nWhat Are the 3 Common File Types of an Image File?\n\nBased on data related to web usage, the three most common image file types are JPEG, PNG, and SVG.\n\nLet’s examine what makes them so widespread below.\n\n1. PNG: Screenshots, Banners, Infographics, Pictures\n\nSince PNG as a format lends itself better to text inside the image, it’s more often used for screenshots, banners (depending on the banner ad size), and more.\n\nSince it uses lossless compression, it’s also used by designers and photographers to showcase high-quality pictures on their portfolio websites for example.\n\nThese two factors, along with its universal browser and OS support, make it the most popular image file type on the web. PNGs are present on a whopping 77% of websites.\n\n2. JPEG: Pictures\n\nThe lossy compression means that JPEG is a better option to use to showcase pictures throughout your content. The loss in quality is barely visible to the average internet user, and you can save considerable disk space and bandwidth.\n\nThat’s why it’s the second most popular format on the internet, used by almost 72% of websites. Most sites use both PNGs and JPEGs for different purposes.\n\nAs a reminder: There’s no difference between JPG vs JPEG, they’re two different acronyms and file extensions for the same format.\n\n3. SVG: Logos, Icons, and Illustrations\n\nSVG files are scalable vector files that are perfect for icons, logos, graphs, and simple illustrations. The image can even be inserted directly into the page as CSS code.\n\nThat’s why SVGs come in third, used by 27% of websites.\n\nHonorable Mention: Animated GIF Images\n\nWhile rarely the format of choice for static images, GIF has made a comeback as the #1 choice for sharing animations.\n\nAs a result, around 22% of websites use GIFs on their pages, even though they likely use PNGs and JPEGs as their standard formats as well.\n\nWhich Image Format Is the Highest Quality?\n\nRaw image formats are the highest quality but have unreasonably large file sizes of up to hundreds of megabytes.\n\nFor web images, the WebP file format offers 25-35% smaller file sizes than JPEG for the same quality photos, meaning you can upload higher quality images for the same disk space and speed up your site.\n\nHEIF is another JPEG alternative with more efficient compression but isn’t currently supported by any major browsers.\n\nPNG files offer lossless compression, but that means the file sizes will be exceedingly large and slow to load. A single PNG file can often be hundreds of KB or even 1MB+. However, if you take advantage of some tactics like lazy loading (available in core since WordPress 5.5) and a CDN, you could still have a fast site.\n\nWhich File Formats Support Transparency?\n\nThe most common image file types for the web that support transparency are PNG, WebP, GIF, and even SVG.\n\nMost native project image file types like PSD, XCF, and AI also support transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, the popular JPEG image format does not support transparency.\n\nIs PNG Better than JPEG?\n\nThe main difference between PNG and JPEG is that PNG is a lossless image format, while JPEG is a lossy one. This basically means that PNG uses compression techniques without sacrificing the original quality or detail of the image.\n\nFor text in images, tutorial screenshots, and when you want signs or other fine elements to be 100% visible in a photo, PNG is the right format.\n\nAs you can see from this funny picture above, PNG, which is depicted on the left, is much better at clearly displaying text and simple shapes when compared to JPEG, the one on the right.\n\nDoes this mean JPEG is a bad image file type? Not at all!\n\nFor regular blog posts or header images, JPEG offers more than good enough quality with significantly lower file size. You can often save up to 50% or more space while struggling to spot any difference in quality with the naked eye.\n\nSummary\n\nThere’s no shortage of images you could legitimately use for your projects. Hopefully, this article has helped you understand which image file types and formats to use in which context for the best results.\n\nRaster formats are best used for images and pictures, while vectors are a great substitute for logos, icons, and digital graphics."
