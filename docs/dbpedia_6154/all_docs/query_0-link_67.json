        "text": "For this 2013 unit, students were given the choice of which tool they want to use:\n\nAdobe Photoshop Elements or The GIMP.\n\n​\n\nStudents will perform the same basic activities. The Photoshop group will follow the text and video instructions posted on the official New Brunswick BBT9 site. The GIMP group will be accomplishing the same tasks but using videos on this site (made by Mr. Rich using GIMP 2.8).\n\nRG - Raster Graphics (Intro)\n\nRaster graphics are images that are made up of pixels.When we zoom in to a raster graphic, we see squares much like this image.\n\nWhen we zoom back, we see a car (like the cage- transform tutorial's SUV below).\n\nYou know you have a raster graphic:\n\nif you zoom in and see pixels\n\nif your eraser tool works as you would expect\n\nif, when you save your work, you are asked about how much 'compression' or 'quality' you would like\n\nRaster Graphics Activities\n\nSTART with the PDF first!! (\"Overview Instructions\")\n\nIf you selected Photoshop, then here's where you go to Mr. Rich's Photoshop page and follow the instructions.\n\nIf you've selected The GIMP, then start with Mr. Rich's GIMP Overview page.\n\nOne last thing...\n\nDid I mention that The GIMP is free?\n\nWell, it is!\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nPhotoshop CS3 is old and no longer available for sale (that I could find). After all, it came out in 2007.\n\nPhotoshop CS5 (older, from 2010) is still available.\n\nYou can buy it on Amazon for $675.\n\nPhotoshop CS6 (latest version, from 2012) can be purchased on Amazon for $569.\n\nPurposes of Raster Graphics Unit\n\nThe main purpose of this unit is to introduce students to the basic principles of photo editing.\n\nAs such, we will learn:\n\nto photoshop someone out of a photo\n\nto photoshop someone into a photo\n\nto crop, select, copy and paste\n\nto create and adjust layer settings\n\nto re-color photographs\n\nto restore damaged photographs\n\nto use various filters and effects to enhance photographs\n\nMy unit and marking goals include:\n\nhaving restored photos look as though they are original (i.e. edits blend in)\n\nhaving enhanced photos look appropriate, for color balance and proportion\n\nusing artistic skill to make damaged photos look life-like (\"taken yesterday\")."
