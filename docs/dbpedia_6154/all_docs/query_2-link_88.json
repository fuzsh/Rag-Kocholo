        "text": "2.5.8. Editing raster graphics with GimpÂ¶\n\nAs described in Section 2.5.7, there are two types of graphics: vector graphics (generally diagrams in .ai, .eps, .pdf, or .svg format) and raster graphics (generally photos in .gif, .jpg, or .png format). This tutorial will teach you how to edit raster graphics with Gimp, an open-source raster graphic editing program, by creating a head shot for a website.\n\n2.5.8.1. ConceptsÂ¶\n\nThe exercise below will introduce you to the following key concepts of raster graphic editing:\n\nZooming\n\nAdding layers\n\nSelecting regions\n\nExpanding selections\n\nClearing selections\n\nFilling selections\n\nChanging the color mode\n\nCropping images\n\nRescaling images\n\n2.5.8.2. Required softwareÂ¶\n\nThis tutorial requires Gimp.\n\nOn Ubuntu, Gimp can be installed by running this command:\n\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\n2.5.8.3. ExerciseÂ¶\n\nIn this exercise, we will learn how to edit raster graphics by creating a head shot of President Obama for a website. This will include selecting the face, removing the background, cropping the image, resizing the image, and exporting the image for fast.\n\nDownload a photo of President Obama\n\nOpen Gimp\n\nOpen the photo\n\nAdd an alpha channel to enable a transparent background (âLayerâ >> âTransparencyâ >> âAdd a alpha channelâ)\n\nUse the Intelligent scissors select tool (âToolsâ >> âSelection Toolsâ >> âIntelligent scissorsâ) to select only the face. Zoom in to select the face precisely. Note, Gimp provides several additional selection tools including tools to select rectangles and ovals and to select regions by color.\n\nType enter to accept the selection\n\nFeather the selection so that the transition between the face and background is not so abrupt when we cut out the background (âSelectâ >> âFeatherâ¦â)\n\nSelect the background by inverting the selection (âSelectâ >> âInvertâ)\n\nDelete the background (âEditâ >> âClearâ)\n\nChange the color mode to gray scale (âImageâ >> âModeâ >> Select âGrayscaleâ)\n\nCrop the head and make the image square (âToolsâ >> âTransform Toolsâ >> âCropâ).\n\nDisable âCurrent layer onlyâ\n\nDrag a rectangle over the photo\n\nIn the âTool Optionsâ pane,\n\nSet âSizeâ >> 10, 10\n\nEnable âFixedâ >> âAspect ratioâ\n\nAdjust the size and shape of the selection box\n\nType enter to crop the image\n\nScale the image (âImageâ >> âScale Imageâ¦â)\n\nExport the image (âFileâ >> âExport As â¦â)\n\n2.5.8.3.1. Screen captureÂ¶\n\nOpen the screen capture in a separate page\n\n2.5.8.4. Additional tutorialsÂ¶\n\nLearn GIMP has several helpful short tutorial videos."
