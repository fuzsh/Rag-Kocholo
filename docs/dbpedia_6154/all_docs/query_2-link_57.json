        "text": "Multi-Window Mode\n\nThe screenshot above demonstrates a basic arrangement of windows that can be used effectively.\n\nThe Main Toolbox: Contains a set of icon buttons used to select tools. By default, it also contains the foreground and background colours. You can add brush, pattern, gradient and active image icons.\n\nTool options: Docked below the main Toolbox is a Tool Options dialog, showing options for the currently selected tool (in this case, the Move tool).\n\nAn image window: Each image opened is displayed in a separate window. Many images can be open at the same time, limited by only the system resources. The image window holds the Menu of the main commands (File, Edit, Select...), which you can also get by right-clicking on the window.\n\nLayers Dialog: This is the Layers, Channels, Paths, Undo History dock. When the Layers tab is open it shows the layer structure of the currently active image, and allows it to be manipulated in a variety of ways. Users find it indispensable to have the Layers dialog available at all times.\n\nBrushes/Patterns/Gradients: This docked dialog shows the dialogs (tabs) for managing brushes, patterns and gradients.\n\nThis is a minimal setup that you can of course customize to suit your exact needs. There are over a dozen other types of dialogs available for various purposes.\n\nCustomizable Interface\n\nEach task requires a different environment so you can customize the view and behaviour the way you like it. Starting from the widget theme, allowing you to change colours, widget spacings and icon sizes to custom tool sets in the toolbox. The interface is modulized into so called docks, allowing you to stack them into tabs or keep them open in their own window. Pressing the tab key will toggle them hidden. Fullscreen mode allowing you to not only preview your artwork but also do editing work while using the most of your screen estate.\n\nPhoto Enhancement\n\nNumerous digital photo imperfections can be easily compensated for. Fix perspective distortion caused by lens tilt simply choosing the corrective mode in the transform tools. Eliminate lens' barrel distortion and vignetting with a powerful filter but a simple interface.\n\nThe included channel mixer gives you the flexibility and power to get your B/W photography stand out the way you need.\n\nDigital Retouching\n\nNeed advanced photo retouching options? We got it covered! Get rid of unneeded details using the clone tool, or touch up minor details easily with the new healing tool. With the perspective clone tool, it's not difficult to clone objects with perspective in mind just as easily as with the orthogonal clone.\n\nHardware Support\n\nUnique support for various input devices included as standard. Pressure and tilt sensitive tablets are supported, along with a wide range of USB or MIDI controllers. You can bind often-used actions to device events such as rotating a USB wheel or moving a MIDI controller's slider. Change the size, angle or opacity of a brush while you paint, bind your favourite scripts to buttons. Speed up your workflow!\n\n1 DVD disc. You will receive EXACTLY as advertised, disc as pictured, in protective sleeve. Retail box is NOT included.\n\nFull suite of painting tools including Brush, Pencil, Airbrush, Clone, etc.\n\nSub-pixel sampling for all paint tools for high quality anti-aliasing.\n\nExtremely powerful gradient editor and blend tool.\n\nSupports custom brushes and patterns.\n\nTile based memory management so image size is limited only by available disk space.\n\nVirtually unlimited number of images open at one time.\n\nFull alpha channel support.\n\nLayers and channels.\n\nMultiple Undo/Redo (limited only by diskspace).\n\nEditable text layers.\n\nTransformation tools including rotate, scale, shear and flip.\n\nSelection tools including rectangle, rounded rectangle, ellipse, free, fuzzy.\n\nForeground extraction tool.\n\nAdvanced path tool doing bezier and polygonal selections.\n\nTransformable paths, transformable selections.\n\nQuickmask to paint a selection.\n\nA Procedural Database for calling internal functions from external programs as in Script-fu.\n\nAdvanced scripting capabilities (Scheme, Python, Perl).\n\nPlug-ins which allow for the easy addition of new file formats and new effect filters.\n\nFree plug-ins & scripts available online.\n\nLoad and save animations in a convenient frame-as-layer format.\n\nMNG support.\n\nFrame Navigator (in GAP, the GIMP Animation Package).\n\nOnion Skin (in GAP, the GIMP Animation Package).\n\nBluebox (in GAP, the GIMP Animation Package).\n\nFile formats supported include bmp, gif, jpeg, mng, pcx, pdf, png, ps, psd, svg, tiff, tga, xpm, and many others.\n\nLoad, display, convert, save to many file formats.\n\nSVG path import/export.\n\nMuch, much more!\n\nExclusive autoplay menu (PC only), provides you with easy access to installation guide, software manual, email support and more!"
