        "text": "It’s very fast and superficial as they usually are.\n\nHe makes a good point about the lack of a histogram with a Filter Layer using Levels.\n\nIt is on the Filter Mask using Levels though.\n\nIt sounds like a bug report is needed there?\n\nI’ll copy two comments in particular:\n\n“Both are good”, and “Use both. I have no problem using both”.\n\nRegarding the question of whether Krita is the better “photo editor”, I’m personally averse to calling Krita a “photo editor” - although you can of course edit photos with it, I don’t like the reduction to that one function.\n\nOtherwise, I have nothing to add to what @AhabGreybeard said.\n\nMichelist\n\nI am obviously biased but for me Krita excels over Gimp in photo editing even over Inkscape for vector if I can.\n\nBut I am a firm believer that a honest opinion against should always be the one heard more loudly than soft agreeing opinions with a catch as they are usually false. He is clearly a Gimp fan boy but his points are interesting none the less.\n\nYes he doesn’t know about the filter mask concept, so his second point about preview is a bit wrong. I agree that there can be a preview button on the filter layer too.\n\nIn all it is a good feedback maybe we should think about unifying the experience of Filter Layer and Filter Masks.\n\nThinking about it again, a Wishlist bug report would be premature at this stage.\n\nAlso, he makes good points about the UI and UX in other areas.\n\nA Feature Request topic would be a good start but I’m not sure how wide ranging it could be or should be. I don’t think there’s any urgency for it.\n\nI fully agree with that. Any criticism is useful to hear, the more constructive the better of course, and it was constructive.\n\nHis insistence in calling a Filter Layer an ‘Adjustment Layer’ seems to show that he’s a PS fanboy. It is the industry standard so maybe he was trying to make his comparison more understandable to many people.\n\nHello and welcome to a different path through the forest\n\nIf you have any questions, just create a topic in the appropriate category and somebody will try to answer/help within a short(ish) time.\n\nThe manual:\n\nThe main download site:\n\nI find GIMP and Krita to both be good in their own way. I actually like some of the brushes better in GIMP than I do for krita. Not all of them, but there is a few things about GIMP I sometimes wish krita had. For example, you can set a preset in GIMP to have different default colors for certain brush presets or new brushes. I don’t think krita has that yet.\n\nI like both Krita and Gimp. They both have their strong points. I like Krita’s brushes for painting better though. They come very close to the traditional media look.\n\nI find that Gimp is (imo) better for photo editing and Krita is best for paintings that can look like traditional media. However, the best plus for Krita is that I can work on a painting on both my Windows computer and my Android tablet. +++\n\nOh dear. That article was created on March 13th this year.\n\nWe’ve recently had to delete an AI generated image that was posted by someone who has just started using krita and discovered its wonderful “AI extension”.\n\nI suspect there will be more like that in the near future\n\nAlso, the fact that the next stubborn, stupid reviewer called Krita a Photoshop app again. When will they learn it?\n\nOver time these people are starting to get on my nerves, when are they going to start reading the manuals of the apps they are comparing first. Then they would know that Krita is not and never will be a PS clone.\n\nThis really makes me upset!\n\nMichelist\n\nFun fact: I originally started digital painting with Gimp! But someday, shortly after upgrading it to a new version (I don’t remeber which verion because it was years ago), I had a crash that made me unable to open that new version of Gimp ever again. I tried everything, even reinstalled it fresh, but my computer would obstinately refuse to open it ever again, still don’t know why to that day. I checked the previous version that still worked, but instead of regressing I finally opted for a new software that I never had any problem with: Krita!\n\nI could probably make Gimp work again now, as I changed computer since it happened and they certainly moved a few versions up, but I never felt the need for it."
