        "text": "GIMP Designer\n\nGIMP is a free and open-source raster graphics editor used for image retouching and editing. We got some most asked Interview question and answers in GIMP Designing to pre you for the Job Interview.\n\nQ.1 What Is GIMP?\n\nThe GNU Image Manipulation Program, or GIMP, is a raster graphics editor application used to process digital graphics and photographs with some support for vector graphics. Its typical uses include creating graphics and logos, resizing and cropping photos, altering colors, combining multiple images, removing unwanted image features.\n\nQ.2 Is GIMP a Gnome Application?\n\nGIMP is not really a gnome application, the only thing they have in common is GTK+. However, GIMP can optionally use gnome-vfs, allowing you to load and edit images from remote servers.\n\nQ.3 Do we need an X Server to run in Batch Mode for GIMP?\n\nYes, you have to have some form of X server to run GIMP in batch Mode. It needs an X server for image processing, and for font manipulation. However, if you wish to run in batch mode, you can run with a special, frame-buffer-less X server called Xvfb, which doesn't require a graphics card or mess with your screen.\n\nQ.4 How do we draw in a different color in GIMP?\n\nTo draw a different colour in Gimp you need to go at the bottom of the toolbar where there is a box with two smaller boxes and an arrow. The uppermost box displays the current foreground color; the lowermost box displays the current background color. You can double-click on either of the color boxes ( to pop up a color selection tool, with which you can select any color you like for that box. That color then becomes the new foreground or background color. Subsequent drawing operations now uses these colors for future work\n\nQ.5 Why should we place layer Groups In GIMP?\n\nSometimes it is nice to place layers in groups. It not only makes them easier to organize when you have lots of them but also means that you can easily apply the same effect to lots of layers, without directly affecting those layers. Moreover, this will be much easier to program once GEGL has been integrated into GIMP.\n\nQ.6 How do we call one Script-fu Script from another?\n\nThe trick to calling script-fu-scripts from another script is to just reference the main define for the script and not to try to use the pdb call. All the scripts in script-fu share a common name space; you call other scripts just like a regular function / define / whatever you call those things in_scheme.\n\nQ.7 How do we bind keys to menus for shortcuts in GIMP?\n\nTo bind keys first make sure that \"Use dynamic keyboard shortcuts\" option in \"Interface\" tab of Preferences dialog is enabled, then go to the menu selection you are interested in. Keeping it selected, press the key sequence you wish to assign to the menu. It will appear on the right of the menu. The new binding will be saved and used in future GIMP sessions. You can also use \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" dialog to assign keys to menus and functions.\n\nQ.8 What configuration is needed to run GIMP?\n\nAny system that is compatible with GNome 2, KDE 3.2, Windows 2000 or Mac OS X can be used to configure GIMP. However, GIMP needs more primary memory space depending on the type and number of images number of layers in an application is also a concern for GIMP.Therefore, Minimum of 128 MB RAM is required and Free disk space of 20 GB is advisable.\n\nQ.9 How can we draw a circle with GIMP?\n\nThe best way is to draw a circle is to select ellipse. Then select the Stroke Selection from Edit Menu and stroke the shape of the ellipse to get a circle of desired Dimension.\n\nQ.10 Explain about work flow of AnimStack in GIMP.\n\nFirst it creates all frames for the animation adds the required colors for foreground and background layers. Then it attaches the frames with the appropriate AnimStack tags. This attaching is done by placing them in square brackets anywhere in the layer’s name. The menu command used in this workflow process is Filters- >Animation- >Process AnimStack Tags.\n\nQ.11 Is macro recording possible in GIMP?\n\nYes, macro Recording is available in Gimp. To record a macro Gimpscripter, a plug in authoring tool is needed. Macro allows to automate a set of actions with a single click. Following are the instructions to record a macro in GIMP:\n\nClick on Filter, then Gimpscripter.\n\nClick on Copy followed by Paste from Edit Menu.\n\nClick on Select, then To Path.\n\nClick on Edit, followed by Stroke. Select the path.\n\nType a name for the macro. Click on OK.\n\nRead the summary displayed, then click on OK.\n\nRestart GIMP. From then on, this macro is available.\n\nQ.12 What all can GIMP do?\n\nGIMP can be used to: create layouts for websites, to generate pictures and enhance existing images, and everything else that has to do with 2D (bitmap based) graphics.\n\nQ.13 What Is Visual Graphics?\n\nGraphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term \"graphic design\" is used synonymously.\n\nQ.14 What Is A Graphic Material?\n\nGraphic materials are defined as documents in the form of pictures, photographs, drawings, watercolors, prints, and other forms of two-dimensional pictorial representations. The rules cover the description of most two-dimensional graphic materials, whether intended to be viewed by reflected or transmitted light.\n\nQ.16 What is Net-fu?\n\nNet-fu is a web-based interface to a script-fu server. The work is done at a remote site. To see Net-fu, point your web browser or one of the mirror sites, and then go to \"gimp/net-fu/\". Any web browser can read net-fu pages; the browser must be Java-enabled to actually run Script-fu. Fonts\n\nQ.17 What is Gimps Native Graphics File Format?\n\nXCF is GIMP's \"native\" format. This will preserve all information about an image, including the layers.\n\nQ.21 What is the difference between Id and Class?\n\nID identifies and sets style to one and only one occurrence of an element while class can be attached to any number of elements.\n\nQ.22 What Are Pseudo-elements?\n\nPseudo-elements are fictional elements that do not exist in HTML. They address the element's sub-part (non-existent in HTML) and not the element itself. In CSS1 there are two pseudo-elements: 'first-line pseudo-element' and 'first-letter pseudo-element'. They can be attached to block-level elements (e.g. paragraphs or headings) to allow typographical styling of their sub-parts.\n\nQ.23 What are the components of Graphic Design?\n\nThere are four main components of design :\n\ncolor theory\n\ncomposition and layout\n\nperspective\n\ntypography\n\nQ.24 Explain Project Initiation Process in Graphic Design?\n\nOne of the most important steps in the design process is accumulating the information you’ll need. This is usually achieved by either a face-to-face meeting with the client, a questionnaire, or even a Skype meeting if you really wish to establish a personal relationship. In gathering this information, you now know your client’s objectives and can focus on the details for inclusion in your brief. It ensures the client knows what he or she wants from the project It acts as your point of reference during the project\n\nQ.25 What is Multi-threading?\n\nMulti-threading allows making use of multiple cores for processing. Not all features in GIMP make use of that, it’s something we intend to work on further. A point of interest is that multi-threading happens through GEGL processing, but also in core GIMP itself, for instance to separate painting from display code.\n\nQ.26 What do you mean by Warp Transform?\n\nThe new Warp Transform tool allows doing localized transforms like growing or shifting pixels with a soft brush and undo support. Such tools are commonly used in fashion photography for retouching.\n\nQ.27 What is the Handle Transform Tool?\n\nThe new Handle Transform tool provides an interesting approach at applying scaling, rotating, and perspective correction using handles placed on the canvas.\n\nQ.28 Explain Gradient Tool.\n\nWith the help of Gradient Tool you can create and delete color stops, select and shift them, assign colors to color stops, change blending and coloring for segments between color stops and create new color stops from midpoints right on the canvas.\n\nQ.29 Define Seamless Clone Tool.\n\nSeamless Clone tool is aimed to simplify making layered compositions. Typically when you paste one image into another, there are all sorts of mismatches: color temperature, brightness etc. This new experimental tool tries to adapt various properties of a pasted image with regards to its backdrop.\n\nQ.30 What is Darktable?\n\ndarktable is an open source photography workflow application and raw developer. A virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers. It manages your digital negatives in a database, lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable and enables you to develop raw images and enhance them.\n\nQ.31 What is RawTherapee?\n\nRawTherapee is a powerful, cross-platform raw photo processing system, released as Free Software (GPLv3). It is designed for developing raw files from a broad range of digital cameras and targeted at users ranging from enthusiast newcomers who wish to broaden their understanding of how digital imaging works to professional photographers.\n\nQ.32 Explain in detail the clip warning display filter.\n\nThe new Clip Warning display filter will visualize underexposed and overexposed areas of a photo for you, with customizable colors. you will mostly benefit from this if you work on 16/32 bit per channel float images such as EXR and TIFF.\n\nQ.33 What is one of the most Common Uses of Gimp?\n\nOne of the most common uses of the GIMP is to fix digital camera images that for some reason are less than perfect. Maybe the image is overexposed or underexposed; maybe rotated a bit; maybe out of focus: these are all common problems for which GIMP has good tools.\n\nQ.34 How do you sharpen a fuzzy image?\n\nThe most generally useful technique for sharpening a fuzzy image is called the Unsharp Mask. It is a plug-in, and you can access it as Filters->Enhance->Unsharp Mask in the image menu. There are two parameters, \"Radius\" and \"Amount\". The default values often work pretty well, so you should try them first. Increasing either the radius or the amount increases. However, if you make the unsharp mask too strong, it will amplify noise in the image and also give rise to visible artifacts where there are sharp edges the strength of the effect.\n\nQ.36 What is Associative Hatching in CAD\n\nAssociative Hatching moves with the boundary and Auto CAD crashes may result in corrupted Drawings\n\nQ.37 What is the difference between a Window Polygon and a Cross Polygon?\n\nWindow polygon allows the designer to select objects inside the polygon whereas crossing polygon is used to select all the objects within and around the boundary of the polygon.\n\nQ.38 What can you do when you convert a text item to selection or path\n\nBy converting a text item to a selection or a path, you can fill it, stroke the outlines, transform it, or generally apply the whole panoply of GIMP tools to get interesting effects.\n\nQ.39 What is the Function of Dot to Dot Command?\n\nThe Dot for Dot command enables and disables \"Dot for Dot\" mode. If it is enabled and the zoom factor is 100%, every pixel in the image is displayed as one pixel on the screen. If it is disabled, the image is displayed at its \"real\" size, the size it will have when it is printed. For Dot for Dot mode to work properly, the resolution of the image must be the same as the screen resolution in the Preferences menu.\n\nQ.40 What are the core graphic design principles?\n\nThe core graphic design principles are: Contrast Proportion Rhythm Color Visual Hierarchy Proximity\n\nQ.41 What is the Golden ratio in graphic design composition and why is it important?\n\nAlso called Phi, the golden ratio is 1:1.61. The golden ratio is used to make the visitors focus on things the designer wants to emphasize.\n\nQ.42 Define a healing tool?\n\nHealing tool is used in Photoshop to conceal the unwanted spots that appeared in your unique picture and makes the picture look real without any changes. The tool use complex algorithm to work out what would be the area of your picture based on the nearby pixels.\n\nQ.43 What are the components of Zoom Submenu?\n\nThe Zoom submenu contains various commands which affect the magnification of the image in the image window (zooming). Enlarging an image (zooming in) is useful if you need to work with high precision, making pixel-level image modifications or precise selections. On the other hand, reducing an image (zooming out) is handy for getting an overall impression of the image and seeing the results of changes which affect the entire image.\n\nQ.44 Explain Shrink Wrap command?\n\nThe Shrink Wrap command resizes the window so that it is exactly the same size as the image at the current zoom factor. If the image doesn't completely fit on the screen, the image window is enlarged so that the largest possible part of the image is shown.\n\nQ.45 What is the Gamma Dialogue?\n\nThe correspondence between electrical intensity and color brightness is not exact and it depends upon the device. \"Gamma\" is a coefficient used to correct this correspondence. Your image must be visible in both dark and bright areas, even if it is displayed on a monitor with too much luminance or not enough. The \"Gamma\" Display Filter allows you to get an idea of the appearance of your image under these conditions.\n\nQ.46 Define Path?\n\nA path can be defined as a compilation of possibly disconnected, lines and areas telling the image. It cannot be strained by itself, but after it is specific, it can be stroked or filled, making the proper marks."
