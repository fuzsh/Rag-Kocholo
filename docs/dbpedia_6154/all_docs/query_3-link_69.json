        "text": "The best Adobe Photoshop alternatives deliver seamless photo editing workflows without requiring a Creative Cloud subscription - and these are the alternative apps we recommend.\n\nOur expert team has reviewed the best photo editors, best graphic design software, and the best Adobe Lightroom alternatives - and in our experience, Affinity Photo is easily the best Photoshop alternative you can download right now. It's an incredibly powerful piece of software for professionals and beginners, available for a one-off price with no endless subscriptions.\n\nWe've rounded up our top-rated substitutes to Photoshop, comparing platform compatibility, pricing, and how each app's tools, features, and workflow measures up to the industry-standard.\n\nSee what we thought of Adobe's popular photo editor in our Adobe Photoshop review.\n\nThe best Adobe Photoshop alternatives in 2024\n\nBelow you'll find full write-ups for each of the best Adobe Photoshop alternatives in our list. We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\n\nBest Adobe Photoshop alternative overall\n\nAffinity Photo, from Serif, is positively packed with professional tools that make it a genuine rival to Photoshop for both Windows and macOS. There’s also a tablet version if you're looking for one of the best Photoshop alternatives on iPad. But best of all, there are no endless subscriptions, just a one-off cost, making it ideal when working to a budget.\n\nYou’ll find an impressively clean interface (although the UI can be occasionally glitchy). There’s also no shortage of useful tools, including PSD file support, RAW Support, masking, layering, retouching, removing blemishes, curving, and a full set of 16-bit filters. In our review, we noted that “the list of tools is incredibly long, and rivals bigger, more expensive competitors, yes, even Photoshop itself.” The only danger here, then, is that you may be overwhelmed by everything on offer.\n\nThe app is available as a standalone download. Alternatively, the Affinity V2 universal license, bundling the photo editor alongside Affinity Designer and Affinity Publisher, which offers great value if you're working across different design projects.\n\nRead our full Serif Affinity Photo review\n\nBest free Adobe Photoshop alternative\n\nGIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a professional, open-source photography powerhouse that works on Linux, Windows, and macOS. So, it's both the best Adobe Photoshop alternative overall, and an excellent free alternative, too.\n\nIn our hands-on review, we called Gimp \"our top pick for the best free photo editor, and comes with a huge array of professional-quality functions for fine-tuning snaps and creating your own artwork from scratch. \"\n\nGIMP boasts a huge number of features and functions that rival Photoshop. There’s also a huge community of developers and artists who have created a wide array of plugins, making this a highly adaptable program. If you desire a specific feature, there’s probably an add-on for it.\n\nThe interface is highly customizable, so you can pare things back or leverage multiple windows and toolbars as needed. For this reason, GIMP has a similarly steep learning curve as Photoshop, but once you’ve made your way through a few tutorials, it’s quite comfortable.\n\nIn our experience, GIMP was slightly less responsive and used a few more resources than its proprietary counterpart, but this can be easily forgiven on the basis that GIMP always has been and always will be free and open source.\n\nRead our full GIMP review\n\nBest Photoshop alternative for intermediates\n\nACDSee Photo Studio Ultimate is an image manipulation tool that, like any good Photoshop alternative, allows you to perform many of the functions you’d find in Adobe's popular photo editor, but at a fraction of the cost. We found this app to be an ideal middle-ground if you're not quite a beginner, but not yet a pro.\n\nWhen we tested out the software, we found a versatile alternative to Photoshop. It might not match every powerful feature in Adobe’s top tool, but it delivers most tools for most photo editors.\n\nThe latest features include AI-based tools such as ‘AI Actions’ which help you perform potentially time-consuming tasks such as blurring a background, or selecting an object, with just the click of a button. ‘AI Face Edit’ is interesting as it allows you to alter the face of a subject, and the end result is pretty impressive.\n\nMonthly and annual subscriptions are available, bundling Photo Studio Ultimate alongside Gemstone Photo Editor, Luxea Video Editor, Video Converter Pro, and Photo Studio for Mac for $9 / £8 / $15AUD a month or $89 / £79 / $142AUD a year. You’ll get free updates and upgrades as long as your subscription remains active, are allowed up to five users per product, get 100GB of cloud storage, and have access to tutorials and workshops.\n\nAlternatively, it can be yours outright for the one-off price of $150 / £132 / $239AUD. This includes a year of free updates and technical support.\n\nOverall, a great Photoshop alternative for creating professional-looking content while working to a budget.\n\nRead our full ACDSee Photo Studio Ultimate review\n\nBest Photoshop alternative online\n\nPixlr is one of the best free Photoshop alternatives online - but what makes this a good pick is that it's available as a web app. During our review of the HTML 5 photo editing software, we said it's \"so feature-packed, it gives desktop apps a serious run for their money.\"\n\nThe Pixlr interface is more spartan than either Photoshop or GIMP, but that’s not a bad thing. The workflow is streamlined and intuitive: you can drag-and-drop a photo from your computer or add a URL, and then get to work adjusting images with familiar one-click filters and sliders.\n\nGiven that it’s a web app, Pixlr has surprisingly robust layer support - one of the reasons why it's considered one of the best Photoshop alternatives. However, important features are still missing. Custom brushes, for example, are slated for development in the future but don’t exist yet.\n\nOverall, Pixlr gives you a super clean and intuitive interface for basic to medium-complexity photo editing.\n\nRead our full Pixlr X review\n\nBest Adobe Photoshop alternative for photographers\n\nPhotoshop is loaded with AI tools - so a good alternative should also boast at least some of these features. And that's precisely what Luminar Neo offers.\n\nThis app features a wealth of industry-standard AI tools that should make design and content creation so much easier (and, presumably, faster). This includes tweaking curves, white balance, a cropping tool, and Luminar's much-vaunted sky replacement tool. In our tests, these worked very well, overall. Aside from a couple of hitches, we were left generally rather impressed with results.\n\nSo, who's it good for? Our sense is that this is the ideal tool for amateur photographers. Unfortunately, for professional use, it's missing certain features and performance, as with its simpler sister software Luminar AI, can be occasionally spotty. But once you get going, the overall experience of using Neo is surprisingly fluid, with more than enough fine-tuning tools for perfectionists.\n\nRead our full Luminar Neo review\n\nBest alternative to Adobe Photoshop for businesses\n\nWe're ranking this as one of the best Photoshop alternatives - particularly for small teams and businesses - because it's just so feature-rich, Photo Pos Pro comes with tools for editing images, web design, and document creation. Pretty much any design work you need can be handled here. Better still, it has a twin-track interface: one for beginners, one for experts.\n\nThis customizable interface lets you select either Novice or Pro layouts. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, but essentially, the novice layout sacrifices power for usability, while the pro layout is feature-rich, albeit with a steep learning curve. Even if it’s not executed perfectly, this flexibility is commendable and practical.\n\nWhile it lacks the deep customization that professional photographers rely on, it's still one of the best Adobe Photoshop alternatives for making adjustments to photos for presentations, marketing campaigns. An ideal tool for professional use in a business or office setting, particularly if you don't have time to learn the intricacies of Adobe's tool.\n\nWith layers, masking, brushes, scripts, and batch editing, Photos Pos Pro is a feature-rich alternative to Photoshop.\n\nRead our full Photo Pos Pro review\n\nBest Adobe Photoshop alternative for artists\n\nKrita is open-source and free alternative to Adobe Photoshop, backed by a huge community of developers and talented artists who share artwork and methods. If you’re looking for an active user base that’s invested in discussing and sharing art, Krita is a great Photoshop alternative for drawing.\n\nBeyond the community, Krita is an incredibly powerful photo editing software, with hundreds of brushes and a brush customization engine, vector and text capabilities for comic strips, a wrap-around mode for seamless repeating images and patterns, and a powerful resource manager for importing tools from other artists.\n\nWe found the interface intuitive and familiar, with minor functions like being able to scroll sliders with the trackpad and having helpful tooltips that let us know to find the right tool.\n\nKrita isn't one of the best Adobe Photoshop alternatives for its photo editing tools. In fact, it's more of a drawing tool than a photo editor. For that reason, certain features are missing: fewer photo filters, no automatic heal tool, etc. It does, however, support opening and saving PSD files.\n\nAlso, Krita has fantastic tablet support with custom sensitivity settings, so for artists looking to combine drawing and photos, it’s hard to beat.\n\nHow to choose the best Adobe Photoshop alternative for you\n\nWhen deciding which alternative to Photoshop is best for you, first consider how much of your relevant image file you need to edit and change. If you’re just trying to make simple edits to an existing image file, you may find a free software program will suit you fine.\n\nHowever, if you plan to develop a file from scratch and/or plan to make a series of complicated edits using advanced photo-editing tools and filters, it may be better to aim for one of the higher range and more expensive programs on our list.\n\nYou should also check your current computer specs. Photo editors tend to have low minimum requirements, but for more seamless workflows, you may need a higher-power device. To help with this, we've reviewed the best laptops for graphic design, best laptops for photo editing, and best photo editing PCs. For professionals, we also recommend choosing one of the best monitors for photo editing.\n\nHow we test the best alternatives to Adobe Photoshop\n\nTo test for the best Adobe Photoshop alternatives we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service using a handful of images to see how the software could be used for the editing and development of each image. The aim was to push each software platform to see whether it could simply and easily not just edit a range of content types but also do so faithfully and consistently without introducing formatting issues or similar problems."
