This should be one of the links on the wiki for beginning their free software journey, as it's a nice easy win. I'll add it.\n\nI recently checked out Krita after reading about their latest beta release: https://krita.org/en/item/first-beta-of-krita-4-4-2/\n\nI've done a lot of arch viz, both the 3D kind and the 2D image-collage kind. I'm very familiar with the Adobe suite, and also with The GIMP. One tool that I never played with was Krita... until just now.\n\nI must say I'm very impressed. Krita started after the GIMP, and I tried it a little when it first started but my goodness now it's much more mature and gives off quite a polish that The GIMP just doesn't convey (well, to me, personally, at least). For the tools that arch guys need, from my brief foray I just wanted to share that I think it is more than capable and we should definitely be advertising it as an Adobe Photoshop alternative. It's super easy to pick up, whereas The GIMP might be a little unintuitive for Photoshoppers.\n\nThe one big feature that Krita has that GIMP doesn't that makes it an instant win and something I'd readily recommend is that it supports filters masks (a.k.a adjustment layers in Photoshop lingo) for non-destructive editing.\n\nOther funky things it has:\n\nMore fancy selection tools\n\nBrushing on modifiers (e.g. blurring, sharpening, light intensity...) - very neat for touching up renders\n\nSuper cool pen support, which I'd love if I had one :D\n\nAll the other usual features you might expect for Archviz work is there:\n\nAll the basic tools, selection, brushes, clone, heal, \"patch\", gradients\n\nAll the blending modes\n\nLayers, layer groups, layer masks\n\nFilters, like colour tweaks (curves, saturation, etc)\n\nGMIC effects (woo!)\n\nHere's a random screenshot. I can't show my commercial archviz unfortunately, so I found some old university renders of highly unrealistic and unbuildable stuff."
