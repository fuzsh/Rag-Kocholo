        "text": "Yes people use it\n\nNo it is not just like PS - it is a good editor - and the price is right\n\nDepending on your undisclosed needs Aperture might also be a good alternative\n\nMost people find that iPhoto does most of what they need\n\nLN\n\nIMHO no photographer needs Photoshop. It is expensive and much more a graphic designer's tool that a photographers. If you want an Adobe product then Elements is quite sufficient - and a lot less expensive. That said there are a variety of alternatives\n\nSeashore (free)\n\nThe Gimp (free)\n\nGraphic Coverter ($45 approx)\n\nAcorn ($50 approx)\n\nPixelmator ($50 approx)\n\nPhotoshop Elements ($75 approx)\n\nThere are many, many other options. Search on MacUpdate or the App Store.\n\nYou can set Photoshop (or any image editor) as an external editor in iPhoto. (Preferences -> General -> Edit Photo: Choose from the Drop Down Menu.) This way, when you double click a pic to edit in iPhoto it will open automatically in Photoshop or your Image Editor, and when you save it it's sent back to iPhoto automatically. This is the only way that edits made in another application will be displayed in iPhoto.\n\nDoes anyone use gimp software for editing with their mac? Curious to know if it is like photoshop or is it best to just get photoshop?\n\nGIMP is the best free open source image editing application you can find. It is an image editor and raster graphics editor at the same time and offers nearly everything Photoshop has to offer: image retouching and editing, free-form drawing, resizing, cropping, photo-montages, layers, converting between different image formats. If you want a very versatile tool for free, go for GIMP. http://www.gimp.org\n\nIt runs well on a mac, and the interface looks pritty much like Adobe Photoshop. You will no longer notice, that under the hood it is a unix application.\n\nWith Yosemite or Mavericks you'll need version 2.8.14p1.\n\nOne more advantage - the application bundle is much smaller than what the Adobe suit will install. That is nice on a MacBook Pro with a small SSD drive.\n\nAnd another IMHO chiming in! But with an additional point of view: I make and sell my own jewelry, much of it online, so taking/editing/posting decent photographs is crucial. I use GIMP for my editing, and once I was shown a few handy tips and tricks (I had seen Adobe Photoshop, but never used it -- and, yes, GIMP and PS do look very similar to one another), I was editing photos very quickly. And GIMP can do so much more than I make it do -- I can't believe it's \"free\" (the quotes are because it's OSS which, to me, is different from \"free\").\n\nHope that helps a tiny bit.\n\n-S"
