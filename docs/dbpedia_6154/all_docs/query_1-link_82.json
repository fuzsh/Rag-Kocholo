        "text": "When it comes to choosing the software you use as a designer, there are literally thousands of options. We’ve rounded up a list of the best free graphic design software, including their pros and cons, screenshots of the interface, and top features. There are also mobile apps, 3D modelling software, and some great places to find design inspiration.\n\nFree raster graphics software\n\n1. Gimp\n\nPros Cons Many tools and features No video support Open-source Limited support for CMYK Third-party plugins available Limited 3D design capability Great user community and support\n\nGimp is probably one of the most popular free graphic design software tools. It is used for editing and enhancing images as well as full-scale graphic design work. The open-source software is quite well known as a free Photoshop alternative, although it doesn’t have as many features. However, you can edit the source code to customise it, and there are hundreds of third-party plugins you can find if you’re looking for specific functionality. There is a steep learning curve if you haven’t used similar software before, but there are many tutorials available online.\n\nBest for: Graphic design with full features\n\nLevel of expertise required: Medium\n\nAvailable on: Windows, Mac, Linux\n\n2. Lunacy\n\nPros Cons Many tools and features Lack of advanced prototype feature Suitable for both beginners and pro designers Can’t import vector formats EPS, PDF or AI Works fast Limited functionality for 3D design\n\nLunacy is a free collaborative design software that helps you create wireframes, visually-rich layouts, and interactive prototypes for the web. It has all the features mentioned above and even more. You can design easily with Lunacy’s built-in graphics, UI kits, and AI tools. Both in teams and on your own.\n\nBest for: UI/UX and web design\n\nLevel of expertise required: Low to Medium\n\nAvailable on: Windows, Mac, Linux\n\n3. Krita\n\nPros Cons Intuitive interface No formal customer support Easy to use Uses a large amount of RAM Great community forum A learning curve when using brush presets Highly customisable\n\nKrita is an open-source raster graphics editor. It's most useful for 2D animation and digital painting. Krita is designed for ease of use with a drawing tablet, although it is possible to use the software without a drawing tablet. It also supports vector artwork.\n\nBest for: Digital painting and 2D animation\n\nLevel of expertise required: Low to Medium\n\nAvailable on: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and Chrome OS\n\n4. Paint.NET\n\nPros Cons Plugins available to increase functionality Only available on Windows Lightweight and fast Can only view and edit one image at a time Easy to use, even for beginners Limited functionality\n\nPaint.NET is free raster graphics editing software and a more advanced version of the well-known Paint app by Microsoft. It doesn’t have as advanced functionality as some of the more complex apps, but there are many plugins available to expand the features to your needs. It’s extremely quick and responsive, even when working with fairly large files.\n\nBest for: Quick and simple image edits and designs\n\nLevel of expertise required: Low\n\nAvailable on: Windows\n\nFree digital drawing software\n\n5. Easel.ly\n\nPros Cons Intuitive interface Only low-quality downloads on free version Quick turnaround time Difficult to customise\n\nEaselly is a specialised web-based design tool used for creating infographics and visualising data. It has a simple drag-and-drop interface and is suitable for total beginners. The designs can be created quickly and look neat and professional, but because they are based on templates and elements, they're difficult to customise and you may struggle to create something unique.\n\nBest for: Infographics; data visualisation\n\nLevel of expertise required: None\n\nAvailable on: Web\n\n6. SUMO Paint\n\nImage credit: Vecteezy.com\n\nPros Cons Great digital drawing tools Requires Flash to run Engaged support community Can be slow when working with large files Simple interface Many features only available in the paid version\n\nSUMO Paint is another great free Photoshop alternative. It's a web app that's great for digital drawing. It also has quite powerful photo editing tools, but many of those features are exclusive to the paid version. SUMO Paint has many of the same tools and features as Adobe Photoshop, although its strength lies in its illustration capabilities.\n\nBest for: Digital illustration; basic image editing\n\nLevel of expertise required: Medium\n\nAvailable on: Web, mobile app\n\nFree online graphic design software\n\n7. Canva\n\nPros Cons Quick and easy to use Designs can be generic Thousands of free photos, videos, and graphics Limited by templates Drag and drop editor Canvas can't be resized once you've started working\n\nCanva is a web-based software, which has the advantage of saving to the cloud so your designs are available on any device you log in on. It provides templates you can choose from and has a very user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. It's a great tool for beginners and those with limited time because you can create professional-looking designs really easily and quickly. However, because it's template-based, the designs can sometimes look a little generic. Canva also has a mobile app, which offers a pared-down version of the same functionality.\n\nBest for: Basic, quick, professional-looking designs\n\nLevel of expertise required: None\n\nAvailable on: Web; mobile app\n\n8. Adobe Spark\n\nPros Cons Easy to use Template-based designs can sometimes look generic Great selection of templates and design elements Can only be used to create short videos Can send preview links to colleagues to review Limited features\n\nAdobe Spark is a web-based design tool, primarily intended for designing assets for social media. Like Canva, it mainly uses templates, although you are able to create your own designs using a blank template. The quality you’re able to produce is excellent, but the designs can end up looking a little generic because they are based on templates. However, there are hundreds of backgrounds, graphic elements, typefaces, animations, images, videos, design assets and even music that you can work with to create something striking and unique. There are also premium templates and features you can buy if you would like more functionality. There's also a mobile app so you can design on the go.\n\nBest for: Social media artwork\n\nLevel of expertise required: None\n\nAvailable on: Web; mobile app\n\n9. Pablo by Buffer\n\nPros Cons Easy to use Can be a little buggy Hundreds of stock resources and templates Limited functionality\n\nBuffer, the popular social media scheduling and management app, has created Pablo. It's a lightweight design tool, intended to speed up and simplify the process of creating great visuals for social media posts. The intuitive interface means anyone can use it, no matter the level of skill. It is perfect for quick social media artwork, but it does have very limited functionality otherwise.\n\nBest for: Social media graphics\n\nLevel of expertise required: None\n\nAvailable on: Web\n\n10. Klex\n\nPros Cons Many tools and features Sometimes slow when working with bigger files Uses open SVG format which is widely supported Limited support for .AI and .EPS files Can be somewhat difficult to use\n\nInkscape is open-source vector graphics software, available for Windows, Linux, and Mac. It’s comparable to Adobe Illustrator, and offers great features for creating digital illustrations and logos. It has amazing features and should not be underestimated just because it's free. Inkscape uses SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) which is great for creating large banners and other media without losing quality. The interface and tools work quite differently to similar software, so it may take some time to learn how to use Inkscape, but there are great tutorials on Youtube.\n\nBest for: creating complex vector graphics\n\nLevel of expertise required: Medium/high\n\nAvailable on: Windows, Mac, Linux\n\n12. Vecteezy\n\nPros Cons Simple, easy-to-use interface Limited features Over a million free resources No ability to start with a blank canvas Simple licensing Requires registration to access some features\n\nVecteezy offers over a million free resources, including vectors, photos, illustrations, design templates, and videos.

Vectr\n\nPros Cons Online real-time collaboration Not advanced enough for experienced designers Quick and easy to learn No ability to save locally Autosaves projects\n\nVectr is a vector editing tool with versions for web and desktop. It is suitable for beginners, with an intuitive interface and tools that are easy to master without a huge amount of experience.

The software is fairly intuitive, and if you’ve used any other image processing software before it shouldn’t take you long to find your way around. However, some tools work quite differently from the popular alternatives, such as Adobe Lightroom, and the learning curve can be a little steep for more advanced functions. There are excellent, comprehensive guides and tutorials on the help page of their website to help you. The software includes a library of free Pixabay stock images which you can use if you don’t have your own photos. It also has an optional “novice interface” for those who want to keep it simple. It's also capable of 2D vector drawings and other design tools, so it can work as a full-featured design tool.\n\nBest for: Photo editing\n\nLevel of expertise required: Medium\n\nAvailable on: Windows\n\n17. Pixlr\n\nPros Cons AI-powered tools Can't process very large file Compatible with almost any file format including PSD Software can be a little buggy at times Templates or blank canvas options No support for BMP and Tiff files\n\nPixlr is an online, web-based photo editor and graphic design tool. There are two options: Pixlr X for an easy, novice interface, or Pixlr E for a more advanced, full-featured editor.

It is comparable to Adobe Lightroom, and can be a great free alternative. It is great for processing large photos before you work with them in other software.
