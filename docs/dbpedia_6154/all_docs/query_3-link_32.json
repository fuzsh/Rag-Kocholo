        "text": "When working with photography, images go through all sorts of post-processing stages. Sometimes you convert the file type, especially when converting photos to illustrations and vice versa.\n\nEach file type has its own unique properties and uses. So when you’re dealing with raster graphics, it’s important to use the right photo editing software. Photoshop isn’t necessarily your go-to in this scenario.\n\nBelow, learn what a raster graphic file is and check out a top raster graphics software list with the best programs to consider for your needs.\n\nWhat is a raster graphic file?\n\nA raster graphic file, commonly referred to as a bitmap image, is essentially a collection or grid of tiny pixels that make up a complete image. Each pixel (or square) has a specific hue or shade. It’s generally considered unimportant by itself—but together, the pixels make up a complete image.\n\nA raster graphic file is mostly used to alter non-line images, like digitized photos, scanned art, or detailed illustrations or graphics. That’s because these types of images consist of gradations, undefined line work, and complexities—and being able to modify pixel by pixel can help create a flawless image.\n\nThis is actually why raster graphic files can be perfect for product photography, as many raster graphic programs include features and capabilities that can help you edit product photos down to the fine details—like tones, hues, and blends.\n\nRaster vs. vector image\n\nWhile raster graphic files use square pixels, vector images are dictated by mathematical formulas to create paths, curves, circles, and more. Vector images are also more flexible to use, as they're scalable, not dependent on resolution, and smaller in size.\n\nTypically, vector images are best used for design and illustration work—think logos, designs for promotional products, and other large-scale illustrations. That being said, you should never use vector images for product photography since raster graphics are the go-to for photo editing—but that's not to say vectors can't be helpful to your business.\n\nFor example, vector images are perfect for creating business logos and any other promotional materials—as the paths help create crisp details that can be sized up or down to fit any need you may have.\n\nBest raster graphics software list\n\nWhether you’re a beginner or expert and have endless or limited budget to spend, this raster graphics software list has something for everyone.\n\nAt a glance\n\nAffinity Photo\n\nAffinity Photo is a raster graphics software that sees many comparisons to Photoshop. Its affordable pricing, simple interface, layer-based editing, and time-saving features make Affinity Photo a top contender when searching for a raster image software program.\n\nPrice: $34.99 (Mac and Windows); $9.29 (iPad); $82.99 (all platforms)\n\nAffinity Photo pros:\n\nSimplified interface, with task-focused workspaces\n\nSupports Photoshop plugins\n\nCan import and export PSD files, and import PSB files\n\n360 degree image editing, batch processing, lighting filters, and more\n\nAffordable price compared to other software programs, like Photoshop\n\nLayer-based editing for non-destructive image editing workflows\n\nLive filters for real-time viewing of modifications\n\nRecording of workflow steps (much like actions in Photoshop)\n\nAffinity Photo cons:\n\nOnly supports iPad tablets\n\nSome features are reported as slow, like tone-mapping and panorama stitching\n\nHighlight and shadow adjustments could be improved\n\nHow it compares\n\nThe great thing about Affinity Photo is that many features are specifically made to save time. And if you have to use Photoshop for some tasks, the support for various plugins could make this an easy program to implement into your workflows. Plus, the affordable one-time fee makes it a no-brainer if you need something specific to raster graphics.\n\nArtweaver\n\nAvailable for both free and an affordable price, Artweaver is a realistic painting tool—not just for creating original artwork, but a software you can use to turn images into pieces of art. It’s also easily accessible for both first-time and advanced users, thanks to its easy-to-use interface, customizability, and support for a broad range of tools, presets, and more. Artweaver even has brush types that mimic famous painters like Van Gogh, and has a similar interface to the widely known Photoshop.\n\nWhile the free version has many of the basics, Artweaver Plus also includes more enhanced tools, extended support for PSD files, support for pen tablets, additional brush types and methods, and more. Artweaver Plus is available to download for a limited time test version.\n\nPrice: Free; €34\n\nArtweaver pros:\n\nIntuitive interface you can customize to your personal workflow\n\nAbility to work with other artists over the internet, either on the same project simultaneously or communicating through a team chat\n\nHighly configurable brush system, with a variety of brush types and presets\n\nCompatibility with plugins for added functionality\n\nSupports a variety of tools, layers, and filters\n\nRecording capability to capture the painting process\n\nNative 64 bit and support for multiple CPU cores and documents with 8 and 18 bit/channel\n\nIndustry standard editing tools\n\nSupports pen tablets, including pressure, pen erasers, and tool ID\n\nCompatible with all raster graphic file formats (TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PCX, and BMP)\n\nArtweaver cons:\n\nWorks solely as a painting tool rather than image adjustment\n\nInterface seems less advanced than other programs on our list\n\nSupports Windows 7, 8, and 10 only\n\nHow it compares\n\nArtweaver isn’t like many of the raster graphic software programs on our list, as it’s more of a painting tool than a program you’d use to simply adjust a photo. But if you’re finding yourself creating raster graphics of this type, Artweaver comes at a great price point — or simply free — for a user with any level of expertise.\n\nCorel Painter\n\nAnother digital painting software, Corel Painter stands out thanks to its vast amount of brushes and customization options—in addition to the overall advanced interface and tools it offers creatives. Perfect for use with a stylus, Corel Painter helps save time with a ton of options.\n\nPrice: $429 for full program; $229 for upgrade; $199/year for subscription\n\nCorel Painter pros:\n\nOver 900 realistic art brushes across 36 categories\n\nVariety of brush adjustment options, such as size, ship, angle, flow, and more\n\nIncludes color harmonies, perspective guides, mirror painting, and other tools\n\nResponds dynamically to stylus movements and canvas textures\n\nAutomatic performance optimization to ensure optimal speed on your device\n\nBonus functionality to help you know how to upgrade your systems\n\nAdditional brush packs for enhancement\n\nCorel Painter cons:\n\nCatered more toward digital painters than photographers\n\nUpdates from previous versions may take some time to get used to\n\nRequires newer devices to run the program\n\nPricier than some programs on our list\n\nHow it compares\n\nMuch like Artweaver, Corel Painter is specific to digital paintings than photos. However, if that matches your raster graphic needs, the program is within your budget, and you’re an intermediate to advanced user, Corel Painter can help you create a realistic raster graphic photo with its vast variety of brushes and adjustment options.\n\nPhotoshop\n\nWhether you’re an amateur or professional photographer, chances are you know what Photoshop is and what it does. That’s probably because it’s a total powerhouse when it comes not only to digital painting—like the others on our list—but also photo editing, animation, and graphic design. Plus, it’s now available not only for desktops by iPads, too.\n\nPrice: $9.99 per month for Lightroom, sans Creative Cloud\n\nPhotoshop pros:\n\nCountless online Photoshop tutorials, resources, and support from all over the web\n\nVersatile tool for digital painting, photography, animation, and graphic design\n\nGo-to resource for professional photo editing and retouching with easy-to-use tools, such as object selection, enhanced transform warp, modern presets, and more\n\nUnlimited layers and masks, with the ability to add text\n\nCan sync your desktop to iPad to take work wherever you go\n\nNew features roll out regularly\n\nPerfect for professional photographers who make detailed edits\n\nPhotoshop cons:\n\nOnly compatible with desktops or iPad tablets\n\nNot the ideal tool to use for on-image copy\n\nDifficult to use as an amateur, as Photoshop is an advanced program\n\nPricier than most programs on our list, although it is considered worthwhile to some due to its features\n\nHow it compares\n\nIf you’re an advanced user who has the budget to spend, Photoshop is a shoe in for what’s one of the best overall image editing software programs to use. Some of the features are already unmatched in general—and you can always expect new, innovative features to roll out. And now, there’s the ability to sync to your iPad, a relatively new feature that can help those on the go.\n\nPixlr Express\n\nIf you’re looking for a convenient photo editing tool for raster graphic files, Pixlr Express might be perfect for you—even if you’re just starting out. Pixlr Express prides itself on being convenient and easy to use, especially when it comes to needing quick photo edits. Pixlr Express is also an online tool—so you access it through your browser instead of a downloaded application.\n\nPrice: Free; paid plans available at 99¢/month, $4.90/month, and $9.91/month\n\nPixlr Express pros:\n\nEssential photo editing tools for making quick adjustments\n\nEasy-to-use retouching features to help fix blemishes, remove spots, and more\n\nDrawing tool to create illustrations or incorporate doodles or scribbles on an image\n\nPopular photography filters and effects like mosaic, bloom, clarity, glamor, and more\n\n“Element” feature adds more advanced photo editing opportunities\n\nDark and light mode to help with eye strain—or simply your own preference\n\nEasy-to-use dashboard for ease of access\n\nAutomatically saves files so you never lose any work and can continue where you left off\n\nEdit photos within Dropbox with the Dropbox extension\n\nComes with 6 months of 25 GB on Dropbox for free\n\nIncludes a mobile app on iOS and Android\n\nPixlr Express cons:\n\nExists online within a web and mobile app (although, this may be a pro to some worried about storage space for downloadable software programs)\n\nA newer program, so some features are still in a beta stage\n\nRequires a Flash player enabled on your web browser\n\nHow it compares\n\nPixlr Express is the only online based tool on our list, making it a great raster graphic software program to try out if you’re already running into storage issues. Plus, if you’re looking for a program that will help save time, Pixlr Express is a great program to try with its compatibility with Dropbox, auto-saving functionality, and mobile app.\n\nGIMP\n\nGIMP (or GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a cross-platform image editor available for Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, and more—you can even change the source code and distribute changes made, just like an open source software program. GIMP includes sophisticated editing tools for photographers, graphic designers, and illustrators alike, while compatible with many third-party plugins.\n\nPrice: Free\n\nGIMP pros:\n\nRetouch or restore images with high-quality photo manipulation tools\n\nFlexibility to transform images into unique pieces of art—or simply from scratch\n\nGraphic design elements for icons, design elements, and art—specifically for user-interface components and mockups\n\nColor management features for digital and print media\n\nCompatible with most image files\n\nIncludes layers, brushes, filters, animation packages, and enhancement tools\n\nSupport for third party plugins\n\nConstantly developed due to its open source nature, so bugs are quickly resolved\n\nHighly customizable with tutorials and community support\n\nGIMP cons:\n\nMight require programming knowledge or expertise to customize the program\n\nHow it compares\n\nOut of the raster graphics software programs on our list, GIMP is the only one that works within the open-source model. This means if you have programming knowledge, you have the ability to customize this program to your own needs and workflow. On the flip side, it may be difficult to navigate as a beginner — but for more intermediate to advanced users, GIMP may be worthwhile to try out for its flexibility.\n\npaint.NET\n\nIf you’re just starting out, paint.NET is a great place to learn how to edit and retouch raster graphic files thanks to its simple user interface. Designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, this software is a fast image editor that’s responsive and has all of the tools you need to make a rich image.\n\nPrice: Free\n\npaint.NET pros:\n\nQuick and responsive to every click\n\nComes with special effects including blurring, sharpening, red-eye removal, distortion, 3D rotate/zoom, and more\n\nDrawing tools for curves, gradients, coling, text editing, and more\n\nHas the same layer technology as expensive software programs, like Photoshop\n\nGrowing online community with tutorials and plugins\n\nAutomatically updated with free features, improvements, and bug fixes\n\npaint.NET cons:\n\nNot meant for professionals, as the program doesn’t offer a lot of advanced features\n\nText integration is not as seamless as other software programs on our list\n\nHow it compares\n\npaint.NET might have a somewhat cluttered interface in comparison to more modern tools, but the tools and features for raster graphics, specifically, cannot be overlooked. If you’re just starting out, paint.NET is a great tool to start out on to learn how to edit and retouch raster graphics.\n\nPixelmator Pro\n\nWhen it comes to looking for a cheaper alternative to Photoshop, Pixelmator Pro is at the top of many photographers’ lists. While it’s not a complete replacement, a lot of users say what’s lacking in Pixelmator Pro in comparison to Photoshop isn’t totally needed for many photo editing tasks.\n\nPrice: $49.99\n\nPixelmator Pro pros:\n\nEase of use for working with raster graphic layers (and rasterizing vector support)\n\nClean window interface with embedded toolbars and menus\n\nFIlters, color presets, brushes, effects, drawing tools, and more\n\nAutomatic naming of layers and image upscaling with machine learning\n\nIncludes support for Sidecar and Apple Pencil\n\nML Denoise removes noise and image compression artifacts\n\nArrange Tool helps to resize and rotate without destructing the image\n\nPixelmator Pro cons:\n\nOnly available for MacOS\n\nBeginners may experience a learning curve\n\nHow it compares\n\nWhile Pixelmator Pro may have an interface that’s easy to navigate, the ease comes with knowledge. So if you’re an advanced photographer with raster graphic experience (and looking to save some money), Pixelmator Pro is a great alternative to pricier software programs on our list, like Photoshop and Illustrator.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of raster graphics\n\nRaster graphics can be both an effective tool and a hindrance depending on how you look at it.\n\nPros of raster graphics\n\nWhen it comes to creating a detailed image, raster graphics are your friend. Since you can change every single pixel, it helps you create an image with a wide range of colors and complexities. Plus, raster graphic files are compatible with most photo editing programs.\n\nCons of raster graphics\n\nSince raster graphic files are made up of tiny pixels, they're difficult to enlarge without distortion. Additionally, the more pixels a raster graphic file has, the more space you’ll need to store the image. This can become problematic when it comes to storage limitations on both your own devices and the websites you're uploading the images to. Here’s a rule of thumb: Reduce your file size down to 72 PPI (pixels per inch) for online images.\n\nChoosing the best raster graphics software for your needs\n\nWhen making a decision on something that will make your life easier, there’s a lot to consider—budget, your level of expertise, the hardware you already own, will you have time to overcome a learning curve … the list goes on.\n\nOur top choice? Affinity Photo. No matter your level of expertise—or if you have Mac or Windows—this raster graphic software is not only accessible but also comparable in features to the widely used Photoshop (plus, it’s more affordable.)\n\nRaster software FAQs\n\nWhat is a raster in software?\n\nA raster in software refers to a digital image represented by a grid of pixels, each with a specific color value. This pixel-based format is ideal for detailed and complex images such as photographs. In raster graphics, the image is composed of a fixed number of pixels, which can affect the image quality when resized.\n\nWhat are examples of raster programs?\n\nExamples of raster programs include Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Corel Painter, and Affinity Photo. These programs are widely used for editing and creating pixel-based images, offering various tools and features tailored to different professional needs, from basic image adjustments to advanced digital painting.\n\nWhat is a raster graphics software?\n\nRaster graphics software is a type of program designed to create, edit, and manipulate raster images.
