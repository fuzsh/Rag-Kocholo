        "text": "Hi @Berfi and welcome to Pixls!\n\nIt does depend on what you want to do. Both have a big overlap and basically you can do a lot with one that can also be done with the other. Both are raster graphics editors. However…\n\nGIMP is more geared towards photo/image editing and Krita more towards painting/illustrations.\n\nEven though I mostly use it for image/photo editing and manipulation I do prefer using Krita. One of the major advantages (at least for now) is Krita’s non-destructive way of working and its masking.\n\nSomething that Krita still lacks and what GIMP can do nicely: Removing more complicated objects (Resynthesizer does not exist for Krita). But then again creating and working with (transparency) masks can be done rather nicely in Krita.\n\nAbout learning MyPaint: The actual MyPaint brushes are integrated into Krita. I’m not saying that you should not use MyPaint, it might be simpler to use and more to your liking.\n\nIf you are someone that heavenly dependents on videos and articles to learn from instead of wanting to find it out by yourself, then you are probably better of with GIMP at the moment. There’s already a ton of stuff out there to learn from. Krita is catching up, but it is a relatively new product and most of the videos/articles out there are geared towards its primary goal: Painting.\n\nI switched from GIMP to Krita about 18 months ago and really like it. And even for removing things I seldom fall back to GIMP now that I’ve gotten the hang of creating masks.\n\nEDIT : Words."
