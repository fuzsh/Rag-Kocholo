        "text": "GIMP for Unix-like systems\n\nInstall GIMP flatpak\n\nWarnings and information\n\nFlatpak build available in: x86-64 and AArch64 (note: i386 and ARM-32 versions used to be published, yet are now stuck at GIMP 2.10.14 and 2.10.22 respectively).\n\nIf available, the official package from your Unix-like distribution is the recommended method of installing GIMP!\n\nThe flatpak build is new and has known limitations, though it will likely provide faster updates, following GIMP releases closely.\n\nTherefore choose your installation medium according to your needs.\n\nFlatpak additional instructions\n\nThe flatpak link above should open your software installer and prompt you to install GIMP. Yet it may not work out-of-the-box on some platforms since the flatpak technology is new. If that is the case, ensure flatpak is installed and if clicking the link still does not prompt to install GIMP, then manually install by command line:\n\nflatpak install https://flathub.org/repo/appstream/org.gimp.GIMP.flatpakref\n\nOnce installed, it will be made available exactly the same way as other applications (menus, desktop overview, or any specific application launch process used by your desktop).\n\nIf this is not the case, we suggest to report a bug to your desktop or distribution asking for proper support of flatpak. In the meantime, you can still run it by command line (not as the recommended method, only a workaround):\n\nflatpak run org.gimp.GIMP//stable\n\nThis installation will also provide regular update. You don't have to come back on this page and install again (it will not work!) when a new version of GIMP is released. Instead if your distribution and/or desktop has a good support for flatpak, it should propose to perform updates.\n\nOnce again, if your distribution does not have proper support, you can always fall back to using the following command line:\n\nflatpak update\n\nSystems without flatpak support\n\nGIMP can also run on Solaris and is available for the BSD family of systems such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD.\n\nPlease refer to the documentation for your Unix-like system on the installation of software.\n\nGIMP for macOS\n\nDownload GIMP 2.10.38\n\nfor Intel\n\nvia BitTorrent Download GIMP 2.10.38\n\nfor Intel\n\ndirectly\n\nDownload GIMP 2.10.38\n\nfor Apple Silicon\n\nvia BitTorrent Download GIMP 2.10.38\n\nfor Apple Silicon\n\ndirectly\n\nWarnings and information\n\nSupported OS: macOS 10.13 High Sierra or newer\n\n!IMPORTANT! ⚠️ App Store: GIMP team does not provide any package on Apple's App Store at the moment. Any downloads on the store are created by third party and is not in anyway connected to the GIMP team. ☢️\n\nThese are vanilla builds without any third-party add-ons. Just open the downloaded DMG and drag and drop GIMP into your \"Applications\" folder.\n\nSince version 2.8.2, GIMP runs on macOS/OSX natively. No X11 environment is required.\n\nSecurity\n\nSHA256 hash sum for gimp-2.10.38-arm64-1.dmg: dc1aa78a40695f9f4580ce710960ff411eeef48af45b659b03b51e4cd6cdf4e8\n\nCheck it on VirusTotal: gimp-2.10.38-arm64-1.dmg\n\nSHA256 hash sum for gimp-2.10.38-x86_64-1.dmg: d2d3ac20c762fe12f0dd0ec8d7c6c2f1f3a43e046ecb4ed815a49afcbaa92b92\n\nCheck it on VirusTotal: gimp-2.10.38-x86_64-1.dmg\n\nOlder Downloads\n\nPrevious installers for macOS/OSX can be found on download.gimp.org.\n\nThird Party Downloads\n\nThird party packages are not officially supported by the GIMP project. Therefore you should report issues to the packagers first, before reporting to the GIMP team. We only list some of these package systems here because they are widely used FLOSS projects, though we won't list projects providing very outdated versions.\n\nMacports\n\nAn easy way to compile and install GIMP and other great Free software on your Mac is by using Macports. The installer allows you to choose from a large directory of packages. To install gimp using Macports, you simply do sudo port install gimp once you have Macports installed.\n\nLast we checked, the GIMP port file pointed to the current stable release and we have reports from people who've built GIMP successfully this way.\n\nDownload Macports\n\nHomebrew\n\nHomebrew is similar to Macports and provides packages (aka formulas) to install, either by compiling them from source or by using pre-made binaries. There are indications that there is now a formula for GIMP, installable with: brew tap homebrew/cask && brew install --cask gimp.\n\nDownload Homebrew\n\nNOTE! Please be aware that it was announced recently that Homebrew is using analytics. To turn this off, run: brew analytics off\n\nYou can read more about this on Brew Analytics."
