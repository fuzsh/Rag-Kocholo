        "text": "With today digital modern technology, the method of handling the post-processing can be done on your own personal computer, laptop or any software application. People can shoot a high-quality photograph using great digital variables or any high-end camera to receive good shots but applying the editing software, those pictures quality will improve and suit perfectly to your preference.\n\nThere are many editing software you can use to customize your work but some application is not free of charge or under licensed and today we would like to introduce GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program), a free and open source raster graphics editor where you can find the solution you looking for. Many of the common users probably used to know other graphics editor but we also want the user to know about this powerful tool.\n\nGIMP comes with dedicated and approachable designed, it featured a lot of tools like Color, Selection and path, Image editing, Layers, layer masks and channels, Automation, scripts and plug-ins, GEGL (Generic Graphics library), File formats and all of these can be accessed via the toolbox, through menus and dialogue window. These necessary tools can guide the user to create any quality image they ask for.\n\nBased on Linux, KOOMPI want the user to experience the whole environment where we can use any program to do our thing freely. So if you are a KramaOS user this powerful tool was already installed and ready to use for editing purposes. GIMP is a graphics editor program that can be used for image retouching and editing, free-form drawing, converting between different image formats, and more specialized tasks.\n\nApart from all of this GIMP also have an extension like GIMP Animation Packages (GAP) it uses for plug-ins to create the animation and seem to be used to save animation in several formats including GIF and AVI. With this powerful tool, the user can freely design standard work at any time. There also GIMP Paint Studio (GPS) is a collection of brushes and accompanying tool presets, aimed at artists and graphic designers that help speeds up repetitive tasks and can save tool settings between sessions.\n\nIf the user is a professional level and concern that GIMP can’t fully capable of your need. For your concern, it fit the professional environment well and even can be used to create the video game since the quality is as comparable to a more established graphic editors program. We hope that this will be a tool to help the user create their own quality image and discovered a thing on their own freely.\n\nWe hope to bring more tutorials in the near future that can guide and satisfied our user and below is the full tutorials from the GIMP community where the user can try and learn each step properly:\n\nGIMP — Tutorials\n\nThe tutorials page.www.gimp.org\n\nTogether, we built tools for the next generation of engineers, problem solvers, and discoverers.\n\njoin us via:\n\nkoompi.com\n\nt.me/koompi\n\nt.me/koompisteam\n\nt.me/pionux"
