I think maybe about Autocad Raster Design?\n\nAfter more and detailed research I think the best solution is that I use AutoCAD Raster Design.\n\nThen I can choose for two solution in AutoCAD Raster Design.\n\nI edit the raster itself by erasing the parts that I don't need anymore.\n\nOr I Clean up the Raster, the smal points, dots, ec. And then I vectorize the whole raster and atfer I can save a digital version of it and that I could change a digital version of the raster\n\nThe result can added and be positioned back again in Revi.t\n\nIt's a pity that there doesn't exist a same solution that Microstation offers as DCartes in Revit. Currently we work still in Microstation but we are looking to do our High Voltage Substation desing in Revit in the near future."
