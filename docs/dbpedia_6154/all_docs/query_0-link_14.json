It is primarily employed as an image retouching and editing tool and is freely available.\n\nIn addition to detailed image retouching and free-form drawing, GIMP can accomplish essential image editing tasks such as resizing, editing, and cropping photos, photomontages combining multiple images, and converting between different image formats. GIMP can also be used to create basic animated images in the GIF format. GIMP's product vision is that GIMP is, or will become, a free software high-end graphics application for the editing and creation of original images, icons, graphical elements of web pages and art for user interface elements.\n\nThis article or parts of this article are based on the Wikipedia article gimp licensed under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, version 1.2 or later.
