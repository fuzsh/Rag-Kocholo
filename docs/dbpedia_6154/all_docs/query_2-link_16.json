        "text": "GIMP is a complex program. Only a small range of features, tools, and menu items are discussed in this chapter. See SectionÂ 17.8, âMore informationâ to find more information about the program.\n\n17.1 Graphics formats #\n\nThere are two main types of digital graphics: raster and vector. GIMP is intended for working with raster graphics, which are most often used for digital photographs or scanned images.\n\nRaster images.Â A raster image is a collection of pixels: Small blocks of color that create an entire image when put together. High resolution images contain a large number of pixels. Because of this, such image files can easily become quite large. It is not possible to increase the size of a raster image without losing quality.\n\nGIMP supports most common formats of raster graphics, like JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, PSD, and more.\n\nVector images.Â Unlike raster images, vector images do not store information about individual pixels. Instead, they use geometric primitives such as points, lines, curves, and polygons. Vector images can be scaled very easily. Depending on their content, vector image files can both be very small or very large. However, their file size is usually independent of their display size.\n\nThe disadvantage of vector images is that they are not good at representing complex images with many colors such as photographs. There are many specialized applications for vector graphics, for example, Inkscape. GIMP has very limited support for vector graphics. For example, it can open and rasterize vector graphics in SVG format or work with vector paths.\n\nGIMP supports the most common color spaces:\n\nRGB images with 8Â bits per channel. This equals 24Â bits per pixel in RGB images without an alpha channel (transparency). With an alpha channel, that equals 32Â bits per pixel.\n\nGrayscale images with 8Â bits per pixel.\n\nIndexed images with up to 255Â colors.\n\nMany high-end digital cameras produce image files with color depths above 8Â bits per channel. If you import such an image into GIMP, you will lose some color information. GIMP does not support a CMYK color mode for professional printing.\n\n17.2 Starting GIMP #\n\nTo start GIMP, open the Activities overview by pressing Meta and search for gimp.\n\n17.3 User interface overview #\n\nBy default, GIMP shows three windows. The toolbox, an empty image window with the menu bar, and a window containing several docked dialogs. The windows can be arranged on the screen as you need them. If they are no longer needed, they can also be closed.\n\nIn the default configuration, GIMP saves your window layout when you quit. Dialogs left open reappear when you next start the program.\n\nIf you want to combine all windows of GIMP, activate WindowsÂ âºÂ Single-Window Mode.\n\n17.3.1 The image window #\n\nIf there is currently no image open, the image window is empty, containing only the menu bar and the drop area, which can be used to open any file by dragging and dropping it there. Every new, opened, or scanned image appears in its own window. If there is more than one open image, each image has its own image window. There is always at least one image window open.\n\nIn Single-Window Mode, all image windows are accessible from a tab bar at the top of the window.\n\nThe menu bar at the top of the window provides access to all image functions. You can also access the menu by right-clicking the image or clicking the small arrow button in the top left corner of the rulers.\n\nThe File menu offers the standard file operations, such as New, Open, Save, Print and Close View/all. Quit quits the application.\n\nWith the items in the View menu, you control the display of the image and the image window. New View opens a second display window of the current image. Changes made in one view are reflected in all other views of that image. Alternate views are useful for magnifying a part of an image for manipulation while seeing the complete image in another view. Adjust the magnification level of the current window with Zoom. When Fit Image in Window is selected, the image window is resized to fit the current image display exactly.\n\n17.3.2 The toolbox #\n\nThe toolbox contains drawing tools, a color selector, and a freely configurable space for options pages. If you accidentally close the toolbox, you can reopen it by clicking ToolsÂ âºÂ Toolbox.\n\nTo find out what a particular tool does, hover over its icon. At the very top, there is a drop area which can be used to open any image file by simply dragging and dropping it there.\n\nThe current foreground and background color are shown in two overlapping boxes. The default colors are black for the foreground and white for the background. Swap the foreground and background color with the bent arrow icon to the upper right of the boxes. Use the black and white icon to the lower left to reset the colors to the default. Click the box to open a color selection dialog.\n\nUnder the toolbox, a dialog shows options for the currently selected tool. If it is not visible, open it by double-clicking the icon of the tool in the toolbox.\n\n17.3.3 Layers, channels, paths, undo #\n\nLayer shows the different layers in the current image and can be used to manipulate the layers. Information is available in SectionÂ 17.6.6, âLayersâ.\n\nColors shows the color channels of the current image and can manipulate them.\n\nPaths are a vector-based method of selecting parts of an image. They can also be used for drawing. Paths shows the paths available for an image and provides access to path functions. Undo shows a limited history of modifications made to the current image. Its use is described in SectionÂ 17.6.5, âUndoing mistakesâ.\n\n17.4 Getting started #\n\nAlthough GIMP can be a bit overwhelming for new users, most find it easy to use after they work out a few basics. Crucial basic functions are creating, opening, and saving images.\n\n17.4.1 Creating a new image #\n\nTo create a new image, select FileÂ âºÂ New. This opens a dialog in which you can make settings for the new image.\n\nYou can select a predefined setting called Template.\n\nNote: Custom templates\n\nTo create a custom template, select WindowsÂ âºÂ Dockable DialogsÂ âºÂ Templates and use the controls offered by the panel that opens.\n\nIn the Image Size section, set the size of the image to create in pixels or another unit. Click the name of the unit to select another unit from the list of available units.\n\n(Optional) To set a different resolution, click Advanced Options, then change the value for Resolution.\n\nThe default resolution of GIMP is usually 72 pixels per inch. This corresponds to a common screen display and is sufficient for most Web page graphics. For print images, use a higher resolution, such as 300 pixels per inch.\n\nIn Color space, select whether the image should be in color (RGB) or Grayscale. For detailed information about image types, see SectionÂ 17.6.7, âImage modesâ.\n\nIn Fill with, select a fill color for the image. You can choose between Foreground color, Background color, White or Transparency. Transparency is represented by a gray checkerboard pattern.\n\nConfirm your settings with OK.\n\n17.4.2 Opening an existing image #\n\nTo open an existing image, select FileÂ âºÂ Open.\n\nIn the dialog that opens, select the file and click Open.\n\n17.5 Saving and exporting images #\n\nGIMP makes a distinction between saving and exporting images.\n\nSaving an image.Â The image is stored with all its properties in a lossless format. This includes, for example, layer and path information. This means that repeatedly opening and saving the image will neither degrade its quality nor how well it can be edited.\n\nTo save an image, use FileÂ âºÂ Save or FileÂ âºÂ Save as. To be able to store all properties, only the native format of GIMP is allowed in this mode: the XCF format.\n\nExporting an image.Â The image is stored in a format in which some properties can be lost. For example, most image formats do not support layers. When exporting, GIMP tells you which properties will be lost, and asks you to decide how to proceed.\n\nTo export an image, use FileÂ âºÂ Overwrite or FileÂ âºÂ Export As. Below is a selection of the most common file formats that GIMP can export to:\n\nJPEG\n\nA common format for photographs and Web page graphics without transparency. Its compression method enables reduction of file sizes, but information is lost when compressing. It may be a good idea to use the preview option when adjusting the compression level. Levels of 85% to 75% often result in an acceptable image quality with reasonable compression. Repeatedly opening a JPEG and then saving can quickly result in poor image quality.\n\nGIF\n\nAlthough very popular in the past for graphics with transparency, GIF is less often used now. GIF is also used for animated images. The format can only save indexed images. See SectionÂ 17.6.7, âImage modesâ for information about indexed images. The file size can often be quite small if only a few colors are used.\n\nPNG\n\nWith its support for transparency, lossless compression, and good browser support, PNG is the preferred format for Web graphics with transparency. An added advantage is that PNG offers partial transparency, which is not offered by GIF. This enables smoother transitions from colored areas to transparent areas (antialiasing). It also supports the full RGB color space which makes it usable for photos. However, it cannot be used for animations.\n\n17.6 Editing images #\n\nGIMP provides several tools for making changes to images. The functions described here are those most interesting for smaller edits.\n\n17.6.1 Changing the size of an image #\n\nAfter an image is scanned or a digital photograph is loaded from the camera, it is often necessary to modify the size for display on a Web page or for printing. Images can easily be made smaller either by scaling them down or by cutting off parts of them.\n\nEnlarging an image is much more problematic. Because of the nature of raster graphics, quality is lost when an image is enlarged. It is recommended to keep a copy of your original image before scaling or cropping.\n\n17.6.1.1 Cropping an image #\n\nSelect the crop tool from the toolbox (the paper knife icon) or click ToolsÂ âºÂ Transform ToolsÂ âºÂ Crop.\n\nClick a starting corner and drag to outline the area to keep. A rectangle showing the crop area will appear.\n\nTo adjust the size of the rectangle, move your mouse pointer above any of the rectangle's sides or corners, then click and drag to resize as needed. If you want to adjust both width and height of the rectangle, use a corner. To adjust only one dimension, use a side. To move the whole rectangle to a different position without resizing, click anywhere near its center and drag to the desired position.\n\nWhen you are satisfied with the crop area, click anywhere inside to crop the image or press Enter. To cancel the cropping, click anywhere outside the crop area.\n\n17.6.1.2 Scaling an image #\n\nSelect ImageÂ âºÂ Scale Image to change the overall size of an image.\n\nAdjust Width and Height.\n\nTo change the proportions of the image when scaling (this distorts the image), click the chain icon to the right of the fields to break the link between them. When those fields are linked, all values are changed proportionately. Adjust the resolution with X resolution and Y resolution.\n\nThe Interpolation option controls the quality of the resulting image. The default Cubic interpolation method usually is a good standard to use.\n\nWhen you are finished, confirm with Scale.\n\n17.6.1.3 Changing the canvas size #\n\nThe canvas is the entire visible area of an image. Canvas and image are independent from each other. If the canvas is smaller than the image, you can only see part of the image. If the canvas is larger, you see the original image with extra space around it.\n\nSelect ImageÂ âºÂ Canvas Size.\n\nIn the dialog that opens, enter the new size. To make sure the dimensions of the image stay the same, click the chain icon.\n\nAfter adjusting the size, determine how the existing image should be positioned in comparison to the new size. Use the Offset values or drag the box inside the frame at the bottom.\n\nConfirm the changes with Resize.\n\n17.6.2 Selecting parts of images #\n\nIt is often useful to perform an image operation on only part of an image. To do this, the part of the image with which you want to work must be selected. Areas can be selected using the selection tools available in the toolbox, using the quick mask, or combining different options. Selections can also be modified with the items under Select. The selection is outlined with a dashed line, called marching ants.\n\n17.6.2.2 Using the quick mask #\n\nThe quick mask is a way of selecting parts of an image using the paint tools. A good way to use it is to first create a rough selection using the Intelligent Scissors or Free Select tool. Then start using the Quick Mask:\n\nTo activate the Quick Mask, in the lower left corner of the image window, click the icon with the dashed box. The Quick Mask icon now changes to a red box.\n\nThe Quick Mask highlights the deselected parts of the image with a red overlay. Areas appearing in their normal color are selected.\n\nNote: Changing the color of the mask\n\nTo use a different color for displaying the quick mask, right-click the quick mask button then select Configure Color and Opacity from the menu. Click the colored box in the dialog that opens to select a new color.\n\nTo modify the selection, use the paint tools.\n\nPainting with white selects the painted pixels. Painting with black deselects pixels. Shades of gray (colors are treated as shades of gray) create a partial selection. Partial selections allow a smooth transition between selected and deselected areas.\n\nWhen you are finished, return to the normal selection view by clicking the icon in the lower left corner of the image window. The selection is then displayed with the marching ants.\n\n17.6.3 Applying and removing color #\n\nMost image editing involves applying or removing color. By selecting a part of the image, you can limit where color can be applied or removed. When you select a tool and move the mouse pointer onto an image, the appearance of the mouse pointer changes to reflect the chosen tool.\n\nWith many tools, an icon of the current tool is shown along with the arrow. For paint tools, an outline of the current brush is shown, allowing you to see exactly where you will be painting in the image and how large of an area will be painted.\n\n17.6.3.1 Selecting colors #\n\nThe GIMP toolbox always shows two color swatches. The foreground color is used by the paint tools. The background color is used much more rarely, but it can easily be switched to become the foreground color.\n\nTo change the color displayed in a swatch, click the swatch. A dialog opens.\n\nThese tabs provide different color selection methods. Only the first tab, shown in FigureÂ 17.2, âThe basic color selector dialogâ, is described here. The new color is shown in Current. The previous color is shown in Old.\n\nFigureÂ 17.2: The basic color selector dialog #\n\nThe easiest way to select a color is by using the colored areas in the boxes to the left. In the narrow vertical bar, click a color similar to the desired color. The larger box to the left then shows available nuances. Select a color nuance. It is then shown in Current.\n\nThe arrow button to the right of Current allows saving colors. Click the arrow to copy the current color to the history. A color can then be selected by clicking it in the history.\n\nA color can also be selected by directly entering its hexadecimal color code in HTML Notation.\n\nThe color selector defaults to selecting a color by hue. To select by saturation, value, red, green, or blue, select the corresponding radio button to the right. The sliders and number fields can also be used to modify the currently selected color. Experiment a bit to find out what works best for you.\n\nWhen you are finished, click OK.\n\nTo select a color that already exists in your image, use the Color Picker tool. With the tool options, set whether the foreground or background color should be selected.\n\n17.6.3.2 Painting and erasing #\n\nTo paint and erase, use the tools from the toolbox. There are a number of options available to fine-tune each tool. Pressure sensitivity options apply only when a pressure-sensitive graphics tablet is used.\n\nThe pencil, brush, airbrush, and eraser work much like their real-life equivalents. The ink tool works like a calligraphy pen. Paint by clicking and dragging. The bucket fill is a method of coloring areas of an image. It fills based on color boundaries in the image. Adjusting the threshold modifies its sensitivity to color changes.\n\n17.6.3.3 Adding text #\n\nTo add text, use the Text Tool. Use the tool options to select the font and text properties. Click into the image and start writing.\n\nThe text tool creates text in a special layer. To work with the image after adding text, read SectionÂ 17.6.6, âLayersâ. When the text layer is active, it is possible to modify the text by clicking in the image to reopen the entry dialog.\n\n17.6.3.4 Retouching imagesâthe clone tool #\n\nThe Clone Tool is ideal for retouching images. It enables you to paint in an image using the information from another part of the image. If needed, it can take information from a pattern instead.\n\nWhen retouching, use a small brush with soft edges. In this way, the modifications can blend better with the original image.\n\nTo select the source point in the image, press and hold Ctrl while clicking the source point. Then paint with the tool. When you move the cursor while painting, the source point, marked by a cross, moves as well.\n\nIf the Alignment is set to None (the default setting), the source resets to the original when you release the left mouse button.\n\n17.6.4 Adjusting color levels #\n\nImages often need a little adjusting to get ideal print or display results.\n\nSelect ColorsÂ âºÂ Levels. A dialog opens for controlling the levels in the image.\n\nGood results can usually be obtained by selecting Auto Input Levels. To make manual adjustments to all channels, use the dropper tools in All Channels to pick areas in the image that should be black, neutral gray, and white.\n\nTo modify an individual channel, select the channel in Channel. Then drag the black, white, and middle markers in the slider in Input Levels. You can also use the dropper tools to select points in the image that should serve as the white, black, and gray points for that channel.\n\nIf Preview is checked, the image window shows a preview of the image with the modifications applied.\n\nWhen you are finished, click OK.\n\n17.6.5 Undoing mistakes #\n\nMost modifications made in GIMP can be undone. To view a history of modifications, use the undo dialog included in the default window layout or open it from the image window menu with WindowsÂ âºÂ Dockable DialogsÂ âºÂ Undo History.\n\nThe dialog shows a base image and a series of editing changes that can be undone. Use the buttons to undo and redo changes. In this way, you can often work back to the original image.\n\nYou can also undo and redo changes using Undo and Redo from the Edit menu. Alternatively, use the shortcuts CtrlâZ and CtrlâY.\n\n17.6.6 Layers #\n\nLayers are a very important aspect of GIMP. By drawing parts of your image on separate layers, you can change, move, or delete those parts without damaging the rest of the image.\n\nTo understand how layers work, imagine an image created from a stack of transparent sheets. Different parts of the image are drawn on different sheets. The stack can be arranged and sorted. Individual layers or groups of layers can shift position, moving sections of the image to other locations. New sheets can be added and others can be removed or made invisible.\n\nUse the Layers panel to view the available layers of an image. The text tool automatically creates special text layers when used. The active layer is selected. The buttons at the bottom of the dialog offer several functions. More are available in the menu opened when a layer is right-clicked in the dialog. The two icon spaces before the image name are used for toggling image visibility (eye icon when visible) and for linking layers. Linked layers are marked with the chain icon and moved as a group.\n\n17.6.7 Image modes #\n\nGIMP has three image modes:\n\nRGB is a normal color mode and is the best mode for editing most images.\n\nGrayscale is used for black-and-white images.\n\nIndexed mode limits the colors in the image to a set number. The maximum number of colors in this mode is 255. It is mainly used for GIF images.\n\nIf you need an indexed image, it is normally best to edit the image in RGB, then convert to indexed right before exporting. If you export to a format that requires an indexed image, GIMP offers to index the image when exporting.\n\n17.6.8 Special effects #\n\nGIMP includes a wide range of filters and scripts for enhancing images, adding special effects to them, or making artistic manipulations. They are available in Filters. Experimenting is the best way to find out what is available.\n\n17.7 Printing images #\n\nTo print an image, select FileÂ âºÂ Print from the image menu. If your printer is configured in the system, it should appear in the list. You can configure printing options on the Page Setup and Image Settings tabs.\n\nFigureÂ 17.3: The print dialog #\n\nWhen you are satisfied with the settings, click Print. Cancel aborts printing.\n\n17.8 More information #\n\nThe following contain much more information about GIMP than this chapter can provide. If you want to use GIMP for more advanced tasks, take a look.\n\nhttps://www.gimp.org/ is the official home page of GIMP. News about GIMP and related software is regularly posted on the home page.\n\nHelp provides access to the internal help system including the extensive GIMP User Manual. The package gimp-help needs to be installed. This documentation is also available online in HTML and PDF formats at https://docs.gimp.org/. Translations into many languages are available.\n\nA collection of many interesting GIMP tutorials is maintained at https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/. It contains basic tutorials for beginners and tutorials for advanced or expert users.\n\nPrinted books about GIMP are published regularly. You will find a selection of the best ones with short annotations at http://www.gimp.org/books/.\n\nGIMP functionality can be extended with scripts and plug-ins. Many such scripts and plug-ins are distributed in the GIMP package, but others can be downloaded from the Internet.\n\nYou can also use mailing lists or IRC channels to ask questions about GIMP. Always try to find answers in the documentation mentioned above or in mailing list archives before asking your question. The time of experienced users present on GIMP lists and channels is limited. Be polite and patient. It may take some time before your question is answered.\n\nThere are several mailing lists about GIMP. You will find them at https://www.gimp.org/mail_lists.html. The GIMP User list is the most appropriate place to ask user questions.\n\nThere is a whole IRC network dedicated to GIMP and GNOME desktop environmentâGIMPNet. You can connect to GIMPNet with your favorite IRC client by pointing it at the irc.gimp.org server. The #gimp-users channel is the right place to ask question about using GIMP. If you want to listen to developer's discussions, join the #gimp channel."
