Alternatives such as Krita are also discussed.\n\nRaster Editing with Gimp\n\nVector Editing with Inkscape\n\nFlowcharts and Slides with LibreOffice Draw\n\nAlternatives\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nRevisions\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease read the disclaimer before proceeding. We review and update guided solutions regularly. If you have suggestions or requests, please write support@kfocus.org.\n\nRaster Editing with Gimp\n\nGimp can open and save Adobe Photoshop files.\n\nRaster images are composed of pixels. Common raster formats are png, jpg, tif, and gif. Photographs are almost always stored in raster format, typically jpg. Gimp is highly recommended for raster editing because it is mature, reliable, and very popular. We recommend starting with introduction videos like those shown here and then proceeding to the official documentation.\n\nWe recently found the desire to create our own Gimp theme, specifically to increase the font size on a HDPI display. Here's the steps we took:\n\n# Create directory for theme cd ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/themes/; mkdir mine.Dark; # Copy and symlink cd mine.Dark; cp /usr/share/gimp/2.0/themes/Dark/gtkrc ./; ln -s /usr/share/gimp/2.0/themes/Dark/ui ./\n\nNow edit gtkrc and change font_name = \"Sans 11\" so that the font is as you like it. For example, you can use font_name = \"Noto Sans 16\". There are many other parameters you can adjust too. Save the file, then open Gimp and use Edit > Preferences > Interface > Theme to select your new theme. Source: Superuser.\n\nVector Editing with Inkscape\n\nInkscape can open and save Adobe Illustrator files.\n\nVector images are described by mathematical expressions. Common vector formats include svg, woff, ttf, and otf. Icons and fonts are frequently written in vector formats because they scale very well and usually require far less memory than raster formats.\n\nWe recommend Inkscape for vector editing because it is mature, reliable, and very popular. We suggest exploring the capabilities using the excellent Inkscape Tutorials.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nQ: Some tools appear missing in Gimp. How can I get them back?\n\nA. Gimp has employed tool groups in an effort to reduce clutter. One can restore the ungrouped tools by unchecking the option found in File > Preferences > Interface > Toolbox > [ ] Use tool goups.\n\nQ: Gimp wonât allow me to invert selections. How can I fix this?\n\nA: Inverting selections may not work if OpenCL is enabled. The only way you can have this enabled is if you had launched gimp --show-playground. You may have to revisit that and turn it off\n\nLaunch the app with gimp --show-playground\n\nClick on Edit > Preferences > Playground\n\nTurn off Use OpenCL.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nWe try hard to provide a useful solution validated by professionals. However, we cannot anticipate every situation, and therefore cannot guarantee this procedure will work for your needs. Always backup your data and test the solution to determine the correct procedure for you.\n\nTHIS SOLUTION IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS âAS ISâ AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
