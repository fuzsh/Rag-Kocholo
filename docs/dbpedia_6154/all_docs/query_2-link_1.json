        "text": "Introduction to GIMP¶\n\nGIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely distributed program for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image authoring.\n\nIt has many capabilities. It can be used as a simple paint program, an expert quality photo retouching program, an online batch processing system, a mass production image renderer, an image format converter, etc.\n\nGIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to be augmented with plug-ins and extensions to do just about anything. The advanced scripting interface allows everything from the simplest task to the most complex image manipulation procedures to be easily scripted.\n\nGIMP is written and developed under X11 on UNIX platforms. But basically the same code also runs on Windows and macOS.\n\nFeatures and Capabilities¶\n\nThis is only a very quickly thrown together list of GIMP features. You can also have a look at the illustrated features overview."
