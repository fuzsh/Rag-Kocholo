        "text": "Greetings! We’ve been building Graphite for three years for the FOSS creative community. My vision and Graphite’s mission is to finally create the 2D counterpart and companion to Blender: versatile across all 2D disciplines; innovating instead of imitating proprietary software; leaning fully into modern concepts (non-destructive, procedural, node-based, pipeline-driven); and focusing on an intuitive and attractive UI and UX. The software is currently in its alpha stage and making rapid progress, although we have many ambitions so it’ll be a decades-long endeavor just like Blender has been.\n\nThe short description for the Graphite long-term vision is combining a raster/photo editor (like Gimp or Photoshop), a digital painting app (like Krita), a vector editor (like Inkscape or Illustrator or Figma), a constraint-based parametric modeling tool (like the 2D parts of any CAD software), a desktop publishing tool (like InDesign), an animation tool (like After Effects), a compositor (like Nuke or Blender’s compositor or Substance Designer), and, most centrally, a general-purpose procedural toolbox (like Blender’s geometry nodes or Houdini). That’s immensely ambitious but we’re prioritizing just the procedural and vector, and soon also raster, parts at the moment.\n\nThis is my first time posting about the software project here for the Blender Artists community, although you may know about it if you regularly watch Blender Today since Pablo Vazquez showed it off several months back. We just released a blog post recapping all the progress and accomplishments from the past year (including some of our core team members visiting Blender in Amsterdam over the summer) which I wanted to share here for the community.\n\nThe tl;dr is that we just finished a year of work reaching the minimum viable product for procedural vector editing using our node graph. Here’s a quick demo:\n\nAs far as I know, there are no other procedural vector editing applications out there, so that makes Graphite unique— I can’t think of any 2D design-focused tools where you could draw Christmas tree lights like that, and this is only a very basic example of what procedural 2D vector editing can achieve. I’d be especially thrilled for any proceduralism aficionados to join our community (Discord link and push the limits of the software and help us to design further improvements. Our node system is still rough around the edges but improving quickly— this is very much the early days: Inkscape is 20, Gimp is 25, and Blender just turned 30(! ) while Graphite is going to be only 3 years old next month. But we are in this for the long haul.\n\nBesides vector, we’ll be putting a renewed focus towards raster editing as well this year (that’s mainly limited by performance until we soon finish the engineering behind GPU accelerated rendering), and a desktop app should be available in the next couple months as well. But even though it is currently web-based, it’s all client-side and is much more lightweight and instantaneous than most web apps you’re used to because we don’t use any JavaScript libraries which tend to be the source of bloat in typical web apps, so our GUI interaction feels snappy like a desktop app.\n\nWith that said, if you find the project interesting, please read the blog post to see what we’ve been up to this past year: https://graphite.rs/blog/looking-back-on-2023-and-what-s-next/ And then go make some art and share it here!\n\nThe easiest example I can think of is that with 2 tools in Illustrator (Direct Select, and Anchor Point), I can accomplish most things - I can move a point, or a handle. I can break the handle from tangency, or return it. And at any time, i can add a point between two others without breaking the current curve, or adjacent handles.\n\nI don’t have to use different modes, or go into some other “edit step”. Pick one of those tools, click, drag, let’s make the desired curve. It’s often hard for a beginner to learn the “click and draggggg” method (because nothing like painting), but once they learn it - you see their brain pop into place, and a big smile.\n\nIn Blender (I’m comparing Blender, since we all have it to compare it), they have it sort of … backwards. You have to \"assign’ a knot type to each point (vector, aligned, etc - ironically bezier is not a named option), and then just hope you picked the right one as you start dragging around. Inserting another point mid-curve may completely destroy the shape, meaning you have to now undo, then assign a DIFFERENT type to your points, then try again and hope you got it right.\n\nI think i used - maybe it was Inkspace? can’t remember, sorry - a few months ago, testing to see how well the tools worked for this sort of thing. After 5 mins, i deleted the software. It was somewhere between Illustrator and Blender - as if coded by someone who had heard about drawing curves, but never actually done it themselves for any quality amount of time.\n\nETA: One thing I completely forgot to mention (sorry, still on second cup of coffee) was the Pen Tool itself. A key strength of Illustrator is I can click with the pen, and depending on mod keys or drag or whatever - i get a sharp point, or a curved point. With another mod key, the cursor changes (momentarily) and I can adjust a point without leaving draw mode for that curve. It’s hard to describe - but, it’s like I’m never being forced to “commit” to something I don’t want, just so that I can tweak something along the way.\n\nThis is very exciting, not a day passes where I don’t long for a unified FOSS 2D editing program. Affinity has great snapping tools, Krita has amazing painting tools, Inkscape has also considerably matured (although I don’t use it that much), but none of them have a document graph representation -well, maybe they do internally, but as far as the user can see, it’s always just layers, and it always feels limiting.\n\nMy concern with a project with such a wide scope is how you’re going to cater to different workflows : raster painting and vector illustration are pretty straightforward and standard today, but publishing? motion design? specialized programs such as Krita or QuarkXpress know to provide “soft-proofing”, “global layers”, etc. which are very specific to certain jobs.\n\nBlender has had this issue for a long time, where the base tools were mostly there, at your disposal, but never really arranged into a specific workflow, so you really had to come up with your own. Want soft-proofing? go through a compositing nodetree. Want the equivalent of global layers? use instanced objects.\n\nPerhaps it would be good to think of an API early so that other users and contributors can build upon the core functionality and help make things smooth for different disciplines."
