        "text": "GIMP stands for the GNU Image Manipulation Program, a freely distributed program for photo retouching, image composition and image authoring.\n\nIt has a large feature set. It can be used as a simple paint program, an expert quality photo retouching program, an online batch processing system, a mass production image renderer, an image format converter, etc. It also makes the task of screenshots easy.\n\nGIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to be augmented with plug-ins and extensions.\n\nThe advanced scripting interface allows everything from the simplest task to the most complex image manipulation procedures to be easily scripted.\n\nFeatures include:\n\nA full suite of painting tools including brushes, a pencil, an airbrush, cloning, etc.\n\nDigital retouching.\n\nTile-based memory management, so image size is limited only by available disk space.\n\nSub-pixel sampling for all paint tools for high-quality anti-aliasing.\n\nFull Alpha channel support for working with transparency.\n\nLayers and channels.\n\nScalable Brushes.\n\nFullscreen Editing.\n\nColor Management and Soft-proofing.\n\nA procedural database for calling internal GIMP functions from external programs, such as Script-Fu.\n\nAdvanced scripting capabilities.\n\nMultiple undo/redo.\n\nTransformation tools including rotate, scale, shear and flip.\n\nFile formats supported include GIF, JPEG, PNG, XPM, TIFF, TGA, MPEG, PS, PDF, PCX, BMP and many others.\n\nSelection tools including rectangle, ellipse, free, fuzzy, bezier and intelligent.\n\nPlug-ins that allow for the easy addition of new file formats and new effect filters.\n\nSupport for vector layers using the GFig plug-in.\n\nSupport for various input devices out of the box. Pressure and tilt sensitive tablets, but also a wide range of USB or MIDI controllers.\n\nWebsite: www.gimp.org\n\nSupport: Documentation\n\nDeveloper: First version written by Peter Mattis and Spencer Kimball. Thousands of individuals have contributed since.\n\nLicense: GNU General Public License v3.0\n\nGIMP is written in C.
