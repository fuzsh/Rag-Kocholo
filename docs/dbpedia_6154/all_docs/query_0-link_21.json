        "text": "GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a raster graphics editor used for image retouching and editing, free-form drawing, re-sizing, cropping, photo-montages, converting between different image formats, and more specialized tasks. GIMP is commonly seen as a free competitor to Adobe Photoshop, part of the Adobe Creative Suite. It carries much of the same functionality, but open source software is subject to less stability, less support, and erratic development cycles. That being said GIMP is one of the most famous and popular open source replacements, and has been consistently in development for 18 years.\n\nGIMP is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. GIMP is also available on the Chrome App store and can be used within the Chrome browser to edit files from Dropbox and Google Drive.\n\nInkscape is professional quality vector graphics software which runs on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. It is used by design professionals and hobbyists worldwide, for creating a wide variety of graphics such as illustrations, icons, logos, diagrams, maps and web graphics. Inkscape uses the W3C open standard SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) as its native format, and is free and open-source software.\n\nInkscape has sophisticated drawing tools with capabilities comparable to Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW and Xara Xtreme. It can import and export various file formats, including SVG, AI, EPS, PDF, PS and PNG. It has a comprehensive feature set, a simple interface, multi-lingual support and is designed to be extensible; users can customize Inkscape’s functionality with add-ons."
