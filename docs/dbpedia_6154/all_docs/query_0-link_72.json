        "text": "Pinta\n\nA very simple image editor.\n\nPinta is a drawing/editing program modeled on Paint.NET. Its goal is to provide a simplified alternative to the GIMP for casual users.\n\nFeatures\n\nIts features include:\n\nAdjustments (Auto level, Black and White, Sepia, …)\n\nEffects (Motion blur, Glow, Warp, …)\n\nMultiple layers\n\nUnlimited undo/redo\n\nDrawing tools (Paintbrush, Pencil, Shapes, …)\n\nSee the website for the full list.\n\nAnother feature of Pinta is full history saving. Say you want to continue a work later on, keeping all the layers intact (so that you can add/remove them later on), you can save the file in .ora format. It preserves every edit you have made so that you can reverse the changes.\n\nInstallation\n\nFor Ubuntu versions up to 12.04 you need to add a PPA to install this and keep it updated:\n\nUbuntu 10.10, 11.04 & 11.10\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pinta-maintainers/pinta-stable/ubuntu sudo apt-get update\n\nUbuntu 12.04\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pinta-maintainers/pinta-stable sudo apt-get update\n\nInstalling via the Terminal\n\nRun this command:\n\nsudo apt-get install pinta\n\nInstalling via the Ubuntu Software Center\n\nLaunch the Ubuntu Software Center\n\nSearch for \"pinta\"\n\nClick the 'Install' button\n\nOnce it is installed you can now use Pinta. Navigate to: Menu > Graphics > Pinta\n\nScreenshots\n\nShotwell has a single photo view that allows you to do most if not all of what you're asking. Shotwell, of course, has the advantage that it's included by default in modern Ubuntu so there's nothing to install.\n\nTo access the Shotwell viewer without separately launching the main Shotwell app, right click the photo and from the Open With menu select Shotwell Photo Viewer:\n\n(You can make the Shotwell viewer the default program to open photos by selecting Properties from the right click menu and messing around in the Open With tab there.)\n\nFrom the Shotwell viewer, you can rotate, crop, manipulate color levels, etc., and simply save the file when you're done. You can see the tools at the bottom of the window here:\n\nWhereas usually Shotwell is nondestructive (in the sense that any manipulations you perform on photos are only saved to a photo file if you export it), hitting save from the viewer does indeed write the changes to the file.\n\nFull disclosure: I work at Yorba, though not on Shotwell.\n\nI would try Pinta (it's in the repos), as it is simple and has all the necessary basic adjustments to do with contrast, brightness, etc, and even has layers functionality. It is ideal for a quick crop, resize or red eye correction. The version in the repos is 1.1, but you can use a ppa from the developers if you want to have a more recent version-see the notes on the site about whether to use the ppa or not. However, the default version is fine and is very useful for those quick corrections. As you can see in the screenshot below the interface is easy to navigate and simple and intuitive to use.\n\nI was just looking for something similar. I've found some candidates on Wikipedia, and I'm about to check some out.\n\nA few I've found so far are: Shotwell, fotoxx, and the already-mentioned gthumb. I don't know yet which ones are in the Ubuntu repository.\n\nEDIT: I have been using Shotwell now for a long time, and find that it does most of what I want, very quickly and easily. When it doesn't, it can directly open a full editor such as GIMP quickly to do the job instead.\n\nI especially like that it can easily resize images, something I do a lot."
