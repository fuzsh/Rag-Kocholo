        "text": "If you are in the graphic design or photo editing industry, Adobe Photoshop is the most known and common software you are familiar with. Besides this, there are some other online tools like GIMP that deal with almost the same activities. But obviously, both have some technical and functional differences between them. Today in this article, we will try to focus on the comparison along with their key features as well.\n\nWhat is Photoshop?\n\nPhotoshop is a raster graphics editor developed by Abode Inc. This software has efficiency in photo editing, graphic designing, digital art, image creating, etc. The initial release was on February 19th, 1990. It can be operated on Microsoft Windows and macOS. Within a few years of Photoshop creation and development, it’s been the most popular image manipulation program for those who love to play with design and editing pictures.\n\nWhat is GIMP?\n\nGIMP or GNU Image Manipulation Program is a free and open-source raster graphics editor used to retouch and edit images, transcoding between different image files, drawing, etc. The initial release was back on 15th February 1996 and it can be operated on both Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nWhen To Use Photoshop?\n\nPhotoshop is considered the most powerful and best editing software. You can do any sort of editing with it. It is essential when you are a professional designer working on a project locally and internationally. In other words, to work with pixel-based images photoshop is the best app. With Photoshop you can edit 3D content, design web, app, create image-heavy flyers, posters, videos, and animations. While editing images, you can make the color correction of the photos, retouch images, change someone’s face or facial expressions, edit flying hair, remove blemishes, etc.\n\nWith Photoshop you can edit, cut, join videos easily. Later, if you want you can add any filter, texts, graphics, animations to your video clip. You can also draw, paint, sketch, do digital arts with this app as well as editing them. You can ensure perfectness in every line, color, shadow, highlight, contrast, texture even a dot with the help of this software. Banners, videos, headers, ads, images, etc. can be created in the right size and optimized for web or social media.\n\nWhen To Use GIMP?\n\nGIMP is great for would-be or amateur photographers, editors, or designers. Then the question may arise like- Is GIMP as good as photoshop? Well, with GIMP you can use any image and take that on a higher level. But, it is not much use for professional purposes. You can do any basic edits, along with basic vector graphics. Also, GIMP works well when you have limited space on your device,\n\nIt comes in handy if you want to use a program that you can carry around with you keeping in the portable drives or pen drive. If you are on a budget using GIMP is the best option as it is free of charge and doesn’t require any payment for upgrades. Whatever your operating system is (Linux, Windows, or macOS), you can easily make the best use of this online tool.\n\nPros and Cons of The Tools\n\nBoth software has several advantages which will drag you towards it to use them.

Which has better features and more elements? Well, here is a short overview mentioned below.\n\nTo use GIMP you don’t have to spend a single penny. It’s a free image editing software. On the other hand, Photoshop is a subscription-based paid tool.\n\nFor professional works, editing in Photoshop is efficient. With GIMP you won’t be able to work in such a professional field, rather for basic works.\n\nPhotoshop requires a huge amount of space whether GIMP does not require that much.\n\nGIMP is open-source software and Photoshop is a closed source or proprietary software.\n\nGIMP is a comparatively lightweight software and takes less space than Photoshop.\n\nPhotoshop needs higher system requirements to operate.\n\nPhotoshop has a lot of tools and advanced features compared with GIMP.\n\nGIMP is comparatively more ideal for batch processing than Photoshop.

On the other hand, the tools used for GIMP have four to five options.\n\nPhotoshop typically runs on industrial standards and GIMP standards are not classified like Photoshop.\n\nSo, Which One Should You Pick?\n\nWhich one did you find more suitable for you? Photoshop or GIMP? There is a lot of saying between these two options. The important fact is- use the one which you find easy and which meets your needs. Think about a project you are working on, use that software that has all the features you need and also not time-consuming.\n\nIf you are a beginner you can go with the GIMP but if you required very professional and high-quality edits, that can only be provided by Photoshop. No matter which one will you choose, we hope it will provide your work efficiency."
