        "text": "I’ve been using InkScape and Gimp for some time now. I use them for graphic design elements for web design projects, and for design layouts & mock-ups.\n\nI hand code each project in HTML5/CSS3/PHP, and have taken to using CSS3 effects (eg. gradients, box-shadows, text-shadows, etc) over images where possible, so have no need for HTML/CSS code generation.\n\nAs I’m starting to collaborate more with other agencies, graphic designers and developers, I’m beginning to wonder if I need to bite the bullet and use the ‘industry standard’ tools - Adobe Illustrator, Fireworks & Photoshop.\n\nSo rather than ask which is better, I’d like to ask what you actually use yourselves?\n\n1) InkScape 2) Gimp 3) InkScape + Gimp 4) Adobe Photoshop 5) Adobe Illustrator 6) Adobe Fireworks 7) Adobe Photoshop + Illustrator 8) Adobe Photoshop + Illustrator + Fireworks 9) Adobe Photoshop + Fireworks\n\nAdobe Illustrator + Fireworks\n\nAdobe InDesign\n\nIn browser design & development\n\nOthers\n\nI do use Photoshop, Fireworks, and Illustrator for graphics work. 95% of clients insist on having an additional mockup of the homepage in .psd format for future reference, so I do give it to my clients.\n\nHowever, I think it makes much more sense to give them the cropped parts that I used in .psd or .png or .eps. That way they don’t have to use the mockup at all, if they want to modify the bits and pieces, e.g. like gradients, icons or header graphics.\n\nHowever, I think you can use the Gimp and Inkscape just as well as you can save files in the standard formats, if I remember correctly. I don’t like the Gimp, which is the sole reason I don’t use it.\n\nAs for your question, of course a serious web designer can use the Gimp an Inkscape. Adobe products do not make a professional web designer. These are just tools and the least important traits a web designer needs to possess. Other areas of responsibility are a lot more significant than the tools you use.\n\nI don’t use PS, I do think it’s an overkill in web design. I create a wireframe in vector format, then I begin coding straight away. I seam to save at least 10 - 20 hours of the overal time taken to complete a website so I can reduce my costs to the end client.\n\nAny updated elements are in the file, but there is no complete design in a picture format. I feel with CSS3 you can pretty much skip the website in picture format. That said I am able to cut costs without reducing the quality of the website. From experience I have not yad anybody ask for a PSD version of their site. PhotoShop has for some reason made it’s self a standard in web design.\n\nI think in a couple of years time, products like InkScape and Gimp will get a better name for themselves in web design. I have only now started using NotePad++ and it’s pretty amazing. Just to illustrate a couple of years ago I would not dream of using something like this, as time progressed Dreamweaver-like solutions now are a thing of the past. A similar process might happed with web design, as we don’t actually need a professional photo editing package to design websites. All we basically need are the ability to create shapes, define colours and add trasparencies and gradients whilst having a suitable package containing all the alignment and grid structure’s to it.\n\nPS is now become the standard in many ways. There are so many PSD - HTML services out there, and not a single one is AI - HTML or JPEG - HTML, everything is about PhotoShop. Courses go even as far to state PSD - HTML - WordPress. It would be a little hard removing PhotoShop from the equation, but I honestly feel it’s not needed in designing a websites.\n\nLike @kohoutek; mentioned, there are so many other MORE important things that using PhotoShop (e.g. JavaScript, SASS, MooTools, PHP, HTML etc).\n\nYes, that’s true.\n\nA website is not an image, and even when you present an image to a client you cannot make an exact copy into a website. Wireframe web design is more important. Allowing the users to chose their layout and information presented. Once approved you code this layout and add the detail with CSS3. By removing this PS process you save time and your limit confusion as you won’t get the “this does not look like the design” comments. Browsers and PS don’t work alike. A solid image is not a web page. Clients who are nannied through the PS process expect and believe their website to look like a complete identical to the PS design, which in many ways is impossible.\n\nNot sure if anybody has come accross this same issue, but it certainly seams to be something more apparent with demanding clients.\n\nOne thing to be aware of when working with the GIMP is, when you get a PSD, GIMP can open it, but depending on how the PSD was saved, the textures and gradients may be screwed up. This happened to me when I did the unmatched style CSSOff contest: I got marked down a lot of points because I could not tell where the textures all needed to be (my only hope was the crappy jpg they’d posted on their site).\n\nEither you find out how the PSD must be saved when working with others who use Photoshop, or you must have a version of PS yourself (I would hope Elements is good enough) to double-check how it looks. That or always ask for a flattened PNG version for comparison.\n\nNew GIMP2.8 coming out has many changes, but the big big changes are coming out in 2.10. One change is now if you are coming from the all-in-one software you can set GIMP up like that too (like GimpShop did) in place of separate boxes for tools etc. Also GhostScript comes now standard in instead of you trying to add it yourself (never worked for me). Gimp has traditionally lagged in CYMK colours and LAB, making it a second-choice for designers who also need to deal with print. LAB either comes in 2.10 or comes later, I forget which. Not here now though.\n\nInkscape is amazing for being in beta (unless it’s finally gotten up to version 1.0 by now?). I think possibly Inkscape will be considered on par with Illustrator (certainly seems loved by those who miss FreeHand) before the GIMP comes up to Photoshop levels.\n\nThat said, I’m an el-cheapo Linux user so no way am I going to buy a whole OS (Windows) simply to buy an expensive image editor (PS) simply to do junk like websites (image editing, not mockup creation, I do that mostly on paper first and prototypes and then direct to code, where it’s easiest to change and set up for various screen resolutions). Photoshop should still beat the GIMP in things like Print and general advertising images, but for web sites, GIMP does the job easily. You can also write your own damn filters if something is lacking, and you like Python.\n\nI do all the stuff on my own: design, back-end, front-end, so I don’t know if that suggests that I’m not a serious designer…\n\n…but I’m an avid Inkscape fan and I use it in tandem with Paint.net. These two (along with PngOptimizer) are all I ever needed so far.\n\nI have fiddled around in Photoshop and Fireworks, and they have a few features I’ve missed at first. But those features were only further enhancements to make my life easier. The core features in Inkscape and Paint.net are there, you just have to be smarter to find ways to replicate those extra features.\n\n<hr>\n\nAs a personal thought, images, raster or vector, will always have a place in digital media, including web. That considering the clear performance penalties associated with newer CSS3 capabilities, considering that you have to worry about cross browser compatibilities and about fallbacks, and considering that sometimes you have to make your markup to jump through hoops to accommodate imageless designs.\n\nI didn’t realize that any of the gurus on here used open-source software?!\n\nThe big thing holding me back from “taking the leap” is documentation including training guides.\n\nHow did all of you learn to use GIMP and Inkscape? (I have seen virtually no manuals or guides out there either online or offline. And what I have seen is crappy to put it politely.)\n\nStomme, how did you become an expert with GIMP and Inkscape?\n\n1.) Were you able to get up to speed because you already knew Graphic Design and Graphic Design Tools (e.g. Photoshop and Illustrator) and so there wasn’t much of a “learning curve”?\n\n2.) Did you find some great, hidden resources that I haven’t seen?\n\n3.) Did someone teach you?\n\n4.) Did you spend 25 hours a day trying to learn it?\n\n5.) Or are you just mega smart, and anything less than Quantum Physics is a piece of cake for you?!\n\nI have virtually no experience working with Graphic Design Tools including Photoshop and Illustrator, and so I’m not even sure where to begin?!\n\nPersonally I have come to loathe proprietary software, however I’d hate was years of my life trying to learn software but never really getting it down, or worse, learning it and discovering that I should have went the Adobe route…\n\nAny advice for a newbie?\n\nThanks,\n\nDebbie\n\n1.) Were you able to get up to speed because you already knew Graphic Design and Graphic Design Tools (e.g. Photoshop and Illustrator) and so there wasn’t much of a “learning curve”?\n\nTake a look at total training, and practice on tutorials online.\n\n2.) Did you find some great, hidden resources that I haven’t seen?\n\npodcasts are amazing\n\nonline tutorials are sweet\n\nthere are plenty of books\n\nbut most of all try video tutorials for FREE as podcasts\n\n3.) Did someone teach you?\n\nUniversity did that a couple of years back\n\n4.) Did you spend 25 hours a day trying to learn it?\n\nNope, more like 3 - 5 hours, there are only 24-hours to the day and you have to sleep, eat and chill out sometimes\n\n5.) Or are you just mega smart, and anything less than Quantum Physics is a piece of cake for you?!\n\nIf you love what you do you percivier to do a better job and keep doing what you love.\n\nI have virtually no experience working with Graphic Design Tools including Photoshop and Illustrator, and so I’m not even sure where to begin?!\n\nCheckout Lynda.com and 3dbuzz.com, they have an amazing tutorials\n\nGOOD LUCK!"
