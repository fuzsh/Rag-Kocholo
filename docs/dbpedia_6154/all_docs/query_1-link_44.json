        "text": "Photoshop is the most famous photo editor you may find nowadays. For anyone who looks for an advanced and sophisticated raster graphic design software, Photoshop gives you the ability to create, retouch, edit and enhance images with a large range of features such as changing color, adding effects, posing multiple layers or filters. Photoshop includes various sophisticated and useful tools allowing you to enhance, remove or retouch pictures for use on Windows or MacOS computers. What’s great with Photoshop is that it offers you all the essential and intuitive tools for image manipulation : brushes, pencil, eraser, blur tool, lasso tool, crop tool, frame tool, eyedropper, patch tool, clone stamp, gradient tool, dodge tool. Moreover, Photoshop recently implemented a broad range of cutting-edge and creative features that most photographers cherish. I’m talking about the custom shape tool, the refine edge tool, the knife tool or the mesh tool : I use them all the time for my thousands of images I need to enhance or retouch!\n\nFor a long time, I considered Photoshop to be the best software ever created when it came to photo editing and image retouching. Like me, you may have used it in University and now you’re used to its sophisticated features, its functioning, its display etc. Though, it is clear that for most people, Photoshop has become too expensive and its monthly-subscription format no longer fits my expectations for an editor image software. What are the best free alternatives to Photoshop in 2024? I’m sure you’re wondering the same question as me but always find some basic or subjective answers online. Don’t worry, you’re in the right place. I decided to provide you with a fresh perspective on the best free software alternatives to Photoshop in 2024, based on numerous reasons that concern all photographers or video makers : ease-to-use, powerful and precise tools, intuitive interface, use of AI, timesave and your editing level.\n\nBut first, if you always find trouble organizing and managing all your photos and images that you’re editing on Photoshop or any other efficient photo editing software, I definitely recommend you the current best and class-leading advanced photo organizer software : Peakto. Peakto smartly allows me to categorize, catalog, tag, and visualize all of my edits to have both a unique and centralized photo environment and a powerful AI-assisted images explorer deeply respectful of my personal data. If you want to save precious time and optimize the way you do visual content, I strongly recommend this amazing and automatic tool intelligently made by photographers for people like you and me, from eager beginners to working professionals!\n\nGIMP is quite famous but I believed I should include it in this article given that it’s still one of the Best Free Image Retouchers existing. If you’re a beginner and you’re looking for an efficient and simple Photo Editor, GIMP fits for a large part of users. I think the software is well made and while some people may find it unintuitive at first, I must say it includes all the essential and basic features that Photoshop has. One of its particularities I really enjoy is the broad range of file formats it supports.\n\nPhotoPea is definitely one which cannot be overlooked when you hear about online Free Photo Editors. You must have heard of it, it’s beyond any doubt one of the most well-known web-based Free image-editing softwares. It basically does most of what Photoshop does but for free. For someone like me who does not currently use Photoshop as much as before, I would choose PhotoPea as I believe it more cost effective than Photoshop with a significant shared amount of retouch features. Of course, there are lacking characteristics, I wish they would do measurement with logical distances for instance but for a time to time use, PhotoPea is worth a try because it’s remarkably reliable.\n\nPaint.net is a simple raster-based Image Editor which I honestly believe stands in this list as one of the most basic but still proficient photo retouchers. For this one, you will have to wonder yourself what your editing needs are and if those are unsophisticated, I’d generously assume that Paint.net is a very enjoyable option. Paint.net might be a better choice for quick and short term utilization but if you realize you improve your editing skills rapidly and need to upgrade way far beyond just image’s brightness adjustment, contrast curves or saturation level, well I’m obliged to tell you Paint.net won’t be enough.\n\nFirst, I sincerely think of Luminar Neo as one of the most outstanding standalone image-correcting software. Luminar Neo is often considered by some photographers easier to use than Photoshop yet I would be pretty self-confident telling you it fulfills most of Photoshop’s appreciated aspects. One slight detail which I believe can make a significant difference when you’re hesitating between two Free Photo Editors is that it was intelligently designed by Photographers. As a Photographer, I could honestly see Luminar become in a few years a credible alternative, especially in the use of AI tools not too overwhelming."
