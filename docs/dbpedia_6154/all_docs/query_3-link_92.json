        "text": "Savannah lewis\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n3 min read\n\n·\n\nDec 2, 2020\n\n--\n\nGIMP is an image manipulation program. It is an open-sourced raster graphics editor used for manipulating images, editing, free-form drawing, and transcoding between various image file formats. It is used as a cross-platform image editing tool compatible with various operating systems like Windows, OS X, GNU/LINUX, and more.\n\nGIMP is a very effective tool that can be used to flip your photos horizontally and vertically. It mirrors an image very easily by adding mirror reflection effects to the selected picture via the Flip tool.\n\nHere is how to use GIMP’s Flip tool for mirroring an image:\n\nExpanding the Canvas of your Image\n\nFollow these steps to know how to expand the image’s canvas:\n\nFirst of all, go to gimp.org and download the image editor.\n\nThen, you have to install the tool with the downloaded setup prompt.\n\nAfter that, launch the GIMP image editor of version 2.10.\n\nNow, tap the File menu and then hit the Open tab.\n\nChoose an image with a transparent background for flipping it.\n\nPress the OK tab to launch the image on your device.\n\nTap the Image menu there.\n\nChoose the Canvas size to launch the respective Window.\n\nYou need to open the canvas so that you can easily fit the duplicate image in it.\n\nFlipping a Duplicate Image Layer\n\nHere are the steps to flip the duplicate image layer using GIMP:\n\nAt the start, hit the Resize tab.\n\nThen, perform a right-click on the image object within the canvas and choose the submenu Layer.\n\nChoose the option “Duplicate Layer.”\n\nHit the Move Tool option if you haven’t selected it already.\n\nNow, hover your cursor over the layer of the selected image and then hold the left mouse button to drag it down the canvas.\n\nThen, you have to position your image just above the uppermost object.\n\nHit the tab Flip Tool there.\n\nChoose the Vertical tab.\n\nAfter that, perform a left-click on the duplicate image object layer located at the lower half of the canvas to flip the image.\n\nHit the Move Tool once more if needed. It will help you align your mirrored image perfectly along the lower of the picture in the upper half of your canvas.\n\nNote: You may also add optional opacity to your flipped image reflection by choosing the layer at the right side of your Window and reduce the Opacity value to something like 50. The flipped reflection will fade.\n\nIn case you wish to add a horizontal mirror image, then you have to drag your duplicate layer directly to either right or the left side of your object.\n\nNow, select the option Horizontal from the Flip sidebar.\n\nExporting New Image\n\nFollow these instructions to export your new image:\n\nFirst and foremost, hit the File tab from the upper left side of your GIMP screen.\n\nThen, choose the option “Export as” to launch the respective Window.\n\nNow, hit the bar “Select File Type” there.\n\nGo to the menu and then hit the PNG image.\n\nType an appropriate title for your image file.\n\nNow, select a folder in which you like to save your image file.\n\nHit the Export tab.\n\nHit the tab Export again to verify.\n\nIn case you launch the image in the Paint file, you can easily fill out the background with the option “Fill with color.”\n\nAfter a while, you will get your final mirrored image.\n\nAs you have now understood how to mirror an image, go ahead, and start using the GIMP tool to put mirroring effects on your favorite photos.\n\nEverleig is a Blog expert and has been working in the technology industry since 2003.
