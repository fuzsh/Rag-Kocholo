If Photoshop has it, you can be GIMP has it or at least has some kind of replacement in the development tree. Like Adobe, GIMP for Windows also includes support for layers and plugins. In fact, you can install up to 100 different plugins in GIMP for Windows.\n\nThe interface of GIMP seems very familiar. It is inviting and indeed easy to get around in if you know what you're doing when it comes to image manipulation and editing.

Although it isn't the easiest program to install, it is still highly recommended regardless of whether you have Photoshop installed or not.\n\nFeatures of GIMP\n\nAutomation: Automate tasks with Actions and Batch Processing.\n\nColor Management: Calibrate colors for accurate color reproduction.\n\nCustomizable Brushes: Create and customize brush shapes, sizes, colors and dynamics.\n\nFilters: Add special effects with a variety of filters.\n\nImage Effects: Apply a wide range of effects to photos and images.\n\nImage File Support: Open and save a wide variety of image formats.\n\nLayer Management: Ability to create, manage and blend multiple layers.\n\nLayer Masks: Create and adjust layer masks for flexible editing.\n\nPhoto Editing: Enhance, crop and retouch photos.\n\nPlugin Support: Extend the functionality of GIMP with plugins and scripts.\n\nSelection and Masking Tools: Easily select, mask and manipulate image areas.\n\nText and Font Support: Utilize various fonts and add text to images.\n\nUser-friendly Interface: Easy to use and navigate through the features.\n\nVector Drawing: Create and edit vector images.\n\nCompatibility and License\n\nGIMP has been released under the open source GPL license on Windows from graphics editors. The license provides the options to freely download, install, run and share this program without any restrictions. The source code for GIMP should be freely available and modifications are certainly permitted as well as the option to inspect the software.\n\nWhat version of Windows can GIMP run on?\n\nGIMP can be used on a computer running Windows 11 or Windows 10. Previous versions of the OS shouldn't be a problem with Windows 8 and Windows 7 having been tested. It comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit downloads.\n\nOther operating systems: The latest GIMP version from 2024 is also available for Mac.\n\nFiled under:"
