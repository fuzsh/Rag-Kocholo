        "text": "GIMP is a powerful raster image editing program, and commonly used for photo retouching, image composition, and general graphic design work. It can be used as a simple paint program, an expert quality photo retouching program, an online batch processing system, a mass production image renderer, an image format converter, etc.\n\nInstallation\n\nInstall the package.\n\nTips and tricks\n\nCaptions\n\nTo caption an image follow these steps after inputting the desired text:\n\nClick Layer and Text to Path\n\nClick Select and From Path\n\nClick Select and Invert\n\nClick Edit and Stroke Path\n\nCreate a circle\n\nTo draw a circle in GIMP follow these steps:\n\nSelect the Ellipse tool and hold Shift\n\nClick Edit and Fill with Color\n\nClick Select and Shrink\n\nPress Delete\n\nTip: Grow and Border give the same result.\n\nPhotoshop behaviour\n\nSince GIMP is highly configurable, it is possible to change the keybinds, and even the UI, to be more familiar to those who are used to the raster image editing program Photoshop.\n\nSpecifically the GimpPs theme aims to make GIMP behave more like Photoshop, which you can install on top of GIMP.\n\nAlternately, if you just want the keybinds, the relevant lines are included in the theme's menurc file, which you can then add to your local ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/menurc.\n\nThere is also the PhotoGIMP project, aiming to do to the same.\n\nPlugins\n\nGIMP has an extensive plugin system, as well as a Scheme interpreter which can be used to write Script-Fu scripts.\n\nMost plugins are distributed via the official repositories (for example, ) and the AUR; some, but not all, are listed as optional dependencies of the package.\n\nManual installation\n\nIf not distributed via the repositories, plugins can be compiled and installed using the gimptool executable.\n\nTo install a plugin from source:\n\n$ gimptool --install source.c\n\nTo install a pre-compiled plugin:\n\n$ gimptool --install-bin executable\n\nTo install a Script-Fu script:\n\n$ gimptool --install-script script.scm\n\nFurther options may be found in the gimptool --help message.\n\nPackaging\n\nPlugin packages should add their files to a directory with their name within /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nGreen text\n\nAdd the following to ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/fonts.conf if you see a green tint around letters with antialiasing enabled:\n\n~/.config/GIMP/2.10/fonts.conf\n\n<?xml version='1.0'?> <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'> <fontconfig> <match target=\"font\"> <edit name=\"rgba\" mode=\"assign\"> <const>none</const> </edit> </match> </fontconfig>\n\nHide Noto\n\nAdd the following to ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/fonts.conf if you have installed and would like to remove them from GIMP's fonts list:\n\n~/.config/GIMP/2.10/fonts.conf\n\n<?xml version='1.0'?> <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'> <fontconfig> <rejectfont> <glob>/usr/share/fonts/noto</glob> </rejectfont> </fontconfig>\n\nSee and Font configuration#Whitelisting and blacklisting fonts for more information.\n\nPDF files\n\nGIMP requires the library to open PDF files or it will report that they are unrecognised.\n\nSince GIMP rasterizes PDF files right from the start, it will not exploit intrinsic PDF capabilities while editing them. Other programs (like LibreOffice Draw) can be used to better edit PDF files.\n\nSee also"
