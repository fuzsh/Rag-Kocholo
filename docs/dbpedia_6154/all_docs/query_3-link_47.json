        "text": ".ai files are Adobe Illustrator.\n\nThere is one very significant difference between Gimp and Illustrator that you have to understand - they are two completely different programs.\n\nGimp is used for editing bit-mapped (pixel by pixel) graphics whereas Illustrator is for vector (object-oriented, resolution independent).\n\nIn order to edit in Gimp something that has earlier been drawn in Illustrator, you will have to export the file first, so that it is bit-mapped.\n\nTo do that, in Illustrator, go to 'File -> Export' and change the filetype to a bit-mapped graphic (BMP, JPEG, PNG).\n\nThen you will be able to open this file with Gimp.\n\nI hope I helped\n\nYou can't.\n\n.ai files are Adobe Illustrator files.\n\nHowever if you open the .ai in Adobe Illustrator and save it as a .eps instead, then you can open that in GIMP. But GIMP will rasterise the image.\n\nGIMP is a raster image editor. Adobe Illustrator is a vector image editor - the two are completely different types of image editing applications.\n\nIf you want a free vector image than can open .ai files, then you can get Inkscape here: http://www.inkscape.org"
