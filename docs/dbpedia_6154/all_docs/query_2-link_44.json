        "text": "üõà As everything created by the GIMP project, these tutorials are fully community-written. Therefore if you find any tutorial incomplete, or if it contains errors or outdated information, the best thing is to contribute a fix. Moreover we warmly welcome new tutorials. See below for the full contribution procedure.üõà\n\nBeginner¬∂\n\nGIMP Quickies\n\nUse GIMP for simple graphics needs without having to learn advanced image manipulation methods.\n\nSimple Floating Logo\n\nThis tutorial walks through some basic image and layer manipulation techniques.\n\nMaking a Circle-Shaped Image\n\nHow to create a circular-shaped image.\n\nMaking a Heart Shape with Selections\n\nHow to create a heart-shape with selections.\n\nLayer Masks\n\nAn introduction to using layer masks to modify the opacity of a layer.\n\nBasic Color Curves\n\nA first look at the Curves tool and adjusting color tones in an image.\n\nYour GIMP Profile (and You)\n\nWhat the GIMP Profile is and how to use it.\n\nImage Formats Overview\n\nSelecting the best image format for your purposes.\n\nAsset Folders\n\nExtending GIMP with new plug-ins, scripts, brushes, and more.\n\nPhoto Editing¬∂\n\nDigital B&W Conversion\n\nDetailed conversion tutorial for generating a B&W result from a color image.\n\nLuminosity Masks\n\nUsing multiple layer masks to isolate specific tones in your image for editing.\n\nTone Mapping with ‚ÄòColors/Exposure‚Äô\n\nUsing high bit depth GIMP‚Äôs ‚ÄòColors/Exposure‚Äô operation to add exposure compensation to shadows and midtones while retaining highlight details.\n\nFocus Group\n\nLayer masking and creative filter applications.\n\nPainting¬∂\n\nParametric Brushes\n\nA look at the advantages and flexibility of using Parametric Brushes.\n\nConfiguration¬∂\n\nHow to set the tile cache\n\nThe tile cache tells GIMP how much memory it can use before swapping some image data to disk. Setting the size of the tile cache can be critical for the performance of your system.\n\nHow to install fonts for use with GIMP\n\nHow to use MIDI devices with GIMP\n\nGNU/Linux only procedure.\n\nProgramming¬∂\n\nBasic GIMP Perl\n\nLearn how to write simple perl scripts using the gimp-perl module (GNU/Linux users only).\n\nAutomate Editing\n\nUsing GIMP Python to automate a workflow.\n\nAutomatic Creation of XCF from JPG\n\nImport XCF images a directory at a time.\n\nContributing new tutorials or fixes¬∂\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to be a developer to participate to the GIMP project. Some team members help with design, community management, bug triaging‚Ä¶ and some help with documentation and tutorials!\n\nThe only thing we ask of contributors is to use Libre licenses, which allow anyone to share, redistribute and modify the tutorials. It enables others to fix tutorials, even years later, even if the original author is not around anymore. This is the same rules as for our code, making GIMP a Free Software.\n\nRecommended licenses are:\n\nFree Art 1.3\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International\n\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\n\nCC0 1.0 Universal.\n\nSo you want to contribute? The process is simple, here is an example for the hypothetical case where you found an error in an existing tutorial. In such a case of editing existing text, your change will be automatically considered to be in the same license as chosen by the first author:\n\nAll tutorial contents can be found on our website‚Äôs repository (Gitlab). After clicking this link, feel free to browse to understand the file structure: Each tutorial is listed in a separate folder and each folder has a file called index.md which contains the text of the tutorial. There are many other files that accompany the tutorial inside the folder, such as images, screenshots and various assets.\n\nOnce you found a tutorial, which you want to edit, click the index.md link, and you will see a blue button saying ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù. Click it (obviously you need to have created a login first and be connected).\n\nGitlab will propose you to ‚Äúfork‚Äù the project because of missing permissions. Press ‚Äúfork‚Äù.\n\nOnce this is done, make your changes using the Markdown syntax.\n\nWhen you are happy with your edits, proceed to the bottom of the edit page, notice the ‚ÄúCommit message‚Äù field. Fill in relevant information explaining what you did. Click ‚ÄúCommit changes‚Äù.\n\nA ‚ÄúNew merge request‚Äù page will appear. Click ‚ÄúCreate merge request‚Äù.\n\nIt‚Äôs done! Now all you have to do is wait for one of the core members to review and validate your changes.\n\nIf you just need to change an image (e.g. because it shows an outdated version of GIMP), you may select the image in Gitlab and click the ‚ÄúReplace‚Äù button. It will propose you to upload a new version and to write a ‚ÄúCommit message‚Äù to explain the change. Please write down the desired Libre license for the image in the commit message. Then hit ‚ÄúReplace file‚Äù.\n\nFor more complicated changes, or if you want to propose new tutorials, it might be necessary to understand at least the basics of the git source versionning system we use. Alternatively, you may simply write your tutorial in a new text file on your machine (following Markdown syntax), then simply open a report and upload all the files (the text file as well as images and other resources) in this report. Do not forget to tell us the license you chose from the list given above.\n\nA list of legacy tutorials can be found here: All (Legacy) Tutorials List\n\nBear in mind that this list is being provided for legacy reasons only. They were originally made for very old hence outdated versions of GIMP and most of them do no use Libre licenses allowing editing."
