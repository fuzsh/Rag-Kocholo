        "text": "What is space? Why is it important? So much has been written about space from such diverse points of view that it is impossible here to be comprehensive or even representative, if I may borrow Neil Smith’s words (Smith, 2008). However, I will try to present a range of critical approaches to space in a compact manner. To be approached to a more comprehensive survey, one needs to cover at least anarchistic thoughts in Geography (Kristin Ross’s Communal Luxury: The Political Imaginary of the Paris Commune, for instance), and literary geography in Marshall Berman (1988), Raymond Williams (1973) and also in Bertrand Westphal’s Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces (2007) and Robert T. Tally Jr.’s Spatiality (2013)). There are lots of other areas of study which are not discussed in this paper: theories of imperialism, uneven and combined development, broader debates on Eurocentrism, and more importantly, theories of nationalism remain to be examined in the future. It should be also noted that a systematic study of critical theories of space cannot resist a thorough analysis of critical theories of time/temporality. To talk about space is inseparable from talking about time. The wider and deeper the study of theories of space, the more urgent will be the need to address theories of time. In addition, any comprehensive study of critical theories of space-time should take all scientific (notably physicist) approaches to space into account as well. There is always an issue with a survey paper like this, which is a highly selective review. It seems thus necessary here to highlight those criteria that guide me through emphasizing some aspects of the reviewed texts at the expense of the others. As it is noticeable in my paper, there is a disparity between the first and second half; between non-Marxist and Marxist approaches. At the most basic level, I aim to deal with the question ‘what is space’ to underline different conceptions of space. So, I review a range of perspectives first and foremost in order to see how different authors define space. Sections 0 to 5 are explicit attempts to achieve this goal. The tentative title of my dissertation proposal; “Production of Iran as a National Islamic State Space” adds another layer to my criteria. Some crucial methodological questions come to the fore: first of all, my research begins with particular historical geography of Iran. As a result, the historical and geographical specificity of conceptualization comes out. Hence is my justification to devote a sub-section (in the introduction) to a conceptual history of space. However, regarding Marxist approaches, the question ‘what is space’ is not the primary criterion. Here, I have two principles in my mind: on the one hand, a focus on the urban question, and on the other hand, concentration on the interrelated questions of scale and levels of analysis. These two aspects, in my view, are the most distinctive features of Marxist contributions to geography. Most Marxist approaches discuss urbanization or urban form as a mediation between different levels of reality and/or between geographical scales. Consequently, I have started the Marxist section with Benjamin’s argument on the interconnection between urban changes in Paris and the rise of France as an empire; and Jameson’s focus on the interrelatedness of the private and the global levels under the postmodern era. In my research, I am planning to study a range of social forces (including colonialization, capitalism, Islamism, nationalism, and urbanization) with distinct temporalities operating at different spatial scales. The selected Marxist approaches to space seem to provide me with the most relevant and suitable insights towards the interrelated questions of levels of analysis, abstraction, scale, and urbanization.\n\nTwo questions challenge the student of space and society above all others: will new technologies change the spatial basis of society? And if so, will this have an impact on society itself? For the urbanist, these two questions crystallise into one: what will the future of cities have to do with their past? Too often these questions are dealt with as though they were only matters of technology. However, they are much more than that. They are deep and difficult questions about the interdependence of technology, space and society that we do not yet have the theoretical apparatus to answer. We know that previous, revolutions’ in technology such as agriculture, urbanism and industrialisation associated radical changes in space with no less radical changes in social institutions. However, we do not know how far these linkages were contingent or necessary. We do not, in short, have a theory of society and space adequate to account for where we are now, and therefore we have no reasonable theoretical base for speculating about the future. In this paper, we suggest that a major reason for this theoretical deficit is that most previous attempts to build a theory of society and space have looked at society and tried to find space in its output. The result has been that the constructive role of space in creating and sustaining society has not been brought to the fore, or if it has, only in a way that is too general to permit the detailed specification of mechanisms. In this paper, we try to reverse the normal order of things by looking first at space and trying to discern society through space: by looking at society through the prism of space. Through this we try to define key mechanisms linking space to society and then use these to suggest how the questions about the future of cities and societies might be better defined.\n\nThe theory of architecture has an inquisitory point of view through the design, production or the use of space. Thinking upon the space and its interrelations between other subjects, the main problematic of this research is the space as configuration: how it constitutes itself and relates with human. Thus, the point can be divided into two groups which are the physical formation of the space and the social experience of the person self. Relating these two subjects, the patterns of space and the patterns of culture comes up to the issue. Spatial configuration can be defined as a progressive process which connects the built environment and the human's spatial experience and behaviour. Nevertheless, apart from this connection the configuration of space has also a cultural meaning which relates with the everyday life living patterns. With this regard, firstly the theoretical background is being discussed through examining the physical formation of the space: shape and spatial configuration. Secondly, the social experience of the human is being discussed while understanding human's spatial experience and cultural living patterns. On the third part, the space syntax technique opened up to the issue, reading both the patterns of space and culture. It is aimed to see the possibilities of space syntax in order to understand the social logic of the space. Thus, some plans will be analysed using the space syntax diagrammes and comparisons are being made. The relation between the patterns of space and culture will be investigated. The findings will be discussed upon the space syntax research which defines spatial configuration as the understanding of social dimension in human environment. Introduction Description of the Subject Built form (shape) can be defined as a physical appearance in architecture. Nevertheless, it constitutes a space having configurational properties which also have social and cultural meanings. Spatial arrangements consist of several organizational units in which different living patterns occur. Thus it becomes important to make a connection between the physical arrangements and the cultural living patterns of the space. According to Rapoport (1980), environments are thought before they are built. The design of a space has a prethinking process. Architects configure the space as they use this prethinking and designing process. Then there is a process of producing and using the space as it is presented. Pearson & Richards (1994) examines this as ''We build in order to think and act. The relationship is essentially dynamic and reflexive. Winston Churchill said that-first we shape our buildings and afterwards our buildings shape us-''. So we can consider that there is a kind of interaction between the space we built and the built space that effects us. The conception of a space can be shallowly defined as a series of objects that exists and the organisation of them or in other words the way they come together. So the first part of the research subject can be examined the space and the spatial organisation. On the other hand, there is also a human who involve in the space and constitute a new kind of meaning in the space. Heidegger focuses on this point as ''What is being?'' and the word ''Dasein'' which refers to ''Being there''. For Heidegger, a building was built according to the specifics of place and inhabitants, shaped by its physical and human topography (Sharr, 2007). Thus, the second part comprises from the human as involving in the space with its internal experiences. In addition, the human spatial experience lead us to the cultural living patterns. The reason why there is a two-sided relation between the space and the human is that of the patterns of the space which affect the human and the patterns of the culture that influence the space. The third part of the subject is then understanding both the patterns of space and the culture."
