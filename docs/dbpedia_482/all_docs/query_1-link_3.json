        "text": "Sri Lankan cricketer\n\nConroy Ievers Gunasekera, sometimes spelt Gunasekara (14 July 1920 – 29 July 2010) was a Sri Lankan cricketer who played first-class cricket for Ceylon from 1949 to 1964, in the period before the country gained Test status. He captained Ceylon several times in the early 1960s.[1]\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nGunasekera was educated at Royal College Colombo where he played in the Royal-Thomian encounter, starting from 1938. He entered Colombo Law College in 1940, but interrupted his legal studies to join the Ceylon Defence Force as a Second Lieutenant during World War II.[2]\n\nHe started playing cricket for the Sinhalese Sports Club under the captaincy of Fredrick C. de Saram.[2] Thereafter Gunasekera went on to play for the Ceylon team. He also represented the Commonwealth, scoring a hundred in the match Commonwealth v MCC, when he took part in a partnership of 207 with the Australian all-rounder Keith Miller.[1] He brought up his century with a six, and Miller did the same shortly afterwards.[3] Up until the 1980s he played for the SSC.\n\nHis highest first-class score was 212 for Ceylon against Madras in the annual Gopalan Trophy match in 1958–59.[1] He scored 120 and 30 against Pakistan in 1948–49.[4] With his leg-spin he took 8 for 69 and 2 for 78 for a Ceylon team against a strong Pakistan Combined Services team in 1953-54[5] and 7 for 63 and 3 for 91 for Ceylon against Mysore in 1957–58.[6]\n\nDavid Sheppard described him as \"a great cricketer who would surely have played Test cricket if he had qualified for another country ... a fine, forcing batsman, driving with great power, and a good leg-spin bowler\".[7]\n\nGunasekera joined Walker & Sons Limited as a manager and went on to serve as a director.[2] His uncle was Dr Churchill Gunasekara, who also captained the Ceylon cricket team.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
