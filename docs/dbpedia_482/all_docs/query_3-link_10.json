        "text": "The National Medal of Honor Museum in Arlington, Texas will serve as the premier national institution dedicated to the stories, impact, and legacy of the service members who went on to become Medal of Honor recipients.\n\nWith this project, Americans will gather to learn and pay tribute to our country’s bravest heroes in a state-of-the-art facility. Through recipient stories of courage and valor, the Museum will inspire current and future generations to discover and develop the shared values inherent in every Medal of Honor recipient — COURAGE & SACRIFICE, COMMITMENT & INTEGRITY, CITIZENSHIP & PATRIOTISM.\n\nThe Museum is symbolic of the weighted choices and sacrifices each Medal recipient boldly bears during combat as well as the characteristic strength of each branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. Immersive, open, and circular exhibits connect us to each hero, each other, and the world beyond.\n\nNeither a war memorial nor a military museum, the National Medal of Honor Museum is a humbling endeavor that will take visitors on a narrative journey through the life stories of ordinary people who made extraordinary choices above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nMuseum footprint encompasses over 100,000 square feet, cornering five acres of waterfront in Arlington, Texas.\n\nOver 31,000 square feet of Exhibition Galleries as well as dedicated spaces for meetings, symposiums, memorials, and ceremonies.\n\nHeadquarters of the National Medal of Honor Griffin Institute, an organization that addresses our nation’s character gap and fills it by focusing on the values and valor of the Medal of Honor and all who have earned it."
