        "text": "The old part of Galle – Galle Fort, is one of our favorite places in Sri Lanka. We first visited Galle in 2005 after spending a few days in the capital, Colombo. As this was our first time in Sri Lanka, we were afraid that all the cities of Sri Lanka would be just as noisy and chaotic as Colombo, but luckily not! We immediately fell in love with the old town of Galle and its cozy, laid-back vibe, and we have been back many times over the years, the last time in 2023.\n\nThe city of Galle consists of a new part and an old part. The older city inside the fort walls is lovely, full of color and texture, and is what attracts most visitors to Galle. This guide focuses on the old Galle town – Galle Fort.\n\nAs its name implies, Galle Fort is surrounded by a large, ancient city wall. The city was built by Europeans (first the Portuguese, then the Dutch, and later the British). You can feel the European heritage vibe as you walk along the narrow, cobble-stoned streets lined with old colonial houses.\n\nInside the Galle Fort are churches, mosques, and temples – an example of how different religions have co-existed peacefully side by side in Sri Lanka.\n\nGalle Fort isn’t just a is still a working community with administrative offices, courts, cafes, shops, restaurants, hotels, and more. The buildings also house artists, writers, photographers, designers, and poets. Foreigners (Europeans and Indians) own a third of the about 400 houses.\n\nThe city is like no other city in Sri Lanka, and wandering through the narrow streets makes you forget that you are in Sri Lanka. It feels like walking the streets of a medieval city in Europe!\n\nGalle Fort – A Unesco World Heritage Site\n\nGalle Fort and its unique heritage value was recognized by the UNESCO and declared a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1988:\n\nOld Town of Galle is the best example of a fortified city built by Europeans in South and South-East Asia, showing the interaction between European architectural styles and South Asian traditions.\n\nUnesco World Heritage Convention\n\nSri Lanka has an incredible 8 Unesco World Heritage Sites in total:\n\nAncient City of Polonnaruwa\n\nAncient City of Sigiriya\n\nCentral Highlands of Sri Lanka\n\nOld Town of Galle and its Fortifications\n\nRangiri Dambulla Cave Temple\n\nSacred City of Anuradhapura\n\nSacred City of Kandy\n\nSinharaja Forest Reserve\n\nWe hope you find this Galle travel guide helpful when planning your own Galle itinerary! 🙂\n\nA Brief History Of Galle\n\nAncient Trading Port For Cinnamon\n\nGalle Harbor has been the center point of the international cinnamon trade for millennia. Cinnamon originated in Sri Lanka. And as early as 2000 BC, this exotic spice was traded from Galle to ancient Egypt. Some historians believe that Galle is synonymous with the port Tarshish, referred to in the Bible’s Old Testament as King Solomon’s (the king of ancient Israel) great Eastern metal emporium. He had accumulated great wealth in silver, gold, tin, and iron.\n\nGalle’s first historical written existence can be found in Ptolemy’s 125–150 CE world map. Back then, it was a busy trading port, trading cinnamon with countries like Greece, Arab countries, and China.\n\nThe Portuguese Invasion – 1505\n\nThe Europeans have been in Galle for a long time. The first ones were the Portuguese as early as 1505 when one of their fleets bound for the Maldives was blown off course and ended up in the harbor of Galle. The Portuguese liked it so much that they relocated here in 1588 and built Galle Fort (Fortaleza Santa Cruz) out of palm trees and mud.\n\nIt is said that it was the Portuguese who gave the city its name, “Galle,” after hearing a cock (galo in Portuguese) crowing. If that is true or not, no one knows. Another theory is that Galle derives from the Sinhala word gala (meaning rock), which is probably more likely if you ask me. 🙂\n\nThe Portuguese spread their influence from Galle to southern Sri Lanka, imposing Christianity on the local Sri Lankans. You can see this still today, as common Sri Lankan family names are Silva, Pererira, and Fernando.\n\nBy the 1630s, the Portuguese, from their main headquarters in Galle, had command over more than 280 local villages in the southwest of Sri Lanka. These villages mainly grew cinnamon, which the Portuguese exported to Europe.\n\nThe Dutch Invasion – 1640\n\nIn March 1640, the Dutch (allied with the Sinhalese king in Kandy) broke this Portuguese cinnamon monopoly after a four-day naval bombardment of Galle. Several hundreds of Portugese and Duch lives were claimed.\n\nThe Dutch extended the original Portuguese fort to its present dimensions, adding more bastions, ramparts, churches, houses, underground channels, and streets within its tall brick walls. You will see many of these old buildings as many Dutch-era buildings still stand in and around Galle.\n\nThe British Invasion – 1796\n\nTsunami & The Renovation Of Galle – 2004\n\nGalle was heavily damaged by the Tsunami of 2004. In the following years, it underwent an extensive renovation and reconstruction project launched by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs in Sri Lanka. The project aimed to restore some of the old heritage buildings back to their old glory, like the All Saint’s Church and the lighthouse. The Governments of Sri Lanka and the Netherlands financially supported the restoration.\n\nMany of the old townhouses have been bought by expats and rich Sri Lankans and Indians and renovated into beautiful holiday homes, restaurants, cafes, and boutique hotels.\n\nThe Old Dutch Hospital building was renovated and restored in 2014 as a dining and shopping complex.\n\nVisiting Galle – Sri Lanka’s Unesco World Heritage Fort Town\n\nThis article mainly focuses on the highlights and main attractions of the old town of Galle. Galle also has a modern part, which is also a fun (although a bit chaotic) area to explore. I have, however, not covered the modern part of Galle in this article.\n\nThis article is structured as a DIY walking tour. But feel free to skip and add stops to your walk through Galle according to your time, preferences, and interests.\n\nAlthough this walking tour of Galle Fort can be done in one day as a day trip, we highly recommend spending a night or two in this fantastic ancient town.\n\nThen, you get to soak up the historical vibe of this town thoroughly, enjoy the many excellent restaurants and cafes, experience the hospitality at one of the many beautifully restored boutique hotels, and beat the crowds as the tourist buses leave in the afternoon.\n\nJoining A Guided Tour Of Galle Fort\n\nThis travel guide to Galle Fort contains all the information you need to explore Galle on your own, but if you are short on time, joining a guided tour can be a very efficient way to experience the highlights. There are several tours to choose from; some of our favorites include:\n\nGuided Walking Tour of Galle Fort\n\nThis guided walking tour of Galle Fort lasts approximately 2 hours. Here, you’ll get a chance to walk through the old fort of Galle with a local, professional guide and hear the histories of the colonial times when Galle was a thriving trading port. This is a fun and exciting way of exploring Galle Fort. Take an afternoon walking tour (16:30/ 4:30 pm – 18:30/ 6:30 pm) to beat the heat.\n\nClick here for info and the latest prices on the Guided Walking Tour of Galle Fort\n\nGuided Cycling Tour of Galle Fort\n\nIf you like cycling and want a little more “action” than walking around the streets of Galle Fort, why not join a guided cycling tour? A local, experienced guide will tell you all about Galle and its history while you paddle on your bike around the city.\n\nThis 2-hour cycling tour takes you through the streets of Galle Fort, and you will stop at the highlights and attractions around the city. If you want a longer bike ride, this 4-hour cycling tour takes you to the old colonial Galle Fort, a local market, and a temple.\n\nFull-Day Galle Sightseeing Tour\n\nIf you want to see more of the beautiful Galle area (and not only Galle Fort), a great option is to join a full-day tour.\n\nOn this full-day Galle tour, you get to explore the old Galle Fort town, as well as visit a tea plantation and factory, a sea turtle conservation project, and go on a mangrove boat safari where you get to see wild crocodiles, birds, and many monkeys. Your guide and driver will pick you up and return to your hotel (wherever you stay along the southwestern coast).\n\nClick here for info and the latest prices on the Full-Day Galle Area Tour\n\nThis full-day Galle tour takes you through the streets and attractions of Galle Fort with a local guide and the Martin Wickramasighne Folk Art Museum (south of Galle Fort). The tour ends with a delicious seafood lunch at a beachfront restaurant, and you will get to see the fascinating stilt fishermen that Sri Lanka is so famous for. Hotel pickup and drop-off are included, as are all entrance tickets and food and drinks.\n\nClick here for info and the latest prices on the full-day Galle History Tour\n\nThis walking route takes you to Galle’s highlights, attractions, museums, and sights. It starts at the main gate into the Galle Fort.\n\nThe map above: All of Galle Fort’s attractions (A-I + A-H)\n\nHere is an overview of the 18 top things to do in Galle Fort. They are grouped into two: 10 (A-I) + 8 (A-H) since Google Maps unfortunately only allows ten entries to a walking route (sorry about that):\n\nYou can do this walk in about one hour if you walk quickly through it. However, this walking tour is ideal if you have a full day to explore Galle Fort (preferably with a stayover at one of the many stunning hotels). Then you can stop, take photos, enter museums and churches, have a pit stop or two for an afternoon tea or a gelato, and finally, see the sunset and enjoy dinner with some drinks.\n\nI hope you enjoy this walking tour and find it helpful when planning your visit to Galle! ♥\n\nEnter the old town Galle Fort through the Main Gate. After stepping through the Main Gate (along Stadium Rd), you will face a roundabout connecting Church Street, Rampart Street, and Lighthouse Street. Turn right along Rampart St. and walk towards the Galle Clock Tower (easily spotted).\n\nA. Main (New) Gate, Clock Tower & Northern Ramparts\n\nWhen entering Galle Fort through the New Main Gate, the Northern Ramparts is the first stop on this DIY walking tour. The northern rampart is a trio of bastions built in 1620 by the Portuguese. In the center is the relatively new Main Gate.\n\nThe New Main Gate, located between the Sun and Moon bastions (at the end of Lighthouse Street), was constructed by the British in 1873. From the main gate, you can see the Clock Tower, which stands upon the Moon Bastion.\n\nNorthern Ramparts – Star, Moon, and Sun Bastions\n\nThese three bastions (forming the Northern Ramparts) were initially named after saints but were later given new names by the Dutch in 1667.\n\nStarting in the West, their original names and current names are:\n\nSao Antonio (St Anthony) – Star Bastion\n\nConceycao (Immaculate Conception) – Moon Bastion\n\nSao Iago (St James) – Sun Bastion\n\nMoon Bastion\n\nWhen turning right after coming through the Main (New) Gate, you will first walk past Moon Bastion with its Clock Tower.\n\nThe Portuguese built the Moon Bastion in the 16th Century. It was constructed as a tall gun tower.\n\nFive canons are mounted on the upper terrace of Moon Bastion, with an underground ammunition storage underneath. The Dutch used the terrace as an observation deck since it has spectacular panoramic views of the fort’s interior, the mainland, and the international sea routes to the south.\n\nGalle Fort Clock Tower\n\nThe Clock Tower was constructed in 1883, designed by Joh Henry Gues Landon, and stands on top of the former guard room upon the Moon Bastion. It is 25.3 m (83 feet) high, built by stones, and is an icon of the Galle City.\n\nIt was paid for by the people of Galle as a gratitude to Dr. P. D. Anthonisz (1822-1903), a doctor and first president of the Ceylon branch of the British Medical Association. He was also the leader of a campaign to stop the planned demolition of the ramparts in 1889. Thankfully, he succeeded, as the ramparts are now a huge tourist attraction in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe clock tower has a plate with the following inscriptions:\n\nThis tower erected by public subscription to the perpetual memory of Peter Daniel Anthonisz (born in Galle) in testimony of his skill and benevolence in relieving human suffering. MDCCCLXXXIII.\n\nInscriptions on the Galle clock tower\n\nStar Bastion\n\nContinue walking west towards the sea, and you will soon enter the Star Bastion.\n\nStar Bastion is located to the very west of the Northern Ramparts, close to the sea. The Portuguese built it in the 16th Century to separate Galle Fort from the mainland. You can see several cannon emplacements on the two terraces that form Star Bastion.\n\nThe daughter of the Dutch Commander at the time, Adrian van Rothaas, ceremonially fired the first cannon shot from this bastion. You can still see the original terracotta floor tiles here. Under the Star Bastion is Galle Fort’s main underground gunpowder magazine.\n\nSun Bastion\n\nFrom Star Bastion, walk back (east) along the Fort Wall, which goes past Moon Bastion, over the Main (New) Gate, and ends up at the Sun Bastion (to the east).\n\nThe Portuguese also built the Sun Bastion in the 16th Century. A tunnel was built across this bastion, which the Portuguese used as an access route to the fort.\n\nThis is where the primary battle stood in 1640 when the Dutch attacked the Portuguese Fort and won. The Dutch then expanded the bastion by adding a lower terrace and renaming it the Sun Bastion in 1667. The lower terrace had four cannons, while the upper had ten cannons. The soldiers at this bastion’s main duty was to keep an eye on the entrance into the fort.\n\nAfter exploring the bastions of the Northern Ramparts (Moon, Star, and Sun Bastions), it is time to venture into the city. From the Main Gate (with your back towards the gate), turn left in the roundabout onto Church Street. Walk south along Church Street a few hundred meters until you see the Galle National Museum (B) on your right-hand side.\n\nB. Galle National Museum\n\nThe Galle National Museum is located in a beautiful colonial building. This is actually Galle Fort’s oldest Dutch building, constructed in 1656.\n\nOriginally, it was a shop for the Dutch garrison at the fort. It was later rebuilt in the late 19th century into the billiards room of the adjacent New Oriental Hotel (now the Amangalla Hotel). The white building resembles a bungalow, with columns supporting the roof.\n\nThe building was renovated and reopened as a museum in 1986, where you can see exhibits from the Portugues, Dutch, and British periods of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe museum has three galleries:\n\nFirst Gallery: Turtle shell jewelry, Beeralu lacework items (an old Sri Lankan artwork weaving of lace), and Sri Lankan wooden masks\n\nSecond Gallery: Furniture and weapons from the Dutch period\n\nThird Gallery: The newest gallery (opened in 2013) contains items from the trade between China and Sri Lanka.\n\nWe weren’t that impressed by this museum. It is dark and cramped and not that well organized. Its highlight is the building itself, in our opinion. So, if you are short on time or are just not that interested in museums, you should skip the Galle National Museum.\n\nWalk south along Church Street and see the grand old Amangalla Hotel on your right-hand side, next to the Galle National Museum.\n\nC. Amangalla Hotel\n\nThe Amangalla Hotel was constructed in 1683 as the living quarter for the United East India Company officers, or VOC (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie in Dutch). It was later converted into a three-story military garrison.\n\nIt opened in 1864 as the Oriental Hotel, where most of its guests were European passengers from the steamers arriving at Galle Harbor.\n\nThe hotel was bought in 1899 by Albert Richard Ephraums (1846-1904) and rebranded into the New Oriental Hotel (NOH). The New Oriental Hotel was a famous luxury hotel for 140 years. Albert’s granddaughter, Nesta Brohier (1905-1995), was the hotel’s manager for 35 of these years. She got the nickname “the grand old lady of Galle Fort.” Fun fact: She was born at the hotel, in room 25!\n\nNew Oriental Hotel can brag about famous guests like Paul Theroux (famous American writer), Proctor Bawa (lawyer and the father of the famous architect Geoffrey Bawa), and former Sri Lankan president J. R. Jayewardene.\n\nToday, the hotel belongs to the international group of Aman Resorts. The 5-star luxury hotel opened in 2005 and has changed its name to Amangalla Hotel. Aman means “peace,” and Galla is the Sinhalese name for Galle. The Amangalla Hotel has over 30 rooms and suites, a Spa, and a large swimming pool.\n\nStep inside the hotel and marvel at its tall ceilings and the beautiful terracotta and ceramic-tiled floor in the Groote Zaal (Great Hall), which now houses the hotel’s reception and restaurant and is open to the public. We had afternoon tea at the Amangalla Hotel’s shuttered veranda, which was delicious!\n\nWhen we visited, they had two different afternoon tea sets on the menu. We opted for the one with tea, scones, and jam. We loved sitting on the veranda, watching life go by on the street.\n\nContinue walking south along Church Street, and you will soon see the Dutch Reformed Church (or Groote Kerk, D) on your right-hand side.\n\nD. Dutch Reformed Church – Groote Kerk\n\nThe Dutch Reformed Church, or Groote Kerk (meaning Big Church), is located at the highest point in the Fort, more than 12 m (39 ft) above sea level. It is one of the oldest Protestant churches in Sri Lanka.\n\nIt is a stunning white stone church, beautifully decorated with a unique roof. It is constructed in a cruciform Doric style reminiscent of the Wolvendaal Church in Colombo City.\n\nGroote Kerk’s foundation was laid in 1682, but most of the building you see today was built after 1752. It was built by the Commander of Galle at the time, Casparus de Jong, in gratitude for the birth of his baby daughter. Church records show that she was baptized here in August 1755.\n\nStep into the church and marvel at the tall sky-blue wooden ceiling, arched doors and windows, the two big wooden front doors, the original stained-glass windows, and the honeycomb floor design.\n\nUnique features of the church include the original 18th-century canopied calamander-wood pulpit and the organ brought from Colombo to Groote Kerk in 1760.\n\nAs you walk around on the floor, you will notice that the floor is covered with several old Dutch gravestones and family crests. Some are dated to the church’s dedication in 1755.\n\nThe next stop on this itinerary is the Galle Library (E), located just next to the church.\n\nE. Galle Library\n\nSri Lanka’s oldest public library is next. It is in a lovely bungalow with an arched entrance and a red Kandyan-style roof. It was built in 1871 as a reading room for the Ceylon Rifles Regiment. In 1871, it became a library open to the public.\n\nThe library has some old, unique first-edition volumes and an important collection of Sinhalese literature. It’s worth a quick stop.\n\nGalle Post Office (F) is next up, just next to Galle Library.\n\nF. Galle Post Office\n\nAnother beautiful Dutch building is the Post Office. It has beautiful features like a wide colonnaded veranda, an antiquated wooden door, and a lovely, well-kept original interior. This was a post office from the British colonial era in the 1760s.\n\nThe building has been under renovation since the roof unexpectedly collapsed in 2019. It was covered in scaffolding when we visited in 2022, so we have, unfortunately, no photos of it.\n\nContinue walking south along Church Street, reaching All Saints Church (G) on your right-hand side.\n\nG. All Saints Church\n\nThis beautiful Anglican Gothic Revival-style church was built in 1871. It was designed by the Victorian architect James George Smither, who also designed the Old Town Hall and National Museum in Colombo City.\n\nStep inside the church and pay attention to features like several beautifully carved arches supported by stone columns, two rows of heavy teak pews engraved with the Star of David, and original stained-glass windows.\n\nWalk down Queen Street, where you will notice a big old colonial-style mansion – The Dutch Commander’s Residence (H), also called British Queen’s House, right in the cross-section between Church St and Queen St.\n\nH. Dutch Commander’s Residence and Belfry/ British Queen’s House\n\nAs you enter Queen Street, you can’t avoid noticing this big old mansion called the British Queen’s House. It was built by the Dutch in 1683 as the residence of the leader of the United East India Company officers, or VOC, Thomas Van Rhee. The building is enormous, covering a whole block. This was where the Dutch governors who administrated Galled lived.\n\nAlso, after the British took over in 1815, they continued to use this as a residence for their administrators and named the house Queen’s House. Sir Frederick Noth was the first British governor to move into the house in 1802. The side of the house that faces Leynbaan Cross Street was used as a bank – the Oriental Bank, Galle’s first bank.\n\nYou will notice the small belfry tower, which was built in 1701. The tower still has the original bell, which once tolled every hour, timed by an hourglass.\n\nThe house was then sold at auction in 1972, and it is still privately owned, although it is not renovated. Maybe it will be turned into a boutique hotel one day; who knows?\n\nThe next stop on this itinerary is opposite the Dutch Commander’s Residence – Maritime Archeology Musuem (I).\n\nI. Maritime Archaeology Museum\n\nConstructed in 1672 as a spice warehouse, it became the National Maritime Archaeology Museum in 2010.\n\nThis is the longest Dutch building in Southeast Asia, with its 130 m long outer wall, and is our favorite museum in Galle Fort. The museum has an extensive collection of artifacts that have been discovered around Gall and its harbor.\n\nThe museum has a total of four galleries.\n\nHere, you can see things like ancient clay amphorae, which were used to transport olive oil and wine from the Mediterranean, an old 15-th century sandstone table with inscriptions in Persian, Chinese, and Tamil, a ceramic lion-dog which is 2000 years old from the Han-dynasty, a Vishnu in bronze from the 9th century, two fantastic wooden Buddhas of Thai and Indonesian origin.\n\nYou can also see some replicas of Kandyan paintings and a replica of the famous “Wheel of the Universe” carving at Anuradhapura.\n\nIn total, the museum is worth a visit. The displays are well-marked, and you can find a shop in the basement with a pretty good selection of books about Sri Lanka. If you only have interests or the time to visit one museum in Galle, the Maritime Archaeology Museum should be it.\n\nThe long building along Queen Street has a gate in the middle – The Old Gate. Walk through the gate and continue towards the sea until you see the Zwart Black Bastion (J).\n\nJ. The Old Gate & Zwart Black Bastion\n\nThe Zwart Bastion (Black Bastion) got its name from its sooty black color, resulting from standing above the Portuguese gun smithery. It was built by the Portuguese in 1620, using coral rag and limestones.\n\nOriginally, the Black Bastion supported eight big cannons facing the harbor and connected by a secret tunnel.\n\nThe Old Gate also dates back to Portuguese times, and it was the only entrance into Galle Fort until 1873 when the New Main Gate was built in the north (see A. on this walking tour). Notice the emblem of the cock and a Dutch VOIC cres dated 1669 on the other wall above the old gate. The cock is the symbol of Galle.\n\nYou can easily reach and walk through the Old Gate, but the Zwart Black Bastion is a little bit less accessible as you have to walk inside the fence of the Deputy Inspector General’s Office (junction of Queen’a and Hospital Streets). We met a friendly employee at the office who gladly showed us around the bastion (for a small donation).\n\nAlternatively, walk to the sandy fishing harbor north of the Old Gate (about 200 m), where you can view the Black Bastion from a distance. And if you are here in the early morning (06:00 – 09:00 am), you can also witness the daily busy fish market.\n\nThe Old Gate also houses the entrance to the National Maritime Museum. You should, however, NOT confuse this with the superior Maritime Archaeology Musuem around the corner. In our opinion, the National Maritime Museum is not as good, and we’ve therefore not included it in this itinerary. However, if you love museums, feel free to stop for a visit.\n\nSince Google Maps only allows 10 points on a walking route (A-J), I had to break the highlights of the Galle Fort walking tour into two. So here is the second part (consisting of 8 stops; A-H):\n\nAfter the Old Gate and Black Bastion, head south to Court Square (A) and continue this walk around Galle.\n\nA. Law Court Square\n\nThe Law Court Square is a public green space. However, it is paved over. Large century-old Banyan trees shade the space. Magistrate’s Court (to the west) and District Court (to the east) surround this square, and crowds gather here on weekdays to watch court cases in progress.\n\nEvery first Sunday of the month, the flea market Galle Pola is held at the Law Court Square from 10:00 a.m. until 16:00/ 4 p.m.\n\nYou must be starving by now, so it’s time to head to a place that sounds like a hospital but is actually a hub of restaurants and cafes – Old Dutch Hospital (B). You find it at the south end of Law Court Square (east side of Hospital Street).\n\nB. Old Dutch Hospital – Restaurants & Cafes – Lunch Time\n\nOld Dutch Hospital is a large, old, renovated Dutch building with restaurants, cafes, and shops. The Dutch built the building in the 17th century, and it served as a hospital and smallpox research center.\n\nIt is one of the oldest buildings in Galle Fort. It was used as a barracks and an administrative office during the British colonial period. After Sri Lanka’s independence, the building became the Galle Town Hall.\n\nThe building itself is beautiful, with balconies on both sides. Today, it is a modern shopping and dining mall with eating places, jewelers, a spa, and small boutique shops. This is the perfect place for lunch. Our favorites at Old Dutch Hospital are:\n\nA Minute By Tuk-Tuk – Serves a wide selection ranging from Chinese chili pot and prawn curry to chicken tandoori burgers\n\nCannon – A western-style restaurant that serves Mexican and Indian dishes, but also pizza and pasta.\n\nBoth restaurants are on the second floor, with tables on the terrace and excellent sea views.\n\nIf you feel knackered and need total relaxation and some pampering, Old Dutch Hospital also has an excellent spa – Olu Spa. 🙂\n\nFrom Old Dutch Hospital (B), walk west along Pedlar Street and turn right along Leyn Baan Street, where you will see the next stop on this itinerary – Historical Mansion Museum (C).\n\nC. Historical Mansion Museum\n\nI would say this is not a proper museum, more like a gallery and shop privately owned by Abdul Gaffar. It is, however, a fun place to look around. Here you can see colonial artworks, sculptures, pottery and ceramics, coins, Chinese porcelain, weapons, and jewelry. The gallery also has a collection of more modern things like antique typewriters and old cameras.\n\nThe museum is housed in a beautiful old residential building that was in total ruin until restored in 1992. A cool thing about this building is that they have kept one of the walls unplastered to show how it looked before the restoration. Here, you can see the 10 m tall and 1 m thick wall made of clay and coral rock. The building is probably from the mid-18th century.\n\nThe building’s front is a shop selling jewelry, gems, brass, copper handicrafts, and some antiques. We just walked through this shop part of the building and felt no pressure to buy. The museum itself is free. You can also see demonstrations of how they traditionally hand-cut and polish gemstones and how Beeralu lacemaking is done, for which Galle is famous.\n\nFrom the Historical Mansion Museum (C), walk south along Leyn Baan St to the Galle Lighthouse (D), an icon of Galle.\n\nD. Galle Lighthouse and the Southern Ramparts\n\nGalle Lighthouse is 28 m tall and was built in 1940. It is the icon of Galle and a favorite photo spot among the locals and visitors.\n\nIt is not open to the public, but if you catch the caretaker and ask nicely (like we did), you might get lucky and be allowed inside the lighthouse. We were allowed to climb up, and the view from the top was spectacular! The ladder climb is steep and not recommended if you’re afraid of heights or confined spaces.\n\nThe Lighthouse is a part of the Southern Ramparts, consisting of two bastions:\n\nUtrecht Bastion (to the east)\n\nFlag Rock Bastion (to the west)\n\nUtrecht Bastion has a small sandy beach where you can dip your toes.\n\nFlag Rock Bastion is famous for its “fort jumpers.”\n\nThese are a group of brave young men of freestyle divers who, for a few dollars, will leap from the rock into the narrow channel 13 m below. It looks insane! You should, however, NOT even consider trying this yourself. These guys are experienced and know these shallow waters.\n\nWalk west on the fort wall or the street (Hospital Street + Rampart Street), running along the wall until you see the Sri Sudharmalaya Temple (E) on your right-hand side.\n\nE. Sri Sudharmalaya Temple\n\nSri Sudharmalaya is Galle’s only Buddhist temple, dating back to 1889. It resembles a church, except for its giant white dagoba. Step inside, and you will see a reclining Buddha statue and a quaint diorama of the first Buddhist monks in Sri Lanka.\n\nFrom the temple, turn right onto the street Sri Sudharmalaya MW. The street makes a sharp right turn and continues as Parawa St. Walk south along Parawa St. until you reach Pedlar St. (F).\n\nF. Parawa and Pedlar Streets\n\nParawa Street is named after the “Parrua” community of fishermen who once lived in this part of Galle and who descend from South India.\n\nThis area of Galle Fort (Parawa Street and Pedlar Street) is lined with restaurants, cafes, bars, jewelers, hotels, clothing boutiques, and souvenir shops. It is a fun area to walk around in. Sit down, have tea, coffee, and gelato, and maybe buy some souvenirs and gifts to bring back home.\n\nSee further down in this article under Where To Shop and Where To Eat for our favorite shops and restaurants in this area.\n\nIf you like ice cream (I mean, who doesn’t?!), head over to the Isle of Gelato (on 60A Pedlar Street), which makes the best ice cream ever. They have cute indoor and outdoor seating as well, and you can choose between ice cream and sorbet, authentic Italian gelato.\n\nI love the Salted Caramel and the Passion Fruit Sorbet. However, the Pistachio flavor is probably my no. 1 favorite. Their vegan cashew caramel is also very popular. They also have shops in Weligama, Ella, Arugambay, and Colombo. Check out Isle of Gelato’s Facebook page.\n\nFrom Pedlar Street, walk north along Lighthouse St., turn left along Middle St., and onto the fort wall again. You are now at the western wall part, called Western Ramparts (G).\n\nG. Western Ramparts\n\nA large green grass field separates the Western Ramparts of Galle Fort from the old town. This is a popular place for locals to play informal cricket with friends and family.\n\nFour full or half bastions once stood on top of the Western wall (from south to north):\n\nTriton Bastion\n\nNeptune Bastion\n\nAeolus Bastion\n\nStar Bastion (a part of the Northern Ramparts, which I describe at the beginning of this walking route)\n\nMost of these four bastions on the Western Ramparts are sadly demolished and barely recognizable.\n\nTriton Bastion\n\nTriton Bastion once had a windmill that drew water from the sea to sprinkle the dusty roads of Galle. Quite clever if you ask me!\n\nNeptune Bastion\n\nThe Dutch built Neptune Bastion in the 17th century. They had cannons mounted on the bastion to defend the city from attacks from the sea. The bastion is named after Neptune, the Greek God of the Sea.\n\nWhen the British took over Galle, Lloyd of London (who did shipping in Galle harbor) constructed a signal station at Neptune Bastion. The signal station was a circular building with a flag upon this bastion. They would signal to their collaborating businesses about joint shipping operations with different flags of various colors.\n\nWalk north along the western wall until you reach the Star Bastion (H).\n\nEnd Your Day In Galle With Sunset & Dinner\n\nThe Western Ramparts (especially Triton Bastion) is the best place to see the sunset.\n\nHere, you can enjoy a spellbinding sunset over the ocean – the perfect ending to a day of sightseeing at the Galle Fort. This area of Galle is particularly popular on Sundays when Sri Lankan families come for an afternoon sunset stroll and a picnic.\n\nThere you have it, our recommended DIY walking tour of Galle Fort with all its highlights. After the sun has gone down, it is time for dinner. If you want tips on where to eat in Galle Fort, check out the list below of our favorite restaurants in Galle.\n\nWhere To Eat In Galle Fort\n\nMany of the hotels in Galle Fort have restaurants, like Fort Bazaar Hotel’s fantastic Church Street Social Restaurant and Fort Printers Hotel’s lovely terrace restaurant. Fort Dew Guesthouse also has a good budget restaurant, the Rooftop Cafe.\n\nRegarding pubs and nightlife in Galle Fort, your best bet would be one of the larger hotels or the cluster of restaurants and bars in the Old Dutch Hospital building. Many of the smaller restaurants and cafes in Galle Fort are unlicensed for selling alcohol.\n\nHere are our favorite restaurants and cafes in Galle Fort:\n\nPedlar’s Inn Cafe\n\nClaiming to be Galle Fort’s oldest coffee shop, Pedlar’s Inn Cafe is one of Galle’s most charming restaurants. It is set in a stunning 250-year-old Dutch house. You can dine in the stylish indoor restaurant (with air-con), in the cafe lounge part, in the open courtyard, or at the tables on the street terrace.\n\nThe menu is a mix of Asian, Middle Eastern, and Italian dishes, plus burgers and sandwiches.\n\nThey have an ice cream shop – Pedlar’s Inn Gelato, and a pizza place – Bacuzzi, on the other side of the road. We tried both the pizza and gelato, and they were heavenly good!\n\nThe Bungalow Restaurant & Bar\n\nIt is set in an old colonial building with a lovely courtyard. This is a fantastic restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff.\n\nThey serve great seafood, fusion (Asian/ Western), and Sri Lankan rice and curry. We had dinner here one night, and the food and service was excellent. It is currently no. 2 on TripAdvisor for the best restaurants in Galle.\n\nAQUA – Aqua Forte, Aqua Pizza, and Aqua Forno Bakery\n\nAqua has three restaurants: Aqua Forte and Aqua Pizza (in the same building on Leyn Baan Street) and Aqua Forno (on Church Street). We tried all three, and the food was delicious!\n\nAqua Forte is the most upscale standalone restaurant in Galle Fort. The owner and manager is from Italy, and the restaurant serves handmade pasta and authentic main courses. Here, you also find an extensive list of imported Italian wines and a set menu with food and wine pairings.\n\nAqua Pizza serves delicious authentic Neapolitan pizza. The restaurant is set in a beautiful, naturally ventilated colonial house with arched doorways and high ceilings.\n\nAqua Forno Bakery serves homemade pastries and breads, perfect for breakfast and lunch. We had lunch here and loved the fresh ciabatta. It felt like we were in Italy. We sat outside on the terrace, and it was such a pleasant atmosphere.\n\nThe Pasta Factory\n\nAn authentic Italian restaurant serving the most delicious homemade pasta (also gluten-free). I had pasta with pesto sauce, while Espen had pasta bolognese, and they were both super good. The passion mojito mocktail was terrific, too!\n\nWe also talked to the super-friendly owner, Paola, who is from Italy and serves her grandmother’s homemade Italian recipes. We sat outside at one of the tables on the street. But they also have a cozy inside seating area.\n\nElita Restaurant\n\nElita is a cute and shabby-chic restaurant with seating on Middle Street. Owned by a Belgian-trained chef, this unpretentious restaurant has lively, warm interior decorations painted yellow. Here, you get fresh seafood, local curries, and a few pricier daily specials. Has a limited beer and wine selection as well.\n\nThe Old Dutch Hospital\n\nThe Old Dutch Hospital building has restaurants, cafes, bars, and shops. It is a great place to head for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as you have several restaurant options in the same building. Restaurants and cafes we love here are:\n\nA Minute by Tuk-Tuk – Has the best setting in Old Dutch Hospital, with terrace seatings and a nice view of Galle Harbor and Rumassala Peninsula. The menu ranges from Chinese chili pot & prawn curry to beef, tuna, and tandoori chicken burgers. It is a fun place with good value food.\n\nCannon Bar & Grill – Western-style restaurant with a sports bar feel to it. Serves Mexican and Indian dishes, as well as pizza and pasta. Has a slick modern interior and a balcony with a fantastic sea view.\n\nWhere To Shop In Galle Fort\n\nI love shopping, and Galle has surprisingly many lovely shops, perfect for buying gifts and souvenirs to bring back home. Most shops are open until 19:00/ 7 pm or 20:00/ 8 pm, and some are closed on Sundays.\n\nMy favorite shops in Galle Fort are:\n\nStick No Bills\n\nYou will see Stick No Bills in several places around Sri Lanka, but their original flagship store is in Galle Fort, which opened in 2011.\n\nThey sell cool, old travel posters from Sri Lankan airline companies and the Sri Lanka Tourism Board. We love them, especially their old map posters! They also sell the posters as postcards, perfect for posting a unique greeting to those at home.\n\nIf you buy a poster, they will wrap it in a hard-cover paper roll so you can easily transport it back home. Since Stick No Bills started in Sri Lanka, they have launched posters from all over the world. Check out Stick No Bill’s webpage to see their current poster designs.\n\nI first noticed Barefoot in Colombo and regretted not buying more at this shop. So I was super happy when I discovered they also have a shop in Galle Fort. Barefoot is a true and original Sri Lankan brand that has been going since 1964. They sell all kinds of cool stuff like books, bags, clothes, toys, homeware, cushions, art, and souvenirs.\n\nI love their fantastic weaving products, handmade by spin dye weavers in Sri Lanka. Their linen clothes and fabrics are also a favorite of mine. I filled my suitcase with their linen clothes before heading to the southern part of Sri Lanka. Their sarongs are fantastic, too! The Barefoot store in Galle Fort is set in a beautifully restored Dutch building. Here, you will also find Galle’s most extensive range of books about Sri Lanka.\n\nLanka Living Gallery\n\nWe accidentally stumbled upon this beautiful art gallery and were so glad we found it. It is a fantastic art/ photo gallery and shop owned and managed by the Danish photographer and artist Tomas Clausen. We had a long chat with Tomas; he is a wonderful and friendly man with a keen eye for photography.\n\nHe has photographed walls and surfaces around Sri Lanka with old paint, stickers, posters, and written text. The result is super cool and very unique. Love it!\n\nThe gallery is stunning, set in an old Dutch colonial building with an open courtyard. Visiting this gallery is a must when in Galle Fort!\n\nAnother excellent art gallery is Galle Fort Art Gallery (on 60 Leyn Baan Street).\n\nLuna Galle Fort\n\nHere, you find locally produced handmade souvenirs from Sri Lanka, like homeware, art, paintings, and jewelry.\n\nTallentire House\n\nThe American Lindsay Taylor first fell in love with Sri Lanka when she came on holiday with her family. They bought an old house, and while renovating, decorating, and redesigning it, she started this factory, producing the most fantastic selection of cotton fabrics and home textiles.\n\nThe products are unique, locally produced, and of good quality at affordable prices. Lindsay opened this shop, Tallentire House, in 2015. Here, you find two main collections: one bright and bold and one more muted when it comes to colors. You can buy cotton fabrics in meters or made into cushions, loungewear and pajamas, handbags, and other homewares. Everything they sell is handmade by local female tailors working from home in Sri Lanka.\n\nOrchid House\n\nA souvenir shop that is well-stocked with jewelry, arts, and crafts from Sri Lanka. You will also find a good selection of tea and books about Sri Lanka.\n\nLaksala\n\nThis is Sri Lanka’s state souvenir shop, selling all kinds of knick-knacks. The local Galle branch is about 500 m outside the old town Galle Fort. I find this a bit too touristy, but that might be my taste. 🙂 You can check out Laksala’s webpage and see if this is a shop you want to explore.\n\nSpa Ceylon Heritage Spa & Boutique\n\nA colorful shop selling all kinds of spas, and body products like soaps, body lotion, perfume, massage oil, candles, etc. It’s the best-smelling shop in Galle, for sure! 🙂\n\nKarma Collection\n\nA beautiful boutique selling fantastic clothes of good quality with fun patterns. I love their colorful dresses, kimonos, and pajamas. They also sell kids’s clothes, bags, and accessories.\n\nJewelry Shops and Gems\n\nGalle Fort is famous for its gems and jewelry shops.

At this traditional jewelry-making workshop in Galle, you will make your own jewelry using gemstones and silver. A fun experience and a chance to make a unique and fantastic souvenir to bring back home as a gift or for yourself.\n\nClick here for info and the latest prices on the Jewelry Workshop in Galle\n\nGrocery and Liquor\n\nThere is a small Cargills Express grocery shop on Church Street and two standard Cargills Food City shops on Wakwella Road (the south end, opposite the traffic circle) and Gamini Mawatha.

Then, you fully get to experience Galle’s charm and history. When the sightseeing buses leave in the afternoon, you can walk the streets of Galle in peace and quiet, enjoy the sunset, shop, and have a delicious dinner at one of the many restaurants. It is the perfect way to beat the crowds.\n\nMany of the old colonial buildings have been renovated into beautiful boutique hotels. The hotels below are all located within the old town of Galle Fort:\n\nGalle Fort Hotel\n\nWe stayed here in February 2017, and it is one of the most unique hotel stays we have ever had! From the moment we entered the hotel lobby, we felt very welcomed! The manager showed us around the hotel and told us the remarkable history of what the building used to be during the Dutch period and how they turned it into the beautiful boutique hotel it is today, which opened in 2015.\n\nThis is one of Galle’s grandest old colonial hotels, with 11 uniquely decorated rooms, each with a unique name reflecting Galle’s history.\n\nThe hotel perfectly blends modern luxury and traditional Sri Lankan ambiance. Originally a part of the old Fort itself, this beautifully restored colonial-style mansion’s architecture adds much character to this high-end boutique hotel.\n\nWe got the Admiral Cheng Ho Suite, and it was so beautiful! We slept like babies in the stunning, old, antique Chinese opium four-poster bed.\n\nThe room’s name honors Admiral Cheng Ho, the commander of China’s seven voyages “Treasure Fleet.” He was a powerful seven-foot-tall (213 cm) eunuch who visited Galle in 1406. We loved the room’s interior style, with its 20-foot tall (610 cm) ceiling, and the room even had a loft.\n\nThe rooms are large and kept in the classic style while still providing all modern comforts. We particularly loved the swimming pool in the lovely garden surrounding the hotel. It is one of the few hotels inside the Galle Fort with a pool, as the space is limited in this old part of town.\n\nWe had breakfast on the hotel’s patio, one of the best breakfasts we have ever had in Sri Lanka. Located centrally in Galle Fort, it’s an ideal base to explore the area. You will not regret booking a room here!\n\nClick here for latest prices on Galle Fort Hotel\n\nThe Mer.Chant Hotel\n\nWe stayed at this beautiful 5-star hotel in 2022, only one year after it opened. We loved this hotel so much that we just never wanted to leave. Everything was perfect, from the hospitality of the friendly staff, the beautiful interior design and layout, cleanliness, and food.\n\nWe stayed in a Superior Deluxe King Bed Room (room 205) on the second floor. We loved how fresh and airy the tall ceiling and stunning rattan furniture made the room feel cozy. The beds were some of the most comfortable we have slept in in Sri Lanka. Our room had a gigantic TV with international cable channels and a balcony perfect for having a cuppa or drink after sightseeing around Galle. Espen particularly loved the rainwater shower in the bathroom.\n\nWe were served a delicious breakfast in the restaurant downstairs in the morning. We also had dinner there, Chicken Biriyani and Satay, which was heavenly good. We loved the laidback and cozy vibe in the restaurant and bar. We were also impressed by the hotel’s fast and reliable internet (uncommon in Sri Lanka).\n\nThe Merchant Hotel has a central location on Pedlar Street, right in the middle of Galle Fort. You can easily walk to all the attractions, cafes, and restaurants in town, yet it is quiet and peaceful. To sum it up; The Merchant is a beautiful and stylish hotel with fantastic staff and a perfect location. We will definitely stay here again.\n\nClick here for the latest prices on The Merchant Hotel\n\nYara Galle Fort\n\nWe stayed three nights at this beautiful boutique hotel, and we really felt at home. The staff is the sweetest, and we felt like we were staying at someone’s home.\n\nThe hotel is located in a quiet part of the old part of Galle Fort, with a short walk to the restaurants and shops. Our room (room 103) was spacious, airy, and clean, with a cozy interior design and a beautiful bathroom.\n\nWe loved the nice garden with seating groups right outside our room. The hotel is just a few steps from the clock tower, where this DIY walking tour starts and ends, and a short walk from the best sunset spot.\n\nClick here for latest prices on Yara Galle Fort\n\nHow To Get To Galle Fort\n\nPrivate Car, Taxi, and Tuk-Tuk\n\nGalle is located 115 km south of Colombo, along the southwest coast of Sri Lanka. You can easily get here by private car & driver/ taxi or tuk-tuk along the Southern Expressway (opened in 2012). You can get from Bandaranaike (Colombo) International Airport to Galle in about 2 hours (one way).\n\nBus\n\nAs for public transport, you can take the bus or train to get to Galle. Frequent intercity air-con buses run from Colombo (Makumbura) to Galle in about 2-3 hours. There are also many buses along the coastal route from Bentota, Hikkaduwa, and other places in this coastal area.\n\nFrom the southern areas, like Tangalle (via Mirissa), it takes about 2 hours to drive north-west to Galle.\n\nTrain\n\nExpress and commuter trains connect Colombo to Galle, taking about 3 hours. This train trip is stunning, running along the western coast with a fantastic sea view. You can easily book train tickets online here (12Go).\n\nWe took the commuter train from Colombo to Galle in the afternoon rush when most workers finished work. The train was packed, and I have never felt more cramped; I could not even feel the train floor for most of the train ride! It was crazy! 🙂 So try to avoid rush hour.\n\nGalle Fort is only a 10-minute walk from the railway and bus stations. Once you enter the fort walls, you can easily walk around the entire Galle Fort on foot.\n\nWe love Galle Fort and add it to our Sri Lanka itinerary whenever we visit this beautiful country. Galle is such a unique city with a great vibe! It is a fun city with many cozy cafes, small shops, and restaurants.\n\nPIN IT FOR LATER!\n\nHover over the picture below and press the green PIN IT button that pops up:"
