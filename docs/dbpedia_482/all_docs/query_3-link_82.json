        "text": "The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, the independent charity that promotes the enjoyment and understanding of Shakespeare’s life and works, has announced a major step forward in its development plans.\n\nIts change of use application to convert a former retail unit into a flagship Learning and Community Hub in Shakespeare’s hometown has been granted by Stratford-on-Avon District Council, which has also part funded the project alongside the Trust's own active fundraising. Now, the Trust can begin work on the redevelopment of the building which is planne to open in 2025.\n\n“As a charity that focuses on ensuring that everyone has a positive experience with Shakespeare, the new Learning and Community Hub will enable us to host tens of thousands of schools and learning visits from across the world on the street where Shakespeare was born,\" said Rachael North, director of museum and public programmes for the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. \"This is something that has not been possible since 2019 and we are excited by the opportunity this offers for children, young people and our communities within Stratford-upon-Avon.”\n\nThe new facility is being designed to accommodate and increase the number of formal and informal learning groups of all ages that the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust welcomes into Stratford town centre, as well as offering dedicated exhibition space for local community groups. The venue will also be made available for community groups to host events and meetings.\n\nRachael North added: “The venue will also have the celebration of local communities and talent at its heart. Local artists and creatives will be able to come together and share their work with the public in a dedicated exhibition space. We will also be making the venue available to local community groups throughout the year, helping to foster relationships and provide much-needed spaces for creativity and community engagement in Stratford.”\n\nThe Learning and Community Hub is a key element of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust reframing its work as a major museum of Shakespeare for Stratford-upon-Avon and the world. This project sits alongside the planned new accessible collections store, and the beginning of a Trust-wide masterplanning programme which includes exploring the potential for a World Shakespeare Museum in Stratford-upon-Avon."
