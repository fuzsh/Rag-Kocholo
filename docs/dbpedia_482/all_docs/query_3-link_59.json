Poor health during her childhood and a tragic bus accident at the age of 18 led Kahlo to experience severe and life-long physical and emotional pain, recurrently depicted in her art. Famous for her self-portraits, such as “Henry Ford Hospital,” created in 1932, where she depicts her second miscarriage, and “The Two Fridas,” painted after her divorce in 1939, Kahlo did not hold back from painting the reality of her suffering with full-body casts, blood, nakedness, etc.\n\nKahlo’s marriage to famous Mexican painter Diego Rivera was as unusual as it was tumultuous and liberated for the times — they lived and worked apart; infidelity was commonplace; they separated several times; and the couple divorced (1939) and remarried (1940).\n\nKahlo’s eccentric style, now often imitated, was a celebration of her Mexican identity, as well as a reflection of the tragedies she endured. She wore traditional colorful and embroidered blouses, shawls, and skirts, as well as large pieces of jewelry. It is often said that Kahlo’s long skirts were a way for her to hide the consequences of the polio she contracted at age six — the disease affected the shape of her legs and her gait.\n\nPraised by some of the world’s most recognized artists such as Picasso, Chagall, and more, Kahlo had a successful career during which she exhibited her unique work in the US and Mexico and received commissions from the Mexican government, among others. Today, on the international stage, her work is arguably better known than that of her husband’s.\n\nKahlo passed away from illness as an acclaimed artist at the age of 47.\n\nWhere is the Frida Kahlo Museum?\n\nLa Casa Azul is located in the neighborhood of Coyoacán in Mexico City. Coyoacán is a charming and historic area of the city known for its beautiful colonial architecture, colorful streets, and lively cultural scene.\n\nLa Casa Azul is less than 10 minutes away on foot from another famous house museum: Leon Trotsky’s House Museum.\n\nThe exact address of the museum is: Londres 247, Del Carmen, Coyoacán, 04100 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico\n\nHow do I get to the Frida Kahlo Museum in Mexico City?\n\nHop into the line three train of the STC metro and stop at the Coyoacán station, the closest metro station to La Casa Azul. From there it’s a 20-minute walk to the museum. The Line three of the STC metro is colored light green on the Mexico City metro map.\n\nThe Turibus, Mexico City’s version of the Hop On Hop Off bus, has a Coyoacán circuit that stops at the museum.\n\nHow much does the Frida Kahlo Museum cost?\n\nGeneral admission for foreign nationals is $14.30 (250 MXN) from Monday to Friday, and $15.45 (270 MXN) on weekends. Discounts are available for students, seniors, and children. People with disabilities and children aged six or under enter for free.\n\nThose who want to take no-flash photographs inside the museum must purchase a permit for $1.70 (30 MXN).\n\nNote that you can only purchase timed-entry tickets and that they are only sold online. You cannot purchase your admission at the door. Timed-entry tickets sell out very fast so book it well in advance.\n\nYour ticket to the Frida Kahlo Museum also gives you access to the Diego Rivera-Anahuacalli Museum located three miles away. If you don’t want to walk for one hour to get from one museum to the next, take the Fridabus from La Casa Azul for just $9.15 (160 MXN) for adults and $4.60 (80 MXN) for children under the age of eight. Fridabus tickets are only available for purchase at La Casa Azul.\n\nHow long does it take to visit the Frida Kahlo Museum?\n\nPlan to stay two hours at the Frida Kahlo Museum to take the time to look at all the objects and pieces on display. Make sure you arrive 15 to 20 minutes before the time displayed on your timed-entry ticket.\n\nWhy is the Frida Kahlo Museum famous?\n\nFrida Kahlo is Mexico’s most famed artist, therefore La Casa Azul, the museum dedicated to her life and work, appeals to many, whether they are die-hard fans of Kahlo’s or interested in learning more about Mexico’s cultural heritage.\n\nThe fact that the Frida Kahlo Museum is the home where the artist was born, grew up, created, and died, adds to visitors’ interest. The collection contains much more than just paintings by Kahlo and Rivera: Many beautiful and personal objects, from books to jewelry, clothing, photographs, etc., are displayed.\n\nAside from the Frida Kahlo Museum, where can I see Frida Kahlo’s paintings in Mexico City?\n\nLa Casa Azul is not the only place in Mexico City where you can admire paintings by Frida Kahlo. The following cultural institutions are must-visits for fans of Kahlo’s work:\n\nMuseo Dolores Olmedo, where you’ll see the largest collection of work by Kahlo and Rivera, such as “The Broken Column” and “Self Portrait with Small Monkey.” At the time of writing the museum is in the process of moving to the Parque Urbano Aztlán and will open to the public in 2024.\n\nMuseo de Arte Moderno, where you can see “The Two Fridas” (1939), “The Coconuts” (1951), and “Still Life with Watermelons” (1953).\n\nHotels near the Frida Kahlo Museum in Mexico City\n\nIf you’d rather stay in a rental than a hotel while in CDMX, check out Matador’s selection of beautiful Airbnbs in Mexico City’s trendiest neighborhoods.\n\nWe hope you love the spaces and stays we recommend!
