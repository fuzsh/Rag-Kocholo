Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is no risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of vaccination is required if you are coming from or have transited through an airport of a countrywhere yellow fever occurs.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is not recommended.\n\nDiscuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.\n\nContact a designated Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nJapanese encephalitis\n\nJapanese encephalitis is a viral infection that can cause swelling of the brain. It is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Risk is very low for most travellers. Travellers at relatively higher risk may want to consider vaccination for JE prior to travelling.\n\nTravellers are at higher risk if they will be:\n\ntravelling long term (e.g. more than 30 days)\n\nmaking multiple trips to endemic areas\n\nstaying for extended periods in rural areas\n\nvisiting an area suffering a JE outbreak\n\nengaging in activities involving high contact with mosquitos (e.g., entomologists)\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Travellers going to countries in South Asia should speak to a health care professional about getting vaccinated.\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated.\n\nAvoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs.\n\nTravellers' diarrhea\n\nTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nRisk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nThe most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.\n\nTravellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nChikungunya\n\nThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:\n\nseason\n\nyear\n\nregion\n\nelevation\n\nThe virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.\n\nLearn more:\n\nInsect bite and pest prevention\n\nChikungunya\n\nZika virus\n\nZika virus is a risk in this country.\n\nZika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito.

It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites.\n\nDengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal.\n\nThe level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region.\n\nMosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue.\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nPerson-to-person infections\n\nStay home if you’re sick and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette, which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the flu and other illnesses by:\n\nwashing your hands often\n\navoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at large-scale events (concerts, sporting events, rallies)\n\navoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your local public health authority pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine.\n\nTuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.\n\nFor most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.\n\nTravellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.\n\nHigh-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.\n\nMedical services and facilities\n\nMedical services and facilities do not meet the standards you might normally expect in Canada.\n\nMedical facilities in certain areas outside of Colombo are limited, particularly in the north. In the event of a major accident or illness, medical evacuation is often necessary. Medical transport is very expensive.\n\nMedical facilities may require confirmation of insurance coverage, guarantee of payment or an up-front deposit before admitting patients.\n\nMake sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.\n\nHealth and safety outside Canada\n\nKeep in Mind...\n\nThe decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.\n\nBe prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a travel health kit, especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.\n\nLaws and culture\n\nYou must abide by local laws.\n\nLearn about what you should do and how we can help if you are arrested or detained abroad.\n\nDrugs\n\nPenalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict.\n\nAlcohol\n\nAlcohol consumption in public places is prohibited.\n\nDrugs, alcohol and travel\n\nSmoking\n\nSmoking is prohibited in many indoor public places, workplaces and on public transport.
