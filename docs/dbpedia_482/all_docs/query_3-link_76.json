        "text": "Architektura\n\n'Ambalama' - Adaptive Reuse of Colombo Dutch Museum\n\nMadhusanka Moragoda\n\nSrí Lanka\n\nIdea projektu\n\nThe Colombo Dutch Museum is one of the most historically significant buildings in the Colombo. However, due to it being located in one of the busiest commercial centers, the museum is often overlooked. This project focuses on the adaptive reuse of the Colombo Dutch Museum\n\nConcept\n\nwusn,u (ambalama) is a tradition element in ancient sir lanka. It is a place where ancient people take a rest. While ancient people were going on journeys, when they felt tired or when it got dark night, they stayed at wusn,u (ambalama) and took a rest. The best place , the reference can be taken about wusn,u(ambalama) in a සැලලිහිණි සංදේශය (history reference)and a ගිරා සංදේශය. (history reference)\n\nAccording to සැලලිහිණි සංදේශය, (history reference)\n\nThe wusn,u (ambalama) was located near the pond and near the jungle. It says the ancient wusn,u (ambalama) were located near the water source in order to people needed to wash their faces and they wanted to take water to cook their food\n\nAccording to ගිරා සංදේශය, (history reference)\n\nthis wusn,u (ambalama) was in a beautiful area. There is a beautiful environment surround the wusn,u (ambalama) and the wusn,u (ambalama) were not coved by walls.so there were interconnection between in side of wusn,u (ambalama) and outdoor environment.so ancient people could experience the beautiful of environment from inside the wusn,u (ambalama).some time the ray of sun light came through the trees’ leafs upon wusn,u (ambalama) .\n\nas well wusn,u (ambalama) was place where people could exchange their ideas. Specially some time, people who came from different area , met at wusn,u (ambalama) and it was wonderful opportunity to exchanged their ideas.in this situation lot of expression came to their faces such as happy ,angry, sad ,frighten ,wondering and many expressions. The ගිරා සංදේශය (ambalama) says many thing about that.\n\nAccording to The ගිරා සංදේශය, (ambalama) some people talked about some kings work angry and some time happily, talked about tasty of food pleasantly, talked about joke with smiling, talked some horrible thing with sad and etc.so this was a place people exchanged their ideas and people exchange their expression.\n\nWhen talk about the inspiration?\n\nThe Architectural language of the Dutch museum is based on essence of Old Dutch tradition and culture. The Coolum, walls, type of windows, timber staircase and form of the building represent essence of Dutch. But the reason of lack of attraction, the new building which is built beside the old Dutch museum, should be contrasted from essence of old Dutch building. specially outlook of the new building as well as form of the new building should be contrasted from essence of old Dutch building outlook as well as form of the Dutch building.\n\nThe form of the Old Dutch museum is box shape building and the building which is in around the Dutch museum are box shape buildings.so those building are geometrical shape buildings and the new building which is built beside the Old Dutch museum, should have essence of geometrical form. Then the new building responds to the context very well. According to this foundation the new building which is built, should be geometrical shape building.\n\nThen the form of this modern building is inspired by pyramid shape. Then it has essence of the old Dutch museum building from and surrounding buildings forms. Then new building must definitely respond to the context and attracts people to the old Dutch building.\n\nAs well Outlook of the new building should be inspired by modern buildings ,for Dutch museum has old Dutch essence .then so old Dutch building out look should be contrasted in order to increase the factor which is about attracting people to Dutch museum. So people can see modern look pyramid shaped and the curiosity which is about” what is this? What activates are happened in side it?” is born inside them and they they are attracted to the Dutch museum by modern pyramid shape building\n\nPopis projektu\n\nThe project which was given, is a convert the old Dutch museum building in Colombo into other activate space which is proposed. This two story colonnade building on prince street,petta.this building was built during the Dutch period (1656-1796) and time by time this building has been used as a teacher training college and an institute for the instruction of clergymen and then police station and then a military hospital.\n\nMain object of the given project is attracting people to Dutch museum and make it as a high income generated museum building. In this project, people are attracted to Dutch museum by The pyramid shape building which is built next to the Dutch museum. it is a resting area for people who come for fort station. Because This fort station has no proper resting areas for the people who come from far distances.in this case those people who have to wait several hours for their train, sleep on the benches and they put their luggage on the benchers. In this situation, this actions disturbs other people who wait for shot time for their bus and traines.so form this convert ,the disbarring other people at fort station is decreed and this solution makes both people who wait long time and short time for their bus or train, comfortable.
