        "text": "The Museum of Cultures is developing a provenance research project. In the process of analysing and studying the collections, the museum’s curatorial department analyses the way in which each object was collected and acquired, and reconstructs the contexts underlying changes in ownership and possession.\n\nAmong the activities dedicated to provenance, the Guillermo Schmidt Pizarro project, in which Mudec participates along with other international institutions, is of particular importance.\n\nSchmidt Pizarro was a famous collector of Peruvian origin, active in Europe and the United States since the beginning of the 20th century. He sold numerous pre-Hispanic and colonial Peruvian artefacts to the most important museums of his time, sometimes breaking up homogeneous lots. Mudec owns 91 objects acquired by Schmidt Pizarro in the 1930s.\n\nThe importance of this research is in line with our museum’s efforts to trace the origin of each artefact in our collections in the name of transparency, in order to restore dignity and context to objects that are valuable for reconstructing the material culture of South American native peoples.\n\nProject Coordinators:\n\nCarolina Orsini, Anna Antonini and Federica Villa\n\nInformation and applications for possible collaboration: c.bibliocultureansando@comune.milano.it\n\nScientific publications\n\nLife of a Peruvian Art Collector: Guillermo Schmidt Pizarro\n\nMuseums on the art market\n\nThe “Antonio Raimondi” Archaeological Mission, under the auspices and with the contribution of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, aims to carry out a diachronic research of the relationship between man and environment in the Andes, based on Raimondi’s research.\n\nThe naturalist, born in Milan, moved to Peru in 1850, from where he sent some of the finds to the Milan Museum of Natural History, contributing to the formation of the ethnographic collections conserved at MUDEC.\n\nThe research began in 1999 and, over time, has covered various geographical areas: the Chacas area (Province of Asunción, Ancash, Peru); the Province of Huari (Peru); the Puruhay Lagoon (Peru, 2006-2012 campaigns); the Brealito/Luracatao area (Province of Salta, Argentina, 2011-2012 campaigns); the Tacuil area and the valley of La Hoyada (2013-2019 campaigns) with the branch of the Qhapaq Ñan, the great Inca road that connected a large part of South American territory before the conquest.\n\nSince 2020, the research team has returned to Peru, once again in the foothills of the Cordillera Blanca, in the Central Andes. Here, excavations began at the large site of Tumshukayko, occupied since 3000 B.C.\n\nThe project was supported locally by several indigenous institutions, such as the Unión de los Pueblos de la Nación Diaguita-Salta in Argentina, the Alcaldes of Puruhuay and of Ñawpamarca in Peru. Currently it enjoys the support of the Asociación de los Vecinos of Tumshukayko and the Asociación Caraz Cultura. At an institutional level, partnerships have been established with the Municipality of Hari and, most recently, with the Municipality of Caraz.\n\nInternational sponsorship was provided by the following institutions: the Italian Embassy in Lima and Buenos Aires, the Italian Institute of Culture in Lima, the Peruvian Ministry of Culture and the Museum of Anthropology in Salta.\n\nSeveral universities are contributing to the research, including the Free University of Languages and Communication IULM in Milan, the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, the Italian National Research Council (CNR), the Belgian Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS) and the University of Buenos Aires (UBA). Furthermore, several students and scholars from different Italian and Latin American universities have been taking part in the project over the years\n\nProject Coordinator: Carolina Orsini\n\nVisit the mission blog in Spanish\n\nVisit the mission page on the “Italian” website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nThe Map of Colonial Odonymy is the result of historical-archival research commissioned by the Area Museo delle Culture, Progetti interculturali e Arte nello Spazio Pubblico and carried out by the Ferruccio Parri National Institute.\n\nThe historians who carried out the research identified around one hundred and fifty streets and squares in Milan’s toponymy named after soldiers, explorers, battles, cities and other places or people linked to Italian colonial history. Thanks to the study of the municipal naming regulations kept in the archives, it has been possible to trace the years and motivations. The list also includes those cultural institutions and monuments that played a central role in the debate on Italian colonialism.\n\nThe map is therefore a useful tool for raising awareness of Italian colonial history and its impact on the urban fabric. Mudec has placed this work in a wider panorama of reflection on colonial memories, starting from the dialogue with some personalities of the Habesha community in Milan and from the confrontation, which it wishes to be constant and permanent, with citizens of diasporic and non-diasporic origin on the themes of colonialism.\n\nLink to the map\n\nPress Release\n\nVideo of the presentation day"
