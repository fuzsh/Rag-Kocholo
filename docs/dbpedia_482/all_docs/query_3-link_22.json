        "text": "The Sri Lanka Mangrove Conservation Project was the largest and most far-reaching initiative in Seacology’s history. The project protected all 21,782 acres (8,815 hectares) of Sri Lanka’s existing mangrove forests by providing alternative job training and microloans to approximately 12,000 impoverished women who live in 1,500 small communities adjacent to the nation’s mangrove forests. The project also replanted 9,600 acres (3,885 hectares) of mangrove forests that have been cut down, using seedlings raised in three Seacology-funded mangrove nurseries.\n\nIn exchange for receiving microloans to start small businesses, all 1,500 communities were be responsible for protecting an average of 21 acres of mangrove forest. A first-of-its kind mangrove museum to educate the public about the importance of preserving this resource and a large training and community center in the country’s formerly war-torn north was also built.\n\nSeacology harnessed local NGO Sudeesa’s experience in implementing job-training and microfinance programs, fields in which Sudeesa has been a leader for more than 15 years. This partnership offered many more impoverished Sri Lankans alternative ways to earn a living that do not entail cutting down mangroves.\n\nThe project was launched with a budget of US$3.4 million over five years. Thanks in part to a generous match by Board of Directors member Peter Read, we reached that original fundraising goal. A grant from the Global Resilience Partnership allowed us to expand the scope of our work in Sri Lanka and raise the budget to over $4 million.\n\nThavanesan Rageshwary comes from a a family of three in Vidathaltheevu in Mannar district. Rageshwary had been running a small retail shop before joining the Seacology-Sudeesa Sri Lanka Mangrove Conservation Program. After attending a three-day training, she obtained a Rs10,000 microloan and was able to expand her business, adding food items. She now earns an additional income of about Rs5000.00 per month and intends to develop her business further using the management skills gained by the program.\n\nP.Consee, lives in Karambe, Kalpitiya, Puttalam district in a family of four. Consee and her husband, a cook, have two children and their income was not enough for day-to-day living. She has tried to secure alternative income opportunities and initiated a tailoring business, which increased the family’s income. Meanwhile, she became a member of a CBO established under the Seacology-Sudeesa Sri Lanka Mangrove Conservation Project. Through the CBO, she has been able to acquire knowledge and experience. With this additional knowledge, she has been able to improve her business and has gained a greater appreciation for environmental conservation. Where before she only offered her tailoring services on-demand for the surrounding community, she is now planning to purchase cut-pieces and produce ready-made cloths based on her own design. She intends to apply for a Rs10,000 loan from the project for this purpose.\n\nIvon Sama Perera lives in Vannimundalama, Puttalam district in a family of three. Sama was born in a fishing family in Bathalangunduwa, an area affected by the war, and fled to Wannimundalama with her husband. After relocating they had to undergo many hardships due to loss of their previously satisfactory income and fishing equipment. Her husband had also fallen sick and was unable to work. Sama has taken responsibility to support her family through several activities. She fishes, prepares and sells short eats (snacks) and breakfasts, and processes dry fish and Kajan leaves of coconut trees, used by people for shelter and many other activities. After receiving training under the Seacology-Sudeesa Mangove Conservation ProgramS, she started production of snack foods with a Rs10,000 microloan. She has registered this business and is happy with the additional income. “What is more important to me from the training provided is the knowledge that I acquired on business management, and inculcating a culture for saving money for the future,” she says.\n\nNerina sujeewani Kurakkanhena, lives in Kalpitiya in Puttalum district in a family of five. Nerina, being the elder daughter of the family, left school after fifth grade to support her family. After joining as a community member of the program, she participated in the seven-day youth training program conducted by Sudeesa. She has opened a retail shop with a Rs 10,000 microloan obtained from the microfinance component of the program and now earns revenue of about Rs1500 per day with a daily profit of about Rs150. She is planning to get a second loan after repayment of the first to improve her business further.\n\nSumeda Malani lives in Kurakkanhena, Kalpitiya, Puttalum district in a family of five. Sumeda produces sweets. In this photo, she is making a confection produced using coconut milk blended with sugar or honey. Processing needs high temperature and continuous stirring until the entire mix gets hard. Sumeda started this business with a Rs10,000 loan from the microfinance component of the Seacology-Sudeesa Sri Lanka Mangrove Conservation Program to increase her family income in addition to her husband’s efforts. She used the funding to purchase equipment necessary for sweets production. She is planning to construct a hut and continue her business more systematically, after which she will be able to register the company.\n\nSri Lankan women participate in a three-day training session for community members at Iranawila village, in Puttalum District. Under the Seacology-Sudeesa Sri Lanka Mangrove Conservation Project, 7,500 women will participate in three-day training sessions and 7,500 youth will attend seven-day sessions. 1,500 Community-Based Organizations around 48 lagoons in 14 coastal districts of the country will be offered these services. For the women, a consolidated, focused training is conducted over three days as many of the women cannot afford to be away from their residences for a longer period. Topics covered include mangrove conservation, business management, and livelihood development. Each CBO agrees to support conservation of 8.5 ha (21 acres) of mangrove area replant 2.5 ha (6 acres)."
