        "text": "Sri Lankan cricketer\n\nL. D. S. \"Chippy\" Gunasekara (1905 â€“ 8 January 1974) was a cricketer and lawyer who played first-class cricket for Ceylon from 1929 to 1935.\n\nAlthough he was only five feet three inches tall and played in spectacles, \"Chippy\" Gunasekera was a good left-handed opening batsman with a strong defence, and a fine cover fieldsman.[1] He toured India in 1932-33, top-scoring in Ceylon's first-ever first-class victory, in the match against Patiala, when he made 57 in the first innings, the only fifty on either side.[2][3] He captained Ceylon in the match against the Australians in 1935-36, top-scoring in Ceylon's second innings.[4] In club cricket in Colombo he formed an outstanding opening partnership with Mohotti Albert, and later in his career he became one of Ceylon's best leg-spin bowlers.[1]"
