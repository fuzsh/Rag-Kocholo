        "text": "In June 1963, President John F. Kennedy made a visit that would change America and the rest of the world’s perception of Ireland. Kennedy referred to his visit to Ireland as “the best four days of his life.” One of those days, June 29th, was spent in Galway, known for its long winding promenade, beautiful beaches, and traditional Gaeltacht culture of music, dancing, and the Irish language.\n\nTold by residents present during the presidential visit, JFK: The Three Miles recalls the euphoric excitement in Galway. None had ever experienced such privilege or felt such an atmosphere. They certainly never met someone as famous as the President of the United States.\n\nBorn two weeks after his father was elected President of the United States, John F. Kennedy Jr. grew up in the spotlight. At Hyannis Port on Cape Cod, at the White House during his father’s presidency and years later in Manhattan, JFK Jr. captivated the world.\n\nJohn, his wife and her sister all died in a plane crash off Cape Cod on July 16, 1999. As his beloved uncle Ted Kennedy said at his funeral “From the first day of his life, John seemed to belong not only to our family, but to the American Family.”\n\nJohn also belonged to the Cape Cod family. It was here that he enchanted us as a little boy and later beguiled us as an adult visiting the family home in Hannis Port. He felt comfortable walking down Main Street, Hyannis and sometimes visited here at the John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum.\n\nSet in thematic arrangements, “We Remember JFK Jr.” features extraordinary images (some seldom seen) of John Jr. alone, or with his father, mother, sister and wife. Through video, photographs, quotes, text and artifacts, this commemorative exhibit invites visitors to remember John F. Kennedy Jr. who, like his father, had every gift but length of years.\n\nRuns through December 2024.\n\nThe summers were magical. On Friday evenings, President Kennedy would arrive by helicopter on the lawn of the sprawling Kennedy home in Hyannis Port. He would be lovingly greeted by his children and a flock of nieces and nephews ready to hop on the golf cart and head to the candy store. For JFK weekends on Cape Cod meant renewal, inspiration and fun family times. The President was a golfer and a racing sailor and enjoyed winning at both!\n\nSee archival video, special family images, fascinating artifacts and more at this new long-term exhibit.\n\nExhibit Highlights:\n\n• The Heart & Home: Kennedy Compound\n\n• To Wake as President\n\n• Summers were Magical\n\n• JFK’s Presidency and World Events Timeline\n\n• Sailing the Victura\n\n• Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!\n\n• Happy Birthday, Grandpa\n\nSpecial exhibit commemorates Robert F. Kennedy\n\nThe John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum special exhibit to commemorate the life and legacy of Robert F. Kennedy continues through 2023. The “RFK: Ripple of Hope” exhibit, was assembled in collaboration with RFK Human Rights Foundation .\n\n“The theme ‘Ripple of Hope’ comes from his most famous and powerful speech delivered in Cape Town, South Africa,” said the exhibit curator Rebecca Pierce-Merrick. “It’s a fitting title for our exhibit as well because that’s exactly what his life of public service created – a ripple of hope that continues to reverberate through the generations since his passing.”\n\nThis exhibit begins with Robert Kennedy’s early years within the Kennedy family, including rarely seen images of his time on Cape Cod. The focal point of the exhibit however, covers his time serving as the U.S. Attorney General, his election to the U.S. Senate, and culminating with his inspirational presidential campaign, which began on March 16, 1968 and ended with his death on June 6, 1968.\n\nOne particularly poignant part of the exhibit highlights an impromptu speech he gave before a large group of distraught onlookers the night Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in April 1968 just weeks after Kennedy announced his bid for the presidency.\n\nThe exhibit includes 45 images and excerpts from Robert Kennedy’s speeches that convey the boundless energy he showed on the campaign trail, often with Ethel and his children at his side. “Ripple of Hope” also has a very moving eight-minute video narrated by Kathleen Kennedy and Joseph P. Kennedy III.\n\nOn loan from Waldorf Astoria New York\n\nThe JFK Hyannis Museum is honored to be the temporary home of President Kennedy’s rocking chair during the renovation of The Towers of the Waldorf Astoria. In 1962 President Kennedy gave one of his iconic Kennedy Rockers to the Waldorf Astoria to find its pride of place in the presidential suite.\n\nWaldorf Astoria New York, which recently celebrated its 90th anniversary on Park Avenue, is undergoing an extensive restoration that will also deliver a collection of contemporary residences above the legendary hotel known as The Towers of the Waldorf Astoria. When the hotel reopens, the rocking chair will return as a permanent exhibit in a gallery celebrating the hotel’s rich history.\n\nWe know that our visitors from all corners of the world, as well as our local community, will find the Kennedy rocker to be an exciting and fascinating addition to our museum.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy’s words inspired not only his generation but continue to inspire generations of people around the globe. How did he become a man so committed to public service? How does his legacy live on? What role did Cape Cod play in shaping his personality? Our exhibition, JFK at 100: Life & Legacy, strives to answer those questions.\n\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917. Although he lived only 46 of the past 106 years, he continues to be quoted constantly by world leaders. Thousands of public facilities have been named in his honor. His visions for space travel, civil rights, and nuclear non-proliferation remain a guiding force for how we approach these contemporary topics. JFK at 100: Life & Legacy considers how President Kennedy influenced the full hundred years after his birth.\n\nWe begin by telling John F. Kennedy’s story from childhood through election day, when he was known to family and friends as Jack. We tell our story through a carefully curated collection of photographs, many rarely seen: candids taken by friends and family; studio, magazine and newspaper photos; stills from television and video. Many of the images include Jack and his friends and family enjoying themselves at the Cape, their refuge from their busy schedules and the place Jack always considered home.\n\nWe’ll continue the journey through President Kennedy’s White House years, including fascinating artifacts from Inauguration Day. Other photos will give important glimpses into President Kennedy’s life in Hyannis Port, which became known as the Summer White House.\n\nThe exhibit features the careers of his brothers Bobby and Ted and his lasting influence on space travel, the Peace Corps, advocacy for children with intellectual disabilities, and of course the creation of the Cape Cod National Seashore. Our goal is for visitors to leave with a better sense of Jack Kennedy, the private person, and President John F. Kennedy, influential world leader, and to understand the deep and lasting influence of Cape Cod on the man and his ideas."
