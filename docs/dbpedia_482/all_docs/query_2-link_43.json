        "text": "Coloboma is an eye condition that people are born with. It happens when part of the tissue that makes up the eye is missing. It can affect 1 or both eyes.\n\nIf your child has coloboma, talk to your doctor about the best plan for their care. There are treatments that can help them make the most of their vision.\n\nDifferent types of coloboma can affect different parts of the eye, including the:\n\nIris (colored part of the eye)\n\nUvea (layer of the eye that contains the iris)\n\nLens (clear inner part of the eye that helps the eye focus)\n\nRetina (light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye)\n\nMacula (part of the retina needed for central vision)\n\nOptic nerve (nerve that connects the eye to the brain)\n\nColoboma can also affect the eyelids.\n\nSome people with coloboma have no symptoms. Others may have problems with their vision, including:\n\nVision loss or blindness\n\nLow vision\n\nSensitivity to light\n\nSome colobomas are visible. For example, iris coloboma can make the pupil (the round opening at the center of the iris) look more like a keyhole or teardrop.\n\nColoboma happens when a baby’s eye doesn’t develop normally during pregnancy because of abnormal or changed genes that affect eye development. Coloboma sometimes runs in families. Environmental factors, such as drinking alcohol during pregnancy, may also increase a baby’s risk for coloboma.\n\nColoboma often happens together with conditions that affect other parts of the body, like CHARGE syndrome and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.\n\nColoboma may be visible when your baby is born, so the doctor may be able to diagnose it by looking at their eyes during an exam. If your child’s coloboma isn’t visible, the doctor can diagnose it by doing a comprehensive dilated eye exam.\n\nChildren and adults may need treatment for other eye conditions related to coloboma, such as cataracts or glaucoma.\n\nIf your child has coloboma, it’s important to talk to their doctors about the best plan for their care. Children with coloboma often need specialized care and therapy to help them grow and develop."
