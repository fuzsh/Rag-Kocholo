        "text": "Summary of Kehinde Wiley\n\nKehinde Wiley is a young, African-American painter who is quite literally changing the face(s) of portraiture with his sensitive, vibrant, and political portrayals of black folk, ranging from teenagers he meets on the streets, to fellow contemporary artists, and even former President Barack Obama.\n\nWiley made a name for himself for his naturalistic, brightly colored portraits of young black men, often with dramatic flowery backgrounds. With black masculinity often framed as synonymous with fear and violence in the USA, his generous and vibrant portraits challenge viewers' preconceptions of their subjects and bring young men, and people, of color into the galleries and museums they are so woefully underrepresented in.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nWiley's work falls into the category of Identity Art and Identity Politics, which is art, film, and writing, that deals primarily with aspects of the artist's identity, for example race, gender, and sexuality. It is vitally important to Wiley that black people, especially black American men, are both the subjects and the audience of his paintings. At a time when young black men are constantly vilified in the press and mainstream media, and even murdered on the street by racist policemen, Wiley's portraits are an essential document of the power, fashion, versatility and beauty of the black community in the USA.\n\nWiley talks about portraiture and the \"field of power\", referring to the way that painted portraits of people indicates that they are powerful, but also that portraits hold the potential to give power to those who are painted in this way, turning traditional portrait painting upside down.\n\nIn 1975, Laura Mulvey put forward the idea of the \"male gaze\", that images of women are produced to be static objects for men to look at. bell hooks challenged Mulvey by pointing out that race was totally absent from Mulvey's argument and that black men are excluded (in that they are punished for looking at white women) as well as black women (in that they are never beautiful enough to be objects of desire). bell hooks put forward the idea of the \"oppositional gaze\" where black subjects interrupt white looks, and thus white power. Wiley's subjects often embody this oppositional gaze, and successfully challenge comfortable white modes of looking and being looked at, in a way that is unique and hugely important in decolonizing the Western art canon.\n\nWiley often appropriates, or re-uses, recognizable art historicaly images and tropes, such as portraits of Napoleon, heroic sea paintings, and traditional nudes. He does this as a way to critique art historical norms - the way we almost only see white people painted by other white people when we look at painting - and to use pre-existing tools to elevate black folk to the important positions inhabited by these white people of art history.\n\nAs a gay black man, it is important for Wiley to reposition black male bodies as objects of desire, eroticism, and vulnerability, as opposed to fear, strength and violence. Gay black men are often doubly victimised in society, and Wiley's purposeful queering of recognizable images; his use of flowers; and camp, playful portraits are all important contributions to what queer black art can look like in America, and the importance of blackness to queerness, and visa versa.\n\nThe Life of Kehinde Wiley\n\nImportant Art by Kehinde Wiley\n\nBiography of Kehinde Wiley\n\nChildhood\n\nKehinde Wiley was born and grew up in South-central Los Angeles with an African-American mother, Freddie Mae Wiley, and a Yoruba father from Nigeria, Isaiah D. Obot, who came to the United States as a scholarship student and then returned to Africa after finishing his studies to work as an architect, leaving Wiley's mother to raise their six children. When Wiley was a child, his mother recognized his artistic talent, saying that he could reproduce anything he saw by drawing, and she enrolled him and his twin brother in after-school art classes at the age of 11. Wiley says, \"She wanted us to stay away from gang culture; the sense that most of my peers would end up either dead or in prison was a very real thing. So we were on buses doing five-hour round trips every weekend to go study art. That was a huge pain in the ass. My brother ended up in love with medicine and literature and business - he's in real estate and finance now. But me, I really got the art bug.\"\n\nFor most of his childhood, he says that the family survived on welfare checks and whatever spare change was earned at his mother's thrift shop, which didn't have a sign or a retail space, only a patch of sidewalk in front of their house on West Jefferson Avenue. Everyone in the neighborhood referred to it as 'Freddie's Store', and Wiley says it contained all sorts of things, including used books, windup record players, tarnished gold-leaf picture frames, and porcelain figurines. He recalls that he and his siblings would help their mother look for new inventory, driving around in a noisy Dodge van that backfired constantly. He says, \"That was the more embarrassing part. You're 11, and you don't want to be seen jumping out to go through your neighbour's garbage. That's social death!\"\n\nAt the age of 12, in 1989, Wiley was one of 50 American children who went to live in Russia at the Centre for U.S./U.S.S.R. Initiatives where he studied art and the Russian language.\n\nHis experiences growing up as a young black man in the United States would strongly influence his artistic career. He says, \"I know how young black men are seen. They're boys, scared little boys oftentimes. I was one of them. I was completely afraid of the Los Angeles Police Department.\" He is also gay, saying, \"My sexuality is not black and white. I'm a gay man who has occasionally drifted. I am not bi. I've had perfectly pleasant romances with women, but they weren't sustainable. My passion wasn't there. I would always be looking at guys.\"\n\nEducation and Early Training\n\nWiley graduated from the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, where he had the opportunity to travel to several Los Angeles galleries. He was strongly influenced by seeing the works of Gainsborough and Constable. He earned his BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1999 and then received a scholarship to complete his MFA at Yale University School of Art in 2001. While at art school, he says that the most important lesson he learned was to create art that he wanted to make, not art that his professors wanted him to make.\n\nThe year that Wiley graduated from his MFA he came across a crumpled piece of paper in the streets of Harlem, which he picked up and found to be a mug shot. He started to think about the mug shot as portraiture, saying, \"What is portraiture? It's choice. It's the ability to position your body in the world for the world to celebrate you on your own terms.\" But in a mug shot you don't have a choice about how you're presented. He went on to experiment with creating paintings based on mug shots. This process also got him thinking about whether portraiture is ever able to communicate anything deeper than the physical traits of the sitter.\n\nShortly after graduating from his MFA, Wiley became an Artist in Residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem. He says, \"They gave me $500 a month. I would sleep in the grounds of the museum and make my paintings. That made me the artist I am today and I want to be able to pay that forward,\" which is why he has developed a studio in Senegal with own residency program.\n\nArt dealer and curator Jeffrey Deitch gave Wiley his first solo show in New York and then went on to represent him for the next ten years.\n\nMature Period and Current Work\n\nWiley began traveling to West Africa in 1997 to search for and reconnect with the father from whom he had been estranged for much of his early life. Although Wiley says that their initial meeting âwasnât the bestâ, he continued to return and develop a rapport with his father. In late 2019, Wileyâs father passed away. The artist recently stated âIâm glad I took that step to get to know him. It was about him certainly, but it was about much more than that; it was about the uncles and aunts and cousins and a sense of myself existing within time and within history.â\n\nWileyâs process begins as \"street casting,â wherein he searches inner city areas (typically in New York and Los Angeles, but also foreign cities like Mumbai, Senegal, Dakar, and Rio de Janeiro) for young men of color who have âa spirit of self-possession\". He says that this process is \"this serendipitous thing where I am in the streets running into people who resonate with me, whether for cultural or sexual reasons. My type is rooted in my own sexual desire.\"\n\nAfter exchanging glances with a potential candidate, Wiley approaches them and explains his art-making process, showing them some examples of his work. He says that most people turn him down, but interested parties are then invited to his studio where photographs are taken. Although he has his subjects adopt poses typical of Renaissance master paintings, he depicts them in their contemporary streetwear, thereby \"interrogating the notion of the master painter,\" as well as quoting âhistorical sources [while simultaneously] position[ing] young black men within that field of power\".\n\nVH1 commissioned Wiley to paint portraits of the honorees for the 2005 Hip Hop Honors program. In his typical style, he rendered the musicians according to historical portraits of great men, such as painting Ice T as Napoleon, and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five as a seventeenth-century Dutch civic guard company.\n\nIn October 2011, Wiley received the Artist of the Year Award from the New York City Art Teachers Association/United Federation of Teachers, and also received Canteen Magazine's Artist of the Year Award. Two of his paintings were featured on the top of 500 New York City taxicabs in 2011 as collaboration with the Art Production Fund.\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that Wiley was to be commissioned to produce a portrait of former U.S. President Barack Obama for the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, and the completed work was unveiled on February 12, 2018. Wiley and Amy Sherald, who painted former First Lady Michelle Obama, are the first black artists to paint official portraits of the president or First Lady for the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nIn the late 2010s, Wiley began working with sculpture, most notably creating a monumental bronze equestrian statue, with a horse mounted by a young black male with dreadlocks, ripped jeans, a high-top Nike sneakers, titled Rumors of War. The work was conceived as a response to now-controversial Confederate statues, such as that of Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart, which stood in Richmond, Virginia, which, after protests, was removed in July 2020. Wileyâs statue was unveiled in Times Square, New York, in September 2019.\n\nWiley has spent the last several years based at his studio in Brooklyn, and also maintains studios in China and Senegal, where teams of artists work on the ornate backgrounds of his paintings before Wiley takes over to complete the figures. When the Covid-19 virus began spreading around the world in early 2019, Wiley was working in Norway on an âepic painting and filmâ project that was to explore art historical traditions of European landscape and seascape painting.\n\nKnowing that international borders were soon to close due to COVID-19, Wiley decided to return to his luxurious complex and studio at Black Rock, Senegal to spend quarantine with other Black artists, including German-Ghanaian mixed-media artist Zohra Opoku, Nigerian writer Kelechi Njoku, and American painter Devin B. Johnson. Wiley says that âWe relied a lot on each other, socially, physically. We were on real lockdown [â¦] We were on campus, working, discussing things, critiquing each otherâs work.â Now, Wiley is building a second branch of his Black Rock studio in Nigeria, with plans to welcome more international Black artists there soon. He says itâs like âcreating the dream residency that Iâve never had.â\n\nThe Legacy of Kehinde Wiley\n\nWiley's portrait paintings have been pioneering in their use of historical Western art conventions (large scale canvases and heroic poses drawn from Old Master paintings) to portray men and women of color as powerful and worthy of appearing in galleries and museums.\n\nWiley is one of several contemporary black artists (like Mickalene Thomas, Xaviera Simmons, Yinka Shonibare, and Hank Willis Thomas) who are working to shift racial power imbalances reproduced by contemporary art and popular media. He says \"Art is about communicating power, and it's been that way for hundreds of years. Artists have been very good at working for the church and for the state, communicating the aspirations of society. What I choose to do is take people who happen to look like me, black and brown, people all over the world increasingly, and allowing them to occupy that field of power.\"\n\nMoreover, by shifting who is included as the subjects of heroic portraiture, Wiley's work has also resulted in a shift in who feels welcome within art institutions. He says, \"When I have exhibitions, the people who don't belong to the typical museum demographic show up. People view themselves within the rubric of possibility.\"\n\nInfluences and Connections\n\nUseful Resources on Kehinde Wiley"
