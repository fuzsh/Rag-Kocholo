Clicking ads or making purchases through affiliate links may, at no additional cost to you, earn me a small commission. I appreciate your support.\n\nThe Freddie Mercury Museum, dedicated to one of the world’s greatest performers, found in a small house in Zanzibar’s Stone Town. Who would have guessed?\n\nThe museum dedicated to the lead singer of the band Queen might at first seem out of place on this small island. Unless of course, you are a super fan. Or maybe just a curious traveler who decides to pay a visit looking to learn more about the legend that is Mr. Mercury.\n\nBut is this place A Kind Of Magic or will you Want to Break Free and do something else instead? Keep reading to find out more.\n\nWhere is Zanzibar?\n\nFirst things first, where on Earth is Zanzibar? The largest island in the Zanzibar archipelago is also known simply as Zanzibar by most. It lies off the coast of Tanzania, in East Africa.\n\nThe islands are popular with people looking to relax at the gated resorts complete with white sand beaches and crystal clear water. But there’s also a lot of history in Zanzibar, namely at the island’s old center, Stone Town.\n\nHome to the former center of the East Africa slave trade, Zanzibar’s past has been tumultuous to put it lightly.\n\nRuled by Portugal, then Oman, it became a British protectorate in the late 1800s when the slave trade was abolished. In the 1960s, Zanzibar, together with mainland Tanganyika formed the current Tanzania.\n\nFreddie Mercury in Zanzibar\n\nAs widely known as the name Freddie Mercury is, the man himself was actually born as Farrokh Bulsara. He was born in Stone Town, Zanzibar, to Parsi (western Indian) parents after they went there for work, and eventually moved to the UK at the age of 17.\n\nWhile Freddie spent a lot of his youth in India, including boarding school there, he also lived in the little house in Stone Town that is now the Freddie Mercury Museum.\n\nThe house in the small streets of Stone Town, Zanzibar where he grew up seems like a fitting place for the first museum dedicated to the Queen singer.\n\nWhere is the Freddie Mercury Museum?\n\nYou can find the Freddie Mercury Museum right in the heart of Stone Town, Zanzibar. It lies almost at the end of one of the main shopping streets, surrounded by tourist shops and hotels.\n\nNot only will you immediately spot pictures of the legendary rock star outside, but there’s a huge sign above the door that says Freddie Mercury House. Subtlety aside, it’s a popular spot for visitors, and you’ll find it on most tourist maps. Finding it won’t be an issue, trust me.\n\nWhen it comes to Zanzibar, typically people either stay in Stone Town, or at one of the beach resorts. I’d recommend a combination of the two – enjoy a few days relaxing by a beach, but also a couple of nights in the historic center. That’s how you can best experience the Freddie Mercury Museum, and other sights around Zanzibar City.\n\nHow much does the Freddie Mercury Museum cost?\n\nA visit to the museum will set you back $10 USD. While I felt that might be a bit steep for a visit to such a small house/museum, I am a fan of Queen though, so I was interested enough to want to go inside.\n\nAs with most places in Zanzibar – shops and attractions alike – you can pay in either US Dollars or local currency (Tanzania Shillings).\n\nHow long will you spend in the museum?\n\nThe museum is open every day 10am to 6pm. While you might spend an hour or more if you’re really reading absolutely everything in there, I’d say you’re more likely able to get what you’re looking for from the museum in less than an hour.\n\nI spent about 45 minutes there. During that time I felt like I was able to experience what I wanted to without being rushed.\n\nThe museum is a small-ish space so don’t get your hopes up for a a huge museum. It’s all located on one floor, with a clear path around the museum. There’s a regular sized step to get into and out of the museum, but otherwise it’s flat and easy to move around for those with mobility challenges.\n\nWhat can you see in the Freddie Mercury Museum?\n\nIf you’re looking for a ton of Queen memorabilia in the Freddie Mercury Museum you might be a little disappointed. Not to say there isn’t anything, but a large part of the museum is centered around song lyrics and photographs of Freddie growing up.\n\nFreddie Mercury as people remember him. And Farrokh Bulsara, a boy that people didn’t know. Family photos, school pictures, all are displayed along the main photo wall in the museum.\n\nOpposite are stories told by those who knew him growing up – about his life, his home in Zanzibar and his desire to be a showman. Emblazoned across the wall in big letters: “I’m not going to be a star, I’m going to be a legend”. The man had big dreams, he named their band Queen for goodness sakes!\n\nThe centerpiece of the museum is a black baby grand piano that Freddie played in his youth. Complete with a familiar yellow leather jacket draped over it. Surrounding both are blown up pictures of Freddie and Queen in concert showing just how big the band was.\n\nWhile the piano is roped off, the owner offered to let one or two people take a picture seated at the piano when I was there. So you never know, you might get a little closer to Mr. Mercury’s history than you expect.\n\nThe other main things to see here, besides photos, quotes and a piano, are handwritten song lyrics. And you may know one or two of these songs. They look like worthless scribbles on crumpled pieces of paper. But look closely and you’ll see they are Freddie’s handwritten lyrics to some of Queen’s popular songs.\n\nPowered by GetYourGuide\n\nIs the Freddie Mercury Museum worth visiting?\n\nI almost didn’t go to the Freddie Mercury Museum. I weighed up the price with how much I thought there would be to see. Was it going to be a bit of a rip off?\n\nIt was my final day in Zanzibar and my friend wanted to go back to the hotel to relax. I decided I would go to the museum, after all, what if I never made it back to Zanzibar? The final nudge was that this particular day was Freddie’s birthday, September 5th. And that’s just too coincidental not to take a sign I needed to visit.\n\nWould I go again? No. It was a little overpriced for what it was and the museum was quite small. Am I glad I went? Yes. As a Queen fan, I’m happy I decided to take a look around. I found it interesting enough, even if there wasn’t as much in there as I had hoped.\n\nIf you’re a Queen or Freddie fan then you’ll likely find it more worth a visit. If you have no idea who Freddie Mercury is, you’ll probably feel like you paid a high price to see a few photos and a piano.\n\nOne of the common complaints I saw online about the museum is that the photos can be found on the internet so there’s not much you can’t already see. Although, how many of us would do that vs. actually go to a museum? Seeing some of the song lyrics in person and a couple of other items are pretty cool.\n\nShould you take anything away from a visit to the Freddie Mercury Museum, it’s that there’s still admiration for a rock legend who died more than three decades ago. A true performer, his songs are still around today. After all, The Show Must Go On, as he would say.\n\nIf you’ve enjoyed this post leave a comment or share using the social media buttons below.
