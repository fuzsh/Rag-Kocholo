        "text": "Balapuwaduge Ajantha Winslow Mendis (Sinhala: අජන්ත මෙන්ඩිස්; born 11 March 1985) known as Ajantha Mendis is a Sri Lankan former cricketer who played for Sri Lankan national cricket team in all three formats. He was known as the \"mystery spinner\" due to the unusual bowling action and widely regarded as one of the best limited over bowlers in the world arena. In August 2019, he retired from all formats of cricket.Mendis made his One Day International debut against the West Indies at Port of Spain in 2008 and took 3 for 39. He also played for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League. He holds the record for the quickest for 50 wickets in ODIs with 19 matches. His first Test Match was against India at Colombo on 23 July 2008 in which he returned match figures of 8–132, thereby becoming the first Sri Lankan bowler to get an eight-wicket haul on Test debut. Mendis won the Emerging Player of the Year award at the ICC Awards ceremony held in Dubai in September 2008. Until February 2017, he was the only bowler to have taken six wickets in a Twenty20 International, and he has achieved the feat twice, claiming the world record figures of 6 wickets for 8 runs for Sri Lanka against Zimbabwe on 18 September 2012. On 26 October 2012 Ajantha Mendis received the Sri Lankan order of Bantu, the highest civilian honour in Sri Lanka.\n\nMahamarakkala Kurukulasooriya Patabendige Akila Dananjaya Perera is a Sri Lankan cricketer. The son of a carpenter from Panadura, Dananjaya is another installment of Sri Lanka's long line of unorthodox spinners. Officially a left-hand batsman and an off-break bowler, he is said to have seven variations, including the leg-break, googly, carrom ball, doosra and his stock off-spinner that had impressed national team captain Mahela Jayawardene so much in the nets as to make Jayawardene request him to be fast-tracked into the national squad. Dhananjaya had at that point played no first-class, List A, T20 or even U-19 cricket. This in turn led to controversy as his selection was questioned by the media on the basis of a net performance. He was selected to play for Wayamba United in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League. In only his second match for the franchise, he took 3-18 against Nagenahira Nagas, consistently disturbing the batsmen with his flight, googly and other variations. This in turn led to a place in the final squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. In the 2013 IPL auctions, Dananjaya was sold to the Chennai Super Kings for his base price of $20,000."
