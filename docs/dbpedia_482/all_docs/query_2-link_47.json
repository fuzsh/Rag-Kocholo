        "text": "Our values in detail\n\nWe value difference\n\nWe were born speaking different languages. We were founded on the strength of different experiences, attributes and voices; they are integral to who we are and how we work.\n\nThe greater our empathy and diversity, the better we reflect the worlds of our customers and communities – and the better we can serve them.\n\nSo we champion inclusivity. We listen. We remove barriers. And we seek out views different from our own.\n\nWe succeed together\n\nWe offer our customers a unique breadth of opportunity.\n\nAnd we can only deliver the full promise of this by being truly connected – across boundaries. With our customers and partners. Together as colleagues and as an organisation.\n\nSo, we collaborate across boundaries. We break down silos. We trust and support each other. And, when necessary, get out of each other’s way.\n\nTogether, we make possible what we cannot do alone.\n\nWe take responsibility\n\nWhat we do has a real impact on people’s lives, communities and the planet. We take this responsibility seriously.\n\nWe set ourselves high standards and are each accountable for our actions. We always use good judgement. And if something doesn’t feel right, as colleagues we speak up and act.\n\nWe build for tomorrow, today. We succeed only by taking the long view, by focusing on the sustainable interests of our customers, investors, and the planet we all share.\n\nWe get it done\n\nWe create value for our customers and investors by always moving forward and making things happen.\n\nWe’re entrepreneurial: we try new things, we learn and improve, and we take smart risks.\n\nWe’re dynamic: we reject mediocrity. We move at pace.\n\nWe’re decisive: we make clear choices and take bold actions.\n\nAnd we keep our word: we always do what we promise."
