        "meta_description": "When Christopher Columbus arrived on the Bahamian Island of Guanahani (San Salvador) in 1492, he encountered the TaÃ­no people, whom he described in letters as \"naked as the day they were born.\" The TaÃ­no had complex hierarchical religious, political, and social systems. Skilled farmers and navigators, they wrote music and poetry and created powerfully expressive objects. At the time of Columbusâs exploration, the TaÃ­no were the most numerous indigenous people of the Caribbean and inhabited what are now Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. By 1550, the TaÃ­no were close to extinction, many having succumbed to diseases brought by the Spaniards. TaÃ­no influences survived, however, and today appear in the beliefs, religions, language, and music of Caribbean cultures",

        "text": "After his first transatlantic voyage, Christopher Columbus sent an account of his encounters in the Americas to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain. Several copies of his manuscript were made for court officials, and a transcription was published in April 1493. This Latin translation was published the same year. In reporting on his trip to his sovereigns, Columbus wrote:\n\nThere I found very many islands, filled with innumerable people, and I have taken possession of them all for their Highnesses, done by proclamation and with the royal standard unfurled, and no opposition was offered to me.\n\nThis edition of the Columbus letter, printed in Basel in 1494, is illustrated. The five woodcuts, which supposedly illustrate Columbusâs voyage and the New World, are in fact mostly imaginary, and were probably adapted drawings of Mediterranean places. This widely published report made Columbus famous throughout Europe. It earned him the title of Admiral, secured him continued royal patronage, and enabled him to make three more trips to the Caribbean, which he firmly believed to the end was a part of Asia. Seventeen editions of the letter were published between 1493 and 1497. Only eight copies of all the editions are extant.\n\nOn January 5, 1502, prior to his fourth and final voyage to America, Columbus gathered several judges and notaries at his home in Seville to authenticate copies of original documents in which Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand had granted titles, revenues, powers, and privileges to him and his descendants. These thirty-six documents are popularly called Columbusâs \"Book of Privileges.\" Four copies of his \"Book\" existed in 1502, including one now in Paris from which the elaborate facsimile shown here was made. This publication was one of a number of major documentary projects commemorating the 400th anniversary of the first Columbus voyage in 1892.\n\nFernando ColÃ³n was born in CÃ³rdoba, Spain, in 1488 and spent his early years there with his mother. As a youth, he traveled to the New World with his father on Columbusâs fourth voyage. As an adult, Fernando became a scholar and built a large personal library using the income from his fatherâs legacy. Fernando wrote this biography in defense of his father in about 1538.\n\nThe grants of privileges and property bestowed on Christopher Columbus by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella became the subject of ongoing litigation between his descendants and the Spanish crown that lasted for centuries. The dispute was finally settled in 1796 in favor of Columbusâs descendants. This collection of printed documents, which includes extracts of Columbusâs will, relates to a dispute over the line of inheritance of one of the explorer's estates in the Americas.\n\nPreserved Pre-Columbian duhos (ceremonial wooden stools) from the Caribbean region are exceedingly rare because they are usually found only in dry highland caves. There are two basic types: low horizontal forms with concave seats, such as this one, and stools with long curved backrests. Scholars differ as to the function of the stools. Some believe they represented seats of authority. Others think they served as altars for votive offerings. Still others argue that the TaÃ­no peoples used them as ceremonial trays for making cohoba, a hallucinogenic snuff prepared for shamanistic rituals.\n\nThe TaÃ­no, a subgroup of the Arawakan Indians from northeastern South America, inhabited the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico). The TaÃ­no created a complicated religious system that included a hierarchy of deities, which included Yucahu, the supreme Creator and the lord of cassava and the sea and Atabey, the goddess of fresh water and human fertility, as well as Yucahu's mother. The TaÃ­no believed that zemis, gods of both sexes, represented by both human and animal forms, provided protection."
