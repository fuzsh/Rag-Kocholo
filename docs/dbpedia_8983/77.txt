Alisha Prakash is the Associate Editorial Director at Travel + Leisure, where she helps tell impactful travel stories. Born in India, she spent the first year of her life living on a ship, sailing around the world with her family before immigrating to New York at the age of six. Now a New Yorker through and through, she has more than a decade of journalism experience under her belt, following one important motto throughout the years: Always say yes. This has meant trekking glaciers in Patagonia, bathing elephants and eating red ant eggs in Thailand, riding motorcycles through Vietnam’s countryside, road tripping around the Himalayas, and summiting mountains in Montenegro. She travels for the food, the scenery, and the adventure, but above all, she travels for the people. Alisha believes that travel, at its core, is about celebrating diversity, and that the very idea of visiting a new destination, meeting new people, and discovering new cultures breaks down barriers and helps us find common ground.

Alisha has appeared as a travel expert on NBC's Today Show, Forbes, Insider, CBS News Radio, The Weather Channel, and more. Prior to her role at T+L, she contributed to publications like Today.com, Time Out New York, Thrillist, Glamour, Departures, Redbook Magazine, DuJour, and Tripadvisor’s travel platform, Oyster. A safari is at the top of her to-do list.
