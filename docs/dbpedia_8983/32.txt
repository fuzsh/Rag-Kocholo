Alisha Glass-Childress was named head coach of Crean Lutheran’s girls volleyball team Thursday.

Glass-Childress, who was a setter during her playing days, was on the United States National Team from 2010 to ’16. She was on the American team that won the bronze medal at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games.

She replaces Eric Olson, who remains at Crean as the school’s athletic director.
