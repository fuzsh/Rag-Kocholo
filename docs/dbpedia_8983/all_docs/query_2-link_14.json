        "text": "Canadian-American musician (born 1974)\n\n\"Alanis\" redirects here. For other uses, see Alanis (disambiguation).\n\nAlanis Nadine Morissette ( ə-LAN-iss MORR-iss-ET; born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian and American[2] singer, songwriter, and musician. She began her music career in Canada in the early 1990s with two dance-pop albums. In 1995, she released the alternative rock album Jagged Little Pill, which sold more than 33 million copies globally and propelled her to become a cultural phenomenon.[3][4][5] Morissette won the 1996 Grammy Award for Album of the Year among other accolades, and the album was adapted into a 2018 rock musical. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has Jagged Little Pill on their 200 Definitive Albums list, and it appeared on various editions of Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" guide.[6] Its lead single, \"You Oughta Know\", was also included on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list.[7]\n\nMorissette followed up with the highly anticipated experimental album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (1998). Her fifth album, Under Rug Swept (2002), marked the first time Morissette was the sole producer of an entire album. Taking further creative control and production duties, Morissette continued her career with subsequent studio albums, including So-Called Chaos (2004), Flavors of Entanglement (2008), Havoc and Bright Lights (2012), Such Pretty Forks in the Road (2020), and The Storm Before the Calm (2022). Her first three internationally released studio albums topped the Billboard 200 albums chart, and her next four albums peaked within the Top 20.[8]\n\nMorissette has sold more than 75 million records worldwide,[9][10] and has won a Brit Award, seven Grammy Awards, fourteen Juno Awards, and nominations for two Golden Globe Awards and a Tony Award. Her singles \"You Oughta Know\", \"Hand in My Pocket\", \"Ironic\", \"You Learn\", \"Head Over Feet\", \"Uninvited\", \"Thank U\", and \"Hands Clean\", reached top 40 in the major charts around the world. She also holds the record for the most No. 1s on the weekly Billboard Alternative Songs chart among female soloists, group leaders, or duo members.[11] She was once referred to as the \"Queen of Alt-Rock Angst\" by Rolling Stone,[12] and is ranked number 53 on VH1's 1999 \"100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll\".[13] In 2005, she was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nAlanis Nadine Morissette was born on June 1, 1974, at Riverside Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada,[14]: 4 [15] the daughter of Georgia Mary Ann (née Feuerstein) and Alan Richard Morissette.[16] Her older brother, Chad (born 1971), is an entrepreneur,[17] and her twin brother, Wade (12 minutes older), is a musician.[18][19] Their father is of French and Irish descent, while their mother, who fled Hungary in 1956 due to the failed anti-Soviet uprising,[14] has Jewish ancestry;[20][21] on a 2024 episode of Finding Your Roots, Morissette stated that her parents had never told the siblings about their Jewish ancestry, which she did not discover until her late 20s.[22]\n\nIn 1977, the family moved to Lahr in what was then West Germany, where Morissette's parents started working as teachers at the local CAF base.[23] They returned to Ottawa in 1980, and Morissette began taking dance lessons the next year.[24][25][26] Morissette had a Catholic upbringing.[27] She attended Holy Family Catholic School for elementary school[28] and Immaculata High School for seventh and eighth grades;[29] she appeared on the children's television sketch comedy You Can't Do That on Television for five episodes while attending the former.[30] Morissette then attended and graduated from Glebe Collegiate Institute.[14][31]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1987–1992: Alanis and Now Is the Time\n\n[edit]\n\nMorissette is known for her emotive mezzo-soprano voice and confessional songwriting.[32][33][34] She recorded her first demo called \"Fate Stay with Me\", produced by Lindsay Thomas Morgan at Marigold Studios in Toronto, and engineered by Rich Dodson of Canadian classic rock band The Stampeders.[35] A second demo tape was recorded on cassette in August 1989 and sent to Geffen Records, but the tape has never been heard as it was stolen, among other records, in a burglary of the label's headquarters in October 1989.\n\nIn 1991, MCA Records Canada released Morissette's debut album, Alanis, in Canada only. Morissette co-wrote every track on the album with its producer, Leslie Howe. The dance-pop album went platinum,[36] and its first single, \"Too Hot\", reached the top 20 on the RPM singles chart. Subsequent singles \"Walk Away\" and \"Feel Your Love\" reached the top 40. Morissette's popularity, style of music and appearance, particularly that of her hair, led her to become known as the Debbie Gibson of Canada;[37] comparisons to Tiffany were also common. During the same period, she was a concert opening act for rapper Vanilla Ice.[38] Morissette was nominated for three 1992 Juno Awards: Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year (which she won),[39] Single of the Year and Best Dance Recording (both for \"Too Hot\").[40]\n\nIn 1992, she released her second album, Now Is the Time, a ballad-driven record that featured less glitzy production than Alanis and contained more thoughtful lyrics.[37] Morissette wrote the songs with the album's producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge Côté. She said of the album, \"People could go, 'Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl's like another Tiffany or whatever.' But the way I look at it... people will like your next album if it's a kick-ass one.\"[38] As with Alanis, Now Is the Time was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles—\"An Emotion Away\", the minor adult contemporary hit \"No Apologies\" as well as \"(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time\". The industry considered it a commercial failure since it sold only a little more than half the copies of her first album.[37][41] With her two-album deal with MCA Records Canada complete, Morissette was left without a major label contract.\n\n1993–1997: Jagged Little Pill\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1993, Morissette's publisher Leeds Levy at MCA Music Publishing introduced her to manager Scott Welch.[42] Welch told HitQuarters he was impressed by her \"spectacular voice\", her character and her lyrics. At the time she was still living at home with her parents. Together they decided it would be best for her career to move to Toronto and start writing with other people.[42] After graduating from high school, Morissette moved from Ottawa to Toronto.[37] Her publisher funded part of her development and she spent her time there composing and rehearsing with a number of other musicians, looking to find good chemistry with a potential songwriting partner for her next album. Although a number of songs came out of these sessions, none would make an album cut and no lasting partnerships were formed. In a subsequent move to Los Angeles, however, she met producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, who believed in her talent enough to let her use his studio; their partnership was a stellar songwriting match, with Ballard supporting Alanis’ sound rather than trying to shape or mold it to his own tastes.[37][42] In her newfound freeness of creative spirit, the duo wrote and recorded Morissette's first internationally released album, “Jagged Little Pill,” and by the spring of 1995, she had signed a deal with Maverick Records. In the same year she learned how to play guitar. According to manager Welch, every label they approached, apart from Maverick, declined to sign Morissette.[42]\n\nMaverick Records released Jagged Little Pill internationally in June 1995. The album was expected only to sell enough for Morissette to make a follow-up, but the situation improved quickly when KROQ-FM, an influential Los Angeles modern rock radio station, began playing \"You Oughta Know\", the album's first single, featuring Flea and Dave Navarro from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.[43] The song instantly garnered attention for its scathing, explicit lyrics,[37] and a subsequent music video went into heavy rotation on MTV and MuchMusic.\n\nAfter the success of \"You Oughta Know\", the album's other hits helped send Jagged Little Pill to the top of the charts. \"All I Really Want\" and \"Hand in My Pocket\" followed, and the fourth U.S. single, \"Ironic\", became Morissette's biggest hit. \"You Learn\" and \"Head over Feet\", the fifth and sixth singles, kept Jagged Little Pill (1995) in the top 20 on the Billboard 200 albums chart for more than a year. Jagged Little Pill sold more than 16 million copies in the U.S.; it sold 33 million worldwide,[44] making it the second biggest-selling album by a female artist (behind Shania Twain's Come On Over).[45][46]\n\nMorissette's popularity grew significantly in Canada, where the album was certified twelve times platinum[36] and produced four RPM chart-toppers: \"Hand in My Pocket\", \"Ironic\", \"You Learn\", and \"Head over Feet\". The album was also a bestseller in Australia and the United Kingdom.[47][48]\n\nMorissette's success with Jagged Little Pill (1995) was credited with opening doors for female singers such as Meredith Brooks, Tracy Bonham and Patti Rothberg, and later Avril Lavigne and Pink.[49] She was criticized for collaborating with producer and supposed image-maker Ballard, and her previous disco-pop albums also proved a hindrance for her respectability.[37][50] Morissette and the album won six Juno Awards in 1996: Album of the Year, Single of the Year (\"You Oughta Know\"), Female Vocalist of the Year, Songwriter of the Year and Best Rock Album.[51] At the 16th Brit Awards she won Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act. At the 38th Annual Grammy Awards in 1996, she won Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Song (both for \"You Oughta Know\"), Best Rock Album and Album of the Year.[52]\n\n\"Ironic\" got the instant success, though the lyrics were heavily criticized for its malapropism, and the music video received 6 nominations at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, where it won Best New Artist in a Video, Best Female Video and Best Editing in a Video (won by Scott Gray, Editor), and was also nominated for Viewer's Choice, Best Direction in a Video and Video of the Year. Rather than perform that song at the ceremony, she performed \"Your House\" instead, which is homage to Joni Mitchell.[14]: 164 [53] The song was also nominated for two 1997 Grammy Awards—Record of the Year and Best Music Video, Short Form[54]—and won Single of the Year at the 1997 Juno Awards, where Morissette also won Songwriter of the Year and the International Achievement Award.[55]\n\nFollowing the album release in 1995, Morissette embarked on an 18-month world tour in support of Jagged Little Pill, beginning in small clubs and ending in large venues. Taylor Hawkins, who later joined the Foo Fighters, was the tour's drummer and Radiohead joined as the opening act in the summer of 1996.[56] The video Jagged Little Pill, Live, which was co-directed by Morissette and is about the bulk of her tour won a 1998 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Long Form.[57]\n\nFollowing the tour, Morissette began practicing Iyengar Yoga for balance. After the last December 1996 show, she went to India for six weeks, accompanied by her mother, two aunts and two friends.[58] The trip left her with an indelible impression and set the cornerstone for the concept of her next album.[59]\n\n1998–2000: Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie and Alanis Unplugged\n\n[edit]\n\nMorissette was featured as a guest vocalist on Ringo Starr's cover of \"Drift Away\" on his 1998 album, Vertical Man, and on the songs \"Don't Drink the Water\" and \"Spoon\" on the Dave Matthews Band album Before These Crowded Streets. She recorded the song \"Uninvited\" for the soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels. Although the track was never commercially released as a single, it received widespread radio airplay in the U.S. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, it won in the categories of Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and was nominated for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.[60] It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[61]\n\nIn November 1998, Morissette released her fourth album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which she wrote and produced with Glen Ballard. The label hoped to sell 1 million copies of the album on initial release;[62] instead, it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 469,000 copies—a record, at the time, for the highest first-week sales of an album by a female artist.[63] The wordy, personal lyrics on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie alienated many fans, and after the album sold considerably less than Jagged Little Pill (1995), many labelled it an example of the sophomore jinx.[37][64] It received positive reviews, including a four-star review from Rolling Stone.[65] In Canada, it won the Juno Award for Best Album and was certified four times platinum.[36][66] \"Thank U\", the album's only major international hit single, was released in October 1998 and was nominated for the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance; the music video, which featured Morissette nude, generated mild controversy.[62][67] Morissette herself directed the videos for \"Unsent\" and \"So Pure\", which won, respectively, the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Director and the Juno Award for Video of the Year.[66][68]\n\nMorissette contributed vocals to four tracks on Jonathan Elias's project The Prayer Cycle, which was released in 1999, where she paid homage to her roots by singing in Hungarian on \"Mercy\" and \"Faith\", and in French on \"Hope\" and \"Innocence\". The same year, she released the live acoustic album Alanis Unplugged, which was recorded during her appearance on the television show MTV Unplugged. It featured tracks from her previous two albums alongside four new songs, including \"King of Pain\" (a cover of The Police song) and \"No Pressure over Cappuccino\", which Morissette wrote with her main guitar player, Nick Lashley. The recording of the Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie track \"That I Would Be Good\", released as a single, became a minor hit on hot adult contemporary radio in America. Also in 1999, Morissette released a live version of her song \"Are You Still Mad\" on the charity album Live in the X Lounge II. For her live rendition of \"So Pure\" at Woodstock '99, she was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards.[69] During the summer of 1999, Morissette toured with singer-songwriter Tori Amos on the 5 and a Half Weeks Tour in support of Amos' album To Venus and Back (1999).\n\n2001–2005: Under Rug Swept and So-Called Chaos\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Morissette was featured with Stephanie McKay on the Tricky song \"Excess\", which is on his album Blowback. Morissette released her fifth studio album, Under Rug Swept, in February 2002. For the first time in her career, she took on the role of sole writer and producer of an album. Her band, comprising Joel Shearer, Nick Lashley, Chris Chaney, and Gary Novak, played the majority of the instruments; additional contributions came from Eric Avery, Dean DeLeo, Flea, and Meshell Ndegeocello.\n\nUnder Rug Swept debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, eventually going platinum in Canada and selling one million copies in the U.S.[36][70] It produced the hit single \"Hands Clean\", which topped the Canadian Singles Chart and received substantial radio play; for her work on \"Hands Clean\" and \"So Unsexy\", Morissette won a Juno Award for Producer of the Year.[71] A second single, \"Precious Illusions\", was released, but it did not garner significant success outside Canada or U.S. hot AC radio.\n\nLater in 2002, Morissette released the combination package Feast on Scraps, which includes a DVD of live concert and backstage documentary footage directed by her and a CD containing eight previously unreleased songs from the Under Rug Swept recording sessions. Preceded by the single \"Simple Together\", it sold roughly 70,000 copies in the U.S. and was nominated for a Juno Award for Music DVD of the Year.[70][72]\n\nMorissette hosted the Juno Awards of 2004 dressed in a bathrobe, which she took off to reveal a flesh-colored bodysuit, a response to the era of censorship in the U.S. caused by Janet Jackson's breast-flash incident during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.[73] Morissette released her sixth studio album, So-Called Chaos, in May 2004.[31] She wrote the songs on her own again, and co-produced the album with Tim Thorney and pop music producer John Shanks. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 chart to generally mixed critical reviews, and it became Morissette's lowest seller in the U.S.[70] The lead single, \"Everything\", achieved major success on Adult Top 40 radio in America and was moderately popular elsewhere, particularly in Canada, although it failed to reach the top 40 on the U.S. Hot 100. Because the first line of the song includes the word \"asshole\", American radio stations refused to play it, and the single version was changed to include the word \"nightmare\" instead.[73] Unhappy that U.S. radio networks had required her to change a word in the song, Canadian radio played the unaltered version, with Morissette stating at the 2004 Juno Awards in Canada: \"Well, I am overjoyed to be back in my homeland, the true North, strong and censor-free.\"[74] Two other singles, \"Out Is Through\" and \"Eight Easy Steps\", fared considerably worse, although a dance mix of \"Eight Easy Steps\" was a U.S. club hit. Morissette embarked on a U.S. summer tour with long-time friends and fellow Canadians Barenaked Ladies, working with the non-profit environmental organization Reverb.[75]\n\nTo commemorate the 10th anniversary of Jagged Little Pill (1995), Morissette released a studio acoustic version, Jagged Little Pill Acoustic, in June 2005. The album was released exclusively through Starbucks' Hear Music retail concept through their coffee shops for a six-week run. The limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and HMV North America, who retaliated by removing Morissette's other albums from sale for the duration of Starbucks's exclusive six-week sale.[76][77] As of November 2010 , Jagged Little Pill Acoustic had sold 372,000 copies in the U.S.,[70] and a video for \"Hand in My Pocket\" received rotation on VH1 in America. The accompanying tour ran for two months in mid-2005, with Morissette playing small theatre venues. During the same period, Morissette was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.[78] The singer opened for The Rolling Stones for a few dates of their A Bigger Bang Tour in the autumn of 2005.[79]\n\nMorissette released the greatest hits album Alanis Morissette: The Collection in late 2005. The lead single and only new track, a cover of Seal's \"Crazy\", was an Adult Top 40 and dance hit in the U.S., but achieved only minimal chart success elsewhere. A limited edition of The Collection features a DVD including a documentary with videos of two unreleased songs from Morissette's 1996 Can't Not Tour: \"King of Intimidation\" and \"Can't Not\". (A reworked version of \"Can't Not\" had also appeared on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.) The DVD also includes a ninety-second clip of the unreleased video for the single \"Joining You\". As of November 2010 , The Collection had sold 373,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan.[70] That same year, Morissette contributed the song \"Wunderkind\" to the soundtrack of the film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[80]\n\n2006–2010: Flavors of Entanglement\n\n[edit]\n\n2006 marked the first year in Morissette's musical career without a single concert appearance showcasing her own songs, with the exception of an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in January when she performed \"Wunderkind\".\n\nOn April 1, 2007, Morissette released a tongue-in-cheek cover of The Black Eyed Peas's selection \"My Humps\", which she recorded in a slow, mournful voice, accompanied only by a piano. The accompanying YouTube-hosted video, in which she dances provocatively with a group of men and hits the ones who act as if attempting to touch her breasts, had received 16,465,653 views as of February 15, 2009.[81] Morissette did not take any interviews for a time to explain the song, and it was theorized that she did it as an April Fools' Day joke.[82] Black Eyed Peas vocalist Stacy \"Fergie\" Ferguson responded by sending Morissette a buttocks-shaped cake with an approving note.[83] On the verge of the release of her following album, she finally elaborated on how the video came to be, citing that she became very much emotionally loaded while recording her new songs one after the other and one day she wished she could do a simple song like \"My Humps\" and the joke just took a life of its own.[81]\n\nMorissette performed at a gig for The Nightwatchman, a.k.a. Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, at the Hotel Café in Los Angeles in April 2007. The following June, she performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and \"O Canada\", the American and Canadian national anthems, in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Ottawa Senators and the Anaheim Ducks in Ottawa, Ontario.[84] (The NHL requires arenas to perform both the American and Canadian national anthems at games involving teams from both countries.) In early 2008, Morissette participated in a tour with Matchbox Twenty and Mutemath as a special guest.\n\nMorissette's seventh studio album, Flavors of Entanglement, which was produced by Guy Sigsworth, was released in mid-2008. She has stated that in late 2008, she would embark on a North American headlining tour, but in the meantime she would be promoting the album internationally by performing at shows and festivals and making television and radio appearances. The album's first single was \"Underneath\", a video for which was submitted to the 2007 Elevate Film Festival, the purpose of which festival was to create documentaries, music videos, narratives and shorts regarding subjects to raise the level of human consciousness on the earth.[85] On October 3, 2008, Morissette released the video for her latest single, \"Not as We\".[86]\n\nMorissette contributed to 1 Giant Leap, performing \"Arrival\" with Zap Mama and she has released an acoustic version of her song \"Still\" as part of a compilation from Music for Relief in support of the 2010 Haiti earthquake crisis. In 2008 she contributed a recording of \"Versions of Violence\" for the album Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace to promote peace. Morissette has also recorded a cover of the 1984 Willie Nelson and Julio Iglesias hit, \"To All the Girls I've Loved Before\", re-written as \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\".[87] Nelson played rhythm guitar on the recording.[87] In April 2010, Morissette released the song \"I Remain\", which she wrote for the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time soundtrack.
