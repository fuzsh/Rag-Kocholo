        "text": "Norman H. Volk, beloved husband, father, and businessman who devoted decades of volunteer service to improving care for older adults by championing nursing and other health care professions, passed away peacefully in his wife Alicia’s loving arms on Sunday, March 10, 2024 in his New York City home. Norman and his wife Alicia were the loves of each other’s lives. He is remembered as a valiant, dedicated, and energetic man who helped people in their time of need in quiet ways. He always stood up for the underdog.\n\nNorman is survived by his wife Alicia; his brother John (Helen); three daughters: Kari, Jenny (Don), and Heidi; four grandchildren: Michael, Madeleine, Charlotte, Margot; two stepchildren: Kendall and Nicole (Andrew); and two step-grandchildren: Bryce and Joshua.\n\nNorman was known for his business acumen; however, his pride and joy came from volunteering in service of the greater good. Norman was president and founder of the New York asset advisory firm, Chamberlain & Steward, since 1985 and he previously worked for 13 years as Senior Vice-President of Bessemer Trust. From 1979 to 2015, he served on the Board of Trustees of The John A. Hartford Foundation, a private, national philanthropy dedicated to improving the care of older adults. Norman was an iconic and beloved leader at the foundation where he served as Chair for 13 years. He was known for his love of the organization’s mission which is focused on aging and health. His support for the grantees and staff who worked hard to realize that mission was legendary.\n\n\"What really stands out about Norman is that he not only served The John A. Hartford Foundation Board of Trustees with his outstanding leadership, but he built meaningful relationships with our grantees,” said John R. Mach, Jr., Chair, The John A. Hartford Foundation. “He took the time to gain a deep understanding of their work and perspectives, and he advocated on their behalf so that they could gain more support and expand their impact.\"\n\nNorman’s board service at The John A. Hartford Foundation, which was established in 1929 and became known for funding innovative biomedical research, overlapped with the organization’s transition in 1982 to its current mission of improving the care of older adults. Norman, a superb collaborator, worked with other board leaders to steer the foundation in its initiatives in academic geriatrics and training, with a goal of nurturing leaders in health care research, education, and practice. This galvanized a sea change in geriatric healthcare that resulted in the creation of Centers of Excellence in Geriatric Medicine at medical schools across the country, the Paul B. Beeson Scholars program for researchers in geriatric care, and the Medical Student Training in Aging Research initiative, among many others that changed the trajectory of geriatric medicine.\n\n“Norman was visionary and knew that the space for improving geriatric care was a wide-open opportunity and that our foundation was uniquely suited to fill that void with important work that would make a difference ‘for the greatest good,’ as mandated by John and George Hartford,\" said Terry Fulmer, PhD, RN, FAAN, President, The John A. Hartford Foundation.\n\nHowever, it is the field of geriatric nursing that may have benefited the most from Norman’s vision and leadership. Norman was passionate about supporting nurses and was a champion for the foundation’s first nursing grant to New York University to create the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing in 1996. That grant helped launch the Hartford Geriatric Nursing Initiative, including the Building Academic Geriatric Nursing Capacity program supporting scholars and fellows, the Hartford Centers of Gerontological Nursing Excellence at many schools of nursing, and fostered grants to support curriculum change in academic nursing programs to embed geriatrics across all nursing education. Norman was a fixture at geriatric nursing project site visits and conferences, and he donated his time and thoughtful advice to nursing leaders and students, alike. Norman is remembered for his “vivacity of mind and spirit,” and his glorious sense of humor. One year, he agreed to present at a geriatric nursing conference with a session theme based on A Christmas Carol. Norman heartily participated, sharing lessons from the past, present and future – and he dressed up for the part!\n\n“Norman was always trying to move the world to a better place. He was not patient about change. In the very best sense of that. ‘We need to have an impact and we need to have it now’ – that’s how he thought and approached the work,” said Laura Carstensen, PhD, Fairleigh S. Dickinson Jr. Professor in Public Policy, Professor of Psychology, Director, Stanford Center on Longevity. “Additionally, in the last 10 years the status of nurses has gone up, and I see Norman playing a key role in that. What Norman saw is that nurses are the ones actually treating patients and contributing powerfully to how patients recover – and how fast. He was dedicated to making that clearer to funders, to hospitals, and to society.\"\n\nNorman went beyond his service at The John A. Hartford Foundation to be a force in the field of nursing, geriatrics, and health care. He served as a member of the Advisory Council of Stanford University’s Center on Longevity. He was a member of the New York University College of Nursing Board of Advisors since its inception in 2005, where, with his wife, Alicia, he endowed the annual Norman and Alicia Volk Lecture on Geriatric Nursing. Norman was a board member of the American Federation for Aging Research from 2020 to 2023. He was a Trustee at his alma mater, Valparaiso University, and was a member of the National Council at its College of Nursing. Norman also served as an advisor of Old Westbury Gardens for over 30 years. In 2005, Mr. Volk became a member of the New York State Delegation at the White House Conference on Aging at the invitation of the Governor of New York and the New York State Office for the Aging.\n\nHonors for Norman Volk include the Award of Distinction from the American Federation for Aging Research; the first Jonas Center Award for Advancing Nursing Leadership; the Friend of the College of Nursing Award from Marquette University; and the International Award from Sigma Theta Tau International, the Honor Society of Nursing. The New York Academy of Medicine honored him at their Healthy Cities, Healthy World annual event in 2015.\n\nNorman will always be adored by The John A. Hartford Foundation staff for his generosity, humility, and wisdom. He continually showed his care and concern for everyone at the foundation, and his dedication to the organization’s mission was unwavering. His steady hand helped guide the foundation through times of both turbulence and of wonderful growth. He assisted in the organization’s staff leadership transition in 2015, which has set the basis for continued success in spreading the Age-Friendly Health Systems movement that is built on the legacy of geriatric medicine, nursing and social work programs that Norman helped create. The foundation and its grantees are profoundly grateful and indebted to Norman Volk, who is a true hero and will always be beloved.\n\n“While Norm changed the world as a giant among philanthropists, to his close friends he will always be remembered for his magical combination of love, loyalty, charm, and great humor,” said Thomas E. Moore III of Morgan Stanley. “His greatness and ability to inspire those around him will forever endure, as will the memory of that mischievous ‘twinkle’ in his eyes. He will be missed every minute of every day.”\n\nA memorial service will be held on Saturday, April 13 at 2pm ET at Saint Thomas Church (1 W 53rd Street, New York, NY 10019).\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing.\n\nPlease enjoy this tribute video honoring Norman Volk's retirement from the JAHF Board of Trustees.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Dana Gluckstein 2012"
