        "text": "The community of Leland will honor native Alisha Glass, who won a bronze medal with the United States' volleyball team in the Summer Olympics, with a homecoming celebration Friday night.\n\nGlass, the starting setter on the team, is expected to arrive at the Cherry Capital Airport in Traverse City at 5:45 p.m. and then head to Leland High School where she will speak at about 7 p.m. The Leland Michigan Chamber of Commerce posted the notice on its Facebook page Thursday afternoon.\n\nWell-wishers are invited to greet her at the airport and she will receive a police escort to the school where she will be available for photos and autographs after she speaks.\n\nThe 28-year-old Glass, who was Miss Volleyball in 2006 before a decorated career at Penn State, led the U.S. team to victory over the Netherlands on Saturday for the bronze. The team bounced back a day after a loss to Serbia.\n\nEarlier this week, Glass posted a note on Instagram saying she was \"forever grateful\" for the Olympic experience and thanking those involved in her journey.\n\n\"We put our all into each match, each point,\" she wrote. \"We brought 'our good' everyday, to showcase the team that we had become, the team culture we had fought for, and to honor everyone's contributions. We weren't able to be the first team to bring home the gold, but we stayed true to ourselves, showed heart and grit, and we fought until the very end! I'm so proud of this group!!\"\n\nGlass ended her high school career at Leland as the national record holder in career aces (937), career kills (3,584) and aces in a season (296).\n\nA member of the U.S. national team since 2009, Glass has received numerous honors. She was named USA Volleyball's female indoor athlete of the year in 2013 and 14; was the best setter in the FIVB World Championships in Italy in 2014, and, earlier this year, was selected the best setter in the NORCECA Olympic Qualifying Tournament."
