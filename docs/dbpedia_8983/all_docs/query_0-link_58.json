My name is Enyah Perez and I’m so happy for the opportunity to introduce myself to the community and in a returning capacity as I am also proudly a MAMS alum! And now, after spending most of my life in education-I feel more poised and honored to return along side the amazing staff here at Mater Amoris. Studying and learning from the Montessori method has offered so much in my understanding of the world - how it works in terms of the physical and how it is shaped, designed and built. As a child, it gave me the internal structure for understanding my passions and interests and has laid a foundation for which I connect with the world and find inner peace. A little about me - my primary interests and hobbies surround positivity, music, art, science, nature and how we all can relate to each other through these wonderful things. My education after Mater Amoris led me to the Field School in Washington D.C. and then the University Of Hartford where I graduated from the Hartt School of music with a BFA in Music Production and Technology. After college I spent some time working as a DJ/musician and teacher in Oregon where I spent part time as a wedding DJ, 10 years as a High School special needs assistant teacher, a mac and cheese chef and a basketball coach with Special Olympics Oregon. All this said, I can’t wait for a chance to get to know you all and work with the students here at Mater Amoris!\n\nEmily began her teaching career 15 years ago as an ESL teacher in South Korea.

In one form or another, Mary’s always been in school- as a student, as a teacher, or as a parent volunteer. After earning a Bachelor’s in Anthropology, she stumbled into her first job as an assistant in a local Montessori school. While there, she became enthralled with the work the children did. It seemed amazing that such challenging concepts were always presented in such a straightforward and concrete way. What followed next could only be described as a flurry of graduate school. First, Mary attended St. John’s College in Annapolis, earning a Master’s in Liberal Arts. It was here she rediscovered her love of philosophy and became convinced that Euclid most certainly was a genius (until she came across non-Euclidean geometry and had to rethink things). After that, Mary attended the Washington Montessori Institute, earning her AMI Elementary Diploma and a Master’s in Education from Loyola. Since then, she’s enjoyed working in both Upper Elementary and Adolescent classrooms, and is constantly reaffirming her belief that Maria Montessori was the smartest person ever. Recently, Mary has been working on her most challenging position yet, Montessori mother to 3 young boys. In her “free” time, Mary enjoys anything that can be done outside or in a kitchen, or both."
