I can understand very complicated theories but I have difficulty distinguishing my left from right hand, as well as minor reading difficulty.\n\nHow do I make a difference?\n\nI hope that I serve as a role model for those who have had to struggle to achieve their goals. I also hope that those who do achieve their dreams also remember that what is most important is who they are as people. That has been one of my most important life goals.\n\nWho was my mentor?\n\nI had several: Dr. Jack Bristol, Lillian May Berry, and Dr. Miguel Medina. They have all contributed greatly to my career.\n\nHow has my career evolved over time?\n\nI enjoy what I do. I am currently heavily involved in administration and program development. I returned to obtain a public health degree because I felt I could contribute more to my community if populations were impacted, not just individual patients."
