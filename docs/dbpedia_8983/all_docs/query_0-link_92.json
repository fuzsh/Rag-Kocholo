Farrell Detroit Free Press\n\nIt was a long morning for Meredith Norris. She came arrived at Corunna High School with a puffy face after a dentist appointment.\n\nThen she got a tweet from a friend, alerting her that she had been named Michigan’s Miss Volleyball minutes before a celebratory assembly. Grandmothers Mary Norris and Maple Smith surprised her, along with grandfather Harvey Norris and aunt Terre Smith.\n\n“It was still really cool,” Norris said. “My face was numb until 20 minutes ago, so I’m really glad that resolved itself. That would’ve been awkward.’’\n\nNorris won the closest Michigan Miss Volleyball vote ever, edging Novi’s Alyssa Cummings, 160-159, in voting points. Norris had 22 first-place votes Cummings had 19.\n\n“Wow,’’ Norris said of the close vote total.\n\nLexi Nordmann of DeWitt was third in voting conducted by the Michigan Volleyball Coaches Association, with 127.\n\nThe 6-foot-3 senior outside hitter made up her mind at an early age that volleyball would be her ticket to a college scholarship. She is headed to Michigan State next season.\n\n“My eighth-grade history and conditioning teacher made that phrase up for me: D-I or D-none,” Norris said. “He’s a lifelong friend and an amazing person. He’s the AD at Fowlerville right now, Brian Osborn. He made it up for me, and I stuck to it.’’\n\nNorris became only the second player in Michigan history to record 3,000 kills in her career. She also led the team to its first regional championship and has a Tuesday date against Cadillac in Grayling for a chance to advance to the Class B state semifinal at Battle Creek.\n\nShe has 3,093 kills, 306 aces, 2,182 digs, 289 blocks and 283 assists in her career. Norris also has the top two all-time single-game kill marks (56 and 53), according to the Michigan High School Athletic Association, and four of the top 13.\n\nIncredibly, the team lost when she set the record against Goodrich last year.\n\n“It was the district final,’’ she said. “We had an amazing fight. We were down, 16-24, and came back and won the set, 32-30. I don’t even know how to explain it. Then we came back down, 9-14, in the fifth set and came back to within 14-13, and they scored that last final point, and it was heartbreaking. We worked so hard and we just couldn’t pull out the win. That same team went to the quarterfinals. Imagine if we would’ve gotten one more point.’’\n\nWhen Norris was born in 1999, her mother, Nikki, was coaching volleyball at Corunna. As she grew up, Meredith would find herself bouncing around the gym during practices and at the end of the bench during games, soaking up what was happening on the floor.\n\n“I remember one trip to Warren, I had both girls in the car, and she said, ‘I’m doing this to get a college scholarship,’’’ said Nikki, now the school’s athletic director. “I said, ‘Oh, that is not our intention for you. That’s not our expectation. I don’t want you to feel the pressure that you need to get a college scholarship.’\n\n“I told her I just wanted her to do what she loved. She said, ‘Well, that’s what I’m going to do.’ … It has been a lot of fun to watch her work and understand what it takes to achieve that goal.’’\n\nAdded coach Kari Carnell: “She has worked extremely hard; she’s a definite student of the game. She picks things up quickly. She set goals for herself and she has been able to reach them by working hard and getting it and understanding it. She has traveled all over to play volleyball. She has a lot of experience. She has an awesome job of representing herself and the things she stands for.’’\n\nCorunna volleyball coach overcomes pain to complete first Marathon\n\nEven though she stands out physically and athletically, Norris embraces her teammates.\n\n“She’s a really good friend and super at volleyball,’’ said Skye Rivett, her best friend on the team. “She’s easy to talk to and really understanding. She’s not cocky about it. She could be, but she’s not. It kind of rubs off. Everyone wants to be that good to impress her. She makes everyone a little bit better.”\n\n2016 Miss Volleyball ​Voting\n\nMeredith Norris, Corunna, 160\n\nAlyssa Cummings, Novi, 159\n\nLexi Nordmann, DeWitt, 127\n\nAli Finch, Cadillac, 107\n\nCharley Andrews, Harper Creek, 95\n\nMadison Miner, North Branch, 81\n\nEmily Martin, Northville, 70\n\nStefanie Jankiewicz, Farmington Hills Harrison, 37\n\nEmmalee Flagstead, Montague, 28\n\n2015\n\nSummer drive nets Milana honor. Romeo standout used motivation from being cut to have standout season\n\nBy Perry A. Farrell Detroit Free Press\n\nGia Milana shows off her Miss Volleyball trophy at Romeo High. “I’m just really excited right now,” she said.\n\nIt already was a big day at Romeo High School. The football team, one of four left in the Division 1 playoffs, was being honored at an assembly. The girls golf team, swim and diving teams, boys and girls cross-country teams, and the volleyball team also were being honored Monday. They didn’t know that a Lady Bulldog was being recognized as the best volleyball player in Michigan.\n\nGia Milana, who led Romeo to the Division 1 state title a year ago, was named Miss Volleyball by the Michigan Interscholastic Volleyball Coaches Association. She received 299 votes to dominate the field. Victoria Iacobelli of Novi was second with 125 votes, Dylynn Otte of Grand Rapids Christian third with 105, and Emily Tanski of Gabriel Richard fourth with 92.\n\n“I’m just so blessed by God that I have the ability and opportunity to do this,” Milana said in front of a packed gym. “I’m just really excited right now and thankful to everyone that contributed to my success.”\n\nGina Milana was asked what she wanted the world to know about her daughter. She couldn’t immediately answer. However, she did say one of the best things that happened to Gia was a disappointment she experienced over the summer. She was one of 20 high school volleyball players picked to try out for the High Performance Youth National Team. The group trained in Colorado Springs, Colo. Twelve made the team and competed in Lima, Peru. She was one of eight cut.\n\n“That was probably one of the best things that could’ve happened, to be honest,’’ Gina said. “I don’t think she has ever been told she wasn’t good enough in volleyball. I think it’s very easy to get by on what has always gotten you through. I think when she walked into that gym with those girls, she felt for the first time she might not had everything that it took. As much as it hurt, it drove her and focused her on what she really needed to do if she wanted to take the sport to the level that she wants to be playing it at.’’\n\nMonday she had everything that it took. She realized she’s not the same because of what she went through over the summer.\n\n“When you’re training with the top-20 girls in the country and they’re hitting balls at you and you can’t let the ball touch the floor, there’s a lot on you,’’ Gia said. “It’s a lot to learn. I matured a lot over the summer. Being in that atmosphere and being held accountable for every touch that I had, it all mattered. I learned a lot.’’\n\nTeammate and friend Breanna Olley said there was an adjustment period. “We saw it; we knew she was more advanced than us,’’ Olley said. “The way she approached the game … she taught us when she knew. She brought her knowledge to the game and made us and herself better players.’’\n\nMilana was so focused on the task at hand, playing Traverse City West at Midland High today, she didn’t know when the award was handed out.\n\n“I knew it was going to be announced soon, but I didn’t know when,’’ she said. “I want to make the most out of what this team can do and get the farthest that we can.’’\n\nHer mother then realized what she wanted people to know about her daughter they didn’t know. “She hates losing more than she loves winning, how’s that?’’\n\nGood.\n\nJULIAN H.

She has always been around it. She was around when Molly Coldren was there. She was the team mascot, running around at practice, shagging balls and doing her thing.”\n\nBasketball and soccer were always Katherine’s favorite sports.\n\n“Quite honestly she could’ve been better in basketball,” said Tanya.\n\nMichigan Miss Volleyball – Katherine Carlson\n\nShe turned out not to be bad in volleyball.\n\nOn Monday in one of the best fields ever assembled for Miss Volleyball candidates in the state of Michigan, the coaches tabbed Carlson as the 2014 winner.\n\nCarlson, the first winner from the school, received 177 votes. Second place was Katie Placek of Traverse City West with 116, Nicole Rightnowar of Temperance Bedford with 110; Laura Willson of North Branch with 91 and Jenna Lerg of Farmington Hills Mercy with 91. The award is presented by the Michigan Interscholastic Volleyball Coaches Association and the Free Press.\n\nKatherine Carlson talks after winning Miss Volleyball\n\nShe entered a dark gym with her mom and couldn’t nearly walk as he approached the podium.\n\n“I had no idea what was going on,” said Carlson. “Ms. Wroubel told me I won Miss Volleyball and I couldn’t believe it.\n\n“My mom had said she lost her wedding ring and she was cleaning out my car yesterday. She was ‘oh I think I left it in your car.’ She pulled me out of class. I had to get my keys and go look for it.’ Then she said she had something to do in the gym and she wanted me to come with her. All of a sudden it’s dark and I see these lights flashing.”\n\nCarlson currently sits at 991 kills this season and 3,165 career for her career heading into Tuesday’s quarterfinal against Dearborn Divine Child at Clawson High School.\n\n“I totally anticipate that she will go over the 1,000 kill mark for the second straight season on this Tuesday,” said Wroubel. “This is simply just an incredible accomplishment.\n\n“From my vantage point I cannot think of a more deserving player than Katherine Carlson. Her skill is just one thing but her love and passion, not only for the game but her teammates sets Katherine above any athlete that I have known or coached. In addition to being a great player and teammate Katherine is also an excellent student and is involved in her community.”\n\nCarlson had a chance to showcase her talents last year in helping the Irish capture the Class B state title.\n\nThis year she has the team on track to get to Battle Creek again after a huge regional final victory at Marysville against All-American Ali Bastianelli on her home floor by coming up with 21 kills.\n\nThe 5-foot-11 outside hitter was first team All-State as a junior and was first-team All-American by Maxpreps. She was also was named first-team All-State as a sophomore. After being recruited by Notre Dame, Duke, Western Michigan, and George Washington Carlson committed to Valparaiso.\n\nIn the classroom she has a 4.37 grade-point average.\n\n“She makes everything look so fluid and easy,” said Wroubel.\n\nIn a field that was so impressive that two Division 1 recruits weren’t on the list, both Tanya and Wroubel believed Carlson drew the attraction of coaches because of her love of the game exhibited in her play.\n\n“It wasn’t until freshman year that she developed that true passion for volleyball,” said Tanya. “I never pushed her because it was my favorite sport. We wanted her to be a three-sport athlete. At first she seemed to gravitate towards basketball and soccer. My husband and I were big on multi-sports, using different muscle groups, different teammates; different coaches.\n\n“I was actually surprised when she developed this huge, huge passion for volleyball.”\n\nCarlson said basketball was her favorite sport until high school.\n\n“It changed because I grew a little bit and I enjoyed it more,” said Carlson. “I just enjoyed hitting the ball and getting that kill. I had a passion for the game and I think that what really drove me to where I am today.”\n\nAshley Knutson, one of Carlson’s best friends on the team said: “It was great to see how happy she was. She plays with a lot of heart. She plays not only for herself, but for her teammates. All of her accomplishments; she always comes back to us and tell us how great we are to help her.\n\n“She’s always very humble about her accomplishments.”\n\nPast Miss Volleyball winners\n\n2003: LinseyTaatjes, Grand Rapids Forest Hills Northern\n\n2004: Angie McGinnis, Fraser\n\n2005: Stephanie Booms, Marysville\n\n2006: Alisha Glass, Leland\n\n2007: Lauren Jones, East Kentwood\n\n2007: KyndraAbron, Livonia Churchill\n\n2008: Olivia Kohler, North Branch\n\n2009: Alexandra Cocklin, Birmingham Marian\n\n2010: Jordan Fish, North Branch\n\n2011: Maddy Doyle, Farmington Hills Mercy\n\n2012: Amanda McKinzie, Battle Creek St. Philip\n\n2013: Carli Snyder, Macomb Dakota\n\nContact Perry A.
