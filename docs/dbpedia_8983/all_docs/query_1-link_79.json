        "text": "Elijah Price, also known as Mr. Glass, was a very intelligent gallery owner for comic books who suffered from a disease that rendered his bones brittle, causing them to break easily. After the Eastrail 177 Crash, he befriended David Dunn because of his interests in comic books and tries to get him to become a superhero. Unbeknownst to David, it was Elijah who orchestrated the train crash all along, allowing Elijah to become the villain to David's superhero.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nBorn with a brittle bone disease, Elijah's disease caused him to be heavily bullied as a child, with some mocking him with the name Mr. Glass. When Elijah refused to leave his house one day his mother left a present for him on a park bench and left his house to see what was his very first comic book.\n\nEvents in Unbreakable[]\n\nEvents in Split[]\n\nAfter the murders committed by Kevin Wendell Crumb were discovered at the Philadelphia Zoo, the media speculated on Kevin's DID and gave him the alias of The Horde. At a diner, a group of costumers compared this speculation to a man in a wheelchair who was incarcerated fifteen years prior. Next to them, David responds that it was Mr. Glass, before taking a sip of his coffee.\n\nEvents in Glass[]\n\nElijah was heavily sedated in Glass. He stopped himself from being sedated by slashing the throat of one of Raven Hill's doctors, Daryl, he uses... well... glass to slash him in the throat, and says, \"Took a bitch-ass time to find the right piece.\" He then teams up with The Horde to wreak havoc upon Philadelphia, particularly at the recently completed Osaka Tower, but David and his son Joseph reveal to the Beast that Kevin's father died in the same train crash which gave David his powers. With this revelation, Price tells an infuriated Beast that he wouldn't have emerged if the train crash never happened. While the Beast thanks Price for allowing him to emerge, he distrusts Price because he killed Kevin's father and punches him off of his wheelchair, fracturing his bones until he dies from blood loss. Just before he does, he regards, \"I wasn't a mistake, Mama.\"\n\nPersonality[]\n\nElijah Price is a complex individual. He is intelligent and observant, acting as a perfectly respectable member of society but is shown to possess an obsessive streak when it comes to the existence of superhumans. Throughout the first film, Elijah acted as both a friend and mentor to David Dunn, helping him embrace his destiny as a superhero in hopes to make the world a better place. He was even clever enough to deduce Ellie Staple's true intentions and the Clover Organization's existence.\n\nHowever, despite his charismatic and friendly approach, Elijah is shown to possess an inferiority complex brought on by his Osteogenesis Imperfecta. That combined with his obsession has made Elijah dangerous and violent as he committed several domestic terrorist attacks throughout Philadelphia in search of his opposite, which resulted in many deaths. Elijah is shown to be a skilled manipulator, having been able to pit David and the Beast against one another at the Raven Hill Memorial courtyard while also secretly filming the whole confrontation under the Clover Organization's nose before automatically sending it to Casey, Joseph, and his mother on their smartphones, allowing them to expose the existence of people with superhuman abilities.\n\nElijah is shown to be a fatalist and believes that his existence was not a mistake. He fully embraced his destiny as a supervillain and David's archenemy, even embracing his childhood nickname \"Mr. Glass\". Prior to his death, Elijah took pride in all of the atrocities he accomplished, which further examines his position as a mastermind and a supervillain.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nIntelligence: Elijah's gift is his intelligence. He was able to study many different types of science and mathematics in order to orchestrate the disaster that brought David Dunn to him.\n\nWeaknesses[]\n\nDisease: As a result of Type 1 Osteogenesis Imperfecta, his bones are brittle and break easily. This led to him using canes and wheelchairs. His disease also sparked his interest in superheroes. Elijah believes that if someone as brittle as him exists, then someone must be on the opposite end. Someone, unbreakable.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nAllies[]\n\nMrs. Price - Mother\n\nAudrey Dunn † - Therapist\n\nEnemies[]"
