PSU opened league play with a sweep against Rutgers, 3-0 (25-17, 25-17, 25-5) last Wednesday before toppling Northwestern in Evanston, Illinois, 3-0 (27-25, 25-17, 25-17).\n\n- For the 12th time in 2016, Simone Lee led the way on offense, posting 10 kills in the most recent outing against Northwestern. The junior outside hitter also scored on a career-best four aces while adding eight digs, a pair of blocks and an assist.\n\n- Four other players notched five or more kills in the match against Northwestern. Junior opposite Heidi Thelen notched nine kills, middle blockers Tori Gorrell and Haleigh Washington each added six, and junior outside Ali Frantti posted five kills.\n\n- Lee paces the team in kills through two matches of Big Ten play with 23. Washington has made seven stuffs during league matches, while junior setter Abby Detering posted team bests with 66 assists and six aces.\n\n- After last match, Washington ranks among the top 25 in the country in hitting percentage.

Her ability to kill the ball has ranked among the nation's elite, ranking 42nd in the nation in kills per set (third in the Big Ten), while coming in at No. 40 in points per set nationally with 4.70 (second in the Big Ten).\n\n- Penn State's ability to limit opponent's offense has been unmatched this season. The Nittany Lions lead the country in limiting opponent's hitting percentage, holding the opposition to a measly .093 efficiency.\n\n- PSU finds itself among the top 25 in the country in two other statistical categories. The Nittany Lions have hit the ball at a .299 clip in 2016, coming in second in the league and sixth nationally.

PSU has won four straight, including a 3-0 win when the two teams last met in East Lansing, Michigan, on Oct. 24, 2015.\n\nPenn State squares off against Michigan on Saturday night with a 47-4 lead in all matches.

The next lowest opponent hitting percentage in the Big Ten is 0.40 points higher, with Wisconsin limiting foes to a .133 clip.\n\nLEE'S OFFENSE GUIDES NITTANY LIONS\n\nWith double-figure kills in all but one match this season, junior Simone Lee's 4.09 kills per set ranks fifth in the Big Ten standings and 42nd nationally. Lee also ranks 40th in points nationally, logging 4.70 per set. Lee led the team in kills in both of last week's sweeps, posting 13 against Rutgers and 10 against Northwestern.\n\nDETERING TAKING THE REIGNS\n\nJunior transfer Abby Detering (Florida) and redshirt sophomore Bryanna Weiskircher split time early in the non-conference slate at the setting position.

Most recently, the Edgewood, Kentucky native posted nine kills against Northwestern while adding a team-best four blocks.\n\nWHITE BECOMING BACK ROW FIXTURE\n\nWith 13 matches of the 2016 season in the books, freshman defensive specialist Kendall White has made a name for herself this season, starting each of her 13 matches at libero.

The rookie is half a dig per set shy of the conference's top five. Last weekend, White logged 23 digs over six sets, averaging for 3.83 per frame.\n\nAVCA POLL UPDATE: RELEASE 6\n\nPenn State ascended another two spots to No. 16 in the latest release of the AVCA Top 25 Coaches Poll.
