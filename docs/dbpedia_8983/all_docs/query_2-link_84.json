        "text": "Abrahan Lariz\n\nSac State alum who proudly calls Pismo Beach his hometown. This avid sports fan and skier is also pro-pineapple-on-pizza. When he’s not sharing a slice with friends (and tales of his years as a rodeo clown), he’s got his sights on Antarctica—and visiting every continent on earth. RSE-er since 2022.\n\nAlicia Frescas\n\nJust call her “Fresh.” This LA native and Boston University grad has a serious passion for 90s hip-hop, collecting souvenir t-shirts, and ASMR. Estate sale treasure hunter by day, pro-tamale maker by night. Dreams of one day appearing on an episode of “Finding Your Roots” with Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and learning how to tap dance, whichever comes first. RSE-er since 2022.\n\nAshtyn Darnell\n\nThis proud Oregon Duck packs a sweet punch. Known for her yummy shortbread cookies and love of sugar, she’s also a savvy thrifter and admitted Netflix binger. In addition to helping clients achieve their goals, she has some in mind herself—learning to cook a perfect medium-rare steak and perfecting her roller skating. Hopefully not at the same time. RSEr since 2022.\n\nChris Holben\n\nChris Holben is a natural born communicator. So it was only natural that in 1991, at the age of 31, he ran for office in his home state of Michigan. And if not for a few hanging chads, he just might have won. Fortunately, he was able to scratch his political itch as a business and marketing adviser to Governor Pete Wilson, whom he also worked for during Wilson's days in the U.S. senate. These days, Chris works a few blocks east of the Capitol building at the RSE offices in midtown Sacramento, where he manages the business and RSE's public relations team, oversees business development, and provides strategic counsel on behalf of existing clients.\n\nChris Inclenrock\n\nA day in the coastal sunshine with family is one of this Michigan native’s many ideas of perfection. When not bringing the heat in the kitchen or on the racquetball court, you might find our creative leader taking in a Giants game or pondering his favorite year of the Grateful Dead. RSE’er since 2024.\n\nKimi Fong\n\nSacramento native and UC Santa Cruz grad with a serious passion for Swedish Fish candy, and her two dogs Ocho and Martin. When not working on improving her Spanish or crochet skills, you’ll probably find her enjoying a re-watch of The Wire or hitting the slopes. RSE-er since 2022.\n\nLaura Murrell\n\nHailing from San Diego, this world traveler is always planning her next trip. An alum of the UC Davis Dance Team, not only can she burn up the dance floor, she also loves reality TV and staying up-to-date on the latest Real Housewives drama. Between work and travels, catch her recharging with yoga or running a 5K. RSEr since 2024\n\nLauren Lampright\n\nThere’s a Gopher in the house! This University of Minnesota–Twin Cities alum brings midwest flavor to Sacramento. Not just with her cooking, which she readily takes pride in, but with her drive. Case in point: setting her sights on races in every major U.S. city. Next up: running the Boston Marathon. RSEr since 2022.\n\nLeslie Valdivia\n\nThis dog mom loves RSE so much that she came back for round two. Used to play the clarinet. Currently plays podcasts and audiobooks around the clock. Look out for her in Salinas with a local latte or craft cocktail in hand, depending on the time and place. RSE-er since 2016 and again in 2023.\n\nPaul McClure\n\nPaul McClure is one of those rare advertising professionals with experience on both sides of the conference table. He started his career with some of the largest advertising firms on the West Coast, then flipped to the client side and spent three years with Bally’s Total Fitness. Eventually he rose to become vice president and co-owner of Glass McClure Advertising in Sacramento. Fortunately for us, Paul brought his expertise to RSE in April of 2010. Currently, Paul spends time out of the office as a board member for PBS-KVIE, the Los Rios Colleges Foundation, and as past-board chair for Cristo Rey High School. He has also served on the boards and committees of several other organizations. As if that isn’t enough, Paul is also an avid cycler—in fact, that may be the only time he actually sits down.\n\nSandra Levy\n\nWisconsinite with a long-time residency in LA. When she's not walking her dogs, spending time with her children or reading a page-turning novel on the beach, she aspires to learn the cello or write a great novel of her own. RSE-er since 2018.\n\nScott Rose\n\nScott Rose joined RSE in 1991 and became an owner in 1999. Scott's understanding of the interplay between media, politics and outreach has been helpful guiding clients through the most complicated of issues ranging from land use matters, gaming, pension issues and litigation support. So much so that he was included on Sacramento Magazine's list of \"Power and Influence 100\". Before joining RSE, Scott served three years in the office of Assemblyman Rusty Areias, where he was responsible for marketing and public relations, media relations and special events planning. This experience gave Scott his unique understanding of government and the media, his ability to remain calm in the face of crisis, and laser-like focus in achieving his clients' goals."
