        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado (July 12, 2016) – USA Volleyball is proud to announce its 12-player U.S. Olympic Women’s Volleyball Team roster that will try to make history in the 2016 Olympic Games from Aug. 6-20.\n\nU.S. Women’s National Team Head Coach Karch Kiraly and his staff have selected a roster with four Olympic veterans and eight players who will be making their first appearances on the grandest sporting stage. Middles Foluke Akinradewo (Plantation, Florida) and Christa Dietzen (Hopewell Township, Pennsylvania,), outside hitter Jordan Larson (Hooper, Nebraska) and setter Courtney Thompson (Kent, Washington) return from Team USA’s 2012 Olympic Games silver-medal finish in London.\n\nNewcomers to the Olympian family are outside hitters Kim Hill (Portland, Oregon) and Kelsey Robinson (Bartlett, Illinois), middle Rachael Adams (Cincinnati, Ohio,), opposites Karsta Lowe (Rancho Santa Fe, California,) and Kelly Murphy (Wilmington, Illinois), setters Alisha Glass (Leland, Michigan) and Carli Lloyd (Bonsall, California, Media Downloads), and libero Kayla Banwarth (Dubuque, Iowa).\n\nAll told, the roster will have three outside hitters, three middles, three setters, two opposites and one libero who average 27.0 years of age. Thompson, who turns 32 in November, is the oldest member of the squad and the only player in her 30s. Lowe, who turned 23 in February and is her second year with the program, is the youngest member of the team in terms of age and national team experience.\n\n“We aspire to be a team that adds up to far more than the sums of our parts,” Kiraly said. “We are extremely fortunate to have so many great people and great players who give us so much passion and effort to this program – and we will look to honor their contributions by competing our hardest in Rio. Ultimately, we have assembled a group that we believe is capable of embracing the challenges a tournament like the Olympics will surely present.”\n\nEight players have been designated as alternates for the U.S. Olympic Women’s Volleyball Team: middles Alexis Crimes (Rancho Cucamonga, California) and Lauren Paolini (Ann Arbor, Michigan); outside hitters Michelle Bartsch (Maryville, Illinois), Megan Easy (Boston, Massachusetts) and Krista Vansant (Redlands, California); opposite Nicole Fawcett (Zanesfield, Ohio); libero Natalie Hagglund (Encinitas, California); and setter Molly Kreklow (Delano, Minnesota).\n\nKiraly, the only player to win Olympic gold in both indoor (1984 and 1988) and beach volleyball (1996), is making his fifth total Olympic appearance after serving as assistant coach for the U.S. Women at the 2012 Olympic Games. His coaching staff for the 2016 Olympics includes assistant coaches Jamie Morrison, Tom Black and David Hunt. Morrison was an assistant coach for the U.S. Women at the 2012 Olympic Games and before that the technical coordinator for the U.S. Men as they won gold at the 2008 Olympics. Joe Trinsey will serve as the U.S. Women’s technical coordinator, while Marv Dunphy and JJ Van Niel have been selected as the scout coaches. Dunphy served as the head coach of the 1988 U.S. Olympic Men’s Team that won gold in Seoul. Jill Wosmek has been selected as the athletic trainer and Dr. Andrew Gregory completes the medical staff. James Stitz will serve as the strength coach, Dr. Michael Gervais as elite performance psychologist and Denise Sheldon will be the team manager.\n\nGoing for another ‘First’ in Rio\n\nThe U.S. Women’s National Team, ranked No. 1 in the world by the FIVB, has produced several ‘firsts’ in the current Olympic quadrennial. Kiraly took over the program in late September 2012 for his first head coaching position. In 2014, he guided the U.S. Women to their first-ever FIVB World Championship gold medal in 62 years, which also marked the Americans’ first gold medal in any of the three triple crown events – World Championship, FIVB World Cup or Olympic Games.\n\nThe remaining first yet to accomplish for the U.S. Women is claiming their first Olympic Games gold medal. The squad, which has earned three Olympic silver medals (1984, 2008 and 2012), is poised to make the top podium step with a core group of veterans mixed in with five newcomers who joined the squad since 2013 and contributed heavily to the success of the squad in recent tournaments.\n\nU.S. Women on a Roll Heading into Olympic Games\n\nThe U.S. Women, who have won six of their last eight tournaments dating back to the 2014 FIVB World Championship, just returned from Thailand where it captured the silver medal in the FIVB World Grand Prix – the premier annual international women’s volleyball tournament. Team USA dropped a five-set thriller to 2016 Olympic Games host Brazil in the gold-medal match, breaking the Americans’ nine-match win streak that included two wins over second-ranked China and a win over fourth-ranked Russia. The U.S. has now reached the medal podium in eight straight tournaments.\n\nLast year the Americans won the 2015 FIVB World Grand Prix in Omaha, Nebraska, along with the 2015 Pan American Games, 2015 Pan American Cup, the 2015 NORCECA Championship. Team USA extended their tournament success earlier this year by capturing the 2016 NORCECA Olympic Qualification Tournament. Team USA’s only non-gold tournament since the end of 2014 was a third-place finish at the 2015 FIVB World Cup.\n\nPrior to winning the 2014 World Championship, Team USA failed to qualify for the 2014 FIVB World Grand Prix Finals week just a few weeks earlier, and that has been a turning point for the Americans in the Olympic quadrennial.\n\n“We certainly want to respond to adversity with strength and resolve,” Kiraly said. “The 2014 FIVB World Grand Prix, where we failed to qualify for the Finals Week, was a big disappointment, one of our low points. But I think that disappointment and adversity spurred us on – gave us the imperative and incentive to be better and we mounted a nice response to that in terms of the 2014 World Championship. We also had a disappointing World Cup last year. We know we were capable of finishing higher than we did. And so we are trying to use that adversity and that disappointment to make us better this year.”\n\nKiraly said that the finish at World Cup, which served as the first Olympic qualifier held in September 2015, actually turned into an advantage for Team USA in peaking for 2016.\n\n“We didn’t plan it this way, but we got more time together by not qualifying at the World Cup,” Kiraly said. “We got an extra week and a half of training, and the great privilege of playing to qualify for the Olympics in Lincoln, Nebraska, in front of a crowd of 10,000-plus against Dominican Republic on Jan. 9 and locking in our Olympic berth. We turned that extra time into an advantage – it got us off to a better and faster start when we resumed training in May.”\n\nTeam USA Schedule in Rio\n\nAs for the Olympic Games schedule, Team USA opens Pool B action on Aug. 6 versus NORCECA rival Puerto Rico at 4:05 p.m. local time, followed by the Netherlands on Aug. 8 at 2 p.m. The Americans challenge Serbia on Aug. 10 and Italy on Aug. 12 with both matches at 2 p.m. The U.S. concludes pool play against second-ranked China on Aug. 14 at 4:05 p.m.\n\nThe top four teams in the two Olympic Games pools advance to the quarterfinals on Aug. 16. The top seed in each pool will face the fourth seed in crossover competition, while a drawing of lots will determine crossover quarterfinal opponents for the second- and third-place teams in both pools. The winners of the quarterfinal matches advance to the semifinal medal round on Aug. 18. The tournament concludes on Aug. 20 with the gold- and bronze-medal matches.\n\nThe U.S. Women, who have won silver in the past two Olympic Games and the bronze at the 1992 Olympic Games, have earned Olympic qualification in 10 of 12 Olympics since the sport’s introduction to the schedule in 1964.\n\nAll athlete and staff nominations to the 2016 U.S. Olympic Team are subject to approval by the United States Olympic Committee.\n\nFun Notes on the Roster:\n\nKarch Kiraly is attempting to become the first person to win Olympic gold as a volleyball player and volleyball coach. He and China’s women’s head coach Lang Ping are both striving for this honor in 2016.\n\nAll but Karsta Lowe and Carli Lloyd were part of the 2014 FIVB World Championship team that won gold, the program’s first-ever in the 62-year history of the event.\n\nThe 12-player roster has representation from 10 different states (California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington). Only California and Illinois have multiple players on the roster.\n\nThe roster has three players from the University of Nebraska (Kayla Banwarth, Jordan Larson and Kelsey Robinson) and two players from Penn State University (Christa Dietzen and Alisha Glass). Other colleges represented on the roster are University of Washington (Courtney Thompson), University of Texas (Rachael Adams), University of California-Berkeley (Carli Lloyd), University of Florida (Kelly Murphy), Pepperdine University (Kim Hill), Stanford University (Foluke Akinradewo) and UCLA (Karsta Lowe).\n\nFive of the 12 players have first names starting with “K”, along with head coach Karch Kiraly.\n\nNo you are not seeing double or thinking Carli Lloyd has switched sports. The Carli Lloyd that made the U.S. Olympic Women’s Volleyball Team is not the same one from soccer fame who earned FIFA World Player of the Year in 2015.\n\nAlisha Glass, Kayla Banwarth and Carli Lloyd were all part of the U.S. Women’s National Team in the last quad, but were not selected to the 2012 Olympics.\n\n2016 U.S. Olympic Women’s Volleyball Team\n\n# – Name (Position, Height, Hometown, College)\n\n1 – Alisha Glass (S, 6-0, Leland, Michigan, Penn State University)\n\n2 – Kayla Banwarth (L, 5-10, Dubuque, Iowa, University of Nebraska)\n\n3 – Courtney Thompson (S, 5-8, Kent, Washington, University of Washington)\n\n5 – Rachael Adams (M, 6-2, Cincinnati, Ohio, University of Texas)\n\n6 – Carli Lloyd (S, 5-11, Bonsall, California, University of California-Berkeley)\n\n10 – Jordan Larson (OH, 6-2, Hooper, Nebraska, University of Nebraska)\n\n12 – Kelly Murphy (OPP, 6-2, Wilmington, Illinois, University of Florida)\n\n13 – Christa Dietzen (M, 6-2, Hopewell Township, Pennsylvania, Penn State University)\n\n15 – Kim Hill (OH, 6-4, Portland, Oregon, Pepperdine University)\n\n16 – Foluke Akinradewo (M, 6-3, Plantation, Florida, Stanford University)\n\n23 – Kelsey Robinson (OH, 6-2, Bartlett, Illinois, University of Nebraska)\n\n25 – Karsta Lowe (OPP, 6-4, Rancho Santa Fe, California, UCLA)\n\nHead Coach: Karch Kiraly\n\nAssistant Coaches: Jamie Morrison, Tom Black, David Hunt\n\nTechnical Coordinator: Joe Trinsey\n\nScout Coaches: Marv Dunphy, JJ Van Niel\n\nTherapist/Trainer: Jill Wosmek\n\nElite Performance Psychologist: Dr. Michael Gervais\n\nDoctor: Dr. Andrew Gregory\n\nStrength Coach: James Stitz\n\nTeam Manager: Denise Sheldon\n\nTeam Journalist: Bill Kauffman\n\nATHLETE QUICK SETS\n\nRachael Adams (Middle, Cincinnati, Ohio): Rachael Adams, a first-time Olympian, was a member of the 2014 FIVB World Championship gold-medal team as she started four of 13 matches.
