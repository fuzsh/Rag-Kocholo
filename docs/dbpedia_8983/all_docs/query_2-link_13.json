        "text": "By Scott DeCamp | sdecamp1@mlive.com\n\nOne of the best aspects of sports is reminiscing about legendary games and all-time athletes.\n\nWho doesn’t enjoy a good debate over the best teams and players?\n\nAlong those lines, MLive tackled a whale of a sports project. We dug deep, scouring record books and historical info to find answers to the following question: Who is the most prominent athlete from each of Michigan’s 83 counties?\n\nFor criteria, we considered athletes who were born and/or raised in Michigan. They could have been born in the late-1800s or starred more recently.\n\nSome are or were mega-stars on a worldwide scale, while others fit the hometown hero description.\n\nYou’ll probably recognize most of these names, but with others, you’ll learn something new.\n\nIdentifying the most prominent athlete from each county is a rather subjective exercise. Do you agree with these selections? Disagree with some? We would love to see you in the comment section, where it can be discussed.\n\nChances are, we’ve missed the mark on some counties, but that’s OK. Let the great debate begin.\n\nKiki Cuyler, Chicago Cubs outfielder, is shown in posed action Sept. 22, 1932. (Associated Press file)\n\nAlcona County: Hazen Shirley \"Kiki\" Cuyler\n\nHazen Shirley \"Kiki\" Cuyler (his nickname rhymes with \"sky-sky\") was one of Major League Baseball's greatest hitters, according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame website. He was elected into the Hall of Fame in 1968, 18 years after he died of a heart attack. Cuyler helped the Pittsburgh Pirates win the World Series in 1925, but the right fielder's primary team during his 17-year career was the Chicago Cubs. He also played for the Cincinnati Reds and Brooklyn Dodgers, and later he coached with the Cubs and Boston Red Sox. Cuyler was born in Harrisville, Mich., on Aug. 30, 1898. The Ki Cuyler Sports Bar & Grill in Harrisville opened in the mid-1970s in his honor.\n\nBrock Strom is shown during his days on the U.S. Air Force Academy football team.

(Mike Mulholland | MLive.com file)\n\nAllegan County: Kirk Cousins\n\nKirk Cousins was born in a Chicago suburb and spent his early years there before his family moved to Holland, a city that straddles Allegan and Ottawa counties. His Holland Christian alma mater, as well as Cousins' home he lived in during his middle school and high school days, is located in northern-most Allegan County. Cousins was an under-the-radar quarterback recruit, who flourished at Michigan State and is now thriving in the NFL with the Washington Redskins. He was a fourth-round draft pick of the Redskins in 2012. Under the franchise tag, Cousins has been the Redskins' starting QB the past two seasons, when he's totaled more than 9,000 passing yards with 54 touchdowns and 23 interceptions. He's putting his name all over the Redskins record book. He's become a household name, but will Washington want to pay him long term?\n\nPittsburgh Pirates' Kevin Young hits a game-winning home run off Milwaukee Brewers starter Hideo Nomo on Sept. 30, 1999, in Milwaukee.
