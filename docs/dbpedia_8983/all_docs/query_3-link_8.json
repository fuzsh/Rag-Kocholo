Can't say this is a gigantic surprise, but still, it's significant. I remember how floored I was watching her set in college. Shes gone on todo so many great things. Congratulations and best wishes, and buon viaggio.\n\nPost by tnp101 on\n\nGlass Retires\n\nEnglish translation of Italian article from Google Translate:\n\nUNITED STATES - I closed the Rio2016 Games with the bronze medal, which followed the Scudetto with the shirt dell'Imoco Conegliano, the USA Alisha Glass director has announced his retirement to volleyball.\n\nAmong the reasons of farewell their desire to accompany her boyfriend, Josh Childress, basketball player and the \"will to live a normal life\".\n\nThat's the Stanford connection. Josh Childress is former Stanford basketball player.\n\nPost by sunsuphornsup on\n\nThis is kind of sad. How do you retire from a sport you've literally played your entire like. I wonder how hard of a decision it was for her?\n\nPost by BuckysHeat on\n\nInteresting how just 4 days ago she said she was going to take some time off but was not retiring\n\nwww.record-eagle.com/sports/local_sports/local-volleyball-star-returns-from-rio/article_d9a07a1b-d592-57f8-b274-522a176cda08.html\n\nThe Leland native said she won’t use the term “retire,” because that’s too permanent.\n\n“I’m not going overseas anymore, and I’m putting everything on hold,” Glass said.\n\nPost by Wiswell on\n\nIs it possible that Google translate is more literally translating, than by intent? Internet translating stinks, s perhaps she is just taking a break.\n\nFor example, in Spanish aDios is goodbye. Sure, that could be interpreted as retirement.\n\nPost by volleyfan24 on\n\nI have been one of her toughest critics at times but she did an amazing job. An elite setter and a great defender. It will be weird not seeing Glass set for the red, white and blue. This makes sense though. Starting a family is in the books for her maybe she will make a return to the game later. Only one Olympics though this seems premature. I wish she would stay on. I wish her and her family the best going forward though.\n\nPost by BuckysHeat on\n\nIs it possible that Google translate is more literally translating, than by intent?

Sure, that could be interpreted as retirement.\n\nAgreed with the google translate, it makes most other languages sound like a child is speaking and I was wondering the same thing about her actual intent given her other statements about just taking time off\n\nPost by HappyVolley on\n\nFor some reason, Google Translate does not translate Italian > English very well. It does much better with other languages, such as German and Russian.\n\nPost by Wolfgang on\n\nGlass Retires\n\nEnglish translation of Italian article from Google Translate:\n\nUNITED STATES - I closed the Rio2016 Games with the bronze medal, which followed the Scudetto with the shirt dell'Imoco Conegliano, the USA Alisha Glass director has announced his retirement to volleyball.\n\nAmong the reasons of farewell their desire to accompany her boyfriend, Josh Childress, basketball player and the \"will to live a normal life\".\n\nThat's the Stanford connection. Josh Childress is former Stanford basketball player.\n\nWhat Stanford connection? Alisha Glass played at Penn State.\n\nLooking over their respective bios in Wikipedia, can't figure out where and how they met. I guess these days, you can meet in cyberspace via Twitter, Facebook, reddit, or Instagram and just text \"Yo, want to hang out later?\"\n\nBTW, I had Josh Childress on my team in my NBA2k franchise and I could NEVER figure out his jump shot release point. He had such an idiosyncratic technique.\n\nPost by Sbilo on\n\nSurprised by this decision...but I wish her well in her future plans.\n\nIs this gonna hurt Team USA leading up to Tokyo? I think we have around 4 very capable setters who can get the job done. Lloyd will be a frontrunner in that starting spot, with Kreklow, Hancock and Carlini."
