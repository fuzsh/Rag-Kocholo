        "text": "Some were the stars of their college sports teams, some became Olympians, chose to focus on other things. Northern Michigan’s former standout high school athletes have taken a multitude of paths over the years. In this week’s Northern Express, sister publication to the Leelanau Ticker, we tracked down seven of the North’s greatest athletes —including Leland’s Alisha Glass — to find out what their lives look like today.\n\nAlisha Glass (now Alisha Glass Childress) made a name for herself as one the greatest high school volleyball players in Michigan history during her time at Leland High School. Coached by her mother (Laurie Glass, still Leland’s head volleyball coach), Glass earned first-team all-state honors during each of her four high school seasons, setting both state and national high school records for season aces (296), career aces (937), and career kills (3,584). In 2006, she led Leland to a Class D state championship and earned major individual accolades, such as being named the state of Michigan’s “Miss Volleyball” and winning the Michigan Gatorade High School Player title for volleyball."
