        "text": "The Vegas Thrill ownership group includes a mix of four local and national business leaders and sports enthusiasts. The group is led by local political leader Andy Abboud, an executive for Las Vegas Sands, and former Nebraska Attorney General and Founder and Managing Partner of the nationally acclaimed Bruning Law Group, Jon Bruning. Abboud and Bruning now partner with the Foley Entertainment Group (FEG), who operates the city’s beloved Vegas Golden Knights and the Henderson Silver Knights, and City+Ventures, a national investment and business acceleration organization who is investing in women’s professional volleyball in the United States.\n\n“We are excited to join the group bringing the Vegas Thrill and the Pro Volleyball Federation to The Dollar Loan Center,” said Foley Entertainment Group President and CEO Kerry Bubolz. “This perfectly fits our commitment to give families in Henderson and the Las Vegas Valley access to a variety of exciting sports in our state-of-the-art arena, and we are especially proud to add a women’s team to the FEG portfolio and our venue.”\n\nDanny White, Co-founder of City+Ventures, said, “Partnering with the Foley Entertainment Group and having the support of iconic Vegas-born teams like the Vegas Golden Knights shows incredible support of these athletes in bringing the very best of professional volleyball to Vegas and to fans throughout the United States. My business partners, Kirk Thompson and Chris Erickson, have seen first-hand how Vegas does pro sports and fans are in for a real thrill.”\n\nLed by an all-star leadership team including Head Coach Fran Flory, Analyst and Consultant Russ Rose, volleyball veteran and Vegas Thrill President Ruben Herrera, and first official franchise player Alisha Glass Childress, the powerhouse lineup immersed themselves into the community with a special unveiling event at The Dollar Loan Center Arena.\n\nHerrera said, “This is a historic moment for Vegas, for volleyball, and for women’s history. It’s an honor to build a world-class franchise for Las Vegas. Being built from the ground up right here in Vegas gives us a special edge that fans will love. I believe we are destined for greatness thanks to the support of our ownership group, city officials, executive team, head coach, and of course, our devoted players and fans.”\n\nSeason memberships are available now with a $100 deposit for tickets ranging from $29 to $114 per match for 12 home contests. Full season and half season VIP membership will be available as well. Single match tickets will be on sale January 2 and available on VegasThrill.com.\n\nPro Volleyball Federation CEO Jen Spicher said, “We are so excited to have Las Vegas as our seventh and final city joining Pro Volleyball Federation for our inaugural season. In just 58 days we will have our first serve and we know that Vegas, with their overwhelming support of sports in general and women’s sports in particular, is the exact right place for REAL PRO VOLLEYBALL.”\n\nTo show support for the initial lineup of National Champions, All-America athletes, Olympians and many more, those in attendance included community visionaries such as Henderson Mayor Michelle Romero, Pro Volleyball Federation co-founder Dave Whinham, community and business leaders, and members of the ownership group.\n\nMayor Romero shared, “We are excited to welcome the Vegas Thrill as the fourth hometown team to play in Henderson. Our residents enjoy the diverse sports and entertainment options at the DLC and we look forward to our continued partnership with Foley Entertainment Group and the Golden Knights Organization.”\n\nTo date, six world-class, internationally known professional players have been signed to the Vegas Thrill, ahead of their first Pro Volleyball Federation match on Feb. 7 playing the Omaha Supernovas in Omaha, Nebraska. The current roster includes Kayla Banwarth, Layne Van Buskirk, Alisha Glass Childress, Saskia Hippe, Molly McCage, and Berkeley Oblad.\n\nSpeaking to the Vegas Thrill roster, Flory added, “I’ve been dubbed the winningest coach in LSU’s volleyball program history, so to take my career to this level of pristine professionalism was a natural step alongside the most talented players in women’s volleyball. I’m already so proud of our potential this season and we look forward to success as we take the court for the first time in February 2024.”\n\nThe Vegas Thrill is one of seven U.S. teams for the inaugural Pro Volleyball Federation season in 2024, while Dallas and Kansas City have been announced as 2025 expansion teams. In 2024, the Vegas Thrill will play 24 matches to include 12 at home and 12 on the road in the regular season. Overall, the League will be showcased in three different time zones in the United States in season one. Pro Volleyball Federation matches will take place on 67 different dates between January and May 2024 as opponents will be competing every day of the week.\n\nFollowing the regular season, the Vegas Thrill are aiming to be one of the top four squads in the standings that will compete for the Pro Volleyball Federation Championship in May. The location of the championship will be determined and announced at a later date.\n\nTo secure your best season membership seats, see the team’s full schedule, and to stay up to date on the latest news, please visit VegasThrill.com and follow the team on social media.\n\nABOUT VEGAS THRILL\n\nFrom the city that never sleeps, known for its high energy and even higher stakes, Vegas Thrill embodies the spirit of Las Vegas as its new generation of professional athletes and world-class entertainment.
