        "text": "lookingglass\n\nThrough the \"Looking Glass,\" readers are invited to dig deeper into our issues as contributors share reflections on their work. Specifically, \"Looking Glass\" provides a sort of parlor where authors and artists reveal the genesis of their pieces, as well as provide meta-discursive insight into their textual and visual creative works.\n\nIssue 28 Reflections\n\nRead on for reflections by select authors and artists\n\non the genesis and craft of their pieces in Glassworks\n\n​and then read the full issue online!\n\nSarah Harley​\n\n​\"Have You Got the Moon Safe\"\n\nK Anand Gall\n\n​\"Nuisance Bleeding\"\n\nKatie Hughbanks\n\n​\"Dream Flowers, Water Needles\"\n\nI bought an underwater camera last year, and it changed my photography. Before that little Olympus, I was taking photos; today, I am making art. My photography dances with an exploration of light, air, and water. Those three elements, so necessary for living, are now necessary for my creative life. Light, to me, is like a violinist’s sheet music; air, like a painter’s canvas. To me, water is a sculptor’s block of marble. My camera is the potter’s clay. Both \"Dream Flowers\" and \"Water Needles\" reflect the beauty of these basic elements in the natural world. The two photos are inverses-one is taken in fresh air, with water droplets catching light, and the other is taken underwater, with air bubbles shining in light.\n\n​\n\nEvery day, photography offers me new eyes with which to see and a new way to express my love for the world. What a joy it is to learn, to develop, to share beauty with others while celebrating light, air, and water as life forces.\n\nAngela Townsend\n\n​\"Gold-Plated\"\n\n“Gold-Plated” was the overflow of my heart from an unexpected friendship. When I ordered a Lucite block so I could hold my name in my own hands, I never imagined the volley of delight that would ensue. Across eight thousand kilometers and twelve Etsy orders, the artist Salih became my friend and my co-conspirator in delivering delight. I think of him each time I learn someone’s name. I want to bear witness to the light between the letters, etching magnolias on every monogram. I never want to miss the opportunity to speak someone’s loveliness. Salih reminds me that our names are sacred syllables. I am forever grateful to my joyous, wise friend.\n\nAlisha Brown\n\n​\"Lessons from a whippet on a springtime walk, Andalucía en octubre​\"\n\nCory Firestine\n\n​\"Reaching Corals, Cascade, Paisley\"\n\nFor me, my artistry is a way to still and stabilize my mind while struggling with mental illness, and as the paint flows and shifts, my mind becomes quiet, so my artworks are direct representations of pushing all of the voices and feelings inside my mind out onto the canvas, where the chaos transforms into beautiful, emotional imagery, leaving the mind silent and content, for a time.\n\nWhile \"Reaching Corals,\" \"Cascade,\" and \"Paisley\" were created using various techniques, they all encompass a specific theme that all of my paintings do, and that is movement and energy. Specifically, it is about the movement of the paint across the canvas, and how manipulating it in different ways, with different techniques, using different tools, there is generally some movement that occurs to create the patterns that you see.\n\n\"Reaching Corals\" depicts just that, two opposite pieces of coral reaching across a black plane, though never fully touching. \"Cascade\" is about what lies beneath the surface, waiting to be exposed to the light. And \"Paisley\" shows twists and swirls that move together in a dance of color.\n\nWith the artworks embodying movement and energy, they present visual representations of another, particular aspect of my life—living with chronic pain. I suffer from fibromyalgia, and the daily pain and mobility issues I experience due to this disorder affect various aspects of my life and permeate everything I do and experience. The purpose of creating these works is to show I still have the ability to facilitate and capture movement and energy on the canvas, while my body is often stiff, numb, and in pain, so physical movement is limited."
