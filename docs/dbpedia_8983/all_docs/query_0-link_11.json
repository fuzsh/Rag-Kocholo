        "text": "Alisha is also one of the worlds best volleyball players. I could go on for pages with her accomplishments, but here are some important highlights…\n\nThree consecutive NCAA championships at Penn State and an All American in 2008-2009. Repeated as Female Indoor Player of the year 2013-2014. Named best setter at the World Championships where she lead the US team to their first ever Gold Medal. Stayed in Italy this season to compete in the top Italian Professional League.\n\nThings are going pretty well for Alisha Glass. As busy as she is, She took the time to join her teammates in answering our “Five Questions”. Thanks Alisha!!!\n\nAlisha Glass\n\nCurrent Team- Imoco Volley Conegliano\n\nCollege-Penn State\n\nMajor-Kinesiology\n\nWhat a thrilling ending to a productive summer of tournaments and workouts in the USA National Team gym! When the dust settled in Milan, and the immediate celebrations slowed down, was there someone who you wished were there to share in your achievement?\n\nI wished that my whole family could have been there to celebrate, especially my mom. She's my biggest fan, my most valued supported, she supports me no matter what and I wouldn't be able accomplish any of it without her.\n\nDown the stretch in Italy Coach Kiraly used the double-sub more and more. Do you see this as something more teams will start to employ and what adjustments does this force opposing teams to make?\n\nI think we have a great system, our double-sub does an amazing job of impacting the game during the time they come in, and they can turn the tide with those 3 rotations. They bring an energy that the team needs and it was so valuable in the World Championships. It's not easy, just because you double sub doesn't always mean you'll have an advantage, you need the right people to get the job done. Other teams have to defend against another 3 hitter rotation, they often have to then attack against a stronger blocker, it also allows the players that come out to save some energy and refocus and be better for when they re-enter.\n\nDuring timeouts it looks like you and Courtney Thompson have your own huddle. What ideas do you exchange and what are you looking for watching from the bench during the rotations Courtney is setting?\n\nWe're trying to have the most amount of information possible. We both have feelings about how things are going during the match when we're on the court, like what the blockers are doing, what's successful, what's not as successful. Those feelings can sometimes be spot on, and sometimes you need the outsider's perspective to help you make adjustments that will help the team. We look out for each other and we support each other, it's just how it should be!\n\nYou have been in Italy for a while now and you will be spending a lot more time there. What is your favorite thing about Italy and are you able to speak any Italian?\n\nI like the history, they have buildings that are older than our country. I also like that it is split into regions and that each region has a food specialty that they are famous for, so it's great to be able to travel and see and eat new things!! I'm understanding more and more Italian from being here and I'm working on the speaking part!!\n\nIt has to seem like a dream at times, being in your position. When did you first get the idea that being part of the National Team Program was possible, and looking back who was the most impactful person in your journey?\n\nWhen you're a kid, you dream big. You find what you like (volleyball for me) and you figure out what the most amazing accomplishment would be in that field (the Olympics) and then if you really decided to go after it, you have find the path that will take you there (the National team). I'm going to go on and on about my mother again but she was the one who introduced me to the sport, she's a coach, and she also did an amazing job challenging and questioning me along the way. Is this really what you want? Are you putting in the work in order for you to get where you want to go? She held me to my answers and made sure I stayed on my path. She showed me it was possible.\n\nBonus Question:"
