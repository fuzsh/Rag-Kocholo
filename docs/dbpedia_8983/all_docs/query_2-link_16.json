        "text": "I think about my life in the pandemic era from a number of different vantage points. As a New Yorker, I still take a moment at 7 p.m. to reflect on how we cheered our essential workers last spring, a bright memory in an otherwise dark year. As a business owner who has led my skin-care company, Peach & Lily, through difficult and uncertain times, I’m proud of my team for rising to the challenge and emerging stronger than before. As an almost first-time mom, I consider how a pandemic pregnancy is inconvenient on good days and isolating on bad ones, while also appreciating that remote work means more time to prepare for this life-changing event.\n\nBut as an Asian American, the only thing I can think about right now is why I’m afraid to leave my apartment.\n\nViolent hate crimes against the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community have been dramatically rising over the last year. Our most vulnerable—the elderly, women, and children—are being targeted. Just over the past week in New York City, an elderly man was bloodied on the subway, and another punched in the face on the Lower East Side; a woman was thrown to the ground in Midtown, another was hit in the face with a metal pipe on the Lower East Side, and a third was punched repeatedly after attending a protest against Asian hate with her daughter in Union Square. On Monday, a 65-year-old woman was kicked and stomped on the sidewalk a block from the apartment I left at the end of January. These attacks echo many others in New York and across the country, including the devastating shootings in Atlanta which left eight dead, including six Asian women.\n\nAccording to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, anti-Asian hate crimes increased by 149% from 2019 to 2020, while StopAAPIHate.org has catalogued more than 3,800 racist incidents since March 2020, a shocking number that the organization also describes as “massively underreported.” But let’s be clear: Anti-Asian racism and violence isn’t new. It emerged in the 1800s, when large numbers of Asian immigrants first started to arrive in the U.S., and it sadly persists today. Asian Americans continue to face racist aggressions and microaggressions. I can’t tell you how many times I have been accosted and harassed with racial slurs, or made to feel like a foreigner in my own country. Since the pandemic began last March, accompanied by racist descriptions like “Kung Flu,” the floodgates of hate and violence have opened even wider. For the first time after decades of living in New York, I’m afraid to go outside alone. I’m Korean, a woman, and a target.\n\nFor most Americans, citizenship is a default setting, delivered at birth. Only a small number of citizens—primarily judges, elected officials, military, and law enforcement personnel—must proactively swear an oath to the Constitution of the United States. This group currently constitutes about 1% of the total population of America, roughly 3 million people. But there is another, larger group—about 20 million people in total—that is required to swear this same oath, to actively commit to being an American: naturalized citizens.\n\nI became a naturalized citizen in my 20s. I remember the day I swore my own oath: to renounce my allegiance to Korea, to support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States; to bear arms on behalf of the United States when required; to perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required; to perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required.\n\nMy first language is Korean. I dream in Korean. My birth name, Jee Hae, is Korean. In taking that oath, I was, in effect, turning away from the land of my birth and my youth, the home of my parents, my grandparents, and my entire extended family. But America is my country now. And not just for the fun stuff. I made a commitment—a solemn vow—to support and defend the Constitution, to fight for the United States if called upon. I also made a commitment, like so many other immigrants, naturalized or not, to work hard to build a life here, to contribute to society and to the economy. I started my business here. I continue to create jobs here. I was married here. I belong here. This is my home.\n\nBut home—for me, and for so many other Asians—doesn’t feel safe anymore, and over the past few weeks, my conversations with others in the AAPI community have evolved. While we continue to fight for awareness to drive real change and action around the epidemic of violence against Asians, these days we also spend time talking about “tactics”—the practical and often maddening contortions we must contemplate to protect ourselves. Should I try to disguise myself? Who can I ask to escort me to the grocery store? What can I carry to defend myself? How can I help protect others?\n\nWe are also struggling to manage our own sense of isolation, anger, and despair. After a tragic year, with so much death and suffering from the pandemic, many non-Asians are looking forward to vaccines, spring, and a return to life as usual. But for many Asians, our quarantine continues, alongside a daily drumbeat of brutal hate crimes against our community. As I count down the weeks to my due date, I’m confronting a reality I never could have imagined: Is it safe for my parents to visit their grandson? Will it be possible for me to take him for a walk in the park? My Korean face puts my little boy in danger. In New York City. In America.\n\nThe roots of hate and racism will not disappear overnight. But there are steps we can all take to help stop Asian hate. Words matter. Racist rhetoric that baselessly scapegoats the AAPI community for the coronavirus pandemic is dangerous and must be rejected. Support matters. Reach out to your AAPI coworkers, employees, and friends. They are not okay right now. And if you witness an attack of any kind, please help. A crushing part of anti-Asian hate crimes is that many bystanders do not stand up for the victims, while silence after such attacks reinforces the isolation and fear felt by so many Asians in this country—and signals that this kind of intimidation and violence is acceptable here. Bystander intervention trainings can be accessed quickly and easily online, and are great tools for learning how to safely intervene and support a victim of an anti-Asian attack. Donations matter. If you are able, consider contributing to the Stop Asian Hate master fund, which allocates money to vetted grassroots organizations across the country working to track and prevent anti-Asian hate crimes and support victims.\n\nMuch like the deadly virus that has gripped the world over the last year, the contagion of hate can take root quickly and viciously. But looking out for our neighbors—all of our neighbors—can help stop its spread."
