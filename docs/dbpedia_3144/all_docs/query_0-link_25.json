        "text": "John Rae was one of the most charismatic and controversial figures in British education. His reputation as a great reformer was forged during his 16 years as headmaster of Westminster School, from 1970 to 1986. Outspoken, humane, approachable and always on the side of his students, he recorded those turbulent times in handwritten diaries that seem as fresh and relevant today.\n\nThe diaries, which he finished editing just before he died, aged 75, in 2006, chart his unending struggle to keep out illegal drugs and the impact of family breakdown on pupils. Devious, rank-pulling parents are humorously dispatched. Dirty tricks by other schools exposed – though Rae was not above wheeler-dealing himself to preserve Westminster's ranking in the educational elite.\n\nThough he believed in the right of parents to educate their children privately, he was also a sharp critic of the public school establishment. His advice to his six children – \"Say what you believe and head up high\" – was also his lifelong personal code.\n\nAfter lunch, I see the parents of a sixth-former who has received very bad reports. They blame the school because they saw their son pass the entrance exam and start at Westminster with such bright-eyed enthusiasm, only to drift away into a non-academic, guitar-playing world. I suspect the truth is rather different. They sent their son to a tutor to get him up to the standard of the entrance exam, and this private intense tuition produced an illusion of ability that soon faded once these special circumstances were withdrawn. Subsequently, the boy has been out of his depth.\n\nA housemaster catches me in break to tell me that one of his boys is missing. We are both concerned because the boy, though senior, has been under psychiatric care and is neither happy nor stable. Chair an inconclusive common-room meeting on how we can improve our sporting arrangements. After the meeting, the housemaster follows me upstairs to say that his missing boy has been found dead in his father's flat; he has gassed himself. Both his parents are abroad. The curious fact emerges later that the boy left a completed essay on the table; it was due to be handed in today. Later, I go out into Yard and meet one of the dead boy's friends and we talk in the darkness.\n\nAllan Sillitoe [author of Saturday Night and Sunday Morning and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner] and his wife come to see the school as prospective parents. Twelve years ago, when he won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, my novel The Custard Boys was the runner-up. His wife does the talking but he is the interesting one; he is quiet, thoughtful and rather diffident. He does not apologise for thinking of private education (as the protagonists in his novels would have done) but takes it all in his stride.\n\nThe dean of Christ Church telephones to say that X has not done well enough in his history papers to be offered a place but the college like him and are anxious to do well by him, especially in a year when we have sent them such a good crop of candidates. Would X be willing to read geography instead? On X's behalf I say yes, and the dean promises to consult his geographers. Just as well Roy Hattersley does not overhear this conversation.\n\nI have arranged to see the two drug boys this morning. The older boy comes looking as though he has smoked pot on the way here. He is in a school suit, no doubt at mother's insistence, and denies ever bringing cannabis into the school. The younger boy comes with his mother. He, too, denies everything but eventually says that the older boy did on several occasions provide a joint to smoke in a café behind Church House. I shall have to see both boys again to establish the truth, but how discouraging the whole business is.\n\nAt noon, I see the older of the two boys, this time with housemaster and parents. It is a difficult session. The housemaster and I suspect he has brought cannabis into the school. He continues to deny this. His parents are confused. Mother argues that their son is a typical adolescent, concerned about \"the starving in India\", and that drugs are part of his rebellion against society. It is pretty corny and old hat. I say I think their son is lying. They say that he may do many things wrong but he never tells them a lie. How blind parents are to believe in the truthfulness of their children.\n\nThe mother of the older boy involved with drugs telephones; her son admits bringing cannabis into the school and \"sharing it\" with the younger boy. I thank her. I decide that both boys should not be allowed to return to the school next term. Their involvement with illegal drugs is neither passing nor experimental and they must pose a threat to other boys.\n\nI interview the daughter of a Labour MP who has been an outspoken opponent of private education. He has written asking whether we can take her into the A-level year. I have met him once or twice. The daughter is sensible and serious about wanting to come, and the other master who interviews her agrees that we offer her a place. We might also persuade the father to modify his views.\n\nThis afternoon, I see the senior scholar suspected of stealing books. After a long and unhappy interview, he admits to the office, though insisting that the total value of the books is \"only £50\". I tell him he may no longer be a member of college and must spend the rest of term living at home. It is, of course, no great punishment and he is lucky that the bookshops are not interested in prosecuting. His attitude to the stealing appears to be amoral: it gave him intellectual and emotional satisfaction. He is an only child and highly intelligent. Where shall we look for the origin and nurturing of his crime?\n\nAttend Abbey matins with the scholars. It is a dismal service that provokes me to anger. What is the point of it all? The choir perform, the congregation cannot join in, the sermon is tedious. Why is the Abbey so unaware of this? Play fives afterwards to get the service out of my system. This evening a housemaster rings to say he has found evidence that a senior boy has been smoking cannabis in his study. Boy is a difficult case and has my sympathy. Father died while living with another woman. Mother has remarried, has attempted suicide and now lives abroad. I shall have to rusticate the boy because if I do not, the gossip in Hampstead and Dulwich will be that Westminster has abandoned its hard line on drugs. But where can he go? His guardian lives in Kent and will be none too keen to have him for two weeks.\n\nThe economic crisis deepens and seems to cast a gloom over the common room. A father telephones to say that his 17-year-old son refuses to obey him and insists on spending the night with his girlfriend. Father wants me to say that if the boy does this he will be expelled but I point out that whatever my views on the boy's behaviour I cannot possibly threaten him with expulsion. At the weekend, the boy is his parents' responsibility.\n\nIn break, I see boys whose excellent work has earned them a 'digniora', that is, a piece of Maundy money, a supply of which is kept in my study. One boy, Tom Holt [later a prolific author of humorous fantasy novels], tells me he has just finished his first novel and is rewriting the early chapters in the light of his greater maturity. He was 14 last month.\n\nTo the Dorchester as the guest of Westminster parents at a Greek charity ball. A fellow guest is the Reverend John Kelly, principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and a former vice-chancellor of the university. We seldom send boys to St Edmund Hall, but while other members of the party are noisily Greek dancing, John Kelly leans across the table and offers me a deal. If we will send a Westminster scholar to the college, he will persuade the tutors to admit some of our borderline cases. I promise to think it over.\n\nTo Winchester for an unpublicised meeting of eight major public schools: Eton, Winchester, Westminster, Harrow, Rubgy, Charterhouse, Shrewsbury and Marlborough. We dine in the warden's lodgings and before and after dinner we talk about the threats to the future of our schools at a time of rising fees, falling numbers and political hostility. We agree that whatever happens, we eight will act in concert. The unspoken agenda is that our schools must survive even if other independent schools go to the wall.\n\nI drop a note to Richard Woollett, the housemaster of Busby's. He has written me a rather emotional letter about the school monitor in his house whom I have just demoted. Richard runs a freer, less hierarchical house than the other housemasters, which makes him feel vulnerable to the sniping of more senior colleagues, and the demotion of a school monitor will, he fears, be seized on by his critics. I reassure him of my confidence in him but take the opportunity to tell him that \"less hierarchy\" must not mean less respect for school regulations.\n\nAt 5.30pm, a stranger comes to ask me to take back a boy whose father owes us a year's fees. The stranger is a smooth, unpleasant man who manages to convey the impression that Westminster comes out of this affair with little credit. I am sorry for the boy but we cannot allow him to come back unless the father is prepared to pay.\n\nIsaiah Berlin talks to the John Locke Society about \"The Russian obsession with patterns in history\". It is a wonderful talk, lifting the spirit by its humanity, range and sheer intellectual brilliance. He draws a crowded meeting and holds his audience for 50 minutes non-stop. Over lunch in College Hall, scholars do their best to quiz him and it is good to hear them. To put boys and girls in touch with a great mind and to give them the opportunity to test their fledgling intellect on his is an essential part of learning, but in how many schools, in how many universities, for that matter, is this possible?\n\nA housemaster reports that a 15-year-old has brought a bottle of Valium tablets to the house and given another boy three on a \"close your eyes and open your mouth\" basis. I do not have time to deal with this as I must attend a press conference at which the annual statistics for independent schools are published. Overall numbers in independent schools have risen but the press do not notice that this is because schools have filled empty beds with pupils from the Far East, and seem determined to write about a \"public school boom\". Back to Westminster to see the parents of the boy who was playing fast and loose with Valium. We get nowhere. Neither parents nor I are sure how to respond to this behaviour. I say they should take him home for a day or two.\n\nLunch at Brooks's, with a parent whose son is taking A-level. He is a QC and his approach to his son's education is that contacts matter as well as qualifications. He tells me that he made a useful contact with the senior tutor of Pembroke College, Oxford, when they were both guests of a merchant banker at Newmarket racecourse, and arranged for his son to visit the college. He now wants to make sure that I will be contacting the senior tutor on his son's behalf. So his son's future is planned between races at Newmarket and over lunch at Brooks's.\n\nA housemaster comes to tell me that he has received an unpleasant, anonymous letter. As this is one of the hazards of a schoolmaster's life, it is worth quoting: \"I hate you and I want you to know I am not alone in that feeling. Learn how to treat people and maybe there won't be so many people around who hate you. I'd like to cause you as much pain as you have caused others, maybe I'll get the chance one day.\"\n\nThe housemaster says suspicions falls on a 16-year-old he has been having trouble with and wants me to seek the advice of a handwriting expert. I agree to do so. The boy is the youngest member of a talented family. Father is at the top of his profession; two older brothers sailed into Oxbridge. The boy is not in that class but is a likeable, slightly oafish youth who would probably have done well in a country boarding school.\n\nI have asked Anne O'Donnell, who has joined the staff this term, to attend the housemasters' meeting and tell us what she thinks of the way Westminster treats the 30 girls in the sixth form. Politely but firmly, she accuses us of doing the girls a disservice because we treat them as special cases. We are, she says, failing to prepare them for the adult world where they will have no special privileges. One or two housemasters are provoked, and it is interesting to hear one bachelor becoming heated on the subject. He says he wants to treat girls as special but is told that this is sexism and that he only does so because he thinks he is superior to the girls. Anne O'Donnell handles the discussion well. We clearly have much to learn about the way we treat the girls in our sixth form.\n\nI see a girl who is a candidate for entry to our sixth form in 1978. She is a good classicist. Father is a consultant surgeon and insists on saying in front of his daughter: \"She needs to meet some boys.\" Parents!\n\nThe head of modern languages tells me that a girl in his German set claims to have been seduced by a stranger in Oxford last weekend. The story lacks credibility and when the housemaster speaks to the parents, they dismiss the story as a complete fabrication. But why then has the girl made this claim? Is it because the parents' marriage is falling apart and she wishes to shout No?\n\nI see a Conservative MP who has two sons in the school. He is divorced and hardly on speaking terms with his former wife or with his elder son. The latter is head of house, a school monitor and an excellent person. He wants to try for Cambridge next term but father says he will not pay another term's fees because his new wife would not stand for it. In that case, I will pay the fees out of the Headmaster's Fund. When he hears this, father lights a cigar and tells me how bad \"Margaret\" is at communicating with backbenchers.\n\nAfter Latin prayers, spend much of the day trying to find out what substance (a good word) there is in this drug rumour. I have spent seven years trying to dispel the druggy and permissive clouds that hung over Westminster's reputation, and I will not let them return now. A master asks whether I realise that some of the rumour-mongering about Westminster's drugs is encouraged by rival schools and especially by headmistresses who are losing girls to our sixth form. The competition for pupils can sometimes be a dirty one.\n\nAn angry master. A 14-year-old has walked out of his class. Master unwisely said to the boy, who was not attending: \"Do you want to stay in this class?\" Boy answered, \"No\", and left. I know the parents; they are divorced. Resourceful mother does her best to control three teenage sons. Absent father – a recurring theme.\n\nI am woken at 2am by footsteps on the roof. I find two 14-year-old boys clambering along in the semi-darkness. I say, \"good evening\", and they, only mildly surprised to see me, say: \"Sorry, Sir\". I tell them that roof-climbing is dangerous and that they must come down through the headmaster's house and report to me in the morning. I admire their enterprise – it is what schoolboys should do sometime before they grow up, but they need a ticking off just the same.\n\nAlan Livingstone-Smith, a day-boy housemaster, tells me this story. One of his junior boys bumped into one of the school governors as he was leaving Dean's Yard yesterday. The governor tells the boy to tuck his shirt in. The boy does so but makes some smart remark which prompts the governor to lecture him on manners. The boy loses his cool and says that if he is late home his father will smash the governor's face in. As this particular governor is very critical of discipline and appearance, the boy's words could have been better chosen. I tell Alan to play the thing down but to ensure the boy apologises. The boy is a rough diamond and clearly has no idea how important governors are. I smile to myself.\n\nHow much I have always enjoyed launching a new school year [his last before retirement]. It may be partly an ego trip but it is also enthusiasm for and pride in the school. September sunshine, a little hazy, floods Little Dean's Yard, where boys and girls greet one another with cautious hugs. How different from the atmosphere of Westminster 15 years ago. The girls, even in small numbers, really have made a difference."
