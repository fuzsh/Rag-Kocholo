        "text": "\"The last thing I would compromise on are the fundamental building blocks of a properly decent, compassionate, inclusive education.\" In the next of our videos from our interview with Gary Savage, Head Master of Westminster School, London, we discuss why, despite the financial headwinds facing the sector, inclusivity should remain at the heart of your school's strategy. If you are interested in finding out more about how we can support you in this, we would love to hear from you. Contact us at info@allineducation.co.uk #DiversityAndInclusion #EDI #SchoolLeadership Johan Jensen RSAcademics\n\nWatch our first video, in a series of video clips, of All-in Education's interview with Gary Savage, Head Master at Westminster School, London. In this first short clip we discuss Westminster School's approach to an inclusive recruitment strategy and the benefits of this for their students and staff. In our series of video clips we will discuss a range of diversity and inclusion issues and how Westminster School has formed their approach to EDI with the support of All-in Education. If you are interested in finding out more about developing your own school's approach to diversity and inclusion, we would love to talk to you. Contact us on info@allineducation.co.uk #InclusiveRecruitment #DiversityAndInclusion #EDI #SchoolLeadership Johan Jensen RSAcademics https://lnkd.in/eSbTHuna\n\nSeptember 2024 will mark an exciting new era for the school when Sophie Green will join Will Phelps as Co-Head of Cheam. Sophie, formerly Headmistress of Godstowe and Tatler Prep Head of the Year, brings with her a wealth of school leadership experience, making their collective number of years in headship 25. Sophie will be the first female Head at Cheam in its 379 year history. There are very few schools with Co-Heads in the sector. What is unique at Cheam is that Will and Sophie are married and Co-Heads, making it not only a family school, but one led by a highly experienced and skilled duo. Cheam recognises the emerging and dynamic social and educational landscape and is committed to developing kind, curious and self-confident children, inspired by a talented staff team. #coheads #cheamheads #schoolleadership #progressiveeducation Read the full story on our website. https://lnkd.in/ehpZ4EpW"
