        "text": "Moreton Hall is delighted to announce that they have been awarded the prestigious HMC (The Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference) accreditation with immediate effect, reinforcing Moreton Hall’s place as one of the leading independent boarding and day schools for girls in the UK.\n\nThe HMC is the key association for the top independent schools and accreditation which follows a rigorous application process, recognises Moreton Hall’s dynamic learning environment and outstanding pastoral care under the inspirational leadership of Principal, Jonathan Forster. Now in his 26th year at the helm, Jonathan’s tenure has seen Moreton Hall become not only the destination of choice for girls from across the region and beyond, but also a centre of excellence for the local community with music, drama and sports opportunities for all. The HMC accreditation also comes as building begins on Moreton Hall’s latest initiative, ‘The Holroyd Community Theatre’ which will provide a new and vibrant Arts space for North Shropshire and the Welsh borders.\n\nJonathan Forster comments: “I am honoured and delighted to be accredited as a member of HMC. This accolade is for all the hard work of staff both inside and outside the classroom who collectively ensure that Moreton provides the very best outcome for its students.”"
