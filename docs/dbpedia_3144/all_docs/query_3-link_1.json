        "text": "The benefits of HMC membership – many of which extend to the wider school – are extensive.\n\nHMC Professional Development (HMCPD) organises around 80 courses and conferences each year for HMC members and their staff. HMCPD provides wide-ranging and high-quality training for senior and middle school leaders and runs conferences for heads, deputy heads, heads of sixth form and the heads of junior schools.\n\nOur members can rely on personal support and professional advice from HMC senior staff on matters affecting them in their role within the school.\n\nThe association has strong links with exam boards, inspection authorities, sports’ bodies and government departments to keep members informed and lobby on their behalf.\n\nHMC enjoys close working relations with the maintained sector and with the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL). It is one of the associations which make up the Independent Schools Council (ISC).\n\nMuch of the strength of HMC derives from the participation of members and their schools in the association’s work. Members play an active role in the association as part of their regional division – networking, sharing experiences and expertise as well as providing mutual support. In addition, around a third of the membership serve on an HMC Committee and/or Working Party.\n\nAnnual member Conferences – the three-day Autumn Conference and the one-day Spring Conference – are highlights on the HMC calendar."
