        "text": "Public school in Mill Hill, London\n\nNot to be confused with Mill Hill County High School or Mill Hill School, Derbyshire.\n\nMill Hill School is a 13–18 co-educational private, day and boarding school in Mill Hill, London, England that was established in 1807. It is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nA committee of Nonconformist merchants and ministers, including John Pye-Smith founded the school,[3] originally called Mill Hill Grammar School,[4] for boys on 25 January 1807. They located it sufficiently distant of London at that time, because of \"dangers both physical and moral awaiting youth while passing through the streets of a large, crowded and corrupt city\". A boarding house was opened in the residence once occupied by Peter Collinson, with about 20 boys. John Atkinson was the first headmaster and chaplain until 1810.[citation needed][a]\n\nMill Hill School occupies a 120-acre (49 ha) site, part of which formed the gardens of Ridgeway House, the house of the botanist Peter Collinson. He was one of the most important importers of rare and exotic plants into English gardens. Many of the species that he introduced to Mill Hill in the 18th century continue to grow today in the grounds of the School.[citation needed] In 1746 Collinson planted Britain's first hydrangea on the grounds, now located adjacent to School House.\n\nThe estate was purchased by the botanist Richard Salisbury in 1802, Ridgeway House became the setting for a long-running scientific dispute between the new owner and his guest, James Edward Smith.[6] The flora of Mill Hill was supplemented by the work of the amateur botanist Richard William Bowry Buckland (died 1947), governor of the foundation from 1878 to 1889, who cultivated a garden in the south-west of the school's grounds for the enjoyment of future generations. He wrote in his diary:\n\nIn years bygone I pray to thee,\n\nThis willow here, my legacy\n\nAs I have sat, pray sit thee.\n\nIn shaded splendour\n\nMillhillians; rest hither.\n\n— (signed Richard Buckland)\n\nIn 1939, Mill Hill School's premises became a hospital. The school was evacuated to St. Bees School in Cumberland for the duration of the Second World War. Collinson House, a school for girls, was named for it. A St Bees Association was founded in commemoration of this period of evacuation in the school's history by Michael Berry and David Smith.[7]\n\nMill Hill first admitted sixth form girls in 1975 and became fully co-educational in 1997. The BBC news website usually uses a picture taken at Mill Hill School for articles about boarding schools.[8][9]\n\nIn 2005 the school was one of 50 of the country's leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by The Times. Together they had driven up fees for thousands of parents.[10] Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000, and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust. It is to benefit persons who were students at the schools during the cartel period.[11]\n\nIn March 2007, Mill Hill celebrated its bicentenary. To mark the occasion, the school was granted a new coat of arms by Robert Noel, Her Majesty's Lancaster Herald.[12]\n\nIn 2018, the school experienced controversy when it was featured in the music video of London rapper Stefflon Don. In it, she was shown nude in the changing room showers, dancing on tables in classrooms, and smoking marijuana in the dormitories.[13][14][15]\n\nHouses\n\n[edit]\n\nMill Hill School is divided into houses.

Designed by Basil Champneys, it is a basilica in form. The School House was designed by Sir William Tite, famous for his work on the London Royal Exchange, School House was erected in 1825 and is described as being in the Greco-Roman style. Other buildings within the site are of both traditional and modern styling. The cricket house was used as a set in the tenth episode of Inspector Morse.[citation needed] In honour of Patrick Troughton the Mill Hill theatre was dedicated to the actor and named the Patrick Troughton Theatre in 2007.[citation needed]\n\nThe Mill Hill Education Group\n\n[edit]\n\nThe school is run by the Mill Hill School Foundation (now known as The Mill Hill Education Group),[17] a registered charity under English law.[18] The Education Group offers education to boys and girls aged 3 to 18 in seven schools.[19] The Mill Hill Education Group's other schools are:\n\nBelmont – a day school for pupils aged 7 to 13.
