        "text": "The Head[6] of Hogwarts (referred to as Headmaster if the individual was male and Headmistress if female)[3] was a title and an occupation at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, held by the witch or wizard on the Hogwarts faculty who was in charge of the safety and the day-to-day functioning of the school, and acted as the school's primary authority on the grounds.[4]\n\nThe Headmaster or Headmistress was appointment to the office by the Hogwarts Board of Governors or the British Ministry of Magic. [4][6][7]\n\nThe occupant of this post also had a Deputy Heads, or a number of co-Deputy Heads, who would assist them in their duties and who, in the event of their absence, served as acting head of the school until their return, or until a new Headteacher was appointed.[9]\n\nThe incumbent headteacher acted as the school's main ambassador, and was therefore expected to diplomatise with the Ministry of Magic,[10][11] as well as with foreign schools, in the event of the Triwizard Tournament and presumably other competitions.[12]\n\nResources[]\n\nThe headteacher of the school was provided a support mechanism for the decisions they had to make in the form of a large gallery of portraits mounted on the walls of the Headmaster's office, all of which depicted previous headteachers who held the office in past centuries. The portraits had been trained by their once-living counterparts to assist the later headteachers as best as possible in an advisory capacity.[13] Even so, a magical living portrait was still less than half of the real thing, and the responsibility of decision making fell on the current headteacher.\n\nIn addition, the office of headteacher came with access to a Pensieve, one that Hogwarts founders discovered half-buried in the dirt in the very location where they would build the school. With this Pensieve, they could view the memories of past headteachers, and even contribute to that library of knowledge by adding in their own memories.[14]\n\nPower and rights[]\n\nOver the castle and grounds[]\n\nThe Headmaster's Tower, which housed the office and personal residence of the current headteacher, like so many things in Hogwarts, seemed to have a will of its own. The portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black, a previous Headmaster of Hogwarts, remarked that under certain circumstances, the tower would be \"barred to all but the rightful headmaster\", and at least partially subject to their will as well, as Dumbledore on at least one occasion was able to decide if his office door could be opened or not by force of will alone.[15] Hence, when Dolores Umbridge was appointed as headmistress, the office saw her as illegitimate and refused to grant her access, forcing her to use her old office instead.[16]\n\nThe headteacher was only one with the authority to banish people from the grounds,[17] and also had the final say on what creatures resided within the Magical Creatures Reserve at the school.[18] They were also able to Apparate and Disapparate at will from the Hogwarts grounds,[19] which most individuals were otherwise incapable of doing.[20] Albus Dumbledore, as headmaster of the school, was also able to open a window in the Anti-Disapparition Jinx for teaching purposes,[21] yet other members of the faculty could not do the same when they needed to evacuate the school in an emergency situation.[22] They could similarly lift the Muggle-Repelling Charm on Hogwarts, as Armando Dippet did when he invited the parents of Myrtle Warren to collect her body from the school in the 1940s.[23]\n\nOver the staff[]\n\nThe headteacher of Hogwarts was tasked with interviewing, evaluating, and had the final decision on the appointment of new teachers and other faculty members, all of whom were answerable to them upon assuming their position. Accordingly, the head of the school had the power to promote them to higher positions within their department, such as Head of Herbology[24] and Head of Transfiguration.[25] Presumably, they were also in charge of selecting the four Heads of House, which were similarly seen as a promotion,[26] and had disciplinary powers over the staff, such as the right to determine the outcome of their probationary period,[18] and to terminate their employment if necessary.[27]\n\nOver the students[]\n\nThe Headteacher of Hogwarts could not only invoke the same disciplinary actions as their fellow professors, but they could also change or overturn any punishments, sanctions, and removal of privileges handed out by other staff members (with the likely exception of those handed out by the High Inquisitor during the period that Educational Decree Number 25 was in effect).[28] Misbehaving students, such as Bertha Jorkins, would sometimes be sent to the Headteacher's office.[29] Apparently, any expulsion needed to be confirmed by the head of the school, who had also the power to revoke the expulsion after the fact if he or she had reason to believe there were mitigating circumstances previously unknown to them, or otherwise found that they had made a mistake.[30]\n\nSchool security[]\n\nThe Headteacher of Hogwarts was responsible for ensuring the safety of students, and this could be accomplished through various means. In the 1926–1927 school year amid the rise of Gellert Grindelwald, students were sent home early and an emergency meeting was called with parents to discuss Grindelwald's threat.[31] The headteacher was expected to cooperate with the Ministry of Magic to conduct school security, such as stationing Dementors,[32][33] Security trolls,[34] and trained Aurors within the grounds and castle.[35]\n\nWhen the Chamber of Secrets was reopened during the 1992–1993 school year, the threat in question came from within the school itself. Then-Headmaster Albus Dumbledore organised and supervised patrols around the school by the staff, and implemented security measures such as having students escorted back and forth to the bathrooms and between lessons by the teachers, and to have cancelled all Quidditch practices and evening activities in order to keep the students confined to the safety of their common rooms for most of the day.[36]\n\nList of Headteachers[]\n\nKnown time period[]\n\nPortrait Name Tenure Notes First Headmaster of Hogwarts c. 11th century He was the first headmaster of the school, as none of the four founders ever held the position before him.[8] Professor Dame\n\nPhyllida Spore c. 1408[37] A celebrated Herbologist and author of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.[38] At some point in her life, she was awarded the title of 'Dame'.[39] Professor\n\nNiamh Fitzgerald c. 1470s[40] One of the Keepers.[41] Professor\n\nEdessa Sakndenberg c. 1503[42] A social historian who specialised in Muggle society.[43] Professor\n\nFytherley Undercliffe c. 1531[44] Professor\n\nBrian Gagwilde c. 1568[45] A contemporary of Walter Aragon and Aberforth Dumbledore, with whom he played Wizard's Chess.[46] Professor Dame\n\nAntonia Creaseworthy c. 1624[44] At some point in her life, she was awarded the title of 'Dame'.[47] Professor\n\nVindictus Viridian c. 1703[48] Published a wide bibliography ranging from Dark charms[38] to taming tigers.[49] Apparently a highly skilled potioneer as well, as most of his portraits depicted him brewing potions.[48] Professor\n\nAmrose Swott c. 1724[44] Professor\n\nDilys Derwent 1741 – 1768[50] One of the most celebrated heads in the history of Hogwarts.[50] Unidentified Headteacher 1792[12] Headteacher during the Triwizard Tournament of 1792.[12] Professor\n\nEupraxia Mole 1876[51] Bewitched the Daedalian Keys.[52] Signed a contract with Peeves which allowed him a once-weekly swim in the boys' toilets on the ground floor.[51] Professor\n\nPhineas Nigellus Black 1890s[52] The most unpopular headmaster in history.[53] Served during the invasion of the school by Ranrok.[52] Professor\n\nArmando Dippet c. 1925 – between 1965 and 1971[54] Famously accomplished headmaster.

(First Class) June 1993[55] – April 1996[6] Sacked by the British Ministry of Magic for spreading the truth that Lord Voldemort had returned, as well as being accused of establishing Dumbledore's Army.[6] Professor\n\nDolores Umbridge April 1996[6] – 18 June 1996[16] Though proclaimed headmistress, Umbridge was not actually acknowledged as such by the Headmaster's office, which shut her out for the remainder of the year.[16] Professor\n\nAlbus Dumbledore\n\nO.M. (First Class) 19 June 1996[15] – 30 June 1997[57] Reinstated, but killed by Severus Snape at the end of the school year under his own orders.[57] Professor\n\nMinerva McGonagall 30 June 1997[57] – 1 September 1997[58] Acting headmistress after Albus Dumbledore's murder. She and the other professors discussed whether Hogwarts should be closed, but she was quickly deposed by Severus Snape after the fall of the Ministry.[59] Professor\n\nSeverus Snape 1 September 1997[58] – 2 May 1998[60] A spy for the Order of the Phoenix, he was appointed by the Death Eater-controlled Ministry of Magic after murdering Albus Dumbledore on Dumbledore's own orders.[58] He ran the school with an emphasis on the Dark Arts, and was eventually killed by Lord Voldemort during the Battle of Hogwarts.[60] After his death, Harry Potter learned the truth behind Snape's actions and campaigned for his portrait to reside in the Headmaster's office,[61] which Minerva McGonagall allowed.[62] Professor\n\nMinerva McGonagall\n\nO.M. (First Class) 2 May 1998[60] – at least 2021[63] Instrumental in defending the castle during the Battle of Hogwarts.[22] In the 2010–2011 school year, she once again defended the school in the Siege of Hogwarts.[18] She was considered an \"inspirational headmistress\".[1]\n\nAlternative timeline[]\n\nPortrait Name Tenure Notes Professor\n\nDolores Umbridge 1998 – at least 2020[64] In an alternative world where Lord Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts, Umbridge was the Headmistress.[64]\n\nUnknown time period[]\n\nPortrait Name Notes Professor\n\nBasil Fronsac A Ravenclaw known for his love of education and the Hogwarts Library.[65] Professor\n\nBrutus Scrimgeour A prolific Quidditch fan who authored The Beaters' Bible.[66] Professor\n\nDexter Fortescue Highly informed on the Elder Wand and Ravenclaw's Diadem.[67] Professor\n\nElizabeth Burke A ruthless Slytherin and pure-blood supremacist.[65] She had ties to the Malfoy family.[68] Professor\n\nEverard One of the most celebrated heads.[50] Professor\n\nGiffard Abbott A Hufflepuff.[65] Gimlet-eyed headmistress Professor\n\nHeliotrope Wilkins Professor\n\nLimebert Professor\n\nMordicus Egg Authored two known books on Muggles.

Namesake of the Walter Aragon Wizard Chess Competition.[46] Appeared to have an interest in Care of Magical Creatures, as he authored a book on the subject titled Newts of Bognor.[70]\n\nUnidentified Headteachers[]\n\nThe following are individuals of whom no information can be gained. They were never seen to interact with any other portraits or individuals, and there is no knowledge of their names or dates of tenure:\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nHogwarts is the only school confirmed to have Deputy Headmasters and Headmistresses. It's unknown if this position exists in other wizarding schools.\n\nDolores Umbridge was not considered an official Hogwarts Headmistress by most. Hence, the Headmaster's office did not open to her, and Phineas Nigellus Black told Severus Snape that he was the first Headmaster from Slytherin since himself, although Professor Umbridge was also a Slytherin.\n\nPhineas Nigellus Black was considered to be the least popular Headmaster of Hogwarts if one discounts the unofficial Headmistress Umbridge.\n\nWhen Dumbledore was suspended in 1993 for the second opening of the Chamber of Secrets, Draco Malfoy suggested that Snape apply for Headmaster due to his liking for the teacher at the time. Eventually, Snape indeed became Headmaster, five years after the suggestion, though at that time Draco lost his liking for Severus.\n\nIn Jack Thorne's original version of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the Headmaster of Hogwarts was a professor named Marazion, but after reading it, J. K. Rowling sent him an e-mail saying she didn't think Marazion fit, and that they need McGonagall.[74]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (First appearance)\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\n\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child (play)\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (Mentioned only)\n\nQuidditch Through the Ages\n\nThe Tales of Beedle the Bard (Mentioned only)\n\nJ.
