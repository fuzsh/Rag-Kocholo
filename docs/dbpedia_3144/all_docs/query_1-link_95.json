        "text": "Head of School\n\nAlex’s own educational journey began as a student at the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C. She studied pre-med at Brown University, where she earned her BS in Biology, and later earned an MBA from Mills College with a focus on Educational Leadership.\n\nDuring her fifteen years at San Francisco University High School, she taught, served as Dean of Students, and gained national recognition for an innovative mentoring program she developed. In 2019, she joined the highly respected Crystal Springs Uplands School as Head of Upper School.\n\nAlex and her family – husband Dr. Paul Hauser and their two young sons Henry and Walker – live in Mesa House.\n\nAssistant Head of School | Ex-Officio (Fac.)\n\nJay started his career in boarding schools in 1993 at Cheshire Academy in Cheshire, Connecticut. Teaching runs in his blood (both of his parents were educators), but what drew him to boarding school was the sense of community that he found—a community that reminded him of the small town in Maine where he grew up. After nine years at Cheshire Academy, Jay came to Cate in 2002 to pursue a teaching position that included classes in the history and English departments. Jay was the Dean of Students for four years, and he currently serves the School as the Assistant Head of School.\n\nBeyond his duties at Cate, Jay enjoys baking bread, playing basketball, running, and reading. He lives on campus with his wife, Margot, and his three children, Molly, Olivia, and Charlie.\n\nImmediate Past Chair\n\nDuring his years at Cate, Wyatt was a varsity water-polo player, a teaching assistant in the Human Development program, co-business manager of the yearbook, and treasurer for the Student-Faculty Senate. He graduated from Duke University with a B.A. in economics and completed an M.B.A. at MIT’s Sloan School of Management.\n\nHe was a partner at Arience Capital Management in New York for five years before moving to San Francisco in 2009 to launch the hedge fund Ross Creek Capital Management, of which he currently serves as president. Wyatt lives with his wife and three children. He serves as chair of the leadership council of Tipping Point Community, a Bay Area-based non-profit focused on eradicating poverty in the Bay Area through education, housing, healthcare, and employment. His mother Linda Gruber was a member of the Cate Board of Trustees from 1996 to 2002.\n\nVice Chair\n\nMarianne Sprague received her B.A. in Sociology from UCLA in 1971 and a Master’s Degree in Special Education and Teaching Credential from California State University at Los Angeles in 1974. She and her late husband, Norm, have seen six children through Cate School. She served as CPO president in ’97-’98 and again in ’08 as well as serving concurrently on the board.\n\nShe takes her seat on the Cate Board of Trustees with experience serving on numerous school boards. She chaired the boards of Crane School in Santa Barbara and Park Century School in Los Angeles. Marianne currently serves on the board of The College of Wooster, Garden Club of Santa Barbara and volunteers as a vice-chair of the Garden History and Design national committee for the Garden Club of America. She has also served on the boards of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, Lotusland, and St. Matthews School in Los Angeles.\n\nMarianne continues to be one of the School’s most committed supporters and volunteers. She co-chaired the Centennial Committee of 100 Celebration Team; she has been a Mesa Association and Parent Fund volunteer as well as a Cate 2000 Capital Campaign volunteer. In 2009, she and her husband received The Servons Award for distinguished service.\n\nTreasurer\n\nKristen graduated from Yale with a degree in American Studies and from UCLA with an MBA. She has spent her career in real estate finance, first at Salomon Brothers in New York and since 1990 with Klingbeil Capital Management.\n\nShe has a deep affiliation with Cate, having arrived on the Mesa as a faculty spouse in 1990 and has lived in both Long House and on the faculty shelf. She and her husband, Karl, have four daughters, proud graduates of both the ELC and Cate – Julia ’08, Evelyn ’09, Annie ’12, and Charlotte ’22 (almost a graduate).\n\nKristen has served as a trustee of Crane School and is currently on the Board of Directors of Planned Parenthood California Central Coast.\n\nHead of School | Secretary\n\nMs. Alexandra Lockett was named Cate School’s ninth Head of School on December 13, 2022.\n\nMs. Lockett won the admiration of the extended Cate community during her visit to the Mesa with her approachability, her eagerness to listen and learn, her positive and seemingly endless energy, and her genuine care for student and faculty well-being. She brings with her a demonstrated commitment to academic rigor and faculty professional development, extensive experience with diversity and inclusion work, a background in mediation as well as business administration and management, and most importantly, an extraordinary ability to connect with students, faculty, parents, and alumni alike.\n\nMs. Lockett’s own educational journey began as a student at the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C. She studied pre-med at Brown University, where she earned her BS in Biology, and later earned an MBA from Mills College with a focus on Educational Leadership. During her fifteen years at San Francisco University High School, she taught, served as Dean of Students, and gained national recognition for an innovative mentoring program she developed. In 2019, she joined the highly respected Crystal Springs Uplands School as Head of Upper School and has led that community with exemplary skill and compassion through the challenges of the pandemic.\n\nMs. Lockett distinguished herself from a field of diverse and impressive candidates as a coalition builder and a driven agent of positive change. We have found in her someone who deeply senses “the spirit of this place” and who will lead our school into the future with strength, vision, and courage while honoring its core values and distinguished past.\n\nAs Cate embarks on this exciting new chapter, it is with great joy that we welcome Ms. Lockett, along with her husband Dr. Paul Hauser, a beloved and respected science teacher at the Nueva School, and their two sons, Henry (8) and Walker (5), who are particularly excited about their new backyard, the Mesa.\n\nLife Trustee\n\nAfter graduating from Cate, Rick majored in history at Stanford and then served as a social worker in New York City.

He was honored with the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 2010.\n\nTrustee\n\nHaving children motivated Lauren to return to graduate school, where she earned a Master of Arts in Clinical Psychology to better understand the mental health challenges teens and parents face. As an Associate Marriage and Family Therapist (AMFT #135201) at a group private practice, her passion lies in helping parents improve communication with their children, as well as finding ways to support teens in today’s results-driven academic environment.
