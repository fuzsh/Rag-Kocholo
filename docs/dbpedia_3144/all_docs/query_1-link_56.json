        "text": "The Society for Classical Learning is committed to developing and sustaining the leadership of the classical Christian school movement. Without great leadership, we know our schools will not thrive. The success of classical Christian education will only continue to the degree we have capable leaders to sustain it\n\nSCL seeks to support and strengthen classical Christian schools through a range of leadership development offerings as well as consulting services. Through personalized consulting sessions, members can receive valuable guidance on a range of issues, such as Head of School and Board leadership, academic programming, governance, and teacher training. By working with a consultant, members can gain the insights and strategies needed to establish and lead thriving schools.\n\nCollaborating with a consultant enables you to leverage their expertise, insights, and guidance. With the SCL Consulting Team, you receive:\n\nWise, highly qualified, seasoned leaders who provide expert insight and counsel\n\nDedicated commitment to ensuring a classical Christian approach to both the content and methods used to consult\n\nTailored consulting engagements designed toward the individual needs of each client\n\nClearly articulated outcomes and deliverables\n\nDiscounted rates for SCL member schools. Not a member? We invite you to learn more at our membership page. We look forward to working with you!\n\nWhether you’re an experienced board member or a new head of school , SCL consulting can provide tremendous support and guidance to help you thrive in your role. Don’t wait—get the tools and strategies you need to thrive.\n\nThe Head of School is the most important position at any independent school. However, the demands of the role are extremely challenging. If you are a new Head of School, SCL highly recommends investing in a coach to give you wisdom and help you thrive. Of course, even the most experienced Head can benefit from coaching [hyperlink – why every Head should hire a coach], feedback, and insight from an experienced coach. SCL offers a wide range of consulting services targeted at Heads of School, including one-on-one coaching, evaluation, developing a leadership team, and Head Search. To learn more, schedule a consultation.\n\nThe role of the board is to sustain the long-term viability of the school. To do this, boards must have a mature governance model, sound financial stewardship, and the ability to think strategically about the future of the school. Boards must also be able to support, evaluate, and grow the Head of School. Boards need to possess a clear understanding of the classical Christian philosophy and be equipped with the best practices of governance. SCL offers board workshops, Board Chair coaching, strategic planning, master planning, and most topics related to board development.\n\nClassical Christian schools need to have a clear vision of how their mission relates to a biblical view of calling and the aims of their mission. College Advising is an area of the school that can often operate in conflict with the school’s mission. Retaining a deep understanding of classical Christian principles and parent partnership is vital. Does your school need help developing a philosophy of college advising? Building a vocational and college advising program? Coaching for your college advisor? If so, schedule a consultation.\n\nAlignment of a school’s key stakeholders (parents, faculty, staff, board) to your school’s unique vision and understanding of CCE is vital to long-term growth. What does your ongoing parent education look like to ensure shared commitment? Is your marketing message aligned and clear? Would it be beneficial to have an outside evangelist for CCE inspire your next auction dinner or open house? Forming a yearlong culture-shaping program for your school is one of many solutions to help you advance to the next level. If interested, schedule a consultation.\n\nTeacher training is one of the most pressing needs among classical Christian schools. From new teacher training to subject-specific training and mentoring, SCL offers a range of services to help your teachers understand the history, philosophy, culture, and pedagogy of classical Christian education. For more information, schedule a consultation and learn more about how the SCL consulting team can serve you.\n\nMore leadership consulting offerings will be added soon!\n\nEric Cook is the President of the Society for Classical Learning (SCL).

His strengths are vision (seeing what doesn’t exist but could/should), discernment, persistent resolve and equanimity, adaptability, and relational leadership, qualities that are especially prominent in times of uncertainty and crisis when he thrives due to his high tolerance for ambiguity and risk.\n\nPrior to co-founding Veritas Academy in 2004, Jef was an experienced business owner, operator, and consultant, having started and/or served as a senior executive officer (CFO/COO/CEO) at several high growth companies in Houston and Austin.

Deborah believes that college and career counseling is a sacred journey, an unfolding adventure, not merely a perfunctory checklist to push through in order to win a coveted seat from a college “named on a list.” The pillars of classical Christian education - Truth, Goodness, and Beauty - should be manifest in the\n\nvocational discernment process where the goal is to help students discover their calling\n\n(vocare) and walk in the fullness and flourishing (Eudaimonia) that comes from following Christ’s call.
