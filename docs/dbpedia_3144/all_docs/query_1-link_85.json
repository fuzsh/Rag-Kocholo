        "text": "The history of the Cathedral Choristers is deeply interwoven in the history of The Cathedral School of St. John the Divine. In 1901, Bishop Henry Codman Potter founded The Choir School of The Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Originally located in Guild Hall (now known as Synod Hall) on the Cathedral Close, the school expanded in 1913 when the present school building was completed. It provided accommodations for 45 resident Choristers, with musical training under the direction of the Master of Choristers and general education supervised by the Headmaster.\n\nPresently, the Chorister program represents a unique partnership between The Cathedral of St. John the Divine and The Cathedral School. Cathedral School students drawn from the fifth through eighth grades join together to practice three times per week. Choristers provide musical leadership for services in the Cathedral on Sundays during the academic year. Choristers sing additional concerts at Christmas and are in high demand for professional engagements.\n\nThe Choristers have toured the world for decades. Recent tours have taken them to Japan, Ireland, and Colonial Williamsburg. In 2019, the Choristers traveled to England for residencies at St. Paul's Cathedral and Canterbury Cathedral. Rehearsing, singing for services, and preparing for special events provide a comprehensive music education, enabling the Choristers to learn a large and varied repertoire of sacred music.\n\nAuditions for prospective Choristers are held at the end of fourth grade, and The Cathedral School provides stipends for Choristers in the form of tuition reduction. Interested parents and guardians are encouraged to contact Bryan Zaros, Associate Choirmaster, at bzaros@stjohndivine.org.\n\nKent Tritle, Director of Cathedral Music & Organist\n\nKent Tritle is one of America’s leading choral conductors. Called “the brightest star in New York's choral music world” by The New York Times, he is in his sixth season as Director of Cathedral Music and Organist at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City; his tenth season as Music Director of Musica Sacra, the longest continuously performing professional chorus in New York; and his twelfth season as Music Director of the Oratorio Society of New York, the acclaimed 200-voice volunteer chorus.\n\nIn addition, Kent is Director of Choral Activities and Chair of the Organ Department at the Manhattan School of Music and is a member of the graduate faculty of The Juilliard School. Also an acclaimed organ virtuoso, Kent Tritle is the organist of the New York Philharmonic and the American Symphony Orchestra."
