        "text": "The vast majority of the governing bodies of schools whose heads belong to HMC (the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference), the Girls’ Schools Association (GSA), and the Society of Heads are all members of AGBIS, as are many of the schools that are members of the Independent Association of Prep Schools (IAPS) and the Independent Schools Association (ISA).\n\nFull membership of AGBIS is open to schools in England and Wales accredited to ISC as well as non-association schools from other parts of the UK and overseas. Associate status is available to schools which do not meet the criteria for full membership and is often used as a route to full membership. All schools applying to join AGBIS must demonstrate good governance procedures. Full members and Associates enjoy the benefits of the full range of services and support.\n\nAGBIS welcomes applications from schools who meet the membership criteria.\n\nMembership to AGBIS is through an application from the school via the Application for Membership Form and all membership applications are scrutinised by the Membership Committee and their recommendations are considered by the Board. The full process is explained below in the membership criteria document.\n\nThe membership subscription is based on pupil size as submitted to the ISC census in January. The 2024 subscription charges are as follows:\n\nAll schools with 1 to 200 pupils pay £225\n\nSchools will then be charged a per-pupil fee for any numbers above 200, up to 1500 pupils\n\nFor numbers above 1500 in any individual school there is no extra charge"
