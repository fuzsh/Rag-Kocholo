For 120 years, we have been the examination board that has sat at the heart of the UK’s independent and international schools. Our long and respected heritage means we are trusted by schools, teachers, pupils and families, and our independence means we are able to continue to innovate in assessment design.\n\nBuilding on the trusted foundation of our CE exams, we offer a growing range of diverse and flexible assessment options for schools located all over the world, whether independent, maintained or state-funded. All our assessments and qualifications are developed in collaboration with schools, teachers, pupils and families, through pilots and trials, and in response to feedback and consultation. With an unrivalled reputation for robust and bespoke assessments, we work with all the major UK education associations and the UK government to continually innovate, always putting pupil outcomes at the centre of what we do. ISEB is committed to evolving assessments for future generations."
