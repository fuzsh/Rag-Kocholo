        "text": "In England and Wales, a public school is a type of fee-charging private school[1] originally for older boys. They are \"public\" in the sense of being open to pupils irrespective of locality, denomination or paternal trade or profession; nor are they run for the profit of a private owner.\n\na b c public school\n\nDOWNLOAD ---> https://bltlly.com/2zQv7i\n\nAlthough the term \"public school\" has been in use since at least the 18th century,[2] its usage was formalised by the Public Schools Act 1868,[a][3] which put into law most recommendations of the 1864 Clarendon Report. Nine prestigious schools were investigated by Clarendon (including two day schools, Merchant Taylors' and St Paul's) and seven subsequently reformed by the Act: Eton, Shrewsbury, Harrow, Winchester, Rugby, Westminster, and Charterhouse.[4][5]\n\nPublic schools are elite institutions and are associated with the ruling class.[6][7][8] Historically, public schools produced many of the military officers and administrators of the British Empire.[9][10] In 2019, two-thirds of cabinet ministers of the United Kingdom had been educated at such fee-charging schools.[11]\n\nIn Scotland, a public school has a different significance; there the term is typically synonymous with state school in England and Wales. Fee-charging schools are referred to as private or independent schools.[12]\n\nThere is no single or absolute definition of public school, and the use of the term has varied over time and according to context. The starting point was the contrast between a public school and private teaching (eg., provided by a hired tutor).[2]In England and Wales schools that are called public schools are not funded from public taxation.[13]\n\nSydney Smith in an 1810 article published in The Edinburgh Review suggested the following. \"By a public school, we mean an endowed place of education of old standing, to which the sons of gentlemen resort in considerable numbers, and where they continue to reside, from eight or nine, to eighteen years of age. We do not give this as a definition which would have satisfied Porphyry or Duns-Scotus, but as one sufficiently accurate for our purpose. The characteristic features of these schools are, their antiquity, the numbers, and the ages of the young people who are educated at them ...\".[14]\n\nArthur Leach, in his History of Winchester College (1899), stated: \"The only working definition of a Public School...is that it is an aristocratic or plutocratic school which is wholly or almost wholly a Boarding School, is under some form of more or less public control, and is ... non-local\".[15]\n\nVivian Ogilvie in The English Public School (1957) suggests five \"characteristics commonly associated with a public school\" (while allowing that these are not absolute or definitive): \"it is a class school, catering for a well-to-do clientle; it is expensive; it is non-local; it is a predominantly boarding school; it is independent of the State and of local government, yet it is not privately owned or run for profit.\"[17]\n\nOxford Dictionary of English:'In England, originally, a grammar-school founded or endowed for use or benefit of the public, either generally, or of a particular locality, and carried on under some kind of public management or control; often contrasted with a \"private school\" carried on at the risk and for the profit of its master or proprietors.'[18]\n\nIn November 1965, the UK Cabinet considered the definition of a public school for the purpose of the Public Schools Commission set up that year. It started with the 1944 Fleming Committee definition of Public Schools, which consisted of schools which were members of the then Headmasters' Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Girls' Schools Association.[19] At that time, there were 276 such independent schools (134 boys and 142 girls), which the 1965 Public Schools Commission took in scope of its work and also considered 22 maintained and 152 direct grant grammar schools.[20]\n\nIn 2023, using the 1965 Public Schools Commission definition or the 1944 Fleming Committee definition,[21] there are 302 independent secondary schools belonging to the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (78% of HMC schools are co-educational, 9% are boys only and 13% are girls only),[22][23] and 152 independent girls' secondary schools belonging to the Girls' Schools Association.[24]\n\nThe majority of public schools are affiliated with, or were established by, a Christian denomination, principally the Church of England,[25] but in some cases the Roman Catholic and Methodist churches.[26] A small number are non-denominational or inherently secular, including Oswestry School,[27] Bedales[28] and University College School.[29]\n\nA minor public school is defined in Brewer's Dictionary of Modern Phrase and Fable [30] as \"a somewhat demeaning term dating from the 1930s for an English public school that is not one of the ancient foundations, such as Eton, Harrow, Rugby or Winchester\". Public school rivalry[31] is a factor in the perception of a \"great\" (or \"major\") versus \"minor\" distinction.[32]\n\nThe perception of a top tier of public schools is long standing but with some debate on membership.Howard Staunton's book of 1865 entitled The Great Schools of England considered the nine Clarendon schools plus Cheltenham College, Christ's Hospital, and Dulwich College.[33]In 1881 C.Kegan Paul & Co published Our Public Schools with chapters on seven schools: Eton, Harrow, Winchester, Rugby, Westminster, Marlborough, and Charterhouse.[34]In 1893 Edward Arnold published a book entitled Great Public Schools with a chapter on each of Eton, Harrow, Charterhouse, Cheltenham, Rugby, Clifton, Westminster, Marlborough, Haileybury, and Winchester.[35]\n\nPublic schools emerged from grammar schools[37] established to educate pupils, usually destined for clerical orders, in Latin grammar. Thus, concerned with educating boys. The term \"public\" came into use because over time access to such schools was not restricted on the basis of home location, paternal occupation or status, and that they were subject to an element of public management or control,[38] in contrast to private schools which were run for the personal profit of the owner(s).[39] The origins of schools in England were primarily religious, although in 1640 the House of Commons invited the reformer and promoter of universal education Comenius to England to establish and participate in an agency for the promotion of learning. It was intended that by-products of this would be the publication of \"universal\" books and the setting up of schools for boys and girls.[40] The English Civil War prevented any such reform.[41][42]\n\nBy the end of the 17th century, the London day schools St Paul's and Merchant Taylors', together with the charitable foundations of Christ's Hospital and Charterhouse, had developed an elevated \"standing in popular regard\".[53]\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, two local grammar schools, Harrow and Rugby, had achieved national fame.[54] In the case of Harrow, political sponsorship by aristocratic Whig politician James Brydges (later Duke of Chandos) played a significant role,[55] but also, as was the case too with Rugby, an exemplary headmaster was a key factor in raising the status of the school.[56] This phenomenon was also seen at Shrewsbury, where Samuel Butler was headmaster between 1798 and 1836.[57]\n\nIn 1801 William Vincent, headmaster of Westminster published A Defence of Public Education.[58] It contains the text \"...comprize under the expression of Public Schools? Are we to understand only Winchester, Eton and Westminster? or are we to extend our notion, as we ought to do, to the other three great schools in the Metropolis;[c] to Harrow, Rugby, Manchester, Wakefield and many more of equal magnitude in the North?\"\n\nIn 1816 Rudolph Ackermann published a book which used the term \"History of the Public Schools\" of what he described as the \"principal schools of England\",[59] entitled The History of the Colleges of Winchester, Eton, and Westminster; with the Charter-House, the Schools of St. Paul's, Merchant Taylors, Harrow, and Rugby, and the Free-School of Christ's Hospital.\n\nIn 1818 Nicholas Carlisle published a two-volume survey entitled A Concise Description of the Endowed Grammar Schools in England and Wales.[60] The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire sent to the schools. The description of 475 schools[61] range from one or two paragraphs to many pages of detail. Included in the survey are the renowned nine schools which forty three years later became the subject of the 1861 Clarendon Commission.\n\nSeparate preparatory schools (or \"prep schools\") for younger boys developed from the 1830s, with entry to the senior schools becoming limited to boys of at least 12 or 13 years old. The first of these was Windlesham House School, established with support from Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby School between 1828 and 1841.[64][65]\n\nThe Public Schools Act 1868 subsequently regulated and reformed the seven boarding schools investigated by Clarendon, and in summary established and granted autonomy to new governing bodies for the seven schools and as part of that, released them from previous obligations under their founding charters to educate \"boys on the Foundation\" ie scholarship boys who paid nominal or no fees.[67] The Act gave the seven schools independence from direct jurisdiction or responsibility of the Crown, the established church, or the government. Henceforth each of these schools was to be managed by a board of governors. St Paul's School and the Merchant Taylors' School claimed successfully that their constitutions made them \"private\" schools, and were excluded from the requirements of this legislation.[68]\n\nThe Taunton Commission was appointed in 1864 to examine the remaining 782 endowed grammar schools, and in 1868 produced recommendations to restructure their endowments; these recommendations were included, in modified form, in the Endowed Schools Act 1869. In that year Edward Thring, headmaster of Uppingham School, wrote to 37 of his fellow headmasters of what he considered the leading boys' schools, not covered by the Public Schools Act of 1868, inviting them to meet annually[69] to address the threat posed by the Endowed Schools Act of 1869. In the first year 12 headmasters attended; the following year 34 attended, including heads from the Clarendon schools. The Headmasters' Conference (HMC), now the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, has grown steadily and by 2021 had 298 British and Irish schools as members.[70]\n\n64591212e2"
