        "text": "According to one account, the school goes low key during the war years, after the government determined that all foreign schools in Brazil were to be closed or adapted to Brazilian system. Once the war efforts are over, schools come back to normal life and funds are raised to build the Cashman Building on land leased by the community to the school.\n\nAll students are changed to the February to December academic calendar.\n\nThe school is accredited by the Brazilian Educational authorities to offer the Segundo Grau.\n\nThe first Cambridge IGCSE examinations are taken by The British School students.\n\nDirector Mr Paul Wiseman arrived at the TBS in 1988 as Head of Humanities. In 1990, he was Head of Seniors and Deputy Headmaster. In December 1994 he became the new Headmaster, now known as the Director.\n\nAs a result of the success of the IB programme, the growing Senior School puts pressure on space in Botafogo. A fourth floor is added to the Cashman Building over the course of two holiday periods. The new classrooms are ready for use in February 1998.\n\nOn December 1st is officially inaugurated as the Jane Robertson Library. Ms Jane had joined the school in 1992 and had developed into an extremely dedicated and highly effective teacher. She suddenly passed away in 2003, at the age of 41. With Jane’s passing the school community lost a wonderful example of how to be – as a teacher, a mother, a friend, a colleague. Jane will always be so much more than a memory for those who knew her; she will be a guide and a source of strength as we consider our own destinies.\n\nAt Urca a new house is rented and refurbished to house offices, staff room and a centre for the IB Business Studies course. Open space for playground is made available at the back court of the house to all students.\n\nThe Barra Unit starts in February with 555 children. The new building at the Barra Unit is opened housing the Nursery, Reception and Classes 1 to 6. Pre-Nursery and Infants Classes are expanded within the Block B. The Library is extended to incorporate an area for Seniors. At Botafogo Site, the first Pre-Nursery class is open with 11 children.\n\nThe new building kept the façade of the Ribeiro dos Santos House and occupies the area of three houses. It was developed to include a gymnasium/auditorium, new classrooms for Classes 4 and 5, a new Upper Primary / Lower Seniors Library, two new ICT labs, a large Art Room and a new Science Lab.\n\nThe first TBSRJ Staff Conference!\n\nA 3 day “Inspiring Learning: Taking the Initiative” conference . Over 300 of our own staff attended the conference as part of their annual training and we welcomed a number of external delegates from as far afield as Peru and Mexico.\n\nThe new building at Barra Unit is ready. This building accommodates senior students for most of their classes, as well as providing a large learning resource centre (library) and multi-purpose hall. The students began classes in their new facilities in February 2017.\n\nTBSRJ worked in partnership with Team GB to organise opportunities for the British athletes to train with their coaches at the Barra Unit during the Olympic Games. It was felt important for the athletes to have a quiet, relaxing environment for them to meet friends and family, receive physiotherapy and meet with coaches and performance analysts. The Barra Unit of The British School became a very important part of Team GB-2019 strategy for winning as many medals as possible. In fact, Team GB broke a number of records with their medal haul by celebrating 67 medals in total - more than on home ground during the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nThe British School - Barra Unit was very honoured to receive a visit from HRH The Princess Royal, Princess Anne and her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, on 10th August 2016. Princess Anne is President of the British Olympic Association and was here in Rio de Janeiro to support Team GB by attending various Olympic events and receptions.\n\nOn September 12th a ceremony was held to give awards to students who had achieved their Bronze, Silver and Gold Awards in the Duke of Edinburgh Programme.
