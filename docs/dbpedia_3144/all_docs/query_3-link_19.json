        "text": "DAME Allan’s Schools is celebrating 75 years as a valued member of HMC - a professional association of heads from the world's leading independent schools, striving for quality, innovation and excellence in education.\n\nHMC (the Headmasters and Headmistresses’ Conference) is a thriving and proactive membership body that was founded in 1869. It serves to support and represent the views of 300 independent schools from across the UK and Ireland, as well as 60 international members.\n\nPrincipal Will Scott said Dame Allan’s association with HMC further strengthens the Schools’ commitment to deliver academic excellence, strong pastoral care and exceptional co-curricular opportunities across its diamond structure.\n\nHe said: “It is a privilege to be a member of this group of independent school heads; a group which not only helps us to provide the best possible education in our own schools, but which also is increasingly focused on leadership in the national education conversation on key issues such as standards, equity and assessment reform.\""
