        "text": "Rear Admiral Chris Parry disabled an Argentinian submarine in the Falklands and handled challenging, complex operations. But when it came to dealing with some of the most powerful independent headteachers in the country, his bravery in the field counted for little.\n\nJust seven weeks into the job as the chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, the body that speaks for private education, Parry made critical remarks about state schools that left independent heads running for cover. Parry promptly departed, and now heads a strategic forecasting and change consultancy.\n\nNow his successor, David Lyscom – a former Foreign Office diplomat who was once \"our man in Bratislava\" – has retired from the field, leaving this month with a severance package and confidentiality clause.\n\nNot only has the council, set up nearly 40 years ago to represent eight associations of heads, bursars and governors, lost two chief executives in three years, it has also seen the departure of its chairman, Dame Judith Mayhew Jonas, the New Zealand lawyer who oversaw both appointments.\n\nLeaderless and without strategic direction and a viable media team, the council is now fighting for its existence as one of its most powerful masters threatens to walk out and withdraw critical funding.\n\nIn a secret ballot, the heads of the big independent senior boys and co-educational schools have voted by more than 80% to pull out next month unless they see very substantial changes in the way the council conducts itself.\n\nEight associations for heads, bursars and governors fund the organisation in central London, but the loss of subscriptions from heads who belong to the powerful Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) would make a large dent in its income. Subscriptions from HMC – the heads of schools such as Eton, Harrow and Westminster – provide 40% of its £1.4m annual membership revenue.\n\nThe fragmentation of the independent sector, just when the coalition government is looking to it for leadership in curriculum innovation and the setting up of academies, would be a serious threat to its influence. But the council has angered many heads, who say it appears to be working to its own agenda. One told Education Guardian that the ISC was not so much an umbrella organisation, but more a poisonous \"Bulgarian\" umbrella, \"poking and prodding us in the back of the leg\".\n\nThe ISC did not wish to comment.\n\nQuite how a body set up to represent 1,200 schools could become so vilified is hard to understand. But the HMC says fundamental change is essential. This week, the associations are interviewing for a new chairman and looking closer to home, interviewing retiring heads they hope will be more in tune with their aspirations.\n\nThere will be redundancies, and a new, \"flatter\" structure at the council's headquarters in London. The post of chief executive is to be abolished and the job given to the new, part-time chairman. The restructuring has staved off the immediate threat. Ian Power, HMC's membership secretary, says the disquiet had been long lived. Headteachers had felt for several years that the council was not sufficiently representing their views to the government and the media and appeared to be making up its own policies. There were concerns about the growth in staff numbers as it expanded its empire, the cost of which was ultimately borne by schools and parents.\n\n\"The new chairman will be a part-time position and I expect it will be someone from an educational background,\" he says. \"The last government was very focused on regulation and the present one is focused on education and promoting excellence, which is where we want to be.\"\n\nSheila Cooper, the executive director of the Girls' Schools Association (GSA), welcomes the moves: \"The changes are designed to bring members closer together and to help us create a more streamlined organisation, better placed to represent the needs and views of our diverse sector,\" she says.\n\nBut according to Tim Hands, the headmaster of Magdalen College school, Oxford, and co-chairman of the HMC and GSA universities committee, both Parry and Lyscom were only following orders.\n\n\"The real problem was in the high command that first asked for warfare and then decided it wanted diplomacy,\" he says. \"Both are men of considerable qualities and high ability.\"\n\nCertainly Parry had lost no time in carrying out the job description. Just days into the job, he said that some state pupils were \"unteachable\" and had \"ignorant\" parents, though he has said that his words were taken out of context and that he was criticising government policies.\n\nHe went on to tell the Commons education select committee that standards in some state schools were \"offensive\" to parents such as he, who had no choice but to pay for private education. And he blamed some state school teachers ideologically opposed to private schooling for promoting a \"cold war\" between the two sectors.\n\nParry says that when he stepped down, he received more than 300 letters and emails of support from people within independent education.\n\nThe crisis comes at a difficult time, when schools are awaiting the verdict of their appeal to the Charity Tribunal over the way the Charity Commission assesses whether they provide sufficient public benefits to retain their charitable status. The council argues that the commission's guidelines put too much emphasis on bursaries for poor students that could push up fees and hurt lower-income parents.\n\nThere is also a wide range of views among heads and governors over the extent to which the independent sector should get involved in running academies. Already 28 independent schools are helping to run the flagship schools, but last month Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said there should be an expectation that all successful private schools should support an academy to spread their unique ethos, culture and thinking.\n\nAnd that could prove more costly than providing more bursaries to satisfy the Charity Commission."
