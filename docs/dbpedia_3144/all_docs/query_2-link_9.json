        "text": "Lizs is right. Also, public schools usually offer boarding (or are exclusively boarding) and generally are more expensive than private schools. They usually have bigger grounds. There are a lot of private schools, particularly girls' ones, which were founded in the late 19th century and thus are a similar age to some of the public schools, so I don't think age helps sort out which is which, really. Not all private schools are academically driven, either!\n\nPublic = big established name, traditionally favoured by the Establishment. Private = all others in the independent sector. Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Stowe, Westminster, Winchester etc. are all in the first group.\n\nRe. longetivity though, the GPDST (Girls' Public Day School Trust) was only founded in 1872 (unsurprising in the context of academically rigorous provision for girls). The 'P' for 'Public' was dropped in 1998. I think Public can only be of any significance in distinguishing between the old boys' foundations.\n\nWay back, schooling happened at home for the rich or through monks/clergy in religious institutions. \"Public\" meant simply \"'open to the public\" who could not afford home tutors or gain access to the educators in religious foundations. Ironically (given today's fees for the majority of pupils) their aim was often to educate poor scholars without access to education.\n\nIn the mid 1800's a review identified a small no of schools as public - Eton, Westminster, Charterhouse, Shrewsbury, Winchester - maybe a few others, (Rugby? I can't remember). Other old schools were not so categorised but I have no idea why. There were no girls' schools on the list though some girls' schools are referred to as public today in the media.\n\nSo it is a woolly concept I think. Today it tends to refer to the older, \"bigger\" names and suggests age and reputation and to some people and sense of grandeur perhaps? Other than historical interest, I don't think the term has any practical weight or meaning today with regard to the education and experience provided.\n\nIn brief, all public schools are independent but not all independent schools are referred to as public. The term \"private\" can include privately owned, for-profit schools.\n\nThere are definitely plenty of schools in the HMC that wouldn't be considered public. Probably the \"real\" public schools are those that are in the Eton Group or the Rugby Group (which are loose associations within the HMC) plus a few others. Of course it hardly matters - as slipshod says it just relates to age, history and the associated prestige that that has for some people.\n\nto me the diff between private and independent is easier to understand : i.e., there is no difference! just meaNS the same thing.\n\nBut i did think that not all private/independent schools are not Public Schools. And what everyone has said seems to confirm that. However, it does seem to be a woolly area..... the thing that sets Public Schools apart from the rest... the rest meaning private, state, grammar etc.\n\nYellowstone, no they are not strictly the first nine, though they are among the oldest, which is why I said I think it is a woolly concept. The choice of those 9 seems slightly random except that even then, they were well known names - and concentrated in the South East.\n\nThe act was a consequence of a review of the schools due to concerns over abuses and management (Victorian Ofstead?) and a decision to regulate their governance (ie give them an independent governing body to manage them).\n\nI checked and saw these links for those who might need the info for a pub quiz one day!\n\n//www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Schools_Act_1868\n\n//www.publicschools.co.uk/school-guide\n\nSo although it sounds grander than simply \"independent\", the term \"public\" does not have any special magic in itself except initially for the magical idea that education should be open to all and the formalization of the term in 1868 appears to arise from concerns about management.\n\nps cupofteainpeace, independent means independently managed (free of the state) but independet schools are managed by a governing body while private is a term which can sometimes (not always) refer to schools which are in private ownership and therefore provide profits for the owner. eg GEMS schools and several smaller private schools - often prep - scattered around.\n\nIn practice all these terms are mixed up with no harm done.\n\nDH & I had this conversation the other day!\n\nTechnically a school can be called a 'public school' if it is a member of the HMC. In reality, many independent schools don't call themselves 'public' as it more associated with the traditional/ older/ boys boarding schools.\n\nWe found it amusing to discover that both DH's old school, and DS1's school from Spet are both, technically, 'public schools'."
