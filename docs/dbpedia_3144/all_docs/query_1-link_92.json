        "text": "An independent public school is a public school that has demonstrated its capacity to use its increased flexibilities and responsibilities to make local decisions across a range of school operations to enhance education outcomes for students.\n\nThirteen schools have been selected and 2 new schools opening in 2024 will be doing so with independent public school (IPS) status. The IPS initiative has grown from 34 schools in 2010 to 639 as of Term 1 2024. For the full list of schools, refer to the independent public schools list below.\n\nIndependent research commissioned in 2015, School Autonomy: Building the Conditions for Student Success identifies the kind of leadership that links greater school autonomy with improvements in teaching and, ultimately, benefits for students.\n\nEach independent public school has a school board. The school staff, in collaboration with the board, establishes a vision for the school that reflects the aspirations and needs of the community. The board can have an important influence on the direction of the school, with members bringing ideas and lending their expertise to strategic planning and community partnerships.\n\nWhen establishing the board, the school can re-appoint members of the school council or seek new members from the community. Attracting people with a range of experiences and expertise enhances the board’s ability to make significant contribution to the development of the school. Board members are provided with support and training.\n\nThe principal signs a 'statement of expectation', which is noted and minuted by the school council or board at a meeting and then signed by the Director General. It outlines the expectations for each school for its strategic planning and self-assessment, to form part of the school’s Public School Review and the Principal’s Professional Performance Review.\n\nLike all public schools, principals of independent public schools must comply with relevant legislation, industrial agreements and whole of government policies and initiatives. These include but are not limited to:\n\nSchool Education Act 1999\n\nSchool Education Regulations 2000\n\nSchool Curriculum and Standards Authority Act 1997\n\nPublic Sector Management Act 1994\n\nFinancial Management Act 2006.\n\nApplying to become an independent public school is a decision made by each school, in consultation with the school council and local community. The school community must consider its capacity to take on the additional accountabilities of being an independent public school, the local community’s support for change and the school’s operational performance."
