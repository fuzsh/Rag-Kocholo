        "text": "Whether it be in the teaching of an idea, the celebration of a win, or the kind, warm guidance that all young people need when they are faced with a challenge, Westminster faculty members know that they hold the great responsibility and privilege of being an essential figure in a young person’s life.\n\n​Westminster deliberately searches for talented, passionate, kind and versatile teachers who have the knowledge and skills to contribute to all aspects of campus life. The hiring and retention of these educators is vital for offering a first-rate education in a character-building community.\n\nThe Soar Together Campaign is honoring the faculty members who are instrumental to the excellence of a Westminster education\n\nGenerations of Martlets often look back on faculty members who played a significant role in their growth and development during a formative time in their lives. The campaign is focused on ensuring that the quality of the Westminster faculty remains top-notch in the future. It also seeks to provide faculty members with the resources they need to do all that they do in their many roles on campus. Professional development opportunities and graduate studies allow faculty members to bring new knowledge, inspiration and energy into the classroom and other learning experiences for students.\n\nTravel grants allow faculty members to explore places of interest during the summer and return refreshed in the fall. Doubling this benefit from five to 10 grants per year will give even more faculty members the benefit of taking a step away from their everyday responsibilities to grow in new directions.\n\nEndowed Faculty Chairs Among Peer Schools\n\nWestminster has six endowed faculty chairs, while peer schools average 24. Faculty chairs for department heads and for master teachers make the crucial difference in offering competitive compensation when vying for the best educators in a discipline.\n\n​“Financial assistance with my graduate studies allowed me to attend Wesleyan and to walk in the steps of the Civil Rights Movement through an immersion course in Alabama. Meeting courageous and dedicated people and experiencing this complex history firsthand, fueled a deeper, more zealous approach to teaching this subject to my students.\"\n\nColleen Joncas\n\nHistory Teacher | faculty co-advisor for the gender sexuality alliance (gsa) | m.a.l.s. from Wesleyan University | appointed 2005\n\n“Incredible hiking, breathtaking cliffs, engaging hosts and live music are just a few of the highlights of my travel grant experience with Siobhan. Ireland was the perfect location for rejuvenation. Even the rain couldn’t dampen our enthusiasm for this charming country.\"\n\n​Peter Ulrich\n\nMath teacher | squash, lacrosse and soccer coach | member of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics | travel grant 2017 | appointed 1996\n\n“Taking a sabbatical in 1996-97, allowed me to participate in a Klingenstein Fellowship which, in turn, permitted me to study at both Teachers College and Columbia University. This dynamic educational experience served as a foundation both for various Westminster initiatives and programs that serve as a bridge from Williams Hill to the residents of Hartford and back.”​\n\nTodd Eckerson\n\nhistory teacher | founder CCLP and WCLP programs | former dean of faculty, football and lacrosse coach | appointed 1982\n\n“The recognition and kind support of the Donald H. Werner Chair in English gives me a great sense of being valued. As a teacher-coach, I have always believed that the line where the field ends and the classroom begins is a hazy one. It is a tremendous privilege to work in both spaces to develop our students’ characters, minds and lives.”\n\nLawrence Court​\n\nEnglish department chair | Donald H. Werner chair in English |co-advisor The Westminster News | field hockey coach | appointed 2016\n\nWestminster takes pride in the twenty distinguished faculty whose long-term dedication of twenty years or more to our community has helped the martlets of yesterday and today soar."
