        "text": "An overview of the Independent Schools Council, its information services and its constituent associations of independent schools, their heads, bursars and governors\n\nChoosing a boarding school takes time, and careful research is essential if the right decisions are to be made. When beginning your search, it is helpful to have an understanding of the associations and organisations that provide advice and information on independent boarding schools in the UK.\n\nThe Independent Schools Council (ISC)\n\nThe Independent Schools Council (ISC) brings seven associations together to represent 1,374 independent schools in the UK. These schools are ranked among the best in the world and educate more than half a million children each year, around 59% of independently educated pupils.\n\nThe ISC works with its members to promote and preserve the quality, diversity and excellence of UK independent education both at home and abroad. Boarding schools continue to be popular in the 21st century, offering exceptional education and extracurricular activities with round-the-clock pastoral care. 69,680 pupils board at ISC schools, making up 13% of total pupil numbers, and 474 ISC schools (34.5% of the total) have at least one boarding pupil.\n\nParents can consult the ISC website for more information about the independent schools in its membership, including information about boarding where it is offered. Each school is a member of one or more of the following associations, which will be able to help with enquiries. Further organisations are affiliate members of the ISC, including the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, the Welsh Independent Schools Council, the Boarding Schools’ Association and COBIS.\n\nThe Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC)\n\nAn organisation of heads of boys’, girls’ and co-educational senior schools\n\nHMC is made up of the headteachers (not the schools themselves) of 295 senior schools. It was founded in 1869, and exists to serve and support its members, to represent their views and to exemplify excellence in education. In particular, HMC seeks to: help heads to be more effective as leaders and managers; promote the discussion of national and international educational issues; and influence national policy and public opinion with regard to the independent sector. Members meet termly in geographical regions and once a year at the Annual Conference.\n\nWell over one third of HMC schools consist mainly of boarders, whilst others have a smaller boarding element. Most schools are noted for their academic excellence, with around 89% of pupils going on to higher education. Only the heads of those schools that meet the rigorous membership criteria are admitted. Bursaries and scholarships provided by the schools give over a third of the 240,373 pupils in HMC schools help with their fees. About 45,000 pupils are boarders.\n\nAll HMC schools are happy to receive direct enquiries. Other enquiries should be addressed to: Mike Buchanan, HMC, 12 The Point, Rockingham Road, Market Harborough, Leicestershire LE16 7QU, Tel: +44 (0)1858 469059, E-mail: info@hmc.org.uk, Web: www.hmc.org.uk\n\nThe Society of Heads\n\nThe Society of Heads (formerly SHMIS) is an organisation currently comprising 110 heads of boys’, girls’ and co-educational senior schools, most of which are smaller independent schools with a tradition of boarding, and which educate some 49,000 pupils. The Society was founded in 1961 to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and the pursuit of excellence in all spheres of school life. The Society also ensures that schools are inspected regularly, provides training opportunities for staff and promotes links with higher education.\n\nAll member schools provide education up to 18, with some sixth forms offering the IB or vocational courses alongside a wide range of AS- and A-levels. Many have junior schools attached. A number cater for pupils with special educational needs or for gifted dancers and musicians.\n\nYou can send enquiries about the Society of Heads to: Clive Rickart, CEO, The Society of Heads, 12 The Point, Rockingham Road, Market Harborough, Leicestershire LE16 7QU, Tel: +44 (0)1858 433760, E-mail: info@thesocietyofheads.org.uk, Web: www.thesocietyofheads.org.uk\n\nThe Girls’ Schools Association (GSA)\n\nThe GSA represents the heads of many of the top performing day and boarding schools in the UK independent schools sector. It exists to support its members with a wide variety of professional development courses, mentoring and networking opportunities, to share best practice in educating girls.\n\nApproximately 40% of GSA schools provide full boarding facilities and the majority of these also offer flexi boarding, where pupils spend part of the week as a day pupil and part as a boarder. Innovative practice and academic rigor attract pupils from around the world.\n\nAcademic performance is impressive, with 96% of students progressing to university. Nevertheless, GSA schools are just as likely to encourage excellence outside the classroom with an impressive choice of extra-curricular activities. Former GSA school pupils are among the most noteworthy high achievers of the UK and indeed the world. They include world leading scientists, international charity campaigners, famous actresses, war correspondents, Olympic medallists and business women at the highest levels. GSA schools are committed to improving and enabling access, with a third of existing students receiving help with their fees.\n\nFor more information contact: Vivienne Durham, Executive Director, Girls’ Schools Association, Suite 105, 108 New Walk, Leicester, LE1 7EA, Tel: +44 (0)116 254 1619, E-mail: office@gsa.uk.com, Web: www.gsa.uk.com\n\nThe Independent Association of Prep Schools (IAPS)\n\nIAPS is the leading professional body for heads of independent prep schools\n\nIAPS has over 600 of the world’s leading schools in membership, both in the UK and overseas. The Association actively promotes the interests of both its members and the sector as a whole, and. provides professional support and advice to its members schools on a variety of issues including curriculum, assessment, classroom and school organisation, and employment matters.

It works in conjunction with other professional bodies in order to maintain due recognition for independent schools by the UK Government and the public.\n\nFor more information, contact: Neil Roskilly, Chief Executive Officer, ISA House, 5-7 Great Chesterford Court, Great Chesterford, CB10 1PF, Tel: +44 (0)1799 523619, E-mail: isa@isaschools.org.uk, Web: www.isaschools.org.uk\n\nThe Association of Governing Bodies of Independent Schools (AGBIS)\n\nAGBIS provides advice and guidance to governing bodies of member schools; governors of all schools can access AGBIS training and attend seminars\n\nMembership of AGBIS is available to those schools in UK whose heads belong to HMC, GSA, IAPS, ISA or the Society of Heads, and who meet the current membership criteria, subject to the approval of the AGBIS Board.

Associate membership is open to other educational providers or independent schools, which are not separately constituted.
