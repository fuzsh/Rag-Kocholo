        "text": "Details\n\nType of school: Co-Ed | Senior school with a junior department or a prep school\n\nNearest international airport: Gatwick\n\nAge Range: 0–18\n\nNumber of pupils: 800\n\nNumber of boarders: 200\n\n£ Fees per term - Boarding: 10,676 - 14,692\n\n£ Fees per term -Day: 6,902 - 7,936\n\nSchool Information\n\nSchool Information\n\nKent College is an outstanding day and boarding school that celebrates both its 140 years of history and tradition, and its forward-looking, innovative approach to education. It has a reputation as a friendly school, and is most definitely a place where teachers really get to know the pupils, with the time and space to give individual attention, both academically and pastorally. Music, drama and sport all play central roles in the life of the school, and many pupils also enjoy the opportunities provided by the school’s Farm and Riding Centre. Part of the Methodist Schools group, Kent College is deeply rooted in the Methodist tradition that welcomes all pupils of every faith and none. ‘Do all the good you can do’ is a guiding principle, and one that allows pupils to develop into confident young adults, aware of their responsibilities and their place in the world.\n\nLocation\n\nThe school’s location, on the outskirts of the historic city of Canterbury, provides a safe, healthy and beautiful environment for pupils to grow up. The school sits in 80 acres (32 hectares) of land with extensive sports fields, as well as the Farm and Riding Centre. Yet the centre of Canterbury, with its wide selection of shops, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and world-heritage site, within which sits Canterbury Cathedral, is only a 5-minute journey by car. A high-speed train service links Canterbury to London, and the school is within 100 minutes of Gatwick, Heathrow, Stansted and City of London airports.\n\nBoarding\n\nKent College has a long history of welcoming boarding pupils from abroad, as well as from British families resident in the UK or working overseas. Kent College Canterbury Boarders make up around one third of pupils, and there are over 40 countries represented in the boarding community. The five friendly and comfortable Senior boarding houses truly become a ‘home away from home’. The school also offers weekly and occasional boarding.\n\nAcademic Success\n\nThe bespoke approach to the curriculum differentiates the college’s approach and ensures highly personalised teaching resulting in excellent results. The school regularly ranks in the top 10 small cohort schools for the International Baccalaureate with an average score of 37 for the last 7 years. 77% of students achieve A* – B at A-level and 98% of students regularly go to their first university of choice.\n\nBeyond the classroom\n\nThe performing arts are a particular strength at Kent College, with an impressive line-up of vocal and instrumental ensembles, and many opportunities to perform for all ages and abilities. Our Great Hall is a state-of-the-art 600-seat auditorium for the performing arts. In sport, the aim is to provide something for every pupil, from recreational sport and promoting fitness to top-level coaching for our elite players. Kent College teams make formidable competitors in any sport. Hockey and cricket are a particular strength with regular representation by our pupils in county, regional and national squads. The School’s scholarship programme offers talented individuals individual support in art, design, drama, music and sport. There is also a wide-ranging list of activities and clubs, on offer for all pupils, including a full Duke of Edinburgh programme, horse riding and Farm Club at the School Farm.\n\n“Helping pupils to build a strong work ethic, and to develop the confidence to excel in their\n\nchosen fields.” – Kent College\n\nScholarships and Bursaries\n\nKent College has a long tradition of recognising and rewarding outstanding ability by awarding scholarships for academic achievement, the IB Diploma (Year 12 only), and in Art, Design (Years 9 and 12 only) Drama, Music and Sport. Scholarships are designed to attract talented pupils from all backgrounds who would benefit from the unique educational experience offered by Kent College. The school undertakes to nurture and develop a scholar’s talent; in return scholars are expected to make a significant contribution to school life. Scholarships are offered to pupils at Year 7 (age 11+), Year 9 (age 13+) and Year 12 (age 16+). As a member of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), the group of schools that includes the top independent schools in the country, it is agreed that the maximum amount of scholarship available will be 50% of tuition fees. It is possible to be awarded a scholarship in more than one area but the maximum overall value will not exceed 50%. Means-tested bursaries may also be offered in addition to scholarships, and further information is available from the Admissions office admissions@kentcollege.co.uk or call +44 (0)1227 763231.\n\nStudent Profile\n\nAnna – Studying A Levels\n\nMy name is Anna and I'm a Year 13 student at Kent College Canterbury. I'm currently studying A Levels in English Literature, Mathematics and Music. In the Sixth Form learning is much more focused on independence. It enables you to gain independent research skills and take agency over your work. My plan for the future is to study English literature at University. I've currently got an offer from Oxford University with a Coral Scholarship. Kent College is absolutely what you make it, it’s what you get involved in, so don't be afraid to say yes. If I had to describe KC in three words I would say: inclusive, friendly and ambitious.\n\nFrancesco – Studying IB\n\nMy name is Francesco, and I come from Italy. This is my second year at Kent College and I'm studying the IB. What I like most about KC is the international nature of the school and that gave me the opp ortunity to meet new people from all around the world. I joined in Sixth Form last year and was nervous because I couldn't speak English well, but I've met lots of people espec ially in The Boarding Houses who have helped me to develop and improve. Within the IB I study six subjects: three at higher level and three at standard level, plus theory of knowledge and other extracurricular activities. Due to the depth and length of the course I have really developed my independent study skills and organisational skills. My plan for the future is to go to University, particularly King's College as I have an offer. If I had to describe KC in three words I would say: inclusive, international and home.\n\nAddress Whitstable Road\n\nBorough Canterbury\n\nZip/Postal Code CT2 9DT\n\nPhone: +44 (0)1227 813906\n\nFax: +44 (0)1227 813906\n\nEmail: admissions@kentcollege.co.uk\n\nWebsite: https://kentcollege.com\n\nNews\n\nKent College, Canterbury judged ‘Excellent’ in all aspects\n\nAt the recent inspection conducted by the Independent Schools Inspectorate both the KC Junior school at Harbledown and the Senior school in Canterbury were judged as excellent in all aspects, the highest grade possible.
