        "text": "A proud institution located in protected green belt land in North Dublin, Castleknock College has been one of the country’s premier private schools since its foundation in 1835. The school was traditionally a boarding school but began accepting day students in 1987 before closing the boarding section in 2004. The school has a national reputation for sports and academic performance, particularly in the sciences, and is considered to be one of the major independent schools in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe Abbey is a highly-rated, girls only selective day school located in Reading, near London. The school offers education from nursery through to Sixth Form and is a member of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference and the Girls’ Schools Association. It is a fee-paying private school (independent school).\n\nAbingdon School is an ancient, famous public school located just outside of Oxford in the pretty town of Abingdon. The school was founded many hundreds of years ago (at least as early as 1256) and has operated as one of the nation’s leading endowed grammar schools.\n\nThe Tilst campus of the famous Aarhus Gymnasium (previously known as Langkær Gymnasium & HF) is regarded as one of Denmark’s, indeed Europe’s, best state schools. Aarhus Gymnasium, Tilst, offers a rigorous education to only the most highly capable pupils in the classic gymnasium tradition and has done since its foundation in 1968.\n\nAppleby College is one of Canada’s most famous boarding schools with a global reputation. The school, located approximately midway between Toronto and Hamilton on the shores of Lake Ontario, was established in 1911 and has been one of North America’s leading private schools since. The school boasts two campuses, with the second being a private island retreat. Appleby is a member of the prestigious G30 network; the Round Square international association; and the World Leading Schools Association, with membership of either being restricted only to the very best globally-minded and academically rigorous schools in the world.\n\nDulwich College is a world-famous boarding school founded in 1619. Located in a well-to-do enclave in South East London, Dulwich College attracts pupils from across South London, the United Kingdom and overseas and has forged a global reputation for academic and sporting excellence. Today, Dulwich College represents the very best of the English public school model, a model which it has successfully replicated with partner schools established in various new markets under the Dulwich International brand.\n\nAldenham School is a very well-regarded independent school that offers an excellent education to pupils from the ages of 3 – 18 in a co-educational setting. The school accommodates boarders from the ages of 11 up with some 25% of secondary pupils residing at the school. Aldenham has a number of highly acclaimed sports programmes which have seen a number of pupils achieving national honours in their respective fields.\n\nThe Academy of Saint Elizabeth is a revered college-preparatory high school for girls located in Convent Station New Jersey, at the edge of the New York Metropolitan Area. It is a leading Catholic school for young women with a history that dates back to 1860. The school was initially founded as a boarding school and continued as such until 1870, however, it has always attracted a significant number of admissions from well-to-do Catholic families in the affluent neighbourhood in which it is located. It is still regarded as one of the most prestigious girls’ faith schools on the East Coast.\n\nWycombe Abbey School is considered to be amongst the finest examples of girls’ boarding schools in the English Public School tradition. It is often considered to be the sister school to Eton College with a reputation on a similar par. Wycombe Abbey has, historically, been one of the preferred schools for the daughters of the English aristocratic classes, however, it is a modern dynamic school that offers a broad and varied education for young women leaders."
