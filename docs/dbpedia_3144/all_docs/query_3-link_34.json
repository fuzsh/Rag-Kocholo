        "text": "The Independent Schools Inspectorate is the body responsible for the inspection of schools in membership of the Associations that make up the Independent Schools Council. They are approved for the purpose of inspection under Section 162A of the Education Act 2002, and report to the Department for Education on the extent to which schools meet statutory requirements.\n\nISI inspection is for the benefit of pupils and seeks to improve the quality and effectiveness of their education and of the care for their welfare. Schools in the Association are ranked among the best in the world.\n\nIn fact, our schools in Madrid, are the only schools in the Spanish capital who undergo a regular and thorough ISI inspection once every 3 years.\n\nhttp://www.isi.net/\n\nThe British Schools Overseas (BSO) scheme is a government approved inspectorate overseen by Ofsted which has been running for about four years and over that time has seen a steady growth in the number of schools wishing to participate. There are now over 80 schools across the world with a current positive inspection report, and some that are now embarking on their second inspection.\n\nThe BSO State Emblem signifies that our schools have been inspected against the UK Department for Education (DfE) standards for British Schools Overseas (BSOs). We currently operate four of eighty schools across the world that hold a current positive inspection report:\n\nKing’s College, Alicante\n\nKing’s College\n\nFor more information please visit: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-schools-overseas-standards-for-schools\n\nThe National Association of British Schools in Spain (NABSS) exists to defend members’ interests, to help maintain the quality of British education in Spain, and to support school development. All member schools are fully authorised- at least for a large section of the school-and are subject to inspection.\n\nNABSS offers regular training to schools and there is an annual conference. The Association has its own inspection system, which is recognised by the British Council, and which also forms part of the British Schools Overseas inspections within Spain.\n\nhttp://www.nabss.org/\n\nHMC (the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference) is a professional Association of Heads from the world’s leading independent schools.\n\nHMC’s schools are individual and distinctive offering parents a rich variety of options when choosing the right education for their child. But, at the heart of every HMC school is a commitment to the benefits of an holistic educational experience: academic excellence coupled with a strong emphasis on pastoral care and exceptional co-curricular opportunities.\n\nHMC exists to serve and support its members, to represent their views and to exemplify excellence in education.\n\nhttp://www.hmc.org.uk/\n\nCICAE es una asociación de Colegios privados independientes de ámbito internacional, que tiene como fin esencial la defensa de la educación libre e independiente en España.\n\nLa fundación de CICAE está basada en la inquietud de un grupo de profesionales de la enseñanza privada por la situación de la educación en España en general y para la mejor defensa de su espacio de actuación en particular.\n\nCICAE is an association of independent, private schools, whose aim is to defend free and independent education in Spain.\n\nThe CICAE foundation is based on the anxiety of a group of private school teachers regarding the current situation of Spanish education in general as well as the want to better protect their own particular work area.\n\nhttp://www.cicae.es/"
