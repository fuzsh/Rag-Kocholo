Prestigious and highly competitive for entry, it was established in 1619 and caters for approximately 1,750 pupils. Dulwich College is a member of both the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference and the Eton Group. [1]\n\nCurriculum: Nurturing natural talent alongside hard work and effort, the teaching provision fully corresponds with pupils’ needs for academic and non-academic development. The inspiring syllabus features a number of disciplines, from science and languages to humanities and technology, encouraging boys to boost their curiosity and intellectual agility through active participation in the educational experience.\n\nCo-curricular: Although in-class learning is at the heart of the school’s philosophy, great emphasis is placed on enrichment activities, as well. In line with the Dulwich culture of enthusiasm and innovation, boys are urged to partake in over 50 clubs and societies, ranging from Climate Change Society, engineering and coding to Race Activism, philosophy and debating.\n\nPastoral care: Pupils’ progress across all areas is carefully monitored by experienced and dedicated staff, who ensure that parents are fully involved in resolving any pastoral or academic issues their child may be facing. Housemasters closely monitor boys’ participation in co-curricular life, securing the continuity of their all-round development. [2]\n\nThe school’s rich history and impressive portfolio of exemplary academic outcomes were utilised by many notable alumni who have left their mark in the areas of science, politics, finances and literature.
