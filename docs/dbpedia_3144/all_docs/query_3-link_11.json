        "text": "A special congratulations to Oliver Tuggey, student at Bradford Grammar School, who achieved straight As in his A Levels & demonstrated a commitment to making a meaningful difference during his A-Levels and last year he became a lifesaving stem cell donor through charity Anthony Nolan after times of personal loss. https://buff.ly/3SQwdLo Dr Simon Hinchliffe, headmaster at Bradford Grammar School, said: \"Oliver’s achievements are a profound testament to his character and dedication. \"His academic success is remarkable, but it’s his extraordinary commitment to helping others that truly sets him apart.” #ALevelResults\n\nA special congraulations to Olha Volianyk, a Newcastle-based teenager who had to flee her home in Ukraine because of the Ukrainian invasion is set to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) after achieving top A-level grades. Geoffrey Stanford, headmaster at Royal Grammar School Newcastle, added: “Olha deserves special recognition for the circumstances under which she has been studying for the last two years. She is a truly remarkable young woman who has inspired her peers as well as the whole school community, through her passion for her subjects, her determination and dream to help support her home country.”\n\nA special congratulations to Francesca Morgan, a sixth-form student at Dame Allan's Schools who sadly lost the mother who homeschooled her to cancer weeks before sitting her A-levels. Francesca is now going to the University of Cambridge after achieving straight A*s. https://buff.ly/4dnFS4w Will Scott, Principal at Dame Allan’s Schools, said: “Francesca’s achievements are nothing short of extraordinary, especially considering the challenging circumstances she faced. Her resilience, determination and academic excellence have been truly inspiring. “She has not only excelled in her studies but also demonstrated incredible strength of character.” #ALevelResults\n\nA special congratulations to Anna Ursakii, student at Brighton College and Ukrainian refugee who survived air raids in Kyiv before moving to the UK who has achieved four A* in her A-levels. Anna will now study natural sciences at Clare College, Cambridge. It's wonderful to see achievements like this in times of real hardship. Richard Cairns, Principal at Brighton College, said: “So many Ukrainian youngsters have had their whole lives entirely upended by this terrible war, and the story of Anna gives a glimmer of hope for the future. “I am so proud of this remarkable young woman, and am just glad that we were able to help her a little along the way.” https://buff.ly/3X9Icqc #ALevelResults\n\nAt HMC we would like to wish everyone collecting their #ALevel and other Level 3 #examresults today the very best of luck. Congratulations to students, teachers and examiners on all of their hard work.\n\nFinally from Australia: this is Pip Vice, Headmaster’s secretary at Grammar. HMC would like to thank her & the many other PAs & secretaries who have contributed to making the tour of Australia such a success. Without their support a trip like this would not have been possible\n\nKate Howell, HMC’s Director of Education was able to spend some time with Becky Lovelock, Grammar’s Academic Deputy discussing topics from the use of technology in classrooms to 6-day timetables and rank-order assessment. As a selective boys’ school of 1200 pupils from Y7 and with two primary settings, Grammar has long ranked as one of Australia’s finest schools."
