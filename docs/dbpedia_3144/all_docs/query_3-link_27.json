        "text": "The place? A large co-educational independent day school somewhere in the North West of England. The time? Two days before the end of the summer term 2004. The fifth form are back in school, and the natives are restless. In a desperate attempt to stem riot, the quick-thinking deputy head invents a general knowledge quiz. Fifth form versus staff. Out of nowhere the physics department create six electronic buzzers each carrying a charge sufficient to power the electric chair at Alcatraz. The score is 15-15, the bell about to ring. It is the final question. The atmosphere is indescribably tense. A young boy who is 15 but looks 11 is so keen to win that he seems to be actually contorting his body in his eagerness to be first to the buzzer. The final question comes.\n\n'What film title combines the most important human emotion with the most important human body organ?'\n\nThe intended answer is Braveheart. The 15 year-old boy cannot restrain himself, hits the buzzer before the last syllable has been uttered by the question master.\n\nHis answer? Free Willie.\n\nI share one thing with that story. A very important human emotion underpins most of what I want to say today. The emotion might surprise you. It is anger.\n\nI would like to look in two opposite directions-inwards, to HMC itself, what we are and what we do, and then outwards, to the national education system of which we are a part, with which we are in a totally symbiotic relationship.\n\nFor a long while I was one of HMC's angry brigade. My first conference was held at Churchill College, Cambridge. Living locally I arrived late. Far too scared to walk in past the terrifying gaze of 245 distinguished members, I went to hide in the bar. As I entered I recognised, as luck would have it, the then-high master of St Paul's School. He was talking to another man, and as I entered the bar he turned to me, waved an imperious hand and said: \"Make mine a gin and tonic!\"\n\nWell, what does a chap do? I thought this was clearly a tradition in HMC that new members bought a gin and tonic for the high master of St Paul's. And I have to say that, on reflection, it's not such a bad idea at all really... I went to the bar, bought two gin and tonics. It wasn't until I handed over one of them and the high master handed me a five pound note that I realised he thought I was the waiter.\n\nThat was actually the highest status HMC afforded me for many years. Conference seemed to me an event where people were permanently looking over the shoulder of whoever they were talking with to see if anyone more important was nearby. Conference after conference left me with a strange feeling that somewhere something very important was happening, but I didn't know where it was and I certainly wasn't at it. Well, let me reassure new members. Absolutely nothing of any importance is happening at all, and even if it is the chairman doesn't know anything about it either.\n\nThe problem wasn't that HMC seemed to be a club, or that it seemed to be a professional organisation. It was that it didn't seem to be doing either very well.\n\nHave we got better? Or am I suffering from a reverse Victor Meldrew effect, a familiarity that breeds acceptance after 18 years of membership? For all my sense that HMC has got better there is one illness that we have to be permanently on guard against. It is to judge a head by the perceived standing and status of his or her school.\n\nHeadship is an informed lottery, a random conjoining of planets where a headship becomes available and a limited number of people at that particular time are available and willing to move. Some of our best colleagues never become heads, for all their huge talents. Some of our best heads work in schools that are not household names. Some of our youngest heads have the freshest and most vigorous ideas.\n\nExperience can be a wonderful thing, but how many people claim 33 years experience when actually all that has happened is that they have repeated the same experience 33 times? As for household names, heaven forbid that we should ever deny the value and the worth of those independent schools whose names have become part of our language and culture. We need flagships, and I do not think we should allow cancerous politics of envy into HMC.\n\nYet it's the fleet and not the flagship that wins the battle - though like Victory at Trafalgar, sometimes the flagship has to take the really hard knocks. In survey after survey the British public have refused to condemn independent schools. Why? Because the vast majority of HMC schools are neither rich nor famous, but do an outstanding job for their local community in a manner which wins both hearts and minds.\n\nWe are elected to HMC as individual heads. Let's stop referring to ourselves by the names of our schools. Let us join HMC as the individuals we are. Let HMC recognise that the very best of heads might well reside in a school damned by the league tables or relatively unheard of outside its own catchment area. Let HMC say once and for all: \"All heads are equal.\"\n\nLet us renounce the Orwellian addendum: \"Yet some heads are more equal than others.\"\n\nSecondly, if HMC is to change for the better, it needs to get rid of people like me. I cannot tell you what a privilege it has been to be chairman for this year, or how much I have enjoyed it, or how grateful I am for the warmth of the welcome divisions and individual schools have given me on my travels north, east, south and west.\n\nYet even as I have lapped up the honour you afforded me in electing me a chairman my every professional sense has been screaming at me that this is no longer the way to do it.\n\nThe best analogy is the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. These are ancient, privileged institutions with a world-wide reputation, increasingly under threat for doing what they do too well. They also consist of fiercely independent colleges, unwilling to sacrifice their individuality unless a real benefit for the greater good can be seen.\n\nThe comparison with HMC and its fiercely individual and independent membership is obvious. The colleges of Oxford and Cambridge have had to learn the hard - and sometimes even the reluctant - way that they are part of a greater thing called the university. So are we part of a greater thing called the independent sector.\n\nTheir response? To move from appointing a vice-chancellor as a serving head of house on a short-term contract, to the recognition that the post of vice-chancellor should be a salaried and permanent post.\n\nOf course it is easier to leave things as they are, get by, stay in the comfort zone, make do and boost the role of the secretaries. Of course, each one of us runs a school that takes our heart and our soul, as well as endless amounts of time, and consumes our every living and sometimes our every sleeping hour, and HMC can sometimes seem a huge irrelevance.\n\nYet we need to add up to more than the sum of our individual parts, great though those individual parts are. What of the 70 days your chairman needs to be out of school? What of all the links and the contacts and the knowledge built up so painfully for the year of office and then thrown away? What of the increasing number of heads whose governors will not let them stand for chairmanship?\n\nIt angers me that HMC will forever be an amateur organisation until we bite the bullet and accept that appointing a serving head for a year is not enough for the increasingly adversarial world we inhabit. If you wish us to be a professional organisation, an organisation that can fight your corner at every level and in every forum, don't ask your spokesman to do it as a part-timer whose school has first call on his or her time. Appoint someone with recent headship experience for three or five years on a head's salary.\n\nI have asked the membership sub-committee to appoint a working party to report on the various options available to HMC for chairman. If you would like to be a member of this working party, please submit your name to Roger Peel before the end of this conference.\n\nThirdly, I am angered by league tables.\n\nI cut my milk teeth as a teacher in a boarding school with a mixed intake. It was, and is, a superb school. If you were a candidate for Oxbridge, it would give you the most stimulating teaching imaginable. If you weren't quite up to that mark, it did a magnificent job of getting you what was then a B grade and would now be an A grade.\n\nAnd if you had to work really, really hard to get A-levels at all, well - very few of its pupils failed, and that school did every bit as much for its less gifted pupils as it did for the all stars.\n\nAnd the league tables crucified it when they first came out, because the third of its pupils who worked their socks off to get E or D grades don't matter as far as league tables are concerned - but they mattered one helluvva lot to the pupils who got them. Why should such a brilliant school be labelled fourth division?\n\nI have been lucky to be head of three academically selective schools. None of them have been harmed in their reputation by the league tables. So why have I described them as a cancer on the face of education? Because they do not tell the truth about our schools.\n\nI am quite angry with us, HMC. We have not bitten the bullet on league tables.We rush to condemn league tables almost as fast as we rush to provide the information on which they are based. We declare that all schools will submit their results, and look on whilst a significant number refuse to do so. We insist on publishing our results in August, when some school's results will change by up to 10%, and by publishing in the silly season for journalism guarantee that they receive the highest priority. Member schools offering the IB feel they are hard-done-by, and so break ranks and publish their results in the way that they think reflects best upon themselves.\n\nIt is a mess. We have given up the driver's seat to the media.\n\nNow we have an opportunity to change all that. At our AGM we will be discussing a suggestion that came direct from HMC north east division, a way of publishing our results that fits our agenda and demands that our results are placed in the context of the school at which they were obtained. For once, we have a chance to help dictate the agenda for league tables. For once, can we start to drive and cease to be driven?\n\nMy final point of internal housekeeping? In the past year, one of our members has been quoted as saying that in due course of time independent schools should 'wither on the vine'. Another has stated that we should 'put our heads below the parapet' and refuse to speak out on such issues as political interference with the award of A level grades and discrimination against our pupils from leading Universities, because it leads to us being criticised.\n\nI am angry with being on the back foot, when for 33 years I have taught in outstanding schools, schools that international surveys suggest are among the best in the world. I am angry with the politics of envy. I am angry at being asked to fight the 1930's class war in schools that have moved firmly-and far more firmly' than many of their critics - into 2004 and beyond. Isn't it time we went on the offensive?\n\nHalf the children of manual workers who gain places at Cambridge attend independent schools.\n\nThirty eight per cent of the A grades at A-level achieved by school candidates are from independent schools.\n\nBetween 25 and 30 per cent of school pupils studying the hard sciences attend independent schools.\n\nNearly a third of pupils in our sector receive support with their fees.\n\nIndependent schools have continued to carry the flag for sport, for drama, for music, for art, for community service as part of a truly liberal education.\n\nHeads below the parapet? We should be leading the charge on behalf of education.\n\nWither on the vine? Kill the grape because it's too successful at its job? I think it is time we stopped apologising for ourselves. I am proud of the independent sector. I am proud of my own school. I am proud of the schools I have been privileged to visit as your chairman. Of course we're not perfect. But it is those who criticise us who ought to feel on the defensive.\n\nYet we need to continue to earn that pride of place by what we contribute. We need to redefine how independent schools are seen in the UK. We must act as the guardian of tradition: uniform, house systems or the crucial role of music, drama and competitive sport in education. Yet we must also operate at the other end of the spectrum, as the sharp and testing edge of innovation, be it in ICT usage, pastoral systems and exciting ways to teach science.\n\nGuardians of certain educational values? Yes, but also innovators and experimenters. And something else - the sector of British education that through harsh commercial necessity must listen longest and hardest to parents.\n\nAnd if we are to take a proper pride in what we are and what we do, it follows on logically that is why every parent and child in the UK should have the chance to attend an independent school regardless of the race, colour, creed, social or economic standing of their parents. In a world where the mixed economy is the norm, it is madness for government not to buy places in our schools.\n\nAnd does government buying places at independent schools damage the maintained sector? The success of the Perse School, where I was head, did not seem to damage the fortunes of Hills Road sixth form college, or Cambridge's magnificent village colleges. Perhaps even the competition kept both of us on our toes. The presence of Manchester grammar school, where I was also head, did not damage Parrs Wood high school in achieving its outstanding results. And I am not aware that St Paul's school has harmed the prospects of Telford school, equally sponsored by the Mercers' company, and one of the highest-achieving schools in the country. There is room for more than one type of excellence in our educational system.\n\nAnd I suppose in saying what I have just said I have crossed the boundary from looking inwards to looking outwards, to the wider picture for education in our country.\n\nI feel an anger that our education system seems to have regressed in terms of its ability to send disadvantaged pupils to university. As the recipient of wonderful education at a provincial university in the 1960's I cannot remember meeting another public schoolboy or girl in my three years of superb education.\n\nI was lucky enough recently to be allowed for two years to teach third-year undergraduates for one of their English literature degree modules at a leading university. Those students were among the most impressive bunch of young people I have ever met, a delight to know and to teach. My seminar groups at university had a maximum of six students. My seminar group last year had 26 students in it, a larger class size than many independent schools would allow at the age of 11 or 13. Is this progress? Was I right to feel anger on their behalf?\n\nDo you feel that we live in a world where the script is being written by a strange combination of Lewis Carroll and Franz Kafka? We are seeking to send more and more young people to university and bemoaning the fact that young people from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds do not make it, whilst at the same time we are making it prohibitively expensive for just these young people to gain a degree.\n\nThe independent sector is attacked as a bastion of privilege, yet the direct grant scheme was responsible for sending more disadvantaged and working class children to top universities than any scheme before or since, and even without government funding our sector has an extraordinary record in enabling the disadvantaged by its bursary schemes.\n\nWe bemoan teacher shortages, but ensure that a young teacher coming into the profession from university will now start life with a debt significantly bigger than their annual salary. Graduates earn more, we are told - the figures misleadingly based on a time when far fewer people graduated - but are not told how much more they pay. How long can we view ability as a resource to be taxed? How long before we view ability as this country's one remaining natural resource, and therefore not so much a taxable asset as a delicate crop to be nurtured?\n\nDo you share not so much my anger as my incredulity at the idea that 50% of young people should go to university? Not because I believe of necessity that figure is wrong. Rather because the figure seems to have been picked out of a hat by a spin doctor for entirely political reasons - it does sound good, doesn't it? - and to be based on no substantive research whatsoever.\n\nDouglas Adams, the author of a Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy would recognise the situation we are in. He posited a world in which billions are spent on designing a great computer to answer the great question of life, the universe and everything. To the bemusement of humanity, the answer is revealed as 47. Complaining loudly, the human race is told that the answer is right; it's just that they asked the wrong question.\n\nSurely before we send 50% of our young people to university - which may or may not be the correct answer - we first of all need to ask the right questions: how many graduates, and in what disciplines, does our society need? How many are we going to be able to employ?\n\nAs well as arguing for just that research, I would like to ask your support for three other ideas.\n\nFollow the link below to read the rest of the speech."
