        "text": "English is in a state of flux with regard to the use of gender-differentiated terms for professions and nationalities. For some speakers (like my parents), female terms must be used when the referent is known to be female. Such speakers have to say she is a waitress, not she is a waiter.\n\nHowever, for other speakers (like me), words like waitress, actress, and Frenchwoman are, like scrumptious and copacetic, recognisable as English but usable only with ironic or pedantic undertones. I would comfortably say she is a waiter to refer to what my parents call a waitress.\n\nNot all such words have deteriorated at the same rate. Where the female versions themselves refer to outmoded or old-fashioned professions or roles, I am happy to use the feminine, for instance, washerwoman or nun. (But I would only use nun to refer a Christian. In the past, I’ve referred to a Buddhist nun as a monk, leading an academic colleague to think I’d mistaken the woman for a man, because of her shaved head. Being 40 years my senior, he wasn’t aware that monk in this context was simply gender neutral for me.)\n\nTying all of this back to your question: you’re both right, but you’re right about the conventions of different speech communities. Your friend has correctly described a more conservative dialect. You (like me) conform to a more innovative one. I’m not sure that dictionaries have come to reflect this shift in usage. But if you google \"she is headmaster\" / \"she is a headmaster\" / \"she is the headmaster\" (plus \"-daughter\" for convenience), you’ll appreciate that there are a reasonable number of speakers like us.\n\nOn the question of the origin of the master, @Jim correctly observes that magister is the Latin root of English master, and in Latin magister was a masculine word. However, if you ask Who was the greatest actor ever?, this would not normally be taken to preclude a woman’s name being given in response. In other words, masculine forms are default rather than male-specific. (They require additional context for male-specific readings; e.g., Excluding actresses, who was the greatest actor ever?) I’ve seen various studies of languages in which gender indication is obligatory (including French, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Russian, Spanish), and the same holds there: masculine forms are (only with specific exceptions) default forms, covering both genders. I don’t know if evidence is available for Latin, but my guess would be that, as a well behaved Indo-European language, it could reasonably be expected to behave similarly.\n\n\"Master\" has at least two slightly different uses. It's gendered up to a point, with \"mistress\" the female form.\n\nOne use means (roughly) a person in authority over one or more others, as for example a teacher over students or an employer over household servants, and there are several specific relationships it has been most commonly used for. This usage traditionally was strongly gendered.\n\n\"Headmaster\" is this first usage, but the \"master\" refers to the teachers that the head is in charge of (the headmaster is the head among the masters), not the headmaster himself (he is not the master of heads). In schools with both sexes of teacher, \"master\" is being used to mean all \"masters and mistresses\" (the male embraces the female). So I don't suppose that it would be technically incorrect to refer to a woman as the headmaster. However, I don't think it's done in practice: those who care to skip the tradition of gendered titles will use \"headteacher\" or \"head\". You could even perhaps argue that it's a kind of inaccuracy (despite being established usage) to call a woman in charge of men, or of a mixed group of men and women, the \"headmistress\". This doesn't change the usage, of course, and any argument based on referring to a mixed group by the male form but a female group by the female form is going to seem out-dated.\n\n\"Mistress\" does also go with \"Mister\", because \"Mister\" was originally a variant of \"Master\" although the two are no longer interchangeable as titles. \"Mrs.\" was originally a variant of \"Mistress\". Just to be confusing, so was \"Miss\" and so is \"Ms.\"\n\nAs an aside, the other use means (roughly) a person who is expert in their profession (\"a master craftsman\") and I think is less gendered. I speculate that in the relevant centuries, women were rarely considered experts in their professions! Of course such people might well have a managerial role as well, but I do not believe that is what \"master\" refers to here. Rather, they are \"masters\" of their craft.\n\nThere isn't any such phrase as \"mistress craftswoman\", but you could say \"mistress of her craft\". You also might say \"master craftswoman\" if you want a gendered term, \"master craftsman\" if you apply male gendered terms to both men and women, \"master crafter\" or whatever if you prefer a neutral term and are willing to accept \"master\" as neutral in this context. Each strategy exists, irrespective of what we think of them, and not everyone uses one strategy exclusively for all kinds of gendered term.\n\n\"Master\" is also a verb, and there is no corresponding verb \"to mistress\".\n\nThe short answer is no, the word master does not denote masculinity.\n\nThe verb and adjective forms are utterly without controversy, and you could easily, intuitively write sentences like \"She mastered the school's technique\" or \"She is a master bassist.\"\n\nThe noun form is only controversial to the most hardline traditionalists. Notwithstanding their objections from the fringes of society, you could otherwise write sentences like \"She is master of the ship\" without attracting argument.\n\nNor does the word master itself have a male-specific etymological base. It derives from the Latin magnus, which is a masculine word in the sense that Latin had a grammatical gender, but not in the sense that somehow the concept of magn- could only be applied to males. (And there was the feminine equivalent magna.)\n\nSo, whence does the controversy arise?\n\nIt's because, in the past, people believed that it was very important to know whether the holder of any given role was male or female. And they structured their societies--and gave so few rights to females--such that in many instances it actually was important to know. I'll get back to this point in a moment.\n\nIn modern times we have largely divorced roles from any explicit sex-specificity, and a person's sex therefore doesn't matter in the consideration of the roles that person performs. The chairperson's sex has no bearing on that person's ability to be chair, nor does the firefighter's sex, nor the waiter's, nor the actor's, and so forth.\n\nBut old ideas do not die easily, and there are still many people who insist that we should use role descriptors to also indicate a person's sex, even though the usefulness is obsolete. And there are bits and pieces in the English language onto which these diehard traditionalists cling.\n\nThe best such example, in the context of your query about the worst master, is the word mistress, the feminized corruption of master by way of Old French. In olden times many roles existed as sex pairs. A landed estate would have had a master, denoting that individual's authority over the affairs of his house. Quite often the master would have been married, and his wife would have been granted considerable parallel authority under her husband to govern those affairs of the house traditionally identified as being within the distaff domain (i.e., women's affairs). To convey this concept quickly, the word mistress arose to denote the master's female counterpart.\n\nThese days such a usage is virtually obsolete. Exceptions do still exist; the White House still has a traditional mistress-type role for the First Lady; nonetheless the role has become an anachronism as today most couples divide their domestic affairs circumstantially, without respect to sex, and with each successive generation this de-gendering of roles is becoming more thorough.\n\nBe that as it may, the fact that the actual, historical role of mistress is obsolete poses no dissuasion to those who still believe that we must use roles to identify people's sex. To these traditionalists, a female of any sort of authority is a mistress, never a master, and thus, to them, the term master is masculine and reserved for male use (although they would not object to the verb and adjectival forms of the word).\n\nI would be negligent to finish this reply without a few words on the feminine diminutive more broadly, of which mistress is but one instance. The most common feminine diminutives in English are -ess (as with mistress) and -ette (as with bachelorette). By their nature, feminine diminutives are degrading, implying that somehow for a female to hold a role means they alter the role itself to reflect their sex. The English-speaking world has been moving away from the feminine diminuative for a long time, and another commenter made an excellent example of this gradation in action by invoking the words waitress, which many people still accept (though some think of it as quaint), authoress, which virtually no one uses, and Jewess, which is nowadays used only as an offensive slur.\n\nIn all likelihood this trend will continue as society continues toward its recognition that a person's sex is independent of their capacity to fulfill a role, like that of author, and moreover that being a female does not make for an inferior individual. Specialized exceptions will linger the longest, like actress, because the film industry segregates awards.\n\nThus, for all the protestations of the hardliners, in my assessment you can safely ignore them and use master of females howsoever you wish.\n\nLastly, here's a bit of data: The words master and mistress have both in sustained long-term decline, with a minor resurgence recently that may or may not be statistical noise. Either way, the data suggest that the very concept of mastership is fading from the social currency, and with it the tagalong concept of the mistress. That's in addition to the decline in mistress as a result of our society becoming less sexist.\n\nhttps://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=master%2C+mistress&year_start=1500&year_end=2014&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cmaster%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cmistress%3B%2Cc0"
