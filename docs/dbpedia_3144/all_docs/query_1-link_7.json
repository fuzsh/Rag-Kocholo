        "text": "Next Article\n\nIn Conversation with Patrick Derham, outgoing Head Master\n\nKat Stobbs, Development and Community Giving Manager\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith one term to go, how are you feeling about moving on from Westminster? Or are you too busy to register that events and occasions are the last ones?\n\nThe extraordinary thing about being a Head Master is that the job never gets any easier – there’s never any respite so you don’t really have an opportunity to reflect on doing things for the last time. I’m as busy now as I was when I came in 2014 and considerably busier than when I became a Head in 1996 because the nature of the job has changed so much. It’s with incredibly mixed feelings that I’m leaving because I love the job, but I think that one of the most important things about leadership is leaving at the right time. I’ve seen too many colleagues and friends in other professions who have ‘over stayed their welcome’ and I think that the challenge is to identify when you’re still loving the job and don’t particularly want to go but feel that it’s the right time. So that’s sort of how I feel – I love it and I’m teaching a fantastic A Level History set, possibly one of the best sets that I have ever taught, so it makes the leaving harder. Deep down I know that it’s the right thing and I’m sure that, come September when School will be resuming and I’ll be doing whatever, it’ll really hit home. But as yet, I haven’t really had the chance to think about it. Your background is in History and you received your MA History from Pembroke College, Cambridge. What made you decide to pursue a career in teaching?\n\nBecause of my very dysfunctional education, when I ended up at my 8th School by the age of 14, I had some pretty inspiring teachers; though I was in a school where the overall intelligence wasn’t at the highest level. I had three really inspiring teachers who instilled in me a love of History and a love of Literature. When I went to Cambridge to read History, partly I think because of my Irish and Dutch roots and the history of my family, I had a deep seated empathy for the importance of History. Although I had lots of tempting offers and opportunities after graduation, I just felt that the thing I most wanted to do was to share my love of History with as many people as I could, but in an environment when I could do the all-around School mastering. I consider myself to have had the best job in the world because I do think that great teachers do change lives – the old clichéd advert that ‘everyone remembers a good teacher’, is actually true. I’ve loved the fact that throughout my Headship I’ve always taught an A Level set, which is quite unusual for Heads, but I do think that it’s important for the Head to be leading by example and from the front in terms of teaching. ➽\n\nI’ve always taught an A Level set, which is quite unusual for Heads, but I do think that it’s important for the Head to be leading by example and from the front in terms of teaching\n\nWhat attracted you to Westminster School when you applied all of those years ago?\n\nHaving previously been a Head Master at two very different Schools, I wasn’t sure I wanted to do a third, after becoming a Head at such a young age. I always thought that I would get Rugby School through the Rugby World Cup and then go into the Charity Sector. But when the Westminster job came up, it was actually a very easy decision to go for it because it’s the only School that I would have ever contemplated – the history of the School is so radically different to the Arnoldian history at Rugby and as a Historian, I’ve always been intrinsically interested in Westminster. When I did my research and met some key people here, it really was the classic ‘no brainer’. It’s been even better than I thought – it’s an extraordinary institution that is a very special place.\n\nAre there any vivid memories from your first day here?\n\nI think you cannot help but be bowled over by the association with the Abbey – my first service was being installed as the Head of the School by the Dean of Westminster. That was an extraordinary moment and every time I go to the Abbey I feel a sense of privilege – that realisation that you’re walking in the footsteps of history is a very powerful thing. Another early memory that I have is my first meeting with the Staff up School, because it was such a wonderfully uplifting meeting, made by Jeremy Kemball walking off with my notes after he had spoken – I was able to quip that was “career suicide”, which I’m very pleased to say it hasn’t been as Jeremy is a distinguished member of the Senior Management Committee. There are so many wonderful memories of my time here and that’s the extraordinary thing about the job that one does working in a school – every day is different with such a dizzying array of activity. The ebb and flow of School life is mesmerizing and really inspiring.\n\nOf all of the traditions and rituals that are part of the Westminster School experience (eg. Commem, The Greaze, Locke lectures etc), which is either your personal favourite or has left the greatest impression on you?\n\nBig and Little Commem are very special moments in the Westminster calendar because we are giving thanks in Abbey for the generosity of benefactors who have enabled the School to still be surviving today. It’s such a delicious fusion of Abbey and School which is unique and remarkable. But I have to say that the one event that I was very pleasantly surprised by was the Election Dinner. The idea of not having a Speech Day and not ending the School year with a big speech was wonderful, but the Election Dinner exceeded expectations. The quality of ‘entertainment’ is mind-blowing and it’s interesting that all of the friends who have come, guests of the School and such, have written or rang me instantly to tell me that they have never experienced anything like it. So it is a very special part of the School calendar. But the great thing about Westminster is that we wear our traditions very lightly. The lack of pretension in the School is wonderful – things like The Greaze are just fantastic because they show such a connection with our history, even though we don’t know much about the origins. We think that The Greaze originated in Tudor times and the first recorded mention of it is by Jeremy Bentham who was here 1755–1760. The fact that it carries on in a wonderful Westminster low-key way is very special. So for me, all of the traditions of Westminster are quirky, individual and fit the institution – we don’t take ourselves too seriously. I find that very endearing and very unusual amongst the so-called great schools.\n\nYou are incredibly passionate about widening access through education and the incredibly ambitious and ground-breaking Westminster School Campaign was launched under your leadership. You’re also heavily involved with both the SpringBoard Foundation and IntoUniversity which also aim to open the doors of education to a wider selection of young people. What inspires that passion for widening access?\n\nI hope that October 2018 will mark a turning point in the School’s history, when we launched The Westminster School Campaign, Up School. For me it’s a two-fold motivation; the first is that, in a sense, it reconnects the School with the wishes of Queen Elizabeth I when she re-founded the School in 1560. In a sense, it was re-founded with meritocracy at the heart of the School with the purpose to educate 40 poor boys for the greater good of the state. Westminsters that I have met throughout my life have\n\nembodied that sense of meritocracy and a recognition that the education they received had been lifetransforming; the finest liberal education that is truly liberating. I believe we have a responsibility to be making a very clear statement that we believe a Westminster education shouldn’t just be for those who are fortunate enough to afford it, but should be for those who will benefit from it. In a sense that’s also part of the motivation for the creation of Harris Westminster Sixth Form and the development of the Platform and Platform+ programmes. I’ve been impressed by the response from the wider Westminster family, to the Campaign. One of the most abiding memories that I have is when we played the Campaign film for the first time Up School during Latin Prayers, which is another wonderful Westminster tradition that we must never ever lose sight of or diminish in any shape or form; the School spontaneously erupted into applause and a number of pupils instantly came up to me and asked how they could get involved. Again, it shows just what a very special place Westminster is.\n\nThe second motivation is that, my very life was transformed by educational opportunity and there isn’t a day when I don’t give thanks for the opportunities that I’ve been given. I’m very much an outsider to this world and I just see things through a very different lens and experience. I had the extraordinary experience of speaking at the memorial service of my former Head Master last year; this man had met me as a bedraggled, ill-educated fourteen year old and took a gamble on me. My life was transformed by those 4 ½ years. On my last day, where to my astonishment I had ended up as Head Boy, he took me aside and told me to always remember six words that Martin Luther King Jr had spoken; “What are you doing for others?”. Those six words have been my motivation throughout the rest of my life. At all the schools that I have been lucky enough to be Head Master of, I’ve tried to inculcate that message to the pupils- where ➽\n\nTop left: The Greaze Left: Launch of The Westminster campaign Above: Queen’s Scholars\n\nit’s most deep rooted however, is here at Westminster, building on the fantastic work of civic engagement and volunteering. We’ve been able to take it to new levels, through the Campaign and through Platform and through our partnership with Harris Westminster Sixth Form. It was a wonderful thing earlier this term when we won the TES award for Independent-State School Partnership, which is a wonderful recognition of our fantastic work in that area which again, is ground-breaking and innovative. For me, it’s yet another way in which Westminster has been leading from the front.\n\nAside from the Campaign, what accomplishment during your tenure as Head Master are you most proud of?\n\nLegacy has been the buzzword of every conversation in the last year. I would like to feel that I have helped raise Westminster’s profile in a way that has been beneficial, but in particular in the sense that we have been contributing to, and been heavily involved in, national education debates. That is something which I think is important and proper, given the astonishing education that is provided here.\n\nOne thing that has given me the greatest sense of pleasure, is the incredible sense of community, which we have worked hard on strengthening. One thing which I would have never expected before I came, and people on the outside would almost certainly never expect, is that in our two inspection reports, kindness is identified as being at the heart of the School. You can see it in the way individuals act with one another. There’s no hierarchy; there’s no pretention. Each pupil, staff member (teaching and support) and parent is treated as an individual; every person’s opinion and thoughts are respected. It’s an extraordinary thing and not something which should be taken for granted – it’s not something that I’ve really experienced in other institutions. For me, it’s been the greatest thing and such a wonderful way to end my Head Master-ing; at a School where kindness is right at the heart of everything that has been done.\n\nThe biggest challenges facing the sector are political and financial. We’re entering very choppy waters for the sector. One of the main things that I’ve been focussing on in my time here is trying to demonstrate the role that the independent sector can play in the education system. I think that is something that Dr Gary Savage will do battle on – he’s the perfect person to succeed me in that respect, especially. There are challenges, but I think that Westminster is very well placed. But that’s why we need to really re-inforce the importance of the China partnership because one of the big challenges we are facing is that the School fees are prohibitively expensive. Schools like Westminster are increasingly exclusive. So Schools have to look imaginatively and creatively at other income streams. Although it hasn’t gone down well in all areas of the Westminster community, one cannot underestimate the soft power of the work that the Westminster Schools will do in the greater China region. Additionally, the benefits that will come financially in the long-term, which will enable the School to do many interesting things going forward, cannot be doubted.\n\nThe way that the pupils interact with each other and relations with all of the staff, makes it a special place to live and work. It makes it a very hard place to leave.\n\nWhat do you think makes Westminster School one of, if not *the* best School in the world?\n\nObviously I’m completely biased, but I’m quite clear in my own mind that there is no other School like Westminster, anywhere. It’s a combination of factors, but particularly because of this place being the embodiment of liberal education. The book that I edited, Loyal Dissent, and the choice of that as the title was a purposeful one; the pupils here are very loyal to the institution, but they are dissenting, questioning and they challenge the orthodoxy. From the moment they arrive in the fifth form, we are encouraging them to be their own person and to have their own opinions. I’m absolutely clear that that is distinctive and very, very special. I would link that to the point I made earlier about kindness; the way that the pupils interact with each other and relations with all of the staff, makes it a special place to live and work. It makes it a very hard place to leave. But I think for me, the abiding thing is the quality of the teaching, the quality of the pupils, the quality of the support staff and the fact that it is one very strong community which prides itself on excellence in all areas; not in any way undervaluing any individual, so that everyone can flourish, whatever his or her strengths.\n\nIf you could describe the School in three words, what would they be?\n\nI’m going to just go with one word: inspiring. Inspiring on every level – I think that sums it up. ■"
