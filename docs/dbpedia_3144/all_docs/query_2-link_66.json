        "text": "Term-time weekly blog from the High Master, Sally-Anne Huang\n\nFriday 8 July 2022\n\nIt’s a great pleasure to be writing to you at the end of an academic year which started with so much uncertainty and has ended with celebrations and a great deal of enthusiasm. It has been wonderful to see pupils able to enjoy full, in-person learning again this year and re-immerse themselves in the bustling atmosphere of Pauline school life. This is certainly not a school that winds down a fortnight before the end of term, with activities and initiatives running even yesterday. The last week of term has brought much to celebrate, beginning with the 1st VIII’s thrilling victory at Henley, reclaiming the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup for St Paul’s. We have also learned of success in Team Firefly’s F24 racing, chess, Biology and football. Congratulations to the pupils involved for their sustained efforts to reach these outstanding achievements just as the term is drawing to an end.\n\nOur pupils and the staff team continue to make me proud in their efforts to promote collaboration and community engagement. Over the past week, this has included the World Cup Day, an initiative requiring a large amount of planning between Partnerships, Humanities, Music and Sport, to provide local primary school children with an exciting and engaging day of learning that will long be remembered. Also, this week’s PSHE sessions for the Fifth Form were led by the SPGS Consent and Respect Committee in collaboration with the SPS Values Committee. This is an incredibly important aspect of our pupils’ education, holding discussions on relationships and providing a safe space to explore these issues. My thanks go to the staff involved in arranging these joint sessions with the Girls’ School.\n\nOn Thursday night, I had the pleasure of attending the 2022 Leavers’ Ceremony and wishing the year group well as they embark on the next stage in their academic careers. The Upper Eighth have shown flexibility and resilience in the face of two years of Covid-related uncertainty, and I have no doubt that they will be successful as they take their next step into the wider world. I was glad to have the opportunity to thank them on Thursday for the leadership they have shown this year and the work they have done in re-setting a positive tone of collaboration across year groups and raising the profiles of values and inclusion.\n\nIt only remains for me to wish you and your families a safe and enjoyable summer break and to thank you for your support of the school and of your sons over the last academic year. I look forward to seeing them refreshed and full of enthusiasm in September.\n\nThursday 30 June 2022\n\nYesterday afternoon, I was able to watch the U15As win the Middlesex County Cup at home by 22 runs. Not only were the team incredibly impressive in their maturity and focus, but it was also a delight to spend the time with colleagues who had turned up to watch. Towards the end of the match, the rest of the Fifth Form came out of lessons and offered their support. This culminated in a ‘storming’ of the pitch after the final ball was bowled. As you can imagine, there were concerns about damage to the cricket square! However, the camaraderie and sense of community was palpable.\n\nAfter all of this excitement, my day finished yesterday at the A Level Art Exhibition. This was impressive not just for its quality but also its variety. Exhibits included a digital sculpture accessed through QR codes as well as ceramics, animation and more traditional media. Speaking with the artists about the processes employed to reach this stage, as well as their future plans was a privilege. Pauline scholarship was very much on display at every turn.\n\nI know that parents would also be encouraged by the number of events being run by our Careers and Universities Department in the last few weeks of term. Many of these have also included partnership school pupils. From the medical conference to the universities day, the programme has been both comprehensive and in-depth, and I hope that the pupils taking part have left enthused by the number of opportunities available to them post-A Level and feel informed of their next steps.\n\nActivities outside the classroom continue apace as we approach the end of the school year, I was delighted to learn that a group of Lower Eighth pupils, along with some from the Girls’ School, helped to run the end-of-term sports day for over 300 children at St Mary’s Ukrainian School last weekend. Meanwhile, the SPS Model United Nations conference was extremely successful, and expertly run by Eighth Form students. The Ultimate Frisbee team finished joint third in the U20 division at the UK Ultimate Junior Outdoor National Championships. Meanwhile, for our wider community, the Pauline Continuum Cycling organised a well-attended ascent of Box Hill as part of a 100km group ride, fundraising for Women’s Aid, on Saturday. While back on home turf, we were finally able to hold a belated Leavers’ Ceremony for the Class of 2020, who were denied their moment by Covid.\n\nMy own joyous week continues tonight with the opening night of The Last Days of Troy. Anticipation for this Fourth and Fifth Form production is high, and I’m very much looking forward to enjoying this modern reimagining of the final days of the Trojan War.\n\nThursday 23 June 2022\n\nIn the final few weeks of the term, school events continue apace and it is proving to be a great time for co-curricular activities now that exams are behind us. I’m glad to hear that the Gold DofE training expedition was a success, with the Lower Eighth participants enjoying fine weather in the Peak District. This has also been a week of music; on Tuesday, the ambience of the Atrium at lunchtime was enhanced by ‘guitar and songwriter pop-up’ performances by some of our talented pupils whilst, last night, we enjoyed a fantastic range of musical styles at the Charity Concert in aid of the Okatar Kraus Music Trust. Today, pupils from schools across the capital have joined us for a Maths Circle event, which is being run as part of the Maths Week London initiative. Tomorrow, we will be holding a Higher Education Fair, which will provide a really useful opportunity for those in the Fifth-Lower Eighth Forms, as well as partnership school pupils, to learn about the options available to them post-A Level.\n\nCongratulations also go to our cricketers this week, who enjoyed a successful fixture against RGS Guildford on Saturday. The U14 and U15 cricketers have reached the finals of the Middlesex Cup; we send them all best wishes and look forward to hearing the results of today’s U14 final, and next week’s U15 match. Finally, I would like to extend my thanks once again to Lower Eighth pupils, Shivan, Victor and Sean, who ran conversational English classes at St Mary’s Ukrainian School, Holland Park, again on Saturday.\n\nAnd it’s a busy week ahead. On Monday, I look forward to celebrating the successes of our Fourth-Sixth Form pupils at the Junior Prizegiving. On Tuesday, Nick Troen, Head of Entrepreneurship, will be hosting a panel of sector-leading experts at our Entrepreneurship Forum.\n\nThursday 16 June 2022\n\nDespite examinations, public and internal, Paulines continue to celebrate success within the classroom and without. My congratulations this week go to Alex, for his school record-breaking shot put throw at the Marlborough College Athletics Meeting; to Neil and Haolin for their places awarded at UK Mathematics Trust Summer Schools; to Alexis, Maxim, Edward and Leon, for progressing to the semi-final of the Rootham Shield tennis tournament; and to our cricketers for a successful fixture against Hampton School.\n\nAs ever, I am incredibly grateful to the pupils and staff who volunteer their time to provide support and enrichment to members of our local community. This week, particular thanks go to those involved in the Primary Professors sessions last weekend, and to the pupils who are continuing to support our friends at St Mary’s Ukrainian School. I am sure you will agree with me that this is an important project at present.\n\nFinally, as we are currently going through the process of selecting next year’s School Captain and Vice-Captain (a difficult choice given that we have so many outstanding candidates) I would like to offer thanks to George and Will who have been exemplary role models to the school this year and have led the pupil body through the re-opening of the school community post Covid. I will have other opportunities to thank them, and their excellent prefect team, before the term is over but I didn’t want to miss out on sharing this with the parent body at this stage.\n\nThursday 9 June 2022\n\nI hope that you and your families enjoyed a restful Remedy and Jubilee weekend. This has been a fairly quiet week in comparison to our normal pace, given the number of exams happening on site. However, as the final month of the school year progresses, we look towards celebrating our talented pupils and thanking the staff body with prize-givings and end of year events.\n\nIn the last week before the Remedy, I was delighted to attend the Consecration of the School Chapel by the Lord Bishop of London, The Rt Revd and Rt Hon Dame Sarah Mullally DBE (who the eagle-eyed amongst you might have spotted taking part in the service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral over the Jubilee weekend), and the Bishop of Kingston, the Rt Revd Dr Richard Cheetham. The Chapel and John Colet Hall were filled to capacity with a congregation of well-wishers. It was a rare opportunity to witness a Consecration and to participate in this historical event in the life of our school.\n\nOver the first weekend of the Remedy, I very much enjoyed joining our rowing crews who were competing at the National Schools’ Regatta at Eton Dorney. The results were outstanding and our largest-ever entry to the regatta proved a great success. Many thanks to the staff who led them and to the parents’ group who supported and hosted refreshments in the school tent. My congratulations go to the Fourth and Fifth Form Physicists for their excellent results in the British Physics Olympiad Junior Challenge. I’m also proud of the growing support, led by members of our staff team, for the pupils and staff of St Mary’s Ukrainian School in London, which I am certain will continue to strengthen over time.\n\nThursday 26 May 2022\n\nAs we approach the Summer Remedy, this is an excellent opportunity to thank my colleagues and our pupils for all that has been achieved in a busy half term. The break ahead will prove particularly useful to those in the Sixth Form and Upper Eighth as they continue to prepare for and complete their GCSE and A Level examinations; I once again send my best wishes to these year groups.\n\nCongratulations this week go to our athletes for their performance in this year’s Lord Burghley Athletics Trophy, to the cricketers for a successful new block fixture against Trinity School, and to the Lower Eighth team that took bronze in the Grand Final of the HFX Business Strategy Game. Thank you to all those involved in the production of Vector, the STEM magazine, and the debut St Paul’s History Review; it is a particular point of pride that our pupil and staff body produce such high quality internal publications containing outstanding, intelligent writing.\n\nI’ve enjoyed taking part in two interesting discussions this week as part of our community events programme. On Tuesday, I was joined online by two OPs, Sam Bain and Patrick Neate, who shared their experiences of writing for the page and screen against the backdrop of the ever-changing media landscape. Last night, I was privileged to speak with former Education Secretary, Lord Baker OP, and OPC President, Lord Vaizey, on the future of Britain’s education system. Thank you to those who joined us online or in person for these events.\n\nFinally, I would like to wish all the best to those rowing in the National Schools’ Regatta, the largest national junior rowing event of the year, on Friday and Saturday. Over 100 pupils will be representing St Paul’s – our largest-ever entry to the regatta.\n\nThursday 19 May 2022\n\nAs I write, the pupils are dashing across Founder’s Court in the rain. However, we have in general enjoyed better weather of late and, in other respects is has been a more typical Summer Term at St Paul’s than we have experienced for some time. Public examinations have begun in earnest, whilst afternoons and lighter evenings are filled with expressions of talent on the sports field, stage and in the concert hall.\n\nIt is a pleasure to read of the success of the J14 rowers this week, which fills me with confidence as I look forward to the continued success of the Boat Club in the years ahead. Congratulations must also go to Hari (Fourth Form) for his sterling performance whilst representing Hammersmith & Fulham at this year’s London Youth Games. It is encouraging to see the fruits of the Fifth Form Club Engineering challenge, a fine display of the healthy and enthusiastic internal competition. Finally, following last week’s Young Enterprise article, I’m pleased to see that our Lower Eighth teams are enjoying even further success, with one progressing to a European competition.\n\nThursday 12 May 2022\n\nEveryone at school was delighted to host Apposition last Saturday morning with a live audience for the first time since 2019. It was wonderful to see Prizewinners and their parents in person to celebrate this historic and important day for the school and all present were impressed by the quality of this year’s Declaimers, Finn, Omar, Eamon, and James. The tradition of Apposition dates back to the school’s founding in 1509 and was originally intended as the means by which the Mercers’ Company could assess the teaching staff and the High Master in particular. Although it is now purely ceremonial, it showcases the very best scholarship and academic curiosity of our pupils.\n\nOn the following day, I enjoyed seeing Team Firefly back in action, racing at Goodwood. This was particularly meaningful as it would have been for many pupils their first experience of a race day. I was especially impressed by all the mutual support and encouragement on display amongst the teams.\n\nFinally, I am delighted to announce that this week we hit the milestone of 50% of St Paul’s families supporting the school’s fundraising ambitions. Your generosity allows the school to expand its bursary programme and move closer to its goal of 153 bursaries by 2023.\n\nThursday 5 May 2022\n\nI am writing to you fresh with enthusiasm following the Music Competition Final last night. Particular praise goes to Calvin, our Senior winner and leader of the school orchestra, and to all the Upper Eighth who have given so much to St Paul’s music. However, it was also really heartening to see so many young pupils playing at such high standards and to know that SPS performances have a healthy future ahead.\n\nAs you’ll see from the news stories below, there have been a number of pupil successes this week. Many congratulations to team ‘GTW’, who attended this year’s virtual International ‘Safe Cracking’ Physics Tournament and placed first overall out of 44 entrants. This victory is significant as a St Paul’s team has not been recognised first internationally since 2016.\n\nThere was success at Wallingford Regatta; well done to the first eight who won three events on the day. There were also 4th place finishes for the second eight’s coxed four and the J16A eight. This is also a good moment to highlight that the U14 Water Polo team were victorious in their latest London Schools’ League match against London Oratory School.\n\nLooking ahead to next week, we will bid farewell to the Upper Eighth as they prepare to go on study leave. There will be a celebratory breakfast in the dining hall in their honour on Wednesday morning, followed by speeches. They have been exceptional members of the school community in leading our ‘reawakening’ after the pandemic and their positive attitude will live long in the school memory. We wish them every success in the weeks ahead.\n\nThursday 28 April 2022\n\nIt has been a busy return to school for our pupils, with a wide array of exciting academic and athletic events taking place, and EcoWeek underway. Sustainability is important to St Paul’s and it has been inspiring to see so many pupils involved in activities and talks over the past few days. On Monday, we held a joint event with St Paul’s Girls’ School to allow parents to hear more about the growing collaboration between the schools.\n\nI would like to extend my congratulations to the Eighth Form biologists who competed in the British Biology Olympiad, winning 52 medals (25 of them gold), and I was thrilled to learn that Senan (Upper Eighth) was selected for the UK International Biology Olympiad team. Further success has been achieved in other national and international competitions: St Paul’s was the only UK school to reach the elimination round of the Harvard Pre-Collegiate Economic Challenge, and our team were regional winners in the final of the National Schools Under 19 Chess Championships. Congratulations to all who worked so hard to achieve these accolades.\n\nIt has also been wonderful to see more sporting achievements this week, including those of Upper Eighth students Oliver and George who won the 1st pairs Championship and in doing so made National, and SPS, School Rackets history after conceding just one game throughout the entire event.\n\nThursday 17 March 2022\n\nA tremendous amount has been happening at St Paul’s this week. The Battle of the Bands was a roaring success on Wednesday, with Moon Central Station taking the title home after a very successful set. In the world of sport, we have seen successes from the swimming pool to the football pitch and the squash court.\n\nI would also like to extend my congratulations to the 18 Lower Eighth boys who have managed to raise over £44,000 for the British Red Cross Ukraine Crisis Appeal. We are all extremely proud of their efforts in taking action at a time when it would be all too easy to feel hopeless. Thank you to them all and everyone who has supported them for continuing the St Paul’s tradition of philanthropy and giving.\n\nLooking ahead, this week will see the premiere of Richard Sheridan’s eighteenth-century masterpiece The Rivals on Thursday 18th, Friday 19th and Saturday 16th in the Samuel Pepys theatre. Not only has it been given a swinging 60s makeover but it’s also packed with vivid characters, hilarious predicaments and head-spinning twists.\n\nThursday 24 February 2022\n\nJust before half term, 66 Paulines competed in the Oxford University Computing Challenge: 17 achieved merits and 22 distinctions. A warm congratulations to all who participated, and a special mention to Anango (Fourth Form) who scored full marks in the “Elite” category, which is aimed at pupils in the Lower and Upper Eighth nationally.\n\nI would also like to highlight the achievement of Philip (Fifth Form) who will be representing Team UK Select in the Riga Hockey Cup, and Max (Sixth Form) who finished 4th in the 800m at the England Athletics National Indoor Championships U17 last weekend.\n\nIn school events, Wednesday night saw the latest instalment of our The Future Of… series of discussions between Old Pauline Club President, Lord Vaizey of Didcot, and an array of alumni. We are also looking forward to the school production of Party Time next week, and also to welcome Lady Antonia Fraser who will share memories of her 33-year relationship with the play’s writer, Harold Pinter.\n\nThursday 10 February 2022\n\nOn Monday, we hosted the Old Pauline Feast Service at St Paul’s Cathedral, featuring a stunning joint performance of Evensong by the SPS Chamber Choir and the SPJ Recital Choir. The choirs also performed to a full St Catharine’s College Chapel in Cambridge on Saturday 5 February, supported by families and Old Paulines. It was an enormous privilege to see their performance at the Feast Service, and for pupils to be able to have the experience of singing Evensong.\n\nOur musicians also shone last night at the Chamber Music Concert in the Wathen Hall, where they were joined by the Alkyona Quartet, who had led workshops earlier in the day. I always feel incredibly fortunate to be able to hear wonderful music at the end of a busy day and would recommend our concerts to all of you, and your families, in the future.\n\nMoving to sport, we have had an equally successful week, with a number of achievements in Squash, Rugby, Football and Swimming. In addition, I would like to congratulate the two teams of Lower Eighth students who participated in this year’s Weizmann UK Safe Cracking Physics and Engineering Competition on Sunday.\n\nI am thrilled to announce that this year’s SPJ Readathon surpassed its impressive target of £10,000, and I extend my gratitude to the Pauls4All Thomas Gresham Committee (Will, Louis, Matt and Charlie from the Upper Eighth) for organising such an inspiring event. I would also like to congratulate the Partnerships team on the launch of the London Lit Soc Book Club, which St Paul’s hosted in Partnership with Barnes Children’s Literary Festival in the John Collet Hall on Saturday.\n\nIt only remains for me to thank you for all your support during this half term and I look forward to seeing many more of you in person after the break.\n\nThursday 3 February 2022\n\nIt’s been another busy week for our pupils. Monday saw the launch of LGBT+ History Week and we were delighted to welcome our keynote speaker, Reverend Richard Coles, who gave an inspirational overview of his life. There was also a packed schedule of pupil-led talks and topical discussions, ranging from ‘An Insight into the Incredible Lives of LGBT+ Explorers’ to ‘LBGT+ Inclusivity in Formula 1: Committed to Change?’ to name a few.\n\nIt has also been wonderful to see more sporting achievements this week. Many congratulations to Cameron (Fifth Form), Benjy (Fifth Form) and Max (Sixth Form) on their exceptional performances at the Middlesex Cross Country Championships, as well as to the J15 and J16 rowing squads, who each won their event at Quintin Head at the weekend. It was also terrific to see the 1st XI football team beat Highgate School (4-0) and reach the SOCS London and South Independent Schools’ Cup Semi-finals. Best of luck to the team for the next stage of the competition after half term.\n\nI look forward to seeing many of the Upper Eighth parents at this year’s Feast Service on Monday at St Paul’s Cathedral and the Mercers’ Company. The Chapel Choir will be singing the Evensong Service at the Cathedral, which is now open to all St Paul’s parents and family members to attend (there is no need to register your attendance).\n\nFinally, I will be hosting an online session to thank our donors next Thursday evening. As we approach the last 18 months of the Shaping Our Future appeal, we are keen to share the latest figures and give thanks for the ongoing support. I am delighted that I will be joined by one of our donors, who will explain the motivation behind their support; our Director of Partnerships and one of our bursary recipients will update you on the impact of your donations.\n\nHappy Lunar New Year to all celebrating in the Pauline community. Earlier this week, boarding pupils marked the occasion with a special dinner and some festive fireworks so you were in our thoughts.\n\nThursday 27 January 2022\n\nIn true St Paul’s fashion, this has been another outstanding week of achievements for our pupils. We have seen success in both academics and athletics, and in particular I would like to congratulate all those who competed in the Computing and British Physics Olympiads, achieving stand out results for themselves and the school; as well as James from the Upper Eighth who has secured a place with Middlesex Rugby U18.\n\nIn terms of looking beyond our own community, I am very pleased to announce that we have seen particularly strong uptake from our partnerships schools for this term’s Secondary STEM Enrichment Programme and Primary Professors, the latter being run by the Humanities faculty. All are hosted at St Paul’s on Saturday mornings, and compliment a busy mid-week programme which includes Latin and Entrepreneurship. My thanks go to Ben Still, Janet Mee, Matt Young, Nick Troen and all the other teaching/support staff who have facilitated these programmes.\n\nOn a personal note, I was privileged to host this week’s Topical Tuesday programmed to mark Holocaust Memorial day; it was both powerful and moving. During the talk, John Wood shared the story of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen and the part his father, Leonard Berney (OP 1933-37), played in this. Amongst other events in school that have taken place supporting Holocaust Memorial day this week, colleagues and senior pupils in our JSoc have created a commemorative assembly that all pupils will experience in their tutor time tomorrow.\n\nNext week we have the opportunity to be entertained and educated by another fantastic speaker: the Reverend Richard Coles, whose presentation on Monday 31 January will mark the beginning of a week of events for LGBT+ History Month. He will share the story of his journey to self-acceptance during the virtual webinar and Q&A.\n\nThursday 20 January 2022\n\nIt’s been an enjoyable and successful week for our pupils. On a personal note, I was thrilled to see the first XI match against Tonbridge on Saturday and also had the privilege of sitting in on the Hans Woyda first round knockout match against Haberdashers’ Askes last night. Both the football and the maths were equally impressive in terms of speed, skill and commitment! Congratulations to all involved with these achievements and others, details of which are available below.\n\nIn other activities this week, parents may be interested to read about the Values Symposium, joint with the girls’ school, which took place on Tuesday. I am grateful to my colleagues for supporting this and would also like to thank Nikolas Boyd-Carpenter and Benjamin Bonas in the U8th for their work in organising this important event.\n\nIt has also been a pleasure to welcome three new Governors to the school this term, Tom Adeyoola, technology entrepreneur and Old Pauline, Aisha Sanusi, Director of the African Caribbean Education Network, and the Rt Hon Lord Vaizey of Didcot, former Minister, politician and, as an Old Pauline, current President of the Old Pauline Club.\n\nThursday 16 December 2021\n\nFounder’s Court has been filled with holiday spirit this morning, with sweet sales for the bursary fund, a snow machine and carol singing. Pupils and staff have worn an array of Christmas jumpers in support of one of the school’s local charities, City Harvest London.\n\nIn this morning’s assembly, I thanked pupils for all the joy they have brought to our community this term, through their scholarship, performing arts, and sports. It has been a busy but successful term for them and for the staff here at St Paul’s. You may also remember that it has included an ISI inspection. This was a compliance inspection, simply resulting in a pass or fail situation rather than qualitative judgements of any type. However, it was a positive experience and an affirmation of standards at the school.\n\nWith Covid cases continuing to rise in the wider community, please can we remind all pupils to continue to self-test twice weekly over the holiday and, in particular, to self-test on the day before they return to school. We have distributed supplies of self-test kits to pupils accordingly and it is also very important that they continue to report their results to both the school and the NHS.\n\nFinally, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank all our pupils and staff for their hard work and commitment this term. As the pupils leave site at lunchtime today for a well-earned break, I wish you all a happy and healthy holiday season and very much hope that you will be able to enjoy time with loved ones.\n\nThursday 9 December 2021\n\nWe are delighted to have appointed Oliver Snowball as the next Head of St Paul’s Juniors, building on the truly excellent work of Maxine Shaw. Oliver will be coming on site on a number of occasions over the next few months and we will be providing opportunities for those who wish to meet him to do so in due course.\n\nLast Wednesday saw the inaugural meeting of the school’s pupil-led African Caribbean Society (ACS). The ACS was founded jointly with SPGS and the two schools join a host of London schools and universities across the country which support thriving African and Caribbean Societies. The ACS was inaugurated with a Charter which was written collaboratively by the pupils of both schools earlier this term.\n\nLast week also saw the first of the prestigious annual Reith Lectures on BBC Radio 4 which this year are given by Professor Stuart Russell OP, on ‘Living with Artificial Intelligence’.\n\nAs the rugby season draws to a close, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the staff who give so generously of their time to allow such a full programme to take place, and all of the pupils who have represented the school this term. I am constantly impressed by their commitment and positive attitude, whether they win, lose or draw. A special thank you goes to Julius, Captain, and other members of the Upper Eighth who have played their final matches for the school. Last weekend’s first XV win against Dulwich College, marking the 130th year since that fixture was first played, was a particular highlight.\n\nFinally, as the government continues to make further announcements about the changes to Covid management guidelines, I would like to reassure you that cases at St Paul’s remain very low and have not increased. We are, therefore, remaining cautious but continuing with our current plans, which have been risk-assessed against guidelines.\n\nThursday 2 December 2021\n\nI enjoyed hosting the High Master in Conversation session on Monday evening with Dr Malcolm Cocks, Head of Inclusion, and Dr Phil Gaydon, Head of Character Education, and was delighted that so many of you were able to join us. It offered a chance to hear more about both programmes, and the volume and thoughtful nature of the questions asked suggested that this is clearly an area supported and championed by parents, for which I am very grateful.\n\nThis morning, I had the privilege of meeting with ten Fourth Formers who have done exceptionally well in their end of term grades. I would like to take this opportunity to offer my congratulations to the whole year group at the end of their first term. They have settled into the school so well and I was delighted to hear that the feedback from both parents and pupils from the parents’ evening earlier this week was so positive.\n\nTonight, I am looking forward to seeing the senior production of King Lear, which runs until Saturday. Please do join us if you are able to. By all accounts from the dress rehearsal (and anecdotes from the cast), it really is an exceptional production. I’m also looking forward to hearing our jazz musicians in the Wathen Hall this weekend; the perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon.\n\nThursday 25 November 2021\n\nIt has been another exceptionally busy and successful week for our pupils across such a wide range of disciplines. Many congratulations to all of them, although a special mention must go to the U16C Rugby team who, despite having gone the entire season without a win, scored a last-minute goal from a drop-kick to secure the win 17-14 against RGS in a game that will live long in the memory.\n\nYesterday evening, I enjoyed a spectacular evening of music in the Wathen Hall by the Chamber and Symphony Orchestras and the Chapel Choir. The quality of the pupils’ musicianship and their delight in performing large-scale works to a live audience once again was a joy to see.\n\nAs we draw towards the end of term and the festive season, I am delighted that our Christmas Appeal in support of the bursary fund has got off to such a strong start, thank you so much for your support. Please do consider supporting if you can, our hope is that through the generosity of our matched funder we may be able to offer a full five year bursary – donations at any level most welcome.\n\nThursday 18 November 2021\n\nThis week is the Independent Schools Council’s Partnership week and I am glad to be able to take that opportunity to draw your attention to our own work in this area. The West London Partnership continues to grow and flourish and, of course, we are extremely proud of Colet Mentoring and other virtual and in-person volunteering programmes, and the commitment pupils have shown in this area. This term, we have also relaunched our Primary School programme, Primary Professors, more details of which are given here.\n\nContinuing the theme of giving back to the community, we are delighted to have launched our Christmas Appeal in support of our bursary programme this week. Further details about the appeal and also the festive events that are planned are also included in today’s newsletter. Please note the St Paul’s Christmas bauble – a must for every tree this year! Tonight at 7pm the Thomas Gresham Committee are hosting their annual quiz in support of the Thomas Gresham Bursary Appeal and we are looking forward to an evening of challenging fun!\n\nAs we draw closer to the end of term, I’m delighted that we are once again able to experience the live arts on site. Yesterday evening saw the Ensembles Concert which featured many of the school’s talented ensembles at various stages of their musical journey. Over the coming weeks, we also have the annual Winter Concert featuring the school’s Symphony Orchestra, and the senior production of King Lear to look forward to. I hope to see many of you in person at one of these events.\n\nFinally, I would like to wish the very best of luck to the seven pupils from the Sixth and Eighth Form who are taking part in the GB Rowing Team Trials in Boston, Lincolnshire this weekend.\n\nThursday 11 November 2021\n\nThis morning, we held our annual Act of Remembrance at the school’s cenotaph. This ceremony was led by the school’s Chaplain, with the Last Post and Rouse played by Eashan Shah. It was a poignant moment for the school community to come together to remember all those who have lost their lives in conflict, including the 490 Old Paulines who fell during the first World War. It was first time the whole community has gathered in one place since the start of the pandemic and the clear respect shown by all pupils was extremely moving. Each year our Kayton Library team display the collection donated to the school in 1934 by Digby La Motte, a former Master of the Upper Eighth. He asked that this collection of photos of Paulines and staff who fought in World War I could be displayed on Armistice Day each year as ‘I hold them, one and all, in the most hallowed regard and in sacred affection’. Please do encourage your sons to visit this display before the 18th November if they haven’t yet had the opportunity to do so.\n\nContinuing with a sense of remembrance, we are pleased to host History Hit Live at St Paul’s next Wednesday with Dan Snow OP, as we mark the birthday of Field Marshal Montgomery OP. Although the in person event is now sold out, you can join us remotely for this event via the live stream.\n\nI enjoyed meeting with the Parents’ Group committee earlier this week, to discuss their plans across this academic year and a range of aspects of school life. We are all grateful for all the time that parents dedicate to the school in so many unseen ways and I am excited about the plans being discussed for Christmas.\n\nIn terms of the wider community, our Colet Mentoring programme continues to develop and we are currently trialling Latin homework support with SPJ and also asked some of our Lower and Upper Eighth to trial maths support with some of our Fourth and Fifth Form maths classes. If you have received an email about this, please can you complete the consent form so that your child can participate in the trial.\n\nThursday 4 November 2021\n\nI hope you and your family had a healthy and restful Remedy and your sons have returned refreshed and ready for the second half of term. I send my best wishes to all who are celebrating Diwali in the Pauline community today.\n\nAs you are already aware, the Independent Schools Inspectorate contacted us on Monday about their school inspection from Wednesday this week; we welcomed the team on site this morning. Thank you to those of you who took the time to complete their survey. A number of pupils will be involved in interviews with the inspectors today and tomorrow but, other than this, it’s very much business as usual.\n\nOver Remedy, you should also have received a copy of the school’s Community and Philanthropy Report, which provides further details about the impact of our fundraising activities including the ‘year of firsts’ with initiatives ranging from the first Telethon and Giving Day to the launch of our US bursary appeal to our alumni community. We are delighted that we have raised £14.5m towards the Shaping our Future appeal so far, with the vast majority of funds directed towards our bursary programme, supporting the 143 pupils currently in receipt of awards. We are very grateful to everyone who has supported this campaign – I am humbled by the fact that this includes 44% of parents who are supporting from £1.50 a month upwards.\n\nYou may have also seen in the press that St Paul’s School was part of group of independent schools and leading academies that commissioned a report into the effectiveness of interventions to support teenage mental health. Further details on this are given below. As always, if you feel your son would benefit from any additional support, please do encourage him to speak to his Tutor, Undermaster or the wider pastoral team who are always happy to help.\n\nThursday 14 October 2021\n\nAs we head towards, Remedy, I do hope that you, like me, will feel that this has been an enormously successful half term where the school, if not entirely out of the shadow of the pandemic, has at least been able to demonstrate all aspects of its full character. Being able to attend events and speak to those involved is a privilege of any headship, but especially of being High Master at St Paul’s, and I have been very fortunate during September and October to engage constantly with the pupils and to learn more about their interests and achievements.\n\nThis week, I congratulated the winners of the High Master’s Essay Prize and the Internal Symposium and tonight I am delighted to be attending the Joint Symposium at St Paul’s Girls’ School which will showcase the incredible levels of scholarship at both schools. From there, I will be heading onto the Old Pauline Club Annual Dinner, which this year is the launch celebration for their 150th Anniversary of alumni relations. There will be many further events across the year to celebrate this milestone. Yesterday I went to see the Sixth Form play, Talk Show, written by Alistair McDowell. It was absolutely extraordinary – both funny and intensely moving – with powerful and mature performances. I recommend it most highly.\n\nMay I thank you once again for your support of the lateral flow testing in the school community. We will be distributing supplies of self-tests to all pupils before the end of the week so that (in line with Government advice) they can continue to self-test twice weekly over the half-term break (unless they have tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 90 days in which case they should not carry out any self-tests). We would particularly like all pupils to self-test the day before they return to school after half-term, in order to help us form a fuller picture of the situation at that point. At present, positive case numbers are fluctuating, as can be expected given the local and national situation, although the percentage of pupils affected remains very low. We are not therefore planning to change any of our current measures in place after Remedy. As always, please can you ask your child to record their test result with NHS Test & Trace and the school.\n\nFinally, pupils will also be returning home this week with their copy of our annual school magazine, The Pauline. I hope they enjoy reading it and my thanks go to Suzanne Mackenzie, Teacher of History and Editor of The Pauline, and her editorial team for putting this together.\n\nI wish you and your families a very happy, healthy and restful Remedy.\n\nThursday 7 October 2021\n\nAs I watched the rugby fixtures in the pouring rain last weekend, I certainly concluded that autumn is definitely underway now. However, as you might expect, the enthusiasm of the pupils here at School remains entirely undampened. Not only did I witness the unbridled joy of the 4th XV beating Radley that day in a triumph of mutual support and collaboration, but, at the other end of the age range, I have also enjoyed visiting a number of Fourth Form lessons this week and seeing first-hand how well that group have settled into Pauline scholarship and how much they are enjoying their lessons.\n\nOver the last few weeks, I have also had the privilege of presenting our Junior and Senior Scholars with their silver fish, a uniquely Pauline award, and a reference to the number of fish caught by Peter towards the end of the gospel, which we believe our Founder John Colet had in mind when he stated that ‘There shall be taught in the school children of all nations and countries indifferently, to the number of 153’. Very many congratulations to every pupil who received a fish. Praise is also due to all applicants for the High Master’s Essay prize. It was an enormous pleasure to read the entries and to once again be reminded of the range and depth of research at the top of the school.\n\nThis coming Sunday is World Mental Health Day and, on Tuesday, our Topical Tuesday talk was by Tom Hayhoe OP, who spoke about mental health from his perspective as chair of West London NHS Trust. The talk was hosted by Sam Madden, Deputy Head Mental Health, Wellbeing and Life Skills and you can listen to it here. Sam has also trained a further group of new tutors, teaching and support staff in Youth Mental Health First Aid Training this week. As you know, we understand that our pupils’ mental health and wellbeing is paramount, and this seems a good opportunity to ask you to encourage your son to speak to their tutor or a member of the pastoral team if they have any concerns or feel they need extra support at any time. Many of them will be tired now after such a busy half term and with Remedy a week away so do remind them that the School is here to support them in their struggles as well as to celebrate their triumphs. It’s perfectly normal to experience something of both.\n\nThursday 30 September 2021\n\nThis week we begin our annual celebration of Black History Month led by our new Head of Inclusion, Dr Malcolm Cocks, the Head of Character Education, Dr Phil Gaydon and Dr Amrita Shravat, Teacher of Mathematics. I am grateful to all of them for creating such a rich and celebratory programme of events, speakers and activities, which began today with our guest speaker, Professor David Olusoga OBE, who spoke to pupils on the topic ‘Black and British: A forgotten history’.\n\nThis week has also seen a celebration of European languages, including taster sessions in languages from Europe and further afield, as well as enthusiastic games of pétanque outside my window in Founder’s Court. Continuing the global theme, we were also delighted that Dr Carlos Gane, Teacher of Physics, and has joined Puzhong Yao, Teacher of Economics, in being recognised by the University of Chicago in their Outstanding Educator Awards 2021. Congratulations to him.\n\nCloser to home, I am grateful to members of the Sixth Form who have been undertaking daily lateral flow tests following the rise in positive Covid-19 cases about which we wrote to parents last week. This seems to have had a positive impact and we are, therefore, requesting that the Fourth Form and Lower Eighth also begin daily tests at this point, reporting their results to both the school and the NHS. We will be distributing further self-testing kits to them later this week. On the whole, numbers remain stable but we are continuing to monitor the situation.\n\nAlthough it is certainly the case that the weather is now getting colder, and the evenings darker, there is still a very positive buzz about the school as pupils are involved in so many activities. Can I remind you that parents are now welcome on site for fixtures and I hope that I may see many of you over the coming weekend.\n\nThursday 23 September 2021\n\nIn spite of my communication earlier in the week concerning the rise in Covid cases at the school, we have continued to maintain as full a programme as possible for the community. Although we are still able to welcome parents on site, Public Health England have asked us to consider protocols around large gatherings and we will be asking audience members and visitors to wear masks at events indoors. I would be grateful if parents visiting the site could also follow this guidance. I cannot express how heartening it has been to meet so many of you in person during events in September and, on a personal note, I sincerely hope that this continues without interruption. I would like to express my thanks to colleagues who have been risk assessing activities and also to the pupils for their help with face coverings and lateral flow tests; it’s very important that they continue taking and logging these tests as we monitor the situation. If your son has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days we ask that he does not continue testing. At present, the number of cases does not appear to be climbing but I will keep you informed on this matter as ever.\n\nAlso related to events on site are our new protocols around alcohol. Those of you who have attended events already this term will have noticed that we are no longer serving alcohol at events where pupils are present. This is in line with recommendations to all schools by Kingston and Richmond safeguarding teams, following the Serious Case Review into St Paul’s which was published last year. We are also working closely with our school caterers around supply chain difficulties. You will know from the news that this is a national problem and we are grateful to the teams at CH&Co and on site for working round the challenges presented. I am afraid we may need to seek a little patience from pupils and families if menus are diminished or altered while this situation continues.\n\nEven with this background of challenges largely beyond our control, there remains a real buzz around the site as pupils move freely and enjoy a full range of activities. It was a delight to see so many rugby fixtures last weekend and we have the Young Directors’ showcase this week. Today has been a particular joy in that I have had the pleasure of listening to some of the entries in the High Master’s Internal Symposium based on the essays the Upper Eighth submitted over the summer. The quality and thought-provoking nature of the scholarship across so many subject areas has been simply outstanding and we are very proud of all those involved. I was also invited to speak at the inaugural meeting of the Feminist Soc and was hugely impressed by the thoughtful discussion taking place there too. St Paul’s is a truly exceptional place and I am glad that we are now able to share more of that with our parent body first hand.\n\nThursday 16 September 2021\n\nIt’s a great joy to have reached the stage where, in writing to you weekly, I have met enough of you in person to be able to imagine those on the receiving end of these letters. This week will live long in my memory in that it contained so many events that could not have happened twelve months ago. On Monday evening, I had the opportunity to meet many of our new parents at the New Parents’ Welcome Supper, kindly hosted by the Parents’ Group. It was wonderful to be able to welcome families back onto the school site and I do hope that everyone found it an enjoyable and informative event, emphasising as it did the sense of community that is central to the school. Feedback from the Fourth Form induction programme, details of which can be seen below, was incredibly positive.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, I had the great pleasure of attending the joint concert between St Paul’s School and St Paul’s Girls’ School – my first live event in the Wathen Hall. The quality of the music-making was simply inspiring, as was the genuine and equal collaboration between the two schools. Many congratulations to the Directors of Music, Mark Wilderspin (St Paul’s School), Leigh O’Hara (St Paul’s Girls’ School) and the wider team, and especially to all of the talented young musicians from both schools involved.\n\nAs September continues, so does our events programme and I hope that I will be able to meet many more of you in person soon. At present, although we do have positive cases of Covid-19 amongst the pupils, we are following Public Heath England’s guidelines and advice and have not been required to adjust our arrangements. I understand that the boys are taking their Lateral Flow Tests in good numbers and would encourage them to continue to do so in order to help us manage the present situation.\n\nThursday 9 September 2021\n\nAny pupils visiting the library this week (and, for the first time in eighteenth months they are indeed all able to visit the library) will be able to see on display two books donated to the school by diarist and Pauline Samuel Pepys in 1675. Our wise library team, led by Hilary Cummings, have chosen these particular objects from the archive to remind us that the school has survived prolonged closure and disruption before. In the 1600s, it endured complete closure through plague followed by the destruction of the buildings in the Great Fire of London. Our existence as a thriving and successful community, three and a half centuries later, is testament to the success of our predecessors in coming back from disaster with confidence and determination. Remembering this presents us with an opportunity to celebrate our own re-emergence back into a world and community where we have renewed freedom to move around the site and run lessons and activities in the best possible way.\n\nOn a personal note, I have been delighted to see the younger pupils claim their space in the new buildings where I have my study. The Atrium is already a hive of activity and the pupils have also been outside enjoying the sunny weather. I want to offer a particular welcome to anyone new to the school this year – both pupils and staff. The induction programme for the new pupils has been in full swing but please do not hesitate to contact tutors or undermasters if your son has any concerns or worries.\n\nI am also very grateful to the pupils for their helpful and sensible behaviour during the on-site testing on Friday and Monday. We did have a small number of positive results amongst the pupil body. We have reported our findings to Public Health England who have confirmed that our numbers are in line with expectations. The school has followed positive case guidance and no further action is required at present. Please do remind your sons to continue to take their lateral flow tests twice per week at home and to report their results to both the school at CovidManagement@StPaulsSchool.org.uk and the NHS. It is very important that this is done regularly as requested to keep all of the community as safe as possible and to enable us to continue to operate in this more open way without year group bubbles.\n\nAs ever, we have news of pupil success to share with you. Over the summer holidays, our First VIII made the final of the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta, beating the US Champions along the way; many congratulations to all our rowers. Also to Krish Patel, who played for the English Schools Cricket Association team against MCC at Lord’s earlier this week, Derin Acaroglu, who represented the Independent Schools Tennis Association team in their victory against the All England Lawn Tennis Club in July, and to Harry Rimmer, who recently won a BAFTA in the Game Concept category.\n\nWe are also delighted that we can hold in person events again, including a concert next week in conjunction with St Paul’s Girls’ School. In addition, tonight at 7.30pm is Imp Soc: The 15th Anniversary Show, in the Samuel Pepys Theatre. Our improvised comedy society will celebrate their anniversary with a one-night gala performance featuring previous Imp Soc captains and committee members, including now professional comedians. All proceeds are being donated to the school’s bursary fund. I hope some of you will be able to join them for what I am assured will be a riotous evening of mirth and merriment!\n\nWednesday 7 July 2021\n\nIn some ways it does not seem as though a whole academic year has passed since I first wrote to you as High Master. However, so much has happened since September, that I feel that I have known the school community for very much longer and, although I have met so few of you in person, I am grateful for your warmth and support this year.\n\nIn the final days of term, there is still much to share. The Upper Eighth Leavers’ Ceremony yesterday was a true celebration of the pupils’ achievements during their time here. I want to thank publicly out-going Captain and Vice-Captain of School, Isaac Wighton and Vivek Raman; they have offered me great insight and wise counsel in my first year. And as we look to the future, you may wish to read more about their successors, George Davies and William Shackleton below.\n\nI am also pleased to announce a new post for the school, Head of Character Education. Dr Phil Gaydon will be taking on this role and will be working to ensure that school values are embedded into pupils’ lives and experiences, and that this is given focus alongside the Academic and Co-curricular programmes such that Paulines leave the school entirely ready to lead purposeful lives in the wider world.\n\nAlso looking to next term, you will have read headlines over the last day about the removal of bubbles in schools from September. This is very welcome news and will enable us to make positive adjustments for the pupils. Unfortunately, we are still required to be able to return to bubbles part way through the year if asked to do so therefore we will, as a team, be looking at options over the summer to lift as many restrictions as possible while keeping bubbles a possibility. For this reason, we will be remaining with the plans for one more year of horizontal tutoring, which also offers continuity of tutoring from this year for most boys. However, we are delighted that we can also put in opportunities for vertical interaction between pupils as often and soon as possible. It will be a real joy to see year groups mixing and older boys able to lead groups and act as role models once more.\n\nOn a similar note, we had already agreed with St Paul’s Girls’ School not to hold Colet Day in its customary form this October. During this period where to plan an event for 1000s still seems extremely optimistic, we will be working with them and other members of the school community to determine how best to reflect our founder’s significance in the future.\n\nFinally, may I take this opportunity to thank all of the St Paul’s staff, (whether they work in teaching, administration, operations or any other area) for their hard work and commitment during what has been without doubt the most challenging school year in any of our memories. And, to quote a newsletter sent to the Junior School in 1941, which Mrs Shaw and I have been sharing with the pupils:\n\n‘A tribute to the courage and cheerfulness of the boys who went through this disturbed time is due.’\n\nThe St Paul’s pupils have been inspiring in their optimism, co-operation and resilience over the past academic year. Term finishes for them at 11.15am tomorrow and I wish each and every one of them a wonderful summer.\n\nThursday 1 July 2021\n\nAs we draw closer to the end of term, our newsletter is once again full of the achievements of your sons in so many different fields. That they have managed to do so much despite all the challenges of this very unusual year is a testament to their strength of character and commitment, as well as due to the support of our talented staff. Junior Prize Giving on Tuesday (although it did clash with a certain football match) was a shining example of this. We heard spoken Latin, enjoyed an extract of a radio play, and imagined eating 1000 donuts, amongst other experiences. OP Charlie Fraser, Co-Founder of TERN, the Entrepreneurial Refugee Network, spoke to pupils and encouraged them to aspire to change the world.\n\nFurther inspiration was also available this week when the new First VIII boat was named Doug Perrin, after our Head of Languages. Our grateful thanks go to Doug for all his support of the SPS Boat Club and to all our teachers who give up their time at weekends and in the holidays to support our co-curricular activities. I would like to offer particular congratulations to our athletes who won 5 out of 5 races at the Achilles Schools’ Relays.\n\nOn a less cheerful note, you will have seen that there was a further Covid-19 positive case today, this time within the Sixth Form. After discussion with Public Health England, we are reintroducing face coverings in all communal areas. Please may I ask you to ensure that your sons bring a face mask to school from Monday to wear when moving about the school in corridors.\n\nThursday 24 June 2021\n\nAs you will be aware, positive cases of Covid-19 amongst young people have been rising this week. At the moment this has been minimal at St Paul’s but we have had one more case, this time in the Upper Eighth. I am very grateful to those concerned for their help and speedy communication; please may I request that you continue to encourage your sons to self-test using the lateral flow devices distributed in school and to report their results. We all have a responsibility to do as much as we can to ensure the majority of pupils can remain in school through to the end of term. All year groups will have access to further supplies of lateral flow devices this week. In addition, we will be distributing a PCR test to all Lower Eighth pupils. This is part of a Government directed quality control exercise that is being run nationwide in the effort to monitor the effectiveness of the self-testing programme. Parents of Lower Eighth pupils can access further information about the PCR quality control initiative here. Sadly, we have had to cancel or re-think a number of events planned this term in the light of continued restrictions around Covid management.\n\nFor those parents who are affected by the continued closure of Hammersmith Bridge, the planning applications for the ferry have now been validated by the boroughs and further information about how you can comment on these plans has been provided. Please rest assured that the shuttle buses are booked to continue next term and we are also increasing flexi-boarding which may benefit some pupils.\n\nOn a more positive note, I continue to be so impressed by the range of activities available and with the engagement and talent of our pupils and staff, in spite of the restrictions around bubbling. This week, our Theology and Philosophy Teacher, Miss Ramsay-Overall, gave a thought-provoking and informative talk on the continued significance of Windrush Day, and our Fifth Form were able to learn valuable business skills through the school’s entrepreneurship programme, Start It. On the track and river, our athletes and rowers continue to excel. Tomorrow, some of our Eighth Form music students will be able to enjoy a private recital by one of the visiting music teachers, pianist Ivana Gavric, with renowned cellist, Matthew Barley, before their appearance at the Cheltenham Festival, and next week our Fourth and Fifth Form will be taking on Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales in a live streamed performance. We move towards the end of this most unusual year at a pace and in a positive way.\n\nThursday 17 June 2021\n\nAs those of you with younger children at the school will be aware, we were sad to announce earlier this week that, after over five years as Head of St Paul’s Juniors, Maxine Shaw will be leaving us in September 2022 to take up the post of Head of Danes Hill and Bevendean. She will leave us with our heartfelt thanks and best wishes. I already knew Maxine from both of our first headships and it has been a delight to work with her during the past academic year as colleagues at St Paul’s. Her influence here has been considerable and I truly value her pupil-centred approach and her personal warmth – qualities that have moved St Paul’s Juniors forward during her tenure. Along with the Governing Body and the school executive, I will lead the very important process of finding her successor and we will keep you informed of our progress.\n\nThis week we were also in touch with Fifth Form parents after a confirmed Covid-19 case – our first for some time. May I please take this opportunity once again to remind you how valuable it is for pupils to take the Lateral Flow Tests twice a week and report their results to both the school and the NHS. Please ensure that you keep your child away from school if they have any symptoms of Covid-19 and that you notify covidmanagement@stpaulsschool.org.uk as soon as possible in the event of a positive test result.\n\nOn a much happier note, we were able to run our virtual Apposition yesterday. I was extremely impressed by the quality of the school’s Declaimers and with the beautiful musical interlude. As you know, Apposition dates back to the school’s foundation in 1509 and was originally intended as the means by which the Mercers’ Company could assess the teaching staff and the High Master in particular. Although it is now purely ceremonial, it showcases the very best scholarship and academic curiosity of our pupils and I am very glad that their speeches would have allowed me to keep my job!\n\nI was glad to see some parents on Saturday spectating at the cricket matches. Parents who wish to come and watch their son playing from any Saturday going forward are welcome to attend, but please do register your visit once on-site using the QR scanner and follow spectators’ guidance that was sent to parents last week.\n\nI’m also delighted to announce that we are launching a new school merchandise range today. I would like to draw particular attention to ‘London in Silence’, an impressive and striking collection of photographs taken during the height of the pandemic by Hugo Berman in the Lower Eighth.\n\nThursday 10 June 2021\n\nI hope you are all having a good week so far and the return to school after Remedy has been smooth. Many of you will be aware that Ofsted published their report into sexual harassment within schools earlier today and their full report is available to read here. We welcome the report and are encouraged that most of their recommendations were already included in our action plan, shared with you last term. Our work in this area is very much underway but we will now take time to review the full findings of the report and take any further appropriate measures to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all children, keeping you updated as we do so. You can also read my statement as Chair of HMC here.\n\nAs you may know, Children’s and Adolescent Literature is a personal passion of mine as well as an area I have researched in the past. I am delighted, therefore, that St Paul’s School is the Education Partner of the Barnes Children’s Literature Festival which opens next week. There will be a free programme for state primary schools in Tower Hamlets, followed by one for primary schools in Richmond, Wandsworth and neighbouring boroughs the following week. The public programme is over the weekend of 26 – 27 June and more information is given below. Please do consider getting involved.\n\nFriday 28 May 2021\n\nI hope that your sons are looking forward to a well-earned Remedy and, now that May seems to have decided to give us a few warmer days, that the weather will be kinder to them than it has been recently. Pupils have all received further Covid-19 test kits this week and please can I remind you once again, that it is important that they continue twice-weekly testing and reporting their results to both the school and the NHS throughout the upcoming break.\n\nAs ever, our thoughts are with pupils in the Upper Eighth and Sixth Form who have had such an unusual experience this year. We will be offering two bespoke programmes of events for when they return after the break. The Sixth Form’s activities are centred around the Entrepreneurship course which has been run very successfully over the last three years. For the Upper Eighth, we will be offering a varied co-curricular programme on the themes of ‘what you’ve missed’ and ‘try something new’; there will also be a choice of 40 University Foundation Courses as well as various life skill programmes (selection form to follow on Tuesday). The aim is to allow pupils to have some of the experiences that have been disrupted during the pandemic, as well as giving them the opportunity to try some new things in which the school excels. Sixth Form parents have already been contacted by Dr Gilks and will receive a more detailed programme of events the week after Remedy. Parents with sons in the Upper Eighth will receive a further detailed communication about this today. I do hope that these opportunities will be inspiring, useful and enjoyable.\n\nI also wanted to let you know that we have been giving a great deal of consideration to the tutor structure for 2021/22. Although we are well aware that many have missed the usual vertical tutoring this year, we feel it necessary to maintain operational flexibility next year in case the need to bubble by year group remains or returns. In order to avoid creating vertical groups which then need to be unpicked we will, therefore, retain a horizontal structure in September. We will be finalising the allocation of tutors after half-term, and considering any potential improvements from this year’s model. Both you and your sons will receive further information on this before the end of term.\n\nIn the meantime, may I wish you a positive week ahead. It’s hard to believe that we will be beginning the final half of the final term of this extraordinary academic year but it will be June by the time I write to you again. I am very much looking forward to experiencing St Paul’s in the true summer months.\n\nThursday 20 May 2021\n\nIt has been another very busy week at St Paul’s with a whole host of weather to contend with too. The hailstones on Monday and Tuesday were certainly spectacular but none of this seems to have dampened the spirits of our pupils. This week we celebrate their achievements in athletics and tennis as well as their continued enthusiasm and commitment to our partnership programmes below.\n\nI was also delighted that St Paul’s was able to host the Music Teachers Association Annual Conference at the end of last week and thanks go to our Director of Music, Mark Wilderspin, and our Music Centre Manager, Karenne Mills, for all their work on this event. It was a privilege to welcome the conference, albeit largely virtually – to our site. The MTA is the largest and longest established association of music teachers in the UK and the conference indicated that St Paul’s is well respected in this area and very much part of their family going forward. Personally, if I thought I understood the value of music education before the pandemic, how much more do I appreciate it now? It has never been clearer that music is innately human and, therefore, a basic human right, and there has never been more work to do to make sure it is delivered in schools in a way that benefits all. I cannot wait to hear your sons perform at live concerts as soon as possible but, in the meantime, I am grateful to the jazz groups who participated in a recorded event for the conference. They were brilliant.\n\nThursday 13 May 2021\n\nI would like to begin this week by paying tribute to both the pupils and the teaching staff as we continue with the assessments for GCSE, A level and Pre U. The word ‘unprecedented’ has been overused over the past twelve months but it is hard not to employ it when focusing on the experience of this cohort and the workload of their teachers at this time. I do have faith in the resilience and expertise of the St Paul’s community but it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge all that is being achieved by all parties this term. Perhaps appropriately, this week is Mental Health Awareness week and this Friday’s tutor group meetings will be discussions around this year’s theme of ‘connecting with nature’. I hope that your sons find the sessions useful. As always, if they need any additional support – whatever their year group but not least if they are in the Sixth Form or Upper Eighth – then please do encourage them to chat with their Tutor or our wider pastoral team.\n\nGiven this context, I am especially proud of all that the school continues to achieve beyond the classroom. Last weekend saw the first athletics club meet of the term with the team finishing in a credible third place overall and with eight individual victories. Many congratulations are due to the Fifth Formers who filled every track and field event in the intermediate age group while the Sixth Form are on study leave. I am also very proud that our pupils continue to offer dedicated support to students at other schools through the Colet Mentoring programme and many thanks go to our mentors of the week, Arav Patel for covering sessions at short notice and Ali Imam-Sadique for working carefully on complex extension materials, week after week. Stepping up to help others must always be central to the Pauline experience.\n\nFinally, you will have seen the Government’s latest guidance regarding Covid-19 management in schools. From Monday 17 May, all pupils over the age of 11 will still be required to wear a face covering when travelling on school or public transport but they are no longer required to wear face coverings inside or outside the school buildings (including within classrooms and all corridors). Your child may continue to wear a face covering if he chooses to do so; all pupils must continue to bring a face covering to school as these may be required at short notice in exceptional circumstances (for example, if a positive case is identified within their year group).\n\nThese new face covering rules do not replace any other measures in place, including social distancing, year group bubbles and hygiene requirements, which all still apply. In addition, we will be sending further Covid-19 testing kits home with the pupils this week. Please can I remind you that testing continues to be important and pupil results should be logged with the NHS and the school. Further details of how to report testing, along with our updated Risk Assessment, are available on the Parent Portal. If you have any concerns or questions about these changes, please email covidmanagement@stpaulsschool.org.uk\n\nThursday 6 May 2021\n\nI hope that you and your families enjoyed the long Bank Holiday weekend. On a personal note, the weekends now seem much improved by the advent of fixtures on site. It is a great shame that parents are not yet able to attend but we look forward to changes in the guidelines which will make that possible and give me opportunity to meet so many more of you in person as we support the teams. I would like to offer my congratulations to the 1st XI cricketers who, through a combination of patience and skill, were victorious over Dulwich College on Saturday!\n\nThe school has also enjoyed great success in other areas this week. St Paul’s teams won five out of seven awards in the first round of the Young Enterprise Company of the Year competition. I also look forward to hearing how Project Eden get on in the second round of the competition in due course.\n\nThe school site during the working day is quiet by contrast now the Upper Eighth and Sixth Form are on study leave; we wish them all the best during this time. As always, if you feel your child needs additional support with their wellbeing during this time, please do encourage them to speak to their tutor or our wider pastoral team who will be able to help.\n\nFriday 30 April 2021\n\nI hope that your sons enjoyed the Giving Day activities on Tuesday and Wednesday this week. Giving Day finished at 9pm on Wednesday and has raised over £335,000 for our bursary fund and partnership work. This is an amazing achievement and we are so very grateful to all of you who donated and supported this event to ensure that we can extend and support this valuable work. Thank you.\n\nParents will have received my email on Monday with the school’s action plan in response to Everyone’s Invited. I hope that you find the document comprehensive and reassuring that we continue to take this matter extremely seriously. As mentioned in that communication, there will be moments of consultation with parents this term and beyond and you will be receiving more information about these in the coming weeks.\n\nAs you know, we were visited by two Ofsted inspectors this week as part of their national review into sexual violence amongst school aged children. This was not an inspection and, as such, I do not have formal findings to share with you. However, the team were grateful to staff and pupils at St Paul’s for the welcome they received and the positive and open way in which everyone engaged with the topics discussed. These conversations will now contribute anonymously to the overall review and we are pleased to have had this opportunity to be part of this process.\n\nOnce again, we share with you the talent of your children in so many different fields and we are so proud of all that they achieve. This included victories in the first block Cricket fixture for over a year and a half and success for our rowers in the Hammersmith Regatta.\n\nAs the Upper Eighth head off on study leave today, I want to thank those of you who attended the Upper Eighth Parents’ Information Evening with James Gazet, Deputy Head – Academic, and Hannah Warner, Upper Eighth Undermaster, last night. I hope you enjoyed hearing about our plans for their final term.\n\nThursday 22 April 2021\n\nI hope that you and your families had a restful and relaxing Easter Remedy and were able to start to visit family and friends again outdoors. The sun is out over the school playing fields today and the pupils have returned to the site filled with optimism.\n\nIt has been wonderful to see the resumption of sporting fixtures and cricket success. We were also delighted to see two Old Paulines in the winning Cambridge Crew in the Boat Race this year.\n\nNext week, we will be celebrating St Paul’s School’s first ever Giving Day on 27-28 April to raise funds for our bursary places and partnership work. We hope the pupils enjoy the activities on site during the day and that you are able to participate in our digital campaign and events, including a talk by Sir Lloyd Dorfman CBE (OP), Travelex Founder and Spear’s Philanthropist of the Year 2019.\n\nFurther supplies of Covid-19 self test kits will be distributed to pupils tomorrow and we would appreciate your ongoing support in encouraging twice weekly testing and reporting of results in line with the information circulated at the end of last term and available on the Parent Portal.\n\nThursday 25 March 2021\n\nI hope that you and your families are looking forward to the Easter Remedy at the end of this week and that your sons have a restful and relaxing break. I would like to remind you all that the Department of Education recommends that Covid-19 testing continues twice weekly during the holidays and you should have received an email with further details.\n\nFor those in the exam years, you should have received an email earlier this week regarding the plans for assessment during May. Although we are still awaiting final information from the exam boards, we hope this outline gives some sense of direction and reassurance for your sons, as well as the opportunity for them to have a proper break from studying at the beginning of the Easter holidays. If your son has any concerns, his tutor, subject teachers and the pastoral team are here to help so please do encourage him to speak to them.\n\nDespite the many challenges of this term, it has been wonderful to see the school site full of pupils this month and to share in their many achievements. After the Easter break, we will be celebrating St Paul’s School’s first ever Giving Day on 27-28 April to raise funds for our bursary places and partnership work. There will be fundraising activities on site for the pupils during the day and we will be encouraging all parents, alumni and friends of the school to get involved with our digital campaign and events. We are very grateful to those who have already agreed to support Giving Day with match-funding pledges, and I do hope we can count on your support and involvement during the day.\n\nI remain sorry that parents cannot come on site at the moment. The cherry trees in Founder’s Court are absolutely beautiful. I know this time last year everyone was leaving the school site and we could not enjoy them, but this year we look forward to the summer with optimism. I hope you and your family have an enjoyable Easter.\n\nThursday 18 March 2021\n\nAs we approach the Easter Remedy at the end of next week and the opportunity for your sons to have a well-earned break, I just wanted to take this opportunity to say how impressed I have been with the mature way they have all adapted to the return to the school site and to the Covid-19 procedures which are in place. As of today, there hasn’t been a positive Covid-19 test result since our return to school, but please do encourage your sons to continue to self-test for Covid-19 every 3-4 days, i.e. two tests per week. They must record the results with both NHS Test and Trace and with the school. We have recently received advice from the Department of Education that pupils and staff will be strongly encouraged to self-test throughout the Easter break and further self-test kits will be distributed next week.\n\nI have received a number of letters this week regarding our response to the ‘Everyone’s Invited’ email sent last Thursday and I appreciate the thoughtful feedback provided. I wish to reassure you that the assemblies and tutor group meetings held this week are only the starting point in the journey towards lasting cultural change. We have a very strong safeguarding culture within the school and our designated safeguarding leads and tutors are always available to pupils. We were already reviewing our PSHE structure and will be further examining what we need to review around the teaching of relationships and consent. We will be taking all of these recommendations forward over the coming weeks and months.\n\nThursday 11 March 2021\n\nIt has been wonderful this week to see all our pupils return to the school site and the corridors and classrooms become alive with learning, debate and the chatter of friendship again. Monday was also International Women’s Day, which we have celebrated across the week with a number of events. I hope that our pupils have found them interesting and enlightening. This evening, we host another key school event with the biennial classics lecture in memory of former members of staff Cotter and Cruickshank, and there is still time to join this event if you are interested.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that Start it Pro, our incubator programme for new start-up businesses, has chosen two young companies for this year’s scheme. Further details are given on our news pages. In addition, we are very pleased to announce that St Paul’s School is running two Physics summer schools again this year for state school pupils in Year 10 on Particle Physics and the Magic of Materials. If you know of any children who have an interest in studying this subject at A Level and beyond, please do encourage them to apply.\n\nOn a more sombre and serious note, parents may well be aware of information shared by Everyone’s Invited, a movement committed to exposing rape culture and inappropriate sexual behaviour. You will be receiving a letter later today with more information, which will also provide sources of advice and support for any pupils affected.\n\nThursday 4 March 2021\n\nI hope that you and your families are keeping well and are looking forward to the return to site on Monday. All the information and the revised risk assessments for your son’s return to school are available on the Parent Portal. I realise there is a great deal of information to digest, but please do take the time to read those documents carefully and make your son aware of the operational processes that will be in place from Monday 8 March. The Covid-19 testing programme has run smoothly this week and I am grateful to my colleagues for their efforts in managing this logistical undertaking.\n\nIn assembly on Monday, I spoke to pupils about how, in my view, a school is about people not buildings and how the St Paul’s community has worked so hard to remain a school even though we have not been housed on one site this term. I feel enormously privileged to be writing to you from our new state of the art teaching block. However, beautiful as this building is, the beating heart of the school depends upon pupils and I cannot wait for our site to burst back to life next week.\n\nOnce again, we celebrate a number of achievements by your sons, as well as a couple of school-wide events. That the pupils continue to flourish and engage under such trying circumstances is a testament to their talent and positive attitude. However, I realise that there may be some pupils who may be apprehensive about returning to the school site after over half a term away, and would encourage them to speak to their Tutor or Undermaster about any concerns.\n\nThis evening, I am looking forward to hosting Pauline Perspectives, our annual debate organised by the SPS Parents’ Group, which this year is on the very topical issue of ‘Free speech trumps all: Twitter tantrums should be tolerated, not terminated’. There is still time to join this event if you would like to.\n\nThursday 25 February 2021\n\nParents will have received earlier today an email with information about the Covid-19 testing programme which we are required to undertake before your son’s return to school on Monday 8 March. As I am sure you can understand, it is a huge logistical undertaking, so please do return the form included in that email to us by return. I am greatly looking forward to having all our pupils back and the school site becoming a hive of activity again.\n\nAlthough continued communication about the management of the school during the pandemic has been necessary, I did still want to celebrate pupil achievements and all that the St Paul’s community continues to do, even in the current circumstances. Once again I am so very proud of the talent of your sons and hope you will enjoy reading about their endeavours. We had considerable success this year in the United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad and four distinctions in the second round of the British Mathematical Olympiad. Many congratulations also to Christian Duetoft who has joined Malachi Cohen in qualifying for the GB Olympic Trials in swimming. An amazing achievement.\n\nFinally, may I express my gratitude to those of you who took the time to complete the parent questionnaire. We were very touched to receive so many positive comments, thank you, but we also take your constructive suggestions on board and are currently looking to address some of these areas of concern.\n\nSAH\n\nThursday 11 February 2021\n\nI am delighted to be writing to you once again and grateful to Dr Clough for providing the weekly newsletter while I have needed to pace my workload during my recovery from Covid-19. I have certainly learnt a great deal about what the disease can do but also about the support of the St Paul’s community and I now feel almost entirely back to full capacity.\n\nI have continued to speak to the pupils every week through assembly and, as we approach Remedy, I congratulated them on all they have achieved in spite of the challenge of not being able to come on site. This week’s newsletter showcases many of the pupils’ amazing achievements over the last few weeks as their scholarship and talent continues to shine through. Our musicians will be releasing their excellent Spring Term Recital later today, there have been successes in Philosophy and French, prize-winning essays in International Relations and, in particular, many congratulations to Malachi Cohen who has qualified for the GB Olympic trials in swimming.\n\nEqually, I am proud of the way our pupils continue to contribute to the community beyond St Paul’s. The Colet Mentoring scheme reached its 1000th mentoring session this week, the Thomas Gresham Committee were absolutely delighted by the way St Paul’s Juniors embraced the Readathon Challenge to raise over £10,000 for the Thomas Gresham Bursary Award, and the sponsored games half this week has already raised over £5,000 for Beyond Ourselves, our partner charity in Zambia.\n\nThank you very much to all of you who have completed the parent questionnaire about our remote learning provision which closed earlier today. It will provide us with very valuable feedback to inform the second half of term and we will provide you with further information after the break. I very much hope that we will be able to welcome your sons back to the school site soon and we await the latest Government announcement scheduled for 22 February to give us an indication of when and how that may be. We also continue to await Government updates regarding assessment for GCSE and A level this year and we are mindful of the pressure such uncertainty must be placing on those in exam years. As ever, we will be in touch as soon as we know more and do encourage your sons to get in touch with us if they need support in any way.\n\nThey may not have mentioned it, but I did ask the pupils to pass on my thanks to their families for all you have done to support them and their learning this term. A school community is built on the triangle of school, student and home and I am very grateful for the support of the St Paul’s families whilst we all continue to live in challenging times. I do wish you all a very healthy and restful Remedy.\n\nSAH\n\nThursday 4 February 2021\n\nI hope you are keeping well and that your children continue to enjoy their remote schooling. The High Master continues to focus on a full recovery from Covid-19 so once again you are hearing from me and we send Sally-Anne all our best wishes.\n\nThis week, we have been celebrating LGBT+ History week, which began on Monday with an assembly by the High Master about how to be an LGBT+ ally and a very well received talk by world renowned rugby referee, Nigel Owens MBE, who gave an inspirational overview of his life. One message that stood out for me was ‘It doesn’t matter who you are, it doesn’t matter what country you come from, or what the colour of your skin is, or your sexual orientation or your religious beliefs. None of that should matter one bit. All that should matter is that you are a decent human being.’ Aye to that.\n\nThe whole country was saddened this week by the loss of a truly decent human being in the inspirational figure of Captain Sir Tom Moore who raised both the spirits of the nation and millions of pounds for NHS charities. Tuesday night’s Topical Tuesday was a talk from the NHS frontline by Dr Matthew Barnard OP who has been working in intensive care at St Bartholomew’s Hospital throughout the pandemic. He spoke about how treatment for the virus had moved on from the first wave and he finished with an uplifting video of NHS staff linked to the Dickens’ quote ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times’ to underline the astonishing way in which NHS staff have pulled together.\n\nIn its own way the St Paul’s School community has also drawn closer during these unprecedented times and Dr Barnard’s words were an important reminder to us all to continue to look out for each other. Once again, we would like to remind you that if your child needs any additional support or you have any concerns about their wellbeing, please do contact their tutor or Undermaster. We will also be sending out a survey to all Senior School pupils and parents before Remedy to gather feedback about how remote learning has felt so far this term.\n\nThose of you with sons in the examination years yesterday received another update from James Gazet, Deputy Head Academic. Ofqual’s consultation closed last week and they have announced they will publish their findings and ‘next steps’ during the week commencing 22 February. In addition, Edexcel, one of the IGCSE exam boards that the school uses, has also announced that it will not be holding IGCSE exams this summer. Hot off the press, our other IGCSE exam board announced this morning that they too are looking into alternatives to examinations this summer. The picture is slowly becoming clearer.\n\nAs we approach Remedy, next week’s Club competition will be a school-wide sponsored games half. Pupils will be encouraged to participate in a meaningful amount of exercise while asking their family and friends to sponsor them in support of Beyond Ourselves, the school’s partner charity in Zambia. We hope you will support their endeavours.\n\nDr Fran Clough, Surmaster\n\nThursday 28 January 2021\n\nI am delighted to have the opportunity to provide the introduction this week as the High Master is scaling back on some duties in order to continue her full recovery from Covid-19. I hope that you and your families are keeping safe and well, and perhaps managed to get some brief enjoyment from the fleeting snow last weekend. It was a nice change to arrive on the school site on Monday morning to be greeted by four snowmen.\n\nWe are grateful for our continued sense of community which gives strength and support in these difficult times. Our pupils report that they are enjoying their lessons and the daily engagement with their teachers and peers. These interactions have been further enhanced now that pupils are expected to have their cameras on. Over recent weeks I have been holding remote meetings with groups of pupils that received impressive reports at the end of last term and it has been enormously heartening to learn how positive the boys are about the provision they are receiving and grateful for their teachers’ efforts under these challenging circumstances. We do, of course, remain mindful about the amount of screen time experienced by pupils, and we are actively looking at strategies to strike the right balance without reducing the quality of our provision.\n\nWe were very pleased by the positive response of Sixth Form parents to last night’s virtual parents’ evening. My thanks to those of you who have made contact with colleagues to offer feedback.\n\nAs always, we are monitoring Government announcements as they come and putting into place plans to react to them in the best interests of your sons. Those of you who have pupils in examination years will have heard again about the developing picture. We hope you find these communications helpful and supportive.\n\nAs the UK passed the tragic milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 related deaths earlier this week, we were grateful to Rory Kinnear OP, award-winning actor and playwright, for sharing his personal experiences in our Topical Tuesday event. Rory lost his sister, Karina, to Covid-19 in May 2020, and is very grateful to those who attended the talk and supported his fundraising activities to provide a sensory garden at Roy Kinnear house where she lived. You can listen to a recording of his talk below, alongside details of our future events.\n\nRory also talked about his life on the stage and this week’s co-curricular article focuses on the wide range of arts societies currently available to pupils during this lockdown – from watercolours to music tech club to play reading societies, there is plenty for pupils to get involved with and enjoy. All these activities are advertised to the pupils daily and staff are continually coming up with inventive ways to transfer what we would naturally do face to face into an engaging virtual setting. Please do encourage your sons to take part. The latest Club competition also focused on art this week and the results of the Paint-a-Picture are detailed below.\n\nNext week, we celebrate LGBT+ History Week, with a variety of talks and events led by the school’s diversity society, Spectrum, and an assembly by the High Master. I am particularly looking forward to the keynote speech by rugby referee Nigel Owens MBE, a passionate advocate for LGBT+ awareness within sport.\n\nI hope that you and your families remain well and the school continues to provide your sons with a sense of stability, scholarship and support during these uncertain times.\n\nDr Fran Clough, Surmaster\n\nThursday 21 January 2021\n\nAlthough we continue to live in difficult times, and the presence of your sons on site at school is sorely missed, I have been heartened this week to come across several examples which demonstrate that our sense of community is as strong as ever. Speaking online to some of our younger senior school pupils, I was moved by their advocacy of the teaching body. They are feeling connected through lessons and enjoy the content and the pace. They told me that even subjects which might not seem to lend themselves to remote teaching, such as Art and PE, are going well. One complaint was that online provision gives access to even more clubs and it’s difficult to choose! Whilst I don’t want to look at the current situation through rose coloured spectacles and we do know that in-person teaching is best, I am still proud of how our pupils and their teachers are responding to the current challenge.\n\nOther reasons to be cheerful include the continued success of our pupils in a number of areas. I was thrilled to see other Heads sharing results of Secondary School Online Chess Battles on social media in that we found ourselves top of the table. Huge congratulations to all pupils who participated. We have also been sharing news of extraordinary success in the British Olympiads for both Maths and Physics.\n\nEqually, our pupils continue to contribute to the community beyond St Paul’s. This week we launched ‘Colet Mentoring‘ with EasyA – an app which supports peer mentoring and is being taken up by other schools nationally. Members of the Eighth Form have also been volunteering with the vaccine rollout in Barnes. I am always impressed by the manner in which Paulines care about the bigger picture in this way. The commitment of the pupils who run EcoSoc has been commendable and their recent blog draws attention to how they are feeling positive about several world stories, including the US’s return to the Paris Climate Accord.\n\nI have written before about how I draw enormous hope from the attitudes and resilience of young people, and of the current Paulines in particular. I suspect many Heads are writing about the performance of Amanda Gorman, the Youth Poet Laureate who wowed the world at the Presidential inauguration this week, so please forgive me for following a trend. However, her assertion that ‘there is always light, if only we’re brave enough to see it, if only we’re brave enough to be it’ really struck a chord with me. There is no doubting that there is darkness in our current situation but I am very grateful for the pupils and staff of St Paul’s School who continued to provide so much light.\n\nSAH\n\nThursday 14 January 2021\n\nI hope that you and your sons managed to have a restful Christmas break and are enjoying the start to the new term. As you have heard from my colleagues, I had the full 2020 experience, contracting Covid-19 as term ended and I have had a phased return to work this week. I cannot express my gratitude to members of the school community in strong enough terms, given their wonderful support over this period. You will have seen first hand how senior colleagues stepped up during a time of great uncertainty in education and I had so many kind messages from staff and parents. The experience has only cemented further how fortunate I feel to be here at St Paul’s.\n\nEqually, I am conscious of the stresses upon us all during this strange period of history. The global news cycle alone can be distressing and, like people the world over, the St Paul’s community are relieved that democracy has held in the USA. However, it’s a world where young people might easily be unsettled and the hope of the team here is that school can remain a place of stability, inspiration and support, even though we are operating remotely. It is really encouraging that our attendance at the beginning of the first week of term stands at 99.7% as our pupils return to remote learning and this clearly indicates how connected they remain to their peers and teachers.\n\nFor those in the Sixth Form and Upper Eighth in particular, we recognise that the ongoing debate and indecision around public exams is unhelpful for pupils’ mental health. We will keep you fully updated of any further developments as the situation evolves. Our pastoral team is always available to any pupil who may need extra support, and I would like to remind all pupils to speak to their tutor or Undermaster if they feel they need additional help or just a friendly ear.\n\nWe also appreciate the importance of co-curricular activities for the pupils’ wellbeing at this time, and in particular, the opportunity to exercise. We are delighted to offer up to five different live staff-led sporting sessions in each of the games halves, supplemented by Monday and Friday lunchtime circuits and sport specific programmes from a variety of sports, as well as online PE lessons as part of the curriculum. Pupils will be able to view all these activities, alongside Societies and music, on the Co-curricular Hub.\n\nWe continue to offer our well-received virtual events programme to our wider community and I am looking forward to the return of Topical Tuesdays and the Entrepreneurship Network taking place next week. The first Topical Tuesday features Shanker Singham OP discussing the emerging UK trade and domestic regulatory policy in the wake of Brexit. Please do encourage your sons to sign up for these events too as they offer a unique form of academic enrichment.\n\nCloser to home, although the school site is currently closed to the majority of staff and pupils, we continue to work on the feedback received from the Hammersmith Bridge survey. Those parents who expressed an interest in flexi-boarding once we return to the school site have been contacted and we will continue to update you on other proposals over the coming weeks.\n\nIt only remains for me to wish you and your family good health in these difficult times and to thank you for your continued support.\n\nSAH\n\nThursday 10 December 2020\n\nAt the time of writing, I am looking forward to this evening’s Music Concert, listening to the Sixth Form’s radio comedy, Jack Sheppard, and experiencing a socially distanced version of The House of Bernarda Alba at the end of this term. It is my sincere belief that the experience of Covid-19 and the inability to access creative experience"
