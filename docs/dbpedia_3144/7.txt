The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which represents some of the top public schools in the country, has taken a step into the 21st century. Today, it announced that it will now admit new members from girls-only schools.

The organisation is also discussing further changes. Options include "wider unity", and possibly a merger, with the Girls' Schools Association (GSA), or other private school associations.

The HMC started out as the Headmasters' Conference in 1869, representing male headteachers from boys-only schools. In the 1970s, as private schools increasingly began to go co-educational, the conference allowed them to remain members. But it was not until 1996 that HMC changed its membership criteria to admit women into membership. It also changed its name to include female headteachers, but not its initials and it continues to be known as HMC. It has 243 heads in membership, nine of whom are women.

HMC members include the heads of some of the most well known public schools, including Eton, Harrow, Westminster, St Paul's and Manchester grammar school.

The HMC chairman, Priscilla Chadwick, said: "I am pleased that HMC colleagues have given a very clear mandate to remove anachronistic criteria related to gender.

"HMC looks forward to working closely with other ISC [Independent Schools Council] associations to continue to strengthen the voice of the independent sector, the first choice of many of today's parents for their children's education."

The HMC, along with four other private school associations, are represented by the ISC, which speaks on their behalf.
