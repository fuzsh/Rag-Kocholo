All warring parties have committed countless violations of international humanitarian law and human rights that have resulted in widespread civilian harm, and despite a six-month truce in 2022, these violations have continued. The coalition has conducted unlawfully indiscriminate and disproportionate airstrikes against civilians and civilian structures. Houthi forces have used banned landmines and fired artillery indiscriminately into populated areas. Parties have attacked and mined food and water infrastructure, as well as medical facilities, and have blocked access to humanitarian aid, leaving over 70 percent of the population in need of humanitarian assistance.",

        "text": "Text on Screen:\n\nWARNING\n\nThis video contains violent images and descriptions including people being shot at, and dead bodies. Viewer discretion advised.\n\nActor’s Voices have been used to protect the identity of the people Human Rights Watch interviewed for the film.\n\nAudio recording, Actors’ Voice:\n\nEven when I remember, I cry. I saw a guy calling for help, he lost both his legs. He was screaming and saying, “are you leaving me here? Please don’t leave me.” We couldn’t help him because we were running for our lives.\n\nVoiceover:\n\nEthiopian migrants and asylum seekers have been tortured, injured or killed by Saudi Arabian border guards at the Yemen-Saudi border. At least hundreds have been killed trying to make this crossing between March 2022 and June 2023.\n\nAudio recording, Actors’ Voice:\n\nWhen Saudi border guards see a group, they fire continuously, when they kill everyone, they go down to collect all those who didn't die. This is what happened to me. I survived, and they came to meet me and showed me the dead. Then they took us to a detention center and beat us all there.\n\nVoiceover:\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s extensive investigation includes firsthand accounts from 42 people, and the verification and geolocation of over a hundred videos and photos and the analysis of hundreds of square kilometers of satellite imagery. We found evidence that Saudi border guards have used explosive weapons and shot people at close range. In what appears to be a policy targeting migrants and asylum seekers, including women and children, at the border. Human Rights Watch believes this may amount to crimes against humanity. Saudi Arabia’s border forces should stop intentionally using lethal force, to kill Ethiopian migrants and asylum seekers with explosive weapons.\n\nAudio recording, Actors’ Voice:\n\nIt was during the night. We were traveling towards the Saudi border. Then we saw Saudi border guards. They told us to stop. While they walked towards us, they opened fire and fired bullets at us. One bullet hit a rock and hit my leg. My leg is broken around my knee.\n\nVoiceover:\n\nWhile many migrate for economic reasons, including drought, a number of Ethiopians have fled because of serious human rights abuses by their government, including during the recent, brutal armed conflict in northern Ethiopia.\n\nAudio recording, Actors’ Voice:\n\nWhen the firing stopped the Saudi border guards took us. In my group there were seven people, five men and two girls. The border guards made us remove our clothes and told us to rape the girls. The girls were 15 years old. One of the men refused. The border guards killed him on the spot. I participated in the rape, yes. To survive I did it. The girls survived because they didn’t refuse. This happened at the same spot where the killings took place.\n\nVoiceover:\n\nThis dangerous migration route, often referred to as the 'Eastern route', spans from the horn of Africa, across the Gulf of Aden,\n\nthrough Yemen and into Saudi Arabia. Migrants and asylum seekers\n\ncrossing into Saudi Arabia usually do so in the mountainous border area, aided by a network of smugglers and traffickers and facilitated by the Houthi forces\n\nwho control northern Yemen.\n\nAudio recording, Actors’ Voice:\n\nWe walked in the mountains for about five days. We walked in groups, minimum 300 people, and most of the group was female. Then there was firing from the border guards, and they were firing big rocket launchers at us. It was like a bomb. Of the 300 people, 150 died.\n\nVoiceover:\n\nSmugglers operating in Yemen take people to two informal camps before attempting to cross the border. Al Thabit camp is located northwest of the border, and Al Raqw camp has only a river separating it from Saudi Arabia. Both camps act as holding areas with thousands of people preparing to cross the border. Many interviewees said Houthi forces controlled the entry and exit into the camps and would often extort bribes from the\n\nmigrants or transfer them to detention centers. Migrants and asylum seekers often saw Saudi border guards patrolling the crossing points in large vehicles with what witnesses described as large objects mounted on the back of their vehicles, believed to be weapons. Human Rights Watch interviewed survivors who say they lost one or more limbs due to the use of explosive weapons or shootings at the border.\n\nAudio recording, Actors’ Voice:\n\nThe Saudi border guards were firing big things like mortars at us. They fired from the back of a truck. We lost 130 people that day, the majority were women and children.\n\nVoiceover:\n\nAlthough the number of deaths has not been confirmed, Human Rights Watch has identified at least eight burial sites near Al Raqw camp and has counted at least 287 graves on satellite images as of June 2023. Many have described bodies being buried in remote areas or left unburied along the route. They describe a pattern of large scale violence and cross-border killings. This video was sent to and verified by Human Rights Watch. The video shows the bodies of at least two migrants hidden under bushes just north of the trail from Al Thabit camp in Saudi Arabia. A likely Saudi border guard post is visible approximately 1.3 kilometers away from where the bodies were found.\n\nVoiceover:\n\nHumanitarian assistance and safe passage should be provided to migrants and asylum seekers trying to cross the border from Yemen to Saudi Arabia, and those responsible for what may amount to crimes against humanity should be held accountable.\n\nGerry Simspon, Human Rights Watch\n\nWarring parties in Yemen have ravaged the country since March 2015, and contributed to what the UN calls “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nAlmost 25 million people need some form of aid, including millions of malnourished children. The country’s healthcare system has almost collapsed and has struggled to cope with cholera and other disease outbreaks.\n\nCovid-19 has spread unchecked due to the stigma of being infected with the virus and a shortage of medical supplies, healthcare centers and health workers. This has made an already dire situation even worse.\n\nNathan Al-Hussami, Hospital Director\n\nThe pandemic has devastated powerful nations, let alone a country like Yemen, whose hospitals are decimated.\n\nGerry Simspon, Human Rights Watch\n\nSince the Houthis took control of northern and central Yemen in late 2014, humanitarian agencies have worked hard to get aid to millions of Yemenis, but the armed group has severely restricted their work.\n\nThey have delayed or blocked aid projects, heavily interfered with projects they do approve, diverted aid, and attacked aid staff and their property. Yemeni government authorities who control the south are also increasingly interfering with aid agencies’ work.\n\nAid obstruction has denied millions of Yemenis access to food, water, healthcare, sanitation, and other life-saving services.\n\nThe obstruction has also affected aid agencies’ ability to do everything they can to prevent the spread of Covid-19, such as by blocking primary healthcare projects and access to the country’s under-serviced hospitals and clinics.\n\nKhadija Ali, hospital worker\n\nWe struggled a lot due to a lack of medicine and medical supplies such as equipment and comprehensive health facilities.\n\nFeryan Ahmed, Technical Director\n\nWe suffer from a lack of Personal Protective Equipment for all the medical staff in the isolation center, and for patients.\n\nGerry Simspon, Human Rights Watch\n\nIn June 2020, international donors slashed their funding for aid agencies in Yemen, in part because of the Houthis’ long-standing and increasing aid obstruction.\n\nThe lack of money has forced aid agencies to cut many of their life-saving services.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis has also attacked medical facilities and imposed measures blocking and then restricting the country’s access to essential goods. However to end the current aid crisis, the Houthis and the Yemeni government should immediately end their aid obstruction and allow aid agencies to work without interference to help millions of people in need."
