        "text": "Geography\n\nYemen is a country in the south of the Arabian Peninsula on the Gulf of Aden. The land has a total area of 527,970 km² (203,850 mi²) and a total coastline of 1,906 km (1,184.3 mi). This land area is approximately 76% of the area of Texas. Yemen is thus one of the largest countries in Asia and the 50th biggest in the world. Most of the population (61%) resides within rural regions.\n\nYemen is comparatively high at an average elevation of 999 meters above sea level. The highest mountain peak (Dschabal an-Nabi Schuʿaib) is at 3,665 meters. The country has about 220 islands. There are direct national borders with the two neighboring countries Oman and Saudi Arabia. The distance between New York City and the Capital Sanaa is about 11,120 km (6,910 mi)."
