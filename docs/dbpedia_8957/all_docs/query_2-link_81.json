        "text": "When to File for TPS\n\nIf you currently have TPS under Yemen’s designation and would like to keep your TPS, you must re-register during the 60-day re-registration period that runs from July 10, 2024, through Sept. 9, 2024. We encourage you to re-register as soon as possible within the 60-day re-registration period.\n\nIf you are filing an initial application for TPS under Yemen’s re-designation that is effective Sept. 4, 2024, you must register during the registration period that runs from July 10, 2024, through March 3, 2026. We encourage you to register as soon as possible within the registration period.\n\nGo to the TPS page for information about registering.\n\nWhere to File\n\nIf you are applying for TPS Yemen, you may file Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status, online. When filing an initial TPS application or re-registering for TPS, you can also request an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) by submitting a completed Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, online with your Form I-821.\n\nFile Online\n\nYou may request a waiver of the fees for Form I-821, Form I-765, or both by filing Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver. However, if you request a fee waiver, you must file a paper application by mail.\n\nIf you are re-registering or filing your initial TPS application on paper by mail, or if you are filing for a replacement EAD for TPS you were already granted, send your TPS package to the appropriate address in the table below.\n\nIf you send your paper application via:Then, mail your application to:U.S. Postal Service:USCIS\n\nAttn: TPS Yemen\n\nP.O. Box 6943\n\nChicago, IL 60680-6943FedEx, UPS, or DHL:USCIS\n\nAttn: TPS Yemen (Box 6943)\n\n131 S. Dearborn St., 3rd Floor\n\nChicago, IL 60603-5517\n\nAutomatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension\n\nWe have automatically extended through Sept. 3, 2025, the validity of EADs issued under the TPS designation for Yemen with an original expiration date of Sept. 3, 2024, or March 3, 2023. If your EAD is covered by this automatic extension, you may continue to use your existing EAD through Sept. 3, 2025, as evidence that you are authorized to work.\n\nTo prove that you are authorized to continue working legally, you may show your employer:\n\nYour TPS-related EAD with a Sept. 3, 2024, or March 3, 2023, expiration date; and\n\nA copy of theFederal Register notice announcing the automatic extension.\n\nGovernment agencies may also accept these documents if they need to verify your immigration status.\n\nYour employer may rely on the Federal Register notice as evidence of the continuing validity of your EAD. Visit the USCIS webpage Documentation Employers May Accept and Temporary Protected Status Beneficiaries May Present as Evidence of Employment Eligibility for more information.\n\nIf we approve your TPS re-registration application and you applied for an EAD and paid the fee (or we approved your fee-waiver request), we will issue you an EAD that expires March 3, 2026.\n\nFor more information on TPS eligibility requirements, what to file, and step-by-step instructions, go to the TPS page. You can find the filing fees for TPS-related forms on our Fee Schedule page.\n\nOther Immigration Options\n\nYou might be eligible for other immigration options listed on the Explore My Options page.\n\nTo apply for a lawful permanent status (Green Card), you must be eligible under one of the categories listed on the Green Card Eligibility Categories page. Once you find the category that may fit your situation, click on the link provided to get information on eligibility requirements, how to apply, and whether your family members can also apply with you.\n\nNote on Seeking Asylum: Being granted and maintaining TPS until a reasonable period before the filing of the asylum application is considered an extraordinary circumstance for the purposes of the one-year filing deadline. In other words, having TPS status “stops the clock” on the requirement to file for asylum within one year of arriving in the United States, if the one-year clock has not already expired. See 8 CFR 208.4(a)(5)(iv).\n\nAvoid Scams\n\nPlease be aware that some unauthorized practitioners may try to take advantage of you by claiming they can file TPS forms. These same individuals may ask that you pay them to obtain such forms; however, all USCIS forms are free for download from the USCIS website at uscis.gov/forms. We want to ensure that all potential TPS applicants know how to obtain legitimate, accurate legal advice and assistance. A link to a list of accredited representatives and free or low-cost legal providers is available on the USCIS website on the Find Legal Services webpage.\n\nWe do not want you to become a victim of an immigration scam. If you need legal advice on immigration matters, make sure the person helping you is authorized to give legal advice. Only an attorney or an accredited representative working for a Department of Justice (DOJ) recognized organization can give you legal advice. Visit the Avoid Scams page for information and resources.\n\nRelated Links"
