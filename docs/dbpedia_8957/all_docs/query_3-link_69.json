        "text": "Introduction / History\n\nThe northern tribes of Yemen may be referred to as the Sanaani Arabs. They reside in the northern mountains and north-eastern deserts, as well as around the capital city of Sana'a.\n\nWhat Are Their Lives Like?\n\nThe growing of the narcotic qat has become the mainstay of rural Yemen, and nearly half of the national economy is involved in qat.\n\nWhat Are Their Beliefs?\n\nIslam is the main religion. Muslims know Jesus (Isa) is the Messiah (al Masih) sent by God, embodying his Word, but view Christianity as a campaign to destroy their families, communities and way of life. They need a personal encounter with the Risen Lord who has conquered death.\n\nWhat Are Their Needs?\n\nThe Northern Yemeni Arab people need to put their trust and identity in the hands of the loving God of Creation who sent his son to make it possible for them to enter the Kingdom of God.\n\nPrayer Points\n\nPray for the few believers among the Sanaani Arabs, that they would become effective and fruitful in sowing God's Word among their families and communities to fuel a movement of God's blessing spreading from household to household.\n\nPray for a movement to Jesus to multiply among the families and communities of the northern tribes of Yemen, that Yemeni families would increasingly experience the righteousness and forgiveness found only in Jesus Christ.\n\nScripture Prayers for the Arab, Northern Yemeni in Yemen.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Yemen"
