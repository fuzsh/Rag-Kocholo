        "text": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has extended and redesignated Yemen for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, from September 4, 2024 through March 3, 2026, according to a notice scheduled for publication in the Federal Register. Current Yemeni TPS beneficiaries will have 60 days, from July 10, 2024 through September 9, 2024, to request an 18-month extension of status and work authorization. New applicants will have from July 10, 2024 through March 3, 2026 to apply for initial TPS status and related employment authorization documents (EADs) and travel permission.\n\nDHS has determined that conditions in Yemen warrant continued and renewed Temporary Protected Status (TPS), due to the ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevent Yemeni nationals from safely returning to their country.\n\nRelatedly, DHS is also extending the relaxation of certain employment authorization rules for Yemeni nationals in F-1 status who are experiencing severe economic hardship due to the continuing crisis in Yemen.\n\nNewly eligible Yemeni nationals can apply for initial TPS status if they can demonstrate continuous residence in the United States since July 2, 2024, and continuous physical presence in the United States since September 4, 2024. Applicants must file a Form I-821 application with appropriate fee(s) (or request for fee waiver) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) during the initial registration period, which runs from July 10, 2024 through March 3, 2026. Applicants may also apply for EADs and travel authorization during this time, by submitting the corresponding forms and fee(s) or fee waiver request. TPS and its related work authorization will be approved with a March 3, 2026 expiration date.\n\nAll individuals applying for TPS undergo security and background checks as part of determining eligibility. Biometrics collection (fingerprinting) is generally required for applicants ages 14 and older.\n\nSeparately, DHS is renewing its relaxation of certain employment authorization rules for Yemeni students in F-1 status who are experiencing severe economic hardship as a result of the crisis in Yemen. The relaxed employment authorization rules for such students, which were set to expire on September 3, 2024, have been extended through March 3, 2026.\n\nUnder the relaxed rules, qualifying Yemeni F-1 students may request employment authorization, work an increased number of hours while school is in session, and reduce their course load, while continuing to maintain their F-1 nonimmigrant student status. DHS will deem students who obtain employment authorization under this policy to be engaged in a “full course of study” if the student maintains the minimum course load requirements described in the Federal Register notice extending the policy.\n\nTo qualify, F-1 students must establish that they:\n\nAre citizens of Yemen (or individuals having no nationality who last habitually resided in Yemen);\n\nWere lawfully present in the United States in F-1 status on July 10, 2024;\n\nAre enrolled in an academic institution that is Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified;\n\nAre currently maintaining F-1 status; and\n\nAre experiencing severe economic hardship as a direct result of the current crisis in Yemen.\n\nF-1 students who receive authorization from their Designated School Official (DSO) to work off campus may apply for an EAD by submitting the required application form and corresponding fee (or fee waiver request). F-1 students employed on campus do not need to apply for an EAD but do require DSO authorization.\n\nThe extension and redesignation of TPS for Yemen means that beneficiaries who submit a timely application and receive an approval may continue to work and remain in the United States through March 3, 2026. Prior to the conclusion of the 18-month extension, DHS will review conditions to determine whether the TPS designation for Yemen should be extended again or terminated.\n\nYemeni nationals in F-1 status should contact their school’s DSO to determine whether they can avail themselves of the relaxed employment authorization standards."
