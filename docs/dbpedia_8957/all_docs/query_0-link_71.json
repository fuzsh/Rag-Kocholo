        "text": "Overview\n\nSecurity Status\n\nDo Not Travel\n\nGeneral Travel Advice\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Yemen at this time due to the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict, and landmines.\n\nIrish citizens require a visa to enter Yemen.\n\nA valid passport is required for travel to Yemen. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.\n\nFor more information on visa and passport requirements, please contact the Yemeni Embassy in London.\n\nVisitors to Yemen are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.\n\nCitizens can also follow the Irish Embassy in Riyadh on Twitter @IrishEmbRiyadh to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.\n\nEmergency Assistance\n\nThe best help is often close at hand so if you have problems, try talking to your local contacts, local authorities or hotel management.\n\nOur tips for Safe Travels:\n\nGet comprehensive travel insurance that covers all your planned activities.\n\nRegister your details with us so that we can contact you quickly if there’s an unforeseen crisis like a natural disaster or a family emergency.\n\nFollow us on twitter @dfatravelwise for the latest travel updates.\n\nRead our ‘Know Before You Go’ guide.\n\nAs there is no Irish Embassy in Yemen, we are limited in the help we can offer you in an emergency. However, if you need assistance, you can contact the Irish Embassy in Riyadh.\n\nSafety and security\n\nViolent unrest\n\nThe political situation in Yemen is extremely unstable and continues to deteriorate. Violent clashes are being witnessed. If you are in Yemen, we advise you to leave immediately. Always keep yourself informed of what’s going on around you by monitoring local media and staying in contact with your hotel or tour organiser.\n\nTerrorism\n\nThe threat from terrorism in Yemen is high, and there is an extreme risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks.\n\nKidnapping\n\nForeign nationals are potential targets for kidnapping so you should take particular care when travelling in Yemen:\n\nGet advice from your local contacts about staying safe\n\nAvoid travelling at night, particularly inter-city\n\nAvoid travelling alone\n\nWhen driving, ensure all car doors are locked\n\nVary your routes and departure times – avoid patterns which could be tracked\n\nPay careful attention to local media for reports of kidnapping activities\n\nDriving\n\nIf you’re planning to drive in Yemen, you should be extremely careful. Road safety standards are low, particularly outside towns and cities. Accidents are frequent and are often caused by poor driving, badly maintained vehicles and inadequate lighting.\n\nIf you want to drive:\n\nCheck with the authorities to find out what documentation you need\n\nBring your international driving license and make sure you have adequate and appropriate insurance\n\nDriving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught\n\nKeep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching if you’re stopped at traffic lights\n\nIf you’re hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.\n\nCheck that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).\n\nLocal laws and customs\n\nRemember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.\n\nMuslim culture\n\nYemen is an Islamic country and you should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Dress conservatively, be aware of your actions and take care not to offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or other religious festivals, or if you intend to visit religious areas. You should not consume alcohol in public.\n\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims are not permitted to eat, drink or smoke during daylight hours. To avoid offence, you should not eat, drink or smoke in public during this time.\n\nLGBT\n\nHomosexual activity is illegal in Yemen.\n\nIllegal drugs\n\nIllegal drug use (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms."
