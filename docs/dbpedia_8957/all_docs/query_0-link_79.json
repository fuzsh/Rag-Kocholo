        "text": "Described by the UN as the “world’s worst” humanitarian crisis, the on-going conflict in Yemen has left an estimated 80% of the country’s men, women and children in desperate need of assistance; but how has this man-made crisis affected the people of Yemen?\n\nAt the forefront of a major season of programming at IWM North, Yemen: Inside a Crisis is the UK’s first exhibition to address Yemen’s on-going conflict and humanitarian crisis. Showcasing around 50 objects and photographs, many of which have been exclusively sourced from Yemen for this exhibition.\n\nYemen: Inside a Crisis is part of IWM’s Conflict Now strand of programming, which features opinions of individuals who have seen, experienced and worked in areas of conflict. This exhibition has been curated with the support of Lead Advisor Iona Craig, an award-winning journalist who between 2010 and 2015 was based in Sanaa as Yemen correspondent for The Times.\n\nThere is no age restriction for Yemen: Inside a Crisis, however, all visitors are advised that the exhibition includes content showing the impact and consequences of war.\n\nDrawing on the exhibition’s themes, the marketing campaign questions the ‘price of war’? In many areas of Yemen, food has been used as a weapon. The indicative costs featured in the campaign represent the unaffordability of food in Yemen. The costs have been calculated by comparing food prices in the UK and Yemen, and Gross National Income (GNI) of the two countries."
