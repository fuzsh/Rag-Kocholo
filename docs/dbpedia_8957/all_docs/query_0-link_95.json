        "text": "At just 4 months old, Noor* was fighting to survive. Struggling from severe acute malnutrition, she found it difficult to move. Her worried mum, Safiya* took her to Save the Children supported hospital where Noor was given the treatment and nutritious food she needed to recover.\n\nNow 6 months later, Noor* has gained weight and loves to play and sing. Her mum especially loves it when she sings to her.\n\n*Names changed\n\nConflict has changed Tareq’s life, but he is determined to keep learning.\n\n\"I wish to go back to school after a year of absence,\" says Tareq.\n\nTareq is a 12year-old boy, living in the Hodeida governorate in Yemen. When his family home was hit by a missile, he was badly injured by the shrapnel. \"The sound (of the missile) was getting closer and closer until it reached my bedroom. I was terrified at the time. Suddenly, I found myself unconscious and I couldn’t feel or touch my body anymore. I fell into a coma for a few days. Then I woke up to see that my hand was amputated and I was in extreme pain,\" says Tareq.\n\nTareq was referred to a Save the Children supported rehabilitation centre and was given lifesaving treatment and rehabilitation for his injury. Tareq has now recovered from his physical injuries but is still dealing with the psychological impacts and is often scared.\n\nDespite everything he has experienced, Tareq is determined to keep learning. “I love my school and hope to catch up with it this year, especially after a long absence due to the war and my injury.”\n\nYou were there for Tareq when it mattered most. But there is so much more to do. Thousands of children still need life-saving care, shelter and the chance to return to doing the things they love.\n\nSalem* is 13 years old, and lives in Taiz, Yemen. He dreams of being a doctor one day but, he, along with many other children in Taiz are facing challenges with their education. Many schools have been damaged in the long conflict and simply aren’t safe for children to go to.\n\n“I wasn’t doing well at school because there are no blackboards there and no activities. The playground was destroyed, the blackboards were all broken,” says Salem.\n\nWe are currently working with affected schools offering them vital school room supplies such as blackboards, desks, stationary and bags. With support from donors like you, we’ve been able to help get children like Salem back into school, where he can get back to studying.\n\n“Studying is important so we can build our future, so hopefully later on we become doctors. Because children are the future of the country,” says Salem.\n\n\"When I prepare the breakfast, I pray that we will be able to have lunch, and when lunch comes I wonder what to have for supper. And when you go to sleep you start thinking about what you are going to feed them tomorrow or where you are going to get it from,\" says Suad*\n\nIn August 2018, 11-month-old Nusair* was treated for malnutrition in a Save the Children supported clinic. After his treatment, his family were forced to move to a much more remote area as conflict in their neighbourhood escalated and they were no longer safe. When Nusair started to get poorly again, his mother Suad couldn’t afford the trip to the hospital and was struggling to buy him nutritious food to nurse him back to health.\n\nThankfully, after a follow-up visit our team referred Nusair back to the hospital, covering the costs of transport and providing nutrition-rich food to help Suad take care of her family.\n\nLike any mum, Suad will always worry for her children. But for now, aged three, Nausair is a healthy and happy little boy. “He is now gaining more weight and his health is good. He doesn’t suffer from any disease. He is walking normally, interacts and responds with everyone in the family. After having lunch, he loves to play with his friends. He likes to go out with his father everywhere and he loves to ride his bicycle,” says Suad.\n\nWhile conflict continues, thousands of mothers like Suad are experiencing the heartbreak of seeing their children suffer. You can help ease the burden and help more children like Nausair have the chance to play freely and without hunger."
