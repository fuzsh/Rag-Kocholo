        "text": "Yemen has been embroiled in protracted violence since 2014, ignited by failed negotiations between Ansar Allah and the Internationally Recognized Government, which triggered conflict and set the stage for one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in over 377,000 deaths, with nearly 60 percent of fatalities attributed to indirect causes such as food insecurity and lack of access to health services. Violations of international humanitarian law, including targeted and indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, have been committed by all parties involved.\n\nA decade of conflict has devastated the country’s economy, leading to soaring inflation and widespread poverty. Many Yemenis struggle to afford basic necessities, including food. The economic downturn has caused high levels of unemployment and poverty, with hundreds of businesses disrupted or destroyed, depriving many of livelihood opportunities.\n\nHumanitarian needs in Yemen have reached critical levels due to the breakdown of basic services, prolonged displacement and the collapse of the country’s economy. Climate shocks, such as droughts and floods, are significant factors driving displacement and exacerbating these needs. Over two-thirds of the population—21.6 million people—are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nYemen’s healthcare system is on the brink of collapse, with over half of all health facilities either closed or operating at reduced capacity. Many hospitals have sustained damage during the decade-long conflict, and a widespread shortage of essential medicines and qualified personnel has severely limited civilians' access to medical care.\n\nLevels of malnutrition and food insecurity in Yemen are among the highest globally. Approximately 1.3 million pregnant or breastfeeding women and 2.2 million children under the age of five require treatment for acute malnutrition. Preventable diseases such as cholera and pneumonia have contributed to a rise in child mortality rates.\n\nThe conflict has exacerbated protection risks, including harmful labor, violence, exploitation and abuse for all Yemenis. However, women, children and people with disabilities face the greatest risks. Existing child protection systems are inadequate in addressing the specific needs of vulnerable children, including those separated from their families. An estimated 17.7 million people in Yemen are in need of protection services.\n\nWhile the IRC and the wider humanitarian community continue to deliver assistance to those in need, insufficient funding and access challenges continue to hamper the response in Yemen.\n\nFind out more in the IRC's 2024 Emergency Watchlist."
