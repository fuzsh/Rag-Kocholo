        "text": "Financial Reporting Framework in Yemen\n\nYemen does not have a stock exchange, and there are no domestic accounting standards or accounting regulation. The Yemeni Association of Certified Public Accountants (YACPA) is the recognised association representing the accounting profession. The YACPA is working with the relevant governmental institutions and private sector entities to formalise the adoption of IFRS in Yemen.\n\nSo far, the following has been achieved (all links provided are external links to official Yemeni websites):\n\nOrder No. 2952 dated 28 July 2013 issued by the President of the Republic of Yemen directs the Prime Minister to pursue adoption of IFRS in Yemen by stating: \"You are requested to instruct the quick application of International Accounting Standards (IASs) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)â€¦ for all companies of the public, mixed, and private sectors.\" (The full text of the order is not yet available in the public domain.)\n\nThe Central Bank of Yemen has issued a circular requiring all banking institutions to use IFRS in their published financial statements.\n\nArticle 107 of the Tax By-Laws requires all companies classified as large and medium-sized to prepare financial statements using IFRS (companies whose revenue exceeds YR 200,000,000)."
