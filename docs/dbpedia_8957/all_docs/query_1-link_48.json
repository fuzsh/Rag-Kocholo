        "text": "AL-MUKALLA: Yemen’s internationally recognized Presidential Leadership Council asked the world on Sunday to follow the US lead in labeling the Iran-backed Houthis as terrorists and impose stiffer penalties on the militia for jeopardizing international marine trade and perpetrating crimes in Yemen.\n\nAt a meeting in Riyadh, the council praised Washington’s decision to designate the Houthis as international terrorists, encouraged the rest of the world to follow suit, and praised the international community’s joint response to the Houthi Red Sea raids.\n\nThe council said in a statement it “welcomed the decision to designate the Houthi militias as a global terrorist organization and looks forward to additional sanctions against the rogue militias.”\n\nIt reiterated a request to the international community to strengthen the military capabilities of Yemen’s coast guard and offer protection from the Houthis and other terrorist groups, according to the statement carried by the official news agency.\n\nThe council warned that Houthi attacks in the Red Sea would result in the militarization of the crucial maritime route, raising shipping and insurance prices, and impeding the flow of critical supplies to the nation.\n\nYemen’s Information Minister, Muammar Al-Eryani, said that since the beginning of the Houthi military takeover, the government has pushed for the militia to be labeled as terrorists, both internally and globally, because of its human rights violations, as well as actions that undermine regional and international security.\n\nThe minister reiterated his plea to the world to declare the Houthis terrorists.\n\n“We urge international allies and nations throughout the globe to follow the US government’s lead and engage in a concerted response to combat the operations of the Houthi militia.\n\n“We also urge them to put further pressure on it to quit its terrorist tactics and conform to peace obligations in line with local, regional, and international standards,” Al-Eryani said on X.\n\nThe country’s National Defense Council, chaired by Rashad Al-Alimi, designated the Houthis as a terrorist group in October 2022, shortly after the militia launched missile and drone attacks on oil terminals in the southern provinces of Hadramout and Shabwa, bringing the country’s oil exports to a halt.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Houthis have targeted commercial and naval ships in the Red Sea with drones and ballistic missiles. The group also seized a commercial vessel in November.\n\nThe Houthis claim they want Israel to stop bombing Gaza and relieve the blockade on the enclave.\n\nTo pressure the Houthis to end their attacks, the US and UK have launched dozens of strikes against military targets in militia-controlled areas of Yemen.\n\nOn Saturday, the US Central Command said that US forces destroyed a Houthi anti-ship missile before it was launched in the Gulf of Aden.\n\nHumanitarian groups have long resisted the labeling of Houthi terrorists, fearing it would disrupt the flow of aid through militia-controlled ports, which receive over 70 percent of essential supplies.\n\nHowever, Yemeni activists who support the designation view it as just another way to punish the Houthis for human rights violations, as well as a means of pressuring the group to accept peace talks to end the war.\n\n“Reclassifying the Houthi group as a terrorist organization is a triumph for the principles of responsibility, fairness, and justice as well as for the blood of innocent victims,” Yemeni human rights activist Riyadh Al-Dubae said on X.\n\nAMMAN: The United Nations warned Monday of a “deepening crisis” of malnutrition in the Middle East and North Africa affecting a third of children.\n\n“At least 77 million — or 1 in 3 — children in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) have some form of malnutrition,” the UN children’s agency UNICEF said in a statement.\n\nIt said 55 million children across the 20 countries assessed are overweight or obese, which UNICEF considers a type of malnutrition.\n\nA further 24 million children suffer from undernutrition, including stunting, wasting and thinness, it said.\n\n“The deepening crisis of malnutrition in the region is being driven by what and how children are fed, poor access to nutritious foods, clean water, medical care and other essential services, and the proliferation of cheap, unhealthy poor foods high in salt, sugar and fat,” it added.\n\nThis takes place amid “ongoing conflicts, political instability, climatic shocks, and rising food prices that together, deny children their right to nutritious food and limit humanitarian access to vulnerable communities.”\n\nOnly a third of young children are being provided with nutritious foods, said UNICEF regional director Adele Khodr.\n\n“This is a shocking statistic in 2024 and risks becoming even worse as conflicts, crises and other challenges in our region persist,” she said.\n\nUNICEF urged governments to focus on nutrition in their planning and policy.\n\nUN agencies said last month that conflict, economic turmoil and climate change had hampered efforts last year to reduce hunger, affecting about nine percent of the world’s population.\n\nIn a report, they estimated that about 733 million people experienced hunger in 2023, a figure that has remained largely the same for three years after a sharp rise following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nModerate and severe food insecurity, which forces people to sometimes skip meals, affected 2.33 billion people last year — about 29 percent of the world’s population, they said.\n\nTEL AVIV: The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility on Monday for a bomb blast near a synagogue in Tel Aviv that Israeli police and the Shin Bet intelligence agency described as a terrorist attack.\n\nA man who was carrying the bomb was killed and a passerby was injured in the incident late on Sunday, according to police at the scene.\n\nIn their statement the Brigades added that their “martyrdom operations” inside Israel would return to the forefront as long as the “occupation’s massacres and assassination policy continue” — an allusion to Israel’s offensive in Gaza and the July 31 killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nIsrael has neither claimed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh’s death in the Iranian capital.\n\nThe war in Gaza began on Oct. 7 last year when Hamas gunmen stormed across the border into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael’s military campaign has since levelled wide swathes of the Gaza Strip and killed at least 40,000 people, according to the enclave’s health authorities.\n\nSunday’s explosion in Tel Aviv came about an hour after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv to push for a ceasefire in Gaza to end the 10-month-old war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThere has been increased urgency to reach a ceasefire deal amid fears of an escalation across the wider region. Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel after the assassination of Haniyeh.\n\nDUBAI: The Iran-backed Houthi militia has recruited as many as 10,000 children since the start of the conflict in Yemen in 2014, say human rights groups.\n\nAccording to the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor and SAM Organization for Rights and Freedoms, a civil rights organization in Yemen, the recruitment took place between 2014 and 2021.\n\nA report by Human Rights Watch said the majority of recruits were between 13 and 25 years old, including hundreds — possibly thousands — below the age of 18.\n\nMedia releases from the Houthis’ official news outlet, SabaNet, about the militias’ recent recruitment show people who appear to be children. The UN has investigated at least 1,851 individual cases of child recruitment or use by the Houthis since 2010, the report added.\n\nSince 2011, the Houthis have featured on the UN secretary-general’s annual list of groups responsible for grave violations against children in armed conflicts.\n\nInitially listed for their recruitment and use of child soldiers, since 2016 it has also been included for killing and maiming children and for attacks against schools and hospitals."
