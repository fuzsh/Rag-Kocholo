Despite some returns of internally displaced persons (IDPs), challenges in humanitarian access persist. The protection environment for refugees remains restrictive, compounded by negative reactions to mixed population movements from the Horn of Africa.\n\nUNHCR's strategic priorities in Yemen include improving protection conditions and access to basic rights for forcibly displaced individuals, enhancing living conditions for vulnerable populations through expanded services and support for self-reliance, and supporting durable solutions through resettlement, safe return, and provision of essential services. However, humanitarian access restrictions, bureaucratic hurdles, and limited funding continue to impede UNHCR's comprehensive service delivery."
