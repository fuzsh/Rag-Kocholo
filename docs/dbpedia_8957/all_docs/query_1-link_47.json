        "text": "This conflict has become particularly violent following March 2015 and the military intervention of a coalition of Arab countries in the country. The war has since taken root, becoming one of the worst crises on the world with at least 100,000 people who have been killed; leaving Yemen on its knees and heavily contaminated by improvised explosive devices and mines.\n\nEssential infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed by the violence of the fighting and bombing raids; and more than half of the country's health facilities (hospitals or health centres) are not operational anymore.\n\nThe main victims of this generalised violence are the civilian populations: over 20 million people require humanitarian aid. Among them, 16 million Yemenis are food unsecured; and over 4 million are displaced due to the violence. Humanitarian organisations continue to experience very severe difficulties working in the country.\n\nNumber of HI staff members: 127\n\nDate the programme opened: 2014"
