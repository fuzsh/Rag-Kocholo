Yemen

musics

Here we will shed light on traditional urban lyrical songs, rural folk songs and dances that are widespread in Yemen.

Yemeni singing, which is memorized and circulated orally, has not received sufficient academic study to adequately identify and label the different attributes of local musical trends.

By singing we mean the chanting of the human voice accompanied by musical instruments.
