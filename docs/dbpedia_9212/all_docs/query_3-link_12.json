        "text": "Information[]\n\nHungary (officially known as the Kingdom Of Hungary) is a country located in Central Europe bordering Romania, Austria, and Serbia. The nation's capital is Budapest and its main financial centre is Budapest as well.\n\nGeography[]\n\nHungarian territory covers 223.557 km2 (86 315.8403 sq mi) and elevation ranges from the mountains of the Carpathians in the north to the shores of the Adriatic See in the southwest and the Great Plain (Alföld) in the middle of it. Hungary traversed by such major rivers as the Danube, Tisza, Drava, Szava, Raba, Zala and the 3 Körös rivers.\n\nPolitics[]\n\nThe Hungarian government is divided intro three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.\n\nThe executive branch includes the Regent, who is responsible for representing the country on the global stage, overseeing the military as Commander-in-chief, and working with Parliament to implement laws. Directly beneath is the Prime Minister, who the Regent chooses. Regents are elected by the people of Hungary FOR LIFE. Which means that the Regent will stay in that position until he/she passes away or renounces his/her position. Plus the Regent also could have a cabinet with these positions: Agriculture; Health; Education; Culture; Transport and infrastructure; Finance; Internal affairs; Prime minister; Foreign affairs; Economy ;Investments; Research; Environment.\n\nThe legislative branch includes Parliament, which in turn is made up only one house: The House of Representatives, in which the Regent chooses the people. Every representative is elected for 4 years. Each town gets ONE representative. Members of the Parliament represent the interests of their state and town and constituents at the federal level. Every bill that had a 2/3 \"yes vote\" will be sent to the Regent, who can deny it (and sends it back) or approve it. Each year the Parliament comes together ONCE.\n\nThe judicial branch consists of the Supreme Court, who's role is to uphold the Constitution and resolve legal disputes that are brought to them. The Supreme Court is made out of 3 Supreme Justices who take on the cases with the highest relevancy.\n\nLine of succession and electing the Regent[]\n\nThe Regent as said before, is elected by the citizens of the Kingdom of Hungary. New Regent can only be elected if the Regent died or resigned. And only family members of the Regent can be elected (the \"list of successors\" has to be used for this). Each citizen votes for the candidates for the throne and the successor with the most votes becomes the monarch.\n\nList of successors:\n\nFirst: Regent's sons and daughters\n\nSecond: Regent's siblings\n\nThird: Regent's siblings' sons and daughter\n\nFourth: Regent's cousins\n\nFifth: Regent's cousins' sons and daughter\n\nThis list tells us that which people can run in the election for the throne. For example: if the Regent has sons and/or daughters, they are the ONLY ONES who can run for the power. But if there aren't, then ONLY the Regent's siblings can... etc.\n\nHistory[]\n\n1st of January, 1910 - Vienna and Budapest were created on the server. Both towns were created on the same day because they were the capitals of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at that time.\n\n11th of October, 1910 - Sadly, as still part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary had to give up the region of Transylvania (Crisana, Maramures, Banat and Transylvania) at the Convention of Transylvania. This was because Franz Joseph, the EMPEROR had problems with the Romanians of that regions. They sent an official ultimatum, in which they written that they wanted Transylvania to join the country of Romania. And because of fear and dread, the Emperor did what they asked for.\n\n25th of April, 1911 - After almost 385 years, Hungary declared full independence from any other power. It was a very peacful seperation from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Decleration of Independence was written and put out for the world to see. Not long after the Austrian-Hungarian Treaty was signed, which solidified the country's independence. In these documents the representatives wrote down how the Government will work, what's gonna be their anthem, flag and coat of arms and territorries they want and claim! The Regent became Miklós Horthy (Flc01), the Prime Minister Kevin Horthy (Keweeb), his brother and the top commanders of the Hussars became Ferenc Ferdinánd (Speaker500).\n\n31st of December, 1911 - Because of the \"Transylvania affair\" Miklós became more and more angry. And in the end, he wrote a Public Letter Of Demans to the Romanian Government, in which he demanded all of the taken territory by Romania. He gave them around 150 days to decide if they are going to war with Hungary or give back the \"stolen land\" immediately. Many people tried to talk Horthy out of it but he didn't listen!\n\nEnd of February, 1912 - The Romanians responded and declared war! The Hungarian-Romanian War broke out. And the Romanians had more man and better equipment than the Hungarians. But the Hungarians tried their best throughout the war.\n\n3rd of March, 1912 - The war ended. The Romanians were too powerful and the Hunarians got defeated by them! The soldiers took Miklós Horthy (Flc01) to Romania as a POW. Now the fate of the country and the people of Hungary hang in the hands of the leaders of Romania. They said that they're going to hold a convention in Budapest, on which they are going to talk about what's going to come next.\n\n27th of April, 1912- After many days of talking and negotiating between the two sides. The Convention of Budapest was held and ended in a relatively short time. After the trip to the capital, the Romanians printed their Treaty of Budapest. The treaty stated the last Regent will be publically executed, the country will be demilitarized for 7 years at least, Hungary has to pay 1250 dollars to Romania every year up to 1922 and that Hungary will give all of its weapons to Romania. Because Miklós was in Romania, Kevin Horthy (Keweeb) was the only one who had the chance to become the Regent. And in the end he achieved that goal. And peace can finally reach the Kingdom Of Hungary! His right hand man became Aladár Ősi (Snowessi)!\n\nEnd of January, 1913 - Ferenc Ferdiánd, Commander of the Hussars left the country. And also some people betrayed Kevin and stole 80 percent of the Hungarian tresury and went to an unknown location. This a was big blow for the Hungarian economy and government, especially Kevin Horthy.\n\nEnd of June, 1914 - Austria and Hungary sigend a deal, which stated that a railway is going to be built from Lviv to Budapest. This deal would help transportation and traveling between the two cities and many parts of the country. Later this deal was terminated.\n\n11st of Novermber, 1914 - Immigrants from Austria came to Hungary and established the town of Szabadka and Fiume. These people were:\n\n12th of October, 1915 - The Kingdom of Hungary after many years of farming, mining and deals got enough money to get out of Romanian Debt 7 years earlier. Which is a big accomplishment for any nation!\n\n22nd of April, 1916 - The Head of State, Kevin, payed off all the money the country owed to Romania because of the war and the Treaty of Budapest.\n\n28th of July, 1916 - The Hungarian Parliament, which will give home to the Head of State, the Holy Crown and the right hand man of the Head Of State was finished on this day. It's a magnificent building and architectural accomplishment of the Hungarian mind. Not long after this day, the first national assembly will be held in Budapest.\n\nAugust of 1916 - When Kevin Horthy was visiting the streets of Belgrade an anarchist group made out of Austrian and Serbian members killed his wife and his daughter. Only his son remained in his family. He has no siblings and parents anymore, because they are dead as well!\n\n10th of October, 1916 - The first national assembly in the independent Hungary's history took place in the Hungarian Parliament on this day. The regent and 3 representatives from the 3 cities of the country were present at the event. They voted in 4 issues, which are not yet public information.\n\nHead of State (1910-)[]\n\n1910. Jan. 1 - 1911. Apr. 24 - Franz Joseph, Emperor\n\n1911. Apr. 25 - 1912. Apr. 26 - Miklós Horthy (Flc01), Regent\n\n1912. Apr 27 - ... - Kevin Horthy (Keweeb), Regent"
