        "text": "Would I like to do my travels across Eastern Europe all over again? I am not so sure that I would. I find the thought exhausting. While there are some places I would love to see one more time, the idea of enduring more flight delays, layovers, and missed connections makes me want to pull the covers over my head and go back to bed. My distaste for doing it all over again extends beyond airplanes and airports. Bus rides are one of the most exhausting things I have ever done. I still love to travel, but I do not miss the pre-planning or changes in plans, working out trip logistics, jet lag, sleepless nights, dodging real and perceived dangers, Not to mention a litany of minor irritations. I endured such less-than-ideal experiences to pursue my Eastern European travel dreams.\n\nStaying power – Astoria Grand Hotel in Oradea (Nagyvarad)\n\nWell Manored – Palace of Transport\n\nThere is only one thing that makes me want to do it all over again. If I could do certain parts of my travels just a little bit differently, then I would be advantageous to repeating them. Specifically, I would love to visit a handful of cities that were once part of the Kingdom of Hungary but ended up on the wrong side of the border due to the post-World War I Treaty of Trianon. These cities were easy for me to overlook when I first began to visit Hungary. Mainly because I knew nothing about them. Guidebooks dedicated to the country did not offer coverage of them because they are now in other countries.\n\nI first became aware of the beautiful cities just beyond Hungary’s borders on a train journey to Transylvania. Not long after crossing over the border from Hungary into Romania the train pulled into Oradea. All I knew about the city was that its Hungarian name was Nagyvarad. This was a name I became familiar with due to a stop on Metro Line 3 on the Budapest metro. I knew nothing about this city that had gone by that name until 1920 and still does for the quarter of its population that are ethnic Hungarians. The train stopped in Oradea to pick up more passengers who would be traveling onward to Transylvania. What caught my eye was Oradea’s Railway Station. The tan colored, multi-story structure reminded me of a manor house. Rather than being surrounded by gardens and green space, this one had platforms with passengers waiting for trains. The station had a presence about it that impressed me. I thought there had to be much more in Oradea worth seeing. I pulled out my Rough Guide to Romania and discovered that Oradea had mansions and palaces from the Austro-Hungarian era among many other attractions. This appealed to me. I made a mental note to one day visit the city. I would return on a day trip two years later.\n\nReady for arrival – Platforms at Oradea (Nagyvarad) Railway Station\n\n(Credit: Attila Nagy-Meuleman)\n\nThe Lost Lands – Historic Hungary\n\nOradea turned out to be just the beginning in discovering several beautiful cities just beyond the borders of Hungary which had historically been part of it. I was already acutely aware how much Hungarians were pained by losing two-thirds of the Kingdom of Hungary’s territory. The region whose loss caused the greatest consternation was Transylvania. This continues to be an open wound that is likely to fester well into the future. The losses of Upper Hungary (Slovakia), Vojvodina (northern Serbia), the Banat (western Romania) and Burgenland *West Hungary) were also a blow to Hungarians. These regions are collectively termed “the lost lands” which were part of “Historic Hungary.”\n\nPrior to passing through Oradea, I had never heard Hungarians talk about what could be called the “lost cities.” These include Oradea (Nagyvarad), Timisoara (Temesvar), Subotica (Szabadka), Pozsony (Bratislava), Kosice (Kaschau), Eisenstadt (Kismarton), and Ungvar (Uzhhorod). Each one of these cities had a long and historically resonant past in the Kingdom of Hungary. I made it a point to visit each one of them (except Uzhhorod) during an eight-year period. If I had to do it over again, I would visit each of these cities on the same trip rather than piecemeal. That is because of their connection to Hungary. They are links in a chain that was broken after World War I and can never be repaired. The demography of these cities has changed. They now have fewer Hungarians and more inhabitants from the dominant ethnic group of the nations in which they are located.\n\nRight on time – Facade of the Oradea (Nagyvarad) Railway Station\n\nChange & Continuity – Going In Different Directions\n\nVisiting these cities on a single journey would be fascinating. Using Budapest as a hub, the cities could be visited either clockwise or counterclockwise. I could still go back and do this journey but having visited all but one of the cities already, I am not keen to follow in my own footsteps. At least, not in the flesh. The next best thing to visiting “the lost cities” in person is visiting them vicariously. That is what I intend to do by writing about this hypothetical journey. I have written about most of these cities in the past. Now I want to connect all of them together. A single itinerary that takes me back in time and forward in travel. There is no better time than the past, present and future to undertake this journey. While the cities have a rich Hungarian heritage, they also have a history with the other ethnic groups who inhabited them then, as they do today.\n\nThese ethnic groups have been in the ascendant since the end of World War II. Their influence has been profound. Their attachment to these cities cannot be denied. The cities were never lost to them in the same context which Hungarians use that term. It was a new beginning for Austria, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia (in 1994) and Ukraine (in 1991) with the assimilation of these cities into their own countries. The ethnic complexity in each of the cities still exists, albeit to a much lesser degree than just before the outbreak of World War I. The war and Treaty of Trianon changed everything, irreparably severing these cities from centuries of history, and reorienting them in a different direction going forward. This journey to the lost cities is about change and continuity. Two contradictory impulses that explain the history of Eastern Europe from the early 20th century to the present.\n\nClick here for: Retro Rail Ride – From Budapest to Eisenstadt & Bratislava (The Lost Cities #2)\n\nThe problem with history is that in the overriding majority of cases, the people being influenced by it, did not have to live through it. The present is separated by years, decades and centuries from the past. The context in which past events occurred is lost over time. Is it any wonder present opinions and values are imposed on views of the past? We who are here today always seem to know better. With such a vague, indirect and indifferent connection to the past it is hardly surprising that we look back through rose tinted glasses, with an air of alarming self-righteousness. Statements are made with complete confidence on how we would have done things differently. It is easy to make such proclamations when you do not have to live with consequences of your decisions.\n\nWe Know Better or They Knew Worse – The Folly of Armchair Historians\n\nNow that the 100th anniversary of the First World War is in full swing the retrospective judgments of a supposedly much wiser public are being posited with little regard to the context in which that ill-fated conflict was fought. Today’s opinion makers and armchair historians love to talk about how blundering diplomats were self-serving at best and willfully ignorant at worst. The nations and empires involved were filled with vile nationalistic instincts. The public was uninformed and naïve. The military strategists on all sides lacked vision and cultivated cataclysm rather than victory. While some of this is undoubtedly true, it is no truer than at any other time in history, especially when it comes to military affairs. What was different during the First World War was the lethal killing power readily available to all combatants. Machine trumped man and ushered in an age of efficiency in the art of murder that was scarcely fathomable then and almost as incomprehensible now, even with the hindsight of a century.\n\nOne opinion that is often espoused and quite irksome to hear is that countless lives were lost for nothing. This flows from the idea that the men fighting out in the trenches, across the battlefields and high seas really had no idea what they were fighting for. Even worse, if they did know, they somehow knew they were fighting for nothing in particular, a sort of violence for the sake of violence. Now do not get me wrong, millions of lives were wasted, but I am pretty certain that these men were definitely fighting for something, even if they were not totally conscious of it at the time.\n\nFighting Against Fate – The March To War\n\nThis brings us to the case of Hungary and the Great War. The Kingdom of Hungary lost hundreds of thousands of men on the battlefield in four long, bloody years. To make matters much worse, after the war, Hungary lost 64% and 72% respectively of its prewar territory and population in the negotiated peace. Supposedly this happened because of a war where Hungarian soldiers had no idea what they were fighting for. It was not so much what they were fighting for, it was more like what they were fighting against, specifically losing much of the Kingdom of Hungary. Case in point, the Prime Minister of Hungary, Count Istvan Tisza had been against Austria-Hungary going to war with Serbia. Indeed he had advised both Habsburg Emperor Franz Josef and Austria- Hungary’s Commander-In-Chief Conrad Von Hotzendorf to avoid war. Both the Emperor and Hotzendorf felt otherwise and their power trumped Tisza’s.\n\nSeeing that the dye was cast against him and his country – the Austrian leadership was hell bent on punishing the Serbs – he threw his lot in with the Austrians. Once the decision was made, Tisza and Hungary went full force into the conflict. He surmised, as did so many ethnic Hungarians that this was a life and death fight for the violability of the Kingdom. Self-interest, alliance and honor made any other decision impossible. The truth of the matter is that all those Hungarian men who were struck down in the sand and dust of Galicia, the frozen passes of the Carpathians, across the rugged terrain of northern Serbia and in the lonesome Alps of northern Italy most certainly were fighting for something. This was to keep the Kingdom of Hungary together or put another way, they were fighting against dissolution and revolution, to continue their most favored status in an increasingly unbalanced Dual Monarchy, riven by ethnic tensions.\n\nFear As A Great Motivator – The Seed of Self-Destruction\n\nWhat was pushing the entire Kingdom of Hungary over the top? Perhaps, it was the creeping suspicion that a loss would mean the end of their autonomy in the Dual Monarchy or even the end of the Empire itself. Fear is a great motivator and paradoxically it can lead men or whole nations to commit themselves to acts of courage that bring about their own self-destruction. The fear was that Hungary would be subsumed or even worse consumed by Germanic and Slavic peoples. Their power might erode or disintegrate from within the Empire. Every ethnic Hungarian who marched off to the front must have done so in the knowledge that they were fighting to continue being more equal than all the others in the Dual Monarchy. Even those ethnic Hungarians who lived as peasants in the most miserable circumstances were still better off than Slovaks, Romanians, Serbs, Slovenes and Croats.\n\nThe ethnic Hungarian was still a Magyar and need not undergo the process of Magyarization that had been fomented with such zeal by the Kingdom’s leadership since the Compromise of 1867 against all the “others.” The ethnic minorities or should we say (gasp), nationalities of the Kingdom really had no active role in the economic, political or cultural life of Greater Hungary. Yes those Hungarian soldiers were definitely fighting both for and against something on all those far flung fields beyond their borders, in battles beyond their worst nightmares. Those who survived the war to see the Kingdom sundered and their ethnic kin in Felvidék (Slovakia), Bácska (northern Serbia), Erdély (Transylvania), the Bánát (west-central Romania) and Kárpátalja (modern southwestern Ukraine) placed under the rule of Czechs and Slovaks, Serbs, Croats, Slovenes and Romanians most have known that this was what they had been fighting against all that time. The resulting dismemberment of the Kingdom bore out this great truth. Did these men die in vain? One could say yes, but if they had been victorious, the Kingdom would almost certainly have remained inviolable.\n\nIt Was Something & It Will Be Nothing – Of Victory & Of Defeat\n\nWhether or not one believes the cause the Hungarian soldier fought for was worth the terrible human cost, depends largely on one’s ethnicity. A Hungarian would say that it was absolutely worth it or would have been, had they met with victory. Was it still worth it in defeat? Was there any other choice? Many good men have died for all kinds of causes, both right and wrong, but to say that the men who went off to fight the Great War were fighting for nothing, especially in Hungary, is patently untrue. The ethnic Hungarian soldier’s fate was to fight for something that no longer exists. Yet armchair historians would do well to remember that eventually everyone who goes to war – whether they achieve victory or suffer defeat – fights for something that someday will no longer exist.\n\nIn 1896 a self-confident and rapidly developing Kingdom of Hungary prepared to celebrate the one-thousandth anniversary of the Magyar people’s arrival in the Carpathian Basin. Known as the Millennium Celebration, this was the culmination of a wave of nationalistic fervor. The most stunning piece of artwork created for the event – if not one of the most stunning in all of European history – was “The Arrival of the Hungarians,” a gigantic cyclorama (circular panoramic painting) conceived and largely painted under the direction of Arpad Feszty. First displayed in the Budapest City Park, it is still on view today, as the centerpiece of a National Heritage Park in the southern Hungarian town of Opusztaszer. Feszty’s grand opus is a must see piece of artwork, as much for its minute and withering array of detail as for its expression of nationalistic fervor.\n\nA Painting To Rival History – Taking Possession of the Moment\n\nTo lend a bit of perspective to the scale and scope of the cyclorama, consider that it is longer than an average football pitch and stands four and half stories high. The painting depicts over two thousand characters. The most prominent of these are the seven tribal chieftains of the Magyars, portrayed atop a hill, mounted on horseback, overlooking hundreds of their kinsmen. The paintings natural setting is the Verecke Pass (once part of the Kingdom of Hungary, now in the sub-Carpathian region of Ukraine) where the Magyars first entered the Carpathian Basin in the mid to late 890’s.\n\nIn 1896 a commemorative book The Millennium of Hungary (Az Ezereves Magayorszag es A Millennium Kiallitas) was published highlighting the exhibits on display at the celebration. The book contains text in four languages (Hungarian, German, English and French) describing large scale black and white photos of exhibits and locations that were part of this magnificent exhibition. Page seven of the publication has a detail from “The Arrival of the Hungarians.” It is called Arpad and the Chieftains (see photo above). The book has this to say: “This view represents the most momentous incident in the history of Hungary. It forms a conspicuous part of Arpad Feszty’s colossal round-view ‘The entry of the Hungarians into Hungary.’ Both as to its size and artistic merits, the picture holds the first place among all our paintings representing the great events in the history of our nation’s life during ten centuries. No artist has so thoroughly mastered and so well-conceived, the great events in Hungary like Arpad Feszty. We see here the cherished figure of Arpad the founder of the new fatherland, mounted on a fiery steed, and surrounded by his valiant paladins, standing on the hill after hard fought and glorious victories, taking possession of the land.”\n\n“How We Came To Be Who We Are Today” – Accessing History Through Art\n\nThe photo in the book is just one of many fascinating details from Festy’s panoramic canvas. The sheer size and breadth of the painting was an attempt to do justice to the Hungarian’s historical arrival in the Carpathian Basin. The scale, scope and detail of the painting evoke a sense of grandeur that is a direct reflection of the spirit of Hungary’s Belle Epoque (Golden Age) as equal partner in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The event Feszty decided to portray is the seminal moment in the creation of Hungarian identity. It is the most indispensable event in Hungary’s history. It goes without saying that if not for this event, there would have been no Hungary in Europe. It is the Magyar equivalent of America’s Declaration of Independence, France’s Revolution, England’s Magna Carta and the unification of Germany. Rarely have a people been so blessed with a single, defining event that they could point to and say “that’s how we came to be who we are today.” It is quite incredible that Festy could create a piece of artwork that lived up to that moment.\n\nIn retrospect, the millennial celebrations were the pinnacle of this Golden Age as the country had achieved virtual autonomy and a self-confidence unrivalled before or since in the nation’s history. This was the upshot of its equal partnership in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. The painting is the artistic representation of a nation looking back at itself and seeing greatness in its very beginnings. It is a fantastic interweaving of history and myth, both inseparable and indistinguishable from one another. It all sounds a bit unreal until the viewer stands before the magnificent canvas in Opustaszer. Then they can see how the Hungarians saw themselves: heroic, noble and visionary. “The Arrival of the Hungarians” is more than art. It is the merging of a fervent imagination with history.\n\nA Reflection of The Soul of Hungary – Feszty’s Achievement\n\nThere are many prominent examples of latter day myth making where a nation attempts with varying degrees of success to portray its past. These often leave the viewer wondering what historical personages might say if they see how they have been interpreted. To take one example, what would Lincoln think of his larger than life marble memorial in Washington, D.C. He would most likely blush – or perhaps even faint – after being shown these examples of triumphal deification. On the other hand, there are those very few examples where a monument or monumental work rises to the level of its subject matter. One of the rare cases of this is Feszty’s “Arrival of the Hungarians” The viewer gets the distinct suspicion that Arpad, the Chieftains and the two thousand other Magyars portrayed would be both proud and honored. For they are looking at themselves as both, myth and reality, a mirror of themselves and a reflection of the soul of Hungary.\n\nThe teaching of history often consists of little more than forcing students to memorize a seemingly endless litany of inane facts and dates. The connections and contexts which are so critical to historical understanding often get lost in a maze of minutia. This is unfortunate, because history is really about trying to understand human actions that have occurred in the past. Since these actions were committed by people, they are full of complexities and contradictions. Thus, it is hardly surprising, that history is an inexact science. It is very difficult to predict the future from what has happened in the past, precisely because human actions are quite unpredictable, even as they are influenced by the past. The small unassuming village of Paradsasvar tucked into the Matra Mountains of northern Hungary holds a structure and a life story that illustrates the complexities of one man who shaped history in the form of his own contradictory character.\n\nPrivilege, Splendor and Failure – The Karolyi Conundrum\n\nArriving in Paradsasvar visitors are almost immediately drawn to the Karolyi-kastely. This otherworldly creation of the famed architect Miklos Ybl is a contradiction in and of itself. For all intents and purposes the kastely is an imaginative concoction of wickedly steep roofs, including a turret not for defense, but decoration. Covered by a faded red coat of color trimmed in vibrant yellow, it is an architectural fiesta, nothing less than a celebration of opulence and eclecticism. The contradiction comes from the castle’s setting, surrounded by thick, dark forest. This confection of neoclassicism is the direct opposite of its cloistered natural setting.\n\nLike the Kastely, its former owner is a contradiction as well. The castle was one of the many homes belonging to Mihaly Karolyi, one of the most controversial figures in Hungarian history. He was born at nearby Fot, into the immense wealth and prestige of the noble Karolyi family. The family was part of a stable of rich landowning aristocrats in the pre-World War I Kingdom of Hungary. These elites ran the country, enjoying vast political prestige and power. They were the crème de la crème of a rigid class system. Karolyi grew up in this world of wealth and privilege. He was something of a wastrel in his youth, squandering both opportunity and money in equal measure.\n\nA Nightmare of Contradictions – Karolyi & the Common Man\n\nIn 1910 Karolyi was elected to parliament as a member of the opposition. Though opposed to many of the ruling government’s traditional policies, Karolyi like almost everyone else at the time supported Hungary’s entry into the First World War. As the war dragged on, Karolyi became extremely critical of the government in power. He was seen as something of a rebel. For instance, he supported the right to vote for war veterans and women. He also pushed for land reform. By today’s standards these views seem perfectly normal. Judging by those of early 20th century Hungary, he was an extreme radical, especially considering his aristocratic lineage.\n\nAnd therein lay the contradiction, this man who had benefited from aristocratic birthright, who was a scion of one of Europe’s richest families, was advocating policies diametrically opposed to the nobility’s interests. He wanted to free the peasantry from the yoke of virtual serfdom, giving them land and rights they had never experienced before. Here was Mihaly Karolyi who lived in the most opulent circumstances imaginable fighting for the common man. Was his benevolence born of guilt? Was Karolyi trying to make up for his physical defects? After all, he spoke with a lisp and had been something of an outcast in aristocratic circles. Perhaps he was trying to get back at his own class. Was he a naive idealist who lacked the vision to see that his beliefs might actually bring about the Kingdom of Hungary’s disintegration? Was he a reckless wastrel who only knew how to squander power? Was he a visionary or a hypocrite? It is hard to say, but he certainly was a contradiction.\n\nChaos & Dissolution – Karolyi at the Helm\n\nThe cliché that character is destiny certainly holds true in Karolyi’s case. His character informed his short, unhappy term at the helm of a Hungary thrown into chaos by loss of the war. He was given the reins of power at the single worst possible moment. Just days after the war ended, with the Kingdom crumbling, Karolyi took charge of the government. He expressed the same idealistic beliefs of the victorious allies, self-determination and a peace free of reparations. He trusted the British and French to believe that he, Mihaly Karolyi could not only right the wrongs of the past, but also lead Hungary toward the bright uplands of liberal democracy. He would extend the franchise beyond the meager six percent of the male population that were allowed to vote. He would give land to the peasants. He even set a stirring example by dividing his own estates up for the peasants.\n\nMeanwhile, the Allies pretty much ignored Karolyi. He had decided to disband the Hungarian Army, a fatal mistake. The Romanians, Czechs and Serbs soon invaded Hungary. Karolyi’s government was a disaster. In power for only a matter of months, he ended up turning the nation over to the communists which was an even greater disaster. The upshot was chaos and dissolution. Hungary eventually was forced to sign the Treaty of Trianon, losing two-thirds of its land and population. Nothing was ever the same again. Karolyi had been at the helm when the chaos was at its worst and he suffered much of the blame.\n\nThe Grand Delusion\n\nIt is hard not to look at the Karolyi-kastely, with its fantasy like appearance and wonder how in the world a man who once lived in this palatial mansion, surrounded by natural beauty and material bounty could have ever involved himself in such misguided radicalism. Perhaps the castle offers a clue. It looks like a fantasy and contradicts its natural surroundings. This is much like Karolyi himself, who while surrounded by the glitter of wealth and aristocratic splendor fomented the cause of radical socialism. Karolyi was enchanted by what turned out to be nothing more than a grand delusion. His life, his politics and Karolyi-kastely are filled with contradiction and complexity, reflective of the competing impulses that ruled and wrecked his life.\n\nYou are unlikely to find the Battle of Mohi in any European History textbooks. Even in Hungary, where the battle resulted in cataclysm, it has fallen out of the historical consciousness. This is unfortunate because it was a defining historical event for the Kingdom of Hungary. The battle and its aftereffects were the beginning of several historical trends that would reoccur in Hungarian history. The battle itself was an unmitigated disaster. The Mongol Army under the command of Batu Khan used their mobile calvary to rout the Hungarian forces. Following the battle, the Mongols rampaged across the Carpathian Basin causing destruction on a tremendous scale. Yet within a year and a half they withdrew. Their legacy of conquest was short lived. The same could not be said for other conquerors of Hungary who in future centuries would set down deeper roots.\n\nMohi – Precursor & Predictor of the Future\n\nThe battle does not fit easily within the traditional Hungarian historical narrative. The early Middle Ages are ancient history to Hungarians. Prior to the Mongol Invasion, Hungary had experienced three centuries of successful state building in the Carpathian Basin. The Arpad Dynasty produced good rulers who created a regional power respected and feared by its neighbors. It looked as though Hungary might become the great power of Eastern Europe. This is largely forgotten due to invasions and occupations which further shaped Hungary. Including the Ottoman Turkish occupation, Habsburg Absolutism, the dismemberment of historic Hungary at Trianon and Soviet imposed Communist rule.\n\nHungary as a successful flourishing state – which is certainly what it was before the Battle of Mohi – goes against the grain of today’s popular Hungarian historical narrative. Hungarians now understand their history as moments of greatness followed by luckless defeat. This was not really the case until the Battle of Mohi. The battle began a historical trend that would reemerge in the ensuing centuries: an ascendant Hungary cut down before it fully takes flight. Mohi is an illuminating event because it is reflective of Hungarian history.\n\nDivision & Conquest\n\nTrend # 1: Political turmoil leads to disunity\n\nIn the years leading up to Mohi, the Kingdom of Hungary was rocked by divisions between the nobility and the king. In 1235, King Bela IV ascended the throne. Almost immediately he began to reverse the privileges that had been granted the nobility by his father King Andrew II. These privileges had included donations of vast estates to the nobles. They had also been given greater political rights which increased their power and weakened the throne. Once he took power, Bela IV began to re-confiscate the land which the nobles now saw as rightfully theirs. The nobles also tried to challenge the king’s authority, but Bela limited their political rights. They were not even allowed to petition him in person, they had to send written petitions instead. Bela had moved the Kingdom toward autocratic rule. He might have been able to get away with this, but as the Mongol threat grew on the eastern horizon, Bela IV suddenly needed the nobles to provide forces to protect the Kingdom, but they were now ambivalent. Their indifference would prove costly. This type of divisive political turmoil has been a hallmark of other Hungarian historical disasters.\n\nSecond Class Citizens – The Coming of the Cumans\n\nTrend #2: Failure to assimilate foreigners\n\nThe Cumans were a tribe of nomadic warriors who had been pushed westward into the Carpathian Basin by the Mongol advance. The Cumans were good warriors. They were willing to fight with the Hungarians against the Mongols as long as they could settle in the country. Bela IV realized this was to his advantage. He allowed them to settle within the lands of the Kingdom. They were Christianized as well. Despite this, the majority of the populace would not accept them. This led to riots and infighting. Bela supported the integration of the Cumans since they bolstered his power. The nobles were embittered by his favoritism towards what they saw as nothing more than primitive nomads. This furthered the division and disunity prior to battle. The situation with the Cumans is indicative of the Hungarian attitude throughout their history towards foreigners in general. Other peoples may be allowed to live within the Kingdom (see the nationalities prior to World War I), but they were second class citizens. This us versus them mentality towards outsiders would have disastrous consequences not only at Mohi, but many more times for Hungary in the future.\n\nThe Second Founding\n\nTrend #3: Victory From Defeat\n\nFollowing defeat at Mohi, the Kingdom of Hungary was reduced to a wasteland by marauding Mongol forces. One-fifth of the population was killed and sixty percent of the settlements were destroyed. The Kingdom lay in ruins. Bela IV fled all the way to the Dalmatian Coast. He barely escaped with his life and throne intact. It could have meant the end of Hungary, but it led to a new beginning. Bela IV put a vast amount of resources into building fortified, hilltop castles. In a ten year period of rebuilding that began after the Mongols withdrew from Carpathian Basin in 1242, over forty castles were constructed. The Hungarian army was reorganized with heavy armored Calvary. The next attempted Mongol invasion met with defeat. The Kingdom recovered and was soon flourishing once again. This was an incredible achievement, so much so that Bela IV is now seen by many historians as the second founder of Hungary. His reign would last for thirty five years.\n\nRising From The Ashes\n\nThis type of recovery would be repeated several more times by Hungarians. The Ottoman Turkish occupation, the heavy hand of the Habsburgs and the imposition of Communism by the Soviet Union all changed the history of Hungary for the worse. Nonetheless, Hungarians have always found a way to make the best of a bad situation. They have managed to overcome invasion and occupation. Even in disunity and defeat, they rise from the ashes and recreate their kingdom, their nation and their history.\n\nOver a period of nine hundred years, the monarchs of the Kingdom of Hungary were crowned in four different cities. Three of these four cities still lie in the territory of the Hungarian nation today. They are Esztergom, Budapest and Szekesfehervar. Interestingly, it was the last of these three towns that saw more Hungarian monarchs crowned than any other. From the middle of the 11th century through the middle of the 16th, no less than 37 kings and 39 queens consort were crowned in Szekesfehervar, at the Basilica. This was exactly how the first King of Hungary, Stephen I had planned it. Stephen had ordered the construction of a grand basilica around the year 1010 for just such ceremonies. It was one of the largest and most prominent buildings in Europe during the Middle Ages, a symbol of the power, majesty and Christianity of the Kingdom. Long before Visegrad or Budapest came to prominence, Szekesfehervar was the nerve center of Hungary during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Coming of the Turks – The Path to Pozsony\n\nAs with so many things in the history of the Kingdom of Hungary, this underwent radical change with the invasion of the Ottoman Turks. In 1543, the Turks occupied Szekesfehervar. They proceeded to loot the tombs of the 15 kings and queens buried in the Basilica. Their banditry knew no bounds. It respected neither tradition nor religion. Insultingly, the Basilica was turned into a storage site for gunpowder. With much of their kingdom occupied, Hungarian leaders had little choice, but to move the coronation site. Beginning in 1563, coronations took place in upper Hungary, at St. Martin’s Cathedral in Pozsony (present day Bratislava, Slovakia). For over two-hundred and fifty years, prospective monarchs strode through the Old Town of Pozsony along the coronation route. They made their way to the Gothic confines of the cathedral where kings and queens were crowned.\n\nFollowing the expulsion of the Turks from the lands of historic Hungary in the late 17th century, coronations continued to take place in Pozsony. The last one occurred in 1830. In the meantime, the basilica in Szekesfehervar had longed since ceased to exist. It was destroyed in 1601 when a Habsburg Army unsuccessfully laid siege to the city. The gunpowder stored inside the basilica was sparked by fire from the ongoing battle and consequently blew up. Meanwhile St. Martin’s served the purpose of continuity and tradition. As the site for the coronation of 19 kings and queens, including no less a historical personage than Maria Theresa, it played an integral role in both Hungarian and Habsburg history. The coronations may have ended in Pozsony by the mid-19th century, but history was not through with the place.\n\nHistorical Twists – The Fate of Hungary’s Coronation Sites\n\nThe city was lost by the Hungarians, along with Upper Hungary (Felvidek) to the newly created state of Czechoslovakia, due to the post-war Treaty of Trianon that followed World War I. Today Pozsony is Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Other than tourists, the presence of ethnic Hungarians in the city is minimal. In a historical twist of fate concerning the coronation sites, Hungarians had been detached from their history during the Middle Ages at Szekesfehervar due to an external threat. Nearly four hundred years later, they were once again severed from their historical past, but this time by an internal disruption. St. Martin’s Cathedral with its glorious past was cut asunder from its historical antecedents.\n\nToday the cathedral still stands on the western edge of what was the Old Town of Pozsony. Within a stone’s throw, a major highway acts as a conduit for automobiles racing back and forth over the Novy Most Bridge and the Danube. In the last decade and a half, the church has undergone stabilization due to the vibrations caused by the nearby traffic. In this case, the past has become present once again, in prior centuries the church survived fires, earthquakes and lightning strikes. Today the question is whether it will survive the rumblings of modernity? Perhaps this is an apt metaphor for the presence of Hungarian history in Bratislava. It rests on shaky foundations.\n\nSt. Martin’s Cathedral – Where History Reigns Supreme\n\nThe question today is how will the rich history of St. Martin’s Cathedral be viewed in a Slovakia which looks more toward the future? As opposed to a Hungary which is obsessed with its past. Strangely enough, there is a magnificent reminder that all has not been lost. Quite literally a crowning achievement tops St. Martin’s. Atop the church’s Gothic steeple is a gold plated replica of the Holy Crown of Hungary. At 85 meters (279 feet) it soars above the Old Town, just as it did when it was first placed there in 1847. It was meant to commemorate the church’s historic role in royal coronations. The crown is still there today, resting on a gold pillow, a spectacular reminder that no matter what nation rules over this land today, it is still history which reigns supreme.\n\nDeep within the dusty tomes of long forgotten history books, hidden nuggets of illuminating information have been known to arise. The old saying that the truth is stranger than fiction can have a much deeper meaning when a fresh light is cast on a once obscure past. As we happen to be on the cusp of the 100th Anniversary of the First World War I have been doing some research on one of my favorite subjects, the Austro-Hungarian Military. Lately I have had the distinct pleasure of reading through Austria-Hungary’s Last War 1914 – 1918 prepared by the Austrian Federal Ministry of the Army and War Archive. This seven volume set was first published in 1930. Up until just a few years ago there was no English translation available. In 2010, a translation was finally completed by historian Stan Hanna. What an incredible achievement! The seven volumes run to several thousand pages in length. One hazards to guess how Hanna was able to do it all. With this translation English speaking military history buffs now have a window into nearly every facet of the Austro-Hungarian military apparatus during the Great War. A panoramic view is now available of the most multi-cultural empire in European history.\n\nTo the Ends of an Empire\n\nConsider that it was almost exactly one hundred years ago when the Austria-Hungary went to war with a polyglot group of Central and Eastern Europeans who were tied together for better or worse by an old and faltering monarchy. The empire was home to 51 million people, consisting of nine different ethnic groups of at least a million or more in population. This demographic breakdown still has the power to amaze and confound. How such a multi-cultural, ethnic stew stayed together as long as it did, has become the subject of many debates.\n\nEven more astonishing is the fact that during World War One, the army fought on three separate fronts, suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties, numerous setbacks and yet still somehow held together until the very last months of the conflict. Seemingly against all logic, a motley collection of ethnicities carried on a war in some of the most undesirable circumstances and locales experienced by any army in the modern age. Yes there were mutinies at times, yes there were disgruntled soldiers, desertions and surrenders, yes the empire disintegrated at the end of the war. These facts are all indisputable. Yet the empire also lasted for nearly the entire duration of the war, despite a panoply of competing cultures and nationalities vying for freedom, respect and independence.\n\nAll for One, One Against All\n\nPerhaps the best way of trying to understand the miracle of illogic that was the Austro-Hungarian Empire is to breakdown just one of the many fascinating statistics found in the seven volumes. On page 42 of Austria-Hungary’s Last War, 1914 – 1918, Volume 1 is the following sentence: “Out of every 100 soldiers in the Austro-Hungarian Army there were 25 Germans, 23 Magyars, 13 Czechs, 9 Serbo-Croats, 8 Poles, 8 Ruthenes, 7 Romanians, 4 Slovaks, and 1 Italian.” This breakdown is quite compelling when viewed with hindsight. Today we know what became of the empire’s ethnic constituents.\n\nStart with the fact that all of the above ethnic groups were squeezed within the borders of a single governing entity. The pressure of that squeeze caused fissures and faults along ethnic lines. The cracks exposed new nations and states, some of which have stood the test of time and others that have long since been resigned to the dustbin of history. A look at what became of these peoples in the aftermath of the empire’s dissolution is revealing. The Germans were predominantly from what would become the nation of Austria. It has been a successful state by any measure, excepting the period when it was sucked up into the vortex of Nazism. Other groups of Germans were scattered in several areas further east. Following the Second World War, luck, fate or a combination of both led them back to Germany via expulsion. The Magyars became a nation, now that they were no longer allowed to be the Kingdom of Hungary. For those Hungarians who still long to right the injustice of the Kingdom’s dismembering by the postwar Treaty of Trianon, they need to keep in mind that in the kingdom, Magyars were barely half the populace. In Hungary today they make up over 90% of the population. The war tore apart the Kingdom, but gave them a nation they can always call their own.\n\nA Constant State of Becoming\n\nThe Czechs united with the Slovaks, creating a state which only lasted until the next war. It rose again after the war, but was peacefully sundered from within. Less than five years after the iron curtain ceased to exist so did Czechoslovakia. The Serbo-Croats started a South Slav state of their own, which descended into warring statelets due to the Second World War. Afterwards it was put back together again, but fell apart once and for all time following the end of communism. Freedom had a strange and unsettling effect on became known as the former Yugoslavia. The Poles finally got their nation back following the Great War, only to have it blown into near oblivion by the Nazis. Somehow it survived. Today it represents a successful, if precarious example of a successful post-communist state.\n\nThen there was the Ruthenes, a people who have become the heart of Ukrainian nationalism in the western Ukraine today. Turning towards the west and then forced east, they are in a constant state of becoming. The story is much the same today as it was during the final decades of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Galicia playing its stereotypical role as impoverished backwater has been Europeanized with some success. The Romanians already had their nation, but to them it was never complete without Transylvania. They have pretty much had it that way – with one notable Hungarian forced exception – since the Great War. They have Transylvania, but will they ever have prosperity? And then there were the Tyrol Italians, caught between the Germanic and Latin worlds. They say you can’t have your cake and eat it too, but freed from the shackles of empire these Italians were gluttons who managed to escape the punishing legacy of a post imperial world.\n\nVanishing Act\n\nIn a nutshell, this is the history of the Austro-Hungarian Empire’s constituent parts. What had been all for one prior to the Great War, became every ethnicity for itself at the end of the war. It was self-interest over collective interest. This was the ultimate betrayal of Austria-Hungary and led directly to its ruin. The results were or still are today: Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Yugoslavia, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Poland, Greater Romania, the Soviet Union, Ukraine and Greater Italy. The loosely unified yet fatally flawed empire is today twelve disparate nations. A whole new world has come into being, born from a vanished one.\n\nThe Saxon legacy in Transylvania is impressive. The numerous fortified churches, magnificent town squares and quaint houses with gabled roofs scattered in towns throughout the region are a testament to their faith, determination and industriousness. Though there are very few people of Saxon descent left in Transylvania today, their legacy is secure. Nostalgic impulses by those of Saxon descent have led to the creation of associations dedicated to preserving the architecture and culture of their ancestors.\n\nOne Man, One Policy\n\nOver eight hundred and fifty years have passed since the first Saxons settled in the area, but go to Brasov or Sibiu (known to the Saxons as Kronstadt and Hermannstadt) to witness the resurgence of Saxon heritage. It is likely that in the coming years, if anything the Saxon nostalgia in Transylvania will be the focus of even greater efforts. It is certainly given a prominent place in marketing by Romania’s growing tourist industry.\n\nThis focus on the Saxons historical accomplishments is delightful and definitely worth seeking out as a travel experience, yet it obscures the fact that if not for the decisive policy of one man none of this would have been possible. This man happened to be neither Saxon nor Romanian, but instead Hungarian. The eight and a half centuries of Saxon achievement began with a king that very few Saxons today would be able to identify. This was Hungarian King Geza II who reigned from 1141 – 1161. He was the leader who took the foresighted decision to allow Saxon settlement in Transylvania. His life and legacy should be the starting point for efforts to understand the very beginning of Saxon settlement in the Carpathians.\n\nA Miracle of a Man – The Roots of Geza II\n\nGeza II was something of a miracle. Even by the standards of the violent and precarious early Middle Ages he needed more than his fair share of fortune to survive childhood, let alone gain the throne. His father is known to history as Bela the Blind. Both Bela and his father were blinded by his uncle, King Coloman in the early 12th century. They were then sent to live out their lives in a monastery. Bela’s father continued to prove a threat, to the extent that he was eventually forced into permanent exile. As for Bela, his luck rapidly changed after Coloman died and his son Stephen II ascended to the throne. Stephen II had a big problem in that he was unable produce a royal heir. Luckily for Stephen his father had not managed to execute Bela. It is said that Stephen was filled with joy when he discovered that Bela was still alive and well at a monastery. A possible royal successor who had been blinded in most cases have had little chance to gain the throne, not to mention produce an heir. The chronicles state that Bela was also slated for castration, but the military officer charged with the duty lost his nerve and could not commit such an act.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that Bela ended up in line to succeed Stephen. He also made a smart marriage to a Serbian Princess, Helena of Rascia. In 1130 they produced their first son, a boy who would eventually become known to history as Geza II. Geza, born to a blind father who was supposed to have been castrated, would one day come to rule the Kingdom of Hungary. If all these turns of fortune were not enough, the family was allowed to live on a large estate bequeathed to them by Stephen II. Instead of seeing Bela and his family as a threat or believing that Bela was unfit for the throne because he had been mutilated, Stephen instead placed him in position to lead the Hungarian Kingdom. And that is just what occurred in 1131 when Stephen died. Bela the Blind ascended to the throne and reigned for a decade.\n\nThe Virtues of Loyalty & Privilege\n\nIn 1141 the blind king died. Suddenly, improbably, Geza II was the newly crowned king at the tender age of eleven. For the next five years his mother, with the assistance of her brother, led the Kingdom until young Geza came of age. When he eventually took charge, Geza quickly proved himself as a ruler, securing his throne by outwitting usurpers, many of which were close relatives. He also was adept at involving himself in foreign affairs and succeeding. The main trend of Geza’s reign is that he was almost constantly at war. The kingdom was externally vulnerable on multiple fronts. This called for Geza to place strategic thinking over tactical discipline. At one time or another he was at war on his western flank with the Holy Roman Empire, in the south with Byzantium and in the northeast with the Polish crown. In addition, he had to deal with German forces that crossed Hungary on their way to the Second Crusade. He was able to fend off each of these threats. An understanding of external threats may have led him toward a strategy of securing one of his frontiers by bringing in the Saxons. He adeptly made the far sighted decision to allow Saxon settlement in Transylvania as guardians of the Kingdom’s southeastern flank. (Note: Saxons has a different meaning in the context of Transylvania. The first settlers were not from Saxony, but Luxembourg and the Moselle Valley. Their name came from the fact that the Hungarian chancellery referred to these groups as Saxons.)\n\nThe Saxons were given privileges which allowed unheard of independence for the time, including freedom of religion and self-rule. The lone requirement was that they provide military service to the king if he went to war. They were only required to do this for the crown, not the nobility. It was a good deal for them and the Hungarian Kingdom. This can be seen by the fact that in the 13th century Hungarian Kings offered much the same terms to successive waves of Saxon settlers. The Saxons were loyal to the throne, but were otherwise left to conduct their internal affairs as they pleased. More of these settlers poured into Transylvania. It was not long before they were referring to the area as “Siebenburgen” meaning the land of seven fortresses, a reference to the main Saxon cities in Transylvania.\n\nMore Than A King – A Visionary\n\nGeza II died in 1161. Today he is remembered as one of the best Hungarian kings of the time. His improbable rise was only matched by his uncanny success in managing foreign policy. He dealt with multiple threats to the Hungarian Kingdom’s frontiers with great vision and foresight. By bringing in the Saxons as guardians of the Kingdom’s southeastern frontier he set into motion a policy that paid dividends for centuries to come. It led directly to the rise of the Saxons in Transylvania. From this beneficial start they went on to construct an economic, political and cultural civilization that rivals any in the history of European minorities. Thousands of their ancestors still travel to Transylvania each year to witness firsthand what the Saxons created and cultivated for centuries on end. Few if any of these visitors know who started it all. Geza II deserves to be remembered as more than just a king, he deserves to be remembered as a visionary.\n\nOn the edge of the Varosliget (City Park) in Budapest, along a well trafficked street sits the Roheim Villa. Calling this large two story house at Hermin Utca 35 a villa requires a leap of the imagination. What seems today to be nothing more than a crumbling two story edifice, was just a century ago a stately and well kept residence. Its exterior freshly painted, lawn manicured and gardens filled with blossoming flowers. Today, the villa is well on its way to ruin. Its chipped facade slowly crumbling, the “villa” stands vacant and neglected. On a visit to the address last week I quickly discovered that there was no way to visit the villa or the small grounds surrounding it. Even if one were to trespass there would have been little to see. It would not have been worth the bother of getting onto the property. Getting a good glimpse of the structure is not impossible, but was made difficult by large, leafless trees, a tall wrought iron fencing surrounding the villa and an abandoned guard house just beyond a locked entrance gate. I found the villa’s condition rather sad, but not surprising. In a way, its unsightliness, went hand in hand with its history. After all, the Roheim Villa was where the foremost political persona of early 20th century Hungary had met his end. On October 31, 1918 Count Istvan Tisza, wartime prime minster of Hungary was assassinated by disgruntled soldiers for his role in leading Hungary into World War One. In the war’s immediate aftermath, Hungary had descended into chaos and Tisza lost his life in the process.\n\nTo be sure Roheim Villa as a historic site or museum would not be much more popular now than it would have been in the years following Tisza’s assassination. After all, who in Hungary then or now wants to recall a time when the newly born republic swung wildly, first to radical socialism then to communism and finally to reactionary conservatism all within a ten month period following Tisza’s murder. If the palace were to become a well funded state museum or part of some private foundation it would be restored to its former glory. A glory that would not do the past justice. By the time of Tisza’s assassination Hungary was in the throes of a transformation that would remake the Kingdom into a nation-state. A state riven by both internal and external threats, soon to be torn asunder by an unjust post war treaty and left searching for its prior greatness. The old Hungary had died in the Great War and its final bloodletting was the murder of Tisza.\n\nThe only relatively recent addition to the Roheim Villa is a historic marker appended to the facade. From outside the gates, even at a distant, black lettering on the marker’s white background can be seen. It states that here was the place where Tisza was murdered on that fateful October day. That seems to be the only memorial really necessary. If anything, the abandoned villa is a fitting symbol for Tisza and the outmoded way of life he had spent his life preserving. The villa as it stands crumbling today, is the physical embodiment of the dying vestiges of an aristocratic conservative tradition that had dominated the Kingdom of Hungary. That tradition, like Tisza, was not just obsolete by the waning days of 1918, it was dead."
