        "text": "The Kingdom of Hungary was a country in Central Europe founded in the year 1000 upon the coronation of Stephen I, Grand Prince of the Hungarians, as king following his conversion to Christianity. The nation was ruled by the Árpád dynasty, which also established rule over the Duchy of Austria during the reign of Stephen VI.\n\nIn the early modern period the Kingdom of Hungary became an influential and expansionist European power; its campaigns west catalyzed the Italian Wars and conflicts with the Habsburgs and the Premyslid Dynasty of Bohemia, while in the west and south the Hungarians fought numerous conflicts with the Byzantine Empire. During the Protestant Reformation the nation remained Catholic officially, but was unable to deter the propagation of Protestant sects, which divided the nation."
