        "text": "Charles I (born 1288, Naples, Kingdom of Naples [Italy]—died July 16, 1342, Visegrád, Hung.) was a courtly, pious king of Hungary who restored his kingdom to the status of a great power and enriched and civilized it.\n\nCharles was the son of Charles Martel of Anjou-Naples and Clemencia of Habsburg, daughter of the Holy Roman emperor Rudolf I. As great-grandson of Stephen V and with papal approval, Charles claimed the Hungarian throne after the death of Andrew III, the last of the Árpád line, and was crowned in 1301. When his claim was disputed, however, he was forced to surrender the crown to Wenceslas of Bohemia, who in 1305 transferred his right to Otto, duke of Lower Bavaria. After Otto was taken prisoner by the Hungarians, Charles was recognized as king in 1308 and received the Crown of St. Stephen at Székesfehérvár on Aug. 27, 1310.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
