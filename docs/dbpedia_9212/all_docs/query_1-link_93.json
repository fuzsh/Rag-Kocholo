        "text": "This beautiful castle in Szekesfehervar holds a rich and fascinating history. Originally built in the early twentieth century, it was the brainchild of architect Jenő Bory. The castle showcases Bory’s love for the versatile material concrete, particularly quartz concrete, which can be seen in the door and window frames, columns, domes, balustrades, staircases, fountains, pools, and statues throughout the castle. Inside, you’ll also find an impressive collection of contemporary artworks, including sculptures and paintings by Bory himself and his wife, Ilona Komócsin. Today, the castle is managed and cared for by Bory’s descendants, who work tirelessly to preserve its legacy. A must-visit for history and art enthusiasts alike, Bory Castle stands as a testament to the innovative spirit and creative vision of its founder.\n\nFrom different floors of the tower, you can explore various attractions. The first floor features a historical arcade, the second floor boasts a balcony, and the fourth floor is where the tower itself is situated. On a clear day, you can enjoy panoramic views of not only the town but also the Vértes and Bakony Mountains.\n\nOne of the highlights within the Pointed Tower is the Guardroom, located at the bottom. Here, you can find intriguing pieces such as a torso of Saint Sebastian, believed to be made of painted wood from the late 18th century. Additionally, you can marvel at a cast copy of Bory’s Ecce Homo, created in 1922. This life-sized, tortured Christ figure is uniquely crafted with tough and lumpish shapes, showcasing Jenő Bory’s distinctive artistic style.\n\nMoreover, the Pointed Tower provides a fantastic photo opportunity. Through the intricate ornaments and details, you can capture stunning shots that showcase the true essence and grandeur of this historical landmark. Don’t miss out on this chance to document your visit and create lifelong memories at the Pointed Tower.\n\nLocated under the middle part of the arcades in the center of Bory Castle, the Chapel of the Marital Love serves as a powerful symbol. At the heart of this chapel stands a full-size statue of Marital Love, modeled after the wife of the artist. The statue is seated within a curved space adorned with beautiful murals. Notably, the walls in front of the shrine feature a symmetrical composition called “Kiss,” which further accentuates the significance of the statue. Above the statue, a mural depicts yellow-colored ladies representing famous artists’ muses, including Mona Lisa, who turned yellow out of envy, as they are not loved as deeply as Bory’s wife."
