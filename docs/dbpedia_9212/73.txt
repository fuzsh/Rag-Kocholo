Székesfehérvár, city with county status and seat of Fejér megye (county), west-central Hungary. One of the oldest cities in Hungary, it is located on the northeastern fringe of the Bakony Mountains, southwest of Budapest.

A Roman settlement, Herculea, superseded an earlier Celtic village on the site. In the 10th century it was known as Alba Regia. It was a strong fortress with a naturally defensible hinterland of large swamps and marshes. Stephen I (1000–38), the first king of Hungary, built it up as the capital of the Hungarian kingdom. It was occupied in 1543 by the Turks, who withdrew in 1688 after looting and destroying the cathedral and palace, and for a while Székesfehérvár was depopulated. From the 18th century onward the city revived, and a large-scale building program was initiated, but tragic history was repeated in 1945, when the last German counterattack within Hungary resulted in near-total destruction again.

The ruins of the medieval cathedral where many Hungarian kings were crowned are carefully preserved. Some fine Baroque buildings survive, including the bishop’s palace. The city’s historic legacy can also be seen in its statuary. The Budenz House features a collection of the fine and applied arts of Miklós Ybl, the great Hungarian architect, along with the work of other artists. Museums and galleries also include the King St. Stephen Museum, the Black Eagle Chemist’s Museum, the Hetedhét Toy Museum, and the Town Gallery Deák Collection.
