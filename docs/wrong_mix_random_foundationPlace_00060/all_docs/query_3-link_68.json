        "text": "What is your title at EvCC, and what will you be doing in your day-to-day endeavors at the College?\n\nHello! My title is Interim Dean of Health Sciences and Public Safety. My day-to-day endeavors will be to support our wonderful faculty and staff for those areas, as well as contribute to student success initiatives.\n\nTell us a little about your professional background.\n\nI’ve served in higher education for a little over ten years. Six years with Green River College, where I served as a Dean of Instruction and Dean of Student Success and Retention, and four years with Edmonds Community College, as an instructor and program consultant within Workforce Education. Prior to my start within higher education, I helped the Washington Department of Veterans Affairs create their Traumatic Brain Injury Program. That was a very rewarding experience and I try to find ways to engage within the veterans and disability support services areas as often as they will let me.\n\nWhat was your most memorable job? Why?\n\nThe most memorable job was the United States Army. I served for a little over five years, and deployed to both Afghanistan and Iraq. I met some incredible people during that time and everything that I experienced changed who I am today.\n\nWhat is your favorite meal/ snack in summer? Favorite summer beverage?\n\nMy favorite meal/snack has to be seafood. I’m always trying to eat my weight in salmon and oysters. I live in the perfect place for that! My favorite summer beverage is probably beer…but I am a beer snob (full disclosure).\n\nTell us three things most people don’t know about you.\n\nI love riding on our ferries and try to do it as often as I can. I’m secretly trying to get one, or both, of my sons (14 and 8) to choose ferry boat captain as their future profession, so that I can ride with them whenever I want. I’ve promised to make them coffee, or get them snacks as a way of paying my way.\n\nI love to brew my own beer. My wife and I typically host several brewing days at our place each year and it is always fun to have people over to help out with the process. We try to make it a community event, as there is nothing better than being creative with others.\n\nFinally, my wife and I have had the goal of visiting all 50 states. We will finally finish that goal later on this fall. Travelling has been very rewarding, and we enjoy getting off of the beaten path wherever we end up. My favorite place is probably Homer, AK. We visited it earlier this year, and I fell in love. If you get a chance, Google the Land’s End Restaurant in Homer. The pictures/setting is stunning.\n\nWhat is your favorite book? Favorite movie? What makes these choices your favorites?\n\nThis is really hard for me to nail down. My favorites change and are constantly evolving. If you see me in person, ask me. I can’t promise that they will stay the same, though!\n\nWhat are you reading right now/ what was the last book you read? Are you participating in any reading challenges?\n\nRight now, I’m revisiting Henry David Theoreu’s Walden Pond. We’re planning to visit the New England area in a couple of weeks and the setting for the book is on my bucket list for places to visit. I’m not participating in any reading challenges this year, but last year I set a goal to listen to an audiobook a week. I was able to finish 53 last year.\n\nWhere is your hometown? Were you born and raised in the same place?\n\nMy hometown is currently Mukilteo, WA.\n\nWhat do you like to do on your days off?\n\nIt seems like I’m always working on my house. We typically do a few larger projects to our place each year, and I’m pretty handy, so I do a lot of it myself. Whenever I can, I like to take my little family on an adventure, and we always mix it up to reflect our different interests.\n\nDo you have a favorite quote/ piece of advice?\n\nAnyone can lead, but leading is best when shared.\n\nWhat is your title at EvCC, and what will you be doing in your day-to-day endeavors at the College?\n\nMy title here at EvCC is Program Assistant. I will be working in the Testing Center helping to manage student intake and workflow.\n\nTell us a little about your professional background.\n\nI have worked as a receptionist for the past 10 years. For the last 4 years I have been in higher education starting with WSU over at the University Center. They helped me fall in love with helping students aim for success.\n\nWhat was your most memorable job? Why?\n\nMy most memorable job was working at Filene’s. Does anybody remember this place? It was the dream job at 19. Working and shopping at the same time, it could not get any better! It’s where I learned how to dress for success.\n\nWhat is your favorite meal/ snack in summer? Favorite summer beverage?\n\nI love fresh food. Nothing like a quick stop into the farmers market on a nice summer day. I love to make a black bean and corn salad. Recipe: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/13933/black-bean-and-corn-salad-ii/\n\nMy favorite summer beverage is the lemonade from Wendy’s. Mix it with some soda water and a handful of frozen fruit, and you’ve got yourself a beach ready drink!\n\nTell us three things most people don’t know about you.\n\nI have an unhealthy obsession with crime shows.\n\nI just had a beautiful baby boy named Zachary, and I have a 9-year-old named Harmoni.\n\nThat’s all I have; I’m not very interesting!\n\nWhat is your favorite book? Favorite movie? What makes these choices your favorites?\n\nMy favorite movie is The Lion King. I mean, the message of this movie is awesome, and it’s a cult classic that your kids, grandkids and great-grandkids can watch. Hakuna Matata!\n\nWhat are you reading right now/ what was the last book you read? Are you participating in any reading challenges?\n\nThe only thing I am reading right now is textbooks. I am currently attending classes to earn my Associate’s Degree in administrative support.\n\nWhere is your hometown? Were you born and raised in the same place?\n\nMy current town is Everett. I have kind of been all over the place, but I was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas.\n\nPlaces I love:\n\nOssipee, New Hampshire\n\nAnywhere in the Mount Baker Snoqualmie National Forest\n\nHave not been to Mt. Rainer, but I’m sure I will love that too\n\nI love the mountains and woods\n\nWhat do you like to do on your days off?\n\nI love to travel. So getting out and finding good hole-in-the-wall diners in small towns is my go-to thing right now.\n\nDo you have a favorite quote/ piece of advice?\n\nA minor setback only makes room for a major comeback.\n\n-Unkown\n\nWhat is your title at EvCC, and what will you be doing in your day-to-day endeavors at the College?\n\nAssociate Director, Center of Excellence of Semiconductors and Electronic Manufacturing.

I collect oil paintings and old comics.\n\nWhat is your favorite book? Favorite movie?

Why?\n\nMy most recent position was working with seniors and I really enjoyed working with this population because of how under-served they are. I enjoyed getting to know individuals, assisting them with maintaining their independence, and navigating systems. I loved hearing their “words of advice,” as they have so much knowledge and many life experiences to share.\n\nWhat is your favorite meal/ snack in summer? Favorite summer beverage?\n\nI love tacos!

Favorite movie? What makes these choices your favorites?\n\nBook: Night by Elie Weisel. This was the first book I read about the Holocaust when studying it in High School and it was such an eye-opener to me at young age. Movie: The Wizard of Oz.

Are you participating in any reading challenges?\n\nI just had a baby (ok, maybe not just– she’s 6 months old this week), but I haven’t read anything in a while. I think the last book I read was a parenting book about communicating with your child (I also have a 4-year-old).\n\nWhere is your hometown?

I was raised there and graduated from Stanwood HS.\n\nWhat do you like to do on your days off?\n\nSpend time with my family: my husband Ryan, 4-year-old daughter Norah, and 6-month-old daughter, Vivian, read books, watch movies (neither of which I do much of), go to the beach and bake.\n\nDo you have a favorite quote/ piece of advice?\n\n“My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.” – Maya Angelou\n\nWhat is your title at EvCC, and what will you be doing in your day-to-day endeavors at the College?\n\nPresident. My job is to ensure that every person at the College has the tools they need to succeed.\n\nTell us a little about your professional background.\n\nI started in higher education as an adjunct professor teaching history at Florida A&M University and Tallahassee Community College. While working on my graduate degrees, I also worked at the Museum of Florida History and the John G. Riley Center for African American History and Culture. There was one point when I worked four jobs at one time to make a decent living. I relocated to Houston, Texas for a tenure track teaching position in 2010. Shortly thereafter, I became a department chair, faculty senate president, and dean of instruction. In 2016, I moved to Syracuse, New York to serve as Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs at Onondaga Community College until June 2019. In essence, I have lived in Georgia, Florida, Texas, New York, and now Washington.\n\nWhat was your most memorable job? Why?\n\nI LOVED working at Victoria’s Secret in college. I especially enjoyed the exclusive employee discounts on merchandise! Most importantly, I appreciated the opportunity to help women and transgender individuals feel beautiful and more confident in themselves regardless of their shape and size.\n\nDo you recall having an embarrassing moment at work?\n\nIt was my first year working in Syracuse, New York. There was a snow storm the night before and the college opened the next day. As I was walking into the building without snow boots, I slipped and fell on a patch of ice in front of my peers. Talk about embarrassing!\n\nWhat does a typical day look like for you?\n\nI usually get started around 5:30 in the morning. After reading my daily devotional, checking my different social media pages, and reviewing emails and text messages on my phone, I ride my Peloton bike for twenty to thirty minutes while the house is quiet. I rarely eat a large breakfast in the morning, so I will have one of my husband’s famous blueberry smoothies and I am out the door headed to campus no later than 7:00. When I make it to the office, I like to have a little moment to get the blood flowing by turning on Spotify. I typically listen to Jazz, Hip-Hop, R&B, or Gospel music. It really depends on my mood. At that point the day begins. Over the years I have learned the importance of expecting the unexpected. Anything can change my schedule and I try to stay mentally prepared for the unexpected. At the end of the day when I make it home, I focus on my family. I’ve got three little ones and they all need a different level of attention. Once the kids are sleeping, I binge watch TV shows with my husband, say my prayers, and I go to sleep to get ready to start the cycle again.\n\nDescribe yourself at 10 years old.\n\nVery bossy. Ask my older brother.\n\nIf Hollywood made a movie about your life, who would you like to see cast as you?\n\nSanaa Lathan—although I cut my hair first.\n\nWhat is your favorite meal/ snack in summer?\n\nGrilled Salmon and Asparagus\n\nFavorite summer beverage?\n\nCucumber infused water with ice\n\nWhat would be the title of your autobiography?\n\nI’m Coming After Everything They Said I Couldn’t Have\n\nTell us three things most people don’t know about you.\n\nI have 6 tattoos\n\nI played 4 instruments in high school\n\nI hate chocolate cake\n\nWhat is a defining moment in your life?\n\nMy father died when I was six years old, leaving my mother to raise two children alone. It was terrible and a hard pill to swallow. I realized that life is promised to no one. I live each day as if it were my last. He is my Guardian Angel.\n\nWhat children’s character can you relate most with? Why?\n\nI was a huge fan of A Different World. I even believed Hillman College was a real school. That show was so important to my growth as a young adult. It was because of A Different World that I chose to attend a Historically Black College and University after high school. Freddie Brooks was one of my favorite characters because of her free spirit. She defined her own path. I’d like to think I am doing the same.\n\nWhat is your favorite book? Favorite movie? What makes these choices your favorites?\n\nBook—Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement by Barbara Hansberry\n\nMovie—Coming to America with Eddie Murphy\n\nI fell in love with Ella Baker in graduate school. She was a radical visionary that did not take no for an answer. Mrs. Baker loved her people and she was a pioneer in the Civil Rights Movement, often telling the men of the movement to make room for women leaders. It is our time.\n\nI have always been a fan of Eddie Murphy. Coming to America is my absolute favorite movie. I know it word for word. It is probably the song “Soul Glow” that has me addicted!\n\nWhat are you reading right now/ what was the last book you read? Are you participating in any reading challenges?\n\nI am reading Presidential Transitions from the ACE Series on Higher Education. No reading challenges at this time.\n\nWhat do you like most about your job?\n\nI love having the ability to make a positive difference on thousands of lives each and every day by the stroke of a pen.\n\nWhere is your hometown? Were you born and raised in the same place?\n\nI am a Georgia Peach. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia until I turned 17.\n\nBest memory of your childhood?\n\nMy mother took me to the Cabbage Patch Hospital for my birthday. Understand, this is when Cabbage Patch dolls were popular. I was able to watch my doll being born out of an actual cabbage. I named her Elizabeth, received her birth certificate, and purchased all of her newborn essentials in the hospital gift shop. It was a real treat!\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 5 years?\n\nRight here at Everett Community College\n\nWhat do you like to do on your days off?\n\nSleep\n\nDo you have a favorite quote/ piece of advice?\n\n“If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have taken the side of the oppressor.” Desmond Tutu"
