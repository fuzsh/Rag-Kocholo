        "text": "We have saved a lot of money over the years.\n\nWhen we switched to Leavitt Group Northwest, they found us the best rates, which were considerably less than our previous insurance. At this time, Safeco is insuring our house, cars, and boat which gives us a greater discount. Melissa Minnihan is our agent and she has been great!\n\nWorking with Melissa and the Leavitt Group has been working harmony over the last few years.\n\nMy family has gone through both vandalism and an arson fire at our house that was under construction. Upon completion, we required several specialty clauses to get the proper coverage for our unique home. This required a great deal of time and effort on Melissa's part. As always, everything was completed and the proper insurance was obtained without a glitch. We have several properties insured through the Leavitt Group, and we've never had a problem getting a quick response or resolution to any of our questions or needs. Through it all, the recommendations of the Leavitt Group to the Miller family have been spot on, and we are now in our beautiful new home with all the insurance coverage that we will ever need."
