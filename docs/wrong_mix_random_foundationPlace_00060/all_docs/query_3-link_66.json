        "text": "The opening of the show was reminiscent of an old HBO drama in the 80’s called THE HITCHHIKER. (It’s listed as DEADLY NIGHTMARES in IMDB, even though it was never called that and actually featured a guy seen hitch-hiking.) The narrator figure, the hitch-hiker, would appear at the beginning of the show and do a short narration, and then would vanish until the end where he gives a closing comment. Michael Phillip has the same sort of duties here. One problem is that his opening monologue apparently also gives away plot points before the story even starts. That’s not okay in my book; I’ll have to kind of ignore the details in future episodes, although he didn’t do anything to really spoil this episode.\n\nThe story starts in a dystopian future. I hope not all the episodes are in the same general framework. As an anthology, I hope the places and premises are all different. Maybe they all have future technology as a common thread, but I can deal with that. This story has a strange premise. Advertising has been outlawed in the future. The excuse is that all the billboards and such cluttered up the landscape so they were prohibited. Additionally, there is talk of fairness – that how can one place really become known through advertising when everybody is advertising all at once? So what do they do here? They have a group of elite characters who go from glamour spot to glamour spot wearing designer clothing and highlighting certain products that then everybody rushes out to buy. But who decides what places and clothing gets highlighted? Why, some members of the elite corps, of course. One of their members even mentions that the whole system is built on nothing and all they are really doing is trying to keep it from collapsing on them. I’ll take a bunch of commercials over that kind of nonsense any day. That’s the fight we’re having right now in my country. People like me voted for Trump because the other party’s candidates were members of the elite who wanted to tell us what to do with our lives because they think we know better than us. Even now, they’re trying to tell us we chose wrongly and are doing everything they can to sabotage the current President. So far, thankfully, it isn’t working. But I digress.\n\nThe elite corps in this story is looking for a new character, but wants one with real emotion that the audience can relate to. They find a poor, sickly girl named P. Burke who longs to be with the elite club as so many do. They see her emotions and want to harness them. After she tries suicide, they rescue her and promise to help make her dreams come true. They hook her into a fancy device which allows her to control some kind of artificial being whom they’ve dubbed “Delphi B.” She looks similar but is like a glamorized version of Burke. (They are played by two different actresses as well.) It’s not clear exactly what Delphi is. She looks perfectly human and seems to be able to react in human fashion to things like sex. She emerges from a pool in mummy/gauze type wrappings which are peeled away. But is she a clone or some sort or a fancy android? It’s never made clear that I could tell.\n\nBy being plugged into the sensory chair, Burke is able to control the movements and speech of Delphi. When she’s plugged in, she can experience what Delphi is doing in a virtual reality type way. They take her out of the chair at night so that she can sleep; otherwise, she would just wear herself down to nothing. But Burke becomes addicted to being Delphi and eventually doesn’t want to sleep, eat or do anything else except be Delphi. To complicate matters more, she is an honest person. When she is made to wear a dress that gives her a rash, or take pills that make her sick afterword, she refuses to endorse such products because she doesn’t want other people to become sick or get rashes. The elites try to punish this behavior by giving her shocks from a pain sensor, versus rewards from a pleasure sensor that she gets if she behaves.\n\nAnother ingredient in the mix is a protester. I don’t remember his name; I’m going to guess it was Paul. He is the son of some bigwig who likes to get himself arrested so he can protest the current dismal state the world is in. The elite give him his own broadcast hoping people will quickly tire of him and forget he exists. But he surprises them with stunts like short circuiting people’s experience while wearing virtual reality glasses. (The scene was reminiscent of the youth crowd in CAPRICA who loved to wear the VR glasses and do wild and crazy things they normally could not do.)\n\nPaul gets involved with Delphi and when they start zapping her pain sensors to punish her, he takes her to the lab to get them to remove the sensors. They try to explain to him that they can’t just remove the sensors. It is then that Burke emerges from her chair desperately reaching out to try to become the woman she has come to idolize. She collapses and dies but comes back to life inside Delphi. But it’s not a happy ending. Apparently Delphi isn’t a real entity and she can’t survive inside her. It’s like wanting to be an avatar in your favorite video game. If you became that avatar, you wouldn’t have any real existence. An avatar isn’t a human being. And so, Delphi quickly joins Burke in death. Be careful what you wish for; you might just get it.\n\nThis is my interpretation of what I saw. Others may see it differently. At the end, I thought I saw Burke moving a little while collapsed on the floor, but I think that was an unintentional error. It’s a strange, strange world that they create here.\n\nThough Nicolle Tom has the starring role as Delphi, it is Megan Leitch who delivers the real powerhouse performance of the show. In the final scene where she slowly stumbles toward Delphi desperately wanting to become her, you can read the desire and longing on her face. By comparison, Delphi herself never seems anywhere as real as Burke is although I think that’s the whole point. One scene in which she tells another person she has to leave came off as phony, and I was so relieved to hear a director yell “cut.” The scene had been real enough to be a person doing movie acting (which she was doing), but not real enough to look genuine. That’s why it’s hard to play a bad actor (or actress). It’s easy enough to look bad when you’re doing an acting scene, but then you have to look genuine when you’re pretending to be the actor/actress when they’re not acting.\n\nI would give the episode a 6, but because of Megan Leitch’s performance in her final scene I’m upping it to 7 fancy water-based resort hot spots that some elitists determined was worth using Delphi B to advertise.\n\nBy the way, I see this was listed as episode 5 on IMDB. Was there a particular reason we did this one first? Was it the first one filmed, maybe? Since it's an anthology, it's no big deal. I was just curious.\n\nHere's my review, point by point.\n\nThe episode takes place in Betaville:\n\nThis may feel a little unusual now, as stories usually tend to be more grounded, taking place in real cities, but back in the day it was common to set stories in a fictional country or city. This avoids some problems such as, \"How could this happen in the United States one day?\" and \"But that's against the law\" or even \"What year is this happening in?\"\n\nBetaville is a place of its own, and the name is clearly inspired in the French movie \"Alphaville, une étrange aventure de Lemmy Caution\" in which a futuristic city/state named Alphaville is almost an oppressive character itself.\n\nIt's funny how the writers had no idea that in 2018 the term \"beta,\" or \"beta male\" would be the inspiration for so many memes and jokes with totally unintended meanings. And it's ironic that so many men in this episode with all their heavy makeup and affected mannerisms would fit the description of \"betas\" (and I bet soy must be a very popular food in Betaville).\n\nThere is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are controlling transmission. You open this door with the key of imagination...\n\nAll right. Clearly a Twilight Zone wannabe, but The Outer Limits is a strong influence too considering the show's exclusive focus on technology. But now in 2018, we have an unexpected bonus, because actually a direct comparison with Black Mirror has become much more relevant. How did writers predict things to come before the age of smart phones, a highly developed Internet or social media?\n\nAdvertising has been outlawed:\n\nSimply put, this is ridiculous. Why would a seemingly capitalist society outlaw advertising? That was a gimmick the author used just to justify his plot premise. That would be forcing things, but perhaps we could guess that advertising had become so aggressive and intrusive that a more moralist congress would've decided to ban and outlaw advertising completely.\n\nHowever, what would really make sense would be traditional advertising being banned not by the law of legislators, but the law of the market. We already know that traditional advertising and traditional media as a whole don't have the same influence they used to have, and alternative sources of advertising are proving to be more effective.\n\nWell, at least the show seems to predict the rise of media influencers like YouTubers and Instagram models who do a lot of advertising. But the premise that influencers alone would suffice to advertise goods is limited; many customers want to understand rationally the advantages of a certain product, and not use it just because PewDiePie uses it.\n\nDid I mention the word \"author\"?\n\nThe short story was written by James Tiptree Jr in the 1940s so this explain why so much of the concept sounds dated. I had already heard of this author before and have heard good things about him.\n\nFashion!\n\nThe show presents lots of \"futuristic\" fashion we're not likely to ever see in real life. But it does seem consistent and weird enough to be from another time and place.\n\nDiversity and inclusion!\n\nThe show was made at a time the media was not yet obsessed with skin color + sexual orientation diversity. In the story, the two main character are White (blonde, in fact) and straight. Now if you take shows like Black Mirror or Electric Dreams in consideration, we're much more likely to meet characters like a small but strong and tough Black woman or an outspoken Lesbian Latina. But hey, I was really surprised to find out James, the author, was actually a woman. Now, that makes a lot of sense, come to think of it.\n\nThe cast:\n\nI'm not so sure what they found so special about the \"P. Burke\" character, but it would make sense if they chose someone with no hopes and no connections for their little marketing experiment. Honestly, she's not bad looking at all, so it doesn't become clear why one blonde is such a mess and the other is \"so perfect.\" OK, Delphi is played by a younger actress and a very pretty one, but I would'be preferred in Burke were older and uglier.\n\nPhotography and direction:\n\nThe scene in which Burke lies alone in a bed in a big room with sheets for walls and Brennan Elliot's character approaches has a very weird and effective feel that drives the concept of the how quite well. By the way, you may recognize Elliot as Graham, the TV host of Everlasting, the fictitious TV show in the real TV show UnReal.\n\nStrange locations:\n\nThis show picks some strange locations as sets. In this case, the GTX Neuro Lab looks like a kind of power or industrial plant in the middle of a quarry.\n\nFaust meets backwards Pinocchio\n\nLike Faust, the protagonist of the classic tale, Burke makes a deal with the devil and pays for it with her life. And unlike Pinocchio, Burke is a real girl who wants to become an artificially made doll.\n\nPlagiarism?\n\nDid James Cameron copy the concept for his Avatar movie? I know he supposedly had the idea over ten years before the movie is made, but the short story is even older than that.\n\nAn uncomfortable position\n\nHere's something I don't get. Burke seems to be standing propped against a vertical board and pretty conscious while she moves the doll with her mind, but later she seems unconscious. That seems pretty uncomfortable and if she can see her surroundings, she would not be abler to \"get lost\" in her character. And staying immobile for hours would be agonizing. After the first eight-hour session as Delphi she would want to run away for fresh air and not come back ever again. I think that issue is covered much more realistic in Surrogates, which I highly recommend.\n\nCorporations are evil:\n\nSci-fi Canadian sows love this theme. Shows like Incorporated and Continuum have, well, continued this tradition.\n\nEnter the Beetle\n\nAh, the New Beetle. What a sensation it was back in 98. How futuristic that car looked! It was beyond the show's budget to build a new futuristic car from scratch, or even adapt an existing vehicle as they cleverly did in UFO, so the next best thing was product placement! Which is very ironic in a story in which advertising has been outlawed, but I guess even in Betaville product placement was still a thing.\n\nTunnel system:\n\nWe also get to know Betaville's unusual solution for traffic: underground tunnels. Basically cars travel in pneumatic tubes! All nice and dandy in theory, but in practice imagine how hellish a traffic jam would be inside one of those claustrophobic tunnels.\n\nBackwards Pinoccio?\n\nIn the end, Burke gets to live her dream: she becomes Delphi... and dies. OK, I'm glad she did die, because if she had lived and she had reached a happy ending that would have felt forced and contrived. And I can't believe James Cameron stole even that part and used it in the demise of Sigourney Weaver's character.\n\nGrade:\n\nI'll withhold my grade for the first 4 or 5 episodes so I can properly grade each in a better understood context. But I'd say this was an average-to-low episode. The show can do better.\n\nThis episode gets 7 itchy dresses no honorable celebrities would dare use as product placement."
