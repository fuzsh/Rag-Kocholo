        "text": "Kerr Smith started acting on Dawson's Creek in the second season, when he and Meredith Monroe joined the cast as brother-sister teens Jack and Andie McPhee.\n\nOne of his character's story lines was to play a love interest to Katie Holmes' Joey Potter. But that's not the way it stayed.\n\nSoon, the creator of the show, Kevin Williamson, had other ideas for Jack.\n\n\"He's the guy who came into the show not knowing where his character would go,\" said Greg Prange, an executive producer for Dawson's Creek.\n\nMr. Williamson said that all of the characters of Dawson's Creek are a little like himself. But he used Mr. Smith's character to tell a more personal side of his story. Soon, Jack was telling his friends that he was gay.\n\n\"Kevin sprung that on him after the game had already started,\" Mr. Prange said. \"I'm really proud of him for that.\"\n\nAnd it did take Mr. Smith a while to decide if he wanted to participate in that story line.\n\n\"At the time, introducing a gay character to a teen audience ... It was never done, it was a scary experience,\" Mr. Smith said.\n\nAnd, for a while, there was some controversy surrounding the decision. There were demonstrators in Wilmington protesting the \"coming out\" episode.\n\n\"As it turned out, it was a great experience,\" Mr. Smith said. \"And I think it helped a lot of people going through the same experience. We helped change the world's attitude.\"\n\nWhile filming the last episode, Mr. Smith said that he was happy that Mr. Williamson was back to write the script, and he was pleased with how it turned out.\n\n\"I just wanted to know Jack was comfortable with himself,\" he said. \"He's had so much turmoil over the last six years.\"\n\nThose trials and tribulations have included an unforgiving father, lost love, self-doubt and a failed fraternity experiment.\n\nNow that the turmoil - and the show - has come to an end, Mr. Smith plans to move to Los Angeles and marry actress Harmoni Everett.\n\nAnd, although, he did try his hand directing an episode of Dawson's Creek this season, he says he wants to focus on acting.\n\nIn the past, he's had roles in films such as The Forsaken and Final Destination.\n\n\"The advantage of being on a hit show is that people get to know you,\" he said. \"You can't put a price tag on how much you learn being on a hit show.\"\n\nAfter a while, he even got used to the fans. But there's more to acting than the good points.\n\n\"The only thing people see is the glamorous stuff,\" Mr. Smith said. \"But it's not glamorous at all. It's just a job.\"\n\nThose who have worked with Mr. Smith see more jobs ahead for him.\n\n\"Kerr is a very deep actor and very, very good,\" Mr. Prange said. \"We haven't given him enough to do on this show, really. I think people will be amazed at what he will do in the future.\"\n\nMr. Smith is ready to get back to Hollywood to pursue some of those opportunities. But there are some things he'll miss about Wilmington.\n\n\"Some of my most memorable times were those weekends at Dockside on Saturdays and Sundays, getting a boat and going to Masonboro island, getting drunk all day….\"\n\n\"The downside is shooting in Wilmington,\" he said. \"I like Wilmington; we had a great crew. But hopping on a plane if you want to do something else is difficult.\"\n\nAllison Ballard: 343-2376\n\nallison.ballard@wilmingtonstar.com"
