Sadly I missed it with flying duties at the Palm Springs Air Museum. However I have been doing my own art installations at Bombay Beach and around the Salton Sea for a number of years.\n\nBombay Beach boating fashion with model Xtine. Eco-friendly, everything we packed in we packed out. And we walked away with our Art created with a camera. The Art created by Xtine, myself, a Hasselblad digital camera system and Broncolor lighting.\n\nMany installations of the Bombay Beach Biennale 2018, such as the the Opera House, The Hermitage Museum, Drive-In Theater, The Institute, Angler Grove, and Nine, have become permanent gifts to the town. I will certainly be going back out to take a look. Go visit and also remember that the Salton Sea is one of the most environmentally important places in the country and must be protected.

Yesterday I shared a behind the scenes video of her posing here at this spot. This is one of the photos from that “take”.\n\nThe Sun was intense and almost directly behind her. My lighting was a Broncolor white beauty dish held by my assistant pointed 45 degrees to her from her right. It was powered by the Broncolor 1200L Move pack. I like the beauty dish out there to withstand the winds and for the power.\n\nThe camera is my Hasselblad H4D-40 with the Hasselblad HC 100mm f/2.2 lens. Without question my favorite Hasselblad lens.\n\nHere is the link to the behind the scenes posing video here on my Blog… https://wp.me/pH8pO-2Hn\n\nDecember 4, 2017 | Categories: Uncategorized | Tags: ad photography, advertising photography, Bombay Beach, famousbtsmag, fashion editorial, fashion model, fashion photographer, Hasselblad, Hasselblad photographer, HasselbladBron, magazine photographer, Palm Springs photographer, Salton Sea, Salton Sea photo shoot | 4 Comments\n\nWindy Modeling\n\nSome more posing behind the scenes with model Xtine at Bombay Beach at the Salton Sea. The BTS video here was not lit. Sun directly behind her. Lighting the photo shoot was with a Broncolor white beauty dish held by my assistant with a Broncolor 1200L Move pack. I was using a Hasselblad digital camera system.\n\nNote the very windy conditions. I have seen photographers bring soft boxes and umbrellas out here for light modifiers and try to put them on light stands. Not a good plan. The wind just turns that stuff into kites.\n\nAnother point is having a model who can pose without being micro-managed. The model will not be able to hear you over the wind noise. So your discussion of posing will all be between “takes”.\n\nDecember 3, 2017 | Categories: Uncategorized | Tags: ad photography, advertising photographer, behind the scenes, Bombay Beach, Broncolor, editorial photographer, famousbtsmag, fashion editorial, fashion model, Hasselblad, HasselbladBron, magazine photographer, model photographer, model photography, model posing, model posing video, posing fun, Salton Sea, Salton Sea photo shoot | Leave a comment\n\nFirst A Great Model!\n\nThe first order of business… select a great model! Makes all the difference in the world. Gabriella Muttone is one of the absolute great models I have had in front of my cameras. An extraordinary photographer herself, she has a keen sense of body movement, facial expression and style. You can see in this photograph from our photo shoot at the Palm Springs Air Museum how she places herself so perfectly with this aircraft, engine and propeller. Just wonderful!\n\nPhoto shoot notes… Hasselblad digital camera system and Broncolor lightning. The aircraft is a beautiful Grumman F8F Bearcat. The design for this was done by my good friend and superb graphic design artist Dennis Johnson. Only the best!

It was in a studio near downtown Los Angeles at the Brewery Arts District which is very cool I must say. Had not been there in many years.\n\nSome of the really important details are the people I get to work with. Blanche LeBeau is a premier Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist working around the world with Estee Lauder. I cannot begin to tell you how lucky I am to have her enjoy shooting with me. This shoot was even more fun with her talent of body painting! Very Thankful for Blanche LeBeau!\n\nThen there is my newer buddy Harmoni Everett. Wow is she a find! Harmoni is best friends with another best friend of mine, a most gorgeous professional model, actress and beautiful woman. Harmoni has been a professional model, a successful actress and has worked in producing photo shoots. And is a wonderful photographer herself. She not only worked with me on this photo shoot as my assistant carrying and moving heavy stuff, but also wardrobe ideas and shooting behind the scenes photos. On top of all that we photographed Harmoni too and those photos are astonishing! She is wonderfully creative! You will see those photos soon.\n\nThen there is Nora and she is wonderful. Blanche introduced me to photos of Nora probably a year ago or more and I said then that I really was looking forward to photographing her. This is now our second photo shoot together and she is just perfection. Nora looks incredible in front of the camera, knows her stuff, easy and so very fun to work with. I adore this woman!\n\nIt is the people you work with who are so very very important! Now people always say it is the photographer and not the gear that makes great photographs. And that is certainly true. But for me I do not like to short change what I do or what I do for my clients. So I go with the best gear possible. It is just what I do.\n\nMy camera system for these types of shoots for me is Hasselblad. I have always admired Hasselblad cameras and the images they produce. And the history of Hasselblad creating the photographs, the most memorable in history including going into Outer Space and to the Moon. Only sorry I didn’t start with Hasselblad sooner in my shooting. Then there is my lighting gear, Broncolor. For any number of reasons moving up to Broncolor is like going from a great car to a Rolls Royce or Ferrari. There is just nothing else like it.\n\nI will not say that I am a great photographer but I can say I give it all I have got all the way around. So my results are quality, consistency and sometimes really great photographs. And I always try to make sure that everyone has fun doing it! That is my behind the scenes details on this and many of my photo shoots. Thanks!\n\nJune 14, 2017 | Categories: Uncategorized | Tags: advertising photographer, behind the scenes, body paint, Broncolor, BTS details, edgy fashion, famousbtsmag, fashion model, fashion photographer, Hasselbald, HasselbladBron, MUA, Palm Springs photographer, sexy photo shoot, studio photo shoot | Leave a comment\n\nHair Raising Behind The Scenes\n\nHarmoni Everett managed to get the almost exact moment when Nora Zainglein had her hair at the top of the her head swing and the strobe fired as I shot the photograph. Wow! That Nora a great model to work with and absolutely beautiful! I love her in front of the camera and she is fun to have around too!\n\nBehind the scenes with the very professional New York City fashion model Nora Zainglein.

Well that might have been a little stretch of imagination.\n\nI first met Nora Zainglein when I saw photos of her from my friend Blanche LeBeau who is the Makeup Artist extraordinaire with Estee Lauder. Blanche had met Nora in NYC and as we spoke I said I would love to shoot her. Blanche said she would love for me to shoot her too. That may have been as long as a year ago. Nora is indeed a fashion model who has worked with some very major fashion houses and beauty brands.\n\nThe time had come and Blanche brought me Nora make up and hair style ready. Blanche was on Estee Lauder business here in the Palm Springs area so I met them and Blanche entrusted her in my care. Off we went to the Salton Sea!\n\nFrom the beaches at the North Shore near the Yacht Club to Bombay Beach to the geothermal plants we had a ball shooting. I dare say it was a different world for a fashion model spending her time in Manhattan. I think she had fun, I sure did!\n\nNora is just nothing but beautiful and striking. She is endlessly fun, easy to work with, knows what she is doing, and indeed “a delightfully sarcastic deviant”. Love this girl!\n\nSo that is my confession! I hope you scroll through my Blog for more of my created intrigue with Nora along with the photos. Actually the happenings are true!\n\nWhat next with Nora? Well maybe some magazines with the photos we have shot. And she will be back in a few weeks and we are planning something really cool and I must say… well you will not want to miss it. Thanks!\n\nMay 20, 2017 | Categories: Uncategorized | Tags: Bombay Beach, edgy fashion, edgy model, fashion editorial, fashion model, fashion photographer, geothermal plant, Hasselblad, Hasselblad photographer, HasselbladBron, Manhattan model, New York City model, no pants, Salton Sea, Salton Sea photo shoot, Salton Sea Yacht Club, sexy geothermal plant, sexy salton Sea | Leave a comment\n\nHay!\n\nLast I told you about my impromptu (it’s all true, I promise) photo shoot with Nora around the Salton Sea and Bombay Beach. The feeling was sultry, I was pouring cold water over her and down through hair, and she was wearing more which was really less. On my Blog here to get you started.\n\nAnother oddity at Bombay Beach… a wall of hay convenient to the shore, of course! A recent addition for the Bombay Beach Biennale just past. What better place to lounge and take a break with Nora changing into something appropriate to lounge and take a break in. Well at least for a Manhattan fashion model laying around on hay. More of this tale to come.\n\nPhoto shoot notes… New York City Fashion Model Nora Zainglein. Estee Lauder featured Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Blanche LeBeau. Hasselblad digital camera system.

The woman I met when she was dancing around a pole on a deserted street at the Salton Sea.\n\nLast I told you we ended up at Bombay Beach. I have seen that sometimes the Salton Sea has kind of an effect on people. Maybe it is the eeriness of the place, the hot sun and the heavy salt water at 227 ft below sea level. Then there is the post-apocalyptic look of the place. Kind of a sensual oddity to it at times. I think Nora was getting into the mood of the place.\n\nNora had been doing wardrobe changes along the way and now she changed into more. But sometimes as you can see, more is less. Maybe it was the heat, it was hot, and getting hotter. Nora had me pour cold water in her hair and over her. I had bottles of water on ice in a big cooler I brought along. She said it felt really good. So I poured a few or more. I was still feeling the heat, but I liked it.\n\nPhoto shoot notes… Fashion model Nora Zainglein.
