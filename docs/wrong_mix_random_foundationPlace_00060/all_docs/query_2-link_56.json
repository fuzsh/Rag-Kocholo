        "text": "Raphael Lemus Solis\n\nEverett High School\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nBEST is one of the best programs I have been in. (See what I did there). Through the BEST program, I have discovered various resources at Tufts whenever I am in need. I chose Tufts mainly to get a fantastic education and gain resources to push me forward to get to where I want to end up. Thanks to BEST, I now have new friends, and academically prepared me for the fall semester.\n\nI enjoy listening to music while cleaning, playing games, and building at NoLop or Bray Lab.\n\nJordy Dorce\n\nDemocracy Prep Harlem High School\n\nEnvironmental Engineering\n\nMy last summer as a BESTie allowed for a smooth adjustment to life at Tufts. I was equipped with a vast amount of skills that I felt prepared me for a new setting that is college. I was prepared coming into the fall semester due to the opportunities I was given during the summer and know that I will continue to be prepared because of the support systems that are in place for best scholars through my experience at Tufts.\n\nI like video games, watching TV, and sports.\n\nMark Zheng\n\nLong Island City High School\n\nComputer Science\n\nI come from a high school in NYC called Long Island City High School. Although it has provided me with many opportunities those opportunities did not line up with what I wanted to do in life. For me BEST has been an opportunity unlike any other because it did just that; it provided me with opportunities that I was genuinely interested in and ones where I could feel the impact they had on my life. BEST has provided me with an introduction to college and Boston as a whole. BEST has made sure that I had a helping hand whenever I needed it in every aspect of my time here. Through this program, I’ve met wonderful staff, made wonderful friends, and met wonderful people that I know I can rely on. It has provided me with resources that allow me to do what I need to when I need to so that I feel confident every step of the way on this college journey. program, I’ve met wonderful staff, made wonderful friends, and met wonderful people that I know I can rely on. It has provided me with resources that allow me to do what I need to when I need to so that I feel confident every step of the way on this college journey.\n\nI enjoy doing a bit of everything, from playing video games to learning skills. I'm open to trying new things.\n\nAmanda Moore-Rinehart\n\nWaukegan High School\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nThe BEST program has and will continue to be a great opportunity. It has provided me with a network of people and a community that I know I can always rely on in my times of need. Through the summer program and the many events BEST has hosted I feel like a real part of the environment it fosters.\n\nI enjoy watching YouTube, reading, and working out.\n\nBreoghan Conchas Marquez\n\nEast Side School\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nThe BEST program has convinced me that Tufts was the right choice for me. This program allowed me all the opportunities I need to succeed in my college career. Over the summer, I was able to establish a friend group and support system of like-minded people, solidify my foundation in math before going into the next course, and get to know the campus as well as faculty. Now that I am at Tufts I hope to go hiking with Kalan.\n\nAnthony Caron\n\nDeltona High School\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nThe moment I got to Tufts I was welcomed by the BEST program directors. To say this program was pivotal for my success is an understatement. The Summer before my first year gave me an exclusive advantage as I was introduced to campus life, met a variety of professors, and made best friends. There was a place for me here, and I knew I would thrive. Whether I needed tutoring for a difficult class, advice for class/career selection, or simply someone to lend an ear, BEST has been there for me.\n\nI enjoy working out, reading books, outdoor activities and meeting new people in my free time.\n\nIris Guzman de Leon\n\nKIPP Academy Lynn Collegiate\n\nMechanical or Environmental Engineering\n\nBeing a part of BEST has helped me in more ways than I could’ve imagined. The BEST program introduced me to a trusting and reliable community who can aid me with whatever I need, even before the fall semester started. Knowing how to get around campus and knowing what resources are offered has helped me have a strong start to the semester. I’ll always be grateful to get the chance to be a part of this community.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities, drawing, and being around my friends and family.\n\nJeremiah Longino\n\nSouth Atlanta School of Computer Animation and Design\n\nComputer Science\n\nEver since choosing to participate in the BEST Program, I have been able to make meaningful connections through shared experiences of being low-income, first- generation college students. I have been able to interact, struggle, and triumph with a group of students for such a time to become a close community. I have made lifelong friends in this program. The upperclassmen support is also very helpful, as these scholars have been in my shoes at some point in their lives and are willing to support me whenever possible. Overall, the engineering and college support provided by the BEST Program has helped me with my transition to Tufts University, and has made my decision to join one of the best choices I have ever made.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading manga\n\nAriana Olivares\n\nStewarts Creek High School\n\nComputer Engineering\n\nA fun fact about me is that I am Peruvian! Being able to become a BESTie is one of the best opportunities I’ve ever received. It has provided me with a tool box of skills that will help me to be successful in college. I was able to meet wonderful people from all around the country that soon became some of my best friends. I learned so many valuable lessons from my peer leaders and cohort coordinator, for which I am so thankful. I chose Tufts because of the amazing staff and professors in the engineering department. The community here is so lively and it soon became my home away from home. I am forever thankful for this program and cannot recommend it enough.\n\nMacy Halim\n\nAgoura High School\n\nBiomedical Engineering\n\nAs a new BESTie this summer, I was given the opportunity to learn about the possible career fields and explore my curiosities in engineering through several workshops. I also had the opportunity to interact with my professors one-on-one and seek advice from older BESTies and peer mentors. The six-week accelerated program allowed me to develop meaningful friendships and adjust to the student lifestyle on the college campus, which definitely gave me an easier transition into Tufts. Some of my favorite social activities from the program were going to the aquarium, exploring Boston on the duck boat tour, solving puzzles in a series of escape rooms, and celebrating our culmination at Six Flags. Overall, I’m extremely grateful that I got the chance to participate in the BEST program and become a BESTie for life.\n\nOne fun fact about me is I’ve moved a total of eight times throughout Upstate New York and Southern California.\n\nPaul Galvan\n\nAnimo Inglewood Charter High School\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nHey, my name is Paul Galvan and I went to a charter school in Inglewood California called a Animo Inglewood Charter High School. Here at Tufts, I plan on majoring in mechanical engineering. My BEST experience was really fun as it included fun activities such as workshops, and even then, trips such as the Duck Boat and even Six Flags. I chose Tufts because I wanted to explore the East Coast and it had a great engineering program also being one of the few schools where a minor in Human Factor Engineering is available. One fun fact about me is I recently broke my collarbone and had surgery so getting back into sports and work and stuff like that, is going to be a new obstacle for me.\n\nAbdullahi Abdi\n\nCapital High School\n\nComputer Science\n\nMy experience as a BESTie was amazing. There were so many activities and events that we participated in, making everyday fun. Just to name a few, we went to the aquarium, duck boating tour, Six Flags, and more in just 6 weeks. We also got to experience what an incoming Student to Tuft would be like by taking college level classes, living in college dorms, and gaining an authentic feeling of what college life is.\n\nI chose Tufts because it has a remarkable and top-notch Engineering school, and in the summer when I was doing the BEST program, I got to see that. For example, Bray’s workshop with its top notch and state of the art 3D laser printers and exceptional engineering software. After the first day of the workshop, I knew I was in the right school.\n\nA fact about me is that I consider myself a comedian able to get the whole crowd laughing at my jokes.\n\nDenise Winkfield\n\nKenwood Academy High School\n\nUndecided - Engineering\n\nIn my experience as a BESTie, I felt as though I was given granted wonderful opportunities to grow in college. I met amazing people that have become essential pieces to my support system, while experiencing wonderful outings where I bonded with the people in my cohort. The BEST Program really helped me to know more about engineering and all that is offered. I chose Tufts because of the opportunity and great experience I will soon get.\n\nMy favorite fruit to eat is grapes.\n\nJose Rodriguez\n\nStuttgart High School\n\nBiomedical Engineering\n\nHola! My name is Jose Armando and I am from Stuttgart High School in Arkansas. I am interested in studying biomedical engineering in Tufts University. My experience as a BESTie was about collaboration, not only in we did together as a cohort, from helping each other to build a better future, but also also collaborating as an individual. Tufts is about reasoning, with reasoning, comes with truth, and what is what makes Tufts stand out.\n\nDid you know that I have 7 siblings, who I love so much!\n\nJudelee Noel\n\nMelrose High School\n\nElectrical Engineering\n\nI only have fond memories from BEST. As a BESTie I was introduced early on to the Tufts community and to the programs/resources set aside to help students like me thrive. I chose Tufts mainly because of the resources they were able to give to me compared to other schools I applied to. Tufts provided me with the best number of resources and needs that would help me best in the long run. Thanks to BEST I cannot wait to start and continue my education at Tufts because it truly is a great school and has such a welcoming community.\n\nA fun fact about me is that I was born in a different country and moved to the United States when I was 2 years old.\n\nJulia Rivera\n\nWorcester Technical High School\n\nBiomedical Engineering\n\nI really enjoyed participating in the BEST program. I met some really amazing people that have become an important part of my life. I can now go into the academic year knowing a group of people that I now consider as my close friends. I believe that the BEST program challenged me academically and socially. However, it has prepared me for this upcoming semester in the fall. Over the past six weeks, I had a lot of fun and it was an amazing experience.\n\nI work at Marathon Sports, so if you ever need to buy running shoes and don’t know where to start, then I can be of assistance.\n\nJordan Abreu\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPerth Amboy High School\n\nChemical Engineering\n\nAlChE, SOLES, ESC\n\nI have decided to join these clubs because of my passion for chemical engineering and my pursuit to be a leader. As for SOLES I still want to be connected to my culture. As for being a BESTie the experiences, I have with them will never be forgotten. Though everything was virtual we really became a big family, staying up doing homework together and talking about mundane topics and just talking about the next big thing. Within six weeks the other BESTies really became a support system that I knew I could rely on no matter what. The BEST program alone has prepared me for the college workload and how to prevent burnout and mental strain.\n\nRicardo (Cardi) Garcia Mendez\n\nTexas\n\nMickey Leland College Prep\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nRobotics, SOLES, Boxers on a Hill, Anime Club\n\nI applied to Tufts in the hopes of finding a community that accepted me for who I am. Since I first stepped on campus I felt the sense of community Tufts is known for. I feel welcomed and part of something greater than me, part of a community that is interested in my well being and growth and that cares about me as an Individual. BEST is a closer look at how much Tufts cares about communities, resources and support for students like me.\n\nRoberto Gonzalez Cabrera\n\nCalifornia\n\nEast Palo Alto Academy\n\nChemical Engineering\n\nCycling Club, Tufts Bikes, SALAS, SOLES, LATINX\n\nCommitting to Tufts not yet visiting the campus, state, or environment, I took a leap of faith. I knew Tufts had the best support out there for first-generation and people of color, the Bridge to Engineering Success at Tufts demonstrated the effort Tufts put into aiding people like me. I was able to take courses during the summer which prepared me for the fall and not to mention create a bond with students who had similar backgrounds like me. The BEST cohort 12 was not just my peers but a second family I could count on whenever I felt alone. I am glad to have taken that leap.\n\nJocasta Johnson\n\nMaryland\n\nJames Hubert Blake High School\n\nBiomedical Engineering\n\nThe Well, Tufts Buddhist Mindfulness Sangha Meditation, Intervarsity, The Indigenous Students’ Organization, Best Buddies, Society of Women Engineers\n\nI am excited to be a part of the Tufts School of Engineering because of the academic rigor, resources, and opportunities that are provided for minorities, low-income students, and first-generation students. I know there is a community of faculty I can lean on if I am feeling uncertain, so the Tufts environment gives me a great amount of confidence in my academic abilities as well as my overall future. I know with the opportunities available to me I will be able to thrive in my career path, even though my starting point may have had different obstacles than my peers! I am proud to be a Tufts Engineer.\n\nMigdalia Lopez Jimenez\n\nAlabama\n\nMontevallo High School, Shelby County Career Technical Education\n\nHuman Factors Engineering\n\nSociety of Latinx Engineers and Scientists (SOLES), Society of Women Engineers (SWE), QuestBridge Scholars Network (QSN), Tufts Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (THFES), Kickboxing on the Hill, and Engineering Student Council (ESC)\n\nBEST has gifted me the opportunity to meet passionate and intellectually curious students that I can comfortably call family now. The BEST community helped ease the transition to college with welcoming and understanding advisors and professors. Tufts specifically has granted me access to world of POC in STEM at the Center for STEM Diversity where we have met professionals, and explored the different fields of engineering. I cannot wait to see what the next four years hold for me and my BESTies.\n\nJesus Naranjo\n\nCalifornia\n\nWest High School\n\nComputer Science\n\nEngineers Without Borders, Fencing\n\nI liked the sense of making friends through the summer and simultaneously creating a support group that I can converse with about life-changing events even in a place where I am not comfortable with myself or my surroundings. Tufts is a place of community where you can have academic debates with anyone and converse with almost everyone. BEST summer supported me during the summer and beginning of college and gave me a picture of what type of institution I was committing myself to, making the uncertainty of the unknown go away.\n\nTaisha Pierre\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWaltham High School\n\nComputer Science (intended)\n\nCaribbean Students Organization, Black Student Union, National Society for Black Engineers (NSBE), Society of Latinx Engineers and Students (SOLES)\n\nThe BEST and FIRST Center community has quickly become like a family to me and they embraced the 12 of us with open arms. I'm overwhelmed with the amount of support that Tufts allowed us access to as students of color and FGLI in a community where we are the minority and feel the most alone. Although the BEST summer was a challenge, I would recommend people to join communities like these at Tufts.\n\nVictor Vazquez\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNew Heights Charter School of Brockton\n\nElectrical Engineering\n\nBoxers on the Hill, Encendido\n\nAs a wide-eyed Puerto Rican in a gigantic world, Victor loved to dream and not settle for less. He chose Tufts as a reach school and was elated to join the Tufts Community to learn and grow as a person. The fact that Tufts had a huge library system, and many socializing opportunities was only a plus. During the summer of 2021, Victor was given the opportunity to partake in the wonderful program BEST. It was during those 6 weeks of studying and perseverance that he found his BEST peers as a pillar of support. Victor had the pleasure of socializing with his Besties and gaining a small network before he even stepped on campus. Victor is incredibly excited for what comes next in this Tufts chapter of his life, he feels “blessed for these amazing opportunities, and awesome friends that I met in BEST”.\n\nMadanna Vue\n\nMinnesota\n\nHmong College Prep Academy\n\nBiomedical Engineering\n\nBiomedical Engineering Society, Engineering Student Council\n\nThe best program was a great opportunity to glean insight on the rigor and environment of a college student at Tufts. I’m extremely grateful for the experience and for the community I’ve created from the BEST summer. I love knowing that when I come on campus, I will have peers around me who I can count on. After being on campus, the same community from BEST was mirrored. Everyone is extremely friendly and open to meeting new people. Through my first week at Tufts and my BEST summer, I feel prepared to take on my engineering courses and am looking forward to the new opportunities ahead.\n\nZharia Akeem\n\nMichigan\n\nRenaissance High School\n\nBiomedical Engineering\n\nMARCH (Maternal Advocacy and Research for Community Health), MCH (Maternal and Child Health) Journal Club, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc.\n\nMy favorite thing about the BEST program, as well as Tufts in general, is how much fostering a community to collaborate and share with. Ever since I became a BESTie, I have always felt that I able to talk to another BESTie about how my day went, what’s bothering me, what I need help with and obviously about assignments in classes. Outside of BEST and inside of the classroom, we are always encouraged to work and brainstorm together, and it has honestly been such a great experience to learn how to work with other people and hear different ideas from people from many different backgrounds. I definitely value the communities and spaces that I have joined here at Tufts, and I look forward to still being a part of these communities even after I graduate.\n\nDennis Bazan\n\nTennessee\n\nOoltewah High School\n\nCivil Engineering Society of Latinx Engineers and Scientists (SOLES), Association of Latin American Students (ALAS), Tufts InterVarsity, STEM Ambassadors\n\nBeing a first-generation and low-income student, I knew it would be overwhelming and difficult to move to a new environment, especially during a pandemic. However, BEST provided me with a safe and supportive community with whom I share similar backgrounds and interests. I was able to meet beautiful people who soon became my friends and soon my family. This made the transition from being far away from my family less difficult when I arrived at Tufts. Through the BEST program, I was able to obtain access and reach to resources that I never thought would be possible; and therefore, I am grateful. This program did not only give me a safe space but also a family that I could trust.\n\nAngel Cruz Salvador\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham School of the Arts\n\nComputer Science\n\nSociety Of Latinx Engineers and Scientists (SOLES), Indigenous Student Organization at Tufts (ISOT), United For Immigrant Justice (UIJ), Association of Latin American Students (ALAS)\n\nWhenever I need help with homework, I can always rely on many BESTies for help. Over the summer when I was unable to come home, I was able to live with BESTies. Whenever I am at my lowest, I cry on the shoulders of my BESTies. BEST serves not only as an opportunity to continue the development of your collegiate experience and career. BEST also serves as the opportunity to laugh when days are miserable, to smile when life seems sad.\n\nManpreet Kaur\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCarteret High School\n\nComputer Science Women in Computer Science (WiCS), Tufts Tae Kwon Do (TKD), Society of Women Engineers (SWE), Sikh Students Association (SSA)\n\nManpreet was unsure about how her college experience would turn out, especially starting during a pandemic, but she was blown away by how welcoming and helpful the Tufts community was to her. The BEST program, especially, was the greatest resource that she had ever received from her Tufts acceptance. She was very thankful to have a community, get ahead with her academic goals in engineering, and plan out as much as she could to prepare for the years ahead. She truly could not have found a better support system than the one she made within BEST and at Tufts.\n\nAnneka Le\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHershey High School\n\nComputer Science\n\nVietnamese Students Club, Chinese Student Association, Tufts Burlesque Troupe\n\nBeing at Tufts and a part of BEST has really given me a second family, not just among my fellow BEST Scholars but also within the clubs I have joined and the friends that I have made. There are always people that I can turn to for support whether it be about academics, mental health, or just life advice. I know throughout my four years at Tufts, I will grow into my next stage in life with ease especially with the support that I have.\n\nBrianna Starling\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBurlington County Institute of Technology\n\nBiomedical Engineering\n\nBlack Student Union\n\nDuring the pandemic, Tufts and BEST had been a pillar in helping to keep on top of my academics. Through BEST summer, I was introduced to a group of people that have become a support system and helped to ease my transition into college. Now at Tufts, I feel more open to engaging with others and taking advantage of the wide opportunity of resources Tufts has to offer. In the future, I hope to continue in my efforts to be a helping hand within the community as well as furthering myself in my studies.\n\nJohn Waller\n\nNew York\n\nSuccess Academy High School of the Liberal Arts\n\nBiomedical Engineering on the Premed track\n\nBlack Student Union, Tufts S-Factor\n\nWhat I have loved most about Tufts so far is truly the people. There is something so refreshing about being able to interact and learn the stories of so many different people that come from different walks of life. What I love most about BEST is this immediate web of connections that you gain access to. Everyone is always willing to help assist and support you and it is like a family. There is something so comforting about being able to look to people who look just like you and have experienced similar things as you for a helping hand, especially at a PWI."
