OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION ON OCCUPATIONS FOR USE IN GUIDANCE BULLETIN NO. 1550 Revision of Bulletin 1450 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Willard Wirtz, Secretary BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS Arthur M. Ross, Commissioner 196S-69 Edition A Revised Edition of the Handbook Is Published Every 2 Years For sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office Washington, D.C. 20402 - Price $4.25 Foreword The major manpower challenge of this decade is to insure that our citizens receive the training and education they need to perform useful and rewarding work in our changing economy; that our education and training are geared to the needs of the individual as well as the needs of society. The Department of Labor’s Occupational Outlook Handbook, with its broad coverage of occupations and industries, seeks to define the various facets of the 20th Century world of work. In doing so, it serves as a basic tool for helping prospective workers to make intelligent decisions about the occupational course they will follow. W illard W irtz, Secretary of Labor Prefatory Note Recent legislation in the fields of manpower and education has heightened the demand for counseling services. Because only a limited number of counselors are available to meet this demand, occupational information has become more vital than ever as a tool in the guidance process. The 1968-69 edition of the Occupational Outlook Handbook continues the progress that has characterized the Bureau’s occupational outlook program for more than a quarter of a century. It includes more statements on occupations for which people having relatively low levels of skill and education may qualify. In addition, an introductory statement for each major industry group highlights occupational trends in the industry. The introduction, “Tomorrow’s Jobs,” has been completely revised to provide young people with a brief overview of the world of work and the economic and other factors that affect the choice of a career. The new Handbook includes many changes recommended by counselors and other readers; its for­ mat has been changed to make the volume easier to read. This Handbook—eighth in a series which began in 1949—provides counselors and others with the latest information about the employment outlook, earnings, training requirements, and related information for over 700 occupations. It also assesses the impact of future economic, social, and educational trends on the employment outlook in industries and occupations. The Handbook is used extensively in various Federal programs concerned with vocational counseling, such as those of the Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Employment Service, as well as in the State employment services. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also issues the Occupational Outlook Quarterly, a periodical which keeps readers informed of the latest developments between editions of the Handbook, and the Occupational Outlook Reprint Series, a set of over 100 reprints of the Handbook statements on different fields of work. Both of these publications offer assistance to young people seeking career information. Hundreds of officials in industry, labor organizations, trade organizations, professional societies, government agencies, educational institutions, and other organizations have cooperated with the Bureau of Labor Statistics in preparing the Handbook. Their assistance is acknowledged with gratitude. A rthur M. Ross, Commissioner of Labor Statistics Letter From the American Personnel and Guidance Association Each year the growth and development of the Nation’s economy bring many changes in employment outlook important to our youth. New occupations emerge. Old ones change in content and attractiveness. The outlook in both the old and the new may be affected markedly by such factors as the level of defense expenditures, automation and technological development, the birth rate, consumer expenditures, and other influencing factors. To keep abreast of the results of these changes, counselors and young persons need an authoritative, current source of information. The Occupational Outlook Handbook continues to provide, in its biennial edition, just the kind of sophisticated economic analysis counselors need. Each one should make sure they have the latest edition on hand. Guidance and counseling personnel are fortunate that the wide-ranging research activity of the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been put to such good use in compiling this compact, readable guidance encyclopedia and its companion periodical, the Occupational Outlook Quarterly. Another new edition continues our good fortune as we seek to aid each individual to find that type of work suited to his interest and aptitude. E. G. W illiamson , President American Personnel and Guidance Association Letter From the Veterans Administration The beneficiaries served by the Veterans Administration cover a broad spectrum, from the teenage war orphan who needs to plan his post-high school education to the severely disabled veteran requiring vocational rehabilitation. In the wide array of counseling and rehabilitation problems presented by this diverse group, one factor is common. All need to make their educational and vocational plans in the context of current, sound information about the rapidly changing occupational structure of the world of work they will enter. The Occupational Outlook Handbook, revised biennially, is a major source of such information. The Handbook, in its present form, is an outgrowth of a project originated to meet the needs for occupational information in the Veterans Administration counseling and training program for World War II veterans. Greatly expanded in aims, scope, and coverage, it has for many years provided a useful tool for counselors and those being counseled. The Veterans Administration looks forward to the Handbook’s continued usefulness and welcomes the publication of the 1968-69 edition. W. J. D river Administrator of Veterans Affairs Letter From Hie Bureau of Employment Security In 1966, more than 10.5 million individuals came to the public employment service for jobs. Many thousands of them also needed information about jobs—job content, job quali­ fications, earning potential, possibilities of advancement, and outlook for employment. This need is especially true of youth seeking work for the first time, of adults wishing to change vocations, and for senior citizens who have been displaced from their jobs. Counseling such individuals is a keystone in the work of the public employment service. Annually, over a million individuals benefit from job counseling. During these interviews, the Occupational Outlook Handbook is used to supplement the knowledge of the counselor and to satisfy more fully the jobseeker’s desire for information. The Bureau of Employment Security welcomes this new edition of the Occupational Outlook Handbook. Its improved, comprehensive format and expanded content will contribute immeasurably to the effectiveness of job counseling in the 2,000 local offices and 170 Youth Opportunity Centers which make up the employment service network. R obert C. G oodwin , Administrator Bureau of Employment Security US. Department of Labor Letter From the Vocational Rehabilitation Administration , The 154,000 handicapped people who were rehabilitated in our Federal-State program in 1966 went into almost every kind of employment there is. A number of blind people were trained as computer programers and got the jobs in that highly specialized work. Men and women with all kinds of physical and mental handicaps went to work as teachers, auditors, nurses, dentists, draftsmen, policemen, elevator operators, homemakers—the list is long. This year, there will be an even greater variety of jobs open to our program’s clients, as larger numbers of them are rehabilitated and as more and more employers learn that disabled people, like anybody else, have many abilities as workers. I know that your handbook of occupations is being used often by the vocational rehabilita­ tion counselors who are seeking and finding jobs for their clients all across the country. I know this new edition of valuable career information will be used even more frequently in our expanded effort to place disabled people in the most appropriate employment that can be found. M ary E. S witzer , Commissioner of Vocational Rehabilitation U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Letter From the United States Office of Education America has set a goal that is simple to state but intensely difficult to carry out: Each member of our society, we say, should have the opportunity to develop his talent and interests to the maximum for his own good and for the good of the country. Each year millions of young men and women begin earnest pursuit of this objective. They stand on the threshold of the job market, each qualified by ability and ambition, each intent on satisfaction and fulfillment in a career. Their choice is not a simple one: There are thousands of different ways in which a person can earn a living. In a massive pairing exercise, talent must be matched with opportunity, desire with need, individual with job. To the vocational counselor seeking to bring about the best solutions, there is one indis­ pensable reference, the Occupational Outlook Handbook, through its previous seven editions the basic work on occupational information. Compiling the eighth edition of this invaluable guide, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has managed to improve upon its excellent predecessors and produce an even finer compilation of job information. To the Bureau—and particularly to the Handbook staff—I would like to extend the congratulations and the thanks of the Office of Education. H arold H owe II, U.S. Commissioner of Education U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Letter From the Department of Defense Armed Forces counselors have been using the Occupational Outlook Handbook for many years. It is a primary source of occupational information used in guiding members of the Armed Forces with respect to their off-duty educational programs or in preparation for their return to civilian life. Servicemen have many opportunities to participate in off-duty educational programs throughout their military service; they are encouraged to pursue educational goals that will help their military careers and prepare them for future civilian careers. The Occupational Outlook Handbook has been tremendously useful to Armed Forces counselors in providing career information for both professional and citizen soldiers. On the basis of our experience with this valuable career guide, we commend it to all concerned with career planning. L ynn M. Bartlett, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Education Contributors The Handbook was prepared in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Division of Manpower and Occupational Out­ look, under the supervision of Howard V. Stambler and Sol Swerdloff. General direction was provided by Harold Goldstein, Assistant Commissioner for Manpower and Employment Statistics. The general planning and coordination of the Hand­ book was done under the direction of Morton Levine. Russell B. Flanders supervised the research underlying the occupational statements. The research and the preparation of the various chap­ ters were carried on under the direct supervision of Richard Dempsey, Melvin C. Fountain, David P. Lafayette, L. A. O’Donnell, Neal H. Rosenthal, Joe L. Russell, and Gerard C. Smith. Members of the Division staff who contributed sections were: Elinor W. Abramson, Annie B. Asensio, Delores F. Booker, William L. Brown, Max L.

Note A great many trade associations, professional societies, unions, and industrial organizations are in a position to supply valuable information to counselors or young people seeking informa­ tion about careers. For the convenience of Handbook users, the statements on separate occupa­ tions or industries list some of the organizations or other sources which may be able to provide further information. Although these references were assembled with care, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has no authority or facilities for investigating organizations. Also, since the Bureau has no way of knowing in advance what information or publications each organization may send in answer to a request, the Bureau cannot evaluate the accuracy of such information. The listing of an organization, therefore, does not in any way constitute an endorsement or recom­ mendation by the Bureau or the U.S. Department of Labor, either of the organization and its activities or of the information it may supply. Such information as each organization may issue is, of course, sent out on its own responsibility. The occupational statements in this Handbook are not intended, and should not be used, as standards for the determination of wages, hours, jurisdictional matters, appropriate bargain­ ing units, or formal job evaluation systems. These descriptive statements are presented in a general, composite form and, therefore, cannot be expected to apply exactly to specific jobs in a particular industry, establishment, or locality.

The more information and knowledge an individual possesses, the better his plans will be to achieve his role in the world of work, and the world of leisure. In recent years, knowledge has been multiplying at an ever increas­ ing rate. Consequently, most occupa­ tions which are affected by new knowledge— and what job is not?— will be subject to change. As work patterns change with the times, work­ er functions also will shift. The Occupational Outlook Hand­ book, now in its eighth edition, has become an invaluable tool in coun­ seling and placement programs. Over the years, as both the Handbook and guidance services have matured, they have become mutually dependent on each other. Surveys of counselors and other users of the Handbook indicate that it is the best single source of oc­ cupational information and is the publication most frequently used. The Handbook, like other source materials, is intended to provide the individual with information about oc­ cupations and to assist him with his career decisions. It is a bound volume of occupational briefs providing perti­ nent information concerning occupa­ tions in which over 75 percent of all workers in the United States are en­ gaged. Descriptions include the na­ ture of the job, location of employ­ ment, training and other qualifica­ tions required, employment outlook, earnings and working conditions, and where additional information may be obtained. The Handbook service includes: —Reprints of individual occupa­ tions which permit filing by oc­ cupation in each counselor’s of­ fice as well as in the library. —Supplementary charts illus­ trating occupational trends and guidance principles and con­ cepts. The Handbook is current. It is re­ vised every 2 years and permits the counselor and counselee to keep abreast of the rapid changes in the occupational structure. This is im­ portant since most authorities agree that all occupational materials more than 5 years old should be discarded. The Handbook is used in a variety of counseling and educational set­ tings : Junior and senior high schools, vocational and technical schools, jun­ ior and community colleges, counselor preparation programs, college student personnel centers, private and public placement and counseling agencies, and youth opportunity centers. Its primary contribution is in the field of career counseling and educa­ tional planning. Properly used, the Handbook can broaden the coun1 2 selee’s background of occupational information by revealing the impor­ tant factors influencing occupations; this will help him to develop desir­ able and satisfying plans for the fu­ ture. By carefully studying the Hand­ book, counselors, parents, and pupils can learn the many ways in which occupations are changing, growing, and declining, and the necessity for flexible planning in the choice of a major interest area. Helping individuals to achieve vo­ cational maturity is a very compli­ cated process. Many persons play important roles in such development, but key roles should be played by trained personnel in the helping pro­ fessions: Counselors, teachers, guid­ ance workers. The Handbook is a basic source for these people. One publication cannot appeal equally to all grade levels, reading levels, and levels of vocational ma­ turity. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has overcome many of the limitations common to the printed word by liberal use of graphics and pictures, and by simplifying the lan­ guage as much as possible. In school, students can receive group instruction in the use of the Handbook. They need to know what the Handbook can and cannot do for them. They need to know where the Handbook can be found. They need to know OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK that it supplements other sources of information, such as that derived from observational and exploratory work, experience, education, and dis­ cussions with employers and recent graduates who are engaged in occu­ pations in which students are inter­ ested. Since many occupations which will be important a decade hence have not yet evolved, a student having some years of preparation before him may be encouraged to elect a broad curriculum and perhaps identify a general area of interest, such as sci­ ence, social studies, or art. Specializa­ tion may be delayed until a later date. The further he goes in school, the better opportunity he will have to se­ lect his major field of interests. The more familiar he is with areas of work as described in the Handbook, the better prepared he will be to plan his own future as his education progresses. Counselors can use the Handbook and related materials not only with students but also with parents in help­ ing them counsel their children. The reprints are especially valuable be­ cause they may be borrowed easily for home reading. The local guidance worker should supplement the Handbook’s national occupational data with local com­ munity occupational and educational information. Use of the Handbook in individual and group counseling is important in helping the individual to perceive himself in the world of work. How­ ever, the Handbook should not be considered a substitute for individual exploration of vocational interests. The individual has the privilege of making his own decisions. He also has the privilege to seek and to ob­ tain reliable information. Schools and other local agencies will have to decide how much to budget for the occupational file. There are approximately 300 private and public sources of information. An agency can spend several hundred dollars a year purchasing materials re­ viewed by the career guidance serv­ ice of the National Vocational Guid­ ance Association and references con­ tained in bibliographies prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and several private publishers. Materials should be ranked on a priority basis depending upon the budget and other factors. Most agencies have found that the Occupational Outlook Hand­ book service, including the Reprint Series, has a very high priority. Harold J. Reed, Chief Occupational and Career Guidance Section Office of Education, U.S. Depart­ ment of Health, Education, and Welfare GUIDE TO THE HANDBOOK This book answers many questions young people ask when they are in­ terested in choosing an occupation. It provides many types of informa­ tion on occupations—the employ­ ment outlook in each field, the nature of the work, training and other quali­ fications needed for entry, lines of ad­ vancement, where jobs are located, and earnings and working conditions. HOW THE HANDBOOK IS ORGANIZED The Handbook starts with three introductory chapters designed to help counselors and students make effective use of the book and to give them a general view of the world of work. This chapter, the Guide to the Handbook, describes the contents and organization of the book. It tells how 262-057 0 — 68----- 2 the information was assembled and discusses a number of points which need to be kept in mind in interpret­ ing the statements. The second intro­ ductory chapter gives suggestions re­ garding supplementary sources of oc­ cupational information and tells how readers can keep up to date on devel­ opments affecting the employment outlook in different occupations. This introductory chapter also contains a brief description of the counseling, placement, and other services avail­ able to jobseekers at local offices of State employment services affiliated with the U.S. Employment Service. The final introductory chapter de­ scribes some of the most important trends in population and employment, both current and prospective, and provides a background for interpret­ ing the reports on particular occupations. Occupational Reports The reports on different fields of work make up the main body of the book. The seven major divisions of the book are: Professional and re­ lated occupations; managerial occu­ pations; clerical and related occupa­ tions, sales occupations, service occu­ pations, skilled and other manual oc­ cupations, and some major industries and their occupations. Within each of these major divisions, occupations are grouped into related fields. The introductory statement for each ma­ jor industry group provides occupa­ tional trends in the industry. Indexes and Appendix To help the readers locate infor­ mation on the occupations in which they are interested, a detailed list of the occupational reports, by field of 3 4 OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK work, is included in the table of con­ tents at the front of the book. The in­ dex at the back of the book lists occu­ pations and industries alphabetically. The technical appendix contains a discussion of the sources and methods used in analyzing the occupational outlook in different fields of work. It is designed for readers wishing more information on this subject than is in­ cluded in this chapter. The appendix also contains an explanation of the D.O.T. numbers given in the occupa­ tional reports, to indicate where each occupation fits into the classification system of the Dictionary of Occupa­ tional Titles. D.O.T. Numbers: The occupations covvered in the Occupational Outlook Hand­ book are organized according to the oc­ cupational classification system developed by the Bureau of Employment Security of the U.S. Department of Labor and pub­ lished in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. This Dictionary provides a code number (the so-called D.O.T. number) for each occupation included in it. The code numbers of the D.O.T. are listed in parentheses immediately below the main occupational group headings in the Handbook. Volumes I and II of the D.O.T. contain job definitions; the sup­ plement lists individual physical demands, working conditions, and training time data for each job defined in the Dictionary. SOME IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT THE OCCUPATIONAL REPORTS Occupations Covered The more than 700 occupations dis­ cussed in this Handbook generally are those of greatest interest to young people. Most of the large ones requir­ ing long periods of education or train­ ing are discussed, as are a number of small but rapidly growing fields and other occupations of special interest. Altogether, the occupations covered account for about 90 percent of all workers in professional and related and in sales occupations; nearly as high a proportion in skilled occupa­ tions; about half in clerical and about 40 percent in service occupations; and sm aller proportions in semi­ skilled occupations. The main types of farming occupations also are discussed. General information on many fields of work not covered in the oc­ cupational reports is contained in the introductions to the major divisions of the book. These introductions are designed to aid the reader in inter­ preting the reports on individual occupations. Sources of Information Information on employment trends and outlook and the many related topics discussed in the occupational reports was drawn from a great va­ riety of sources. It is based in part on extensive field investigation carried out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics professional staff. Interviews with hundreds of persons in industry, un­ ions, trade associations, and public agencies provided a wealth of the latest information. In addition, the Bureau’s other research programs supplied data on employment in dif­ ferent industries, productivity and technological developments, wages and working conditions, trade union agreements, industrial hazards, and a number of other topics. Additional data regarding the nature of the work in various occupations, training and licensing requirements, wages, and employment trends were provided by other agencies of the Federal Govern­ ment—among them, the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training and the Bureau of Employment Security in the Department of Labor; the Bu­ reau of the Census of the Department of Commerce; the Office of Educa­ tion and the Vocational Rehabili­ tation Administration of the Depart­ ment of Health, Education, and Wel­ fare; the Veterans Administration; the Civil Service Commission; the Interstate Commerce Commission; the Civil Aeronautics Board; the Fed­ eral Communications Commission; and the Department of Transporta­ tion. Many other public and private organizations—including State licens­ ing boards, educational institutions, business firms, professional societies, trade associations, and trade un­ ions—also made available published and unpublished data and supplied much helpful information through interviews. After the information from these many sources was brought together and analyzed, conclusions were reached as to prospective employ­ ment trends in the occupations. In addition, estimates were made of the numbers of job openings that will be created by retirements and deaths and transfers out of the occupation. The supply of new workers likely to be available in particular fields also was analyzed, by studying statistics on high school and college enrollments and graduations, data on the number of apprentices in skilled trades, re­ entries to an occupation, and trans­ fers into an occupation. Preliminary drafts of the occupa­ tional reports were reviewed by offi­ cials of leading companies, trade associations, trade unions, and pro­ fessional societies, and by other experts. The information and con­ clusions presented in each report thus reflect the knowledge and judg­ ment not only of the Bureau of Labor Statistics staff, but also of leaders in the field discussed, al­ though the Bureau, of course, takes full responsibility for all statements made. (See the technical index at the back of the book for a more detailed discussion of the sources of informa­ tion used in the occupational reports.) Points To Bear in-Mind in Using the Reports In using the information on em­ ployment prospects which this book contains, it is important to keep in mind that all conclusions about the 5 GUIDE' OX) THE' HANDBOOK economic future necessarily rest on certain assumptions. Among the as­ sumptions which underlie the state­ ments on employment outlook in this Handbook, are that high employment levels will be maintained and that no cataclysmic events will occur, such as a war or a severe and prolonged eco­ nomic depression. Such catastrophes would, of course, create an entirely different employment situation from that likely to develop under the assumed conditions. But young peo­ ple would find it impossible to build their lifetime plans in expectation of such unpredictable catastrophes, although, on the basis of historical ex­ perience, they must be prepared to weather economic ups and downs during their working lives. The assumptions and methodology used in employment outlook analysis are discussed in detail in the technical appendix, page 733. To avoid constant repetition, the assumptions seldom are mentioned in the reports on the many fields of work where the impact of a general decline in business or a change in the scale of mobilization would probably be about the same as in the economy as a whole. On the other hand, in the statements on occupations where employment tends to be either un­ usually stable or especially subject to ups and downs, the factors affecting employment are delineated. Even in the latter occupations, however, long-term trends in employment are more important than short-run fluctuations when appraising the prospects of an individual in a par­ ticular occupation. The picture of employment oppor­ tunities given in this book applies to the country as a whole unless other­ wise indicated. People who want supplementary information on job opportunities in their communities should consult local sources of infor­ mation, as suggested in the next chapter. The information presented on earnings and working conditions, as on other subjects, represents the most recent available when the Handbook was prepared early in 1967. Much of the information came from Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys, but many other sources were utilized also. For this reason, the earnings data pre­ sented in the various occupational reports often refer to different periods of time, cover varying geographic areas, and represent different kinds of statistical measures. Comparisons between the earnings data for differ­ ent occupations should, therefore, be made with great caution. Reference has been made in sev­ eral occupational statements to train­ ing programs established under the Manpower Development and Train­ ing Act (MDTA), to equip unem­ ployed and underemployed persons with skills needed in today’s world of work. However, the absence of a reference to MDTA training for a particular occupation does not neces­ sarily mean that programs are not in operation. In 1967, training programs (which last from several weeks to 2 years) covered several hundred occu­ pations—technical and semiprofes­ sional, skilled and semiskilled, clerical and sales, service and nonagricultural. To obtain information about MDTA training offered in your area, contact the local office of the State employ­ ment service. Finally, it should be kept in mind that information on occupations and the employment opportunities they offer is only part of that needed in making a career decision, which means matching a person and an oc­ cupation. The other part relates, of course, to the aptitudes and interests of the potential worker himself. In assessing their own abilities and in­ terests and in selecting the occupa­ tion for which they are best suited, people can obtain help from voca­ tional counselors in schools and col­ leges, State employment service of­ fices, Veterans Administration re­ gional offices and guidance centers, and many community agencies. WHERE TO GO FOR MORE INFORMATION OR ASSISTANCE Persons using this Handbook may want more detail on the occupations discussed in the occupational reports, or information on fields of work which are not covered in this publication. Suggestions as to sources of addi­ tional information on the occupations discussed are given in most of the oc­ cupational reports. In addition, sev­ eral types of publications of the U.S. Department of Labor, including peri­ odicals described on pages 757-759, provide further information on topics such as earnings, hours of work, and working conditions. Other sources likely to be helpful include public libraries; schools; State employment services; business establishments; and trade unions, employers’ associations, and professional societies. A brief de­ scription of each follows. Public Libraries These libraries usually have many books, pamphlets, and magazine ar­ ticles giving information about differ­ ent occupations. They also may have several books and current, indexes which list the great numbers of publi­ cations on occupations, and the librar­ ians may be of assistance in finding the best ones on a particular field of work. Schools School libraries and guidances of­ fices also often have extensive reading materials on occupations. In addition, school counselors and teachers usually know of any local occupational infor­ mation which has been assembled through special surveys made by schools or other community agencies. Teachers of special subjects such as music, printing, and shorthand can often give information about occu­ pations related to the subjects they teach. State Employment Services Counselors in local public employ­ ment offices are in a particularly good position to supply information about job opportunities, hiring standards, and wages in their localities. (The services available through the public employment offices are described in the concluding section of this chapter.) 7 8 OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK Business Establishments Employers and personnel officers usually can supply information about the nature of the work performed by employees in their industry or busi­ ness and the qualifications needed for various jobs, as well as other facts about employment conditions and oportunities. The names of local firms in a particular industry can be found in the classified sections of telephone directories or can be ob­ tained from local chambers of com­ merce. Trade Unions, Employers’ Associa­ tions, and Professional Societies Frequently, these organizations have local branches; their officials can supply information relating to the oc­ cupations with which they are concerned. OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK SERVICE PUBLICATIONS AND MATERIALS The Bureau of Labor Statistics has published a Counselor’s Guide to Occupational and Other Manpower Information, An Annotated Bibliog­ raphy of Selected Government Pub­ lications. The bibliography, as the title suggests, lists the major occupa­ tional and other manpower publica­ tions of Federal and State govern­ ment agencies that will be useful to counselors and others interested in trends and developments that have implications for career decisions. This bulletin, No. 1421, is available from the Superintendent of Documents, G overnm ent Printing Office, Wash­ ington, D.C. 20402, at 50 cents a copy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also issues a periodical, the Occupational Outlook Quarterly, to keep readers up to date between editions of the Handbook, on developments affecting employment opportunities and on the findings of new occupational outlook research. In addition, the Bureau issues at irregular intervals occupa­ tional outlook bulletins which give much more detailed information on various fields of work than can be included either in the Handbook or in the Occupational Outlook Quar­ terly. Further information about these publications, and directions for ordering them, will be found on page 757. The Bureau also has developed a new visual aid for counselors entitled Looking Ahead To A Career. It con­ sists of a set of 36 color slides that show the changing occupational and industrial mix and what this implies for manpower development, educa­ tion, and training. The slides and the narrative used in presenting the slides are available directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for $10 a set. The Bureau will be glad to place the name of any user of this Hand­ book on its mailing list to receive announcements of new publications and releases summarizing the results of new studies. Anyone wishing to receive such materials should send the request, with his address, to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. De­ partment of Labor, Washington, D.C. 20212. 9 ment service network of offices, information is also available on job opportunities in other areas of the country. SERVICES TO JOBSEEKERS AT PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT OFFICES Local offices of State employment services specialize in finding jobs for workers and workers for jobs. The State employment services are affil­ iated with the U.S. Employment Service of the Manpower Administra­ tion’s Bureau of Employment Secu­ rity and constitute a Federal-State partnership. Employment and related services are available without charge in every State. At each of the over 2,000 public employment service offices across the Nation, jobseekers are aided in ob­ taining employment, and employers are assisted in finding qualified workers. There are four basic services pro­ vided to workers by the public em­ ployment service: (1) Job informa­ tion; (2) employment counseling; (3) referral to job training or other needed service; and (4) job place­ ment. Job Information. The personnel who staff the public employment service offices are familiar with their areas and thus know what kinds of workers are employed in local industry, what jobs are available, what the hiring requirements and the opportunities for advancement are, and the wages that are paid. The staff conduct man­ power surveys to determine the area’s available skills, training needs, and what the future occupational oppor­ tunities will be. Through the employ10 Employment Counseling. Employ­ ment counseling assists young people who are starting their careers, as well as experienced workers who wish or need to change their occupation. The major purposes of employment coun­ seling are to help people understand their actual and potential abilities, their interests, and their personal traits; to know the nature of occupa­ tions; and to make the best use of their capacities and preferences in the light of available job opportunities. The employment counselor is a specially trained individual who has access to a large store of occupational information. Testing facilities are one resource available to him. Most local offices provide testing services to help the counselor appraise the applicant’s abilities, aptitudes, and preferences. Often such tests reveal aptitudes the jobseeker did not know he had. The General Aptitude Test Battery, for instance, measures basic abilities for broad fields of work and for specific jobs. Referral to Training. Many individ­ uals seek work for which they lack some qualifications. Sometimes it is a matter of basic education or the level of skill which the job requires. One of the most important functions of the public employment service, short of actually referring a jobseeker to a job, is referral to a training op­ portunity where he can improve his employability and thereby qualify for a job or secure a better one. Jobs change and so do job require­ ments. In today’s fast-paced world, important considerations when se­ lecting a vocation are the training required to perform the work, and how that training need can be met. job openings must be filled with oc­ cupationally qualified workers, and employment suited to the worker’s skills, knowledge, and abilities must be found. By performing this dual function, the public employment service eliminates the waste of “hitor-miss” job hunting. The method of operation is basi­ cally simple. Regular contact is maintained with local employers in order to learn about their job open­ ings. Requests are received from em­ ployers for many different kinds of workers. As a result, registered ap­ plicants have access to a variety of job vacancies with many employers, just as the employer has access to many applicants. If job openings are not available locally, applicants may be offered the opportunity to apply for employment elsewhere in the State, in another area, or even in a foreign country. Each State employment service pre­ pares inventories of its hard-to-fill jobs so that other State employment services may refer local workers to out-of-area jobs for which they qualify. In addition, a national net­ work of highly specialized profes­ sional placement offices operates within the employment service net­ work to speed the matching of jobs and applicants in professional fields. Special Services for Youth. The full range of employment services is avail­ able to youth. Specialized youth units have been established in most local offices. In addition, some 170 Youth Opportunity Centers (YOC) have been established in high population areas, as a part of the public employ­ ment service system, to assist young people, particularly school dropouts, to prepare for and obtain jobs. YOC representatives go into neighborhoods where disadvantaged youth live to recruit and motivate those who do not come on their own to the center for help. These centers, established in early 1965, provide complete em­ Job Placement. A primary objective ployment services and cooperate of the public employment service is closely with other community agen­ to place workers in jobs. Employers’ cies serving youth. WHERE TO GO FOR MORE INFORMATION Special Services for Disadvantaged Adults. Through its recently estab­ lished human resources development program, the employment service seeks to improve the employability of adults who have withdrawn from the work force because of some social or cultural disadvantage. An important part of this program is “outreach” into slum areas. Other Special Services. Individuals with mental or physical disabilities which constitute vocational handi­ caps are given special consideration by the employment service. Veterans also receive special serv­ ices. Each local office has a veterans’ employment representative who is in­ formed about veterans’ rights and benefits, and seeks to develop jobs for veterans. Middle-age and older workers are assisted in making realistic job choices and overcoming problems related to getting and holding jobs. Employers are encouraged to remove unreasonable age restrictions and to base hiring on the individual’s ability to perform the work. Similar attention is given to the employment problems of minority 11 group members and all others facing special difficulties in obtaining suit­ able employment. Community Manpower Service. Job­ seekers, employers, schools, civic groups, and public and private agen­ cies concerned with manpower prob­ lems are invited to utilize the service of the public employment office in their community, and avail them­ selves of the job information in that office. The local office which serves you is listed in the phone book as an agency of your State government. TOMORROW’S JOBS Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions a young per­ son will ever make. This choice de­ pends on an appraisal of his interests and abilities, as well as on a knowl­ edge of the economic and other fac­ tors that are likely to affect his future career and employment opportuni­ ties. Among these factors are changes in the composition of the country’s work force and in its businesses and industries, as well as changing oc­ cupational trends. These develop­ ments in the economy are ceaseless and ever present. They affect the kinds of work that people will do and determine the changes in education and training that are required to pre­ pare individuals for different kinds of work. The Handbook contains economic information which will provide stu­ dents and their counselors, teachers, and parents with answers to such questions as: What kind of jobs will there be? What industries will pro­ vide these jobs? What qualifications will be necessary for these jobs? What fields of work look especially promis­ ing? What will the competitive situa­ tion be for young people seeking to enter the labor force? The charts that follow will serve as a useful tool for counselors who share the major responsibility for helping young people to decide about their future educational and job plans. They graphically answer questions about the changing nature of occupa­ tions and industries and discuss the implications of these trends for career choice. The ability of young people to maximize the opportunities that await them will depend to a great extent on their education and train­ ing. There is a need for workers to be broadly educated so that they can more readily adapt to changing job requirements and absorb the training and retraining that may be necessary to permit them to switch jobs. Workers who have completed the most education generally have the highest incomes. Yet, experience has shown that the amount of money one can earn over a lifetime should not be the compelling consideration in choosing a career. Job satisfaction and the many other personal rewards that flow from the right choice of a career may be even more important than monetary considerations. It follows, therefore, that a young person must first of all consider his own interests, talents, and abilities in making alter­ native occupational choices. (See also Using the Handbook in Guidance Services, p. 1 and Services to Job­ seekers at Public Employment Offices, p. 10.) 13 THE COUNTRY’S HUMAN RESOURCES SHAPE THE CHARACTER AND NATURE OF ITS MANPOWER About 40 percent of our total pop­ ulation is working to provide our growing national requirements for food, clothing, shelter, and services. More than a third of these workers (27.2 million) are women. Most People Make Their Living As Private Wage And Salary Workers - 1965 IN MILLIONS PRIVATE WAGE AND SALARY 52.6 GOVERN MENT _________ SELF EMPLOYED 85 f f r * 14 FAMILY WORKERS __ L4 Most people work for someone else, either for a salary or a wage. Yet 1 out of every 7 workers is either selfemployed or contributing his services to a family enterprise. The majority of workers are employed in private industry, and about 13 percent work for Federal, State, and local govern­ ment. 15 TOMORROW’S JOBS Despite the long-term shift away from employment in goods producing industries to employment in the serv­ ice industries, manufacturing is still the largest employer among the major industry divisions. About 19 million persons worked in manufac­ turing in 1965. The second and third largest industries, trade and services accounted for nearly 14 and 13 mil­ lion workers, respectively. The principal occupations in these industry groups are: Manufacturing: Operatives of machines, assemblers, engineers, stenographers, production man­ agers, tool and die makers, traveling salesmen, and unskilled laborers. Trade: Sales workers, clerical workers, truckdrivers, deliverymen, elevator operators, pack­ agers, and repair workers. Government: Teachers, police­ men, firemen, sanitation work­ ers, welfare workers, clerical workers, post office workers, and public health workers. Gains, as well as losses in employ­ ment, may result from technological innovations. Agriculture is a good ex­ ample of an industry in which laborsaving technologies have been devel­ oped to such an extent that employ­ ment declines accompany increases in farm production. However, the opposite is true in the concrete prod­ ucts industry, where, despite rapid increases in output per man-hour, employment is rising.

FISHERIES MINING CONTRACT CONSTRUCTION 25 50 75 100% Compared with a 20-percent in­ crease in total employment over the next decade, employment in govern­ ment, services, and the contract con­ struction industries will grow much faster. Although employment in man­ ufacturing is expected to grow only half as fast as total employment, this industry will continue to employ the greatest number of workers. Recent developments in the fields of education, manpower, and health and welfare have intensified the de­ mand for services of all kinds. These and other factors, such as technologi­ cal innovations, have resulted in dif­ ferential growth rates of industries and changes in occupational require­ ments. The future employment level of individual industries is the primary determinant of occupational require­ ments. This is so because each in­ dustry has a unique occupational structure. For example, the structure of the insurance industry, which em­ ploys a large number of clerical, sales, and other white-collar workers, dif­ fers markedly from that of the con­ struction industry, where employment is concentrated in blue-collar occupa­ tions—carpenters, electricians, and laborers. Consequently, a sharp change in total employment in the construction industry will have a marked effect on the requirements for blue-collar workers. Conversely, if employment in the insurance industry changes sharply, requirements for workers in white-collar occupations will be significantly affected. The sec­ ond factor influencing the trend in occupational employment is the changing occupational structure within industries. 17 TOMORROW’S JOBS Semiskilled workers constitute the largest occupational group. In 1965, more than 13 million workers (fac­ tory assemblers, inspectors, machine operators, and apprentices; truck, taxicab, and bus drivers; and others) were employed in this occupational group, which represents an important source of work for new young male workers. The second and third largest occupational groups, clerical and service workers, are a major source of work for women. Craftsmen—the skilled worker category—make up the fourth largest occupational group; and professional workers—most of whom have had some college train­ ing—make up the next largest group. Within each occupational group, there is a diversity of jobs requiring differing levels of education and skill. For instance, among professional and related workers are nuclear physicists as well as athletes; and among service workers are FBI agents and house­ hold workers. Similarily, among sales workers, there are technical sales rep­ resentatives with engineering back­ grounds, as well as retail salesclerks. In general, employment growth will be fastest among those occupa­ tions requiring the most education and training to enter. Employment in professional and related occupations will show the fast­ est growth over the next 10 years— twice as fast as overall employment. These occupations generally require the most formal educational prepara­ tion to qualify for employment. The completion of a high school education has become standard for American workers. Employers are seeking people with higher levels of education because job content is more complex and requires higher levels of skill. Many rapidly growing jobs in the clerical, sales, and service fields reflect this trend.

Semiskilled workers have, on the average, about a year and a half less education than the typical American worker. Though the growth rate anticipated for this group is relatively low, 4 million semiskilled jobs are ex­ pected to be available over the next decade. Service workers are a very diverse group and include workers with both high and low levels of education and skill. Service jobs requiring high levels of educational attainment will ac­ count for most of the projected growth of about 3 million workers. Nevertheless, due to the size of this group, another 3 million job openings will arise because of replacement needs. Training Needs Are Determined By Replacement Plus Growth WORKERS NEEDED. E965 1975 200.000 400,000 600.000 A WORD ABOUT JOB OPENINGS Job opportunities spring from two sources: Net growth and replacement needs. In rapidly growing occupa­ tions made up mainly of young men with a long working life ahead of them, growth in the occupation will be the principal source of new jobs. On the other hand, replacement needs will be particularly high in oc­ cupations with a large proportion of older workers who have relatively few years of working life left. Similarly, job openings also arise as many wom­ en leave the labor force to take care of family responsibilities. 19 TOMORROW’S JOBS Engineering And Teaching Are The Largest Professional Occupations MILLIONS OF WORKERS, 1965 A LOOK AT FUTURE MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS , SCIENTIFIC. TECHNICAL TEACHING IN THE PROFESSIONS Teaching is the largest profession and, like nursing, represents a major source of employment for women. Engineering is the major field of pro­ fessional employment for men. Altogether, nearly 9 million per­ sons work in these and other profes­ sional and technical fields. Scientific and engineering employ­ ment is expected to grow faster than that of the professional group as a whole. The growth rate for scientists is likely to be greater than that of engineers. Technicians who assist engineers and scientists will also show a rapid rate of growth. During the 1965 school year, 53 mil­ lion persons—more than one-fourth of the country’s population—were enrolled in schools and colleges. These enrollments are likely to exceed 60 million by 1975. To take care of this growth, the Nation’s teaching staff will have to increase by about one-third (650,000); nearly three times this number (1.8 million) will be required to fill teaching positions vacated because of retirements, trans­ fers, and deaths.

Persons in these occupations assist profes­ sional workers, who are in short sup­ ply, in performing the more routine aspects of their work. Educational re­ quirements in these occupations are lower than those for entrance into the professional health occupations, and training facilities can be expanded more rapidly. Yet, in both cases, the supply of workers will have to be ex­ panded greatly to meet health man­ power requirements. For many years, the demand for people in the “helping” professions— counselors, social workers, librarians, and others—has exceeded the avail­ able supply. The recently passed so­ cial welfare, education, and man­ power legislation heightens the de­ mand for their services. The result is that opportunities for work in these fields are virtually unlimited for qualified people.

This field is also a major source of employment for young people. Clerical workers represent a large variety of skills. This occupational group includes, for example, highly skilled workers such as title research­ ers and examiners in real estate firms and confidential secretaries in busi­ nesses of all kinds. It also includes oc­ cupations such as messengers and file clerks which can be entered with lit­ tle specialized training. 21 TOMORROW’S JOBS Technological innovations in this field, including the use of computers, have tended to reshape the nature of the work of office machine operators and create entirely new functions such as those performed by electronic com­ puter personnel. Employment in these fields, though less numerous than among the traditional clerical occu­ pations, is growing the fastest. MANAGERIAL OCCUPATIONS Employment trends among man­ agers and proprietors have followed the longrun shift from small to large business organizations. Many inde­ pendently run retail shops and firms have disappeared, and chainstores of all kinds and complex corporations have replaced them. Thus, the re­ quirements for salaried managers and officials have far outpaced the need for self-employed proprietors, who, in fact, have been declining in number. As a result, many thousands of job opportunities will be available for col­ lege-trained people in fields such as advertising, banking, and hotel and restaurant management, as well as in occupations such as industrial pur­ chasing agent and industrial traffic manager. Jobs For Salaried Managers Grow As Number Of Proprietors Decreases 5 OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK 22 SALES OCCUPATIONS About 5 million persons are em­ ployed in sales occupations. Of this number, about one-fourth are em­ ployed on a part-time basis. Salesworkers employed in retail stores ac­ count for over one-half of the employ­ ment in this occupational group. Most of these workers are women. Almost all persons employed outside of retail trade—in wholesale trade, manufac­ turing, insurance companies, real estate firms, and other companies— are men. In the 1965-75 period, employ­ ment in this occupational group may rise by 25 percent, totaling around 6 million workers. Most of this growth is likely to occur in occupations out­ side the retail field, among real estate salesmen, insurance agents, manufac­ turer’s salesmen, and others. Sales Work Offers Many Employment Opportunities For Men And Women MILLIONS OF JOBS .1965 58.2” OTHER FIRMS (wholesale, manufacturer's. Insurance, real estate) about a fourth of salespeople work part time More Than 9 Million People Worked In Service Occupations 2 3 SERVICE OCCUPATIONS Private household workers are the largest single group of service work­ ers, accounting for one-fourth of total employment in 1965. Virtually all are women, many of whom work part time as dayworkers and babysitters. Almost as many service workers are employed as waiters, bartenders, and countergirls. This occupational group also includes protective service work­ ers such as FBI agents and policemen who have much more education, on the average, than the group as a whole. 23 TOMORROW’S JOBS The greatest growth is anticipated among service workers outside of private households, mainly among protective service workers, food serv­ ice workers, and hospital attendants. SKILLED OCCUPATIONS Construction workers, mechanics and repairmen, and machinists make up the majority of the country’s skilled work force. New entrants into these fields generally have at least a high school education; many acquire their skills through apprenticeship training programs, through experi­ ence gained on the job, and by completing a vocational school curriculum. Earnings of skilled workers are rel­ atively high, reflecting the level of the work they are required to per­ form, their extensive training, and the exercise of independent judgment. They generally have more job se­ curity, better chances for promotions, and more opportunities to open their own businesses than semiskilled or unskilled workers.

Requirements for skilled workers will rise by nearly one-fourth between 1965 and 1975 from about 9 million to nearly lV /t million. Of the 4 mil­ lion job openings that are anticipated, slightly over one-half will result from growth in the field and the remainder from deaths and retirements. Job opportunities will vary greatly among the skilled occupations that make up this group. For example, despite the small employment growth anticipated for carpenters, the great­ est number of jobs will be found in this occupation, mainly because of its size and high replacement needs. On the other hand, business machine servicemen, a relatively small occupa­ tion, is likely to grow very rapidly. Yet this occupation will offer relatively few employment opportunities. SEMISKILLED OCCUPATIONS WERE IN DRIVING OCCUPATIONS Although employment growth in this group, which includes factory workers as well as operators of motor vehicles, will be less than average be­ tween 1965, and 1975, many thou­ sands of job opportunities will be available to young people. This is the largest of all the occupational groups and replacement needs are high. Drivers and deliverymen account for roughly one out of every five semi­ skilled workers. Employment of local and over-the-road truckdrivers is ex­ pected to grow between 1965 and 1975, offering many employment op­ portunities for young men seeking to enter the work force. TOMORROW’S JOBS A LOOK AT FUTURE MANPOWER SUPPLY Just as the country’s population furnishes the market for most of the goods and services it produces, it also provides the men and women who produce these goods and services. The labor force, that part of our population age 16 years and over who are working or looking for work, is likely to have a faster rate of growth than our population during the 196575 decade, reaching a total of 92 mil­ lion people. The rising proportion of women who work will continue to be a major factor (along with the growth in the number of young workers) contribut­ ing to the anticipated increase in the labor force. By 1975, women will ac­ count for about 36 percent of all workers, compared with 34 percent today. The highest proportion of working women is found in the 45-54 age group. Slightly over 50 percent of all women in that age group were work­ ing in 1965 and almost 60 percent are expected to be working in 1975. About 50 percent of all women be­ tween the ages of 20 and 24 will be in the labor force by 1975. 25 OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK Major Changes In The Labor Force MILLIONS OF WORKERS -1 0 +1 6 1955-1965 1965-1975 New Workers Will Be Better Educated ...

MORE THAN ONE FOURTH WILL HAVE LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION Dropouts Are More Likely To Be Unemployed Than Graduates DROPOUTS By 1975, one-fourth of all persons between the ages of 16 and 25 will be in the labor force (including the Armed Forces), compared with fewer than one-fifth some 20 years earlier. Thus, the economy will be required to absorb increasing numbers of young persons who must be trained to meet technological and other changes anticipated over the next decade. The prime working age group (2534) will increase twice as fast as the labor force between 1965 and 1975. Workers in this age group have been in relatively short supply for many years and actually declined by about 750,000 between 1955 and 1965. The anticipated increase in their numbers will help to alleviate the shortages of well-qualified workers in many oc­ cupations. The workers who will be entering the labor force in the next decade will have more years of schooling than their predecessors. More of them will have completed high school, more will have gone to college, and a smaller proportion will be high school dropouts. Nevertheless, if trends con­ tinue, more than a quarter of the new entrants will have less than a high school education. Aside from the loss of earnings that poorly educated workers will experi­ ence over their lifetimes, they will not share in other benefits that stem from a good education: Cultural enrich­ ment; a satisfying way of life, both as workers and as responsible citizens; and other intangible social ad­ vantages. 27 TOMORROW’S JOBS The unemployment rates of young people are much higher at every educational level but dropouts are hit the hardest. Young people seeking a toehold in the labor force often have difficulties simply because they lack relevant work experience. In addition, they face competition for jobs from other persons who are better educated. Thus, it is not uncommon for young people—regardless of their educa­ tional attainment—to experience high levels of unemployment. A WORD OF CAUTION The picture of the future as re­ flected in the Handbook and in these charts is based on four fundamental assumptions: 1. That high levels of economic activity and employment will be maintained over the long run, even though there may be temporary reces­ sions. 2. A defense program similar to that prevailing immediately prior to the Vietnam buildup will exist. 3. That scientific and technologi­ cal advances will continue. 4. That the institutions and funda­ mental economic structure of the United States will not change signifi­ cantly.

These occupations offer opportunities for interesting and responsible work and, in many cases, lead to high earnings. As a rule, however, they can be entered only after long periods of specialized edu­ cation or other preparation, because a broad knowledge of one’s field is an essential requirement for success in these types of work. About 1 out of 8 workers in 1966 was in a professional and related occupation. These occupations—em­ ploying more than 9.3 million peo­ ple—accounted for more than one-fourth of all white-collar employment. The professions generally require either college graduation—often with an advanced degree—or experience of such kind and amount to provide comparable knowledge. Professional occupations are of two main types. Most professional occupations, in­ cluding those of engineer, architect, physician, lawyer, and teacher, re­ quire specialized, theoretical knowl­ edge of a specific field. The other group, including occupations such as editor and actor, does not require as much specialized, theoretical knowl­ edge, but demands a great deal of creative talent and, also, skill ac­ quired chiefly through experience. Licenses are required for practice in many professions—medicine, den­ tistry, and pharmacy, for example— with licensing authorities deter­ mining the minimum qualifications Teaching & Engineering Are The Largest Professional Occupations Employment In Selected Professional, Technical, and Kindred Occupations 200 THOUSANDS OF WORKERS, 1966 400 600 800 1000 1200 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SECONDARY COLLEGE (FULL TIME) SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ENGINEERS TECHNICIANS SCIENTISTS HEALTH REGISTERED NURSES PHYSICIANS PRACTICAL NURSES PHARMACISTS DENTISTS OTHER ACCOUNTANTS CLERGYMEN LAWYERS Growth Of Professional, Technical And Kindred Occupations 0 2 4 EMPLOYMENT IN MILLIONS 6 8 • DATA PRIOR TO 1950 ARE DECENNIAL CENSUS FIGURES AND ARE NOT STRICTLY COMPARABLE TO LATER YEARS 29 30 i OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK Graduates As A Percent Of All Pe rsons 22 Years Number Of Bachelor’s Degrees Granted THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS 200 400 Of Age 600 0% 800 10% 20% ematicians, physicians, and other professional personnel.
