        "text": "I grew up where I could run outside barefoot at any time of the year. I would spend hours either swimming in the creek, climbing trees or haystacks, hiking in the hills or floating down irrigation ditches from sunup until sundown. Nature dictated everything I did. I was super aware of the cycle of seasons and how they impacted our farm. Droughts, floods, fires and frosts could be devastating to any one of the farmers living in our small valley.\n\nThat awareness carries with me today in everything I do. Being sensitive to where something is sourced from; who is making it and how it’s being made. I love to be inspired by an artisan’s story and journey. I’m also very tactile and have a very visceral design instinct. My body will literally react when I see something that works visually or doesn’t. I’m not quite sure where that instinct came from and I’m betting nature had a hand.\n\nOne word: barefoot. Unfortunately, that doesn’t work all the time. I live in my Frye boots. They are so beautifully trashed and when I’m not on the farm, people always tell me they love them. I also wore them with my wedding dress after the ceremony. They’re that good. When you’re always going in and out of the house from being outside, you need a pair of shoes that can easily slip on and off. It’s all about function on a farm. Jeans, t-shirts and down vests are my go-tos.\n\nOh, where do I start? I’ve always known there was something special about growing up on a farm. My husband and I were married on our family farm and it was so simple and beautiful. I know… it’s our wedding, how could I not say that? However, I planned our wedding in two and a half weeks. I let go of all the “musts” or “shoulds” surrounding what a wedding is. I refused to Google or search wedding ideas. I let nature dictate and be the backdrop, just as it was for me as a child. We wanted everyone to feel at ease, have fun and most importantly, feel relaxed.\n\nI bought vintage china and mismatched stemware from thrift stores for our table. My dad and I made the benches so they could be repurposed for our monthly town hall potlucks. I gathered rocks from our creek and added a simple gold brush-stroke detail for all our guest to take home. Our long dinner table was lined with oak and olive branches gathered from the property. We had 35 mile-per-hour wind gusts that day, so I had to keep all arrangements very close to the table or those oak branches would have ended up as our salad. Our family and friends could not stop talking about how it was the best wedding they’d ever been too. Even today, they still tell us it was a “magical” experience.\n\nEvery year in June, we make a walnut liqueur out of our green walnuts called, Nocino. At the end of the night after our wedding, we all gathered around a faux fire pit (my dad didn’t want to light any fires for fear of starting a bigger one) and took sips of this sweet caramel digestif as we laughed, shared memories and told stories under the stars.\n\nWe rented gorgeous canvas bell tents for our guest to sleep in. Those alone were magical and such a treat for everyone as they glowed so beautifully in the dark."
