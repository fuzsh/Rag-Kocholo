Meredith's husband Steve Kavovit is Kerr Smiths' business manager.\n\nI read an interview with Kerr Smith a few years back where he stated, he adores her. Meredith is also good friends with Kerr's ex-wive Harmoni Everett.\n\nI'll see if I can find the interview.\n\nFan Forum Legend\n\nModerator of ...\n\nEverwood\n\nJoined: Apr 2004\n\nPosts: 313,050\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by TL22 (View Post)\n\nActually they still are close.

It seems like Meredith is such a stable, down to earth, decent person, she maintains her dynamics. She is the anti-Katie Holmes. lol\n\nDo we know what the dynamic between Meredith and James was like?\n\nExtreme Fan\n\nJoined: May 2012\n\nPosts: 2,614\n\nThis isn't the interview I mentioned, but it's close enough\n\nOur Exclusive Kerr Smith Interview | Small Screen Scoop\n\nI don't know much about Meredith Monroe's relationship with James van der Beek except that she mentioned that she talks to him in an interview.

James (van der Beek) I hung out with quite a bit over the last six or seven years. His ex-wife and my ex-wife are actually best friends, so we always hung out a lot. I haven’t spoken to Josh (Jackson) or Michelle (Williams) or Katie (Holmes) – obviously she’s off the grid – much at all. So really just James and Meredith.\n\nOf course Meredith is immediately mentioned. Of course when given the chance Smith immediately talked about his interaction with her. <3\n\nQuote:\n\nThis link is a Meredith Monroe interview on youtube.

You can tell based on how she responded when Smith and Jackson were mentioned, she really is true friends with them, and then she mentioned James. Even Busy, made it a point to mention she will see Michelle in passing. Nothing about Katie.\n\nExtreme Fan\n\nJoined: May 2012\n\nPosts: 2,614\n\nIf anyone would like to see Meredith play against type find her movie \"New Best Friend\"\n\nShe plays a bad girl and she is good at it.\n\nFan Forum Legend\n\nModerator of ...\n\nEverwood\n\nJoined: Apr 2004\n\nPosts: 313,050\n\nI was on the Creek thread and I noticed the Pacey/Tamara appreciation thread. I know it hasn't been super active but I was shocked it existed. lol\n\nAnd to think I had issues with Madison and Ezra... this one takes the cake for me. LOL\n\nPacey still has acne there. lol He's a boy, he's not remotely an adult. She is a grown-fricken woman. She is mentally disturbed being attracted to a boy.\n\nThat looks just like his mother:\n\nI am too disturbed to post the intimate pictures on here so I won't.\n\nHow did everyone else feel about this, umm... situation?\n\nExtreme Fan\n\nJoined: May 2012\n\nPosts: 2,614\n\nPacey and Tamara was just wrong....I wonder if they did that to compare it to the purity of Dawson and Joey.....Remember this is season one.\n\nWas Andie brought in to bring Pacey back to earth?\n\nLast edited by TL22; 04-22-2014 at 08:36 AM\n\nFan Forum Legend\n\nModerator of ...\n\nEverwood\n\nJoined: Apr 2004\n\nPosts: 313,050\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by TL22 (View Post)\n\nPacey and Tamara was just wrong....I wonder if they did that to compare it to the purity of Dawson and Joey.....Remember this is season one.\n\nThat's a very good point. Extremely possible they went there to show that comparison.\n\nQuote:\n\nWas Andie brought in to bring Pacey back to earth?\n\nI like this speculation. Maybe they really did want to show all of Pacey's vulnerabilities and immaturity (to certainly demonstrate how messed up his relationship with is father was) in order to really hit home how perfectly matched Pacey/Andie were together. Andie was precisely what Pacey needed in his life.\n\nFrom 7 minutes and on, THAT is why Andie was the perfect one for Pacey and what she did for him, how she was that bright star in his life. Pacey/Joey NEVER had a scene like that, that is for damn sure.\n\nLast edited by jediwands; 04-22-2014 at 11:04 AM"
