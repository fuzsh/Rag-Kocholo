The story of\n\nits blooming devehipnient is another saga in the progressive history\n\nof our (lollege.\n\nAs told to the writer by an alumnus, one attended college for\n\nllio customary foin )ears. During one quarter for one class period,\n\nthe cadet teacher sfient the time observing a selected group of pupils,\n\nTor only one day of the entire [leriod, each student spent a day in\n\nconi|)lle charge of the class. There were no seminars, orientation\n\nperiods, or field trips such us we have today.\n\nNeedless lo say, we were shocked at such a revelation and began\n\nlo evahiHle seriously the program as we know it. Here we found in\n\na proee(hiri'! most of u^ taki- f(r gratited, \"A Golden Opporunity.\"\n\nWc have a chance to find our weaknesses before they find us and\n\nleove us labelled as \"incompclenls.\" We are spared the brutal lesson\n\nof the \"seiiool of hard knocks\" and the college of \"trial and error.\"\n\nThe Student-Teacher program is \"A Golden Opportunity.\" in\n\nwhich we learn nnich to enrich our educational program. During\n\nthis period, opportunities are presented in a real situation and in a\n\nnatural setting so tliat we may perform duties and exiiibil skills that\n\nare prerequisites to success as leachers. Every day is filled with\n\nnew and revealing experiences. There is nevr a dull luomnt, for\n\nour lives are full and creative. So are tlie young minds we serve.\n\nThe critic teachers are interested in our personal growth and\n\ndevelopment as well as in our professional accomplishments. They\n\nstrive, even beyond professional duty, to provide worthwhile experi-\n\nences. For this great service the> deserve high commendation.\n\nThe teaching profession is among nian'l greatest services to man\n\nand it is heartening to know that Savatmah State College, in step with\n\nleading institutions of higher learning in the nation, is providing a\n\nteacher-training program which is outstanding.\n\nDr. Calvi L. Kiah, chairman of tlie department of education, and\n\nMiss Donella J. Graham, coordinator of student-teaching oti the\n\nelementary school level, and their staffs, deserve high praise for their\n\nefforts in the advance and progress of this important phase of teacher\n\neducation.\n\nIf greater opportunitit^ are provided in the area of education and\n\nteacher-training, we believe Savannah Slate will be among the first\n\nwith the finest,\n\nHosea J.

Ralher, there are some\n\nimportant factors which, when out to-\n\ngether, give you important clues not\n\nonly lo ihe making of a successful be-\n\nginning in ihe early days of your stu-\n\ndent teaching, but also to your con-\n\ntinuing success as a teacher.\n\nThe following suggestions concerning\n\nyour responsibility to yourself are of-\n\nfered to aid you in gelting off lo a\n\ngood start. Your management of time,\n\nand your personal appearance play im-\n\nportcinl roles in achieving success in\n\nstudent leaching.\n\nA prospective cadet teacher mighl use\n\nthe following as a checklist for groom-\n\ning;\n\ns my clothing clean ami well\n\npressed ?\n\nIs my clothing praclical for ilie kinds\n\nof activities in which 1 must engage\n\nwith ihe pupils?\n\nI> my clothing attractively harmoni-\n\nous in ils color combinations?\n\nIs my clodijng suitable lo my per-\n\nsonality modish, without conspicuous-\n\nly allracling allenlion to itself? ^\n\nDo I wear comfortable, praclical shoes\n\nthai are regularly cleaned and polishty)\n\nand in good repair?\n\nAre nil my accessories fresh, neat,\n\nand appropriate to school wear?\n\nIs my jewelry in such good taste that\n\n>es not draw undue allention to it-\n\nIf?\n\nWe are wishing every student suc-\n\nce>s in liis practice leaching.

Circulation Manager, by\n\n. m., April 18.\n\nWhat Is Our Destiny?\n\nThe questioiK \"What is nur destiny:'\" has been asked over and\n\nover again, by people of all groups. Even though many of us never\n\nthink of it, we must face this question in one way or another.\n\nIf we are to survive in this atomic age, there is a role for each\n\nof us to play in our society. It is our responsibility to utilize our\n\ncapabiUties to their fullest extent.\n\nNo individual thinks seriously at all times, but our present-day\n\nconditions require serious thought. We must remember today is but\n\na prelude lo tomorrow. Therefore, it is better for us to begin now to\n\nprepare ourselves for the tasks which lie ahead of us.\n\nThe Bible speaks of man's reaping whal he sows. To that, I\n\nshould like lo add that some of us sow infertile seeds, especially when\n\nwe spend our lime doing nothing. Thus, we reap nothing. There are\n\ntoo many people in the world who want nothing; they just tag along.\n\nCould this be true of some of us here at Savannah State? Often\n\nfollowing discourses given by speakers, we hear remarks concerning\n\nour purpose at this institution. This leads me to wonder whether it\n\nis a common tliought that abilities and talents are developed and not\n\npicked up by osmosis.\n\nAn institution is only as great as its constituents. This needs no\n\nconfirmation other tlian to say that men make institutions and we\n\nhave great potentialities with us. We ourselves must face and recognize\n\nour de^liin\n\n-\\nn Ruth Howard.\n\nThis is ihe story behind a story of\n\nprogress. The Creative Writing Edi-\n\ntion of The Tiger^'s Roar, released last\n\nmonth, marked more tlian a new high\n\nin journalistic achievement at SSC. In\n\naddiiion. tliis literary- effort, in the\n\nwords of its preface, \"symbolized and\n\ncrystallized an ideal which the late\n\nDean Janie Lester constantly advocated\n\nthe developmeni of creative expres-\n\n-iim Hiiiong the students of Savannah\n\nSlate.\"\n\nDuring the past year, several worth-\n\nwhile contributions of a creative na-\n\nture reached ihe Student Publication\n\nOffice, bul Ihis kind of material was\n\nnot loo well suileil to newspaper edi-\n\ntions. Sensing a great need of an out-\n\nlet ihat could encourage and utilize\n\nthe students' creative talents. Miss\n\nLuetia B. Colvin, advisor to student\n\npublicalion. began exploring the possi-\n\nbility of doing a magazine edition ex-\n\npressly for creative writing. However,\n\nthis idea remained a dream until the\n\nadvent of such a publicalion last month.\n\nSparked by the sincere desire for the\n\ncuhivalion of creativity in expression\n\nand thinking here at SSC. and the\n\nkind encouragement of Dr. W. K. Payne\n\nand others, the staff produced its first\n\nCreative Writing Edition.\n\nMiss Colvin deserves high commen-\n\ndation for her untiring efforts and un-\n\ncommon interest in the fuUfillmenl of\n\na need and a dream envisioned by Dean\n\nLester, lo whom the edition is dedi-\n\ncated.\n\nIt is hoped that the Creaiive Writing\n\nEdition will become an annual publi-\n\ncation growing in scope and quality\n\nas SSC's student body grows in ap-\n\npreciation for self-expression. It is\n\nhope<l that it will become \"an Inspir-\n\nit^ tribute to Dean Lester's high ideals\n\nand splendid example.\" It is a project\n\nborn of a few minds and realized by\n\nthe concerted efforis of many minds\n\nand influences.\n\nWe are especially appreciative lo\n\nthose ai<ling ihis endeavor and we are\n\nsincerely grateful for the kind expres-\n\nsions of approval lo a step in the stu-\n\ndent publication's climb to recognition\n\nas a leading college journal.\n\nThere is nothing like teaching.\n\nIf you like doing good deeds.\n\nEveryda> you can feel certain\n\nThai you have given lo one in need.\n\nMarch. 1932\n\nTHE TIGER'S ROAR\n\nGIRLS' BASKETBALL SQUAD\n\nFront row. left lo righl: Mildred Grahom, Audrey SpoHi, Froncio Howj.d.

The\n\nart of a people is an interpreta-\n\ntion of its interests religious, ao-\n\nial, economic, and political. Since\n\nartists are usually sensitive men,\n\ntheir works tell of the events and\n\nthe people that interest them.\n\nFrequently events of post iiges\n\nare more fascinating than those\n\nnf llic present day, and the biog-\n\nraphies of the men who produced\n\nthe great nuisterpioces may ho as\n\nobsorliing os fiction.

Speak!\n\nDog; What shall I say?\n\nBy GERTRUDE D. THOMAS\n\nDear Diary:\n\nSoon I shall hear footsteps, I\n\nshall never hear again, footsteps\n\nbelonging to students who have\n\nworn thin my halls, marred my\n\nbuildings with, \"Say what? Don't\n\nleave me. Take me with you when\n\nyou go. I'll be so lonesome when\n\nyou're gone.\" And \"Whoa back\n\nup and try it a-a-a-a-gain,\" and\n\nthe history of their love affairs.\n\nFor years these students have been\n\nwarmed by my heat, fed, in my\n\ndining hall, and housed in my dor-\n\nmitories. They have annoyed my\n\ninstructors and wasted paper and\n\ntime foolishly. But now they are\n\njoining a great mass of men and\n\nwomen who have made the world\n\nwhat it is today.\n\nAlthough you may think this is\n\na joyous occasion for me it is not.\n\nTears are blinding my eyes as I\n\nhear the last student take a last\n\nlook inside me and run to join his\n\nclassmates. His steps become more\n\nfaint and now they are fading\n\naway. My mind is blotted by mem-\n\nories of the oustanding students\n\nwho add another trophy to my pos-\n\nsessions. Bringing fame and glory\n\nto me and to them, they have added\n\nanother extra glow of pride to my\n\neyes. Many students will carry the\n\nspirit of Savannali State wherever\n\nthey go; they will help to carry\n\nfin the glory, democracy, and lead-\n\nership in a democratic school.\n\nYes. I have a right to be proud\n\nand a right to be sad. I glance\n\naround in my empty halls, in the\n\nclassrooms, in the auditorium and\n\nI am reminded of future stars. The\n\nshops, the art and music rooms, the\n\nlab, the library, and the gym, bring\n\na touch of pride to me and a tear\n\nto my eye. I am too blinded with\n\ntears to write, so I remain.\n\nSavannah State,\n\n'til my sidewaUcs start walking.\n\nGive Us A Thought\n\nBy GERTRUDE D.
