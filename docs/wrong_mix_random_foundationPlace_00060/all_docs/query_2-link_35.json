        "text": "Blepharoplasty (eye lift) opens the eye by reducing sagging tissue on the top or the bottom of your eyelid. It's one of the most common facial plastic surgeries for women ages 35 to 60 and it's also common among men. It can help create a more youthful appearance.\n\nAs we age, the skin around our eyes can become loose and sag. Upper lid blepharoplasty removes extra skin around the eye. Sometimes a brow lift can help as well if the brow is sagging.\n\nBulges or fat pockets on the lower eye lids can happen with aging or from family traits. Lower lid blepharoplasty means removing and moving these fatty skin tissues around the eye to give a smoother, younger appearance.\n\nA facelift lifts skin or soft tissue to address aging changes, such as jowls and sunken cheeks, to rejuvenate the skin or create a more youthful appearance. We also do mini facelifts and deep plane facelifts.\n\nFacelifts are tailored to each patient and usually use a combination of hidden incisions (cuts) within the hairline, behind the ear, along the front of the ear, inside the mouth and under the chin.\n\nA mini facelift lifts skin or soft tissue to address aging changes, such as jowls and sunken cheeks, to create a more youthful appearance. We suggest this choice if you're looking for less downtime compared to the recovery time after a traditional facelift.\n\nMini facelifts are tailored to each patient and usually use a combination of hidden incisions within the hairline, behind the ear, along the front of the ear, inside the mouth and under the chin.\n\nSeptoplasty uses an incision hidden inside the nose to straighten a crooked septum (the tissue between the nostrils that separates them).\n\nA crooked septum can block a nostril and impair breathing. It can also lead to bloody noses and sleep apnea. The surgery helps improve your breathing with no outside incisions (cuts).\n\nCare choices for men require special attention to masculine features. As we age, the fat and other soft tissue in our face can fall and create wrinkles as well as a loosening of skin on the neck and jawline.\n\nSpecialized face and necklifts for men often focus on the lower face and neckline with attention to the beard area as well."
