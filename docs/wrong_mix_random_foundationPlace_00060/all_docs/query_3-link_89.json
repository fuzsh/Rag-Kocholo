        "text": "Two Is Double Great And More!\n\nSo happy they came color coded so I could tell them apart when I just wasn’t sure with a quick glance! Andrea and Kerstin Schulze, identical twins from the start and in many ways all through life. Both wonderful people with superb attitudes based on friendship, caring and love and a hugely positive outlook on life.\n\nBoth beautiful women 6 ft tall, who have built a life of fitness and competition. Different in that Kerstin has sought her career in fitness competition and acting, which has now seen her in many roles and big time real commercials. Andrea just now winning her first fitness competition, however the “go to person” if you need a multi million dollar data center built! So if you had any stereotypical ideas of gorgeous tall beautiful fitness women in your head… that ends here!\n\nFrom our recent photo shoot in Palm Springs… The double duty Makeup and Hair styling by premier Estee Lauder artist Blanche LeBeau. My Hasselblad digital camera system and Broncolor lighting. Always the best! Thanks!\n\nJune 15, 2017 | Categories: Uncategorized | Tags: Broncolor, fitness competition, fitness lifestyle, fitness photogrpaher, fitness women, gorgeous twin women, Hasselblad, HasselbladBron, identical twins, lifestyle photo shoot, lifestyle photographer, MUA, Palm Springs photographer | Leave a comment\n\nBTS Details\n\nGetting lots of questions about my studio shoot last week with NYC fashion model Nora Zainglein. It was in a studio near downtown Los Angeles at the Brewery Arts District which is very cool I must say. Had not been there in many years.\n\nSome of the really important details are the people I get to work with. Blanche LeBeau is a premier Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist working around the world with Estee Lauder. I cannot begin to tell you how lucky I am to have her enjoy shooting with me. This shoot was even more fun with her talent of body painting! Very Thankful for Blanche LeBeau!\n\nThen there is my newer buddy Harmoni Everett. Wow is she a find! Harmoni is best friends with another best friend of mine, a most gorgeous professional model, actress and beautiful woman. Harmoni has been a professional model, a successful actress and has worked in producing photo shoots. And is a wonderful photographer herself. She not only worked with me on this photo shoot as my assistant carrying and moving heavy stuff, but also wardrobe ideas and shooting behind the scenes photos. On top of all that we photographed Harmoni too and those photos are astonishing! She is wonderfully creative! You will see those photos soon.\n\nThen there is Nora and she is wonderful. Blanche introduced me to photos of Nora probably a year ago or more and I said then that I really was looking forward to photographing her. This is now our second photo shoot together and she is just perfection. Nora looks incredible in front of the camera, knows her stuff, easy and so very fun to work with. I adore this woman!\n\nIt is the people you work with who are so very very important! Now people always say it is the photographer and not the gear that makes great photographs. And that is certainly true. But for me I do not like to short change what I do or what I do for my clients. So I go with the best gear possible. It is just what I do.\n\nMy camera system for these types of shoots for me is Hasselblad. I have always admired Hasselblad cameras and the images they produce. And the history of Hasselblad creating the photographs, the most memorable in history including going into Outer Space and to the Moon. Only sorry I didn’t start with Hasselblad sooner in my shooting. Then there is my lighting gear, Broncolor. For any number of reasons moving up to Broncolor is like going from a great car to a Rolls Royce or Ferrari. There is just nothing else like it.\n\nI will not say that I am a great photographer but I can say I give it all I have got all the way around. So my results are quality, consistency and sometimes really great photographs. And I always try to make sure that everyone has fun doing it! That is my behind the scenes details on this and many of my photo shoots. Thanks!\n\nJune 14, 2017 | Categories: Uncategorized | Tags: advertising photographer, behind the scenes, body paint, Broncolor, BTS details, edgy fashion, famousbtsmag, fashion model, fashion photographer, Hasselbald, HasselbladBron, MUA, Palm Springs photographer, sexy photo shoot, studio photo shoot | Leave a comment\n\nShe Didn’t Hear Me\n\nIf you read my prior post just below, you know about my chance meeting with Nora Zainglein at the Salton Sea. Also especially lucky that I had my Hasselblad camera with me. Just one of those things when you meet a New York City fashion model dancing around a pole on a vacant road. It is all true! Trust me!\n\nSo we drove down a dirt road I know which takes you to a somewhat hidden way to get on the shore of the Sea. Nora seemed to have a wardrobe idea for this spot and changed by the car. Makeup and hair had been somehow perfectly readied by the premier Estee Lauder artist Blanche LeBeau.\n\nNo one there of course and the Salton Sea was beautiful in it’s usual eerie sort of way. Noon and the Sun was high and the temperature hot. Nora embraced the feel and view of it all. Just having been in Manhattan the day before made it quite the scenic change for her. Amused by the long line along the shore of mummified Tilapia, I was sure that thoughts of lunch were not on her mind.\n\nWalking along she raised her face to the Sun and closed her eyes. I said “Nora what are you thinking about?”… She didn’t hear me.\n\nMore to come…\n\nApril 24, 2017 | Categories: Uncategorized | Tags: beautiful face, beauty portrait, fashion editorial, fashion model, fashion photographer, fashion photography, Hasselblad, HasselbladBron, lingerie model, lingerie on the beach, lingerie photo shoot, makeup styling, MUA, New York City model, New York fashion model, Salton Sea, sexy girl | 1 Comment"
