Uninvited was the second in ICOM's series of point and click adventure games which were developed first in black & white for the Macintosh and were later converted to other popular 16-bit platforms. It was released in 1989 through Mindscape.

Uninvited involves you stumbling out of your exploding car in search of your post-car crash lost brother. A rather spooky house is the only abode for miles, and it could be the only place your little brother could have gone...

Like all other ICOM games, control is enabled through the mouse. There is no text entry parser to this game - it can either be clicked on or it can't. The interface is based on a windows based GUI, where you can click on objects, and then drag them into your inventory, you give them to characters you may meet in the game etc. You inventory itself is arranged into windows. Commands are entered by first selecting a verb, found above the current screen, and then clicking on an object, character, whatever in the screen. Some experimentation will ensure you'll get used to the interface in no time.

I thought ICOM adventures were generally good, but they always had some annoying real time consideration and if you didn't overcome it, it pretty much meant 'Game Over'. In the case Uninvited, it's making sure the spirit dwelling within the mansion doesn't end up possessing you. I've included a hints file however, that will help the more impatient adventurer.
