        "text": "Uninvited is part biographical, with real experiences with rejection, and part self-help to help other women overcome their own experiences of feeling left out; familiar real-life experiences like the childhood neglect of a father and comparing yourself to others and feeling lesser than. Exposing the foundation of rejection, Uninvited showcases just what happens when we allow our experiences to impact our relationships with God and others.\n\nWe have a choice in controlling our responses to others by implementing God-glorifying methods to work through our pain. Being rejected affects us deeply, and when we allow our past hurt to make us needy we must \"walk into situations prepared with the fullness of God in me, free to look for ways to bless others\" (p. 45). Others may overlook you, but ultimately, the love of God has destined us for a relationship that does not uninvite or reject us."
