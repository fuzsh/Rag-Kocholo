Denzer addresses complex themes in a subtle fashion by using elements...\n\n“As reality creates itself, unforeseeable and new, its image reflects behind it into the indefinite past.”\n\nA few useful terms for artistic research\n\nKarin Harrasser\n\nOnce upon a time, a fairytale was told over the centuries, time and again, in the chronicles of the Global North.
