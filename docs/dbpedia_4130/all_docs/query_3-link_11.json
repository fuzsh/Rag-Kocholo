However, the notes should only be treated for references and changes should be made according to the needs of the students.\n\nSummary\n\nThe poem starts by saying that every house where people have lived is haunted. Here, “houses” is our physical existence, and being “haunted” means we’re left with permanent impressions from the people we’ve known. These influences hover quietly like ghosts, often going unnoticed but still leaving their mark.\n\nLongfellow suggests that these impressions are always present, appearing at various stages and transitions in life – in doorways, on stairs, and through passages. He is saying that at any given time, we are only conscious of a fraction of these influences. However, beneath the surface, our minds are crammed with memories, imprints, and echoes of past bonds, similar to a hall filled with polite, harmless spectres.\n\nThe experiences and recollections of our interactions are deeply personal. An outsider might only see someone’s present self, but that person feels acutely their whole backstory and the many forces shaping their current views and emotions.\n\nWhile we may feel ownership over our experiences and memories, Longfellow claims true ownership is hard to grasp. People from our past, even those forgotten, keep swaying our choices, perceptions, and sense of self.\n\nThe poem then zooms out to a bigger metaphysical perspective – that an ethereal realm of memories and old impacts envelops our tangible existence. This realm profoundly enriches our daily lives, giving depth and dimension to our present understanding.\n\nOur lives are depicted as a delicate balance of past influences, some tugging us towards base desires, others lifting us towards higher aims. This balance is maintained by unseen or subtle influences, which Longfellow poetically compares to undiscovered stars or planets.\n\nUsing the moon as a metaphor, the poet stresses how past influences can light our path, guiding us through the vast expanse of life’s journey even as we head into the unknown.\n\nLine-by-line explanation of the poem\n\nAll houses wherein men have lived and diedAre haunted houses.\n\nHere, the term “houses” is a metaphor for our bodies or lives, and being “haunted” indicates the indelible mark or influence left by the people we encounter. Just as every house has its history, every person carries the memories and impacts of past relationships and interactions.\n\nThrough the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.\n\nOpen doors signify moments of vulnerability or openness in our lives. The “harmless phantoms” symbolise individuals who’ve passed through our lives, sometimes unnoticed or unacknowledged, leaving subtle but meaningful imprints. Their silent movements suggest that often, the full depth of their influence isn’t immediately evident.\n\nWe meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,\n\nThe various places mentioned (door-way, stair, passages) allude to the different phases and transitional moments in our lives. These people affect us at varying intensities and at different times, but their impact remains, even if it’s as elusive as “impressions on the air.”\n\nThere are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,\n\nOur conscious mind (the “table”) often only acknowledges a fraction of the influences and memories we carry. However, our subconscious (the “illuminated hall”) is filled with countless past interactions, represented here by the “quiet, inoffensive ghosts”.\n\nThe stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.\n\nOur experiences, memories, and the impact of past relationships are deeply personal. Others might only see our current state, but we are vividly aware of our history and the multitude of influences that shape our present perception and feelings.\n\nWe have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.\n\nThis suggests that while we may feel ownership over our bodies and lives, we don’t truly own the influences and memories within us. People from our past, even those long forgotten, continue to impact our choices and perceptions.\n\nThe spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapours denseA vital breath of more ethereal air.\n\nThe “spirit-world” signifies the realm of memories and past influences that envelope our tangible existence. This ethereal realm breathes life into our daily experiences, enriching our understanding and perspective.\n\nOur little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.\n\nOur lives are in a constant state of balance, shaped by both our baser instincts and higher aspirations. These instincts are influenced by the varied people we encounter, some pulling us toward momentary pleasures and others elevating us toward greater goals.\n\nThese perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.\n\nOur internal conflicts, the battle between our desires and aspirations, often arise from hidden or unacknowledged influences. This “unseen star” or “undiscovered planet” symbolises those powerful yet unrecognised people or moments that guide our inner compass.\n\nAnd as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,\n\nThis picturesque imagery depicts how past influences can serve as guiding lights, much like how the moon illuminates a path across the sea. It emphasises the idea that our past shapes and influences our journey, even into the unknown.\n\nSo from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.\n\nBuilding on the previous imagery, this concludes the poem by suggesting that the world of past influences (or spirits) provides a connection to our present. As we navigate our lives, our decisions and feelings are continually shaped by those who’ve left their mark on us.\n\nWord meanings\n\nHaunted: In this context, it means deeply influenced or pervaded by memories or impressions of people from the past.\n\nHouses: Representing the lives or bodies of individuals.

Works like “The Song of Hiawatha,” based on Native American oral traditions, and “Paul Revere’s Ride,” celebrating a pivotal moment in the Revolutionary War, cemented Longfellow’s status as a chronicler of the American experience.\n\nIn “Haunted Houses,” the “phantoms” are not vengeful spirits or mischievous poltergeists; they are the lingering memories and influences of people now gone. Longfellow suggests these spectral impressions quietly share our spaces and activities, observing our daily lives. Though we may not actively notice them, the ghosts of loved ones remain connected to us, floating through our consciousness.\n\nThe gentle, singsong rhythm and rhyme scheme, along with Longfellow’s peaceful tone, evoke solace rather than fear. His assertion that all houses are “haunted” is a reassuring acknowledgement that those we’ve lost can still inhabit our lives and thoughts, as long as we hold them in our memories. Rather than a frightening concept, Longfellow presents a vision of haunting that is comforting – our departed loved ones never truly leave us, but remain imprinted on our hearts and woven into the fabric of our lives.\n\nWorkbook answers/solutions\n\nMultiple Choice Questions (MCQs)\n\n1.

Through the open doors\n\nThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,\n\nWith feet that make no sound upon thefloors\n\n(i) What kind of opening statement is made by the poet?\n\nAnswer: The poet makes a metaphorical opening statement, suggesting that all individuals carry with them the indelible influences of people they have known throughout their lives, akin to how houses are “haunted” by the spirits of those who have lived and died in them.\n\n(ii) In what way are all houses ‘haunted’?\n\nAnswer: The ‘haunted’ houses represent individuals’ lives marked by the enduring presence and influences of people they have encountered, whose memories and impacts linger like harmless phantoms.\n\n(iii) The phrase ‘harmless phantoms’ seems to be exceptional. Why?\n\nAnswer: The phrase ‘harmless phantoms’ is exceptional because it reframes the typical notion of haunting, portraying these enduring influences as benign rather than malevolent, emphasizing their subtle, often unnoticed presence in our lives.\n\n(iv) What kind of the spirit-world is conceived by the poet later in the context?\n\nAnswer: The poet later conceptualizes the spirit-world as a benign, ethereal layer surrounding our everyday existence, where the quiet influences of past associations float around us, enriching our lives without direct visibility or acknowledgment.\n\n(v) Where can we, according to the poet, meet ghosts?\n\nAnswer: According to the poet, we encounter these ‘ghosts’—the lingering influences of past associations—in everyday moments and places, such as at the doorway, on the stair, and along the passages of our lives, subtly impacting our thoughts and actions.\n\nPASSAGE-2 We meet them at the doorway, on the stair,\n\nAlong the passages they come and go,\n\nImpalpable impressions on the air,\n\nA sense of something moving to and fro.\n\n(i) What kind of ghosts are conceived by the poet earlier in the context?\n\nAnswer: Earlier in the context, the poet conceived of ‘ghosts’ as the benign, invisible impressions left by people we’ve known, affecting our lives in quiet, often unnoticed ways.\n\n(ii) Where do we ‘meet’ them? Are they visible?\n\nAnswer: We ‘meet’ these ‘ghosts’ in the metaphorical spaces of our existence—our memories and experiences—where they influence us subtly, not visible to the eye but felt in the heart and mind.\n\n(iii) Explain the last two lines.\n\nAnswer: The last two lines express that these influences are intangible, like impressions on the air, felt rather than seen, as a sensed presence or impact moving through our lives, guiding or affecting us in unseen ways.\n\n(iv) Which figure of speech is used in Line 3?\n\nAnswer: In Line 3, a metaphor is used, likening the intangible influences of people in our lives to ‘impalpable impressions on the air’, emphasizing their unseen yet felt presence.\n\n(v) Where do they ‘throng’, as mentioned later in the context?\n\nAnswer: As mentioned later, these influences ‘throng’ our mental and emotional spaces, particularly during moments of reflection or decision-making, much like quiet, inoffensive ghosts filling an illuminated hall, silently shaping our lives.\n\nPASSAGE-3 There are more guests at table than the hosts\n\nInvited; the illuminated hall\n\nIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,\n\nAs silent as the pictures on the wall.\n\n(i) Who are uninvited guests at table?\n\nAnswer: The uninvited guests at the table metaphorically represent the unexpected, often unconscious influences of people from our past, whose memories and impacts join us in the journey of life without formal acknowledgment.\n\n(ii) Why are they there uninvited?\n\nAnswer: They are there uninvited because their influences on us were not consciously chosen but naturally accrued over time, shaping our thoughts and actions subtly, like guests who have silently taken their place at the table of our lives.\n\n(iii) What is surprising about these uninvited ghosts?\n\nAnswer: What is surprising about these uninvited ‘ghosts’ is their benign presence, contradicting the typically ominous connotation of hauntings, and highlighting how these influences can quietly enrich our lives, unnoticed yet impactful.\n\n(iv) Which figure of speech is used in the last line here?\n\nAnswer: The figure of speech used in the last line is a simile, comparing the silent influence of these ‘ghosts’ to the silence of pictures on the wall, underscoring their quiet yet pervasive presence in our lives.\n\n(v) What can the speaker see and hear which others cannot, as referred to later in the context?\n\nAnswer: The speaker, perhaps more introspective or sensitive, can perceive the subtle impacts and presences of these ‘ghosts’—the enduring influences of past relationships—more acutely than others, seeing and hearing their guidance and impact where others may not.\n\nPASSAGE-4 The stranger at my fireside cannot see\n\nTheforms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;\n\nHe but perceives what is; while unto me\n\nAll that has been is visible and clear.\n\n(i) What contrast is made in the first two lines here?\n\nAnswer: The contrast made in the first two lines highlights the difference between the speaker’s ability to perceive the subtle influences and memories of past associations, likened to seeing and hearing ‘ghosts’, and a stranger’s inability to perceive beyond the tangible present.\n\n(ii) What do you think of the extraordinary powers of the speaker?\n\nAnswer: The speaker’s ‘extraordinary powers’ suggest a heightened sensitivity or awareness to the layered complexities of human existence, enabling them to perceive the enduring impacts of past relationships and experiences that others might overlook.\n\n(iii) What has been told by the speaker about the unseen ‘forms’ earlier in the context?\n\nAnswer: Earlier in the context, the speaker described the unseen ‘forms’ as the benign, invisible presences of people who have left an indelible mark on our lives, their influences felt as ‘impalpable impressions on the air’ or a sensed presence moving through our existence.\n\n(iv) ‘All that has been is visible and clear. Explain.\n\nAnswer: ‘All that has been is visible and clear’ conveys the idea that the speaker possesses a profound connection to their past, with the ability to clearly perceive and reflect upon the impacts of past relationships and experiences, as if these elements were still present and tangible.\n\n(v) Who is ‘He’ in Line 3? Is he a normal human being?\n\nAnswer: ‘He’ in Line 3 refers to a stranger or any individual other than the speaker, presumably a normal human being who perceives the world in a more conventional, less introspective manner, focusing on the physical reality rather than the nuanced influences of past associations.\n\nPASSAGE-5 We have no title-deeds to house or lands;\n\nOwners and occupants of earlier dates\n\nFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,\n\nAnd hold in mortmain still their old estates.\n\n(i) What conception of ghosts is given earlier in the context?\n\nAnswer: Earlier in the context, ‘ghosts’ are conceived as metaphorical representations of the lasting influences and memories of people we’ve known, shaping our thoughts and lives in subtle, often unnoticed ways.\n\n(ii) Where can we ‘meet’ the departed spirits?\n\nAnswer: We ‘meet’ the departed spirits in the corridors of our memories and experiences, where their influence persists as if they still occupied a place in our lives, impacting us in unseen but significant ways.\n\n(iii) Who do not have title-deeds to their ‘house or lands’?\n\nAnswer: In the metaphorical sense, individuals do not have permanent title-deeds to their ‘house or lands’, suggesting that our lives and the impacts we make are not owned or fixed but are part of a larger continuum of influence and memory.\n\n(iv) What do the departed spirits claim from their graves?\n\nAnswer: From their graves, the departed spirits claim a continuing connection to the living world, asserting a metaphorical ‘ownership’ or presence within the lives they’ve touched, much like holding onto their influence from beyond.\n\n(v) Explain the phrase ‘hold in mortmain’.\n\nAnswer: The phrase ‘hold in mortmain’ refers to the enduring grip or influence the departed have on the living, suggesting that their impacts and memories hold a place in our lives with a permanence that transcends legal or physical ownership.\n\nPASSAGE-6 The spirit-world around this world of sense\n\nFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhere\n\nWafts through these earthly mists and vapours dense\n\nA vital breath of more ethereal air.\n\n(i) Why does the poet describe all houses as haunted earlier in the context?\n\nAnswer: The poet describes all houses as ‘haunted’ to metaphorically express the idea that everyone carries with them the enduring influences of people they have encountered, shaping their being in a manner akin to spirits inhabiting a house.\n\n(ii) How have the ghosts been described by the poet?\n\nAnswer: The ‘ghosts’ have been described by the poet as benign and intangible presences—memories and influences of past relationships that hover around us, subtly shaping our lives and decisions without direct visibility.\n\n(iii) What can the speaker see or hear?\n\nAnswer: The speaker can see and hear the quiet, often unnoticed impacts of these metaphorical ‘ghosts’, perceiving the nuanced layers of influence and memory that shape the fabric of their existence.\n\n(iv) What kind of the world of spirits is?\n\nAnswer: The world of spirits is described as a delicate, ethereal realm that surrounds

How does Longfellow describe all houses where men have lived and died?\n\nAnswer: Longfellow poetically refers to all houses where men have lived and died as “haunted houses.” In this context, the term “haunted” doesn’t refer to ghostly apparitions in the traditional spooky sense. Instead, it evokes the idea that memories, emotions, and experiences of the past inhabitants still linger, making their presence felt in subtle and profound ways.\n\n44. In what ways does Longfellow challenge traditional notions of the supernatural in this poem?\n\nAnswer: Instead of presenting the supernatural as something fearful or malevolent, Longfellow depicts it as a benign and ever-present influence. The “harmless phantoms” and “quiet, inoffensive ghosts” stand in contrast to traditional ghostly figures that haunt and terrorize. Longfellow’s ghosts are simply remnants of the past, memories and influences that permeate our lives.
