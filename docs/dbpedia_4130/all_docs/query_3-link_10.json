        "text": "The Poem in Detail\n\nStanza 1\n\nThe speaker begins with a simple but surprising statement that all houses in which men have lived and died are haunted, i.e, they are visited by the ghosts or spirits of earlier occupants. The poet has dispelled the conventional image of ghosts by describing them as ‘harmless phantoms’ who are busy with errands and move purposefully around the house as they did when they were living, Further, they come and 80 without making any sound.\n\nStanza 2\n\nThe speaker says that these ghosts are ‘impressions on the air’ that cannot be felt ( by touch ). They can be present anywhere in the house: at the doorway, on the stairs or along the passage when they come and go. Though they cannot be seen , their presence is felt as a ‘sense of something, moving to and fro.\n\nStanza 3\n\nTheir presence can be perceived when they join the guests at the dining table and make the number of guests more than those invited by the hosts. In fact , the brightly lit hall appears crowded by these uninvited guests, who remain as silent as the pictures or portraits hung on the wall.\n\nStanza 4\n\nThe speaker then goes on to say that a stranger or guest, sitting with the speaker by the fireplace, is unable to perceive their presence as the speaker does. The speaker is the one, who can see their form (i.e. the impression of their presence) and hear their sounds. He believes that the stranger can only see what is happening in the present but he can see everything clearly from the past to the present. This is perhaps suggestive of the fact that the stranger is the present occupant of the house.\n\nStanza 5\n\nThe speaker asserts that we (living human beings) do not have any permanent ‘title-deeds’ for our houses and lands. This is because those who were the owners and occupants earlier spread their soiled hands from the forgotten graves to claim the inalienable ownership of the properties once owned by them. In other words, the earlier occupants dug their way out of their graves that were unattended and neglected to return to their homes.\n\nStanza 6\n\nThe world of spirits floats around the human world of ‘senses’ (or reality) like the air of the atmosphere envelops the earth. This world (i.e. the spirit world) passes through everything like earthly mists and dense vapours. It is like the vital breath of delicate air from the other world.\n\nStanza 7\n\nThe speaker here talks about human lives. He says that human lives are short and are kept in balance by maintaining ‘opposite attractions and desires.’ There are two types of instincts—base instincts, that seek worldly pleasures and enjoyment and noble instincts, that aspire for higher and noble goals and spiritual aims. Human beings have to learn to deal with these contradictory impulses to achieve equipoise or balance in life.\n\nStanza 8\n\nThe speaker describes the cause of anxiety and fears in human beings. According to the speaker mental disturbances, anxieties and fears of human beings are the result of their earthly needs and high aspirations. These are not the creation of human beings but are shaped by some unknown forces from a remote planet in the universe.\n\nStanza 9\n\nThe speaker says that as the moon comes out of the dark clouds, its light falls on the sea waves and forms a floating bridge of light. Human imagination travels across the planks of this ‘trembling’ bridge into a dark and mysterious world. This bridge connects us (humans) to the spirits of our loved ones, who have gone long ago.\n\nStanza 10\n\nThe speaker says that there is a bridge of light that connects the world of spirits’ to the floating bridge created by the moonlight on the surface of the seas. Only spirits are able to cross this bridge. Our thoughts, i.e. our memories float on the unsteady floor of this bridge that is above a dark abyss. The memories of our loved ones keep us connected to them long after they are gone. These memories keep the living from falling into deep sorrow that is like a dark abyss. The poem thus ends on a comforting and reassuring note.\n\n1.

What kind of houses are these?\n\nAnswer :- The narrator suggests that all houses where people have lived and died are haunted because they carry the memories, experiences, and emotions of their former inhabitants. These houses serve as repositories of human history, capturing the essence of past lives within their walls. The term “haunted” here doesn’t necessarily imply malevolent spirits or ghostly apparitions but rather the lingering presence of the past. It encompasses the collective energy, stories, and emotions embedded in the fabric of these dwellings, making them repositories of both joy and sorrow, love and loss.\n\n(iI) Who are the harmless phantoms? How are these phantoms different from the usual image of the phantoms?\n\nAnswer :- The harmless phantoms mentioned in the poem are the residual spirits or echoes of the past occupants. Unlike conventional depictions of phantoms as menacing or frightening entities, these phantoms are portrayed as benign and non-threatening. They symbolize the enduring essence of human existence, quietly inhabiting the spaces where they once lived and roamed. Their presence is subtle, marked by their silent movements and intangible nature, yet they carry the weight of history within them, silently bearing witness to the passage of time.\n\n(iII) What ‘errands’ are done by these phantoms? Are their errands different from the known errands of phantoms? How?\n\nAnswer :- The term “errands” used in the poem refers metaphorically to the movements or activities of the spirits within the haunted houses. These errands are not literal tasks but rather symbolic representations of the residual energy and presence of the past. The phantoms glide through the open doors of the houses, moving with a sense of purposelessness yet carrying the weight of memory and existence. Their actions are ethereal and intangible, reflecting the transient nature of human life and the enduring imprint it leaves behind.\n\n(iV) At what places in the houses are these phantoms found as described later in the poem? How do they enter the house?\n\nAnswer :- The phantoms described in the poem are found traversing the various spaces within the haunted houses. They move silently through the open doors, their footsteps making no sound upon the floors. These spirits are not confined to specific areas but rather inhabit the entire dwelling, symbolizing the pervasive nature of memory and history. They enter the house through the open doors, suggesting a seamless connection between the past and the present, the living and the dead.\n\n(v) Explain briefly how this extract suggests the title of the poem.\n\nAnswer :- This extract sets the tone for the overarching theme of the poem, which explores the idea of haunted houses as repositories of human experience and memory. By asserting that all houses where people have lived and died are haunted, the narrator suggests that the essence of human existence transcends physical boundaries. The title “Haunted Houses” encapsulates this notion, emphasizing the enduring presence of the past within the spaces we inhabit. It invites readers to contemplate the layers of history and emotion embedded in the places we call home, highlighting the profound impact of human life on the places we inhabit.\n\n(i) Why are there more guests at the table? How do these uninvited guests behave at the table?\n\nAnswer :- The presence of more guests at the table than hosts symbolizes the idea that the house is inhabited not only by the living but also by the spirits of the departed. These uninvited guests, representing the spirits of those who have passed away, behave quietly and respectfully at the table, much like the hosts and other guests. Despite being uninvited, they coexist peacefully with the living occupants of the house, contributing to the sense of quiet and serenity within the illuminated hall.\n\n(iI) Why are they described as ‘quiet’ and inoffensive” ? State two other traits of the ghosts described in the poem.\n\nAnswer :- The ghosts are described as “quiet” and “inoffensive” because they do not disturb or disrupt the atmosphere of the gathering. They behave with decorum and restraint, blending seamlessly into the ambiance of the illuminated hall. Additionally, two other traits of the ghosts described in the poem include their ethereal nature and their intangibility. They are depicted as incorporeal beings, existing beyond the physical realm, and as such, their presence is felt rather than seen or heard.\n\n(iII) Why are they ‘as silent as the pictures on the wall’? Whose ‘pictures’ are they?\n\nAnswer :- The ghosts are compared to the pictures on the wall to emphasize their silent and immaterial nature. Like the pictures, which hang silently on the wall, the ghosts inhabit the space without making any noise or commotion. The reference to the “pictures on the wall” suggests that these ghosts are as still and unobtrusive as the static images captured in the frames. The pictures may represent past occupants of the house, further reinforcing the connection between the living and the dead within the space.\n\n(iV) Which figure of speech is used in this extract? Explain this figure of speech.\n\nAnswer :- The figure of speech used in this extract is a simile, as indicated by the phrase “as silent as the pictures on the wall.” A simile is a literary device that makes a comparison between two unlike things using the words “like” or “as.” In this case, the behavior of the ghosts is compared to the silence of the pictures on the wall, highlighting their quiet and unobtrusive presence within the illuminated hall.\n\n(v) In this extract, there is a reference to ‘more guests’. What is said in the extract that shows that they are uninvited?\n\nAnswer :- The reference to “more guests at table than the hosts” suggests that there is an imbalance in the number of living occupants compared to the spirits of the departed. This implies that the ghosts are uninvited or unexpected guests, as their presence exceeds the anticipated number of attendees. Despite being uninvited, they coexist peacefully with the living, contributing to the sense of quiet and serenity within the hall.\n\n(i) Who are ‘We’ referred to in this extract? Why they do not have ‘title-deeds to house or lands”\n\nAnswer :- The “We” referred to in this extract likely represents the current inhabitants or occupants of the houses and lands described in the poem. They do not have “title-deeds to house or lands” because their ownership or occupancy is not legally documented or established. This lack of official documentation may be due to various reasons, such as historical circumstances or changes in ownership over time.\n\n(II) Who are the ‘Owners and Occupants of earlier dates?\n\nAnswer :- The “Owners and Occupants of earlier dates” are the individuals or entities who previously owned or inhabited the houses and lands mentioned in the poem. These earlier owners and occupants may have lived in the properties long ago, and their presence is now represented by the spirits or ghosts that haunt the spaces.\n\n(iII) Explain the line — ‘From graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands’ with reference to the poem.\n\nAnswer :- The line “From graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands” suggests that the spirits of the former owners and occupants reach out from their forgotten graves to assert their connection to the houses and lands they once possessed. This imagery evokes a sense of the past reaching into the present, highlighting the enduring influence of the deceased on the properties they once owned or inhabited.\n\n(iV) Who ‘hold in mortmain still their old estates? Why?\n\nAnswer :- The phrase “hold in mortmain still their old estates” refers to the legal concept of mortmain, which denotes the perpetual holding of property by a corporation or institution, typically associated with religious bodies. In this context, it metaphorically suggests that the spirits of the deceased continue to exert a lasting influence or ownership over their former estates, even from beyond the grave. This reflects the idea that the dead retain a connection to the properties they once owned or occupied, despite the passage of time.\n\n(v) Explain briefly two poetic devices used in this extract with examples.\n\nAnswer :- Two poetic devices used in this extract are:\n\nMetaphor: The phrase “stretch their dusty hands” employs metaphor to liken the outstretched hands of the spirits to dusty hands emerging from forgotten graves. This metaphorical imagery conveys the idea of the past reaching into the present and emphasizes the enduring connection between the deceased and the properties they once owned.\n\nPersonification: The concept of “hold[ing] in mortmain still their old estates” personifies the old estates, attributing to them the human-like quality of being held or possessed. This personification imbues the estates with agency and emphasizes their enduring significance, despite the passage of time and changes in ownership.\n\n(I) Whose Little lives’ are referred to in the first line of the extract? In comparison to whom are they ‘little’ and why?\n\nAnswer :- The phrase “Our little lives” refers to the lives of human beings in general. They are described as “little” in comparison to broader concepts like time, history, or the universe. This characterization emphasizes the brevity and insignificance of individual human lives in the grand scheme of things.\n\n(iI) How is balance maintained in their short lives?\n\nAnswer :- Balance is maintained in their short lives by “opposite attractions and desires.” This suggests that human beings experience conflicting impulses or desires that pull them in different directions. Despite these opposing forces, a sense of equilibrium is achieved through the interplay of these attractions and desires.\n\n(iII) What are the two types of instincts referred to in this extract? Give examples of each type.\n\nAnswer :- The two types of instincts referred to in this extract are:\n\nThe instinct that enjoys: This instinct represents human desires or impulses that are driven by immediate gratification or pleasure. For example, indulging in leisure activities, seeking comfort, or pursuing material possessions can be manifestations of this instinct.\n\nThe more noble instinct that aspires: This instinct embodies higher aspirations or ideals that transcend immediate gratification and prioritize long-term goals, personal growth, or moral values. Examples include striving for excellence, pursuing knowledge, or acting selflessly for the greater good.\n\n(iV) What is the reason for the struggle between the two types of instincts? How is this struggle resolved?\n\nAnswer :- The struggle between these two types of instincts arises from the tension between short-term gratification and long-term fulfillment. Human beings often face dilemmas where they must choose between satisfying immediate desires and pursuing higher ideals or aspirations. This struggle is resolved through introspection, self-discipline, and the cultivation of virtues like patience, resilience, and self-control. By aligning their actions with their deeper values and aspirations, individuals can navigate this internal conflict and achieve a sense of harmony or balance in their lives.\n\n(v) Explain briefly the rhyme scheme used in this poem with examples. What role does it play in the poem?\n\nAnswer :- ( For Full Answers Get The Workbook Answers PDF – View )"
