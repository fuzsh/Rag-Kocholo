        "text": "A Question\n\nWe are living through hard and dark times. Sometimes the evil in the world overwhelms ( I won’t call it the ‘darkness’, as I love the dark, how it shows us our small place in the universe. I find peace in the dark, and do not like the way it has been appropriated to represent the evils humans do in the bold light of day)\n\nYesterday I was asked a question which floored me, for a while. The question was asked by Marie Irshad, during an interview for a podcast that will be aired next year. The question was, ‘what brings you joy?’ A simple question, but hard to fathom and hard to answer. One of the answers is this, below:\n\nWalking on the land, watching and thinking. Cooking for friends. But perhaps this brings me quiet peace of mind, rather than ‘joy’. And then there is this, a new making, a collaboration with my friend Eva John, to make a ‘charm’ bracelet that really is a charm:\n\nMade in silver, mine says: full moon, owl flight, stone speaks, witch light. It circles my wrist asleep or awake. Feels like a true charm. We have our first commission to make one for someone else, and in its way this brings me joy. Collaborative crafting. But again, is it joy, or simply peace of mind? Finding the words, making a charm?\n\nSo, I want to ask you, what brings you joy? Please leave a comment below to tell me. ( All comments need to be actioned by me, so won’t appear straight away) I will choose people at random to contact and send a postcard to, one like these, from The Unwinding Cards, that I have doodled on.\n\nThe Unwinding cards are drawn from the book The Unwinding. Cards and books can be bought from Solva Woollen Mill, Seven Fables, though a warning, The Unwinding is in short supply and soon there will be no stock available. There are plenty of Silent Unwindings, the companion book that allows you to draw and write your own words. I’ve been loving using the Unwinding Cards in a similar way. ( and, while I am talking about Eva, who makes the silver charms for and with me, she is also the same Eva who wrote the Explorer’s notes for The Lost Words, and has also written Unwinding notes, to give prompts for how to use the Silent Unwinding. They are kind of beautiful, and while they may not bring joy, again they help settle the heart and the mind to focus on creativity.\n\nWhat brings me joy? The flight of birds. Stars, rich in a dark sky. Beautiful art and beauty created by people. Music. Catching falling leaves in autumn. I need to spend some time thinking about this, and so I ask, tell me, what brings you joy? Take a moment to think. It’s a good thing to dwell on. And leave your answer below as a comment."
