        "text": "July 9, 2023\n\nThis would've been great if it was a novella.\n\nThe story just doesn't work as a full length thriller as it isn't much. It's more about the psychological scenes and the villains' background.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nThis is a gripping psychological thriller.\n\nJohn arrives at Becky and Roger’s home and invites himself along to Sunday dinner.\n\nHe persuades Becky that she knows him as he’s a friend of her husband and before she knows it he’s inside the house and she’s tied up on the floor.\n\nWhen Roger arrives home he’s soon taken by surprise and joins Becky in being tied up, waiting for their daughter and her husband to arrive.\n\nSoon all four of them are sitting round the table, tied up and wondering what the hell is going on.\n\nJohn knows their secrets and is there to punish more than one of them.\n\nA gripping thriller.\n\nThanks to Bloodhound Books for the opportunity to read this book.\n\nJuly 27, 2022\n\n\"'But do you know the worst thing about living in such a beautiful rural house like this? A secluded house like this? Do you know the one real pitfall of this set-up?’ She shook her head, her eyes suddenly rounder and eyebrows higher than they should be. I quickly bent in close, so that my mouth almost touched her face, and her hair tickled my cheek. I whispered in her ear. ‘The worst thing about living here, Rebecca, is that no one can hear you scream.’ Then I headbutted her, right between the eyes.\"\n\nThis story hooked me in the first few pages. \"John\" was both frightening and wholly intriguing. He's the everyday nightmare; the normal-looking guy who slips in unnoticed and destroys every semblance of safety. This story ebbed and flowed. There were so many revelations that had my chin hitting the floor and it quickly morphed into something I hadn't expected. A pretty darn good read with so many twists but a lot of grit.\n\nJune 1, 2022\n\nI enjoyed this suspenseful story. This is well written story about what happens at one family meal. The things that are said cannot be unsaid as well as the things that happen. You don't want to miss what happens at this family dinner for sure. I enjoyed how the characters pulled me into the story from the beginning. This is a fast paced, action filled story that is hard to put down. The growth of the plot is great and made the story easy to read. I enjoyed the twists and turns that had me coming back for more. I really enjoyed reading this book. I look forward to seeing what is next for this author. I highly recommend this book.\n\nMay 15, 2022\n\nThe book is based on a fairly simple idea of a house invasion - but , for me, it failed to deliver. Where it failed is in the character development. I didn’t really care what happened to any of the characters - and that wasn’t because they were all flawed individuals. The author didn’t build the characters sufficiently- I felt ambivalent toward them all.\n\nThe plot was a bit weak and the story and events dragged too much.\n\nSo overall I wouldn’t recommend the book unfortunately\n\nJuly 19, 2022\n\nThank you Bloodhound books for the copy in exchange for a honest review. The Twist are having a family sunday lunch when they have a unexpected visitor. Their lunch soon becomes a nightmare with the appearance of John. Roger, Becky, their daughter Lucy and her husband Frank are tied up and made to tell their dark secrets. A cleverly written thriller with a twist you won't see coming.\n\nJune 11, 2022\n\nRubbish\n\nA dreadfully written, ridiculous story. None of the characters were believable and the dialogue unconvincing.\n\nLost the will to live while reading this-not worth the 99p I spent on it.\n\nAugust 10, 2022\n\nNot recommended for anyone\n\nI just did not like this book at all! I did finish it because I kept hoping to find a reason that I read it at all. I never found it.\n\nJune 1, 2024\n\nCouldn't put it down.\n\nThis was a really great character study. All the characters were seriously unlikeable but also compelling and I want to know what happened next. It's nice to read a domestic thriller that doesn't conform to the usual tropes.\n\nThe vibe of the book reminded me a lot of An Inspector Calls or something similar when the stranger comes to confront them about the awful things they are doing. As a result I didn't have a problem suspending my disbelief as it wasn't meant to be that realistic.\n\nThere was a bit in chapter 22 at the start where it started at 1st person and then goes back to 3rd which I felt should have been edited to be in 3rd like the rest of the book. I also saw a handful of other typos. The description of Lucy at the start seemed misogynistic at first tbh but as I read along I started to see why it was written like that and Lucy became one of my favourite characters.\n\nHowever these issues did not affect my enjoyment. I finished this book in a day and it is a book I will remember for a long time.\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n•••Uninvited by Jocelyn Dexter // 3 out of 5 stars•••\n\nThe first half of this book really had me excited to read. I was on the edge of my seat, and there were even quite a few humorous parts. The second half quickly became tiresome, and I just couldn’t wait to get to the end. I feel like the twist didn’t really land for me either, making the end not really pay off.\n\nMay 8, 2022\n\nThe truth is a dish best served cold.\n\nRebecca and Roger Twist, daughter and son in law Lucy and Frank are having a family dinner they will never forget.\n\nJohn turns up uninvited he has a knife he has them tied up, who is this man, none of them have a clue, Rebecca should not have let him in, held hostage by a lunatic, lots of secret's and twisty moments will enfold as you read, how does this stranger know so much about this family? it's not for money, it's all about revenge, I had to keep reading on.\n\nSo creepy, and gave me so many OH GOSH! moment, how much worse can it get?\n\nA family pretending, a cosy life, when in reality were all living their own private hells, and John is dishing out the punishment.\n\nThis is one slap bang amazing book, that readers wont be able to put down, I know it was hard for me to.\n\nI never expected half of the chapters and so lots of I never saw that coming right to the very end.\n\nIt's certainly a WOW read that will have the readers hooked.\n\nAbsolutely brilliant will blow your mind away.\n\nTop five stars all round for me.\n\nJuly 15, 2022\n\nUninvited by Jocelyn Dexter.\n\nA routine family meal turns into a nightmare in this terrifying thriller by the author of Shh . . .The respectable, middle-class Twist family is settling in for their usual Sunday lunch. Husband and wife, Roger and Becky, are there, along with their daughter, Lucy, and her husband, Frank. But then, they are joined by an uninvited guest . . .His name is John, and he knows everything about them—including their darkest secrets. After he manipulates his way into the house, John soon has them bound at their wrists and ankles. But what is the agenda of this twisted stranger?One by one, their hidden pasts will be revealed and horrific events will unfold—and bit by bit, the family’s captor will unveil the shocking truth about his motivation. Will any of them survive the nightmare?\n\nOmg. Dark and twisted. I wasn't sure if I liked the characters. Becky Frank Lucy. I know I didn't trust John. Definitely recommend. 5*.\n\nMay 11, 2022\n\nWhen John turns up uninvited for Sunday lunch and barges his way into the Twist’s house, a time of terror begins.\n\nRebecca, Roger, their daughter Lucy and son in law, Frank are forced to share their deepest and darkest secrets with each other in order to survive. Just how far will John go to get the truth?\n\nMy goodness, this story had me gripped from start to finish. A creepy thriller that turned my stomach at times! I found myself pro Rebecca throughout, she was a mama bear where her daughter was concerned and was not taking anything lying down!\n\nThis is a tale of secrets, lies and revenge. Definitely a book that I would highly recommend.\n\nMay 10, 2022\n\nFull stars for keeping me mesmerised throughout. A cracking read!\n\nI warmed to the uninvited....John (strangely enough!) He intrigued me. I was on the edge of my seat dying to find out what his intentions were. They were obviously not good! But the big question was...why? The story focused on one family, one room, with one uninvited maliputive, unemotional and dangerous stranger. My word it was tense! He does have a way of weeding secrets out of people, all for their own good....obviously. A creative, gripping and thrilling read.\n\nMay 19, 2022\n\nThe novel starts with a bang. Immediately I was drawn into the story.\n\nIt's a story of secrets and the uninvited guest John knows the families darkest secrets. He makes them tell their stories one by one.\n\nIt's an unremitting violent story. The family have no redeeming qualities at all. Though the story is gripping.\n\nI read this as an ARC from the publisher the review is my own opinion\n\nJuly 8, 2022\n\nKinda terrible if i’m honest. First 100 pages were good, i was hooked but after Rogers secret was told, it went completely downhill. The ending was just so underwhelming and annoying, i literally hate Becky so much. She’s such an unlikable character and in the end she just becomes what she hates like…what? Another book i regret reading.\n\nMay 28, 2022\n\nThis story is about secrets and control. It also is not for the faint of heart as there is cussing and gore in it. It really wasn't what I expected from the blurb, but I managed to finish it. Was it my 'cup of tea'? Not really. I voluntarily reviewed an ARC of this book.\n\nJune 13, 2022\n\nCouple of days of my life I won't get back\n\nIt started well, I thought but descended into something that I didn't like. It was a heartless book featuring a psychopath and some really unlikable characters and I wish I hadn't read it. The end.\n\nJune 30, 2022\n\nA stranger invites himself to dinner.\n\nBoring. Uses more words than necessary. Murders because he likes it Could have been a good book based on the storyline. Hopes the ending will be enough for a sequel...no such luck. Don't waste your time. I'm sorry I did.\n\nMay 18, 2022\n\nI highly recommend this unputdownable thriller about the secrets we all have. This book will stay with me for a long time.\n\nJune 4, 2022\n\nWell-written characters and plenty of secrets, lies, and suspense makes this book quite the page turner. I voluntarily reviewed an advance readers copy of this book.\n\nDecember 8, 2022\n\nStarted off very interesting, however, had to stop at 75% of the book. Long, rambling stories got so boring I couldn't do it anymore. I have never quit a book while at the 75% mark!\n\nNovember 13, 2023\n\nI didn’t love the ending, but I really did enjoy this book.\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nCould’ve been so good, just too much meat and not enough excitement to carry anyone through the last half of the book 😴\n\nAugust 5, 2024\n\nPretty good but lost me at the end. Reminds me a lot of Funny Games. 3.5 stars\n\nMay 31, 2022\n\nAs Rebecca was preparing Sunday lunch, the doorbell rang. When she answered it, there was a man there, she didn’t recognise him but he said he knew her husband, Roger. Before she knew it, he had stepped into the house and her good manners stopped her from asking him to leave. He maneuvered himself into the kitchen and then into the dining room, intimating that Roger had invited him to lunch. Before she knew it, she was tied up and laying on the floor with an apple in her mouth so she couldn’t make a sound.\n\nAt 2pm Roger arrived home from the pub and I was awaiting him, just inside the front door with a knife and some string. When he entered, he called out to his wife and then he saw me. I instructed him to put the string around his neck and led him to the dining room where he saw his wife lying on the floor. I then tied them both to the chairs at the table so they couldn’t move, handcuffed their hands and we awaited the arrival of Lucy and Frank, their daughter and son-in-law.\n\nA little later, Lucy and Frank arrive. Lucy has keys so uses them to open the door and I am there with the knife straight to her throat to control her and get Frank to put the string around his neck and handcuff his hands. I lead them through to the dining room and tie them up to the chairs and handcuff Lucy.\n\nMy name is John and I know so much about family. I know their darkest secrets and today they will be shared amongst us all. Just how well does this family know each other? Will anyone survive this afternoon?\n\nI really enjoyed reading this book, it was very intriguing. It gripped me from the start and I read it in two sittings. It was well written and very descriptive. This is the second book I have read by this author and I enjoy her stories, they are very dark.\n\nRead\n\nJune 2, 2022\n\nJohn, an unremarkable man enters Rebecca Twists home and hospitably she offers him a drink. He knocks her out and ties her up, leaving her on the floor.Her husband returns, sees her then collapses so John also ties himm up. The same fate lies in store for daughter Lucy and her husband Frank. Lucy is the more dynamic of the pair . Frank is silent through guilt because he had talked about the family to John in the pub. Since then John appointed himself judge, jury and executioner.\n\nThe detestable, cruel and unfeeling Roger Twist admits to visiting prostitutes and behaving brutally towards them, particularly to one named Candi. he showd no remorse to his wife and daughter and his confession sealed his fate. Rebecca and Lucy confess their bser secrets, leaving Frank to wonder what on earth he'd done. John enlightened him by stating they were brothers and revealed a family history Frank was unaware of. His mother was called Hermione but he knew nothing about her. That made him a candidate to die. Rebecca attacks John who retaliates and leaves her body on the floor as he assaults Lucy and Frank. Rebecca regains consciousness and flies at John who dies. Eighteen months later Rebecca had stewed on the information he'd given about his mother Hermione and plans what she will do to her when she meets up with her. These characters are all depicted competently, especially Roger who was absolutely contemptible. I understood Rebecca's emotions but thought Lucy could have been more supportive instead of being as shallow as she was. Frank loved her but leaned on her when it should have been the other way round. I thought the idea behind the plot was unusual, but more contemporary than \"And Then There Were None\" and was engrossing and intriguing. . .Janet Williamson\n\nAugust 1, 2022\n\nBRILLIANT but this is definitely not one for the faint-hearted.\n\nLet “John” into your house and it may just be the last thing you ever do.\n\nNot only does he know ALL of your secrets, he will use them against you, against your family, and will have you turning on each other. The Twist family are his latest “puppets” that he intends to play with. The game he plays is a brutal and deadly one.\n\nBut in front of the right people, and when he needs to be, he can come across as charming. Gaining your trust and having you opening up to him, and telling him your secrets. While unbeknownst to you this is all part of his bigger plan.\n\nThere is one part in the storyline that actually had me liking him; until I was brought back to reality.\n\nThis is so very cleverly written. The author draws you into the mind of the most disturbed mind that one could ever come across. One that you definitely wouldn’t want to.\n\nHe is an incredibly intelligent individual who is master of all he does. He does his research so meticulously, and creates perfect opportunities for those he has a grievance with. Meanwhile leaving absolutely nothing to chance.\n\nAs the book reaches its horrifying conclusion; and in this his latest “game”, it is a lot more personal than any of the others.\n\nMay 30, 2022\n\nWhat an excellent read, I really enjoyed reading this book it drew me in and I was unable to put it down. As I finished each chapter, I said to myself only 1 more chapter and then I will get up needless to say I got nothing done this weekend.\n\nThe story focuses on the Twist family, who always get together on a Sunday to have a family lunch. While Rebecca is preparing the dinner and waiting for everyone to arrive there is an unexpected visitor, John. Rebecca answers the door, the John worms his way into the house pretending that Rebecca’s husband invited him, once in the house he ties her up in the dinning room. He then proceeds to wait at the door for her husband Roger to arrive home and quickly ties him up in the dinning room, once Lucy their daughter and son in law Frank arrive and are tied up their ordeal starts.\n\nAfter having had a sandwich for lunch he brings them all into the living room he tells them he knows a lot about them, and knows they have a secret which they need to confess in front of everyone.\n\nWill they comply with this, or will they refuse him? I would definitely recommend this book it was a real page turner for me."
