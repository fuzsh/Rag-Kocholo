Show me how you can possibly ignore it.\n\n– ml\n\n2021\n\nPainting by Michael Leunig, Desert Song Man\n\nleunig.com.au\n\n–\n\nIt must have been more than 50 years ago.\n\nI was a newbie meditator and yogini when my teacher threw this curved ball:\n\n“Pray for disappointment.\n\nDisappointment is the highest teacher.”\n\nGulp. I thought I was signing up for Transcendence 101, not some advanced course in self-mortification.\n\nPlease explain, I asked, and she did:\n\nDisappointment will unpick your stories.\n\nIt will shatter your certitudes.\n\nIt will strip you of hope.\n\nIt will lead you to the other side of the assumptions you unknowingly live by.\n\n(It will be a huge shock to realise that the only free and true choice you can ever make is to stop, shut up, listen and open.)\n\nIf you can live with its inevitability, it will deliver you to unbreakable peace and equanimity. You will understand the real meaning of trust and you will make impermanence your touchstone.\n\nNo fatalism or nihilism involved – no ‘isms’ whatsoever.\n\nNo ideology, therapy or frantic god-bothering required.\n\n{ pure gold }\n\nWell, as it happened, she was right.\n\nDid I ever offer up a prayer of invitation to disappointment?\n\nNot that I recall, but I’ve always been a bit contrary, and I was definitely curious.\n\nEveryone was hunting for the enlightenment cookie via his or her own tendencies and patterns – I guess I was too. In hindsight it’s clear that my fierce wild-maned Cincinnati yoga teacher (who was managing my return to mobility after having my right leg severed in an accident) was introducing me to the Via Negativa, to the ancient Vedic Neti Neti inquiry.\n\nAnd so far as the gods of disappointment were concerned,\n\nmy ingenuous curiosity was enough to catch their attention.\n\nOff I went, from one knee-grazer to the next.\n\nSometimes they served up the prompt in the midst of the mishap, accident, heartache, bust-up, betrayal, rejection. Sometimes it would show up in the aftermath. But it never failed to arrive, scribbled in gold on the back of an increasingly tattered calling card:\n\nWhat knows this,\n\nceaselessly, inescapably,\n\nwhile remaining entirely unaffected?\n\na h h h h h . . .\n\ns y s t e m – r e s t o r e\n\n{ pure gold }\n\nI bow before disappointment’s wild grace.\n\nSpeaking personally, mls.\n\nNotes:\n\nSometimes a poem calls forth an image; sometimes an image elicits a poem. I’ve been keeping company with this Kintsugi sculpture by Billie Bond for a while, waiting to see if words might line themselves up in response to its powerful eloquence. What showed up surprised me. While I have been blessed with untold good fortune, generosity and joy in my life, I confess that it was the unspeakably harrowing experiences that opened up intimacy with the entire field of experience. So I’m posting this in case it matches the shape of a wound that needs loving attention. We all have them. And we are the world.\n\nFrom September 18, 2013: a love letter to disappointment\n\nSculpture:\n\nBillie Bond, Kintsugi Head 1, 2014\n\nH32 W22 D15\n\nBlack stoneware, resin, epoxy, gold leaf\n\nUnique\n\nhttp://www.billiebondart.com/kintsugi-sculpture.html\n\nKintsugi – “golden joinery” also known as Kintsukuroi – “golden repair”, is the ancient Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics with lacquer mixed with powdered gold. As a philosophy it sees beauty in imperfection; it treats breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise.\n\nThe knowing of Knowing\n\nis the sweetest somatic intimacy, the ultimate G[od]-spot.\n\nIt’s no wonder poets pen passionate love-notes\n\nto their beloved Beloved.\n\nIt’s more evident than any revelation,\n\nmore obvious than anything observed.\n\nYet this seamless saturation is neither an experience\n\nnor anything that could be called an attainment.\n\nIt’s prior to consciousness,\n\nto memory, to perception, to imagination.\n\n(I say “prior to” but I don’t mean a-p-a-r-t from.\n\nPerhaps precursory would be a better word.)\n\nHow mysterious that it’s completely overlooked, ignored,\n\nwhile at the same time\n\nhungered for/longed for/searched for/worked for/studied for/meditated for/practiced for/prayed for/paid for, in time, devotion and sacrifice . . .\n\nWhat a joke!\n\nNo GPS can locate it.\n\nYet it’s inescapable.\n\nI don’t need a guru, method, scripture, sledgehammer\n\nto wake up to the fact that whatever I am\n\nis unarguably and precisely whatever I perceive, experience, feel.\n\nI only have to look from a silent mind.\n\nTo acknowledge this Knowing –\n\nto abide as it, to act as it –\n\nrestores me to the all-inclusive immensity\n\nI knew all along.\n\nAll along.\n\nSince breath #1 was gasped on a summer’s morning in 1944\n\nand these innocent eyes first opened\n\nonto the mindscape\n\nbefore\n\nwords like suffering and salvation were sown there\n\nsprouting addictive fantasies\n\nabout enlightenment, transcendence, escape\n\nbefore\n\nI was thought-washed to believe that\n\nthe embodiment of this Knowing\n\nwould erase every discomfort and dysfunction from my experience\n\nbefore\n\nthe dark net of distinctions descended\n\nbefore\n\nI learned to be clever.\n\n– miriam louisa\n\nArtwork by Jean-Michel Meurice\n\nUrgell 1, 2004\n\nAcrylic on fabric, 215 x 215cm\n\nMore info HERE\n\nI love the way this work portrays the richness of our circular existence, the dance of the dreamer around the still, silent core. It’s a wonderful example of contemporary Tantric art.\n\nIt’s been a year of farewells: a brother, an artist comrade, and now another old buddy from my peer-group has gone.\n\nAgain I meet the temporality, the impermanence of this experience of being alive.\n\nAgain something rises to state the actuality of my experience – not to comfort or console, but to remind myself that everything appearing is a window onto the everlastingly unaffected.\n\nSo what?\n\nSo that whatever life dishes up has some small chance of being met with honesty and presence. So that I might be sane enough to remember that my wishes – no matter how profound – have nothing to do with what-is. So that I might see directly, act appropriately.\n\nI’m ok with old age. The need to change anything falls away. Candles in the wind.\n\nYet (occasionally) (rarely these days) I’m moved to share a confession. You never can tell, it might be the last one. And there are things I want to say before I go.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nThis is what I love about fog:\n\nspace is rendered opaque\n\nso I get to see\n\nCreation’s cauldron,\n\nto see the emptiness I ordinarily move through\n\noblivious\n\nto its strange solidity.\n\nI had it all back to front –\n\nassuming my solidity and its, well, nothingness.\n\nOne night a few months ago I asked how\n\nDōgen’s “aware space” *\n\nmight be made evident, physically perceivable,\n\nexperience-able beyond conceptualization\n\nand next morning I woke up to thick fog.\n\nI thought, OK let’s color it pink\n\nto make it even more evident\n\n– no problem for a visual mind like mine –\n\nbut then I noticed that my hands,\n\nthe exhalation of my breath,\n\nmy table, my room, my coffee,\n\neverything was permeated with pinkness.\n\nIn high school science class I was taught:\n\nAn atom consists of 99.9999999999996% “empty space”\n\nand should all the “empty space”\n\nbe vacuumed out of one’s body\n\nthe solid matter remaining would fit\n\non the point of a pin.\n\n(Along with all those dancing quantum angels.)\n\nAnd I lost it, almost wet myself laughing . . .\n\n“You mean . . .?”\n\nI’m leaving it to you, dear reader,\n\nto join the dots for yourself.\n\nIf you do, you’ll never again be puzzled\n\nby the paradox of the Prajñāpāramitā.\n\n– – –\n\nThat’s how teachings arrive for me:\n\na question goes out\n\nand the universe serves a set-up\n\nperfectly calibrated for comprehension\n\nby this old cow’s unique version\n\nof craziness.\n\nMu!\n\nPainting by UK artist Alan Perriman, Fog – one of a series where he sets out to express in visual language a short Japanese poem.\n\nBecause fog engulfs\n\nthe house where I am\n\nI feel as though\n\nI have floated into the sky\n\n– Myōe\n\n1173-1232\n\nalanperriman.co.uk\n\n* Dōgen’s “Aware Space”:\n\nI was sitting with a commentary on Dōgen zenji’s Being Time, given by Anzan Hoshin roshi.\n\nHe said, “Dōgen is pointing out the way Aware Space embodies itself as each of you, and how each of you unfold yourselves as each other and as all things, as all beings, all times, all worlds.”\n\nGulp. God I love Dōgen.\n\nWhite Wind Zen Community, Ottawa."
