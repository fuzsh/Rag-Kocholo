        "text": "Well defined images and good style, but the limit of 4 colours per scene makes things a bit dreary. But maybe dreariness fits this old mansion.\n\nMusic and sound are almost non-existent. Occasionally you hear a sound such as a smash or explosion, which are not terribly well done. There is also a generic March of the dead tune when you die, which you've heard a million times before in early 80's games.\n\nA spooky little retro game with a gripping mystery and a good writing. Highly recommended if you like this sort of thing."
