        "text": "“Rejection steals the best of who I am by reinforcing the worst of what’s been said to me.”\n\nIn Uninvited, Lysa shares her own deeply personal experiences of rejection— from the perceived judgment of the perfectly toned woman one elliptical over to the incredibly painful childhood abandonment by her father. She leans in to honestly examine the roots of rejection, as well as rejection’s ability to poison relationships from the inside out, including our relationship with God. With biblical depth, gut-honest vulnerability, and refreshing wit, Lysa will help you:\n\nStop feeling left out by believing that even when you are overlooked by others you are handpicked by God.\n\nChange your tendency to either fall apart or control the actions of others by embracing God-honoring ways to process your hurt.\n\nKnow exactly what to pray for the next ten days to steady your soul and restore your confidence in the midst of rejection.\n\nOvercome the two core fears that feed your insecurities by understanding the secret of belonging.\n\nUninvited reminds us we are destined for a love that can never be diminished, tarnished, shaken, or taken—a love that does not reject or uninvite.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nLysa TerKeurst is the president of Proverbs 31 Ministries and the New York Times bestselling author of Uninvited and The Best Yes. She writes from her sticky farm table and lives with her family in North Carolina. Connect with her at www.LysaTerKeurst.com or on social media @LysaTerKeurst.\n\nFind Lysa online:"
