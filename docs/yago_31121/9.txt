Introduced as the estranged mother of Johannes von Lahnstein, Mimi appears together with her granddaughter Maximiliane Frei. After pretending to be someone else to get to know her family again, Mimi grows very found of Johannes' daughter Nico. In the meanwhile, Johannes would not forgive his mother for leaving him all those years ago and wants her out of his life. Mimi feels sorry for what happened back then, but as she tries to make her son understand, her marriage to his father Dietrich became loveless and she just was not happy with her life as a Socialite. Johannes still felt resentful, but eventually let his mother back into his life by saying that he has always thought about her. As the two develop a better relationship, Mimi gets the chance for an adventure in Africa. Johannes is disappointed to see his mother leave again, but leaves with her on good terms. Eventually, Nico decides to go along with Mimi and they both leave together.

After Nico returns only several months later, it is mentioned that Mimi is still well and travels through the world. Nico later even rejoins her grandmother for another adventure, where the two also visited Thailand. When her twin-sister Jana Brandner died, Nico returns to DÃ¼sseldorf and also mourns the death of Johannes, who has been presumed dead after his plane went lost from the radar. At that time, Mimi is not seen nor mentioned by anyone. Nico takes off again and returns in spring of 2010, where Mimi has already died and made Nico to her main heir. She starts exhibitions with her grandmother's work, which take the interest of a money-less prince, Philipp zu Hohenfelden, who in the beginning tries to con Nico before falling in love and eventually marrying her.
