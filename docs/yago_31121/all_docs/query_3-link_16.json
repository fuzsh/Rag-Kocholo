He's married to their mother Annegret. Walter first appears in June 1995, when he has to sell his stud farm to Christoph von Anstetten. Tanja is angry with her father that he doesn't see another way to hold on to their property and takes the promise of young Jan Brandner that she always can visit her horse at Castle Friedenau. This is the perfect invitation for Tanja into a world of wealth and power. Tanja burns all bridges with her hated family.\n\nWhen Tanja's mother Annegret reappears in 2008, she tells her daughter that Walter died. Annegret wants to reconcile with Tanja, when a family secret comes out. Tanja spent years in psychiatric care, after she was held responsible for Thomas' tragic death. Annegret admits that it was Walter who took the life of Thomas by pushing him down the stairs. Tanja makes it perfectly clear that her parents were never there for her and wants Annegret to leave. After one last attempt to reunite with Tanja, Annegret decides to commit suicide.\n\nIn 2011, Tanja is hunted by her father's ghost, after she gets locked in an ice cellar from Rebecca von Lahnstein. The hallucinations tell Tanja that she's worthless and will always be alone. Walter tells his daughter that she will have no other than him and that he will never leave her alone. Tanja is scared out of her mind and breaks down in tears when Sebastian finds her. After resting under Sebastian's watch, Tanja is all alone again when she wakes up and hunted by Walter once again. Tanja wants to make sure to get rid of her father and starts to mix up reality with her hallucinations. She buys a gun in order to murder Walter, but instead shoots Sebastian who in her mind she sees as Walter. Tanja is shocked about her doing and is glad when Sebastian wants to hear her story. Tanja tells Sebastian about the abuse, the death of Thomas and her two years in a psychiatric institution. In the end Sebastian promises her that she never has to fear anything ever again."
