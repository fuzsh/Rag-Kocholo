        "text": "Whispering Gallery Optical Resonator Spectroscopic Probe and Method\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAnderson, Mark S. (Inventor)\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDisclosed herein is a spectroscopic probe comprising at least one whispering gallery mode optical resonator disposed on a support, the whispering gallery mode optical resonator comprising a continuous outer surface having a cross section comprising a first diameter and a second diameter, wherein the first diameter is greater than the second diameter. A method of measuring a Raman spectrum and an Infra-red spectrum of an analyte using the spectroscopic probe is also disclosed.\n\nSurface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Using Silica Whispering-Gallery Mode Resonators\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAnderson, Mark S.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe motivation of this work was to have robust spectroscopic sensors for sensitive detection and chemical analysis of organic and molecular compounds. The solution is to use silica sphere optical resonators to provide surface-enhanced spectroscopic signal. Whispering-gallery mode (WGM) resonators made from silica microspheres were used for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) without coupling to a plasmonic mechanism. Large Raman signal enhancement is observed by exclusively using 5.08-micron silica spheres with 785-nm laser excitation. The advantage of this non-plasmonic approach is that the active substrate is chemically inert silica, thermally stable, and relatively simple to fabricate. The Raman signal enhancement is broadly applicable to a wide range of molecular functional groups including aliphatic hydrocarbons, siloxanes, and esters. Applications include trace organic analysis, particularly for in situ planetary instruments that require robust sensors with consistent response.\n\nSolvatochromism of 9,10-phenanthrenequinone: An electronic and resonance Raman spectroscopic study\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRavi Kumar, Venkatraman; Rajkumar, Nagappan; Umapathy, Siva, E-mail: umapathy@ipc.iisc.ernet.in\n\n2015-01-14\n\nSolvent effects play a vital role in various chemical, physical, and biological processes. To gain a fundamental understanding of the solute-solvent interactions and their implications on the energy level re-ordering and structure, UV-VIS absorption, resonance Raman spectroscopic, and density functional theory calculation studies on 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PQ) in different solvents of diverse solvent polarity has been carried out. The solvatochromic analysis of the absorption spectra of PQ in protic dipolar solvents suggests that the longest (1n-Ï{sup 1}*; S{sub 1} state) and the shorter (1Ï-Ï{sup 1}*; S{sub 2} state) wavelength band undergoes a hypsochromic and bathochromic shift due to intermolecular hydrogen bondmoreÂ Â» weakening and strengthening, respectively. It also indicates that hydrogen bonding plays a major role in the differential solvation of the S{sub 2} state relative to the ground state. Raman excitation profiles of PQ (400â1800 cm{sup â1}) in various solvents followed their corresponding absorption spectra therefore the enhancements on resonant excitation are from single-state rather than mixed states. The hyperchromism of the longer wavelength band is attributed to intensity borrowing from the nearby allowed electronic transition through vibronic coupling. Computational calculation with C{sub 2Î½} symmetry constraint on the S{sub 2} state resulted in an imaginary frequency along the low-frequency out-of-plane torsional modes involving the C=O site and therefore, we hypothesize that this mode could be involved in the vibronic coupling.Â«Â less\n\nRapid identification of single microbes by various Raman spectroscopic techniques\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRÃ¶sch, Petra; Harz, Michaela; Schmitt, Michael; Peschke, Klaus-Dieter; Ronneberger, Olaf; Burkhardt, Hans; Motzkus, Hans-Walter; Lankers, Markus; Hofer, Stefan; Thiele, Hans; Popp, JÃ¼rgen\n\n2006-02-01\n\nA fast and unambiguous identification of microorganisms is necessary not only for medical purposes but also in technical processes such as the production of pharmaceuticals. Conventional microbiological identification methods are based on the morphology and the ability of microbes to grow under different conditions on various cultivation media depending on their biochemical properties. These methods require pure cultures which need cultivation of at least 6 h but normally much longer. Recently also additional methods to identify bacteria are established e.g. mass spectroscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), flow cytometry or fluorescence spectroscopy. Alternative approaches for the identification of microorganisms are vibrational spectroscopic techniques. With Raman spectroscopy a spectroscopic fingerprint of the microorganisms can be achieved. Using UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy (UVRR) macromolecules like DNA/RNA and proteins are resonantly enhanced. With an excitation wavelength of e.g. 244 nm it is possible to determine the ratio of guanine/cytosine to all DNA bases which allows a genotypic identification of microorganisms. The application of UVRR requires a large amount of microorganisms (> 10 6 cells) e.g. at least a micro colony. For the analysis of single cells micro-Raman spectroscopy with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm can be used. Here, the obtained information is from all type of molecules inside the cells which lead to a chemotaxonomic identification. In this contribution we show how wavelength dependent Raman spectroscopy yields significant molecular information applicable for the identification of microorganisms on a single cell level.\n\nAbsorption and resonance Raman characteristics of Î²-carotene in water-ethanol mixtures, emulsion and hydrogel\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeinhardt-Wollweber, Merve; Suhr, Christian; Kniggendorf, Ann-Kathrin; Roth, Bernhard\n\n2018-05-01\n\nAbsorption or resonance Raman scattering are often used to identify and even quantify carotenoids in situ. We studied the absorption spectra, the Raman spectra and their resonance behavior of Î²-carotene in different molecular environments set up as mixtures from lipid (emulsion) and non-polar (ethanol) solvents and a polar component (water) with regard to their application as references for in situ measurement. We show how both absorption profiles and resonance spectra of Î²-carotene strongly depend on the molecular environment. Most notably, our data suggests that the characteristic bathochromic absorption peak of J-aggregates does not contribute to carotenoid resonance conditions, and show how the Raman shift of the C=C stretching mode is dependent on both, the molecular environment and the excitation wavelength. Overall, the spectroscopic data collected here is highly relevant for the interpretation of in situ spectroscopic data in terms of carotenoid identification and quantification by resonance Raman spectroscopy as well as the preparation of reference samples. In particular, our data promotes careful consideration of appropriate molecular environment for reference samples.\n\nPerspective: Two-dimensional resonance Raman spectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMolesky, Brian P.; Guo, Zhenkun; Cheshire, Thomas P.; Moran, Andrew M.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nTwo-dimensional resonance Raman (2DRR) spectroscopy has been developed for studies of photochemical reaction mechanisms and structural heterogeneity in complex systems. The 2DRR method can leverage electronic resonance enhancement to selectively probe chromophores embedded in complex environments (e.g., a cofactor in a protein). In addition, correlations between the two dimensions of the 2DRR spectrum reveal information that is not available in traditional Raman techniques. For example, distributions of reactant and product geometries can be correlated in systems that undergo chemical reactions on the femtosecond time scale. Structural heterogeneity in an ensemble may also be reflected in the 2D spectroscopic line shapes of both reactive and non-reactive systems. In this perspective article, these capabilities of 2DRR spectroscopy are discussed in the context of recent applications to the photodissociation reactions of triiodide and myoglobin. We also address key differences between the signal generation mechanisms for 2DRR and off-resonant 2D Raman spectroscopies. Most notably, it has been shown that these two techniques are subject to a tradeoff between sensitivity to anharmonicity and susceptibility to artifacts. Overall, recent experimental developments and applications of the 2DRR method suggest great potential for the future of the technique.\n\nResonance Raman spectroscopic and density functional theory study of p-nitroacetophenone (PNAP)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPei, Kemei; Ma, Yufang; Zheng, Xuming; Li, Haiyang\n\n2007-03-01\n\nResonance Raman spectra of p-nitroacetophenone(PNAP) have been obtained in resonance with the charge-transfer (CT) band using 252.7, 266 and 273.9 nm in methanol solvent. The spectra indicate that the Franck-Condon region photodissociation dynamics have multidimensional character with motion mainly along the C dbnd O stretching Î½8(1691 cm -1) and the benzene ring stretch Î½10(1593 cm -1). A preliminary resonance Raman intensity analysis was done and the results for PNAP were compared with nitrobenzene and aceptophenone. Our results indicate that -NO 2 is more photoactive than -COCH 3. The isomerization process of PNAP takes place somewhere after the wave packet leaves the Franck-Condon region.\n\nRaman spectroscopic measurements of beta-carotene and lycopene in human skin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDarvin, M. E.; Gerzonde, I.; Ey, S.; Brandt, Nikolai N.; Albrecht, Hansjoerg; Gonchukov, Sergei A.; Sterry, Wolfram; Lademann, Juergen\n\n2004-08-01\n\nThe antioxidant Î²-carotene and lycopene substances were detected non-invasively, in vivo in human skin using resonance Raman spectroscopy. Both substances were detected simultaneously. To distinguish between the substances, the Raman signals were excited at 488 nm and 514,5 nm simultaneously using a multilane Ar+ laser. The application of a fiber based optical imaging system allowed the detection of Î²-carotene and lycopene on any skin area. The disturbance of the measurements because of non-homogeneous skin pigmentation was avoided by using a measuring area of 28 mm2. The minimum power density for registration of the Raman signals and their optimum relation was determined. The Raman spectroscopic method is well suited for the evaluation of the efficacy of topically or systematically applied amounts of Î²-carotene and lycopene.\n\nUltraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy for the detection of cocaine in oral fluid\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nD'Elia, Valentina; Montalvo, Gemma; Ruiz, Carmen GarcÃ­a; Ermolenkov, Vladimir V.; Ahmed, Yasmine; Lednev, Igor K.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDetecting and quantifying cocaine in oral fluid is of significant importance for practical forensics. Up to date, mainly destructive methods or biochemical tests have been used, while spectroscopic methods were only applied to pretreated samples. In this work, the possibility of using resonance Raman spectroscopy to detect cocaine in oral fluid without pretreating samples was tested. It was found that ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy with 239-nm excitation allows for the detection of cocaine in oral fluid at 10 Î¼g/mL level. Further method development will be needed for reaching the practically useful levels of cocaine detection.\n\nStructure, spectra and antioxidant action of ascorbic acid studied by density functional theory, Raman spectroscopic and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.\n\nPubMed\n\nSingh, Gurpreet; Mohanty, B P; Saini, G S S\n\n2016-02-15\n\nStructure, vibrational and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, and antioxidant action of ascorbic acid towards hydroxyl radicals have been studied computationally and in vitro by ultraviolet-visible, nuclear magnetic resonance and vibrational spectroscopic techniques. Time dependant density functional theory calculations have been employed to specify various electronic transitions in ultraviolet-visible spectra. Observed chemical shifts and vibrational bands in nuclear magnetic resonance and vibrational spectra, respectively have been assigned with the help of calculations. Changes in the structure of ascorbic acid in aqueous phase have been examined computationally and experimentally by recording Raman spectra in aqueous medium. Theoretical calculations of the interaction between ascorbic acid molecule and hydroxyl radical predicted the formation of dehydroascorbic acid as first product, which has been confirmed by comparing its simulated spectra with the corresponding spectra of ascorbic acid in presence of hydrogen peroxide.

Binding of this heme protein to the Ag electrode or heteropolytungstates which may be regarded as simple model systems for biological interfaces establishes an equilibrium between two conformational states (I II). In state I the structure and the redox potential are the same as for the uncomplexed cytochrome c. In state II however the heme pocket assumes an open structure and the axial iron Met80 bond is weakened leading to thennal coordination equilibrium between the fivecoordinated high spin and the sixcoordinated low spin configuration. These structural changes are accompanied by a decrease of the redox potential by 420 mV. The structural rearrangement of the heme pocket in state II is presumably initiated by the dissociation of the internal salt bridge of Lys13 due to electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged surfaces of the model systems. From detailed Raman spectroscopic studies characteristic spectral properties of the states I and II were identified. Based on these findings the interactions of cytochrome c with phospholipid vesicles as well as with its physiological reaction partner cytocbrome c oxidase were analysed. A systematic study of the cytochmme c/phospholipid system by varying the lipid composition and the temperature revealed mutual structural changes in both the lipid and the protein structure.\n\nTissue Oxygenation Monitoring using Resonance Raman Spectroscopy during Hemorrhage\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2013-12-27\n\nsaturation measurements using resonance Raman intravital micros- copy.

In addition to the traditional benefits of conventional coherent Raman schemes, this approach offers a number of advantages including potentially higher emission intensity, reduction of nonresonant four-wave mixing background, preferential excitation of the anti-Stokes field, and simplified phase matching conditions. In particular, this is demonstrated in gaseous methane along the Î½1 (A1) and Î½3 (T2) vibrational levels using an infrared field tuned between 1400 and 1600 cm-1 and a 532-nm pump field. This approach has broad applications, from coherent light generation to spectroscopic remote sensing and chemically specific imaging in microscopy.\n\nLabel-Free Molecular Imaging of Biological Cells and Tissues by Linear and Nonlinear Raman Spectroscopic Approaches.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrafft, Christoph; Schmitt, Michael; Schie, Iwan W; Cialla-May, Dana; MatthÃ¤us, Christian; Bocklitz, Thomas; Popp, JÃ¼rgen\n\n2017-04-10\n\nRaman spectroscopy is an emerging technique in bioanalysis and imaging of biomaterials owing to its unique capability of generating spectroscopic fingerprints. Imaging cells and tissues by Raman microspectroscopy represents a nondestructive and label-free approach. All components of cells or tissues contribute to the Raman signals, giving rise to complex spectral signatures. Resonance Raman scattering and surface-enhanced Raman scattering can be used to enhance the signals and reduce the spectral complexity. Raman-active labels can be introduced to increase specificity and multimodality. In addition, nonlinear coherent Raman scattering methods offer higher sensitivities, which enable the rapid imaging of larger sampling areas. Finally, fiber-based imaging techniques pave the way towards inâ vivo applications of Raman spectroscopy.

For example, 2DRR spectra may reveal correlated distributions of reactant and product geometries in systems that undergo chemical reactions on the femtosecond time scale. Structural heterogeneity in an ensemble may also be reflected in the 2D spectroscopic line shapes of both reactive and non-reactive systems. In this chapter, these capabilities of 2DRR spectroscopy are discussed in the context of recent applications to the photodissociation reactions of triiodide. We show that signatures of \"vibronic coherence transfer\" in the photodissociation process can be targeted with particular 2DRR pulse sequences. Key differences between the signal generation mechanisms for 2DRR and off-resonant 2D Raman spectroscopy techniques are also addressed. Overall, recent experimental developments and applications of the 2DRR method suggest that it will be a valuable tool for elucidating ultrafast chemical reaction mechanisms.\n\nRaman Spectroscopic Imaging of the Whole Ciona intestinalis Embryo during Development\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNakamura, Mitsuru J.; Hotta, Kohji; Oka, Kotaro\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIntracellular composition and the distribution of bio-molecules play central roles in the specification of cell fates and morphogenesis during embryogenesis. Consequently, investigation of changes in the expression and distribution of bio-molecules, especially mRNAs and proteins, is an important challenge in developmental biology. Raman spectroscopic imaging, a non-invasive and label-free technique, allows simultaneous imaging of the intracellular composition and distribution of multiple bio-molecules. In this study, we explored the application of Raman spectroscopic imaging in the whole Ciona intestinalis embryo during development. Analysis of Raman spectra scattered from C. intestinalis embryos revealed a number of localized patterns of high Raman intensity within the embryo. Based on the observed distribution of bio-molecules, we succeeded in identifying the location and structure of differentiated muscle and endoderm within the whole embryo, up to the tailbud stage, in a label-free manner. Furthermore, during cell differentiation, we detected significant differences in cell state between muscle/endoderm daughter cells and daughter cells with other fates that had divided from the same mother cells; this was achieved by focusing on the Raman intensity of single Raman bands at 1002 or 1526 cmâ1, respectively. This study reports the first application of Raman spectroscopic imaging to the study of identifying and characterizing differentiating tissues in a whole chordate embryo. Our results suggest that Raman spectroscopic imaging is a feasible label-free technique for investigating the developmental process of the whole embryo of C. intestinalis.

Although it is possible to exploit the Raman effect (even striving to maximize the Raman gain to obtain Raman lasing), the present innovation is intended to satisfy a need that arises in applications in which the Raman effect inhibits the realization of the full potential of WGM resonators as frequency-selection components. Heretofore, in such applications, it has been necessary to operate high-Q WGM resonators at unattractively low power levels to prevent Raman lasing. (The Raman-lasing thresholds of WGM optical resonators are very low and are approximately proportional to Q(sup -2)). Heretofore, two ways of preventing Raman lasting at high power levels have been known, but both entail significant disadvantages: A resonator can be designed so that the optical field is spread over a relatively large mode volume to bring the power density below the threshold. For any given combination of Q and power level, there is certain mode volume wherein Raman lasing does not start. Unfortunately, a resonator that has a large mode volume also has a high spectral density, which is undesirable in a typical photonic application. A resonator can be cooled to the temperature of liquid helium, where the Raman spectrum is narrower and, therefore, the Raman gain is lower. However, liquid-helium cooling is inconvenient. The present design overcomes these disadvantages, making it possible to operate a low-spectral-density (even a single-mode) WGM resonator at a relatively high power level at room temperature, without risk of Raman lasing.\n\nSpectroscopic characterization of biological agents using FTIR, normal Raman and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLuna-Pineda, Tatiana; Soto-Feliciano, Kristina; De La Cruz-Montoya, Edwin; Pacheco LondoÃ±o, Leonardo C.; RÃ­os-VelÃ¡zquez, Carlos; HernÃ¡ndez-Rivera, Samuel P.\n\n2007-04-01\n\nFTIR, Raman spectroscopy and Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) requires a minimum of sample allows fast identification of microorganisms. The use of this technique for characterizing the spectroscopic signatures of these agents and their stimulants has recently gained considerable attention due to the fact that these techniques can be easily adapted for standoff detection from considerable distances. The techniques also show high sensitivity and selectivity and offer near real time detection duty cycles. This research focuses in laying the grounds for the spectroscopic differentiation of Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Salmonella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and E. coli, together with identification of their subspecies. In order to achieve the proponed objective, protocols to handle, cultivate and analyze the strains have been developed. Spectroscopic similarities and marked differences have been found for Spontaneous or Normal Raman spectra and for SERS using silver nanoparticles have been found. The use of principal component analysis (PCA), discriminate factor analysis (DFA) and a cluster analysis were used to evaluate the efficacy of identifying potential threat bacterial from their spectra collected on single bacteria. The DFA from the bacteria Raman spectra show a little discrimination between the diverse bacterial species however the results obtained from the SERS demonstrate to be high discrimination technique. The spectroscopic study will be extended to examine the spores produced by selected strains since these are more prone to be used as Biological Warfare Agents due to their increased mobility and possibility of airborne transport. Micro infrared spectroscopy as well as fiber coupled FTIR will also be used as possible sensors of target compounds.\n\nResonant enhancement of Raman scattering in metamaterials with hybrid electromagnetic and plasmonic resonances\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuddala, Sriram; Narayana Rao, D.; Ramakrishna, S. Anantha\n\n2016-06-01\n\nA tri-layer metamaterial perfect absorber of light, consisting of (Al/ZnS/Al) films with the top aluminum layer patterned as an array of circular disk nanoantennas, is investigated for resonantly enhancing Raman scattering from C60 fullerene molecules deposited on the metamaterial. The metamaterial is designed to have resonant bands due to plasmonic and electromagnetic resonances at the Raman pump frequency (725 nm) as well as Stokes emission bands. The Raman scattering from C60 on the metamaterial with resonantly matched bands is measured to be enhanced by an order of magnitude more than C60 on metamaterials with off-resonant absorption bands peaking at 1090 nm. The Raman pump is significantly enhanced due to the resonance with a propagating surface plasmon band, while the highly impedance-matched electromagnetic resonance is expected to couple out the Raman emission efficiently. The nature and hybridization of the plasmonic and electromagnetic resonances to form compound resonances are investigated by numerical simulations.\n\nSimulations of resonant Raman response in bundles of semiconductor carbon nanotubes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoslyak, Oleksiy; Piryatinski, Andrei; Doorn, Stephen; Haroz, Erik; Telg, Hagen; Duque, Juan; Crochet, Jared; Simpson, J.

In order to provide an insight into the experimental data, we model Raman excitation spectra using our modified discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method. The calculations account for the exciton states polarized along and across the nanotube axis that are characterized by a small energy splitting. Strong polarization of the nanotubes forming the bundle results in the exciton state mixing whose spectroscopic signatures such as peaks positions, line widths, and depolarization ratio are calculated and compared to the experiment.

The catheter, having an outer diameter of 2 mm, consisted of a side-view-type micro-Raman probe, an imaging fiber bundle, a working channel (injection drain), and a balloon. By inflating the balloon, the probe was brought close to the inner wall of a modeled blood flow system and detected a phantom target buried in the wall. Results obtained demonstrate the possibility of using the spectroscopic catheter for molecular diagnosis of coronary lesions.\n\nRaman spectroscopic analysis of the enigmatic Comper pigments.\n\nPubMed\n\nEdwards, Howell G M; Wolstenholme, Rosalind; Wilkinson, David S; Brooke, Christopher; Pepper, Michelle\n\n2007-03-01\n\nAn early church decoration project carried out by Sir Ninian Comper in 1896-98, involving the rood screen and canopy in St. Mary's, Egmanton, is currently undergoing restoration. Despite the rather prolific works of this famous ecclesiastical architect, there is little information available about the actual pigments that he used in his projects that gave rise to the special nomenclature \"Comper green\" and \"Comper red\". Specimens of green, red, black, grey, white and blue paint from this work have been made available for Raman spectroscopic analysis, and their identification has been achieved for the first time. The characteristic red and green pigments used in Comper's work, Comper green and Comper red, are both seen to be mixtures; in the former, Raman bands from chrome yellow (lead(II) chromate) and Prussian blue are identified, and the latter is confirmed as being a mixture of vermilion (mercury(II) sulfide) and barytes (barium sulfate). The other colours are found to represent a rich diversity of palette and include haematite, lead tin yellow (type II), lamp black, gypsum, anhydrite, hydrocerussite and calcite. The information from this first Raman spectroscopic study of Comper's palette will assist the conservation and restoration of an important nineteenth century church decoration.\n\nRaman spectroscopic instrumentation and plasmonic methods for material characterization\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTanaka, Kazuki\n\nThe advent of nanotechnology has led to incredible growth in how we consume, make and approach advanced materials. By exploiting nanoscale material properties, unique control of optical, thermal, mechanical, and electrical characteristics becomes possible. This thesis describes the development of a novel localized surface plasmon resonant (LSPR) color sensitive photosensor, based on functionalization of gold nanoparticles onto tianium dioxide nanowires and sensing by a metal-semiconducting nanowire-metal photodiode structure. This LSPR photosensor has been integrated into a system that incorporates Raman spectroscopy, microfluidics, optical trapping, and sorting flow cytometry into a unique material characterization system called the microfluidic optical fiber trapping Raman sorting flow cytometer (MOFTRSFC). Raman spectroscopy is utilized as a powerful molecular characterization technique used to analyze biological, mineralogical and nanomaterial samples. To combat the inherently weak Raman signal, plasmonic methods have been applied to exploit surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), increasing Raman intensity by up to 5 orders of magnitude. The resultant MOFTRSFC system is a prototype instrument that can effectively trap, analyze, and sort micron-sized dielectric particles and biological cells. Raman spectroscopy has been presented in several modalities, including the development of a portable near-infrared Raman spectrometer and other emerging technologies.\n\nStimulated Raman scattering (SRS) spectroscopic OCT (Conference Presentation)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRobles, Francisco E.; Zhou, Kevin C.; Fischer, Martin C.; Warren, Warren S.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) enables non-invasive, high-resolution, tomographic imaging of biological tissues by leveraging principles of low coherence interferometry; however, OCT lacks molecular specificity. Spectroscopic OCT (SOCT) overcomes this limitation by providing depth-resolved spectroscopic signatures of chromophores, but SOCT has been limited to a couple of endogenous molecules, namely hemoglobin and melanin. Stimulated Raman scattering, on the other hand, can provide highly specific molecular information of many endogenous species, but lacks the spatial and spectral multiplexing capabilities of SOCT. In this work we integrate the two methods, SRS and SOCT, to enable simultaneously multiplexed spatial and spectral imaging with sensitivity to many endogenous biochemical species that play an important role in biology and medicine. The method, termed SRS-SOCT, has the potential to achieve fast, volumetric, and highly sensitive label-free molecular imaging, which would be valuable for many applications. We demonstrate the approach by imaging excised human adipose tissue and detecting the lipids' Raman signatures in the high-wavenumber region. Details of this method along with validations and results will be presented.\n\nHow specific Raman spectroscopic models are: a comparative study between different cancers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSingh, S. P.; Kumar, K. Kalyan; Chowdary, M. V. P.; Maheedhar, K.; Krishna, C. Murali\n\n2010-02-01\n\nOptical spectroscopic methods are being contemplated as adjunct/ alternative to existing 'Gold standard' of cancer diagnosis, histopathological examination. Several groups are actively pursuing diagnostic applications of Ramanspectroscopy in cancers. We have developed Raman spectroscopic models for diagnosis of breast, oral, stomach, colon and larynx cancers. So far, specificity and applicability of spectral- models has been limited to particular tissue origin. In this study we have evaluated explicitly of spectroscopic-models by analyzing spectra from already developed spectralmodels representing normal and malignant tissues of breast (46), cervix (52), colon (25), larynx (53), and oral (47). Spectral data was analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using scores of factor, Mahalanobis distance and Spectral residuals as discriminating parameters. Multiparametric limit test approach was also explored. The preliminary unsupervised PCA of pooled data indicates that normal tissue types were always exclusive from their malignant counterparts. But when we consider tissue of different origin, large overlap among clusters was found. Supervised analysis by Mahalanobis distance and spectral residuals gave similar results. The 'limit test' approach where classification is based on match / mis-match of the given spectrum against all the available spectra has revealed that spectral models are very exclusive and specific. For example breast normal spectral model show matches only with breast normal spectra and mismatch to rest of the spectra. Same pattern was seen for most of spectral models. Therefore, results of the study indicate the exclusiveness and efficacy of Raman spectroscopic-models. Prospectively, these findings might open new application of Raman spectroscopic models in identifying a tumor as primary or metastatic.\n\nDual-excitation wavelength resonance Raman explosives detector\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYellampalle, Balakishore; Sluch, Mikhail; Wu, Hai-Shan; Martin, Robert; McCormick, William; Ice, Robert; Lemoff, Brian E.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nDeep-ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy (DUVRRS) is a promising approach to stand-off detection of explosive traces due to: 1) resonant enhancement of Raman cross-section, 2) Î»-4-cross-section enhancement, and 3) fluorescence and solar background free signatures. For trace detection, these signal enhancements more than offset the small penetration depth due to DUV absorption. A key challenge for stand-off sensors is to distinguish explosives, with high confidence, from a myriad of unknown background materials that may have interfering spectral peaks. To address this, we are developing a stand-off explosive sensor using DUVRRS with two simultaneous DUV excitation wavelengths. Due to complex interplay of resonant enhancement, self-absorption and laser penetration depth, significant amplitude variation is observed between corresponding Raman bands with different excitation wavelengths. These variations with excitation wavelength provide an orthogonal signature that complements the traditional Raman signature to improve specificity relative to single-excitation-wavelength techniques. As part of this effort, we are developing two novel CW DUV lasers, which have potential to be compact, and a compact dual-band high throughput DUV spectrometer, capable of simultaneous detection of Raman spectra in two spectral windows. We have also developed a highly sensitive algorithm for the detection of explosives under low signal-to-noise situations.\n\n[Progress in Raman spectroscopic measurement of methane hydrate].\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Feng; Zhu, Li-hua; Wu, Qiang; Xu, Long-jun\n\n2009-09-01\n\nComplex thermodynamics and kinetics problems are involved in the methane hydrate formation and decomposition, and these problems are crucial to understanding the mechanisms of hydrate formation and hydrate decomposition. However, it was difficult to accurately obtain such information due to the difficulty of measurement since methane hydrate is only stable under low temperature and high pressure condition, and until recent years, methane hydrate has been measured in situ using Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy, a non-destructive and non-invasive technique, is used to study vibrational modes of molecules. Studies of methane hydrate using Raman spectroscopy have been developed over the last decade. The Raman spectra of CH4 in vapor phase and in hydrate phase are presented in this paper. The progress in the research on methane hydrate formation thermodynamics, formation kinetics, decomposition kinetics and decomposition mechanism based on Raman spectroscopic measurements in the laboratory and deep sea are reviewed. Formation thermodynamic studies, including in situ observation of formation condition of methane hydrate, analysis of structure, and determination of hydrate cage occupancy and hydration numbers by using Raman spectroscopy, are emphasized. In the aspect of formation kinetics, research on variation in hydrate cage amount and methane concentration in water during the growth of hydrate using Raman spectroscopy is also introduced. For the methane hydrate decomposition, the investigation associated with decomposition mechanism, the mutative law of cage occupancy ratio and the formulation of decomposition rate in porous media are described. The important aspects for future hydrate research based on Raman spectroscopy are discussed.\n\nFourier Transform Infrared and Resonance Raman Spectroscopic Studies of Bacteriorhodopsin.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEarnest, Thomas Nixon\n\nFourier transform infrared and resonance Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the structure and function of the light-activated, transmembrane proton pump, bacteriorhodopsin, from the purple membrane of Halobacterium halobium. Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is a 27,000 dalton integral membrane protein consisting of 248 amino acids with a retinylidene chromophore. Absorption of a photon leads to the translocation of one or two protons from the inside of the cell to the outside. Resonance Raman spectroscopy allows for the study of the configuration of retinal in bR and its photointermediates by the selective enhancement of vibrational modes of the chromophore. This technique was used to determine that the chromophore is attached to lysine-216 in both the bR _{570} and the M _{412} intermediates. In bR with tyrosine-64 selectively nitrated or aminated, the chromophore appears to have the same configuration in that bR _{570} (all- trans) and M _{412} (13- cis) states as it does in unmodified bR. Polarized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) permits the study of the direction of transition dipole moments arising from molecular vibrations of the protein and the retinal chromophore. The orientation of alpha helical and beta sheet components was determined for bR with the average helical tilt found to lie mostly parallel to the membrane normal. The beta sheet structures also exhibit an IR linear dichroism for the amide I and amide II bands which suggest that the peptide backbone is mostly perpendicular to the membrane plane although it is difficult to determine whether the bands originate from sheet or turn components. The orientation of secondary structure components of the C-1 (residues 72-248) and C-2 (residues 1-71) fragments were also investigated to determine the structure of these putative membrane protein folding intermediates. Polarized, low temperature FTIR -difference spectroscopy was then used to investigate the structure of bR as it undergoes\n\nUV Resonant Raman Spectrometer with Multi-Line Laser Excitation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLambert, James L.; Kohel, James M.; Kirby, James P.; Morookian, John Michael; Pelletier, Michael J.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA Raman spectrometer employs two or more UV (ultraviolet) laser wavel engths to generate UV resonant Raman (UVRR) spectra in organic sampl es. Resonant Raman scattering results when the laser excitation is n ear an electronic transition of a molecule, and the enhancement of R aman signals can be several orders of magnitude. In addition, the Ra man cross-section is inversely proportional to the fourth power of t he wavelength, so the UV Raman emission is increased by another fact or of 16, or greater, over visible Raman emissions. The Raman-scatter ed light is collected using a high-resolution broadband spectrograph . Further suppression of the Rayleigh-scattered laser light is provi ded by custom UV notch filters.\n\nA tunable single-monochromator Raman system based on the supercontinuum laser and tunable filters for resonant Raman profile measurements.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, X-L; Liu, H-N; Tan, P-H\n\n2017-08-01\n\nResonant Raman spectroscopy requires that the wavelength of the laser used is close to that of an electronic transition. A tunable laser source and a triple spectrometer are usually necessary for resonant Raman profile measurements. However, such a system is complex with low signal throughput, which limits its wide application by scientific community. Here, a tunable micro-Raman spectroscopy system based on the supercontinuum laser, transmission grating, tunable filters, and single-stage spectrometer is introduced to measure the resonant Raman profile. The supercontinuum laser in combination with transmission grating makes a tunable excitation source with a bandwidth of sub-nanometer. Such a system exhibits continuous excitation tunability and high signal throughput. Its good performance and flexible tunability are verified by resonant Raman profile measurement of twisted bilayer graphene, which demonstrates its potential application prospect for resonant Raman spectroscopy.\n\nScytonin, a novel cyanobacterial photoprotective pigment: calculations of Raman spectroscopic biosignatures.\n\nPubMed\n\nVarnali, Tereza; Edwards, Howell G M\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe Raman spectrum of scytonin, a novel derivative of the parent scytonemin, is predicted from DFT calculations of the most stable, lowest energy, conformational structure. The diagnostic importance of this study relates to the spectral ability to discriminate between scytonemin and its derivatives alone or in admixture with geological matrices from identified characteristic Raman spectral signatures. The successful interpretation of biosignatures from a wide range of cyanobacterial extremophilic colonization in terrestrial and extraterrestrial scenarios is a fundamental requirement of the evaluation of robotic spectroscopic instrumentation in search for life missions. Scytonemin is produced exclusively by cyanobacterial colonies in environmentally stressed habitats and is widely recognized as a key target biomarker molecule in this enterprise. Here, the detailed theoretical analysis of the structure of scytonin enables a protocol to be established for the recognition of characteristic bands in its Raman spectrum and to accomplish the successful differentiation between scytonin and scytonemin as well as other scytonemin derivatives such as the dimethoxy and tetramethoxy compounds that have been isolated from cyanobacterial colonies but which have not yet been characterized spectroscopically. The results of this study will facilitate an extension of the database capability for miniaturized Raman spectrometers which will be carried on board search for life robotic missions to Mars, Europa, and Titan.\n\nResonant Raman spectra of diindenoperylene thin films\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScholz, R.; GisslÃ©n, L.; Schuster, B.-E.; Casu, M.

The comparison of excited state geometries based on time-dependent DFT or on a constrained DFT scheme with observed absorption spectra of dissolved DIP reveals that the deformation pattern deduced from constrained DFT is more reliable. Most observed Raman peaks can be assigned to calculated A_g-symmetric breathing modes of DIP or their combinations. As the position of one of the laser lines used falls into a highly structured absorption band, we have carefully analyzed the Raman excitation profile arising from the frequency dependence of the dielectric tensor.

G. M.; Moeller, R.; Jorge Villar, S. E.; Horneck, G.; Stackebrandt, E.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nExtremophiles use a range of pigments for protection against low-wavelength radiation in exposed terrestrial habitats and photoaccessory materials are synthesized for the effective harnessing of photosynthetically active radiation. Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be a useful probe for information on the survival strategies employed by extremophilic bacteria through the identification of key biomolecular signatures of the suite of protective chemicals synthesized by the organisms in stressed environments. Raman spectroscopic analyses of Bacillus spp. spores, Bacillus atrophaeus (DSM 675: deep red) and Bacillus subtilis (DSM 5611: light grey and DSM 7264: dark grey), Deinococcus radiodurans (pink) and Natronomonas pharaonis (red), of visually different pigmentation showed the presence of different carotenoids and other protectant biomolecules, which assist microorganisms against UVA radiation. The implications for the survival of extremophilic microbes in extraterrestrial habitats and for the detection of the protectant biomolecules by remote, robotic Raman spectroscopic instrumentation in an astrobiological search for life context are discussed.\n\nPhotolytic interruptions of the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle examined by time-resolved resonance raman spectroscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrieger, I; Atkinson, G H\n\n1985-09-24\n\nAn investigation of the photolytic conditions used to initiate and spectroscopically monitor the bacteriorhodopsin (BR) photocycle utilizing time-resolved resonance Raman (TR3) spectroscopy has revealed and characterized two photoinduced reactions that interrupt the thermal pathway. One reaction involves the photolytic interconversion of M-412 and M', and the other involves the direct photolytic conversion of the BR-570/K-590 photostationary mixture either to M-412 and M' or to M-like intermediates within 10 ns. The photolytic threshold conditions describing both reactions have been quantitatively measured and are discussed in terms of experimental parameters.\n\nResonance Raman spectroscopy for human cancer detection of key molecules with clinical diagnosis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, Yan; Liu, Cheng-hui; Li, Jiyou; Zhou, Lixin; He, Jingsheng; Sun, Yi; Pu, Yang; Zhu, Ke; Liu, Yulong; Li, Qingbo; Cheng, Gangge; Alfano, Robert R.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nResonance Raman (RR) has the potential to reveal the differences between cancerous and normal breast and brain tissues in vitro. This differences caused by the changes of specific biomolecules in the tissues were displayed in resonance enhanced of vibrational fingerprints. It observed that the changes of reduced collagen contents and the number of methyl may show the sub-methylation of DNA in cancer cells. Statistical theoretical models of Bayesian, principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) were used for distinguishing cancer from normal based on the RR spectral data of breast and meninges tissues yielding the diagnostic sensitivity of 80% and 90.9%, and specificity of 100% and 100%, respectively. The results demonstrated that the RR spectroscopic technique could be applied as clinical optical pathology tool with a high accuracy and reliability.\n\nRaman spectroscopic studies of hydrogen clathrate hydrates.\n\nPubMed\n\nStrobel, Timothy A; Sloan, E Dendy; Koh, Carolyn A\n\n2009-01-07\n\nRaman spectroscopic measurements of simple hydrogen and tetrahydrofuran+hydrogen sII clathrate hydrates have been performed. Both the roton and vibron bands illuminate interesting quantum dynamics of enclathrated H(2) molecules. The complex vibron region of the Raman spectrum has been interpreted by observing the change in population of these bands with temperature, measuring the absolute H(2) content as a function of pressure, and with D(2) isotopic substitution. Quadruple occupancy of the large sII clathrate cavity shows the highest H(2) vibrational frequency, followed by triple and double occupancies. Singly occupied small cavities display the lowest vibrational frequency. The vibrational frequencies of H(2) within all cavity environments are redshifted from the free gas phase value. At 76 K, the progression from ortho- to para-H(2) occurs over a relatively slow time period (days). The rotational degeneracy of H(2) molecules within the clathrate cavities is lifted, observed directly in splitting of the para-H(2) roton band. Raman spectra from H(2) and D(2) hydrates suggest that the occupancy patterns between the two hydrates are analogous, increasing confidence that D(2) is a suitable substitute for H(2). The measurements suggest that Raman is an effective and convenient method to determine the relative occupancy of hydrogen molecules in different clathrate cavities.\n\nA UV resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopic study on the extractable compounds of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris) wood .

UVRR spectra of the sapwood and heartwood hexane extracts, solid wood samples and model compounds (six resin acids, three fatty acids, a fatty acid ester, sitosterol and sitosterol acetate) were collected using excitation wavelengths of 229, 244 and 257 nm. In addition, visible Raman spectra of the fatty and resin acids were recorded. Resin compositions of heartwood and sapwood hexane extracts were determined using gas chromatography. Raman signals of both conjugated and isolated double bonds of all the model compounds were resonance enhanced by UV excitation. The oleophilic structures showed strong bands in the region of 1660-1630 cm -1. Distinct structures were enhanced depending on the excitation wavelength. The UVRR spectra of the hexane extracts showed characteristic bands for resin and fatty acids. It was possible to identify certain resin acids from the spectra. UV Raman spectra collected from the solid wood samples containing wood resin showed a band at Ë1650 cm -1 due to unsaturated resin components.

Raman spectra of ThO2-UO2 solid solutions exhibited two-mode behavior in the entire composition range. Variations in mode frequencies and relative intensities of Raman modes enabled estimation of composition, defects, and oxygen stoichiometry in these compounds that are essential for their application. The present study shows that Raman spectroscopy is a simple, promising analytical tool for nondestructive characterization of this important class of nuclear fuel materials.\n\nUV Resonance Raman Elucidation of the Terminal and Internal Peptide Bond Conformations of Crystalline and Solution Oligoglycines.\n\nPubMed\n\nBykov, Sergei V; Asher, Sanford A\n\n2010-11-30\n\nSpectroscopic investigations of macromolecules generally attempt to interpret the measured spectra in terms of the summed contributions of the different molecular fragments. This is the basis of the local mode approximation in vibrational spectroscopy. In the case of resonance Raman spectroscopy independent contributions of molecular fragments require both a local mode-like behavior and the uncoupled electronic transitions. Here we show that the deep UV resonance Raman spectra of aqueous solution phase oligoglycines show independent peptide bond molecular fragment contributions indicating that peptide bonds electronic transitions and vibrational modes are uncoupled. We utilize this result to separately determine the conformational distributions of the internal and penultimate peptide bonds of oligoglycines. Our data indicate that in aqueous solution the oligoglycine terminal residues populate conformations similar to those found in crystals (3(1)-helices and Î²-strands), but with a broader distribution, while the internal peptide bond conformations are centered around the 3(1)-helix Ramachandran angles.\n\nRaman spectroscopic analysis of a 'noli me tangere' painting.\n\nPubMed\n\nHibberts, Stephen; Edwards, Howell G M; Abdel-Ghani, Mona; Vandenabeele, Peter\n\n2016-12-13\n\nThe discovery of an oil painting in seriously damaged condition with an important historical and a heterodox detail with possible origins in the late fifteenth century has afforded the opportunity for Raman microscopic analysis prior to its restoration being undertaken. The painting depicts a risen Christ following His crucifixion in a 'noli me tangere' pose with three women in an Italian terrace garden with a stone balustrade overlooking a rural landscape and an undoubted view of late-medieval Florence. The picture has suffered much abuse and is in very poor condition, which is possibly attributable to its controversial portrayal of a polydactylic Christ with six toes on His right foot. By the late sixteenth century, after the Council of Trent, this portrayal would almost certainly have been frowned upon by the Church authorities or more controversially as a depiction of the holy. Raman spectroscopic analysis of the pigments places the painting as being consistent chronologically with the Renaissance period following the identification of cinnabar, haematite, red lead, lead white, goethite, verdigris, caput mortuum and azurite with no evidence of more modern synthetic pigments or of modern restoration having been carried out. An interesting pigment mixture found here is that of the organic dye carmine and cinnabar to produce a particular bright red pigment coloration. Stratigraphic examination of the paint fragments has demonstrated the presence of an orange resin layer immediately on top of the canvas substrate, effectively rendering the pigment as a sandwich between this substratal resin and the overlying varnish.

During their two week production period EVPOME may encounter thermal, chemical or biochemical stresses that could cause development to cease, rendering the affected constructs useless. We discuss the development of a Raman spectroscopic technique to study EVPOMEs noninvasively, with the ultimate goal of applying it in-vivo. We identify Raman spectroscopic failure indicators for EVPOMEs, which are stressed by temperature, and discuss the implications of varying calcium concentration and pre-treatment of the human keratinocytes with Rapamycin. In particular, Raman spectra show correlation of the peak height ratios of CH2 deformation to phenylalanine ring breathing, providing a Raman metric to distinguish between viable and nonviable constructs. We also show the results of singular value decomposition analysis, demonstrating the applicability of Raman spectroscopic technique to both distinguish between stressed and non-stressed EVPOME constructs, as well as between EVPOMEs and bare AlloDermÂ® substrates, on which the oral keratinocytes have been cultured. We also discuss complications arising from non-uniform thickness of the AlloDermÂ® substrate and the cultured constructs, as well as sampling protocols used to detect local stress and other problems that may be encountered in the constructs.\n\nRaman spectroscopic analysis of archaeological specimens from the wreck of HMS Swift, 1770\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEdwards, Howell G.

The DUV region offers two main advantages: strong explosive signatures due to resonant and Î»- 4 enhancement of Raman cross-section, and lack of fluorescence and solar background. For DUV Raman spectroscopy, continuous-wave (CW) or quasi-CW lasers are preferable to high peak powered pulsed lasers because Raman saturation phenomena and sample damage can be avoided. In this work we present a very compact DUV source that produces greater than 1 mw of CW optical power. The source has high optical-to-optical conversion efficiency, greater than 5 %, as it is based on second harmonic generation (SHG) of a blue/green laser source using a nonlinear crystal placed in an external resonant enhancement cavity. The laser system is extremely compact, lightweight, and can be battery powered. Using two such sources, one each at 236.5 nm and 257.5 nm, we are building a second generation explosive detection system called Dual-Excitation-Wavelength Resonance-Raman Detector (DEWRRED-II). The DEWRRED-II system also includes a compact dual-band high throughput DUV spectrometer, and a highly-sensitive detection algorithm. The DEWRRED technique exploits the DUV excitation wavelength dependence of Raman signal strength, arising from complex interplay of resonant enhancement, self-absorption and laser penetration depth. We show sensor measurements from explosives/precursor materials at different standoff distances.\n\nElectronic resonances in broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBatignani, G.; Pontecorvo, E.; Giovannetti, G.; Ferrante, C.; Fumero, G.; Scopigno, T.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSpontaneous Raman spectroscopy is a formidable tool to probe molecular vibrations. Under electronic resonance conditions, the cross section can be selectively enhanced enabling structural sensitivity to specific chromophores and reaction centers. The addition of an ultrashort, broadband femtosecond pulse to the excitation field allows for coherent stimulation of diverse molecular vibrations. Within such a scheme, vibrational spectra are engraved onto a highly directional field, and can be heterodyne detected overwhelming fluorescence and other incoherent signals. At variance with spontaneous resonance Raman, however, interpreting the spectral information is not straightforward, due to the manifold of field interactions concurring to the third order nonlinear response. Taking as an example vibrational spectra of heme proteins excited in the Soret band, we introduce a general approach to extract the stimulated Raman excitation profiles from complex spectral lineshapes. Specifically, by a quantum treatment of the matter through density matrix description of the third order nonlinear polarization, we identify the contributions which generate the Raman bands, by taking into account for the cross section of each process.\n\nRaman spectroscopic analysis identifies testicular microlithiasis as intratubular hydroxyapatite.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Jong, B W D; De Gouveia Brazao, C A; Stoop, H; Wolffenbuttel, K P; Oosterhuis, J W; Puppels, G J; Weber, R F A; Looijenga, L H J; Kok, D J\n\n2004-01-01\n\nAs diagnosed by ultrasonography, testicular microlithiasis is associated with various benign and malignant conditions.

We analyzed the molecular composition of gonadal microlithiasis and its surrounding region using Raman spectroscopy in malignant and benign conditions. Multiple microliths from 6 independent samples diagnosed with gonadal microlithiasis by ultrasound and histologically confirmed were investigated by Raman spectroscopy. The samples included 4 testicular parenchyma samples adjacent to a germ cell tumor (4 seminomas), a gonadoblastoma of a dysgenetic gonad and testicular biopsy of a subfertile male without malignancy. Raman spectroscopic mapping demonstrated that testicular microliths were located within the seminiferous tubule. Glycogen surrounded all microliths in the samples associated with germ cell neoplasm but not in the benign case. The molecular composition of the 26 microliths in all 6 conditions was pure hydroxyapatite. Microliths in the testis are located in the seminiferous tubules and composed of hydroxyapatite. In cases of germ cell neoplasm they co-localize with glycogen deposits.\n\nRaman spectroscopic signature of vaginal fluid and its potential application in forensic body fluid identification.\n\nPubMed\n\nSikirzhytskaya, Aliaksandra; Sikirzhytski, Vitali; Lednev, Igor K\n\n2012-03-10\n\nTraces of human body fluids, such as blood, saliva, sweat, semen and vaginal fluid, play an increasingly important role in forensic investigations. However, a nondestructive, easy and rapid identification of body fluid traces at the scene of a crime has not yet been developed. The obstacles have recently been addressed in our studies, which demonstrated the considerable potential of Raman spectroscopy. In this study, we continued to build a full library of body fluid spectroscopic signatures. The problems concerning vaginal fluid stain identification were addressed using Raman spectroscopy coupled with advanced statistical analysis. Calculated characteristic Raman and fluorescent spectral components were used to build a multidimensional spectroscopic signature of vaginal fluid, which demonstrated good specificity and was able to handle heterogeneous samples from different donors.

Nucleotide distributions in a HeLa cell were observed without any labeling at 257 nm excitation with resonant bands attributable to guanine and adenine. Obtained images represent DNA localization at nucleoli in the nucleus and RNA distribution in the cytoplasm. The presented technique extends the potential of Raman microscopy as a tool to selectively probe nucleic acids in a cell with high sensitivity due to resonance.\n\nRaman spectroscopic study of \"The Malatesta\": a Renaissance painting?\n\nPubMed\n\nEdwards, Howell G M; Vandenabeele, Peter; Benoy, Timothy J\n\n2015-02-25\n\nRaman spectroscopic analysis of the pigments on an Italian painting described as a \"Full Length Portrait of a Gentleman\", known also as the \"Malatesta\", and attributed to the Renaissance period has established that these are consistent with the historical research provenance undertaken earlier. Evidence is found for the early 19th Century addition of chrome yellow to highlighted yellow ochre areas in comparison with a similar painting executed in 1801 by Sir Thomas Lawrence of John Kemble in the role of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. The Raman data are novel in that no analytical studies have previously been made on this painting and reinforces the procedure whereby scientific analyses are accompanied by parallel historical research.

In this research many miscellaneous analytical methods, which complement one another, were used: infrared (FT-IR), Raman (FT-Raman), nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H, 13C NMR) and quantum mechanical calculations. The spectroscopic studies lead to conclusions concerning the distribution of the electronic charge in molecule, the delocalization energy of Ï-electrons and the reactivity of metal complexes. The change of metal along with the series: Li â Na â K â Rb â Cs caused: (1) the change of electronic charge distribution in cinnamate anion what is seen via the occurrence of the systematic shifts of several bands in the experimental and theoretical IR and Raman spectra of cinnamates, (2) systematic chemical shifts for protons 1H and 13C nuclei.\n\nOptical pathology of human brain metastasis of lung cancer using combined resonance Raman and spatial frequency spectroscopies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, Yan; Liu, Cheng-hui; Pu, Yang; Cheng, Gangge; Zhou, Lixin; Chen, Jun; Zhu, Ke; Alfano, Robert R.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nRaman spectroscopy has become widely used for diagnostic purpose of breast, lung and brain cancers. This report introduced a new approach based on spatial frequency spectra analysis of the underlying tissue structure at different stages of brain tumor. Combined spatial frequency spectroscopy (SFS), Resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopic method is used to discriminate human brain metastasis of lung cancer from normal tissues for the first time. A total number of thirty-one label-free micrographic images of normal and metastatic brain cancer tissues obtained from a confocal micro- Raman spectroscopic system synchronously with examined RR spectra of the corresponding samples were collected from the identical site of tissue. The difference of the randomness of tissue structures between the micrograph images of metastatic brain tumor tissues and normal tissues can be recognized by analyzing spatial frequency. By fitting the distribution of the spatial frequency spectra of human brain tissues as a Gaussian function, the standard deviation, Ï, can be obtained, which was used to generate a criterion to differentiate human brain cancerous tissues from the normal ones using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This SFS-SVM analysis on micrograph images presents good results with sensitivity (85%), specificity (75%) in comparison with gold standard reports of pathology and immunology. The dual-modal advantages of SFS combined with RR spectroscopy method may open a new way in the neuropathology applications.\n\nDual Raman-Brillouin spectroscopic investigation of plant stress response and development\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCoker, Zachary; Troyanova-Wood, Maria; Marble, Kassie; Yakovlev, Vladislav\n\n2018-03-01\n\nRaman and Brillouin spectroscopy are powerful tools for non-invasive and non-destructive investigations of material chemical and mechanical properties. In this study, we use a newly developed custom-built dual Raman-Brillouin microspectroscopy instrument to build on previous works studying in-vivo stress response of live plants using only a Raman spectroscopy system. This dual Raman-Brillouin spectroscopy system is capable of fast simultaneous spectra acquisition from single-point locations. Shifts and changes in a samples Brillouin spectrum indicate a change in the physical characteristics of the sample, namely mechano-elasticity; in measuring this change, we can establish a relationship between the mechanical properties of a sample and known stress response agents, such as reactive oxygen species and other chemical constituents as indicated by peaks in the Raman spectra of the same acquisition point. Simultaneous application of these spectroscopic techniques offers great promise for future development and applications in agricultural and biological studies and can help to improve our understanding of mechanochemical changes of plants and other biological samples in response to environmental and chemically induced stresses at microscopic or cellular level.\n\nOptical pathology study of human abdominal aorta tissues using confocal micro resonance Raman spectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Cheng-hui; Boydston-White, Susie; Wang, Wubao; Sordillo, Laura A.; Shi, Lingyan; Weisberg, Arel; Tomaselli, Vincent P.; Sordillo, Peter P.; Alfano, Robert R.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nResonance Raman (RR) spectroscopic technique has a high potential for label-free and in-situ detection of biomedical lesions in vivo. This study evaluates the ability of RR spectroscopy method as an optical histopathology tool to detect the atherosclerotic plaque states of abdominal aorta in vitro. This part demonstrates the RR spectral molecular fingerprint features from different sites of the atherosclerotic abdominal aortic wall tissues. Total 57 sites of five pieces aortic samples in intimal and adventitial wall from an autopsy specimen were examined using confocal micro Raman system of WITec 300R with excitation wavelength of 532nm. The preliminary RR spectral biomarkers of molecular fingerprints indicated that typical calcified atherosclerotic plaque (RR peak at 964cm-1) tissue; fibrolipid plaque (RR peaks at 1007, 1161, 1517 and 2888cm-1) tissue, lipid pool with the fatty precipitation cholesterol) with collagen type I (RR peaks at 864, 1452, 1658, 2888 and 2948cm-1) in the soft tissue were observed and investigated.\n\nNovel micro-Raman setup with tunable laser excitation for time-efficient resonance Raman microscopy and imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nStÃ¼rzl, Ninette; Lebedkin, Sergei; Klumpp, Stefanie; Hennrich, Frank; Kappes, Manfred M\n\n2013-05-07\n\nWe describe a micro-Raman setup allowing for efficient resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS), i.e., mapping of Raman spectra as a function of tunable laser excitation wavelength. The instrument employs angle-tunable bandpass optical filters which are integrated into software-controlled Raman and laser cleanup filter devices. These automatically follow the excitation laser wavelength and combine tunability with high bandpass transmission as well as high off-band blocking of light. Whereas the spectral intervals which can be simultaneously acquired are bandpass limited to ~350 cm(-1), they can be tuned across the spectrum of interest to access all characteristic Raman features. As an illustration of performance, we present Raman mapping of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs): (i) in a small volume of water-surfactant dispersion as well as (ii) after deposition onto a substrate. A significant improvement in the acquisition time (and efficiency) is demonstrated compared to previous RRS implementations. These results may help to establish (micro) Raman spectral mapping as a routine tool for characterization of SWNTs as well as other materials with a pronounced resonance Raman response in the visible-near-infrared spectral region.\n\nDestruction-free procedure for the isolation of bacteria from sputum samples for Raman spectroscopic analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKloÃ, Sandra; Lorenz, BjÃ¶rn; Dees, Stefan; Labugger, Ines; RÃ¶sch, Petra; Popp, JÃ¼rgen\n\n2015-11-01\n\nLower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Here, a timely identification of the causing pathogens is crucial to the success of the treatment. Raman spectroscopy allows for quick identification of bacterial cells without the need for time-consuming cultivation steps, which is the current gold standard to detect pathogens. However, before Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify pathogens, they have to be isolated from the sample matrix, i.e., sputum in case of lower respiratory tract infections. In this study, we report an isolation protocol for single bacterial cells from sputum samples for Raman spectroscopic identification. Prior to the isolation, a liquefaction step using the proteolytic enzyme mixture Pronase E is required in order to deal with the high viscosity of sputum. The extraction of the bacteria was subsequently performed via different filtration and centrifugation steps, whereby isolation ratios between 46 and 57Â % were achieved for sputa spiked with 6Â·10(7) to 6Â·10(4)Â CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus. The compatibility of such a liquefaction and isolation procedure towards a Raman spectroscopic classification was shown for five different model species, namely S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A classification of single-cell Raman spectra of these five species with an accuracy of 98.5Â % could be achieved on the basis of a principal component analysis (PCA) followed byÂ a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). These classification results could be validated with an independent test dataset, where 97.4Â % of all spectra were identified correctly. Graphical Abstract Development of an isolation protocol of bacterial cells out of sputum samples followed by Raman spectroscopic measurement and species identification using chemometrical models.\n\nRaman spectroscopic study of the Chromobacterium violaceum pigment violacein using multiwavelength excitation and DFT calculations.\n\nPubMed\n\nJehliÄka, Jan; Edwards, Howell G M; NÄmec, Ivan; Oren, Aharon\n\n2015-01-01\n\nViolacein is a bisindole pigment occurring as a biosynthetic product of Chromobacterium violaceum and Janthinobacterium lividum. It has some structural similarities to the cyanobacterial UV-protective pigment scytonemin, which has been the subject of comprehensive spectroscopic and structural studies. A detailed experimental Raman spectroscopic study with visible and near-infrared excitation of violacein produced by C. violaceum has been undertaken and supported using theoretical DFT calculations. Raman spectra with 514 and 785 nm excitation of cultivated cells as well as extracts and Gaussian (B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)) calculations with proposed molecular vibrational assignments are reported here.

Under ns-pulsed excitation, the TPCO crystals exhibited amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at resonant absorption wavelengths. With increasing excitation wavelength to the 0-0 absorption edge, the stimulated resonant Raman peaks appeared both in the 0-1 and 0-2 ASE band regions. When the excitation wavelength coincided with the 0-1 ASE band energy, the Raman peaks selectively appeared in the 0-2 ASE band. Such unusual enhancement of the 0-2 Raman scattering was ascribed to resonant stimulation via vibronic coupling with electronic transitions in the uniaxially oriented TPCO molecules.\n\nInfrared and Raman spectroscopic studies on alkali borate glasses: evidence of mixed alkali effect.\n\nPubMed\n\nPadmaja, G; Kistaiah, P\n\n2009-03-19\n\nA lithium-potassium-borate glass system containing manganese and iron cations has been thoroughly investigated in order to obtain information about the mixed alkali effect and the structural role of both the manganese and iron in such glass hosts. Mixed alkali borate glasses of the (30 - x)Li(2)O - xK(2)O - 10CdO/ZnO - 59B(2)O(3) (x = 0, 10, 15, 20, and 30) doped with 1MnO(2)/1Fe(2)O(3) system were prepared by a melt quench technique. The amorphous phase of the prepared glass samples was confirmed from their X-ray diffraction. The spectroscopic properties of glass samples were studied using infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopic techniques. The density of all the prepared glasses was measured using Archimedes principle. Molar volumes were estimated from the density data. IR spectra of these glasses revealed a dramatic variation of three- and four-coordinated boron structures as a function of mixed alkali concentration. The vibrations due to Li-O, K-O, and MnO(4)/FeO(4) arrangements are consistent in all the compositions and show a nonlinear variation in the intensity with alkali content. Raman spectra of different alkali combinations with CdO and ZnO present drastic changes in the intensity of various Raman bands. The observation of disappearance and reappearance of IR and Raman bands as a function of various alkali concentrations is an important result pertaining to the mixed alkali effect in borate glasses. Acting as complementary spectroscopic techniques, both types of measurements, IR and Raman, revealed that the network structure of the studied glasses is mainly based on BO(3) and BO(4) units placed in different structural groups, the BO(3) units being dominant. The measured IR and Raman spectra of different glasses are used to clarify the optical properties of the present glasses correlating them with their structure and composition.\n\nUV-resonance Raman spectroscopy of amino acids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHÃ¶hl, Martin; Meinhardt-Wollweber, Merve; Schmitt, Heike; Lenarz, Thomas; Morgner, Uwe\n\n2016-03-01\n\nResonant enhancement of Raman signals is a useful method to increase sensitivity in samples with low concentration such as biological tissue. The investigation of resonance profiles shows the optimal excitation wavelength and yields valuable information about the molecules themselves. However careful characterization and calibration of all experimental parameters affecting quantum yield is required in order to achieve comparability of the single spectra recorded. We present an experimental technique for measuring the resonance profiles of different amino acids. The absorption lines of these molecules are located in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range. One limitation for broadband measurement of resonance profiles is the limited availability of Raman filters in certain regions of the UV for blocking the Rayleigh scattered light. Here, a wavelength range from 244.8 nm to 266.0 nm was chosen. The profiles reveal the optimal wavelength for recording the Raman spectra of amino acids in aqueous solutions in this range. This study provides the basis for measurements on more complex molecules such as proteins in the human perilymph. The composition of this liquid in the inner ear is essential for hearing and cannot be analyzed non-invasively so far. The long term aim is to implement this technique as a fiber based endoscope for non-invasive measurements during surgeries (e. g. cochlear implants) making it available as a diagnostic tool for physicians. This project is embedded in the interdisciplinary cluster of excellence \"Hearing for all\" (H4A).\n\nSpectroscopic signatures of AA' and AB stacking of chemical vapor deposited bilayer MoS 2\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nXia, Ming; Li, Bo; Yin, Kuibo; ...\n\n2015-11-04\n\nWe discuss prominent resonance Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopic differences between AA'and AB stacked bilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) grown by chemical vapor deposition are reported. Bilayer MoS 2 islands consisting of the two stacking orders were obtained under identical growth conditions. Also, resonance Raman and photoluminescence spectra of AA' and AB stacked bilayer MoS 2 were obtained on Au nanopyramid surfaces under strong plasmon resonance. Both resonance Raman and photoluminescence spectra show distinct features indicating clear differences in interlayer interaction between these two phases. The implication of these findings on device applications based on spin and valley degrees of freedom.\n\nRaman spectroscopic monitoring of the bioeffects of nitroglycerin on Hb-O II in single red blood cell\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChiang, Huihua Kenny; Ruan, Hung-Shiang; Cheng, Hung-You; Fang, Tung-Ting\n\n2007-02-01\n\nRaman spectroscopy has been shown to have the potential for providing oxygenated ability of erythrocytes. Raman line at 1638 cm-1 has also been reported as one significant oxygenic indicator for erythrocytes. In this research, we develop the Raman spectroscopic monitoring of the bioeffects of Nitroglycerin on hemoglobin oxygen saturation in a single red blood cell (RBC). Nitroglycerin has been frequently used in the management of angina pectoris. Nitroglycerin liberates nitric oxide (NO) to blood vessels. NO is an oxidizer that easily converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin. The conversion may cause the decrease of oxygenated ability of erythrocytes. In this study, we observed the oxidize state of erythrocytes caused by the over dosage of Nitroglycerin. When the dose of Nitroglycerin exceeds 2x10 -4 M, the oxygenic state of erythrocytes decreases significantly. The Raman spectroscopic results demonstrate the observation of the bioeffects of Nitroglycerin on hemoglobin.\n\nA combined experimental and theoretical spectroscopic protocol for determination of the structure of heterogeneous catalysts: developing the information content of the resonance Raman spectra of M1 MoVO x .\n\nPubMed\n\nKubas, Adam; Noak, Johannes; Trunschke, Annette; SchlÃ¶gl, Robert; Neese, Frank; Maganas, Dimitrios\n\n2017-09-01\n\nAbsorption and multiwavelength resonance Raman spectroscopy are widely used to investigate the electronic structure of transition metal centers in coordination compounds and extended solid systems. In combination with computational methodologies that have predictive accuracy, they define powerful protocols to study the spectroscopic response of catalytic materials. In this work, we study the absorption and resonance Raman spectra of the M1 MoVO x catalyst. The spectra were calculated by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) in conjunction with the independent mode displaced harmonic oscillator model (IMDHO), which allows for detailed bandshape predictions. For this purpose cluster models with up to 9 Mo and V metallic centers are considered to represent the bulk structure of MoVO x . Capping hydrogens were used to achieve valence saturation at the edges of the cluster models. The construction of model structures was based on a thorough bonding analysis which involved conventional DFT and local coupled cluster (DLPNO-CCSD(T)) methods. Furthermore the relationship of cluster topology to the computed spectral features is discussed in detail. It is shown that due to the local nature of the involved electronic transitions, band assignment protocols developed for molecular systems can be applied to describe the calculated spectral features of the cluster models as well. The present study serves as a reference for future applications of combined experimental and computational protocols in the field of solid-state heterogeneous catalysis.\n\nPolarized Raman spectroscopic characterization of normal and oral cancer blood plasma\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPachaiappan, Rekha; Prakasarao, Aruna; Singaravelu, Ganesan\n\n2017-02-01\n\nIn India oral cancer ranks the top due to the habitual usage of tobacco in its various forms and remains the major burden. Hence priority is given for early diagnosis as it is the better solution for cure or to improve the survival rate. For the past three decades, optical spectroscopic techniques have shown its capacity in the discrimination of normal and malignant samples. Many research works have conventional Raman in the effective detection of cancer using the variations in bond vibrations of the molecules. However in addition polarized Raman provides the orientation and symmetry of biomolecules. If so can polarized Raman be the better choice than the conventional Raman in the detection of cancer? The present study aimed to found the answer for the above query. The conventional and polarized Raman spectra were acquired for the same set of blood plasma samples of normal subjects and oral malignant (OSCC) patients. Thus, obtained Raman spectral data were compared using linear discriminant analysis coupled with artificial neural network (LDA-ANN). The depolarization ratio of biomolecules such as antioxidant, amino acid, protein and nucleic acid bases present in blood plasma was proven to be the best attributes in the categorization of the groups. The polarized Raman results were promising in discriminating oral cancer blood plasma from that of normal blood plasma with improved efficiency. The results will be discussed in detail.\n\nRaman spectroscopic analysis of the Maya wall paintings in Ek'Balam, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVandenabeele, P.; BodÃ©, S.; Alonso, A.; Moens, L.\n\n2005-08-01\n\nRaman spectroscopy has been applied to the examination of wall painting fragments from the archaeological site of Ek'Balam (YucatÃ¡n, Mexico). Thirty-three samples have been studied, all originating from room 23 of the Acropolis, and being representative of the painting technique at Ek'Balam during the late Classic Maya period. Several pigments such as haematite, calcite, carbon, cinnabar and indigo were identified in these samples. The latter pigment was presumed to be present as 'Maya blue', which is an intercalation product of indigo and palygorskite clay. The observed Raman spectra are reported and some band assignments have been made. This survey is the first Raman spectroscopic examination of a whole set of pigments in archaeological Maya wall painting fragments.\n\nFeasibility study of a Raman spectroscopic route to drug detection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWrÃ³bel, Maciej S.; Siddhanta, Soumik; Jedrzejewska-Szczerska, MaÅgorzata; Smulko, Janusz; Barman, Ishan\n\n2017-02-01\n\nWe present an surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) approach for detection of drugs of abuse in whole human blood. We utilize a near infrared laser with 830 nm excitation wavelength in order to reduce the influence of fluorescence on the spectra of blood. However, regular plasmon resonance peak of plasmonic nanoparticles, such as silver or gold fall in a much lower wavelength regime about 400 nm. Therefore, we have shifted the plasmon resonance of nanoparticles to match that of an excitation laser wavelength, by fabrication of the silver-core gold-shell nanoparticles. By combining the laser and plasmon resonance shift towards longer wavelengths we have achieved a great reduction in background fluorescence of blood. Great enhancement of Raman signal coming solely from drugs was achieved without any prominent lines coming from the erythrocytes. We have applied chemometric processing methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to detect the elusive differences in the Raman bands which are specific for the investigated drugs. We have achieved good classification for the samples cont"
