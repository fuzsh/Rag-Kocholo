Carrying excess weight exacerbates the inherent health challenges associated with spina bifida, impedes the individual's ability to self-manage their condition, and creates further challenges for family members and caregivers. This manuscript provides a narrative review of key issues for understanding and prevention of obesity in persons with spina bifida within the context of the social ecological model. Specific variables related to obesity and spina bifida include individual factors (i.e., body composition and measurement issues, energy needs, eating patterns, physical activity, and sedentary activity) family factors (i.e., parenting/family, peers), community factors (i.e., culture, built environment, healthcare and healthcare providers, and school), and societal factors (i.e., policy issues). Due to the complex etiology of obesity and its increased prevalence in individuals with spina bifida, it is critical to initiate prevention efforts early with a multifactorial approach for this at-risk population.

It is the most common central nervous system malformation compatible with life and the second leading cause of birth defects after congenital heart defects. In this review paper, we define spina bifida and discuss the phenotypes seen in humans as described by both surgeons and embryologists in order to compare and ultimately contrast it to the leading animal model, the mouse. Our understanding of spina bifida is currently limited to the observations we make in mouse models, which reflect complete or targeted knockouts of genes, which perturb the whole gene(s) without taking into account the issue of haploinsufficiency, which is most prominent in the human spina bifida condition. We thus conclude that the need to study spina bifida in all its forms, both aperta and occulta, is more indicative of the spina bifida in surviving humans and that the measure of deterioration arising from caudal neural tube defects, more commonly known as spina bifida, must be determined by the level of the lesion both in mouse and in man.

The etiology of spina bifida is thought to be multi-factorial and involve multiple interacting genes and environmental factors. The causes of this congenital malformation remain largely unknown. However, several candidate genes for spina bifida have been identified in lower vertebrates, including the planar cell polarity (PCP) genes. We used data from a case-control study conducted in California to evaluate the association between variation within several key PCP genes and the risk of spina bifida. The PCP genes included in this study were the human homologues of the Xenopus genes Flamingo, Strabismus, Prickle, Dishevelled and Scrib, two of the homologues of Xenopus Wnt genes, WNT5A and WNT11, and two of the homologues of Xenopus Frizzled, FZD3 and FZD6. None of the 172 SNPs that were evaluated were significantly associated with spina bifida in any racial/ethnic group after correction for multiple testing. However, several SNPs in the PRICKLE2 gene had unadjusted p value<0.01. In conclusion our results, though largely negative, suggest that the PRICKLE2 gene may potentially modify the risk of spina bifida and deserves further investigation.

Method Sixty-eight families of children with spina bifida (mean=8.34y, 37 male, 31 female) and 68 families of children with typical development (mean=8.49y, 37 male, 31 female) participated at Time 1. At all subsequent timepoints, parents of young people with spina bifida were asked to rate their expectations of emerging adulthood milestone achievement. At Time 7, when participants were 22 to 23 years old, milestone achievement was assessed. Results Parents of young people with spina bifida lowered their expectations over time for most milestones; parents of children with higher cognitive ability reported decreases of lower magnitude. Parent expectancies were optimistic and unrelated to actual milestone achievement. Emerging adults with spina bifida were less likely than individuals with typical development to achieve all milestones. Interpretation Optimistic parental expectations may be adaptive for children with spina bifida and their families, although it is important for families to set realistic goals.

Scott; Chitty, Lyn S.; Fletcher, Jack M.; Holmbeck, Grayson N.; Shaw, Gary M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSpina bifida is a birth defect in which the vertebral column is open (bifid), often with spinal cord involvement. Clinically most significant is myelomeningocele (MMC; open spina bifida) in which the spinal neural tube fails to close during embryonic development. The exposed neural tissue degenerates in utero, resulting in neurological deficit that varies with level of the lesion. Occurring in around 1 per 1000 births worldwide, MMC is one of the commonest congenital malformations, yet its causation is largely unknown. The genetic component of MMC is estimated at 60-70% but few genes have yet been identified, despite much information from mouse models. Non-genetic risk factors include reduced folate intake, maternal anticonvulsant therapy, diabetes mellitus and obesity. Primary prevention by peri-conceptional folic acid has been demonstrated in clinical trials, leading to food fortification programmes in many countries. Prenatal diagnosis is by ultrasound enabling termination of pregnancy. Individuals who survive to birth have their lesions closed surgically, with subsequent management of associated defects, including the Chiari II malformation, hydrocephalus, and urological and orthopaedic sequelae. Fetal surgical repair of MMC has been associated with improved early neurological outcome compared with postnatal operation. MMC affects quality of life during childhood, adolescence, and into adulthood, posing a challenge for individuals, families and society as a whole.

Individual growth curve modeling procedures were utilized to describe the developmental course of autonomy across four waves of data collection, from ages 9 to 15, and to test whether illness status [spina bifida vs. matched comparison group (N = 68 for both groups at Time 1)] would significantly predict individual variability in autonomy development. Potential moderators [child gender, SES, and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) score] of the association between illness status and autonomy development were also examined. Children with spina bifida demonstrated distinct developmental trajectories, though the nature of the group differences varied by type of autonomy development (emotional vs. behavioral), context (i.e. school vs. family), and reporter. Significant interactions with PPVT score and child gender were found. Overall, children with spina bifida show considerable developmental resiliency, but may lag behind their peers in specific areas of autonomy. Boys with spina bifida, and children with spina bifida who have lower than average levels of verbal intelligence, appear to be at greater risk for exhibiting delays in autonomy development.\n\nSpina Bifida Data and Statistics\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... who had public insurance only.

In this article, we explore the nature of school-work transitions for youth with spina bifida, which few studies have previously addressed. Method We conducted in-depth interviews with 44 participants (nine youth and 12 young adults with spina bifida, 11 parents and 12 clinicians). We analyzed our data using a qualitative content analysis approach. Results We identified several enablers to school-work transitions, including professional support, social support and school accommodations. Lacking such support created several challenges for youth with spina bifida. We also identified several barriers to school-work transitions, including lack of education and information on finances, housing and transportation; discrimination and stigma; and challenges coping with spina bifida at school and work. Conclusions Although some supports are available, youth with spina bifida encounter many challenges in transitioning to post-secondary education and employment. With clinicians at the helm, efforts should be put in place within the health and social services system to better prepare youth, as they transition to adulthood, to become connected to appropriate information and resources to help them to succeed in their school and employment goals. Implications for Rehabilitation Youth with spina bifida encounter many challenges in transitioning to post-secondary education or work. Clinicians, educators and parents should continue to support youth with spina bifida in choosing their vocations, setting career goals and developing career plans. Starting from a young age, parents, clinicians and educators should help youth with spina bifida prepare for school work transitions by fostering their independence, life skills and self-management of spina bifida-related symptoms.

Updated estimates are essential for calculations of lifetime costs and for economic evaluations of prevention and management strategies for spina bifida. We analyzed data from the 2001-2003 MarketScan database on paid medical and prescription drug claims of persons covered by employer-sponsored health insurance in the United States. Medical care utilization and expenditures during 2003 were analyzed for persons with a diagnosis of spina bifida recorded during 2001-2003 who had 12 months of coverage in a fee-for-service health plan. To calculate expenditures during infancy, a separate analysis was performed for those born during 2002 with claims and expenditures data during the first 12 months of life. We compared medical expenditures for persons with and without spina bifida by age groups. Average incremental medical expenditures comparing patients with spina bifida and those without were $41,460 per year at age 0, $14,070 at ages 1-17, $13,339 at ages 18-44, and $10,134 at ages 45-64. Children ages 1-17 years with spina bifida had average medical expenditures 13 times greater than children without spina bifida. Adults with spina bifida had average medical expenditures three to six times greater than adults without spina bifida in this privately insured population. Although per capita medical care utilization and expenditures are highest among children, adults constitute an important and growing share of the population living with spina bifida.

Case series of women known to have attended the spina bifida clinic at the Royal Children's Hospital. Medical records, postal questionnaire and telephone interview were utilized to collect data on the effect of pregnancy on the health of women and the effect of spina bifida on pregnancy outcome. Of 207 women born between 1945 and 1975, 23 reported having a pregnancy, and 17 who had completed pregnancies agreed to participate. The 17 women had a total of 29 pregnancies, with 23 pregnancies progressing to births. Fourteen of 17 women had antenatal admissions, with wheelchair-dependent women requiring more-frequent and longer admissions. Recurrent urinary infections in pregnancy occurred in women with a prior history of urinary infections; stomal problems occurred but were not serious; mobility was reduced for two women during pregnancy, with full recovery afterwards; and preexisting pressure sores worsened during pregnancy. Vaginal deliveries occurred in one in five pregnancies of women who were wheelchair dependent and in ten of eighteen pregnancies in independently mobile women, including seven of eight pregnancies of independently mobile women without ileal conduits. Cesarean sections were accompanied by postoperative complications in 10 women. Women with spina bifida who become pregnant generally have a positive outcome, with relatively low complication rates.\n\nWork Participation among Young Adults with Spina Bifida in the Netherlands\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nVan Mechelen, M.

There is good evidence that this continuum is characterised by a continuum of predisposition to anencephaly, slightly raised in dichorionic pairs but very high in some sorts of conjoined pairs. Although MZ twins, especially monoamniotic and conjoined pairs, are peculiarly liable to anencephaly, they are not particularly susceptible to spina bifida. Among twin pairs concordant for anencephaly or spina bifida, there are strikingly few concordant in the sense of one twin having anencephaly and the other spina bifida, in contrast with the numbers of pairs concordant for the same malformation. The prevalence of anencephaly in double monsters varies with the type of monster, being high in diprosopus. These findings may be explained by the timing of embryonic events.\n\nDifferences between the events preceding spina bifida and anencephaly.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJames, W H\n\n1981-01-01\n\nIt is usually held that there is a time continuum in the formation of monoxygotic (MZ) twins which is indexed by their placentation, running from dichorionic to monochorionic diamniotic to monochorionic monoamniotic and conjoined pairs.

Such complications could be due, in part, to difficulty accessing care or the quality of ambulatory care services received. To use hospitalizations for urinary tract infections (UTIs) as a marker of the potential quality of ambulatory care services received by people affected by spina bifida. MarketScan inpatient and outpatient medical claims data for 2000 through 2003 were used to identify hospitalizations for UTI, which is an ambulatory care sensitive condition, for people affected by spina bifida and to calculate inpatient discharge rates, average lengths of stay, and average medical care expenditures for such hospitalizations. People affected by spina bifida averaged 0.5 hospitalizations per year, and there were 22.8 inpatient admissions with UTI per 1000 persons with spina bifida during the period 2000-2003, in comparison to an average of 0.44 admission with UTI per 1000 persons for those without spina bifida. If the number of UTI hospitalizations among people affected by spina bifida were reduced by 50%, expenditures could be reduced by $4.4 million per 1000 patients. Consensus on the evaluation and management of bacteriuria could enhance clinical care and reduce the disparity in UTI discharge rates among people affected by spina bifida compared to those without spina bifida. National evidence-based guidelines are needed.\n\nOptimizing health care for adults with spina bifida.\n\nPubMed\n\nWebb, Thomas S\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSurvival into adulthood for individuals with spina bifida has significantly improved over the last 40 years with the majority of patients now living as adults. Despite this growing population of adult patients who have increased medical needs compared to the general population, including spina bifida (SB)-specific care, age-related secondary disabilities, and general adult medical needs, there is little published information about the natural history of SB in adulthood. There are few published studies of medical conditions, interventions, or long-term complications in this population. This article will provide a review of the medical issues of adults with SB, highlighting areas that are different than pediatric care, and areas of needed research.\n\nInterhemispheric Effective and Functional Cortical Connectivity Signatures of Spina Bifida Are Consistent with Callosal Anomaly\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMalekpour, Sheida; Li, Zhimin; Cheung, Bing Leung Patrick; Castillo, Eduardo M.; Papanicolaou, Andrew C.; Kramer, Larry A.; Fletcher, Jack M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbstract The impact of the posterior callosal anomalies associated with spina bifida on interhemispheric cortical connectivity is studied using a method for estimating cortical multivariable autoregressive models from scalp magnetoencephalography data. Interhemispheric effective and functional connectivity, measured using conditional Granger causality and coherence, respectively, is determined for the anterior and posterior cortical regions in a population of five spina bifida and five control subjects during a resting eyes-closed state. The estimated connectivity is shown to be consistent over the randomly selected subsets of the data for each subject. The posterior interhemispheric effective and functional connectivity and cortical power are significantly lower in the spina bifida group, a result that is consistent with posterior callosal anomalies. The anterior interhemispheric effective and functional connectivity are elevated in the spina bifida group, a result that may reflect compensatory mechanisms. In contrast, the intrahemispheric effective connectivity is comparable in the two groups. The differences between the spina bifida and control groups are most significant in the Î¸ and Î± bands.

Our objective was to understand the enablers and challenges experienced in the implementation of the model. Using a descriptive, qualitative design, we conducted semi-structured interviews, in-person or over the phone, with 12 clinicians and nine key informants involved in implementing the spina bifida transition model. We recruited all 21 participants from an urban area of Ontario, Canada. Clinicians and key informants experienced several enablers and challenges in implementing the spina bifida transition model. Enablers included dedicated leadership, advocacy, funding, inter-agency partnerships, cross-appointed staff and gaps in co-ordinated care to connect youth to adult services. Challenges included gaps in the availability of adult specialty services, limited geographical catchment of adult services, limited engagement of front-line staff, gaps in communication and role clarity. Although the transition model has realized some initial successes, there are still many challenges to overcome in transferring youth with spina bifida to adult health care and transitioning to adulthood.

Persons with spina bifida can also experience executive function impairments. Secondary conditions are physical, medical, cognitive, emotional, or psychosocial consequences to which persons with disabilities are more susceptible. Our experience suggested clinicians underappreciate the presence and impact of secondary conditions in adults with spina bifida because they do not specifically ask for this information. Describe the presence and impact of secondary conditions on daily life, as perceived by adults with spina bifida. A clinic-based sample was recruited from the active patient population of an adult specialty center for spina bifida-related care. All subjects were verbally administered a survey developed through literature review and clinical experience of the researchers. The survey measured the presence and perceived impact of secondary conditions. Recruitment and survey data collection occurred over a 6-month period to maximize age representation. Survey data were stratified by age, gender and lesion level for analysis. Seventy-two respondents completed the survey. Pain was commonly reported, along with pressure ulcers, bowel & bladder concerns, depression, sleep disturbance, and limited social and community participation. No significant relationships were found between the presence or perceived impact of secondary conditions and age, gender or level of lesion. Secondary conditions in spina bifida are present by early adulthood. Identifying these conditions during clinical encounters requires specific rather than general questions. Future study should evaluate earlier initiation of preventative measures by pediatric providers. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We used ICD-9-CM code 741.* to identify individuals with spina bifida using hospital inpatient data from 1977 to 2010, and physician and facility claims from 2004 to 2008. We constructed a 5:1 comparison group of patients with end stage renal disease without spina bifida matched by age at first end stage renal disease service, gender and race/ethnicity. We assessed the risk of mortality and of renal transplantation while on dialysis using multivariate cause specific proportional hazards survival analysis. We also compared survival after the first renal transplant from the first end stage renal disease service to August 2011. We identified 439 patients with end stage renal disease and spina bifida in whom end stage renal disease developed at an average younger age than in patients without spina bifida (41 vs 62 years, p <0.001) and in whom urological issues were the most common primary cause of end stage renal disease. Compared to patients with end stage renal disease without spina bifida those who had spina bifida showed a similar mortality hazard on dialysis and after transplantation. However, patients with end stage renal disease without spina bifida were more likely to undergo renal transplantation than patients with spina bifida (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.13-2.03). Hospitalizations related to urinary tract infections were positively associated with the risk of death on dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and spina bifida (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.33-1.53). Spina bifida was not associated with increased mortality in patients with end stage renal disease on dialysis or after renal transplantation. Proper urological and bladder management is imperative in patients with spina bifida, particularly in adults.

Genetic factors as well as environmental factors have been observed to influence risks for spina bifida. Few studies have investigated possible gene-environment interactions that could contribute to spina bifida risk. The aim of this study is to examine the interaction between gene variants in biotransformation enzyme pathways and ambient air pollution exposures and risk of spina bifida. We evaluated the role of air pollution exposure during pregnancy and gene variants of biotransformation enzymes from bloodspots and buccal cells in a California population-based case-control (86 cases of spina bifida and 208 non-malformed controls) study. We considered race/ethnicity and folic acid vitamin use as potential effect modifiers and adjusted for those factors and smoking. We observed gene-environment interactions between each of the five pollutants and several gene variants: NO (ABCC2), NO 2 (ABCC2, SLC01B1), PM 10 (ABCC2, CYP1A1, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, NAT2, SLC01B1, SLC01B3), PM 2.5 (CYP1A1 and CYP1A2). These analyses show positive interactions between air pollution exposure during early pregnancy and gene variants associated with metabolizing enzymes. These exploratory results suggest that some individuals based on their genetic background may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of pollution.

Design Cross-sectional analysis of data from a multi-site patient registry Results Descriptive analysis of mobility variables for 2604 individuals with spina bifida age 5 and above are presented from 19 sites in the United States. Analysis of a subset of NSBPR data from 380 individuals from three sites accompanied by data from a specialized spina bifida electronic medical record revealed that those with no history of a shunt, lower motor level, and no history of hip or knee contracture release surgery were more likely to be ambulatory at the community level than at the household or wheelchair level. Conclusion This study is the first to examine factors associated with ambulatory status in a large sample of individuals with myelomeningocele and non-myelomeningocele subtypes of SB. Results of this study delineate the breadth of strength and functional abilities within the different age groups and subtypes of SB. The results may inform clinicians of the characteristics of those with varying ambulatory abilities.

This study estimates labor market productivity costs for caregivers of children and adolescents with spina bifida. Case families were recruited from a state birth defects registry in Arkansas. Primary caregivers of children with spina bifida (N = 98) reported their employment status in the past year and demographic characteristics. Controls were abstracted from the Current Population Survey covering the state of Arkansas for the same time period (N = 416). Estimates from regression analyses of labor market outcomes were used to calculate differences in hours worked per week and lifetime costs. Caregivers of children with spina bifida worked an annual average of 7.5 to 11.3 hours less per week depending on the disability severity. Differences in work hours by caregivers of children with spina bifida translated into lifetime costs of $133,755 in 2002 dollars using a 3% discount rate and an age- and sex-adjusted earnings profile. Including caregivers' labor market productivity costs in prevention effectiveness estimates raises the net cost savings per averted case of spina bifida by 48% over the medical care costs alone. Information on labor market productivity costs for caregivers can be used to better inform economic evaluations of prevention and treatment strategies for spina bifida. Cost-effectiveness calculations that omit caregiver productivity costs substantially overstate the net costs of the intervention and underestimate societal value.\n\nThe Spina Bifida Child in the Classroom.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMattson, Beverly; And Others\n\nLearning characteristics of children with spina bifida (lesions on the spinal cord) are reviewed in the text of a presentation with slides, and the effects of such factors as hospitalization experiences and the presence of hydrocephalus are considered.

Estimating future numbers of affected individuals can aid health and social care planning. This study aimed to estimate the number of children aged 0-15 years living with spina bifida or Down syndrome in England and Wales by 2020. Cases of spina bifida and Down syndrome born during 1998-2013 were identified from the Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey and the National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register, respectively. The number of infants born with spina bifida during 1998-2019 were estimated by applying the average prevalence rate in the North of England to actual and projected births in England and Wales. Poisson regression was performed to estimate the number of infants born with Down syndrome in England and Wales during 1998-2013 and 2004-2019. The numbers of children aged 0-15 living with spina bifida or Down syndrome in 2014 and in 2020 were then estimated by multiplying year- and age-specific survival estimates by the number of affected births. An estimated 956 children with isolated spina bifida, 623 children with spina bifida and hydrocephalus and 11,592 children with Down syndrome aged 0-15 years will be living in England and Wales by 2020, increases of 7.2%, 12.0% and 12.7% since 2014, respectively. Due to improvements in survival, an increase in population size and changes in maternal age distribution at delivery, we anticipate further increases in the number of children living with spina bifida or Down syndrome by 2020.

We searched MEDLINE(Â®), EMBASE(Â®) and PubMed(Â®) for English articles published through December 2014 using search terms \"spina bifida,\" \"spinal dysraphism\" and \"bladder.\" Based on review of titles and abstracts, 437 of 1,869 articles were identified as addressing topics related to open spina bifida in pediatric patients, or long-term or quality of life outcomes in adults with spina bifida. We summarize this literature to inform clinical guidelines and create a framework for disease management. The birth prevalence of spina bifida in the United States has recently plateaued at approximately 30 per 100,000. With improved management more individuals are surviving to adulthood, with an economic impact of $319,000 during the lifetime of an individual with spina bifida. Recent advances in prenatal surgery have demonstrated that prenatal closure of spina bifida is possible. To assess safety and efficacy, the National Institutes of Health sponsored Management of Myelomeningocele Study was undertaken, in which subjects were randomized to prenatal or postnatal closure. Until the urological results of this trial are published, the impact of prenatal intervention on future bladder function remains unclear. Controversy continues regarding the optimal use and timing of urodynamic studies, and the indications for initiation of clean intermittent catheterization and anticholinergics in infants and children. Many favor expectant management, while others argue for a more proactive approach. Based on the current literature, both approaches appear to protect the child from renal injury, although delayed intervention may increase rates of bladder augmentation. The current literature regarding this topic is difficult to interpret and compare due to heterogeneity of patient populations, variable outcome measures and lack of reporting of quality of life outcomes\n\nTreatment of pressure sores in spina bifida patients with calcium alginate and foam dressings.\n\nPubMed\n\nAusili, E; Paolucci, V; Triarico, S; Maestrini, C; Murolo, D; Focarelli, B; Rendeli, C\n\n2013-06-01\n\nProspective study on local treatment of pressure sores using calcium alginate and foam dressings in spina bifida patients.

Using European Pressure Ulcer Grading System, after clinical evaluation of local sore, selected patients of Spina Bifida Center of Rome were treated with sequential calcium alginate and foam dressings for 12 weeks. Pressure ulcere surfaces were measured monthly by ulcer tracing. The endpoints were the mean absolute areas surface reduction during every month and number of patients achieving a 50% or more during study. 14 patients (7 males aged 12-24 years) with spina bifida and pressure sores were treated. Mean and standard deviation of mean surface area reduction were 12.5 Â± 7.5 cm 2 at start of the study versus 3.7 Â± 5.2 cm 2 after 12 weeks, p < 0.001. 75% of the patients reached mean surface area reduction of 50% during trial. Dressing tolerance was good in every patient. Calcium alginate and foam dressings are valid and safe approach in the treatment of pressure sores in selected patients with spina bifida. In fact, they protect the wound and create an environment favorable to healing.\n\nAn Approach for Determining Quantitative Measures for Bone Volume and Bone Mass in the Pediatric Spina Bifida Population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHorenstein, Rachel E.; Shefelbine, Sandra J.; Mueske, Nicole M.; Fisher, Carissa L.; Wren, Tishya A.L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground The pediatric spina bifida population suffers from decreased mobility and recurrent fractures. This study aimed to develop a method for quantifying bone mass along the entire tibia in youth with spina bifida. This will provide information about all potential sites of bone deficiencies. Methods Computed tomography images of the tibia for 257 children (n=80 ambulatory spina bifida, n=10 non-ambulatory spina bifida, n=167 typically developing) were analyzed. Bone area was calculated at regular intervals along the entire tibia length and then weighted by calibrated pixel intensity for density weighted bone area. Integrals of density weighted bone area were used to quantify bone mass in the proximal and distal epiphyses and diaphysis. Group differences were evaluated using analysis of variance. Findings Non-ambulatory children suffer from decreased bone mass in the diaphysis and proximal and distal epiphyses compared to ambulatory and control children (Pâ¤0.001). Ambulatory children with spina bifida showed statistically insignificant differences in bone mass in comparison to typically developing children at these sites (P>0.5). Interpretation This method provides insight into tibial bone mass distribution in the pediatric spina bifida population by incorporating information along the whole length of the bone, thereby providing more information than dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and peripheral quantitative computed tomography. This method can be applied to any population to assess bone mass distribution across the length of any long bone.

Little progress has been made in the postnatal surgical management of the child with spina bifida. Postnatal surgery is aimed at covering the exposed spinal cord, preventing infection, and treating hydrocephalus with a ventricular shunt. Experimental and clinical evidence suggest that the primary cause of the neurologic defects associated with MMC is not simply incomplete neurulation, but rather chronic, mechanical and amniotic-fluid induced chemical trauma that progressively damages the exposed neural tissue during gestation. The cerebrospinal fluid leak through the MMC leads to hindbrain herniation and hydrocephalus. In utero repair of open spina bifida is now performed in selected patients and presents an additional therapeutic alternative for expectant mothers carrying a fetus with MMC. In the past, studies in animal models and clinical case series laid the groundwork for a clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of fetal MMC repair. In the present, a prospective, randomized study (the MOMS trial) has shown that fetal surgery for MMC before 26 weeks' gestation may preserve neurologic function, reverse the hindbrain herniation of the Chiari II malformation, and obviate the need for postnatal placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. However, this study also demonstrates that fetal surgery is associated with significant risks related to the uterine scar and premature birth. In the future, research will expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of MMC, evaluate the long-term impact of in-utero intervention, and to refine timing and technique of fetal MMC surgery using tissue engineering technology.

It has been inhabited by humans for the past 7,000 years. Evidence exists for chronic arsenic poisoning in both prehispanic and present populations residing in the area. Chronic arsenic exposure causes multi-systemic problems and can induce congenital malformations, in particular neural tube development defects such as spina bifida. To study the prevalence of spina bifida among prehispanic mummies of the area. One hundred and twenty prehistoric adult individuals were analyzed for evidence of spina bifda occulta of the sacrum in skeletal samples from the sites of Camarones 8, Camarones 9, Azapa 140 and Lluta 54, held in repository at the Museo Universidad de TarapacÃ¡ de Arica- San Miguel de Azapa. A diagnosis was considered positive when at least S1, S2 or S3 were affected. As controls, mummies of individuals that resided in Lluta and Azapa valley, with a low arsenic exposure, were analyzed. The frequency of spina bifida occulta among samples from the Camarones coast and Lluta and Azapa Valley were 13.5 and 2.4% respectively. Considering these were contemporaneous samples, and are believed to have had no other differences in diet or other factors, the differential exposures to arsenic could have produced the observed differences in spina bifida frequencies.\n\nExploring psychosocial correlates of physical activity among children and adolescents with spina bifida.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarques, Adilson; Maldonado, InÃªs; Peralta, Miguel; Santos, Sofia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo enhance physical activity of children with spina bifida, it is important to investigate the correlates of physical activity to support the development of interventions to promote active lifestyles. This study aimed to identify psychosocial correlates of physical activity among children and adolescents with spina bifida. A survey was conducted with 31 students (15 boys), aged 10-17 years with spina bifida. A questionnaire was used to collect data of physical activity, demographic and psychosocial variables (attitudes, sports goal orientation and perceptions). Unadjusted and adjusted binary logistic regressions were performed to examine the relationship of psychosocial factors and physical activity participation. Data were collected in 2013. Only 38.7% reported to participate in both organized and non-organized physical activity. Results showed no relationship between participation in organized and non-organized physical activity and psychosocial correlates. The result of the adjusted regression analysis show that perception of competence (OR = 9.55, 1.06-85.99, p < 0.05) was the only variable positively associated with participation in non-organized physical activity. Most of the participants reported that they did not participate in physical activity regularly. Psychosocial variables were not related with physical activity, except perception of competence. Studies with bigger samples are needed, focused on the same and in others factors to identify the predictors of physical activity of young people with spina bifida. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

As part of a larger longitudinal study, 103 infants (n = 49 with spina bifida; n = 54 typically developing) received measures of EF/SL at 3 years of age and mother-infant play interactions at 12 and 18 months of age were coded for a range of responsive parenting behaviors. Social problem-solving skills were measured with a game-like observational task at 7 years of age. Group had a direct relation with later social problem-solving as well as an indirect relation through early EF/SL skills that, in turn, had a direct relation with later social problem solving. An indirect effect of responsive parenting on later social skills also was found through a direct effect on EF/SL skills. Early precursors of school age difficulties with social problem solving observed for children with spina bifida can be explained, in part, by difficulties in the first 3 years of life with EF/SL. Early responsive parenting appears to positively affect the development of these EF/SL skills. Implications for early intervention are an outcome of this study.\n\nAdult consequences of spina bifida: a cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoach, James W; Short, Barbara F; Saltzman, Hanna M\n\n2011-05-01\n\nPatients with spina bifida potentially experience social isolation with limited employment opportunities and restriction of independent living, neurologic and intellectual impairment, and orthopaedic and urologic consequences of their condition. However, the degree of disability as these individuals age into adulthood has not been completely delineated. In adults with spina bifida we determined the cause of death for those who had died, IQ, level of education, work history, independent living status, physical disabilities, and urologic status; we then identified surgical procedures that led to better adult function. We retrospectively reviewed 84 individuals with myelomeningocele, examining social, cognitive, and physical disabilities. The minimum age at followup was 20 years (mean, 31 years; range, 20-64 years). Forty-two percent had normal IQs. Seventy percent never needed a neurosurgical shunt and those without shunts had higher IQs. Forty-four percent had regular education and 8% achieved college degrees. Fifty-six percent were unemployed. Thirty percent lived independently. Twenty-three percent were either married or divorced with nine normal offspring. Eighty-five percent dressed themselves, 65% shopped independently, 54% drove. Thirty-one percent were at the thoracic neurologic level (all used wheelchairs), 12% were at L1-L3 (all used a wheelchair except one), 33% were at L4-L5 (78% used a wheelchair at least part-time), and 24% were at S1 and below (all walked). Fifty-four percent experienced decubiti and as a consequence, four required major extremity amputations. Spinal fusions protected sitting balance, but hip surgery did not produce congruent hips and occasionally resulted in debilitating stiffness. Pressure sores resulted in partial foot amputations despite plantigrade feet. Our observations confirm the consequences associated with the physical and cognitive disabilities of patients with spina bifida. Many of these consequences can likely be mitigated\n\nAn environmental scan of weight assessment and management practices in paediatric spina bifida clinics across Canada.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcPherson, Amy C; Leo, Jennifer; Church, Paige; Lyons, Julia; Chen, Lorry; Swift, Judy\n\n2014-01-01\n\nChildhood obesity is a global health concern, but children with spina bifida in particular have unique interacting risk factors for increased weight. To identify and explore current clinical practices around weight assessment and management in pediatric spina bifida clinics. An online, self-report survey of healthcare professionals (HCPs) was conducted in all pediatric spina bifida clinics across Canada (15 clinics). Summary and descriptive statistics were calculated and descriptive thematic analysis was performed on free text responses. 52 responses across all 15 clinics indicated that weight and height were assessed and recorded most of the time using a wide variety of methods, although some HCPs questioned their suitability for children with spina bifida. Weight and height information was not routinely communicated to patients and their families and HCPS identified considerable barriers to discussing weight-related information in consultations. Despite weight and height reportedly being measured regularly, HCPs expressed concern over the lack of appropriate assessment and classification tools. Communication across multi-disciplinary team members is required to ensure that children with weight-related issues do not inadvertently get overlooked. Specific skill training around weight-related issues and optimizing consultation time should be explored further for HCPs working with this population.\n\nThe Infant and Young Child with Spina Bifida: Major Medical Concerns.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nShaer, Catherine M.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThis review of medical concerns in dealing with spina bifida examines neurologic and neurosurgical issues, learning issues, urological dysfunction, orthopedic issues, bowel control, latex allergy, and prenatal diagnosis and prevention.

A total of 250 digitally stored sonographic examinations at gestational ages of 11 weeks to 13 weeks 6 days (245 normal and 5 randomly interspersed spina bifida cases) were retrospectively analyzed by 4 blinded reviewers for the presence or absence of the fourth ventricle followed by an anteroposterior ventricular dimension measurement. The ventricle size was related to the crown-rump length and gestational age by linear regression analysis and Pearson correlation. The fourth ventricle was identified in 971 of 1000 image readings (97.1%). False-negative and false-positive readings occurred in 11 of 20 (55.0%) and 20 of 980 (2.0%) cases, respectively (sensitivity, 0.45; specificity, 0.98.). False-negative and false-positive readings were evenly distributed throughout the gestational age range. When the ventricular size was measurable, its mean dimensions increased linearly with gestational age and were below the fifth percentile in 10 of 245 (4.0%) normal and 0 of 4 spina bifida cases, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficient estimates were calculated based on the 2-way analysis of variance model and found to be 0.30 for a single rater and 0.64 for the mean of 4 raters. Nonvisualization of the first-trimester fourth ventricle is a less robust screening parameter for spina bifida than previously published.\n\nPaternal and joint parental occupational pesticide exposure and spina bifida in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, 1997 to 2002.\n\nPubMed\n\nPettigrew, Stacy M; Bell, Erin M; Van Zutphen, Alissa R; Rocheleau, Carissa M; Shaw, Gary M; Romitti, Paul A; Olshan, Andrew; Lupo, Philip J; Soim, Aida; Makelarski, Jennifer A; Michalski, Adrian M; Sanderson, Wayne\n\n2016-11-01\n\nBecause of persistent concerns over the association between pesticides and spina bifida, we examined the role of paternal and combined parental occupational pesticide exposures in spina bifida in offspring using data from a large population-based study of birth defects. Occupational information from fathers of 291 spina bifida cases and 2745 unaffected live born control infants with estimated dates of delivery from 1997 to 2002 were collected by means of maternal report. Two expert industrial hygienists estimated exposure intensity and frequency to insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for exposure to any pesticide and to any class of pesticide (yes/no; and by median), and exposure to combinations of pesticides (yes/no) and risk of spina bifida. Adjusted odds ratios were also estimated by parent exposed to pesticides (neither, mother only, father only, both parents). Joint parental occupational pesticide exposure was positively associated with spina bifida (aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.9-2.4) when compared with infants with neither maternal nor paternal exposures; a similar association was not observed when only one parent was exposed. There was a suggested positive association between combined paternal insecticide and fungicide exposures and spina bifida (aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.8-2.8), however, nearly all other aORs were close to unity. Overall, there was little evidence paternal occupational pesticide exposure was associated with spina bifida. However, the small numbers make it difficult to precisely evaluate the role of pesticide classes, individually and in combination. Birth Defects Research (Part A) 106:963-971, 2016.

METHODS: The cases were children with spina bifida aperta born between 1980 and 1992 from nine hospitals in the Netherlands. The controls were children born healthy in the same period as the cases, from hospitals and from the general population. Data collection was carried out in two steps. Firstly, postal questionnaires were sent to all the parents of cases and controls to gather information on occupations and potential confounders. In the second phase of the study, information on specific exposures was collected by means of job and task specific personal interviews. Interviews were performed with 55 case mothers and 66 control mothers who had occupations with a potential for chemical or physical exposure. Those exposures were assumed to be negligible for--for example, teachers and secretaries, so personal interviews were not indicated for these women. Information was collected on specific tasks in the period just after conception, and on the associated use of chemical or physical agents, frequency of exposure, and use of protective equipment. RESULTS: The analyses of occupation showed an increased risk for women working in agricultural occupations (OR = 3.4, CI:1.3-9.0), and, although less distinct, for cleaning women (OR = 1.7, CI:0.9-3.4). Only a few women seemed to be occupationally exposed to chemical or physical agents. No differences in occurrence of specific exposures could be detected between cases and controls. Besides, no differences were seen in pesticide or disinfectant exposure among case and control mothers in agricultural occupations. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposures of the mother during pregnancy were infrequent and did not seem to play an important part in the aetiology of spina bifida in this study. The association found between spina bifida and maternal agricultural occupations could not be explained by the\n\nIs autonomy related to the quality of performance of everyday activities in children with spina bifida?\n\nPubMed\n\nPeny-Dahlstrand, Marie; Krumlinde-Sundholm, Lena; Gosman-HedstrÃ¶m, Gunilla\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo investigate the relationship between the level of autonomy and the quality of performance of everyday activities in a population-based cohort of children with spina bifida and to study the agreement between the children's and the parents' ratings of autonomy. 50 dyads of children (aged 6-14) with spina bifida and their parents rated the children's level of autonomy with an adapted, Swedish version of the Autonomy Scale from the Arc's Self-Determination Scale. Each child's quality of performance of everyday activities was assessed with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS). The autonomy levels of the children with spina bifida were rated to be lowest in daily routines and highest in leisure activities. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that age, motor skills and process skills were all significantly related to the autonomy level, but that process skills appeared to predominate in this respect. Concerning the perception of the autonomy level, little agreement was found between each child and his/her parent. It is important to understand and support the development of process skills as expressed in task performance in children with spina bifida and to pay attention to both the parent's and the child's opinion when setting goals and plans for interventions.\n\nEffect of bladder augmentation on VP shunt failure rates in spina bifida.\n\nPubMed\n\nGonzalez, Dani O; Cooper, Jennifer N; McLeod, Daryl J\n\n2017-12-11\n\nMost patients with spina bifida require ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement. Some also require bladder augmentation, which may increase the risk of VP shunt malfunction and/or failure. The aim of this study was to assess whether bladder augmentation affects the rate of VP shunt failure in this population. Using the Pediatric Health Information System, we studied patients with spina bifida born between 1992 and 2014 who underwent VP shunt placement. Using conditional logistic regression, we compared age- and hospital-matched patients who did and did not undergo a bladder augmentation to determine their difference in rates of VP shunt failure. There were 4192 patients with spina bifida who underwent both surgical closure and VP shunt placement. Of these, 203 patients with bladder augmentation could be matched to 593 patients without bladder augmentation. VP shunt failure occurred within 2 years in 7.7% of patients, the majority of whom were in the group who underwent bladder augmentation (87%). After adjusting for confounders, undergoing bladder augmentation was independently associated with VP shunt failure (HR: 33.5, 95% CI: 13.15-85.44, p< 0.001). Bladder augmentation appears to be associated with VP shunt failure. Additional studies are necessary to better define this relationship and identify risk-reduction techniques.\n\nCognitive changes after cerebrospinal fluid shunting in young adults with spina bifida and assumed arrested hydrocephalus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMataro, M.; Poca, M. A.; Sahuquillo, J.; Cuxart, A.; Iborra, J.; de la Calzada, M. D.; Junque, C.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVESâTo establish whether surgery can improve the neuropsychological functioning of young adult patients with spina bifida and apparent clinically arrested hydrocephalus showing abnormal intracranial pressure.â¨METHODSâTwenty three young adults with spina bifida and assumed arrested hydrocephalus (diagnosed as active or compensated by continuous intracranial pressure monitoring) underwent surgery. All patients received neuropsychological examination before surgery and 6 months later. Neuropsychological assessment included tests of verbal and visual memory, visuospatial functions, speed of mental processing, and frontal lobe functions.â¨RESULTSâShunt placement in this subgroup of patients improves neuropsychological functioning, especially in verbal and visual memory and attention and cognitive flexibility.â¨CONCLUSIONSâYoung adults with spina bifida and suspected non-functioning shunt or non-shunted ventriculomegaly should be carefully monitored to identify those who could benefit from shunting.â¨â¨ PMID:10766893\n\nSexual function and erection capability among young men with spina bifida.\n\nPubMed\n\nSandler, A D; Worley, G; Leroy, E C; Stanley, S D; Kalman, S\n\n1996-09-01\n\nIn a study of sexual function and erection capability, 15 young men with spina bifida were interviewed, underwent physical examination, and completed two consecutive night recordings of penile tumescence and rigidity with the Rigi-Scan (Dacomed Inc.). Eleven reported erections with stimulation. Rigi-Scan data showed that two subjects (both with lesions at the sacral level) had normal numbers and durations of erections, that seven others had abnormally brief and infrequent nocturnal erections, and that six had none. Ten subjects had at least 'some' glans sensation on physical examination. Self-reported erection capability was related to motor level and glans sensation. The number of nocturnal erections was related to sensory level. The study suggests that lower motor and sensory levels are associated with greater potential sexual function in males with spina bifida.\n\nNeurological bypass for sensory innervation of the penis in patients with spina bifida.\n\nPubMed\n\nOvergoor, Max L E; Kon, Moshe; Cohen-Kettenis, Peggy T; Strijbos, Saskia A M; de Boer, Niels; de Jong, Tom P V M\n\n2006-09-01\n\nMost male patients with spina bifida have normal sexual desires. During puberty they begin to realize that they can achieve erection and sexual intercourse but without any sensation in the penis. We hypothesized that restored sensation in the penis would greatly contribute to their quality of life and sexual health. In this prospective study we investigated the outcome of a new operative neurological bypass procedure in patients with spina bifida. In 3 patients who were 17, 18 and 21 years old with a spinal lesion at L5, L4 and L3-L4, respectively, the sensory ilioinguinal nerve (L1) was cut distal in the groin and joined by microneurorrhaphy to the divided ipsilateral dorsal nerve of the penis (S2-4) at the base of the penis. All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative neurological and psychological evaluations. By 15 months postoperatively all patients had achieved excellent sensation on the operated side of the glans penis. They were unequivocally positive about the results and the penis had become more integrated into the body image. In 2 patients masturbation became more meaningful and 1 became more sexually active with and without his partner. The newly designed neurological bypass procedure in patients with spina bifida resulted in excellent sensibility in the glans penis. The new sensation appeared to contribute to the quality of the patient sexuality and sexual functioning as well as to the feeling of being a more normal and complete individual who is more conscious of the penis. This new operation might become standard treatment in patients with spina bifida in the future.\n\nRetrospective Assessment of Cost Savings From Prevention: Folic Acid Fortification and Spina Bifida in the U.S.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrosse, Scott D; Berry, Robert J; Mick Tilford, J; Kucik, James E; Waitzman, Norman J\n\n2016-05-01\n\nAlthough fortification of food with folic acid has been calculated to be cost saving in the U.S., updated estimates are needed. This analysis calculates new estimates from the societal perspective of net cost savings per year associated with mandatory folic acid fortification of enriched cereal grain products in the U.S. that was implemented during 1997-1998. Estimates of annual numbers of live-born spina bifida cases in 1995-1996 relative to 1999-2011 based on birth defects surveillance data were combined during 2015 with published estimates of the present value of lifetime direct costs updated in 2014 U.S. dollars for a live-born infant with spina bifida to estimate avoided direct costs and net cost savings. The fortification mandate is estimated to have reduced the annual number of U.S. live-born spina bifida cases by 767, with a lower-bound estimate of 614. The present value of mean direct lifetime cost per infant with spina bifida is estimated to be $791,900, or $577,000 excluding caregiving costs. Using a best estimate of numbers of avoided live-born spina bifida cases, fortification is estimated to reduce the present value of total direct costs for each year's birth cohort by $603 million more than the cost of fortification. A lower-bound estimate of cost savings using conservative assumptions, including the upper-bound estimate of fortification cost, is $299 million. The estimates of cost savings are larger than previously reported, even using conservative assumptions. The analysis can also inform assessments of folic acid fortification in other countries.

Cases of spina bifida (n = 1154) and control subjects (n = 9439) from the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study (1976-2011) were included. Information on preexisting diabetes mellitus (collected 1976-2011) and obesity (collected 1993-2011), defined as a body mass index of â¥30 kg/m(2), was collected through interviews that were conducted within 6 months of delivery. Periconceptional folic acid intake was calculated with both dietary and supplement information. Mothers were classified as consuming more or less than 400 Î¼g/day of folic acid; food folate was included at a 30% discount for its lower bioavailability. Logistic regression models that were adjusted for maternal age, race, education, and study site were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the joint effects of low folic acid intake coupled with diabetes mellitus or obesity. Case mothers were more likely to have diabetes mellitus or be obese (0.7% and 19.0%, respectively) than control mothers (0.4% and 10.8%, respectively). The joint effect of diabetes mellitus and lower folic acid intake on spina bifida was larger (aOR, 3.95; 95% CI, 1.56-10.00) than that of diabetes mellitus and higher folic acid intake (aOR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.17-10.30). Folic acid intake made little difference on the association between obesity and spina bifida. Our findings suggest that folic acid further attenuates, although does not eliminate, the risk of spina bifida that is associated with diabetes mellitus than the risk with obesity.

The aim of this prospective study was to determine the prognostic value of neurophysiological investigations compared to clinical neurological examination in infants with spina bifida. Thirty-six neonates born with spina bifida between 2002 and 2007 were evaluated and followed for 2 years. Lumbar motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were obtained at the median age of 2 days old before surgical closure of the spinal anomaly. MEPs were recorded from the quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles and CMAPs from the latter two muscles. Areas under the curve and latencies of the MEPs and CMAPs were measured. Clinical neurological outcome at the age of 2 years was described using Muscle Function Classes (MFCs) and ambulation status. The areas under the curve of MEPs and CMAPs in the legs were associated with lower neonatal levels of motor and sensory impairment. Better muscle function class of the lower limbs at 2 years of age was associated with larger MEP and CMAP areas of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles at neonatal age. MEPs and CMAPs of the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles are of prognostic value for clinical neurological outcome in neonates born with spina bifida.

We hypothesized that relating the BPD measurement to the transverse abdominal diameter (TAD) might be another simple and effective screening method. In this study we assessed the performance of using the BPD/TAD ratio during the first trimester of pregnancy in screening for open spina bifida. A total of 20,551 first-trimester ultrasound scans (11-13 weeks' gestation), performed between 2000 and 2013, were analyzed retrospectively; there were 26 cases of open spina bifida and 17,665 unaffected pregnancies with a crown-rump length of 45-84âmm and a record of both BPD and TAD measurements. The mean (Â±âSD) BPD/TAD ratio was 1.00âÂ±â0.06 for fetuses with spina bifida and 1.13âÂ±â0.06 for those without (Pâ<â0.0001). A BPD â¤â5(th) percentile enabled the prenatal detection of 46.2% of spina bifida cases, while a BPD/TAD ratio ofââ¤â1.00 detected 69.2%. If we considered cases in which either BPD was â¤â5(th) percentile or BPD/TAD ratio was â¤â1, we identified 76.9% of cases. In the latter case, the false-positive rate was 5.1%, while that for using a combination of both BPD â¤â5th percentile and BPD/TAD ratioââ¤â1 was 0.6%, with a sensitivity of 38.5%. The positive predictive value of using a combination of BPDââ¤â5th percentile and BPD/TAD ratioââ¤â1 for detecting spina bifida was 8.5%. Between 11 and 13 weeks' gestation, relating BPD to TAD improves considerably the diagnostic performance of using BPD measurement alone in screening for open spina bifida. Screening using this marker is simple and applicable to a large population. Copyright Â© 2014 ISUOG.

The degree of the acquired deformities and the mobility of the patient depend on the level of the spinal lesion. Neurological symptoms are mostly asymmetric and there is an inconsistent correlation between the anatomical level of the lesion and muscle function. Deficits of sensation are usually one to two levels lower than the motor level. An exact neurological diagnosis should not be made before the second or third year of life and an early prognosis about walking ability should be avoided. The level L3 and therefore function of the quadriceps is a functional milestone after which modified independent ambulation with the use of ankle foot orthoses (AFO) and crutches is possible. The basic principle is to support verticalization and gait even when loss of ambulation is later expected. It is also important to support and maintain sitting ability for high lesions, if necessary with correction of the spinal deformity. Findings in gait analysis have shifted the focus of treatment from radiological criteria to functional improvement, thus maintenance of the flexibility of the hip is the main goal of hip surgery. Reduction of the hip often leads to stiffness and has a high redislocation rate. Clubfoot deformities should be treated early and foot arthrodesis and stiffness have to be avoided. Another focus is the prevention of joint contracture by early prophylactic treatment. The purpose of management is to maximize the functional potential of the child. Subjective well-being, absence of pain, mobility and socialization are the main goals. This does not necessarily imply ambulation; nevertheless, verticalization and associated orthotic management is one major objective of the orthopedic management of spina bifida.\n\nA comparison between placental and amniotic mesenchymal stem cells for transamniotic stem cell therapy (TRASCET) in experimental spina bifida.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeng, Christina; D Graham, Christopher; Connors, John Patrick; Brazzo, Joseph; Zurakowski, David; Fauza, Dario O\n\n2016-06-01\n\nWe compared placental-derived and amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (pMSCs and afMSCs, respectively) in transamniotic stem cell therapy (TRASCET) for experimental spina bifida. Pregnant dams (n=29) exposed to retinoic acid for the induction of fetal spina bifida were divided into four groups. Three groups received volume-matched intraamniotic injections of either saline (n=38 fetuses) or a suspension of 2Ã10(6) cells/mL of syngeneic, labeled afMSCs (n=73) or pMSCs (n=115) on gestational day 17 (term=21-22days). Untreated fetuses served as controls. Animals were killed before term. Statistical comparisons were by Fisher's exact test (p<0.05). Survival was similar across treatment groups (p=0.08). In fetuses with isolated spina bifida (n=100), there were higher percentages of defect coverage (either partial or complete) in both afMSC and pMSC groups compared with saline and untreated groups (p<0.001-0.03 in pairwise comparisons). There were no differences in coverage rates between afMSC and pMSC groups (p=0.94) or between saline and untreated groups (p=0.98). Both pMSC and afMSC can induce comparable rates of coverage of experimental spina bifida after concentrated intraamniotic injection in the rodent model. This broadens the options for timing and cell source for TRASCET as a potential alternative in the prenatal management of spina bifida. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Overcoming systemic barriers to their integration into a comprehensive care system is essential. By providing routine and disability specific care through the structure of a Medical Home, they are often the first line resource and support for individuals and their families. The Medical Home model encourages primary care providers to facilitate discussions on topics as varied as education and employment. Knowledge of specific medical issues unique to this population allows the primary care provider to complement the efforts of other specialty clinics and providers in often neglected areas such as sexual health, obesity and latex sensitization. As individuals with spina bifida live into adulthood, and access to traditional multidisciplinary care models evolves, these skills will take on increasing importance within the scope of providing comprehensive and coordinated care.\n\nPredictors of parenting stress in mothers of children with spina bifida.\n\nPubMed\n\nKanaheswari, Y; Razak, N N A; Chandran, V; Ong, L C\n\n2011-03-01\n\nProspective cross-sectional multidimensional study using clinical assessment and standard measures.

Spina bifida clinics of two tertiary hospitals in urban Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A total of 81 mothers of children aged 1-18 years completed the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI/SF). Each child's adaptive skills were assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS), Interview Edition. Medical and social data were obtained from direct interviews and case note reviews. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to investigate factors that were determinants for high scores in the parental distress (PD), difficult child (DC) and parent-child dysfunctional interaction (P-CDI) subdomains of the PSI/SF. Results were expressed as beta coefficient (Î²) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Single-parent families (Î² 8.6, 95% CI 3.4-13.9) and the need for clean intermittent catheterization of bladder (Î² 3.5, 95% CI 0.7-6.2) were associated with high PD scores. Clean intermittent catheterization (Î² 3.0, 95% CI 0.5-5.5) was associated with higher DC scores. Lower composite VABS scores (Î² -0.08, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.15) and mother as the sole caregiver (Î² 2.6, 95% CI 0.15-4.96) was associated with higher P-CDI scores. The need for clean intermittent catheterization was the only medical factor associated with parenting stress in mothers of children with spina bifida. This was mediated by single parenthood, caregiver status and the child's adaptive skills.\n\nCHKA and PCYT1A gene polymorphisms, choline intake and spina bifida risk in a California population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEnaw, James O Ebot; Zhu, Huiping; Yang, We"
