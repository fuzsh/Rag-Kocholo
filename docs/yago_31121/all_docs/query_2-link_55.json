On the 1st of January 2010 Linnaeus University opened its doors for the irst time as the newest university of Sweden, the result of a merger between University of Kalmar and Växjö University. Linnaeus University is a modern, international university in Småland. Although Gunilla never worked at Linnaeus University, she represents its fundamental ideas in an excellent manner. Gunilla's research has been modern and international in the sense that she analyses the relationship between people, ICT, society and the environment. She proposes research questions for the future, and presents actions to achieve a good ICT society. Last but not least, Gunilla was born in Småland. Curiosity, creativity, companionship and utility – these are the terms by which we interpret Carl Linnaeus' achievements. This mission is also very much relevant for Gunilla's research. Linnaeus University would like to thank Gunilla for her signiicant research efforts and hope that she will continue to support researchers in informatics and media technology at our university. Stephen Hwang Rector Lena Fritzén Prorector\n\nxvii\n\nPreface\n\nIn 1970’s there were not many people that inquired about the psychological and social effects of this thing we today label ‘Information and Communication Technology’. Professor Emerita Dr Gunilla Bradley did this; and this is the key reason for the design and writing of this unique volume! Recently, Professor Bradley celebrated happily her 70th birthday while continuing to astonish us with her formulation of new, yet not heard of, quests for knowledge – just as she started to do this nearly four decades ago… To honour Professor Bradley, more than forty well established scholars, within various related disciplines, have contributed with leading edge essays. Each contribution articulates a set of aspects of information and communication technologies in human and social contexts, such as the individuals, groups, organisations and their management – addressing both descriptive and normative questions. In that manner, as a collection of research essays this volume represents a unique presentation of the ield understood here as Social Informatics. However, unlike most of available assembled volumes, this book offers its reader two additional contributions. Firstly, the included essays conceived together as a whole give rise to an emergent message, that none of the essay presents itself. The working assumption here is that the identiied emergent message articulates the hidden structure of the intellectual ield of Social Informatics. Secondly, colourful biographical notes of Professor Gunilla Bradley are presented in a fashion that communicates some central characteristics of a pioneering scholar. Being recognised as one of the leading developers and proponents of Social Informatics, these biographical notes serve as a source of inspiration and role model for younger researchers. We warmly welcome the reader into a journey of intellectual rigour, novelty, curiosity, drama, and futurology…\n\nINTRODUCTION Information and Communication technology (ICT) and its effects on human beings and society is the theme of this book. By that, this book addresses the interaction between the ICT, the Individual, the Organizations, and the Society. Analyses of interactions, human effects and the interrelations are important since these result in reciprocal effects which may reinforce each other in both positive and negative ways. Changes in behaviour, perspectives, values, competencies, social and psychological aspects, etc. are all of human concern. This means that we need to critically relect on how behaviour, values, competencies, etc. are inluenced, shaped and directed by ICT use and thus, are being extended to the human and social conditions of mankind.\n\nxviii\n\nThis recognition is by now established. Computer Science and ICT related disciplines work more and more together with behavioural and social sciences to contribute to studies of cognitive effects and changes, psychosocial changes, motivational and emotional changes, organisational and institutional changes, societal changes, value changes and new lifestyles; all these are examples of this extensive research area that addresses interrelations of ICT, Society, and Human Beings. This book includes a unique presentation of the ield of ICT and Social Change, which is an area of immense attention in contemporary life, both private and professional. The developments in computer technology, telecommunication technology, and media technology have led to, the so-called, converging technologies, which also converge our private and professional lives, and our private and professional roles. Professor Emerita Gunilla Bradley, to whom this book is dedicated, holds close to forty years of pioneering research in this ield. A succinct extraction of her lifelong research is illustrated in the Bradley Convergence Model, which is presented in Section 2. The model as such is in principle a graphical illustration of ongoing changes in the Information Society, also called the Net Society. It syntheses theoretical frameworks in Bradley’s research on psychosocial work environment and computerization based on experience from research programs starting in the 1970’s and carried out during various phases of the history of computerization. The main message of the model is its articulation of key generative mechanism that ICT brings into our social world, which in turn transforms this social world. The Net Society is the emerging result driven by this generative and transformative mechanism. The Convergence Model, and Dr Bradley’s research, has inluenced and continues to inluence and inspire scholars around the world. This book is based on forty-three contributions mostly written by senior researchers, of which a majority have a lifelong research experience within the ield of ICT and Social Change. The book also contains contributions from younger researchers who grew up with the new technology. Most of the contributions in the book are novel essays that represent contemporary international research. Yet, the book also embraces a historical perspective through some contributions written more than twenty years ago. In what follows, these essays are introduced and grouped in eight parts. These parts are all related to the life long pioneering research of Professor Emerita Gunilla Bradley and the inluence and inspiration her work has had on scholars around the world. The reader may also ind this book as a guide that includes fruitful exploratory research orientations. These may serve as a point of reference for further research on what remains a profound challenge for our human endeavours: the future interconnected global society and economy, all by technology.\n\nSeCTION 1: GUNIlla BRaDley’S ReSeaRCh jOURNey The innovative nature of the research discussed in this book has been very stimulating for a long time, changing the world profoundly. With current technological developments, human actions have become more diligent, challenging the design of new technologies with an unprecedented scope. Positively, the technological revolution has deeply affected many aspects of human lives, e.g., making it easier to communicate, socialize and develop relation over distances. To put forward this remarkable change, this part begins by presenting the colourful biography of Gunilla Bradley. This biography precisely presents innovative exploratory research, in relation to psychosocial and technological aspects, which are Gunilla’s substantial and constructive contributions in her life-long pioneering research. It brings the context of many ideas where psychological, sociological and technological issues have engaged Gunilla for some time now, and inspired researchers across the world.\n\nxix\n\nThis part also contains two special essays written by Annagreta Dyring who has a long professional relationship to Gunilla and Geraldine Pratchett-Hultkrantz, Gunilla’s best friend. Both have deep insights in the academic world. Annagreta gives a presentation of Gunilla’s passion, strength and knowledge in the ield of Information and Communication Technology. She illustrates in a very melodic manner the engagement of Gunilla’s outstanding work and research in this ield. She has remarkably described Gunilla’s intuition and interests, especially with her role of stimulating women to contribute to areas of research, such as technological developments, which traditionally have been seen to belong to men. Geraldine’s, essay continues to bring up marvellous achievements and qualities of Gunilla’s experience for many decades. She describes in a very tranquil way all of Gunilla’s different challenges that have followed her life. Even more, Geraldine develops her essay by continuously presenting Gunilla’s unique professionalism and fruitful contributions in the area of ICT to the whole world.\n\nSeCTION 2: The CONveRGeNCe TheORy ON ICT, SOCIeTy, aND hUmaN BeINGS This part sets off by Gunilla Bradley’s summarising overview of her Convergence Model and illustrations on ongoing changes in the Net Society. The description of the model is kept short and structured with reference to the concepts Globalization, ICT, Life Environment, Life Role, and Effects on Humans. For interested readers, the essay includes references to other publications where the theoretical framework, which this model builds on, is elaborated more. The subsequent essays elaborate on parts of the Convergence Model. The irst is William McIver’s analogy to the science of ‘Ekistics’, i.e., human settlements, which include regional, city, community planning and residential design. He points at the comprehensive and systemic view of the Convergence Model which has provided a framework that enables understanding of the relation between previously studied disparate phenomena. He also put forward the model as a conceptual device for elaborating on advancing societal transformation toward improved human quality. Larry Stillman and Tom Denison, in the next essay, make some comparisons between the convergence theory and Anthony Gidden´s structuration theory. They suggest linking to Gidden’s Structuration Theory and state that the model has the opportunity to mediate the agency-structure dichotomy. They underline that ICT mediates the constitution of both agency and structure and, simultaneously, the two create ICT. This perspective implies that ICT is both a product and a process of human intentionality and choices, and of social structures and impositions. Kristina Orth-Gomér continues. Her contribution is an elaboration on the Convergence Model’s contribution for the development of human well-being and this is done from a medical and public health perspective. Orth-Gomér recalls the variety of independent research that sends the same signal: the quantity and quality of human interaction in social settings is needed for human wellbeing! In this, the Convergence Model characterizes the societal dynamic of such human interactions, as induced and transformed by ICT. Moreover, Bradley’s advancement of the so-called concept “Smart-homes” offers a future human environment that can enable such social interactions and, thus, contribute to the human well-being. In the inal essay of Section 2, Alice Robbin addresses a particular aspect of social interaction that is ICT mediated, namely the induced multi-tasking. Thus, the introduction of ICT in the various human and social context, work or private, exposes humans for constant and dynamic interruptions with\n\nxx\n\nchanges of attention and meaning, hence changes in mental or cognitive activities. In this context, the technological convergence as well as the convergence of conventional social roles and life environments may produce an increased opportunity for multi-tasking. This, in turn, may pose an opportunity and a challenge, in the latter leading to a cognitive burden, stress and failure. Therefore, there is a need for normative considerations of the design, introduction and utilisation of ICT, all aimed at Bradley’s visions of a “people-centred perspective” in order to achieve “the good society”. To sum up the overall message of this part, Bradley’s Convergence Model offers an understanding of the relation of converging ICT and globalization to the human and societal forces which are involved in societal transformations. This understanding, in turn, may guide us to directing the transformation towards the achievement of human well-being and control, rather than becoming its victims or products.\n\nSeCTION 3: PSyChOlOGICal & USaBIlITy aSPeCTS Of ICT The contributions of Michael J.H. Smith and colleagues introduce section 3. Prof. Smith looks back at more than thirty years of acquaintance with Gunilla Bradley and her research. He acknowledges the inspiration and insight that he and many others around the world has gained through Bradley’s research on how ICT transforms our daily lives and through her promotion of quality of life issues. The two subsequent articles are reprints of Human Factors and Ergonomics Society publications in honour of Gunilla Bradley, to illustrate her inluence on their work. One article deals with how electronically monitoring worker performance may lead to psychosocial stress and related somatic symptoms. The second article hypothesizes that the psychosocial stress encountered in the working conditions, created by computer technology, may lead to musculoskeletal symptoms in workers independently from the physical ergonomic considerations of their work. Michelle Robertson advances the relation between ICT, psychosocial work environment and health, including family life and leisure time. She points to research results that illustrate the complexity surrounding computer use and impact of ICT on knowledge workers. Her indings show that an individual’s success of interaction with ICT, particularly the elimination of stress, is conditioned both by micro-aspect of the terminal, such as information and system design, and even more by macro-aspects, such as organisational structures, culture, leadership, role or job design, education and communication structures and processes. Holger Luczak and colleagues are analysing their experimental evaluations of human-computer interaction among elderly people in terms of various input devices. Physical and cognitive deiciencies, which emerge in humans due to aging, limit the ability to interact with ICT. The indings based on their experiments support and emphasize that the technology have to be designed in a manner that compensates these deiciencies and, thus, facilitates effective ICT interaction. The contribution of Vladimir Munipov illustrates the inluence of Bradley’s work on the development of social and psychological aspects of ergonomics in the former Soviet Union and Russia. Munipov suggests that the human-centred design of ICT, as advocated by Bradley, requires that human mental processes must be mediated by ICT in a comprehensive manner, so that human meaning is enabled and mediated. By that Munipov, drawing on Bradley’s research, departs from the Russian prevailing model of cognitive processes as forms of activity. Hal Hendrick’s exploration of man’s various cognitive styles – e.g. conformist or creative – shows that this does not only determine the way man cognises his or her problem situations at hand, but also\n\nxxi\n\nthe way man interacts with his or her organisational context and with the ICT-mediated information. Hendrick found that in the latter context, cognitively concrete people want their information presented in a clear, unambiguous, step-by-step approach and are less concerned about the underlying rational, principles, or conceptual basis of the material. In contrast, cognitively complex people prefer to have the material presented in a manner that enables them to grasp the underlying concepts and principles. Sebastiano Bagnara and Simone Pozzi advocate that in ICT design, including interfaces and mode of human interaction, the conventional approach of studying the average users, on which to base design decisions, should be given up. They argue for a HCI movement from a nomothetic research mode, that focus on the identiication of general and universal mechanisms of human behaviour, to an idiographic mode, which looks upon the individual as a unique personality. The latter approach focuses on a personalised design, whic adapts the mode of interaction to particular users needs and cognitive styles. Linked to personalized design are approaches aimed at privacy-enhancing identity management as put forward by Simone Fischer-Hübner and John Sören Pettersson. They point to challenges in relation to HCI design for managing privacy in human and social affairs. The authors note that privacy-enhancing identity management implies that users can make informed choices about releases of personal data, selections of credentials for proving personal properties, and about their privacy and trust policy settings. The inal contribution of section 3 is Birgitta Bergvall-Kåreborn and Anna Ståhlbröst who elaborate the phenomenon of Living Lab. This is the term for a development and test milieu, where ICT may be shaped in a participatory and human-centred manner. The notion of Living Lab implies a real-life milieu where actual or natural human conditions and situations are part of the development process. This is a long step from conventional IS development approaches, which has little or no chance to account for human actual situations. In addition, the ultimate idea for the Living Lab milieu and approach is to offer new ways of managing innovation processes.\n\nSeCTION 4: ICT IN WORk lIfe aND PRIvaTe lIfe – ORGaNISaTIONal aND PSyChOSOCIal aSPeCTS Eila Järvenpää and Stina Immonen address how ICT as a tool in the workplace has transformed the conduct of work. In this transition – from old-fashioned, paper and pen based ofice work, to contemporary knowledge-based and ICT enabled work proiles – they argue that little research is produced regarding the work, stress and well-being in the context of ICT enabling knowledge based work. Their study ranges from 1970’s and onwards, studying the use of ICT applications for ofice work. They conclude that even though applications have become more advanced, the nature of (knowledge) work and user needs may not have been appropriately taken into account. The key focus of the published research seems to be put into visual display units! Peter Hoonakker et.al. continue on this theme in their essay on work environment in intensive care units and the introduction of telemedicine. Although promising, research is needed in a number of issues, e.g., how tele-intensive-care-units affect communication and trust in the work team, how the technological environment affects staff work load, quality of care and patient safety. The authors set out to examine some of these issues from a socio-technical perspective including key factors related to work in virtual teams. In the next essay Jacques Steyn argues that contemporary design of ICT and the employment of ICT in various contexts – also other than workplace – mimics the industrial work-place. He suggests that the\n\nxxii\n\nwork-oriented design should be replaced by human-needs centred design, which will help to reduce task load, effort and stress, and open up for increased human satisfaction and well-being. Steyn exempliies his ideas of this non work-space design approach through the function of social media, such as Facebook, that manage to satisfy the human need of social belonging. Ulrika Danielsson and Karin Danielsson Öberg review research that addresses the blurring of the boarders between workspace and leisure space, as induced by ICT. Today, being physically away from the workplace does not mean that we are necessarily changing to another environment or leaving our work tasks behind in psychological terms. The authors identify a set of challenges for humans, such as overload, stress and fatigue. Their suggestion to promote human well-being is to design ICT in a manner that articulates and communicates the distinctions between leisure and work. The design challenges are thus to attend to the borderlines between different life roles and life environments. Hans-Erik Nissen, inally, elaborates on the design of ICT to enable human centred communication and action. He suggests that ICT design from a human-oriented perspective, should be broadened from ICT as a tool for control – of a machine or human being – to ICT incorporated as a means to facilitate sense-making, understanding and critical argumentation. Enabling juxtaposition of competing facts and values is a particular requirement for various democratic processes and empowerment of people dominated by unwanted structures, whether in the work-place or society. Nissen ponders on Web 2.0 enabled e-conferences as such means.\n\nSeCTION 5: e-CONfeReNCeS & e-leaRNING The essays of section 5 contribute to what Bradley refers to as Global Spaces, in this case, in the ield of academic events and higher education. New possibilities and dimensions for teaching, learning and interaction are proposed. Pedro Isaías discusses using Web 2.0 to combine real and on-line conferences. Virve Siirak argues for instructional design, which blends ICT mediated and face-to-face communication and has a base in social constructivist learning theory, for developing both eficient learning and a learning culture. Finally, Elspeth McKay bases her argument in awareness of different cognitive styles when designing courses and courseware. For effective learning design her advice is attention to the humandimension of human-computer interaction (HCI) as reinforced by Gunilla Bradley’s Convergence Model. Professor Bradley’s research into interacive efects of ICT tools taps right into some of the issues faced by people who uilize their right for informaion access. As illustrated in this part, the theory related to Bradley’s psychosocial life environment and quality of life and well-being, has been an inspiraion for researchers also in the ield of e-conferences and e-learning.\n\nSeCTION 6: The INfORmaTION aND COmmUNICaTION SOCIeTy The Information and Communication Society provides us with unique challenges - opportunities as well as risks. This is the theme of the included contributions in section 6. Simon Rogerson looks afresh on the current potentials of the so-called Information Age, which has stimulated people across the world to communicate across the giant network, forming a new global society, the Information Society. Looking back at Gunilla’s good society, the Information Society is seen as a potential to practice ethical considerations that are of great value, composing a good global society. Furthermore, Rogerson addresses the\n\nxxiii\n\nvery subject matter of ICT-devices: the information. He highlights that the central matter of ICT is the trustworthiness of the information provided by our tools rather than its quantity and frequency. He argues that the rapid development and integration of various kinds of ICT threatens the quality of provided information. Further, according to Rogerson, the dramatic consequences of unreliable information imply that we have a moral obligation to address information integrity. ICT allows us to blend forms, such as prose, poetry, music and pictures, and deliver them using, for example, writing and singing in either a serious or humorous fashion. We need to learn how to beneit from this varied diet of it-for-purpose information and how to judge trustworthy information. Peter Crowley continues in this theme by addressing the role of ICT for the continuous establishment and re-establishment of our civil societies. He stresses the need of mindfulness to avoid merely ‘technology push’ approaches where ICT is introduced as such, for the sake of itself, or only for commercial reasons. Crowley suggests engaging in the matter by converging a top down and a bottom up approach. By top down he proposes that governments and international organisations provide adequate literacy enabling structures, as well as affordable and accessible technology infrastructures. By the bottom up approach he proposes to include a self-organising civil society, both local and global. He argues that the bottom up is both desirable and necessary to complement the top down for reaching sustainable development and global justice. Challenges he points out, include avoiding permanently locked society into the divide of information-rich and information-poor, thus creating information feudalism or the ‘digital divide’. The growth of ICT support for a variety of social and community networks has allowed for a rich and complex range of interactions and methods of participation. Barrett Caldwell argues that the use of such networks can be considered as enabling technologies to support previously dificult social interactions, e.g., when being separated by time or distance, or experiencing complications due to social dynamics. To study social interactions in ICTs he suggests some quantitative analytical tools based on engineering and measures of eficiency and effort required to sustain connections between entities. These measures are referred to as mathematical properties of coupling, persistence and work functions. The belief is that our understanding of social and technological dynamics, and ultimately social networks behaviour in the Information Society, will progress and will be enhanced through applying the suggested tools. Sarai Lastra addresses the ICT use and social factors for supporting democratic processes in communities. She proposes a participatory design approach for understanding the essence and ethos of a community. Her inding is that community events are assets that represent collective knowledge. These assets are formed by an emerging collective belief system that inluences community actions and relationships. Lastra’s proposed design approach aims for a high degree of participation by the community members with the purpose of aligning the ICT being designed with the community ethos. The subsequent essay by Sangeeta Sharma addresses the focal research problem of how ICT can help in formation of socio-ethically inclusive societies with universal ethics as the epicentre. The process of globalization is unifying various cultures leading to the creation of Multiculturalists society. As an effect various ethnic groups are expanding their boundaries to form larger social structures. Although social mixing, ethnic groups have own social spaces where the concept of spatial management can contribute. Spaces of various ethno-cultural formations are merged into single social unit. The merging can be facilitated by building up mutual trust and respect for each other, which in turn can be reinforced by communicating with the help of Information and Communication Technologies. Hence, the role of ICT in enhancing the process of uniication is crucial to develop social reconiguration and new identities as it penetrates the tightened boundaries of ethnic groups.\n\nxxiv\n\nMargaret Tan puts attention to the Information Society from the perspective of interconnectivity of fast evolving digital technologies that enable individuals and communities to express, communicate, interact and to share their creative works and knowledge, leading to a so called ‘co-space’. Tan argues that this collaborative space provides a new paradigm shift to the economic and social ecology of information and knowledge creation. The new co-space can facilitate profound networks of relationships that not only constitute a valuable conduit for the conduct of social affairs but also the social production of intellectual capital. She states that the key to today’s innovations may be to develop the organisational ability to harness social production efforts so as to use them in the formulation of competitive actions at the individual, organisational as well as national level. Natalie Pang argues in a similar vein as Tan that collective processes in both virtual and physical communities contain multiplier effects. One of these effects lies in the subtractability of resources, i.e., whether or not one person’s appropriation of a resource reduces the availability of that resource for others. Pang maintains, throughout the paper, that it is essential to see all of these collective processes of interactions as two-way, dialogical relationships, that is, they never occur in isolation and are constantly in negotiation (and renegotiation) with structural forces such as their institutional frameworks and contemporary environments. She shows that “knowledge commons” have become popular for denoting public spaces that support the creation, use, and storage of public resources. These are free from market constraints, and are accessible to everyone in the community. In the area of ICT, the abundance of development agendas and plans for developing information/ knowledge societies is quite signiicant. Eduardo Villanueva Mansilla states that the agendas have taken the route towards economic and industrial development, infrastructure building, educational reform, basic social services, e-government, etc. He points out the need to shift from institutional focus of policy making to societal considerations, which include the potential for cultural development, with emphasis in the need for digital independence, not just in terms of infrastructure, but also of production and consumption of media products based on a dynamic and participatory community of users. Lorenz M. Hilty discusses the potential contribution of ICT to Sustainable Development. The necessary conditions are a reduction of the input of natural resources into industrial production and consumption. Hilty introduces a conceptual framework, which accounts for positive and negative impacts of ICT on physical lows. This framework addresses three levels: the ICT life cycle itself, life cycles of other products inluenced by ICT applications, and patterns of production and consumption. Hilty concludes that what we need is a deep structural change towards an economic system in which value-creation is mainly based on information processing, while keeping the physical properties of material within some limits that ensure that it can be recycled. In such sustainable information society, the open technological standards will play a crucial role. Social and cultural sustainability in relation to an e-commerce application used in the kitchen of a Swedish public school is the focus of the essay by Christina Mörtberg et al. They illustrate how an e-commerce application complicated the daily routines in the school kitchen rather than making the ordering of food stuff easier or more lexible. They show how small things that were vital in the staff’s day-to-day activities illuminated the e-commerce application’s problems and weaknesses. These problems highlight social and cultural sustainability including consequences of design, which lacks involvement of users in design and implementation of IT systems and services. Wolfgang Hofkirchner, the last essay of section 6, has entitled his contribution “ICTs for the Good Society”. His vision for a global information society builds on the idea of ICTs and society as a transdisciplinary research ield, which orients toward the fulilment of values that are against the rule of\n\nxxv\n\ndomination. The main argument is that not only a society that exploits nature, as was found with reduced notions of sustainability, but also a society that does not meet the criterion of social compatibility, or a society that does not abide by technology assessment, would in the long run break down and not qualify for being sustainable. In this context we notice the lifework of Gunilla Bradley, which has been intrinsically motivated towards safeguarding human well-being and the search for societal conditions that enable individual self-fulilment, given the rapid development and deployment of converging digital technologies. Hofkirchner’s conclusion is that Bradley’s focus on the Individual in the network age is crucial to the vision of the good society. The vision he considers necessary is that of a Global Sustainable Information Society.\n\nSeCTION 7: eThICal aSPeCTS ON ICT In what way should we program computers to control human beings, Jacob Palme discusses in his contribution. He brings up a critical question that relects today’s astronomic technological advancements, on which mankind act. How to program and how to control computers not to become judges? This is the main question that Palme elaborates by introducing examples related to human rules and laws. He argues that such rules and laws, interpreted by humans, are more acceptable than rules interpreted by computers. Diane Whitehouse and Penny Duquenoy continue on this theme by discussing what is the right manner to use ICT for eHealth. They have observed that many ICT practitioners ind it hard to associate the topic of ethics with their training about technologies and therefore provide us with ways in which teaching and practice for ICT professionals and trainees can be enhanced and extended to increase the awareness of ethical issues in eHealth. Jacques Berleur addresses the normative question of who is governing the Internet, and then, how is it governed? If Internet is not regarded only in technological terms, but as a social phenomenon, and an inherent part of the Information Society, the notion of self-governance or self-regulation assumes a central position. This implies that all involved actors, whether users or developers, constitute the governors. Berleur therefore puts forward some guidelines for the self-governing which builds on equality and respect for humankind. Darek Haftor continues in this vein by proposing a conceptual framework, aimed to guide normative considerations and decisions in the course of the development of ICT. The advanced proposal aims towards careful and self-critical relections on the normative decisions made when developing ICT, and also the consequences of these decisions for human and social affairs. The contribution by Kristo Ivanov concludes this part. Ivanov investigates two distinct approaches for the development of ICT – a culturally minded and a politically and ethically minded approach. He concludes that the praxis of ethically sound ICT development presupposes the existence of an ethically sound social structure – or, in other words, the ethical characteristics of ICT are the products of the ethical properties of the social systems that produce this ICT.\n\nSeCTION 8: TRaNS-DISCIPlINaRy STUDIeS The inal part that includes contributed essays is devoted to trans-disciplinary studies. Susan M. Dray addresses the relation and therein the gap, between the academic endeavour and the practice. She sug-\n\nxxvi\n\ngests that this gaps can be simpliied in terms of ‘academics don’t do practitioner relevant research, since they focus more on rigor and isolating variables rather than dealing with ‘real and complex problems’. However, practitioners have the tendency to suppress skepticism and critical thinking as a team, who always try to reach consensus and move forward. Dray states that it is crucial to bridge this gap for a “better” future for the ield of Human Computer Interaction and suggests more joint collaboration fronted by a professional association that brings people together form a variety of disciplines and geographical locations. However, trans-disciplinary and multidisciplinary engagement is a dificult and complex endeavour. Myra Strober has studied multidisciplinary seminars and the experience of the involved seminar participants. Her research provides a set of heuristic recommendations for how to succeed with interdisciplinary settings, particularly in terms of the research process. This includes making it clear for the participants that interdisciplinary research is challenging both in terms of the content and in terms of the process. The various roles and hierarchies within academic context may easily hinder open communication, hence must be recognised explicitly; this includes also respect for each other’s ideas and contributions. Additionally, the purpose of interdisciplinary dialogues must be very clear for all involved and criteria for its success. The extraordinary complexity of knowledge in today’s world creates a paradox, Strober observes. On the one hand, the complexity of knowledge induces narrower and narrow specialisations of experts. On the other hand, the real-life complexities can not be fully understood in terms of small chunks only: there is a need for a holistic comprehension of human challenges, where the various disciplinary subdomains are interrelated in a meaningful manner. We conclude that most of the chapters in this volume strive towards this holistic comprehension.\n\nSeCTION 9: The emeRGING meSSaGe The essay in part 9, written by the editors, put attention to the message that emerges out of the contributions in the previous parts. People’s use of ICTs give rise to new kinds of societies, new forms of organising, new ways of interacting. This also leads to the emergence of a new social order with inherent formal and informal inter-human power structures, which need to be governed. The unifying value among the contributors is that ICT should contribute to human well-being and some guidelines drawn out of these are summarized towards the end. The inal message we wish to convey is that ICTs, like all technologies, are a human intervention produced by ideas and aspirations to control the environment. So, following Gunilla Bradley’s words, let us use this opportunity for redesigning society towards peace, democracy, welfare and life quality for all. Darek M.

Research Overview: Social Informatics A research program on Social Informatics (SI) was elaborated in 1997 by Bradley and entitled: “Research on Interplay ICT - Humans - Society”. It also inspired other universities in Sweden and abroad and themes/tracks at international scientiic conferences in IT-related disciplines. Figure 1 is an overview of the research areas in the program: Social Informatics (SI) refers to research and study that examines societal, social, psychosocial and organisational changes at the development, introduction and use of computers and later what we name ICT. I focus on all the changes that occur at the interplay between ICT, Society, and Human Beings. SI includes research that are\n\nlabelled as Social impacts of computing, Social analysis of ICT, Studies of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC), Organizational Design and Management and ICT, Computers and Society, Organizational Informatics, Community Informatics, Media and Communications. There are new terminology contiously. The following selected books have played a major role in the process of “deining” the social informatics research programs: •\n\n•\n\n•\n\nBradley, G. (2006).

Network of Excellence: ICT and the Psychosocial Life Environment: Main Changes (Project Coordinator: Gunilla Bradley) The Network of Excellence was concerned with human organisation and psychosocial work environment related to Information and Communication Technology (ICT), as well as the psychosocial home environment. The purpose was to disseminate and synthesise research with a crossdisciplinary perspective and thereby elaborate on the interaction between ICT and work organisations, human communication, stress, allocation issues, knowledge transfer, and so called “global villages”. The purpose was also to\n\nCurriculum Vitae (CV) for Gunilla Bradley (GB)\n\ncontribute to a discussion on desirable actions on various levels and utmost how ICT can be used for deepening human qualities. The participants were distinguished researchers/ professors from Europe and some researchers from USA and South East Asia, about 10 persons. Most of the participants contributed with one chapter in the book “Humans on the Net” subtitled “ICT, Work Organization and Human Beings” (Bradley (Ed.), 2001). The network was established at an EU workshop that I was invited to organise in Brussels 1999.\n\nResearch in the 1990´s In 1991 I returned to Stanford to do the inal reporting from the research project on “Knowledge Based Systems and Organisational and Psychosocial aspects” (KBS project) and to develop new research on competence development in 10 high tech companies in Silicon Valley, top ranking in sales, proits and return on sales. Among the companies were both electronic industries and pharmaceutical industries. The focus was on main theories on competence requirements and development as well as strategies for education, in house courses, and on the job training. This study was undertaken in collaboration with the University of Southern California. In 1991 I was invited to serve as general chair (1992-1994) for the international conference on “Organizational Design and Management (ODAM IV)” with the subtitle “Development, Introduction and Use of New Technology - Challenges for Human Organization and Human Resource Development in a Changing World”. Researchers from more than 30 countries in Europe, USA and Asia participated and the proceedings are available in a hardcover book (750 pp) published by Taylor & Francis. I also served as the main editor of the book of proceedings. In 1989 I received two awards, the “Golden Leaf” for important contributions within research on psychosocial work environment and was\n\nelected to the “Professional Woman of the Year” in Sweden. In 1997 I received the IFIP Namur Award for pioneering crossdisciplinary research on the impact of Information and Communication Technology especially concerning the interaction between Technology, Organization and Humans. At the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) starting from 1994, I was involved in extensive research planning, trying to integrate international, national and local research approaches. I thereby served as program manager for the interdisciplinary research on “Interactive Creative Environments” (ICE) with the subtitle “Computers, Networks and Organizational Design Supporting Technology Transfer”. The program was coordinated from the Department of Teleinformatics, KTH. I collaborated with Faculty from the following disciplines; Social psychology and Pedagogics; Industrial economy; Regional planning; Social anthropology; Ethnology; Law and Informatics; Teleinformatics. The ICE project was directly associated with the interdisciplinary research and education program between Stanford and Swedish universities (Sweden Silicon Valley Link Program; S-SVL-program.) In the middle of the 1990s I initiated a regional development and research project supported by the EU programs “Employment” and “Adapt”. The project contained the development and implementation of an IT-center to support the upstart and survival of small enterprises in a rural area as well as strengthening the citizen’s role in the community. The research part concerned analyses of the development of networks and IT-supported organizational structures, employment rate, various aspects of quality of life, and integration of immigrants into the Swedish work life. This brought me back to my home village in Småland in the rural area in the South of Sweden. A R&D strategy was to integrate my academic, industrial, and local community networks.\n\n5\n\nCurriculum Vitae (CV) for Gunilla Bradley (GB)\n\nResearch in the 1970´s and the 1980´s The very irst part of my research focused on women in work life. I made a broad study of employees in a large commercial bank (Svenska Handelsbanken) in 1968. Based on this study I presented my Ph D thesis, entitled “Woman and Career” in 1972. I then specialized in organizational behavior and information technology and initiated and led an interdisciplinary research program on computerization and its effects on structural and psychosocial changes in working life. Researchers in Department of Business Administration, Psychology, Computer Science and Sociology joined my research group at the Department of Sociology, Stockholm University. Initially I developed two theoretical models with two levels of abstraction on the relation between information technology and changes in working life. They were tested empirically in three main companies, representing three main historical phases in computer technology; batch systems with mainframe computers, on line systems with visual display terminals, and systems with micro-computers. The companies included the Swedish post ofice, an insurance company and an electronic industry. Within the project on microcomputerization, two professional roles in a multinational electronic industry, were analyzed both historically and in relation to the use of computer support in the work process. The subproject “The Role of Engineers and the New Computer Technology” concerned the most common traditional male profession at the time and the engineers were using CAD systems (computer aided design). The subproject “The Role of Secretaries using Word Processing” deals with the most common traditional female profession at the time. While a visiting research professor at Stanford university in 1987, I designed a research plan for a project entitled “Knowledge based systems\n\n6\n\n(KBS, applied AI) and the Psychosocial and Organizational Impact”. At that time artiicial intelligence (AI) was discussed mainly in computer science and philosophy. I made a pilot study in an electronic company close to Stanford and with interviewed AI pioneer scholars at the Stanford and Berkley Universities. Then I formulated a set of hypotheses and carried out the empirical studies in Sweden in three frontline companies; an electronic production industry, an aircraft industry, and a commercial bank – with support of two Swedish research foundations.\n\nONGOING ReSeaRCh In my present role as professor emerita I am mainly serving in the following roles: Chair of one annual international conference; Member of scientiic advisory boards of international conferences (IFIP, HCII, IADIS, CIRN, ODAM) and international journals; Reviewer/Referee for full professorships; Key note speaker; Mentor.\n\nmentorship and “The Third Task of the Universities” My present research encompasses to a large extent mentorship for junior and senior scientists and contributions to disseminate research information outside the university (the so called “third task” of the Swedish universities). Examples are invitations to serve as key note speaker, presentations of my latest books for various audiences, contributions with chapters in books intended to be used as textbooks. Advocating at School of ICT, KTH and other universities and centres is still another task. The purpose is to bring the behavioural and the social sciences closer to the technical IT related disciplines. The intension is to change the imbalance in R&D between the “technological push” and a “people push” , with the basic purpose to contribute to technology\n\nCurriculum Vitae (CV) for Gunilla Bradley (GB)\n\napplications from a deeper understanding of the work place, the home and the society. The vision is to move from technology for all to quality of life for all - towards a society where people´s basic needs for belonging, inluence, meaningfulness are fulilled.\n\nThe home of the future: Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Changes in Society and human Behaviour Patterns in the Net era The overall purpose of the research project concerns ICT and changes in society and human behaviour patterns in the Net Era. The objective is to describe and analyse the ongoing social changes with focus on ‘working from home’ and ‘homing from work’ - emphasized by the increased use of ICT-related services and products. The home is considered both as a physical and a virtual space. To obtain an in-depth understanding of the change of peoples’ life roles in the Net Era, analyses of human and organizational behaviour related to the professional role, private role and citizen’s role are performed. A crossdisciplinary approach characterizes the research. International comparative analyses between environments in network organizations are used. Three types of ield studies were included, covering strategic organizations (homes) - one urban, one suburban and one rural in Sweden. International comparative studies with a cross disciplinary approach were done in US West and East Coast, Singapore & Malaysia, and Japan. The big challenge in the near future is “intelligent environments” and “intelligent living” in a broad sense. The process of change is both socially driven and technology driven. Driving technology forces are the converging and embedded technologies (ubiquitous and ambient technology). The following trends are enforcing the home as a communication sphere and the basis for a lot of activities and experiences which are connected\n\nto human needs: The home as the extended family centre; The home as a care centre; The home as a multimedia centre; The home as a centre for democratic dialogue; The home as a market place; The home as a learning centre. These trends are crucial for both many industries in the future e g paper and electronic industries, construction, telecom industries and organisation and new “intermediaries”. Analyses from this project are included in my current publications.\n\nQuality of life in Research at the School of ICT The aim of the project is to understand how “quality of life and well-being for all” is involved in basic research as well as in the more applied sciences. Interviews are made with most research leaders and professor colleagues at the School of ICT, approaching how they perceive that their research, directly or indirectly, in short term or in long term perspective, will contribute to a larger societal context and to values on various levels of analysis: quality of life, well-being, integrity, security, trust, health, deepening of democracy, personal growth, sustainability and other ethical considerations. Discussions are held on how the chain of reasoning could be described with regard to these concerns, also identifying various actors (driving forces) contributing to the “Good ICT Society”. Experiences from this project is valid for my mentoring and advisory role. The key words applied were: Quality of life, research policy, social construction, socioeconomic and environmental impact, technology innovation, sustainability.\n\nSyntheses A new period in the research process was composing a textbook for international use: Bradley (2006) ”Social and Community Informatics – Humans on the Net”, (Routledge). I am currently lecturing internationally and in Sweden, thereby contributing to “Social Informatics” and/or “Community\n\n7\n\nCurriculum Vitae (CV) for Gunilla Bradley (GB)\n\nInformatics” which are established as academic disciplines and/or cross disciplinary research centers/institutes at universities in several countries. World conferences in the ield are held e g IFIP (International Federation for Information Processing) - conference on”Social Informatics – An Information Society for All” HCC7 in 2006, Maribor (Slovenia) and annual conferences in ”Community Informatics” (CIRN) in Prato (Italy). The discipline Informatics has grown to focus the use of ICT in work life, private live and the role as citizen. This broad research ield has also become a main concern in many other disciplines and centres. In 2007 and 2008 I held doctoral courses in Social and Community Informatics, based on my latest book at Helsinki Technical University and Salzburg University, where she served as guest professor in 2008 at Paris Lodron University in Salzburg and the ICT & Society Center. Since 2008 I am the Chair of the annual IADIS conference on “ICT, Society and Human Beings”. The irst international conference was held in Amsterdam, and the second took place in Algarve in Portugal, in 2008. IADIS= International Association for Developing the Information Society. Next one will be held in Freiburg, Germany in 2010. Sustainable Development and ICT is the content of a special issue of the International Journal of Information, Communication Society (iCS) in 2010, where I serve as co-editor. Figure 2 is the theoretical model on the societal and social changes in the Network Society, further described in a chapter in this Festschrift on request from the Editors.\n\nPeDaGOGICal aCTIvITIeS aND exPeRIeNCeS: SeleCTeD lIST •\n\n8\n\nAdvisor for graduate students often with a crossdisciplinary orientation; computer\n\n•\n\n• •\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nscience, educational psychology, sociology, and psychology Advisor for doctoral students from Dept. of Informatics, Dept of Computer and System Sciences, Dept of Business Administration and Dept of Educational Psychology, for Universities abroad external advisor and external examiner.

In 1996-1997 I organized a crossdisciplinary ”IT-pedagogical” seminar series entitled ”Toward a Global Learning Space” within the Sweden-Silicon Valley Link program and with invited lecturers with deep and broad knowledge in the ield. The purpose was to create a meeting place for researchers and doctoral students from mainly three academic areas; organizational and social psychology, pedagogics and IT-related disciplines within KTH. The seminars discussed and identiied important research areas in the interface between IT research and the behavioral sciences. In 1998- 1999, I organized a seminar series in Informatics with invited international researchers open to all teachers and doctoral students. In 1998 -1999, I organized a doctoral course ”ICT and Worklife2000” for informatic students in the north of Sweden: Luleå Technical University, Umeå University, Mid-Sweden university.
