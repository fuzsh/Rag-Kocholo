        "text": "Thanks to Capgemini Invent I was able to take a sabbatical and fulfill my dream of volunteering in Tanzania 🙌 “How was your volunteering?” I always get asked. And I always answer it was an incredible experience. It was, but it also was rough and tough. I was assaulted, I experienced criminality and corruption, and saw more poverty than I ever had before. And yet, when I look back, I think of the smiles and tears of joy of the people I was able to help. I think of the group of widows who can now launch their business, the children who have a new classroom, and the amazing people I met who dedicate their lives to this. The man who assaulted me is now in jail. But if someone had invested in an education for him, provided him with some security or a better childhood, I like to think his life decisions would have been different. Small actions have huge impacts. I want to share some of my experiences: 🗓Today I was holding a beautiful 3 year old baby named Gratitude while I heard her mom’s story. A 15 year old girl who was raped by her stepfather and who then got kicked out of the house after telling her mother about it, since she was “ruining the marriage”. - she’s now at a rescue center hoping to be able to go back to school one day 🗓I gave another entrepreneurship talk for a group of widows and brainstormed ideas for their business. At the end, the big surprise, a 5,000-liter water tank we donated for them. I will never forget the gratitude I saw in their eyes while they hugged me 🗓…. I was in front, so the first man came at me while pulling out a machete. I knew in that second there was absolutely nothing I could do. With one hand he hit me in the face, with the other he held the knife 1cm away from my eyes… After taking everything from us, they didn’t even run away, we did 🗓Returning to the station for updates, the officers were cracking jokes, eating while we gave our statements, and even flirting with me. That feeling of not being taken seriously by authorities who should be there to protect you… 🗓Visiting a Maasai community we were greeted by 30 children waving. Due to the dry season none of them had had any water or food that day. The nearest school was a 14km walk away and the water source a 7km walk away. Still, they all greeted us with a big smile 🗓At a secondary school we talked about sexual education - usually tabu topics for the Maasai. Since they were ashamed, they passed the questions in small papers so they wouldn’t have to ask them out loud. There were giggles all the time, but I had never seen such concentrated students 🗓You drive past the city and the outskirts, and in the middle of nowhere you see a big tree standing there with 80 kids jumping around once they saw our car approaching. That’s the school. The shade under the big tree The more we support social projects, the closer we get at breaking the cycle of poverty, criminality, and hunger. I know I would do it all over again #socialimpact #volunteering"
