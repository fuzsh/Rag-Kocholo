At the same time, left heart diseases represent the most common cause of pulmonary hypertension, and the occurrence of PH in patients with chronic heart failure is usually associated with worse functional class, and prognosis. Right heart catheterization (RHC) is the \"gold standard\" in the diagnosis and differentiation of PH. It is also essential in the process of qualifying for a heart transplantation. Therefore, right heart catheterization should be performed in expert centers by experienced operators and according to a strict protocol to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of results. Recommendations for pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease are based on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines designed in cooperation with the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHL). The new ESC guidelines for pulmonary hypertension published in 2015 have improved the diagnostic and therapeutic process in patients with left heart diseases.\n\nLeft heart catheterization\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nCatheterization - left heart ... to help guide the catheters up into your heart and arteries.

Generally, anticoagulants are held prior to the procedure. At our center, anticoagulants are continued and ultrasound guidance is always used for internal jugular vein access. A micropuncture access kit is used to place a 5 or 6 Fr sheath using the modified Seldinger technique. Manual compression is applied for 10-15 min and the patient is observed for at least 2 hours after the procedure. In a retrospective analysis, we investigated the risk of bleeding complications associated with RHC via the internal jugular vein in patients with and without full anticoagulation. Our catheterization laboratory database was searched for adult patients who underwent RHC by a single operator between January 2012 and December 2015. A total of 571 patients were included in the analysis. Baseline characteristics, labs, relevant invasive hemodynamics, co-morbid conditions, and incidence of access-site hematoma are presented. Multivariable binary logistic regression was performed using IBM SPSS v. 23.0 software. Statistically significant associations with access-site hematoma were observed with body mass index (P=.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.1), right atrial pressure (P=.03; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9), and dialysis dependence (P<.01; 95% CI, 0.1-0.6). There was no association of access-site hematoma with the use of anticoagulants (P>.99). The incidence of internal jugular vein access-site hematoma is small when using careful access techniques for RHC even with the continued use of novel oral anticoagulants and warfarin. Patient characteristics and co-morbid conditions are related to bleeding complications.\n\nEvaluation of the hemodynamics and right ventricular function in pulmonary hypertension by echocardiography compared with right-sided heart catheterization\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Yidan; Wang, Yidan; Li, Hong; Zhu, Weiwei; Meng, Xiangli; Lu, Xiuzhang\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe present study aimed to evaluate hemodynamics and right ventricular function in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) using transthoracic echocardiography and to compare these results with measurements obtained using right-sided heart catheterization (RHC). A total of 75 patients with PH were examined using echocardiography and RHC. Patients were divided into the following two groups according to their difference between SPAPecho and SPAPRHC measurement: The overestimated group and underestimated group. The overestimated group included the subgroups groupover-A (difference <20 mmHg) and groupover-B (difference â¥20 mmHg), and the underestimated group included groupunder-A (absolute value of the difference <20 mmHg) and groupunder-B (absolute value of the difference â¥20 mmHg). SPAPecho measurements were revealed to be significantly positively correlated with SPAPRHC measurements (r=0.794; P<0.01). Among all echocardiographic measurements, only tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) was significantly different between groups; it was increased in groupover-A and groupunder-A compared with groupover-B (P<0.01). Although SPAP measurements obtained using echocardiography were significantly positively correlated with those obtained using RHC, a high proportion of overestimation or underestimation of SPAP by echocardiography remained.

While PAH is defined hemodynamically by right heart catheterization (RHC), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is recommended by guidelines to assess disease status. Retrospectively collected data in 138 group 1 PAH patients were examined for the correlation of BNP levels to simultaneously obtained right heart catheterization (RHC). Patients were mostly Caucasian women, with functional class III symptoms, mean BNP of 406 ± 443 pg/mL, and an average right atrial pressure (RAP) of 9.9 ± 5.7 mm Hg and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 47.3 ± 14.7 mm Hg. Significant correlation was demonstrated between BNP and RAP ( p = 0.021) and mPAP ( p = 0.003). Additional correlation was seen with right heart size on echocardiography: right atrial (RAE; p = 0.04) and right ventricular enlargement ( p = 0.03). An increased BNP level was an independent predictor of mortality ( p < 0.0001), along with RAP ( p = 0.039) and RAE ( p = 0.018). Simultaneous collection of BNP at the time of RHC confirmed the correlation of BNP with right heart hemodynamics. The current results reinforce the use of BNP level as a continuous variable to assess disease severity in group 1 PAH.\n\nCardiac catheterization - discharge\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nCatheterization - cardiac - discharge; Heart catheterization - discharge: Catheterization - cardiac; Heart catheterization; Angina - cardiac catheterization discharge; CAD - cardiac catheterization discharge; Coronary artery disease - cardiac catheterization ...\n\nHistory of Right Heart Catheterization: 100 Years of Experimentation and Methodology Development\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNossaman, Bobby D.; Scruggs, Brittni A.; Nossaman, Vaughn E.; Murthy, Subramanyam N.; Kadowitz, Philip J.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe development of right heart catheterization has provided the clinician the ability to diagnose patients with congenital and acquired right heart disease, and to monitor patients in the ICU with significant cardiovascular illnesses. The development of bedside pulmonary artery catheterization has become a standard of care for the critically ill patient since its introduction into the ICU almost 40 years ago. However, adoption of this procedure into the mainstream of clinical practice occurred without prior evaluation or demonstration of its clinical or cost-effectiveness. Moreover, current randomized, controlled trials provide little evidence in support of the clinical utility of pulmonary artery catheterization in the management of critically ill patients. Nevertheless, the right heart catheter is an important diagnostic tool to assist the clinician in the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and acquired right heart disease, and moreover, when catheter placement is proximal to the right auricle (atria), this catheter provides an important and safe route for administration of fluids, medications, and parenteral nutrition. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the development of right heart catheterization that led to the ability to conduct physiologic studies in cardiovascular dynamics in normal individuals and in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and to review current controversies of the extension of the right heart catheter, the pulmonary artery catheter.

Comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic assessment of right heart function was performed in 105 subjects (64 stable HTx patients and 41 healthy controls). RHC was performed at rest and during semi-supine maximal exercise test. Compared with controls, in conclusion, HTx patients had impaired right ventricle (RV) systolic function in terms of decreased RV-free wall (FW) global longitudinal strain (GLS) (-20 Â± 5% vs. -28 Â± 5%, P < 0.0001) and 3D-ejection fraction (EF) (50 Â± 8% vs. 60 Â± 6%, P < 0.0001). In HTx patients, echocardiographic RV systolic function was significantly correlated with NYHA-class (3D-RVEF: r = -0.62, P < 0.0001; RV-FW-GLS: r = -0.41, P = 0.0009) and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (3D-RVEF: r = -0.42, P = 0.0005; RV-FW-GLS: r = -0.25, P = 0.0444). RHC demonstrated a good correlation between invasively assessed resting RV-stroke volume index and exercise capacity (r = 0.58, P < 0.0001) and NYHA-class (r = -0.41, P = 0.0009). RV systolic function is reduced in HTx patients compared with controls. 3D RVEF and 2D longitudinal deformation analyses are associated with clinical performance in stable HTx patients and seem suitable in noninvasive routine right heart function evaluation after HTx. Invasively assessed RV systolic reserve was strongly associated with exercise capacity.

We investigated the impact of cardiac CT on the utilization of cardiac catheterization among children with congenital heart disease. The study sample consisted of 2648 cardiac CT and 3814 cardiac catheterization from 1999 to 2009 for congenital heart diseases. Diagnoses were categorized into 11 disease groups. The numbers of examination, according to the different modalities, were compared using temporal trend analyses. The estimated effective radiation doses (mSv) of CT and catheterization were calculated and compared. The number of CT scans and interventional catheterizations had a slight annual increase of 1.2% and 2.7%, respectively, whereas that of diagnostic catheterization decreased by 6.2% per year. Disease groups fell into two categories according to utilization trend differences between CT and diagnostic catheterization. The increased use of CT reduces the need for diagnostic catheterization in patients with atrioventricular connection disorder, coronary arterial disorder, great vessel disorder, septal disorder, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventriculoarterial connection disorder. Clinicians choose either catheterization or CT, or both examinations, depending on clinical conditions, in patients with semilunar valvular disorder, heterotaxy, myocardial disorder, pericardial disorder, and pulmonary vein disorder. The radiation dose of CT was lower than that of diagnostic cardiac catheterization in all age groups. The use of noninvasive CT in children with selected heart conditions might reduce the use of diagnostic cardiac catheterization. This may release time and facilities within the catheterization laboratory to meet the increasing demand for cardiac interventions. Copyright Â© 2014.

We identified IPF patients who performed a 6MWT as part of their clinical evaluation between 2006 and 2009 and were followed to lung transplantation or death. Right heart catheterization (RHC) data were collated and analysed for the subgroup who had this procedure. There were 160 subjects who qualified for the survival analysis, and those with an abnormal HRR1 had worse survival than subjects with normal HRR1 (log-rank P = 0.01). Eighty-two subjects had a right heart catheter (RHC); among them, abnormal HRR1 was associated with RHC-confirmed PH (Ï(2) = 4.83, P = 0.03) and had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 52%, 74%, 41% and 82%, respectively, for PH. In bivariate and multivariable analyses, abnormal HRR1 appeared to be the strongest predictor of RHC-confirmed PH (odds ratio (OR) = 4.0, 95% CI: 1.17-13.69, P = 0.02 in the multivariable analysis). This study adds to data that support the validity of abnormal HRR1 as a predictor of mortality and of RHC-confirmed PH in IPF. Research is needed to further investigate the link between abnormal HRR1 and PH and to elucidate heart-lung interactions at work during exercise and recovery in patients with IPF.

Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) defines RHF as elevated right atrial pressure (RAP) plus venous congestion. The purpose of this study was to examine the diagnostic performance of the noninvasive INTERMACS criteria using RAP as the gold standard. We analyzed 108 patients with LVAD who underwent 341 right heart catheterizations (RHC) between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2013. Physical exam, echocardiography, and laboratory data at the time of RHC were collected. Conventional two-by-two tables were used and missing data were excluded. The noninvasive INTERMACS definition of RHF is 32% sensitive (95% CI, 0.21-0.44) and 97% specific (95% CI, 0.95-0.99) for identifying elevated RAP. Clinical assessment failed to identify two-thirds of LVAD patients with RAP > 16 mm Hg. More than half of patients with elevated RAP did not have venous congestion, which may represent a physiologic opportunity to mitigate the progression of disease before end-organ damage occurs. One-quarter of patients who met the noninvasive definition of RHF did not actually have elevated RAP, potentially exposing patients to unnecessary therapies. In practice, if any component of the INTERMACS definition is present or equivocal, our data suggest RHC is warranted to establish the diagnosis.\n\nAnesthesia and the pediatric cardiac catheterization suite: a review.\n\nPubMed\n\nLam, Jennifer E; Lin, Erica P; Alexy, Ryan; Aronson, Lori A\n\n2015-02-01\n\nAdvances in technology over the last couple of decades have caused a shift in pediatric cardiac catheterization from a primary focus on diagnostics to innovative therapeutic interventions. These improvements allow patients a wider range of nonsurgical options for treatment of congenital heart disease. However, these therapeutic modalities can entail higher risk in an already complex patient population, compounded by the added challenges inherent to the environment of the cardiac catheterization suite. Anesthesiologists caring for children with congenital heart disease must understand not only the pathophysiology of the disease but also the effects the anesthetics and interventions have on the patient in order to provide a safe perioperative course. It is the aim of this article to review the latest catheterization modalities offered to patients with congenital heart disease, describe the unique challenges presented in the cardiac catheterization suite, list the most common complications encountered during catheterization and finally, to review the literature regarding different anesthetic drugs used in the catheterization lab.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the most widely used tool when screening for PH, although discordance between TTE and right heart catheter (RHC) measured pulmonary haemodynamics is increasingly recognized. We evaluated the predictive utility of the updated European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) TTE screening recommendations against RHC testing in a large, well-characterized ILD cohort. Two hundred and sixty-five consecutive patients with ILD and suspected PH underwent comprehensive assessment, including RHC, between 2006 and 2012. ESC/ERS recommended tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity thresholds for assigning high (>3.4âm/s), intermediate (2.9-3.4âm/s) and low (<2.8âm/s) probabilities of PH were evaluated against RHC testing. RHC testing confirmed PH in 86% of subjects with a peak TR velocity >3.4âm/s, and excluded PH in 60% of ILD subjects with a TR velocity <2.8âm/s. Thus, the ESC/ERS guidelines misclassified 40% of subjects as 'low probability' of PH, when PH was confirmed on subsequent RHC. Evaluating alternative TR velocity thresholds for assigning a low probability of PH did not significantly improve the ability of TR velocity to exclude a diagnosis of PH. In patients with ILD and suspected PH, currently recommended ESC/ERS TR velocity screening thresholds were associated with a high positive predictive value (86%) for confirming PH, but were of limited value in excluding PH, with 40% of patients misclassified as low probability when PH was confirmed at subsequent RHC.

However, patterns of hospital use and trends in patient outcomes are not known. In the National Inpatient Sample 2001 to 2012, using International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision codes, we identified 11â888â525 adult (â¥18 years) HF hospitalizations nationally, of which an estimated 75â209 (SE 0.6%) received a PA catheter. In 2001, the number of hospitals with â¥1 PA catheterization was 1753, decreasing to 1183 in 2011. The mean PA catheter use per hospital trended from 4.9 per year in 2001 (limits 1-133) to 3.8 per year in 2007 (limits 1-46), but increased to 5.5 per year in 2011 (limits 1-70). During 2001 to 2006, PA catheterization declined across hospitals; however, in 2007 to 2012, there was a disproportionate increase at hospitals with large bedsize, teaching programs, and advanced HF capabilities. The overall in-hospital mortality with PA catheter use was higher than without PA catheter use (13.1% versus 3.4%; P<0.0001); however, in propensity-matched analysis, differences in mortality between these groups have attenuated over time-risk-adjusted odds ratio for mortality for PA catheterization, 1.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.60-1.74) in 2001 to 2003 down to 1.04 (95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.12) in 2010 to 2012. There is substantial hospital-level variability in PA catheterization in HF along with increasing volume at fewer hospitals over-represented by large, academic hospitals with advanced HF capabilities. This is accompanied by a decline in excess mortality associated with PA catheterization.

However, with the growing number of patients who undergo cardiac catheterization, it has become imperative that the cardiology community overcomes these challenges to study patient outcomes. The Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcomes was able to develop benchmarks, tools for measurement, and risk adjustment methods while exploring procedural efficacy. Based on the success of these efforts, the collaborative is pursuing a follow-up project, the Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcomes-Quality Improvement, aimed at improving the outcomes for all patients undergoing catheterization for congenital heart disease by reducing radiation exposure.\n\nPulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease: diagnostic and prognostic value of CT in chronic systolic heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nColin, Geoffrey C; Gerber, Bernhard L; de Meester de Ravenstein, Christophe; Byl, David; Dietz, Anna; Kamga, Michele; Pasquet, Agnes; Vancraeynest, David; Vanoverschelde, Jean-Louis; D'Hondt, Anne-Marie; Ghaye, Benoit; Pouleur, Anne-Catherine\n\n2018-05-14\n\nTo evaluate the ability of chest computed tomography (CT) to predict pulmonary hypertension (PH) and outcome in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). We reviewed 119 consecutive patients with HFrEF by CT, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and right heart catheterization (RHC). CT-derived pulmonary artery (PA) diameter and PA to ascending aorta diameter ratio (PA:A ratio), left atrial, right atrial, right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular volumes were correlated with RHC mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) . Diagnostic accuracy to predict PH and ability to predict primary composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and HF events were evaluated. RV volume was significantly higher in 81 patients with PH compared to 38 patients without PH (133 ml/m 2 vs. 79 ml/m 2 , p < 0.001) and was moderately correlated with mPAP (r=0.55, p < 0.001). Also, RV volume had higher ability to predict PH (area under the curve: 0.88) than PA diameter (0.79), PA:A ratio (0.76) by CT and tricuspid regurgitation gradient (0.83) and RV basal diameter by TTE (0.84, all p < 0.001). During the follow-up period (median: 3.4 years), 51 patients (43%) had HF events or died. After correction for important clinical, TTE and RHC parameters, RV volume (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.71, 95% CI 1.31-2.23, p < 0.001) and PA diameter (HR: 1.61, 95% CI 1.18-2.22, p = 0.003) were independent predictors of the primary endpoint. In patients with HFrEF, measurement of RV volume and PA diameter on ungated CT are non-invasive markers of PH and may help to predict the patient outcome. â¢ Right ventricular (RV) volume measured by chest CT has good ability to identify pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). â¢ The accuracy of pulmonary artery (PA) diameter and PA to ascending aorta diameter ratio (PA:A ratio) to predict PH was similar to previous studies, however, with lower cut-offs (28.1 mm and 0\n\nBaseline Hemodynamics and Response to Contrast Media During Diagnostic Cardiac Catheterization Predict Adverse Events in Heart Failure Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nDenardo, Scott J; Vock, David M; Schmalfuss, Carsten M; Young, Gregory D; Tcheng, James E; O'Connor, Christopher M\n\n2016-07-01\n\nContrast media administered during cardiac catheterization can affect hemodynamic variables. However, little is documented about the effects of contrast on hemodynamics in heart failure patients or the prognostic value of baseline and changes in hemodynamics for predicting subsequent adverse events. In this prospective study of 150 heart failure patients, we measured hemodynamics at baseline and after administration of iodixanol or iopamidol contrast. One-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of adverse event-free survival (death, heart failure hospitalization, and rehospitalization) were generated, grouping patients by baseline measures of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and cardiac index (CI), and by changes in those measures after contrast administration. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to assess sequentially adding baseline PCWP and change in CI to 5 validated risk models (Seattle Heart Failure Score, ESCAPE [Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness], CHARM [Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity], CORONA [Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure], and MAGGIC [Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure]). Median contrast volume was 109 mL. Both contrast media caused similarly small but statistically significant changes in most hemodynamic variables. There were 39 adverse events (26.0%). Adverse event rates increased using the composite metric of baseline PCWP and change in CI (P<0.01); elevated baseline PCWP and decreased CI after contrast correlated with the poorest prognosis. Adding both baseline PCWP and change in CI to the 5 risk models universally improved their predictive value (Pâ¤0.02). In heart failure patients, the administration of contrast causes small but significant changes in hemodynamics. Calculating baseline PCWP with change in CI after contrast predicts adverse events and increases the predictive value of\n\nCT derived left atrial size identifies left heart disease in suspected pulmonary hypertension: Derivation and validation of predictive thresholds.\n\nPubMed\n\nCurrie, Benjamin J; Johns, Chris; Chin, Matthew; Charalampopolous, Thanos; Elliot, Charlie A; Garg, Pankaj; Rajaram, Smitha; Hill, Catherine; Wild, Jim W; Condliffe, Robin A; Kiely, David G; Swift, Andy J\n\n2018-06-01\n\nPatients with pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (PH-LHD) have overlapping clinical features with pulmonary arterial hypertension making diagnosis reliant on right heart catheterization (RHC). This study aimed to investigate computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) derived cardiopulmonary structural metrics, in comparison to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of left heart disease in patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension. Patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension who underwent CTPA, MRI and RHC were identified. Measurements of the cardiac chambers and vessels were recorded from CTPA and MRI. The diagnostic thresholds of individual measurements to detect elevated pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) were identified in a derivation cohort (nâ¯=â¯235). Individual CT and MRI derived metrics were tested in validation cohort (nâ¯=â¯211). 446 patients, of which 88 had left heart disease. Left atrial area was a strong predictor of elevated PAWP>15â¯mmâ¯Hg and PAWP>18â¯mmâ¯Hg, area under curve (AUC) 0.854, and AUC 0.873 respectively. Similar accuracy was also identified for MRI derived LA volume, AUC 0.852 and AUC 0.878 for PAWPâ¯>â¯15 and 18â¯mmâ¯Hg, respectively. Left atrial area of 26.8â¯cm 2 and 30.0â¯cm 2 were optimal specific thresholds for identification of PAWPâ¯>â¯15 and 18â¯mmâ¯Hg, had sensitivity of 60%/53% and specificity 89%/94%, respectively in a validation cohort. CTPA and MRI derived left atrial size identifies left heart disease in suspected pulmonary hypertension with high specificity.

The potential immunological and physiological implications associated with this technique have, however, not been investigated in detail. The present study compared plasma levels of the cytokines IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, GM-CSF, IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± in male NMRI mice that had been subjected to carotid artery catheterization and subsequent automated blood sampling with age-matched control mice. Body weight and histopathological changes in the surgical area, including the salivary glands, the heart, brain, spleen, liver, kidneys and lungs were compared. Catheterized mice had higher levels of IL-6 than did control mice, but other cytokine levels did not differ between the groups. No significant difference in body weight was found. The histology revealed inflammatory and regenerative (healing) changes at surgical sites of all catheterized mice, with mild inflammatory changes extending into the salivary glands. Several catheterized mice had multifocal degenerative to necrotic changes with inflammation in the heart, kidneys and livers, suggesting that thrombi had detached from the catheter tip and embolized to distant sites. Thus, catheterization and subsequent automated blood sampling may have physiological impact. Possible confounding effects of visceral damage should be assessed and considered, when using catheterized mouse models.\n\nRelation of Coronary Flow Reserve to Other Findings on Positron Emission Tomography Myocardial Perfusion Imaging and Left Heart Catheterization in Patients With End-stage Renal Disease Being Evaluated for Kidney Transplant.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaz, Yehuda; Morgenstern, Rachelle; Weinberg, Richard; Chiles, Mariana; Bhatti, Navdeep; Ali, Ziad; Mohan, Sumit; Bokhari, Sabahat\n\n2017-12-01\n\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and often goes undetected. Abnormal coronary flow reserve (CFR), which predicts increased risk of cardiac death, may be present in patients with ESRD without other evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD). We prospectively studied 131 patients who had rest and dipyridamole pharmacologic stress N 13 -ammonia positron emission tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (PET MPI) for kidney transplant evaluation. Thirty-four patients also had left heart catheterization. Abnormal PET MPI was defined as qualitative ischemia or infarct, stress electrocardiogram ischemia, or transient ischemic dilation. CFR was calculated as the ratio of stress to rest coronary blood flow. Global CFRâ<â2 was defined as abnormal. Of 131 patients who had PET MPI (66% male, 55.6âÂ±â12.1 years), 30% (39 of 131) had abnormal PET MPI and 59% (77 of 131) had abnormal CFR. In a subset of 34 patients who had left heart catheterization (66% male, 61.0âÂ±â12.1 years), 68% (23 of 34) had abnormal CFR on PET MPI, and 68% (23 of 34) had â¥70% obstruction on left heart catheterization. Abnormal CFR was not significantly associated with abnormal PET MPI (pâ=â0.13) or obstructive CAD on left heart catheterization (pâ=â0.26). In conclusion, in the first prospective study of PET MPI in patients with ESRD, abnormal CFR is highly prevalent and is independent of abnormal findings on PET MPI or obstructive CAD on left heart catheterization.

To date, commercial metallic guidewires were considered contraindicated during CMR fluoroscopy due to concerns over radiofrequency (RF)-induced heating. The inability to use metallic guidewires hampers catheter navigation in patients with challenging anatomy. Here we use low specific absorption rate (SAR) imaging from gradient echo spiral acquisitions and a commercial nitinol guidewire for CMR fluoroscopy right heart catheterization in patients. The low-SAR imaging protocol used a reduced flip angle gradient echo acquisition (10Â° vs 45Â°) and a longer repetition time (TR) spiral readout (10Â ms vs 2.98Â ms). Temperature was measured in vitro in the ASTM 2182 gel phantom and post-mortem animal experiments to ensure freedom from heating with the selected guidewire (150Â cmâÃâ0.035â³ angled-tip nitinol Terumo Glidewire). SevenÂ patients underwent CMR fluoroscopy catheterization. Time to enter each chamber (superior vena cava, main pulmonary artery, and each branch pulmonary artery) was recorded and device visibility and confidence in catheter and guidewire position were scored on a Likert-type scale. Negligible heating (<â0.07Â°C) was observed under all in vitro conditions using this guidewire and imaging approach. In patients, chamber entry was successful in 100% of attempts with a guidewire compared to 94% without a guidewire, with failures to reach the branch pulmonary arteries. Time-to-enter each chamber was similar (p=NS) forÂ the two approaches. The guidewire imparted useful catheter shaft conspicuity and enabled interactive modification of catheter shaft stiffness, however, the guidewire tip visibility was poor. Under specific conditions, trained operators can apply low-SAR imaging and using a specific fully-insulated metallic nitinol guidewire (150Â cmâÃâ0.035\" Terumo\n\nCognitive Function Before and After Left Heart Catheterization.\n\nPubMed\n\nScott, David A; Evered, Lisbeth; Maruff, Paul; MacIsaac, Andrew; Maher, Sarah; Silbert, Brendan S\n\n2018-03-10\n\nHospital procedures have been associated with cognitive change in older patients. This study aimed to document the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in individuals undergoing left heart catheterization (LHC) before the procedure and the incidence of cognitive decline to 3Â months afterwards. We conducted a prospective, observational, clinical investigation of elderly participants undergoing elective LHC. Cognition was assessed using a battery of written tests and a computerized cognitive battery before the LHC and then at 3Â months afterwards. The computerized tests were also administered at 24Â hours (or discharge) and 7Â days after LHC. A control group of 51 community participants was recruited to calculate cognitive decline using the Reliable Change Index. Of 437 participants, mild cognitive impairment was identified in 226 (51.7%) before the procedure. Computerized tests detected an incidence of cognitive decline of 10.0% at 24Â hours and 7.5% at 7Â days. At 3Â months, written tests detected an incidence of cognitive decline of 13.1% and computerized tests detected an incidence of 8.5%. Cognitive decline at 3Â months using written tests was associated with increasing age, whereas computerized tests showed cognitive decline was associated with baseline amnestic mild cognitive impairment, diabetes mellitus, and prior coronary stenting. More than half the patients aged >60Â years presenting for LHC have mild cognitive impairment. LHC is followed by cognitive decline in 8% to 13% of individuals at 3Â months after the procedure. Subtle cognitive decline both before and after LHC is common and may have important clinical implications. URL: www.anzctr.org.au. Unique identifier: ACTRN12607000051448. Â© 2018 The Authors.

Vincent S.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND As the survival of children with cardiac disease increases, chronic complications of deep venous thrombosis from cardiac catheterization, particularly post-thrombotic syndrome, may be important to monitor for and treat, if needed. We aimed to determine the prevalence of this syndrome in children who underwent cardiac catheterization. PROCEDURE We conducted a cross-sectional study of children <18 years old at least 1 year from first catheterization through the femoral vein. We used the Manco-Johnson instrument, the only tool validated in children, to diagnose post-thrombotic syndrome. We defined the syndrome as a score â¥1. It was considered physically and functionally significant if the score was â¥1 in both physical and functional domains of the instrument. We also conducted ultrasonography to assess for thrombosis and valvular insufficiency. RESULTS We enrolled 62 children with a median age of 4 months during catheterization and a median of 5.4 years since catheterization. A total of 40 children had post-thrombotic syndrome (prevalence: 64.5%; 95% confidence interval: 51.3%â76.3%), the majority of which were mild. Presence of cyanotic congenital heart disease, total number of catheterizations, use of antithrombotic agents at any time after the first catheterization, age at first catheterization, or time since first catheterization was not associated with the syndrome. A total of 7 children (prevalence: 11.3%; 95% confidence interval: 3.2%â19.4%) had physically and functionally significant syndrome. None of the children had abnormalities on ultrasonography at the time of enrollment. CONCLUSIONS Post-thrombotic syndrome is a common complication after cardiac catheterization. Manifestations are usually mild and unlikely to require treatment.

Unfortunately, based on evidence, it has been demonstrated that the majority of children with CHD are at an increased risk of \"non-cardiac\" problems. Effective exercise therapy could improve their functional status significantly. As studies identifying the efficacy of exercise therapy are rare in this field, the aims of this study are to (1) identify the efficacy of a home-based exercise program to improve the motor function of children with CHD with cardiac catheterization, (2) reduce parental anxiety and parenting burden, and (3) improve the quality of life for parents whose children are diagnosed with CHD with cardiac catheterization through the program. A total of 300 children who will perform a cardiac catheterization will be randomly assigned to two groups: a home-based intervention group and a control group. The home-based intervention group will carry out a home-based exercise program, and the control group will receive only home-based exercise education. Assessments will be undertaken before catheterization and at 1, 3, and 6Â months after catheterization. Motor ability quotients will be assessed as the primary outcomes. The modified Ross score, cardiac function, speed of sound at the tibia, functional independence of the children, anxiety, quality of life, and caregiver burden of their parents or the main caregivers will be the secondary outcome measurements. The proposed prospective randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficiency of a home-based exercise program for children with CHD with cardiac catheterization. We anticipate that the home-based exercise program may represent a valuable and efficient intervention for children with CHD and their families. http\n\nRecent advances in cardiac catheterization for congenital heart disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKang, Sok-Leng; Benson, Lee\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe field of pediatric and adult congenital cardiac catheterization has evolved rapidly in recent years. This review will focus on some of the newer endovascular technological and management strategies now being applied in the pediatric interventional laboratory. Emerging imaging techniques such as three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography, multi-modal image fusion, 3D printing, and holographic imaging have the potential to enhance our understanding of complex congenital heart lesions for diagnostic or interventional purposes. While fluoroscopy and standard angiography remain procedural cornerstones, improved equipment design has allowed for effective radiation exposure reduction strategies. Innovations in device design and implantation techniques have enabled the application of percutaneous therapies in a wider range of patients, especially those with prohibitive surgical risk. For example, there is growing experience in transcatheter duct occlusion in symptomatic low-weight or premature infants and stent implantation into the right ventricular outflow tract or arterial duct in cyanotic neonates with duct-dependent pulmonary circulations. The application of percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation has been extended to a broader patient population with dysfunctional ânativeâ right ventricular outflow tracts and has spurred the development of novel techniques and devices to solve associated anatomic challenges. Finally, hybrid strategies, combining cardiosurgical and interventional approaches, have enhanced our capabilities to provide care for those with the most complex of lesions while optimizing efficacy and safety.

We recruited 1206 patients with HFpEF undergoing cardiac catheterization with periprocedural hydration volume/weight (HV/W) ratio data and investigated the relationship between hydration volumes and risk of CI-AKI and WHF. Incidence of CI-AKI was not significantly reduced in individuals with higher HV/W [quartile (Q) 1, Q2, Q3, and Q4: 9.7%, 10.2%, 12.7%, and 12.2%, respectively; P = 0.219]. Multivariate analysis indicated that higher HV/W ratios were not associated with decreased CI-AKI risks [Q2 vs. Q1: odds ratio (OR), 0.95; Q3 vs. Q1: OR, 1.07; Q4 vs. Q1: OR, 0.92; all P > 0.05]. According to multivariate analysis, higher HV/W significantly increased the WHF risk (Q4 vs. Q1: adjusted OR, 8.13 and 95% confidence interval, 1.03-64.02; P = 0.047). CI-AKI and WHF were associated with a significantly increased risk of long-term mortality (mean follow-up, 2.33 years). For HFpEF patients, an excessively high hydration volume might not be associated with lower risk of CI-AKI but may increase the risk of postprocedure WHF.\n\nDoppler-guided retrograde catheterization system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrazin, Leon J.; Vonesh, Michael J.; Chandran, Krishnan B.; Khasho, Fouad; Lanza, George M.; Talano, James V.; McPherson, David D.\n\n1991-05-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate a Doppler guided catheterization system as an adjunctive or alternative methodology to overcome the disadvantages of left heart catheterization and angiography. These disadvantages include the biological effects of radiation and the toxic and volume effects of iodine contrast. Doppler retrograde guidance uses a 20 MHz circular pulsed Doppler crystal incorporated into the tip of a triple lumen multipurpose catheter and is advanced retrogradely using the directional flow information provided by the Doppler waveform. The velocity detection limits are either 1 m/second or 4 m/second depending upon the instrumentation. In a physiologic flow model of the human aortic arch, multiple data points revealed a positive wave form when flow was traveling toward the catheter tip indicating proper alignment for retrograde advancement. There was a negative wave form when flow was traveling away from the catheter tip if the catheter was in a branch or bent upon itself indicating improper catheter tip position for retrograde advancement. In a series of six dogs, the catheter was able to be accurately advanced from the femoral artery to the left ventricular chamber under Doppler signal guidance without the use of x-ray. The potential applications of a Doppler guided retrograde catheterization system include decreasing time requirements and allowing safer catheter guidance in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease and suspected aortic dissection. The Doppler system may allow left ventricular pressure monitoring in the intensive care unit without the need for x-ray and it may allow left sided contrast echocardiography. With pulse velocity detection limits of 4 m/second, this system may allow catheter direction and passage into the aortic root and left ventricle in patients with aortic stenosis. A modification of the Doppler catheter may include transponder technology which would allow precise catheter tip localization once the\n\nDiagnosis of pulmonary hypertension from magnetic resonance imaging-based computational models and decision tree analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLungu, Angela; Swift, Andrew J; Capener, David; Kiely, David; Hose, Rod; Wild, Jim M\n\n2016-06-01\n\nAccurately identifying patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) using noninvasive methods is challenging, and right heart catheterization (RHC) is the gold standard. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed as an alternative to echocardiography and RHC in the assessment of cardiac function and pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with suspected PH. The aim of this study was to assess whether machine learning using computational modeling techniques and image-based metrics of PH can improve the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in PH. Seventy-two patients with suspected PH attending a referral center underwent RHC and MRI within 48 hours. Fifty-seven patients were diagnosed with PH, and 15 had no PH. A number of functional and structural cardiac and cardiovascular markers derived from 2 mathematical models and also solely from MRI of the main pulmonary artery and heart were integrated into a classification algorithm to investigate the diagnostic utility of the combination of the individual markers. A physiological marker based on the quantification of wave reflection in the pulmonary artery was shown to perform best individually, but optimal diagnostic performance was found by the combination of several image-based markers. Classifier results, validated using leave-one-out cross validation, demonstrated that combining computation-derived metrics reflecting hemodynamic changes in the pulmonary vasculature with measurement of right ventricular morphology and function, in a decision support algorithm, provides a method to noninvasively diagnose PH with high accuracy (92%). The high diagnostic accuracy of these MRI-based model parameters may reduce the need for RHC in patients with suspected PH.\n\nUtility and Clinical Profile of Dexmedetomidine in Pediatric Cardiac Catheterization Procedures: A Matched Controlled Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRiveros, Ricardo; Makarova, Natalya; Riveros-Perez, Efrain; Chodavarapu, Praneeta; Saasouh, Wael; YÄ±lmaz, HÃ¼seyin OÄuz; Cuko, Evis; Babazade, Rovnat; Kimatian, Stephen; Turan, Alparslan\n\n2017-12-01\n\nDexmedetomidine is increasingly used in children undergoing cardiac catheterization procedures. We compared the percentage of surgical time with hemodynamic instability and the incidence of postoperative agitation between pediatric cardiac catheterization patients who received dexmedetomidine infusion and those who did not and the incidence of postoperative agitation. We matched 653 pediatric patients scheduled for cardiac catheterization. Two separate multivariable linear mixed models were used to assess the association between dexmedetomidine use and intraoperative blood pressure and heart rate instability. A multivariate logistic regression was used for relationship between dexmedetomidine and postoperative agitation. No difference between the study groups was found in the duration of MAP ( P = .867) or heart rate (HR) instabilities ( P = .224). The relationship between dexmedetomidine use and the duration of negative hemodynamic effects does not depend on any of the considered CHD types (all P > .001) or intervention ( P = .453 for MAP and P = .023 for HR). No difference in postoperative agitation was found between the study groups ( P = .590). Our study demonstrated no benefit in using dexmedetomidine infusion compared with other general anesthesia techniques to maintain hemodynamic stability or decrease agitation in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization procedures.\n\nAccuracy of Doppler echocardiographic estimates of pulmonary artery pressures in a canine model of pulmonary hypertension\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSoydan, Lydia C.; Kellihan, Heidi B.; Bates, Melissa L.; Stepien, Rebecca L.; Consigny, Daniel W.; Bellofiore, Alessandro; Francois, Christopher J.; Chesler, Naomi C.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives To compare noninvasive estimates of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) obtained via echocardiography (ECHO) to invasive measurements of PAP obtained during right heart catheterization (RHC) across a wide range of PAP, to examine the accuracy of estimating right atrial pressure via ECHO (RAPECHO) compared to RAP measured by catheterization (RAPRHC), and to determine if adding RAPECHO improves the accuracy of noninvasive PAP estimations. Animals Fourteen healthy female beagle dogs. Methods ECHO and RHC performed at various data collection points, both at normal PAP and increased PAP (generated by microbead embolization). Results Noninvasive estimates of PAP were moderately but significantly correlated with invasive measurements of PAP. A high degree of variance was noted for all estimations, with increased variance at higher PAP. The addition of RAPECHO improved correlation and bias in all cases. RAPRHC was significantly correlated with RAPECHO and with subjectively assessed right atrial size (RA sizesubj). Conclusions Spectral Doppler assessments of tricuspid and pulmonic regurgitation are imperfect methods for predicting PAP as measured by catheterization despite an overall moderate correlation between invasive and noninvasive values. Noninvasive measurements may be better utilized as part of a comprehensive assessment of PAP in canine patients. RAPRHC appears best estimated based on subjective assessment of RA size. Including estimated RAPECHO in estimates of PAP improves the correlation and relatedness between noninvasive and invasive measures of PAP, but notable variability in accuracy of estimations persists.

More recently, fallopian tube catheterization has been used for tubal sterilization. Interventional radiologists tested numerous methods for tubal occlusion using the rabbit as an animal model. As a result, a tubal device has recently been Food and Drug Administration approved for permanent sterilization using hysteroscopic guidance; it can also be placed fluoroscopically by fallopian tube catheterization as an âoff-labelâ procedure. This is a 5-year continuation and update on a procedure that has been done by interventional radiologists for 25 years; history of the development of fallopian tube catheterization in women has been published in detail in this journal. Highlighted in this article will be description of the basic components needed for fallopian tube catheterization.

We investigated the pore size and structure, porosity, swelling as well as cell viability of a series of recombinant human collagen-peptide-chitosan (RHCC) scaffolds fabricated by lyophilization. In this paper, freezing regime containing a final temperature of freezing (Tf) and cooling rates was applied to obtain scaffolds with pore size ranging from 100Î¼m to 120Î¼m. Other protocols of RHC/chitosan suspension concentration and ratio modification were studied to produce more homogenous and appropriate structural scaffolds. The mean pore size decreased along with the decline of Tf at a slow cooling rate of 0.7Â°C/min; a more rapid cooling rate under 5Â°C/min resulted to a smaller pore size and more homogenous microstructure. High concentration could reduce pore size and lead to thick well of scaffold, while improved the ratio of RHC, lamellar and fiber structure coexisted with cellular pores. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded on these manufactured scaffolds, the cell viability represented a negative correlation to the pore size. This study provides an alternative method to fabricate 3D RHC-chitosan scaffolds with appropriate pores for potential tissue engineering. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Doppler echocardiography (DE) is widely used as a noninvasive method to assess pulmonary arterial pressure. However, recent studies have found several hemodynamic factors that affect its accuracy in estimating systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP). But the effect of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has not been investigated. Therefore, our study is aimed to determine whether the severity of TR will affect the accuracy of sPAP measured by DE in an unselected patient population. We retrospectively studied 177 patients who underwent DE and right heart catheterization (RHC) examinations. Patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the severity of TR (mild, moderate, and severe). The discrepancy in sPAP measured by DE and RHC was calculated and compared in each group. Determinants of discordant results between two methods were also evaluated. Age, gender, interval between DE and RHC, sequence of DE and RHC were similar among groups (all P>.05). Differences in sPAP, RAP, and tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TR-PG) were similar in group 1 and 2 (all P>.05), while all significantly higher in group 3 (all P<.05). The difference in sPAP between DE and RHC was affected independently by severe TR and severe PH (both P<.05). Severe TR and severe PH affect the accuracy of sPAP measured by DE. Modification of echocardiographic sPAP measurements by taking into consideration of these factors may lead to reduced systemic errors.

Methods The forecast model was derived using a 13-month retrospective cohort of 6384 catheterization patients. Predictor variables such as demographics, scheduled procedures, and clinical indicators mined from free-text notes were input to a multivariable logistic regression model that predicted the probability of inpatient admission. The model was embedded into a web-based application connected to the local EMR system and used to support bed management decisions. After implementation, the tool was prospectively evaluated for accuracy on a 13-month test cohort of 7029 catheterization patients. Results The forecast model predicted admission with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.722. Daily aggregate forecasts were accurate to within one bed for 70.3% of days and within three beds for 97.5% of days during the prospective evaluation period. The web-based application housing the forecast model was used by cardiology providers in practice to estimate daily admissions from the catheterization laboratory. Discussion The forecast model identified older age, male gender, invasive procedures, coronary artery bypass grafts, and a history of congestive heart failure as qualities indicating a patient was at increased risk for admission. Diagnostic procedures and less acute clinical indicators decreased patientsâ risk of admission. Despite the site-specific limitations of the model, these findings were supported by the literature. Conclusion Data-driven predictive analytics may be used to accurately forecast daily demand for inpatient beds for cardiac catheterization patients. Connecting these analytics to EMR data sources has the potential to provide advanced operational decision support.

The goal of this project was to develop a risk-standardization methodology to adjust for patient characteristics when comparing major adverse outcomes in the NCDR's (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment). Between January 2011 and March 2014, 39â725 consecutive patients within IMPACT undergoing cardiac catheterization were identified. Given the heterogeneity of interventional procedures for congenital heart disease, new procedure-type risk categories were derived with empirical data and expert opinion, as were markers of hemodynamic vulnerability. A multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of a major adverse event or death after cardiac catheterization was derived in 70% of the cohort and validated in the remaining 30%. The rate of major adverse event or death was 7.1% and 7.2% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Six procedure-type risk categories and 6 independent indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability were identified. The final risk adjustment model included procedure-type risk category, number of hemodynamic vulnerability indicators, renal insufficiency, single-ventricle physiology, and coagulation disorder. The model had good discrimination, with a C-statistic of 0.76 and 0.75 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Model calibration in the validation cohort was excellent, with a slope of 0.97 (standard error, 0.04; P value [for difference from 1] =0.53) and an intercept of 0.007 (standard error, 0.12; P value [for difference from 0] =0.95). The creation of a validated risk-standardization model for adverse outcomes after congenital cardiac catheterization can support reporting of risk\n\nA Non-Invasive Assessment of Cardiopulmonary Hemodynamics with MRI in Pulmonary Hypertension\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBane, Octavia; Shah, Sanjiv J.; Cuttica, Michael J.; Collins, Jeremy D.; Selvaraj, Senthil; Chatterjee, Neil R.; Guetter, Christoph; Carr, James C.; Carroll, Timothy J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose We propose a method for non-invasive quantification of hemodynamic changes in the pulmonary arteries resulting from pulmonary hypertension (PH). Methods Using a two-element windkessel model, and input parameters derived from standard MRI evaluation of flow, cardiac function and valvular motion, we derive: pulmonary artery compliance (C), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), time-averaged intra-pulmonary pressure waveforms and pulmonary artery pressures (systolic (sPAP) and diastolic (dPAP)). MRI results were compared directly to reference standard values from right heart catheterization (RHC) obtained in a series of patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension (PH). Results In 7 patients with suspected PH undergoing RHC, MRI and echocardiography, there was no statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between parameters measured by MRI and RHC. Using standard clinical cutoffs to define PH (mPAP â¥ 25 mmHg), MRI was able to correctly identify all patients as having pulmonary hypertension, and to correctly distinguish between pulmonary arterial (mPAPâ¥ 25 mmHg, PCWP<15 mmHg) and venous hypertension (mPAP â¥ 25 mmHg, PCWP â¥ 15 mmHg) in 5 of 7 cases.

Furthermore, myocardial perfusion imaging was not observed in the normal subjects but in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, especially severe pulmonary arterial hypertension subgroup, and showed potential diagnostic properties for pulmonary arterial hypertension. In conclusion, mean pulmonary arterial pressure levels are correlated with several right heart catheterization and echocardiography markers in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients; echocardiography and 99m Tc myocardial perfusion can be used to evaluate right ventricle performance in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. Impact statement In this study, we analyzed the clinical parameters for evaluating RV function, including right ventricle catheterization (RHC), echocardiography, and technetium 99m ( 99m Tc) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in normal Asian subjects and PAH patients ( nâ=â23 for each group). Our results demonstrated that six RHC indexes, four echocardiography indexes and MPI index were significantly altered in PAH patients and correlated with the levels of mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Importantly, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of MPI and found that MPI has a strong diagnostic accuracy in PAH patients. The findings from this study will be of interest to clinical investigators who make diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for PAH patients.\n\nRandomized controlled trial on the impact of music therapy during cardiac catheterization on reactive hyperemia index and patient satisfaction: the Functional Change in Endothelium After Cardiac Catheterization, With and Without Music Therapy (FEAT) study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRipley, Lindsay; Christopoulos, Georgios; Michael, Tesfaldet T; Alomar, Mohammed; Rangan, Bavana V; Roesle, Michele; Kotsia, Anna; Banerjee, Subhash; Brilakis, Emmanouil S\n\n2014-09-01\n\nTo determine the impact of music intervention on endothelial function, hemodynamics, and patient anxiety before, during, and after cardiac catheterization. The effect of music therapy during cardiac catheterization on endothelial function and patient satisfaction has received limited study. Seventy patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization were randomized to music therapy (n=36) or no music therapy (n=34). Peripheral arterial tonometry was performed before and after catheterization. A 6 item (24-point scale) questionnaire evaluating patient anxiety and discomfort levels was also administered after the procedure. Both study groups had similar baseline characteristics, fluoroscopy time, and contrast administration. Reactive hyperemia index (RHI) change was 0.14 Â± 0.72 in the music group and 0.30 Â± 0.58 in the control group (P=.35). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) changes did not significantly differ between the two groups (systolic BP change -3.3 Â± 17.3 mm Hg vs -2.3 Â± 19.4 mm Hg; P=.83 and diastolic BP change -1.9 Â± 12.2 mm Hg vs. 2.0 Â± 13.4 mm Hg; P=.23). Heart rate changes were also comparable between the two groups (-1 Â± 6 beats/ min vs -1 Â± 7 beats/min; P=.22). Patient satisfaction questionnaire measurements were found to be similar in patients with and without music therapy (8 [7-11] vs 9 [8-12]; P=.36). In this study, music intervention did not elicit a vasodilator response, did not lower blood pressure or heart rate, and did not relieve anxiety or stress discomfort in patients who underwent coronary angiography.\n\nEstimation of cardiac output and pulmonary vascular resistance by contrast echocardiography transit time measurement: a prospective pilot study.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Brian G; Sanai, Reza; Yang, Benjamin; Young, Heather A; Mazhari, Ramesh; Reiner, Jonathan S; Lewis, Jannet F\n\n2014-10-31\n\nStudies with other imaging modalities have demonstrated a relationship between contrast transit and cardiac output (CO) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). We tested the hypothesis that the transit time during contrast echocardiography could accurately estimate both CO and PVR compared to right heart catheterization (RHC). 27 patients scheduled for RHC had 2D-echocardiogram immediately prior to RHC. 3 ml of DEFINITY contrast followed by a 10 ml saline flush was injected, and a multi-cycle echo clip was acquired from the beginning of injection to opacification of the left ventricle. 2D-echo based calculations of CO and PVR along with the DEFINITY-based transit time calculations were subsequently correlated with the RHC-determined CO and PVR. The transit time from full opacification of the right ventricle to full opacification of the left ventricle inversely correlated with CO (r=-0.61, p<0.001). The transit time from peak opacification of the right ventricle to first appearance in the left ventricle moderately correlated with PVR (r=0.46, p<0.01). Previously described echocardiographic methods for the determination of CO (Huntsman method) and PVR (Abbas and Haddad methods) did not correlate with RHC-determined values (p = 0.20 for CO, p = 0.18 and p = 0.22 for PVR, respectively). The contrast transit time method demonstrated reliable intra- (p<0.0001) and inter-observer correlation (p<0.001). We describe a novel method for the quantification of CO and estimation of PVR using contrast echocardiography transit time. This technique adds to the methodologies used for noninvasive hemodynamic assessment, but requires further validation to determine overall applicability.\n\nTime From the Beginning of the Right Ventricle Isovolumetric Contraction to the Peak of the S Wave: A New TDI Indicator for the Non-Invasive Estimation of Pulmonary Hypertension.\n\nPubMed\n\nParsaee, Mozhgan; Ghaderi, Fereshteh; Alizadehasl, Azin; Bakhshandeh, Hooman\n\n2016-08-01\n\nEchocardiography is a key screening tool in the diagnostic algorithm of pulmonary hypertension (PH). In addition, tissue doppler imaging (TDI) is a promising method for the noninvasive estimation of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). The aim of this study was to validate the accuracy of measuring the time from the beginning of the right ventricular isovolumetric contraction time (RV IVRT) to the peak of the S wave in the TDI of the base of the RV free wall (time to peak or TTP), as an indicator for the non-invasive estimation of pulmonary hypertension. In this diagnostic test study, 60 consecutive patients referred for right heart catheterization (RHC) were enrolled. A pulse-wave TDI was performed before the cardiac catheterization, with a mean interval of 1 hour between the two measurements. The TDI variables, such as the RV IVRT, myocardial performance index (MPI), and the new \"time to peak\" parameter, were measured at the lateral basal RV free wall. The patients were divided into two sub-groups according to the RHC findings: no-PH (mean PAP < 25 mmHg) and PH (mean PAP â¥ 25 mmHg) groups. Then, we calculated the specificity and sensitivity of the TDI parameters (including the TTP) for the diagnosis of PH. In our study, the TTP showed a significant inverse relationship with the PAP. Based on our results, a TTP of less than 127 ms could be used to predict PH, with a sensitivity and specificity of about 70% (AUC = 0.746 Â± 0.064). Based on the results of this study, we suggest the use of a novel \"time from the beginning of isovolumetric contraction to the peak of the S wave\" (TTP) parameter in the TDI of the base of the RV free wall to predict PH with acceptable accuracy in comparison with RHC.\n\nSU-E-P-10: Imaging in the Cardiac Catheterization Lab - Technologies and Clinical Applications\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFetterly, K\n\n2014-06-01\n\nPurpose: Diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease in the cardiac catheterization laboratory is often aided by a multitude of imaging technologies. The purpose of this work is to highlight the contributions to patient care offered by the various imaging systems used during cardiovascular interventional procedures. Methods: Imaging technologies used in the cardiac catheterization lab were characterized by their fundamental technology and by the clinical applications for which they are used. Whether the modality is external to the patient, intravascular, or intracavity was specified. Specific clinical procedures for which multiple modalities are routinely used will be highlighted. Results: X-ray imaging modalitiesmoreÂ Â» include fluoroscopy/angiography and angiography CT. Ultrasound imaging is performed with external, trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE), and intravascular (IVUS) transducers. Intravascular infrared optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) is used to assess vessel endothelium. Relatively large (>0.5 mm) anatomical structures are imaged with x-ray and ultrasound. IVUS and IVOCT provide high resolution images of vessel walls. Cardiac CT and MRI images are used to plan complex cardiovascular interventions. Advanced applications are used to spatially and temporally merge images from different technologies. Diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease frequently utilizes angiography and intra-vascular imaging, and treatment of complex structural heart conditions routinely includes use of multiple imaging modalities. Conclusion: There are several imaging modalities which are routinely used in the cardiac catheterization laboratory to diagnose and treat both coronary artery and structural heart disease. Multiple modalities are frequently used to enhance the quality and safety of procedures. The cardiac catheterization laboratory includes many opportunities for medical physicists to contribute substantially toward advancing patient care.Â«Â less\n\nAnxiety reduction in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization following massage and guided imagery.\n\nPubMed\n\nArmstrong, Karen; Dixon, Simon; May, Sara; Patricolo, Gail Elliott\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of massage with or without guided imagery in reducing anxiety prior to cardiac catheterization. A total of 55 inpatients and outpatients received massage, guided imagery, or massage with guided imagery prior to cardiac catheterization. Self-reported anxiety levels and blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were evaluated in participants and a matched comparison group. Massage with and without guided imagery resulted in significant reductions in self-reported anxiety (pÂ <Â 0.0001). Patients receiving intervention had lower diastolic BP and HR vs. the comparison group (pÂ <Â 0.0001 and pÂ <Â 0.05). Massage with or without guided imagery immediately reduced self-reported anxiety. This pilot study has certain limitations: a non-randomized, convenience sample and a matched control group that was created retrospectively. However, the study indicates a benefit to providing massage or massage with guided imagery prior to anxiety-inducing medical procedures such as cardiac catheterization.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) accumulation has been reported in many human diseases. Understanding the role of hyaluronan and its binding proteins in the pathobiology of disease will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for many critical diseases. Current techniques described for the analysis of HA are mainly for HA quantification in solutions, not for the direct detection of HA in tissues or on cell surfaces. In our study, a fusion protein, named C-terminal domain of RHAMM-enhanced green fluorescence protein (RHC-EGFP), combined the HA-binding domain, C-terminal of receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility, with EGFP, a widely used enhanced green fluorescence protein, was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli with high purity. Based on the sensitivity and convenience of fluorescence detection, methods for direct assay of HA in solutions, on cell surface or in tissues were established using RHC-EGFP. The binding specificity was also confirmed by competitive binding experiment and hyaluronidase degradation experiment. Our results provide an alternative choice for the specific and convenient assay of HA in various samples, and maybe helpful for further understanding of the fundamental and comprehensive functions of HA.\n\nValidation of cardiac output using real-time measurement of oxygen consumption during cardiac catheterization in children under 3 years of age.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeckeler, Michael D; Hirsch, Russel; Beekman, Robert H; Goldstein, Bryan H\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo validate a method for determination of cardiac index (CI) using real-time measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2 ) in young children undergoing cardiac catheterization. Retrospective review comparing thermodilution cardiac index (TDCI) to CI calculated by the Fick equation using real-time measured VO2 (RT-VO2 ) and VO2 derived from 2 published predictive equations. Paired t-test and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare TDCI to Fick CI. A survey to ascertain pediatric cardiac catheterization practices regarding VO2 determination was also conducted. Quaternary care children's hospital cardiac catheterization laboratory. Children <3 years old with structurally normal hearts undergoing cardiac catheterization under general anesthesia with at least one set of contemporaneous TDCI and RT-VO2 measurements. Thirty-six paired measurements of TDCI and RT-VO2 were made in 27 patients over a 2-year period. Indications for catheterization included congenital diaphragmatic hernia postrepair (n = 13), heart disease post-orthotopic heart transplant (n = 13), and suspected cardiomyopathy (n = 1). Mean age was 21.5 Â± 8 months; median weight was 9.9âkg (IQR 8.57, 12.2). RT-VO2 was higher than VO2 predicted by the LaFarge equation (190 Â± 31 vs. 173.8 Â± 12.8 mL/min/m(2), P < .001), but there was no difference between TDCI and Fick CI calculated using VO2 from any method. Bland-Altman analysis showed excellent agreement between TDCI and Fick CI using RT-VO2 and VO2 predicted by the Lundell equation; Fick CI using VO2 predicted by the LaFarge equation showed fair agreement with TDCI. In children <3 years with a structurally normal heart, RT-VO2 generates highly accurate determinations of Fick CI as compared with TDCI. Additionally, in this population, VO2 derived from the LaFarge and Lundell equations generates accurate Fick CI compared with TDCI. Future studies are needed to identify factors associated with inaccurate VO2 generated from these predictive equations.

We sought to determine the impact of ECG machine auto-interpretation on CCL activation. The study period was from June 2010 to May 2012 (from June to November 2011, code heart I; from December 2011 to May 2012, code heart II). All patients aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with STEMI were evaluated for enrollment. Patients who experienced the code heart system were also included. Door-to-balloon time before and after code heart system were compared with a retrospective chart review. In addition, to determine the appropriateness of the activation, we compared coronary angiography performance rate and percentage of STEMI between code heart I and II. After the code heart system, the mean DTB time was significantly decreased (before, 96.51 Â± 65.60 minutes; after, 65.40 Â± 26.40 minutes; P = .043). The STEMI diagnosis and the coronary angiography performance rates were significantly lower in the code heart II group than in the code heart I group without difference in DTB time. Cardiac catheterization laboratory activation by ECG machine auto-interpretation does not reduce DTB time and often unnecessarily activates the code heart system compared with emergency physician-initiated activation. This system therefore decreases the appropriateness of CCL activation. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nCardiac Catheterization (For Kids)\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

Anticipation of life-threatening events and required rescue measures is a critical component to preprocedural preparation. We sought to determine the incidence and nature of life-threatening adverse events in congenital and pediatric cardiac catheterization, risk factors, and resources necessary to anticipate and manage events. Data from 8905 cases performed at the 8 participating institutions of the Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcomes were captured between 2007 and 2010 [median 1,095/site (range 133-3,802)]. The incidence of all life-threatening events was 2.1Â % [95Â % confidence interval (CI) 1.8-2.4Â %], whereas mortality was 0.28Â % (95Â % CI 0.18-0.41Â %). Fifty-seven life-threatening events required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, whereas 9Â % required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Use of a risk adjustment model showed that ageÂ <1Â year [odd ratio (OR) 1.9, 95Â % CI 1.4-2.7, pÂ <Â 0.001], hemodynamic vulnerability (OR 1.6, 95Â % CI 1.1-2.3, pÂ <Â 0.01), and procedure risk (category 3: OR 2.3, 95Â % CI 1.3-4.1; category 4: OR 4.2, 95Â % CI 2.4-7.4) were predictors of life-threatening events. Using this model, standardized life-threatening event ratios were calculated, thus showing that one institution had a life-threatening event rate greater than expected. Congenital cardiac catheterization and intervention can be performed safely with a low rate of life-threatening events and mortality; preprocedural evaluation of risk may optimize preparation of emergency rescue and bailout procedures. Risk predictors (ageÂ <Â 1, hemodynamic vulnerability, and procedure risk category) can enhance preprocedural patient risk stratification and planning.\n\n[Ultrasound-guided peripheral catheterization].\n\nPubMed\n\nSalleras-Duran, Laia; Fuentes-Pumarola, ConcepciÃ³\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPeripheral catheterization is a technique that can be difficult in some patients. Some studies have recently described the use of ultrasound to guide the venous catheterization. To describe the success rate, time required, complications of ultrasound-guided peripheral venous catheterization. and patients and professionals satisfaction The search was performed in databases (Medline-PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and Cuiden Plus) for studies published about ultrasound-guided peripheral venous catheterization performed on patients that provided results on the success of the technique, complications, time used, patient satisfaction and the type of professional who performed the technique. A total of 21 studies were included. Most of them get a higher success rate 80% in the catheterization ecoguide and time it is not higher than the traditional technique. The Technical complications analyzed were arterial puncture rates and lower nerve 10%. In all studies measuring and comparing patient satisfaction in the art ecoguide is greater. Various professional groups perform the technique. The use of ultrasound for peripheral pipes has a high success rate, complications are rare and the time used is similar to that of the traditional technique. The technique of inserting catheters through ultrasound may be learned by any professional group performing venipuncture. Finally, it gets underscores the high patient satisfaction with the use of this technique. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U.

Compared with surgical closure, the clinical effect of catheterization therapy in pediatric PDA patients requires meta-analysis. A systematic literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, and the Chinese Biomedicine literature database was conducted. Eligible studies included controlled trials of pediatric PDA patients receiving catheterization therapy vs surgical closure. Relative risks (RRs), standard mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and heterogeneity was assessed with the I(2) test. Seven studies with a total of 810 patients met the inclusion criteria. Catheterization therapy neither significantly increased the primary success rate (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.82-1.03, P = 0.16) nor reduced the total postprocedure complications (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.44-1.25, P = 0.26) and blood transfusion (RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.16-7.67, P = 0.93). Catheterization was associated with a statistically significant increase in residual shunts (RR: 5.19, 95% CI: 1.41-19.20, P = 0.01) and reduction in length of hospital stay (standard mean difference: -1.66, 95% CI: -2.65 to -0.67, P = 0.001). Catheterization therapy in pediatric PDA patients did not show a significant advantage in primary success rate, total complications, or blood transfusion, but it was associated with increase in residual shunts and reduction in length of hospital stay.

Herein we report the case of a patient with a PLSVC who was diagnosed after central venous catheterization (CVC). An 80-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with cardiopulmonary arrest. After the return of spontaneous circulation, CVC was blindly performed from the left jugular vein without any complications. However, routine chest X-ray after catheterization revealed that the catheter was moving down directly to the left heart. Thoracic computed tomography showed the right brachiocephalic vein draining into the left brachiocephalic vein and forming the left superior vena cava in front of the aortic arch. The left superior vena cava merged into the right atrium after crossing the left pulmonary artery. CVC is widely used in clinical practice, and therefore clinicians should be aware of possible variations in central veins, particularly during blind catheterization.\n\nDirect measurement of a patient's entrance skin dose during pediatric cardiac catheterization\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSun, Lue; Mizuno, Yusuke; Iwamoto, Mari; Goto, Takahisa; Koguchi, Yasuhiro; Miyamoto, Yuka; Tsuboi, Koji; Chida, Koichi; Moritake, Takashi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nChildren with complex congenital heart diseases often require repeated cardiac catheterization; however, children are more radiosensitive than adults. Therefore, radiation-induced carcinogenesis is an important consideration for children who undergo those procedures. We measured entrance skin doses (ESDs) using radio-photoluminescence dosimeter (RPLD) chips during cardiac catheterization for 15 pediatric patients (median age, 1.92 years; males, n = 9; females, n = 6) with cardiac diseases. Four RPLD chips were placed on the patient's posterior and right side of the chest. Correlations between maximum ESD and doseâarea products (DAP), total number of frames, total fluoroscopic time, number of cine runs, cumulative dose at the interventional reference point (IRP), body weight, chest thickness, and height were analyzed. The maximum ESD was 80 Â± 59 (mean Â± standard deviation) mGy. Maximum ESD closely correlated with both DAP (r = 0.78) and cumulative dose at the IRP (r = 0.82). Maximum ESD for coiling and ballooning tended to be higher than that for ablation, balloon atrial septostomy, and diagnostic procedures. In conclusion, we directly measured ESD using RPLD chips and found that maximum ESD could be estimated in real-time using angiographic parameters, such as DAP and cumulative dose at the IRP. Children requiring repeated catheterizations would be exposed to high radiation levels throughout their lives, although treatment influences radiation dose. Therefore, the radiation dose associated with individual cardiac catheterizations should be analyzed, and the effects of radiation throughout the lives of such patients should be followed.

Cardiac catheterization is a key step in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases. Decreasing the stress of cardiac catheterization is a key factor in improving patients' well-being. The aim of the study was to explore the effect of music on psychophysiological indices in patients awaiting cardiac catheterization examination. Using a 2-group repeated-measures design, 54 subjects aged 47 to 70 years and scheduled for cardiac catheterization examination were recruited. The subjects were randomly assigned to either the music group (27 subjects) or the usual-care group (27 subjects). Subjects in the music group listened to 30 minutes of music, whereas the usual-care group rested quietly, as in routine care. The heart rate (HR), HR variability, and skin temperature (ST) were measured at 7 time points and were recorded by the MP150 recording system (BIOPAC Systems, Inc, Goleta, California). Heart rate variability was analyzed by power spectral analysis: low frequency, high frequency, and ratio of low frequency to high frequency. The state of anxiety was measured at baseline and at time 7. At the end of the study, the subjects' music preference was evaluated using a visual analog scale. Listening to music resulted in a significantly reduced state of anxiety (P = .003). Both the music and quiet rest groups noted the beneficial effects of decreased HR and increased ST (all P < .001). The treatment effects of both interventions on HR variability were inconclusive. Moreover, we also found that the higher the scores of the music preference, the lower the subjects' perceived anxiety level (P = .05). Our findings provide the necessary scientific support for the use of sedative music and quiet rest as safe and effective interventions against anxiety, as manifested in the subjects' anxiety state, HR, and ST.\n\nComparison of Urinary Tract Infection Rates Associated with Transurethral Catheterization, Suprapubic Tube and Clean Intermittent Catheterization in the Postoperative Setting: A Network Meta-Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHan, Christopher S; Kim, Sinae; Radadia, Kushan D; Zhao, Philip T; Elsamra, Sammy E; Olweny, Ephrem O; Weiss, Robert E\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe performed a network meta-analysis of available randomized, controlled trials to elucidate the risks of urinary tract infection associated with transurethral catheterization, suprapubic tubes and intermittent catheterization in the postoperative setting. PubMedÂ®, EMBASEÂ® and Google Scholarâ¢ searches were performed for eligible randomized, controlled trials from January 1980 to July 2015 that included patients who underwent transurethral catheterization, suprapubic tube placement or intermittent catheterization at the time of surgery and catheterization lasting up to postoperative day 30. The primary outcome of comparison was the urinary tract infection rate via a network meta-analysis with random effects model using the netmeta package in R 3.2 (www.r-project.org/). Included in analysis were 14 randomized, controlled trials in a total of 1,391 patients. Intermittent catheterization and suprapubic tubes showed no evidence of decreased urinary tract infection rates compared to transurethral catheterization. Suprapubic tubes and intermittent catheterization had comparable urinary tract infection rates (OR 0.903, 95% CI 0.479-2.555). On subgroup analysis of 10 randomized, controlled trials with available mean catheterization duration data in a total of 928 patients intermittent catheterization and suprapubic tube were associated with significantly decreased risk of urinary tract infection compared to transurethral catheterization when catheterization duration was greater than 5 days (OR 0.173, 95% CI 0.073-0.412 and OR 0.142, 95% CI 0.073-0.276, respectively). Transurethral catheterization is not associated with an increased urinary tract infection risk compared to suprapubic tubes and intermittent catheterization if catheterization duration is 5 days or less. However, a suprapubic tube or intermittent catheterization is associated with a lower rate of urinary tract infection if longer term catheterization is expected in the postoperative period.

Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) estimation by echocardiography (echo) is used to screen for PH. However, the sensitivity of this method is suboptimal. We hypothesized that RVSP estimation in conjunction with other echo parameters would improve the value of echo for PH. The Duke Echo database was queried for adult patients with known or suspected PH who had undergone both echo and right heart catheterization (RHC) within a 24Â h period between 1/1/2008 and 12/31/2013. Patients with complex congenital heart disease, heart transplantation, ventricular assist device, or on mechanical ventilation at time of study were excluded. Diagnostic characteristics of several echo parameters (right atrial enlargement, pulmonary artery (PA) enlargement, RV enlargement, RV dysfunction, and RVSP) for PH (mean PA pressure 25Â mmHg on RHC) were evaluated among 1007 patients. RVSP â¥40 had a sensitivity of 77% (accuracy 77), while RVSP â¥35 had the highest sensitivity at 88% (81% accuracy). PA enlargement had the lowest sensitivity at 17%. The area under the curve (AUC) for RVSP was 0.844. A model including RVSP, RA, PA, RV enlargement and RV dysfunction had a higher AUC (AUCâ=â0.87) than RVSP alone. The value of echo as a screening test for PH is improved by a model incorporating a lower RVSP in addition to other right heart parameters. These findings need to be validated in prospective cohorts.\n\nPulmonary artery relative area change detects mild elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance and predicts adverse outcome in pulmonary hypertension.\n\nPubMed\n\nSwift, Andrew J; Rajaram, Smitha; Condliffe, Robin; Capener, Dave; Hurdman, Judith; Elliot, Charlie; Kiely, David G; Wild, Jim M\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical use of magnetic resonance imaging measurements related to pulmonary artery stiffness in the evaluation of pulmonary hypertension (PH). A total of 134 patients with suspected PH underwent right heart catheterization (RHC) and magnetic resonance imaging on a 1.5-T scanner within 2 days. Phase contrast imaging at the pulmonary artery trunk and cine cardiac views were acquired. Pulmonary artery area change (AC), relative AC (RAC), compliance (AC/pulse pressure from RHC), distensibility (RAC/pulse pressure from RHC), right ventricular functional indices, and right ventricular mass were all derived. Regression curve fitting identified the statistical model of best fit between RHC measurements and pulmonary artery stiffness indices. The diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of noninvasive AC and RAC were also assessed. The relationship between pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery RAC was best reflected by an inverse linear model. Patients with mild elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance (<4 Woods units) demonstrated reduced RAC (P = 0.02) and increased right ventricular mass index (P < 0.0001) without significant loss of right ventricular function (P = 0.17). At follow-up of 0 to 40 months, 18 patients with PH had died (16%). Analysis of Kaplan-Meier plots showed that both AC and RAC predicted mortality (log-rank test, P = 0.046 and P = 0.012, respectively). Area change and RAC were also predictors of mortality using univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (P = 0.046 and P = 0.03, respectively). Noninvasive assessment of pulmonary artery RAC is a marker sensitive to early increased vascular resistance in PH and is a predictor of adverse outcome.\n\nOne-stop shop assessment for atrial septal defect closure using 256-slice cor"
