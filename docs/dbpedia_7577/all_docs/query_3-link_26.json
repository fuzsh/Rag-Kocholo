        "text": "Weekly Briefing, Vol. 57. No. 1 (BH) December 2022\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina Briefing: Political Summary 2022\n\nSummary\n\nWe observe the political year 2022 through three ethno-regional party cleavages, Serbian-Serbian in Banja Luka, Croatian-Croatian in Mostar, and Bosnian-Bosniak[1] in Sarajevo. Each of these three political divides has its own structure and dynamics, and the dominant party is condemned to cooperate with the dominant parties in the other two cleavages through a complicated system of power-sharing. The only component that tries to overcome this triple duality is “Bosnian” component, which is still (and yet) too weak in the parts of BiH where Serbs and Croats predominantly live. Observing the relations of forces in these three dividing lines, we try to summarize the political year 2022 in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIntro\n\nEvery pre-election year in Bosnia and Herzegovina has one common feature, which is that nothing that happens can be viewed outside of the pre-election context. This, of course, applies most of all to political events, both in parliaments and in the executive branch. The governments are trying not to make any move that could distract some of the categories of voters from voting for the parties they belong to. The opposition criticizes everything the governments do or do not do, trying to animate each of the categories of the population that are dissatisfied for some reason, and there are many of them in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are also many who are included in the interest network of the ruling parties, in various ways: through work in the civil service, through work with state bodies, or through some of the many benefits that are issued through social expenditures on the expenditure side of the budget. Raising inter-ethnic tensions and such rhetoric continues to prove to be the best way to mobilize the electorate within the given ethnic folds. Serious and necessary reform cuts are left for the post-election period. It was like that in 2022.\n\nPolitical divides\n\nIt is generally known that there are several levels of governments in BiH, one state, two entity, ten cantonal, and one in the Brčko District. At all fourteen levels, de facto and de iure, power must be held by several heterogeneous parties (except theoretically in the Republika Srpska entity, which is quite centralized) due to different veto possibilities and the role of ethnic rights in the constitutional arrangement. In the simplest terms, coalitions are formed in the Federation between two parties or two groups of parties that can secure a majority in both houses of the Parliament of the Federation of BiH, which means that they get votes in constituencies in majority Croat (three) and majority Bosniak cantons (five), and two ethnically mixed. So, the government in the Federation is actually made up of at least two groups of parties, again conditionally speaking, those based in Mostar and those based in Sarajevo. At the level of the entity Republika Srpska, where the ethnic veto is not as strong as in the Federation of BiH, the government is formed by the person who collects the majority in the electoral units in this entity. These are, generally speaking, parties from Banja Luka with a Serbian national prefix. Finally, at the state level, the parties that won the constituencies in both entities must form a joint government in order to have a majority in each of the two houses of parliament and the people’s clubs in the House of Peoples of the BiH Parliamentary Assembly. This, again, actually means that the government is not formed on a program and especially not on a common ideology, but on the distribution of functions between three parties or party groups at the BiH level, that is, two parties or two party groups at the FBiH level, and one in the Republika Srpska.\n\nPolitical movements in 2022 are perhaps best viewed through cleavages or divisions that occur in each of the three unavoidable factors that “must” form the majority at the BiH level. These are the cleavages between the coalition of eight parties colloquially named “The eight” and the Party of Democratic Action (Stranka demokratske akcije – SDA) in Sarajevo; the Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska demokratska zajednica – HDZ) and other Croatian parties in Mostar; and the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (Savez nezavisnih socijaldemokrata – SNSD) and their coalition parties on the one hand, and the parties of the Serbian opposition on the other in Banja Luka.\n\nRepublika Srpska: Dodik against the opposition\n\nIn 2022, the fight between the ruling coalition led by the SNSD and the president of that party, Milorad Dodik, and the opposition led by two parties, the Party of Democratic Progress (Partija demokratskog progresa – PDP) and the Serbian Democratic Party (Srpska demokratska stranka – SDS), continued at the level of RS. The PDP and the SDS have been in opposition at the level of this entity since 2006, and in each of the previous election cycles they have tried to overthrow Dodik and his coalition, which also includes several smaller parties that are more or less loyal partners of the SNSD. such as the Socialist Party of Republika Srpska (Socijalistička partija Republike Srpske), Democratic Union (Demokratski savez – DS), United Srpska (Ujedinjena Srpska – US), etc. Dodik is building the image of a firm guardian of the constitutional and legal position of the RS entity, an entity that, sooner or later, according to Dodik, will go on the path of independence, with the support of Russia and other European countries. Dodik also boasts about the economic success and stability of this entity[2]. All these policies have come to an end in 2022they faced criticism from the opposition ranks[3]. Several personalities stood out as recognizable faces of the opposition, above all the young mayor of the largest city in the RS, PDP’s wunderkind Draško Stanivuković, and economic expert Jelena Trivić. To them should be added the representative in the National Assembly of the RS, Nebojša Vukanović, who is the loudest critic of Dodik’s rule[4]. However, the opposition suffered a defeat in the elections, and serious analyzes of the reasons for this are still awaited. Some of the analysts believe that the opposition, playing the card of Serbian nationalism, cannot defeat Dodik, who is a master of that game. Others are inclined to believe that the elections were not fair, that is, that the opposition won many more votes[5]. The third say that the opposition is not up to the task before it, and they give the right to quarrels between the opposition leaders that surfaced after the October elections, most specifically between the mentioned mayor Stanivuković and the candidate for the president of the RS Trivić, in which the latter claims that Mayor Stanivuković found a political symbiosis with Dodik’s regime[6]. Be that as it may, the turbulent 2022 ended extremely favorably for the ruling coalition in RS and badly, too badly, for its opponents.\n\nCroatian factor in the Federation: Almighty Čović\n\nThe smallest of the three constituent nations in BiH has the least political pluralism. The largest national party among the Croats, the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Hrvatska demokratska zajednica BiH – HDZ BiH), which has been in power in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina with two minor interruptions since 1996, welcomed 2022 as part of the ruling group in both the FBiH entity and the state. As things stand and according to the election results, nothing will change there. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, they are an indispensable factor, especially since they have brought under their ideological umbrella almost all parties with a Croatian sign, which operate under the strange framework of the Croatian National Assembly (Hrvatski narodni sabor – HNS), a non-governmental body that pretends to be a pan-national body that makes some kind of binding decisions for its members[7]. Many small Croatian parties are active in the HNS, but in fact only the HDZ which has been ruled undisputedly by Dragan Čović since 2005 remains the major political force. During the past years and decades, both Čović and HDZ had difficult years, but 2022 was favorable[8]. The Electoral Law of BiH, on whose changes the HDZ insisted the most, was the key point of the political negotiations, and when they did not bear fruit, the changes were imposed by the high representative of the international community of BiH, Christian Schmidt. The small number of the Croatian national corps and the fear of being outvoted, as in the case of the election of the civic-oriented Sarajevo politician Željko Komšić[9], a fierce opponent of Čović, as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina from among the Croatian people, and for whom Bosniaks and many citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina voted for various reasons, led to the gathering of Croats around HDZ BiH, while other Croatian national and conservative options picked up the crumbs[10]. Also, the HDZ BiH, like other ruling parties, has the possibility of political appointments and influence on the Croatian component of the politicized civil service, which employs loyal staff and their capillary structures at the local level.\n\n“Eight” against SDA: Everyone against Izetbegović\n\nIn Sarajevo, the capital of BiH and the spiritual and political center of the state, Bosnian Muslims – Bosniaks, but also the center of ideologically left-wing parties that inherit multi-ethnicity in their programs and activities, the largest plurality that was realized in 2022. In Sarajevo and wider through entity Federation of BiH there is clear front between parties of “Eight” and SDA. The SDA, the largest national party of the Bosniaks, has been in power in the Federation of BiH from 1996 to the present, with one minor interruption, now long ago in 2000-2001 (and in the government from 2010-2014 SDA was in power as a minor partner, but again with a high-quality consumption of power). However, in 2022, a motley and diverse group of political parties gathered first around the candidacy of social-democrat Denis Bećirović for a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina from among the Bosniak people. After the electios, this parties start the proces of creating an alternative to the SDA, which, although individually the strongest political party in the Federation of BiH, was left without coalition capacity.\n\nInteresting trends had been taking place in Sarajevo in recent years and decades. These are trends in the fragmentation of the political scene. From two political parties, one from the left political spectrum, the SDP, and one from its right, the SDA, numerous political parties emerged that now seem the most distant from the parties from which they were created. If we look on the left side, we can remember that in 2008, a group of SDP sympathizers and declared leftists formed Our Party (Naša stranka – NS). In 2012, the vice president of the party, Željko Komšić, left the SDP, and a year later formed the Democratic Front (Demokratska fronta – DF). In 2019, the former head of SDP in the Tuzla Canton, Enver Bijedić, formed the Social Democrats of BiH (Socijaldemokrati BiH – SD BiH). Former Vice President of NS Damir Marjanović and former Secretary General of the DF Zlatko Miletic jointly formed the political initiative “For New Generations” (Za nove generacije – ZNG) in 2022.\n\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, even more divisions were taking place. Back in 1996, one of the founders, Haris Silajdžić, left the SDA and formed the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina (Stranka za BiH – SBiH). One party wing in the west of BiH left SDA in 2006 and formed the Party of Democratic Activities (A-SDA), today Narodni evropski savez (People’s European Union – NES). The former vice-president of the SDA, Mirsad Kukić, left the SDA in 2018 and formed the PDA Democratic Activity Movement (Pokret demokratke aktivnosti – PDA) in the Tuzla Canton. Same year, the former SDA prime minister of the Sarajevo Canton, Dino Konaković, left the party and formed the People and Justice (Narod i pravda – NiP). Former prominent SDA official Fuad Kasumović founded the BiH Initiative (BH inicijativa – BHI) in 2022. Some other parties were created and formed from the SDA, but they are not currently parliamentary, so we do not mention them in this overview. Be that as it may, all these parties (except DF) united in “The eight” to dethrone the SDA. The most under attack is party president Bakir Izetbegović, who is accused by the leaders of parties created from the SDA of corruption and incompetence[11], while the SDA retorts that they are careerists who only have the desire to rule. There are also accusations of betrayal of national interests[12].\n\nThe SDA has ruled the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a long time and has at its disposal the same mechanism as the HDZ, an army of civil servants and employees who probably owe their first job to their party card. There are also numerous social categories with which the SDA has achieved a kind of symbiosis for many years: war invalids, veterans’ organizations, but also the very influential Islamic community in BiH, which is the supreme religious and national authority of Bosnian Muslims. However, “Eight” accuses the SDA of bringing Bosniaks and the country to the brink of disaster in 2022, both economically and politically. The political atmosphere between the SDA and certain parties from “Eight” was heated throughout 2022, and there are no indications that the heat will subside.\n\nConclusion\n\nAt the end of 2022, the structures of the new government can be seen. In the Republika Srpska, the SNSD and its coalition partners will form the government. At the state level, SNSD and HDZ BiH have already agreed that they will continue to cooperate, which means that they will support each other, so there is no government at the BiH level without these two parties. In the Federation of BiH, the “Eight” and HDZ BiH have already concluded an agreement and it seems that the SDA could go into opposition after many years, although there are still some ambiguities caused by the changes imposed by the High Representative for BiH in the Constitution of the FBiH and the Election Law of BiH. In some scenarios, this could still leave the SDA in power, primarily in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has numerous jurisdictions and public companies with large budgets. In any case, 2022 could be a turning point from which the new political reality in BiH will be calculated.\n\n[1] “Bosnian” as an adjective here and otherwise is used for a supranational identity that is tied to regional affiliation or belonging to the state, while “Bosnian” refers to belonging to the ethnic group of Bosnian Muslims – Bosniaks. Colloquially, all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina are “Bosnians” and are recognized as such by residents of other South Slavic republics.\n\n[2]Dodik: Nobody will be able to impose anything on Republika Srpska. https://rs.n1info.com/region/dodik-republici-srpskoj-niko-nece-moci-nista-da-nametne/\n\n[3]The opposition refers to Vučić and criticizes the “warmongering calls” to the SNSD rally. https://mondo.ba/Info/Politika/a1175387/Spot-SNSD-Otadzbina-zove-reakcije-opozicije.html\n\n[4]Vukanović criticized Srpska’s budget “I heard that Vlahović from Juventus is going to SNSD, it pays the best there”. https://srpskainfo.com/vukanovic-isprozivao-buzet-srpske-cuo-sam-da-vlahovic-iz-juventusa-ide-u-snsd-tamo-se-najbolje-placa-video/\n\n[5]Miličević for Srpskainfo: The opposition was stolen, Dodik is a reality, we need a SECOND ROUND OF ELECTIONS. https://srpskainfo.com/milicevic-za-srpskainfo-opozicija-je-pokradena-dodik-je-realnost-treba-nam-drugi-krug-izbora/\n\n[6]Trivić: Stanivuković blackmailed us, if he stays in the PDP I will not. https://ba.n1info.com/vijesti/trivic-stanivkovic-nas-je-ucijenio-ako-on-ostane-u-pdp-u-ja-necu/\n\n[7]What is the Croatian National Assembly, whose members Plenković met in Mostar? https://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/clanak/sto-je-to-hrvatski-narodni-sabor-s-cijim-se-clanovima-plenkovic-sastao-u-mostaru-foto-20171205\n\n[8]Čović: There is no government without the HDZ, and our partner is whoever wins in the absolute sum of all the numbers and those dice that line up. https://www.faktor.ba/vijest/covic-bez-hdz-a-nema-vlasti-a-partner-nam-je-ko-pobijedi-u-apsolutnom-iznosu-svih-brojki-i-tih-kockica-koje-se-slazu/177714\n\n[9]“It is harmful that the Bosniaks imposed Komšić on the Croats, but without us it will not be possible to conduct politics in BiH”. https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/svijet/stetno-je-sto-su-bosnjaci-hrvatima-nametnuli-komsica-ali-bez-nas-se-nece-moci-voditi-politika-u-bih-15255928\n\n[10]DEUTSCHE WELLE ANALYZES: Čović turned the opposition into a politburo; Who wins the elections in BiH… https://www.slobodna-bosna.ba/vijest/269046/deutsche_welle_analizira_chovic_je_opoziciju_pretvorio_u_politbiro_ko_pobjedjuje_na_izborima_u_bih.html\n\n[11]Konaković: SDA is going to the opposition, they will benefit from the reform. https://avaz.ba/vijesti/bih/789174/konakovic-sda-ide-u-opoziciju-godit-ce-im-reforma"
