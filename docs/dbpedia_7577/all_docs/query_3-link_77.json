I see familiar faces from my many visits here as a Senator.\n\nIt is an honor and a privilege to return as Vice President of the United States.\n\nPresident Obama and I recently completed our first one hundred days in the White House.\n\nWe are pursuing a far-reaching domestic and foreign policy agenda, listening to our friends and allies, rebuilding relationships and re-establishing American leadership in the world.\n\nThis is my third trip to Europe in four months.\n\nPresident Obama made his first overseas trip to Europe in April.\n\nThis early emphasis on Europe was no accident.\n\nWe chose to spotlight the importance that the United States places on our European partners… and to energize those partnerships to address the challenges that we face together.\n\nThis is why I am so glad that my good friend Javier Solana, the EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, is here today.\n\nThe English Author Rebecca West once wrote that entering Sarajevo was like \"walking inside an opening flower.\"\n\nThat was true once, and it is again.\n\nI remember flying into this city in 1993, seeing the large homes on our approach to the airport, and realizing that the homes had become shells, empty except for the snipers who had taken up residence.\n\nIn town, we saw buildings destroyed, the tops blown off, the sides pockmarked with bullets.\n\nIn 2001, the last time I was here, change seemed slow in coming.\n\nIt was in January, and it was winter. And it still felt as if the spring would never arrive.\n\nToday, as I flew in, I saw something different – a city that is building again.\n\nI saw cranes and construction.\n\nOn the streets, there were cars and shops and people walking freely.\n\nAs your city and your country continue to rebuild, to build and to grow, I want to talk today about how this country, this region, Europe, and the community of nations can grow towards one another.\n\nOver the next several days, I will travel from here to Serbia and then to Kosovo. Our Deputy Secretary of State, Jim Steinberg, just visited Macedonia and Montenegro.\n\nOur message is clear: the Obama-Biden administration will sustain and re-energize the long standing American commitment to a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace.\n\nThe door is open for the countries of this region to be a part of that Europe – and the United States will help you to walk through that door.\n\nMany states in this region are already on the move:\n\nIn April, NATO Heads of State welcomed Albania and Croatia as new members of the Alliance.\n\nMacedonia will join NATO as soon as the name dispute with Greece is resolved.\n\nMontenegro is making steady progress on an ambitious reform agenda that will ensure the quickest-possible integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions.\n\nWhen I travel to Belgrade tomorrow, I will tell President Tadic that the United States wants to build a new partnership with Serbia.\n\nAnd we want to see Serbia take its rightful place in Europe as a strong, successful democratic state playing a constructive role in the region.\n\nSerbia and the United States disagree on Kosovo.\n\nWe do not expect Serbia to recognize Kosovo.\n\nBut we do expect Belgrade to cooperate with the European Union and other key international actors on Kosovo, and to look for pragmatic solutions that will improve the lives of its people – Serbs and Albanians – and avoid making them victims of political disagreement.\n\nKosovo recently celebrated one year of independence -- and continues to progress as a multi-ethnic democracy.\n\nThis independence, while young, is irreversible, and critically important to this region’s stability – and progress.\n\nThe United States is committed to a democratic, multiethnic, independent Kosovo.\n\nAnd we expect Kosovo to remain committed to powerful protections for all communities and their members, including the Serb community. That commitment is a key to Kosovo’s future.\n\nBut this era of progress is not without peril.\n\nAs you well know, letting go of the past is a daily struggle – it is tempting to fall back on old patterns and ancient animosities.\n\nEmbracing the future is hard work.\n\nIt requires persistence, commitment and the recognition that compromise is not a sign of weakness – it is evidence of real strength.\n\nIt is that kind of strength that I want to talk about today.\n\nIt is that kind of strength that the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its leaders must summon if a country that has known so much pain is to make a final leap to peace and prosperity.\n\nA decade and a half ago, war tore this country apart and left at least 100,000 dead… and millions homeless.\n\nThe genocide at Srebrenica brought home the unspeakable savagery of that war to the world.\n\nIt was a call to conscience.\n\nMy country – for too long on the sidelines – could no longer stand by.\n\nWith our European partners, through the combined use of NATO’s military power and diplomacy in an American city called Dayton, the war was brought to a halt.\n\nThe hard work of building a new Bosnia began.\n\nAmerica takes pride in our commitment to a peaceful, successful, Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nFor nearly 15 years, America has been sending our sons and daughters to you – tens of thousands of troops, diplomats, military and police trainers and experts in a wide range of areas to help your country and its citizens.\n\nWith our NATO allies and partners, we have devoted blood, sweat and treasure to ending the horrific violence that engulfed your country and to helping you recover and rebuild in peace.\n\nAmericans feel that we have a stake in your success.\n\nWe feel that we have earned the right to speak honestly, even bluntly, in a country that captured our hearts.\n\nToday, we are worried about the direction your country, your future, and your children’s future are taking.\n\nFor three years, we have seen a sharp and dangerous rise in nationalist rhetoric designed to play on people’s fears, to stir up anger and resentment.\n\nWe have seen state institutions – which must be strengthened for Bosnia to meet the challenges of the 21st century and to advance toward EU and NATO membership – openly challenged and deliberately undermined.\n\nWe have witnessed attempts to roll back the reforms of the last decade -- the very reforms that prompted EU and NATO to open their doors to the citizens of this country.\n\nWe have heard voices speaking the language of maximalism and absolutism that destroys states -- not the language of compromise and cooperation that builds them.\n\nThe results are predictable – deepening mistrust between communities, deadlock on reforms, and dangerous talk about the country’s future that is reminiscent of the tragedies the people of this country have worked so hard to overcome.\n\nThis must stop.\n\nLet me be clear: Your only real path to a secure and prosperous future is to join Europe as Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nRight now, you’re off that path.\n\nTo get back on track, you need to work together across ethnic and party lines so that your country functions like a country –and so that you interact with the rest of the world as a single, sovereign state.\n\nYou can do that as a state with two vibrant entities. We’re not telling you how to organize yourselves, so long as you protect the rights of all the peoples of Bosnia.\n\nAny sovereign state requires a few basic things. Here are some examples:\n\nThe state needs to control the national army.\n\nIt must prevail where there is a conflict between state and local laws.\n\nIt requires an electoral process that does not exclude any ethnic group.\n\nThe state must have the power to raise revenue.\n\nAnd it must have the authority to negotiate with the EU and other states and implement its obligations.\n\nYou can follow this path to Europe.\n\nOr you can choose an alternative course. But you need to understand the consequences.\n\nAt best, you’ll remain among the poorest countries in Europe.\n\nAt worst, you’ll descend into ethnic chaos that defined your country for the better part of a decade. And you will be judged harshly by history and your children.\n\nThe choice is yours. If you make the right choice, we will stand with you.\n\nMaking the right choice means that the leaders of this country must stop the pursuit of narrow ethnic and political interests instead of the national interest. You must resist challenges to your sovereignty or territorial integrity.\n\nYou must focus your talent and energy on issues of undisputed interest to all Bosnians – creating jobs, growing the economy, educating your children. You must accept that Bosnia needs checks and balances to protect the interests of all constituent peoples and minorities.\n\nEach of you has a responsibility to exercise your power in a manner that reassures every member of the community. You must examine your conduct within your governing institutions and ask yourselves: are we building trust or feeding fears?\n\nWorking across ethnic lines to forge the complicated and sometimes unpopular compromises required for Euro-Atlantic integration is difficult. But it is the only way forward.\n\nAnd it is a path you have already shown you can travel – on defense reform creating a unified military, on rule-of-law reforms required to pursue justice for all citizens regardless of ethnicity.\n\nAnd most recently, in March, for the first time, you amended your constitution to resolve questions on the status of the Brcko District. This issue was too hard to resolve at Dayton. Yet you, the elected representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, were able to come together and pass overwhelmingly an amendment enshrining Brcko’s status.\n\nThis is the approach – this is the spirit of compromise – that you need to confront Bosnia’s remaining challenges.\n\nAmong the most urgent challenges is completing the objectives and conditions established by the Peace Implementation Council for the closure of the Office of the High Representative.\n\nThe new High Representative, Valentin Inzko, is here today. He has the United States’ full support – and now he must have yours.\n\nThe United States will stand behind OHR so long as it remains in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we will not agree to its closure until after the agreed reform agenda – the five objectives and two conditions – is completed.\n\nThe international community must be satisfied that all levels of government are prepared to fully comply with the Dayton Peace Agreement – and that their leaders are prepared to abandon rhetoric and actions that would threaten or violate the Peace Agreement – before the international community presence and role here can change.\n\nIn my view, the children of this country deserve a democratic Bosnia in which all live in peace and cooperation inside Euro-Atlantic institutions. You owe that to them.\n\nEveryone wants the quiet blessings of a normal life for themselves and for their children, one in which they can travel freely throughout this continent, pursue their economic dreams, and live their daily lives as part of a modern, democratic, and tolerant society.\n\nA prosperous, secure, democratic future inside the Trans-Atlantic community is not a guarantee or a gift. It must be built through hard work and compromise.\n\nAnd it will not happen if you perpetuate the divisions that have plagued Bosnia in the past. History must not be the anvil upon which new hatreds are forged.\n\nSome of your political leaders and many citizens of Bosnia understand this and are already acting on it. Late last year, Sulejman Tihic addressed the Republika Srpska parliament and reassured the citizens of that entity that Bosniaks are prepared to work within the Dayton framework to build a better future for all Bosnia’s citizens.\n\nMany others are working for that better future. With us today are NGOs and members of civil society – Including the Research and Documentation Center; the Center for Civic Initiatives; and CIVITAS – who shore up the foundations of democracy and tolerance.\n\nHere, too, are lawyers and jurists building the rule of law. And journalists, who courageously challenge nationalist myths and expose corruption. Their work is as noble as it is necessary. In the end, we cannot escape history. We cannot forget it.\n\nBut neither can we allow the shadows that darkened so much of the end of the last century to stretch into this one. When he was a young child, Hajat Avdovic left Sarajevo as a refugee and came to America. He succeeded in school and sports. His father, Erol, is a journalist who accompanied me here on Air Force 2.\n\nHajat wrote a wonderful poem about his native Sarajevo. I want to quote from it now:\n\nMosques, churches and temples once lined\n\nYour beautiful landscape\n\nSometime ago your bridges connected\n\nGenerations of lives, of Muslim, Croat and Serb\n\nSometime ago, you were more than just a news story\n\nMore than just a city, more than just a name\n\nSometime ago, you were the heart\n\nThe heart of a nation\n\nBut the cannons rolled in one morning…\n\nAnd just like that,\n\nBullet after bullet,\n\nMortar after mortar,\n\nBosnian after Bosnian…\n\nIn the words of Suada Dilberovic\n\n\"Oh please tell me this is not happening in Sarajevo\"\n\nBut it was,\n\nWe all fell\n\nWe fell\n\nBut,\n\nWe never lost\n\nWe never lost our city\n\nWe never lost our heart\n\nWe never lost our native Sarajevo\n\nThis is the story that still needs to be told\n\nYes, this is the story that still needs to be told.\n\nThe story of Sarajevo.\n\nThe story of Bosnia.\n\nThe story of your future."
