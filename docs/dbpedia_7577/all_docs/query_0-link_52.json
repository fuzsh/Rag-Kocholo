        "text": "Weekly Briefing, Vol. 68. No. 1 (BH) December 2023\n\nPolitical Summary 2023\n\nSummary\n\nThe year at the end brought new executive authorities at all levels in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but no significant changes. The governing coalitions are still made up of diverse parties that have different priorities on the domestic and foreign policy fronts. Economic problems are piling up, the necessary reforms are being undertaken mostly in small steps. Progress compared to the previous government is felt, but not as much as optimists would like to portray.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, the results of the General Elections held in October 2022 were implemented, and new majorities and governments were formed at all levels (except for the Government of the entity Republic of Srpska, which was formed at the end of December 2022). Forming governments is a complex process that implies the synchronization of various actors in the system: consensus of all subjects that can stop or veto the process. Ultimately, this leads to huge, multi-party, mathematically based coalitions at the level of the state of BiH (Council of Ministers of BiH) and the Federation of BiH entity (FBiH Government). In last year’s political review, we made it by following the cleavage of political parties in BiH[1]. This time we are making an overview through the results of the governments at state and entity levels in BiH.\n\nCouncil of Ministers (CoM)\n\nIn the last week of January 2023, the House of Representatives (HoP) of the Parliamentary Assembly of BiH (PA BiH) elected a new convocation of the BiH CoM. Thus, in a relatively short period of time, BiH got a state government ministers as heads of nine departments and a chairman at the head of the Council[2]. This CoM is chaired by Ms. Borjana Krišto, who is one of the most loyal staff members of the leader of the Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska demokratska zajednica – HDZ), Dragan Čović. In previous periods she has performed a number of responsible tasks on behalf of this party. HDZ claims it it is completely pro-European conservative party. Focus of her activities Ms. Krišto put in cooperation with factors in Brussels, but also in official Zagreb, capital of Republic of Croatia, where the HDZ, the parent party of the HDZ BiH, is also in power.\n\nThe pro-European position is very clearly and loudly represented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of BiH, Elmedin Konaković, otherwise the president of the People and Justice party (Narod i pravda – NiP). The focus of his work in 2023 was on cooperation with the European Union and Western allies, but also with partners from the East, especially from the Arab world. We wrote about this in the middle of the year, when the minister presented the first hundred days of the results of his work[3].\n\nThe Minister of Defense in CoM, Vice President of the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Socijaldemokratska partija BiH – SDP) Zukan Helez, has similar, pro-Western positions, who advocated pro-NATO positions and further integration of BiH into this military alliance. In the end, pro-European laws and reforms are nominally and essentially supported by the Minister of Transport and Communications of BiH, Edin Forto, the president of Our Party (Naša stranka – NS). … Opposite to them stand the representatives of Serbian politics in BiH, Staša Košarac, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations, and Nenad Nešić, Minister of Security. Košarac is one of the most influential members of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (Savez nezavisnih socijaldemokrata – SNSD), while Nešić is the president of the SNSD coalition Democratic People’s Alliance (Demokratski narodni savez – DNS). Although they are nominally in favor of reforms and BiH’s path towards membership in the EU, they take the position that any reforms that would mean the transfer of jurisdiction from the entity to the state of BiH, or more precisely from the entity of the RS to BiH, do not come in consideration – at all. HDZ ministers, who, in addition to the position of CoM chairman, hold the portfolios of justice (Davor Bunoza) and civil affairs (Ms Dubravka Bošnjak), were the least in the focus of the media.\n\nOn paramilitary groups\n\nDuring 2023 public was especially “entertained” by the bickering between the ministers of security and defense, Nešić and Helez, which occasionally turned into a real verbal war[4]. One of the key public disputes that reflected relations at the state level in the BiH Parliament and the CoM was about the alleged existence of paramilitary formations in BiH. It started with the RS representatives and delegates of the BiH Parliament sending a letter to the European Parliament and the US Congress in which they present their view of the political situation in BiH, making claims about alleged terrorist cells in BiH that could be activated[5]. They wrote that BiH has been a haven for “radical Islamists” for a long time, that the largest party that represents the majority national group in BiH, the Bosniaks, is explicitly Islamist in its ideology[6]. The parliamentarians from the RS stated that “in the Federation of BiH there are villages where residents enforce Sharia law and that parts of BiH inhabited by Bosniaks are still home to numerous sleeper cells of Al Qaeda and ISIL[7]“.\n\nMinister Helez asked the Intelligence and Security Agency (OSA) for information on whether this agency has information on whether there are any parajemats in BiH – organizations of Muslims that do not operate under the organization of the Islamic Community in BiH, as the parliamentarians stated[8]. (By the way, OSA, as one of the state security agencies, whose jurisdiction includes both detection and the fight against terrorism, is partially connected to Nešić’s Ministry of Security, although due to the nature of its work, it has significant independence.\n\nHowever, before Helez requested that the institutions investigate these allegations, he asserted in the media that there are paramilitary camps in the RS and that some people from Russia are doing it. Helez said that he has intelligence that the Russians are training young Serbs to be “military ready”, that he “knows where these camps are” and that they “can eliminate them” very easily[9].\n\nAnyhow, these claims by minister Helez were denied by the OSA. “The Intelligence and Security Agency of BiH has no information about the existence of military camps and paramilitary formations in Bosnia and Herzegovina,” this agency told Serbian News Agency – Srna. OSA stated that they forwarded the information on this to the Chairwoman Krišto[10].\n\nMinister Nešić appealed to all citizens not to fall for such manipulations and not to fear for security: “28 years after the war, we should be talking about science and technology centers, not inventing fairy tales about camps. I think Helez has a serious problem with the job he was elected to. By sending meaningless constructions to the public, Zukan Helez can only drive away investors, money and people from BiH”[11].\n\nSo, is the CoM’s year of work enough to conclude whether it is better, worse or the same compared to the previous convocation or previous convocations? It seems that, despite the example of the obvious frivolity of politicians at the state level regarding the non-existent training camps for Islamist and pro-Russian paramilitary groups, minimal progress is noticeable. This does not speak so much about the quality of the current CoM convocation, as it says more about the poor quality and lack of work of the previous ones. Political fights between different parties of the parliamentary majority often lead to the blocking of the work of the CoM, and so often that it is pointless to create a chronology of non-working, and blocking, and their causes. Nevertheless, even in such an atmosphere and constellation of political relations within the ruling group, perhaps not an essential but certain shift must be noted.\n\nOne third for ten percent\n\nThis state government differs from the previous one in only one third. Namely, the last one was also made up of Serbian nationalists from the RS gathered around the SNSD, and Croatian nationalists from the HDZ of BiH. This time there are no Bosniak nationalists from the SDA, but there are representatives of three Sarajevo-based parties NiP, NS and SDP (so called “Troika”) which are ideologically dispersed. Although the parties from the three blocs still have different views on many issues, it would not be wrong to say that the first year of work is better by at least ten percent.\n\nAlthough it is not the most precise data and although a deeper research should be done in order to obtain relevant indicators, let us mention here one variable: the number of decisions made by the CoM on an annual basis. Unlike laws that must pass through the BiH Parliament and its two houses (the House of Representatives and the House of Peoples), the decisions of the CoM are final. In terms of content, we are talking about various decisions such as personnel appointments, approval of intervention funds, various operational decisions, etc. In 2023, there were 193[12] such decisions by December 7, which is significantly more than in previous years and during previous CoM mandate, namely, in 2022, there were 154 such adopted decisions[13], in 2021 there were 163 decisions[14], and 178 of them in 2020[15].\n\nGovernment of the Federation of BiH\n\nIn May 2023, the entity Federation of BiH got a new government. After the mandate of 2010-2014, Nermin Nikšić, former secretary general, now president of the SDP returned to the prime minister’s chair. Unlike his coalition partners, the other two party presidents from the “Troika” who took positions at the state level, Nikšić took the more responsible but also influential position of entity prime minister. According to the constitutional structure, most of the political and economic processes take place at the entity levels, and the amount of money is far greater than at the state level.\n\nAnd the government in the Federation of BiH is not completely different from the previous mandates. Together with the parties of the Troika, the government consists of the HDZ, which has been a part of almost all previous governments (except for the short periods of 2000-2002 and 2011-2014). The “Troika” and HDZ parties have different political priorities. The strongest opposition party, the Bosniak nationalist SDA, constantly accused the “Troika” during 2023 of betraying national interests and that at the level of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina they are lenient towards the HDZ and give them “more than they deserve”. This was reflected in certain personnel appointments, but also in differences in tranches compared to local areas with Croat and Bosniak majorities.\n\nAmong the successes that Nermin Nikšić’s cabinet can boast about, we can single out a set of energy laws, which were adopted by the FBiH Parliament, and which bring improvements to the legal framework in this sector as well as European standards. These laws simplify the administrative procedures for the construction and operation of production plants that use renewable energy sources, primarily solar power plants and wind power plants, as well as the introduction of new categories of participants and activities in the electricity market, and the introduction of new rights and mechanisms for the empowerment and protection of end customers of electricity energy[16].\n\nOn the other hand, during 2023, the Government announced a set of fiscal laws that would enable easier business in this entity, lower contributions and other burdens for employers and higher wages for workers[17]. But nothing came of that key reform. The reasons should be sought in the complexity of that reform as well as the different points of view of the key actors of the social dialogue – employers, workers and the government itself. It seems that the government would like to simultaneously preserve and establish a position among workers and unions in order to give them confidence in the next elections, and at the same time facilitate business for employers through the liberalization of the market and the reduction of levies towards the state[18]. Again, this reduction in levies can lead to a reduction in the budget and not necessarily to an increase in spending, which means that it is a complex operation that can undermine the existing relative stability that reigns in the Federation of BiH[19].\n\nRepublic of Srpska\n\nOn the other side of the entity line, there is a different picture. The RS entity in 2023 was adorned with political monolith and economic uncertainty. Political unity boasted the existence of a significant majority for making numerous decisions – some of which were declared controversial. This applies in particular to several laws, such as the Law on the non-application of the Decision of the High Representative and the Law on the non-application of the decisions of the Constitutional Court of BiH in the territory of this entity, which were adopted in July 2023[20]. The majority in the RS entity considers that the Constitutional Court is a politicized institution in which Bosniak judges together with three foreign judges appointed by the President of the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg, most often make decisions to the detriment of the RS entity. Also, the majority in the RS does not recognize the German diplomat Christian Schmidt as a High Representative of the international community in BiH, given that his appointment was not confirmed by the UN Security Council. Therefore, among others, 2023 in the RS entity was marked by strategic outwitting and tactical positioning between the RS and Schmidt.\n\nMany believe that, by going to clash with the West, the ruling majority in the RS is making big mistakes, but that it is not a one-time fad. For example, the Law on the Criminalization of Defamation in the RS was adopted in this entity in August, which again made defamation a criminal offense in this entity. Many believe that this law stifles freedom of speech in the RS. Also, the draft Law on “Foreign Agents” was adopted in the RS, which includes, among other things, special surveillance for non-governmental organizations that are financed from abroad, a ban on political activities, the need for additional registration and sending of financial reports. During the year, there was a debate and sharp criticism of the law came from both the opposition and various international entities, which slowed down the process of passing the law, but did not stop it, nor did the government give up on it[21].\n\nAnd while the political battles with the Constitutional Court of BiH, the High Representative, the media and “foreign agents” continued, at the same time the economic situation in this entity declined. This year, the journalists calculated, the government of the RS borrowed 16 times on the stock market, and in total it collected 755 million KM through treasury bills and bonds.\n\nIn addition to this short-term debt, the Government has also prepared a new long-term debt on the RS capital market. It is about the issue of five-year bonds of 30 million KM, for which the Government of Srpska is ready to pay an interest rate of 5.8 percent. RS has so far issued 63 long-term bonds with a public offering of 2.65 billion marks[22].\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Council of Ministers was held hostage by the conflicting political goals of the parties from the Republic of Srpska entity and those from the Federation of BiH entity. The former observe every step, regardless of the substance, through the prism of the transfer of jurisdiction from the entity to the state, while the latter do not have that political weight. The FBiH is an economically more prosperous entity, but there, too, key reforms are still pending. Political problems were put on the back burner. In the RS, problems of an economic nature are visible, the entity continued to borrow. These are just the basic features of the intricate political labyrinth called Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n[1] Bosnia and Herzegovina Briefing: Political Summary 2022. https://china-cee.eu/2022/12/14/bosnia-herzegovina-political-briefing-bosnia-and-herzegovina-briefing-political-summary-2022/\n\n[2] Who are the new and old ministers in the BiH Council of Ministers? https://china-cee.eu/2023/02/21/bosnia-herzegovina-political-briefing-who-are-the-new-and-old-ministers-in-the-bih-council-of-ministers/\n\n[3] Activities of Minister Konaković: What MFA can really do? https://china-cee.eu/2023/07/24/bosnia-herzegovina-external-relations-briefing-activities-of-minister-konakovic-what-mfa-can-really-do/\n\n[4] Helez: I resolved the dispute with Nešić, they were not insults, it is a shame that he listens to Dodik. https://n1info.ba/vijesti/helez-rijesio-sam-spor-sa-nesicem-nisu-to-bile-uvrede-steta-je-sto-slusa-dodika/\n\n[5] BiH parliamentarians from the RS wrote to the US Congress: “ISIL sleeper cells” in BiH could be activated. https://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/parlamentarci-bih-iz-rs-a-pisali-kongresu-sad-a-spavacke-celije-isil-a-u-bih-mogle-bi-biti-aktivirane/231112063\n\n[6] By the way, we are talking about the opposition Party of Democratic Action, which, although it has the largest club in the Parliament of BiH and the Parliament of FBiH, does not form part of the majority.\n\n[7] Ibid.\n\n[8] Helez asked OSA for information on alleged ISIL and Al Qaeda parajames and cells.\n\nhttps://www.sdp.ba/helez-od-osa-e-zatrazio-informaciju-o-navodnim-paradzematima-i-celijama-isil-a-i-al-kaide/\n\n[9] Helez claims: There are paramilitary formations on the territory of the RS, they are led by some people from Russia Downloaded from: https://tuzlanski.ba/infoteka/helez-tvrdi-na-teritoriji-rs-postoje-paravojne-formacije-to-vode-neki-ljudi-iz-rusije/\n\n[10] OSA DENIED HELEZ : We have no information about the existence of military camps and paramilitary formations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. https://www.slobodna-bosna.ba/vijest/328561/osa_demantovala_heleza_nemamo_informaciju_o_postojanju_vojnih_kampova_i_paravojnih_formacija_u_bih.html\n\n[11] Nešić: Helez spreads fear and intolerance, the only paramilitaries in Bosnia and Herzegovina are the ones he threatens. https://www.dnevnik.ba/vijesti/nesic-helez-siri-strah-i-netrplejivost-jedine-paravojske-u-bih-su-one-kojima-on-prijeti-2658874#google_vignette\n\n[12] Decisions of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina published in 2023. https://www.vijeceministara.gov.ba/akti/odluke/default.aspx?id=39208&langTag=hr-HR\n\n[13] Decisions of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina published in 2022. https://www.vijeceministara.gov.ba/akti/odluke/default.aspx?id=37148&langTag=hr-HR\n\n[14] Decisions of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina published in 2021. https://www.vijeceministara.gov.ba/akti/odluke/default.aspx?id=34718&langTag=hr-HR\n\n[15] Decisions of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina published in 2020.\n\nhttps://www.vijeceministara.gov.ba/akti/odluke/default.aspx?id=31964&langTag=hr-HR\n\n[16] The House of Peoples of the FBiH Parliament adopted a set of reform energy laws. https://n1info.ba/vijesti/dom naroda-parlamenta-fbih-usvojio-set-reformskih-energetskih-zakona/\n\n[17] The FBiH government has prepared a set of fiscal laws: Do citizens have reason to celebrate?https://n1info.ba/vijesti/vlada-fbih-pripremila-set-fiskalnih-zakona-imaju-li-gradjani-razloga-za-slavlje/\n\n[18] The FBiH government is preparing a set of fiscal laws: The minimum wage will be 1,000 marks. https://avaz.ba/vijesti/bih/855866/vlada-fbih-priprema-set-fiskalnih-zakona-minimalna-placa-bit-ce-1-000-maraka\n\n[19] FBiH employer leader Adnan Smailbegović: Fiscal laws only in the spring. https://avaz.ba/vijesti/bih/867444/celnik-poslodavaca-fbih-adnan-smailbegovic-fiskalni-zakoni-tek-na-proljece\n\n[20] NSRS adopted a law that provides for the non-publication of decisions of the High Representative. https://detektor.ba/2023/06/22/nsrs-usvojila-zakon-kojim-se-predvidja-neobjavljivanje-odluka-visokog-predstavnika/\n\n[21] The EU demands that the Government of the RS withdraw the “law on foreign agents” without delay. https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/evropska-unija-vlada-rs-zakon-o-stranim-agentima/32603008.html\n\n[22] Two debts of the RS in just ten days: “We have a difficult year ahead of us”."
