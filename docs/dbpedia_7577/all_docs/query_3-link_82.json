        "text": "BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina — A potentially explosive referendum on independence will not be held in Bosnia-Herzegovina’s Serb Republic next year as its ruling party had proposed, President Milorad Dodik told POLITICO.\n\nBut Dodik described Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole as a “failing state” on a path to further fragmentation. He also criticized the European Union, which he said was “fading away,” and praised Russia and China for offering the Balkans friendship without attaching political conditions.\n\nMany politicians, diplomats and analysts believe an independence declaration by the Serb Republic would trigger a new conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and more violence elsewhere in the Balkans as other ethnic groups attempt to redraw national borders. International officials have repeatedly warned Serb Republic leaders against secession, making clear it would be regarded as illegal and would not be recognized by Western powers.\n\nThe Serb Republic, populated mainly by ethnic Serbs, is one of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s two autonomous regions, known as “entities,” established under the Dayton peace agreement that ended the 1992-1995 Bosnian war, in which 100,000 people died. The other region is the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is home mainly to Bosniak Muslims and Croats.\n\n“We won’t organize a referendum on secession in 2018” — Milorad Dodik, president of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s Serb Republic\n\nSome critics of the Dayton accord see the Serb Republic as the product of mass ethnic cleansing, while many Bosnian Serbs believe it preserves their rights and identity in a country that would otherwise be hostile to them.\n\n“We won’t organize a referendum on secession in 2018,” Dodik said in a plush reception room of the art deco presidency building in Banja Luka, the Serb Republic’s de facto capital. “We understand the circumstances, the context. A referendum in 2018 would cause many reactions, and we still want to build up the momentum to have it legitimized as our right.”\n\nDodik made clear, however, that he was not taking the prospect of secession off the table. “Whether some of the forthcoming years will raise that issue, we’ll see, I don’t know,” he said. “But I’m sure that we are following that path — the path to independence.”\n\nDodik has said on several occasions that the Serb Republic could declare independence, and last year his Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) adopted a policy of holding a referendum in 2018 if the entity was not granted greater autonomy. However, senior diplomats have said that secession would be unconstitutional and lead to Dodik’s removal by international officials, who still have significant powers in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nIn January, the United States imposed sanctions on Dodik, claiming that he “violated the rule of law and poses a significant risk of obstructing the implementation of the Dayton accords,” following a controversial referendum on marking the Serb Republic’s national day. That vote was seen by many as a dry run for a potential referendum on secession.\n\nStability challenges\n\nThe possibility of the Serb Republic seceding is one of several challenges to stability in the Balkans, along with continued disputes between Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian majority and Serb leaders in Belgrade, disputes over the rights of Albanians in Macedonia, and allegations of Russian attempts to foment trouble in Montenegro.\n\nDodik argues that the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina is artificial and failing — and that the country’s Serbs should have the same right to go their own way as the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, who declared independence in 2008. (Serbia, however, regards Kosovo as a rebel province. Bosnia-Herzegovina has also not recognized Kosovo, due to opposition from its Serb leaders.)\n\n“I’d like this to be part of Serbia, because this is a Serbian city, and it could be better” — Natalia Radić, 16-year-old student\n\n“Maybe there is no sense, no logic, to living in a state that has almost failed,” Dodik said. “Why is Bosnia and Herzegovina a guaranteed political category, why does it have to exist?”\n\nSerbs now make up around 33 percent of Bosnia’s population, according to the 2013 census, the first held since the end of the war, with most living in the Serb Republic.\n\nSurveys suggest that the majority of the entity’s population favors independence, which some see as a precursor to union with Serbia.\n\nBanja Luka already has the feel of the capital city of a small country, with public institutions lining boulevards, monuments to war dead in the parks, and the Serb Republic’s flag — similar in appearance to Serbia’s — widely on display. Bosnian national flags and symbols are far less common.\n\n“This [referendum] is something that needs to happen,” said Mladen Ignjatić, a 54-year-old driver who once lived in the U.K., as he strolled in the sunshine past the Serb Republic’s national theater, with its engravings of traditional instruments and pistols. “I’m overcome with emotion by this question. Without the Serb Republic, the Serbs aren’t able to survive. This place is a Serb place.”\n\nNatalia Radić, a 16-year-old student walking down the pedestrianized main street near the towering Orthodox cathedral — rebuilt after it was destroyed by Croatian fascists during World War II — voiced similar sentiments.\n\n“I’d like this to be part of Serbia, because this is a Serbian city, and it could be better,” she said, dismissing talk that changing borders could lead to war. “Anything could lead to war, the politicians are always seeking war.”\n\n‘Dangerous guy’\n\nBut for many, it is precisely the talk of secession that threatens renewed conflict. Senad Bratić, vice president of the Serb Republic’s parliament and a member of the opposition Bosniak Party of Democratic Action, said that a breakaway would inevitably lead to bloodshed.\n\n“The question about separating or joining Serbia should be followed by another question: Are you ready to pay the cost?” Bratić said in an interview in the parliament building. “You can only imagine how many deaths, injuries, lost lives there would be. Are you willing to pay that price? There is another side that will defend these borders.”\n\n“I don’t think Dodik has a real plan to go forward with a referendum” — Aleksandar Savanović, political scientist\n\nLike many critics of Dodik — and other politicians who rely heavily on appeals to ethnic identity — Bratić argues that the Serb Republic’s leaders use talk of independence to distract from grave economic problems. Bosnia has one of the world’s highest youth unemployment rates, at over 50 percent, while the average net wage is only about €440.\n\n“Certain politicians use subjects like this to influence people in a negative but effective way,” Bratić said.\n\nBratić said that he sees this effect fading, however, as citizens become aware of the hopelessness of nationalist politics, and says that he doubts a referendum on the Serb Republic’s status will ever be called.\n\nAleksandar Savanović, a political scientist and expert in secessionist movements at the University of Banja Luka, agreed that Dodik uses the threat of secession as a way to boost his popularity.\n\n“I don’t think Dodik has a real plan to go forward with a referendum,” said Savanović, who fought in the Serb army during the war and advises a senior member of the opposition Serb Democratic Party. “If there was a good economic situation here, I’m sure he wouldn’t use extreme nationalist rhetoric. But there is a risk — Dodik is a dangerous guy for all of us, not just Bosnia but all the Western Balkans.”\n\nHowever, Dodik insisted that a move toward independence would not lead to bloodshed in the region unless there is international intervention.\n\nHe was scathing about the international community’s role in the Balkans, particularly that of the Obama administration and the European Union. Dodik said it is uncertain whether the EU will survive, although he asserted that the Serb Republic still wishes to join the bloc “if it gets stabilized.”\n\n“The European Union is fading away,” he said. “The very fact that Britain is going out, that any elections are observed traumatically, it tells a lot about the whole story of the situation of the EU. And it shows that the EU image now is not the same as it was 10 years ago.”\n\nDodik said that, on the other hand, China’s influence is “much, much stronger — they are offering economic solutions without political interference.”\n\nDespite Western allegations that Moscow is stirring Serb separatism and using Dodik as a cat’s paw in the Balkans, the Serb Republic president asserted that he had never discussed secession with Vladimir Putin, focusing instead on economic development. But he contrasted Putin’s approach with that of the EU and past U.S. administrations.\n\n“They [Russia] haven’t asked anything from me, to do anything impossible. But when I go to Brussels, when I went to Washington previously, pressure was put on me and on many other politicians from here as well. So what’s natural? Is it natural that you go somewhere where you are welcome, or to go somewhere where the pressure is put on you?”\n\nAdvertisement"
