        "text": "Lt. Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr., who broke color barriers and shattered racial myths as the commander of the Tuskegee Airmen, the pioneering black fighter pilots of World War II, died on July 4. He was 89.\n\nHe died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, an Air Force spokesman said yesterday.\n\nGeneral Davis, son of the Army's first black general, Benjamin O. Davis Sr., was the first black cadet to graduate from West Point in the 20th century and one of the first black pilots in the military. His leadership of America's only all-black air units of World War II helped speed the integration of the Air Force, and in 1954 he became its first black general.\n\nLike his father, General Davis struggled against racism. He was ostracized at West Point and then was prevented from commanding white troops and turned away from segregated officers' clubs.\n\nThe airmen commanded by General Davis compiled an outstanding record in combat against the Luftwaffe in the European theater during World War II. They shot down 111 enemy planes and destroyed or damaged 273 on the ground at a cost of more than 70 pilots killed in action or missing. They never lost an American bomber to enemy fighters on their escort missions.\n\nAs the leader of dozens of missions, General Davis was highly decorated, receiving the Silver Star for a strafing run into Austria and the Distinguished Flying Cross for a bomber-escort mission to Munich.\n\nIn his autobiography, ''Benjamin O. Davis Jr.: American,'' General Davis told of the pressures that he and the fliers who came to be known as the Tuskegee Airmen encountered in the face of racism. ''We would go through any ordeal that came our way, be it in garrison existence or combat, to prove our worth,'' he said. ''Our airmen considered themselves pioneers in every sense of the word.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
