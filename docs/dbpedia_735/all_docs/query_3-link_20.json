        "text": "John C. Robinson, enrolled at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and got his degree in Mechanics at only eighteen years old (Brownlee, R.A 2012). When he returned a war hero from being the commander of the Ethiopian Air Force, he dreamed of having an aeronautical school at Tuskegee (Brownlee). However, out of pure luck Tuskegee was chosen to be a part of the Civilian Pilot Training Program, even though Robinson didn’t have a hand in this and he was teaching at Keesler and Chanute Air Fields during World War II (Brownlee). He laid the foundation and standards for who African American pilots were during World War II: well respected, and had excellent piloting and combat skills. Through his determination and\n\nIn a nation with a rich history of racism and inequality projected towards minority groups, many minorities were opposed to serving in any capacity during the Civil War. There were a few, however, that maintained an openness to the idea of aiding the Northern Union’s cause. Their willingness to fight for a shared dream, though, was not enough to put them on the frontlines. In fact, many willing African Americans were not permitted to join the ranks solely due to the color of their skin. This in and of itself was a discouraging reality for many African Americans of the time. The common question rang out: If they could not be accepted even as a soldier, how could they possibly be accepted as anything more later on? Advocate Alfred M. Green, however, had a different outlook. In short, Green decided that it was too soon to be giving up on the future. In his speech delivered to African Americans in Philadelphia, he hopes to inspire many to maintain their passion and join the Union forces. Primarily through emotional and logical appeal, Green constructs a persuasive case enticing many African Americans to continue fighting for the opportunity to join the Union army.\n\nWith the coming of World War II, African Americans were arguably elevated to a higher standing in society due to the total war effort. But what part would Presidential and Military action take in this advancement since their duty is to protect their citizens? And would the efforts from these offices triumph over the racial prejudice that ruled American society, and most importantly, would their legacy last for an improved quality of life for a good portion of the US population. With these questions in mind, Executive Orders No. 8802 and 9981 as well as President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s call for increased admission of African Americans in the Armed Forces alone did not create change in social perception of Black US citizens, at times highlighting barriers to social equality, but did sow the roots for economic opportunity and in turn gave\n\nWhen McGee began his career in the Air Force, African American’s were still seen as unequal to white Americans in every aspect. It wasn’t until July 2, 1964, that President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned discrimination based on race. Previous to this, the Jim Crow laws were used as justification for denying African Americans soldiers the opportunity to become pilots in the military. Once this changed, a new door opened for colored pilots causing many to stay in the military long after the war ended and turn it into a career, as McGee did. Although McGee’s career began due to WWII, it certainly did not end there. McGee went on to serve in Korea as well as Vietnam. By the time McGee retired from the Air Force on January 31, 1973 he had earned awards such as the Oak Leaf Cluster, and had six thousand- three hundred hours of flying fighter jets. He went on to become President of the Tuskegee Airmen, Incorporated for two presidencies. This is significant because McGee helped show the nation that African Americans are capable of being not only some of the best airmen out there, but also some of the best leaders. He never quit in the journey to better himself and helped pave the way for many African Americans who hold the dream to fly. In the long run, the color of one’s skin means\n\nThe 761st Tank Battalion was an independent tank battalion made up of African American enlisted Soldiers led by mostly Caucasian American officers. They were forbidden to serve alongside “white” Soldiers by federal law and the Army wouldn’t desegregate until after World War II. While American military leaders had reservations about using African American Soldiers in combat (MacGregor, 1981), when given the opportunity they displayed great heroism and combat ability because they wanted to show their love for their country and earn the respect of the American people, facing prejudices and racism from the highest levels of the military leadership; they fought not only against the enemies of the United States but against racism from both the American people and military members both at home and while stationed overseas.\n\nThe years of the 1950’s and 1960’s were a time of pride for the American people. Great accomplishments occurred in those twenty years, including Neil Armstrong’s space landing, women’s roles in were changing with feminist movement, and there were government efforts to ease discrimination against minorities. But America was not perfect in every aspect. Discrimination and racism against minorities survived throughout the civil rights movement, although there were major efforts to stop it. One accomplishment, documented by Melba Pattillo Beals, was made in 1957 following the 1954 Supreme Court case that began desegregating schools. In her memoir, Warriors Don't Cry, Beals explains the horrifying year she endured while integrating a white school,\n\nDespite having dealt with unwritten laws known as the, “Jim Crow” laws, many African American Soldiers still decided, without being drafted, to enlist in the military, only to be met with more segregation, separation and deference. Many of them worked in supporting roles in the service. One such supporting role was called the Service Force. George was one of those soldiers serving in the Service Force. George believes the Service Force was just as important as any other role in the military. He states, “I can work with a certain satisfaction that my work behind the ‘lines’ is the only direct support that the men ‘Up Front’ have.” I believe George had the hoped that when returning from the War, African Americans would have earned equality and respect from their fellow countrymen. In writing a letter to his sister, George states, “we hope that the American people won’t forget that if we can work and fight for the Democratic Way, that we are entitled to enjoy every privilege it affords when this mess is\n\nFrederick DOuglass Patterson, a veterinary scientist and the head of the college’s School of Agriculture took over presidency at Tuskegee Institute. Patterson urged African Americans at Tuskegee to seek greater opportunities in vocational education. He emphasized better education in trades and programmatic acceptance of racial segregation. He wanted blacks to have access to the technologically advanced, high-paying jobs and prepare them for careers as pilots. He bettered aviation mechanics, air traffic controllers, and flight instructors.”By the end of the war, 992 men had graduated from Negro Air Corps pilot training at Tuskegee; 450 were sent overseas for combat assignment. During the same period, about 150 lost their lives while in training or on combat flights, and 32 were held as POWs by the Nazis.”\n\nMilitary aviation was a critical part in the NAACP’s campaign. Many whites suggested that blacks lacked the aptitude for participation in the highly technical and prestigious air force. In response, the NAACP pointed out the numerous successful black students in the CPTP. Because of the pressure this campaign created, the Selective Service Act of 1940, which established the right for a national draft, was amended to prohibit racial restrictions on voluntary enlistments. This change gave the legal backing to a lawsuit made by the NAACP to force the admission of African Americans into the U.S. Army Air Corps. By late 1940, the War Department made plans to create one segregated flying unit. On January 16, 1941, the War Department took the next step and announced that the Air Corps would organize and train an all black unit which would later be designated as the 99th Fighter\n\nThe story of African American soldiers in the American Civil War is often a forgotten one. The history of the war is usually presented as white Northerners versus white Southerners as blacks waited on the sidelines as their fate was determined. This portrayal is highly inaccurate considering over 180,000 African American troops fought in the war and eventually obtained their own regiments under the United States Colored Troops as a part of the Union Army. Composed on May, 22, 1863, the USCT strengthened the Union Army’s numbers and contributed significantly to battles such as the Skirmish at Island Mound and Fort Wagner. Even with their contributions, African American soldiers are often overlooked in favor of other narratives. However, black historian George Washington Williams was one of the first to write the history of black troops today. His belief was that the history of black troops and their valor were a major contribution to American Civil War history. While controversial at the time, this view is not uncommon today and historians have continued to study the significance of black troops. Gregory J. W. Urwin and other historians recently wrote a critique on the treatment of black soldiers, acknowledging atrocities against them were committed often. Urwin tries to provide a honest history to the brutality of the black solider.\n\nMilitary until after WWII) was primarily composed of southerners, in which the ideas of slavery and segregation resonated throughout the ranks because of the old ideas of the confederates that occupied the south during the Civil War. This made it nearly impossible for black men to join the Airforce. In fact, in 1925 the Army War College conducted a study of black troops in World War I that concluded black men were mentally inferior compared to Whiteman and not capable of following orders and achieving victories in combat. However, in 1939 the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) attacked the military’s segregationist policies. In 1941 the NAACP turned to the court system to help fight the racist policy.\n\nThirdly, when the U.S. entered WWI in 1917, African Americans knew that even though they had freedom to serve in the military didn’t guarantee full participation in American society, thousands of African Americans answered the call by serving in the Army. On of the men that answered the call “was Dr. Louis Tompkins Wright the son man born into slavery, graduated from Harvard University in 1915 with high honors. In 1917, he was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the medical section of the U.S. Army Officers Reserves Corps. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel during World War I"
