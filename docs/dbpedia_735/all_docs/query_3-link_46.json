        "text": "THE LEADER TRUSTS FIRST Maj. Gen. Cameron Holt (ret., USAF), the immediate past the past Deputy Assistant Secretary of the US Air Force, has spent over three decades leading in the US military, instituting major changes and leaving a lasting impact. So, when he speaks, people learn. His most profound lesson? Trust is earned, not given. According to Holt, loyalty to your employer is owed, but trust must be earned through behavior. And who should initiate this trust? The leader. The leader should trust first. The results of Holt's philosophy were evident at a USAF conference where I had the privilege to give a keynote speech. Many hundreds of officers were attending. I talked to many of them. To the last man and woman, they would go through fire for him. Remember, trust is not something that can be demanded or commanded. It must be earned. As a leader, you need to take the first step in building trust with your team by expressing trust in them through word and action. Give them challenging tasks and don't micromanage how they accomplish it. Be there for advice and support. It will do wonders. #leadership #trust #teamwork If you enjoyed this, share it with others and follow me Jan-Benedict Steenkamp for more writing.\n\nWhen did you know what you wanted to do for your life’s work? Some people know when they’re a kid. That was the case for Jennifer Couture. After a field trip in the 7th grade to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, she knew she wanted to join the Navy. Jennifer didn’t know what she would do in the Navy, but she wanted to be like the sailors she met—smart, athletic, well-spoken, and confident. Fast forward to today, Rear Admiral Jennifer Couture is one of the top-ranking women in the U.S. military. She is the Commander of Carrier Strike Group ELEVEN, based in Everett, Washington. It’s a collection of ships and aircraft with thousands of sailors and marines that can deploy serious firepower at any time, anywhere in the world. Only four other women in the history of the Navy have had Carrier Strike Group command. The reason I wanted to have Rear Admiral Couture on the show is to learn what it takes to rise through the ranks of the military and find out exactly how military service turns everyday civilians into exceptional leaders. She’ll tell you the secret is in the name…service.

And a man I didn't know could even exist... appeared. And screamed at me with words on a page. To be better. Do better. Dream more. To drink his suffering and become a better person. The way he describes his upbringing made me tougher and more resilient. I am not a black American. But my God David Goggins screamed at me like I knew his pain. And the way he described his life? I was totally defenceless. Disarmed. How can anyone not be? Read Can't Hurt Me and try not to feel. It's not possible. That book breaks you down. Patience. Consistency. Discipline. When I think about what it takes to be great? At playing the violin, or studying until 5am at the library - or recording an album until everyone involved is falling asleep and one of us might crash the car on the way home. These are the three key ingredients. No mentor worth their salt is about breaking you down without building you right back up and turning you into an invincible war machine of a person. And that's what David Goggins does. I am glad to have met a few women who have learned David's message because I would like to think it's for everyone. The kind of patience David cultivates? Unbeatable. And, the very same patience all of my favourite artists have. From the Russian violinist David Oistrakh to Charlie Chaplin - to our era's reigning pop queen Taylor Alison Swift. Watch their patience. It is endless. Mine too. Consistency? Have you heard Larry David talk about his writing process for Seinfeld? He would literally RUN back to his office to make changes. Me too. After I heard that? Naturally. Why wouldn't I? He's my hero. Have you heard Jerry talk about how long it takes to craft his famously streamlined and perfectly conceived jokes? He is a social scientist; the most scientific comic of all time. His deconstructions of processes were the very basis for the inception of Seinfeld. At least, the very way he and Larry would deconstruct the ideas of items in a Korean supermarket in an amusing way. The nuts and bolts of things: amusing fact and theory and query by amusing fact and theory and query. How about Paul McCartney's recording process when he was in the Beatles? So gruelling it pissed off the other Beatles. Even John. No one in the Beatles cared as much as Paul about process. So? Incidentally, he was the first billionaire musician ever. Incidentally.... Discipline. Do you know who has energy for bullshit? Undisciplined people. Me when I'm undisciplined. You when you're undisciplined. Anyone. 'Idle hands' have the WORST reputation of any hands in all of human history. Why? Guess. Alcoholics need someone to scream and screech at. So do lazy people who expect wild and instant success. So do artists with no gumption. And accountants with no drive! But truly. You need discipline to practice, compose, record, release, tour, interview and repeat. Watch carefully. The most successful don't complain.\n\nTransition tip for veterans: Creating trust and confidence that opens doors requires time and patience. Stepping out on new walks of life are part of that journey. Business owners build customers one at a time. Leaders build trust one interaction at a time. Companies make bets on leaders based on confidence in aligned values and proven ability to deliver what matters to the company. How many advocates did it take to achieve O-5 command? Command delivers transformative experience. So does leading a business unit. They’re not the same, although they share common elements. Leading people is not the same as managing finance - and managing a command budget definitely isn’t the same as managing a capital project or program. Common threads - different goals, challenges and values. Think of your network as a way to build like-minded advocates - One at a time. Bigger roles require larger trust networks. In business, trust generally equates to capital responsibility and head count. Earning that trust happens one project and one mentor at a time. My observation: Don’t worry about the title. Focus on the opportunity to learn and grow. And: don’t overlook the chance to bet on yourself by starting your own company. The ultimate leadership experience requires no resume. Here’s a great way to contribute to some insightful research. I don’t align to the title but I do appreciate the intent. Misty Cook #dreambigger\n\nI love this!! I love his leadership post. Someone recently told me, multiple times, that I shouldn’t work so hard. Shouldn’t lead this group that needs me. He insisted I just need to take care of me and my pending transition. Let them take care of themselves he said. Another individual told me that I could just stay “high level”. Let them handle the day to day operations. You can just sign stuff. Stay “high level”. I don’t know where these two friends (of each other) developed THEIR definition of “high level” but my definition is that I am all in. I am theirs. My rank is there to break down barriers. My experience and knowledge is there to be shared. I will be transparent. I will have integrity. I will display personal courage and never worry that people will judge or punish me for standing up and doing what is right. I will set the example. I will mentor and develop the next generation. I will set my team and the individuals (regardless of rank, status, gender, race, religion, age) up for their success - which might be different than my version of success and that is OK. I DON’T need cookie cutter versions of me. I need to employ my people in accordance with their strengths and capabilities. Lead on."
