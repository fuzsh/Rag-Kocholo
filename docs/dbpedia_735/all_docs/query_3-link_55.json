The Stars and Stripes waved gaily from many housetops and most of the places of business closed their doors at noon and gave their clerks a half-day off. At the Presbyterian church union services were held in the morning by the Methodist, Baptists and Presbyterians. Rev. Dr. Hardwicke of the Baptist church delivering the Thanksgiving sermon. At the Episcopal interesting exercises were conducted by Rev. Dr. Clarke, the aged pastor. At noon the proverbial Thanksgiving turkey played an important part in the day’s programme by adorning many of festal board around which ______ at peace with all the world and thankful that they were able to provide a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner. In the afternoon the colored brass band paraded the streets and played a few national airs, and at night a delightful Thanksgiving dance was given at Market Hall. The dance was somewhat of an impromptu affair but for all that it was one of the most elegant and unique given in the city in a long time. Falvella’s Italian band furnished music for the occasion and at nine o’clock the grand march was formed. Mr. Thos. Smythe and his sister, Miss Gertrude, led the march and the new and varied evolutions performed by the participants gave to the march some delightfully pleasing features. The march ended in a dreamy waltz thorough which the dancers seemed to float in ecstatic delight, and this was followed by other dances which did not cease until the wee _____ began to roll around. The following is a list of the ladies present with the costumes they wore: Miss Katie Ricklefsen, an elegant evening toilet of white damask, patterned with narcissus blossoms, the trimming was of costly feathered bordering enriched with mother of pearl sequins; a feather ruche supported by plain white satin laid in irregular pleats, trimmed the lower edge of the skirt. Corded sarcenet ribbon around the bodice fell down the back in long loops and ends. Her hair was held by a magnificent diamond pin. Miss Selma Lichtenstein, a beautiful evening costume of cream mousseline-de-soie, trimmed with moiré satin-edge ribbon tied in Directories bows. The skirt was trimmed with chiffon headed with a row of crystal-bead passementerie. The neck was edged with festoon passementerie. This was considered one of the most elegant costumes in the ballroom. Miss Blanche Rivera, a very beautiful evening toilet of faneuce-blue crepe-de-Chine, with Persian trimming. Butterfly bows of white moiré ribbon and jewels. Miss Mittie Reynolds, a very pretty dress of pink silk, Henrietta, Empire style, garnished with pink moiré ribbon. Diamond ornaments. Miss Adelaide Lovenskiold, a costly toilette of black embroidered chiffon, en train, with red roses and diamonds. Miss Nellie Chapman, a beautiful evening dress of cream crepon, the Empire style décolleté, en train, with pearl ornaments. Miss Edna Halsey, a delicate costume of pink Gloria, which was a prefect picture of loveliness. Miss Josie Almond, an elegant black gauze with grey trimmings and diamonds. Mrs. Belle Skinner, a lovely costume of black and crimson gauze, red velvet, flower and diamond ornaments. Miss Tassie Spann, a lovely dress of cream atostross with white chiffon and Persian trimmings and pearls. Miss May Ward, a pretty costume cashmere with Watteau in back and chiffon trimmings.

News items, 1893\n\nMEMORIAL DAY\n\nFlags at Half-Mast and the Blue and the Grey Clasp Hands On Sunday morning the members of the Grand Army Post repaired to the Baptist church, where the Rev. J. B. Hardwicke had been selected to deliver the sermon that usually precedes the decoration exercises. It struck some as a little singular that a gentleman who wore the gray for four years in the Confederate Army was selected for this service. It was performed in a spirit of such candor and fairness as to call forth commendations from Confederates and Unionists who heard it. Tuesday morning the sound of martial music was heard on the streets. The ladies met at Market Hall and arranged the flowers: the members of the different orders and the Light Guards came. The ladies, girls and citizens, were in carriages and the men on foot. On arriving at the cemetery, the ladies and a corps of little girls proceeded to decorate the graves of the Confederate and Federal soldiers. The ________ the order were then gone through with, Major J. H. C. White, commanding. He then introduced Miss Ruth DeLacie, who made in a graceful and impressive manner a appropriate recitation. Then Col. Grass, the orator of the day. delivered the oration. Dr. Hardwicke followed with an appropriate address. He took the place of Miss Hardwicke, who was too much indisposed to recite in the strong wind that was blowing. The attendance was large and the order excellent. The Light Guard acted ___ some veterans moving in line for hours, and they fired the salute with great precision.\n\nSource: Corpus Christi Weekly Caller, June 2, 1893, p. 4, col. 5\n\nREV. J. B. HARDWICKE COMPLIMENTED\n\nThere was a called meeting for business held at the Baptist church Tuesday Night to close up the business of the pastoral year, which closed on the first. The Church wrote the Convention to retain its present pastor, Rev. J. B. Hardwicke, whose connection with this church has been of the most pleasant character and whose work has been progressing nicely. The church, during this past year, has had thirty one accessions and raised for all purposes $ 992. 65. This is a most gratifying showing and speaks well for the church.\n\nSource: Corpus Christi Weekly Caller, October 6, 1893, p. 5, col. 5\n\nResearch by: Msgr. Michael A. Howell\n\nTranscription by: Geraldine D. McGloin, Nueces County Historical Commission\n\n4. Biography by Linda Hardwicke\n\nThe Rev. Dr. John Benjamin Hardwicke was named after his grandfather Benjamin Hardwicke, a Baptist preacher who was born in Virginia, settled in mid-Tennessee, and died in the 1830s. His father was Samuel P. (Poindexter?) Hardwicke, who was born about 1816 and died in April, 1861. His mother was Lucy Hudson Flood, who was born in 1823 and died on May 13, 1862. Her father was Captain John Flood and her grandfather was Rev. Noah Flood, who died in Buckingham County, Virginia.\n\nRev. John B. Hardwicke was born August 9, 1830, in Buckingham County, Virginia. He was the oldest of 15 children. Only 6 were girls. Two boys died in infancy. All but 2 were Baptists. (His record shows his concern for the salvation of his brothers and sisters.) Names included William, Sarah, Joel, James, May, Martha, Lucy, Willie, Harriette, and Richard Edward. A full account of names, birthdates, and information on each is in the Hardwicke family Bible, a massive brown volume decorated in gold 9-1/2\" x 11\" and 3-12/\" thick. On the first page he wrote\n\n\"Family Bible\n\n\"Let this book remain in my family.\n\nJBH 1863\"\n\nThe information about his brothers and sisters was recorded in November 1869. From now on I will call him JBH.\n\nJBH became a member of the Baptist Church in 1842. The Baptist Encyclopedia, copyright 1880 and printed in Philadelphia in 1883, on page 496-7, says, \"At the age of twelve he made a profession of religion, and united with the Enon Baptist church. In 1852 he was ordained at the Enon church, in order that he might accept calls to two churches in Campbell Co., Va. He at once became prominent among the young preachers of the country. In 1853 he accepted a call to Greenfield, Va., where he remained for seven years. Here his special mission seems to have been to aid in rescuing the churches from the growing influence of anti-mission teachers.\"\n\nThe encyclopedia does not bother to refer to marriages or family; so at this point I need to add that JBH married Martha Jane Dews Holland. Her father was William Dews, who died March 8, 1836, at Hallifax, Virginia, and Nancy Ellington Dews, who died March 18, 1847, was her mother. Martha also a Baptist, was born in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, on April 20, 1820. She was the widow of Dr. William Holland and had already given birth to 3 children who died as infants. Martha had a gift for figures and study. She was a lovely lady, much sought after. The Rev. John Mason performed the marriage ceremony of JBH and Martha on November 6, 1855. In A Woman of Texas by Rebecca Richmond, it says \"Martha Dews was already a widow of twenty-five when she married the young clergyman. She had been stepmother to her first husband’s brood of four and had born him three children who had died.\" The 4 Holland children were raised in the Hardwicke home.\n\nJBH and Martha’s first son was Andrew Fuller Hardwicke, born August 3, 1856, at Riceville, Pittsylvania County, Virginia. Fuller was editor of the Atchison (Kansas) Globe newspaper when he died at 28, on March 4, 1885, \"an affectionate son, a brave and noble man...who was resigned to the will of God.\"\n\nA second child was born near Riceville – Samuel Poindexter Hardwicke – on October 18, 1858. Dexter was usually known as \"S.P.\" or \"Uncle Deck.\" He studied law in Bryan, Texas, went to Hillslboro, Texas, in 1881, and then went to Taylor County in the early days of her history; \"before Abilene was, he was a citizen of the county, residing at Buffalo Gap when the county seat was located there.\" In 1888 he married M. C. Deter of California. They bought a lot in Abilene in about 1890. He became a prominent trial lawyer and judge. (His partner was Judge Leggett.) the newspaper articles at his death on May 20, 1917, refer to him like this: \"One of the most brilliant and widely known lawyers of Texas,\" \"one of the greatest lawyers of Texas.\" \"Although many governors and others offered him high positions, Judge Hardwicke never accepted any of them, passing them on where possible to some rising friend. He could have held the highest positions within the gift of governors and people.\" \"Judge Hardwicke was destined to be the central figure at many another (democrat) convention, and always he won the admiration and respect of friend and foe alike for his cool, fearless, and brilliant generalship. (He was floor leader at several Democrat conventions.) To him more than to any other man belonged the credit for the making of more than one governor of this state.\" \"It was as a lawyer that he excelled. His mind was keen, analytical, penetrating, and his natural powers were enhanced by much reading and profound study.... It has been said of him many times that his mind was the greatest mind in Texas.\" S.P. is buried in the Masonic cemetery with his wife, his daughter M.C. Hardwicke Simmons, her husband Joe Simmons, S.P.’s son Deter, and another son Steele P., who died in infancy. Although Deter was married, he had no children. His gravestone says he was a Pvt. in the U.S. Marine Corps in World War I. He married several times. S. P.’s daughter, M.C., married later in the same year her father died. Her husband, Joe Shepherd Simmons, formerly of Memphis. He was in the hardware business, at first in Abilene and later in Tuscola, where he suffered a fatal heart attack. The few years in Tuscola was the next time M.C. lived away from the Hardwicke home at 1543 S. 3rd Street — until she finally went to a nursing home for the last years of her life. She also had no children. JBH would probably have been disappointed that his granddaughter M.C. was a member of the Episcopal church. She died while taking her afternoon nap on April 15, 1976.\n\nI want to finish the quote from the Baptist Encyclopedia about J.B. Hardwicke, D.D.: \"His next call was from Danville, which he declined, and after the call was repeated, he agreed to divide his time with them until they could secure a pastor. In 1860 he accepted a call to the Second church of Petersburg, and remained there until 1864. Now his time was divided between his church and the hospitals that were established in Petersburg during the war. His next field was Goldsborough, N.C., where he spent several years of successful labor. Afterwards he removed to Parkersburg, W. Va. Here he commenced the publication of the \"Baptist Record,\" which he edited for five years. His efforts here aided in uniting the Baptists of West Virginia in their support of one general organization, and in harmonizing churches that had been rent asunder by the civil war. In 1873 the College of West Virginia conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Divinity. The year following he accepted a call to Atchison, Kansas. He served there for 2 years and 9 months, was then called to Leavenworth, the largest city in the State. While in Kansas he was recording secretary, then president, and afterwards corresponding secretary of the State Convention. He was also a member of the board of directors, and a trustee of Ottawa University. He rendered valuable aid in freeing this school from financial embarrassments and difficulties that hindered its prosperity. At present Dr. Hardwicke lives at Bryan, Texas, and is pastor of a large and influential church. From early life he has been a regular contributor to various secular and religious periodicals, and he has published several sermons.\"\n\nAfter Bryan JBH served at Luling and Jefferson (or Jefferson and Luling) and then to Corpus Christi. (Jefferson was called \"the last outpost west of the Old South\" by Tom Holloway.) JBH was the third minister to serve at the Baptist Church in Corpus Christi. This church was originally located where the Federal Building is on Starr Street, just below the bluff. His house was on the hill above the church. Accounts of his pastorate in Corpus include the fact that many young people were drawn to the church and many references were made to the influence of this \"talented family.\" His ministry was only 3 years, because he died on September 3, 1895, age 64 years, 3 weeks, and 4 days. His son JBH II sent a Western Union Telegraph Co. telegram to S. P. in Abilene --\"Pa died this morning about three o’clock. Come immediately. John.\" He was buried in the old Bayview cemetery in Corpus. After this death, his wife Martha Dews Hardwicke lived with the Holloways in Dallas and the Pennybackers in Austin until her death in Dallas about 1912. She was known as \"Grandma Hardwicke,\" quite a lady. She is buried in Austin with Mrs. Anna Pennybacker.\n\nIn the summer of 1978 (June 18) the First Baptist Church in Corpus Christi honored JBH. (They were honoring various former pastors on various Sundays.) They said, \"He was emotionally a peacemaker. Though of an impulsive nature, he made it subservient to the will of Jesus Christ His Savious, who said, ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven, for they shall be called the children of God.’\" He had short pastorates because he went to churches in trouble to pour oil on troubled waters, according to Tom Holloway. Tom’s mother Sallie was age 25 at the time of JBH’s death in Corpus.\n\nJBH is described as a man more than 6' tall, an expert speaker and writer, well red, up on all topics and current events, holding important pastorates in Texas and other states. \"Ponderous sums him up – a big man, big in body, brain, heart, and life.\" \"His place in the ranks of Texas Baptists has never quite been filled.\" Someone said he looked like Ulysses S. Grant when he had his full moustache and beard. The picture I have of him shows him only with chops and moustache. This picture belonged to M. C. Hardwicke Simmons, and on the back she had written in handwriting very familiar to me, \"Grandfather Hardwicke.\" JBH III (Papa John) has a huge picture of JBH with a full beard. JBH described himself as \"minister and editor.\"\n\nNow going back to JBH’s third child, Anna McLaughlin Hardwicke, born at St. Petersburg, Va. on May 7, 1861. Because Virginia was the chief battleground of the Civil War, many families fled, and so did Martha and her children to Fayetteville, North Caroline. However, their troubles were not over, for raiders came in due time. They discovered the small supply of flour which Martha had hidden in a barrel, disguised as a dressing table. As they continued to rummage through things, they came upon Dr. Hardwicke’s masonic apron. One by one they left the home. \"After a time, a messenger was sent to offer a guard.... The guard was accordingly established in the home, and a young lieutenant called often to make sure that the family was protected.\" The lieutenant became good friends with Anna, telling her stories as she sat on his knee. \"One day, as she was fingering the buttons on his coat, she recognized that his uniform was not like her father’s.... Without warning she burst into inconsolable weeping. The perplexed lieutenant finally drew from her the almost inaudible wail, ‘Oh! You are a Yankee! Oh! You are a Yankee!\" \"Haven’t I been good to you, though?\" he asked. ‘Yes,’ came the sob, ‘but if you are a Yankee, you can’t go to heaven when you die!\" (From Mrs. Percy V. Pennybacker,\" by Helen Knox, published by Revell.\n\nAnna learned to read at 4. At Leavenworth she changed her name to Anna J. At Bryan she organized a private school. The next year she tried for a scholarship to the first Noarmal School for teachers at Huntsville. Here she had a teacher named PercyV. Pennybacker. Both then went to teach at Bryan Public School (new). She was 19. Mr. Pennybacker was principal. She then taught in Carthage, Mo. while he was studying in Europe a year. He became principal of the Tyler High School, and they married. He was a pioneer in the start of public schools and President of the State Teachers Association. They were both in the same church. Their first child was Lorine, born at Tyler in 1884. Probably this child did not live long. Other children were Percy, Jr., Bonner, and Ruth. In 1899 Percy Jr. died and in 1900 Anna and her 3 children moved to Austin. They had a big home on Whitis Avenue, two stories with windows on the third floor.\n\nAnna was a speaker, writer (she wrote Texas History), teacher, and club worker. She traveled to Europe, Canada, Chautauqua in New York, Boulder Chautauqua in Colorado; as president of the Texas Federation of Women’s Clubs she went all over Texas, and as president of the General Federal of Women’s Clubs, she traveled all over the country, including Alaska. Anna’s mother had been a Virginia belle of her day. Anna is described as dimpled and beautiful also. Charles Hardwicke commented that Aunt Anna advised the mothered her relatives in a round about but clever way. The two books written about Anna are Helen Knox book mentioned above and a Woman of Texas by Rebecca Richmond, printed by Naylor Co. in San Antonio in 1941. Anna Pennybacker was a personal friend of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt and had an overnight visit in the White House in 1933 or 1934. She also had Mrs. Roosevelt as a house guest in Austin and had all the family over to meet Mrs. Roosevelt. Even those who were not pro-Roosevelt had to admit Eleanor was very charming.\n\nAnna’s son, Percy Jr., married Mary Alice, who is still living in Austin. Percy was in the Engineering dept. of the University of Texas and designed highway bridges, including the big bridge over the ship channel at Corpus Christi. Business man Bonner married Lois. Ruth trained at Vassar. She is still in Austin also.\n\nNow going back to the Civil War, JBH in Petersburg, Va., joined the Confederate forces and worked as s chaplain in hospitals. About May, 1862, when JBH’s mother died, his youngest brother Richard Edward, about 7 years old, came to live in the JBH home.\n\nAlso in Petersburg a 4th child, Leola, was born Dec. 21, 1863, and died at 6-1/2 months. Martha moved on to Fayettesbille, N. C., where JBH joined his family after the Civil War ended in 1864.\n\nThe fifth child was John Benjamin Hardwicke, Jr., born Sept. 6, 1865, at Fayetteville. We will go into more detail on this branch of the family later.\n\nIn 1867 JBH went to Parkersburg, W. Va., to work as Secretary of the Baptist Mission Board of West Virginia. Here the 6th child, Martha Dews Hardwicke, was born on Sept. 22, 1868, and died 10 months later.\n\nAnother daughter was born at Parkersburg, W. Va., on Sept. 7, 1870; Sallie Holmes Hardwicke. She married Thomas Thornton Holloway, who was the son of West Point graduate Edmund B. Holloway. Edmund was in the U.S. Army in the Mexican War. Edmund’s wife’s father was General William Fitzhugh Thornton, who lived in Shelbyville, Illinois, 100 east of St. Louis. In later years Lincoln and Douglas were traveling, making speeches, and were entertained in homes by those who knew them politically. A game table on which Abraham Lincoln and Steven A. Douglas played is now in the home of Tom Holloway, Jr. Tom, Sr. was a prominent attorney, active in the Congregational church. Tom, Jr. became a Christian at about 10. While in college he decided to become a minister. He was ordained to the gospel ministry on May 7, 1933, at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, where he is still a member, along with his wife Sadie. Sadie’s parents were the Rev. and Mrs. Wesley Willingham Laughton, Baptist missionaries in China. Tom has worked with the American Bible Society for years and has lived at 4226 Bowser Street from the time it was the outskirts of Dallas --- and not it seems close to downtown. Tom and Sadie have two children. Sara Laughton married William E. (Bill) Horn, a Baptist minister at Kansas City, and they have a son named Nathan Everett. Tom III married Elaine and taught chemistry at William Jewell College in Missouri. Recently he accepted a position with the EPA in their Kansas City Office. Their address is 820 NE 73rd Place; Gladstone, Mo. 64118.\n\nSallie and Tom Holloway Sr. had a second child, a daughter named Sara Ruth. Ruth never married and lives at 1206 W. Ave. in Austin, Texas.\n\nMartha and JBH’s 8th and last child was listed in the family Bible as Able Sinnat, born on Jan. 16, 1873. Everyone writes his name as Sinnette. He worked as a lawyer in Abilene with his brother S. P. He married Mary Darden Bass of Sulphur Springs, on June 21, 1875, and both Charles Poindexter (born June 17, 1902) and Kathleen Bass Hardwicke (Nov. 30, 1903) were born in Abilene. After Sinnette’s first wife died in 1906, the children were taken care of by an aunt and uncle, housekeepers, and at one point M. C. Hardwicke moved to Dallas to take care of them. In 1914 Sinnette married Martha Minnie Lindsey of Elmo, Texas. She was known as \"Aunt Minnie,\" and painted a number of lovely pictures. Sinnette was an attorney in the legal department of the Magnolia Petroleum Co., later to become Mobil. The Magnolia Bldg. is still in Dallas at the corner of Acord and Commerce, with the Flying Red Horse on top.\n\nSinnette was a capable, well known lawyer. At one time when Sinnette went to Wshington to argue a case before the U. S. Supreme Court, he was city attorney of Dallas. It was his first trip to Washington. The case was to prohibit the operation of \"jitneys\" --- private cars operating as passenger conveyers on the Dallas streets and charging 5 cents per passenger. Sinnette won the case. He wrote home a letter on July 15, 1918, from the New Willard Hotel in Washington, D. C. Sinnette died Jan. 12, 1945.\n\nSinnette’s son Charles became a physician, a proctologist, working in Austin, Charles married Maurine Rutland on April 19, 1938. Their first daughter Ann, born January, 1932, married Dan Moody, son of Gov. Moody. The Moodys live in Austin with their children Martha and Charles. Dan is an attorney. Charles and Maurine’s second daughter Mary Kathleen married Dr. Courtney Townsend, Jr., who went back to the University of Texas Medical School in Galveston in 1978 to be on the surgery faculty. They have a daughter named Frances.\n\nSinnette’s daughter Kathleen married Finis E. Cowan of Dallas on Oct. 16, 1929. Later he was the vice president of the Continental Grain Co. until his death at age 61. Their daughter Alice was born Sept. 18, 1936. She married Dr. Paul Cochran, who works in Topeka, Kansas, at Menningers. Their children are Paul and Kathleen. Kathleen and Finis also had a son, Finis, Jr., who married Juliet \"Sis\" Delcambie of Louisiana. He was appointed a Federal judge to serve at Galveston but has since resigned and is a lawyer in the firm of Baker, Botts, etc. in Houston. They live in Dickinson. Their 6 children are Eleanor, who taught in Mesquite; Kathleen, a therapist in California; Virginia; Finis; Lionel, and another son, Tom.\n\nGoing back now to John B. Hardwicke Jr., who had been born Sept. 6, 1865, in Fayetteville, N. Carolina, and traveled with his parents at every move: West Virginia, Kansas, and then south through several towns in Texas to Corpus Christi. At his father’s death he was 30 years old and editor of the Texas Sun in Corpus Christi. He married Maude Wareham, daughter of Emma Jane Baker and F. P. Wareham. Maude was born in Indiana and grew up in Preston, Iowa. She had several brothers and sisters. At age 18 she came to Corpus to teach in a one room schoolhouse on Shell Road. This school is still there. \"Grandmuddie\" and JBH, Jr. had 3 children, John Benjamin Hardwicke III (\"Papa John\"), born May 7, 1897; Arlington Fuller, and a sister who died one day old. On her gravestone it says, \"A ministering spirit sent to thee, that where she is, there mayest though also be.\" When JBH Jr. died in 1906, John III was 9. On JBH Jr.’s gravestone it includes: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\" (Mt.5:8) Maude began to editor the Texas Sun. She married William H. Gerhardt, over 6’ and of a large frame. He was called \"Big Dadda\" or \"Uncle Biggy.\" He was in the produce business. John III then began working in the produce business, later starting his own, the John B. Hardwicke Co., working in the Corpus area, and in the 1950s moving to the Valley because the vegetable growing shifted to that area. He married Helen Cox, born July 1, 1902. She had one sister (now called \"Aunt Catherine\"). Her parents were Charles Edward Cox and Lucy Ashton Adams. Ed Cox was the only son of J. L. Cox and Emma Wilson, who was the daughter of a Dr. Wilson, who was the son of a Senator Wilson of Alabama.\n\n\"Papa John\" and Helen had 4 children. JBH IV, called \"Johnnie,\" was born Nov. 15, 1923, in Corpus, and married Jamee Bennett on Nov. 25, 1950, in Corpus. They now live in McAllen, Texas, at 121 Sunflower. Johnnie is part of the produce company and is producing a condominium complex called \"Waterwalk,\" of white homes with red tile roofs. His oldest daughter Catherine is the architect for Waterwalk. His son Jack (John B. Hardwicke V) is remodeling an apartment complex. The third child is Irene, an art major at the University of Texas.\n\nWilliam Arlington, the second son of Papa John, is calaled Bill. He was born on Nove. 24, 1925, and married L’Dell Bennett on June 5, 1948, in Corpus. He manages the farms in the McAllen area for the John B. Hardwicke Co.

The History of Jasper County, Missouri\n\nJohn Benjamin Hardwicke, D. D., the son of Samuel and Lucy Hudson (Flood) Hardwicke born in Buckingham county, Virginia, August 9, 1830. His grandfather was a Baptist minister and preacher for many years in Virginia and Tennessee. At the age of twelve, young John B. made a profession of religion and united with the Enon Baptist Church. In 1852 he was ordained at the Enon Church, in order that he might accept calls to two churches in Campbell county, Virginia. He at once became prominent among the young preachers of this part of Virginia. In 1853 he accepted a call to Greenvield, Pettsylvania county, Virginia, where he remained for seven years. Here his special mission seems to have been to aid in rescuing the churches from the blighting influence of anti-mission teachers.\n\nHe was married to Mrs. M. J. Holland of Halifax county, Virginia, November 6, 1855, and the names of their children are: A. Fuller now a prominent man and city clerk in Atchison, Kansas; S. P., a lawyer at Aberline, Texas; Anna J., a teacher in Carthage; John B., Jr. Sallie H. and A. Sennette. Two children died in infancy. The family is exceptionally well ordered, dutiful, talented, and harmonious. His next call was from Danville, which he declined, and after the call was repeated he agreed to divide his time with them until they could secure a pastor. In May 1860, he accepted a call to the Second Church of Petersburg, and remained there until April 1864. Here his time was divided between his church and the hospitals that were established in Petersburg during the war. His next pastorate was Goldsboro, North Carolina, where he spent several years of successful labor.\n\nAfterwards he removed to Parkersburg, West Virginia. Here he commenced the publication of the Baptist Record, which he edited for five years making for himself a wide reputation as writer and editor. His efforts as corresponding secretary of the general association here aided in uniting the Baptists of West Virginia in the support of one general organization, and in harmonizing churches that had been rent asunder by the civil war. In 1873 the college of West Virginia conferred upon him the degree of doctor of divinity. The year following he accepted a call to Atchison, Kansas. He served there for two years and nine months; was then called to Leavenworth, the largest city in the state. While in Kansas he was recording secretary, then president, and afterwards corresponding secretary of the State Convention; he was also a member of the board of directors, and trustee of Ottawa University; he rendered valuable aid in freeing this school from financial embarrassments and difficulties that had hindered its prosperity.\n\nIn 1878 he accepted a call to the pastorate of the church at Bryan, one of the most influential churches in the State of Texas, where he remained two years and six months, during which time 175 were added to the membership, 100 by baptism. One year was then spent at Waxahachie, where he put the Baptists on a good foundation. He accepted a call to the First Baptist Church of Carthage, Missouri, and June 1, 1882, entered upon his labors where he is still most successfully engaged. In less than a year there have been about eighty accessions to the church. He has quietly put into operation the latent forces of the city, and to use the language of a pastor of another church, he has his forces well in hand, they follow wherever he leads. The church is united, harmonious, active, and hopeful; the members have confidence in; his wisdom, and he has faith in his church, and their willingness to act when they find it their duty to do so. He is one of the pastors who accomplishes his ends through others, who rules without lording it over the church. He holds that, spiritually, intelligence, benevolence, and constant activity, are essential to the prosperity of a church, and he labors to secure these. Dr. Hardwicke prepares his sermons with great care, and delivers them in an easy natural manner. As a speaker on the platform he seems at ease and he uses the reserves of the debater with telling effect, and he draws his illustrations from all sources, with now and then a little satire. But it is in the social circle or the inquiry room, where men are to be found who need instruction, that it appears to the best advantage; his wide experience and practical judgment enable him to adapt the truth to all; he knows well their capacity for work, as well as their moral impotence to a given work.\n\nAn astute politician is said, if he would turn his attention to political affairs he could soon control the destinies of the state. This temptation has never induced him to turn away from the work of the ministry. The subject of this sketch is a regular contributor to the press. His printed sermons would fill a good sized volume. Their titles are: \"Life and Death,\" \"Turning aside from the truth,\" \"Support of the Ministry,\" \"The Providence of God Illustrated in the Story of the Dark Races,\" \"The Great Harvest,\" \"The Son of Life,\" \"A Sermon on Pastors,\" \"A Farewell Sermon for J. A. Taylor, D.D.,\" \"A Memorial Recourse on Rev. John D. Creathe,\" \"A Funeral Oration on President Garfield,\" \"What a Church has a right to expect of a Pastor,\" \"The Power of Beauty, or Esther the Beautiful Queen,\" \"A Plea from a Young Man before a Judge of the United States Court of Kansas, who had plead guilty to attempting to pass counterfeit money, etc.,\" \"Sketches of the Members of the Constitutional Convention of West Virginia,\" etc. This gentleman is still in the prime of life; time has dealt kindly with him; he has inherited a vigorous constitution, and a fame which commands attention. Dr. Hardwicke comes from a race of preachers. His great-grandfather, Noah Flood of Virginia, was a Baptist minister. By his mother he is related to the Floods of Kentucky, and the Fuquas and Brocks of Virginia, among whom are some of the most eminent ministers and lawyers of the country. Dr. Hardwicke has a brother, Rev. J. F. Hardwicke, who is an eminent minister and pastor of the Baptist Church at Bowling Green, Kentucky. He has been blessed in his own family. A. Fuller Hardwicke, Esq. Of Atchison, Kansas, is one of the most successful young business men of the city; he is a member of the city government and has been for five years. S. Pondexter, his second son, is a rising young lawyer with a good practice; he resides at Aberline, Texas. Miss Anna, his oldest daughter, is reported to be one of the best scholars of her years in the West. She graduated from two schools, taking the highest honors of her class in both institutions; she reads Latin, Greek, French, and German, and is an accomplished and popular teacher. John B., Jr., is in school; Sallie Holmes and A. Sennette, the youngest children, are at school also. All of the children except one are members of the Baptist Church. Mrs. Hardwicke is a lady of more than average ability; she is active, though quiet and unobtrusive in church work, a devoted mother who has given much of her time to laying the foundation of the education of her children. It must be a great gratification to these parents to observe the future that stretches away before their children, as well as to the children to look back upon those who have labored so assiduously to prepare them for the varied duties of life.\n\nSource:\n\nThe History of Jasper County, Missouri, including a condensed history of the State, a complete history of Carthage and Joplin, other towns and townships.

Harwicke\n\nDied suddenly this morning of heart failure\n\nJohn Benjamin Hardwicke, native of Fayetteville, N. C., age forty years, nine months, and eight days, who for twelve years has made his home in Corpus Christi, ____ most of the time in the newspaper business, ________ position on the Caller, which he held for a short time, and later conducting the Texas Sun, died at 7 o’clock this morning of heart failure. Capt. Thos. Allen, manager of the Natatorium, who was with Mr. Hardwicke at the time he met his death, makes the following the statement which explains the sad affair: “Mrs. Hardwicke and one of her children had just descending the chutes and Mr. Hardwicke wishing to give the little fellow a another ride, started to ascend the slide. I was following him closely, holding the slide up for them. When Mr. Hardwicke got within one step of the top of the tower he suddenly gave a groan and fell backward onto to me. I tried to hold him, but his weight dragged me with him down the steps. Mr. Hardwicke fell into the water, and I jumped in after him as soon as I could regain my feet. I raised his head out of the water as soon as possible, but I found that he was not breathing and was dead.� Speaking further, Capt. Allen says Mr. Hardwicke when he gave the groan and fell back on him, his death being due to heart failure. The Capt was himself slightly bruised by the fall. Deceased is survived by his wife, (nee Miss Maude Wareham) whom he married in this city some years ago, and two sons, John B., Jr., and Arlington, also his mother, two brothers, and two sister. The funeral took place yesterday at six o’clock from the Baptist church. The interment taking place in the old Bayview cemetery and the remains laid to rest by the side of those of his father. To the bereaved the Caller and others express sympathy in their sad hours.\n\nSource: Corpus Christi Weekly Caller, June 15, 1906, p. 1, col. 1\n\nMemorial\n\nJOHN B. HARDWICKE\n\nWhen the hand of Death touches a frail mortal, his icy fingers obliterate all thoughts and as we gaze on the marble brow of our dead, we often see virtues only dimly observed before. John Harwicke is dead, but the writer who knew, loved and respected him, views him as he was in life. With all his frailties, his innate nobility of soul and honestly of purpose would scorn a lying epitaph, and as his friend, we write no word of him dead, our heart did not feel for him when living. Of these frailties it is needless to tell the world, for his life was an open book, but only those who knew him as did the writer, know how he struggled and prayed for strength to resist the demon he knew was destroying him. A less brave soul would have long since given up the unequal struggle and thrown himself on the mercy One who looks with pitying eye on a weak mortal in the grasp of a foe to great for him to resist. John Hardwicke did not fear to meet his Maker. The Christian _______ him the Way and in the illness of the past few weeks, when he had full warning of the approach of death, who can doubt that the prayers of an aged mother and christian wife were answered, and they can look forward to a joyful reunion beyond the sky? The press of Texas had few abler members than John Harwicke. He was a __________ man and loved his profession with a zeal which, with his great ability, would have given him a high place in the journalistic world, under more favorable circumstances. To his aged mother who must soon join him, and the faithful wife who has so nobly stood by and cheered him in his every fortune, the Caller extends heartfelt sympathy. To his two almost infant boys, too young to realize their great loss, we would say, “Your father’s nature was a noble one- never in future life will you have cause to blush for the character of John B. Hardwicke.�\n\nSource: Corpus Christi Weekly Caller, June 15, 1906, p. 4, col. 5-6\n\nResearch by: Msgr. Michael A. Howell\n\nTranscription by: Geraldine D.
