        "text": "On March 19th, 1941 one of the great military units of World War II was born, when a small core of enlisted men came together at an Army Airfield in Illinois to form the 99th Pursuit Squadron.\n\nWhat made this group special was the fact that these Army men were African American, and became the first Black Combat pilots in US Military History. Though this group came from all parts of the US and beyond (five of the group had been pilots in the Haitian Air Force) -- they took their training in planes at Tuskegee Airfield at Tuskegee, Alabama, and took their course work at Tuskegee University -- hence their title of Tuskegee Airmen. The unit's impeccable record in combat, and their devotion to duty and country proved that they were as worthy as any to serve. It is safe to say that the success of this unit had a great deal to do with the later integration of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nThe Tuskegee Airmen formally made up the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bomber Group of the U.S. Army Air Corps. They included navigators, bombardiers, mechanics, instructors, crew chiefs, nurses, cooks and other support personnel for the pilots.\n\nAlthough the 477th Bomber group trained with the B-25 Mitchell bombers, they never did serve in combat during the war. The 332nd Fighter Group, on the other hand, was extremely busy during the war. Originally, as the 99th Pursuit Squadron, they became the first all-Black unit to be deployed overseas, to help drive the Germans and the Italians from North Africa.\n\nLater, in 1944, flying Curtiss P-40 Warhawk planes, they became one of four squadrons of the 332nd, in time for the European invasion, at Sicily, where they provided support of the big bombers on their missions in Southern Europe. It was during this time that they began to paint the tails of their planes red, a custom they continued when they switched to Bell P-39 Airacobras, later to the Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, and finally, to the aircraft, with which they are most commonly connected, the North American P-51 Mustangs, in July of 1944.\n\nTraining Black men to fly Army airplanes in 1941 did not happen without considerable controversy. Before the war many states, primarily in the South, still were subject to the Jim Crow laws, which mandated racial segregation in all public places. The Army was strictly segregated, and Black units served primarily as support units for white outfits, always with white officers. Blacks serving in the Army suffered prejudice both in the Army and outside.\n\nThe Tuskegee experiment received a huge shot in the arm in late March 1941, when 1st Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt made an inspection of the men and facilities at Tuskegee. She was impressed with both, and enthusiastic over the possibilities of such a unit. When she showed such interest, the Chief Instructor at the base, C. Alfred \"Chief\" Anderson offered to take her for a ride in one of the planes (a Piper J-3 Cub) they were using for training new pilots. She accepted the invitation, and for a half-hour she and Chief Anderson got a good look at that part of Alabama from the air. Afterwards, there was a minor explosion in the press over the 1st Lady's flight, but the net result was that the program got a badly needed bit of publicity.\n\nIn April, 1943 the 99th was finally accepted as ready for battle and was sent to North Africa as a part of the 33rd Fighter Group, just in time for the invasion of Sicily, in the Italian Campaign. In spite of its lack of combat experience, the 99th acquitted itself in subduing the island and for its participation in the battle received the Distinguished Unit Citation.\n\nBy the Spring of 1944 there enough more Tuskegee graduates to form three more fighter squadrons, and they joined the 99th on the Adriatic Coast in Italy, to form the 332nd Fighter Group, under Colonel Davis. From this base the 332nd escorted the Fifteenth Air Force strategic air raids deep into Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Poland and Germany. For their work of flying escort for these heavy bombing raids the 332nd earned high praise for their combat record. They became known as the \"Red-tail Angels\" -- recognizing the distinctive red tail decoration of their planes.\n\nThe first Tuskegee Airman to receive his wings was one Benjamin O. Davis, who later became the commander of the 99th Fighter Squadron. Col. Davis emerged from WW II as one of the true heroes of that conflict. He was the son of Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. who was destined to become the first American of African American descent to become a General officer in the U.S. Army, but Ben Jr.'s path through the military ranks was difficult, with a great deal of racial discrimination along the way.\n\nAfter attending the University of Chicago in the 1930s Davis received an appointment to the US. Military Academy, one of the first African Americans to do so. The Corps did not receive him well. He never did have a roommate at the Academy, and suffered through long periods of silent treatment from the other cadets. However, if that treatment was meant to cause him to resign, it did just the opposite and actually strengthened his resolve to become an Army Aviator. Gradually he earned the respect of his fellow cadets, as evidenced by the short (glowing) biographical sketch beneath his picture in the 1936 school yearbook, the Howitzer.\n\nUpon graduation flight training was denied him, so he embarked upon a career as an officer in the Infantry. After several posts in the Infantry, Davis found himself as an officer/teacher at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. When President Roosevelt bowed to pressures calling for a greater participation of Blacks in the military and set up the Tuskegee Airmen, Davis jumped at the chance to get in on that program.\n\nHe became the first black officer, at Tuskegee, to fly a US military plane, and was the first Tuskegee Airman to receive his wings. He was appointed to head up the 99th Fighter Squadron, and the later, larger African American unit, the 322nd when that group was assigned to North Africa.\n\nCol. Davis was not a \"desk commander,\" and participated in numerous raids in North Africa, Italy and later into the heart of Europe, flying P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs -- probably a greater participation than his superiors in Washington would have wished. Davis was awarded the Silver Star for a mission in Austria, and the Distinguished Flying Cross for a bomber escort mission to Munich, Ger. in June 1944.\n\nAfter the war Davis, as commander of various African American air units, kept going up the promotion ladder, eventually becoming the first Black officer to hold the rank of General in the U.S. Air Force. President Truman used him as the front person and spokesman for his plan to eventually totally integrate all the US Armed Forces.\n\nThe wartime accomplishments of the Tuskegee Airmen show an impressive record, ie:\n\nThere were a total of 992 pilots who received their training at Tuskegee during World War II.\n\n84 of the Tuskegee Airmen lost their lives in combat or in accidents.\n\n32 of the men were captured as Prisoners of War.\n\nThey flew 1,578 combat missions, including 179 bomber escort missions.\n\nThey destroyed 408 enemy aircraft either in the air or on the ground.\n\nThey destroyed or put out of action 950 rail cars, trucks and other vehicles.\n\nThey put one destroyer out of action, plus destroying another 40 boats and barges.\n\nStill, as impressive as the military record and wartime exploits of the Tuskegee Airmen were, it was probably the fact that they paved the way for the integration of all of the US Armed Forces that serves as their greatest accomplishment.\n\nFor that proud example, we can all take great comfort.\n\nSource: Black Heroes of WW II; History of the Tuskegee Airmen \\(Britannica)"
