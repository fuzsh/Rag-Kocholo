        "text": "The Iberian Peninsula was not naturally (and is not) one political entity, therefore modern Spain was by no means \"reunited and reconquered\".

In fact there was a large rebellion in Catalonia against rule from Madrid (whith did not exist aroud 1500) as late as 1640, and the assemblies of Catalonia, Valencia, and Aragon (the crown of Aragon was a \"triple crown\") kept many of their powers their powers (most importantly over taxes and finances) until their dissolution in 1714. Administration was separate for Castile and for Aragon - all administration: laws, tribunals, taxes, coinage, customs, even participation in overseas colonialism (activity in the american colonies was reserved for citizens of Castile only).\n\nThe assemblies of the Kingdom of Aragon even managed to block the inquisition for a few years, aware that was the tool the \"catholic\" kings had devised to exercise their power over all their holdings.

Only the assemblies (cortes/corts) endured, and these could be eventually pressured into compliance with the crown's wishes. The Inquisition was instrumental to achieve all this. The way they went about doing this in interesting, as the monarchs had little power against the array of opponents they started with. The greatest challenge to the power of the monarchs came from the church. The military-religious orders were a state within the state. The church itself was the biggest landholder, and richer than the crown. Any frontal attack against this was doomed to failure. So they attacked the church in the one place were it was vulnerable: outside the Iberian Peninsula, in Rome. The popes of the time were concerned, above all, with their petty italian wars, and control over central Italy. Aragon held southern Italy and could provide critical support (or totally undermine) the pope in Italy. So they extracted directly from the pope concessions that allowed the monarchs to appoint many of the top figures of the church in their kingdoms (and all appointments in the new world). They got the pope to grant the crown a large part of the recipes of the church. But their master stroke was forcing the pope to place the local inquisition under the sole authority of the crown. The church would exercise no control whatsoever over the inquisition. The inquisition could strike at any person, regardless of status (Torquemada, the first chief inquisitor of Castile, took the opportunity to attack his personal enemy, Pedro de Aranda, bishop of Calahorra) and kept all of the most important nobles in the kingdom under (conspicuous) surveillance. Thus it is not strange that they dared not show active resistance against the centralizing policies of the crown that gradually stripped their ancient privileges.\n\nAs for Ferdinand being a converso, there are allegations that his grandmother (officially, Mariana Ayala de Córdoba) was one. I dont think there is any proof, and the genealogical trees (might have been forged) do not lead to believe the allegations.\n\nStill, he should have given that fanatical ***** of his wife a good beating and followed the previous policy of protecting the religious minorities. But he knew very well how useful the Inquisition was, and she was the queen of Castille\n\nWow biased vision of history if i have ever seen any.

And Catalonia was not a kingdom, but a county. Some historians call it one of three crowns (based on the fact that there was one assembly for Catalonia, one for Valencia, and one for Aragon), others speak only of two (the kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia).\n\nThe capital of medieval kingdoms was wherever the king decided to seat his court. A few cities housed the royal court for some time. In Castile they might be Seville, Granada or Toledo (perhaps even more cities).\n\nThorgalaeg said:\n\nWrong. Castles and taxes in both kingdoms were all under Isabel´s authority.\n\nSorry, youre wrong. Check your facts. In fact Isabella didnt even ruled Castile to start with, she first had to fight a civil war to get rid of the rightful heir to the throne. Castles she eventually brought under her authority. But not the taxes in Aragon.\n\nThorgalaeg said:\n\n\"Exercise of terror\", too theatral for my taste. Logically Catholic Kings want to elminate oposition in all HIS territories.

OTOH it seems that political power for the church and \"ancient privileges\" (aka feudalism) are cool for you.\n\nI did not intend to pass judgement on those at all. Only giving a brief explanation about the clever way the catholic kings placed their combined kingdoms under centralized rule. Of course the Inquisition was only part of what they did, but they used it brilliantly. Isabella started out as a weak queen taking over a country that had come out of a short civil war, and owing her throne to the nobles.\n\nNo, I'm currently sitting within that large chunk of the Iberian Peninsula that managed to kick out the spanish king in 1640 and remain independent. I know the spanish sometimes forget we exist, but 10 million people here tend to disagree with you.\n\nAhhh. I see now. That explains it all.\n\nNo, there were 3 provinces in roman times. And in visigothic times there were two kingdoms (Suevi and Visigoth) for a long time.\n\nNope one province divided later by Augusto into three subterritories. Hispania Ulterior Baetica, Hispania Citerior Tarraconensis e Hispania Ulterior Lusitania. Later they even added the Mauritania Tingitana to the diocese of Hispania. It is not very important however, but i know that you need to identify Portugal with Lusitania, which is really delusional at best.\n\nHispania was a geographical reference, up to the time when a single monarch managed to rule all Iberian kingdoms and used the term to create the idea of an ancient realm encompassing the whole penninsula.\n\nWe're still spoiling that plan, aren't we?\n\nDont feel so threatened by Spain. Most people here think that Portugal would be an economical charge for Spain and the last thing we need.\n\nSorry, you&#8217;re wrong. Check your facts. In fact Isabella didn&#8217;t even ruled Castile to start with, she first had to fight a civil war to get rid of the rightful heir to the throne. Castles she eventually brought under her authority. But not the taxes in Aragon.\n\nYep. It was stablished in the concordia de Segovia in 1475.\n\nJust pointing out that Aragon was independent enough, even from its own monarch, to successfully resist for a few years the introduction of the Inquisition.\n\nAgain, i think that nobles being independient of the monarch is not a good thing.\n\n@Thorgalaeg:\n\nit was the county of Catalonia, hence \"la Ciudad Condal\".\n\ninnonimatu is right: it was only during the Bourbons that Spain became officially one united kingdom. Before that, Olivares made some attempts at suppressing the independences of Aragon and Portugal, and it contributed to the portuguese and catalan revolts of 1640. For example, in the second part of the Quijote, when he travels to Barcelona, there are several hints and references to the different general customs and organization between the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon. I think Cervantes even comments explicitly about each one's nobility and social differences during Quijote and Sancho's stay in the in the castle of the dukes or thereabouts. Also, when Isabella died, some people have said that Ferdinand seemed to have favoured getting a new heir for Aragon, independent of the future inheritance of Charles V, but it was prevented by his own death.\n\nBtw, I don't see much point in that political vs. geographic discussion: until the modern age there isn't much point in discussing political institutions in the sense we do today: for many centuries, no one had any doubts about the cultural or geographic unity of the italians or germans, yet they were fierce political rivals and enemies among themselves. The unified state as a political expression of a nation or a geographic land is relatively recent historically, at least in a mainstream interpretation. Besides, despite the centralizations of the absolutist powers, feudal notions of political and geographical relations weren't fully suppressed until the liberal revolutions. Therefore, we can't really interpret what was happening centuries ago with our own referentials. For example, the early norman kings of England were kings of a major european power, but at the same time they were dukes of normandy. As kings they were at the same level vis-a-vis with the kings of France, but as dukes, they were vassals of the same king of France. Also, during the 100 Years War, the kings of England held large lands in France, but those lands weren't a part of the kingdom of England, but of the kingdom of France. That's why, even today, Guernsey or the Isle of Man are a part of the inherited lands of the kings of England, but don't belong to England. In fact, they aren't even a part of the UK, therefore aren't EU members.\n\nAll this to say, that despite the obvious existence of a geographic and cultural unit called Spain, the whole of Iberia, that doesn't mean that at the time, such thing was the preamble for a process of political unification. In the medieval and early modern feudal world that made little sense. I.e., Portugal was a part of Spain, followed the spanish customs, but that didn't mean any unification outside the personal unions that every iberian king dreamed of. In fact, during the middle ages, I think that the navarrese kings were twice kings of all the christian kingdoms, but contrarily to the spanish custom, they followed the frank inspired custom of dividing the realm among their sons.\n\nThorgalaeg said:\n\nAgain, i think that nobles being independient of the monarch is not a good thing.\n\nOn the contrary. It would have been a very good thing for us later on, if the nobles had remained strong and independent towards the ruler during the Middle Ages. That was the reason why in England the Magna Carta was signed, and the liberal parliamentary tradition was born, in sharp contrast with the absolutist ways that derived from centralised unopposed royal rule and later dictatorships inspired in that tradition that we have experienced ad nauseam in this part of Europe..."
