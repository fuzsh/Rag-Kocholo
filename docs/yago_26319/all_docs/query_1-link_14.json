        "text": "The Catholic Monarchs, or Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon are the most significant rulers of Iberia. Their marriage and joint rule marked the de facto creation of Spain. Both of them were of the House of Trast√°mara, as they were actually second cousins. To over summarize, during their joint rule, the last Moorish stronghold, the Emirate of Granada fell, the Discovery of the Americas happened under their patronage, and the Spanish Inquisition was established. After their deaths respectively in 1504 (Isabella) and 1516 (Ferdinand), their daughter Joanna would technically become Queen, but it was her husband and later and more signifgant her son, Charles I (Also Charles V) who would rule, establishing Habsburg Spain\n\nBut what if, these two significant rulers of Spain, who ruled as equals... had their genders reversed? This means Isabella (Lets call her John for now, since she had a brothers named Henry and Alfonso) would be the male and Ferdinand (Lets call Maria for now, since he had sisters named Blanche, Eleanor, and Joanna) would be the female.\n\nHow would switching these two genders butterfly effect things, like succession to their respective thrones, or their marriage prospects? Would they even be king or queen? OTL, Isabella had fight for the Castilian throne. Would this Male!Isabella and Female!Ferdinand even marry like OTL?\n\nHow would switching these two genders butterfly effect things, like succession to their respective thrones, or their marriage prospects?

He would be heir presumptive for his brother Henry. I could see Juan marrying either Maria of Aragon or possible Joanna of Portugal if she would consent to the match."
