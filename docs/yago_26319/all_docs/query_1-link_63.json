Ferdinand of Argon, son of John II of Argon, rose to power through his marriage to Isabella of Castille. Isabella of Castille was the daughter of King John I, of Castille. After King John I died, her older brother was the next heir I'm line, King Henry IV. When King Henry IV was seen unfit to rule by nobles, he was pushed aside to let his younger half-brother Alfonso take the throne. Fortunately, at least for Isabella, Alfonso soon after died of the plague, and had named her his successor in his will. This king and queen brought together their people firstly by completing the Reconquista, the expulsion of people practicing Muslim and Judism, to unify their nation under the religion of Roman Cathlioc. Although this couple's greatest achievement was their funding towards Christopher Columbus who ultimately found the New World. Through this, and their \"claim\" of it, Spain grew prostperous through the collection and mineing of silver and gold.

There were no beds or hammocks, so men slept on the hard floor boards. Sleep was still a luxury though because men had to keep watch in the night. Although these watchmen helped to avoid obstacles while sailing through the Magellan Strait, a lack of sleep was an unhealthy trade for success. Through all of the physical strain, the sailors could not even nourish their bodies, their primary food being hardtack. That mixture of flour and water supplied no nutrients but tricked the men into feeling full. In one account, Antonio Pigafetta describes the conditions of the voyage. He explains of a time in which the crew was in the Pacific Ocean for over three months with\n\nThe Conquest Of New Spain Sparknotes\n\n1040 Words | 3 Pages\n\n“The Conquest of New Spain” is the first hand account of Bernal Diaz (translated by J.M. Cohen) who writes about his personal accounts of the conquest of Mexico by himself and other conquistadors beginning in 1517. Unlike other authors who wrote about their first hand accounts, Diaz offers a more positive outlook of the conquest and the conquistadors motives as they moved through mainland Mexico. The beginning chapters go into detail about the expeditions of some Spanish conquistadors such as Francisco Hernandez de Cordoba, Juan de Grijalva and Hernando Cotes. This book, though, focuses mainly on Diaz’s travels with Hernando Cortes. Bernal Diaz’s uses the idea of the “Just War Theory” as his argument for why the conquests were justifiable\n\nChristopher Columbus Voyage Essay\n\n930 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe Reconquista is what began the way for Christian kingdoms to expand. Christians across Europe united to help the Spaniards win the territory from the Muslims. Once the Reconquista had ended, it led to the power that the Spanish military then had. The Reconquista had a major part in changing the way the Spaniards thought. Anyone who rejected Christianity to the men who fought in the Reconquista who felt that they were in higher power became enslaved to them. Muslims and Jews had no other choice but to convert to Christianity once Spain gained back their authority. This is mainly what drew the Spaniards to be so devoted to converting people to Christianity.\n\nThe Conquest of New Spain\n\n904 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe Conquest of New Spain Cortés came not to the New World to conquer by force, but by manipulation. Bernal Daz del Castillo, in the \"Conquest of New Spain,\" describes how Cortés and his soldiers manipulated the Aztec people and their king Montezuma from the time they traveled from Iztapalaopa to the time when Montezuma took Cortés to the top of the great Cue and showed him the whole of Mexico and its countryside, and the three causeways which led into Mexico. Castillo's purpose for recording the mission was to keep an account of the wealth of Montezuma and Mexico, the traditions, and the economic potential that could benefit Cortés' upcoming conquest. However, through these recordings, we are able to see and understand Cortés' strategy in making Mexico \"New Spain.\" He came as a wolf in sheep's clothing and manipulated Montezuma through his apparent innocence.\n\nCompare And Contrast The Spanish And Ottoman Empires\n\n903 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe Ottomans and Spanish built flourishing empires based on different philosophies from 1450 to 1800. The Ottoman and Spanish were two powerful empires during that time. During the building of the two empires, the Spanish and the Ottoman both developed similarities in their social, political, and economic structures. The Ottoman took control of Europe, while the Spanish saw it as easy to monitor new lands. The different tactics employed made the both empires flourish. For instance, the Spanish were not tolerant of religion. They conquered other areas with the aim of converting Christians to Islam, if they refused, they would be killed. On the other hand, the Ottoman leaders incorporated leaders of diverse culture\n\nAnalysis Of Victor And Vanquished\n\n1086 Words | 3 Pages\n\nFrom 711-1492, Christian Spaniards lived under Moorish rule until eventually, the Christian Kingdoms took over during the Reconquista. The conflicts between the Muslims and Christians created a militaristic culture in Spain that surpassed that of any other European nation. Furthermore, being trained militarily was often exclusively attributed to the nobility however, in Spain, “many young men knew these skills and used them to their advantage.” Without a doubt, recently reconquering their homeland motivated the Spanish to a basis for expansion and conquest that most other European societies were lacking. In addition, the voyages of Christopher Columbus led to discovering the New World which undoubtedly contributed to added interest in conquest. Eventually, each conquest further raised Spanish hopes for fame and"
