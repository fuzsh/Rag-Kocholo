        "text": "In 1482, Isabella the Catholic gave birth to twin girls, Maria of Aragon and another girl who was stillborn. My query is this, let's say that the twin girl is actually a boy named Ferdinand after his father, and the boy is relatively healthy and lives into adulthood. If Juan, Prince of Asturias still dies in 1497, would Ferdinand junior marry Margaret of Austria in a mirror of Henry and Arthur to Catherine of Aragon, or would another marriage be sought for him? Consequently, regardless of the marriage, one imagines the presence of Ferdinand eases the worries of the Catholic monarchs once Juan is dead, for they've got another son to inherit their domains. Thus one imagines Ferdinand V does not remarry when his wife dies, thus leaving Germaine of Foix free to marry whoever she wishes. Ferdinand's existence also means the Habsburgs remain in the EMpire and the Low Countries rather than in Spain, thus freeing Spain from all those pesky entanglements.\n\nAre there any other consequences that could emerge?\n\n@Kellan Sullivan @The Professor @krieger @isabella @BlueFlowwer @Tyler96 @Zulfurium\n\nI think that Ferdinand and Margaret are a good match, there are a lack of eligble ladies for him otherwise.\n\nFerdinand VI of Castile and III of Aragon b 1482 d 1526 m 1)Margaret of Austria b 1480 d 1509, 2)Marguerite of France b 1492 d 1449\n\nIssue:\n\nInfanta Isabella of Spain b 1503\n\nInfanta Maria of Spain b 1505\n\nAlfonso, prince of Asturias b 1507 d 1509\n\nStillborn son b 1509\n\nJuan III of Spain b 1512\n\nInfante Ferdinand b 1513\n\nInfanta Margaret b 1515\n\nInfante Miguel b 1518\n\nSounds good to me, it would also probably ensure that relations between Spain and Burgundy aren't as bad as they were when Phil was trying to get into Castile otl\n\nI much better Hapsburg empire and Burgundy and a better Spain. I went with Marguerite for the mother of Ferdinand's male heirs, to get some fresh blood into the Trastamara line.\n\nSeems fair to me, so, Ferdinand would take the reins of Castile in 1504 when his mother dies, and then in Aragon in 1516 when his old man dies. That's going to be fascinating to see.\n\nI think Milan would be a bigger interest for France and Naples. But with the HRE and the Iberian Peninsula separated I think that Spain can focus on the Barbary pirates, the oversea colonies and Naples in a much bigger scope. Ergo, why I had Margurite as Ferdinand's second wife as well. Peace treaty with France.\n\nThis is very true, could definitely see the Empire and France fighting over MIlan and whether it should be an imperial fief or not.\n\nYeah. I kind of think that in the first decade when Ferdinand rules Castile he supports the HRE in Milan and at the same time consolidates power in Naples. Then in 1510 when Margaret has died he decides to stay away from Milan since he is tired of the whole thing. Naples is ruled peacefully by Spain, he marries Marguerite as part of a peace deal and a second chance of a son for the throne. Spain is out and he can focus on more domestic things and gets the infantes he desired.\n\nYeah.

Katherine of Aragon and Henry VIII were allowed to marry because her marriage to Arthur was never consummated, thus he was never really her husband (sorry, Church of England fans). Cannon law is very strict on it's interpretation on marrying your brother's wife: if they slept together, it's a big no-no. That's why it was Henry VII's argument for an annulment when he was trying to get the Pope to annul his marriage to Katherine. The only way it could work for Margaret and Ferdinand 2.0 is moving up Juan's death or delaying his marriage to Margaret so they never consummate the marriage."
