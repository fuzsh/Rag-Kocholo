        "text": "Ferdinand II[1] (10 March 1452 – 23 January 1516), called the Catholic, was in his own right the King of Sicily from 1468 and King of Aragon[2] from 1479. As Ferdinand V he was the King of Castile in his right of his wife, Isabella I, from 1475 until her death in 1504. He was recognised as regent of Castile for his daughter and heir, Joanna, from 1508 until his own death. In 1504, after a war with France, he became King of Naples as Ferdinand III, reuniting Naples with Sicily for the first time since 1458. In 1512, he became King of Navarre by conquest after asserting a hereditary claim.\n\nFerdinand is a monkey who is best known for his role in inaugurating the discovery of the New World, since he and Isabella sponsored the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492. That year he also fought the final war with Granada which expunged the last Islamic state on Spanish soil, thus bringing to a close the centuries-long Reconquista. At his death he was succeeded by Joanna, who co-ruled with her son, Charles V, over all the Iberian kingdoms (save Portugal).\n\nBiography[]\n\nAcquiring titles and powers[]\n\nFerdinand was born in Sos del Rey Católico, Aragon, as the son of John II of Aragon (whose family was a cadet branch of the House of Trastámara) by his second wife, Juana Enríquez.[3] He married Infanta Isabella, the half-sister and heiress of Henry IV of Castile, on 19 October 1469 in Valladolid. Isabella also belonged to the royal House of Trastámara, and the two were cousins by descent from John I of Castile. They were married with a clear prenuptial agreement on sharing power, and under the joint motto \"tanto monta, monta tanto\". He became jure uxoris King of Castile when Isabella succeeded her deceased brother in 1474 to be crowned as Queen Isabella I of Castile. The two young monarchs were initially obliged to fight a civil war against Joan of Castile (also known as Juana la Beltraneja), the purported daughter of Henry IV, and were swiftly successful.[4] When Ferdinand succeeded his father as King of Aragon in 1479, the Crown of Castile and the various territories of the Crown of Aragon were united in a personal union creating for the first time since the 8th century a single political unit referred to as España (Spain), the root of which is the ancient name Hispania. The various states were not formally administered as a single unit, but as separate political units under the same Crown.[5] (The legal merging of Aragon and Castile into a single Spain occurred under Philip V in 1707-1715.)\n\nThe first years of Ferdinand and Isabella's joint rule saw the Spanish conquest of the Nasrid dynasty of the Emirate of Granada (Moorish Kingdom of Granada), the last Islamic al-Andalus entity on the Iberian peninsula, completed in 1492.[6]\n\nThe completion of the Reconquista was not the only significant act performed by Ferdinand and Isabella in that year. In March 1492, the monarchs issued the Edict of Expulsion of the Jews, also called the Alhambra Decree,[7] a document which ordered all Jews either to be baptized and convert to Christianity or to leave the country.[8] That document was signed with the defeated Moorish Emir of Granada Muhammad XII.[citation needed] It allowed Mudéjar Moors (Islamic) and converso Marrano Jews to stay, while expelling all unconverted Jews from Castile and Aragon. 1492 was also the year in which the monarchs commissioned Christopher Columbus to find a westward maritime route for access to Asia, which resulted in the Spanish arrival in the Americas.\n\nIn 1494 the Treaty of Tordesillas divided the entire world beyond Europe between Portugal and Castile (Spain) for conquest and dominion purposes — by a north-south line drawn down the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nForced conversions[]\n\nDuring 1492 and beyond, Ferdinand did a lot more than just sponsor for Christopher Columbus's voyage.[9] Ferdinand violated the 1492 Alhambra Decree peace treaty in 1502 by dismissing the clearly guaranteed religious freedom for Mudéjar Muslims. Ferdinand forced all Muslims in Castile and Aragon to convert, converso Moriscos, to Catholicism, or else be expelled. Some of the Muslims who remained were mudéjar artisans, who could design and build in the Moorish style. This was also practiced by the Spanish inquisitors on the converso Marrano Jewish population of Spain. The main architect behind the Spanish Inquisition was King Ferdinand II. Ferdinand destroyed over ten thousand Arabic manuscripts in Granada alone, burning them.\n\nThe latter part of Ferdinand's life was largely taken up with disputes with successive Kings of France over control of Italy, the so-called Italian Wars. In 1494, Charles VIII of France invaded Italy and expelled Alfonso II, who was Ferdinand's first cousin once removed and stepson of Ferdinand's sister, from the throne of Naples. Ferdinand allied with various Italian princes and with Emperor Maximilian I to expel the French by 1496 and install Alfonso's son, Ferdinand, on the Neapolitan throne. In 1501, following the death of Ferdinand II of Naples and his succession by his uncle Frederick, Ferdinand of Aragon signed an agreement with Charles VIII's successor, Louis XII, who had just successfully asserted his claims to the Duchy of Milan, to partition Naples between them, with Campania and the Abruzzi, including Naples itself, going to the French and Ferdinand taking Apulia and Calabria. The agreement soon fell apart and, over the next several years, Ferdinand's great general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba fought to take Naples from the French, finally succeeding by 1504.\n\n“ \"The King of France complains that I have twice deceived him. He lies, the fool; I have deceived him ten times and more.\" --Ferdinand II of Aragón.[10] ”\n\nAfter Isabella[]\n\nAfter Isabella I's death in 1504, her kingdom went to their daughter Joanna. Ferdinand II served as the latter's regent during her absence in the Netherlands, ruled by her husband Archduke Philip. Ferdinand attempted to retain the regency permanently, but was rebuffed by the Castilian nobility and replaced with Joanna's husband, who became Philip I of Castile. After Philip's death in 1506, with Joanna supposedly mentally unstable, and her and Philip's son, the future Emperor Charles V, was only six years old, Ferdinand resumed the regency, ruling through Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, the Chancellor of the Kingdom. Charles I (to later become Holy Roman Emperor Charles V) became the King of Aragon in 1516, with his mother Joanna as Queen in name, upon Ferdinand's death.\n\nFerdinand disagreed with the policies and foreigness of Philip I. Ferdinand remarried to Germaine of Foix in 1505, the granddaughter of his half-sister Queen Eleanor of Navarre and niece of Louis XII of France. His hope was to father a new heir of Aragon, separating it from Castile, was not realized. It would have denied his son-in-law Philip I, and his grandson Charles I, from inheriting the crown and governance of Aragon. A son, John, Prince of Girona, was born, but died within hours. John was buried in the convent of Saint Paul in Valladolid, and later transferred to Poblet Monastery, traditional burial site of the kings of Aragon.[11]\n\nFerdinand also had children from his mistress, Aldonza Ruiz de Iborre y Alemany of Cervera. He had a son, Alfonso de Aragon (born in 1469), who later became Archbishop of Saragossa, and a daughter Joanna (born in 1471), who married Bernardino Fernández de Velasco, 1st Duke of Frías.\n\nIn the 16th century his son Alfonso de Aragon, who later became Archbishop of Saragossa in Aragon, found a hidden study under Ferdinand's palace containing over 400 documents written by Ferdinand. In these documents Ferdinand explained his general outlook on political power, and his true goals behind all his decisions during life as the King of Castile and Aragon. Also through these documents, Ferdinand wrote that during times of very complicated decision making he blindfolded himself to concentrate on the true matter of a situation, and not let other things 'cloud his judgment'.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1508 war resumed in Italy, this time against the Republic of Venice, which all the other powers with interests on the Italian peninsula, including Louis XII, Ferdinand II, Maximilian, and Pope Julius II joined together against as the 'League of Cambrai'. Although the French were victorious against Venice at the Battle of Agnadello, the League of Cambrai soon fell apart, as both the Pope and Ferdinand II became suspicious of French intentions. Instead, the 'Holy League' was formed, in which now all the powers joined together against Louis XII and France.\n\nIn November 1511 Ferdinand II and his son-in-law King Henry VIII of England signed the Treaty of Westminster, pledging mutual aid between the two against Navarre and France ahead of the Castilian invasion of Navarre as of July 1512. After the fall of Granada in 1492, he had maneuvered for years to take over the throne of the Basque kingdom, ruled by Queen Catherine of Navarre and King John III of Navarre, also lords of Béarn and other sizable territories of the Pyrenees and western Gascony. Ferdinand annexed Navarre first to the Crown of Aragon, but later on under the pressure of Castille noblemen, to the Crown of Castile. The Holy League was generally successful in Italy, as well, driving the French from Milan, which was restored to its Sforza dukes by the peace treaty in 1513. The French were successful in reconquering Milan two years later, however.\n\nFerdinand II died in 1516 in Madrigalejo, Extremadura. He is entombed at la Capilla Real or the Royal Chapel of Granada, in Andalucia. Isabella I, Joanna I, and Philip I are beside him there.\n\nLegacy and succession[]\n\nFerdinand and Isabella established a highly effective cosovereignity under equal terms. They utilized a prenuptial agreement to lay down their terms. During their reign they supported each other effectively in accordance to their joint motto of equality: \"Tanto monta (or monta tanto), Isabel como Fernando\", (\"They amount to the same, Isabel and Ferdinand\"). Isabella and Ferdinand's achievements were remarkable: Spain was united, or at least more united than it ever was, the crown power was centralized, at least in name, the reconquista was successfully concluded, the groundwork for the most dominant military machine of the next century and a half was laid, a legal framework was created, the church reformed. Even without the benefit of the American expansion, Spain would have been a major European power. Columbus' discovery set the country on the course for the first modern world power.\n\nIn 1502, the members of the Aragonese Cortes gathered in Zaragoza, and Parliaments of the Kingdom of Valencia and the Pincipaute of Catalonia in Barcelona, as members of the Crown of Aragon, swore an oath of loyalty to their daughter Joanna as heiress, but Alonso de Aragón, Archbishop of Saragossa, stated firmly that this oath was invalid and did not change the law of succession which could only be done by formal legislation by the Cortes with the King.[12][13] So, when King Ferdinand died on 23 January 1516, his daughter Joanna inherited the Crown of Aragon, and his grandson Charles became Governor General (regent).[14] Nevertheless, the Flemish wished that Charles assume the royal title, and this was supported by his paternal grandfather the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and by Pope Leo X. Consequently, after Ferdinand II's funeral on 14 March 1516, Charles I was proclaimed King of Castile and of Aragon jointly with his mother. Finally, the Castilian Regent, Cardinal Jiménez de Cisneros accepted the fait accompli, and the Castilian and Aragonese Cortes paid homage to him [15] as King of Aragon jointly with his mother.[16]\n\nHis grandson and successor Charles, was to inherit not only the Spanish lands of his maternal grandparents, but the Habsburg and Burgundian lands of his paternal family, which would make his heirs the most powerful rulers on the continent and, with the discoveries and conquests in the Americas and elsewhere, of the first truly global Empire.\n\nIssue[]\n\nWith his wife Isabella I the Catholic (whom he married 19 October 1469), King Ferdinand had 6 children:\n\nIsabella (1470–1498), Princess of Asturias (1497–1498). She married first Prince Afonso, Prince of Portugal, but after his death she married his cousin Prince Emanuel, the future King Emanuel I of Portugal. She died in childbirth delivering her son Michael of Paz, Crown Prince of both Portugal and Spain who, in turn, died in infancy.\n\nJohn (1478–1497), Prince of Asturias (1478–1497). He married Margaret of Habsburg (daughter of King Maximilian I). He died of tuberculosis and his posthumous child with Margaret was stillborn.\n\nJoanna I (1479–1555), Princess of Asturias (1500–1504), Queen of Castile (1504–1555), Queen of Aragon (1516–1555). She married Philip I (Philip the handsome) (son of the Emperor Maximilian I); and was the mother of King Charles I of Spain (also known as Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor). She was mentally unstable and was incarcerated by her father, and then by her son, in Tordesillas for over 50 years. Her grandson, Philip II of Spain, was crowned in 1556.\n\nMaria (1482–1517). She married King Emanuel I of Portugal, the widower of her elder sister Isabella, and was the mother of King John III of Portugal and of the Cardinal-King, Henry I of Portugal.\n\nAnna died at birth (twin of Maria) [1482]\n\nCatalina, later known Catherine of Aragon, queen of England, (1485–1536). She married first Arthur, Prince of Wales, son of and heir to King Henry VII of England and, after Prince Arthur's death, she married his brother Henry, Duke of York, who also became Prince of Wales and then King Henry VIII. She thus became Queen of England and was the mother of Queen Mary I.\n\nWith his second wife, Germaine of Foix, niece of King Louis XII of France (whom he married on 19 October 1505 in Blois) King Ferdinand had one son:\n\nJohn, Prince of Girona, who died hours after being born on 3 May 1509.\n\nHe also had one illegitimate son, with Dona Luisa Estrada, daughter of Fernan Estrada, the Spanish Ambassador to England.[17]\n\nAlonso de Estrada Duke of Aragon (1470-1530) In 1523 Upon arriving in Mexico he held the title of Royal Treasurer of Spain. He died at his estate near Vera Cruz, Mexico, and is buried at Mexico City, D.F., Mexico.\n\nHe also left several illegitimate children. With Aldonza Ruiz de Iborre y Alemany, a Catalan noblewoman of Cervera, he had:\n\nAlonso de Aragón (1470–1520). Archbishop of Zaragoza and Viceroy of Aragon.\n\nJuana (1471 – bef. 1522). She married Bernardino Fernández de Velasco, 1st Duke of Frías.\n\nWith an unknown mistress, he had:\n\nIsabella(? – ?), Abbess of the Royal Convent of Our Lady Mother of Grace at Avila.\n\nAncestry[]\n\nHeraldry[]\n\nHeraldry of Ferdinand of Aragon\n\nMonarch of the Crown of Castille (with Isabella I)\n\nPage Template:Gallery/styles.css has no content.\n\nDescription The Arms quarter the arms of Castile and León with the arms of Aragon and Aragonese Sicily, the last combining the arms of Aragon with the black eagle of the Hohenstaufen of Sicily.[18]\n\nSovereign of Aragon\n\nPage Template:Gallery/styles.css has no content.\n\nLord of Biscay\n\nPage Template:Gallery/styles.css has no content.\n\nDepiction in film and television[]\n\nFilms\n\nYear Film Director Actor 1951 Hare We Go Robert McKimson Mel Blanc 1976 La espada negra Francisco Rovira Beleta Juan Ribó 1985 Christopher Columbus Alberto Lattuada Nicol Williamson 1992 Christopher Columbus: The Discovery John Glen Tom Selleck 1992 1492: Conquest of Paradise Ridley Scott Fernando García Rimada 1992 Carry On Columbus Gerald Thomas Leslie Phillips 2001 Juana la Loca Vicente Aranda Héctor Colomé\n\nTV series\n\nYear Series Channel 1991 Réquiem por Granada TVE 2004 Memoria de España TVE 2011 Muhteşem Yüzyıl TVE 2012 Isabel, mi reina TVE 2013 The Borgias Showtime\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\n\"Ferdinand II\", from Encyclopædia Britannica Online."
