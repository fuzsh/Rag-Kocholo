        "text": "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga roared through Cannes before it launches in theaters Friday after nearly 10 years in development. The prequel film builds on the Australian wasteland universe established in George Miller‘s four other movies of the franchise: Mad Max (1979), Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981), Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).\n\nIn Fury Road, which became the first in the franchise to receive Academy Award nominations (winning six out of ten awards), Charlize Theron portrayed Imperator Furiosa. Anya Taylor-Joy takes on the titular role in this next installment, which shows her backstory of getting kidnapped by Warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) and his Biker Hord. At 10 years old, she is forced to grow up fast, and while she fights for survival, her only wish is to return home and reunite with her family.\n\nThose looking for a refresher on the Mad Max franchise can find where to stream the first four films, their chronological order and more below:\n\nWhere To Watch the Mad Max Films:\n\nAll four previously-released films in the Mad Max franchise are available to stream on Max. Since Furiosa is distributed by Warner Bros., the prequel film will eventually land on the streamer as well alongside Mad Max (1979), Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981), Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).\n\nHow To Watch the Mad Max Films in Order:\n\nMel Gibson portrayed police man Max Rockatansky in the first cycle of films — the third starring legendary singer Tina Turner who contributed original song “We Don’t Need Another Hero” — before war captain Imperator Furiosa came on the scene in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). In that film, Tom Hardy took the mantle of Mad Max, and the two paired up to fight Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) to free women he took captive. Those wanting to watch the films in order of release should follow below.\n\nFuriosa is set 15 years before Fury Road, which initially established some of the rebel’s backstory. The events of the original trilogy have still occurred, but Fury Road had a separate timeline with details changed to fit the story. Those wanting to watch in chronological order, should watch in the following order:\n\nWhen does Furiosa: A Mad MaxSaga come out?\n\nFuriosa arrives in theaters Friday, May 24.\n\nRELATED: ‘Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga’ Review: Chris Hemsworth And Anya Taylor-Joy Take Dystopian Franchise To New Levels – Cannes Film Festival\n\nWho is in Furiosa: A Mad MaxSaga?\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth take center stage in the latest franchise installment as Furiosa and Dr. Dementus, respectively. Tom Burke will play Praetorian Jack, Alyla Brown will play young Furiosa and Lacy Hulme will play Immortan Joe."
