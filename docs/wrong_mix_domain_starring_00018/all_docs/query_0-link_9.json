        "text": "Love Actually\n\nNine intertwined stories examine the complexities of the one emotion that connects us all: love. Among the characters explored are David (Hugh Grant), the handsome newly elected British prime minister who falls for a young junior staffer (Martine McCutcheon), Sarah (Laura Linney), a graphic designer whose devotion to her mentally ill brother complicates her love life, and Harry (Alan Rickman), a married man tempted by his attractive new secretary.\n\n+\n\nBridget Jones's Diary\n\nAt the start of the New Year, 32-year-old Bridget (Ren√©e Zellweger) decides it's time to take control of her life -- and start keeping a diary. Now, the most provocative, erotic and hysterical book on her bedside table is the one she's writing. With a taste for adventure, and an opinion on every subject - from exercise to men to food to sex and everything in between - she's turning the page on a whole new life.\n\nRelease Date: Dec 18, 2023\n\nRating: M\n\nRuntime: 232 mins\n\nDirector: Richard Curtis\n\nActors: Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Martin Freeman, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley, Renee Zellweger, Andrew Lincoln"
