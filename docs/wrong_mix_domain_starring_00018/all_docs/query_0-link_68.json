        "text": "The Masked Singer turned out to be a hugely successful new format. The first series started on the 4th of January 2020 (so before Covid had arrived here. Boy, does that look like a whole other world now!) and the second series began on Boxing Day 2020 so, The Masked Singer near enough bookended the year!\n\nIt probably had less issues with Covid than most shows, with the contestants having to wear a full costume covering them. Host Joel Dommett joked that the show was apt as “The whole world has gone mask mad!”\n\nThey took some precautions in the second series, the judges panel had perspex sheets between each of them. The line-up was almost the same as before though, with Rita Ora, Davina McCall and Jonathan Ross all returing, but Ken Jeong didn’t due to being unable to fly over from the US. He was replaced by comedian Mo Gilligan, which was probably for the best all round, and Ken didn’t really work on the UK version. He didn’t know many UK celebrities, and his approach didn’t really gel with the rest of the show, even if it seems to fit better on the US version for whatever reason.\n\nI was surprised they even had a studio audience! I was expecting them to have to do it with either no studio audience or a very limited one, but they did get an audience made up of people who were in support bubbles sitting with each other.\n\nI don’t know if it was because it was broadcast on Boxing Day so I was more in the mood for Christmas cracker jokes, but I actually quite liked some of Joel’s puns in the first episode! “Like me with my smartphone, [Rita Ora] always cracks the case!”, “Can you hazard a geese?” (about Swan’s identity), “They’ve got a right chip on their shoulder!” (about Sausage), “Pretty big on the underground scene” (about Badger). I didn’t like those sort of puns throughout the rest of the series, so closeness to Christmas was probably why!\n\nAlien looked more like Predator than Alien. She also had a bit of a Medusa the Gorgon thing going on, and wore a silver, glitterball like outfit. She performed ‘Don’t Start Now’ by Dua Lipa in a futuristic post-apocalypric dystopian city setting. Jonathan’s guess of Gillian Anderson wasn’t too bad, with The X Files connection, and Davina thought it could be Joel’s wife Hannah Cooper. Alien was Sophie Ellis-Bextor though. I guessed it was her quite quickly, as I think a lot of people did. The clue in her introduction VT about “tripping the light fantastic” set me off, as her 2007 album was called Trip The Light Fantastic. I thought her mention of “the audience” might be a reference to Theaudience, the band she was in before her solo career. That might sound too broad and generic to be a clue, but then apparently a wedding dress in the VT was a reference to her wearing a wedding dress in the video for ‘Get Over You’, so… One clue I missed that was quite clever was a crime scene investigation in the VT, which was a nod to her song ‘Murder On The Dancefloor’.\n\nSophie Ellis-Bextor has a very distinctive voice, which came through even in the distorted speaking bits, and was even more obvious when she started singing. I was disappointed that she was the first out, but then she was the weakest performer in week one, which was strange in itself really. I wonder if she was trying to disguise her voice? She sung and performed a lot better after her mask had come off at the end. In fact, the whole outfit and the setting worked pretty well! She also took being first out about as positively as anyone could. I liked that Davina gave a shoutout to Sophie’s Kitchen Disco performances during lockdown.\n\nSeahorse‘s performance of ‘Can’t Get You Out Of My Head’ by Kylie Minogue was, appropriately enough, set underwater, featuring lots of bubbles and glowing pink and blue fish. Despite a good performance and managing to show off a good physique in the seahorse costume, Seahorse was voted off in the second week. Three of the panel (Mo, Davina and Rita) guessed Seahorse was really Mel B just before she was unmasked (Jonathan thought she would be talkshow host Trisha Goddard!)\n\nSwan was initially paired in a Face-Off with Dragon, but she looked scarier than Dragon! Swan had a jet black and blood red colour scheme, the thin swan neck and tiny head at first made you wonder where her real head was, and a lot of her feathers were made of ballerina tutus, which made them look twisted. She sung ‘That Don’t Impress Me Much’ by Shania Twain well though. She was often seen in VTs and in her performances in luxurious settings with red velvet curtains and chandeliers. I liked Jonathan’s guess of Meghan Markle, due to Swan’s American accent and the royalty references. A lot of people thought she might be one of the Pussycat Dolls due to the accent. But she wasn’t American at all, she was in fact Martine McCutcheon! Jonathan guessed that just before the unmasking, due to a clue of Swan mixing with world leaders – in Love, Actually, Martine McCutcheon played the love interest of Hugh Grant’s Prime Minister character, and there was also an American President in as well. But that clue also referred to Martine performing at Liza Minelli and David Gest’s wedding, and she ended up being sat next to Donald Trump – which they acknowledged was a little awkard now! Louise Redknapp tweeted she recognised Swan’s voice as Martine McCutcheon, as they went to school together! Swan’s sing-off and final performance was ‘Black Velvet’ by Alannah Myles, which fitted quite well with the Swan’s aesthetic!\n\nI really liked Grandfather Clock‘s costume. His face was the clock face, where the clock hands were his grey moustache, and the pendulum was like a tie! His first performance was to ‘Rock Around The Clock’ by Bill Haley & The Comets, in front of a multicoloured jukebox, so that was the “clock” part covered. His second performance was dancing like a grandpa at a wedding reception to ‘You Make Me Feel So Young’ by Frank Sinatra, so that was the “grandfather” part covered. His first VT suggested he might be a footballer, with references to “extra time”, “a keeper”, ‘All Together Now’ by The Farm playing in the background, and three separate lion statues – that is Three Lions, the symbol of the England Football team. Mo made a good guess with this, that Grandfather Clock might not be a footballer, he could be comedian Frank Skinner, who was part of the football anthem ‘Three Lions’, and was a presenter of the TV show Fantasy Football League. But whoever he was, he obviously had some football connection. When he was eliminated, the panel all guessed different footballers – Mo guessed Lee Dixon, Davina guessed David Seaman, Rita guessed Ian Wright and Jonathan guessed Peter Shilton – but they were all wrong. Grandfather Clock was Glenn Hoddle. One of the more specific clues to it being him were a VT which had cowboy boots with spurs – a nod to Tottenam Hotspur.\n\nGrandfather Clock’s arc was a bit of a rerun of Tree/Teddy Sheringham last year – he even finished in the same overall position of 9th place! Though I suppose it is possible for a tree to be remade into a grandfather clock.\n\nBush Baby was in a romper suit, and he looked a bit like a mogwai from Gremlins. He had what sounded like a put on Australian accent, though he had a deep, full singing voice. One thing with Bush Baby was that there were so many red herrings! His first performance, of ‘Delilah’ by Tom Jones, was in a jungle setting with elephants, a giraffe and lions. While those are African wildlife, the jungle setting and the Australian accent made people think it might be a contestant from I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! That wasn’t the case. There were lots of references to cooking as well. A frequent guess for Bush Baby’s identity was Matt Lucas, as Matt Lucas used to wear a romper suit in the gameshow Shooting Stars to play (What Are The Scores) George Dawes, and the cooking clues were thought to be due to Matt Lucas presenting The Great British Bake-Off. He wasn’t Bush Baby, or any of the other contestants, but Matt Lucas would appear in this series of The Masked Singer later on.\n\nBush Baby did an Elvis impression for his performance of ‘A Little Less Conversation’ by Elvis vs. JXL, which confirmed to a lot of people that he was probably a comedian. He ultimately lost “the battle of cuteness” when he was in a bottom 2 with Dragon, and the panel voted to keep Dragon.\n\nBush Baby turned out to be actor and comedian John Thomson. The cooking references were because John had appeared on Celebrity Masterchef, which seems a bit of a stretch for them to make so much about association with cooking! Episode 5, where every song was a clue, had a very specific reference though. Bush Baby performed ‘Release Me’ by Engelbert Humperdinck, and an instrumental version of that was the theme tune to ’90s sketch show The Fast Show, which John starred in.\n\nMy favourite thing with Bush Baby though was when he commented that Mo doesn’t know much natural history. For one thing, Mo didn’t seem to know that a bush baby is an actual animal – for another, he thought the animal the character of Bush Baby was based on was a gecko – which is a lizard!\n\nViking looked almost like a Mr. Men character where the head takes up the whole body. Or possibly a theme park mascot costume of comic strip Viking character Hägar the Horrible. Viking had a big beard, with a platted moustache, and also a horned helmet. You might have expected his voice to be loud and gruff, but it was falsetto. His first performance was to ‘Songbird’ by Fleetwood Mac, surrounded by lots of candles in the background. His second was to ‘Watermelon Sugar’ by Harry Styles, in front of a huge Viking banquet table with flaming torches. He performed ‘The Scientist’ by Coldplay in a Game Of Thrones-esque setting, with a majestic throne and giant silver horned masks.\n\nRicky Wilson from the Kaiser Chiefs was a common guess for Viking’s identity. Guest panelist Alan Carr suggested Brendan Sheerin from Coach Trip (due to references to Viking travelling).\n\nThe Viking image seemed to jar with his performances but made more sense later when he was revealed to be Morten Harket, frontman of A-Ha. He is Norweigan, and Vikings came from Scandanavia (an area which includes Denmark, Norway and Sweden). A reference to “King” made me wonder if Viking was Years & Years frontman and It’s A Sin star Olly Alexander, as Years & Years topped the charts with ‘King’. But that clue was in fact based on Morten Harket’s home town of Kongsberg – which translates into English as “King’s Rock”.\n\nA clue in a map mentioned The A1 Road, and A1 covered ‘Take On Me’ in 2000. In Clue Week, Viking did a slowed down cover of his own biggest hit, ‘Take On Me’, notable in becoming the first contestant on The Masked Singer UK to do a version of one of their own songs.\n\nBlob was a big purple, well, blob. He looked a bit like a melting novelty ice cream. He had four eyes, two eyes on the head, and two eyes which will have been operated using the arms of the person in the costume. I think Blob’s costume mustn’t have been very mobile, as he mostly moved the two arm-eyes around a lot, and spun round.\n\nWhile it might not been as easy as it was with Alien, Blob’s indentity was one of the easiest to guess. He was Sir. Lenny Henry.\n\nHis first performance, of ‘Uptown Funk’ by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars, was against a black and white swirling spiral. There were small furry monsters with googly eyes in the background, which looked somewhat like some of the novelty noses for Red Nose Day over the years. In one performance he was in a Blob Hotel to perform ‘Hotel Room Service’ by Pitbull. This was a reference to Lenny Henry doing adverts for Premier Inn hotel chain.\n\nA VT had Blob on stage at the Shakespeare Globe Theatre. It was funny seeing a giant purple blob in a Shakespearian setting. The reason for the clue though was that it was a reference to Lenny Henry playing Othello.\n\nBlob with a big novelty cheque I took to be a reference to the big novelty cheques you often see on charity telethons, such as Red Nose Day.\n\nTo be fair, they did try to make the clues ambiguous. A lot of Blob’s VTs were set in schools, and the teacher references in VTs made there was a suggestion of Greg Davies, who played Mr. Gilbert in The Inbetweeners franchise. In a VT, the names Matt, Lucas and Andy were labelled on lockers, which seemed to imply Matt Lucas playing Andy in Little Britain – which I think may have been a nod to the character Andy being on a Comic Relief charity single. Cooking references led to some suggestions of Ainsley Harriott, but reminded me of Lenny Henry’s ’90s sitcom Chef!, which was what they were alluding to. I guess I’m the right age to remember Chef! though. I’m also of the age where Mr. Blobby was an unforgettable part of your childhood (whether we want to forget him or not…) I never thought Noel Edmunds was Blob, but I couldn’t help being reminded of Mr. Blobby.\n\nDragon was ridiculously CUTE! The face, the rainbow chest, the little gold wings – awwwww. The rainbow chest gave them an LGBT+ vibe already, but there was ambiguous gender as well, judges and audience not sure if Dragon was a man or a woman in there. Although as the series went on it became more clear that Dragon was a woman, I guess from the voice mainly. She did mention a “drag on”/dragon pun, which suggested a drag queen.\n\nHer first performance was ‘You’ve Got A Friend In Me’, and was Toy Story themed with an astronaut, a royal soldier, a dog, a princess, a maid and a cowboy very like Woody. It also finished with a smokey fart joke. Dragon’s second performance had her singing ‘Reach’ by S Club 7 in front of a pink castle with dancers dressed as star-shaped outfits. Smoke came out of her nose this week, thankfully!\n\nDragon also did ‘The Shoop Shoop Song (It’s In His Kiss)’ by Cher, in a candyland setting with giant lollipops and backing singers dressed in pink with pink ice cream soda-like hair.\n\nDragon was a fun contestant. I really liked Joel’s comment that “blowing out candles on their birthday cake is always a nightmare” for Dragon! Also Dragon toasting marshmallows, and pulling a sword out of a stone.\n\nGuesses for who Dragon was included Courtney Act/Shane Jenek, and Michelle Visage with the drag clues. Another common guess was Jennifer Saunders. She didn’t voice the Dragon in Shrek 2, but she did voice The Fairy Godmother, and proved herself to be a good singer with a rendition of ‘Holding Out For A Hero’ in that film.\n\nGuest panelist Alan Carr guessed Carol Vorderman. Mo once guessed Rikki Lake. Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg were other suggestions. Sandi Toksvig was another, but I knew that couldn’t be true, having seen so many jokes about her small height on QI. Dragon was obviously someone who was fairly tall!\n\nDragon turned out to be Sue Perkins. A clue referring to Absolutely Fabulous was that apparently she wrote “additional material” for 8 episodes of it. She was probably the biggest revelation of the contestants, in that I never knew she could sing before this! In hindsight, I suppose it figures that the two incredibly cute ones (Dragon and Bush Baby) were comedians. Lenny Henry as well and Jason Manford last year with Hedgehog. I’m not saying a cute character in The Masked Singer will always turn out to be a comedian, but I can see why there’s a lot of crossover.\n\nHarlequin had a jester-like appearance, and had an elaborate, stylised outfit, with a dress which looked like she might be wearing a cage crinoline . It had the overall effect of giving the appearance of a circus tent.\n\nI liked how there were some slightly Tim Burton movie aesthetics with Harlequin’s performances too.\n\nHer first performance was ‘Diamonds’ by Rihanna in front of a shattered glass mirror. Her second performance, ‘Smile’ by Nat King Cole, had staging which was themed on Alice In Wonderland, with Harlequin among white rabbits and mad hatters on a black and white chessboard with red and white roses in the background.\n\nThere was a grand piano for a big ballad performace of ‘Falling’ by Harry Styles, orange balloons and backing dancers in gothish ballgowns and ruffs when Harlequin performed ‘everything i wanted’ by Billie Eilish. Harlequin had a skull cane, red diamond playing card pattern in the background and dancers dressed in a black and white chessboard pattern and a black diamond playing card pattern to a performance of ‘Sweet But a Psycho’ by Ava Max.\n\nAs for who she was, there was a hint to her winning a BRIT Award, but that covers a lot of people. Suggestions for her identity included Beverley Knight and Alexandra Burke, both of whom had played the lead role in the stage musical version of The Bodyguard. A common one was Des’Ree, due to her track ‘Kissing You’ featuring in the 1996 film Romeo + Juliet, which memorably has a masquerade ball when the title characters met. Grace Jones, Catherine Tate, and Tamsin Archer were others. Newsreader Moira Stewart was a surprisingly common guess, due to clues relating to news. They were obviously hinting towards Heather Small in one VT, with Harlequin talking of “Movin’ On Up” and feeling “Proud”. Joss Stone was suggested a few times too, which would be quite amusing in hindsight once the series was over.\n\nBut I think from the voice it became obvious that Harlequin was Gabrielle. A lot of people guessed her early on, even though very few of the clues seemed to point to her. They were quite cryptic. One was her dropping a fan and not being able to pick it up, due to the crinoline. The fan was ‘Out Of Reach’. Another such clue was when Harequin said “Rumour Has It someone I admire did impressions of me”, which was a reference to Adele saying she used to pretend to be Gabrielle.\n\nI thought Harlequin might be Gabrielle from early on, but what confirmed it beyond any doubt for me was in Clue Week, when she performed ‘Fast Car’ by Tracy Chapman (who had been another name suggested). Gabrielle’s debut single ‘Dreams’ in it’s original form sampled ‘Fast Car’ by Tracy Chapman.\n\nHarlequin was one of the contestants I liked most, partly due to me being a fan of Gabrielle anyway, and also I think out of all the contestants this year she was the one who best played The Masked Singer character she had.\n\nIn The Final, last year’s winner Nicola Roberts/Queen Bee was on the panel too. The final 3 were Badger, Robin and Sausage.\n\n3rd place went to Robin. I thought Robin looked more like a turkey or a rooster! He had a decent voice though. He performed ‘Can’t Stop The Feeling’ by Justin Timberlake, which had a lightning bolt and fire in the background. Next time he performed ‘Dance Monkey’ by Tones and I, with a hedge maze in the background and hedge people playing instruments, including a hedge piano!\n\nI agreed with Davina’s guess of Nicky Byrne from Westlife. There were a few Westlife songs nodded to in VTs (“I’ve been know to ‘Fly[ing] Without Wings'”, “In a ‘World Of my [Our] Own'”. There were a lot football references too, and I knew Nicky Byrne was a goalkeeper for Leeds United.\n\nThere were lots of references to boybands, which turned out to be red herrings. “I Want It That Way” (the Backstreet Boys), “in sync” (N*SYNC). Robin was from a boyband though. He was Aston Merrygold from JLS.\n\nOne boyband red herring that doubled as an actual clue was when he said he was “known for being blue”. That could have been taken as a mention of the boyband Blue, but what it was referring to is Aston wearing a blue hoodie when JLS were doing that Power Rangers/Teletubbies/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ‘each member has their own colour’ thing. Robin performed ‘Rockin Robin’ by Michael Jackson. That song was always a likely choice for Robin to perform due to the title, but it was a bigger clue because Aston performed that as Michael Jackson when he was on Stars In Their Eyes, years before he was in JLS!\n\nRobin also sung ‘Closer’ by Ne-Yo, sat in a giant birds nest with huge eggs. Ironically, the following performance that week was by Badger, which we’ll get to later.\n\nRobin flirted with Rita during a performance of ‘Thinking Out Loud’ by Ed Sheeran. Guest judge Matt Lucas liked it as well, saying “It’s not often I’ve fancied a bird!” Then in the final, Robin flirted with Davina during a performance of ‘For Once In My Life’ by Stevie Wonder – Rita looked a bit miffed!\n\nIn the final, Robin talked of “another competition” and that he “Hope[s] I don’t make a berk of myself!”, which alluded to JLS finishing runner-up to Alexandra Burke in series 5 of The X Factor. Davina, Rita and Nicola guessed who he was by then. Jonathan suggested Alexandra herself, and Mo suggested Olly Murs, so keeping with the X Factor theme anyway. One of the interesting clues was that a UFO seen in a VT was a reference to JLS’s original name being UFO. Though I did think the “my name fits like a glove”, which was Marigolds, which sound vaguely like the word “Merrygold” shouldn’t really count as a clue! I get that they want them to be hard to guess, but still.\n\nThe runner-up was Badger.\n\nHe had one of the best costumes. The badger face was adorably cute, and he wore leather motorcycle gear. He had motorcycles in the background of his first performance, which was my favourite in week one – it was a cover of the Muse version of ‘Feeling Good’ by Nina Simone.\n\nBadger often had other animals backing him. There were two cat ladies dancing with him in his performance of ‘Feeling Good’. His next one was ‘I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing’ by Aerosmith, with a band of foxes on guitar, drums and keyboards! His fox backing crew returned in the semi-final when he performed ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ by Nirvana, with Badger playing a guitar himself. In the final when he performed ‘Believer’ by Imagine Dragons, he had a backing band of other badgers.\n\nHis performance of ‘Wrecking Ball’ by Miley Cyrus was set in a construction site, with builders in yellow hard hats and hi-viz vests, and obviously a wrecking ball in the background.\n\nHe mentioned that Badgers are shy creatures, and said he was shy when he was younger. Awww. That did make him even more endearing.\n\nGuesses included McFly bassist Dougie Poynter (pop-rock connection, shyness when he was younger, and some red herring hints to I’m A Celebrity…, which Dougie Poynter won series 11 of). Matt Willis from Busted (pop-rock band, won series 6 of I’m A Celebrity…). A member of cartoon band Gorillaz as well seemed a popular guess (as Badger had mentioned having hit songs but not being recognised). Davina suggested Professor Brian Cox because of a periodic table of elements in a VT and the fact that Brian Cox was in D:Ream. One of Rita’s guesses was Alan Partridge, who isn’t even a real person! She meant gardener and TV presenter Alan Titchmarsh, due to clues about “green”. Which was still a bit of an out there guess, come to think of it! Jay Kay from Jamiroquai and Adam Lambert were quite common suggestions as well. But those were all way off!\n\nBadger turned out to be Ne-Yo. I think the reason he was one of the harder ones to guess is that Badger was a bit of a rocker, and Ne-Yo mostly does R&B. But this has proved he certainly has a voice suited to rock songs too! I’d quite like him to make a rock album. He also put on a fake British accent, which, well I’ve certainly heard worse, but it was a bit of mishmash of different regional accents.\n\nIn Clues week, where every song was a clue he performed ‘Because Of You’ by Kelly Clarkson. Ne-Yo had a song called ‘Because Of You’, a completely different song to Kelly Clarkson’s, but the same title. (They both also have completely different songs titled ‘Miss Independent’!) Strangely though, it was when he sung Kelly Clarkson’s ‘Because Of You’ that I recognised his voice!\n\nNicola was the only member of the panel who guessed him correctly. She had been listening to a Ne-Yo song in the shower that morning!\n\nAs usual, we got an explanation for some of the clues at the end. One VT had a periodic table of elements where Ne was circled. Ne stands for Neon, so Ne-Yo, plus the fact that he got his stage name from Neo from The Matrix. His comment on not being recognised despite hit songs was that he was a songwriter for other artists before he had solo success, the songs he’d written included ‘Let Me Love You’ by Mario, and ‘Irreplaceable’ by Beyonce.\n\nNe-Yo was another one whose costume looked like a good outfit without the mask when he performed at the end!\n\nThe winner was Sausage.\n\nSausage was wrapped in a newspaper cone with chips! Sausage was a girl, despite the innuendo you might get from a sausage. Such as Davina on one occasion complementing her by saying “I love sausage”!\n\nI was a big fan of Sausage’s persona. She had some of my favourite VTs. A lot of them had her at the seaside or a fairground, with her being a snack food. One had her drinking ketchup (!), and in a Cinderella-style horse and carriage in Blackpool.\n\nHer performance of ‘All Around The World’ by Lisa Stansfield had her at a hot dog stand, among colourful balloons and a lit up big wheel at night in the background. When she sung ‘And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going’ from Dreamgirls, Sausage had a newspaper Breaking News backing and was surrounded by women dressed in ballgowns and with fans that looked like they were made out of newspaper. When she performed ‘Good As Hell’ by Lizzo, Sausage was in a pink lipstick beauty salon setting, where she had a blonde ponytail and swung a string of sausages around! In the final, her performance of ‘I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)’ by Whitney Houston was in a drive-in movie setting, and Sausage had popcorn which she tossed in her mouth – but obviously couldn’t eat, because of the mask!\n\nBut those weren’t the only reasons why I thought Sausage was one of the best. She had a great voice as well.\n\nStacey Solomon was a very popular guess, with the big voice, bubbly personality and Essex accent. In a group performance of ‘That’s Not My Name’ by the Ting Tings, Sausage’s solo line was “They call me Stacey!”.\n\nSheridan Smith was also a guess a lot of people made. Of the panel, Jonathan in particular was keen on it, after a clue which said “My hair colour was certified by the law” – Jonathan took it to be a reference to Legally Blonde, and Sheridan Smith was the first person to play the lead role in the West End musical version of that. Sausage herself also mentioned being a “Funny Girl”, another stage musical Sheridan Smith played the lead in.\n\nOther suggestions included Adele, Beverley Knight, Pixie Lott, Kéllé Bryan, Leona Lewis, Jennifer Hudson, Demi Lovato – Mystic Meg once!\n\nBut Sausage was actually Joss Stone. I admit I thought Sausage was Stacey Solomon through a lot of the series, but after a VT mentioned Sausage loving DIY and having a pink toolbox and an old intereview Joss Stone gave resurfaced where she mentioned that particular fact, I thought then she was Joss Stone, as that is such a specific clue!\n\nIn hindsight, the fact that Sausage’s songs were mostly soul diva ones were perhaps a hint that she was Joss Stone. As well as the ones already mentioned she sung ‘Don’t Let Go (Love)’ by En Vogue’ and ‘I Will Survive’ by Glora Gaynor,\n\nIt was noted that it’s slightly ironic that nobody guessed Joss Stone as Sausage, but she was suggested as Harlequin, and also there’s irony that Joss is a lifelong vegetarian given that she was the Sausage.\n\nAnother thing to note is that she was also heavily pregnant when the series was filmed!\n\nAt the end they explained some of the clues. Saying she “bagged\n\nherself a king” was for the time she played Anne Of Cleeves, one of Henry VIII’s wives, in the drama series The Tudors. A menu in one of the VTs had “Dover Sole”, and Joss is from Dover. I liked that one of the items on a VT menu was “red herring” though!\n\nI enjoyed series 2 of The Masked Singer. Badger and Sausage were my favourites in their respective first weeks, and were my overall top two throughout, so I was pleased with how it ended. Series 2 has been a ratings success, they’ve already confirmed a third series, plus they are the expanding the franchise, there will be a Masked Dancer series later in the year for ITV, due to the fact they can’t do Britain’s Got Talent this year. I’m not sure The Masked Dancer is a brilliant idea (and, to be honest I doubt I’ll be watching it), but I am eager for more of The Masked Singer."
