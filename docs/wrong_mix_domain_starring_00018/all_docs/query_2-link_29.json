I'm David Bianculli in for Terry Gross.\n\nThe British singer Boy George was a pop star in the 1980s. With his band\n\nCulture Club, he had such hits as \"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me\" and \"I'll\n\nTumble 4 Ya.\" His music was somewhere between pop, soul and reggae; his look\n\nwas somewhere between male and female. Culture Club fell apart in 1986 and so\n\ndid Boy George who was trying to kick a heroin habit. He cleaned up, but\n\ndidn't re-establish himself in the States until the film \"The Crying Game.\"\n\nHis version of the title song rang under the closing credits.\n\nNow he's starring in \"Taboo,\" an autobiographical musical, set in the decadent\n\nfashion-centric world of '80s London. The show includes some of the hits Boy\n\nGeorge recorded with Culture Club, including their biggest hit, \"Karma\n\nChameleon,\" which topped the charts in the States in 1984.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nBOY GEORGE: (Singing) Desert loving in your eyes all the way. If I listen to\n\nyour lies, would you say I'm a man without conviction, I'm a man who doesn't\n\nknow how to sell a contradiction, you come and go, you come and go?\n\nKarma, karma, karma, karma, karma, chameleon, you come and go, you come and\n\ngo. Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream, red, gold and\n\ngreen, red, gold and green.\n\nDon't hear your wicked words every day, and you used to be so sweet, I heard\n\nyou say that my love was an addiction, when we cling, our love is strong.\n\nWhen you go, you're gone forever, you string along, you string along.\n\nKarma, karma, karma, karma, karma, chameleon, you come and...\n\nBIANCULLI: Terry spoke with Boy George in 1995.\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nYou know, when I first saw you perform, I wasn't sure whether the drag was\n\njust a way to get attention, you know, and you actually, like, went home and\n\nput on khakis and a shirt and tie or whether, you know, you really enjoyed\n\ndressing in drag and always had.\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, when I was a teen-ager, I started dressing up. When I\n\ndiscovered David Bowie, that was my kind of extravagant style began in Culture\n\nClub, and I did come and look like that most of the time. These days, I'm\n\nmore likely to go home and put on a pair of baggies, you know, because I like\n\nto have a distinction between what I do on stage, and there is more of a\n\nseparation now than there used to be. I was kind of trapped in that image for\n\nyears. I couldn't bear to let people see me looking normal. Now I don't give\n\na damn.\n\nGROSS: What's changed for you that you don't care now?\n\nBOY GEORGE: I guess I'm more comfortable with my physical appearance without\n\nthe armor, without the drag. So there's more of a balance, and it just makes\n\ndressing up more fun, you know, because it's not something you have to do as\n\nan obligation.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm. Now were you into style before you were old enough to go to\n\nthe clubs?\n\nBOY GEORGE: The first line in my book is, `When I was a little boy, I wanted\n\nto be Shirley Bassey.' So I've always been attracted to style and dramatic\n\ngestures, and I grew up with a fascination for all things different. I used\n\nto watch those Busby Berkeley movies on TV on Saturday, and I just always\n\nloved glamour and pizazz.\n\nGROSS: And when did you start to try to become that?\n\nBOY GEORGE: I guess around the age of about 11 years old, when I started to\n\nreally get into pop music. That was around the time of the glam scene, so\n\nthere were people like David Bowie and Marc Bolan, all sorts of fantastic\n\nperformers. And that's when I really started getting into it.\n\nGROSS: Now when did you start to sing?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, I always used to sing along to pop records. I used to walk\n\naround the streets with a transistor radio to my ear, and I learned all the\n\nwords to every pop song you could imagine. And so I was always singing all my\n\nchildhood and all through my teen-age years. And people used to say, you\n\nknow, `You have a good voice. Why don't you try and become a singer?' But it\n\njust seemed so out of reach when I was a teen-ager. And when punk rock came\n\nalong, it really opened the door for people like me because prior to that, you\n\nreally had to pay your dues and spend years on the road, and punk kind of\n\nkicked down the door and turned everything upside down.\n\nGROSS: So what was your singing like, you know, during the punk era?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, my first band was called In Praise Of Lemmings. So that\n\nkind of gives you an idea of what kind of--and we had this song which was\n\ncalled \"Mask.\"(ph) And I was really influenced by Siouxsie and the Banshees.\n\nI was a big Siouxsie Banshee fan. So it was kind of very droney kind of\n\n(singing) `Make a mask for me,' or that kind of deep baritone-type stuff, and\n\nvery suicidal. But I seem to have snapped out of that.\n\nGROSS: Tell us the story of how Culture Club got started.\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, I was in this band called Bow Wow Wow, and they threw me\n\nout. But I had the bug. I'd been on stage. I'd gotten a kind of taste of\n\nit. So I started to look for my own band, and that's really how it happened.\n\nI just rang around, and then once I got a couple of members of the band, we\n\nstarted to look for other people.\n\nGROSS: So one of the co-founders of the band, John Moss, who, you know, was\n\nthe drummer, you were lovers with him for a long time.\n\nBOY GEORGE: We were lovers pretty soon after we met, and John was the kind of\n\ndriving force behind the band, you know, getting things organized. He was a\n\nreal sort of go-getter type person. So he was the kind of practical force\n\nwithin the band. And we kind of fell in love within about three months of\n\nmeeting each other, and that's really what made the whole thing so exciting.\n\nBut as we got more and more successful and our relationship kind of fell\n\napart, you know, the pressures of being successful and jealousy, immaturity.\n\nI mean, it really kind of wore us down.\n\nGROSS: In your book, you say that you actually wanted people to know that you\n\nwere gay, but John didn't want you to reveal that.\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, John didn't want people to know about us...\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nBOY GEORGE: ...and our relationship because on the one hand, he felt that the\n\nmedia, if they knew, might try to interfere and write bad things about us.\n\nAnd I guess also there was a lot of fear on John's part because he wasn't very\n\ncomfortable with his sexuality. But as far as I was concerned, you know, I\n\nwas out of the closet at 16. My parents knew when I was 16 years old. So it\n\nwas very frustrating for me to be kind of living in limbo, almost living a\n\nlie. I mean, obviously, the way I looked and the way that I behaved I think\n\nmade it quite clear to a lot of people what I was. But I was sitting on the\n\nfence, and it was a very difficult thing for me to do.\n\nGROSS: What advice did your record company give you when you signed?\n\nBOY GEORGE: My record company never ever gave me any advice about my\n\nsexuality. Nobody ever interfered. I think people don't want to talk about\n\nit. The general attitude in the business is, `I'd rather not know. You know,\n\nif we don't talk about it, it doesn't exist.' I mean, I never had any of\n\nthat. I mean, no one in my management or in my record company ever said, you\n\nknow, `Don't say.' They just didn't talk about it.\n\nGROSS: Oh, let me play the record that was your first hit in the States. I'm\n\ngoing to play \"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me.\" Was that your first hit in\n\nEngland also?\n\nBOY GEORGE: It was our third single, but it was our first successful record.\n\nGROSS: Do you want to say anything about writing this song, how you feel\n\nabout it now?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, I guess in those days, I was a bit of a victim, and this\n\nsong is kind of woe is me. You know, it was a song about John, all about the\n\nfact that, you know, he wasn't sort of giving a hundred percent to the\n\nrelationship and he wasn't being honest with himself. So I guess it has a\n\ncertain poignancy.\n\nGROSS: OK. This is Boy George, Culture Club, singing \"Do You Really Want To\n\nHurt Me,\" their first hit in the States.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nBOY GEORGE: (Singing) Do you really want to hurt me? Do you really want to\n\nmake me cry? Precious kisses, words that burn me. Lovers never ask you why.\n\nIn my heart, the fire's burning. Choose my color, find a star. Precious\n\npeople always tell me that's a step a step too far.\n\nDo you really want to...\n\nGROSS: I thought it was interesting in your book, you say that at some point\n\nyou realized that all the fans that surrounded your house and that really\n\nwanted to get close to you, it wasn't so much that they cared about you, they\n\ncared about being close to fame, being close to celebrity.\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, I can only kind of relate it to my own experiences as a\n\nteen-ager. You know, I used to stand outside David Bowie's house, and I used\n\nto go to radio stations, and I used to, you know, try and touch him and scream\n\nas he came out of the building. And I don't really know why I did that. When\n\nI think about it now, I think, `How ridiculous,' but I guess in some way, I\n\nrelated to David Bowie. He was somebody a little weird. He was bisexual and\n\nknew I was gay. So he was kind of like a god to me. He was a kind of\n\nrelease, an escape. I don't know if that's true of my fans, but I think a lot\n\nof the girls that were kind of into Culture Club and into me, I think they\n\nreally recognized a certain frailty and a certain vulnerability in me, and I\n\nthink that's what was the attraction.\n\nBIANCULLI: Boy George speaking with Terry Gross in 1995. He has a new\n\nmusical called \"Taboo\" about his rise to fame in '80s London.\n\nMore after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nBIANCULLI: Let's get back to Terry's interview with flamboyant '80s pop icon\n\nBoy George. It was recorded in 1995, the year he released his first album of\n\nsongs with unambiguously gay lyrics including this song \"Same Thing In\n\nReverse.\"\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nBOY GEORGE: (Singing) How does it feel, what do you do when he's all alone\n\nwith you? Do you kiss him, hold his hand? Who's the woman, who's the man?\n\nIs it twisted? Is it sick, Mother Nature's little trick? I don't have to\n\nfeel no shame, in God's image I am made. Your brother doesn't understand how\n\nyou could love another man and your poor father thinks we're cursed. It's the\n\nsame thing in reverse. It's the same thing in reverse.\n\nGROSS: Now how does it feel to sing songs now that acknowledge that you're\n\ngay?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, I guess all my songs have, in a way, been sort of gay love\n\nsongs, in a sense. In the past, they were kind of ambiguous.\n\nGROSS: I'm trying to think, you know, in your lyrics in the past, was it\n\nalways, like, a you instead of a she or a he that you were addressing?\n\nBOY GEORGE: I think it was general, you know, and we kept it ambiguous. The\n\nfirst time I ever recorded with Culture Club, the first demos we ever made,\n\nwere for EMI Records, and a song called \"Eyes of Medusa\" was one of our first\n\nsongs. And in that, I sang, `He loves me, he hates me,' and there was a whole\n\nincident where the engineer stopped me and said, `You're saying he.' And then\n\nthe whole band had a big discussion about it, and we decided that it would be\n\nbetter to not alienate people. So in a way, what I've done is gone back to my\n\noriginal way of writing and just written from the heart, really.\n\nGROSS: You write in your book that you became trapped in your own image. You\n\nhad had a lot of different styles before you really became famous. Was the\n\nimage that you had when you became famous one that you were expected to keep?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, I don't think I was expected to keep it.\n\nGROSS: I mean, were you expected to keep, like, that hairdo and that outfit?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, it kind of worked, so it was--I mean, the look that I had\n\nin Culture Club was a kind of watered-down look of all the looks I'd had since\n\nI was a teen-ager.\n\nGROSS: Describe it.\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, it was the big Hasidic hat and...\n\nGROSS: I never thought of it that way.\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, it was actually a proper Jewish hat that I wore...\n\nGROSS: Really?\n\nBOY GEORGE: ...which was a present from John. It was actually a\n\n(unintelligible) hat and then I wore it with sort of dreadlock braids with\n\nribbons, and my clothes were kind of psychedelic and baggy. Not really\n\nwomen's clothes, kind of blowing the boundaries, I mean, kind of androgynous,\n\nif you like. I mean, I didn't wear breasts. I wasn't really trying to be a\n\nwoman. I was really contradicting all those sort of rigid ideas of what is\n\nmale and female.\n\nGROSS: What about the image of the rest of the band?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Oh, I did terrible things to them. I mean, I made them wear\n\nthings that they looked absolutely ridiculous in. Once I made Roy have white\n\ndreadlocks, which was a pretty hideous look. And then there was a time in\n\nJapan when I made them all wear these kind of very tight, sort of laco\n\nshorts(ph) with clip-on suspenders. That wasn't a particularly favorite look\n\nof theirs.\n\nGROSS: Now...\n\nBOY GEORGE: I was very bossy. I mean, I used to--I guess because they were\n\nkind of quite straightlaced, so I used to try and spice them up a bit and make\n\nthem look more interesting.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm. When you came to America and you had become a star here and\n\nyou started doing television shows here, shows that you didn't know, it must\n\nhave been an interesting experience. Like in your book, you write about being\n\non \"Live\" with Regis Philbin and what a disorientating experience that was.\n\nCould you tell us about that?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, when we arrived at the show, I couldn't believe all the\n\naudience were wearing flared trousers and wide lapel jackets and big, funky\n\ncolored shirts, you know, and we looked like space aliens. It was, like, so\n\nbizarre because we seemed like to be from another planet.\n\nGROSS: Now you did \"Solid Gold.\" And I thought it was really interesting.\n\nYou wouldn't let the \"Solid Gold\" dancers share the stage with you\n\nbecause--why?\n\nBOY GEORGE: I thought they were tacky, to be honest with you.\n\nGROSS: Well, I have to agree with you.\n\nBOY GEORGE: I mean, I felt that that whole setup of \"Solid Gold\" was a bit\n\n'70s, and we were all about doing something modern, something revolutionary,\n\nand I just thought that they jarred with our image.\n\nGROSS: So you really had the power to say, `Sorry, you can't use your own\n\ndancers on the show'?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, I said, `You can use them but just not behind us, thank\n\nyou.'\n\nGROSS: So...\n\nBOY GEORGE: I was a bit of a tyrant in those days, and I used to really pull\n\nweight a lot. I used to really get very uppity about things, and I would\n\nrefuse to do the show. I would just simply say, `Well, if they're on, we're\n\nnot,' you know? And, of course, I got away with it a lot of the time.\n\nGROSS: One year when you won a Grammy, you said--well, why don't you repeat\n\nwhat you said.\n\nBOY GEORGE: I said, `Thank you, America. You've got style and taste and you\n\nknow a good drag queen when you see one.'\n\nGROSS: Now how did you decide to say that?\n\nBOY GEORGE: It just kind of flew out of my mouth. I mean, it wasn't like I\n\nsat down and planned to say it.\n\nGROSS: Oh, you hadn't?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Oh, no, not at all. I mean, a lot of the things I say kind of\n\njust burst out, you know. And I remember after that, I was told that a lot of\n\nthe people from CBS Records who I was signed to at that time had fallen off\n\ntheir chairs and were, like, weeping and, you know, kind of dying in shock on\n\nthe floor. So I was quite pleased about that.\n\nGROSS: Did they say anything to you afterwards?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, I think--and I say this in the book--up until that point,\n\nmy sexuality had been kind of hovering in a huge question mark. And by saying\n\nI was a drag queen, I was kind of saying I was gay. So it really did change\n\nthings for me after that. I mean, it kind of signaled a kind of almost\n\nlike--you know, it was like--almost like the end of Culture Club because\n\npeople had always wanted to see me as this kind of sexless, inoffensive,\n\nexotic doll; and suddenly I was sort of being sexual and being provocative,\n\nand it really freaked people out.\n\nGROSS: So did it change your audiences' reaction to you?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, I did hear that there were kind of college debates about\n\nwhat I actually meant. You know, people did take it far more seriously, you\n\nknow, than was necessary. But I guess in those days, you know, it was quite a\n\nshocking thing. I mean, now you have drag queens on every kind of, you know,\n\nmovie you can see, and they're on the TV all the time. But at that time, I\n\nsuppose people found that shocking, you know?\n\nGROSS: You started using drugs after the band caught on. How did it change\n\nyour personality when you got involved with heroin?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, I think drugs really help you to escape, and a drug like\n\nheroin is almost like a womblike drug, you know? You're just completely cut\n\noff from your feelings. You don't care about anybody or anything, and you\n\nalmost have this kind of superior air about you that is, you know, hard to\n\nimagine unless you've done it.\n\nGROSS: You know, in your book you say that on tours you got into, you know,\n\ndestroying expensive hotel rooms...\n\nBOY GEORGE: No, never.\n\nGROSS: Oh, that's what I thought it said. No?\n\nBOY GEORGE: No, never did anything like that.\n\nGROSS: OK.\n\nBOY GEORGE: You know, when I was a kid, I used to get very upset watching\n\nLaurel and Hardy bust up these houses. It used to really upset me. I would\n\nnever ever do anything like that. I mean, that's something--I guess, you\n\nknow, coming from a quite poor family--you know, my mother really had to kind\n\nof scrape to get by, and she was very house proud, so I would never ever bust\n\nup a hotel, ever.\n\nGROSS: I'm really glad. I just think it's so spoiled to do that.\n\nBOY GEORGE: Oh, I've never done...\n\nGROSS: I hate it when rock stars do that.\n\nBOY GEORGE: Oh, no, I've never done that. Oh, no, no. Not me.\n\nGROSS: Now...\n\nBOY GEORGE: Ozzy Osbourne, but not me.\n\nGROSS: ...how did you end up kicking heroin?\n\nBOY GEORGE: Well, unfortunately, I lost two very close friends of mine, and\n\nthat was a real sharp shock because I realized if I carried on, I'd be next.\n\nAnd certainly, you know, I had the world's media on my back. I felt like\n\nalmost a rat in a corner. You know, I really didn't have any choice 'cause\n\neverybody was saying, `Please give up, you know? Pull yourself together.'\n\nAnd as I say, you know, losing my friend Michael and my friend Mark was really\n\nwhat I needed, and I'm sad to say that, you know, because there's not a day\n\nthat goes by that I don't think of them, you know...\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nBOY GEORGE: ...and wish I could turn back the clock, wish I could have done\n\nsomething, you know?\n\nBIANCULLI: Boy George speaking with Terry Gross in 1995. Let's hear his\n\nrendition of \"The Crying Game\" from the 1993 film.\n\nI'm David Bianculli. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nBOY GEORGE: (Singing) I know all there is to know about the crying game.\n\nI've had my share of the crying game. First, there are kisses. Then there\n\nare sighs, and then before you know where you are, you're sayin' goodbye. One\n\nday soon I'm going to tell the moon about the crying game, and if he knows,\n\nmaybe he'll explain...\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nProfile: Uncle Tupelo's brief but successful stint as a band\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, in for Terry Gross.\n\nNot many bands have managed to ignite a new rock movement and break up four\n\nyears after their first album comes out, but Uncle Tupelo did. In exploring\n\nthe reissues of their four albums, Ed Ward tells the story of the band who\n\nmade alt-country a household word, in some households.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nUNCLE TUPELO: (Singing) Down here where we're at, weather changes, that's the\n\nway it goes. Sometimes it snows when everything's wrong. Sometimes it snows,\n\nbut when it does, it doesn't last long.\n\nED WARD reporting:\n\nSometimes a band is in the right place at the right time. That's what\n\nhappened to Jeff Tweedy, Jay Farrar and Mike Heidorn, three high-school\n\nfriends from Belleville, Illinois, who started playing together in 1984, and\n\nfive years later, had become a fairly successful local attraction. They\n\nstarted out playing, basically, their record collections, but soon started\n\nwriting their own material. They found it went over well enough that they\n\nwere touring as far as St. Louis and Indianapolis, opening shows for local\n\nand national acts. Taking some random words on a piece of paper, they came up\n\nwith the name Uncle Tupelo, and a friend immediately drew a sketch of an aging\n\nElvis, sitting in a chair with a can of beer and a TV remote to go with it.\n\nThey recorded some homemade cassettes to sell at gigs, and pretty soon, CMJ, a\n\ntip sheet for college radio, was championing them. They were just one of\n\nhundreds of bands with essentially the same story, but there was something\n\ndifferent about them.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nUNCLE TUPELO: (Singing) Oh, dear, the hearts of men are failing. These are\n\nlatter days, we know. Great depression now is spreading, God's word declared\n\nit would be so. I'm going where there's no depression, to a better land\n\nthat's free from care. I'll leave this world of toil and trouble, my home's\n\nin heaven, I'm going there.\n\nWARD: Somehow, Uncle Tupelo had latched onto something deep in America's\n\nroots, as the title song of their first album, \"No Depression,\" shows. It's a\n\nCarter Family tune from the '30s that they learned from the New Lost City\n\nRamblers, a folk band of the early '60s, delivered with a passion that spoke\n\nto their young audiences as much as the more conventional stuff they did.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nUNCLE TUPELO: (Singing) What's going ...(unintelligible) walking about, would\n\nlike to change your point of view somewhere, but I feel my patience slipping\n\naway. Looks like it's ...(unintelligible) burned down, stop messing around.\n\nDon't want to go to the grave without a sound, and it's all (unintelligible)\n\nrest, not to ...(unintelligible).\n\nWARD: The connection with CMJ had gotten them invited to the magazine's\n\nyearly convention in New York, where a tiny Boston label, Rockville, had seen\n\nand signed them. On the heels of their first album, they toured extensively\n\naround the country, and by mid-1990, when they appeared in Rolling Stone's New\n\nFaces issue, they'd begun to amass a serious fan base. As every indie band\n\nhad to do, they spent most of their time on the road, so that it wasn't until\n\nthe middle of next year that they returned to Boston to record a second album.\n\nThis would, they decided, be all originals, to show that they were serious\n\nsongwriters.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nUNCLE TUPELO: (Singing) Climbing out the window, tripping (unintelligible)\n\nwhen we get back. Don't tell me which way ...(unintelligible) what\n\n(unintelligible) it's my heart, it's ...(unintelligible) gun, but it's\n\nunloaded now, so don't fire. Climbing out the window...\n\nWARD: \"Still Feel Gone,\" as the album was called, featured a couple of\n\noutside musicians, most notably, Gary Louris, from their area's other\n\nsuccessful band, the Jayhawks, on guitar. He filled out the sound on record,\n\nbut it was the trio who kept on the road, eating up the miles in their van.\n\nDuring this period, they played the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia, and\n\nR.E.M.'s Peter Buck came backstage to congratulate them on their performance\n\nof an old Louvin Brothers song.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nUNCLE TUPELO: (Singing) Do you fear this man's invention that they call\n\natomic power, we all in great confusion ...(unintelligible) know the time or\n\nhour when a terrible explosion may rain down upon our land, leaving horrible\n\ndestruction, blotting out the world ...(unintelligible). Are you, are you\n\nready for that great atomic power? You'll rise and meet your Savior in the\n\nair. Will you shout or will you cry when the fire is from on high? Are you\n\nready for that great atomic power?\n\nWARD: Buck was the first fan who'd known where the song had come from, and\n\nthe band instantly decided among themselves that he should produce their next\n\nalbum. This one, they decided, would be mostly acoustic and, in a way, that\n\nwas good because Mike Heidorn, newly married and with a full-time job now, had\n\ndecided to quit the band. The material would be half originals and half\n\ntraditional or older material. And astonishingly, the band punched out the\n\nentire album in a studio near Buck's house in Athens in less than a week, a\n\nfeat commemorated in its title, \"March 16 to 20, 1992.\"\n\nThe connection with R.E.M. also drew attention and, having proven themselves\n\nas performers, songwriters and record-makers, Uncle Tupelo was courted and\n\nsigned by Sire Records not long afterwards. With new drummer Ken Coomer\n\nalready on deck, they added a bassist, John Stirratt, and\n\nmulti-instrumentalist Max Johnston, who played a bunch of country instruments.\n\n\"Anodyne\" the Sire album, was to be their last. Recorded in Austin, Texas, in\n\nthe spring of 1993, it had cameo appearances from steel guitar virtuoso Lloyd\n\nMaynes, and the spirit of Texas music himself, Doug Sahm. It also featured\n\nsome of the most personal and bitter lyrics the band had ever recorded.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nUNCLE TUPELO: (Singing) ...(Unintelligible) on your own where you\n\n(unintelligible) and where you're going. I know these things\n\n(unintelligible). ...(Unintelligible) dreams that never ...(unintelligible).\n\nI couldn't help you then, I guess I can't help you now. ...(unintelligible)\n\npleasure, pleasure is way out of hand. The time is right ...(unintelligible)\n\nChickamauga's way out there, solitude is where I'm bound. I don't ever want\n\nto face those tears again. I don't ever want to face those tears again.\n\nAppalachia...\n\nWARD: Not long afterwards, Jay Farrar left the band, and Jeff Tweedy took\n\nseveral of the remaining musicians and started another band called Wilco.\n\nFarrar's band, Son Volt, lasted a few years; he now records solo. Wilco, of\n\ncourse, made 2002's astonishing \"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\" album, and Farrar's\n\nalbum, \"Sebastopol,\" is one of my favorite records of recent years.\n\nUncle Tupelo gave a new vocabulary to American rock, and each of its two\n\nleaders went on to bigger and better things. Not all rock 'n' roll stories\n\nhave sad endings.\n\nBIANCULLI: Rock historian Ed Ward lives in Berlin.\n\nComing up, photographer Marion Ettlinger. A book of her photos of authors has\n\njust been published.\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Marion Ettlinger describes how she prefers to\n\nphotograph her subjects\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, host:\n\nMarion Ettlinger is famous in the literary world for her book jacket\n\nphotographs. Now she has a book of her own, a collection of her portraits\n\ncalled \"Author Photo.\" Truman Capote, Joyce Carol Oates, Raymond Carver, Ann\n\nPatchett, Edmund White, Robert Stone, Cormac McCarthy, Richard Russo and Sarah\n\nVowell are among the many writers she's photographed. She's known for her\n\nbrooding, introspective portraits. Ettlinger started photographing authors in\n\n1983 when she was hired by Esquire magazine to do portraits of 45 authors and\n\njournalists who had contributed to the magazine's 50th anniversary issue.\n\nTerry spoke with Ettlinger last year and asked her if there was a unifying\n\nlook to her work.\n\nMs. MARION ETTLINGER (Photographer): Well, the most important aspect that I\n\nstrive for in a portrait is that the person is present in the portrait, that\n\nthey are there. And it's extremely interesting when I review my contact\n\nsheets at various times and there are 30 images in a row that are virtually\n\nidentical in terms of the pose and the setup and everything, and the\n\nvariations really might come from the most subtle expressions in the face of\n\nthe person. And in one frame, they're there; they're utterly present, and the\n\nnext frame, they're kind of not. They're just--they've drifted. And that's\n\nnot to say that drifting can't also be something that is lovely and that you\n\nwant to use, but that sense of presence is really key to me.\n\nAnd also, especially with authors, I like to bring out the effect and to make\n\nthem look smart and soulful and maybe sexy.\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nWell...\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: And often, the first two might just, you know, make the third\n\none a certainty.\n\nGROSS: Why sexy? Why does a writer need to look sexy?\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: They don't need to look sexy, but I guess if you're in the\n\ncamp that you find smart and soulful sexy, then they just will.\n\nGROSS: Now a lot of your photos of writers, the writers look very kind\n\nof--the men look kind of hard-boiled; there's a certain drama about the women.\n\nWhat if a writer shows up and they're really just kind of shlumpy, you know?\n\nAnd to really capture the essence of this person would be a photograph of a\n\nshlumpy-looking person.\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: What are you going to do? Are you going to go for the shlumpy, or are\n\nyou going to, like, rework it so that you've got that drama or the\n\nhard-boiled? Do you know what I mean?\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: Well, maybe I can't go from shlumpy to hard-boiled, but I\n\nthink even the shlumpiest of us have our better moments, and that's what I'm\n\nlooking for.\n\nGROSS: And, I mean, how do you find it?\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: You know, you just look for it. You just--like, you know,\n\nsome people in their prephoto nervous state might say, `Oh, you know, I'm\n\nreally not photogenic. Trust me,' and, you know, want me to know that. And I\n\nunderstand that because, you know, I think there is such a thing as\n\nphotogenic, and I think a few people have that. But I think most people don't\n\nhave that. In other words, what I'm trying to say is that being photogenic is\n\nnot required because I think everybody can be photographed well or not so\n\nwell, and if you're photogenic, well, that's just like gravy. But you know,\n\nanybody can be photographed, the best version of themselves. Even a shlumpy\n\nperson has a range.\n\nGROSS: Let's look at some of the photos that you've taken. You have a photo\n\nof Truman Capote in which he's in profile and looking up. It's a very odd\n\nangle, and his mouth is kind of turned down into a frown. Talk about that\n\npose.\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: He--it was a shoot for a magazine, and he consented to do the\n\nshoot with the request that the office of the magazine, which was Esquire, by\n\nthe way, would inform him three days before the shoot and remind him that this\n\nwas happening, two days before the shoot and remind him, the day before and on\n\nthe day. And so they did that. I was on the road, and they kept up with me\n\nand telling me that he was with the program except for the day of the shoot\n\nwhere they couldn't get hold of him. But they said, `Go ahead, go anyway.'\n\nAnd I went there and knocked on the door and there was nobody home.\n\nAnd I went away for a while, and when I came back, I was driving up the\n\ndriveway and a car was coming out of the driveway. And we stopped and rolled\n\ndown the windows and a friend of his--I believe it was Jack Dunphy--said,\n\n`Hello.' And I said, `Hi, I'm here to photograph Mr. Capote.' And he said,\n\n`Good luck,' and he rolled up the window and drove away. So I went, `Hmm,\n\nthat doesn't bode well.'\n\nAnd I drove up to the house--and this was early on in my work life, as I might\n\nhave mentioned. And as I was getting out of the car, Truman came running and\n\nscreaming out of the house, waving his fists in the air like--it was very\n\ncartoon style--and screaming about this was the wrong day and he can't be\n\nbothered with this and Esquire, you know, why'd they send him such an amateur\n\nand, you know, pretty much terrorizing me.\n\nAnd then as I was quivering, he said, `Start now or get out of here,'\n\nbasically. So I went, `OK.' And standing there, I just started to photograph\n\nhim; and the first frames are him just glaring at me. So maybe to relieve\n\nmyself from that gaze, I asked him to turn in profile. And he turned in\n\nprofile, and as he did that, he started to do this extraordinary thing where\n\nhe just started to lift his head and raise his chin, and he started to look\n\ntruly magnificent. And I suppose I murmured some words of encouragement, and\n\nhe continued to do that and held that. And I took the rest of them that way,\n\nand when he heard the last shot being made, he said, `That's it. Goodbye,'\n\nand walked back into the house.\n\nAnd the great art lesson that he taught me was that--well, prior to him, I had\n\nonly known courtesy, cooperation and all kinds of nice stuff, and I just\n\nassumed that those things were crucial in order to get a good result. And he\n\ntaught me that that's not necessarily true and that if you go with what's\n\nhappening, something much more interesting and more beautiful might happen as\n\na result of that.\n\nGROSS: Sarah Vowell, you took her author photo.\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: And this is a very tight close-up of her face. She's kind of like\n\nsurrounded by darkness, but her face is illuminated, and it's a very kind of\n\nsober, almost grave expression on her face. And whereas her writing is very\n\nfunny and her writing is so much about being, like, neurotic and nerdy, and\n\nher look is so different in this photo than her sound or, I think, than her\n\nimage in person.\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: I had never seen her before she entered, and I had a very\n\nspecific image of her in my mind, which was not what she looked like at all,\n\njust even in terms of being fair or dark and all that. I have always detected\n\na dark side to Sarah's work despite her incredible wit and her offbeat take on\n\nthings; and in person, I found her a very serious person.\n\nGROSS: So that's why you wanted to go for that more serious look?\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: Well, I think, in general, my work has a somber quality to it.\n\nAnd it's true, and in the case of somebody who's written, you know, a\n\nhilarious novel, then I try to get that twinkle or levity in the eye, but it\n\ndidn't quite happen with the photo of her.\n\nGROSS: I think one of the most difficult things for somebody who's getting\n\nphotographed by a professional photographer for a publicity shot, for a book\n\nor whatever other reason, is that it's almost like a fashion shoot in the\n\nsense that you're almost like a professional model. You have to be there\n\nposing sometimes for hours.\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: Right.\n\nGROSS: Off and on for hours. And if you're not a professional model, that's\n\nreally quite a strain to be under the gaze of a camera for that extended\n\namount of time and to have any sense of focus or affect after that.\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: Are you speaking from personal experience?\n\nGROSS: Well, I am, actually. I've had to take--not for a book, but I've had\n\nto take publicity shots and...\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...I just find it exhausting and trying. And I'm not good at smiling\n\non demand, so if a photographer says, `OK, smile.' I mean...\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: Well...\n\nGROSS: ...sure, I can make those lips move, you know, in the imitation of a\n\nsmile, but it's really not going to be very convincing.\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: Well, I don't permit smiling. So that--let's get that\n\nstraight.\n\nGROSS: Oh, you don't even permit it. Tell me about that.\n\nMs. ETTLINGER: Well, I mean, I guess I don't--although, you know, when I look\n\nat my contact sheets, eventually something will have happened during the shoot\n\nthat makes a person laugh or smile, and it's a thing of beauty, of course.\n\nBut what I'm going for--see, I feel like that is a lovely thing and perhaps\n\nhas more of a place in the history of the person and more of a personal photo.\n\nBut I think for something, like, kind of going for more of a, I suppose,\n\niconic moment or image, I feel like a grin kind of, in the best sense of the\n\nword, distorts the face and distracts a little bit from the structure that I'm\n\nso interested in.\n\nNow that's not to say that--I'm trying to save the photos from grimness most\n\nof the time. I do like them to be serious. But that doesn't mean that I\n\ndon't welcome, like, levity and wit and all those good things to come through\n\nthe face, but I think they can come through just fine short of a big grin. I\n\nthink they can come through the musculature of the face and--it's corny to\n\nsay--but through the eyes and just in the expression. And that will happen,\n\nhopefully, during the course of the shoot when somebody feels slightly amused\n\nor something. And if it's not there, I might add for a drop of it if I need\n\nit for a certain thing. But I never say, `Smile.'\n\nBIANCULLI: Marion Ettlinger, speaking with Terry Gross last year. A\n\ncollection of her book jacket portraits has just been published, called\n\n\"Author Photo: Portraits, 1983-2002.\"\n\nComing up, David Edelstein reviews \"Love Actually.\"\n\nI'm David Bianculli. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: New romantic comedy \"Love Actually\"\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, host:\n\nRichard Curtis wrote for the British TV series \"Blackadder\" and \"Mr. Bean\"\n\nbefore he wrote the romantic comedy films \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\"\n\n\"Notting Hill\" and \"Bridget Jones's Diary.\" He makes his directorial debut\n\nwith \"Love Actually,\" a romantic comedy with innumerable strands and a huge\n\ncast of English and American stars. David Edelstein...\n\nDAVID EDELSTEIN reporting:\n\nWriter-director Richard Curtis is brilliant at many things, but his genius is\n\nfor characters who humiliate themselves. He is the bard of embarrassment. He\n\ngives us a universe of blurters, men and women who come out with how they\n\nreally feel, then freeze, mortified at what they've said but bound to stammer\n\non. Left alone, they curse themselves for being fools, but they do it again.\n\nThat's why we love them, especially when they embarrass themselves in the name\n\nof love.\n\n\"Love Actually\" is a festival of embarrassment, and appropriately enough, it's\n\nhalf delightful, half embarrassing. The title comes from the old Troggs song,\n\n\"Love is All Around,\" and the movie's original title was \"Love Actually is All\n\nAround.\" It begins with a prologue in which Hugh Grant spells this out over a\n\nmontage of people in airports hugging, and it ends with a montage of people in\n\nairports hugging. All told, there are more hugs per square inch of celluloid\n\nthan in all the Christmas movies in all the world.\n\nThere's more everything in this movie, more stars, more cameos, more crises,\n\nmore climaxes. There are nine love stories, with a couple of sub-love stories\n\nbranching off, and they all run concurrently, and sometimes interlace, but the\n\nplots don't really illuminate one another. This is more like a giant echo\n\nchamber in which love songs are poured into the gaps like treacle.\n\nI can't possibly tell you about every actor, plot and cameo, but Hugh Grant\n\ndoes his usual adorable, English `aw shucks' thing, as the new bachelor\n\nBritish prime minister who's promptly smitten by Martine McCutcheon as a\n\nradiant working-class aide who everyone but him thinks is too plump.\n\nEmma Thompson is the PM's sister. She and husband Alan Rickman have settled\n\ninto a dull middle age, but he's contemplating a fling with his eager `hotcha'\n\nsecretary, Heike Makatsch. Rickman works with Laura Linney, a love-smitten\n\nAmerican whose sometimes violent schizophrenic brother, umbilically connected\n\nto her via her cell phone, makes other relationships dicey.\n\nColin Firth is a cuckolded novelist who heads for a French villa and tumbles\n\nfor his Portuguese cleaning lady, Lucia Moniz. Neither speaks a word of the\n\nother's language, but the subtitles tell us they're reading each other's\n\nminds.\n\nAnd Liam Neeson is a grieving widower whose Haley Joel Osment-like son has\n\nbecome obsessed with a girl in his school.\n\nThese and other plots are rendered deftly, but Curtis' need to move things\n\nalong at all costs results in a lot of emotional shortcuts, and some of the\n\nserious threats--the schizophrenic brother, the grieving husband, a reference\n\nto 9/11--feel cheap and exploitive. There is, fortunately, a comic wild card,\n\na burned-out rocker called Billy Mack, whose last-ditch attempt at a\n\nnumber-one record is a variation on \"Love is All Around,\" with `love' replaced\n\nby `Christmas.' Billy is played by the sepulchral Bill Nighy. That's spelled\n\nN-I-G-H-Y. You'll know why he owns this movie when you hear this scene, set\n\nin an exurban radio station.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Love Actually\")\n\nUnidentified Actor: (As Mike) Billy, welcome back to the airwaves. New\n\nChristmas single cover of \"Love is All Around.\"\n\nMr. BILL NIGHY: (As Billy Mack) Except we've changed the word `love' to\n\n`Christmas.'\n\nUnidentified Actor: (As Mike) Yes. Is that an important message to you,\n\nBill?\n\nMr. NIGHY: (As Billy Mack) Not really, Mike. Christmas is a time for people\n\nwith someone they love in their lives.\n\nUnidentified Actor: (As Mike) That's not you?\n\nMr. NIGHY: (As Billy Mack) That's not me, Michael. When I was young and\n\nsuccessful, I was greedy and foolish, and now I'm left with no one, wrinkled\n\nand alone.\n\nUnidentified Actor: (As Mike) Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.\n\nMr. NIGHY: (As Billy Mack) For what?\n\nUnidentified Actor: (As Mike) Well, for actually giving a real answer to a\n\nquestion. Doesn't often happen here at Radio Watford, I can tell you.\n\nMr. NIGHY: (As Billy Mack) Ask me anything you like, and I'll tell you the\n\ntruth.\n\nUnidentified Actor: (As Mike) What's the best sex you've ever had?\n\nMr. NIGHY: (As Billy Mack) Britney Spears. No, only kidding. She was\n\nrubbish.\n\nEDELSTEIN: Billy Mack finds love, though not with Britney Spears, and not in\n\nthe way you expect.\n\nA couple of other stories end grimly or unresolved, and there's one in which\n\nlove stays unrequited. But the prevailing tone is fairy-tale, with a\n\ncharacter's sadness and aloneness a prelude to some magical act of communion.\n\nCurtis' other movies climax with a hitherto hesitant lover making a mad dash\n\nto the airport to stop the beloved from getting on a plane. Imagine four or\n\nfive mad dashes and a host of intercut public declarations, all with the most\n\ngod-awful music pouring from the screen.\n\nI love Richard Curtis, but can't help but feel that the bard of embarrassment\n\ncould use a touch more shame.\n\nBIANCULLI: David Edelstein is film critic for FRESH AIR and the online\n\nmagazine Slate.\n\n(Credits)"
