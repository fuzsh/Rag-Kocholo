        "text": "I’ve never been very keen on what is commonly considered ‘running music’. Compilations such as Now! That’s What I Call Running and Spotify running playlists usually have some good classic tracks on them, but they also tend to contain the kind of music you hear in the gym – endless high-energy electro dance music, with the idea being that it makes you run faster. I am a slow runner – for the record, the song that most frequently gets stuck in my head during long runs is Duran Duran’s Come Undone, which gives you an idea of the kind of pace I go at. As such, my running playlist is a little more sedate, focuses on iconic running themes rather than speed – and, like most of my playlists, has a high quotient of ’80s hits. Let’s go!\n\n10. Bryan Adams – Run To You\n\nIf it was a hit in the ’80s and it’s got ‘run’ in the title, you can bet that it will end up on my running playlist at some point.\n\nThe video for this one features a lot of footprints in the snow, meaning that the invisible runner who left them is a lot more hardcore than me! I don’t go out running in ice and snow (it’s dangerous and slippy), preferring to stick to my nice indoor treadmill during winter weather.\n\n9. Bill Conti – Gonna Fly Now\n\nThe Rocky theme is one of those iconic pieces that always shows up whenever someone on TV does a parody training montage. Get running up those steps!\n\nHere’s a clip from the film with the music – lots of running around disused railway tracks and so on. In most things I believe the ’80s to be absolutely supreme, but I am glad that we’ve since invented proper technical materials so that we don’t have to wear full cotton tracksuits to go running in the winter anymore!\n\n8. Matthew Wilder – Break My Stride\n\nThis chirpy, upbeat theme was played at the end of the BBC’s London Marathon coverage a couple of years ago, thus reminding me to add it to my running playlist. Whoever’s in charge of the coverage always picks a really good song for the ending.\n\nThere’s no official video for the song, but this Top of the Pops clip is absolutely classic ’80s TOTP – shiny sets, balloons being bounced everywhere, audience members making every effort with their fabulous outfits!\n\n7. Heaven 17 – Let Me Go\n\nI discussed this lovely eerie, classic-phone-laden video in a dedicated post earlier this year – it’s actually the video that merited the song’s inclusion on the running playlist, because of Glenn Gregory’s slo-mo running away from nothing in particular past the National Westminster Bank!\n\n6. Jon & Vangelis – I’ll Find My Way Home\n\nAnother track that was used for the BBC’s London Marathon coverage, and another track where the TOTP clip will have to substitute for the video. This one is a slightly more serious performance, with proper musical instruments and a set that strangely reminds me of an Italian restaurant.\n\n5. A Flock Of Seagulls – I Ran\n\nLike Let Me Go above, this track was never actually a Top 40 hit in the UK, though it’s stayed in the popular consciousness over the intervening thirty-odd years. That title ensures its inclusion on the playlist!\n\nThe video, which on paper is just the band performing in a room, is a classic due to its highly ’80s effects, which involve a lot of mirrors and tinfoil. I love the fact that tinfoil was once considered respectable set dressing! (See also: almost every episode of ’80s Doctor Who.)\n\n4. Journey – Don’t Stop Believin’\n\nI hear this at every race – of particular note is the band that plays at approximately mile eight of the Great North Run. I have heard them play Don’t Stop Believin’ every single year I’ve run the race! I assume they just stand there playing it over and over for the four hours it takes every runner to go past.\n\nThere was never an official video made for this one, so the video that music channels always show is this live performance from Houston. It really captures the atmosphere of big arena shows at the time.\n\n3. Kate Bush – Running Up That Hill\n\nHills I regularly do where this song comes into my head include the hill you have to do twice during Pendle parkrun, the ‘Slog on the Tyne’ at the Great North 10k, and Arthur’s Seat during the EMF 10k. However, they all pale in comparison to the hill I was running up during my first summer of training in 2015, when I was on holiday in France. You’d need those godlike powers that Kate sings about to manage that one with any speed!\n\nThe video is more about artistic dancing than running, but it’s very pretty.\n\n2. Mark Knopfler – Local Hero\n\nThis is a really emotional one because it’s a Newcastle anthem that is always played on the start line of the Great North Run (to celebrate the 60,000 people who run it as well as Knopfler himself, who grew up in Newcastle and is thus a ‘local hero’ round these parts).\n\nThere’s no official video, but here’s a live video from a Sydney concert during the classic Dire Straits period in 1986…\n\n…and a bonus video that was filmed by an audience member a few weeks ago when Mark Knopfler played the Newcastle Arena, so you can hear the Geordie audience’s reaction. I didn’t go to this show because I’ve already spent out on gigs this year (and also I’m not a fan of his ’90s solo stuff due to my parents constantly playing it on long car journeys when I was a kid).\n\n1. Vangelis – Chariots Of Fire\n\nThe ultimate iconic slo-mo running music! Originally composed for the Chariots Of Fire film in 1982, it’s since been used in a thousand homages and parodies, and is often played at races (it was played when I ran into Gateshead Stadium as the very last runner in the 2016 Great North 10k, which remains possibly my favourite ever running moment).\n\nThe video is mostly clips from the film, but there’s also a lot of shots of Vangelis playing piano and fiddling with his synthesisers while chain-smoking (continuing that super healthy athletic theme!).\n\nBonus ’90s track: Duran Duran – Come Undone\n\nI mentioned this one at the start of the post, and I highly recommend it for fellow slow runners! A lovely sedate tune for ambling along to during a long run.\n\nThe pretty aquarium-set video is always worth a watch too!\n\nMore music videos next Monday.\n\nNow! #102 has been released today, 12th April 2019! EDIT: I only just realised that it’s been a whole year today since I started my marathon of the first 100 Now! compilations with Now! #1. Great timing!\n\nLet’s have a look at the Now! compilers’ roundup of what’s been going on in the chart recently.\n\nTrack 1: Ariana Grande – 7 Rings\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nStill think this is a bit of a daft interpolation, but I don’t hate it as much as I used to.\n\nTrack 2: Ava Max – Sweet But Psycho\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nPretty much loved this bit of synthy pop from the start, and I’m still a big fan. Should have been Christmas number one!\n\nTrack 3: Mark Ronson and Miley Cyrus – Nothing Breaks Like A Heart\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nAnother great pop track. At first I wasn’t keen on the country edge, but I’ve really grown to love this one.\n\nTrack 4: Calvin Harris and Rag ‘N’ Bone Man – Giant\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nI’m still not a huge fan of this one – it just doesn’t hook me.\n\nTrack 5: Pink – Walk Me Home\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nStill too acoustic-y for me, but I have grown to like the epic feel on the chorus.\n\nTrack 6: Sam Smith and Normani – Dancing With A Stranger\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nI originally felt this one was a bit generic, but it’s become a fairly regular earworm for me, and I find I quite like it now.\n\nTrack 7: Tom Walker – Just You And I\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nIt’s a little cheesy, but it’s a pleasant upbeat tune.\n\nTrack 8: Jonas Brothers – Sucker\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nA decade ago, I would not have believed you if you’d told me I would ever grow to like a Jonas Brothers song. They’ve grown up now, though, and they make much better music. This is a fairly decent pop song, and I always nod along when it’s on the radio.\n\nTrack 9: George Ezra – Pretty Shining People\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nI still can’t get over the blatant REM title ripoff. Urgh.\n\nThis one’s a little bland (can’t win ’em all, George), but it’s an okay tune.\n\nTrack 10: James Arthur – Empty Space\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nThis one’s not been in the charts since last year, so I’m a bit surprised they’ve held it back for this Now! instalment. As is usually the case with James Arthur’s stuff, it’s too saccharine for me, but I’ll grant you it’s got a good atmosphere on the chorus.\n\nTrack 11: Lewis Capaldi – Grace\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nI first heard this one on the BBC over Christmas, and at first I thought it was a bit too wistful/singer-songwriter/acoustic-y etc. for me. But I’ve really come to like it – it’s a gorgeous tune.\n\nTrack 12: Jason Derulo, David Guetta, Nicki Minaj and Willy William – Goodbye\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nI could have told you that my feelings would not have changed about this ridiculous bastardisation of Andrea Bocelli’s Time To Say Goodbye. Awful interpolation that has me running screaming for the comfort of the original every single time.\n\nTrack 13: Little Mix and Ty Dolla Sign – Think About Us\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nAnother frequent earworm. I quite like the staccato on the verse.\n\nTrack 14: Marshmello and Chvrches – Here With Me\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nI find this one a bit forgettable, though the tune is very pleasant when I do remember how it goes.\n\nTrack 15: Cardi B and Bruno Mars – Please Me\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nStill love the retro feel on this track. Straight out of 1988! Well, apart from the NSFW lyrical content.\n\nTrack 16: Khalid – Talk\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nI really like the soft bubbly synth effects on this one.\n\nTrack 17: Mabel – Don’t Call Me Up\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nI wasn’t keen at first, but it’s been a grower and I quite like this solid pop track now.\n\nTrack 18: Charli XCX and Troye Sivan – 1999\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nLiked it when it came out, love it now! Shamelessly retro, actually sounds like the year it’s celebrating. Great stuff.\n\nTrack 19: Sigrid – Don’t Feel Like Crying\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nAnother good danceable pop track, probably my favourite of Sigrid’s output so far.\n\nTrack 20: CamelPhat, Cristoph and Jem Cooke – Breathe\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nIt’s kind of nice to have a dance track on here now that dance tracks are becoming a bit rarer in the charts. Nice tune, too.\n\nTrack 21: Jax Jones and Years & Years – Play\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nGood tune – I always nod along to this one.\n\nTrack 22: Zedd and Katy Perry – 365\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nI do like the Spanish-tinged opening, and the atmosphere is great when it gets to the chorus.\n\nTrack 23: Zara Larsson – Ruin My Life\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nThis one makes me really uncomfortable! I can’t get past the awful message in the lyrics, which is basically ‘go back to someone who’s really bad for you’.\n\nTrack 24: Dua Lipa – Swan Song\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nThere’s some great stuff going on with the instrumentals, but I find the vocal line pretty bland.\n\nTrack 25: Ariana Grande – Thank You Next\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nRepeated artist alert! We’ve already had Ariana Grande on track 1.\n\nThe tinkly instrumentals are quite nice, but I’m not sure how I feel about the ex-dissing lyrical content.\n\nTrack 26: Lewis Capaldi – Someone You Loved\n\nNew Hits Friday review. (LOL I said it was too slow for me and now it’s my favourite song in the chart!)\n\nRepeated artist alert! We’ve already had Lewis Capaldi on track 11.\n\nNot complaining though, because this is an absolutely beautiful tune that has deservedly just scored a seventh week at number one. Song of the year, whatever happens in the next eight months.\n\nTrack 27: Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper – Shallow\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nOne of those tracks that I found a bit slow to begin with and have grown to appreciate. Lovely acoustic track from the A Star Is Born soundtrack (no interest in seeing the film, but the song is gorgeous).\n\nTrack 28: Keala Settle and The Greatest Showman Cast – This Is Me\n\nAnother one where the Now! compilers have been a bit tardy – this track first entered the charts well over a year ago – but it’s a great feelgood musical number, and probably the best song on the soundtrack.\n\nTrack 29: Jess Glynne – Thursday\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nI’m still not particularly keen on this one – I just find the theme a bit awkward.\n\nTrack 30: Freya Ridings – Lost Without You\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nI do appreciate the simplicity of the song, but it’s just a bit too slow for me.\n\nTrack 31: James Arthur and Anne-Marie – Rewrite The Stars\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nRepeated artist alert! We’ve already had James Arthur on track 10.\n\nOne of the tracks from the Greatest Showman Reimagined album, where pop stars do karaoke versions of the songs from the musical. It’s okay, but not a patch on the original.\n\nTrack 32: Jack Savoretti – Candlelight\n\nThis wasn’t a hit – it only got to number 70. As I’ve been discussing since Now! #99, the Now! compilers have recently started to include songs that haven’t actually made the Top 40, but have been featured on hit albums – there’s less crossover than there used to be between the album and singles chart (mainly because the former is for older people like me who prefer classic pop and rock, and the latter is for the kids who like these strange new songs I’m always ranting about on here after listening to the chart on Fridays!). I wasn’t sure about this at first, but I think I’m okay about it now. After all, it’s probably an older demographic who actually still buys Now! albums. The Radio 2 demographic, if you like. This album got to number one, so I think it’s allowed.\n\nAnyway, this track’s got a great atmosphere – lovely eerie instrumentals, lots of piano. Love this kind of epic tune!\n\nTrack 33: The 1975 – It’s Not Living (If It’s Not With You)\n\nAgain not a hit on the singles chart – it only got to number 46 – but this was also a number one album.\n\nWonderfully retro-sounding as ever from the 1975. Great tune, great beat.\n\nTrack 34: Westlife – Hello My Love\n\nNew Hits Friday review.\n\nThis one’s still a bit too cheesy for me.\n\nTrack 35: Take That – Everlasting\n\nThis track wasn’t even released as a single, but again the album got to number one.\n\nAs I understand it, this is one of the few new tracks on Take That’s recent remastered retrospective. It’s a bit dull until the second chorus kicks in. Also, the self-referential spoken word bit at the end is a bit odd.\n\nTrack 36: Hozier – Almost (Sweet Music)\n\nThe single only got to number 82, but the album went top ten, getting to number six.\n\nGreat bit of soft rock – really like this one.\n\nTrack 37: Bryan Adams – Shine A Light\n\nNo single release for this song, but the album got to number two.\n\nGreat beat, but it’s a little too acoustic-y for me. Nice to see Bryan Adams still rockin’ up Now! compilations though.\n\nTrack 38: Michael Bublé – Love You Anymore\n\nAgain no single release, but it was a number one album.\n\nAs usual for Bublé, it’s far too saccharine for me, but it is nice and feelgood.\n\nTrack 39: Rod Stewart – Look In Her Eyes\n\nYet another one that wasn’t released as a single, but the album went to number one.\n\nLove this danceable, atmospheric song! So yeah, this is the point where I’m officially on board with the Now! compilers including songs-from-hit-albums that didn’t make the singles chart, because the notion of Rod Stewart still managing to get his new songs onto Now! compilations is the BESTEST THING.\n\nTrack 40: Hugh Jackman, Keala Settle, Zac Efron, Zendaya and The Greatest Showman Cast – The Greatest Show\n\nRepeated artist alert! We’ve already had the Greatest Showman cast on track 28.\n\nGreat stompalong number though. Fab track.\n\nTrack 41: Frankie Goes To Hollywood – Relax\n\nWe’ve already had this track on Now! #2! How dare they be so lazy…wait. I can’t really start ranting in this case, because what’s going on here is that the Now! compilers have chosen to include six tracks from Now! #2 in order to advertise the fact that it’s had a re-release on CD today, the same release day as Now! #102. I’m hopeful that this pattern will continue, and will be scouting out the re-release for my collection this weekend!\n\nAnyway, see the link for my review – it was track 16 on Now! #2.\n\nTrack 42: Nik Kershaw – Wouldn’t It Be Good\n\nStill a classic from Nik Kershaw.\n\nSee my review on Now! #2 – track 2.\n\nTrack 43: Matthew Wilder – Break My Stride\n\nI have this one on my running playlist these days!\n\nSee my review on Now! #2 – track 11.\n\nTrack 44: Cyndi Lauper – Girls Just Want To Have Fun\n\nOne of my earliest ’80s favourites.\n\nSee my review on Now! #2 – track 9.\n\nTrack 45: Culture Club – It’s A Miracle\n\nStill love that daft boardgaming video!\n\nSee my review on Now! #2 – track 25.\n\nTrack 46: Thompson Twins – Hold Me Now\n\nIf you spend any time watching the Now! ’80s channel, which often replays the classic TV adverts for the classic ’80s Now! compilations, you will be familiar with this song as the centrepiece for the Now! #2 advert due to it’s ‘hold me now‘ (geddit?) refrain on the chorus. Still a great track, and it was a highlight when I saw Tom Bailey supporting Culture Club in November.\n\nSee my review on Now! #2 – track 3.\n\nGreat choices for those bonus tracks. Could have done with a bit of love for Duran Duran’s New Moon On Monday (track 29) but I’m hopeful for The Reflex if they do this again when they re-release Now! #3!\n\nDay 48 means Now! #48, which was released on 9th April 2001.\n\nWikipedia has an interesting factoid about Now! #48: it is the favourite album of the character Kayleigh from Peter Kay’s Car Share (NO SPOILERS FOR THAT PLEASE, I know the final special episode aired last night but Geth and I have not seen any of the series yet and we want to catch up with it at some point!). As a result, it charted on Amazon in spring 2017 despite being out of print. Impressive!\n\nTrack 1: Atomic Kitten – Whole Again\n\nFound it too cheesy at the time, still do nowadays. This was the one where Kerry Katona left and they released a new version of the video with Jenny Frost replacing her, so there’s still two versions of it kicking about on the music channels.\n\nTrack 2: Hear’Say – Pure And Simple\n\nThe first of the noughties talent show winners, which was where pop music really started to go downhill. Awful, irritating song.\n\nTrack 3: S Club 7 – Never Had A Dream Come True\n\nIt’s one of those ones that is a Christmas song nowadays. Nice tune, but it’s a bit overplayed.\n\nTrack 4: Nelly Furtado – I’m Like A Bird\n\nI’d not thought about this one for a while. The tune’s okay, but I’ve always found the chorus a bit annoying.\n\nTrack 5: Shaggy and RikRok – It Wasn’t Me\n\nAbsolutely awful theme, but it’s a great tune!\n\nTrack 6: Gorillaz – Clint Eastwood\n\nI remember everyone going on at the time about how ‘revolutionary’ the idea of a virtual band was, but really all it involved was the musicians using pseudonyms and getting some cartoons made for the videos. It’s a good song, other than the fact it’s a bit drone-y.\n\nTrack 7: Modjo – Chillin’\n\nSlight ’70s tinge, which is no bad thing. The tune’s pretty dull though.\n\nTrack 8: Chocolate Puma – I Wanna Be U\n\nBoring, tuneless, not my thing.\n\nTrack 9: Fragma and Maria Rubia – Everytime You Need Me\n\n‘Every time’ should be two words ARGH.\n\nLeaving aside their awful grammar, though, I quite like this tune.\n\nTrack 10: Samantha Mumba – Always Come Back To Your Love\n\nI find the vocals on this one a bit annoying – not hugely keen.\n\nTrack 11: Britney Spears – Stronger\n\nGreat atmosphere, good tune, though I’ve always been really annoyed by that callback to …Baby One More Time in the chorus!\n\nTrack 12: Steps – It’s The Way You Make Me Feel\n\nNice tune. It’s pretty saccharine, but I still quite like this one.\n\nTrack 13: Emma Bunton – What Took You So Long\n\nGood tune, but it’s a bit slow for me.\n\nTrack 14: Ronan Keating and Bryan Adams – The Way You Make Me Feel\n\nIt’s almost a repeated title from the Steps offering above, but it’s a very different song – this one is a dodgy nausea-inducing guitar ballad.\n\nTrack 15: Backstreet Boys – Shape Of My Heart\n\nSuper saccharine, but the tune’s okay.\n\nTrack 16: LeAnn Rimes – I Need You\n\nExtremely boring ballad with overblown vocals. Not my thing at all.\n\nTrack 17: Damage – Still Be Lovin’ You\n\nAnother irritatingly cheesy track with a dull tune.\n\nTrack 18: Kaci Battaglia – Paradise\n\nNice atmosphere, like the Latin tinge and Spanish guitar. Good track.\n\nTrack 19: Martine McCutcheon – On The Radio\n\nPointless cover of the Donna Summer classic. Nothing new here at all, except the irritating ’00s hi-hat on the backing track.\n\nTrack 20: Kylie Minogue – Please Stay\n\nLovely atmosphere, with more Spanish guitar – loving that trend! Gorgeous tune.\n\nTrack 21: Bob The Builder – Can We Fix It?\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nI read ages ago (I can’t find a link so hopefully this daft concept has disappeared from the public imagination) that your ‘life song’ is supposed to be the song that was number one on your sixteenth birthday. Being a tail-end-of-Christmas baby, my birthday number one is usually still whatever was number one for Christmas. For my sixteenth birthday, it was this novelty charity single from the kids’ TV show Bob The Builder. I’m not sure what that’s supposed to say about my life.\n\nTrack 22: Eva Cassidy – Somewhere Over The Rainbow\n\nSlow, acoustic cover of the Judy Garland number from The Wizard Of Oz. Beautiful vocals, but the style’s not my kind of thing.\n\nTrack 23: U2 – Stuck In A Moment You Can’t Get Out Of\n\nI’ve always quite liked this one – good tune, interesting lyrics.\n\nTrack 24: Stereophonics – Mr Writer\n\nGood guitar riff, but the vocals are depressing and drone-y.\n\nTrack 25: Coldplay – Don’t Panic\n\nOh, it’s this one. The tune’s okay, but it’s pretty dull.\n\nTrack 26: Texas – Inner Smile\n\nGreat tune, great singalong chorus – really like this one.\n\nTrack 27: Robbie Williams – Let Love Be Your Energy\n\nNice tune, interesting vocals, though Robbie Williams is still trying to do the Britpop thing a few years after it ended.\n\nTrack 28: Feeder – Buck Rogers\n\nGreat, classic singalong rock track. Loved it at the time, still really like it now, with bonus amusement at the notion that a car having a CD player made it top of the range in 2001. Also, I could never work out whether the lyric was ‘drink cider from a lemon‘ or ‘drink cider from eleven‘.\n\nTrack 29: Papa Roach – Last Resort\n\nThis pop-punk classic was a bit of a soundtrack song in my teens – we always had it blasting at parties and in cars and so on. I still quite like the track.\n\nTrack 30: Planet Funk – Chase The Sun\n\nNice tune, but it’s too repetitive for me.\n\nTrack 31: Safri Duo – Played-A-Live (The Bongo Song)\n\nGood beat (obviously), good danceable track, though the trance bit is fairly generic.\n\nTrack 32: Dario G – Dream To Me\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nCover of the Cranberries’ Dreams. High-pitched classical/opera-style bit irritates throughout, and is joined by an uninspired trance beat. The whole thing is a bit messy.\n\nTrack 33: Jakatta – American Dream\n\nOh, it’s this one. Quite like the clangy instrumental, but it’s a bit dull otherwise.\n\nTrack 34: Sonique – I Put A Spell On You\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nSpiky, upbeat, atmospheric cover of the ’50s rock ‘n’ roll classic. Really like this one.\n\nTrack 35: Melanie B – Feels So Good\n\nIrritating, repetitive tune – not keen on this track.\n\nTrack 36: Mýa – Case Of The Ex\n\nGreat atmosphere, good tune, great singalong bit on the bridge and chorus. Good stuff.\n\nTrack 37: Chanté Moore – Straight Up\n\nHighly irritating tinkly xylophone-sounding instrumental at the start, then it launches into an uninspired tune. The vocals are okay, but it’s generally not my thing.\n\nTrack 38: Joe – Stutter\n\nBoring tune, irritating lines, annoying theme. Not keen on this one.\n\nTrack 39: Architechs – Show Me The Money\n\nToo repetitive for me, and the tune’s very generic.\n\nTrack 40: DJ Luck & MC Neat – Piano Loco\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nNice Latin flavour – good danceable track. Could do without the added ‘wub’ bits and rap though, it makes it very messy.\n\nTrack 41: Fun Lovin’ Criminals – Loco\n\nA slower type of loco here, maybe because there’s no piano this time. Still a good helping of Spanish vocals though, so I quite like it.\n\nDay 45 brings us to Now! #45, released on 17th April 2000.\n\nLet’s see how chart music sounded now that we’d entered a new millennium.\n\nTrack 1: Gabrielle – Rise\n\nThe tune’s too boring for me – not keen on this one.\n\nTrack 2: Melanie C and Lisa ‘Left Eye’ Lopes – Never Be The Same Again\n\nAnother gorgeous track from Melanie C – lovely tune, great atmosphere. This was a real favourite of mine at the time.\n\nTrack 3: Craig David – Fill Me In\n\nGreat upbeat danceable track, but I do find the chorus a bit annoying.\n\nTrack 4: Britney Spears – Born To Make You Happy\n\nUrgh, super saccharine! Not a fan of this at all.\n\nTrack 5: Backstreet Boys – Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely\n\nI shouldn’t like it, ’cause it’s a slow, saccharine ballad, but the instrumentals and atmosphere are great.\n\nTrack 6: Lene Marlin – Sitting Down Here\n\nToo high-pitched and cheesy for me – no edge to it.\n\nTrack 7: Tom Jones and Stereophonics – Mama Told Me Not To Come\n\nGreat, energetic cover of the ’60s classic. Really like this one.\n\nTrack 8: Shania Twain – Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\n\nAnthemic song – it did get a bit overplayed at the time, but I’ve always had a soft spot for it. Awesome singalong chorus.\n\nTrack 9: Geri Halliwell – Bag It Up\n\nIt’s a bit of a daft track, but I really like it. Another fabulous singalong song.\n\nTrack 10: S Club 7 – You’re My Number One\n\nNice retro-tinged tune, but the vocals are pretty annoying.\n\nTrack 11: Aqua – Cartoon Heroes\n\nGood atmosphere to the track – this one’s sort of interesting, and I find I quite like it.\n\nTrack 12: Vengaboys – Shalala Lala\n\nOriginally a Danish glam rock track from the early ’70s, fact fans! Love that slightly chilled-out electro hook.\n\nTrack 13: Daphne & Celeste – Ooh Stick You\n\nHilariously awful then, hilariously awful now! Classic Pop magazine tells me these two are making a comeback as well, if you can believe that!\n\nTrack 14: Atomic Kitten – See Ya\n\nGeneric, squeaky pop – pretty boring track.\n\nTrack 15: Madison Avenue – Don’t Call Me Baby\n\nI’ve always quite liked this one – it’s got a nice edge and is very danceable.\n\nTrack 16: Martine McCutcheon – Love Me\n\nQuite a nice tune, but it’s pretty forgettable.\n\nTrack 17: Steps – Say You’ll Be Mine\n\nSolid pop track from Steps – there’s a nice atmosphere to this one.\n\nTrack 18: Honeyz – Won’t Take It Lying Down\n\nBit more interesting and edgy than previous Honeyz songs on these compilations – quite like this track.\n\nTrack 19: Precious – Rewind\n\nAnother atmospheric track with great instrumentals. Good stuff.\n\nTrack 20: Montell Jordan – Get It On Tonite\n\nDull tune, but it’s got an okay beat.\n\nTrack 21: Fierce – Sweet Love 2K\n\nFairly pointless cover of the Anita Baker track. Too slow for me, though the tune’s quite pretty.\n\nTrack 22: Boyzone – Every Day I Love You\n\nSlow, saccharine, generic ballad. Not keen on this one.\n\nTrack 23: Chicane and Bryan Adams – Don’t Give Up\n\nDance track, which sounds a bit odd with Bryan Adams’ vocals. It’s not very interesting otherwise.\n\nTrack 24: Fragma – Toca’s Miracle\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nQuite liked it at the time, find the chorus annoying now.\n\nTrack 25: Moloko – The Time Is Now\n\nI’ve always liked this one – great atmosphere.\n\nTrack 26: Artful Dodger and Craig David – Re-Rewind (The Crowd Say Bo Selecta)\n\nRepeated artist alert! We’ve already had Craig David. This track’s a bit of a legendary one though, inspiring the Bo Selecta! TV series, so they couldn’t really have left it out. It’s a bit repetitive for me, but it is a classic.\n\nTrack 27: DJ Luck & MC Neat – A Little Bit Of Luck\n\nInteresting vocals, but it’s pretty repetitive.\n\nTrack 28: Sisqó – Thong Song\n\nAwkward then, awkward and dated now. Let’s gloss over this one.\n\nTrack 29: Jamelia and Beenie Man – Money\n\nNice epic operatic-style intro, good atmosphere. Great track.\n\nTrack 30: Kelis – Caught Out There\n\nOh, it’s this one! I always assumed it was called I Hate You So Much Right Now. The verses are pretty dull, but it is nice and danceable.\n\nTrack 31: Artful Dodger and Romina Johnson – Movin’ Too Fast\n\nRepeated artist alert! We’ve already had Artful Dodger. Really, the Now! compilers should just have gone with Re-Rewind for Artful Dodger and Craig David and saved themselves a couple of slots (especially as the number of tracks on these compilations is starting to get a bit bloated now).\n\nI like the nice tinkly instrumentals, but the vocals are fairly boring.\n\nTrack 32: Nu Generation – In Your Arms (Rescue Me)\n\nI like the Rescue Me sample, but the rest of the stuff in this track is pretty poor – it’s largely a lot of strange special effects.\n\nTrack 33: Basement Jaxx – Bingo Bango\n\nOh, it’s this one! Great Latin-tinged instrumental hook, quite like this track – very danceable.\n\nTrack 34: ATB – Killer 2000\n\nCover of the Adamski and Seal classic that samples bits of the original. Utterly pointless – there’s nothing new here.\n\nTrack 35: Sash! – Adelante\n\nPretty tune on this dance track, but it’s fairly repetitive, and some of the instrumentals are a bit headache-inducing.\n\nTrack 36: Watergate – Heart Of Asia\n\nQuite like the Eastern-inspired synthy bits – nice tune.\n\nTrack 37: Progress and The Boy Wunda – Everybody\n\nLove that Papa Don’t Preach sample – the rest of the track is pretty uninspired though.\n\nTrack 38: Lock ‘N’ Load – Blow Ya Mind\n\nNo melody, irritating screechy noise-based lines. Not keen.\n\nTrack 39: Precocious Brats and Kevin & Perry – Big Girl\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nBit of a messy mishmash of ’60s-inspired instrumentals and irritating vocal samples from Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke’s comedy characters. Not a fan of this one.\n\nTrack 40: The Tamperer and Maya – Hammer To The Heart\n\nQuite like the electro line on this one – shame the vocals are irritating and generic.\n\nTrack 41: Cuban Boys – C vs I\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nOh, it’s this one. I hadn’t thought about this track for a long time, but the yodeling bit is still just as annoying as it was back in the day, even if it did spawn the singing hamster toy craze and provide great hilarity via novelty Christmas gifts for a couple of years.\n\nTrack 42: Robbie Williams – It’s Only Us\n\nNice tune, still sort of hanging off the back of Britpop. Great singalong chorus too.\n\nTrack 43: Blink-182 – All The Small Things\n\nAbsolute classic piece of pop-punk. I remember dancing to this on Millennium Eve – great times.\n\nTrack 44: Moby – Natural Blues\n\nGreat tune, but it’s a little repetitive for me.\n\nTrack 45: John Lennon – Imagine\n\nThis track periodically re-enters the charts, and has probably done so a good dozen times since Lennon’s death in 1980. Surprisingly, this is the first time the Now! compilers have picked it up though. It’s a classic tune – there’s not much else to say about it.\n\nDay 43 takes us to 19th July 1999 with the Now! compilations.\n\nOn with the summer hits!\n\nTrack 1: Martine McCutcheon – Perfect Moment\n\nFound it slow, dull and irritating at the time, and guess what? I still do now. I quite like Martine McCutcheon as an actor and presenter, but I’m not keen on her music.\n\nTrack 2: Boyzone – You Needed Me\n\nSo slow and saccharine it’s depressing. Really dislike this one.\n\nTrack 3: Backstreet Boys – I Want It That Way\n\nLoved it at the time and bought the single. It’s a bit cheesy for me nowadays, but I still quite like the tune.\n\nTrack 4: Shanks & Bigfoot – Sweet Like Chocolate\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nAnnoyed by the tune then, annoyed by the tune now. Quite like the video though.\n\nTrack 5: S Club 7 – Bring It All Back\n\nHighly irritating tune. I was never much of an S Club fan.\n\nTrack 6: Vengaboys – Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom\n\nAnother daft theme from the Vengaboys. Great tune though.\n\nTrack 7: ATB – 9PM (Till I Come)\n\nI remember having a discussion on the way home from school with my mate Laura about this track. She found it irritating because the vocal sample was ‘till I come‘ but the word ‘9PM’ was never spoken. I suggested that maybe the instrumental hook was meant to represent ‘9PM’, and so for a brief while we had an in-joke of singing the tune to this track in lieu of saying ‘9PM’. I guess it must have amused us at the time.\n\nDespite all that, the tune’s not much to write home about, and I find the whole thing pretty dull nowadays.\n\nTrack 8: Phats & Small – Turn Around\n\nOh, it’s this one! I’ve always quite liked this feelgood track – it’s very danceable.\n\nTrack 9: Basement Jaxx – Red Alert\n\nReally like that hook, but could do without the messy stop-start intro.\n\nTrack 10: Dina Carroll – Without Love\n\nGeneric dance beat, boring tune, headache-inducing overblown vocals on the chorus. Not my cup of tea.\n\nTrack 11: Geri Halliwell – Look At Me\n\nGeri Halliwell’s post-Spice Girls solo debut. It’s alright (the video‘s better than the song) but she did much more interesting tracks later on.\n\nTrack 12: Adam Rickitt – I Breathe Again\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nIt’s another one that reminds me of my mate Laura, as she had a lot of posters of Adam Rickitt. I actually quite like the song – there’s a nice classic pop aspect to it.\n\nTrack 13: Lolly – Viva La Radio\n\nAppalling, painfully high-pitched song with irritating lyrics, irritating verses, messy squeaky instrumentals, and infuriating spoken interjections. Surprisingly, the tune on the chorus is actually okay. If someone sampled that it might be quite good.\n\nTrack 14: Cartoons – Doodah\n\nDaft dance version of the traditional children’s song. There’s actually something I find quite endearing about it.\n\nTrack 15: Precious – Say It Again\n\nThis is one of those late ’90s tracks that sounds more like it came from the early ’90s. It’s got a nice beat, but the tune’s pretty dull.\n\nTrack 16: Honeyz – Love Of A Lifetime\n\nPretty instrumentals, but the vocal line is very generic.\n\nTrack 17: 911 – Private Number\n\nCheesy, slow cover of the ’60s hit. Not hugely keen on this.\n\nTrack 18: Culture Club – Your Kisses Are Charity\n\nAnother reggae-tinged song from Culture Club’s late ’90s era. Nice tune, quite like it.\n\nTrack 19: Beverley Knight – Greatest Day\n\nNot feeling this one – the tune is too messy for me.\n\nTrack 20: Melanie B – Word Up\n\nUpbeat cover of the Cameo classic. It doesn’t live up to the original, but I like the added harmonisation on the vocals.\n\nTrack 21: Fierce – Dayz Like That\n\nThe atmosphere’s okay, but on the whole it’s pretty bland and tuneless.\n\nTrack 22: Tina Cousins – Forever\n\nLovely tune on the vocals (when they’re not so high in the mix that they make my hearing aids squawk with feedback), but the backing track’s very generic.\n\nTrack 23: Baz Luhrmann – Everybody’s Free (To Wear Sunscreen)\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nAnd it’s yet another one that reminds me of my mate Laura, due to many hours in art class with her telling me how this song sounded like God speaking. I’ve never thought it sounded like God, but I do like the spoken word monologue throughout the track.\n\nTrack 24: Texas – In Our Lifetime\n\nPleasant tune, but nothing special.\n\nTrack 25: New Radicals – You Get What You Give\n\nGreat singalong chorus, but I find the tune a bit repetitive.\n\nTrack 26: Supergrass – Pumping On Your Stereo\n\nI’m normally not keen on Supergrass, but I do like this one – great vocal hook, and a bit of a ’60s throwback sound, which is no bad thing.\n\nTrack 27: Madness – Lovestruck\n\nA welcome return to the charts for the recently-reformed Madness, with a song that’s just as jaunty as their stuff the early ’80s, with a bit of added edgy atmosphere. Great track, really like this one.\n\nTrack 28: The Wiseguys – Ooh La La\n\nOh, it’s this one. It’s okay, but there’s a good reason I hadn’t thought about it for many years – there’s just no melody, and the interesting spoken word hook isn’t enough to make up for that.\n\nTrack 29: The Chemical Brothers – Hey Boy Hey Girl\n\nIt’s too repetitive for me, but I do like the ‘superstar DJ‘ vocal sample.\n\nTrack 30: Fatboy Slim – Right Here, Right Now\n\nLoved it at the time, bought the single. Still really like it now – great tune, anthemic hook.\n\nTrack 31: Chicane and Maire Brennan – Saltwater\n\nLovely vocals from Maire Brennan (including a bit of a reprise from Theme From Harry’s Game), contributing to a great dance track.\n\nTrack 32: Bryan Adams – Cloud Number Nine\n\nI remember this being reviewed on the Live & Kicking episode where Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston were leaving the show, and them being disappointed that it hadn’t come out a few years earlier so they could have used it as the theme tune for their ‘Cloud Nine’ feature. Strange what you remember.\n\nAnyway, I quite like the track – more than I did at the time, anyway.\n\nTrack 33: Blur – Coffee And TV\n\nGreat tune, awesome singalong chorus. Everybody raves about the video, but I refuse to watch it ’cause it makes me sad.\n\nTrack 34: Cast – Beat Mama\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nBetter than most Cast tracks – at least it’s got a good upbeat tempo and chant-along chorus, even if the tune’s a bit uninspired.\n\nTrack 35: Stereophonics – Pick A Part That’s New\n\nIt’s another Stereophonics track where I find the vocals too droning and depressing. I’m sure they did do better ones.\n\nTrack 36: Gomez – Bring It On\n\nInteresting harmonisation on the intro, but after that it gets a bit messy for my liking.\n\nTrack 37: Semisonic – Secret Smile\n\nNice tune, nice atmosphere, great lyrics. Really quite like this one.\n\nTrack 38: James – I Know What I’m Here For\n\nPleasant tune, great instrumentals. Nice track.\n\nTrack 39: Yomanda – Synth And Strings\n\nI guess it does what it says on the tin, but it’s not the nice melodious track you might expect from a name like that – it sounds quite nasty, to be honest.\n\nTrack 40: DJ Jurgen and Alice Deejay – Better Off Alone\n\nUtterly depressing repetitive vocal hook – never been keen on this.\n\nTrack 41: Masters At Work and India – To Be In Love\n\nThere’s quite a nice ’70s vibe to this one, but I’m not loving the tune.\n\nDay 34 brings us to Now! #34, which came out on 12th August 1996.\n\nLet’s hear those summer hits!\n\nTrack 1: Spice Girls – Wannabe\n\nAt eleven, I was exactly the right age for the Spice Girls, and from the moment this first song of theirs came out, I adored them. I bought every single and every album in HMV on the day they came out, I had every single Spice magazine (still do), I had the limited edition Spice Girls Impulse body spray. I was a huge fan, to put it mildly, and I remember carefully writing down the lyrics of this song and editing it over the course of several months, trying to work out what they were saying (I’ve mentioned before that I’m no good with being able to hear lyrics, and a lot of it was so nonsensical that there were endless arguments in the playground about what the words were – it was only when the album came out in December, complete with lyric insert, that I was able to confirm them properly).\n\nNowadays, I find this first track pretty cringeworthy – they did much better songs later on. I still remember how much I loved it at the time, though, the summer I moved from primary school to high school. Interesting times.\n\nTrack 2: Robbie Williams – Freedom\n\nPointless cover of the George Michael track. Although Robbie was my favourite member of Take That and I was gutted when he left, I find his solo stuff can be a bit hit and miss, and this cover doesn’t add anything to the original.\n\nTrack 3: Peter Andre and Bubbler Ranx – Mysterious Girl\n\nQuite liked it at the time – nowadays I see it as a ‘so-bad-it’s-hilarious’ classic.\n\nTrack 4: Dodgy – Good Enough\n\nI was never hugely keen on this one, though I quite enjoyed it when we saw them live at Beautiful Days in 2013.\n\nTrack 5: Ocean Colour Scene – The Day We Caught The Train\n\nI adore Ocean Colour Scene (they were my favourite band for quite a while in my teens) and this is an absolute classic – great tune, great instrumentals, great lyrics.\n\nTrack 6: Larry Mullen Jr and Adam Clayton – Theme From Mission: Impossible\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nThe two less famous members of U2 taking on the Mission: Impossible theme for the film version. It’s perhaps slightly rockier than the original, but not hugely different. I’ll give it a pass, though, ’cause you wouldn’t want a classic theme like this to be changed too much.\n\nTrack 7: Underworld – Born Slippy\n\nReally liked it at the time, find it dated and annoying now.\n\nTrack 8: JX – There’s Nothing I Won’t Do\n\nQuite like the tune on this dance track, but the vocals annoy me.\n\nTrack 9: Gina G – Ooh Aah (Just A Little Bit)\n\nThe UK’s Eurovision entry for 1996. Loved it at the time, find it irritating now. I’m finding that’s a bit of a theme with 1996. I must not have been hugely discerning at eleven.\n\nTrack 10: Pianoman – Blurred\n\nNice piano lines, as you might expect – the rest of the track is a bit messy, especially the misplaced sample from Blur’s Girls And Boys.\n\nTrack 11: Livin’ Joy – Don’t Stop Movin’\n\nOh, it’s this one. The vocals are at least interesting, but I find the style irritating and a bit generic.\n\nTrack 12: Louise – Naked\n\nFinally a decent one from Louise – great solid pop track.\n\nTrack 13: Mark Morrison – Return Of The Mack\n\nClassic tune, quite like this one. It’s been sample-covered horribly by at least two different ’10s artists, but I’m sure we’ll get to those later.\n\nTrack 14: 2Pac and Dr Dre – California Love\n\nReally like this one! Great song, love that chorus.\n\nTrack 15: Pato Banton – Groovin’\n\nDull tune, dull vocals, not keen.\n\nTrack 16: Reel 2 Real – Jazz It Up\n\nQuite a funky danceable beat, but it’s a bit of a dull tune.\n\nTrack 17: Maxi Priest and Shaggy – That Girl\n\nNice jaunty vocals, but that sample of Booker T & The MGs’ Green Onions is super repetitive.\n\nTrack 18: Los Del Mar – Macarena\n\nNo, that’s not a typo. Los Del Mar were basically a tribute band that only existed in order to cover Macarena by Los Del Rio (who were themselves little more than a one-hit wonder). Maybe the Now! compilers couldn’t get the rights to the original.\n\nThe cover is pretty pointless – it’s pretty much note for note the River Fe-Mix version of the original.\n\nTrack 19: Umboza – Sunshine\n\nAnother misplaced sample, this time Bamboléo by the Gipsy Kings. The rest of the track is fairly generic.\n\nTrack 20: Josh Wink – Higher State Of Consciousness\n\nWe’ve had this already, on Now! #32, which was only a couple of compilations ago! That’s just lazy.\n\nUrgh. See the link for my review.\n\nTrack 21: Todd Terry, Martha Wash and Jocelyn Brown – Keep On Jumpin’\n\nMessy semi-cover of the ’70s hit, with samples and random lines all over the place. It’s pretty awful.\n\nTrack 22: Robert Miles – Children\n\nI’ve always loved this one! Gorgeous electro tune.\n\nTrack 23: George Michael – Jesus To A Child\n\nLovely, melancholy song from George Michael. Beautiful tune.\n\nTrack 24: Oasis – Wonderwall\n\nA little late to the party for the Now! compilers, as this was more of a late 1995 hit, but it’s a classic, probably the best song Oasis did in my opinion, and so still very welcome.\n\nTrack 25: The Bluetones – Slight Return\n\nOh, it’s this one! Pleasant tune, happily nodding along right now.\n\nTrack 26: Paul Weller – Peacock Suit\n\nDull tune, very dad-rock. Not keen.\n\nTrack 27: Bon Jovi – Hey God\n\nI normally like Bon Jovi, but I find this one a bit uninspired.\n\nTrack 28: Bryan Adams – The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You\n\nFound it annoying at the time, just find it a bit so-so now.\n\nTrack 29: Belinda Carlisle – In Too Deep\n\nNice instrumentals, but the vocal is pretty dull.\n\nTrack 30: Suggs – Cecelia\n\nLoved this reggae-tinged cover of the Simon & Garfunkel classic at the time, still love it now! Great track.\n\nTrack 31: Blur – Charmless Man\n\nI’ve always found the tune to this one a bit annoying. Not my favourite Blur track.\n\nTrack 32: Suede – Trash\n\nGood head-nodder from Suede – really like this one. Great singalong chorus too.\n\nTrack 33: Joan Osborne – One Of Us\n\nThat old-timey American traditional rhyme at the start is super annoying, but the song itself is an absolute classic – great tune.\n\nTrack 34: Crowded House – Instinct\n\nNice tune, really like this one.\n\nTrack 35: Lighthouse Family – Ocean Drive\n\nFeelgood track with an awesome singalong chorus. Lovely.\n\nTrack 36: Tina Turner – On Silent Wings\n\nDull tune, dull ballad. Not a fan of this one.\n\nTrack 37: Everything But The Girl – Wrong\n\nGood beat, but I’m not keen on the tune.\n\nTrack 38: OMC – How Bizarre\n\nI’d forgotten about this one! Pleasant, jaunty track, really like it.\n\nTrack 39: Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark – Walking On The Milky Way\n\nLovely tune, really interesting track.\n\nTrack 40: Space – Female Of The Species\n\nLoved it at the time, love it now. I remember endless arguments in the back of the car about whether the lyric was ‘more deadlier‘, which was what it sounded like, or the grammatically correct ‘more deadly‘. I think I argued for the latter position, just because I couldn’t believe a professional band would write such a horrendously wrong sentence (ah, childhood innocence). A quick google just now tells me it was indeed the latter, but it really does sound like the former.\n\nTrack 41: Cast – Walkaway\n\nNice tune, but a bit slow for me.\n\nTrack 42: Boyzone – Coming Home Now\n\nLiked it at the time, find the tune pretty irritating now.\n\nDay 6, and we’ve arrived at 25th November 1985.\n\nI doubt any of the artists on Now! #6 looked as cool as me and Dad in our knitted hats, but let’s have a listen anyway.\n\nTrack 1: Queen – One Vision\n\nA favourite going back to childhood – we had the A Kind Of Magic album on CD in the ’90s and always played it in the car.\n\nI don’t think anyone disputes nowadays that the last line is definitely sung as ‘fried chicken‘, right?\n\nTrack 2: Nik Kershaw – When A Heart Beats\n\nNice rock-tinged track, probably the best Nik Kershaw track the Now! compilers have included so far.\n\nTrack 3: Feargal Sharkey – A Good Heart\n\nI quite like this one in moderation. Good chair-swayer, and great lyrics.\n\nTrack 4: Eurythmics – There Must Be An Angel (Playing With My Heart)\n\nI’ve got a soft spot for this one because it was used for one of the idents on VH1 Classic back in the ’00s, when Geth and I lived in Edinburgh and could still get Virgin TV with its huge variety of music TV channels. Love that chorus.\n\nTrack 5: Simple Minds – Alive And Kicking\n\nSlightly rockier sound from Simple Minds today, great tune, especially the singalong bridge.\n\nTrack 6: Bryan Adams and Tina Turner – It’s Only Love\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 1: lazy tribute version substitute.\n\nNice epic guitar riff all the way through – quite like this one.\n\nTrack 7: Gary Moore – Empty Rooms\n\nLove the atmosphere of this one, with that wailing guitar at the start. Everything I like in an ’80s rock ballad.\n\nTrack 8: Marillion – Lavender\n\nNot keen on this one – the repetitive chorus annoys me.\n\nTrack 9: Elton John – Nikita\n\nA song from a different world, where the Iron Curtain meant that English boys weren’t allowed to date Russian girls, or something. It’s quite a nice tune, but there’s something a little dull about it for me.\n\nTrack 10: Kate Bush – Running Up That Hill\n\nLove this one. I think I came to it late and it was actually the Placebo cover in 2003 that introduced me to it (the Placebo covers album did that for a lot of songs). In this case, the original is much better though.\n\nTrack 11: Level 42 – Something About You\n\nNice upbeat pop, quite like this one!\n\nSide note: Geth and I noticed when we were at the Sage Gateshead for the Kim Wilde gig last night that Level 42 will be playing there in October. I may have another ’80s gig to look forward to!\n\nTrack 12: Tina Turner – We Don’t Need Another Hero\n\nAs usual with Tina Turner, there’s something I’m not keen on here. I think I just don’t like the tune.\n\nTrack 13: UB40 – Don’t Break My Heart\n\nNot quite as bouncy as you’d usually expect from UB40, but I really quite like the atmosphere of this one.\n\nTrack 14: Phil Collins and Marilyn Martin – Separate Lives\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 1: lazy tribute version substitute.\n\nBit too much of a dull, slow ballad for my tastes. I quite like the instrumentals though.\n\nTrack 15: Cliff Richard – She’s So Beautiful\n\nNever been a Cliff fan, as I find his typical level of cheese to be pretty cringeworthy. This one is no exception. Blurgh.\n\nTrack 16: Arcadia – Election Day\n\nFollowing the Power Station yesterday, here’s the other Duran Duran spinoff band of 1985. Plenty to love here, with a nice epic chorus and daft video.\n\nTrack 17: UB40 and Chrissie Hynde – I Got You Babe\n\nI actually prefer this jaunty reggae version of the song to the Sonny and Cher original. Great track.\n\nTrack 18: Fine Young Cannibals – Blue\n\nOkay tune, but not enough of a hook for me.\n\nTrack 19: Midge Ure – If I Was\n\nIn our ’90s family CD collection, we had this one on a Top Gear compilation, I think. I’ve always liked the tune, especially the way the verses build.\n\nTrack 20: Siouxsie & The Banshees – Cities In Dust\n\nNice mad song that I still hear a lot in clubs. Highly danceable if you’re a goth.\n\nTrack 21: Madness – Uncle Sam\n\nTypical jolly Madness track, though it’s a bit more sedate than some of their stuff. Really like this tune.\n\nTrack 22: Lloyd Cole & The Commotions – Lost Weekend\n\nGreat song! I’m going to make this one today’s top wedding disco track.\n\nTrack 23: The Communards – You Are My World\n\nMy parents had (and still have) the Communards’ self-titled album on vinyl, so it’s one of those records I grew up with. Great dance tune.\n\nTrack 24: Paul Hardcastle – Just For Money\n\nJaunty mishmash of sampling based around the theme of the Great Train Robbery. Quite like this track.\n\nTrack 25: Jan Hammer – Miami Vice Theme\n\nI find this one a bit dull. It does, however, remind me that I’ve never seen an episode of Miami Vice, which I should probably rectify at some point.\n\nTrack 26: Maria Vidal – Body Rock\n\nThis one’s a bit pop-by-numbers, nothing special.\n\nTrack 27: Baltimora – Tarzan Boy\n\nThat’s more like it! Great hooks, classic pop track.\n\nTrack 28: Mai Tai – Body And Soul\n\n‘Not on Spotify’ Type 2: YouTube Pause (TM).\n\nMuch better than History from yesterday. Vocals aren’t really to my taste, but the instrumentals are great.\n\nTrack 29: Cameo – Single Life\n\nNot enough here to keep my interest. Bland tune, repetitive vocals.\n\nTrack 30: Jaki Graham and David Grant – Mated\n\nFairly typical ballad, a bit dull and slow for me."
