        "text": "Becky Chambers’ 2022 sequel to A Psalm for the Wild-Built, A Prayer for the Crown-shy, sees main character Sibling Dex, tea maker and restless spirit, continuing their ambling journey of self-discovery and navel-gazing, accompanied by philosophical robot Splendid Speckled Mosscap, or Mosscap for short. I reviewed the first novella in the series a while ago, so if you’re interested check it out on my blog. I realise that I am rather negative and unimpressed by both these offerings, when they are quite harmless, gentle and an antidote to the rage and violence of so much current SF literature, cinema and streaming series. I just wanted there to be a bit more to them, a hint of spice, heightened awareness, something.\n\nThe first novella established Sibling Dex as an aimless traveller and maker of herbal concoctions, which they shared with people in the villages they passed through, as a kind of return payment for being able to access a hot shower, fresh food, and transitory companionship. Encountering a member of the long-missing robot population (which decided one day a few centuries earlier to no longer serve humans and just leave for parts unknown), Sibling Dex forms an unlikely friendship with the curious Mosscap. Through Mosscap, Dex learns that robots are not immortal; after a certain amount of time their parts wear out and they gracefully accept the end of their existence. Their parts are recycled and incorporated into a new version (hence “wild-built”), and when this new robot “wakes”, it names itself after the first thing it sees.\n\nMosscap has volunteered to seek out humans as promised years earlier so it can ask them, “What do people need?” Finding that Sibling Dex cannot answer this question because they are still struggling to learn who they are and what they want, Mosscap accompanies Dex on a meandering journey across the human inhabited lands of the moon Panga, asking the people they meet what they need. By the end of this second novella, Mosscap reaches the conclusion that people tend to respond with either a specific, practical need, such as mending a broken wheel, delivering goods to another village, or fixing a leaky tap, or a less specific answer along philosophical lines, such as purpose, adventure, or companionship. Many people even respond that they do not have an unmet need, citing instead those aspects of their lives that they wouldn’t want to do without.\n\nThere is a vague decision made to journey towards the humans’ City in search of a more specific answer to the robots’ simple question. Along the way Dex introduces Mosscap to other humans, who are intrigued to finally meet a robot, and who welcome the robot’s willingness to repair things for them, which also allows Mosscap the opportunity to learn more about humans. Mosscap is very popular given its unfailing willingness to provide services to the people it meets, but is in danger of being exploited. Sibling Dex enjoys a physically intimate interlude with one villager, but they and Mosscap still elect to travel ever on, in search of that elusive something. They even visit Dex’s family farm, which provides more information about human relationships for Mosscap to consider, and for Dex to realise that their family, loving and welcoming as it is, does not hold the answer.\n\nThe only real aspect of tension, or perhaps just having to make a hard decision, comes when Mosscap discovers it is breaking down. Replacing a defective part with a new one goes against its beliefs and robot tradition of being recycled and incorporated into a new robot entity once this starts to occur. There is a resolution, but it is touch and go for a short time, and provides the only hard edge to an otherwise gently ambling, philosophically softened story.\n\nWill this unlikely duo go to the City? Will they dally by the ocean? Will they just keep delaying making any hard and fast decisions? Does anyone care? The novella ends in much the same way as the earlier one, with nothing decided, beyond just wanting to delay deciding anything. The dedication at the beginning states: “For anybody who doesn’t know where they’re going.” I’m sorry to say that they won’t have a clearer idea after reading this second outing. I was a tad optimistic in hoping it would have more action, plot, or character development, which was misplaced. It just isn’t that sort of book.\n\nPerhaps this is best enjoyed by tea enthusiasts and lovers of gentle meanderings, or someone hoping to have a snooze.\n\nWhat follows is not an attempt to cover everything or thank everyone involved with the recent Raiders of the Lost Empire Gala Dinner, which belatedly celebrated the 40th anniversaries of two iconic films, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark. This article is focused on what I was involved with so closely for many months, as a member of the creative design team. It’s that team I would like to pay tribute to for creating the visual aspects of the gala dinner, what people saw when they walked through the door, how every single thing was the result of a small team of dedicated, hard-working, creative people (three of whom had full-time jobs and other commitments to balance). Several attendees said it was the best gala dinner they had ever attended, and that means so much to those of us who worked to make it a success, and a wonderful celebration of two iconic, beloved films. It was worth it, too, because the raffle and auctions raised an amazing $1191 for our nominated charity, the Fred Hollows Foundation.\n\nThe first thing that struck Poe Dameron (Rachel Betts actually, who cosplayed as Poe Dameron) upon entering the dinner venue was being “astounded by how much effort and detail the creative team had gone into to make this such a special night. The decorations weren’t your regular decorations. I’m talking handmade, giant-sized, meticulously crafted displays that featured motifs and designs from both Star Wars and Indiana Jones seamlessly. They looked like museum pieces.” High praise indeed, Poe.\n\nAnnika Wilson, who won a Best Original Costume award for her Kylo Ren inspired cosplay, said, “It was such a fun night and the effort put into it was monumental. The creative design team went above and beyond to make the night fun and memorable, so thank you guys for all of your hard work.”\n\nWhen the club planned a Force V convention in 2021, one of the current committee members, former Director Shane Morrissey, suggested recruiting some retired, life-time honorary members onto the committee to help. These people were Michael Wilson, an experienced graphic designer, former SWI committee/convention member and former club newsletter co-editor; and me, Jan MacNally Wilson, a published author, experienced convention committee member, and former SWI newsletter editor. There was also a gala dinner planned, so a sub-committee was formed to handle this, with me later becoming Event Coordinator, Shane as 2IC, Michael as graphic design artist for print resources, and Luke from the executive committee.\n\nWhen COVID later led to the Force V convention being cancelled in 2022, the gala dinner sub-committee had already invested so many hours of time and money into the creation of props, backgrounds, and table centre pieces that we didn’t want it to be for naught. Another person invited to join the sub-committee was former club member Dave Hankin (of Arkive Studios), a creative genius who had already been working on lots of props, sets and backdrops for the event, and was also heavily invested in continuing.\n\nFor Shane Morrissey, EmCee, the best memory from the evening was hosting the auction and witnessing the fast and furious battle over the Darth Vader gold idol, which eventually sold for $300 after a fierce battle between Daniel Sullivan and myself. Shane said, “It was great to see other SW folk coming together. Longtime friends appeared. The cake – and then, more cake. The Luke and Vader set piece, plus the Raiders set piece, both masterfully crafted by Dave Hankin. There was a touch of the Lucasfilm archive vibe. My takeaway is a sense that it worked out in the end… A nice way to finish upon.” Shane donated around $600 of his own money, which included printing the poster and paying for the truck hire, helping move all the props and sets from Dave’s place (and taking them away again), as well as devoting many months of his time towards the event.\n\nMichael Wilson said that “watching Jan create her Dagobah table centre piece inspired me to develop and construct my own range of illuminated centre pieces. At first it was only meant to be three then I had an idea for another one, then another and another. As the numerous lockdowns in Melbourne delayed the dinner, it also gave me time to be more creative. In the end I created 9 unique centre pieces, each one to be auctioned for charity.”\n\nThese beautifully detailed dioramas included a toppled AT-AT, crashed snow speeder, Indy-Yoda in the Map Room, the space slug from the asteroid field, Bespin’s Cloud City, Han Solo in carbonite, the gold idol in the Peruvian temple, and the Ark of the Covenant. Not content with this, Michael explained, “I also created 5 different resin fridge magnet designs (over 70 magnets were eventually produced) that were part of the gift bags as well as 8 mini-fertility idols as door prizes. From my personal collection I provided autographs and a whip to be auctioned. Everything I did, made and supplied was donated by me.”\n\nHaving loved the artistic styles of Drew Struzan and Hugh Fleming, Michael added, “I tried to design the poster for the Gala Dinner in a similar style. After weeks of layouts and fine tuning I finally settled on the ultimate poster design.” He also designed the tickets, program, and the certificates of appreciation and for the cosplay competition. Michael concluded that “the creative team of Dave, Jan, Shane, and me, because of our experience with the running of previous Star Walking Inc. events that are now legendary in fandom, know how to run an entertaining and enjoyable evening. We pull out all stops, be it at the sacrifice of our home life, our personal bank account, our time and sometimes our health. When all is done and dusted, all that mattered to me were my family and friends within the creative team, that those who attended the evening enjoyed themselves and that we raised a respectable amount of money for our charity. If I made one person smile my sacrifices were worth it.”\n\nAbove clockwise from left: Bespin Cloud City; Han Solo in carbonite; Raiders Ark of the Covenant; Raiders Eqyptian scene; and Raiders gold idol (all 9 table centre pieces were designed and produced by Michael Wilson)\n\nJan MacNally Wilson: as Event Coordinator, I kept track of the team’s progress regarding all the elements for the event. I chaired meetings, wrote agendas and minutes as well as the detailed promotional content for the Force Newsletter (not including social media content). I created the program content (including the fun menu names), prepared the trivia quiz (so blame me for getting any answers wrong!). I wanted everyone to have fun, to get involved and share in the love we have for these films. I loved hosting the trivia quiz and cosplay competition. I couldn’t have had a better creative crew to collaborate with than Dave, Michael and Shane, who became a second family.\n\nI did lots of things to help make the night a success but there are probably others I’ve forgotten in the mists of time:\n\nOrganised for 2 anniversary cakes to be made; picked them up in a 100km round trip\n\nOrganised for a photographer to take photos on the night (thanks to Annika for the contact)\n\nPersonally paid for ingredients for the cupcakes, baked and decorated all cupcakes (thanks to my sister Marion who also helped, while niece Steph made the delicious macarons)\n\nPersonally paid for the gift bags, lolly snakes & the themed chocolates (which I made)\n\nDesigned and made the Dagobah Yoda’s Hut table centre piece with flickering candle lights (which took several months to complete during various lockdowns); someone bought it, too, yay!\n\nBought most of the raffle hamper contents (except chocolates donated by Rachel Betts, autographed photos donated by Michael Wilson, and the phone/tablet rests from Marion MacNally)\n\nLiaised with guests concerning seating preferences and special dietary requirements\n\nSold raffle tickets at the event\n\nHosted both the trivia quiz and the Cosplay competition\n\nAbove, clockwise from left: Jan’s handcrafted Yoda’s Dagobah hut; KazzasCakes Gala Dinner cake; Jan hosting the costume/cosplay competition; Jan’s winning bid for the gorgeous, one-off Darth Vader gold idol made by Dave Hankin; and the second cake made by KazzasCakes, featuring a whip and a detailed light saber.\n\nThis brings us back to Dave Hankin, who is a dynamo of energy, talent, creativity, and enthusiasm. Like Indy chasing the Ark of the Covenant as the Nazis drove it away in a truck, there is no stopping him. Over a two-and-a-half-year period, it started with a phone call from Shane asking if he could borrow Dave’s life-size Ark of the Covenant to be used as a prop for a banquet celebrating the joint 40th anniversaries of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Empire Strikes Back.\n\nWhen Dave saw the proposed venue, he recalls, “An idea popped into my head of the idol pillar and backdrop from Raiders then looking at the stage and the rest of the hall I knew I could do something spectacular.” Initially contributing his own materials, Dave was later given a budget for the masses of props and sets he kept producing, which included the gold Darth Vader idol, the cosplay trophies, the “40th” sign, jungle and temple walls with their intricate carvings, the various silhouettes of Luke vs Vader, Boba Fett, Indy, and the incredible personal collection on display. Friend Adam Gill also assisted with realising these creations. Dave remembers, “I kept adding and adding to it. I wanted to create memories for people to look back on. It doesn’t matter how much it cost. Good times, friendships and memories last forever, and I hope I achieved that. It was an honour and privilege to work alongside the likes of Michael, Shane and Jan. Such professionalism, encouragement and the feeling of a close-knit family is what everybody deserves, and I got that.”\n\nAbove clockwise: the incredible main stage backdrop featuring the duel between Luke and Vader; the Darth Vader gold idol in its temple setting; silhouette of Indy with Egyptian artefacts; the 40th anniversary logo; and the handcrafted costume trophies (all by Dave Hankin)\n\nDave also wanted to thank his partner Natasha Sweetman and mother of their son Indy (named after Raiders, of course). “Seeing me doing all this artwork inspired Natasha’s creative spirit that had been sitting dormant for some time. She’s a very good artist so I asked her if she could assist, and she helped without question. If it wasn’t for her taking the reins as I started this mammoth display, I don’t think it would have turned out as well as it did. Honestly, I think it was pure passion and the memories of seeing great displays when I was a kid that motivated me. I could not tell you the number of hours, but it was a hell of a lot, or how hard it was to cross over the two films…where the snow meets the sand.” (Thanks, Dave, for giving this article its interesting title.)\n\nThe night was memorable for many reasons including the wow factor of the visual elements, and also because of the people who came along, the excitement generated by the auction, and the wonderful costumes, many of which were in the cosplay competition, with the winners being:\n\nBest Costume – Helly Millet for her Empire Strikes Back Han Solo and Tauntaun\n\nBest Original Costume – Annika Wilson for her Star Wars Kylo Ren/Sith inspired dress\n\nBest Reproduction – Marion MacNally for her Raiders Marion Ravenwood market outfit\n\nBest Costume Inspired by another source – Judzea Gatt for Night Sister Merrin from Jedi Fallen Order game\n\nBest Presentation – Michael Szabo for his Revenge of the Sith Obi-Wan\n\nAs the event coordinator I want to thank everyone who attended, who bought (or sold) raffle tickets, bid for and won items in the auction, dressed up or entered the cosplay competition, participated in the trivia quiz, provided or served the meals, helped set up and clean up afterwards, took photographs, cut the cakes, greeted guests – the list goes on.

It was to the effect that apparently “modern technology is not one of some of the creative team’s strengths and proved to be a challenge”. It was a strange comment, given that the four creative team members all cope quite well with using social media platforms, 3D printing, graphic design, online publishing, etc. The only reason for making this comment appears to stem from the creative team’s known preference for using online platforms such as Facebook, but being forced to use the clunky and non-user friendly gamers Discord, which was not effective or efficient, but was used because the critic couldn’t use the majority preferred platform. So, if anything, the critic was the one who appeared to find using modern technology a challenge.\n\nOne of the earliest (and still best) time travel stories is The Time Machine, written by H G Wells in 1895, about a Victorian inventor who creates a machine that can travel backward and forward in time. It was intellectual, philosophical, exploring the possible future of humanity while also providing adventure and romance. The time traveller observed and commented on the changing nature of humanity, the division between classes and the need for a more equal world. The 1960 film adaptation remains one of my favourites, with its poignant examination of a changing world and a man caught between his elegant present and the brutality yet promise of a far-off future.\n\nIn 2003 another time travel novel was published, The Time Traveler’s Wife, written with exhaustive and mind-boggling precision by Audrey Niffenegger. Unlike so many other time travel novels, films, or TV series, where the focus was on changing events, not changing events, finding or destroying time travelling devices that could impact humanity and destroy the world as we know it, The Time Traveler’s Wife deals with people on a far more personal and intimate level.\n\nThe time traveller here is Henry DeTamble, a librarian cursed with a rare genetic disorder that causes him to spontaneously travel through time randomly, landing dazed and naked wherever the condition takes him. From childhood onwards he has learnt to survive by stealing clothes, money, food, trying to avoid being beaten, chased, yet often left dazed and battered. He also crosses paths with other different aged versions of himself, and it becomes clear that he is pulled helplessly back and forth through time to people and events that have or will have an emotional impact on him. In the course of his many unplanned time journeys, he meets his soulmate, Clare Abshire, an artist. They meet and part hundreds of times, sometimes not meeting again for days, weeks, months, or years. Clare first meets Henry when she is just a six-year-old child and he is in his early forties, although he first meets her when he is younger, in his late twenties and she is twenty (and she has already known him for 14 years but he has yet to meet her). It sounds confusing, but the author (whom I was fortunate to meet at a special evening once years ago) used a painstakingly detailed series of notes to keep track chronologically of the different aged Henry and Clare characters, so that as you read the novel, it is easy to follow what is happening, when, and to whom. There is so much jumping back and forth between the past, present and future yet the author manages to keep everything clear and comprehensible.\n\nThe novel, which I only read once because its impact on me was so gut-wrenching, has a profoundly sad, poignant core. Henry’s life is a constant battle to remember which version of himself he is, when, and trying not to be pulled back and forward in time to key, often tragic moments in his life, which are usually precipitated by strong emotional factors. Time travel is not an adventure, fun, or a chance to change the past or future, which are outside of his control. For Henry, just surviving each day is a feat in itself. Meeting his soul mate Clare, whose life is basically reduced to waiting for Henry to appear or reappear, is a mixture of pleasure and sadness, knowing that unlike other couples, he cannot promise a stable environment for them. Clare has no choice but to wait, yet also chooses to fill her life with her artistic pursuits, to give meaning outside of their relationship. But her romantic fate is sealed; there is never going to be anyone else for her except Henry, and this inevitability is a bit sad really.\n\nThe 2009 film version starring Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams suffered from not having sufficient time to explore the many, varied meetings and incidents, choosing to concentrate more on the romance. It didn’t make a lasting impression on me, leaving me feeling dissatisfied that it hadn’t covered more of the novel.\n\nNow we have the 2022 mini-series, with six episodes available now in Season 1 and Season 2 hopefully to come. Adapted by Dr Who’s Steven Moffat, this version starring Theo James as Henry and Rose Leslie as Clare, has the breathing space to explore the novel’s dense chronological to-ing and fro-ing and the slowly developing relationship between the two main characters. It succeeds in depicting the merciless, whimsical hand of time travel that subjects Henry to so many wrenches from his present to his past or future. Landing naked can be brutal, and after years of this he has become an expert (most of the time) in surviving by quickly finding clothes, money, food, and shelter to tide him over until he returns to his own time. These time shifts are so exhausting that you feel really sorry for Henry. Actor Theo James is luckily very toned so frequent shots of him naked don’t offend. He also successfully manages to convey his character at different ages, mainly twenty-six or early forties, and interacts with his childhood or adolescent selves convincingly.\n\nClare is another issue. Unlike her patient, supportive character in the novel, in this series she is often portrayed as a shrew, constantly bickering with or criticising Henry because he is the younger version rather than the more mature man she knew when she was growing up and with whom she fell in love. She also appears to lack sensitivity about the emotional, physical, and psychological cost involuntary time travel takes on Henry, seeming to punish his younger self for not being the older version, and rebelling against her fate. I don’t know why the producers chose to do this, because in the novel they did love each other and enjoy their time together precisely because they never knew when Henry would disappear again. Not having read the novel in many years, I wasn’t aware of a lot of the changes and additions Moffat has made that differ from the novel, but Clare’s combative nature did stand out. I understand the need in our current climate to make her character stronger, less of a passive presence just passing time between seeing Henry, but she seems to go out of her way to antagonise him, harp on about things that he cannot help or change. Frankly, I wouldn’t blame Henry for time travelling so much if this is what he has to come home to.\n\nThere is also the thorny issue of child grooming. Henry first meets Clare when she is just six years old, while he is in his early forties. Although he is helpless to avoid being flung back in time to meet her child version and takes great care to insist on having clothing provided, treating her like a father, overseeing her education, it is quite hard to avoid seeing it as child grooming, especially nowadays when cyber abuse is so prevalent.\n\nThe author commented on this recently, saying, “I don’t think I had encountered the word grooming in 1997 [when first writing the novel] but I was familiar with the concept. It’s obviously inappropriate for grown men to be hanging out with little girls unsupervised. That’s why it’s in the book. It’s weird. It’s the way that time travel is messing with them. It’s not meant to be shown as a model. Henry knows it’s a bad, bad idea and he’s doing his best to be hands off and parental because he’s the antithesis of somebody who is trying to groom a kid. It’s clear in the book that he is unsettled by this.”\n\nI have enjoyed watching the current series overall, with its ability to develop and explore the time travel conceit, the different versions of Henry, his struggles to keep track of when and where he is, aside from having to deal with a Clare who is often impatient, self-absorbed, and sometimes even a bit cruel, watching him squirm when trying to excuse his odd behaviour to others. The quality of the casting is particularly good, while the production values, music, sets and costumes all elevate this series about the average. There is a helpful article on the changes made from the novel to the series, which explains the differences but is best left until after you have watched the six episodes to avoid spoilers: https://mashable.com/article/the-time-travelers-wife-book-vs-show\n\n(2021 novella) by Becky Chambers\n\nDon’t be surprised if you feel the need to wander off to make a cup of tea while reading this novella. There is a whole section early on that deals with the art of tea making as well as an exploration of its therapeutic qualities. It’s similar to watching a baking show on TV when you get the urge to make something yourself because it seems so easy, tasty and appealing.\n\nBecky Chambers has written a plot-lite story, hold the conflict, similar in some ways to her standalone earlier work, “To be taught, if fortunate”, where the focus was on the characters, their experiences and interactions, with episodic visits to different planets providing a variety of backdrops and then ending rather suddenly, without resolving things. This novella is even less episodic, just someone wandering back and forward between places most of the time in their tea wagon. Some readers have described Chambers’ writing style as being “comfort science fiction” or “cosypunk”, which seems apt. The content of all the novels I have read so far avoids depictions of “evil empires, scary aliens, and space battles, where peace, love and happiness prevail” (one critic said), so this latest offering follows in that vein. It is not a style I prefer, as the lack of a strong plot, some sense of conflict or overcoming adversity, of people coming together for a common cause, et cetera, makes it seem a little bland, like whipped cream when you are hoping to sink your teeth into a lemon meringue pie, with tart and crunchy bits mingling with the fluffy bits.\n\nThe setting is the moon Panga, which orbits a planet. Little if anything is said about why the moon is the home world rather than the planet, or why people have settled there, when the settlement originally occurred, and if Earth is still inhabited. This lack of backstory explanation bothered me as I missed having a broader context, and why an entire human population would do such a major turnaround in their philosophy, lifestyle and cultural beliefs because of a passive act of non-compliance by mechanical aids they created. At some distant point in the past the human settlers relied on using and developing industry and technology, paving roads, building factories, very similar to the pattern currently seen on Earth. Why would they just suddenly give all that up because a pack of robots decided not to cooperate anymore?\n\nA few hundred years prior to the current story, the robots of Panga that worked in the factories suddenly became self-aware. They decided they didn’t want to work for humans any longer, so just stopped and wandered off into the unexplored parts of the main continent of Panga, and haven’t been seen since, becoming part of urban legend. I was surprised that humans just let the robots go without there being a battle, or some attempt to suppress and re-program them. But amazingly, people saw this change – this lessening of dependence on factories and automation – as a good thing. By the time the story begins, the Panga people have moved on to living a less industrialised life, communal, almost hippie-like. The humans decided to limit their occupation to one half of the main continent and let the other half return to a wild and untamed state, which is where, presumably, the robots went. I found this very easy acceptance of a complete change in the way people lived very hard to believe, given human nature and the tendency to want to conquer, control and change the environment. Maybe it is the author’s wish fulfillment that humanity will embrace this gentler, less aggressive way of life someday.\n\nThis information is provided along the way. It just gently, slowly seeps through the pages, rather like tea brewing, which is what the main character, Sibling Dex, does as part of being a tea monk. Dex is gender neutral, so calling them “Sibling” rather than “Brother” or “Sister” is a nice touch. Dex grew restless working as part of a group in a monastery/commune growing things in the main city, which was very noisy and crowded, so has changed their vocation. They set off in a specially commissioned ox-bike wagon, which is “double-decked, chunky-wheeled, ready for adventure”. Despite the current Pangan desire to live as close to nature as possible, the wagon has an opulent upper bedroom area that Dex loves, as well as a pop-up kitchen/prep area, space to grow a variety of herbs, a mini wind-powered turbine to power a variety of electronic comforts, and a pop-out shower. Rather like a fairy version of a Winnebago.\n\nTo be sure, there is something very soothing and reassuring about the way the tea ceremonies are described and conducted. Dex grows many different herbs, experiments with their medicinal, healing qualities, depending on what ails the person who will drink the tea. There is the setting up of the area with a table, cushions, lights, and a shrine dedicated to the Parent and Child Gods that are such an integral part of the Pangan culture (although how this came about isn’t clear). These interludes are comforting and relaxing, as they are meant to be, and Chambers’ writing effectively conveys these emotions, but is it enough to qualify as science fiction?\n\nEvery Pangan receives a personal computer (I assume similar to a combination mobile phone/tablet) on their sixteenth birthday, which can be used to communicate, promote events, exchange credits, and so on, although I was puzzled how this was possible since the people had abandoned their reliance on technology. Who makes these computers? Where do they find the parts? Is there some version of the internet (although reference is made to being in or out of reception range)? It is never really explained, and seems jarring given that these people now aspire to live in harmony with nature, to make their homes biodegradable, use recyclable materials and disturb their surroundings as little as possible.\n\nThis backdrop provides the setting against which Sibling Dex, who has a good life yet feels restless and bored, seeks something they cannot articulate, but which somehow involves being able to hear the chorus of real crickets (insects not sporting games). Not even becoming one of the moon’s best tea monks is enough anymore, and this is when Dex decides to go on what amounts to a spiritual quest off the accepted roads.\n\nBy sheer chance, or maybe it is fate, Dex encounters a robot (this is what they prefer to be known as) called Splendid Speckled Mosscap, a type of mushroom. Robots are not immortal; after a certain amount of time their parts wear out and they gracefully accept the end of their existence. Their parts are recycled and incorporated into a new version, and when this new robot “wakes”, it names itself after the first thing it sees. This is probably the aspect of this story that I most enjoyed, reading all the weird and wonderful names that the robots call themselves, including Fire Nettle, Black Marbled Frost frog, Milton’s Millipede, Pollen Cloud, Small Quail Nest, Blanket Ivy, Otter Mound, Termites, Morning Fog, Mouse Bones, Sandstone, and Wolf-and-Fawn.\n\n“Wild-built” refers to the fact that robots are not the same ones that wandered off into the wilderness centuries before but are composed of parts of other, previous robots. Most robots tend to become specialists in one field, or so interested in one thing that they can remain motionless for years just observing a seed growing into a sapling, or a stalagmite forming in a cave. Mosscap regrets (inasmuch as a robot can feel regret) not being a specialist but distracted and interested in everything. Having met Dex and confided this, Mosscap is reassured to learn that it could be considered a “generalist”. Dex’s talents as a tea monk who mixes brews to suit a person’s mood or as a fixer upper also appear to work on an entity that cannot imbibe tea or any other food or fluid that a human would relish.\n\nThe robots had promised once, a long time ago, to return to check in on the people, to ask the question “what do people need?” and not leave until this is answered. But by meeting the dissatisfied, restless Dex first, Mosscap is challenged because there is no immediate answer Dex can give. They suggest that Mosscap would be better off travelling to a village or town and asking their question there, which is what Mosscap may do.\n\nThe plot, such as it is, involves Dex’s determined, often uncomfortable side-trip to see a particular place they have heard about, and hope that their need to find an answer to the purpose of their life may be revealed. Mosscap insists on accompanying Dex on this detour for its own reasons. I wasn’t impressed by Dex’s sulky, ungrateful rejections of Mosscap’s help, especially when strength and local knowledge are required. It just came across as petulant, but eventually Dex begins to appreciate that being alone is not always best, and that a companion can enhance so much of what is usually taken for granted.\n\nWhile this story offers a gentle, pleasant read, the frequent philosophical forays into what it means to be alive, to be a human or a robot, about whether having a purpose is the goal or whether it is enough just to live, to be, becomes overly preachy. Chambers does succeed in dulling the reader’s anxieties, as is made clear in the dedication “for anybody who could use a break”, offering them a mental and physical journey (a metaphorical cup of tea) into previously occupied woods that may still have hidden dangers (such as apple spiders, so named because their bodies are as large as, well, apples) but also breathtaking beauty. Once the goal is reached (Dex wants to see the remains of a hermitage and Mosscap goes along on the way to going somewhere else) the story just ends. It’s like sitting in front of the TV at the start of a show, inadvertently snoozing partway and then waking again at the end, wondering what you missed.\n\nNothing much, it turns out. It’s just a gentle rumination by a tea monk who is bored and lacks purpose, who meets up with an inquisitive robot on a quest to ask a question, both of whom go off the beaten track in search of something, and to hear crickets if they’re lucky.\n\nSome reviewers have raved about the gentle, soothing, comforting nature of this novella, while others find it just dull and without a gripping plot. The fact that the description on the cover is “a Monk and Robot book” implies there are more books to follow (a check revealed a sequel is on its way), which may account for the abrupt end, which was the first thing I had read that actually rivetted my attention.\n\nDare I say that this may not be everyone’s cup of tea?\n\nI spent my annual leave inside and away from possible COVID-related infections and caught up on lots of different films and TV series, which were available primarily through Netflix, Disney+ and Binge. Star ratings are out of 5, and some comments may constitute spoilers.\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife (2022) 4 stars\n\n(Rated PG-13)\n\nDir: Jason Reitman (son of original Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman)\n\nCast: McKenna Grace (Phoebe), Finn Wolfhard (Trevor), Carrie Coon (Callie), Paul Rudd (Gary Grooberson)\n\nSet 32 years after the end of Ghostbusters II, a single mother and her two children move to a new town in Oklahoma, inheriting their grandfather’s dilapidated farm, and soon discover they have a connection to the original Ghostbusters and the secret legacy their grandfather left behind.\n\nAs this was a recent release, I don’t want to spoil the fun for those of you still planning to see it, but Ghostbusters: Afterlife was such a pleasure to watch without knowing too much about it. Yes, there are strong links to the two original Ghostbuster films, and the last part of this film closely follows similar kinds of events as those covered in the earlier films, but it’s how the central characters get there that is so enjoyable to watch. (I know this film has received a lot of poor reviews but I can only base mine on what I saw and how I experienced it, which was positively.)\n\nA stand-out for me was the young lead, Egon Spengler’s granddaughter Phoebe (McKenna Grace), with her wild mop of brown hair, rimmed glasses and Dad jokes, and her passion for science. Her older brother Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) is bored and wants to fit in with the cool kids in the new town, while their mother (Carrie Coon) struggles to make ends meet and keep her weird little family together.\n\nPaul Rudd is a delight as always, playing a casual relief teacher with a passion for all things Ghostbuster-related, who inevitably becomes caught up in the children’s spectral adventures. There are some nicely poignant moments and a few surprises (SPOILER: original actors reprise their characters from the first film). Perhaps having watched the original films, as well as the overly maligned 2016 all-female reboot, I derived a lot more pleasure from the emotionally pitched moments than someone a lot younger who might not have the original films as context. I recommend this as an enjoyable, well made and fun-filled film ideal for younger audiences as well as those of us who grew up watching the earlier incarnations.\n\nRated PG-13, it has some mildly scary scenes so parents with children under 13 should supervise viewing.\n\nDon’t Look Up (2021, Netflix) 2.5 stars\n\n(Rated R, contains adult themes, profanity + some drug use)\n\nDirector and writer: Adam McKay\n\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Jonah Hill, Timothée Chalamet, Mark Rylance\n\nTwo astronomers (Leonardo DiCaprio as nerdy Dr Mindy and Jennifer Lawrence as emotionally wrought PhD candidate Dibiasky) discover a comet is headed directly toward Earth, and when it hits the planet in six months’ time it will completely obliterate all life. They bring their discovery to the White House where they are treated dismissively by Trump-like President Janie Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her useless son/chief of staff (Jonah Hill). They next take their discovery to the media where it is treated as a joke on a morning talk show, and later as an opportunity to make money from the incredible wealth of resources the comet contains, if only there is a way to access it safely.\n\nThe film has many COVID-19 like similarities, where a startling world-wide event is treated by social media variously as a joke, a trend, a new religion, a lie created by shifty scientists who want to oppress humanity, or something we don’t need to worry about, really.\n\nThe American president is obviously a parody of the former Orange President, being ignorant, vain, easily flattered and just in it for self-aggrandisement. Her choice of her son as Chief of Staff echoes the earlier president’s blatant nepotism in appointing family and friends to key government positions. The government tries to keep the public ignorant of what is happening, even having rallies where the catchcry of “Don’t look up!” is printed on banners, t-shirts and hats – all too similar to the insidious “Make America great (again)”.\n\nMark Rylance’s character owns the company Bash, which is obviously an unsubtle nod to mega-squillion entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson and their space race efforts. He basically repeats his role from Ready Player One, albeit with a more sinister and self-serving attitude.\n\nWhile the film had its clever moments and a very serious message to convey, it takes so long to set up, introduce characters, and then spends too much time on sub-plots it doesn’t need to, that it makes this film far longer than it needs to be. I got to a point where I kept looking at my watch to see how much more I had to sit through. The director enjoys showing how clever he is and all the pointed criticisms he can aim, but it becomes very self-indulgent and repetitive.\n\n(SPOILER: The most touching part is at the end, when those left on Earth who had tried so hard to avert the impending catastrophe experience a heart-felt thanksgiving-style dinner and make their peace.)\n\nMy biggest gripe with this film is the basic premise of taking such a discovery to the American President who does nothing, whereas real-life Professor Brian Cox makes it clear that there are world-wide agencies set up constantly monitoring the planet for just such an event, which would be dealt with by a world-wide response. You can watch Professor Brian Cox’s sensible and soothing breakdown of the science behind this film at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntaidEKs_Ks\n\nFar wittier and more entertaining are these two Netflix films, Death to 2021, and its prequel Death to 2020. These films do better what “Don’t Look Up” tried and failed to do. They comment on world events but in clever, concise and entertaining ways. Using a semi-documentary style using actual footage of events from the previous year, actors like Hugh Grant portray stereotypes of a cross-section of people reacting to events with comedic effect.\n\nBoth of these films are an hour long, and I thoroughly enjoyed the biting satire and scathing comments often uttered by influencers, Republicans and talk show hosts. Highly recommended as a way of reviewing the past two years.\n\nEncanto (2021, Disney+) 3.5 stars\n\n(Rated PG – Parental guidance recommended)\n\nDirectors: Byron Howard, Jared Bush\n\nOriginal songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda\n\nCast includes Stephanie Beatriz as Mirabel; Wilmer Valderrama and John Leguizamo\n\nThe Madrigals are a special family who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia in a charmed place called the Encanto. The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift, every child except Mirabel, that is. However, she may be the Madrigals’ last hope when she discovers the magic surrounding the Encanto is now in danger.\n\nI must confess up front that I am one of the few people out there who didn’t like Hamilton (the musical). The musical style just wasn’t to my taste, with the rapping and repetitive phrasing, so I wasn’t expecting to like the music in Disney’s latest animated offering, Encanto. The film is influenced by the people, culture and life of Columbia, including its musical influences, so full marks to the filmmakers for doing their research and incorporating so much of Columbian music, art and other influences into this lively and very colourful animation.\n\nI really liked the lead character, Mirabel (voiced by Brooklyn 99’s Stephanie Beatriz), the only one in her family not to inherit a special talent. I would have thought her love, optimism and fierce loyalty made her special, but she lacks a mystical talent, such as turning everything into flowers, or having Herculean strength, or curing ills through her cooking. The songs came thick and fast, establishing history, personalities and current conflicts, but with the exception of the two standout songs “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” and “Surface Pressure”, the rest were not memorable enough, and I forgot them as soon as they were over. My daughter (26 years) happily sang along to most of the songs and really likes them (although she has the soundtrack and has probably listened to it a lot), so it is probably just me. I liked “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” because it addressed a mystery, was spooky, catchy, tuneful, clever, entertaining and turned out to be integral to the plot.\n\nAs a side note, the middle sister, super-strong Luisa, who sings “Surface Pressure”, provides an honest glimpse into the stress she feels from her family to always be strong, always the one others can depend on. Luisa has become a firm favourite of little girls who identify more with her than with the insipidly pretty Isabella, or even the heroic Mirabel. When Disney planned its merchandise lines, it seriously underestimated the demand there would be for a Luisa doll with its muscles and strength, not as many of which were produced as the more predictably “pretty” Isabel doll.\n\nWhat I particularly liked was the fact that those with the special gifts were not all happy, whereas Mirabel thought she would be delirious with joy if she had a special talent. Solving the mystery of what happened to her Uncle Bruno, and striving to re-unite the family, were of far more interest to me than the unending parade of overly energetic and forgettable tunes. Although the matriarch Abuela finally reconciles with Mirabel, who so generously forgives her after learning about her past, I found Abuela to be monstrous in the way she focused on the Encanto to the exclusion of what really mattered, in this case her ostracised, criticised and undervalued granddaughter.\n\nLuca, another Disney animated film, was superior for me in its use of exquisitely rendered settings (ocean, forests, seaside towns) and didn’t need the characters bursting into song all the time to move the story along. But children will like the colour, movement and pace while adults will enjoy the clear messaging about valuing everyone for who they are, not what magical talent they may possess.\n\nDune (2021) 3.5 stars\n\n(Rated PG-13 – appropriate for 13 years +)\n\nDir: Denis Villeneuve\n\nCast: Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem\n\nFirst of a planned two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert, this version of Dune mainly covers the first half of that book. Set in the far future, it follows noble born Paul Atreides as his family, the House Atreides, is thrust into a war against the House Harkonnen for the deadly and inhospitable desert planet Arrakis (Dune) and its precious, rare commodity, melange (spice), which is vital for space travel.\n\nI read Dune the novel and its sequels in my early twenties and remember it making a huge impact on me in terms of my reading choices, understanding and appreciation of science fiction. (I was also very fortunate to have Frank Herbert sign all my copies of the Dune series when he was a guest at AussieCon Two, the 43rd World Science Fiction Convention, in Melbourne in 1985.) I also freely admit to watching and enjoying the David Lynch version from 1984, and most particularly loving the wonderful soundtrack score by Brian Eno and Toto. I watched the new Villeneuve version on Apple TV on a large screen, and without the benefit of subtitles, so perhaps my enjoyment of the film was influenced by not seeing it on a cinema screen.\n\nVilleneuve’s previous film, Arrival, was such an all-encompassing pleasure for me that I have watched it many times and hoped that his interpretation of Dune would be similarly gripping. His Blade Runner 2049 had some problems but overall, I also enjoyed that journey and the questions it raised about being human. The new Dune was a bit of a letdown for me, given the rave reviews by viewers who loved the imagery, screenplay adaptation and soundtrack music (by Dune enthusiast Hans Zimmer). It certainly won lots of Oscars recently for its technical prowess. I could compare most of its story beats with the 1984 version, in terms of the key scenes, characters and world-building that were portrayed. Yes, Lynch’s version was a bit weird in places, a lot of the acting was rather wooden, the special effects haven’t aged at all well, and it jumped around disjointedly, but this version followed a similar route, just with bigger and better sets and effects, and access to modern technological advances. I do not like the Hans Zimmer score at all, and was relieved I hadn’t paid the hefty asking price in advance to secure a CD copy. I can acknowledge it uses music, voices and sounds to create an effective, eerie mood and worlds, but as I also like to listen to soundtracks later and just become immersed in and moved by the gorgeous music itself, this wasn’t possible for me with the Zimmer score.\n\nI also had a lot of difficulty understanding Rebecca Ferguson’s Lady Jessica, with her tendency to whisper important facts so that I couldn’t catch what she was saying. This may have just been due to watching the film on TV and not in a cinema. What I really liked were the delicately dragonfly-winged ornithopters, which so closely matched Herbert’s written vision. There is a lot to like about the new version in terms of the sweeping desert views, the subterranean ecosystem and the harsh Fremen, but I don’t consider it to be more of a triumph of interpretation or dramatic portrayal than the earlier version. It mainly benefits from better technology.\n\nWhat We Do in The Shadows – season 3 (2021) 4.5 stars (Rated TV-MA, not suitable for children under 17)\n\nCast: Matt Berry, Natasia Demetriou, Kayvan Novak, Harvey Guillen, Mark Proksch, & Kristen Schaal\n\nBased on the 2014 New Zealand mockumentary horror comedy film starring Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi.\n\nThree traditional vampires, Nandor, Lazslo and Nadja, together with energy vampire Colin Robinson, struggle to adapt to living in 21st century New York, in a suitably creepy house on Staten Island. They are assisted by Nandor’s human familiar, Guillermo, who longs to be turned into a vampire in exchange for having loyally provided ten years of faithful service. The series is shot as a mockumentary with a film crew documenting the vampires’ adventures and interactions with both other vampires as well as humans and werewolves.\n\nI loved the original 2014 film despite the excessive gore, blood and high human death count, so the TV series, now finished its third season, quickly became a favourite viewing pleasure for me when seeking something more light-hearted. The catchy opening titles with the theme song “You’re Dead” by Norma Tanega accompanied by a series of photos of the vampires from various historic time periods hint at the cleverness to come.\n\nThe vampires have lived for hundreds of years and experienced many key moments in history, but what makes them so endearing is their relative innocence and naivete when it comes to living in the modern world. Using the telephone or a computer is so beyond them, and they are quite ignorant about how to interact with their human neighbours. These are moments of deep and abiding delight, watching these rather daggy ancient beings misinterpret or blithely ignore what seems so obvious to the rest of us.\n\nAt first, I missed the vampires from the film, particularly Taika Waititi’s gentleman vampire, but the three new characters quickly established themselves and became integral components of the TV version. Kayvan Novak’s dignified Nandor the Relentless was once the bloodthirsty leader of the fictional kingdom of Al-Quolanudar in Southern Iran and a warrior serving the Ottoman Empire. He sees himself as leader of the group and often calls for meetings to discuss trivial matters like whose turn it is to take out the rubbish. Matt Berry (IT Crowd) as Laszlo Cravensworth is an English gentleman vampire and former porn star mostly interested in having sex and avoiding exerting himself. He is married to the vampire Nadja of Antipaxos (Nastasia Demetriou), a Greek Romani vampire who turned him and later married him. They are all marvellously eccentric, melodramatic and wear the most wonderful clothes from earlier times. Rounding out their number is by far the creepiest character, energy vampire Colin Robinson (Mark Proksch), who appears to be a modern-day person and basically sucks the energy out of people by talking endlessly and boringly at them. We all know someone like him.\n\nWatch out for the wonderful cameos littered throughout all three seasons, including a vampiric council meeting featuring some top-drawer actors who have appeared as vampires over the years on TV and in films. Oh, and Nadja’s mini-me talking doll containing her Romani spirit is a scene-stealer.\n\nHighly recommended (but not for the squeamish and children under 17 years).\n\nWhen I haven’t been binge watching loads of stuff on TV, I’ve made time to read as well. Note that some comments in my reviews may include spoilers.\n\nProject Hail Mary by Andy Weir (2021, Del Rey) The blurb tells us that: “Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission – and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish. Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it. All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.”\n\nAndy Weir wrote The Martian (2011), which was made into one of my all-time favourite films in 2015. I read and loved the book as well, so when I saw that Andy Weir was going to science the proverbial s**t out of another space conundrum, I was hooked. (I have read less than stellar reviews of his second novel, Artemis, set on the moon, so doubt I will ever get around to reading that one.)\n\nProject Hail Mary is part adventure, part mystery, part flashback, part forging new friendships, part humanity struggling to survive a universe-wide calamity and lots of FUN. Although the pages and pages of scientific explanations about velocity, re-entry angles, chemical reactions, laws of physics, gravity, etc. were way beyond me (given I can’t even manage basic mathematics), I had faced similar challenges with The Martian so just tended to skim through the dense scientific exposition knowing it wouldn’t affect my overall enjoyment of the main plot.\n\nThe mystery part is when the narrator awakens and doesn’t know where, when or why he is. He is naked, weak, on a medical-style bed, being tended to by automated robots that feed and maintain him. As his fuzzy memory very slowly returns, accompanied by chapters of flashbacks that allow him to make sense gradually of why he is floating alone in space in a specially designed space craft, we as readers are as puzzled and ignorant as he is. Once he recalls his name, Ryland Grace, and the fact that he has a strong science background in molecular biology, the novel gets going at a cracking pace. Our planet is in danger from the sun dying, caused by an alien single-celled organism reproducing uncontrollably around the sun, absorbing crucial amounts of solar energy, which will cause a new ice age within 30 years. The microbe responsible for this is christened “Astrophage” by Ryland, and scientists discover that there is a star resisting its attack in the Tau Ceti system. So Ryland, through a very convoluted set of circumstances, becomes one of three astronauts tasked with travelling to Tau Ceti to discover why and if there is a cure that can save our sun and the Earth. All of this information is revealed gradually in a series of flashbacks, and the entertainment factor comes from reading how Ryland remembers things then applies them to his current situation. He is so enthusiastic about science, and in a departure from the two earlier novels, doesn’t swear but instead uses lots of harmless nonsense exclamations that add to his charm.\n\nThe heart of this story comes from the very unlikely but endearing friendship Ryland forms with another space traveller, whose home world 40 Eridani is also under attack from the Astrophage, and which has brought the alien to the same area of space in Tau Ceti to find a solution. The alien has been drifting alone in space for 40 years, the sole survivor of an unfortunate onboard event that wiped out the rest of his crew. It resembles a dog-sized five-legged spider with a stone-like exoskeleton, and lives in an atmosphere 29 times denser than Earth’s, composed mostly of superheated ammonia.\n\nEridians don’t have eyes, using echolocation instead, and they communicate in tones akin to musical notes. Ryland names the alien “Rocky” due to its appearance. (Google Rocky and there are dozens of sketches of what people think Rocky looks like.) Rocky is incredibly agile and its brilliant engineering skills enable it to create new items or adapt others out of old materials. Together, Ryland and Rocky end up living together in modified modules aboard the Hail Mary as they seek a solution to the Astrophage infection.\n\nRocky’s cheerful, can-do manner and constant encouragement, together with its cultural need for company, reminds me somewhat of the Nowhere Man from the Beatles film Yellow Submarine, despite the fact it in no way resembles the cartoon character. Every review of Project Hail Mary mentions or emphasizes Rocky as a favourite character, and its presence definitely lends emotional depth to this science-heavy mystery adventure. Rocky ironically anchors the book with a humanity that it definitely needs to maintain interest, and to offset Ryland’s almost inhuman glee when diving deeply into all that dense scientific stuff. Highly recommended for lovers of science and science fiction.\n\nAurora’s End (Aurora Cycle #3) by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff (2021, Allen & Unwin)\n\nHaving read Aurora Rising (2019) and Aurora Burning (2020), I was keen to see how the story of the Aurora Academy’s Squad 312 would play out in the third and final instalment, Aurora’s End.\n\nAs was the case with the previous two books, the third once again has alternating chapters written from different characters’ points of view, which provides various perspectives on the action. The one character who was not focused on much before, scientist/Brain Zila Madran, takes a central and key role this time around, while Gearhead Finnian de Seel also becomes the hero he always yearned to be, even if it isn’t part of his plans.\n\nHaving met the original team members of Squad 312 in the first book, it was a bit disappointing to have them split up on separate adventures in the second book. The third book basically continues straight on from the second, but as the catchphrase suggests, “It’s about time”. This can refer to the fact it’s time for us to finally find out what happens, but it also refers to a time loop that some of the squad must solve in order to return to their own time. Other members form new alliances or develop romantic feelings for people they least expected to. All this is pleasing if a little too predictable and neat.\n\nThe main aspect of the first book that was so enjoyable was having the squad of misfits discover their talents and become a team. I realise in the second book that in order for all of them to grow they needed to be split up, but the uneasy and spiky group dynamic that made the book so entertaining to read was sacrificed as a result.\n\nThe third book leaps into the realm of the hard to imagine, becoming universes-wide in its scope and impact, making it hard to grasp at times. The cryo-sleep survivor of the Hadfield colony ship, the mystery girl called Auri (Aurora Jie-Lin O’Malley), whom Alpha Team Leader Tyler Jones rescued with such unexpected consequences, is the star of the book. We found out last time that she is the Trigger, a weapon in an aeons-long war between two races, the Eshvaren (the Ancient Ones) and the Ra’haam, a kind of massive plant-like mind-entity that can take control of dead bodies and get them to do its bidding, and which is intent on universal domination. Auri must master her amazing abilities and find a way to end the conflict between the two ancient powers, and this was the aspect of the third book that least engaged me. A lot of it seemed deliberately vague in the way it was written and played out, compared with the very specific actions and relationships depicted elsewhere.\n\nI enjoyed the intense and fraught relationship that developed between Tyler Jones and Kal’s Syldrathi sister Saedii, or the way Zila would find peace after her traumatic childhood experience, and even how Scarlett Jones and Finn would become closer due to their time loop adventures where they revealed depths of character and unmined skills that their surface personas had previously obscured. The ending tied the various threads together but was curiously unsatisfying in the way it dealt with the threat of total alien domination by an essentially plant-based mega-mind entity. The clever way that past events became part of a future plan that was all part of a continuing cycle of past, present and future was well done, but not enough to make this third and final entry the satisfying conclusion I had hoped for.\n\nSome quick recommendations for those who enjoy reading behind the scenes about films and TV series.\n\nSo Say We All: The Complete, Uncensored, Unauthorised Oral History of Battlestar Galactica by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross (2018)\n\nWhile never having been a fan of the original Glen A Larson version of Battlestar Galactica, which seemed cheesy, cheap and wooden (acting and sets), I took to the Ronald D Moore reboot with glee. It was gritty, adult, enthralling, exceptionally well produced, acted and scripted, and kept me keenly engaged to the very end.\n\nThis oral history is basically a series of quotes from people who were involved in the production of the original and reboot series. It is divided into chapters based on themes (cast, scripts, ideas, network battles, costumes, sets, etc.), and people offer their opinions, recollections, versions of events that slowly build to provide an incredibly thorough and detailed insight into what it took to make both series.\n\nHaving read and thoroughly enjoyed The Fifty Year Mission: The Oral History of Star Trek by the same team, I knew I would enjoy this one as well. I have been slowly re-watching the Battlestar Galactica reboot movie and mini-series as a result, and despite having been made in 2003 onwards, the reboot is still a joy, and its production standards stand up incredibly well. It is very interesting to read how the reboot series evolved, how the writers, producers and other creative staff drew inspiration from current world events as well as from how some characters interacted with others. This series was obviously a passion project and a work of love, and it shows constantly through the comments captured in this dense, incredibly well compiled volume.\n\nHighly recommended for those of you who love to read all the behind-the-scenes gossip, drama and creativity that go into producing such an important part of science fiction television history. The reboot series was considered the pinnacle of TV hardcore, adult science fiction until The Expanse came along, but that’s something for another review.\n\nGalaxy Quest: The Inside Story by Matt McAllister (2021)\n\nThe film that has been called more Star Trek than Star Trek, Galaxy Quest is a lovingly realised parody of and homage to science-fiction films and series, especially Star Trek and its fandom, made in 1999. Star Trek fans even voted it the seventh best Star Trek film of all time in 2013.\n\nThe film focusses on the cast of a now defunct TV sf show, Galaxy Quest, and how the disgruntled cast members are forced to reunite to face a real-life space challenge at the behest of their biggest fans, a race of tentacled aliens called Thermians. These gentle, innocent creatures have adopted the series catch cry of “Never give up, never surrender!” and need the Galaxy Quest’s crew to save them from an evil conquering race of reptilian humanoids. Since the Thermians have recreated the Galaxy Quest ship, the NSEA Protector, one wonders why their technology is insufficient to defeat the evil aliens, but apparently they lack the strategy and cunning of humans.\n\nAnyone who has watched Galaxy Quest will tell you how wonderfully funny, ironic, sweet and spot-on this parody is, because of the loving care with which it was created. It also helped having such a stellar cast of top-shelf actors, and the SPFX wizards who worked so hard to bring the creators’ vision to the screen.\n\nThis authorized book explores the process of making the movie, from the initial idea through to development, filming, and postproduction. It examines the film’s visual effects, with artists at ILM and Stan Winston Studio revealing how they used a mixture of miniatures, puppets, prosthetics, and CGI to bring to life the movie’s creatures and starships. The book includes many new interviews with Galaxy Quest‘s cast and crew, including Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Sam Rockwell, and previously unseen photos and concept art.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed reading this making of…book, but my only quibble is that it was a bit light on in terms of depth of content and background information. If you compare this, for example, with the Making of ALIENS by J. W. Rinzler (2020), now there is a very deeply detailed, exhaustively researched reference work that absolutely delved into every possible nook and cranny to bring to light as much trivia and background as humanly possible.\n\nGalaxy Quest: The Inside Story is more an affectionate examination of the various stages in the film’s creation, capturing its humour and why it has endured so well. Make sure you try to catch Never Surrender- A Galaxy Quest Documentary (2019), celebrating the 20th anniversary of the film.\n\nI grew up watching Christmas movies (not always but usually romantic comedy types) that I often watch again each festive season. It’s like wrapping yourself in a fluffy, warm blanket of wholesome, familiar goodness. One of my favourites is the original Christmas in Connecticut (1945 version starring Barbara Stanwyck). Barbara plays a city woman who writes a domestic column for a newspaper, full of recipes and anecdotes from her perfect married life in a gorgeous house in Connecticut. The trouble is, she can’t cook, she lives in an apartment in the city, she isn’t married and definitely doesn’t have a newborn baby. What will happen when her fake persona gets exposed? Seeing her out of her comfort zone, depending on a long-time friend who is an excellent cook, meeting a heroic sailor on leave who falls in love with her despite thinking she is a married mother, and trying to prevent her demanding boss from discovering the truth makes this film fun, sparkling, and keeps the characters on their toes. I haven’t ever seen Barbara Stanwyck in another role where I liked her, but this one film makes up for that. There was a remake with Dyan Cannon that should be avoided at all costs. If ever there wasn’t the need to remake a film, this is it.\n\nI only saw It’s a Wonderful Life (the 1946 Frank Capric classic starring James Stewart) later in life (how had I managed not seeing it earlier?). It is quite long, and the second Back to the Future film owes a great deal to its plot, but it is one of those films that moves you every time. The series of events that trap James Stewart’s character in Bedford Falls while others get to leave and have adventures are quite poignant. It is only when his guardian angel in training, Clarence, shows him how horrible life in Bedford Falls would have been if Stewart’s character never existed, that we can appreciate the importance of every single person and their possible impact on those around them. His love interest, played by Donna Reed, has the patience of a saint and an enduring love for her husband that he sometimes doesn’t deserve. The final few scenes in the film, when the town gathers around to support Stewart’s character at his bleakest moment, are so inspiring and a huge payback for a similar scene earlier in the film. You’ll believe an angel gets his or her wings every time a bell rings!\n\nAlthough not strictly a Christmas film per se, Little Women does have many scenes set during the festive season. I have watched so many film and TV versions of this adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s beloved novel that I have lost count. My favourite film version is the one from 1994 starring Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon, directed by Aussie Gillian Armstrong. It has energy, emotion, well cast characters and a real sense of the time in which it was set. Greta Gerwig’s recent version (2019) starring Saoirse Ronan repelled me due to the jarring time jumps, so I’ve only seen that once. The standout in that version was Florence Pugh’s Amy – she could read the paper and I would be entranced.\n\nI also have a sentimental attachment to the 1978 TV version starring Susan Dey (who famously appeared in The Partridge Family). She captured tomboy Jo’s independent streak and her keen desire to do something women weren’t meant to do (be published authors). Another TV miniseries version with Maya Hawke (2017) was also vastly enjoyable and realistically depicted the poverty and hardships of the March family.\n\nI also enjoy comedies such as Elf (2003) starring the frenetic Will Ferrell, which I only saw for the first time a few years ago. Ferrell just laps up the fun and you get caught up in his child-like wonder and enthusiasm. It’s like discovering Christmas all over again as a child might perceive it.\n\nOne strictly for the adults is Bad Santa (2003, starring a potty-mouthed Billy Bob Thornton). This film is shocking in its crudity, swearing and violence but it is so cheeky that it’s hard to be offended.\n\nA perennial favourite of many is Love, Actually (2003). I like a few parts but not most of it, so tend to leave the room a lot to avoid some characters and story lines that are irritating, trite or fail to engage. An example is Laura Linney’s character, who has a brother in a psychiatric facility. She has devoted so much of her own life to his care and wellbeing that when she has the chance for a romance of her own, it is almost as though she uses her brother as an excuse not to become involved. Perhaps not others’ favourite mini-story, I really like the one with Hugh Grant as the bachelor Prime Minister who becomes attracted to Martine McCutcheon, she of the generous curves. Theirs is a romance I find enjoyable and light-hearted. The story with Emma Thompson and her philandering husband played by Alan Rickman has the film’s most poignant moment, when she discovers he is cheating on her, yet she must maintain a brave front for their children, and for her own pride. So there are bits in this film to be liked, but not enough to endure sitting through the whole thing repeatedly.\n\nNo mention of Christmas films would be complete without Die Hard (1988 – YES, it IS a Christmas movie!). Despite the constant debate about whether it is just a movie set during Christmas, or a Christmas movie, I am in the latter camp, proudly so. This film is so superbly plotted, acted and directed that I watch it at least once every year. It has love, redemption, second chances, a Christmas work party, Christmas presents and Christmas carols, so in my mind it is definitely a Christmas film and infinitely re-watchable. One of Bruce Willis’ best outings, and with the superbly sinister Alan Rickman as the bad guy Hans Gruber.\n\nAnother favourite is While You Were Sleeping (1995), starring a luminous Sandra Bullock and a wonderfully appealing Bill Pullman. It is set at Christmas and depicts a lonely yet lovely woman’s yearning for a family, to belong to someone and recapture the sense of family she knew as a child. It doesn’t hurt that the family of the man with whom she falls in love are full of wonderful, amusing, zany characters. Bill Pullman is so marvellously wholesome you can’t help falling in love with him. The less estimable Peter Gallagher as the comatose brother with whom Sandra Bullock’s character initially falls in love still manages to generate laughs, mainly through a running gag where his wallet and apartment feature many photos of himself, no-one else, clearly hinting at his ego and vanity.\n\nThere is a whole separate genre of Christmas movies produced by Hallmark and Netflix, often based on romance novels published by Mills & Boon or Harlequin. There is nothing particularly wrong with these films, because they are produced to appeal to people who love watching harmless, predictable, festive-themed romantic comedies. They are formulaic (just as westerns, action, crime, science fiction and horror films are often formulaic) but there is an incredible appetite for these films, so they keep getting made. Just google “Christmas romance films” and you will be inundated with choice. Netflix seems to have cornered the market on these romantic comedies lately, and two I watched recently are Love Hard and A Castle for Christmas, both made in 2021 and available now on Netflix.\n\nLove Hard depicts a young woman unlucky in love (aren’t they always?) who gets duped (catfished) into falling for the man of her online dreams who is actually nothing like his screen self. It’s a gentle, quirky comedy where two quite disparate people from different backgrounds find they have a lot more in common than they thought, with their initial friendship developed over a series of frank and friendly phone conversations. The fact that the young woman also deceives or catfishes another person shows how easy it is to fool yourself into thinking it’s okay to lie to get what you want. It’s predictable, overly cute in places, but the male protagonist, despite being a nerd, obviously has a heart of gold. I’d rate this one 6/10 mainly for the endearing performance by the male lead played by Jimmy O Yang.\n\nAs to A Castle for Christmas, this one is really only worth mentioning because it features two mature age people finding love again after life has dealt them some disappointments, leaving them cynical and bitter. He is a Scottish Duke (naturally) played by the wonderful Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride), whose castle and grounds have left him in massive debt as he can’t afford the upkeep. The heroine is a successful romantic novelist played by a rather stern-faced Brooke Shields (The Blue Lagoon). For a castle and Duke in such debt, I couldn’t suspend my disbelief every time there was a shot of the miles of garlands, tinsel, lights and other Christmas decorations literally obliterating the walls, windows, doors, ceilings, nooks and crannies of the Scottish castle. The Duke wouldn’t be in so much debt if he just refrained from splashing out on the sheer quantity of festive trimmings. Having a mature age couple is also a change from those perky young types who always look glowing, toned and able to bounce back from various disasters, binges and late nights. A Castle for Christmas also features a group of locals who meet regularly at the pub where they sit around knitting and eavesdropping on others, adding a bit of local flavour. There was one scene featuring the arrival of an American man and his bimbo-ish companion, which seemed to suggest he was the ex-husband of Brooke Shields’ character, but then we didn’t see them again, so I wondered whether they were part of a larger sub-plot that got cut out. Not a memorable film, but the stately old castle and the lushly green and snowy Scottish scenery were lovely, so I’m giving this one 6/10, because it was harmless fun and a pleasant way to pass the time while decorating my own Christmas tree.\n\nBecky Chambers (2019)\n\nHaving become acquainted with author Becky Chambers through her Wayfarer series starting with The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet (2014), I have since read the remaining books in that series. None grabbed my interest as much as the first one, although they all contribute towards building an interesting, proposed future for Earth and humanity, out in the stars, co-existing with other species.\n\nA standalone novel by Chambers, To Be Taught If Fortunate follows the adventures of four astronauts/scientists on a mission to ecologically survey four possibly habitable worlds fifteen light-years from Earth. Earth itself is struggling to survive centuries of abuse from climate change, pollution and exhaustion of its natural resources, so there is a strong imperative to find new worlds to settle on. This crew is one of several that set out on exploratory missions, but the focus is mainly on the crew of the ship Merian.\n\nThe title comes from a quote by Kurt Waldheim, Secretary General of the United Nations, which was included as a message on the Voyager spacecraft:\n\nI send greetings on behalf of the people of our planet. We step out of our solar system into the universe seeking only peace and friendship, to teach if we are called upon, to be taught if we are fortunate. We know full well that our planet and all its inhabitants are but a small part of the immense universe that surrounds us and it is with humility and hope that we take this step.\n\nAccording to the book, traveling far distances is now possible thanks to “somaforming”, a biological engineering process whereby the astronauts themselves can survive long periods of suspended animation and exploration on different planets by undergoing temporary genetic changes. These modifications allow them to survive heavier or lighter gravities by developing extra muscle fiber, or glittering skin to reduce exposure to radiation, or other changes to cope with extremes in climate and so on. During each of their long sleep periods, they are suspended in torpor chambers and physically modified depending on which planet they will next land on and explore.\n\nThe four exoplanets (worlds that don’t orbit our sun) that the crew of mission specialists explore are each highly individualized and radically different, requiring different genetic modifications. The four crew members are also distinctly different, ranging from a talented engineer to a passionate biologist, yet they work well as a team, sometimes sharing their beds and sometimes becoming so intensely involved with studying the four planets that they become isolated within themselves.\n\nThe book opens with the narrator, Ariadne, one of the crew of the deep space explorer Merian, asking the reader of her log entries to read everything she has written, rather than skipping to the end. Apparently by immersing ourselves in the crew’s experiences, we as readers will be better placed to reach a decision armed with all relevant facts. The log entries each take 14 years to reach Earth and receiving a reply takes another 14 years, so by the time the crew has explored all four worlds, they will have been away from Earth for several decades. There are indications that all is not good on the Earth the crew has left behind, and the question Ariadne and her companions need answered is whether they should go back home, or settle on one of the planets, or return to their torpor chambers to await a decision from Earth that may never come.\n\nI enjoyed reading about each of the four exoplanets explored, starting with Aecor, an ice world with life swirling beneath its frozen surface. The crew relish their time there and make some important biological discoveries. Next is Mirabilis, a world teeming with plant and animal life that is endlessly fascinating and reminds me a bit of James Cameron’s Pandora in the film Avatar. The author’s writing style is always imaginative and engaging, so that I became quickly immersed along with the crew of the Merian as they explore each world. It is on the third planet, Opera, however, that things take a depressing turn, given that the crew hasn’t received any communications from Earth for the past five years. They are almost unable to land, given that there is very little land and a lot of water covering the planet. What is worse is when the ship does land, it quickly becomes covered by indigenous creatures that basically cover the entire exterior of the ship, including the windows, and prevent the crew from even leaving the ship to explore. The depiction of each crew member’s descent into depression, compounded by the endless squealing and sucking noises emitted by the creatures, is very effectively done.\n\nEventually the crew decides to leave Opera, having spent several months trapped onboard with very little to do, and makes their way to the fourth and final planet on their list, Votum. This wasteland of a planet is perpetually locked with one side in full light, the other in eternal darkness. But at least it is somewhere the crew can actually explore and not be trapped within the ship. They make a startling discovery (my grasp of science is tenuous, so I only got the main idea that life didn’t originate on Earth) and devote the rest of their three and a half years’ allocated time on Votum doing cataloguing and research, and along the way regaining their mental equilibrium.\n\nThe book ends unresolved. Where should the crew go next if they don’t return to a possibly lifeless Earth? Their mission is to catalogue, not colonise. There is the Tivael system, which has three other exoplanets that may also have sustainable life. They don’t see that they have the right to make the decision, however, so this is left to the reader, who stands in for whatever decision-making body might remain on Earth.\n\nThis is what made this book ultimately unsatisfactory for me – the dangling, unresolved nature of the crew’s decision. I felt I had just spent years with these people, suffering and celebrating along with them, and to then have such an open-ended conclusion feels like a cop-out. I can see what the author is trying to do, which is to get the reader to make a morally or ethically based decision themselves, having gone on the journey. But what it does instead, for me at any rate, is turn the book into an episodic series of incidents, stop-overs on different worlds, with not a lot of anything gained overall by the time the fourth planet is visited.\n\nThe book reminded me of the excellent Christopher Nolan film Interstellar, which also saw astronauts set out on missions to find other habitable worlds, given that Earth was becoming unviable. Those astronauts’ journey passed in just days, weeks and months for them, but years and decades elapsed for those left behind on Earth. The astronauts explored other worlds, which were vastly different from each other, and this was particularly where I felt there was a connection to the To Be Taught book. Interstellar did it better, I believe, mainly because the exploration led to a resolution, a sense of moving on, progressing, learning from mistakes and trying to ensure that the mistakes of the past were not taken with humanity as it headed out into the stars.\n\nAn enthusiastic review I read recently on a social media feed led me to buy The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet, a 2014 novel by Becky Chambers. I know I’ve come a bit late to discovering this work, but I’m always looking for previously unheard of, interesting or different SF to read, something that creates a buzz of excitement. One critic described it “as though Firefly and Guardians of the Galaxy had one hyperactive and excited baby”. Having read it I can admire its depth, characterisation and world building, but it seems to share its roots with what has come before, classics such as ALIEN, ALIENS, Starship Troopers, Bladerunner, Almost Human, Firefly and many other excellent SF films and TV series.\n\nThis doesn’t make The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet a disappointing entry in the genre, just one that is sometimes derivative or induces a sense of déjà vu. As Han Solo in Star Wars said, “didn’t we just leave this party?”\n\nAuthor Becky Chambers has an impressive resumé that makes her ideally suited to write SF themed novels. Raised by parents with interests or careers in astrobiology, aerospace engineering and rocket science, this novel is littered with space faring jargon and whole pages of conversational exposition describing tunnelling through space, interplanetary wars, character histories, the latest tech and other space-based activities. Not being science-savvy, despite loving to read SF novels, I was totally out of my depth when reading the stuff on space tunnelling, and despite re-reading it in the vain hope I would come to understand what was involved, I couldn’t grasp the technicalities because, dammit, Spock, I’m not a physicist!\n\nWhat books such as this, or films like ALIEN and ALIENS, or TV series such as Firefly, do and do so well, is create believable SF scenarios by populating them with realistic, engaging characters. Whether they are gung-ho military types, socially awkward science boffins or grunts eking an existence as grease-stained space jockeys, their humanity, flaws, ambitions, and interactions with those around them make the time spent with them enjoyable. I might not know what a “modder” or “imubot” actually is, but I can grasp enough to get by and keep reading. They are details, background, colour and flavour, but I don’t mind if I can’t picture them all.\n\nLike the newbie Rosemary Harper who comes onboard the Wayfarer tunnelling space craft at the beginning of The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet to work as a glorified clerical assistant, I was similarly awed and confused by the ship’s environment and species-diverse crew. She has to familiarise herself with the different races and species onboard, treading carefully to avoid making cultural, gender or linguistic gaffes. I enjoyed the naturalist, overlapping dialogue peppered with pop cultural references, which sometimes reminded me of the exchanges between Brett and Parker in ALIEN. It was reassuring to know that in the future not everyone talks about noble stuff all the time but just ordinary, everyday things.\n\nThe more I read, the clearer it became that this novel’s focus was on the characters and their personal journeys, with different chapters being devoted to learning more about everyone’s backstory, especially if they happened to be visiting a home world or a place where they might meet someone important from their past, or an event that triggered a painful memory. This was done more successfully for some characters than others, and tended to give the narrative structure a predictable feeling, that sense of, okay, whose backstory am I going to read about next? There was a definite sense that this book was more concerned with the characters and less with action. There are a handful of scenes that are a bit shocking or emotionally charged, because they come out of nowhere, disrupting the cosy, comfortable onboard routine of each character that we get to know like a friend. These scenes finally move the action along, but it’s obvious it isn’t the arrival at the destination that is front and centre but getting there that matters, hence the title’s reference to being a long way.\n\nNot all the crew get along, which makes the unfolding story more interesting and realistic. The ship’s algaeist, Artis Corbin, who prefers to tend to his algae tanks in his lab than interact with his crewmates, is viewed by the others as being anti-social, grumpy and very difficult to get along with (almost as though he was an android). When I finally learned more about his past, and how something he experienced during the voyage led to a change in his behaviour, it was a bit too little too late. I had expected more of a surprise, rather than the predictable father-son clash (despite the unusual nature of their connection). He was one character that didn’t get, or perhaps warrant, more space in this novel. I also found the rather contrived situation where he owed his release from a tricky situation to the one crew member that he clashed with the most to be a bit too much of a coincidence.\n\nMore interesting and successful character arcs and interactions came mainly from the reptilian pilot Sissix, an Aandrisk, with feathers, scales and a tail, who loves to demonstrate physical affection but finds it hard to do so among standoffish humans. She has a close, platonic relationship with the ship’s human captain Ashby, who grew up on an Earth Exodus fleet ship. Their relationship reminded me strongly of the one between Malcolm Reynolds and Zoe from Firefly, although I kept picturing Ashby looking like Phil Coulson from The Agents of SHIELD.\n\nSissix and one of the crew become romantically involved, and the way the same-sex relationship unfolds and is depicted avoids any sensationalism or prurience – it is so delicately and respectfully handled. No less touching is the odd relationship between the ship’s AI, Lovey (short for Lovelace), who reminded me strongly (in terms of her personality) of Helva from The Ship Who Sang by Anne McCaffrey [1969]. Lovey runs the ship, is aware of all its functions, and keeps a motherly eye on the crew as well. She is especially close to Jenks, one of the ship technicians, a stunted human who has resisted having any “genetweaks” to correct his short stature (again, he reminded me a bit of Helva’s boss Niall Parollan in The Ship Who Sang). Jenks and Lovey enjoy a close, loving relationship despite their physical barriers, and it was very satisfying to see an AI depicted as another sentient being.\n\nJenks is also best buddies with another human tech, Kizzy Shao, who reminded me of the ship’s mechanic Kaylee in Firefly, as both are fond of wearing overalls or scruffy clothes, tend to be covered in grease and gunk, but are wizards with anything mechanical. Kizzy and Jenks spend their down time enthusing over new games, music, food, and their conversations are among some of the most entertaining and believable in this novel.\n\nLess easy to accept was what amounted to seismic character shifts in some of the crew, who were so adamantly one way in their thinking or entire upbringing, and yet had a change of heart that was almost like a personality transplant, and this was something I could have done without.\n\nThe climax of the story, involving tunnelling (creating a kind of hyperspace conduit to a distant planet, akin to folding space in Dune [book, 1969]) while trying to survive crossing through hostile, often war-ravaged interstellar space, felt a bit rushed, even awkward. The tunnel is being constructed so that the potential new members of the GC (Galactic Council), an extremely war-like race, the Toremi Ka, can be more easily accessed by the rest of the galaxy. Some members of the GC Parliament are prepared to overlook the Toremi Ka’s hostile tendencies because of the potential access to a highly desirable and much sought-after fuel substance, ambi.\n\nIt takes a stirring speech from Captain Ashby to make the Council re-assess its priorities. This part of the book reminded me of the climax in The Mote in God’s Eye [1974] by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, only not nearly as exciting or nail-bitingly intense.\n\nI had also forgotten most of the backstory about the Toremi Ka because it was described much earlier in the novel, and I couldn’t be bothered going back to find and re-read it, although I took more note of it during my second reading. Some of the information about this race is conveyed through the space equivalent of emails between Rosemary and someone she met on one of the Wayfarer’s stopovers. Another rather far-fetched moment occurs when an email containing crucial information about the Toremi Ka just happens to bounce back so Rosemary doesn’t get to read it in time, which seemed to be a clumsy bit of plotting.\n\nI often re-read favourite novels because they are comfortable and comforting, the mental equivalent of snuggling into an old jumper or blanket. I know what is coming, how events will unfold, who will die, who will live, and despite that I still enjoy them every time. It’s all to do with the way they are written, the world building, the little imaginative touches that can convey so much. The writing is engaging, unself-conscious, not even something I notice as I am so caught up in what the writing is conveying – the characters, their stories and interactions (except for those pesky scientific bits that make my brain hurt).\n\nThe Long Way to a Small Angry Planet is a bit like that – its writing style, character depiction and interactions are very engaging, and although I struggled to grasp unfamiliar science concepts, I wanted to keep reading it to the end because I liked the characters and was curious to see how they coped. Despite this warm and fuzzy feeling, I still felt disappointed that the plot and situations never seemed entirely new, original, or unique. I was often reminded of or distracted by the underlying foundations, the long lineage and influence of other SF novels, films and TV series that have preceded it. Maybe it was because of the similarities, the sense that there is nothing new under this or any other sun, that I can’t give it a perfect score. Yet I certainly enjoyed this novel enough, once finished, to immediately order the next three books in the Wayfarer series. I hope they are as enjoyable and satisfying overall to read as this first one was, but without reminding me so much of all those other works I have read leading up to this moment.\n\nWay back in 1978 I sat through (or more accurately endured with terror) the original science fiction horror masterpiece ALIEN, directed by Ridley Scott. I am a science fiction fan, not a horror fan, so there was an uncomfortable dichotomy in this film that made it difficult to sit through that first time. But watch it I did, and I have watched this movie repeatedly over the years since then, having fallen under its compelling spell. It remains a classic, re-watchable favourite on so many levels.\n\nUpon its initial release some critics bemoaned the ‘haunted house in space’ scenario, and what they saw as forgettable or indistinguishable characters (not including Ripley). Conversely what I savoured about that film were the beautifully convincing, grittily real sets, which were explored lovingly prior to the crew’s re-awakening; the haunting, chillingly alien landscape with its windswept desolation; and the unstoppable, deadly force that was unleashed on a naïve, hapless crew that basically had no training to deal with this sort of situation. Over time each character became a clearly delineated person with obvious quirks, who enjoyed some convincing by-play with each other. It made watching almost all of them meet an unpleasant demise truly sad, because they were never meant to deal with this thing from out there. I loved the innovative, poignant soundtrack score by Jerry Goldsmith (which I still have as an original record from back in the days when we used turntables for real rather than novelty value).\n\nI love the fact that even at the direst of moments Ripley could still spare a thought for Jones, the ship’s cat. Ripley’s growth from cocky, something-to-prove lieutenant to hero par excellence was a joy to watch and share. (It reminds me of that amusing meme about someone saying they knew their new romance wasn’t going to last because their partner couldn’t understand why Ripley would go back for the cat.)\n\nSpace was just another work environment, and the crew of the massive ore refinery were just blue-collar types trying to earn a living doing an unglamorous job. They weren’t heroes, soldiers or explorers, and their employers basically left them defenceless against an alien organism that had weapons potential. This is a slow burn of a film, leisurely paced at first, with brief bursts of shocking violence, escalating to a life or death battle and the triumph by a person who will never be the same. The humanity and science fiction setting won over my dislike of horror, although to this day I still cannot watch the first face hugger take down John Hurt’s character Kane on the alien ship.\n\nJames Cameron’s sequel, ALIENS (1986), had it all there in the title, being a more straight-forward science fiction drama, with the gung-ho Colonial marines no match for Ripley’s nightmarish monsters. I enjoy watching this film repeatedly for different reasons, mainly because it is just such rollicking good fun, with black humour and stunning action sequences, built around a cast of memorable, engaging characters. The mystique of the aliens is replaced by their inexorable need to conquer and reproduce; the playful early interactions of the crew, especially the ones between Vasquez and Hudson (Hudson to the well muscled Vasquez, “Have you ever been mistaken for a man?”, and Vasquez’s droll response, “No, have you?”) are just so delicious, and show the crew being relaxed and confident in their abilities.\n\nThe crew getting prepared for their ground assault accompanied by the stirring military-style drums (courtesy of soundtrack composer James Horner) never palls, but rather ratchets up the action to come, and the growing attraction between Ripley and chief ‘grunt’, Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), is a nicely human element as wel"
