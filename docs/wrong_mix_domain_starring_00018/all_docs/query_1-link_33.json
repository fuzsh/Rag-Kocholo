She integrates disparate data from manifold disciplines, including isotope geochemistry, taxonomy, taphonomy, paleoecology, morphometrics and aminoacid dating. These data are used jointly to reconstruct changes in past environmental and ecological conditions, to evaluate the quality and fidelity of the fossil record, and to better understand organism–environment interactions.\n\nUnderstanding how organisms have responded to ecological, environmental and anthropogenic variations is critical to comprehend present diversity and anticipate future outcomes (i.e., the past is the key to the future). Her main field research areas are low–latitude oceanic islands such as the Canary Archipelago and the Bahamas. Tropical islands exhibit outstanding land snail diversity in both space and time, and appear to be especially sensitive to human impact and global change. Ultimately, her research aims to help to protect terrestrial malacofaunas, which are declining in an alarming rate.\n\nShe will be appearing as part of the Geology Department's 100 Years of Women Geosciences Lecture Series.\n\nProfessor Green is the Co-Director of the Election Law Program, a joint project of the William & Mary Law School and the National Center for State Courts.

Williams.\n\nAccessibility to structurally diverse organic compounds such as carbocycles and heterocycles are of great importance to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. However the synthesis of these types of compounds require harsh conditions such as high temperatures and pressures. Dr. Louie's research aims to mediate these transitions via metal catalyzed reactions, mainly involving nickel catalysis. Dr. Louie and her team focuses on nickel-based systems not only because it is much less expensive than the more widely used palladium and platinum, but also because it offers a wider range of chemical activity, such as nickel, being a more electropositive transition metal which allows it to undergo oxidative addition readily; oxidize Nickel and lessens the electron density around the atom itself. This allows for the cross-coupling of electrophiles to occur which is pivotal in the formation of carbocycles and heterocycles.\n\nImportantly, Dr. Louie's team strives \"to do exciting and innovative chemistry while having a little fun in the process!\"\n\nProfessor Mordijck leads fusion research at William & Mary. She recently received a one-million dollar grant from the Department of Energy to study nuclear fusion as a future energy source.
