        "text": "The season is over this week - a few stragglers, high profile Harry Potter, low expectations Summer, The Iceman Cometh (does Denzel know his lines yet?), hottie Seth Numrich in Travesties.\n\nAnd what of DL fave Patti Murin? Are there more mental health days in the offing? What about her hot husband?\n\nLauren Ambrose's darker voice - does she pull it off or not? There doesn't seem to be a consensus.\n\nAnd stürm and drang over writing a musical! What's to be done?\n\nJonathan groff is NOT fat! He's thicc! And it takes a really long time to create a new musical. Like really long. I mean look at \"mean girls\". Can you imagine if they rushed that process? Or Hamilton? Those shows would be crap! Creating a new musical is one of the hardest things you could do in life. You guys have no idea. You're making yourselves sound stupid. Like, literally. Justin peck is most certainly straight. Sutton foster is such an amazing once in a lifetime talent. So captivating. Calling someone a gypsy is extremely offensive. Like extremely. One of the worst names you could call someone. The name must be changed. The lochness monster is real, so is santa clause and if you aren't circumcised then you have a higher chance of getting aids and stds also. Look around! Look around! Isn't it great to be alive right now? Are those the stupid lyrics? Haha. Do you hear how crazy this all sounds? Ok? Good.\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate I think she’s an amazing actress. Her Claire in SFU was brilliant, as was her Juliet in the Park. She has a beautiful transparent quality about her that works really well on the small screen. She’s underused in film and TV. She needs an excellent series on Hulu or Netflix. But as a legit warhorse musical singer? No. I doubt that her Fanny would have been much better. She should be working, just not in Broadway musical theater. I think she’s unfortunately not really in a position to say no, and Sher for some reason was up her ass, so why wouldn’t she do it? I would be very surprised if she takes the Tony.\n\nI hate to say it, but Benanti would have been better. Much better. Maybe she’ll replace.\n\nThe Drama Desk nominations made me laugh this morning. Some serious shade was tossed out, and rightfully so. And no, producers doing this or that don't factor so much into these, cause the DD nominating committee is small.\n\nNone of the Best Play nominees are or were on Broadway. HARRY POTTY rightfully not nominated.\n\nSPONGEBOB not nominated for score despite all its other nominations, and in a year in which musicals are dire. MEAN GIRLS the same. Translation: Even in these so-so shows, the scores suck.\n\nLauren Ambrose, Denzel Washington not nominated. ICEMAN got what it deserves: almost nada.\n\nNeither of the FROZEN ladies nominated. FROZEN almost totally ignored. MARGARITAVILLE was. LaChanze reps SUMMER.\n\nDenise Gough nominated for PEOPLE, PLACES, THINGS but not AiA.\n\nOnly one of those silly HARRY POTTY actors nominated, and, thankfully, the right one.\n\n[quote]I agree that \"the commercial theater has really changed radically in the last 6 or 7 years\" but I can't really pinpoint all the ways or give examples of how drastically different it is.\n\nr307, I agree with you. I think part of it is economics. I see this in the off-Broadway community. New York used to have a thriving, interesting off-Broadway community. I now walk through Greenwich Village and look at all the places that were once theaters and now are something else. High rents drove all those small theaters out.\n\nIt's also the lack of real talent being produced. I look at the off-Broadway choices, which once included shows like Steel Magnolias, Other People's Money, Little Shop of Horrors, Nunsense, The Fantasticks and I don't see anything that equals these productions. It's the same with Broadway, but Broadway has always had to produce on a much higher scale. Broadway has sacrificed quality. Every show needs spectacle, every show needs a star, but there's nothing that touches the audience in these shows. Their PR machines make us think we're seeing good shows but we're not. Take Hamilton for example. The concept behind the show is interesting, but the music doesn't rise to the level of even mediocre shows of Broadway's Golden Age. The PR machines are leading us to believe that what we're seeing is great, but those who have a true artistic soul know that there's nothing satisfying in that show.\n\n[quote]all of which, except for LITTLE SHOP, are glorified junk and have aged badly. (Who in heaven's name would hold up Steel Magnolias as evidence of artistic excellence???)\n\nBitch, please! The stage production of Steel Magnolias gave us a movie that is still talked about on DL today. It may not be your personal taste, but it's not a junk play. And in the Trump era, theaters all across the US should be doing Other People's Money. The movie was shit, but the stage version is quite good. And The Fantasticks was so successful its original production ran off-Broadway for 42 fucking years. People who had seen it originally were able to bring their children and grandchildren to see it. Now THAT's a classic.\n\nWhat frustrates me about Hamilton's music is that it tries to be good and just messes up.\n\nTake \"It's Quiet Uptown.\" The song starts out really beautifully. \"There are moment's that the words don't reach....\" It doesn't matter what your ethnic background is, everyone can connect with the emotion of grief. It's universal.\n\nBut then he ruins the song by coming in with that whiny shit \"Look at where we are Look at where we started I know I don't deserve you\" and ruins the song.\n\nIf he had taken the time to properly craft the song, it could have been a strong song about handling grief and every diva from Barb Streisand to Adele would have wanted to record it. But we're left with a song whose middle is whatever is lower than dreck.\n\nR330 Steel Magnolias may not be the best play ever written, but there's no denying its impact and beloved place within our culture at large, primarily via its film version but also by virtue of being in constant circulation in regional, stock, and community theatre. All that started with the play off-Broadway. What commercial off-Broadway show has had that impact lately?\n\nNot only are the plays at the level of Driving Miss Daisy and How I Learned to Drive and Three Tall Women gone from off-Broadway, gone too are the small comedies that would run a year or two, make money, and then go on to a healthy afterlife in subsidiary productions: Sylvia, Breaking Legs, Over The River And Through The Woods all had commercial runs. Now, small comedies or dramas that once would have been off-Broadway do limited runs on Broadway with stars and that's that.\n\nIt feels like when shows like Art (1998-99) started being on Broadway regularly, that was the beginning of the trend which continues with Meteor Shower, Red, and God of Carnage, all of which would have been off-Broadway without question once upon a time. Once commercial off-Broadway stopped being the place for smaller shows and a certain type of star, that was a turning point that couldn't be assigned to any one moment in time. Commerical off-Broadway, it could be argued, never really recovered from 9/11. The good \"product\" has gone to limited runs in NFP seasons or on Broadway.\n\nThe festivals pour a lot of trial product into the marketplace. And as someone mentioned, spaces are an issue. Off-Broadway has become concentrated into midtown, whereas it used to be every neighborhood had a few little playhouses. Even the upper east side had its own set of theatres. What off-Broadway show in the past ten years could fill a 299 or 499 for any length of time, beyond Jersey Boys or Avenue Q or any of the shows that had Bway runs and then moved to New World?\n\nPart of me wonders if the reason so many of the larger off-Broadway spaces are gone (Promenade, Union Square Theatre, Variety Arts, Century Center) is simply because there wasn't a regular stream of good shows with broad enough appeal to fill them.\n\nThe closing of the gap between the Broadway and off-Broadway ticket price is a factor too. How small would a show have to be to sustain on a rush ticket price (%30-40) or even a $50 ticket?\n\nMurin will get nominated but she never had a chance of winning. The other nominees will be Lenk, Kilgore, Ambrose, and probably one of the Mean Girls. R380, I’m thinking the opposite of you for leads and MFL and Bands Visit. I think Lenk and Hadden-Paton will win. I think supporting actor will go to one of their cast members. Either Norbert or Ariel stachel will win. I have no clue who will win supporting actress. It might be Lindsay Mendez. I hope not, because she seems very nice and does a fine job, but there are at least a hundred other actresses in New York who could have played the part just as well. There was nothing distinctive she brought to the role.\n\nA GAME FOR THIS SATURDAY!!!\n\nOkay fellow lovers of greatness in musicals, without looking, what show are we talking about?\n\n\" So new, so fresh, and so unassuming, even in its pretensions.\"\n\n\"Exuberantly defiant and the production explodes into every nook and cranny of the theater\".\n\n\"the only new concept in musicals on Broadway in years and it's more fun than any other this season\"\n\n\"dynamic score\" that \"blasts and soars\", \"\n\n\"not only a wildly enjoyable evening, but a thoroughly moral one.\"\n\n\"The show rejected every convention of Broadway, of traditional theatre in general, and of the American musical in specific.\n\nAnd it was brilliant.\"\n\nSaw The Play That Goes Wrong last night. Missed it on my trip last summer. Got a TDF ticket, 2nd row Mezz, the place was quite crowded, even the balcony, with little pockets of empty sections here and there. I was surprised. I thought it would be gasping for air at this point.\n\nThe play isn't anywhere as funny or clever as it thinks it is. A lot of the jokes fall flat and some of the character motivation (especially by the two female characters) makes zero logical sense. Worst was the female stage manager having absolutely no idea what happens in the play so that she's utterly shocked at one point, yet earlier knows to anticipate a missing fireplace mantle in enough timing to get a bit of stage business taken care of. I enjoyed the show on the whole, but I wouldn't say I laughed more than a half dozen times, total.\n\nI will say that the cast is busting their asses out there. I think the cast is full replacement at this point (and there was an understudy in last night), but they have their timing down perfectly and are serving the show much more than it deserves. The writers should get down and kiss their asses that they've made anything out of the dinner theater script.\n\nR 436\n\nWicked has grossed over a billion dollars on Broadway. I also remember vaguely that one of the producers admitted that worldwide it has grossed over 3.5 billion dollars. If Wicked were included in Universal's Box Office Mojo list it would be by far the biggest hit that studio has ever had.\n\nApparently The Lion King Musical has grossed over 7 billion dollars world wide for Disney. That is super fucking huge.\n\nAlso I don't know what Frozen made for Disney as a hit album and single. There appears to be an Elphaba effect as well -- it did well in English and in Verkaik's region (Germany) before steamrolling into being a huge Japanese hit as well.\n\nI thought LuPone was supposed to take GYPSY to London, too? What's the deal with never taking that show to London. Was Imelda blocking all the transfers to make sure UK audiences saw her first. I thought Imelda's overall production was sorta meh, but she was brilliant on stage and probably the best all around Rose I've seen. She sang with gusto, was funny, charming, scary, disturbing, and pathetic. She really brought it. Then, I saw the BBC broadcast...it's a completely different performance and I'd imagine Imelda is mortified that it's the performance that will be around forever. I think she was supposed to take it across the pond, but the negative responses from the BBC version seemed to stop that.\n\nLuPone was supposed to take Gypsy to London, but she chose to do the HBO pilot ( a show sorta based on a Sondheimish character) that in the end HBO passed on. Arthur Laurents got pisssed at Patti (AGAIN) and Gypsy was off.\n\nInterestingly, Bernadette’s Gypsy was supposed to start in London but came to Broadway first. I bet if it had gone as planned with London first, the kinks would have been worked out and Bernadette would have been less divisive by the time she came to Broadway.\n\nStritch was supposed to do Gypsy in London as well but financing fell through.\n\nThree and a half hours of soporific, wildly self-indulgent, pseudo-poetic rants about...well, I still don't know!\n\nShameless schtick and vaudeville with added Yiddish AND Hebrew to give it that old-timey Jewish flavor!\n\nEndless scenes that seem to have some point of view regarding the earth, and heaven and Russia?!\n\n[bold]Yup, an evening at Angels in America: Perestroika![/bold]\n\nI really wanted to love it the way I did in 1994, but alas. Why was Andrew Garfield playing Prior Walter as Rita Hayworth/Ginger Grant? His reedy and shrill voice becomes a challenge after three hours, but god love him! Couldn't Nathan Lane at least TRY to go out on a character limb and really attempt to evoke Roy Cohn more? I mean he's pretty good, but just NOT Roy Cohn, a guy lots of people are old enough to actually remember! Lee Pace was spot on, I was impressed. The rest of the cast was \"earnest\". I actually liked the angel's wings, but wanted to pluck the character regardless, almost as annoying as that British bird puppet in The Lion King! Go AWAY!\n\nIn summation: I guess to have a good AIDS play, you need lots of AIDS....and we no longer have much. I knew AiA was 30% Kushner's pseudo-intellectual gibberish, but it is really more like 70%. He does keep chipping away at you until you give in to it all though, so props for that!"
