        "text": "Yesterday I posted My Top 10 TV Male/Female Friendships: 10 to 6, now here are my Top 5:\n\n5. Ted & Lily (Josh Radnor & Alyson Hannigan) – How I Met Your Mother\n\nTed’s best friend may be Marshall, but it’s Lily that always knows what’s up. They’re cute and sweet, and we can only hope to be as lucky as Ted to have such a couple of great friends.\n\n4. Donna & Harvey (Sarah Rafferty & Gabriel Macht) – Suits\n\nDonna knows Harvey better than he knows himself, and it shows! Maybe their special chemistry on screen is due to the fact that Sarah and Gabriel have actually been BFF’s in real life for many many years.\n\n3. Liz Lemon & Jack Donaghy (Tina Fey & Alec Baldwin) – 30 Rock\n\nLiz and Jack got married at some point in the show… but it was a mistake! They both made it pretty clear that there was nothing romantic around and still, the show is awesome! Jack mentors Liz and she becomes nothing like him, but in the process, the two became inseparable.\n\n2. Derek Morgan & Penelope Garcia (Shemar Moore & Kirsten Vangsness) – Criminal Minds\n\nThese two have so many nicknames and cute ways of calling each other, that it’s a miracle that nothing ever happened. And I do hope it never will. They’re awesome exactly for that, because they are friends, besties, they bring out the best in each other, and they are just friends…\n\n1. Donna & The Doctor (Catherine Tate & David Tennant) – Doctor Who\n\nI love all of the Doctors companions in their own way, but Donna is special. From the first (and only) time since its comeback in 2005, we have a companion that, just as The Doctor, just wants a mate, and not “a mate”. She came at a great timing, right after Rose and Martha, both so clearly in love with him, Donna wants none of that! They are sassy and witty together and so much fun… Doctor-Donna! Her story is still one of the saddest for me… while all the other companions at least get to have their memories of their time with the Doctor, Donna will never know… oh… how I cried! And she was BRILLIANT with him. Catherine Tate and David Tennant are hilarious together!\n\nReasons why they’re my favorites:\n\nAnd more…\n\nand more…\n\nTV shows are much more than romances and bromances. Sometimes, a show creates a really cool relationship between a guy and a girl that doesn’t turn romantic. Yes, science somehow tells us that that’s not possible, but I don’t buy it! Here is my numbers 10 to 6 of these special friendships.\n\n10. Dean & Charlie (Jensen Ackles & Felicia Day) – Supernatural\n\nCharlie is the sister that Dean never had, and even though she was only in 4 episodes, Dean is really protective of her and she gets him to open up like no one else. Jensen and Felicia just have this great weird chemistry between them…\n\n9. Max & Andy (Kat Dennings & Ryan Hansen) – 2 Broke Girls\n\nAndy was in a relationship with Caroline, but he had way more in common with her best friend Max. When the two of them got together, it was fun all around. Too bad that he didn’t stick around for long… maybe this was the problem: he had more chemistry with Max than with his girlfriend.\n\n8. Zoe & Mal (Gina Torres & Nathan Fillion) – Firefly\n\nTwo army buddies with such different personalities, she’s all tough and he is all ironic and sarcastic. But sure it’s fun to watch! Through all this, and against Wash’s believes, they never so much thought of nothing romantic with one another… talk about friendship!\n\n7. Sheldon & Penny (Jim Parsons & Kaley Cuoco) – The Big Bang Theory\n\nThese two are funny and sweet… for a guy as annoying as Sheldon, it’s good fortune that his neighbor has such a great amount of patience… Those knocks alone are enough to drive people mad! And she even sings Soft Kitty to him!\n\n6. Chloe & Clark (Allison Mack & Tom Welling) – Smallville\n\nThrough the course of 10 years, Chloe was Clark’s BFF. She managed to get over her romantic feelings for the guy, learned his secret and even became his sidekick. It was the biggest relationship in Smallville, it certainly was the longest…\n\n»»»»»»»»»» Continue reading: numbers 5 to 1 ««««««««««\n\nHere are the first 5 couples in My Top 15 Movie Couples. Numbers 15 to 11 and 10 to 6 were posted already.\n\n5. Tony Stark & Pepper Potts (Robert Downey Jr. & Gwyneth Paltrow) – Iron Man (1, 2 and 3) and The Avengers\n\nThey have been though a lot in the past couple of movies… he almost died, then he got PTSD, she moved in and his suit almost killed her, then their house went down and she thought he had died… again…, then she almost died and he destroyed all his suits. Now he’s fixed and she’s fixed and I can’t wait to see them again, whether in the Avengers or another Iron Man movie… I’m fine with either.\n\n“Things are different now, I have to protect the one thing that I can’t live without. That’s you.”\n\n4. Elizabeth Swann & Will Turner (Keira Knightley & Orlando Bloom) – Pirates of the Caribbean (1, 2 and 3)\n\nEven though she always flirted with Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth’s true love was always Will. She chooses him over her family, becomes a pirate with him, marries him and waits 10 years for him to return while guarding his heart. That’s love!\n\n“It’s always belonged to you. Will you keep it safe?”\n\n3. Juliet & Mark (Keira Knightley & Andrew Lincoln) – Love Actually\n\nI know I’m cheating here, because Juliet was married to Mark’s best friend, and they were never a couple. He was in love with her and she loved his best friend. Still, they have one of my all time favorite on screen moments, when he professes his love for her…\n\n2. Peeta & Katniss (Josh Hutcherson & Jennifer Lawrence) – The Hunger Games\n\nI’m team Peeta all the way! And I’m with Haymitch, when he says that not in a million years Katniss will ever deserve Peeta… Hey, the guy loves her to bits and still, he cares for her boyfriend, stands by his side while he’s hurt and tells her that she’s gotta live for her family and Gale… I absolutely love the moment in this last movie when Katniss thinks Peeta is dead, and in that moment she knows that she can’t live without him…\n\n““No one really needs me,” he says, and there’s no self pity in his voice. It’s true his family doesn’t need him. They will mourn him, as will a handful of friends. But they will get on. Even Haymitch, with the help of a lot of white liquor, will get on. I realize only one person will be damaged beyond repair if Peeta dies. Me.\n\n“I do,” I say. “I need you.” he looks upset, takes a deep breath as if to begin a long argument, and that’s no good, no good at all, because he’ll start going on about Prim and my mother and everything and I’ll just get confused. So before he can talk, i stop his lips with a kiss.”\n\n― Suzanne Collins, Catching Fire\n\n1. Ron Weasley & Hermione Granger (Rupert Grint & Emma Watson) – Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\n\nI don’t care what JK came out saying, that Hermione should have ended up with Harry and stuff, and that Ron and Hermione’s marriage would always be in trouble and so on. It’s no good for me! I think Hermione and Ron are perfect because they are different and they balance each other out! He learns so much from her and she gets out of her comfort zone mostly because of him. If she starts to laugh in the face on danger, is mostly because he was always so cold minded in the most dangerous situations and it rubbed off on her. They are perfect!\n\n““Hang on a moment!” said Ron sharply. “We’ve forgotten someone!”\n\n“Who?” asked Hermione.\n\n“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t they?”\n\n“You mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked Harry.\n\n“No,” said Ron seriously, “I mean, we should tell them to get out. We don’t want any more Dobbies, do we? We can’t order them to die for us -”\n\nThere was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione’s arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet.\n\n“Is this the moment?” Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. “OI! There’s a war going on here!”\n\nRon and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other.\n\n“I know mate,” said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a bludger, “so its now or never, isn’t it?””\n\n– J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\n\nContinuing with the My Top 15 Movie Couples, after the Top 15 of last year, and yesterday’s numbers 15 to 11, here comes the numbers 10 to 6.\n\n10. Julie & R (Teresa Palmer & Nicholas Hoult) – Warm Bodies\n\nR may not talk much, but he’s so cute with Julie and he does whatever he can to change for her, and he does, he manages to regain his humanity and even his ability to talk again. Julie, well, she manages to overcome the whole thing of him being a zombie and eating people’s brains….\n\n“This date is not going well. I want to die all over again.”\n\n9. Tim & Mary (Domhnall Gleeson & Rachel McAdams) – About Time\n\nRachel McAdams has played a time-traveler’s wife before, but this is definitely a romantic and funny approach to the subject. Tim and Mary are funny and sweet, and I don’t know, I just love them so much together.\n\n“Somedays you want to re-live forever”\n\n8. Nymphadora Tonks & Remus Lupin (Natalia Tena & David Thewlis) – Harry Potter series\n\nUnfortunately the movies don’t do enough justice to the whole story between Tonks and Lupin. The books are much more detailed and they gives us the whole picture of the beautiful and sad story between these two adorable wizards.\n\nTonks, a lot younger than Lupin, falls in love with him in HP5. Throughout all of book 6, Harry and company notice that Tonks is sadder and her Patronus has change. In the end of the book it’s clear why this is: she’s in love, with Lupin, but he thinks he’s too dangerous, too poor and too old for her. He eventually comes around, and the two get married sometime between book 6 and 7. She gets pregnant soon after and Lupin, afraid that he has ruined his wife and unborn child’s lifes, runs away, but Harry sets him straight, and he gets back to Tonks in time to see the birth of their Metamorphmagus son, Teddy Lupin. Soon after, however, they are both killed during the battle of Hogwarts…\n\n““You see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. “She still wants to marry him, even though he’s been bitten! She doesn’t care!”\n\n“It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense. “Bill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely-”\n\n“But I don’t care either, I don’t care!” said Tonks, seizing the front of Lupin’s robes and shaking them. “I’ve told you a million times….”\n\nAnd the meaning of Tonk’s Patronus and her mouse-colored hair, and the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Greyback, all suddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.\n\n“And I’ve told you a million times,” said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, “that I am too old for you, too poor….too dangerous….”\n\n“I’ve said all along you’re taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus,” said Mrs. Weasley over Fleur’s shoulder as she patter her on the back.\n\n“I am not being ridiculous,” said Lupin steadily. “Tonks deserves somebody young and whole.”\n\n“But she wants you,” said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile. “And after all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain so.”\n\nHe gestured sadly at his son, lying between them.\n\n“This is….not the moment to discuss it,” said Lupin, avoiding everybody’s eyes as he looked around distractedly. “Dumbledore is dead….”\n\n“Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world,” said Professor McGonagall curtly…”\n\n― J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\n7. Gwen Stacy & Peter Parker (Emma Stone & Andrew Garfield) – The Amazing Spider-Man\n\nOh well, I know this one won’t last long… everyone knows that he’s meant to end up with MJ, but still, Emma and Andrew’s chemistry in this movie is crazy good (probably because, you know, it was happening in real life too… but still…). Can’t wait for the second one =)…\n\n“Don’t make promises you can’t keep, Mr. Parker.”\n\n“Yeah, but those are the best kind.”\n\n6. Tom Hansen & Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel & Joseph Gordon-Levitt) – (500) Days of Summer\n\nIf you watched this movie, you know “This is a boy meets girl story. It is not a love story.“. And indeed, it isn’t! Tom is crazy in love with Summer and thinks she’s his life, but it turns out that she doesn’t feel quite the same way… it’s heartbreaking, but it’s a great movie and they are a happy couple while they last (which is not long, for most of the time he’s in love with her and she is not!). Zooey and Joseph have this crazy chemistry between them… amazing!\n\n“This is a story of boy meets girl. The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he’d never truly be happy until the day he met the one. This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total mis-reading of the movie ‘The Graduate’. The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief. Since the disintegration of her parent’s marriage she’d only love two things. The first was her long dark hair. The second was how easily she could cut it off and not feel a thing. Tom meets Summer on January 8th. He knows almost immediately she is who he has been searching for. This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story.”\n\n»»»»»»»»»» Continue Reading: Numbers 5 to 1 «««««««««««\n\nJust like My Top 20 TV Couples that I did last years, and remade this year in a form of countdown (20 to 16, 15 to 11, 10 to 6 and 5 to 1), I’ll do the same with My Top 15 Movie Couples.\n\n15. Arthur & Molly Weasley ( Mark Williams & Julie Walters) – Harry Potter series\n\nArthur and Molly just perfect. I love them in the movies, but it’s the books that give you the real depth of their amazing connection. They manage to raise 7 really extraordinary children (and one more by proxy), without much, just love and integrity. This is what sets them apart from many other couples. They endured so much and never lost themselves.\n\n“Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was the point in waiting? “\n\n14. The Prime Minister & Natalie ( Hugh Grant & Martine McCutcheon) – Love Actually\n\nTalk about being inappropriate… in Love Actually the Prime Minister of England falls in love with one of the staff members and even cuts the relationship with the US because their president made a move on her… epic! You can’t see this amazing movie without falling in love with them a little.\n\n“God, you weigh a lot!” “Oh, shut your face!!”\n\n13. Anna Scott & William Thacker (Julia Roberts & Hugh Grant) – Notting Hill\n\nThis is a fantasy come true. American actress falls in love with a random, simple, British guy… They had a hard time, with all the paparazzi and stuff, but they managed to pull through.\n\n“I’m also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.”\n\n12. Olive & Todd (Emma Stone & Penn Badgley) – Easy A\n\nThey know each other forever and she’s been in love with him since they were supposed to kiss in a game when they were pre-teens. After the whole school thinks she’s a slut, he never wavers, he believes in her and doesn’t care what everyone’s saying… they’re perfect! (but let me just say that the best about this movie are actually her parents!)\n\n“I might even lose my virginity to him. I don’t know when will it happen. You know, maybe in five minutes, or tonight, or sixth months from now, or maybe on the night of our wedding. But the really amazing this is, it is nobody’s goddamn business.”\n\n11. Charlie & Sam (Logan Lerman & Emma Watson) – The Perks of Being a Wallflower\n\nIf you haven’t seen this movie yet, shame on you! Charlie is a boy in love for the first time, with his best friend. Sam just doesn’t know what’s good for her…\n\n“I know who you are, Sam. I know I’m quiet… and, and I should speak more. But if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time, you’d know what I really meant. How, how much we’re alike and, and how we’ve been through things… and you’re not small. You’re beautiful.”\n\n»»»»»»»»»» Continue Reading: Numbers 10 to 6 «««««««««««\n\n»»»»»»»»»» Continue Reading: Numbers 5 to 1 «««««««««««\n\nBecause today is Valentine’s Day, supposedly the Day of Love, here are my top 5 from my Top 20 TV Couples I’ve been doing for a few days. Top 20 from last year can be found here, Top 20 TV Couples 20-16, 15 to 11 and 10 to 6 here.\n\n5. Mary & John Watson (Amanda Abbington & Martin Freeman) – Sherlock\n\nMary and John are the only couple to make into my Top 5 that have only been together for 1 season, in a show that has now only 3 seasons and 9 episodes. They’re that good! She has a shady future and he thrives on bad situations. They are unique and their love is awesome, why? Because you only forgive your wife from lying to you, shooting your best friend and choose not to learn about her past if you really love her. Mary’s love for John is also quite evident, as she clearly states that there was nothing she wouldn’t do to prevent him from finding out about her past and Sherlock’s shooting. I just love them. I know some people think she’s coming in between Sherlock and Watson, but I never saw them in that way, so I see her as an awesome addition to the party! It must also be noted that Amanda’s onscreen chemistry with her real-life partner, Martin Freeman, is amazing.\n\n“The problems of your past are your business. The problems of your future are my privilege”\n\n4. Piper & Leo (Holly Marie Combs & Brian Krause) – Charmed\n\nAfter all these years, Piper and Leo are still in my Top 5 TV Couples! One of the best couples ever! It took them all show to finally be happy and live their lives as they wanted them, but they did it. They went through fighting the Elders, the Demons, the Avatars, and so many other things, but they managed to end up together, grow old together, in a house full of children and grandchildren. Good for them!\n\n“Piper, through all the tears and struggles, I always knew in my heart that we’d make it here. I promise to love and respect you from this point forward as your husband, as my wife, my lover, my friend, and my soul mate. All I am is yours.”\n\n“Leo, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I was afraid that you were too good to be true, that maybe I didn’t deserve someone so pure and beautiful and loving as you are. But here we are surrounded by the people that I love the most and I feel so proud, and so blessed to be your wife. Leo, I was born to love you and I always will.”\n\n3. Chloe & Oliver (Allison Mack & Justin Hartley) – Smallville\n\nI have to admit that I haven’t started watching Arrow yet, because I don’t want to let go of this image of Ollie, and I don’t want to let go of Oliver with Chloe. I loved their story, it was unexpected, romantic and the poor guys suffered a big deal. But, because it’s fiction, they got over everything, got married, moved to Star City and even had a baby boy!\n\n“Oliver… I never thought I’d have to tell you how I feel about us, because the smile on my lips when I looked at you… pretty much said it all. But now that you won’t be seeing it anymore, I’ll have to use words to tell you. I’ve never loved anyone the way I’ve loved you. And I never will again. You will always be my brightest star, my knight in shining leather, my hero.”\n\n“It’s the best decision, I don’t remember making.”\n\n2. Monica & Chandler (Courteney Cox & Matthew Perry) – Friends\n\nThey just lost nº 1 because of Pam and Jim, but they are still very much one of my all time favorite couples. They are another couple that proves that friendship is the base of everything. Chandler is the only man on TV to have successfully escape the “Friend Zone” – note that Jim and Pam were never of the “Friend zone” because they always loved each other. They never broke up when things got hard; he faced his fear of commitment; they dealt with being in a secret relationship, coming out, finding out they weren’t able to conceive and went through an adoption process, … They’re the best!\n\n“My wife’s an incredible woman. She’s loving and devoted and caring. And don’t tell her I said this but the woman’s always right… I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I… It kills me that I can’t give her a baby… I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I’ll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife… she’s already there. She’s a mother… without a baby…”\n\n1. Pam & Jim (Jenna Fischer & John Krasinski) – The Office\n\nHave you ever seen The Office?! If you have, you understand: Pam and Jim are the best couple in TV… ever! Jim waited forever for her, while she’s was engaged to some other guy and he won her (in truth, she already loved him too, but was too scared to admit it). They eventually star dating, survive a long distance relationship, got engaged, got pregnant, got married and even managed to get through that terrible last season, where Jim’s job drove them apart. He gave up his dream job, because she was more important, and in the end, she gives up everything because he deserves it all! They are amazing and The Office is totally worth watching, even just for them.\n\nSmall things, like the way they smiled at each other, the way she used to put her head on his shoulders…\n\n… that epic proposal in the rain,…\n\nTheir reaction to finding out that Pam was pregnant, how much they knew each other,…\n\n… and then there’s this…\n\n… and this (and I could be here posting pictures of them all day, but I wont).\n\nAnd this is way they’re my number 1!!!\n\n“Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl, who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do, which was just to.. wait. Don’t get me wrong, I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of friends and family, that I do know how to make a photocopy. Didn’t need your help that many times. And, uh, do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive stick? I’ve been driving stick since high school, so… For a really long time that’s all I had. Little moments with a girl who saw me as a friend. And, a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl I work with but I think, even then I knew that… I was waiting for my wife.”"
