        "text": "Although the study of film was already well established, Star Studies did not become the focus of serious, sustained academic research until the 1970s thanks to the seminal work of Richard Dyer, in which it was firmly established that film stars contribute fundamentally to the creation of meaning in a film text. It is for this reason that Star Studies has had a comparatively shorter, although not less productive, history than other areas of research within Film Studies. This paper will therefore be discussing the role, significance and value of Hollywood film stars within both our present society and the contemporary Hollywood film industry. However, in order to fully appreciate the current state of the institution of Hollywood stardom, it will also be necessary to briefly discuss its foundations and development, as well as the various ways in which stardom has routinely been analysed within the academic field of Film Studies. In order to illustrate my theoretical arguments, I will ...\n\nFocusing on The Expendables films, I identify the importance of discourses of professional and cultural redundancy in &#39;geri-action&#39;, an emergent subgenre of Hollywood action film that has revitalised the careers of ageing action stars such as Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. These redundancies, which hold long-standing significance in 1980s action film, are compounded in geri-action by advanced age and diminished physical capacity. In geri-action, the spectacle of once idealised, muscled bodies is concealed and displaced onto oversized guns, fetishised vehicles and younger action bodies. However much geri-action resists 1980s action stars&#39; use-by dates, it ultimately admits physical and generic exhaustion.\n\n| The paper examines the social identity of individuals in the top tiers of Hollywood stardom alongside historical and cultural factors that have created a naturalized connection between whiteness and American movie stardom. The discussion considers the cultural implications of actors' physiognomies, stars' function as commercial assets, and Hollywood norms that ree ect the perspective of dominant social groups. It proposes that research on the cultural signii cance of performers who represent the heterogeneity of American society , together with work that foregrounds the conventional whiteness of movie stardom, will generate a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of lm performers' cultural appeal.\n\nCynthia Rothrock is a martial arts performance legend of the 1980s who began acting in Hong Kong cinema in the late 1980s and became a transnational video star in the 1990s. At the height of her fame she was mobbed by fans from Germany to Indonesia and she made a stadium erupt in the USA, where her thirty-odd films were not shown in cinemas; the subject of hundreds of media articles worldwide, she has been the object of adoring fan web-sites and ‘shrines’, and features today in lovingly curated YouTube galleries of her best fight scenes. Yet in academic studies her work in Hong Kong is praised but rarely discussed, while her career is often framed as one of failure to become a ‘real’ star—that is, to get a big screen role in Hollywood. This article explores some of the reasons for the difficulty we have in accounting for an American performer's contribution to Asian popular culture, asking how critical questions might be reframed to take better account of Rothrock's Asian work.\n\nFollowing a growing public discussion on violence against women in India, some commentators have turned their eye upon Bollywood. The film industry’s role in perpetuating models of courtship based on the stalking and harassment of women has drawn criticism from several quarters. While there has been much said about the depiction of women in Bollywood film, there has been relatively less said on portrayals of masculinity. The research that does exist focuses on textual analyses of films, or looks at masculinity through the lens of global capital flows. This thesis instead, analyzes trailers, posters, promotional pictures and social media for the film Raees (dir. Rahul Dholakia), to examine the construction of masculinity in Bollywood film promotional material. Promotional content tends to recreate masculine tropes that were found to be prevalent in textual analyses of Bollywood films. All promotional formats continued to reiterate male dominance, stereotyped Muslim men as violent and..."
