        "text": "I once knew Eliza Doolittle like a best friend. I played her in a school production of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion and loved every minute of the metamorphosis from Covent Garden flower girl in a dented black straw hat to fine lady, zipped into my mother's velvet ballgown trimmed with gold. But I was also aware that there was something I could not get the hang of about Eliza, something troubling beneath the surface of her story. For this is not - and never has been - a regular fairytale.\n\nOn 15 March, at the National Theatre, Trevor Nunn's production of My Fair Lady, Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's 1956 musical based on Pygmalion, opens with Martine McCutcheon as Eliza. McCutcheon, star of EastEnders and Top of the Pops (she reached number one with 'Perfect Moment'), will be the first Eliza who, as Trevor Nunn delicately puts it, 'will have no trouble with authentic London street speech'.\n\nThis is canny casting, to put it mildly, and McCutcheon, born and bred in Clapton, will be supported by Jonathan Pryce as Higgins and Nicholas le Prevost as Pickering. The choreography will be by Matthew Bourne of Adventures in Moving Pictures and the design by Anthony Ward. Hopes for the show could not be higher and McCutcheon may well prove the most authentic Eliza yet. It is not only that, like Eliza, she will have to learn to speak proper, but her own life resembles Eliza's in some ways. McCutcheon suffered from a drunken, violent father but did not let this stop her single-minded rise to stardom. And unlike Audrey Hepburn, who had to be dubbed by Marni Nixon in the film of My Fair Lady, McCutcheon can sing.\n\nThe Cockney noise Eliza goes in for is tricky. There is much squawking and groaning: 'Ah-ah-ah-ow-ow-oo!' I preferred the moment of enunciating in a posh accent: 'Not bloody likely' in the luxurious certainty that it would always get a laugh. What I did not know was that it was this line that, in April 1914, at once scandalised audiences and sealed the play's success. George Bernard Shaw described the reaction to Eliza's words on the first night: 'They laughed themselves into such utter abandonment and disorder... that it was really doubtful for some time whether they could recover themselves and let the play go on.'\n\nJust under a century later, Eliza Doolittle has lost the power to shock. She has also lost the power to teach. Shaw boasted that his play was didactic. He was a Fabian and a socialist and believed he had pulled off an illuminating practical joke in which elocution is the key to social advancement. Michael Holroyd, in his superb biography of Shaw, describes Pygmalion as 'an integration of Faustian legend and Cinderella fairytale, a comedy of manners and a parable of socialism'. Nunn extends this: 'Shaw gives the lie to the way our society is organised and to all its assumptions. He has aristocrats admiring a girl they would revile if they knew who she was'. But the idea that accent is a key to success is, happily, no longer as persuasive.\n\nSo why hasn't Eliza herself dated? Why does she still captivate us? It is partly that My Fair Lady is the ultimate makeover story. Nunn suggests it is because 'she is absolutely archetypal. We respond to every form of the story of rags to riches'. He cites Jamie Bell/Billy Elliot as the latest example of this.\n\nEliza Doolittle is 97. She has undergone many changes in just under a century. She has been the star of Pygmalion the play, Pygmalion the film (1938) and the star of My Fair Lady on stage (1956) and screen (1964). Nunn describes Alan Jay Lerner's work as a 'brilliantly thoughtful interpretation. He edits and focuses, he does not create new situations'. But Eliza's feisty character stays the same. It is only about the ending - of which more later - that Eliza's admirers disagree.\n\nNowadays, I find myself as much discomforted as amused by Higgins's merry misogyny... worst of all, I suspect Shaw of being on Higgins's side to a disagreeable degree. I fear he enjoys the shaming aspect of the experiment (how to turn cabbage leaf into cabbage rose), but at least he had the grace to give Eliza the temperament (as opposed to a fully realised character) with which to win her audience's heart.\n\nTrevor Nunn concedes that Eliza is more temperament than character. Her 'volatility' is the key: 'We meet her in an angry mood. Many girls in her situation [when her basket is knocked over] would say sorry, pick up their flowers and creep away.' She wants to be paid. Eliza takes a raucous pride in being herself. She knows more about manners than Higgins could ever guess and her temperament, says Nunn, is 'going to be useful to her as an independent woman'.\n\nEliza has been hailed as a feminist heroine, a first cousin to Nora in Ibsen's The Doll's House. Diana Rigg played her this way in the 1974 production directed by John Dexter. And Liz Robertson, who played the role in My Fair Lady opposite Tony Britton in the late Seventies, still champions Eliza for her 'courage, her fierce ambition to better herself. The suffragettes would have admired her'.\n\nFrances Barber, who played Eliza in Howard Davies' 1992 production of Pygmalion at the National, agrees. She would only complain that the famous slipper scene (when Eliza, mortified that Higgins has failed to praise her for her triumph, hurls his slippers at him) does not go far enough. It is a scene, incidentally, that Holroyd regards as 'sadomasochistic'. Barber says: 'I felt the slipper was a pathetic missile. It should have been an armchair. I could have murdered him.' But she adds her Eliza would have hoped to have 'made love with him later'.\n\nThe first Eliza Doolittle was in her late forties. Mrs Patrick Campbell (known to her friends as Stella) was a dark-eyed beauty but more flower dame than girl. It was sometimes thought that she was more remarkable for her stage presence than for her acting talent. The production was staged by actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Shaw had written the part with Mrs Campbell in mind although Eliza's character is partly based on his mother.\n\nShaw was years older than Stella and punishingly 'violently and exquisitely' in love with her, as he confessed in a letter to Granville Barker. Michael Holroyd tells me she was 'the only woman he was sexually attracted to'. She made him suffer so much that at one point he wrote: 'The quantity of love that an ordinary person can stand without serious damage... is about 10 minutes in 50 years.'\n\nShaw was not certain that she would condescend to play such a vulgar role but when she overheard Shaw reading her part (he read aloud well), she was flattered and wrote to thank him for 'thinking I can be your pretty little slut'. Later, she promised: 'I'll be as tame as a mouse and oh so obedient - and I wonder if you'll get what you want out of me... ' Anything less like an obedient mouse could scarcely be imagined than her Eliza. She was said by Shaw to have 'ravished the house almost to delirium'.\n\nJulie Andrews was the first Eliza in the Broadway production of My Fair Lady, directed by Moss Hart, and with exquisite costumes by Cecil Beaton was every bit as successful as Mrs Campbell and broke box-office records in a role that she sang for three-and-a-half years in 2,717 performances. Paul Newman saw her Eliza and described her as 'one of the last really great broads'.\n\nBut in 1962, Jack Warner, against all expectations, decided not to cast Andrews in the film role and Audrey Hepburn, who could not sing, got the part instead. Andrews has since confessed in interviews to a retrospective sorrow, while always insisting that she and Hepburn became the best of friends. Hepburn once said to Andrews: 'I felt you should have done it but I didn't have the guts to turn it down.' Andrews's understandably starchy response to this was: 'It was a wonderful role. Why would anyone turn it down?'\n\nThe film cost $17 million and was directed by George Cukor. It was the most expensive movie Warner had made. Hepburn looked sweet as any violet but her Cockney accent was endearingly abysmal ('mud' is pronounced 'mad').\n\nNunn argues that one of the strengths of My Fair Lady is that, unlike Pygmalion, it explores the struggle to speak. We watch Eliza with her mouth full of marbles or speaking into a tube - this looks like a delicate form of torture. Higgins is not only teaching Eliza to speak, but he is schooling her in silences, and Hepburn supplies these divinely where required. But she can also be a wildcat. After she has ejected herself from Higgins' s house, she looks like an aggressive peach.\n\nThe contested question about Eliza Doolittle is the one she asks herself: what is to become of her in the end? In the play, she leaves Higgins. This is the hard, realistic ending. Shaw, stubborn as a rock, resisted the tidal wave of wishes (from audience and actors like) that Eliza and Higgins should come together. He ignored the truth that there is nothing sexier than overcoming apparently impossible obstacles in love.\n\nIn a vexing epilogue to Pygmalion, he marries Eliza off to her vacuous admirer, Freddie. Frances Barber is with Shaw all the way. She says it 'hurt' to watch the film and see Eliza compromise herself and stay with Higgins. But Liz Robertson, who was the eighth and final wife of Alan Jay Lerner, rejoices in the ending. She admits, however, that when Lerner had Eliza poignantly returning to Higgins and repeating her line from the beginning - 'I washed my face and hands afore I come, I did' - he had difficulty getting it past Shaw's estate and there was 'a huge fight'.\n\nShaw's resistance to the romantic ending must partly have reflected his grief over Stella, his firm intention to put real life, with its compromises and disappointment, before fairy tale. Robertson comments: 'Shaw was a very weird man, never able to commit himself physically. But it was absolutely wrong to suggest that Eliza would marry Freddie. Freddie is such an oaf. It defies her character.'\n\nNunn is confident that Shaw would not have disapproved of the popular ending of My Fair Lady had he lived to see it. Michael Holroyd disagrees. The romantic ending of the film Pygmalion, directed by Gabriel Pascal, was written behind Shaw's back by another scriptwriter. But Nunn retaliates by saying: 'Shaw accepted an Oscar for the screenplay.' Would he have done this if he had disapproved? I ask Holroyd why Shaw held out against the ending that, however much we admire the integrity of Pygmalion, we all secretly desire? He does not hesitate. He says the romantic ending was the 'subtext' to play. 'It was what Shaw suppressed in himself.'"
