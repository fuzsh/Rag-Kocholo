        "text": "After playing the forlorn Jamie, Firth went on to win an Academy Award for his performance as King George VI in The King's Speech. He also was in Nanny McPhee, playing Thomas Brodie-Sangster's dad and Emma Thompson's boss. Firth has a range of roles under in his belt, from suave secret agent in Kingsman: The Secret Service to uptight, singing banker in Mamma Mia!.\n\nAfter playing the loving mother of two, the Oscar-winning actress appeared in pretty much everything from Harry Potter to Men in Black III to Bridget Jones's Baby (with fellow Love Actually star Hugh Grant). The year Love Actually was released, Thompson married English actor Greg Wise (who was one of her co-stars in Sense and Sensibility), with whom she has two children. The acclaimed British actress will be the voice of Mrs. Potts in the much anticipated Disney live-action Beauty and the Beast movie, with fellow Harry Potter star Emma Watson.\n\nRickman continued to play the bittersweet role of Professor Severus Snape in the Harry Potter film series after working on Love Actually. In 2007, the Golden Globe–winning actor worked with Johnny Depp and fellow Harry Potter star Helena Bonham Carter in the movie adaptation of Sweeney Todd. The much-loved actor passed away in January 2016, not long after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.\n\nAfter playing the best man secretly in love with his best friend's wife, Lincoln got his own happy ending when he married Gael Anderson in 2006 and had two children, Arthur and Matilda. He continued working in film and television and now he's best known as the protagonist, Rick Grimes, in AMC's enormously popular The Walking Dead.\n\nThe same year as Love Actually, Atkinson played the none-too-smooth spy in action spoof Johnny English. He continued as his best known character, Mr. Bean, in movies like Mr. Bean's Wedding and Mr. Bean's Holiday. In 2013, Atkinson played the title character, St. John Quartermaine, in a London production of Quartermaine's Terms. Fun fact: the English comedian attended Duchess Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding (we're jealous)!\n\nBrazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro, who played Sarah's gorgeous coworker Karl, has since taken on roles in movies like Ancient Greek epic 300 and its sequel, animated flick Rio, Focus, and The 33. This year, the heartthrob plays a wanted bandit, Hector Escaton, in the HBO drama Westworld, which also stars Thandie Newton and Evan Rachel Wood.\n\nAfter playing the sweet \"Just\" Judy, Page voiced a few animated children's TV series, like Poppy Cat and Q Pottle 5. She also played the royal part of Queen Elizabeth I in an episode of Doctor Who. Since the Christmas rom-com, she has had two children with her husband James Thornton, and announced earlier this year that they are expecting their third child together.\n\nThe year after she played one of Colin's American fans in Love Actually, Cuthbert starred as a former porn star in teen comedy Girl Next Door. She also starred in the 2005 remake of House of Wax, alongside Paris Hilton and Chad Michael Murray. The former foot model was in multiple television shows including 24, cult comedy Happy Endings, One Big Happy, and, most recently, Netflix Original The Ranch. The Canadian actress married her boyfriend of five years, Dion Phaneuf, in 2013.\n\nAfter Love Actually, Elizabeth went on to play Kelso's baby mama in That '70s Show. In 2012, the Texas native reprised her American Pie role, Nadia, in American Reunion. Besides acting, Elizabeth—an animal rights activist—became the 2012 spokesperson for Farm Sanctuary's Adopt a Turkey Project, which encourages people to 'adopt' a turkey at Thanksgiving. Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, and Alec Baldwin have also been associated with the project.\n\nAfter falling for Colin's English accent in Love Actually, Milicevic appeared in films like romantic comedy What's Your Number? and Aloha. She also graced the small screen in Pushing Daisies, Ugly Betty, Charmed, and Banshee. Most recently, we've seen her as the tough Maria on Fox's Gotham.\n\nRichards went on to appear in multiple TV series, including Jane the Virgin, Twisted, 30 Rock, and Two and a Half Men (before and after her ex-husband Charlie Sheen's exit from the series). The former Bond girl had two daughters, and later adopted a baby girl, Eloise Joni, in 2011.\n\nLinney has appeared in many acclaimed films, most recently featuring with Tom Hanks in Sully, and the Golden Globe–nominated Nocturnal Animals with Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal. Unlike her Love Actually character, the Oscar-nominated actress said yes to the guy IRL—her husband Marc Schauer—and gave birth to her first child in 2014.\n\nNighy is nothing like his washed-up character Billy, having appeared in everything from zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. As fearsome villain Davy Jones in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, he reunited with Love Actually co-star Keira Knightley. He also took the part of Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.\n\nAfter playing Aurelia, Moniz continued to appear in Portuguese television shows and movies. You might not know that Moniz is also a singer; she continued with her music career, releasing two more albums after her international acting debut in Love Actually. She gave birth to daughter Júlia in 2004\n\nAfter being in the middle of a love triangle between best friends Peter and Mark, Knightley went on to leading roles in Atonement, Anna Karenina, and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. In 2013, she married James Righton, and gave birth to daughter, Edie, two years later. Knightley plays Love in the 2016 film Collateral Beauty, alongside fellow A-listers Will Smith, Helen Mirren, and Kate Winslet.\n\nAfter playing POTUS in Love Actually, Thornton showed his not-so-festive side in Bad Santa. We received another dose of Thornton's holiday drama when Bad Santa 2 came out in 2016—13 years after the original. Thornton has also played villain Lorne Malvo in cult TV hit Fargo and recently had a role in David E. Kelley's legal drama Goliath.\n\nEjiofor acted in a number of films, like CIA thriller Salt and American Gangster, after playing the unsuspecting Peter. He also rocked sparkling footwear as drag queen Lola in 2005's movie adaptation of Kinky Boots. The Londoner's most notable role was as Solomon Northup in 12 Years a Slave, a performance that was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award.\n\nHaving made Daniel's dream of dating a Claudia Schiffer lookalike come true, Schiffer herself retired from the acting business and hasn't taken a role since. The supermodel was named the face of Chanel and Accessorize, while continuing her work as a UNICEF UK Ambassador. Most recently, she launched Claudia Schiffer Knitwear, her own line of cashmere clothing. Schiffer also added daughter Clementine to her family in 2004.\n\nAfter playing Harry's seductive secretary, the German actress worked on several German films. She also played Liesel's mother in novel-turned-film The Book Thief. Makatsch went onto marry boyfriend Max Martin Schroder and have two daughters.\n\nAfter ruling the roost as Love Actually's prime minister, Grant reprised his role as Colin Firth's romantic rival in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. In the mid aughts, the British actor harmonized in movies like American Dreamz and Music and Lyrics. This year, Grant scored a Golden Globe nomination for Florence Foster Jenkins. Grant has also become a father four times over, having welcomed two sons and two daughters into the world."
