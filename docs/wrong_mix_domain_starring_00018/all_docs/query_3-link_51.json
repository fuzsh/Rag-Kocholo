        "text": "The Mad Max cameo in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is so brief and seemingly insubstantial that it can barely be considered a cameo. It’s merely a cutaway to a wide shot of Max (played by Jacob Tomuri, Tom Hardy’s stunt double from Mad Max: Fury Road), his face not particularly visible, leaning against his V8 Interceptor, eating a can of food and casually staring out over a cliff into the emptiness below — a classic Mad Max stance, recalling the opening of Fury Road (although it’s taking place many years before that movie). Beneath him, way in the distance, we can see Furiosa slowly limping her way across the desert toward the Citadel.\n\nIt seems like a throwaway scene — a little Easter egg for fans — but there might be a bit more to it. Right now, Furiosa is at her lowest point: She’s been wounded and beaten; her partner and lover, Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke), has been brutally dragged to death; she’s escaped the clutches of Dementus by basically tearing off (or possibly chewing off) her own grotesquely wounded arm, which was chained to a truck.\n\nSo Max is casually watching this helpless young woman, her arm amputated, limping across the desert. (The vehicle Furiosa used to escape has also given out by this point.) Before the film cuts away from him, he stands a bit more alertly but makes no effort to help her. This is the Wasteland, after all, where it’s every man or woman for himself; Max isn’t about to risk his life or waste his fuel helping someone who seems not long for this world.\n\nBut then the film fades out. When it fades back in, we briefly see Furiosa, unconscious, being dragged by an unseen figure. Then it fades back out again. When it fades back in, she’s in a subterranean cave in the Citadel, where her arm is covered in maggots. Severed limbs hang all over the place. We’d caught a brief glimpse of this place before, suggesting that more than a little cannibalism goes on in the Citadel.\n\nHow did she get there? Who was the unseen figure that was dragging Furiosa? The way Miller fades in and out of this scene from when Max takes particular notice of Furiosa suggests that Max might have been the one to drag her to semi-safety, at least up closer to the Citadel. (Max would presumably know that the Citadel is not a place he wants to be caught anywhere near.)"
