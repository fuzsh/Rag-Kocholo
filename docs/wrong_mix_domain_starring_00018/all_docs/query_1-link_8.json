        "text": "Over to Sky Moviemax – just how many different brands have Sky used on their movie channels over the years?\n\nToday’s movie is Space Truckers. I’m going to say this one is fairly obscure, as it doesn’t show up on any online digital platform, streaming or otherwise. I think I watched this at the time, but I don’t have a strong memory of it.\n\nIt’s a low budget SF movie directed by Stuart Gordon, who is famous for directing Re-Animator, a genuine horror classic. You can tell this is low budget from the opening scene. A lot of people are in a large control centre, preparing to defend it from an unknown threat. It’s a large space, with lots of people, but the giveaway to the low budget is the black background. Rather than build large set pieces to show the scale of the place, or use a matte painting to give scale, they just keep the background black. It still reads as large, but it’s a bit of a sign that this isn’t the highest budget movie you’re going to see.\n\nThe one large set piece in the scene is a huge armoured door. They spend screen time watching it slowly close, and security bolts locking it. Every time I see a door like this in a film, I think of Jeff Bridges in Tron breaking in to ENCOM through a similarly oversized vault door, and his line “Now that is a big door.” It’s weird how the oddest little lines stick with you over the years.\n\nAnother budget giveaway is that a lot of the attack plays out on video monitors, and we see pilots reacting to something, but nothing outside of that point of view. It’s something Star Trek shows used to do a lot.\n\nThe attacker is a robot. It’s fairly unstoppable, killing a lot of the defenders, until it’s shut down, and this is revealed to have been a test run of their robot technology.\n\nThe man in charge is EJ Saggs, played by Shane Rimmer, one of those familiar faces (and voices, being the voice of Scott Tracy in Thunderbirds) who is always turning up when they want an American actor in a UK production. Sure enough, this film was shot in Ireland.\n\nSaggs’ right hand man, and the brains behind the robot technology, is none other than Charles Dance as Nabel, another indicator this wasn’t shot in the US. he doesn’t last long, though, as Saggs needs the robots to remain secret, so he has it kill Nabel.\n\nCut to titles, and the reason for the film being shot in Ireland becomes clear – this was a Goldcrest production. They were the great hope of the British Film Industry in the 80s.\n\nDennis Hopper is one of the eponymous Space Truckers, John Canyon, towing a freight rig filled with oblong pigs.\n\nHe’s late, and Keller, the man who’s receiving the freight, doesn’t want to pay him the full fee. He’s played by George Wendt.\n\nI’ve been a sniffy about the budget, but I’ll be honest, they’re trying really hard. This is the truckers’ bar on a space station, it’s built as a circular structure, like the rotating command deck in 2001. They can’t quite stretch to a wide shot of the whole thing, but they’ve built the partial set with a curve to sell the idea.\n\nTalking of space stations, the miniature work in this is pretty good. This reminds me of the space station in Wrath of Khan – this could almost be the same model with a ton of stuff stuck on.\n\nAt the bar, Canyon meets up with Cindy, played by Debi Mazar, who we saw recently in Murder One. He’s obviously fancied her for ages. She’s a waitress at the bar, so obviously she’s nice to him. He seems to interpret this as mutual attraction.\n\nSlightly more age-appropriate is another young trucker Mike Pucci (Stephen Dorff). He’s offered the contract to take the square pigs, thus pitting him against Canyon, by Keller.\n\nKeller comes to the bar, faces off against Canyon, and there’s a good old fashioned bar fight, during which one of Keller’s men shoots out a window – how are people even allowed guns somewhere like that? As soon as that happened I knew where this was going, and sure enough, Keller gets sucked through the decompressing window. Someone’s seen Goldfinger. (Brief shoutout to the little jukebox you can see – the same kind they had at Ed’s Diner, which was one of my favourite places to eat in London, before they all closed down.)\n\nEscaping the authorities, Canyon, Mike and Cindy make their way to Mr Zesty, a mysterious figure who has an underground lair only reachable through a secret lift in the toilets. He offers them a haulage deal taking a consignment of ‘sex toys’ to Earth. It’s all very hush-hush. though and they must get there on time.\n\nThey take the job, escape pursuit from some police cruisers, and have a close encounter with dark asteroids. The ship is damaged, its coolant system is down, and without a repair, they’ll burn up in a couple of hours. I’m not sure if that’s a common problem in deep space where too much heat is rarely an issue. So Canyon goes out to cut the load loose, which Mike and Cindy have a heart to heart. And because it’s getting hot, they both take most of their clothes off. I know this is basically an exploitation film, but come on. Especially because as soon as Cindy takes her top off, Mike starts staring and the sexy saxophone music starts playing on the soundtrack. He can’t even look her in the eye.\n\nThe repair doesn’t work, so the three of them seem resigned to burning up in the ship. But hidden in the asteroids is a huge ship which takes Canyon’s ship on board. As I said before, I’m quite enjoying the miniature work.\n\nIt’s not a rescue, though, as is obvious when the three of them are greeted by Vernon Wells (yes, him off of Commando) with a big gun.\n\nThey’re taken onto the big ship, and in case it wasn’t obvious these are supposed to be pirates, their leader arrives, and the first we see of him is his mechanical peg leg.\n\nThe big bad is none other than Nabel, Charles Dance from the opening, who we saw shot by his own killer robot. He clearly got better, although he’s “more machine now than man, twisted and evil” as Obi Wan Kenobi might have said. He’s now going by the name Macanudo, but Mecha Charles Dance works just as well.\n\nClearly, having to rebuild most of his body has not improved his personality, so he immediately grabs Cindy and intends to have sex with her. She agrees, to keep her friends safe, but let’s not pretend it’s anything but rape. However, the film manages to undercut the repulsive aspects by making it a joke about Mecha Charles Dance having to use a pull-cord to start up his member, and having performance issues.\n\nCindy isn’t putting up with his rapey nonsense, and rips out a few fluid pipes, leaving him helpless on the floor.\n\nShe takes his uniform, and goes to try to free the other two. I really like Cindy in this. She’s no victim.\n\nMecha Charles Dance pulls himself together before they can get away, but Canyon points out that the cargo they’re pulling has extremely heavy defenses, which seems odd for sex toys, so he opens up one of the cargo pods, and discovers it’s full of the robots he built for EJ Saggs, heading to Earth to help Saggs take Earth over. One of them wakes up, and kills most of the pirates.\n\nWhile the pirates are being killed by the robot, Canyon opens the cargo doors on the pirate ship, and the three of them make it back to his ship and fly out before the pirate ship explodes. But they hear some sounds coming from the rear of the ship, and when they investigate they find Mecha Charles Dance (or what’s left of him). He explains about the killer robots, and suggests they find a way to kill them all before they get to Earth. He gives them his remote control, which can turn them off, before he dies. “For a son-of-a-bitch gimp rapist murderer, he died OK.”\n\nIt doesn’t take long before more robots are waking up. There’s a plan to blow the clamps holding the cargo to the ship, so Canyon does that, and sends Mike and Cindy to the escape pod. It doesn’t quite go as planned for Canyon, though, and he’s still on the truck as it enters the atmosphere, so cue some re-entry heat.\n\nCindy and Mike manage to land in one piece.\n\nBut as they watch Canyon’s ship coming in, it explodes.\n\nSomehow, Canyon managed to get off his ship, though, and lands with a parachute.\n\nLater, they are visiting the hospital to see Cindy’s mum, who is recovering from a very nasty disease. And Canyon is rather confused to see that Cindy’s mother doesn’t look an awful lot older than Cindy, because she’s been frozen for 20 years until they could cure the disease she had. She’s played by Barbara Crampton, a regular in Stuart Gordon’s films.\n\nThen they get a visit from the President – not the one they expected, but evil EJ Saggs from the beginning, who has negotiated a corporate takeover of the World government, so he didn’t need the killer robots. He tells Canyon that he’s got a brand new ship waiting for him, and he gives them a suitcase full of cash, in return for them keeping quiet about his attempted violent invasion of Earth. Looks like everyone’s happy.\n\nBut Mike isn’t as pragmatic as Canyon, and he can’t take the blood money that’s been offered. Things get heated, and Mike grabs the case of cash and throws it out of the window, and it falls towards the President’s limo – just as Saggs is activating the bomb he’d hidden inside it. “Somebody fragged Saggs.” “You know, I think it was us.”\n\nAnd the film ends with all four of them lifting of in Canyon’s new ship, bound for new adventures.\n\nI have to say, I really enjoyed that. It was definitely cheap, but every penny was on screen, and while it skated close to some nasty moments, it always managed to swerve before it got genuinely offensive. And who wouldn’t enjoy Mecha Charles Dance?\n\nAfter this, there’s some ads and previews, then the tape ends.\n\nAdverts:\n\nSpecsavers\n\nFord\n\nSky Digital\n\ntrail: The Devil’s Advocate\n\ntrail: Lost in Space\n\ntrail: The Minus Man\n\nRolling Rock\n\nColgate Total\n\nActimel\n\nRenault Clio\n\nBT – ET\n\nNivea Visage\n\nRohto ZI For Eyes\n\nAustin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me in cinemas\n\nHaagen Dazs\n\nSchwarzkopf Country Colors\n\nMalibu\n\ntrail: A Bit of Posh\n\ntrail: Millennium Movies – LA Confidential\n\ntrail: Paradise Road\n\ntrail: Hollywood Buzz\n\ntrail: The Borrowers\n\nPreview: Entrapment\n\ntrail: Tuesday Night on Sky\n\ntrail: Dark City\n\nHooch\n\nDaewoo\n\nHP Sauce\n\nLea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce\n\nFriends on video\n\nOlay Daily Renewal\n\nRohto ZI For Eyes\n\nKodak Gold Ultra\n\nColgate Total\n\nRolling Rock\n\nHaagen Dazs\n\nAustin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me in cinemas\n\nFirst on this tape, from BBC Two, Hollywood’s Master of Myth, a documentary about Joseph Cambell, whose Hero with a Thousand Faces led to the modern understand of the Hero’s Journey, which George Lucas famously used to shape the story of Star Wars.\n\nChris Vogler thinks Star Wars is like a modern religion.\n\nLucas himself talks about his friendship with Campbell.\n\nAlso interviewed is George Miller, of Mad Max fame.\n\nInevitably, Robert McKee turns up, having made his career saying many of the same things Campbell does. It amuses me that three of McKee’s credits as as Story Consultant on three of the Barbie CGI movies.\n\nCampbell himself appears from archive interviews.\n\nA student of his, Katherine Bidwell, talks about him.\n\nThere’s a notification that the Golf has made everything run late…\n\nRichard Adams admits that he wouldn’t have written Watership Down if he hadn’t read Campbell’s work.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 18th July 1999 – 23:10\n\nAfter this, we depart for Sky One, for a few episodes of Crusade, the followup series to Babylon 5. These episodes come from the middle of the season – there was only one season. late 90s TV CGI is as accurate as carbon dating.\n\nIn Appearances and Other Deceits, the Excalibur is on a mission to find a cure for a plague before it wipes out all life on Earth. Well that’s not too close to home, is it? The captain is Matthew Gideon, played by Gary Cole.\n\nThis episode brings the crew up against the most fearsome threat they’ve ever faced: Image consultants from Earth, there to make sure their mission is presented with the right colour scheme and interior decor. I’m rather hoping this episode ends with Gideon and co being ushered in to the newly designed bridge with their eyes closed, and then open them and have to pretend they’re not disappointed.\n\nOne of them, Mr Welles, is played by John Vickery, and the character also appeared in Babylon 5. But Vickery is slightly more familiar as the Minbari Neroon from the original show. The advantage of playing an alien character is you can play a different character as well.\n\nThe Excalibur discovers an abandoned space station, with one inhabitant left alive. They bring it on board, it’s seemingly alive and healthy, then its body shuts down, but it puts a glowy hand on the doctor treating it, so you can bet some kind of mental transference has happened.\n\nPretty soon the glowy hands are being passed around the ship like pictures of Bernie Sanders wearing mittens.\n\nMax Eilerson is translating the alien ship’s log, and discovers what’s happening, just as the possessed members of the crew find him, and he escapes to safety. Now it’s a standoff between the Earth crew and the possessed.\n\nLt Matheson (Daniel Dae Kim) isn’t happy to have the Changing Rooms guy hang around while he’s working.\n\nAfter dealing with the alien threat, Welles and co leave the crew with a new design of uniform. Was this a result of studio notes? “I look like a bellhop” is Gideon’s verdict.”\n\nThe next episode is Racing the Night. We get a flashback to a meeting at the start of the mission, where Gideon agrees that, if a cure isn’t found within four years, he will prevent anyone from Earth leaving the planet to spread the plague. Even Boris didn’t wait four whole years to close the airports.\n\nThen, he’s flying around the dead cities of an abandoned planet on a really cool flying motorbike.\n\nThere’s a conversation with Eilerson where he espouses the virtues of pure Capitalism. He seemed like a dick from the previous episode, but this just confirms it.\n\nThe planet was supposed to be uninhabited, but a crewmember is attacked and eviscerated, and a lot of ships appear. Gideon leads them away from the team, and is rescued by Galen the Technomage, who also seems to be a bit of a dick.\n\nThe activity on the planet stops when the investigation team return to the ship, so Galen uses his amazing Technomage wizardy to project a super realistic hologram to the planet to see what’s there. The realism of this rendering is astonishing.\n\nOne of the alien craft appears, zaps him with a ray that extracts his holographic innards.\n\nI’m being a little snarky about the effects here, but they’re better when it’s throwing a lot of small spaceships on screen for a big battle.\n\nThey are contacted by the only remaining living person on the planet, who explains that 1000 years ago, the Shadows had left the same virus there that Earth is suffering from, so they froze their population, and set up automated systems that would dissect and analyze any aliens who visited the planet in order to discover if any of them had developed a cure for the virus. It’s a ‘Needs of the Many outweigh the needs of the few’ scenario. Gideon is having nothing to do with it, and leaves without taking any of their research. It’s a fictional version of the scientific debate over (for example) whether we should make use of experiments Nazi scientists did on people in concentration camps.\n\nIn the next episode, The Needs of Earth, Doctor Chambers walks in on Gideon watching porn. He claims it was stuff left over on a data crystal Max Eilerson gave him containing his latest report. Reminds me of a time that someone (possibly at a school) had a powerpoint deck on a memory stick, but also kept some ‘personal’ images on the same stick, and the PC connected to the projector was configured to automatically start a slideshow if it found images on a memory stick.\n\nGideon is given information about someone who has downloaded a huge amount of data about their planet and intends to sell them to the highest bidder. He wants to get the data, and suddenly, the moral lines don’t matter so much to him, like they did in the previous episode. To be fair, we’ve skipped an episode here, so the weird contradiction between Gideon’s stance at the end of Racing the Night probably didn’t seem as obvious as it does here.\n\nWhen the alien listens to some Mozart, he decides to give his data stash to Gideon, and agrees to return to his planet when his people come after him. Then kill him and leave, but Gideon has copies of his data – not scientific discoveries, but all the art, writing and music of his planet, which he saved after their government banned all art and music and destroyed it all.\n\nI quite enjoyed these episodes, but I think the thing that’s bothering me about this is how the main characters are all set up in conflict with each other. I’d prefer a little more teamwork and mutual support, to be honest. And I don’t like the theme music.\n\nAfter this episode, the recording continues with an episode of Friends – The One with the Evil Orthodontist. Rachel ill-advisedly starts seeing her ex.\n\nAdverts:\n\nPringles\n\nFiat Seicento\n\ntrail: Xena/X Files\n\ntrail: Weekender\n\ntrail: Prickly Heat\n\nVW Passat – Nick Broomfield\n\nFlora\n\nJif\n\nPhysio Sport\n\nGap\n\nDiet Coke\n\ntrail: The Jack Bull\n\ntrail: Star Trek Voyager/Brimstone\n\ntrail: Dream Team\n\nFiat Seicento\n\nKit Kat\n\nP&O Stena Line\n\nFoster’s\n\nTampax\n\nSouth Park Bigger, Longer & Uncut in cinemas\n\nFiat Seicento\n\ntrail: ER\n\ntrail: Friends\n\ntrail: Sky Sports Extra\n\nFord Focus\n\nTwix Ice Cream\n\nDry Blackthorn Cider\n\nTesco – Prunella Scales Jane Horrocks John Gordon Sinclair\n\nP&O Stena Line\n\nGo Ahead\n\nMetz – Julian Barratt\n\ntrail: Storm Warning\n\nSanatogen Gold\n\ntrail: Planet One\n\ntrail: Weekender\n\nCoca Cola\n\nTalking Pages\n\nDirect Line\n\nGolden Grahams\n\nSheba\n\nFord\n\ntrail: The Muscles From Brussels\n\ntrail: The Simpsons Hi D’oh Hi\n\nFiat Punto\n\nFire Kills\n\nSpecial K\n\nKit Kat\n\nP&O Stena Line\n\nKodak Gold Ultra\n\nOlivio\n\nFiat Punto\n\nDry Blackthorn Cider\n\nSky\n\ntrail: Friends\n\nPeugeot 306\n\nMilky Way\n\nSanatogen Gold\n\nHead & Shoulders – Courtney Cox\n\nSpecial K\n\nBud Ice\n\nPeugeot 306\n\ntrail: Sky Sports\n\nCream Ibiza Departures\n\nHeineken\n\nSainsbury’s\n\ntrail: Autumn on Sky One\n\ntrail: Weekender\n\nRenault Megane\n\nDomestos\n\nRice Krispies Squares\n\nRoC\n\nT/Gel\n\nRowntrees Fruit Pastilles\n\nGap\n\nVanish\n\nRenault Megane\n\ntrail: Sky Sports Extra\n\ntrail: Autumn on Sky One\n\nDairylea Lunchables\n\nCroc 2 on Playstation\n\nWH Smith – Nicholas Lyndhurst\n\nThe Sun\n\nDisneyland Paris\n\nVO5\n\ntrail: Buffy the Vampire Slayer\n\ntrail: Friends\n\nDell\n\nHomepride Pasta Bake\n\nL’Oreal Feria – Milla Jovovich\n\nWH Smith – Nicholas Lyndhurst\n\nDry Blackthorn Cider\n\nSpecial K\n\ntrail: Dream Team\n\ntrail: Planet One\n\nCitroen Saxo\n\nKenco Rappor\n\nSpecial K\n\ntrail: British Sex\n\ntrail: Autumn on Sky One\n\nKellogg’s Cereals\n\nL’Oreal\n\nRoyal Mail\n\nDry Blackthorn Cider\n\nThe Times\n\nPringles Right\n\nVO5\n\ntrail: Fallen\n\ntrail: Naked in Westminster\n\nJMC\n\nMartine McCutcheon – You Me & Us\n\nMorgan Stanley Dean Witter\n\nWorthington\n\ntrail: Autumn on Sky One\n\nFirst on this tape, over on Sky One, The Simpsons – Bart the Fink.

But then he finds it’s stamped with a Cayman Islands account, and when he asks the bank why, they find out Krusty is a huge tax cheat.\n\nGuest appearance from Bob Newhart.\n\nAfter this, recording continues for a short time, with the start of Beverly Hills 90210. I had no idea Emma Caulfield was a regular.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the recording switches to LWT and it’s another awards show, Bafta Awards 1996. And look, it’s Angus Deayton hosting again.\n\nThe first award, for Best Entertainment Performance is presented by Joan Collins\n\nThe winner is Rory Bremner.\n\nOne of the other nominees was Paul Merton, so after Rory has accepted the award, he gets to say “Congratulations Rory, Thank You Joan and tough shit Paul”. I couldn’t hear Paul’s shouted retort, sadly.\n\nThe next award is for Best Television Actress, presented by Stephen Fry, butt of jokes about not turning up at theatres after his now legendary jaunt to Belgium when he was supposed to be appearing in Cell Mates.\n\nThe winner is Jennifer Ehle, for Pride & Prejudice.\n\nThe next award is for Best Comedy Programme, and presented by Vic & Bob.\n\nIt’s won by Father Ted, although they don’t get to make a speech.\n\nCaroline Quentin presents the Best Talk Show award.\n\nFor reasons surpassing understanding, this is won by Panorama for their interview with Princess Diana. Literally not a talk show, something which Angus Deayton raises several times after this. Such stupidity.\n\nThe next award is Best Comedy Performance, presented by Patsy Kensit.\n\nIt’s won by Martin Clunes.\n\nClive James presents the award for Best Drama Serial\n\nThe award goes to The Politician’s Wife. It’s looking like general programme awards aren’t getting to make speeches, a weird kind of cultural apartheid.\n\nEmma Thompson presents the award for Best Television Actor.\n\nIt goes to her old Tutti Frutti and Al Fresco chum Robbie Coltrane for Cracker.\n\nThe next presenter is Kelsey Grammer, presenting Best Entertainment Series.\n\nIt’s won by The Mrs Merton Show.\n\nNext, John Prescott presents the award for Best Drama Series.\n\nIt’s another win for Cracker.\n\nNext, two audience awards, sponsored by Lloyd’s Bank, so Michael Barrymore presents, assisted by the Chief Executive of Lloyd’s Bank.\n\nThe TV award is won by The X Files, so it’s accepted by Gillian Anderson\n\nDavid Duchovny\n\nand creator Chris Carter.\n\nIt’s won by Braveheart, and Mel Gibson also collects it via a clip. Does anyone give a shit about Braveheart nowadays? I’m probably just salty because Apollo 13 was the best film that year, and it was robbed. Plus, you know, Mel Gibson.\n\nThat’s it for the TV awards, and Angus Deayton is shunted off stage to make way for the presenter of the film awards, Peter Ustinov. He introduces a montage of film clips, to mark the centenary of British Film.\n\nJoely Richardson and Tim Roth present the Alexander Korda award for Outstanding British Film.\n\nIt’s won by The Madness of King George. That’s producer David Parfitt there, who I most remember being Wendy Craig’s son in And Mother Makes Three.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay is presented by Melvyn Bragg\n\nIt’s won by John Hodge for Trainspotting\n\nThe next award is for Best Supporting Actor, presented by Charlotte Rampling and Richard E Grant.\n\nThe winner is Tim Roth for Rob Roy. Anyone remember Rob Roy? Anyone?\n\nThey also present the Best Supporting Actress award to Kate Winslet for Sense and Sensibility. I definitely remember that one.\n\nPresenting the award for Best Director is Ian McKellen.\n\nThe winner is Michael Radford for Il Postino, another arthouse film that probably doesn’t bother Best Of lists any more. Or am I just an inverse snob. At least Mel Gibson didn’t win.\n\nThe next award is Best Actor, presented by Julie Walters.\n\nThe winner is Nigel Hawthorne for The Madness of King George. I still haven’t seen that, but I don’t think that one’s been forgotten.\n\nJeremy Irons presents the award for Best Actress.\n\nIt’s won, quite rightly, by Emma Thompson for Sense and Sensibility.\n\nThe next presenter is Angela Lansbury, presenting the Best Film award.\n\nIt’s won by Sense and Sensibility, another correct result. It’s accepted by Emma Thompson (who wrote the script, let’s not forget) and producer Lindsay Doran.\n\nI’m glad they won, but I wonder what would have happened if Babe had to accept the award.\n\nAngus is back now for some of the special awards. The Richard Dimbleby award is presented by Rory Bremner.\n\nIt’s awarded to Jeremy Paxman.\n\nThe Princess Royal makes her customary speech, although the lighting has gone a bit strange, as she’s in shadow for some of this.\n\nThe next presenters are Alan Bates\n\nAnd Joanna Lumley\n\nIt’s the Bafta Fellowship, presented to director John Schlesinger.\n\nAnd that’s the end of the awards.\n\nAfter this, the recording continues, with a film, Where Angels Fear To Tread. There’s over an hour of the film before the tape ends.\n\nAdverts:\n\nProgram\n\nThat’s Life\n\nUtterly Butterly\n\nBT\n\nQuavers\n\ntrail: Deep Space Nine\n\ntrail: Baby’s Day Out\n\nCorn Flakes\n\nDance Zone 7\n\nDaily Star – Barb Wire\n\nPepsi\n\nCorn Flakes\n\ntrail: Strange Luck\n\ntrail: Football\n\nBritish Pork\n\nPantene\n\nBounty\n\nTesco – Prunella Scales Jane Horrocks\n\ntrail: Corrina, Corrina\n\nMichelin Energy\n\nUnigate\n\nDirect Line\n\nHonda\n\ntrail: Where Angels Fear To Tread\n\nNew Zealand Lamb\n\nFuji Fotonex\n\nBusiness Pages\n\nCitroen Xantia – Bryan Brown\n\nBoddingtons\n\nLloyd’s Bank\n\nBarclaycard – Rowan Atkinson\n\nBritish Airways\n\nThat’s Life\n\nPC World\n\nBMW\n\nBarclaycard – Rowan Atkinson\n\nCoca Cola\n\nCellnet\n\nCapital Radio\n\nKronenbourg 1664\n\nAce Biscuit\n\nRover\n\nRenault Megane – Tony Gardner\n\nBusiness Pages\n\nCapital Radio\n\nCaffrey’s\n\nTesco – Prunella Scales Jane Horrocks\n\nRenault Megane – Tony Gardner\n\nOrange\n\nHeineken Export\n\nCapital Radio\n\nSpecial K – Gaddesden Place\n\nCitroen Xantia – Bryan Brown\n\nRadio Rentals\n\nTGI Friday’s\n\nUnigate\n\nRimmel\n\ntrail: Working Girl\n\nHellmann’s\n\nGeneral Accident Direct\n\nMichelob\n\nCellnet\n\nPantene\n\nCheltenham & Gloucester\n\ntrail: World In Action\n\nAudi A8\n\nKronenbourg 1664\n\nThe Birdcage in cinemas\n\nSetlers Antacid\n\nNytol\n\nWeightwatchers\n\nICL\n\nMcDonalds\n\nBritish Airways\n\nChatback\n\nGeneral Accident Direct\n\nCellnet\n\nThat’s Life\n\nWorthington Draught – Harry Enfield\n\nSetlers Antacid\n\nNytol\n\nHellmann’s\n\nKFC\n\nPeugeot 306\n\nWe’re spending a lot of time on BBC One on Saturday Night recently, and we’re back there today with a tape that opens with the end of an episode of Dad’s Army. It’s a bit of a jumpy opening to the tape.\n\nThere’s a trailer for tonight’s programmes, and an advert for how to pay for your TV Licence.\n\nThen, back to Metropolis for The New Adventures of Superman and we finally get to watch the final part of a three part story we’ve seen on two other tapes – Voice from the Past. The last episode ended with Lex Luthor’s secret son Leslie Luckaby, learning from a tape of his father that Superman is also Clark Kent.\n\nLois and Clark have discovered that Leslie is really Lex Jr. Leslie admits it, but tells Lois that he wants to atone for his father’s wrongdoings.\n\nBut in reality, Lex’s son is actually the strange Mr Smith, who, according to Leslie, can’t operate above ground because he’s too hideous.\n\nIt all starts becoming a bit Phantom of the Opera, as Lex Jr starts controlling Lois. He can see what she sees and hear what she hears, and also zap her remotely. So he gets Lois to tell Clark she’s leaving him. She does this, but also writes a note saying “Danger” and mouths “I love you” to him. I’m really enjoying this.\n\nSmith is forcing Lois to have a romantic date with Leslie. So now it’s Phantom crossed with Cyrano de Bergerac?\n\nLex’s lair is in abandoned subway stations – no doubt a callback to the original Christopher Reeve movie. But is Hob’s Bay also a Quatermass reference.\n\nLeslie tries to stand up to Lex, but backs down. Then Lex shoots him anyway.\n\nIt’s a shame the show has to make Lex’s disfigurement the reason Lois can’t love him, rather than his appalling personality. This is all very ableist. But this does mean we get to see him lament his woes to the backing of Nessun Dorma.\n\nSuperman tracks signals to Lex’s lair – this is 100% riffing on Superman the Movie as Superman breaks through.\n\nLex wants to use his power of life and death over Lois to have Superman work for him. Superman’s solution is a little cold.\n\nAnd with Lois frozen, Lex can’t kill her. But Superman can’t touch Lex without setting off a large bomb. But before Lex can set off the bomb himself, Luckaby returns, not dead after all, just covered in shit from the sewer. He touches Lex’s force field, which sets off the bomb.\n\nSuperman stops the building collapsing by fixing the one steel beam. By the way, heat vision can melt steel beams.\n\nSuperman warms up Lois and she’s OK.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 14th June 1997 – 18:20\n\nBefore the next episode there’s another bit of Dad’s Army. Then trailers for The Queen Welcomes The Matthew and The Broker’s Man.\n\nThen the next episode of The New Adventures of Superman – I’ve Got You Under My Skin. I’m immediately interested because the great Tim Thomerson is a guest star, playing Woody Samms, a man who’s wanted by the mob, but who can swap his mind into animals.\n\nHe’s able to do this because of a mystic, Asabi, played by Shaun Toub. He appears to be Indian, judging by the accent, although Toub was actually born in Iran to a Persian Jewish family so I guess it’s a case of ‘get someone vaguely foreign seeming.’ It’s dangerously close to Fisher Stevens in Short Circuit. If Toub looks familiar, it’s because he later appeared in Iron Man as Yinsen, the man who helped Tony Stark build the original suit when he was captured at the start, and one of my favourite characters.\n\nWoody’s plan is to swap with the mob boss, Little Tony, to cancel his contract on him. But to get close to Little Tony, he has to swap with someone who can meet with Tony – that’s Clark. Cue Body Swap shenanigans.\n\nOnce he discovers who Clark really is, Woody doesn’t want to swap back. Who can blame him.\n\nBut keeping hold of the body seems to be making him less invulnerable.\n\nHe still doesn’t want to give it up, even when Lois discovers the truth. He’s actually scary here.\n\nBut when he hears his daughter is trapped in a burning building by Little Tony, he has to go and save her – but she’s scared because he’s not invulnerable, so he swaps back with Clark who’s there in his real body, and the real Superman can save his daughter.\n\nBut Little Tony sees Woody and shoots him. Just before he dies in his daughter’s arms, he transfers his mind into Little Tony’s tiny toy dog. Surprisingly moving for such a weird ending.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 21st June 1997 – 18:20\n\nBefore the next episode there’s the end of Tom and Jerry.\n\nThere’s a trailer for Animal Hospital Revisited. Plus a special Songs of Praise coming from Court Number One at Wimbledon. Special guest Cliff Richard.\n\nThen, The New Adventures of Superman – Toy Story. Someone is abducting kids. Quite a creepy opening.\n\nThe kidnapper is a toy inventor, who keeps the kids to test his toys, along with an assistant.\n\nHe kidnaps Dr Klein from STAR Labs.\n\nInvestigating the kidnappings, Lois ends up also a prisoner. She has to tell the kids a story to stop them being upset, so she tells the story of Superman’s arrival on Earth. The show is definitely at its best when it’s leaning into its mythos. And I’m enjoying the running thread about Clark and Lois preparing for parenthood.\n\nAnd in a subplot, Perry is trying the lonely hearts, and the woman who responds is Alice, his ex-wife.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 28th June 1997 – 17:50\n\nBefore the last episode there’s the end of a Bugs Bunny cartoon.\n\nThere’s a trailer for Animal Hospital Revisited and Celebrity Ready Steady Cook.\n\nThen, the last ever episode of The New Adventures of Superman – The Family Hour. Clark’s parents have sent over his old crib, as they’re excited at the idea that they might be seeing a grandchild.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Fat Head Mensa is released from prison. He can control things with his mind. Although he looks a lot like comedian Andy Zaltzman, he’s actually played by Harry Anderson, Harry the Hat from Cheers.\n\nLois’s father is back, and trying to reconcile with her. I got confused for a moment, thinking that Michael Ironside played Lois’s father, but that was in Smallville, wasn’t it.\n\nClark comes back from Dr Klein with news. He says that His biology and Lois’ are incompatible, and they can’t have children. Reader, I cried.\n\nBut Lois doesn’t want to give up, so she suggests to Clark that they ask her father, the inventor, if he can help. He’s working with an assistant, Misha, played by Brian George, Babu from Seinfeld. He used to work with Fat Head Mensa.\n\nLois and Clark see an adoption counsellor, who gives Clark a glowing review, but says Lois, with her history of constantly being in danger and rescued by Superman.\n\nMisha learns from Lois’s father that Clark is Superman, and uses this to stop Fat Head killing him, so Fat Head kidnaps them, so Superman won’t stop a heist.\n\nBut the parents persuade Misha not to kill them, so when Fat Head tells Superman he can’t interfere, they’re able to let him know, by using a phrase Sam Lane used to tall Lois when she was a child, that everything’s all right. The parents even have fun pretending to be dying.\n\nAfter Superman foils the heist, Fat Head gets back to his lair and tries to use Misha’s brain-expanding machine, but it rather backfires.\n\nBack home, that night, Clark hears a strange noise downstairs. In the crib, they find a baby, with a note, saying simply “Lois and Clark, this child belongs to you.” I feel something like this was inevitable, given the way the show had been heading, but now I’m slightly upset that they never made another series, so we don’t discover how the baby got there, whose it really is, and how hard Lois and Clark find parenthood. But I have to say, this final run of episodes has, on the whole, been a lot of fun, and far better than my memory told me.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 5th July 1997 – 18:20\n\nAfter this, recording continues, with a trailer for One Foot in the Grave Selection Box and for a repeat of Pride and Prejudice.\n\nThen the tape plays out with about half an hour of The Other Half. I sat through a whole episode of this, so I couldn’t stand any more. The tape ends before the episode does.\n\nThis tape opens with an announcement that programmes are running fifteen minutes late due to golf coverage.\n\nThe first programme is Reputations – Wernher von Braun: From the Nazis to NASA. I’m sometimes a bit wary about these ‘dark side’ programmes about well known figures, but von Braun seems like exactly the kind of figure the format was made for.\n\nStrangely, after The Sci Fi Files this is the second tape in recent days that has referenced the Fritz Lang film Frau Im Mond (the woman in the moon) as it was an early influence on von Braun.\n\nVon Braun always claimed he had no knowledge of the use of slave labour in building his rockets for the Nazis. Yves Beon was one of them, and says that von Braun was often there.\n\nWhy do I remember Jesco von Putkammer? Was it articles in magazines like Starlog?\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 17th July 1999 – 21:00\n\nAfter this, you can chat live to Buzz Aldrin, “the astronaut who accompanied Neil Armstrong on the first trip to the moon”. I can’t imagine Buzz would appreciate this description of his contribution.\n\nThere’s also a trailer for the new series of Room 101, the first presented by Paul Merton (which appears later). There’s a strange cut in this version which might have been a tape glitch but seems more like a presentation glitch – it cuts after the mention of Jim Davidson, so you don’t see what he’s talking about.\n\nThen, The Not The Nine O’Clock News Story. Lots of interviews with the main players, starting with John Lloyd.\n\nCo-Producer Sean Hardie.\n\nJohn Howard Davies, who commissioned the show.\n\nIt’s always interesting to see things from pilots – John Gorman was one of the performers.\n\nIt’s nice being reminded of some of the very familiar ones. “Nelson’s Column? Pah! It is Nelson’s Willy.”\n\nMel Smith\n\nGriff Rhys Jones\n\nOther writers included Andy Hamilton.\n\nClive Anderson talks about the excitement of seeing his name in the credits.\n\nRichard Curtis, of course.\n\nJohn Lloyd reveals that the famous Constable Savage sketch was actually submitted by a police forensic scientist called Paul Newstead.\n\nHoward Goodall talks about the music for the show.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 17th July 1999 – 22:00\n\nRecording switches, and there’s the end of the Paul Merton Room 101 trail before the next programme. This one has the bit that was cut from the first trailer – here’s a full trailer compiled from the start of the first one and the end of this one as it’s revealed that Jim Davidson’s greatest fear is Paul Daniels. I wonder if they had to cut it earlier because they hadn’t got Paul Daniels’ permission yet.\n\nWhich is Not The Nine O’Clock News, a compilation programme (of course) so there’s plenty of classics.\n\nThere’s the fat darts players drinking.\n\nJim Carter appears as the scorekeeper.\n\n“It is easier for a rich man to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a camel to… Than it is for a camel to.”\n\nGerald the Gorilla. This was performed at a Computer Concepts Christmas party one year. “Wild? I was absolutely livid” is one of the best lines in sketch comedy.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 23rd July 1999 – 21:30\n\nRecording continues with a trailer for Due South. And a trailer for the new digital channel BBC Knowledge (which turned into BBC Four I believe).\n\nThere’s also a trailer for Goodness Gracious Me Night.\n\nThen, the first episode of Room 101 now presented by Paul Merton, and to pass on the baton, his first guest is Nick Hancock. His items are watching football, People who are happy, theatre and actors, being a teacher, New Year’s Eve, and People who can’t argue,\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 23rd July 1999 – 22:00\n\nRecording switches and there’s another compilation from Not The Nine O’Clock News including a rare glimpse of Chris Langham, who only appeared in the first series.\n\nOne of my favourite sketches. “My aunt, who I live with, had a parrot.”\n\nThe union negotiators is another famous sketch, featuring Jim Broadbent, although the presence of Chris Langham makes the jokes about sleeping with Rowan’s daughter “to be phased in by 1987” more creepy.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 30th July 1999 – 21:00\n\nRecording continues with a very long trailer about BBC factual programmes. I would post it but the music is The Beatles, and I bet that would get blocked.\n\nThen, there’s the start of Goodness Gracious Me, but recording switches to later that evening.\n\nThen, Room 101 with guest Michael Parkinson. His choices are football mascots, teenagers, the bit of cotton that joins two socks together, weather forecasters, the MCC, Teletubbies, and celebrities doing jobs they’re not qualified for.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 30th July 1999 – 22:00\n\nThe next episode features guest Julian Clary, he’s chosen celebrity parties, being on a boat, the left side of his face (which explains why he’s sitting on the left, rather than the right as is usual for guests), spitting, the countryside, and the lifespan of dogs,\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 10th September 1999 – 22:00\n\nRecording continues, and there’s a trailer for The Fast Show Night.\n\nThen, the start of Newsnight. Lead story is a plan to collect the genetic code of a million people. This recording stops after ten minutes or so, and underneath there’s a very brief snippet of BBC News Channel. Then the tape ends.\n\nIt’s movie time today, with a couple of movies from Sky Premier, starting with In and Out. I might have watched this at the time, but my only memory is a vague sense of what the film is about, so I think I must just be remembering all the trails and publicity for it.\n\nKevin Kline plays Howard Brackett, a teacher at a high school. He’s obviously inspirational and popular with the students.\n\nHe’s also getting married in a few days. I guess Americans don’t have the ‘bad luck to see the bride in her dress before the day’ superstition? He’s getting married to Joan Cusack.\n\nAnd as if that’s not enough excitement, one of his former students, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) is up for a Best Actor Oscar for playing a gay soldier.\n\nThe clips of the film he’s nominated for are pretty funny. This is not a subtle comedy. Here’s Dan Hedaya, prosecuting the case, asking about his possessions. “And an autographed copy of ‘Beaches’ starring Bette Midler.”\n\nThe other acting nominations, presented by Glenn Close, are a hoot. “Paul Newman in Coot. Clint Eastwood in Codger. Michael Douglas in Primary Urges. And Steven Seagal in Snowball in Hell.”\n\nBut the shock comes when Cameron wins, and dedicates his win to his old teacher, Mr Brackett. “And he’s gay!” Which comes as quite a surprise to everyone in town watching, including Howard himself.\n\nTom Selleck plays the entertainment reporter covering the story who, surprise, is gay himself. Although why he chose this particular movie to eschew his trademark moustache I don’t understand. Perhaps director Frank Oz thought the moustache would tip the audience too early.\n\nHoward’s parents are Wilford Brimley and Debbie Reynolds.\n\nThe school principal is played by Bob Newhart. He’s unhappy with having a gay teacher. I feel like, even in 1997, this kind of thing shouldn’t be as much of a thing as it is, but I guess it’s America.\n\nI did laugh several times, and you won’t be surprised to hear that the big finale, at graduation, where everyone there stands up and says “I’m gay” in solidarity with Howard made me cry, despite also reminding me of “I’m Brian, and so’s my wife”.\n\nAfter this, recording continues with another movie, Woody Allen’s musical Everyone Says I Love You. At this point, it almost feels like Woody Allen is a parody of himself. Not only is he here himself, this time he gets to make Julia Roberts fall in love with him because his daughter spies on her mother, who’s a therapist, and Roberts is a patient, so he knows about all her innermost desires. It’s the creepiest of pick-up artist moves, and I guess he thinks it’s charming. Plus, the film explicitly states that he’s an incredible lover. It’s just gross.\n\nOther characters are Lukas Haas, the young man who has horrified his liberal parents by being radicalised by the National Review into being a conservative.\n\nHis father is Alan Alda.\n\nLet’s add to the Woody Allen fantasy world, as his ex-wife is Goldie Hawn.\n\nIt’s the kind of ludicrously rich New York society where Itzhak Perlman comes to play violin.\n\nEd Norton and Drew Barrymore are a couple.\n\nNatasha Lyonne plays Woody’s daughter, who’s giving him all the advice.\n\nTim Roth plays a criminal on parole who is welcomed into the family home for reasons that escape me. I’m amazed he wasn’t animated he’s such a cartoon stereotype of a criminal.\n\nNatalie Portman plays another of Alda’s children.\n\nDid I mention it was a musical. No original songs, mind you, just the usual types of music that Allen usually laces his films with, only this time the actors sing and dance. I like musicals, but this one didn’t really do anything for me, with the exception of Allen and Goldie Hawn dancing next to the Seine, where she’s flying on wires. I’m a sucker for wire work.\n\nThis film really didn’t catch me in the right mood, I’m afraid. It all just feels by the numbers, as if you got a Machine Learning system to generate a Woody Allen screenplay. He’s done better.\n\nAfter this, recording continues and there’s the start of a movie called Ball Busters. Well, that’s what I thought from the opening, as someone is watching a screening of aforementioned movie, then gets beaten up. But suddenly there’s Barbara Hershey, who doesn’t seem like the kind of actor who would appear in a film called Ball Busters, then the real credits start, and the movie is Defenseless, which I think I’ve actually watched before and even said nice things about. But the tape ends during this recording.\n\nAdverts:\n\n1-2-1 Girls\n\nDulux\n\nHolsten Pils – Mark Williams Paul Whitehouse\n\nBernard Matthews Twizzlers\n\nSky\n\ntrail: The Postman\n\ntrail: Trojan War/How to be a Player\n\ntrail: Weekender\n\nGap\n\n1-2-1 Girls\n\nDulux\n\nDiet Coke\n\nIce White\n\ntrail: Blade Runner\n\ntrail: Sky Sports\n\nKellogg’s Cereals\n\nClairol Daily Defense\n\nIce White\n\n1-2-1 Girls\n\nVanish Mousse\n\nDairylea Strip Cheese\n\nMacleans\n\nAudi\n\ntrail: The Postman\n\nThis tape opens with the end of Antiques Roadshow. There’s a trailer for Hotel.\n\nThen, the final episode of Michael Palin’s Full Circle – Mexico, USA, Canada and Alaska. I’m quite a bad traveller. I get stressed about how things can go wrong. So I have to say that this caption actually made me shudder.\n\n“Mariachi Bands will serenade you wherever you want to go. Whether you like it or not.”\n\nThis shot, from above Zocalo Square, looked instantly familiar. It’s the place they filmed the Day of the Dead opening scene from Spectre.\n\nPalin tries some pre-Columbian delicacies – a range of insects. He tries some maggots. “That’s good grub.”\n\nHe makes some tortilla.\n\nIn a scene that would make the current President tweet angrily in upper case, Palin crossed the border by going under the fence.\n\nHe didn’t stay long, though, and pretty soon has crossed over legally. In San Francisco he meets two former prisoners in Alcatraz.\n\nFurther North in British Columbia, he meets some competitive lumberjacks.\n\nHe gets to 25 miles from the Diomedes Islands and has no way to go any further. Oh no, the jeopardy!\n\nBut the US Coastguard comes to the rescue.\n\nUnfortunately for the show, the weather is very bad, so they’re unable to land a boat or fly the helicopter, so Palin can only get to two miles from his starting point. A slightly deflating ending, but that’s on brand for the show, since his first show had a similar, slightly downbeat ending.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 9th November 1997 – 19:55\n\nAfter this, recording switches to Channel 4 and there’s an episode of South Park, Starvin’ Marvin. Hmmm. I’ve always been a little cool on South Park. Edgy for the sake of it doesn’t particularly interest me, and South Park seems to get away with a lot of bad stuff simply because they have a vaguely progressive slant. I just don’t trust them, really.\n\nBut when the boys are sent to the Principal, this made me smile.\n\nAfter this, the recording continues, and there’s a film. It’s The Howling, Joe Dante’s fun Werewolf movie. I read the book that this was based on, and the film bears almost no similarity to it. It almost might as well be an original story. But it does feature Robert Picardo (who became a Dante regular) in a werewolf transformation that used a lot of the technology that would be used in An American Werewolf In London.\n\nAfter this, there’s the start of a Joan Crawford movie, Strait-Jacket. I’m assuming it’s a horror film, because it’s directed by William Castle and written by Robert Bloch. I didn’t do much more than scroll through this, although I did spot Diane Baker, who we also saw in Marnie.\n\nThe tape ends during this film.\n\nAdverts:\n\nGuinness\n\nCool Grooves\n\nThe X Files in cinemas\n\nSash!
