        "text": "Jeri Jacquin\n\nComing to 4K Ultra HD, Bluray and Digital from writer/director Richard Curtis and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment celebrating its 20th Anniversary comes the beloved new classic for the holidays with LOVE ACTUALLY.\n\nEnglish Rock n’ Roller Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) is making a statement for Christmas bringing his own unique version of the song Love Is All Around. He promotes it but makes it very clear that it is horrible and he doesn’t mind in the slightest. Rather than party the night away, he joins his bff Joe (Gregor Fisher) for a night of drinking.\n\nMark (Andrew Lincoln) is the camera man on the day of friend Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and his love Juliet (Keira Knightley). Peter wonders why Mark seems to dislike his chosen bride but Mark is keeping a heartfelt and longing secret. Jamie (Colin Firth) discovers that his relationship is over, gets away to a cottage to write and meets Aurelia (Lucia Moniz). She doesn’t speak English which gives Jamie some relief except for one thing, words aren’t always necessary.\n\nHarry (Alan Rickman) runs an agency with Mia (Heike Makatsch) as his secretary. Wife Karen (Emma Thompson) is a stay-at-home Mom who makes sure the ship runs smoothly with their two children Bernard and Daisy (Lulu Popplewell). Harry seems to have become caught in a web that Mia is spinning and Karen is the one that gets caught in it surprised by a Christmas morning present. Also at the agency is Sarah (Laura Linney) who happens to be crushing on Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) but is dealing with the issues of her brother.\n\nDavid (Hugh Grant) just happens to be Prime Minister and Karen’s brother. At 10 Downing Street there are a lot of people and Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) is one of them. Together they work well until David begins to wonder if there is more and doesn’t want to be accused of any impropriety. Sometimes the heart wins.\n\nColin (Kris Marshall) decides he is only going to find love in America and ends up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. John (Martin Freeman) works as a film stand-in and meets Judy (Joanna Page) while doing love scenes. Both seem comfortable with one another and John discovers he can say how he feels.\n\nDaniel (Liam Neeson) is taking care of his young stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) after the passing of his wife. Sam is going through his own heart story with the very cute school girl Joanna (Olivia Olson). Speaking with Daniel about it all, Sam wonders how best to get her attention, especially since she is moving away soon.\n\nNeeson, Rickman, Firth, Nighy, Grant and Lincoln, Freeman, Marshall, Santoro, Ejiofor, and Fischer what can I say boys? Your storylines are wonderful and I couldn’t get enough of the wisdom from a step-father toward a boy who he sees as no step but just a wonderful son, to a PM who can shuffle with the best, to a man who will speak the language of love, to an aged rock star, to a man who should know better than to flirt with trouble and a man who knows when to hide his heart – you are all perfectly flawed human beings and we wouldn’t have you any other way.\n\nThompson, Page, Olson, McCutcheon, Knightley, Makatsch and Linney – ladies, just brilliant. You carry the light of family and see the frailty of husbands, to not being afraid of a powerful man, to discovering that a quiet love is closer than you think, to understanding that even though you may find love that other obligations can get in the way of the heart, to trying to take what isn’t yours, you are all women who make sacrifices in the name of dedication to love in all its forms and sometimes to the detriment.\n\nShout out to Rowan Atkinson as Rufus who kept me laughing the first time I saw the film and keeps me laughing still. I have never received a gift so well thought out and packaged and I’m not sure how I would react if I did however, if its Atkinson doing it – I’m all in!\n\nOther cast include Julia Davis as Nancy, Ruby Turner as Jean, Adam Godley as Mr. Trench, Michael Fitzgerald as Michael, Abdul Salis as Tony, Claudia Schiffer as Carol, Nina Sosanya as Annie, January Jones as Jeannie, Elisabeth Margoni as Eleonore, Meg Owen as Mary, Colin Coull as Gavin, Elisha Cuthbert as Carol-Anne, Ivana Milicevic as Stacey, Shannon Elizabeth as Harriet, Denise Richards as Carla, Marcus Brigstocke as Mikey, and Billy Bob Thornton as the U.S. President.\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment has just added an amazing film to their library and making it available for us to all experience and re-experience in our own home theaters. There are films of every genre available from scary to drama to family films. For more of what they have to offer please visit http://www.uphe.com.\n\nMOVIES ANYWHERE gives viewers the ability to download the Movies Anywhere App. With that you can view films by downloading or streaming to your favorite device using a Digital Code. For more information on Movies Anywhere please visit http://www.MoviesAnywhere.com.\n\nBonus Features include Making LOVE ACTUALLY – Join writer/director Richard Curtis along with the cast and crew as they reflect on the making of the film and its legacy twenty years later, Deleted Scenes with Introductions by Richard Curtis, The Music of LOVE ACTUALLY with Introductions by Richard Curtis, The Storytellers – A featurette exploring the film’s main storylines, featuring interviews with the cast discussing their characters and the major elements within each on-screen relationship.\n\nAlso included is Kelly Clarkson “The Trouble with Love is” Music Video, Bill Mack “Christmas is All Around” Music Video and Feature Commentary with Director Richard Curtis and Actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Thomas Sangsters.\n\nThis film stole my holiday heart when I first saw it in 2003, yes it started out because Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman were in it but man, the entire cast just gave me Christmas tingles. The story is so heartfelt and sticky sweet which I usually barf over but I couldn’t help myself, I fell in ornament hook, lights line and full stocking sinker. The cast is absolutely brilliant and each character having a story of their very own is stunning still.\n\nLook, I love me a good rom-com but LOVE ACTUALLY is so much more than that. Yes, it is on my Christmas stack of must-watch holiday movies after DIE HARD (get over it – think of it as an Alan Rickman double feature if you must). This film is about relationships, love, messiness of being a human being, whacky emotions trying to find the right places to settle, pushing the limits of the heart into places they/we are scared to go, and, of course the joy of Christmas that give us the extra push to say those three little words ‘I love you’ to someone who needs to hear it.\n\nThere is nothing, and I mean nothing that writer/director Curtis left out of this film. If anything was ever to be changed, I think I might have to throw a huge fit and Santa wouldn’t like that. It is a film of joy, love, celebration and by the end of the film, no matter how many times you watch it, the heart is just giggling with joy.\n\nSo, Happy Anniversary LOVE ACTUALLY, you have not aged a day and the world still loves you and isn’t that what it’s all about?\n\nIn the end – love is actually all around!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to 4K Ultra HD, Bluray and Digital and currently on digital from director Sam Raimi, Marvel and Walt Disney Home Entertainment is DR. STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS.\n\nAmerican Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) is being hunted by a demon while looking for the Book of Vishanti and oddly enough is rescued by Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Trying to get away, America accidentally brings herself to Earth-616. At the wedding of ex-girlfriend Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), Strange has jump into action and rescue America with the help of Sorcerer Supreme Wong (Benedict Wong).\n\nAmerican tries to explain that she has the power to travel through multiverses and that’s why the demons are hunting her. Strange discovers rune markings but knows only one person who would understand them, Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen). The problem is, she is the one responsible for America’s problems after getting the Darkhold, she is now the Scarlet Witch.\n\nShe believes that taking America’s powers will bring her back to sons Billy and Tommy. Dr. Strange refuses to let him have the girl and that’s when the Scarlet Witch attacks the Kamar-Taj. In the midst of it, America and Dr. Strange transport to Earth-838. There, Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who is the Sorcerer Supreme in this version of Earth, takes Dr. Strange as a prisoner believing it is for the best.\n\nWhen America and Dr. Strange confront the Scarlet Witch, but it is when Maximoff sees what she has become through her children’s eyes is their hope that the madness will stop!\n\nCumberbatch as Dr. Strange returns to his cloak and attitude except this time there are more of him to deal with. I have to say that it seems Cumberbatch is having a great time even though the story is an intense one. Gomez as America is a young lady that does not know the extent of her own powers but soon will. She gives a fast-paced performance in a story that is very complex.\n\nOlsen as Maximoff is terrifying in this incarnate of her role but then again when last we saw her, the world she had made for herself was falling apart. Her anger is getting the better of her and everyone in her way will feel that wrath. Olsen gives an amazing performance and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this character that lives in pain and only sees revenge.\n\nWong as Sorcerer Supreme helps Strange even though every fiber of his being knows that is going to be trouble and chaos. I love watching him in this role. Ejiofor as Mordo also has a chance to play his character differently. Being good at hiding the lies and getting his hands on Strange (no matter what incarnate) is the only way to stop more chaos.\n\nIt was great to see Captain Carter, Black Bolt, Captain Marvel and Reed Richards on the screen. I think Krasinski would do a stellar job as Richards as well as Theron as Clea.\n\nOther cast include Jett Klyne as Tommy Maximoff, Julian Hilliard as Billy Maximoff, Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Nic West, Hayley Atwell as Captain Carter, Anson Mount as Black Bolt, Lashana Lynch as Captain Marvel, John Krasinski as Reed Richards, Charlize Theron as Clea, Sheila Atim as Sara, Adam Hugill as Rintrah, Bruce Campbell as Pizza Poppa and Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier.\n\nBonus Features include Method to the Madness – Join various crew members and Marvel employees in interviews as they discuss their love of Sam Raimi and all the details of DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS that make it quintessentially Raimi, Introducing America Chavez – In this short and fun profile piece, we’ll learn about America’s humble beginnings in the comics. We’ll meet Xochitl Gomez and discuss the complications her character’s unique power presents for the future of the MCU.\n\nAlso, Constructing the Multiverse – Writing a feature film for Marvel is no easy task. In this playful yet informative featurette, we’ll dive into the challenges that writer Michael Waldron faced in creating the twisting and turning story of DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS, Gag Reel, Deleted Scenes such as A Great Team, Pizza Poppa, It’s Not Permanent, and Audio Commentary.\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment continues to bring quality programming to kids and kids at heart. Home of the most beloved animated features including SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO and SLEEPING BEAUTY to name a few is what keeps families coming back for more. To see what is currently available to add to your own family library please visit. http://www.movies.disney.com for their At Home titles!\n\nDR. STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS lives up to its lengthy title. It is fast paced so keep up and don’t look away from the screen. There is so much unraveling in the story that the intensity goes with a big bowl of popcorn.\n\nCumberbatch, Gomez, Wong and Olsen bring the story out slowly and the answers are not always what we would expect. Especially since there are different universes with different stories about Strange. Enjoy watching it all come together with vivid special effects as well!\n\nIn the end – enter a new dimension of strange!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nCurrently on 4K Ultra HD, Bluray and Digital from writer/director Roland Emmerich and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is the disaster of 2012.\n\nJackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a frustrated writer who has found himself now a chauffer driver of rich Russian Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buric). Spending the weekend with kids Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily), ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) is not surprised that he is late picking them up.\n\nThat is not the biggest worry in the world, that would come from Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who has been given bad news about the planet. Getting that bad news to Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) at the White House means telling the President Wilson (Danny Glover) as well.\n\nJackson takes the kids camping and meets Charlie (Woody Harrelson) who tries to explain that the world is about to experience its end. Believing that Charlie is a one card short of a full deck, Jackson takes it in stride. That is until a phone call from Kate after a hard earthquake brings them all home. While taking Yuri’s kids to the airport, Jackson feels the ground shake under his feet – now he is a believer.\n\nGrabbing Kate, the kids and her husband Gordon (Tom McCarthy) – they all hit the road just as everything around them is literally coming down. The one thing Jackson knows now is that getting back to Charlie to get more information is essential. Helmsely must break the news that everything he predicted is now speeding up rapidly and their plan for survival must start now.\n\nMeeting up with Yuri in Las Vegas, Jackson and his crew and the Russian and his family jump on the plane to find the arks Charlie spoke of. What they never expected was what they will find and how much harder their journey will be to survive the destruction of their world.\n\nCusak as Curtis is trying to recover from writing a book that did not do so well and a family that has moved on without him. Once the planet become erratic, the character of Curtis goes into hyper-survival mode and Cusak does what he does best – gives us a character that you can believe even with all his flaws. Peet as Kate still cares about Curtis even though he makes her nuts. Convinced that Curtis is their only hope, she stands by him and protects her children.\n\nEjiofor as Helmsley is a man who must bring the news to the President. Then a plan is put in place but even as that is happening, Helmsley knows that something is not quite right with how it is playing out. When it becomes clear, Helmsley fights for saving as man human beings as they can – no matter who they are. Platt as Anhauser is just how everyone sees a politician – a little crooked and a lot concerned for himself more than anyone else.\n\nBuric as Yuri is a rich Russian who get the tickets for his family the usual way – lots of money paid. The strange thing is I find Yuri an amusing character. McCarthy as Gordon isn’t happy with having to be saved by his wife’s ex-husband but he does his part to get the family away from danger.\n\nHarrelson as Charlie is terrific, trippy, funny, a little left of center and I absolutely loved his time on the screen.\n\nOther cast include Thandie Newton as Laura Wilson, Beatrice Rosen as Tamara, Alexandre Haussmann as Alec, Philippe Haussmann as Oleg, and Johann Urb as Sasha.\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment encompasses motion picture production for television, digital content and theater releases. The studios include Columbia Pictures, Screen Gems, TriStar Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, Stage 6 Films and Sony Picture Classics.

For more information on Movies Anywhere please visit www.MoviesAnywhere.com.\n\nThe Special Features include Discovery Channel’s 2012 Apocalypse, Theatrical Trailers, Picture-in-Picture Roland’s Vision, Commentary with Writer/director Roland Emmerich and Co-writer Harald Kloser, Alternate Ending, Interactive Mayan Calendar, Designing the End of the World, Roland Emmerich: The Master of the Modern Epic, Science Behind the Destruction, The End of the World: The Actor’s Perspective, Countdown to the Future, Deleted Scenes, “Time for Miracles” Music Video by Adam Lambert.\n\nIt is no secret to anyone who knows me or knows my film habits that I love a disaster film. I mean I LOVE watching things fall apart around the human race because it also shows the best in people. Of course, you will have a few characters that you want to throw in the nearest hole in the earth but, in general, its about survival and helping those around them to survive.\n\nThere is also this amazing creativity in that survival by the characters in these films and Roland Emmerich knows how to get that into all his films. Let’s face it, he has shown us some serious disasters with the films INDEPENDENCE DAY and DAY AFTER TOMORROW. The film 2012 takes that even further because there is not a moment to take a breath but instead feeling part of the group trying to survive.\n\nThat is what makes these films so great and 2012 is stunning in scope, special effects (that you forget are special effects) and the fight for humanity against mother nature.\n\nIn the end – the end is just the beginning!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nCurrently as a Netflix original film from director Gina Prince-Bythewood and Skydance is a story based on the graphic novel bring to life THE OLD GUARD.\n\nAndy (Charlize Theron) is the leader of a group of mercenaries that go where they are needed to right wrongs in the world. Along with her crew Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts), Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicky (Luca Marinelli), they are on a mission but finds it to be a set up. After a firefight, those doing the shooting realize that the Andy and crew are not as dead as they thought.\n\nWhile recuperating, soldier Nile (Kiki Layne) is doing her duty and trying to find a wanted man in Afghanistan. Thinking they had their man; it quickly turns badly and Nile is grievously injured. When she wakes up, Nile knows that something is different, and it isn’t until she is captured by Andy does she know what it is.\n\nAndy quickly explains that she is now one of them, an immortal and not just any immortal. They are hundreds of years old and Nile is the newbie. When they are attacked again, Nicky and Joe are captures and taken to a man named Merrick (Harry Melling) with the help of Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor).\n\nThey want the secret of the immortals, Copley for humanitarian reasons and Merrick for purely selfish reasons. Andy isn’t about to let that happen and with the help of Nikki they are going to get Nicky and Joe back, whatever it takes. When push comes to shove, nothing stops an immortal!\n\nTheron as Andy is as strong of a character as she has ever played. It is truly great to see this actress continue to take on roles that are strong, tough and kick-ass. I would expect nothing less after seeing her in the 2015 MAD MAX: Fury Road and 2017’s ATOMIC BLONDE. In this film she once again proves that she may be down again…and again…and again, but always doing right is timeless.\n\nLayne as Nile quickly becomes Andy’s sidekick being equally as tough and strong even being new to the immortal game. Knowing that what she has become changes her life in more ways than she could possibly imagine, she discovers quickly that she easily fits into this new life that she had no control over. Well done Ms. Layne!\n\nSchoenaerts as Booker has been with the group for more years than he can count, and he recalls what his life has been like so far. It is good to see Schoenaerts in an equally heavy character role and he makes it look so easy. Ejiofor as Copley has his own personal reason for wanting to find THE OLD GUARD, but he isn’t going about it the right way. Ejiofor seems to choose roles based on duality of his characters in dilemma situations but if you’re good at something, don’t mess with the formula, right?\n\nMarinelli as Nicky is just as tough, even if there is a relationship with Joe played by Marwan Kenzari. This duo put together are tough and strong in a situation that they have faced time and time again.\n\nThe surprise might be Melling as Merrick and it’s going to drive people nuts trying to figure out why he looks familiar. I’m not about to give it away either because I think it will be such a surprise when it comes to the viewer. Melling gets a chance to be a full grown greedy bad guy.\n\nOther cast include Van Veronica Ngo as Quynh, Natacha Karam as Dizzy, Mette Towley as Jordan, Anamaria Marinca as Dr. Kozak, Micheal Ward a Lykon, Shala Nyx as Gita, Majid Essaidi as Sadeq and Joey Ansah as Keane.\n\nNetflix is the world’s leading streaming entertainment service with over 158 million paid memberships in over 190 countries. Enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films, Netflix is across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere and on any internet-connected screen. For more information please visit http://www.netflix.com.\n\nTHE OLD GUARD is a film that mixes the possibilities of being immortal with what is means to live as an immortal. Living through the ages, Andy and her crew have seen it all and they have even experienced loss, but on a level that most humans cannot even comprehend.\n\nDirector Prince-Bythewood has directed a story based on the graphic novel by Greg Rucka that leaves the door wide open for another film and more story to tell. There are two points to notice at the end (and no I’m not telling you) that will make it clear that it is possible, and I actually wouldn’t mind seeing where the story goes.\n\nNetflix is working its flix-off to give subscribers some real quality entertainment choices. THE OLD GUARD is exactly what the quarantine ordered with adventure, action and a solid storyline that is easy to follow even if you have not read the graphic novel. So, break out the popcorn and have a Friday or Saturday night at-the-movies right in your own home.\n\nIn the end – forever is as hard as it looks!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to theatres from director Garth Davis, writers Helen Edmundson and Philippa Goslett along with IFC Films comes the story of MARY MAGDALENE.\n\nMary Magdalene (Rooney Mara) is a young woman living in Judea in 33 AD that is having a difficult time finding her place. Her family is constantly worried because of her emotional state and can’t understand why she doesn’t marry.\n\nWhen her father tries to have her cleansed of what ails her, Mary falls into a serious state. That’s when she meets Jesus (Joaquin Phoenix) who speaks to her in a way no one else has. She finds comfort in his company and to the astonishment of her family, Mary decides to follow Jesus.\n\nFollowers Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Judas (Tahar Rahim), James (Tawfeek Barhom), Philip (Uri Gavriel), and Matthew (Michael Moshonov) among others are not sure how they feel about Mary being with them. They are even more surprised that Jesus speaks freely with Mary and includes her in helping to speak with people.\n\nBut they have ideas of their own about what Jesus should be doing and how he should be freeing his people. Mary is surprised by what they think and does not hesitate to tell them so. The problem becomes more pronounced when Peter makes it clear that he believes Mary is weakening Jesus.\n\nThat does not stop Jesus from sharing with Mary his feelings and also shares what is to come. Their next stop is to Jerusalem where Jesus is not welcome by the Roman’s or his own people. As what is to come draws close and Jesus feels the weight of the world, Mary makes it very clear that she will be with Jesus every step of the way and beyond.\n\nIt is what happens three days later when Mary tells Peter and the other apostles about Jesus that she is once again comes under scrutiny. She doesn’t let it stop her from the strength she has gained in her journey with Jesus nor do they change the path she is dedicated to faithfully continuing.\n\nMara as Mary puts in a performance of a struggling young woman ahead of her time. She doesn’t want to follow traditions of what her family thinks a woman should do and be. There is something more out in the world and she knows its just waiting. The dilemma is the hurt she knows her family feels, especially when she turns down a marriage proposal. Mara puts in the emotional time showing every thought this character had up on the screen mixed in with her continuing struggle against those who would try to put her back in the box.\n\nPhoenix as Jesus is Mary’s mirror in that he also struggles with not being a traditional man but instead going out into the world to do good works. He is in constant pull between what everyone else thinks his role is and what he knows his role is. Jesus and Mary discuss what they can together and come to understand their protection of one another. Phoenix gives his take of Jesus as a man who already knows the course his life is to take and even in his human frailty and questioning knows Mary will help him see it through.\n\nEjiofor as Peter is the man that stands between Jesus and Mary as I see it. He wants Jesus to be the symbol of Jewish freedom but by Peter’s standards and he wants Mary to just serve the wine at dinner and stop talking to Jesus. Ejiofor portrays Peter as another who struggles but his, it seems, comes from a sort of jealousy. Rahim as Judas decides to force Jesus to do what they all think he should and the repercussions of his decision are here with us today. Rahim definitely has the role of a character who doesn’t examine beyond the choices he makes and this actor does so exceeding well.\n\nOther cast include Tsahi Halevi as Ephraim, Shira Haas as Heah, Ryan Corr as Joseph, Charles Babalola as Andrew, Tcheky Karyo as Elisha, Lubna Azabal as Susannah, Denis Menochet as Daniel, and Ariane Labed as Rachel.\n\nMARY MAGDALENE is, of course, the story of a woman who has been throughout history cast as a harlot, a prostitute and a woman of questionable morals. This film examines otherwise and shows instead a strong woman who sees herself as something more than a wife and a mother. In 33 AD, being anything else meant that there was something wrong and it had to be the devil working his ways.\n\nWhen Mary does take a stand for what she wants and where she is going, Mara gives this moment a face we can all identify with. Now we see another side of a woman who not only boldly breaks with tradition but follows a belief that makes sense to her heart and soul. Phoenix Jesus treats her as an equal, speaks to her as an equal and allows her to stand as an equal.\n\nThis film is beautifully put together with a star filled cast yet each actor downplays their character in a way that is relatable. Each is also emotional, understandable and brings us into their personal struggle with who they are and the paths they take.\n\nIn the end – her story will be told!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to theatres this Friday from director writer/director Scott Derrickson, Marvel and Walt Disney Studios comes the highly anticipated look at the mind bending world of DOCTOR STRANGE.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a world renowned egotistical yet brilliant Neurosurgeon who has everything. Outrageous car, fine jewelry, cool watches and a beautiful home overlooking New York City are just a few of the perks in his line of work. Proving that he is brilliant seems to bring satisfaction to his inflated ego and this is known by ER physician Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). Putting up with him is something she is willing to do understanding that caring sometimes means dealing with silliness.\n\nOne night after performing another feat of medical brilliance, Dr. Strange is on his way to a speaking engagement that is about to change his life. A serious accident causes devastating damage to his hands and sends him in an emotional tailspin. Trying to find a way to fix the nerves, he reaches out everywhere.\n\nDuring therapy he is told that there is a man who shouldn’t have recovered but did and this intrigues Strange. He discovers where this man is and questions him about how his recovery was possible. Being told of a place in Kathmandu, Nepal – Strange spends every dime of his money to get there only to discover it’s not like Googling the nearest Holiday Inn!\n\nHe meets Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) or rather Mordo meets Strange in an alley when he is being mugged. Mordo takes him to meet the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) but warns him to forget everything he thinks he knows. Strange uses his sarcasm and wit but discovers the Ancient One who is slightly amused by his deflecting of personal pain and shows him a world he never knew existed.\n\nHungry for more he is rejected, but his determination starts him on a voyage with training by the Ancient One and Mordo but Strange wants to learn faster. He takes it upon himself to study and read from their library run by Wong (Benedict Wong) who is keeping a close eye on Strange.\n\nWhile this is happening, a man named Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) has taken pages from one of the Ancient Ones books that has the ability to release a dark power. The Ancient One certainly has her hands full with the dealings of Kaecilius, training Strange and hiding a secret that could change everything.\n\nStrange becomes stronger and wiser (although no less twisted in his humor) knowing that with the help of the Mordo, Wong, the Eye of Agamotto and the Cloak of Levitation that chose Strange!\n\nIt is time to stop the destruction of the world!\n\nCumberbatch as Strange manages to totally surprise me in every way. Having gotten use to the attempt at villainy or the demure roles he has taken, Cumberbatch gave me laughs, chuckles, and accidental snorts. He totally nailed the ‘American’ accent without a slip up which is a weird pet peeve of mine.\n\nEjiofor as Mordo is the calmer character who understands Strange better than Strange does. Being with the Ancient One for a while also gives him deeper insight to help Strange deal with the ins and outs of what he has gotten himself into. Ejiofor’s character is calm until its time not to be.\n\nMcAdams as Palmer comes in and out through the film going from caring doctor and friend to Strange to awestruck by the return of someone different. She has the right demeanor to be surprised yet together in the midst of astral body wars! Wong as Wong is fantastic but then again I already knew he would be.\n\nSwinton as the Ancient One went through a lot of side commenting from fans of the comic about taking this role yet seeing her on the screen I loved it. Okay, so I’m a Swinton fan from way back and anything she does resonates with me but here she is down to the bare bones of a character with a secret. Well done.\n\nMikkelsen as Kaecilius is the biggest thrill for me. I have been following his career since first seeing him in 2000 Danish television series UNIT 1 playing Allan Fischer. The spark in his eyes when he was angry had me riveted because it was always followed with action instead of talk. He blew me away in the 2009 film VALHALLA RISING and the 2014 THE SALVATION. In DOCTOR STRANGE he has pulled out all the stops to be as evil as he wants to be and my only wish is that he got more screen time!\n\nOther cast include: Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Nicodemus West, Scott Adkins as Lucian, Topo Wresniwiro as Hamir, Umit Ulgen as Sol Rama and Benjamin Bratt as Jonathan Pangborn.\n\nTUBS OF POPCORN: I give DOCTOR STRANGE four tubs of popcorn out of five. I wasn’t sure what to expect but I am pleasantly surprised. My problem with other super hero films is that there are too many of them in one film for me to enjoy it. That isn’t the case here; instead I get one funny and quick witted man who comes to terms with his frailties.\n\nThat is what initially drew me to DEADPOOL, a combination of humor, sarcasm and frailties so I initially thought ‘well, it’s going to be near impossible to beat it’. Although it is still my favorite of the year, DOCTOR STRANGE certainly falls right in line close to it.\n\nI suppose I have to have sarcasm and wit mixed in with amazing special effects if you’re going to keep me planted in my seat. DOCTOR STRANGE does just that. It is entertaining, fascinating, funny, and just enough in the realm of fantasy to make it so dang enjoyable!\n\nThe cast that is put together bounce off each other in such a way that I cared what happened to them – yes I even cared what happened to Strange! Even though there are moments where I thought of other films in the sense of flying capes, twisted cities and a magic eye, it didn’t bother me enough to turn away. In fact it awoke a kid like curiosity!\n\nThe special effects are fantastic but then again if you are going to tell the story of Doctor Strange you better make sure they are above and beyond.\n\nWriter Stan Lee, who makes quick appearances in Marvel films, along with Steve Ditko created Dr. Strange. From the early 1960s till the present day it was only a matter of time before this particular superhero jumped from comics to screen.\n\nIn the end – open your mind and change reality!\n\nJeri Jacquin & Jenise Jacquin\n\nThis week with an all new extended edition is a 7-time Academy Award nominated film from director Ridley Scott and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment about a man who becomes THE MARTIAN.\n\nAstronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is with his crew including Lewis (Jessica Chastain), Martinez (Michael Pena), Johanssen (Kate Mara) and Beck (Sebastian Stan) on Mars conducting research. All is going well, that is until a storm comes in stronger than anyone had anticipated.\n\nIn one moment the team’s lives are in danger as the storm is tilting their ship. Getting everyone on board for an emergency lift off, the wind whips up debris throwing Watney to the wind. Believing he is dead the crew has no choice but to lift off to safety.\n\nWhen the storm passes, it becomes clear that Watney survived! Getting back to the base station, he quickly goes into survival mode. He begins to assess his supplies and what he can use to reach NASA.\n\nStunned, mission control on earth with Ted Sanders (Jeff Daniels), Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig), Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) and Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) try to come up with a rescue plan. It is out of nowhere that Rich Purnell (Donald Glover) gives them an option that they hadn’t considered.\n\nNow it is a race between the rescue team and Watney’s ability to stay alive!\n\nDamon as Watney is absolutely amazing. We certainly had concerns with his recent astronaut experience with Interstellar but we shouldn’t have been. He takes this role as a man left to his own devices on the red planet and just thrills from one problem solved to the next. Damon’s ability to use comedy in the middle of some scary stuff doesn’t diminish the fear, just gives us moments of nervous laughter as a release. Yes, we are Damon fans.\n\nChastain as Lewis and Mara as Johanssen are strong female characters who don’t take orders from the guys very well. Stan as Beck absolutely wants to break the rules to bring his friend home and there is a little love connection with Johanssen.\n\nPena as Martinez is an actor who consistently brings it to the screen. There isn’t a role he has done that we don’t like and THE MARTIAN once again proves he is a talent that has so much more to offer.\n\nDaniels as Sanders gets a chance to wear his bad guy-character suit. Of course some might say he’s just doing his job as the head of NASA, but there are moments we questioned whether he wants Watney to come home!\n\nGlover as Purnell is a whiz kid who has to convince others he knows what he’s doing. This is a guy with a big brain and a lot of coffee intake! Wiig as Montrose is disaster control and it’s interesting to watch this usual comedic actress stand there with a straight face, kind of scary really.\n\nEjiofor as Kapoor turns in a solid performance with a role soaked to the gills in science, Math, quantum physics and anything else one would have to know where Mars and a rescue are concerned.\n\nBean as Henderson is as bad ass as he wants to be. From the moment his character comes into the storyline it’s easy to see Henderson isn’t about to take any b.s. from anyone. He is combative, sarcastic, direct, snarky and has a few tricks up his sleeves and every bit of Bean’s portrayal had us cheering for him.\n\nOther cast include: Aksel Hennie as Alex Vogel, Nick Mohammed as Tim Grimes, Mackenzie Davis as Mindy Park, Zhu Tao as Chen Shu, Eddie Ko as Guo Ming and Sebastian Stan as Chris Beck.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment is amazing to once again bring just what fans want for their home library. Continually bringing new entertainment content for everyone’s media library, their format includes DVD, Bluray, and Digital HD. To discover more of what they have to offer please visit www.foxconnect.com.\n\nTUBS OF POPCORN: We give THE MARTIAN: Extended Edition five tubs of popcorn out of five. Matt Damon makes the entire film so fantastic to watch with his portrayal of Watney – or as we called him the Martian McGyver. The film is visually stunning with storyline and characters just keep it flowing in beautiful Bluray on a nice big home screen.\n\nThis is a film for everybody because it does have so much to offer. Damon deserves every accolade for this performance. Want to see what an actor can really do? Put him on Mars with some potatoes and prepared to be amazed.\n\nRidley Scott is a director that deserves so much respect, not only does THE MARTIAN prove it to us but his track record says so as well. Maybe a few of these film titles will ring a bell with ALIEN(S), LEGEND, THELMA & LOUISE, G.I. JANE, GLADIATOR, AMERICAN GANGSTER, PROMETHEUS, and now THE MARTIAN, so mad props!\n\nThe Bluray comes in a 2-disc set along with Digital HD with ten extra minutes of unseen footage. New Special Features with this set include Audio Commentary by director Ridley Scott, Writer and Executive Producer Drew Goddard and the author of The Martian Andy Weir, Deleted Scenes, The Long Way Home: Making The Martian, Dare Mighty Things: NASA’s Journey to Mars and Journey to Mars 101 Q&A.\n\nThis Bluray is truly brilliant with both the theatrical version of the film as well as the extended cut. If you waited to get your own copy of THE MARTIAN, wait no more! This is the edition you want for your home entertainment library.\n\nIn the end – help is only 140 million miles away!"
