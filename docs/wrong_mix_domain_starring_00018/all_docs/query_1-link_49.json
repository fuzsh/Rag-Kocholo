        "text": "2019\n\nDir: Bill Condon\n\nPros and Cons\n\nWell, the trailer certainly persuaded me. Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren giving naturalistic portrayals of ‘ordinary’ folk? The likes of Russell Tovey and Jim Carter in support? A London-proud film spotlighting numerous locations in the city I love? Dragons …I’m in. Turns out the trailer for The Good Liar may have been a little deceptive itself.\n\nRoy Courtnay (McKellen) is a dodgy geezer. An ageing con-artist, bumbling and gentlemanly by appearance, engaged in all sorts of dicky deals on the side, naturally making you question what might be lurking in his past. Meeting wealthy widow Betty (Mirren) on a dating site for the more mature client, he’s soon charmed his way into her life. Only Betty’s grandson Stephen (Tovey) can see it’s all way too much too soon. And as soon as Roy starts inveigling his way into her financial affairs too, Stephen embarks on a plan to reveal the skeletons in this imposter’s presumably extensive cupboard.\n\nAdapted from Nicholas Searle’s debut novel, you sense a solid, gripping page-turner informing the screenplay. In translation to screen though, it struggles to squeeze everything in while maintaining natural pace and credibility. But it’s still an enjoyable enough romp, if an unexpectedly frothy one considering the seriousness of the talent upfront.\n\nMind you, it must be nigh on impossible to go wrong with McKellen. It is highly satisfying to see him as crotchety but loveable pensioner giving it “ooh me war wound” with his walking stick. Doubly so, when he chucks said stick aside to gad about the seedier spots of the west end in low-rent gangster mode. Now and again, the mask of affability slips and the foul language comes tumbling out. But it happens so rarely it jars. While these outbursts are more shocking for their incongruity (presumably the intention), they always feel oddly uncomfortable precisely because of it. Helen Mirren’s role is deliberately downplayed and domestic, one that leaves you thinking her prowess has been under-used.\n\nAs historical flashbacks piece the back-story together, and it winds towards its conclusion, it’s all a little too …forced. With any less prestigious a central duo, it would probably sink in its own contrivance, without the supporting depth of the written novel. The end result is a confusing mishmash of tones. It’s a twisty thriller, aimed at the grey pound, with a lightly comic touch, occasionally lapsing into graphic cussing and hard-hitting violence. It’s all a bit disorienting.\n\nThis ultimately daft potboiler showcases two of the country’s finest in the lead, having fun, gaining our confidence as they go. The intelligent whimsy of the previous Condon-McKellen collaboration, Mr Holmes (2015), hit the spot entirely. But the blending of styles in this follow-up reduces its impact. I left with a feeling that The Good Liar had tempted me to the cinema on false pretences. Thank god it was in the company of such exemplary actors, who, by profession, are so good at lying for a living.\n\n★ ★ ★\n\n2019\n\nDir: Jim Jarmusch\n\nYawn of the Dead\n\nAnticipation was sky high for Jim Jarmusch’s The Dead Don’t Die. Understandable, considering the cast list. Fully aware this was its strongest hand (a hand breaking up through a graveyard plot, of course) it powered its pre-release advertising: “The greatest zombie cast ever dis-assembled”. Unfortunately such trumpeting may have raised expectations to a level the film couldn’t actually satisfy.\n\nI guess it doesn’t help that, within its tiny sub-genre, the zom-com has been comprehensively nailed on more than one occasion before. Beyond the now hallowed text of Shaun of the Dead (2004), America’s response a few years later, Zombieland (2009), was equally sparky. Even the under-rated and criminally under-seen Cockneys vs Zombies (2012) had wit and verve. And, um, actual jokes. In the eerily reflected light of those shining examples, Jarmusch’s lower gear style just doesn’t suit the material so well. For this is a decidedly slow-core take on the apocalyptic farce. Such restrained pacing is in line with the stumbling approach of the undead, yes, but this is so dragging of foot it trips itself up.\n\nCentreville, US of A. Reports abound that ‘polar fracking’ has tipped the world on its axis by a few degrees. Those in the know fear such a shift could trigger the dead rising. Even if it’s greeted with a shrug of resigned expectation by most. Meanwhile, the zombie-obsessive gas-station attendant (Caleb Landry Jones) sports his Night of the Living Dead badge, as if in hope. Then, er, the dead do rise (at once delighting and dooming him in equal measure). And that’s, er, pretty much it.\n\nYet the much-touted cast is strong enough to sustain it …just. Even the supporting players in this backwater hicksville are the likes of Steve Buscemi, Danny Glover, and the hirsute hobo in the woods, Tom Waits. As for the three leads, cop Adam Driver glides down the descent into hell with a calm, detached bemusement, while Chloe Sevigny goes for the opposite approach and completely freaks the hell out. Meanwhile Bill Murray is… well, Bill Murray. But one of the finest purveyors of the sardonic quip isn’t really given any funny lines. But then it’s not really a film for zingy gags. It’s a film for gradually realising how bizarre it’s all become with a gentle titter. Because it turns out to be a kooky little oddball. Fun to stumble across on TV after dark. Dare to imagine it without such high-profile names attached, though, and you’re likely staring down the barrel of a B-movie misfire.\n\nIn the grand zombie tradition, it takes pot shots at contemporary targets… Trump’s America, fracking of course… plus the required Romero-ism that we’re all zombies, sleepwalking through life, especially now we’re forever staring into the black mirror of our phones. So good, so zombie-horror-subtext. Yet such routine satire does feel a little old hat this time round.\n\nOn top of the quality personnel, a canny soundtrack buoys proceedings up. And the dispatching of the undead is done with originality and visual panache. Which is no mean feat. But, balanced in the nether-region between cutting satire, hilarious comedy and art house curiosity, the sum of all these (body) parts doesn’t really fit anywhere.\n\nThis self-aware sarcastic send-up may find a devoted fan base, once the expectation raised by such A-list names has died down. Because what Jarmusch has made is a lethargic cult movie for late-night consumption. Preferably after a bit of late night consumption. Only time will tell if it finds an audience and staggers on, or sinks back down into the dust from whence it came.\n\n★ ★ ½\n\n2019\n\nDir: Rishi Pelham\n\nDancing on the Edge\n\nHilda sets its stall out immediately. A brief pre-title sequence sees a young woman lost in movement among the neon lights of a dingy club. It’s pumping, colourfully abstract, but the scene culminates in a primal scream of frustration. It’s an attention-grabbing, neatly packaged summation of the themes that this film threads together. Hilda (Megan Purvis) is the eldest of two siblings, due to become three at any moment. In the opening act, we’re speeding to hospital with the family for mum to give birth. But the stress of the circumstance sees her parents descend into a screaming street row, which is only ended by police intervention. It’s clear this newborn will put their strained, verbally abusive relationship under even more pressure.\n\nFrom such a volatile home life, Hilda’s escape is dancing, for which she has innate talent. It’s her way of shutting out the harshness of reality, whether it’s practicing a routine at home, or being selected to perform in her school’s end-of-year show. She goes down a storm, and is just starting to attract the interest of elders sensing her potential. But when her parents reach breaking point, she’s left bringing up baby, as well as her precocious pre-teen sister.\n\nThe spirit of the movie feels fresh. It is part gritty Brit-drama, part contemporary dance showcase, creating a striking culture clash. It has the confidence to spend time exhibiting the dance performance when other productions would have cut away to hurriedly get back to the next plot point. Whether these routines pierce the dramatic tension is up to the viewer, for this is where its originality lies. These choreographed sequences are well conceived, often highly atmospheric, and you enjoy the liberation they offer, just as Hilda craves it. In accordance, the soundtrack, and the variety within it, is one of the production’s strongest hands, be it driving techno, syncopated offbeat jazz, or grinding street-funk.\n\nYet the reality is that our protagonist is in a desperate situation, and the film pulls no punches, with some scenes feeling distressingly near-the-knuckle. Purvis shines in the central role (both as actress and dancer), but the cast is strong throughout. With its kitchen-sink, realist aesthetic, the dialogue is occasionally a touch mumbled, but it feels authentic, and works within the whole. Life, and certainly Hilda’s, is messy, to say the very least. If it sometimes feels a little histrionic, with a few poignantly nasty moments, the fact is you can’t do justice to such an emotional subject by tiptoeing around it.\n\nIn a key scene, she reflects on Larkin’s ‘This Be The Verse’ with a friend. “They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They may not want to, but they do…” More importantly than examining this, it’s celebrating the human spirit trying to overcome those inherited shortcomings with creativity. Many of us have felt the need to escape, and with its compellingly original juxtaposition of story and movement, Hilda choreographs this rather affectingly.\n\n★ ★ ★ ½\n\n2018\n\nDir: Caspar Seale-Jones\n\nDream Demon\n\nTo Tokyo is intriguing on a number of levels. Firstly, it’s an entirely independent UK labour-of-love that alternates between urban Japan, and the remotest plains of South Africa. It’s also a highly proficient first feature from someone with distinguished cinematic lineage. Director Caspar Seale-Jones is the son of Trevor Jones, film composer with such modest titles as Notting Hill (1999), Last of the Mohicans (1992) and Brassed Off (1996) on his CV. Just as excitingly (to me, at least) I notice he also scored that wonderful episode of Michael Palin’s Ripping Yarns which lauded the hapless devotion of the lower league football fan, ‘Golden Gordon’. Okay, just me then. Anyway, with Dad dutifully providing the soundtrack here, we know we’re in good hands musically.\n\nBut To Tokyo is also a striking visual experience that succeeds in carving a unique atmosphere, and creating a spirit that walks with you after viewing. As such it represents clear and distinct potential for the talents of Jones junior.\n\nA young woman, alone in a Japanese hotel room, already in an anxious state, frightened even, seems wary of some nameless, unseen threat. When her sister catches up with her to inform her of some serious family news on which she must act, she has four days to get to Tokyo. It sets in motion a chain of events that sees our leading lady Al (Florence Kosky) having to face her demon before she can face up to what must be done.\n\nWhile it plays with elements of the genre, this is not your orthodox horror movie. It is a trip (in both senses of the word), a late-night mood piece with minimal dialogue, a visually rich, drifting nightmare. It’s also a fresh twist on the abduction sub-genre, which, let’s be honest, can often be a mundane, gruelling affair. Executing a couple of straight-down-the-line jump scares, they’re efficiently executed, but it’s strongest when it’s at its subtlest. Namely, a few genuinely creepy moments, scenes glimpsed and withdrawn, to be later recalled, as if from a bad dream. Almost abstract, almost expressionist, and completely gore free, this is where its power to disturb really lies.\n\nThe cinematography and editing is consistently strong and tight throughout, whether we’re traversing a sweeping landscape from afar, or focussing in for near-macro detail. The speech and sound detail feels close-up too; we hear every foregrounded aspect, but an absence of background ambience isolates the action in a vacuum, adding to the sense of hyper-reality. Virtually a one-woman show, Kosky (carrying an echo of a young Catherine Deneuve), gives a fraught but winsome performance, sustaining the film through to the resolution of her journey. Binding it all together is Jones senior’s score, sometimes statuesque, sometimes restrained, with touches of Asian influence, repeating vocal phrases that ramp up the disquiet.\n\nIf you’re expecting a run-of-the-mill chiller, it may feel a little loose, a little cryptic in the opening act, but then the plot starts pulling you in by suggestion. Within such an underplayed narrative style, it’s up to us to do the work, and therein is its satisfaction. To Tokyo introduces a bold talent in Seale-Jones, augmented by the authority of one of the best composers in the business. Artistic, hallucinatory, dark and impressive, it’s delivering an original villain, and a refreshing horror aesthetic. Which is no mean feat for a debut. As Al declares in one of her few lines, and distilling the production’s aim…“Don’t worry I’m not scared of him anymore, I’ve found someone scarier”.\n\n★ ★ ★ ½\n\n2019\n\nDir: Marc Zammit\n\nMean Streets\n\nThe story of homelessness in the UK is one of rising numbers. It’s an inconvenient truth that exists in the shadows, ignored by so many. This independent directorial debut shines a light on the subject, illuminating the darkness that makes it all too easy to overlook. It takes you on a compassionate and admirably ambitious, if slightly sprawling, journey.\n\nWith a flashback structure established in the opening frames, we look back over the life of Frankie, played by director Marc Zammit himself. Starting in childhood, we witness his first encounter with future friend Nicole (Jamey May). It’s a treasured early friendship against the background of a home life sullied by domestic abuse. When that violence finally comes to a head, Frankie runs away, unwittingly sentencing himself to a life on the streets at a tender age. He’s doomed to fall into petty crime, making numerous enemies as he goes. As the years go by and he transitions to adulthood, the man he becomes is shaped by the harshness of destitution, but his well-placed heart, his care for those around him, earns him loyal friends too. Feeling like he’s always on the run, though, will he ever find the courage to seek a way back home?\n\nWhat becomes clear is that every person he meets in this uncomfortable netherworld has a backstory. A reason. We’re following Frankie’s tale as the core narrative, but we gather glimpses into his associates and how they too ended up in such desperate straits. All have faced some trauma that either forcibly ejected them from a previous ‘regular’ life, or put them under an unbearable pressure from which they could only flee.\n\nThe cinematography of Homeless Ashes is its strongest technical hand. Its bleak chain of events is offset by some nice visuals, as we take in cityscapes of the capital and shots of the Thames as the life beneath its bridges is revealed. The natural darkness of the subject is countered by a background often rich with colour, say, the bright lights of the funfair, or the vibrant splashes of a graffitied underworld.\n\nThis is clearly lead actor/director Zammit’s film, a personal passion project, but, amongst many, he strikes up enjoyable friendships with familiar faces Jason Flemyng (sympathetic burger flipper Gavin), and Lew Temple, a fellow, and rather fatherly, rough sleeper. Mark Wind’s symphonic soundtrack is elegiac and emotive throughout, adding stately context to the pivotal moments.\n\nIn line with the chaos of a hand-to-mouth existence, as Frankie drifts from one crisis to the next, it has an organic, meandering, almost ambient pace. As a result it feels a little too drawn out, benefitting from some sharper editing, and you suspect the dialogue is a touch less salty than on the real streets of London.\n\nBut what is unmistakeable is a driving force to stare squarely into the face of something that so many of us, uncomfortably and guiltily, turn away from. There is genuine noble ambition in this, exploring a taboo that is perpetually neglected. As such, for a debut, this heartfelt indie Britflick is an impressive first feature, propelled by a benevolence reflected through Frankie’s personality. As his mum explains to her scared young son just before the explosive events that forced him to escape, “In a cruel world it can get in people’s heads and make them all wrong”. This is an attempt to do something right for the thousands of tragically ’invisible’ homeless, every single one of whom could tell their own story. If they ever had a chance to.\n\n★ ★ ★\n\n2019\n\nDir: Ari Aster\n\nWicker Mania\n\nFolk horror’s come of age recently. In the early days it was little more than a loose link between three works from the glory days of British horror, which shared something in spirit, but were, in fact, quite disparate films. Witchfinder General (1968), The Blood on Satan’s Claw (1971) and The Wicker Man (1973) set the benchmark, and the intervening years have seen more and more entries retrospectively shoehorned into the genre, while recent releases have capitalised on the renewed enthusiasm for it. See successful entry The Witch (2015), perhaps less so, The Ritual (2017). Either way, it’s proved to be an exceptionally difficult style to get right, all three of those archetypes being partly defined by daring originality.\n\nAcknowledged as the daddy in the field, respect for The Wicker Man has seeped steadily through the soil ever since. Now, nearly 50 years later, an enormous build-up of backed up appreciation springs forth. It is impossible to talk about Midsommar without referring to The Wicker Man. It is revisiting its themes so squarely, so wholeheartedly, and with such unashamed aplomb. Scriptwriter Anthony Shaffer sowed that devilishly ingenious seed all that time ago, and, nurtured by word of mouth and cult fandom, its stature has grown unstoppably since. This is a gloriously colourful outpouring of all things ‘Wicker’, nay Wiccan …extended, expanded and extrapolated, to be showered over a generation for whom director Robin Hardy’s prototype is now probably too ‘old-fashioned’ to appeal.\n\nIt makes for a thoroughly entertaining, not-to-say downright disturbing, two-and-a-half hours. Three mates visit their Swedish friend Pelle in a remote commune in his homeland, to witness some …er, ‘rural’ celebrations around summer solstice. Dani (Florence Pugh), girlfriend of Christian (Jack Reynor), tags along at the last minute, in the aftermath of an appalling family tragedy, hopeful of taking her mind off the trauma. Good luck with that. Especially if you’re going to take magic mushrooms the second you step out of the car. So the set-up might feel like a simple update of Sergeant Howie’s trip north of the border to Summerisle, but really, if you’re going to re-enter this realm so determinedly, what other set-up can there be?\n\nPugh, building on fine performances in the similarly sombre Lady Macbeth (2016), but also the joyfully empowering Fighting with my Family (2019), is hugely impressive once again. Right from the off, too. As she desperately tries to get in touch with her sister in the prologue, we’re hooked by a thoroughly convincing and emotional close-up performance. Boyf Christian and intrigued student Joshua (William Jackson Harper) are solid and credible, while Will Poulter adds as close as this film gets to comedy. Ok, there are precisely zero intended jokes in this drawn-out dissection of grim ceremony (sometimes, a literal dissection, mind), but Poulter’s sardonic asides bring the lightest sprinkling of something approaching humour. And boy, it’s appreciated.\n\nThe cinematography has a beautifully light, bright and clear colour palette. You have to wonder: has any horror film (a genre that obviously thrives in the shadows) ever been this resolutely sunny all the way through? So much so, it’s a plot point; it never getting properly dark at night in this neck of the woods. It disorientates both the American guests, and us, as we all lose any sense of a day’s passing. The effect is amplified by a lengthy runtime. Yes, it is kinda slow; an incremental creep towards a presumably inevitable conclusion, but such organic pacing fits with the return-to-nature ethos of Pelle’s peculiar pals.\n\nAs with many horrors, there are questions of credibility. Mainly, why the heck do the visitors stick around at all after the brutal shock of the first ‘custom’? And it is truly shocking. And yes, the whole premise is technically derivative, but it would be missing the point to criticise that. If you’re going to explore a world of ancient pagan terror you will unavoidably be in the looming shadow of its core text, so why not embrace it? Also, does Dani’s background familial anguish actually serve the plot, or is it only there to upset you from the beginning? It’s arguable either way. Whichever it is, you’re gradually introduced to a slow-release structure of unsettling imagery, such that you get rather acclimatised to it all. Only afterwards do those pictures flash back into the brain, re-emphasised in their gory glory in the cold dark of night.\n\nLike he did with Hereditary (2018), Ari Aster makes A-list shockers that are admirably extreme. He’s using tropes familiar to enthusiasts, but serving them up to a new audience in fine, full-blooded style. If you are acquainted with The Wicker Man, you will view this as a 21st century tribute, an exploded adoration. And if you aren’t, it introduces its ideas in magnified, technicolour detail, leads you down a similar garden path, and may just freak the sweet bejaysus out of you.\n\nAnd if you go down to the multiplex today, in search of a big surprise with your mates, you may just leave saying, “who the hell suggested THAT?!?” As the jolly group of wine and popcorn laden friends did in the screening I saw. The wicked part of me knows that, for the health of the horror genre, that can only be a good thing.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★\n\n2019\n\nDir: Danny Boyle\n\nMagical History Detour\n\nThere’s some sort of holy trinity within the creative DNA of Yesterday. An exploration of The Beatles songbook? Through a Richard Curtis script? Directed by Danny Boyle?? The mainstream box office would argue that’s a peak of potential. A sure-fire winner. So why have I just left the cinema with a nagging sense of disappointment?\n\nA struggling musician, waking up to the fact that everyone has ‘forgotten’ The Beatles, realises he has the opportunity for the fame and glory he’s always craved. All he’s got to do is… found an entire musical career based on a lie. Sorted. Ok, let’s start with the good stuff. The tunes. Obvs. And Himesh Patel makes a fine lead as optimistic busker Jack, a screen persona that is likeable, subtly amusing and musically adept. Lily James is just as engaging as his ‘manager’ Ellie, neatly balancing innocent charisma with a growing struggle of divided loyalties. But while their individual performances are strong, their will-they-won’t-they relationship never quite sparks. So the issues must lie elsewhere…\n\nLadies and gentlemen, you must first be aware that this is 27% Ed Sheeran vehicle. An inclusion that, with time, will only date the film. He’s been winning plaudits for making fun of himself, tongue firmly in cheek. The extent of his self-deprecation is actually to acknowledge, ‘Hey, I’m not as good as Lennon and McCartney!’. Thanks for clarifying Ed, we weren’t sure. But fair play, he is waggling a huge blue-handed signpost towards them for his fans. At one point he challenges Jack’s ‘talent’ against his own – who can come up with the best new tune within ten minutes. Our hero sheepishly treats everyone backstage to ‘The Long and Winding Road’, but the faux-humility of Sheeran’s ‘impromptu’ composition is almost cringe inducing. By this point you realise he’s hanging around way longer than a simple, enjoyable cameo, shoe-horning in his own work alongside such classics, and you’re just thinking, “Back off, Sheeran!”\n\nAs well as the time-honoured set-up of unspoken affection between the central duo, we also get the tried and tested Curtis staple of the ditzy best friend. Joel Fry is charming as scatter-brained doper sound-tech Rocky. But the dynamic (as nailed by Rhys Ifans in Notting Hill, 1999) is such a familiar retread, it’s starting to wear a little thin.\n\nThe event that triggers the core premise maintains an air of uncertainty too. Is it mass memory loss? Or have we passed into a parallel dimension where the band never existed in the first place? Events transpire to specify the latter, yet the world is not the profoundly different place it would be without the greatest ever influence in popular culture. It certainly wouldn’t be identical except for the absence of Oasis (which is a neat joke) and Coca-Cola (er, have I missed something here?). A character is introduced later on which confirms the alternate reality stance, but it’s so strange it adds a jarring touch of, well, creepiness. Even recognisable Boyle flourishes (like the enormous lettering sliding into frame to label the location) feel like such trademarks that they teeter towards pastiche. The magnificence of the songs is always going to win out though, and, rest assured, these are contemporary versions that do do them justice. And the fact that they shine unimpeachably within such a whimsical proposition amplifies their brilliance, albeit inadvertently.\n\nRight. You might be thinking: I’m being too harsh on a daft, sweet, joyful rom-com. But I can’t shake the feeling that …er, THE BEATLES deserve better if this is intended as a route to their world. It certainly seems to be designed as such: an introduction for post-millenials who, as implied by the premise, don’t realise their magnitude. Of course, if Sheeran is the best conduit to reach the young music fan (to whom the sixties will seem ancient) then he, and the purpose of the film, must be applauded. But, executed with much less sophistication, it’s easily outshone by both Rocketman (2019) and Bohemian Rhapsody (2018). And if this goes down as the Fab Four’s entry into the fad for jukebox musicals, where’s the justice in that?\n\nBy trying to tick the boxes of both rom-com and songbook cinema, it doesn’t score a hit in either. It goes without saying that the band’s legacy towers above an ephemeral pop moment like this. And maybe the problem does come down to the scale of that maximum promise. But I imagine we were meant to be heading home with a re-invigorated Beatles catalogue ringing in our brains. Instead, struggling to be heard over the echo of Ed Sheeran’s fingerpicking, the only trace of John, Paul, George, and Ringo I can make out is “Don’t Let Me Down.”\n\n★ ★ ½\n\n2019\n\nDir: Dexter Fletcher\n\nSpecs & Drugs & Rock & Roll\n\nIt’s like buses. You wait ages for a musical biopic of a prodigiously talented, flamboyant musical icon who peaked in the seventies …and then two come along at once. Well, within six months anyway. And directed by the very same Dexter Fletcher, who stepped in to successfully land Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) once Bryan Singer was unceremoniously ejected from that project. So Fletcher is turning out to be the J.J. Abrams of the new wave of musicals, Abrams being responsible for rebooting both Star Wars and Star Trek, franchises that had previously felt like opposing forces. Not that Queen and Elton John have ever felt oppositional. Turns out their film adaptations do take markedly different approaches though.\n\nBoRhap was a near-cartoonish amplification of Queen’s ascent, and the impact on its trail-blazing frontman. Perhaps a little too keen to protect the reputation of the adored but departed, it airbrushed out the grittier details, satisfying a wide-appeal 12A into the bargain. Rocketman doesn’t have to worry about such sensitivities, having full authority from the subject to reveal warts ‘n’ all in full detail. The warts in question being an early life of relentless alcohol and substance abuse. So it proudly sports a 15 rating on its feathered sleeve. Yet it still maintains the feel of a toe-tapping musical for the whole family. Or perhaps it reflects a maturing of the general audience that the explicit excesses of rock ’n’ roll no longer count as controversial. This is its core originality: to cover such adult themes within such a mainstream package. It’s the more satisfying of the two films too, being both closer to the facts, and jamming in oodles of Broadway-style razzamatazz. But it won’t match the runaway success of Rhapsody, very few acts having the global pulling power of Queen’s legacy.\n\nUsing Elton’s long-overdue, final admission that he is an alcoholic as its launch pad, it charts his early trajectory through extended flashbacks. We see a loving upbringing soured by a difficult relationship with Dad, his musical awakening, meeting lyricist Bernie Taupin (a pony-tailed Jamie Bell), the rise to mega-stardom that inevitably followed …and the descent into drug-fuelled self-loathing that went with it.\n\nThe soaring triumph of the film rests squarely on Taron Egerton’s shoulders. His central performance may prove to be career defining. He nails John’s mannerisms, always keeps touch with the ‘ordinariness’ of one Reg Dwight from Pinner, and submits a hugely impressive singing and dancing turn. It’s the hardest of things to achieve, but you do momentarily forget you’re watching a portrayal. As part of the publicity Elton was quoted as saying, “I don’t see Taron, I see myself”, and, while we tut, thinking, “of course he’s going to say that, it’s great PR!”, I have to report that, in brief moments, it’s true.\n\nOh, and then there’s the songs. ‘Rocketman’ itself is a tune so strong it has the lasting-power to span generations. With that as the centrepiece, his songbook is rejuvenated via stripped back, symphonic or pulse-pounding versions. Unlike some other jukebox musicals, there doesn’t need to be that much bending of ‘the truth’ to shoehorn in the hits either. The direct links between the highs of his repertoire and the lows of his personal life are clearly spelled out here like never before.\n\nDuring the early credits, the executive production nod (to the man himself, with husband David Furnish) does remind you that, ultimately, this is a promotional vanity project. Which does tarnish the sparkle a touch, just at the point when you’re basking in the glow of a thoroughly entertaining two hours. In this light, to then shout about how much the reformed John has given to charity is a virtue-signalling step too far, and only alienates.\n\nIt’s a shame it ends on its only misstep. But it’s not enough to diminish a sharp, self-deprecating, bombastic update of a stellar talent’s catalogue for a new audience. This is a fantastically enjoyable showstopper counteracting true-life hurt with overblown pomp and melody. Together with its mercurial rival, it cements the pop biopic as the freshest, most invigorating genre of the moment.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★ ½\n\n2018\n\nDir: Matthew Butler-Hart\n\nShore of the Dead\n\nIn a horror landscape terrorised by big-budget slasher remakes, twisting psychodramas and haunted doll sequels, you could be forgiven for thinking that a certain genre is down to its dying breaths: the gothic supernatural thriller. The husband and wife team behind British independent company Fizz and Ginger are aiming to inject new life into the style with their latest feature, The Isle.\n\nThe late 1800s. Aboard a lifeboat, three shipwreck survivors drift aimlessly. They’ve already lost any supplies, are rapidly losing their bearings, and will soon lose all hope. On the verge of despair, out of the gloom they finally spy land, washing up somewhere around the Scottish coast. Greeted by an intrigued but wary harbourmaster, they discover that the island they’ve stumbled upon is home to very few people indeed. But many secrets.\n\nHoling up with a local farmer, Captain Gosling (Alex Hassell) becomes suspicious when one of his fellow survivors doesn’t, er… survive. And so begins the drip feed of eerie revelations connected to the community’s past. Conleth Hill (Game of Thrones’ Lord Varys), is the sternly aloof farmer Innis, protective of the place’s dark history, while the ruggedly debonair Hassell plays the lead with sincere concern, comfortably withstanding a knock or two on his chiselled chin along the way. Tori Butler-Hart eloquently rides the fine line between matronly care and resisting her inner demons, and later we meet the albino-esque Lorna (Emma King), who naturally carries an apt touch of the otherworld.\n\nFittingly, considering the title, the real star feels like it’s the island setting itself. The windswept woods are portrayed with handsome cinematography and artful overheads, offsetting a hostile but picturesque wilderness against the sanctity of a rustic interior. The rural Victorian period is effectively evoked with earthen shades, nautical colours and crackling fires. And some well-executed jump-cut scenes imply something unsettling just beneath the surface. An atmospheric soundtrack contributes to a large part of the mood, with traditional Celtic folk heavily punctuating the plot, but never intruding. So this largely bloodless ghost story works on chill and charm, not gore, bearing a distant echo of The Wicker Man (1973), and other ‘gentler’ examples of folk horror.\n\nWith a satisfying resolution, it’s a fairly simple tale (as the Greek myths informing it tend to be), but balanced plotting and a slow-release flashback structure keep you engaged. Even if the visitors do seem to run aground with surprisingly clean hair for such desperately shipwrecked sailors. A truly homegrown labour of love, this is highly accomplished and passionate filmmaking. It’s refreshing, even heartening, to see a production standing out from the zombie-like crowd following mainstream horror trends, and carving its own spooky hollow where few films currently dare to tread.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★\n\n2018\n\nDir: Yorgos Lanthimos\n\nMonarchy in the UK\n\nHalfway through The Favourite, I realise it’s coming across like a sumptuous cross-breed of Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon (1975) and the TV show The Thick Of It. The former’s portrait of 18th century aristocrats employed solely natural light for visual credibility, including only candles for night scenes. Meanwhile Armando Ianucci’s vicious political satire lampooned the inane squabbling upon the seat of power. In gloriously sweary fashion. This latest from Lanthimos is just as delightfully foul-mouthed, and just as authentically lit, but here it’s the highest tiers of royalty being illuminated.\n\nThe early 1700s. An embattled Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is caught in a constitutional impasse. The Whigs are demanding decisive action in the war with France, while the Tories argue that the public tax needed to fund such an operation would finally tip the country into unrest. The decision rests on Anne’s shoulders, and this most petulant (and frankly, ill) Queen is clearly out of her depth.\n\nEnter disgraced socialite Abigail (Emma Stone), distant cousin of the Queen’s right-hand, Lady Sarah. Her family’s fall from grace sees her working as a servant girl, but if she can infiltrate the Queen’s inner circle by befriending Sarah (Rachel Weisz) she’ll have a laced shoe back on the ladder of nobility. Won’t she?\n\nColman has gained all the pre-release plaudits for her portrayal of a cantankerous, unhinged, depressed, child-like Queen, and she is magnificent. Such an overcharged, tragi-comic turn will inevitably be the film’s crown jewel. But Stone and Weisz are just as good, completing the core central trio. Stone’s character is wily, ever adapting to her own advantage, while Weisz excels with a performance of cold resilience. Both are continually trying to outwit each other’s lust for control. Mark Gatiss, Nicholas Hoult and The Thick of It’s own James Smith provide a supporting network of preening masculinity. The female triangle at the heart of the piece might harbour exceptionally dark streaks, but the men are equally duplicitous. It’s just that all of them are dolts too.\n\nLanthimos’ previous two films, The Lobster (2015) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), although set in the modern world, utilised weirdly unnatural dialogue patterns, which pushed both works into the realm of symbolic fable. Though that style is gone here, it’s just as eccentric a drama, but with a very different flavour. And if you consider all three movies together, that the historical piece uses the more natural speech could, itself, be taken as a comment on how surreal contemporary life seems to the director. After all, this screenplay is based in fact. How close it is to the genuine truth can never be known for sure. But it turns out that a surprising amount of this scandalous fancy could be closer than one might casually assume.\n\nThe lavish recreation of the palatial setting makes every frame an optical treat. Thanks to the occasional but regular use of a fish-eye lens, it’s as if we’re viewing life down the telescope of history, or as if in a specimen dish. It’s a neat touch that evokes art from the period, while also emphasising how distanced we now are from it.\n\nWith a sublimely simple but memorable parting shot that simultaneously encapsulates and tops the absurdity we’ve just witnessed, The Favourite will stand tall as a cinematic one-off. And one of the strangest accounts of British regal history. The current brexistential crisis crippling politics may be beyond satire. Perhaps it takes an anti-establishment farce as odd as this to peel back the layers and reveal the hysteria that the seductive lure of power can inspire.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★\n\n2018\n\nDir: Jon S. Baird\n\nComic Timing\n\nBiopics can be risky. The fame of the actor can itself become a barrier to accepting them as the subject. Thankfully, this is not a problem Stan & Ollie suffers from. It probably helps that we’ve not seen a great deal of behind-the-scenes footage of the ‘real’ Laurel and Hardy. Mainly, though, it’s because the performances feel so uncannily accurate. It’s certainly a tall order to do justice to icons of this magnitude. For both Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly, then, this is another fine success.\n\nCoogan, a masterly impressionist whose work has transcended his roots in vocal mimicry, plays Stan Laurel in satisfyingly subtle style. An expert in gestural micro-tics, it’s a nuanced depiction of the man, not a caricature of his stage persona. Meanwhile Reilly is a gift to the casting agent on account of his facial similarity to Hardy, not to mention his well-honed comedy chops. He’s used to operating in a double act, of course, performing alongside the gleefully juvenile Will Ferrell in multiple movie outings before. A prosthetic piling on of the pounds adds …er, enormously, but the sum of all these parts is that he disappears, quite remarkably, into the role.\n\nIt views like it’s really Coogan’s film though (it’s part-produced by his Baby Cow company, penned by the co-writer of their former hit Philomena, 2013). And this weighting works, because it feels like art mirroring life: the screenplay makes clear that it was Laurel who was the duo’s driving force, and endlessly creative with it. It is he who writes the material, comes up with the dialogue, and is ever-honing those lines to the point of obsession. Hardy (already an established comic actor by the time Hal Roach united them) was happy to fit in as Stan saw best.\n\nAfter a brief Way Out West-era prologue, we rejoin them in their later years, their heyday now way behind them. Touring the north of England, the threat of disappointing sales hangs over the entire run. It’s not long before the relationship is strained, and past grudges rear their head. So this is not a rip-roaring gag fest. It’s a touching, sweet portrayal of a personal bond that battled to survive the pressures of fading renown, exacerbated by the rigours of ageing.\n\nOne of the core pleasures is that it takes the time to spotlight the full extent of some of their routines, whether it be a dance, a song, or a silent sequence. It puts the breathless acceleration of today’s attention-deficit entertainment into sharp focus, offering the rare treasure of sitting back and luxuriating in the steady pace and purity of a vaudevillian turn.\n\nHistorical accuracy becomes the only question mark. It’s hard to believe that their celebrity status would have fallen to such a degree, even if their peak was over; they’re still sprinkling true Hollywood stardust over the music-hall backwaters of Britain. And while Coogan and Reilly are clearly younger than the duo were on that fateful tour, such pedantries don’t matter within such a loving tribute.\n\nIt just feels so refreshing to see something this out-and-out …nice. The script pulls at the heartstrings, and while it strays close to the line of oversentimentality, it doesn’t step over it. This richly drawn testimonial is sure to reignite (or spark) interest in arguably the greatest of our comedy heroes, and it somehow feels timely that we need that reminder right now. Their influence is impossible to measure, and this is an emotive memento of that gift. Feels like today’s world could do with a laugh. Especially one that is this innocent and uncomplicated. To be savoured.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★\n\n2018\n\nDir: Alfonso Cuarón\n\n(subtitled: Spanish, Mixteco)\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale\n\nAfter the stratospheric exhilarations of Gravity (2013), Alfonso Cuarón’s next feature-length mission could hardly be more down-to-earth. In fact it’s hard to think of something more diametrically opposed, confirming Cuarón as a director with remarkable breadth in two consecutive projects. By comparison, its set-up is small-scale, humble. And yet it might just hit you with the same universal impact.\n\nMexico City, the early seventies. We’re with a comfortably well-off family, the loosely unfolding tale revolving around their maid, Cleo, and how events in her personal life intertwine with theirs. She happily does their bidding, cooking for the children, tidying, clearing up dog crap from the drive. She’s their deferential helper, but more importantly, a true friend.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you is the cinematography. In crisp black and white, from the opening scenes and throughout, it forges a consistently beautiful image. Utilising a subject that could, on paper at least, seem workaday, in this style of high definition monochrome it’s so satisfying it occasionally seems to sparkle like silver. Slow tracking shots follow the performers, their organic movements always perfectly composed within an incrementally shifting frame.\n\nHeaded up by Yalitza Aparicio as Cleo, the acting is uniformly naturalistic and entirely convincing for it. In her first role, to lead a film with such subtlety is an amazing achievement. But it’s a wholly authentic ensemble around her, from the stressed matriarch (Marina de Tavira), to workmate Adela (Nancy Garcia), not to mention all four kids. The screenplay takes its time, slowly building up the characters and their interrelations, drawing you into engagement without you even really noticing.\n\nMale roles figure so little in terms of screen time as to be conspicuous for their absence. Their physical presence may be mostly off-stage, but how the women are forced to cope in the wake of their actions creates the core dramatic landscape. And modern masculinity is not reflected well. These are men who cannot handle their responsibilities, or even begin to face up to them. Selfish, immature, absconding.\n\nThe drama of the third act is all the more powerful for the unfussy way in which it unfolds, and the emotional investment that’s been carefully constructed in the viewer beforehand. Ultimately it’s a bittersweet story with deeply traumatic moments tempered by gold nuggets of kindness and truth. And as expressive and thoughtful as the morale is – that you have to hold onto the genuine love and care that you find in life, wherever that may be – it’s emphasised in the visual echoes that neatly bookend the film. A tempest of change has whirled through the family’s villa, but order might just be resetting. Perhaps. Roma is a visually exemplary, gently devastating tirade against domestic patriarchy, and a tribute to the caring strength of womanhood.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★\n\n2018\n\nDir: Luca Guadagnino\n\nThe Hex Factor\n\nWith the original representing the high watermark of the Italian ‘giallo’ style of horror movie, we might assume this 2018 update would slot straight into the ‘why even bother?’ file. Dario Argento’s 1977 Suspiria was a technicolour carousel of bad dreams, gory death theatrics and a thrillingly spooky soundtrack. The sum of those parts was an artful nightmare with the power to genuinely scare. So this remake from Call Me by Your Name (2017) director Luca Guadagnino is never going to match up, right? Well …it doesn’t. But. Why does it immediately feel lodged in the memory? And why do you sense it calling you back, almost as soon as the post-credits scene has rewarded those who stay to its dying minute?\n\nConstructed from the same screenplay as the original, it’s built upwards from the same foundations, but ends up with very different architecture. The dance studio setting in the first incarnation is actually little more than a suitably atmospheric, gothic backdrop, allowing the kaleidoscopic set pieces and whispers of occult suspicions to take centre-stage. This take’s considerably longer runtime gives time and space for the mechanics of the dancing itself to be explored, for one thing. Not to mention the extreme physical exertions they can lead to. Let’s just say we’re not dealing with the soft-focus ballerinas and ballrooms of Degas’ Paris.\n\nThat the film is going to be in the shadow of its forerunner is unavoidable, so that fact has been wholly embraced. Which begs the question of whether it’s best appreciated by those familiar with the earlier film, or those yet to be inducted into the scariest dance school in pop culture. Yet this is not a contemporary ‘reimagining’ (à la Dawn of the Dead (2004), or even Ghostbusters (2016). It’s still set in ‘77 for a start. So it feels like an expansion, a second run at one of cinema’s most cultish chillers.\n\nWe follow Susie Banyon’s initiation into the school, and Dakota Johnson presents both her youthful purity, and a charismatic authority as she matures into finding her place within it. Tutor Tilda Swinton’s terse otherworldliness fits perfectly. Meanwhile the sole male character, psychiatrist Josef Klemperer, is portrayed by Lutz Ebersdorf. Who turns out to be one of the most enigmatic of actors…\n\nStaying true to the spirit, music is still a key ingredient in this fresh concoction, and Thom Yorke’s off-kilter piano laments complement the adult fairy-tale vibe to a tee. It’s at the opposite end of the audio spectrum as Goblin’s voodoo nursery rhymes on acid, but just as memorable.\n\nAt two and a half hours, it’s certainly overlong, spending too much time on character back-story and creepy cul-de-sacs. The sensual and highly aesthetic seventies version is, in essence, a string of elaborate, operatic murder sequences. This deeper reading of the story, and the expanded content that goes with it, simply requires a larger package. And it’s here I wonder if new viewers may tire.\n\nBut it’s a validatory blessing to see the original’s lead (Jessica Harper) return in the later stages. And, despite my reservations, I can’t shake a feeling that I myself will be revisiting it in the not too distant future. It’s hard to put my finger on why. Almost as if some sort of spell has been cast upon me in the last couple of hours.\n\n★ ★ ★ ½\n\n2018\n\nDir: Steve McQueen\n\nThe Art of the Steal\n\nWith his origins in the contemporary art of video installation, Turner prize-winning Steve McQueen’s gradual transition to popular cinema has brought with it an additional layer of artistic weight. While that implies a certain foregone prestige in his films, it also has the potential to repress their mass appeal.\n\nThe brilliant, brutal, and harrowing Hunger (2008) and Shame (2011) were followed by the more epic and emotional gut punch of 12 Years a Slave (2013), swiping him the best picture Oscar along the way. Now he turns to out-and-out crime thriller, and his most populist project yet: adapting a Lynda La Plante-penned ITV mini-series from the early eighties. McQueen’s treatment transplants the London-based kernel of the idea to the mean streets of Chicago, reimagining pretty much everything else around it, from the corrupt ground up.\n\nImmediately, we’re bundled into the back of a speeding getaway truck while chasing police cars and a trail of destruction follow in point-of-view perspective with heart-stopping realism. It’s a breathless opening gambit that demands mandatory attention, locking you into the plot from the starting shot. But this botched job turns out to be the gang’s last, and we’re soon standing with their Widows at the funerals of their dear departed husbands.\n\nWhen the political candidate for local Alderman comes knocking (Brian Tyree Henry), demanding the campaign funds that were stolen, Veronica Rawlings (Viola Davis) swiftly realises she’s only got one possible course of action to get that sort of money within two weeks. Going through her deceased husband’s effects, she just happens to have discovered his meticulous plans for the next hit.\n\nThe story that follows is so leanly executed; every single line advances the plot forwards, framed by cinematography that supplies added nuance. Its twists and reveals are disclosed organically, without the overdone crescendos of Hollywood theatrics. Every character, in some way, is crooked, be it the doomed thieves, the bereaved anti-heroines, the politicos vying for control of the precinct, or the ‘associates’ they use when they need to apply a little ‘pressure’. And yet, you totally understand, even sympathise with, the motivations of everyone. Because, to paraphrase Hunter S. Thompson, in a society where everybody’s guilty, the only crime is getting caught. As well as being completely engaged in the drama, you can always sense the director’s aesthetic eye. Any stretching of plausibility remains convincing throughout, all presented with McQueen’s visual finesse. And that is a three-way balance that could be the holy grail of cinematic fiction.\n\nThe extended ensemble cast is so strong and impeccably chosen that it feels unfair to highlight any one individual. But Viola Davis is the damaged heart of the piece, stringently getting through both her grief, and her new identity as gang leader, in (and after) her husband’s wake. Daniel Kaluuya’s icily menacing turn will be hard to erase from the memory, while it’s so satisfying to see Liam Neeson capitalise on his late-career hardman schtick in a film with substance and credibility.\n\nA bold tale of women forcibly wrestling the gritty crime thriller out of the men’s cold dead hands could even be said to chime with the #TimesUp movement burning through Tinseltown. This is a truly riveting and supremely accomplished heist movie for our times, which has the dextrousness to reward the viewer with something as delicate as a smile. Once it’s done some time, this exemplary work may prove to be the artist McQueen’s popular masterpiece.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\n2018\n\nDir: Donovan Marsh\n\nSub Standard\n\nThey say films reflect the times in which they’re produced. So no wonder I’ve just sat through a violent, militaristic prepostero-fantasy about the brink of World War 3, headed up by an arrogant lunkhead.\n\nBut the abject childishness of the plot allows Hunter Killer to hedge its bets in terms of laying blame. Yes, it concerns an unprovoked attack by Soviet forces, but don’t worry, it’s a rogue Defence Secretary who’s gone doolally. Therefore, the manly, wholesome (and let’s be honest, downright dishy) Russian President can remain blameless. So he’s free to be rescued like the despot-in-distress he is, by the eternal saviours of the planet …the USA. Specifically, Gerard Butler. Aaah, Mister Gerard “I’ll get you” Butler… how gleefully reliable you’ve become in pumping out this soggy indoctri-tainment (please see further exhibits Geostorm, London Has Fallen…).\n\nWe first catch up with Gentleman Butler hunting deer with a bow and arrow in the Scottish highlands. He’s literally a hunter killer …do you see? Ah, we think, the Scot’s finally playing true to his Celtic roots. But no, the army copter soon scrapes him off the slopes, direct to the sub’s control room, and he’s barking his faux Yankee growl to those unfortunate enough to be trapped in such a confined space with him. Oh, and he couldn’t shoot that stag by the way… the beast’s offspring wandered into view, Butler caught sight of Bambi’s eyes, and he couldn’t slay his dad in cold blood, could he? He’s a hunter killer, but with a sensitive soul …DO YOU SEE?\n\nSo, after some deep-sea drivel involving a missile strike on a Soviet sub turning out to be a hoax in order to justify the first throes of nuclear war, in heaves Butler in his phallic DSV, flipping his lucky coin as he goes. Meanwhile Gary Oldman is back on dry land, strutting and fretting his way around the US Military Command Centre, jettisoning all the cred he earned with this film’s polar opposite, Darkest Hour (2017), in one foul-accented swoop.\n\nTalking of accents, this is a world in which the Russians speak English when discussing something pertinent to the story, but when they need to sound menacing, they gabble away in their native tongue. Ooh they’re speaking foreign, it must be terrifying. Hang on, here comes a plot point, better switch to English… The visuals call on perfectly passable CGI, it’s true, but there’s only so much you need to do with a sub tootling along the seabed, all covert like, and the odd torpedo. When it calls for sweeping shots of the full naval arsenal, stock military footage saves the day.\n\nThe macho war games that follow all feel hopelessly naff and dated, to the point where you can’t really tell if it’s some sort of tongue-in-cheek homage to Stallone and Schwarzenegger’s long-gone heyday. But such knowing subtlety is surely bobbing on the surface far above this sub-par sub plot. And yet. It does propel along at the required rate of knots to stave off any boredom, ensuring the audience’s entertainment is kept afloat. Just. And perhaps not quite as intended.\n\nThen the credits turn with a tribute to the late Michael Nyqvist. The Swedish actor has passed at a shockingly young 56. His roles are a key reason why the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy (2009) and John Wick (2014) are such solid, creditable thrillers. Here, he’s the Russian Captain with a heart; the one who understands the truth, i.e. the Americans are always right. There’s even a hauntingly apposite shot where he bids farewell to Captain Butler with a handshake, the hint of a halo glowing behind his head, thanks to the sun breaking through the distant cloud. It’s a conspicuously eerie, yet heartening coincidence. But it feels damned unjust that such an accomplished actor should end up going down with something as far beneath him as this. R.I.P. Michael Nyqvist.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Killer will dive straight to the bottom of the digital bargain bin. And stay lurking in the depths.\n\n★ ★\n\n2017\n\nDir: Daniel Kokotajlo\n\nWitness Statement\n\nIt may not sound like the most inviting proposition; bearing witness to the damage religion can do to a family’s interpersonal relationships. But in the hands of debut writer-director Daniel Kokotajlo, it’s a gripping and powerful experience. Because this film’s targets prove to be broader than the beliefs of just one faith.\n\nMolly Wright plays Alex, a teenage Jehovah’s Witness, whose life was saved, as a baby, by blood transfusion. Such tampering with the sanctity of the lifeblood being against their teachings, she’s now made it clear on her medical record that any such ‘meddling’ is utterly forbidden. Regardless of how desperately it might be needed. And such devout devotion makes her mum Ivanna (Siobhan Finneran) very, very proud.\n\nIvanna is prouder still when Alex is willing to couple up with Steven (Robert Emms), the brand new ‘elder’ at their church (actually a young and thoroughly decent type). Meantime, older sister Luisa (Sacha Parkinson) is getting tempted down a quite different path. As she matures into her late teens, and the uncharted territory of higher education, she’s starting to mix with boys from the outside world …with ruinous results.\n\nAs the impact of her actions reverberates through household and church, despite the subject matter, it’s never an oppressive watch. The movie gathers a quiet power, and one that continues to grow after viewing. The decision to follow the point of view of one character in the opening act is devastatingly effective, all the more hard-hitting when the plot casts us adrift from those moorings. Thereafter we’re uncomfortable in Luisa’s company; she’s an outsider expelled for the sin of fornication, after all. Conversely, mother Ivanna simply doesn’t let anyone in through her impenetrable defences. So we’re forced to coldly observe her unwavering adherence to her principles from afar, even as it, slowly but surely, rips her family apart.\n\nSiobhan Finneran’s maternal turn is quite brilliant; one of unfathomably steely resolve, even as her own unshakeable mindset destroys all she holds dear. The tones this coruscating drama is painted in are all dull browns and dirty yellows: a drabness reflecting a refusal to enjoy the colours of life, forever waiting instead for the lush paradise that is sure to come …later. Always later.\n\nOn the surface, of course, this is an examination of the potential harm of the strictures of the Jehovah’s Witness denomination. But wider, more importantly, it exposes the painful truth that any belief system can repress those who choose to follow it. And to a greater or lesser extent, we’re all victims of that. Religious or not, we carry around our little sureties, keeping ‘safe’ in the familiar, unconsciously choosing to stay blinkered, closed to the fresh possibilities of new experience.\n\nThis assured first feature might not deliver the stirring climax we feel we’ve been promised (arguably mirroring the subject), but its residual force is unmistakably benevolent. It may or may not be intended as a shaming of a specific church, and a statement during the credits confirms that it’s not been approved by the official body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It’s obviously no surprise they’re not willing to undergo their own Apostasy to consider this heartfelt parable. But every single soul does have the choice to be open to its humane lesson. Or not.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★\n\n2018\n\nDir: Ari Aster\n\nCurse of the Mummy\n\nThere’s much to admire in this full-blooded frightener from production-company-of-the-moment A24. But also, an equal amount that frustrates. We leave the cinema at the witching hour with the feeling that there is a great film in there, but buried deep within heavy-handed styling and tropes that feel derivative. On the plus side, it is admirably extreme for a multiplex horror boasting A-listers like Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne. But whatever happened to the grace granted by a touch of subtlety?\n\nWe join the dysfunctional Graham family at the funeral of their matriarch Ellen Leigh. It’s soon obvious there was little love lost between the deceased and her daughter Annie (Collette), who opens her heart in a stilted eulogy to the mourners, bemoaning her mother’s obstinate privacy and self-isolation in life. Annie, a successful artist working in miniature models, reveals the full painful story of their strained relationship when she joins a grief-counselling workshop. Although it’s excruciatingly awkward for her to attend, it does bring some solace, especially when she’s befriended by Joan (Ann Dowd), a kindly middle-aged widow trying to come to terms with her own recent loss.\n\nAs the layers of the plot peel back, we descend into territory fielded by Suspiria (1977), Drag Me to Hell (2009) and Rosemary’s Baby (1968)… fertile ground indeed for extracting genuine spookiness from modern-day circumstance. It’s handsomely shot, and forges a characteristic style, with inventive angles and panning shots, while sharp jump cuts imply the presence of something malign. It even manages to pull off a resolutely Hitchcockian shock, one that virtually no-one has dared go near since Hitch made it his own. Perhaps it’s the reason the marketeers dared to reference his masterpiece on the poster.\n\nIncremental unease is successfully summoned with gradual pace and claustrophobic settings. But once we get to the obligatory séance scene, it’s apparent we’re dealing in a language of the exceptionally overt. And then some. Everything is hammered home, underestimating the audience’s intelligence, making sure that everyone is QUITE CLEAR what horror is afoot. Neatly laid out clues are so heavily signposted that any twist loses impact, and the fact that it concerns the paranormal is made head-spinningly obvious by choosing to visibly depict the evil ‘spirit’ on screen. Did the director not have enough faith in the acting alone?\n\nAnnie is endlessly tinkering with the intricate models that are her living, which also help her deal with the stress of all this hocus-pocus. Accordingly, the opening shot zooms into one such model to suggest we’re at a different scale. It promises a playing with levels of reality …rich potential for psychological sideswiping. And it’s backed up by strong hints that you can’t trust what you’re seeing throughout; Annie comes round from multiple post-traumatic nightmares. But all this heavy suggestion leads …nowhere. While effectively unnerving in themselves, these dead ends and non sequiturs ultimately feel like empty options left open for a choice of possible endings.\n\nBut the selected finale does turn out to be memorably intense, and, with a 15 certificate, it definitely has the power to disturb those fresh to the pastures of shock cinema. An enjoyably grisly occult horror it can certainly claim to be, but not the terror classic its PR campaign would have us believe. Hereditary curses itself by conjuring so much potential, but then failing to make good on the promise. Mainly through understatement being sacrificed on the altar of populism, and the roots of its cinematic family tree being so explicit.\n\n★ ★ ★ ½\n\n2018\n\nDir: Debra Granik\n\nThe Running Man\n\nBen Foster has been consistently delivering stand-out performances since his memorably psychotic turn in 2006’s Alpha Dog. His was the performance that made that Justin-Timberlake-is-an-actor manifesto so enjoyable. Such was the undiluted strength of his display, he’s become rather typecast as the unhinged villain, see recent examples Hell or High Water (2016) and Hostiles (2017). It’s inevitable, maybe. He certainly nails ‘restrained intensity’ like few others. Thus he’s to be found upholding and grounding the lead, but rarely filling the central slot himself. Indeed, when he did take the helm, in the overlooked Lance Armstrong exposé The Program (2015), it was as someone universally regarded as villainous.\n\nSo it might be his established position in the supporting role, or, risking rudeness, perhaps he doesn’t exude the flawless looks of the true screen idol. Whatever the reason, his isn’t a star name, so it’s not trumpeted on the advertising for the latest venture to boast his talent; Leave No Trace.\n\nThis slice of home-grown American art house is far from a one-man show though, it’s a beautifully balanced and sparse two-hander. Young Thomasin McKenzie is the real revelation, and, together, they assert an affecting father-daughter bond. Will and Tom live in the woods, coping with the rigours of outdoor living just fine, happy in each others’ company. They’re actively satisfied by its physical demands, and play chess for mental nutrition in any downtime they get. Yet they’re always on edge …on the run from something. Inevitably, when the authorities do catch up with them, they’re housed in a project for those scraping by on the edge of society. Organised by a kindly benefactor, it even provides gainful employment; harvesting pine trees for Christmas. It’s a fresh start, they’re making a go of it, but can such a restless spirit as Will ever settle for the settled life?\n\nThis film has genuine elemental power. It has the confidence to take its time, unhurriedly laying out the sights and the sounds of the wild. And before long, you’re connecting with the pleasure of being in nature, of being amongst animals, of just being. Yet Will is forever hunted and haunted by something ever closing in, that restrained intensity of Foster’s being utilised to beautiful effect.\n\nFrom such a simple set-up, this is a highly thought-provoking work, and for two reasons. On the surface, it reveals the lack of support for those caught in the aftermath of Will’s plight. Simultaneously, it raises pertinent questions of how hard it is to escape the trappings of modernity, so entwined are we in technology. We’re venturing into a dark place to consider the impossibility of achieving such freedom from the digital world. Even if it’s beginning to appeal more than many of us would comfortably admit.\n\nHandsomely shot and minimally eloquent, the tone explores the uncharted hinterland between pastoral reverie and chase thriller. Will is a caring, pure soul, burning from an internal rage, but understanding the danger (and futility) of expressing it, choosing to absorb his suffering for the greater good. Regardless of the self-inflicted damage. And irrevocably tied to him, McKenzie reflects Tom’s predicament with heartfelt love, keen maturity, and an expertly honed quiver of the chin.\n\nWith slow, easy pace, depth and subtlety, this is a deeply rewarding, articulate and powerful movie. It manages to express a vast reserve of emotion with the simplest of stories, and gentle, modest execution. To do so feels a little like the film-makers have tracked and snared their own cinematic holy grail.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★ ½\n\n2018\n\nDir: Ken Nishikawa\n\n(subtitled: Japanese, English)\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha\n\nForget the 2005 Japanesque Hollywood epic that’s inevitably donated its name for the subheading above… This film, literally, is the memoirs of a geisha. A true geisha. Told by one of the last surviving doyennes of that most veiled of professions. And behind that veil, at a spritely eighty years old, Matsuchiyo makes for intriguing company.\n\nShe relates a story of stoic devotion, hardship and heartbreak, one that would exert great strain on the raising of her young family. Not least on her eldest son, a child sometimes shouldering the burden of responsibility as the senior male of the close-knit unit. Director-narrator Nishikawa could not be better placed to tell her story, because he is that son.\n\nMatsuchiyo – Life of a Geisha explores possibly the greatest enigma of the Far East. Alongside “samurai” and “sushi”, words like “geisha” export an idea of traditional Japanese heritage to the wider world. Yet the term is so little understood in the West. And as the occupation gradually dies out, its secrets may be left to scatter in the wind.\n\nThrough direct interviews, Matsuchiyo recalls narrow escape from Soviet forces during the war, herself and her mother the family’s sole survivors. Joining an agency in order to support them, she matured into one of the most renowned geisha in Atami, an idyllic coastal resort buoyed by the post-war economic boom. We learn of her relationships, both professional and otherwise, and how the line between the two gets blurred. Often with deeply painful results. Now, entering her ninth decade, she reflects with wisdom, fortitude, appreciation, and not a little amusement. Her reminiscences are accompanied by elegant, nostalgic photography, and a strangely compelling, almost eerie soundtrack. Nishikawa’s precise English narration mixes with the flow of his mother’s subtitled speech, his admiration and respect for his parent clear, without ever overwhelming.\n\nIt’s a tale that deserves to be elicited and told, for the way of the geisha would never be boastful. Geisha have always maintained an essence of privacy and mystery. Discretion is, naturally, at the heart of the role. The film engages the viewer by uncovering the impact this has had on one of its most devoted practitioners, and also on the film-maker himself. But it also manages to retain that sense of demure subtlety. The result is an affecting revelation of a beguiling, and now declining, artistry. As a documentary, it has a lingering, haunting poignancy. It’s also a touching tribute from a loving son, a disclosure from a bygone age, which may yet prove to become a valuable historical document.\n\n★ ★ ★\n\n2017\n\nDir: Michael Pearce\n\nPrimal Suspect\n\nBeast’s primary triumph is that it’s so impressive for a debut. Writer-director Pearce carves a singular niche with a spirit of originality that keeps you gripped to a potent climax. It all feels quite remarkable for a first feature.\n\nWe meet Moll (Jessie Buckley) at her birthday party, a cucumber sandwiches-type affair in her parents back garden, somewhere on the island of Jersey. And even though it’s her big day, she’s rather upstaged. Her little sis, with boyfriend at her side, chooses to overshadow proceedings by announcing their engagement and wallowing in the guests’ congratulations. Moll lurks out of the limelight, preferring a conversation about the cruelty of attractions like SeaWorld keeping killer whales in captivity.\n\nEventually she’s had enough, and flees unseen to the nearest nightclub, determined to abandon herself to whatever the night may bring. Which turns out to be a run-in with rough-hewn local loner, Pascal Renouf (Johnny Flynn). He’s a Jerseyman through-and-through, his name instantly relaying that he’s something of an outsider, something different. And with a touch of the primitive about him, Moll cannot deny her impulse, her head no doubt fighting where her heart is leading her. For such a dalliance goes entirely against her middle-class upbringing, an upbringing epitomised by the imposing figure of Geraldine James in the role of her mother.\n\nThe grim backdrop to this unfolding attraction of opposites is the drip feed of news that young girls are going missing in the area. In the closed environment of the island setting, with very little evidence to go on, the police have slim pickings by way of suspects. And as questionable episodes in Renouf’s past begin to rear their head, could Moll’s new-found lover even be a suspect himself? Even if he is, is it too late? Is she in too deep?\n\nThe physical confines of the set-up are crucial to the impending tone of this bitter and brooding photo-romance. It exists in a world cut off from the mainland …and the mainstream. Moll is trapped as much by her family unit as by geography, feeling the pull of something beyond both. As relative newcomers, the two leads inject a freshness that’s invigorating. Buckley carries the film, nailing the angst of a young adult on the cusp of full maturity. Meanwhile Flynn is raw, sweaty masculinity personified, a contemporary echo of Oak from Hardy’s Far From The Madding Crowd. The couple’s tenderness contrasts with the stalwart experience of James, an actor exuding an unsettlingly masculine menace. Underplayed at every turn, her strict politeness is charged with the kinetic potential to truly terrify. Indeed, with more than one contender, the true target of the film’s title remains satisfyingly vague.\n\nIn the opening sequence, Moll plucks a single unruly hair from her neck, pulling it out at the root. By the end it’s grown back, demanding removal once more. It’s a sublimely simple symbol for this wild tale of the prim versus the primeval. It’s not a crime thriller, it’s not a horror, it’s a romantic fiction concocted from ingredients of both. The result is as dark and eerie a love story as you’ll see.\n\nBeing trapped within the boundaries of suburbia is a childhood frustration buried deep in many of us. Beast pulls us in by tapping into this, then daring to confront questions that feel dangerously close to the knuckle. Through a twisting and unpredictable exploration of heartfelt passion, its primal power is to ask what each of us is willing to accept when such boundaries are absolved by the blinding effect of ‘love’.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★\n\n2017\n\nDir: Jeremy Dyson, Andy Nyman\n\nTales from the Triptych\n\nCase 1: History\n\nThe tiny sub-genre of the anthology or ‘portmanteau’ horror enjoys a unique status in the story of British film. Adored by its aficionados …but never taken seriously. Looked down upon, even. How could a compilation of short, separate stories amount to any cinematic significance? Its roots stretch back to a diversion taken by Ealing Studios at the end of World War 2, away from its established comedy fare, and down a much darker avenue with the brilliant, pulse-quickening quartet Dead of Night (1945). But the form was to peak much later, in the seventies, on the tail end of the Brit-horror boom heralded by Hammer. It was a cheerfully cheap and schlocky way to cram in more star names, and promise more thrills. And maybe to allow a few more risks with some decidedly dodgy set-ups. ‘Hey! If you don’t like this story, there’ll be another one along in a minute!’ was the underlying fail-safe. But it was Hammer’s rival Amicus Studios who made it their own, with a gaudier, seedier, more modern take on the tired gothic styling of their precursor. Though perhaps more dated to today’s eyes, theirs are the remembered classics of the genre, mixing chills with tongue-in-cheek daftness, topped with such wonderfully trashy titles as The House that Dripped Blood (1971) and From Beyond the Grave (1974).\n\nCase 2: Premise\n\nPhilip Goodman (Andy Nyman) is a psychology professor, dedicated to debunking and exposing charlatan psychics. Notably, it’s a recurring theme explored by Nyman’s long-time collaborator Derren Brown (who offers his own seal of approval with a minute vocal cameo). Goodman infiltrates these fraudsters’ shows and exposes their fakery, in front of their own audiences for maximum impact. It’s his life’s obsession to prove that the supernatural simply does not, cannot exist. And that anyone who purports to be in touch with ‘the other side’ is exploiting the fears, moreover the finances, of the vulnerable. But then a former idol of his, a man long disappeared and presumed dead, gets in touch. A legend of the sceptic field, he’s alive and well after all, and he has something urgent to impart. He demands Goodman research three cases he could never solve, three cases that shook his certainty to the core. “Investigate these, and then tell me the paranormal doesn’t exist…” And so, with his unshakeable confidence assured, Goodman visits the ‘survivors’ of these strange phenomena. Paul Whitehouse is The Nightwatchman, a man traumatised by things that literally went bump in the night in his warehouse. Alex Lawther is the desperately anxious new driver who decided to take a shortcut home through the woods one night. And finally, we meet businessman Martin Freeman, who was left, when his wife died during childbirth, bringing up baby on his …own? It’s fair to say that none of these episodes have a happy ending.\n\nCase 3: Conclusion\n\nA resurrection of Nyman and Dyson’s highly inventive theatre production from a few years back, Ghost Stories is revived into the most refreshingly original British horror flick for some time. Its triumph is to revisit the largely forgotten sub-culture of the portmanteau, paying tribute to the format, but delivering much more than a straight compendium assortment. Each individual tale enjoyably satisfies the popcorn jumps and scares expected by the contemporary audience, doubtless making a few millennials splutter on their over-elaborate movie-house snacks. But the way it unites all three strands is an inspired thesis that goes beyond the familiar tropes of shock cinema, into territory that has the power to genuinely unsettle. Despite being presented within a rollicking fun-filled package, which it most certainly is, it also taps into fears that could lie dormant in a great number of us.\n\nForget the actual ‘ghosts’ within the stories of this spooky selection box, for you might find a spirit lurking deeper within that haunts you long after the mischief is concluded and the credits have rolled. Ace.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★ ½\n\n2017\n\nDir: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nHis Dark Material\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis has announced he’s to depart the fashion house of film after one final turn with former collaborator Paul Thomas Anderson. Such a reunion brings to mind the mercurial results of their previous pairing; the contemporary classic There Will Be Blood (2007). Writer-director Anderson has returned to the fold of lead actors before. Maybe he finds his muse in the familiar. This particular outfit sees Day-Lewis’ character the one in search of the muse’s inspiration. (Indeed we witness the expulsion of an earlier failed ‘candidate’, one who didn’t quite …er, measure up, in the opening reel.)\n\nReynolds Woodcock is one of the most renowned haute couture dressmakers in all of fifties London. In the world. He’s revered, worshipped, spending every waking hour conceiving and overseeing the manufacture of the finest bespoke garments. His gowns are sought by the highest in society. By landed gentry, by royalty even. The pressures of such high esteem require the letting off of steam, naturally, and on one of his recuperative trips to the coast, he’s beguiled with the nervous waitress clumsily serving his cream tea. Taking her under his wing, yet keeping her awkwardly distant, their relationship remains stiltedly …vague. Is he infatuated with Alma (Vicky Krieps) herself, or just her potential as a model? Could she be the perfect living mannequin to exhibit his unique creations, yet nothing more?\n\nAlma moves into his London townhouse in fashionable Fitzrovia. It’s just the two of them. Well, the two of them and his legion of house staff. And ranks of seamstresses. All of whom are under the domineering shadow of Reynolds’ big sis, Cyril; a magnificently precise performance of clipped pedantry from Lesley Manville. Seeing beyond the facade of his fearsome reputation, Alma falls under his spell, but is soon getting snagged on his exactitude, his intolerance, his… control. She’s desperate to get close to the real man, but kept at bay by a shield of constant work, and his overprotective sentinel of a sister. Feeling hopelessly hemmed in, she decides to take matters into her own, laced hands.\n\nThis is a multi-layered, finely trimmed creation of needle-sharp accuracy that hooks you in with exceptional elegance. As meticulous as one of Woodcock’s patterns, it’s a beautifully judged knitting together of acting craft and visual flair, with a plush piano refrain running through the seams. Sublime symmetry self-consciously pleases the eye, most thrillingly in several unnervingly kinetic motor car jaunts. The tale gathers into a statuesque drama where the plot must be gently teased out, before it slowly, inevitably, begins to unravel. The lead role is a tyrant again, no doubt, but one cut from a different cloth to There Will Be Blood’s overblown oilman Daniel Plainview. Buttoned-up, waspish, broiling away beneath the grace, he always seems one dropped stitch away from the ridiculous.\n\nBut the subtlety of Anderson’s work pays dividends most on retrospection. Multiple weaves are embedded in this yarn once you begin to pick at it… The psychological shortcomings in those blessed with ‘brilliance’. What it takes to prick the ego of the inspired in an attempt to get close. That some relationships might only work in ‘dysfunctional’ style. And who’s to judge what is dysfunctional if it works for both partners? Not every love story can be tailor-made to fit perfectly, after all.\n\nAn exposé of male exploitation? Of the human cost so often found behind great art? A paean to the power of the muse? A swansong to Day-Lewis? Some form of veiled apology? Phantom Thread even dares to question if deliberate harm could offer benefit to those craving some sort of ‘healing’. This refined, enigmatic, and finessed delight, skirting such dark strands, pondering the deeper creases of life’s fabric, proves to be thoroughly gratifying, and uncommonly thought provoking. A made-to-measure way for such a consummate actor to bow out. Before he hears, for the final time perhaps, “cut”.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★ ½\n\n2018\n\nDir: Steve M. Kelly\n\nTeenage Kicks\n\nThe Bromley Boys lovingly transports us back to the tatty football terrace of our youth, rekindling that first flush of infatuation with the beautiful game. Recounting the true teenage years of author Dave Roberts (with a sprinkling of rumour, perhaps), we follow his encounters with his local lower leagues, igniting the passion that fuels his writing to this very day.\n\nTransferring from Game of Thrones to the game of throw-ins, rising star Brenock O’Connor plays up-front in the lead, while Alan Davies narrates from Roberts’ present day perspective. Davies doubles up to portray his cantankerous father too, who wants him to have nothing to do with such a pointless waste of time. So it kicks off with young Dave trooping down “to cubs”, a secret charade he shares with Mum (Martine McCutcheon in affectionately maternal mode), allowing him to get to Hayes Lane to cheer on the local lads whenever he can.\n\nThe only problem is that the boys of Bromley FC are “the worst football team in Britain”. Seeing them suffer crushing defeat after crushing defeat, he instigates a one-man campaign to oust manager Dick Ellis. He sets about cornering the chairman, unprepared for the attractive lure of his bookish, soccer-shunning daughter. When he’s presented with the opportunity, he can’t resist a snoop through the boss’s desk. What he uncovers shocks him to the spurs. With the very future of the club threatened, someone must act. He might be only fifteen, but he is certain only one person can be their saviour. It’s his destiny.\n\nThis joyful and nostalgic sports comedy hazily recalls a time when the game, in fact life, seemed so much simpler. Its charm is in revisiting a rose-tinted era of chopper bikes and school discos; a time of only three TV channels, when Saturday could only mean the game of two halves.\n\nThe casting of Davies and McCutcheon fields a back line of homespun familiarity, but the film belongs to O’Connor. He expertly tackles the right balance of youthful innocence and the fire that burns in the juvenile heart when you know you’re right, but no one else can see it. His supporting squad is an ensemble of recognisable comedy faces. Jamie Foreman is in imperious form as the cartoonish barrow-boy boss, with Gareth Hale their luckless manager. And, led by The Office’s Ewen MacIntosh, Dave’s tiny band of allies almost echoes The Three Stooges with their goonish asides.\n\nThe Bromley Boys comes across a little like the tale of hapless supporter ‘Golden Gordon’ from Michael Palin’s Ripping Yarns re-imagined by Richard Curtis. It is as much a bittersweet paean to adolescence as the devotion inspired by even the lowest rungs of the national game. And with its broad and gently humorous tone, it’ll appeal far wider than your dyed-in-the-wool footie fan. For anyone who has suffered the unrequited love of sticking by your hopeless team through thick, but mostly thin… all the pain, passion and rare unmitigated joy is in here. For anyone else it scores a sweetly uplifting ninety minutes (a pause for oranges halfway through optional) on a Saturday afternoon.\n\n★ ★ ★ ½\n\n2017\n\nDir: Amit Gupta\n\nSex Tape and the City\n\nYou’ll be familiar with the traditional rom-com set-up. You know the one: Boy seeks girl. Boy meets girl. Boy has to explain that a sex tape from his previous relationship went viral, wrecking his career and bringing him instant notoriety…\n\nAmit Gupta’s third feature injects contemporary freshness into the conventions of the romantic comedy, and sends its own cinematic valentine to the enduring visual allure of London. In fact, ‘London Town’ is the name of the fictional TV soap that introduced actor Jay (Ray Panthaki) to celebrity. He used to welcome being stopped in the street with requests for a selfie. But then he did One Crazy Thing; film himself and his girlfriend in the throes of passion. To the strains of Omar’s 90s pop-soul classic ‘There’s Nothing Like This’.\n\nWhen their relationship went south of the river, his ex vengefully posted the X-rated mini-masterpiece online. He’s lost his soaperstar status, and cast shame on his family. He’s still recognised in the street of course, but for entirely the wrong kind of ‘exposure’. Out of work, out of luck, he’s trying to find the role that’ll restore his credibility. And then he meets Hannah. An American student who hates the Internet’s privacy-destroying ways, she’s clueless to his infamy. But once he realises he’d love things to get serious, just how des he ‘fess up his dirty little secret?\n\nDespite the potential weight of such timely topics as revenge porn and public shaming, the breezy and gentle One Crazy Thing is a thoroughly sweet movie. Its success rests largely on the shoulders of Panthaki, whose company we’re in for most of the runtime. Witty, self-deprecating, emotionally resonant, he proves an exceptionally likeable lead. Daisy Bevan deftly plays the wide-eyed stranger in town with light-hearted innocence. They interact with heartening chemistry, and are supported by a strong cast. The versatile Dan ‘Angelos Epithemiou’ Skinner puts in a great turn as foul-mouthed Welsh lad Charlie, Jay’s best mate. He crassly shoots down his friend’s thespian self-absorption, while David Bamber enjoyably tuts and frets his way through the frustrations of the theatrical agent.\n\nBut the third personality in the central love triangle is London itself, as inviting and iconic as ever in some beautifully shot frames: the South Bank at dusk, the squares and walkways of Fitzrovia and Soho. We linger in a guitar shop in Denmark Street, once the musical heart of the city, now under constant threat of the property developers’ bulldozer. We may not be able to do such a romantic thing for too much longer.\n\nYou’ll pick up flirtations with the films of Richard Curtis and Gurinder Chadha in this endearing tale of the pitfalls of modern matchmaking, and the impact of relating in the digital age. But with its effervescent and wry tone, it refreshingly makes light of the challenges brought by the transparency of the online future. With this overriding positive outlook, One Crazy Thing is an affectionate photo-romance, well suited to our times.\n\n★ ★ ★ ½\n\n2017\n\nDir: Scott Cooper\n\nBale Rider\n\nThe post-Unforgiven (1992) era of westerns could be summed up by pointing to their decrease in quantity being more than compensated for by their increase in quality. Somehow it could only have been Clint Eastwood who did what he did with that milestone movie. Here was the icon of the sixties spaghetti six-shooter, now firing behind the camera too, shifting focus beyond the typical surface iconography, to much deeper, human drama. In turn it rejuvenated an entire, seemingly exhausted genre.\n\nThe simplistic convention of cowboys battling injuns was dated, shallow and overdone. Ever since, the western has sat more comfortably alongside the period piece: a more authentic depiction that just happens to be set against such a cinematic and enigmatic backdrop. That backdrop, in its historical context, is the U.S. parallel to the British Victorian gothic. Both mark the advancing technological strides in the final years of the 19th century. The first wave of steam locomotion was on the cusp of transforming the American plains on the tracks to modernity.\n\nChristian Bale’s casting serves as a stamp of integrity all by itself. With a back catalogue as credible as his, his position in the lead is a statement of gritty intent. His well-documented tendency for a short temper, in actuality, doesn’t do anything but add to the required ruthlessness of the character. So he feels perfectly chosen as Captain Blocker; the hard-bitten, right-thinking army captain, bearing the scars of battling a most brutal enemy for the whole of his adult life. On the verge of hanging up his uniform, he’s given one last order. One that every fibre of his being wants to defy.\n\nHe’s to transport an ageing native chief (Wes Studi), long captive of the army, across country so he can face his final days in his homeland, surrounded by his own people. Blocker assembles a band of militia to guard the chief and his family, and heads the entourage out into lawless territory. They soon encounter a young mother (Rosamund Pike), in the grip of grief after suffering unbearable loss to rampaging thieves. The reserved tenderness with which Blocker takes her into his care elaborates to become the pulse of the film. Pike’s numbed-by-shock performance is sweetly affecting as the Captain gently chips away at her defences.\n\nOccasional bursts of visceral violence are all the more powerful for their scarcity, but this is largely a plaintive trip across the nostalgia of the wild west, and into the power to be found in reaching across divisions, in finding strength in unity. Its themes are delicately emphasised by a statuesque and contemplative score from Max Richter, and every one of a fine supporting cast is fully rounded enough to engage your care. Breaking Bad’s Jesse Plemons is aptly hesitant as the inexperienced lieutenant on the nervous brink of manhood, and Peter Mullan offers gruff welcome as the avuncular Colonel at the halfway point’s stop-off. Ben Foster shines brightest (as so often the case), as the unrepentant convict Blocker is additionally tasked to deliver to his punishment.\n\nHostiles is a gut and heart-grabbing examination of what surviving in such savage times does to a person. The title might question the true origins of such hostility, but it’s a further-reaching consideration of the impact of violence, anger and the healing power of shared understanding. That it should combine such heartfelt drama with rip-roaring, ricocheting shoot-outs transports the contemporary western onwards. Into a rarefied plain that is deeply satisfying.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★\n\n2017\n\nDir: Yorgos Lanthimos\n\nShooting Game\n\nFollowing on from his pincer-sharp adult fairy tale The Lobster (2015), Lanthimos’ The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a more menacing beast. The characters share the same stilted, unnatural delivery of dialogue, taking us back into a similarly odd realm of heightened, hyperreal allegory. But we’re on a darker, more disconcerting trip. Multiple long corridors stretch off into the distance throughout. The cumulative effect is the feeling that they might be receding into the deepest reaches of Lanthimos’ psyche, always just beyond reach.\n\nColin Farrell is Steven Murphy, renowned surgeon, endlessly pacing these pristine interior walkways of some Stateside, state-of-the-art hospital. After a heart-pounding opening, Farrell’s idle small talk with a colleague sets the uneasy mood. They’re going into a banal level of detail about the water-resistant properties of their wristwatches, in characteristically passionless tone. Conversation over and it’s back to Murphy’s mundane workaday routine of saving lives, with anaesthetised punctuality, ever on schedule.\n\nOutside the walls and duties of the hospital, he’s regularly hooking up with a teenager. Young Martin is awkward, wary but precocious, a touch too assertive. Farrell enquires after his well-being. He buys him gifts (a water-resistant wristwatch, what else?). The kid is invited over to meet his children, and wife, a demure Nicole Kidman. They’re the very picture of the archetypal middle-class family. Naturally, the offer is returned, and the esteemed medic joins the young buck and his mother for dinner, in a blackest-comedy cameo that sees Alicia Silverstone’s return to the big screen. But the pervading air of weird unease persists, despite (actually, because of) everybody’s overly polite interactions. When it becomes clear that Steven is vainly trying to fill in some sort of custodial, fatherly role, the boy’s malignant hold over the surgeon and his family is exposed. And begins its steady, abnormal growth.\n\nEvents take place in a universe that is not quite our own, one foot just outside of reality. The Lobster’s bizarre regulations excelled within the detached confines of its ‘hotel’ setting. Here, the haunting impact is strengthened by sailing so dangerously close to the winds of real life. Kidman and Farrell make a most compelling central couple, reunited so soon after locking horns in Sofia Coppola’s The Beguiled (2017). Successful, highly thought of, raising two virtuous, principled children, but beneath the surface, competitive, distant, in a rut. Amongst the U.S. setting, Farrell’s pleasing Irish drawl emphasises the character’s shellfish-out-of-water predicament. Kidman’s forthright decency would appear to go deeper than her husband’s, but she too is willing to venture to the darkest recesses if necessary. But it’s Barry Keoghan (Dunkirk, 2017, ’71, 2014) who is the revelation. As arduous adolescent Martin, he conjures up the queasy sense that something just ain’t right from his first moment, with seemingly no effort.\n\nThis is a film that is deliberately poised to ask questions, not to answer them. As the family’s plight creeps towards its inescapable conclusion, the premise is a contemplation of how the eternal themes of responsibility, justice, control, and regret must be negotiated around the complexities of modern life. This disquieting fable takes time to fully digest, then installs itself in the memory with the unsettling persistence of an all-too-realistic nightmare. It’s a slow-release and powerful morality tale that hits fresh horror notes in highly individualistic style. The revolving trauma of the ending coda, and the ideas it forces you to round on and confront, will be difficult to shake off.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★\n\n2017\n\nDir: Dean Devlin\n\nStorm Warning\n\nEven the time in which Geostorm is set is patently ludicrous. In the future, the nations of the world have come together to construct a globe-spanning network of weather satellites to protect against climate change. They’ve managed this phenomenal advance …by 2019. It might as well be set next Tuesday. It’ll probably take the Brexit negotiators at least a decade just to finish arguing over the bill. But a planet-sized exoskeleton of gigantic meteorological space tech? That can be chucked into the sky in …ooh, a year and a bit?\n\nSo, even from the introductory caption setting the date, you know that every single aspect of this hot guff is abject nonsense. Talking of which, saviour of London Has Fallen (2016), Gerard Butler is the hero who designed this planet-saving air-conditioning unit. By his own rules, of course. He’s a maverick. He’s a geezer. But Geezer Butler is also a bit of a dick. He doesn’t get on with his brother (Jim Sturgess), the man put in charge of investigating the satellites’ recent spate of malfunctions. Malfunctions that see entire Saharan villages frozen like icing sugar overnight, and the cracking earth’s crust threaten to swallow Chinese cities whole. Such is bro’s disdain, Butler gets sacked from the very project he founded, to carry on his life of maverick arseholery in a caravan by the coast, well out of harm’s way. But, whaddyaknow, when they need someone to rocket to space to have a tinker with the settings of “Dutch Boy”, as it’s bizarrely called, there’s only one guy for the job. The Geezer that built it.\n\n[PLOT… er, ‘SPOILERS’ AHEAD!]\n\nAll of the acting appears to be uniformly dreadful. There I was assuming it was beyond human capacity to give such a twaddle-by-numbers script any scrap of authenticity. But then 13-year old Talitha Bateman (as Butler’s daughter), by conjuring a glimpse of genuine feeling, acts every single adult clean off the screen. As if to compound an anti-UK sentiment that sees the British lead duo playing American, Butler is greeted by a monstrous London-boy stereotype the second he arrives. Robert Sheehan is so immediately up in his grill with the most cartoonish cockerney accent, you just want him punched. Pleasingly, that doesn’t take too long (perhaps the film’s only moment of satisfaction). Predictably, there’s something more pernicious afoot than just a few technological gremlins. But the fact is so heavily telegraphed by the culprit being so eye-bleedingly obvious, any potential for suspense simply plummets dead out of the sky.\n\nThis is an ill-begotten attempt at an XXL conglomeration of every natural disaster movie ever, condensed into one massive phooey typhoon. Thus it ‘channels’ Armageddon (1998), The Day After Tomorrow (2004), 2012 (2009)… I’m getting confused by dates now. And in some administrative cock-up of which genre it’s ripping off, even Gravity (2013) is in there. Its premise boils the issue of climate change down into something that can be fixed in a jiffy by one person. Let alone for that person to be a belligerent barking burke. Consider the plot for one moment (presumably you’re not supposed to), and its gargantuan idiocy rains down. Someone is engineering global ‘geostorm’ so they can wipe out the President in order to take his place. The only teensie-weensie downside is that they’re wiping out all of humanity in the process. INCLUDING THEMSELVES. But don’t fret, Geezer’s here to avert it. And his dastardly fix does actually appear to be the stereotypical I.T. solution. Yes… turning it off and turning it on again.\n\nThis is a film perfectly suited to Trump’s idiocracy. And Butler makes a fine figurehead for such dim-witted dross. It feels it necessary to throw everything – the world burning – at the cinema frame in the hope of scraping young people’s eyes away from their mobile screens. This is where we are. Vainly trying to compete with the internet, ‘traditional’ entertainment is so preposterously maxxed out that it beats away at the intellect by way of a thank you. You can actually feel your intelligence being depleted by this cascading avalanche of dumb.\n\nGeostorm deserves its own global warning. It’s a totem of humanity’s decline as we stumble onwards under the blinkered illusion of smart ‘progress’. For the sake of the children, your children, batten down the hatches and protect yourself from this torrential deluge.\n\n★*\n\n*One star due to Talitha Bateman’s performance. And the clichéd dog-who-gets-separated-from-his-owner-in-the-panic is quite cute.\n\n2017\n\nDir: Armando Ianucci\n\nThe Late Dictator\n\nSupreme Leader of The Satirical Party, Armando Ianucci, switches focus historically and geographically for his latest. The patent inanities of TV hits The Day Today, The Thick Of It and Veep have perhaps been superseded by the real-life ridiculousness of the day …today. A post-Brexit backbiting stalemate and Trump’s disunited States, together, might have taken us into such a nonsensical era that parody becomes impotent. Attention is rewound instead to the Soviet Union in the post-World War II aftermath of Stalin karking it.\n\nPaddy Considine conducts a fine opening overture. He’s a radio producer broadcasting an orchestral recital with celebrated pianist Maria Yudina. Afterwards he receives a phone call from General Secretary Stalin himself, who expects a recording of the performance straight away. Except it wasn’t being taped. And everyon"
