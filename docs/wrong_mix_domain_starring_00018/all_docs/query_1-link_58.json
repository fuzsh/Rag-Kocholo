        "text": "Tasha Alexander Death in the Floating City\n\nThis is an earlier adventure for Lady Emily, and her husband Colin Hargreaves, than The Dark Heart of Florence. He spies for Britain and is devilishly handsome, as his wife tediously never tires of telling us, and him. Also tiresome is the fact that every palazzo Emily visits has ceiling frescoes, one even by Tiepolo. Frescoes are extremely rare in Venice, as we all know - due to the damp atmosphere they don't dry - and so are never to be found on ceilings. But those are minor annoyances, as the author's unquestionable skill with breathless narrative and convincing dialogue keeps us turning those pages, and she knows her Venice. The action is related to historical events, as usual, with the theme of childless wives uniting the threads. Good romantic fun.\n\nMichael Allen Mr Fenman's Farewell to His Readers\n\nIf I start by stating that this is literary fiction I don't mean that it might win the Booker Prize, but that it's a story that's all about writing. It tells of a popular, but not literary, author's formative trip to Venice in 1786. He meets a French woman who is, of course, mysterious and who becomes his muse and lover. She guides his hand, in much detail, in the construction of his first novel and another part of his anatomy...but here there's much less detail. Then she disappears. The style is very much no problem and the detail convincing, although Venice is there in our minds rather than in the author's descriptions. I enjoyed the book a lot, but the plot left me feeling a bit disappointed in its lack, for me, of resolution. And the sequel, called Amadea in Venice is an equally slight tale, in fact the same tale, retold as a lesbian affair this time, but still involving the same ageless muse, to Mr Fenman himself later in his life. All a bit too meta and plotless for my tastes.\n\nFederico Andahazi The Anatomist\n\nRenaissance physician Mateo Colombo is looking for the way to a woman's heart, and discovers the clitoris. He is branded as a heretic and charged with witchcraft. He looks back on the inspiration for his quest, and the course of his experimentation from his pre-trial confinement. His progress and its relation to the contemporary attitudes towards women, make fascinating reading and, although not described much, Venice makes an appropriate backdrop. It's the wicked libertine version of Venice this time, complete with decadent parties with the men in fashionably transparent hose showing off their genitalia, with ribbons and bells attached. The arrival of the object of our hero's obsession sets up a fair old tinkling.\n\nFederico Andahazi also wrote The Merciful Women. Mima Balia Ruskin's rose - A Venetian love story\n\nThis book is a plush but thin thing, with well spaced text, telling of John Ruskin's famous late-in-life infatuation with young Rose La Touche, and suggests that he found solace from this relationship's non-consummation, and her death, in the paintings of Carpaccio. In particular the St Ursula paintings, which tell the story of a doomed virgin, you see. (The really interesting fact about St Ursula, though, is that the story of her taking 11 thousand virgins on her trip to martyrdom is probably just the result of the misreading of a letter - the copyist interpreted the M in ' 11M' as a Roman numeral and not just standing for 'martyrs', as seems much more likely.) It's a pretty theory, and a pretty book, but the prose is a little purple in places, and you'll read it in no time. The wonderful Carpaccio Saint Ursula paintings are even reproduced in here, to pad the slim volume out a bit. (Mima Balia is a pseudonym.)\n\nHonoré de Balzac Massimilla Doni\n\nThis is a slim volume. It's the story of love in Venice, involving a Duchess, her lover, her husband the Duke and his protégé the opera singer, who has a night of passion with the Duchess's lover, who is then riven with guilt, etc. The style is considerably more florid than I remember from past Balzacs, being lustrous in style to the verge of the Gothic. But it's all still pretty enjoyable and very Venetian, with much talk of the state of the country, and music - boy, is there talk of music! A quarter of the book is taken up with the Duchess talking a French visitor through a Rossini opera, and it's all very skippable, for me anyway, but at least it chimes with the novel's overall key theme of transcendence, be it in love, music, or opium dreams. A treat for fans of Italian opera and Rossini but slim pickings for the rest of us.\n\nFacino Cane\n\nA short story, actually set in Paris, in which the narrator attends a working-class wedding, and becomes fixated with the trio of blind musicians playing there, befriending the clarinet player, who turns out to be a Venetian nobleman with an interesting, and very Venice-reeking, story to tell.\n\nAlessandro Barbaro\n\nThe Eyes of Venice translated by Gregory Conti\n\nAs the book opens, in Venice in 1580, Matteo and his son Michele are masons building a house for a Venetian Senator. An argument over payment, combined with Matteo's drink and keeping-his-mouth-shut problems, and a subsequent bungled arrest, result in his son having to flee Venice. This he does by signing up as an oarsman on a galley bound for Crete, leaving his wife, Bianca, behind. Adventures and learning opportunities aplenty follow for our hero as his galley heads south. We also learn a fair amount about the finer details and hardships of the life of an oarsman. I for one didn't realise that oarsman kept on board for months would thereby begin to see their fellow oarsmen as damn attractive as time passed. On winter layovers they would also be put to work knitting socks too, I kid you not. Upon reaching Crete our hero just reaches the cliffhangerish point of almost being murdered and then the next chapter whisks us back to Venice. Here Bianca and her mother-in-law are finding survival hard without husbands. The older woman gets taken in by the order of the humiliated (a somewhat literal translation that) but Bianca is forced to try out various options. The grimness of life for a poor Venetian woman is thereby shown as about as nasty as that of an almost-slave oarsman. Poverty anywhere is very much no bowl of cherries, is the message. Lots of fragrant and authentic period detail, though, to the lives in Venice and at sea. The translation is mostly elegant enough, but it occasionally reads oddly, as in the example above, with the odd misstep, like when some rugged sailors are described as 'arguing vivaciously', and there's a tendency for said sailors to call each other 'my dear', which doesn't read true. Also the churches and parishes of Venice are all dutifully translated into English, and so references to the churches of Saint George and Saint Agnes, though obvious if you think about them, do require some pondering. The author is a historian, whose books are usually not novels, which explains the density of the detail, if not the sound narrative pacing. A good, long and involving read, then, with its refreshing concentration on real non-patrician lives.\n\nSimon Barnes Venetia - a supernatural thriller set in Venice\n\nA prologue detailing long-forgotten events in 1508 in the long-gone convent of Santa Maria delle Virgini sets the gruesome background to the novel's present-day story. A couple and their daughter come to Venice in 2011. They are archaeologists, come to help with an under-lagoon dig and excavations on the nearby Lazaretto. The daughter, named Venetia for the city of her conception, is to go to school and learn to become a native Venetian. Unfortunately she soon seems to be taking on the personality of a particular 16th-century Venetian victim of an undead priestly pervert. The supernatural events and unnatural acts mix with the domestically detailed and very real lives and are thereby thrown into darker relief. There are shades of Don't Look Now, The Undrowned Child and even The Exorcist, and so a water-borne funeral out to San Michele is to be expected. But the author weaves all of these influences and expectations into a genuinely gripping read, especially towards the end. The family relationships and tensions during crises are feelingly and believably described. With this kind of book the believable stuff needs to convince or the supernatural elements can come across as gratuitous. And the topographic details are all authentic too - the action is mostly set around Castello and evokes the quiet and ordinary mystery of this area very strongly. If you're a fan of Venice's darker aspects and like to be a little disturbed at times you're in for a treat here.\n\nLouis Begley Mistler's exit\n\nIn which a rich man diagnosed with soon-terminal cancer goes (surprise, surprise) to Venice and has sex with a pushy and randy female photographer and a woman he fancied at college. Pardon my terse précis but the gushing reviews plastered on this one made me expect much more than I got. The comparisons to Henry James I put down to the Venice setting and the long sentences. The comparisons to Proust can only be put down to drugs or madness. The first half contains some truly tedious stuff dealing with the finer points of squeezing as much cash as you can out of a company which is buying your company. (Now you never know when that knowledge is going to come in handy do you?) I expected this soulless tedium to serve as some contrast with the man of depth and feeling he becomes, but nothing so obvious or inspiring transpires. He stays a prick despite wandering around some fine Venetian art, locales and canals. It may be an American thing, because as a Brit I find a character who we're supposed to admire because he made lots of money rather hard to take. He agonises a bit over the choices he's made and the things he's done to people but truly regrets not a jot. Didn't like him, didn't like the book.\n\nH. S. Bhabra Gestures\n\nWell, here's an odd one. It reads like a very snobbish novel from the middle of the last century, but it was written in the 1980s. Our narrator is lifelong diplomat Jeremy Burnham - who describes himself as a plain and dependable man - recalling his life from old age. His story begins in Venice in the 1930s with fascism on the rise, and tells of the callow and self-important new diplomat's contact with some seductive and secretive people. A tragedy at that time then propels us to the end of the war and his posting to Amsterdam, where one of the group he met in Venice reappears and things turn bad again. The class values and snobbishness are part of the character of the (unreliable) narrator, of course. The author was of Indian birth, brought up in England, and lived in Canada where he presented a TV program about books in Ontario. This is his only book and he died in 2000. The literary quality is here a definite cut above and the Venice atmosphere in the first half is authentic and effortless. The time of setting is pretty uncommon for Venice-set novels and given the period you'll not be surprised that anti-Semitism is a recurring theme. An occasional tendency to get a bit carried away with the philosophising is the only price you pay for a book of real emotional depth and perception and grip.\n\nChristopher Bollen A Beautiful Crime\n\nFollowing a prologue featuring a bleeding body we are introduced to Nick, who has only recently escaped Dayton for New York, the better to freely express his sexuality, and so is still in possession of his midwestern politeness and decency. He's arriving in Venice for the first time, suitably overawed, to meet Clay, his boyfriend, and commit some low-key larceny. It involves old New York money, antique silver and a very rich man only too keen to spend money on restoring art in Venice so that people will focus on that ostentation and not on how his money was made. There's also a fair amount of romancing between our leads. I can take only small amounts of snogging, sex and mutual physical admiration no matter what the sexual combination, so I found myself speed-reading the bits involving the narcissism and nakedness of Nick and Clay. Everyone is just so handsome or pretty. This kind of objectification has become a bit of a minefield in straight fiction, so I suppose there's nostalgia here for less complicated times. But Venice is strong with this one, and there's art talk and sharp and convincing dialogue a-plenty to more than make up. Locations include the Gesuiti church, San Zanipolo, the Scuola di San Rocco and the Lido at night. So I found myself dragged along, until we descend into murder quite near the end, and the morally ambiguous conclusion explains the Patricia Highsmith comparisons.\n\nBenet Brandreth\n\nThe Spy of Venice: A William Shakespeare novel Benet being the son of the very annoying TV personality Gyles did not encourage me to the reading of this one, but I'm glad I managed to put the memory of his dad to the back of my mind as this is superior stuff. We begin with Will Shakespeare chafing at his life as a Stratford glove merchant and father of two, until his excitement at the arrival of a troupe of travelling players leads to his needing to flee to London with the players. There he is swept up by European politics and plotting and ends up in Venice. The historical detailing is woven into the plot most skilfully and sure-footedly, and the characters and dialogue convince and impress with little seeming effort. And if making Shakespeare a spy seems a little naff as an idea I can only say it works. Venice is reached about a third of the way in and the deception intensifies. I found the double-dealing a bit too tortuous, to be honest, but remained reading and interested, not least because of the quality of the writing, which truly does our hero justice. The Venetian detail is sound too, with a character based on Veronica Franco, Jacopo Tintoretto (who painted her) a key player and San Rocco - scuola and church - key locations. Solid and subtle.\n\nIn the sequel The Assassin of Verona the action moves...guess where?\n\nJoseph Brodsky Watermark\n\nIn which the Nobel Prize-winning poet tells us of his love for Venice in winter and makes obvious the depth of this love. The forty-eight short chapters tell stories, describe places and remember feelings. This is more biography than fiction, I think, but the life takes second place to the place. There's much evocative description and some memorable images in this short book. My favourite is the bit about the Venetian winter fogs, which are so thick that if you do pop out to shop you can find your way back through the tunnel your body carved through the fog on the way out. A more accessible and straight-forwardly Venetian alternative to the Calvino below. With thanks to correspondent Marzena Bomanowska for the recommendation.\n\nGrace Brophy A Deadly Paradise\n\nA reviewer on the cover compares Grace Brophy to Donna Leon, of course, but it's more interesting to spot the ways in which they differ. Commissario Cenni is not a family man - he's more your troubled and obsessed loner, but he thankfully doesn't write poetry or have a thing for the opera. (He does have a cat though, called Rachel - see above) As a character he'll remind you more of Michael Dibdin's Aurelio Zen and the story has a more muscular feel and more nastiness and bad people than Donna Leon gives us. The story progresses, revealing the life stories of the characters, good and bad, as Cenni investigates the murder and mutilation of a German woman who had been a diplomat, a blackmailer, bisexual, and nasty piece of work. The Commissario follows the trail of the victim's visitors and lover to Venice, where his own past and demons get a good stirring-up too. The lives and secrets reveal in a smooth, compulsive and faultless fashion and later there's another visit to Venice, and cats prove crucial. Superior stuff.\n\nThe sequel The Last Enemy is set in Assisi.\n\nMaxence Fermine The Black Violin\n\nA young genius violinist is drafted into Napoleon's army and ends up in Venice where he gets billeted with an old genius violin maker who has a story to tell... One of those fable-like tales that come short on detail and texture and long on, it is hoped, resonance and meaning. It succeeds on these terms, although the story is not unpredictable and is very short. There are good brief evocations of Venice too - the spooky Venice of masks and mists and mortality.\n\nMarina Fiorato The Glassblower of Murano\n\nRecently-dumped Nora decides to leave London for Venice and to there become Leonora, reclaiming her colourful Venetian descent, learning the craft of glassblower and discovering more about her famous forefather, himself a master glassblower with a story. The story of Leonora's experiences in modern-day Venice plays out at the same time as we learn of her ancestor's tragic story in 17th century Venice - and it's been, oh, weeks since we've had one of these past/present shadowing jobs. The historical fiction being set in the 17th century is unusual - we're more used to a renaissance or 18th century setting lately - and the glassblowing milieu is quite fresh narrative ground too. Also it makes a change to read a Venice novel this year (2008) that's not about Vivaldi and/or music, although this one does have the Pieta as a strong plot presence. The modern story, though, is very much a wish-fulfilment story for women. Sorry if you think I'm being sexist or compartmentalising, but if I tell you that our heroine gets roped into a glammy advertising campaign for the glassworks she works for because she looks so lovely, like Botticelli's Primavera, and that her colleagues consequently all hate her, and then she becomes pregnant, even though her London relationship had failed because of her barrenness...well, forgive me. Venice is well painted and well loved though, even if there are a couple of annoying mistakes, like Leonora dining out in Piazza San Barnaba - come on, we all know there's only one piazza in Venice.\n\nIan Fleming Risico\n\nThis is a short story found in For your eyes only and it features Venice only very briefly, with a bare few paragraphs, and one good joke. Then it's off to Alberoni on the Lido which gets the benefit of more plot and description and a leftover land-mine accident. If you've only ever seen Bond films, like me, then this is a good place to sample and start and be surprised at how good a writer Fleming is.\n\nMickey Friedman Venetian Mask\n\nThe story begins in Paris, where a veteran of the '68 riots is still living off the fame generated by a book he wrote about them twenty years previously. He has now gathered a circle of unattractive 'friends' for his next project. The plan is for the group to attend the Venice carnival, masked and in a costume of their choice, but to not tell each other what these costumes will be, and then attempt to identify each other based just on the appropriateness of their costumes. The protagonists include a couple recently split by the husband falling for a man in the group, so emotions are running high. And then someone is murdered. This is a novel which shows its age a fair bit (it was published in 1987). When I tell you that one of the characters is obsessed with, and attends carnival disguised as, Jean-Paul Sartre you'll get some idea of what I mean. But being of its time is no condemnation, as it's also a novel which holds the interest and keeps you reading and interested in the outcome, although this interest is not generated by caring for the characters it must be said. The writing is effortless and evocative too - the action takes place in a very authentic Venice. It tries to be a serious novel and a mystery, but falls between stools a bit by being very fractured in its switching between characters and in having so much of the plot-twisting and mystery rely on the cheap trick of mask-wearing. The overall (and unsurprising) theme is identity and the masks we wear.\n\nMark Frutkin The Lion of Venice\n\nMarco Polo has had less written about him, fewer novels certainly, than some other sons of Venice we could mention, so we welcome with open pages this well-written fictionalised account of Marco's first journey East. There's an assassin following and a guardian lion who appears in dreams. The hallucinatory nature of many episodes adds some fresh flavour to the writing. As a fan of leaner writing I found this a little overdone at times, but the easy flow of the writing and the plot makes me feel quibblesome for even mentioning this. There are some mighty memorable scenes, odd occurrences and telling resonances too. The Venice content begins and ends the book, with Marco's life-before and the aftermath of the long journey, but the evocation is colourful and authentic, especially at the end, as the returning Marco experiences the full impact and beauty of his home city after being so long away. An uncommonly good read.\n\nCarlo Fruttero and Franco Lucentini\n\nThe Lover of No Fixed Abode\n\nThis is a new (2024) translation by Gregory Dowling, a good friend of this site. As we start reading we are dropped into two plot strands in Venice in winter. One features a budget tour leader as he herds his group and the other is narrated by an art dealer who's flown in to look at some ancestral art put up for sale. The setting, and the time of writing, is the mid-1980s, so there are period details like instamatic cameras and prices in lire, but also much that is familiar, like the personalities that make-up an average tour group, and the unpredictability of Italian opening times. The authors are famous for their crime novels, but this is romantic fiction, albeit concerned with learning the secrets kept by the man of mystery. The language - so many adjectives and adverbs! - and digressions are not your typical crime-fiction fare either. This floridity and plot-wandering can be entertaining, but can also cause one to mentally shout 'oh get on with it!' There's no criticising the Venetian detail and topography, though - the walks and boat rides are authentic and evocative. There's even an index of the places (and people) featured. We are kept interested as our man's mysteries are slowly uncovered and things get, well, weird - the lines between imagination, fact, history and religion get very blurred. At one point I began to suspect that the mystery man was a centuries-old vampire, and I'm still not sure I was wrong. This book is undoubtedly something else.\n\nCornelia Funke The Thief Lord\n\nThis is a children's book, but an unusually absorbing and well-illustrated one. Ms Funke started out as a children's book illustrator - that's one of her chapter headings below, and you'll find a well-head by her elsewhere on this page. When a detective working in Venice is asked to track down two missing children he little realises how much trouble this one case will cause for him and his tortoises. The kids are currently living in a disused cinema with a bunch of lovable urchins surviving by stealing and scavenging. Their leader, the Thief Lord, is not who he seems - now how unusual is that in novels set in Venice! - and the big job that's going to make their fortune soon turns strange and dangerous. The underlying theme of the adult vs. the child is well played out, and is even explored in the magical developments later. And magical is, for once, a word that can safely and truthfully be used to describe this book. There is also a film.\n\nNicole Galland I, Iago In which we read of the life of the villain of Shakespeare's Othello. Growing up in Venice, the unfavoured third son, his tendency to honesty and deception is established early on and in no time we're taken with him into the Arsenale as he is trained in the ways of guns and manhood, before being sent against his will abroad to fight foreigners. He returns unfashionably brown and unwontedly famous for his bluntness. Soon he has met and married Emilia and become indispensable to Othello, the new general of Venice's army. The plot of the play kicks in about two-thirds through and the action gets fruitier and more contrived and Shakespearean then, of course. But the author does a fine job of blending and convincing. We're in Iago's head and so comes understanding, if not always sympathy. The story fair whips along wittily, with Venice well-evoked, both topographically and philosophically - the city's renaissance society's vacuous social rules and nuances of class are rarely so well observed and described. A clever and moving treat.\n\nThe so-called Casa di Desdemona.\n\nRobert Girardi Vaporetto 13\n\nEverything has its dark side - life, the moon, the Force and Venice. This book starts unpromisingly, with a cat being put down and with an arid financial fixation usually only found in books with embossed covers. But the shiny heartlessness of our hero's life is, of course, about to get tarnished by contact with the dark and attractive decay and destitution of Venice, and a domino-clad woman who shares these qualities. The author rather overplays the putrescence, in my opinion, and conjures up a somewhat too dark & corruption-riddled city. This is closer to Stephen King than Barry Unsworth and as such is a fairly gripping read if approached with low expectations.\n\nThere was a film of this in production in early 2007, but it was never completed, it seems.\n\nChristopher Golden and Tim Lebbon\n\nThe Chamber of Ten\n\nThe book begins as a boat brings two characters to Venice and we get some somewhat convenient exposition telling us how Venice is built not on land, but rests on wooden piles, is sinking under the weight of too many tourists, has lost its cats, etc. These characters then visit the Marciana library, where our heroine has discovered an underground chamber full of books, and as she arrives another is found underneath that one! Even though we've just been told that there's no ground beneath Venice for the chambers to be under. Oh well, a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is called for, I suppose, as the story also relies on magic and telepathy, between lovers and over hundreds of years. Once you switch off your scepticism this is a readable romp in equal thrall to Indiana Jones, The Da Vinci Code and The Undrowned Child. And once you've gone all factually forgiving you might also be willing to accept that there's such a thing as a motorised traghetto and that the water in front of the Doge's Palace is a canal, and not a dirty big lagoon. But as the book progresses you'll also have to put up with the just-visited island of San Michele referred to afterwards as San Marco, three times; which is both shoddy copy-checking and confusing plot-wise. Then one of the characters has trouble with a motorbike parked in someone's hall. Then a secret room is found with a Masaccio canvas - that's Masaccio the Florentine famous for his frescoes. (Maybe the authors were thinking of Carpaccio, and didn't have a PC to check. Or to find out the names of any other Venetian artists.) In the end these mistakes and the vagueness of, for example, having an important site described as being 'in Dorsoduro' repeatedly, without ever getting more specific, wearing and annoying. There's also a somewhat inauthentic obsession with all the canals being thick and smelly and the 'streets' being full of rubbish and rats. I mean they're expecting me to buy this book and they can't be bothered with Google Earth, let alone taking a short trip to get to know the place. To say that I don't expect either author to be taking my Venice-lovers Venice Questions quiz is a huge understatement.\n\nWilliam Goldman (as S. Morgenstern)\n\nThe Silent Gondoliers\n\nA slim volume from the author of The Princess Bride containing a short fable, much white space, and many illustrations. It's the story of a gondolier with a gooney smile and his struggle for acceptance by his peers - despite having a singing voice that encourages his pelting with old fish - with lots of secret gondolier lore that is so mysterious and impressive that it must be made up. These include the reason why gondoliers don't sing anymore, despite having such fine voices that Caruso shunned Venice forever after hearing them, and revelations about the secret gondolier hangout and the site of the trickiest turn, used to test all graduating gondoliers. It won't take up much of your life to read this book, but it may well lodge in your memory, especially if you have a fascination for, or indeed a thing about, gondoliers.\n\nJason Goodwin The Bellini Card This is the third in a series featuring Yashim the eunuch. Here the young sultan charges our hero with finding and acquiring the famous Gentile Bellini portrait (see below) of his grandfather, thought to be still in Venice. He first sends his friend Palewski, the Polish Ambassador, undercover as an American collector. Things soon get murky, though, as art dealers start to get murdered. The particular period in Venice's history - the mid-nineteenth century - with the city's days of greatness fast waning and the decay in no way slowed by Austrian rule - is most authentically conjured up. Mr G knows his Ottoman history and his Byzantine leanings make for a refreshingly Eastern-looking perspective. It's also refreshing to have the action centred around the San Polo/Santa Croce sestieri. This is a mystery more literary than punchy, and a very satisfying and Venetian read.\n\nIt belongs to the National Gallery, but is\n\nnow permanently on display in one of\n\nthe V&A's Medieval and Renaissance galleries.\n\n5. The Venetian Legacy\n\nThis year's Nathan and Federica novel begins with their wedding and Fede's shock inheritance of her father Elio's holiday villa on Pellestrina. An impromptu honeymoon there (with Gramsci) leads to some predatory-cat problems, shock discoveries and the stirring up of Elio's Mafia connections. So we're talking serious crime, real criminals and actual corpses this time. There's more violence generally, but what we're here for are the relationships and the dialogue, and we're not disappointed. There is less Brit prog rock on the soundtrack this time, and even a bit of Ariana Grande, but much prosecco and coffee is drunk, meals enjoyed and fish cooked. The whiff of authenticity is strong about the mafia stuff - the Venetian version is called the Mala del Brenta - and the plot intensifies and twists into a very satisfying conclusion. Lots of Lido and Pellestrina locations, but trips back to Venice proper take in familiar locations, and the Santa Maria Maggiore prison. This is a book which grips such that you will find yourself happily binge reading.\n\n6. The Angels of Venice\n\nThis one begins with the acqua granda of November 2019 - the storm and apocalyptic flooding - and takes us through its aftermath. The dirt and detail are what you'd expect from one who lived through it, and it's all very much in the now, the only jarring anachronism being someone nowadays actually wearing an Hawkwind t-shirt. During the storm an art-historian is found floating murdered in a bookshop, and as she was a Brit Nathan becomes involved, and helping with the red tape leads to helping with the investigation. She had a flaky boyfriend, a smarmy millionaire employer and the owner of the bookshop she was found in seems to have taken her on more than a few boats trips. Angels feature, confusingly at first, but resolve themselves into the soppy Reynolds painting (see right) and on deeper into Dürer. The investigation forms a backdrop to the living and the mopping up and, as with the divine Donna, it's the human stuff that keeps you reading - this time there's some very believable grieving. Rest assured Gramsci is still a biting blighter and Fede remains sensible. Moral ambiguity and real emotions, in characters central and peripheral, make this a solid enhancement of an ever-improving and effortlessly gripping series.\n\n7. The Venetian Candidate\n\nThis one begins after the acqua granda of November 2019. It's January 2020, there's a smell of damp plaster and fresh paint in the air, but Covid is just a rumour. The plot begins with a worried relative ringing Nathan about his missing brother. But only recently disappeared, so it's too soon for the police and it's up to our hero to go looking, and find a frozen body in a war graves cemetery. The background is a mayoral election in Venice and then there's the mysterious Visconti Box. We also learn much about Venice during WWI, the golden age of Italian cinema, Palladio, fascist football gangs and Jethro Tull reissues. The fact that this variety works and blends and all gets tied up at the end is testimony to the author's growing skill with this stuff. The action ranges around Venice, taking in the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, St George's Anglican church, Angelo Raffaele and the church and campo of San Polo. There's also a road trip into the Veneto mainland with Nathan and his mate, and there are no prizes for guessing the CDs that get played the car's stereo. Add believable characters and dialogue, copious drinking and convincingly shocking violence and we have another winner.\n\n8. The Venetian Sanctuary\n\nVenice is emerging from lockdown, the new normal is nigh, but the place is still mostly getting visited by Italians, as travel is tricky. In a weirdly quiet city Nathan gets a break from translating Covid-related warning notices, and pandering to Gramsci's every whim, when a Welshman on retreat at the monastery on the island of San Francesco del Deserto falls from the top of the campanile. It looks like an accident, and the suspicions otherwise are so slow developing we might begin to wonder if maybe it just was. Episodes from the dead man's past add to the leisurely pace of revelations, until... Venice and the cast of characters live and breathe and drink as usual, with added details of the life of a Franciscan friar, and life during Covid. There's also underwater archaeology, 101 things to cook with tomatoes, housebreaking tips and sundry facts about octopuses and chickens. Educational, then, as well as, as ever, effortlessly involving and entertaining.\n\nPGJ has announced that he's branching out into another series, set on Sicily, and so we'll only be getting new Nathan novels every other year, with the next one in 2026.\n\nDeath in a Strange Country 2\n\nThis was only the second of Donna Leon's Venetian murder mysteries, featuring Commissario Guido Brunetti, but it shows all the elements and excellence of the later episodes, pleasing on so many levels. There's the plot, involving a dead American found floating face-down in a canal, loathable industrialists, and official obstruction and corruption making the Commissario's job much harder. We get nearer to a fuller understanding of the hidden power of money and then the Mafia things get genuinely scary. And then there's Ms Leon's fab way with family life, and Guido's believable relationship with his fully-rounded wife and kids. Policemen just don't come more straightforwardly likeable and admirable than Guido Brunetti.\n\nThe Death of Faith 6\n\nThe iniquities of the Catholic church are explored and exposed, as a visit from a nun who cared for his sick mother puts Commissario Brunetti on the trail of many an unworthy cleric. Real people populate Donna Leon's novels and Brunetti and his familiar family and colleagues are here forced to face up to Italy's mother church and its many failings: priestly proclivities, greed, and Opus Dei amongst others. She just gets better with each one - the bizarre image of the very small man living in a flat full of very large furniture and his collection of very small (snuff) boxes cannot fail but lodge in your mind.\n\nA Noble Radiance 7\n\nThe discovery of bones in a field at the foot of the Dolomites starts the Commissario poking his procedural stick into the wasps nest that is the Venetian aristocracy. And, as he opens up an old kidnapping case - that most anti-family of crimes - our hero delves again into matters familial whilst plagued by his aristocratic father-in-law's accusations regarding the state of his own marriage. The incompetent superior and his oily familiar are familiar figures, as is the smart and connected secretary Signorina Elettra. Venice, too, is strongly in place, if never quite fragrantly evoked. Then, towards the end, all sorts of odd stuff emerges and the meaning of the title is clarified. You can rely on Donna.\n\nFatal Remedies 8\n\nBrunetti's wife Paola is getting increasingly angry at the reports of sex tours taking men off to places like Thailand to have sex with children. She decides that action is called for, and that an implicated local travel agent needs his window breaking. After the second such attack Brunetti can't prevent her arrest. As the couple argue over right and wrong, and where the law stands with regard to these concepts, Brunetti's current case takes a tragic turn. This is what we want: sexual politics, discussion of what makes a marriage strong, typical Italian corruption, the typically bad postal service, and all played out against our favourite backdrop, evoked in a low-key, but strongly. Paola is undoubtedly a strong woman: she has her own career and does what she thinks needs to be done, yet strangely she still finds time to cook and wait on Brunetti hand and foot, while he lies around and reads. Now why can't I find a woman like that?\n\nFriends in High Places 9 Drugs and building regulations figure largely in this one. Brunetti's apartment is found to not officially exist and then the bureaucrat who'd told him of this dies suspiciously, as do some drug addicts. The whole mess is stewed up by the presence of some loathsome loan-sharks, and the descendants of doges, and we're set for more insights into the unchallengeable corruption of the Italian state, set against the backdrop of the city we love, featuring characters we care about.\n\nA Sea of Troubles 10A fishing boat explodes and sinks out on Pallestrina and two clam fisherman are found dead in the sunken hulk. So begins a case for Brunetti which combines the familiar themes of corruption, bureaucratic blind-eyes, and obstructive witnesses with new concerns like the confusing strength of his concern for the welfare of Signorina Elettra, the Questore's secretary, who insists on going undercover to help. Although she uses the same characters in each of her novels Ms Leon never exactly covers the same ground, with the allegiances and prejudices of a small fishing community providing the flavour here, and Brunetti is as prone to confusion at his emotions as the rest of us. And all rounded off with a tragic and truly gripping climax.\n\nWilful Behaviour 11The murder of one of Paola's students sends Brunetti chasing leads all the way back to World War II, as long-forgotten, or long denied, episodes in Italy's fascist past are dug up, often by people who haven't forgotten, but who still deny. Fascinating insights into country-wide amnesia, and the lack of any reliable histories of the last World War in Italian, mix it up with a fashionable foray into art-crime in another reliable gripper. And all the stuff I usually say about the truthful and touching family and human stuff is here as usual, if not more so.\n\nUniform Justice 12The uniform being military and the justice being about as elusive as usual. A cadet is found hanged in the showers at an elite military academy and suicide is the easy answer. You will not be surprised to learn that Brunetti is sceptical, and rightly so. The boy turns out to be the son of a Venetian politician known for his honesty - that rarest of qualities in politics generally, let alone Italian politics - who had retired suddenly many years previously. This retirement had coincided with his wife's getting injured in a hunting accident, and resulted in an investigation into military procurement shenanigans being dropped. You can see generally where this is going, but it is the emotions and issues stirred up in Brunetti and the other cast members that provide the meat in the tale. Signorina Elettra is again essential, and seems about to reveal some back-story, but remains as enigmatic as ever. The usual blend of cynicism and humanity make Brunetti as lovable as ever, and we continue to care and want to know what'll happen to him next.\n\nDoctored Evidence 13As twisty as ever the story, beginning with the death of a grumpy old woman and taking in the oppression of immigrant workers, blackmail and a comprehensive selection of the old seven deadlies, is at once familiar and surprising and full of very real people. I found a couple of the plot devices a little laboured but this is as convincing and involving as ever. And Signorina Elettra just keeps getting more and more of an enigma.\n\nBlood From a Stone 14 As the Christmas lights sparkle in bitterly cold mid-December Venice an African seller of fake designer bags is murdered. And so Brunetti begins an investigation that'll reveal racism, uncover conspiracy and show us more of the Italian state's labyrinthine levels of corruption. But Ms L. keeps the blend as fresh as ever with Brunetti's family life reflecting the issues and that easy style breezing you through the very present-day concerns with wit and perception. Another good one.\n\nAn early title for this one was Vu Cumprà, the faintly derogatory name for the African bag sellers, but a bit out of keeping with the series' usual cliché-quote-based titling I suppose.\n\nThrough a Glass Darkly 15This one begins during a peaceful Spring stretch for Brunetti as, for the first hundred pages, he gets to investigate a crime that's not been committed, only threatened, but which has worried the daughter of the owner of a Murano glass works. Her father has been heard to say he'd like to kill his son-in-law, her husband, whose eco-concerns are somewhat contrary to the old man's business ethic. So there's much discussion of the harm being done to Venice's waters and workers, and some nice glassy stuff. Eventually someone's found dead by a furnace\n\nSuffer the Little Children 16And this new one's even more murder-free, as our favourite Commissario looks into a Carabinieri raid on a paediatrician which results in concussion and a baby taken into care. He uncovers baby-trafficking, misuse of computerised records and some men with some very nasty views. But even with such un-gruesome material we're still drawn in and gripped by the effortlessly human beings Donna Leon puts our way, including old favourites like Signorina Elettra, who gets to play an even more crucial, and active, role this time. This all feeds into the series' recurring theme of the family; with Venice, food, morality and corruption all pondered too. And fig flavour ice cream.\n\nThe Girl of his Dreams 17This one starts out all low-key and domestic again, with no real crime committed for the first third of the book. But we do eventually get the real thing this time, with the shock of authentic death by drowning. The non-crime bit concerns itself with organised religion, with the topics of East European immigration and gypsies all stirred up by political correctness and corruption as the book progresses, making for a good topical and typical brew. As ever it's Brunetti's way with people, his way with conflict and politeness, his humanity and perception which provides the meat and keeps us turning those pages. All our favourite characters are here, and there's that comforting feeling of catching up with the lives and gossip of acquaintances. New developments include a map in the book showing the places where the action takes place, and Brunetti admiring, and visiting, a fair few churches. As my contribution and tribute to the use of clichés for the recent titles I have to say: she makes it all look so easy.\n\nAbout Face 18\n\nThe Brunettis go to a dinner party at Paola's parents' palazzo. Rich people are there, discussing rich-people stuff, but a rich man's wife with an unearthly look, thanks to plastic surgery, surprises and arouses Brunetti with talk of Cicero. Next day at the office Brunetti is introduced to an initially cagey carabinieri who needs his help, but only reveals why after three chapters of emotional and verbal sparring. And so we're off. There's soon a corpse, the Camorra, useful computer hacking and trips to a casino and chemical dumps in Marghera. This one's basically about the illegal shipping of waste, but the personal and political webs that are woven around the plot and the people is what we turn these pages for and we are, as ever, not disappointed. I have to say, though, that I was more than a bit unconvinced by a crucial aspect of the (plot-crucial) behaviour of the main character in the non-waste-related strand of the plot, revealed towards the end. Another one set in the snow too, as was Edward Sklepowich's Veils of Venice a couple of weeks back.\n\nA Question of Belief 19\n\nThere's a hot summer setting this time, as Brunetti wades through the sticky days up to his holiday poking around a couple of unrelated and barely proven crimes. It's real life stuff of course, with the usual concentration on personalities over procedures. An old woman seems to be being taken in by a dubious faith healer - not so utterly different from being duped by the more solidly entrenched state religion, as Brunetti observes. And there's something wrong with a number of court case deferments that could well be profiting the defendants. No crime is committed or detected until almost halfway in, when a body is found as Brunetti's holiday has barely begun. The story is littered with sadly wasted lives, dealt with with Ms Leon's trademark combination of human warmth and practical cynicism. And as ever you're left with the feeling of having delved into real lives.\n\nDrawing Conclusions 20\n\nA young woman returns from a meet-the-parents trip that had gone very sour to her flat, its window facing the prow of San Giacomo dellOrio. Going to collect her post she finds her older downstairs neighbour lying dead. There's blood on the floor and, it turns out, fingerprint bruises on her shoulder. The autopsy says she died of a heart attack but Brunetti is disturbed by doubts about what might have caused it. Not a sparklingly original setup, you might say, but of course it's the characters, encounters and (dare I say it) issues raised that provide the shine and substance. A couple of spiky encounters, with a nun and the boss of a charity helping victims of abuse, are likely to particularly stick in the mind. Ambiguity, surprises, Signorina Elettra, authentic and followable routes through Venice, a moving ending...all elements in place then. Satisfaction guaranteed.\n\nBeastly Things 21This year's Brunetti begins with an actual corpse - and it's a murder victim too - which is an unusually straightforward and crime-novely opening as far as recent Brunetti outings go. It takes a while to find out who he is, and why anyone would want him dead. But of course there are also some smart bits of business along the way between characters old and new, and some plot shadowing in the form of discussions of cows. (Nice to know that Brunetti's wife Paola shares my own very real fear of them.) And ageing. And Brunetti has a new computer, which has been finagled out of some obscure bit of EU budget and which he's determined to use virtuously. So we slip warmly back into the characters' lives, as ever, catching up with them like meeting old friends. I'll just add that Chapter 19 does not need to be read by vegetarians, but all non-vegetarians SHOULD read it. Also that in the final chapter Donna Leon shows she can still surprise with something odd and moving.\n\nThe Golden Egg 22\n\nThings begin all domestic, around the Brunetti family dining table, then the plotting starts in a leisurely way with Brunetti being asked by Patta to look into the Mayor's daughter's business partner, and possible bribes to overlook their mask shop in Campo San Barnaba displaying its wares on the pavement. So far so low-key, even if the Mayor's children's noses in the state-cash trough is another example of one of the series' recurring concerns, and all the hotter topic in these barely-post-Berlusconi times. Paola, Brunetti's wife, then phones him in a state of agitation about the death of the disabled deaf man who helps out in their drycleaner's. (Maybe I've been watching too many of the TV adaptations, but it's good to get back to the books' subtler characterisations - Patta's much less slapstick self-obsession and incompetence, and Paola displaying strong feelings so foreign (literally) to the actress who plays her on the telly.) The dead man looks like a suicide, but his mother is behaving oddly and he seems to have existed without leaving any official traces. The action centres mostly on the area around Campo San Polo and Campo San Stin this time - all very much on Brunetti's doorstep. You might begin to think that you can guess where the plot's heading but you might be wrong, at least as far as your conception of the depths that inhumanity can plumb goes.\n\nBy Its Cover 23\n\nThis one opens with Brunetti investigating the theft of pages and books from a library on the Zattere, a library whose major donor is a friend of Brunetti's (wife's) family and who is expected to not be best pleased at the thefts. Which all leads the reader to expect a somewhat murder-free and family-centric story this time. Well, the somewhat ragged start settles down and things do become decidedly uncosy latter on, rest assured, with the violence, and novel, centring on Castello. The sestieri's rough authenticity, and the residents still speaking in dialect, are well evoked. But then just as the plot seems to be resolving to a stately conclusion the book just suddenly ends - it really does seem as if tens of pages of resolution have been left off the end. This could be an elaborate joke coming at the end of a book concerned with the removing of pages from valuable books, but I think not. Very odd. Let's hope that this decidedly lazy-seeming effort doesn't signal a decline in the author's enthusiasm and quality control.\n\nFalling in Love 24\n\nAnd after the worry of quality-control slippage regarding the last one it's good that this one grips and impresses from the off. It sees the return to Venice of Flavia, the opera singer from Death at La Fenice, the first Brunetti novel, and Acqua Alta. She is getting yellow roses from a nameless admirer in quantities and with a frequency that suggests a stalker. An attack on a young singer may be connected and Brunetti and Signorina Elettra start to do their things to find the perp, even as the violence escalates. Violence against women and the much much rarer phenomenon of violent women are the underlying subjects here, with the follies and strengths of humankind and Venice and its beauties and gossip in the foreground as ever. There are plenty of strolls around Venice and a touching scene where Brunetti goes into San Zanipolo to light a candle for his mother and can't suppress a shudder at the church's poorly restored Bellini. Even the opera content isn't overdone, even for your anti-opera-buff reviewer here, and often provides fascinating glimpses of a very different world. Tosca, the opera being performed, echoes the plot nicely too. I have to say that the ending is more than a little sudden, but not nearly as jarring as last time. Leaving which aside I can but sigh contentedly.\n\nThe Waters of Eternal Youth 25\n\nWe begin with Brunetti at a dinner at his mother-in-law's, which he's unwillingly attending as an authentic Venetian to impress some potential donors to another Contessa's Venice in Peril-like charity. When this other Contessa asks Brunetti to visit her it's to ask him to look into the near-drowning of her teenage granddaughter 15 years previously. It left the girl with the mental age of eight and the Contessa suspicious that there's more to the drunken rescuer's talk of seeing someone push her. Scenes such as Brunetti's teasing out and observing as the Contessa comes to the point is what we're here for, and the writing of these scenes doesn't disappoint. It's half way through the book before an actual crime comes to light, by which time Brunetti's fellow commissario Claudia Griffoni is firmly established as Brunetti's sidekick on this one, as her background is suddenly revealed and becomes useful. The action is mostly around Brunetti's home patch of San Polo, with the near-drowning taking place in Rio San Boldo and many meetings in Campo San Giacomo dell'Orio. We also have Brunetti regretting the loss of the cat sanctuary in front of San Lorenzo, and detouring by the Miracoli to boost his flagging spirits. Brunetti's boss is as malleable as ever, Signorina Elettra remains omniscient, and his family continue to provide stability. Griffoni as his new right-hand-person makes a change and may be a source of future freshness. A slightly hurried ending to the case is followed by a somewhat more considered, and pretty touching, last scene in the story of the victim.\n\nEarthly Remains 26\n\nWhilst interviewing a well-connected scumbag suspect Brunetti is forced to feign a heart-attack to distract a colleague from giving said scumbag a good slapping and thereby endangering his career. Rushed to the Ospedale Brunetti is told that he needs a couple of weeks free of the stresses of his job. He decides that what he needs is to escape from steaming July Venice, and benefit from the calming effect of water and boats. It turns out that one of his wife's wealthy relatives has just the villa on Sant'Erasmo. The first third of the book is devoted to this winding down, and Brunetti getting his rowing mojo back. There's plenty of boat lore and stuff about bees too, as he befriends the villa's taciturn caretaker, a man much saddened by the deaths of his wife and bees. We also get too much detail as to, for examples, Brunetti's packing and clothing choices and the nuances of navigating of the lagoon, but after a body is found the distractions fall away and Brunetti's, and the author's, gift for observation and psychological acuity take over. After some gripping interviews we get an ending of characteristic greyness, which you'll probably need to discuss with someone else who's read the book.\n\nThe Temptation of Forgiveness 27\n\nAs each passing year brings its own April and a new Brunetti novel one wonders if a certain jadedness or predictability might set in, for the reader or the author. But it only takes the opening scene of this one, where Brunetti, on the vaporetto to work, encounters a mysterious bank of fog , in an episode that borders on the mystical, and then gets to work to a summons to the office of his vice questore, who is convincingly compared to the clot on a pot of yogurt, to make all such worries evaporate. The plot then unfolds in a typically leisurely way, involving drug-dealers and chemists, with the actual crime revealed slowly, as if out of a fog, with fragrant sidelinings and the usual greyness about the morality and justice. Along with the usual authenticity and reality of the Venice that passes by, and of the human interactions, we have the full compliment of the joys of the Brunettis. But then at the end we get another one of those dangling endings that seem to be missing a chapter - the perp confesses and then the book ends, with nary a wrap-up, or even concluding thoughts from anyone, and the fate of the book's main victim is left unresolved. All of which I found unsatisfying, in a novel otherwise well up to expectations.\n\nUnto Us a Son is Given 28Here we begin with Brunetti summoned to a meeting with Orazio, his father-in-law. Il Conte is worried that an old friend is intent on making his young lover his legal son and heir and wants Brunetti to investigate. So straight away we're into typical Brunetti territory, where there's an investigation but no crime, maybe. We seem to be looking forward to skeletons in closets, rather than corpses in canals. Meals are eaten, sexual, literary and environmental matters are discussed, and behaviour and relationships sharply observed. A brief digression involving the Vice-Questore's wife being abused by the son of a neighbour adds a further father/son perspective, but not much else. Locations include Florians and Campo San Pietro, with a few walks and boat trips and some telling local-life details, of course. No surprises, lots of telling conversations and then two deaths in the last quarter of the book, with attendant surprise revelations, even if the main one is a little heavily signposted. In the light of recent rushed endings to Brunetti novels this might sound worrying, but the pacing is perfect, if unusual. The author even allows Brunetti to stick with us for a final pondering of lessons learnt and minds changed. The best Brunetti in a fair few years, I think.\n\nTrace Elements 29This one's all about water, it taking place during a sweaty summer meaning a lot of hydration going on. And, given the title, you won't be surprised that pollution and eco-concerns are central this year too. Commissario Claudia Griffoni is a strong presence too, as she and Brunetti are summoned to a dying woman's bedside at the Ospedale Fatebenefratelli up in Cannaregio. Her husband just died in a motorbike accident, she manages a mention of 'bad money', acquired by her husband, Fadalto, to pay her medical bills and so our duo are off, finding out what was bad about the money and if the accident was an accident. Along the way they meet colleagues of Fadalto both helpful and hateful and we learn more than we need to, I think, about the technicalities of testing water samples. A pair of underage roma pickpockets provide a side plot on solid and well-trod ground, but it's not surprises we're here for, it's the authenticity of the interactions and observations, and the greyness of the issues discussed and decisions taken. And Signorina Elettra. And Venice. All the boxes are ticked, then, including the author's recent tendency towards a certain suddenness of ending and resistance to tying up loose ends. But (cliché alert!) that's life.\n\nTransient Desires 30Two badly-beaten American women are left on the jetty of the Ospedale Civile by two young men from the Giudecca. The Commissarie Guido Brunetti and Claudia Griffoni investigate and find themselves in murky inter-departmental and inter-regional waters. The mixture of lives and themes keeps one guessing as to what crime, if any, is going to feature this time. I'll not plot-spoil, but I will say that thing do indeed get nasty. Venice and Brunetti's family life feature strongly, of course. Locations include an unusual amount of Giudecca and lots of Dorsoduro this time, along with the usual locales around the Brunetti's apartment and the Questura - we get an update on San Lorenzo losing its cat sanctuary outside but becoming devoted to ocean art. Boats feature strongly and I learned lots, including the fact that big electric boats can get as quiet as big electric cars. After reviewing 26 of these novels I'm aware of the danger of sounding a bit like an LP stuck in a groove, if you remember those, but I will repeat that it's the authenticity of the humanity and interactions that we come for, and we are not disappointed. Another sudden ending too, but we're getting used to those as well.\n\nGive Unto Others 31This time we begin with Brunetti walking through post-pandemic Venice, relishing the ability to comfortably linger and admire his surroundings, and put away the need to instinctively avoid his fellow pedestrians. As I type this in February 2022 it's arguable that this novel is set in the near future. When he arrives at the office Brunetti has a visitor, a woman who lived upstairs from his family when Brunetti was a boy. Boyish emotions and the social superiority of the girl at the time make for a certain complexity in Guido's memories and feelings. She has come to air the suspicions she has that her daughter is having husband trouble, and he has suggested that they are in danger. With Commissario Griffoni's help he teases out the mother-in-law's worries and, with the rest of the regular gang begins to pry into various businesses and charities that the husband, an accountant, is involved with. The plot progresses through a series of interviews and conversations that are the author's strength, in their subtleties of observation and understanding. If there's a topographical focus this time it's Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo and the theme is mostly, and not unusually, corruption and its effect on it's variety of victims, with mental health issues stirred in too. The ending is pleasing, a little surprising, and nicely paced. There's also a strong cat presence this time. In short: one of the best.\n\nSo Shall You Reap 32\n\nWe commence with Brunetti weeding books out of his four shelves of the family library. Four shelves! He may have a small fraction of the full shelves I've got to show for my life, but I can only sympathise and agree with the books he chooses to weed out, admitting he'll never read them - Proust, Moby Dick, I Promesso Sposi, D'Annunzio...yup! He then gets a call to go free a colleague arrested at a gay pride march in Treviso and later has to get some 'real estate' info for his father-in-law out of an old school chum, and still the plot hasn't actually begun. When it does, with the discovery of a body in a canal, we soon see that the pre-plot preamble was actually the first strands of a finely-woven plot, satisfying in its shape and humanity. The action centres on an area of Cannaregio around the Miracoli church, and Brunetti contemplates, and makes, several visits to churches for spiritual succour. An emotionally involving plot, which passes at a perfect pace, with a convincing conclusion, make this one an unqualified and enjoyable success.\n\nA Refiner's Fire 33\n\nWe begin with underage gang violence in Piazza San Marco with, eventually, the one boy remaining uncollected by his parents needing an escort home from Commissario Griffoni through early-hours Castello. He proves personable and, when Griffoni confers with Brunetti later in the morning, well-connected. Sundry events and connections ensue, some seem relevant, some do not. Clarity comes slowly, as ever, with more strolling through early-hours deserted Venice until a sudden attempted murder and unconnected blackmail attempt get things moving. It seems that the boy's father is a war hero, then it seems not, and then very much not, to a degree that might shock even us hardy regulars. But we don't meet him until the end, by which time you will have been moved and shaken. Another good one.\n\nCarnevale\n\nThe young daughter of a Venetian merchant is taking a bath, drinking fragolino and eating chocolate cake, when a cat appears and, to the sound of a lone violin, lures her into the gondola and arms of Casanova. The girl, called Cecilia, blossoms under Casanova's tutelage into a seeker of pleasure and a painter of portraits which bring out the sitters' inner sensuality, or at least the fact that they've just had a shag. The first half of this book is The Life of Casanova told again, and told in a bit of a rambling fashion, it has to be said. It holds your attention, just, and is unquestionably well written with evocative bits of Venetian business. It just needed a bit of pruning, I think. Casanova here is the Casanova who loves women, not the one who loves them and leaves them. Cecilia is his last true love - the love of his decline who came too late to be included in his memoirs. In the second half of the book she meets and becomes smitten with Lord Byron - a man whose love of women takes a different form. We're talking large contrast here, as Byron uses Cecilia and leaves. She spends the rest of her life, and many many pages, pining for this man who treated her worst...then he turns up in Venice to treat her badly some more. (He brings with him the tales and friends dealt with in Federico Andahazi's The Merciful Women.) Carnevalegives good Venice but it could have done with some editing. It is long and a mite long-winded; but I couldn't stop reading it, and in the end I finished it feeling that I'd really read something.\n\nThe Remedy\n\nAnd this one's even better, and leaner and just as flavoursome! The action switches between Venice, where a daughter of the aristocratic Venier family is confined to a convent, very much against her will, and London where later Valentine Greatrakes' quack-remedy and 'importing' business is stuck a blow as his partner is killed in Venice. There will be more murders, lies, romance, sex and travel before the plot to this one plays itself out. There's also much vivid description of the streets and low life of the Thames Bankside and dank Venetian canal sides - The Remedy gives good 18th century Venice and London, with descriptions you can almost taste, and not just of the food. The hint of decadence in the writing and nastiness in the plotting I find much to my taste too. And if you want to know how you can use any peacock dung, faeculae of cuckow and ox galls you might have about the place in remedies and other useful potions this book will tell you too, with handy recipes at the start of each chapter.\n\nThe Floating Book\n\nAnd the one which was published between the two above is the one that I've read last. It tells a tale spun around the arrival of the first printers from Germany in 15th century Venice, and the controversy they caused making books more widely available, and daring to print the arousing poems of Catullus. This narrative framework of printers, scribes and writers, though, is supported by the women in the story, basically a wife, a prostitute and a nun. And refreshingly it's not the woman of God or the woman of pleasure who one admires most. This is all perfect grist to Ms L's sensuous mill, if you'll pardon the expression, and she goes excellently to town with the poetry, the printing, and the passions. It's a story of love misdirected and love spoilt for lovers of books and Venice. There's witchcraft too, to add spice, some effective use of bird (and egg) imagery and a very believably blighterish cat. The life of Catullus himself features as an introduction to each of the seven parts of the book and Giovanni Bellini, one of my Venetian heroes, makes an appearance too, but not in a showy-offy way. Not a short book but so full of Venice, atmosphere, feeling and characters to care about that it's soon over and leaving you breathless and sated. And wondering about owls.\n\nThe Book of Human Skin\n\nFive years after The Remedy comes the author's new novel for adults. This time she steps out of her Venice/London comfort zones and sets the action half in Venice and half in Peru, in the late 18th century. The story tells of a Venetian merchant's family, where the father's frequent trips to Arequipa leaves behind a son whose behaviour goes beyond evil and a daughter whose goodness is surprisingly strong enough to cope. Things getting much worse is what the novel is all about, so I'll not give much more away. But as the plot develops the Santa Catalina convent in Arequipa (see photo right, by Graham Morrison) is a considerable centre of the action - the cloistered life being a not unusual theme in the author's works. The story is told by the main characters, in their own voices, and even in different fonts. Ms L's ability to well, be these different characters borders on the spooky - this is writing to relish and, I'd hazard, a good big notch up from her previous work in power and range. You'll need a pretty unsqueamish taste for visceral detail too, as physical afflictions and infections are dealt with in unflinching detail. The life of a person being written on their skin is a major theme here - the clue's there in the title. Venetian detail takes a back seat to the narrative sweep this time, but the city is still an essential element, with no other place possible for the plot's purposes. Fans of Michelle Lovric's previous work will revel in the reappearance of Cecilia Cornaro, the heroine of Carnevale, as a very central character. This novel will worm its way into your brain, get under your skin, and if your heart isn't faint it's in for more than a fair amount of activity also.\n\nElizabeth Lowry The Bellini Madonna\n\nAn art historian who has long specialised in Giovanni Bellini thinks that he may have found traces of a lost last Madonna, and also thinks that he knows where it might be hidden. He worms his way into an English country house that has seen much better years and there gets himself emotionally involved, in many ways. Very little page time is spent in Venice, but there's much discussion of Bellini and matters Venetian, so it more than qualifies, I think. Dürer's letters to Willibald Pirckheimer (the source of all of the artist's oft-repeated quotes about Bellini) are mined for material and embellished with invented mentions of the mysterious Madonna. The Bellini content is so much more than mere name-dropping, amounting to a painless primer on the painter almost. If you're sceptical about a book being strongly Venetian whilst having hardly any action in the city you're just going to have to read this book. It's often a bit over-written, with a few too many adjectives at times, but this might be excused as reflecting the verbose character of the narrator, and the writing overall impresses, especially in the conjuring of the spectacularly neglected and malodorous house with its very lost rooms and many mysterious piles. In the end the across-time shadowings and comparisons got a bit wearying and I found my attention wandering a bit, but I always needed to read on and finish.\n\nMary Lutyens Meeting in Venice\n\nMost of us are lucky to have one spectacular life-defining person or event in our lives, but Mary Lutyens... Well, first of all she's the daughter of Edwin, the great architect of the Raj, and then her mother Lady Emily, the daughter of the Viceroy of India, becomes a big noise in the Theosophy movement, which eventually leads to Mary becoming the prolific biographer of Krishnamurti, the mystical movement's messiah. Later she met and married J.G. Links, ex royal furrier and the author of one of the definitive guides to Venice, as well as one of the foremost Canaletto scholars. She also edited John Ruskin's wife Effie's letters and wrote a biography of her father. And she was a novelist. Meeting in Venice introduces us to Catherine, a woman married to a bland and status-obsessed bore and living in Mayfair. Once a year she visits Venice for two passionate and blissful weeks with her lover. The first third of the book is is preparation, explanation and travel, and then we get to Venice. The book was published in 1956, and there's much fragrant post-war detail (bomb-damage, rebuilding, liver sausage) in the London section. The Venice details are less dated, although the lover being called Roderick is not something you'd get nowadays. Venice as a place of blissful romance has rarely been more glowingly evoked, though, even if our Catherine seems to spend a lot of time in agonies of doubt and guilt. This is a book about the fatal ambiguities and anguish of adultery, and the dangers of forcing choosing. It's a good old-fashioned serious novel which I heartily recommend.\n\nTonya Macalino Faces in the Water\n\nIn the final years of the 21st century Venice is a flooded ruin. Alyse Bryant is sent there, with her crew, to negotiate the rights to film, but not long after arriving things take many dramatic turns. And twists. Alyse is a presenter whose body records all of her sensory experiences - implants broadcast everything she feels, and swarms of mini-cameras complete the experience. Earth has also been ravaged by a new plague, a sleeping sickness which affects children but is carried by adults, and Venice is where these adults have been quarantined. Following some wild sex with a handsome old friend, rediscovered quarantined in Venice, it starts to look like Alyse's augmentations may have gone further than she was told. This is very cyber-punky science fiction, but not just that. You don't need to have read dozens of books in the 80s strewn with words like 'wetware' and 'augmentations' to enjoy what is a soundly spooky tale of a strong female coping with, well, lots of bad stuff. Her extra-sensory ability takes on a spectral quality too, as she senses emotions and personalities that swarm around her in ways that defy understanding. Nice Venetian touches include having boats dock picturesquely at the balcony of the Doge's Palace and our heroine taking refuge on a boat inside the flooded church of San Giovanni Grisostomo, ruined with its campanile fallen through the roof. Like the best of this genre the book combines unsettling invention with grounding details and emotions. It ends not on a cliff-hanger, but still unresolved.\n\nThis is now the first in the Shades of Venice series, the sequel is called Stealing Lucifer's Dreams, and part three is Portrait in Veronese Green.\n\nIan McEwan The comfort of strangers\n\nBoring Brit couple (imagine Natasha Richardson and Rupert Everett) fall into the clutches of a predatory Italian Christopher Walken type in an unnamed but self-consciously evoked Venice. So many years have passed since I read this that I won't say more until I've re-read. I've rewatched the film though.\n\nKay MacCauley The Man Who Was Loved\n\nThese things come in waves, I suppose. There was a time when Venice-set novels were all about death or Renaissance art, and just recently nuns and prostitutes have been popular. This one shares some of the apothecary concerns of The Remedy above but otherwise ploughs its own mysterious furrow, being concerned with a boy whose face makes people oddly happy and reminds them intensely of loves lost. He is taken from the foundling hospital of San Barnabo in 1546 by a nun and as his luck decays and brightens he becomes a beggar, a Contessa's plaything and a beggar again, and makes many friends and enemies along the way. These include a collector of corpses who cannot die, a would-be sorcerer who is decaying with the pox, and a castrato whose ups-and-downs rival our hero's. Venice is all around, as you might say, as our boy lives and lurks in various corners, mostly around the Rialto Bridge, but it's left to our experience to provide the pictures as there's not much description of these places. Not that there aren't very sense-arousing descriptions of people and smells and rooms and activities, because there are - very. This verges nicely on the gothic, in its otherness and physicality, and won't soon leave your imagination. Paul Magrs Doctor Who - The Stones of Venice\n\nThis is an 'audio drama' - it comes in four parts on two CDs or on Audible and it can't be bought as a book, as far as I know. The Doctor is played by Paul McGann, the one who resurrected the dying franchise a fraction before 2005's big rebirth, with India Fisher as Charley Pollard. The story has the duo heading off in the Tardis for a weekend break in Venice, but turning up far into the future just as the city is about to sink in a cataclysm brought about by the curse of the Duke's murdered wife, who the Doctor's assistant is forced (by a web-footed gondolier) to impersonate ... Well, all is murky and crumbling and decadent in this more-than-slightly Gothic view of Venice, which is not unprecedented, but which is done well, with much dialogue, of course, and some of it quite clever. The intelligent chat quite makes up for a somewhat thin plot, in fact. The four parts all end with authentic cliff-hangers, and there's much dry humour. The actors all speak un-accented English, which is OK, but the church bells which ring in the background of outdoor scenes are plainly English church bells, which is far from OK, especially given the BBC's famously comprehensive library of sound effects.\n\nMarta Maretich The Merchants of Light\n\nWe begin with a Monuments Specialist Officer arriving in Würzberg to see if Tiepolo's ceiling frescoes in the massively bombed Residence can be saved. Then we skip back to Cecilia Guardi, sister of the painter Francesco, in the 1720s, as she meets and poses for Tiepolo, the man she will marry. This kind of modern/period switching is not unusual, but here the Monuments Man is really just a framing device for the lives of Cecilia and Tiepolo, and this central story is told with colour and perception and feels right. The focus is on Cecilia, later from the viewpoints of a patron and of her sons, but the art and its creation is fore-grounded often and with confidence and perception. It's cunning how this is so much a book about Tiepolo and his work, seen from a variety of perspectives, despite this concentration on his wife. Venice is a strong presence, without much description - this is a novel where you get to conjure your own views rather than being taken on self-consciously picturesque tours of the sights. Hitherto my attitude to Tiepolo has been a matter of polite interest and cool appreciation rather than anything stronger, but this novel is one which could just provide that extra emotional something to take my feelings up a notch. It's certainly a novel more than a fair few notches above in ambition and execution.\n\nMore on Marta's website\n\nLauro Martines Loredana: a Venetian tale\n\nThe clever conceit of a 16th century Venice with two layers - the lower layer being where the poor live, of course - attracted me to this novel. I was also impressed that it was by the historian responsible for the recent book about the Pazzi conspiracy against the Medici. It's also interestingly c0mposed of the letters and confessions of the protagonists, with second-hand reports interspersed. But the story, of the forbidden love of a woman and a priest against a backdrop of political revolt, took so long to get going I gave up a third of the way in. And if I have to read another book set in the Renaissance where the female protagonist's husband prefers the company of other men... I was, in short, ungripped.\n\nDonna Jo Napoli Daughter of VeniceDonata is one of the daughters of one of Venice's richest families so she wants for nothing. Except knowledge. The torment of a girl with an enquiring mind who isn't expected to need an education, and who isn't even allowed to explore the city she loves, is convincingly evoked. She takes to the streets dressed as a boy and her horizons broaden swiftly. The street life of 16th century Venice is new to her, and fascinatingly daunting. We learn as she does, and if sometimes this knowledge seems a little false in the convenience of its telling, it's always interesting, to her and us. That noble families in renaissance Venice could only afford for one daughter to marry, and that her sisters would be condemned to maiden-aunthood or a convent, is a sadly convincing piece of knowledge. That only one son was also allowed to marry, so as not to confuse the line of descent, is more surprising. Donata's story is emotionally involving too, as she takes her destiny in hand, and falls in love with a man who thinks that she's a boy. That her adventures take her first to the Ghetto is not unusual in recent Venice-set fiction, but she learns and feels fresh things here too. And, like the best novels set in Venice published in 2002/3, this was written for older children - see also Stravaganza and The Thief Lord.\n\nElle Newmark\n\nThe Book of Unholy Mischief (aka The Chef's Apprentice) Luciano is a street urchin living in Venice at the end of the 15th century. Having been raised in a brothel and on the streets, his life changes when he's taken back to the Doge's Palace by a chef in need of an assistant. His skulking abilities lead to his witnessing the Doge poisoning a malodorous peasant who he'd mysteriously invited to dinner, and more murders follow. It's all somehow linked with a mysterious book that everyone wants and the chef has his secrets too, it seems. This is another of those books where the action takes place in a Venice whose locations are barely named and rarely described. Liberties are taken with places and names, but the flavours and smells are strong and satisfying. The author plays fast-and-loose with history too, but still pulls the whole thing off. It's a young boy's story, but it's not a book for children, or even 'young adults', because it's less of an adventure and more a book about our desires, in the broad sense, and how they are sometimes misguided. But before I get too lit-crit, I should also point out that the action involves lots of food and cooking, and quite a few cats. An enjoyable, sensual and well-written first novel, then, with only the liberties taken with Venetian topography and history to quibble about.\n\nDavid Nicholls Us\n\nI must begin by saying that the Venice content of this novel is only partial, but that the action set in Venice is pivotal and very much the writing of a man who loves Venice, I think, and hasn't just got it out of books. The author has a bit of a sniffy middle-brow rep, after the success of One Day. True everything he writes does tend to get filmed and so his books tend to get compared to Richard Curtis films rather than other novels. But this one getting onto the Booker Prize longlist is maybe going a bit too far in the other direction. The narrator is a somewhat self-regarding fuss-budget whose wife has said that she's thinking that their marriage has run it's course, but that they should go on their long-planned cultural tour of European cities with their surly teenage son nonetheless. Venice is reached towards the middle of the book and is remained in for many pages. To say more about the circumstances is to risk spoilers, but the Venice painted is recognisably real, but still magical, and will no doubt sparkle in the eventual film. An area of Venice is called San Paolo, which later mentions reveal to be a misnaming of San Polo. But that's the only foot put wrong, and nowhere is Venice referred to as La Serenissima, that cringe-inducing usage favoured by pretentious dinner party bores and the like. There's an ambiguity about the way the narrator is presented, and the feelings of his wife, that is vaguely unsettling, but impressive and keeps you reading. Are we supposed to like him, or want to slap him? Or both? Is she really thinking of ending their marriage? If so why is she still so affectionate and forgiving? These ponderings stay with you until the end, which is also impressively uneasy and like real life.\n\nChristi Phillips The Rossetti letter Here the tale of a courtesan involved in the Spanish Conspiracy of 1618 is alternated with the story of a just-dumped postgrad student who is writing her dissertation on said courtesan and conspiracy, and who has come to Venice to attend a conference and meet the person who is rumoured to be writing a thunder-stealing book on the same subject. The conspiracy may well have been a figment of the council of ten's (or their informant's) imagination and there are many conspiracy theories about it. It is also the subject of Thomas Otway's play Venice Preserv'd. The 17th century story here is well told and the period detail and atmosphere is most impressive and sensual. No problems there. And even the modern story is well-written and full of likeable and convincing characters. It's just that it reads too much like a slushy romantic novel at times, for this romance-a-phobic chap anyway. There's just a little too much about getting the right frock and shoes, and all that does he/doesn't he stuff for me. But having said that the simple conclusions of romantic fiction are not resorted to and the relationships are not unreal. I recommend this for you soppy girlies out there, then, but advise chaps to be prepared to get in touch with their feminine side.\n\nHal Porter The Cats of Venice\n\nThis is a book of short stories, only one of which is set in Venice and is called The Cats of Venice. It tells of a decidedly uncuddly woman who leaves her hotel to go sit in the Garibaldi Gardens to smoke a cigarette. When one of the many local cats (this is an old story) who are watching her approaches she flicks her fag end into its face and leaves. She walks to Piazza San Marco where, whilst sitting and waiting at a cafe table, a preening gentleman approaches her and eventually suggests sex. She swaps harsh words with him a bit before flicking her fag end into his face, as her friend arrives. And that's about it. I'm telling you all this to demonstrate what this book isn't, rather than what it is.\n\nAnthony Powell Temporary Kings\n\nThis is the penultimate book in the 12-volume Dance to the Music of Time series. I recommend reading the whole lot, because they are a wonderful and witty overview of aristocratic and bohemian arty lives lived in England through the 20th century. Nick Jenkins, the narrator, talks us through the century from his school days through the Second World War and into the messy morals and politics of the post-war recovery period. Through it all is woven encounters with friends and associates who change, die, rise and fade. The feeling of the progression and messiness and strange interweaving of lives passing is feelingly evoked and there's much comedy. I've read it through twice now, and I'm a very rare re-reader. Temporary Kings reflects the later volumes' concern with the literary life and the dangerous Pamela Flitton - a compellingly unlovable piece of work who manages to have destructive sexual encounters with almost every male character. It starts in Venice with Nicholas attending a conference on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, with action amongst Veronese frescos on the mainland and under an invented Tiepolo ceiling painting, with a little discussion of both painters. There's also much catching-up with what's happened since the previous volume, confirming my doubt that reading just this book would not be a good idea. There's more art and Americans than usual in the Venice half of this one. And the Americans remain for the second half, when the action returns to London and politics.\n\nThere was also a frustratingly short TV adaptation of the series.\n\nJuan Manuel de Prada The Tempest A naive young Spanish art historian arrives in Venice to study Giorgione's The Tempest, a painting which has obsessed him for years, and about which he has written a long thesis attempting the explaining of its many mysteries. But his arrival in a damp, misty, wintry Venice is marked by a murder, and he soon becomes embroiled in forgery, theft, murder and marriage. Our hero is an annoyingly pompous and sexist prig, whose experiences serve, of course, to shake his intellectual prejudices and teach him to feel a little more, and to suffer. The book is admittedly a page-turner for its evocation of damp and misty canals and its satisfyingly twisty plot, but the suspicion remains that it may not just be the hero who is revealing his pomposity and un-PC attitudes, and the author does look more than a little self-obsessed in his back-cover photograph.\n\nThis was filmed in 2004, but it didn't make it to UK screens (or DVD boxes). A DVD is available in Germany.\n\nBarbara Quick Vivaldis Virgins\n\nThis is the tale told by violinist Anna Maria of her early life at the Ospedale della Pietà and of the training that leads to her becoming one of the most accomplished musicians from the famous orphanage. Vivaldi's links to the Pietà, and his writing of music especially to test and stretch the performers, has become part of the mythology of the place and the composer. The author here takes this story, and the fresh research into the women of the pieta by Mickey White, and fleshes it out into a novel that stays true to the facts, but also adds a bit of spicy conjecture and imagination. The writing is sharp and spicy too, and the Venetian detailing and atmosphere are faultless. The story is a bit usual in its dealing with a girl's coming of age in a cloistered environment, and discovering who her friends are. But she is also discovering who her mother is, and discovering Venice in infrequently taken, and frequently punished-for, trips to palazzos and the ghetto and the like. Vivaldi is convincingly painted, and we get to meet Scarlatti, Handel, and Tiepolo too. The characters, famous and not, live and breath effortlessly though, and the reader is never less than enthralled and convinced.\n\nThe image to the left is the mark branded onto girls left at the Pieta.\n\nAlan Peat House of Cards\n\nThis shortish ebook tells a tale in the spooky style of Susan Hill, only better - better than her Venice-set tale reviewed above anyway. It gives much better Venice, spun as it is around the cursed Palazzo Dario on the Grand Canal. If I tell you it concerns a Venetian psychiatrist and the love he loses to the dark power of the palazzo and how, years later, a woman enters his office looking uncannily like this lost love you'll predict another story of love, sex, and violent death - not exactly a rarity amongst Venice-set fiction. But this is a well-written page-turner with, as I say, much authentic Venetian atmosphere and detail. There's a dream-sequence wedding in the Miracoli church, for example, that I'm sure will jump back into your mind when you next visit. There's a tendency towards long-word overwriting in the early chapters, but this is far from inappropriate to the narrator, so we'll be forgiving. Well worth the download, if you have a Kindle.\n\nMax Pemberton Signors of the night\n\nThe story of Fra Giovanni, the soldier-monk of Venice; and of others in the \"silent city\".Now an ebook fan I may be, but real books can sometimes be so damn...real. Here we have a book published in 1899, and it's the original edition I'm reading. It smells funny, it's got brown patches and odd spots, illustrations that make you frown, and a pencil note, added sometime during the last 112 years, pointing out that the book thinks that Giudecca is spelt Guidecca. (One of the illustrations I've scanned is below. Another is on the Fictional Cities Facebook page.) The note-scribbler then goes on to correct various lapses in Italian naming throughout the book. The book is made up of eight connected tales set in the first few years of the 18th century and all featuring Fra Giovanni, a monk with a sword and a way with cunning stratagems. The running theme/obsession is Venice's 'famous' mistrust of priests, but the plots all concern plots, bandits, bravos, and the like. Also heavily featured is the beautiful daughter of the Piazzetta's resident clown, who is every time described (in herself generally and with regard to whatever body part is being mentioned) as little. The sexual politics (if you'll pardon the anachronism) do not bear examination generally. It's all very dated and a bit creaky, but has charm and gothic oddness aplenty. I wouldn't classify it as a lost classic ripe for reprinting, more an eccentric relic whose object-ness means that a Kindle file just wouldn't be the same.\n\nAndrea Perego The Laws of Time Translated by Edward Smith\n\nWe begin with many scene-setting pages detailing dawn breaking and Venice waking. This signals the beginning of a book where the action spans a single day, the 9th of November 1730, albeit a single day with a morning full of exposition. Catterina is the daughter of a man more loving than practical, more sensitive than sensible. When her father dies she allies her family name to some much-needed money when she marries an older man. The marriage is comfortable if not passionate and she finds solace in solitude, reading and art. And as the mother of two small children motherhood is also not the centre of her life. The day we're dropping in on sees Catterina preparing for a party, but with dark shadows to contend with too. Not an unusual scenario, then, but with enough that's unpredictable to keep your attention. The detailing is faultless, but there is a tendency to comprehensive in the detail that you might find annoying (the frocks and cosmetics) or fascinating (the art collection). Pages of background to the political state of Venice are at least relevant to the story, and to the content of the contentious and suspicious letters around which the plot revolves. Rosalba Carriera makes her much-announced appearance heading to the party, and she tells her fellow attendees much about her time in Vienna, which has nothing to do with the plot, which is then all cleared up when the source of the letters is questioned by Catterina - pfft! - that's it, all over, which surprised me as my ebook was telling me I had an hour's reading left, but you won't be surprised that this was down to the author providing pages and pages and pages of background facts. Not so much a novel, then, as a thickness of history and incidental detail hanging around a thin plot.\n\nEllis Peters Holiday with ViolenceFour friends on a hilly walking holiday meet a nice Italian man on a crowded Italian train and then he gets bashed on the head and robbed, they find his lifeless body, and so begin to get followed by two mysterious men. To Venice. This was published in 1952 and couldn't read more arkily if it written in the 1850s. The chums have names like Phylida, Mab and Punch, the locals are described as gay (and one of them is also queer) and the effect is like a more true-to-life Famous Five adventure - all very upper-middle class but also psychologically quite astute. It transports you back to a time when teenagers where just young adults, plots involving stolen diamonds were still very fashionable and grown ups who are not yet senile could address each other as 'poppet' without being laughed at. Venice is also a different world, where there are still poor people and grubby urchins and Burano is depressing and squalid and the lace is produced by zombie-like child labourers. The gondoliers are mostly elderly, too, and gondolas transport visitors from the boat stop into the centre of Torcello. All very enjoyable if read in the right frame of mind. Venice is reached exactly half way through the novel, and is duly admired and glowingly described. The descriptive passages do tend to be rather long and purple, to be honest. There are several chases, one involving gondolas and the overall effect can best be described as ripping. The showdown at the end I found oddly and creepily sexualised though.\n\nJane Turner Rylands Across the Bridge of Sighs It wasn't easy approaching this book of stories with an open mind, after all the fuss of the author's feud with John Berendt, which I reported here. But I must have managed it, because I enjoyed it. The stories cover oddly similar ground to Berendt's book as they deal with the lives of present-day Venetians and the various plights facing the city itself. The characters are mostly prosperous, be they old money or new media types, and their lives and the stories are linked by events and palazzos - the most pervasive of the former being that most un-Venetian of tragedies, the fatal car crash. There's a tinge of the glitz-novel in places as the money flows and grows, but it would be unfair to class this as embossed-cover fare. The characters live and do real stuff - the trip to the hypermarket by the woman who ordinarily would send a servant has an authentic whiff. And as for the character who's supposed to represent John Berendt, a journalist called Cad Peacock, well I wouldn't have expected a hate-figure to have been represented as quite such a likeable character, for a journalist.\n\nLisa St Aubin de Terán The Palace\n\nThe story begins with Gabriele del Campo, a young stonemason, in jail and about to be shot for fighting for Garibaldi's unified Italy. He escapes the bullet, and with the help of his cellmate Colonel Giovanni Vitelli, survives and learns the ways of the gentry. Upon his release Gabriele goes to Venice and waits for Vitelli, all the while amassing riches using his luck and gambling skills. He dreams of building a palace worthy of his lost love Donna Donnatella and of having it ready for her return into his life. The names and ambitions and means to ends all give this book an allegorical feel, and a scope we like in such tales. Venice is evoked so that you can almost feel and smell it - unfortunately it's evoked as a thing of slime and decay, so you don't really want to stroke it, but let's not carp at such a fragrantly evoked version of our favourite city. I liked the detail that Gabriele likes Venice because he fears horses and Venice is free of horses. If you like your books with the feel of a fable about them you'll like this one.\n\nRob Samborn The Prisoner of Paradise\n\nThe concept of a painting speaking to one is not an unusual one, but it is for young Nick O'Connor. He's a jock, although his wife, Julia, is an artist, well a photographer, in Venice to make herself known at the biennale. Whilst visiting the Doge's Palace a woman in the Tintoretto Paradiso speaks to Nick, in Venetian, with the consequent doubts raised as to his sanity. His behaviour in front of the painting stirs a shady Venetian secret society into action, which sets a certain Dan Brown vibe developing, but this book is not so badly written. Nick and Julia's lovey-dovey establishing exchanges are a bit too much for my taste, and I could've done without the fashionable torture scenes. Also the topographical detail doesn't exactly convince me that the author's spent much time in Venice. But the plot rattles along in an involving and pleasantly perplexing way. There's lots of action and blood, betraying the story's origins as a film screenplay and hence a very visual conception.\n\nTiziano Scarpa Stabat Mater\n\nThe 2008 glut of novels about Vivaldi was followed by this short novel in 2009, which won the Strega Prize in Italy that year, but it has taken until now (August 2011) to appear in English. Like the others the concentration is on the orphan girls of the Pieta, this time a violin player called Cecilia. The novel takes the form of the foundling girl's stream of thoughts and her mental letters to her imagined mother. So we get pages of short paragraphs, beginning with Cecilia's dark ponderings on death and her unknown mother and eventually (about half way in) Vivaldi appears and the power of music wins out. The early stages are dominated by her unexplained obsession with death, and by defecation. (The latter subject also featuring strongly and fragrantly in the author's book about Venice Venice is a fish.) It's all very 'poetical' and plotless with very little description, even when Cecelia ventures out into the exciting world beyond the Pieta. Venice isn't even named, in fact, and neither is Vivaldi. Occasionally I was almost moved, but the style left me feeling uninvolved and, I'm sorry, my attention was often set aimlessly drifting.\n\nFriedrich von Schiller The Man who sees Ghosts\n\nMore famous as a dramatist, this is Schiller's only novel and was, says the blurb, his most popular work. It tells the story of a German prince in 18th century Venice and his downfall, brought about by his susceptibility to things occult and broadly spiritual. It could have been set anywhere, but I suppose Venice works best as a location for deception and the labyrinthine. A fair amount of the action takes place on Giudecca (featuring a garden and an unnamed church, possibly the Redentore) and, of course, in Piazza San Marco, but the Venice locations are not unusual, described or really the point. The plot is full of the occult and the mysterious and so reflects the tastes of the time, but are dealt with in a way that's more cerebral than spooky. I think that the novel is more about spiritual weakness and susceptibility than the investigation of the effect of murky Catholicism on protestant sensibilities that the blurb pushes. (Saying that the book has a climax of shocking violence and death is more than a little dishonest too.) It's a book t"
