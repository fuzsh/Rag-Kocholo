        "text": "Why is Wham! Last Christmas dated 07th Jan 2021 ?????. It shouldnt even be week ending jan 7th. Its first day of sales was Christmas Day so surely it was no. 1 for the chart dated week ending 31st Dec 2020. Why is it a week ahead of what it really is. The fact is, it was calulated sales and stream up to midnight on 31st December, so surely thats the date, if it was announced on Jan 1st. The UK chart appears to be going all american and dating themselves a week or two in the future. As if we hadnt enough of controversy with downloads and streams, now the dates are been changed?\n\nWould the British charts company please explain there Chart R/Entry rules.\n\nI have always understood that a \"R/E\" was not counted as an official No 1 even thou it occupies the same spot!\n\nBruno Mars Uptown Funk made No1 on the Dec 20th 2014=1284th UK No1\n\nGet https://lyricsnstatus.xyz/ for free.\n\nBen Haenow I Something I need made No1 Dec 27th=1285th\n\nBruno Mars Re-enters the chart on 3rd Jan but Does not get 1286th No1 because it's classed as a R/E\n\nThe 1286th UK No1 goes to Ellie Gouldings Love me like you do on the 14th Feb 2015=1286th UK No1 thus chronologically is the First UK No1 of 2015.\n\nWho's come across the ... \"Every Official UK Number 1 Ever\" playlist on Spotify?\n\nSorry Official Charts People but your list is nowhere near complete--and I don't mean up-to-date The omission of double A-sided hits (plenty of those down the years) and tracks listed equally on EPs makes this a less-than-complete list.\n\nFor instance, how can you leave off \"Eleanor Rigby\" or \"We Can Work It Out\". As for some artists, they're not even in the list! Picking out one...I realise Demis Roussos isn't every one's pop idol, but he made the top of the UK charts with a four-track EP. Your list doesn't even have the most popular of those four tracks, \"Forever and Ever\". Or how about the excellent \"Guns of Navarone\" track from The Specials A.K.A. Live EP?\n\nThe list is a great idea... just finish it off and make it a COMPLETE list. Oh, and in chronological order too would be very nice, then we can truly enjoy ALL the UK Number i hits EVER.\n\nWould the British charts company please explain there Chart R/Entry rules.\n\nI have always understood that a \"R/E\" was not counted as an official No 1 even thou it occupies the same spot!\n\nBruno Mars Uptown Funk made No1 on the Dec 20th 2014=1284th UK No1\n\nBen Haenow I Something I need made No1 Dec 27th=1285th\n\nBruno Mars Re-enters the chart on 3rd Jan but Does not get 1286th No1 because it's classed as a R/E\n\nThe 1286th UK No1 goes to Ellie Gouldings Love me like you do on the 14th Feb 2015=1286th UK No1 thus chronologically is the First UK No1 of 2015.\n\nNow we have a similar situation with mister Biebers What do you Mean gets the No1 slot on 10th Sept=1301st UK No1\n\nSigalas Easy Love on 17th Sept=1302nd UK No1\n\nBieber R/E the chart on Sept 24th as a R/entry\n\nNow who is going to be the 1303rd UK No1 this coming friday, but one thing is for sure it won't be Justin Biebers What do you mean!\n\nFor anyone who is still not sure about this..visit the site below\n\n(http://bittersuiteband.com/music_uk-no1-hits-singles.htm)\n\nAs of 17th May, there have been seven different number ones. By this time last year, there had already been fourteen different number ones, including Happy, which was number one on three different occasions. Such a change in such a short time. Could the streaming be affecting the top of the charts that much?"
