        "text": "This essay picks up the idea of Sullivan’s Travels occupying a special position in Sturges’ corpus as well as in the US film history, but with rationality different from Cavell and Henderson’s. My initial interest for writing about the film was incited by its equivocal, at times contradicting, intentions blended into a single text. The film makes an argument about the necessity of comedy in society in a tongue-in-cheek manner, within the generic framework of comedy. Added to this, the film calls my attention to its ultimate celebration of comedy in the final scene, also as a final seal of irony for such fact. This essay has two interconnected objectives. My first objective is to describe a fundamentally unsettling quality I find in Sullivan’s Travels, seeking to make sense of the film as an eclectic text of comedy, combining traces of different species within the genre, from slapstick, screwball, romantic comedy, satire to high comedy. The film is not only a turning point in Sturges’ career, but also a rare instance embodying the effort of someone working within the confines of institutional norms to seek for unconventional moves to attempt reflexive statements on the status quo of genre and industry. My second objective is to dialog with Bazin and Truffaut’s evaluative position on the film’s achievement and failure, grounded in certain assumptions for desirable cinema.\n\nThis article rethinks the emergence of narrative film syntax through the comedy genre, focusing on slapstick films that depict female unruliness. I discuss films featuring Mabel Normand, Florence Turner, Marie Dressler, Sarah Duhamel, and other forgotten silent comediennes, arguing that these women's performances played crucial roles in orchestrating transitions in industrial film form. Focusing on a comparison between the French Pathé and American Vitagraph companies, I examine the variety of techniques deployed to try to rationalize or contain the unruly bodily gestures of slapstick comedienne performers — most of whom have now dropped out of historical visibility entirely. I frame this comparative analysis through close readings of two key texts: a Vitagraph trick film, Princess Nicotine; or, The Smoke Fairy (dir. J. Stuart Blackton, 1909), which depicts the surrealistic plight of a male cigar smoker who gets pestered by two micrographic nicotine fairies; and a Pathé slapstick comedy, Betty Pulls the Strings (dir. Roméo Bosetti, 1910), about a madcap female trickster whose pranks wreak mass anarchy. Whereas films like Princess Nicotine micromanage their comediennes' unruly bodily performances in order to execute their trick techniques, films like Betty let their comediennes run wild in front of the camera, instead making sense of their irrational behavior through postproduction editing. Comedy has always haunted the emergence of cinema both as a narrative storytelling medium and as an international industry. Here, I analyze how unruly women and uncomfortable experiences of laughter provided coconspirators for legitimizing the motion picture's nascent storytelling vocabulary.\n\nDuring World War II Hollywood released several anti-fascist comedies that ignited an industry debate over the acceptable limits of ‘permissible parody’ during wartime. When reviewing these films, many critics fretted over whether comedy was an appropriate mode of representation for probing fascism’s power dynamics. This debate took place within a broader discussion about aesthetics, progressive politics, and mass media in a time of war. This essay analyzes how the production and reception of anti-fascist comedies were shaped by the twin pressures of war and censorship. The period’s film criticism will be placed within a larger social context that included the industry’s self-censoring Production Code Administration (PCA), and the propagandizing mandate of the Office of War Information (OWI), the wartime agency tasked with communicating the Roosevelt administration’s war aims through media. By examining studio correspondence with the PCA, official OWI documents and panel discussions from the 1943 Writers’ Congress, I argue that a patriotic decorum grounded in universalism and realism emerged in the latter years of the war as the dominant mode of anti-fascist representation. Ironically, this patriotic decorum ignored how audiences processed war-themed content while eliding how censors, critics, and propagandists positioned the medium as a vehicle for wartime propaganda."
