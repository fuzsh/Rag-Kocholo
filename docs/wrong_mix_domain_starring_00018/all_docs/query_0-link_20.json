        "text": "Hugh Grant has been in some great movies, that’s no secret. With an IMDB page that includes favorites like Bridget Jones’s Diary, Two Weeks Notice, and Notting Hill it’s not hard to figure out why he’s a constant staple in blockbuster hits. In honor of Grant’s 56th birthday, we’re taking a look back at the film so good that nothing can beat it: the 2003 Christmastime classic, Love Actually.\n\nThe beloved film follows a number of interconnected stories in London at Christmastime including a has-been musician making a come back, a writer who falls for his foreign housekeeper, and a man who is in love with his best friend’s girl. Grant plays David, the newly elected prime minister, who is striving to prove himself amidst doubt and with a very distracting secretary named Natalie (Martine McCutcheon).\n\nWhile Grant’s role is often overlooked in favor of Andrew Lincoln‘s declaration of love to Keira Knightley via sign and under the guise of being a carol singer — which is freaking adorable and worthy of a lot of attention — it really shouldn’t be.\n\nFrom Grant’s first scene in the film where he meets his new assistant and soon-to-be love interest, Natalie, he is a scene stealer. He handles it like a champ when the extremely nervous Natalie calls him by his first name and begins speaking in such a way more suited to a rowdy bar than the prime minister’s home.\n\nWhat truly makes this film the best of Grant’s career is his storyline with the story line with the American president, played by Billy Bob Thorton. When the president comes to Britain and refuses to listen to or take into account any of Britain’s needs or wants, David decides he’s had enough of being the cordial guy and the genial country.\n\nIn front of the press, David lists all of Britain’s greatest accomplishments — including Shakespeare, The Beatles, Harry Potter, and both of David Beckham’s feet — and declares, “A friend who bullies us is no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward I will be prepared to be much stronger.” Basically David drops the mic, disses the president, and it’s perfect.\n\nBut the perfection doesn’t end there, on the contrary it only gets better when David decides to celebrate his epic diss by dancing throughout his home. Yes, that’s right, the British prime minister dances around his house to “Jump” by the Pointer Sisters — with moves that any millennial in a club would be jealous of, no less — and it’s pure magic.\n\nThe movie continues its adorable streak, climaxes when David and Natalie are caught in a fairly compromising position during a children’s holiday concert, and ends with a nearly too adorable for film reunion of the love birds at Heathrow Airport in the film’s ending moments.\n\nHappy birthday Hugh Grant! Thank you for gracing us with sick burns, truly spectacular dance moves, and a love story for the ages."
