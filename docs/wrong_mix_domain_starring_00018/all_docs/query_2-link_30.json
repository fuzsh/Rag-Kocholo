        "text": "Jeri Jacquin\n\nComing to 4K Ultra HD, Bluray and Digital from writer/director Richard Curtis and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment celebrating its 20th Anniversary comes the beloved new classic for the holidays with LOVE ACTUALLY.\n\nEnglish Rock n’ Roller Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) is making a statement for Christmas bringing his own unique version of the song Love Is All Around. He promotes it but makes it very clear that it is horrible and he doesn’t mind in the slightest. Rather than party the night away, he joins his bff Joe (Gregor Fisher) for a night of drinking.\n\nMark (Andrew Lincoln) is the camera man on the day of friend Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and his love Juliet (Keira Knightley). Peter wonders why Mark seems to dislike his chosen bride but Mark is keeping a heartfelt and longing secret. Jamie (Colin Firth) discovers that his relationship is over, gets away to a cottage to write and meets Aurelia (Lucia Moniz). She doesn’t speak English which gives Jamie some relief except for one thing, words aren’t always necessary.\n\nHarry (Alan Rickman) runs an agency with Mia (Heike Makatsch) as his secretary. Wife Karen (Emma Thompson) is a stay-at-home Mom who makes sure the ship runs smoothly with their two children Bernard and Daisy (Lulu Popplewell). Harry seems to have become caught in a web that Mia is spinning and Karen is the one that gets caught in it surprised by a Christmas morning present. Also at the agency is Sarah (Laura Linney) who happens to be crushing on Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) but is dealing with the issues of her brother.\n\nDavid (Hugh Grant) just happens to be Prime Minister and Karen’s brother. At 10 Downing Street there are a lot of people and Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) is one of them. Together they work well until David begins to wonder if there is more and doesn’t want to be accused of any impropriety. Sometimes the heart wins.\n\nColin (Kris Marshall) decides he is only going to find love in America and ends up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. John (Martin Freeman) works as a film stand-in and meets Judy (Joanna Page) while doing love scenes. Both seem comfortable with one another and John discovers he can say how he feels.\n\nDaniel (Liam Neeson) is taking care of his young stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) after the passing of his wife. Sam is going through his own heart story with the very cute school girl Joanna (Olivia Olson). Speaking with Daniel about it all, Sam wonders how best to get her attention, especially since she is moving away soon.\n\nNeeson, Rickman, Firth, Nighy, Grant and Lincoln, Freeman, Marshall, Santoro, Ejiofor, and Fischer what can I say boys? Your storylines are wonderful and I couldn’t get enough of the wisdom from a step-father toward a boy who he sees as no step but just a wonderful son, to a PM who can shuffle with the best, to a man who will speak the language of love, to an aged rock star, to a man who should know better than to flirt with trouble and a man who knows when to hide his heart – you are all perfectly flawed human beings and we wouldn’t have you any other way.\n\nThompson, Page, Olson, McCutcheon, Knightley, Makatsch and Linney – ladies, just brilliant. You carry the light of family and see the frailty of husbands, to not being afraid of a powerful man, to discovering that a quiet love is closer than you think, to understanding that even though you may find love that other obligations can get in the way of the heart, to trying to take what isn’t yours, you are all women who make sacrifices in the name of dedication to love in all its forms and sometimes to the detriment.\n\nShout out to Rowan Atkinson as Rufus who kept me laughing the first time I saw the film and keeps me laughing still. I have never received a gift so well thought out and packaged and I’m not sure how I would react if I did however, if its Atkinson doing it – I’m all in!\n\nOther cast include Julia Davis as Nancy, Ruby Turner as Jean, Adam Godley as Mr. Trench, Michael Fitzgerald as Michael, Abdul Salis as Tony, Claudia Schiffer as Carol, Nina Sosanya as Annie, January Jones as Jeannie, Elisabeth Margoni as Eleonore, Meg Owen as Mary, Colin Coull as Gavin, Elisha Cuthbert as Carol-Anne, Ivana Milicevic as Stacey, Shannon Elizabeth as Harriet, Denise Richards as Carla, Marcus Brigstocke as Mikey, and Billy Bob Thornton as the U.S. President.\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment has just added an amazing film to their library and making it available for us to all experience and re-experience in our own home theaters. There are films of every genre available from scary to drama to family films. For more of what they have to offer please visit http://www.uphe.com.\n\nMOVIES ANYWHERE gives viewers the ability to download the Movies Anywhere App. With that you can view films by downloading or streaming to your favorite device using a Digital Code. For more information on Movies Anywhere please visit http://www.MoviesAnywhere.com.\n\nBonus Features include Making LOVE ACTUALLY – Join writer/director Richard Curtis along with the cast and crew as they reflect on the making of the film and its legacy twenty years later, Deleted Scenes with Introductions by Richard Curtis, The Music of LOVE ACTUALLY with Introductions by Richard Curtis, The Storytellers – A featurette exploring the film’s main storylines, featuring interviews with the cast discussing their characters and the major elements within each on-screen relationship.\n\nAlso included is Kelly Clarkson “The Trouble with Love is” Music Video, Bill Mack “Christmas is All Around” Music Video and Feature Commentary with Director Richard Curtis and Actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Thomas Sangsters.\n\nThis film stole my holiday heart when I first saw it in 2003, yes it started out because Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman were in it but man, the entire cast just gave me Christmas tingles. The story is so heartfelt and sticky sweet which I usually barf over but I couldn’t help myself, I fell in ornament hook, lights line and full stocking sinker. The cast is absolutely brilliant and each character having a story of their very own is stunning still.\n\nLook, I love me a good rom-com but LOVE ACTUALLY is so much more than that. Yes, it is on my Christmas stack of must-watch holiday movies after DIE HARD (get over it – think of it as an Alan Rickman double feature if you must). This film is about relationships, love, messiness of being a human being, whacky emotions trying to find the right places to settle, pushing the limits of the heart into places they/we are scared to go, and, of course the joy of Christmas that give us the extra push to say those three little words ‘I love you’ to someone who needs to hear it.\n\nThere is nothing, and I mean nothing that writer/director Curtis left out of this film. If anything was ever to be changed, I think I might have to throw a huge fit and Santa wouldn’t like that. It is a film of joy, love, celebration and by the end of the film, no matter how many times you watch it, the heart is just giggling with joy.\n\nSo, Happy Anniversary LOVE ACTUALLY, you have not aged a day and the world still loves you and isn’t that what it’s all about?\n\nIn the end – love is actually all around!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to Bluray, DVD and Digital from director Tommy Wirkola and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment is a different look about the man from the North Pole with VIOLENT NIGHT.\n\nThe holidays are here and Santa Claus (David Harbour) is disillusioned, disgusted and dismayed at what has happened to Christmas. Not his usual ho-ho-ho self, he does the minimum to get the job done and not with an ounce of jolly.\n\nJason Lightstone (Alex Hassell) gets wife Linda (Alexis Louder) to agree to go to mom Gertrude’s (Beverly D’Angelo) house for Christmas. Taking daughter Trudy (Leah Brady), it becomes clear quickly that there are family issues. Waiting for them is Jason’s sister Alva (Edi Patterson), her bad actor husband Morgan (Cam Gigandet) and son Bert (Alexander Elliot).\n\nThere is the usual sibling bickering about the family company and money. That is until all Christmas breaks loose as Mr. Scrooge (John Leguizamo) enters their festivities. He brings his band of merry gun-toting mercenary elves with only one mission – get money and go!\n\nThe problem is, they didn’t expect Santa to be in the house who catches on real quick that this is not the house to be visiting. Finding a radio, Santa hears Trudy on her radio telling him not only what she wants for Christmas but what is happening in the house. Wanting to walk away, there is something about Trudy that makes Santa decide that he needs to remember who he is and that makes all the difference.\n\nIt’s skull cracking time!\n\nHarbour as Santa Claus is hilarious, sweet, a little vicious but has a story to tell. Once the gang realizes there is a Santa in the house, the chase is on and Harbour gets down and dirty. That makes the film so much more fun in a twisted sort of way. It is next to impossible not to cheer for Harbour’s character and, to be honest, I was all for it. That is part of the fun of the film and trust when I say it is Harbour who makes it thrilling every frame of film.\n\nLeguizamo as Mr. Scrooge is a guy who has serious issues of his own. Money starts out being the motive for the madness but I suspect that Leguizamo’s characters issues run holiday deep. Deciding to go all out to get what he wants, there is nothing or no one, not even Santa that is going to stop this well-designed plan. Then again, Scrooge vs. Santa is a whole other knock down drag out.\n\nHassell as Jason wants his family back but has to go through a lot this night to see if that can happen. Louder as Linda knows the Lightstone family are a lot but puts it all aside to do the right thing for her daughter, bet she wished she had made other plans! Patterson as Alva is just one hot mess who thinks she has what it takes to take her own brother down, yea, about that…..! Gigandet as Morgan is that family member that just can’t help but show why everyone else rolls their eyes.\n\nBrady as Trudy is just a sweet young girl who wants her parents to be happy and spending Christmas together. When the chaos happens, she reaches out to Santa for help and does not seem surprised when he comes through. There is a bit of another film mixed into Brady’s characters bag of tricks and its pretty funny. Well done young lady, well done. Elliot as Bert portrays all the kids us older folk can’t stand to be around and he does it really well!\n\nLet’s talk about D’Angelo as Gertrude. She is saucy, mouthy and can take a hit. She knows what her family thinks of her and it doesn’t change anything about her naughty attitude. I just love this character and D’Angelo did it all with nothing short of bad attitude sprinkled with Christmas glitter!\n\nOther cast include Brendan Fletcher as Krampus, Mike Dopud as Commander Thorp, Stephanie Sy as Sugarplum, John Lowe as Pub Santa, Andre Eriksen as Bjorn, and Erik Athavale as Richard.\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment has just added an amazing film to their library and making it available for us to all experience and re-experience in our own home theaters. There are films of every genre available from scary to drama to family films. For more of what they have to offer please visit www.uphe.com.\n\nExclusive Bonus Feature include Deleted and Extended Scenes – Family Arrives at the Mansion, Jason and Linda in Bedroom, Krampus Sees Trudy’s Radio, Santa on the Roof, Walk to the Manger, Family Resolution, Bad Dad, Cast Call Back and Extended Scenes.\n\nAlso, Quarrelin’ Kringle – Cast and Crew Relay why David Harbour is the Perfect Brawler for this Combative Rendition of Santa. Santa’s Helpers: The Making of VIOLENT NIGHT – Tommy Wirkola and David Leitch has reunited for another madcap, violent fairytale with heart in VIOLENT NIGHT. This making-of will celebrate their spirited reunion as well as the other little helpers. Deck the Halls with Brawls – Go Behind the Action as we go Blow for Blow with the New Villains of Christmas.\n\nFinally, Feature Commentary with Directory Tommy Wirkola, Producer Guy Danella, Writer Pat Casey and Writer Josh Miller.\n\nVIOLENT NIGHT does not waste a moment and from beginning to end it is Harbour that is a mixture of comedy, drama and charming. Oh sure, Santa has a history and sure he seems like a crushing Ninja but that does not change the fact that he brings gifts to believers. Don’t get me wrong, the film is really violent, really bloody but it is also really hysterical.\n\nNow that being said, it has been quite a while since I’ve seen a film that had me cheering, making faces and dropping my jaw. Okay, so tried to close my eyes and ended up looking through my fingers at one point but darn it was fun. The cast assembled bring a holiday film that I will predict right now will become a holiday tradition (at least in my house).\n\nI think we found another twisted film to add to the family’s equally twisted Christmas binging tradition.\n\nIn the end – you better watch out!\n\nCurrently on DVD from director John McPhail and Cinedigm comes a biting end to the beginning of the holidays as we know it with ANNA AND THE APOCALYPSE.\n\nIn the town of Little Haven, Anna (Ella Hunt) is a young girl with big dreams out of high school. Unable to talk about it with Dad (Mark Benton), her big plans include traveling with a ticket hidden from view. The only other person who knows is best friend John (Malcom Cummings) who supports her but has a secret of his own.\n\nSinging their way through teen angst, they are more involved in their mundane teenage-hood lives of unrequited love and parental misunderstandings to notice something different going on. That is until they see a snowman who seems a little friendlier than it should be but Anna takes care of it.\n\nWalking through town they notice the destruction and everyone heads for the school. Anna and John meet up with Steph (Sarah Swire) and Chris (Christopher Leveaux) at the local bowling alley. The Headmaster (Paul Kaye) has a group locked down at school telling everyone it will be fine.\n\nTrying to pass the time, Chris and John wonder who has been turned from the upsetting thought that Robert Downey, Jr. and Taylor Swift might be among the undead! Anna and Sarah are just trying to keep the bowling dead off of them.\n\nEven in the midst of destruction and no internet access (selfie withdrawn imminent), the group still has the one thing the shuffling dead can’t take from them – breaking out into lamenting song!\n\nHunt as Anna first of all has an amazing singing voice but even more than that she has a presence that I just love. Portraying Anna as a strong young woman who questions everything but still knows that she wants to experience more than the town of Little Haven, Hunt nails it.\n\nCumming as John as the look of a young man in love and not knowing the rules of how to make that known. Joining in with Anna, he tries to put his mind in a different place because zombies aren’t exactly in his life lane. I love his portrayal of John because in the midst of chaos there is a little bit of a sweet naivetés.\n\nSwire as Steph is dealing with her own issues feeling as if her parents dumped her in this little town and no one understands her. This actress also has an amazing voice as well and her snide comments and standoffish attitude is one that servers her will during this unusual holiday film.\n\nLeveaux as Chris is the zombie resident expert on how to avoid getting bit and seems to be enjoying it all a little too much. Another great surprise here is Ben Wiggins as Nick, notably the school jock, he certainly knows how to swing a bat and is having a good time with his boys fighting the zombie war and singing about it too.\n\nOther cast include: Marli Siu as Lisa, Sean Connor as Graham, John Winchester as Tibbsy, Euan Bennet as Jake, Ella Jarvis as Katie, Janet Lawson as Mrs. Hinzmann, Ruth McGhie as Bea, Kirsty Strain as Ms. Wright, Therese Bradley as Julie, Jake Richardson as Chas and Paul Kaye as Arthur Savage.\n\nCINEDIGM has strategic relationships with over 60,000 physical retail storefronts and digital platforms with Wal-Mark, Target, iTunes, Netflix, and Amazon as well as national cable and satellite Video On Demand with an impressive distribution footprint that reaches ninety-three percent of all connected devices in the United States. The company’s vast content library boasts over 52,000 feature films and television episodes. To learn more please visit www.cinedigm.com.\n\nThe DVD includes the Bonus Feature of ANNA & THE APOCALYPSE: Behind the Scenes.\n\nANNA & THE APOCALYPSE might just become a holiday classic in my home. We love all things zombie but this, THIS has everything else. From teen singing and dancing to surviving the holidays in a unique way, the film doesn’t mind adding a little camp like sprinkles on holiday sugar cookies.\n\nTrying to reach their families for holiday dinner is kind of like fighting traffic through L.A. on Christmas Eve – except they are on the menu! The film had me laughing, toe tapping, rooting for the teenagers (I know, I mean what???) and feeling like this is the Undead Breakfast Club meets High School Musical.\n\nThe film is also about friendships, truth, the craziness of being a teen, family, loss and discovering that each of them isn’t so different than the other. One thing we can all be sure is that a zombie apocalypse can certainly bring out the good and bad in them all.\n\nOne thing is for certain, they are all in this together and they don’t care about the naughty or nice part of the holidays.\n\nIn the end – zombies are coming to town!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to Bluray/DVD and Digital HD along with STX Films and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment is the return of our favorite ladies to show us how to be part of A BAD MOMS CHRISTMAS.\n\nThe holidays have arrived and Amy (Mila Kunis) is hoping to have a quiet and comfy holiday with daughter Jane (Oona Laurence), son Dylan (Emjay Anthony) and boyfriend Jessie (Jay Hernandez) and his daughter Lori (Ariana Greenblatt). Carla (Kathryn Hahn) and Kiki (Kristen Bell) are also trying to hold down the home front.\n\nOf course plans don’t apply to their Moms! Amy is distressed when Mom Ruth (Christine Baranski) shows up with Dad Hank (Peter Gallagher) in tow. Carla is happily surprised when Mom Isis (Susan Sarandon) arrives and Kiki breaks out in a sweat when Mom Sandy (Cheryl Hines) arrives wearing her face on a sweater.\n\nKnowing this is going to be a holiday for the books, Amy, Kiki and Carla decide there is only one thing to do – have drink and do a little tearing up for themselves. Making sure they vent to each other before the madness gets out of hand, they make sure to do one last thing before leaving the mall because, well, Amy needs a tree!\n\nAmy and mom don’t waste any time annoying each other as Ruth continually tells her daughter that she obviously doesn’t care about giving her kids an amazing Christmas. Kiki can not handle the smothering mom Sandy is doing to the point of visiting a therapist! Carla is thrilled to have her rebel mom around but Isis has her own agenda for the holiday visit.\n\nAll three women are pushed daily to their limits and it comes to a freeze when each must decide how to handle their respective mothers with boundaries and maybe a bit of alcohol as well.\n\nOkay, a lot of alcohol!\n\nKunis as Amy is doing pretty well with her life and obviously happy with the continued relationship with Jessie. All seems to be going great with a quiet Christmas but that changes when Mom in the form of Christine Baranski, shows up. I love the combination of these two ladies as mother and daughter. Baranski is perfectly annoyingly adorable as Ruth and I wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nHahn as Carla is, and it I have to admit this, is my favorite character of the three ladies. Probably because she doesn’t hold back much in the way of sarcasm and the joy of just loving life. Also, can I be any happier that she finds something special in the way of the very talented Ty played by Justin Hartley of This is Us television drama fame. Sarandon as Isis is also the perfect Mom to Carla and I also loved her calling b.s. when she heard it.\n\nBell as Kiki found herself in the first BAD MOMS and it shows in this film. Having a little more control over her life, that gets a little setback when Mom Sandy shows up. What is even more frightening is that Bell and Hines are perfection together! Hines uses that mom-guilt to its highest level and I’m thrilled when Kiki remembers who she is and sets her life straight again!\n\nIt’s nice to see Hernandez return as Jessie and put up with all the nonsense that Amy’s mother brings to the holidays. Gallagher as Amy’s Dad spends the film just letting things go along until he finally has a say about it all – and it’s pretty sweet. Lawrence returns as Jane who knows how to push Amy’s buttons, Anthony as Dylan loves the gifts and Cade Cooksey returns as Carla’s son Jaxon.\n\nUniversal Studios Home Entertainment has just added an amazing film to their library and making it available for us all to experience and re-experience in our own home theatres. There are films of every genre available from scary to drama to family films. For more of what they have to offer please visit www.uphe.com.\n\nThe Bluray/DVD Features include an awesome Gag Reel, Additional Scenes, Crew Music Video and Trailers. Digital HD allows us all to watch anywhere we like on our televisions, computers, Tablets and even Smartphones.\n\nBeing busy over the holidays I didn’t have the opportunity to see this film in theatres so having the opportunity to see the Bluray was so much fun. I laughed so hard and couldn’t believe some of the topics these ladies decided to cover – including the apparently un-awkward talk between Carla, Ty and some hot wax. Yes, look for that because it’s worth ever jaw-dropping moment!\n\nWe have all had those moments during the holidays where the pressure makes us crazy, the gift buying is overwhelming, the gatherings mean baking as if we all don’t have enough to do and the star on the tree top is trying to remember that we love our crazy families no matter what.\n\nThese three ladies give us a few lessons on how to handle it all as A BAD MOM’S CHRISTMAS gives us 11 months to prepare!\n\nIn the end – celebrate the next holiday like a mother!\n\nWant a chance to add this holiday fun to your own home entertainment library? Please visit http://moviemaven.homestead.com and find out how!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nThis week on Bluray from writer John Hughes, director Chris Columbus and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment is a signal that the holidays are upon us with HOME ALONE 2 Lost in New York.\n\nOnce again the Christmas season is here and there is a mad dash to the airport for the McCallisters. Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) becomes confused and separated from his family. Taking the plane he thinks his family is on, Kevin ends up in the Big Apple!\n\nChecking into a swanky hotel, Kevin takes advantage of life in the big city and a twitchy hotel manager Mr. Hector (Tim Curry) to live it up a little. He meets the Pigeon Lady (Brenda Fricker) in the park and after hearing her story knows things must change. He also is drawn to a toy store owned by E.F. Duncan (Eddie Bracken) that is magical for many.\n\nHe also sees Harry (Joe Pesci) & Marv (Daniel Stern), the burglars who made his life difficult back home and learns what they have planned – and it isn’t good. When Harry and Marv see Kevin – their lust for revenge brings them right into the hands of a master kid who knows how to set traps!\n\nIn the meantime mom Kate (Catherine O’Hara) and dad Peter (John Heard) realize they have once again lost their son and will do what they have to when it comes to having the family together for the holidays.\n\nIt is another McCallister Christmas to remember!\n\nCulkin as Kevin is now and forever the kid who brought a twist to Christmas and also brought this series of films into everyone’s holiday. Now that the film is on Bluray, it means that family’s can actually plan a movie night that includes the antics of Kevin and the gang. In this film Culkin is still that kid who has a twinkle in his eye and really isn’t afraid of much once he gets it in his head that no one is going to ruin another holiday!\n\nPesci as Harry is hilarious, continually and amazingly hilarious. Of course Pesci can play a bad guy with the best of them as he has proven over and over again. When it comes to comedy, Pesci is equally as talented and no one can say differently. Stern as Marv is the guy who follows along with everything – even when it knows it might not end well. I love Stern in this role because he has such a childlike quality and yes, he sure can do a pratfall like no one else!\n\nFricker as the Pigeon Lady is lovely, endearing, sweet and reminds me of the bird-lady in Mary Poppins. I don’t mind that at all because she gives Kevin focus on the true meaning of love and friendship – even with bird droppings on her shoulder. Bracken as E.F. Duncan is a man who still has a heart for the holidays and an even bigger heart for knowing what his city needs.\n\nO’Hara as Kate is a mother on a mission as she once again navigates the terror that is getting home. Heard as Peter seems less stressed but then again Kate has enough for everyone.\n\nIt must be said that seeing Tim Curry in the role of the Concierge is nothing short of fantastic. His facial expressions are perfection and every scene he is in I savor. Yes, a Curry fan most definitely and in this film he deserves a shout out!\n\nOther cast include Devin Ratray as Buzz, Hillary Wolf as Megan, Maureen Shay as Linnie, Michael Maronna as Jeff, Gerry Bamman as Uncle Frank, and Terrie Snell as Aunt Leslie. The film also hosts Rob Schneider as the Bellman, Bob Eubanks as the Ding-Dang-Dong Host, Rip Taylor, Jaye P. Morgan, Jimmie Walker, and Ally Sheedy.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment brings award-winning global product and new entertainment to DVD, Bluray, and Digital HD.

Factory is a series that I have absolutely come to love and look forward to every episode with WHEN CALLS THE HEART: The Heart of Faith.\n\nElizabeth (Erin Krakow) is excited for the holiday season getting ready to come to Hope Valley. Now that Rosemary (Pascale Hutton) and Leland (Kavan Smith) are on their honeymoon, Elizabeth takes over putting the town festivities together.\n\nJack (Daniel Lissing) is also busy as the town comes together to finish completing homes for families that have come to Hope Valley. Also returning home is mayor Gowen (Martin Cummins) who isn’t about to make it a happy holiday for anyone.\n\nAbigail (Lori Loughlin) has sort of taken over the role of mayor dealing with issues as Gowen is under investigation and can’t even sit in the office chair. Trying to get his help, Abigail is met with anger and resistance and she isn’t sure how to turn it all around.\n\nBill (Jack Wagner) is now taking over the café and the customers aren’t complaining – openly that is. Pastor Frank (Mark Humphrey) is upset when it seems he can’t help a mother and son realize that Hope Valley is truly their home.\n\nIn the middle of it all, Jack has an important question he wants to ask Elizabeth but the town needs them both when the train with all the gifts and supplies is delayed until after Christmas. Watching it all is a peddler who seems to understand the town watching everyone come together.\n\nBut this is Hope Valley – and anything is possible.\n\nKrakow as Elizabeth is so dang charming its ridiculous. She has taken the role of Elizabeth Thatcher and given it everything we love about the storyline of Hope Valley and the residence. It is clear that this is her home and doing what ever she can to help those in need is warming. Krakow absolutely deserves such kudos for continuing to give us all so much warmth, fun and waiting for one special event to happen.\n\nLissing as Jack is dashing, charming and secretly the guy the ladies look for. Putting the needs of the town before anything else also means having special time with Elizabeth. He is quick to catch onto the bad guys and careful to jump into anything he is unsure of. Those are also charming qualities that make Lissing’s portrayal of Jack one that we bring us all back again and again.\n\nLoughlin as Abigail is in a little bit of a pickle when Gowen can no longer serve as mayor. She wants to do right by Hope Valley and this isn’t the time to guess at how it all goes. Wagner as Bill gets to bring in his comical side with this episode taking over the café while Abigail takes on the town.\n\nHutton as Rosemary is up to her usual perfectly normal nonsense. I swear Hutton just gives such life and silliness to this character and I can’t imagine her never being part of Hope Valley – oh and congrats Mrs. Coulter. Smith as Leland not only finds amusement with his new wife but jumps right in helping to build up the town.\n\nHumphrey as Pastor Frank finds himself in a bit of sadness when a family leaves Hope Valley because of bitter memories. Wanting to help them see that there is always hope, it is perhaps Pastor Frank that needs to remember what he preaches.\n\nSHOUT! Factory has grown into a tremendous multi-platform media company. Releasing new animated features such as the exquisite Long Way North, and the epic fantasy Beauty And The Beast. Also their own original horror film, Fender Bender gives fans a good scare. For more of what SHOUT Factor has to offer please visit www.shoutfactory.com.\n\nTUBS OF POPCORN: I give WHEN CALLS THE HEART: The Heart of Faith four and a half tubs of popcorn out of five. I’m saving that last half of a tub for something all fans are waiting for. Not to spoil it I’ll keep that to myself although it probably isn’t hard to figure out.\n\nWhat adds to the reason for the series success is not only the story but the costumes, the town set from the café to the schoolhouse and even the town jail. The dresses are stunning and beautiful and the uniform Jack wears causes a bit of swooning I’m thinking.\n\nThe story that has come from Janette Oke’s book which also comes from the Canadian West Series has such heart, soul and inspiration that its impossible not to fall for everything WHEN CALLS THE HEART has to offer. The series has come to us from Michael Landon Jr., which isn’t a surprise, and the Hallmark Channel.\n\nThis cast is so absolutely fun to watch that the day it ends I’m going to be broken hearted. I didn’t know what to expect from the very first season but find myself anticipating the next installment as this is an ensemble that has brought every viewer in and embraced each one.\n\nSo if you are looking for spirit, whether it is a holiday or not, then visit Hope Valley for a little inspiration and faith in humanity.\n\nIn the end – they bring us the heart of faith!"
