        "text": "Love Actually premiered in 2003, but two decades later, it remains a holiday rom-com we love to talk about to this day. Here’s a look back at the Love Actually cast, then vs. now — including the big names you might have forgotten were part of the enormous ensemble.\n\nSeven years after Love Actually, the British actor pivoted to a role that could not be more different than the festive rom-com: AMC’s The Walking Dead. He and much of the original Love Actually cast reunited for a Red Nose Day mini-sequel in 2017.\n\nKnightley was still a teenager at the start of her career during Love Actually. Since then, she’s starred in several iconic films — including Pride & Prejudice and the Pirates of the Caribbean films.\n\nIn addition to starring in the Doctor Strange films, Ejiofor made his feature directorial debut with 2019’s The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind.\n\nAlan Rickman is universally beloved, but his character in Love Actually is a little less so. Rickman played Harry, a husband and father who entertained an affair with a colleague, much to his wife’s (Emma Thompson) heartbreak.\n\nSadly, Rickman died of cancer in 2016. “It seemed like a miracle to me when Alan agreed to do our film ... as an actor he almost literally made every single word complex and interesting,” Love Actually writer-director Richard Curtis remembered.\n\nThompson may just be the heart of Love Actually — her character, Karen, is Harry’s wife, David’s sister, and Daniel’s (Liam Neeson) best friend.\n\nColin Firth and Lúcia Moniz play Jamie and Aurélia, the lonely writer and housekeeper who forge a strong romantic connection without speaking the same language.\n\nFirth went on to star in the two Mamma Mia! films and, most recently, HBO Max’s The Staircase, based on the real-life death of Kathleen Peterson.\n\nMost recently, Linney has been known for her turn as Wendy Byrde on Netflix’s Ozark, for which she received multiple Emmy nominations."
