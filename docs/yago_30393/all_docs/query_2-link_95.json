        "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Giants backup quarterback Drew Lock left New York's preseason opener late in the first quarter Thursday night against the Lions because of a hip injury, while Detroit backup Hendon Hooker sustained a concussion in the second half.\n\nLock, a six-year veteran who signed as a free agent in the offseason, went to his knees shortly after throwing a deep sideline pass on third down to Isaiah McKenzie with 2:03 left in the quarter in the Giants' 14-3 victory. He was looked at by trainers and went to the sideline.\n\nLock was 4 of 10 for 17 yards in getting the start with Daniel Jones and most of the offense sitting out. He was sacked two plays before leaving the field, but it was not clear when the injury happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nLocal hero Tommy DeVito replaced him for a fourth-down play from the Lions 39 but he only took a delay of game penalty and New York punted.\n\nLock said after the game he did not think the injury was serious and he could have gone back in if needed.\n\nLions coach Dan Campbell said Hooker was hurt on a run after leaving the pocket.\n\n“That’s what happens when you run, in this league, at the quarterback position,” Campbell said. “He was moving the football, I thought he was making some solid decisions before that. A lot of those were the runs. So, he made it happen with his legs.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nHooker and Nate Sudfeld are vying for the backup spot behind Jared Goff, who did not play in the opener.\n\nThe Lions also had second-year receiver Antoine Green sustain a concussion, defensive lineman David Bada had an Achilles' tenson injury and offensive lineman Connor Galvin hurt a knee. Bada and Galvin were carted off the field,\n\n___\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad"
