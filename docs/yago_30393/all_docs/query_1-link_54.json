This is the greatest blessing. We can't wait to see Palmer become a big sister,\" Natalie said. \"Thank you to our loved ones and loyal FOX 5 viewers for the support and well wishes!\"\n\nThere must be something in the water around the Good Day office, because Alyse Eady is also expecting a child - her third after big sister Sofia and big brother Wyatt - due in April.\n\nPlease join us in congratulating Natalie and Brad on the big news!"
