He is located in Regent’s Square, inside the Jack Russell Jewelers shop, on the west side of Market Square. When you’ve finished the side quest “Reckless Necklace” Ms. Marphely exclaims “You went to Jared’s”\n\nJared is a two-pronged Pop Culture reference; the first is to Kings Isle game designer Jared Banks, the second is to American jewelry store chain Jared.\n\nIn the “Reckless Necklace” Quest, Ms. Marphely is quite pleased that you took your jewelry business to Jared’s\n\nJared Banks has been working at KingsIsle for over fifteen years as a game designer from 2007-2012 and as a Senior Game Designer from 2012 to Present.\n\nClick the YouTube link for a commercial from Jared the Galleria of Jewelry.\n\nThis is the fiftieth article chronicling the #W101PopCulture references starting in Wizard City and the seventh Marleybone article. The current list of all the (known) Marleybone references are located here.\n\nAlthough I am well versed in Pop Culture references but I do not claim to have caught them all. Let me know your favorites in the comments and if I’ve missed one you caught, let me know so I can add it to the list.\n\nText for this article is excerpted from the linked wiki pages\n\nJared Banks, the Jeweler image is from Wizard101, and is copyright of KingsIsle Entertainment.\n\nJared Banks the Game Designer image is from his LinkedIn page."
