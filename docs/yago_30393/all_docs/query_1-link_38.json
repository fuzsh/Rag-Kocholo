Cape Breton traditional fiddle music originated in Scotland, and during the Early 19th Century, a number of highlanders set up camp in Cape Breton. The time when most were immigrating to Cape Breton was the time when fiddle playing in Scotland was at its ‘Golden Age’; hence the unique style of Cape Bretton Fiddle."
