        "text": "There is a lot new about the New England Patriots this football season. It's the first time in more than 20 years that Bill Belichick is not patrolling the sidelines, and Tom Brady is nothing more than a distant memory.\n\nThe new Patriots head coach is a familiar face. Former linebacker Jerod Mayo played eight seasons in a Patriots uniform under Belichick. Mayo was linebackers coach from 2019 to 2023.\n\nWhile Pats fans will be eyeing the sidelines to see if Mayo can fill the sweatshirt of the former Head Hoodie, the world will be watching to see what new Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is made of.\n\nDrake Lee Maye was born on August 30, 2002, in Huntersville, North Carolina, more than six months after Brady and the Patriots won their first-ever Super Bowl Championship. Let that sink in for a minute.\n\nMaye attended William A. Hough High School in Cornelius, North Carolina, and later transferred to Myers Park High in Charlotte. Maye was an award-winning football star and played basketball in high school.\n\nThe 6-4, 230-pound quarterback is also an accomplished laser tag player and enjoys listening to Chris Stapleton.\n\nMaye played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide in 2019 before transferring to North Carolina to join the Tar Heels. News 8 wtnh.com reported Maye was a sought-after college player.\n\nMark Maye, Drake's father, played quarterback for North Carolina and briefly for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Raleigh-Durham Skyhawks. Maye has three brothers. All are talented athletes.\n\nMaye was selected third overall by the New England Patriots in the 2024 NFL draft."
