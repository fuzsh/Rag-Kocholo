        "text": "They say it's the worst disease you've never heard of.\n\nEpidermolysis bullosa, or EB, is a rare condition that causes the skin to be very fragile and blister with the slightest touch, and a pair of cross-country cyclists from Toronto are raising awareness by biking over 2,000 km from Lacombe, Alta. to Thunder Bay, Ont.\n\nNatalie Buchanan has been living with the genetic condition her entire life. She and her boyfriend, Steve Gibbs, partnered with an organization called Debra Canada for the journey.\n\n'Part of this team': Jonathan Pitre and Sens find mutual inspiration\n\nOttawa Senators surprise Jonathan Pitre before second treatment\n\nJonathan Pitre set to pass another milestone on remarkable road to recovery\n\n\"We always knew I had the skin condition, but I wasn't specifically diagnosed until [age] eight or nine,\" Buchanan said. \"I have a really mild case, so I usually just get blisters on my feet which comes from constant friction of walking.\"\n\n\"So if I were to do like a five kilometer walk, I'd probably have to take a few days off because I wouldn't be able to walk the next day.\"\n\nBuchanan added that she feels lucky, as life can be difficult for individuals who have severe EB.\n\nGrowing up, Buchanan said she never met anyone with the same condition, and school friends always had a hard time understanding and field trips meant that she had to hold herself back, physically.\n\nDespite her struggles, Buchanan and Gibbs decided to embark on a grand adventure to raise awareness and money for the rare skin disease. Cycling from her hometown in Alberta all the way to northwestern Ontario, the couple said their original goal was to reach Sudbury, but due to timing, they decided to make Thunder Bay their final destination.\n\n\"It originally started with the idea of an adventure, but it morphed into a cycling trip, and then we decided to start where she was born in Alberta and make our way back,\" Gibbs said. \"We couldn't push 100 kilometres a day because then she would get a blister somewhere. So, we had to take our breaks, but we did it and we are pretty happy about it.\"\n\nHopefully [others] can be inspired to do something beyond what they think is possible.- Natalie Buchanan\n\nAfter researching the right kind of clothing, biking seat and gear, Gibbs said they headed off on their adventure just six weeks after they made their decision.\n\n\"We used anti-chafing cream, which helped a lot. I actually ended up using diaper rash cream at the end of every day because it helped repair the skin and the zinc helped a lot,\" Buchanan added.\"\n\n\"In the first ten days, I actually got a blister on my rear end, so that was pretty painful, and we actually had to take a few days off because of that.\"\n\nAlong the 2,000 kilometre trip, Buchanan had a chance to speak with other individuals with EB."
