        "text": "Raymond Wright Buchanan, Jr., 82, of Pensacola, Florida, departed this earthly life on February 24, 2020. Raymond was born in Pensacola, Florida, on July 16, 1937 to Raymond Wright Buchanan, Sr. and Frances Marie Petelinski. He graduated from Pensacola High School in 1955, received a B.A. Degree in Speech Communication from David Lipscomb College in 1959, a M.A. Degree in Speech Communication from Louisiana State University in 1967 and a Ph.D. Degree in Speech Communication from Louisiana State University in 1970. He married Irma Ruth Key in Booneville, Mississippi, on June 13, 1958. Raymond was employed by the University of Central Florida [UCF] (formerly Florida Technological University) in 1970. He was appointed chairman of the Communications Department at UCF from 1973 through 1986 and earned the rank of Full Professor in 1978. In 1986 he became a professor in the Communications Division at Pepperdine University, Malibu, California, until his retirement in 2002. In 2003 he was granted the title of Pepperdine University Professor Emeritus of Communication. Raymond founded the competitive Speech and Debate program at UCF. He was a masterful debate coach (at UCF and Pepperdine) and his students competed successfully at the state and national level. He was a prolific writer regarding issues related to communications, including persuasive communication within the legal system. He was published in many professional magazines and journals, including The Judge’s Journal, Journal of Communication, Communication Monographs, The Southern Speech Journal, Trial, Communications Quarterly, Judicature, Southern Speech Communication Journal and many others. Raymond was a member of the Church of Christ. He was an accomplished preacher and led religious services during his lifetime at various Churches of Christ in Florida, Tennessee and Louisiana. Wherever he lived, Raymond and Irma would join a local Church of Christ and became active members. Raymond enjoyed hunting, fishing and culinary delights. He traveled extensively within the United States and Europe, making friends wherever he visited. He enjoyed the beauty of nature and found solace listening to the wind flow through the trees at sunrise. He is preceded in death by his parents, Raymond Wright Buchanan, Sr. and Frances Marie Buchanan. Raymond Wright Buchanan, Jr. is survived by his wife, Irma Ruth Buchanan; sons, Michael Ray Buchanan (Diane Marguerite Rohner) and Steven Jeffery Buchanan (Lisa Lynn Hill); daughters, Mona Marie Altman (Keith Altman) and Natalie Renee Buchanan; nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. A private gathering of family will be held in his honor."
