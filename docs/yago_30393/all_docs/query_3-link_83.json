        "text": "The Bank of England has determined that the UK's largest banks could remain operational and wouldn't require a government bailout in the event of a collapse, according to an assessment of their crisis planning.\n\nEight major banks and building societies were assessed for their 'resolvability', or their ability to safely manage a failure without significant repercussions for the UK economy. This is part of a post-financial crisis focus on ensuring taxpayers aren't left footing the bill for bank failures.\n\nThe Bank of England found that all firms had made \"significant progress\" in improving their preparations for a crisis. This means they could stay open and continue providing banking services, with \"shareholders and investors not public funds first in line to bear the costs of failure\", according to the report.\n\nDuring the global financial crisis about 15 years ago, NatWest, formerly the Royal Bank of Scotland, was bailed out by the government for billions of pounds. The government also took a significant stake in Lloyds, which has since fully returned to public ownership.\n\nThe central bank stated that the banking sector is now in a much better position than during the 2007-08 financial crisis. Nationwide Building Society, NatWest, and Santander UK were found to have no material issues meaning there were no identifiable gaps in their plans to deal with a hypothetical failure.\n\nThe latest assessment shows an improvement from 2022, with Santander UK's plans previously being the only ones deemed robust enough. However, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, and Virgin Money UK still require \"further enhancements\" to their contingency strategies.\n\nStandard Chartered stands out as the sole major bank with a specific shortcoming identified in its ability to carry out restructuring plans. Nevertheless, no banks were found to have critical issues with their resolution plans.\n\nBank of England's Deputy Governor for Markets, Dave Ramsden, commented: \"We welcome the progress made by the major UK banks. Resolvability will never be 'done' and there will always be lessons to learn from putting the regime into practice.\""
