        "text": "Rolling road closures are scheduled in Boulder and north of Boulder for the Ride for Magnus event Sunday in which thousands of cyclists will be riding in honor of the 17-year-old who was killed last year while cycling along Diagonal Highway.\n\nAccording to The White Line, an organization established in Magnus White’s honor, participants will depart Parking Lot 360 at the University of Colorado Boulder campus around 10 a.m. Sunday and ride north on Folsom and 26th streets to Jay Road.\n\nThey will then ride east on Jay Road before heading north in the Boulder-bound lanes of Diagonal Highway to the site where White was struck and killed. Riders will then return along the same route back to Farrand Field on CU Boulder at noon.\n\nDuring the event, Diagonal Highway traffic will be limited to Longmont-bound lanes. The total length of the route is 13.5 miles.\n\nOfficials said to expect delays and use alternative routes when available.\n\nRide staging will be at 9:30 a.m. At 12:30 p.m. there will be a Rally for Change at Farrand Field. Rally speakers include Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Federal Highway Administrator Shailen Bhatt, U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, Trek Bicycles President John Burke and White’s parents, Jill and Michael.\n\nWhite’s father wrote in an email that organizers expect participants from all 50 states and more than 20 countries. For those unable to attend in person, virtual riders will be recognized with the same number plates in-person riders receive.\n\nBoulder B Cycle will provide 25 free E-bikes for those who first sign up for them. A 1.1 mile memorial walk will also be held with an 11 a.m. start time which will start and finish at Farrand Field.\n\nRegistration is required for the event. Attendees can register at thewhiteline.org.\n\nWhite was struck and killed by a driver on July 29th, 2023, on Diagonal Highway, just days before he was scheduled to compete in the Mountain Bike Cross-Country World Championships in Scotland. At the time of his death, White was a member of the U.S. National Cycling Team and was a U.S. Junior Cyclocross National Champion."
