        "text": "Obituary of Eleanor Frame\n\nPlease share a memory of Eleanor to include in a keepsake book for family and friends.\n\nFRAME, Eleanor (Moore) -90 passed away on Saturday October 7, at Cedarstone Enhanced Care in Truro, NS. Eleanor grew up on a Dairy farm in Shubenacadie and was the daughter of David and Marion (Fraser) Moore.\n\nShe met her future husband Lorne Frame while attending the Gays River School. After high school graduation Eleanor received business training in Truro, Nova Scotia and worked as a secretary for a brief time. She and Lorne married on September 7,1955 and Eleanor took on her role as wife and mother with love and commitment. In 1961 Lorne accepted a job at the recently opened pulp mill in Port Hawkesbury. Lorne and Eleanor moved to Cape Breton and became very attached to the people and the community. They spent many good years in the home that Lorne built for them in Port Hastings overlooking the strait of Canso. Eleanor was a great cook. Her chocolate chip cookies (Grammie cookies) were loved and her pie’s including her famous cranberry pie were legendary. All who knew Eleanor knew that she loved to play cards and bowl, BUT, that she hated to lose. Her competitive spirit would take over when she was losing a card game (especially if it was to Lorne) and she was never a gracious loser.\n\nIn 1992 after Lorne’s retirement, it was with some sadness and many wonderful memories that Lorne and Eleanor left their home and friends in Cape Breton to live closer to family in Truro. Lorne built their retirement home in Valley where they enjoyed retirement years.\n\nEleanor and Lorne enjoyed many trips in their motor home including two across Canada with their very dear Cape Breton friends Don and Eileen Heighton\n\nEleanor was a wonderful caring mother to her sons Howard and Frank. Her grandchildren Jennifer and Matthew have many great memories of Grammie including arriving with treats and taking them tobogganing.\n\nEleanor is survived by her son Howard (Nancy) and grandchildren Jennifer Frame (Basel, Switzerland) and Matthew Frame (Calgary, Alberta), her sisters in law Linda Clarke and Judy Moore and many nieces and nephews. She was predeceased by her husband Lorne and son Frank, her sisters Mary, Barbara, Clara, Frances, Margaret and Anna, brothers Henry and David.\n\nThank you to the staff at Cedarstone Enhanced Care, Garden Road Wing for the loving care they have provided to Eleanor for many years.\n\nService will be held at 11am on Friday, October 27,2023 in Ettinger Funeral Home, Shubenacadie. Rev. Natalie Buchanan-Rutherford officiating. Burial will be in Gays River Cemetery.\n\nDonations may be made to the Alzheimers Society of Nova Scotia."
