        "text": "Sheriff's investigators on Monday released the name of the man shot and killed on Saturday at a duplex near Ocala.\n\nJared Banks, 20, was shot once in the torso at 4560 SW 37th Lane in Ocala. He later died during surgery at Ocala Regional Medical Center. Jason Doyle Napier, 29, was arrested a short time after the shooting and charged with Banks' death.\n\nInvestigators contend Banks got caught in the middle of a dispute between Napier and his estranged wife, Stephanie Gastaneta, 36.\n\nOn the night of the shooting, Napier and Gastaneta were passengers in a woman's car. The three drove to the home, where Napier was to drop off Gastaneta, according to Marion County Sheriff's Office reports.\n\nBanks was already at the house.\n\nWhen they arrived at the home, Napier and Gastaneta started arguing and he reportedly threw the woman to the ground on the front porch. He then returned to the car, got a 9 mm, High Point handgun and returned to the front door, reports note.\n\nBanks, who was able to talk to investigators on his way to the hospital, said Napier tried to force his way into the home, and he was trying to close the door when he was shot, according to reports.\n\nNapier then ran, throwing the gun into a wooded area, deputies reported. Officers later found the weapon and Napier, who was initially held on a violation of probation warrant.\n\nHe was later charged with second degree murder, possession of a weapon by a convicted felon and use of a firearm by a convicted felon. Those charges carry a $75,000 bond, but Napier was being held without bond on the probation violation charge at the Marion County Jail on Monday.\n\nNapier told investigators the gun went off accidentally."
