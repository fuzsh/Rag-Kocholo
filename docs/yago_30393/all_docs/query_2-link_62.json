        "text": "Design Options in Archicad 27 are awesome. They are arguably the most important addition to Archicad since Building Materials were introduced back in 2013 with the release of Archicad 17. Yes. Even more important than segmented Beams and Columns. Over the next couple of weeks I'll be releasing four videos that share how I'm currently using Design Options. In the first video, I talk about the basics. In each subsequent video, I'll share more interesting ways I'm using Design Options.\n\nIn part 1 of the series I cover the basics of Design Options in Archicad 27.\n\nhttps://shoegnome.com/2024/02/12/design-options-in-archicad-27-part-1/\n\nIn part 2 of this series I look at Design Options for actual design options, and how Design Options can improve the organization of a template.\n\nhttps://shoegnome.com/2024/02/19/design-options-in-archicad-27-part-2/\n\nIn part 3 of my video series I discuss Design Options for site modeling, surrounding context, and a few other things.\n\nhttps://shoegnome.com/2024/02/26/design-options-in-archicad-27-part-3/\n\nIn part 4 of my video series I look at combing Design Options with hotlinked Modules.\n\nhttps://shoegnome.com/2024/03/04/design-options-in-archicad-27-part-4/\n\nJared Banks, AIA\n\nShoegnome Architects\n\nArchicad Blog: www.shoegnome.com\n\nArchicad Template: www.shoegnome.com/template/\n\nArchicad Work Environment: www.shoegnome.com/work-environment/\n\nArchicad Tutorial Videos: www.youtube.com/shoegnome\n\nHi Jared, thanks for this great info. i havent used 27 as im still on 25. I read that you couldnt see more than one option at the same time, but seeing your video you can if they are in different sets, right? if that is so, if i replace the word OPTION with PHASE, could i organize my project not in term of different options but in term of different construction times? what would be your take on it?\n\nthanks again\n\nI talk about this a bit in the video above.\n\nYes you can only see one Option per Option Set at a time, but you can see an infinite number of different Option Sets. So if you treated Option Sets as individual Options (ei, just one Option per Option Set), then you could show all the options at once. For Phasing, you'd treat each Option Set as its own Phase. You might need to break that down even more. You'd end up with something like:\n\nMain Model - Site/everything that stays the same the entire time\n\nOption Set (Phase One)\n\nOption Set (Phase One - to be removed before Phase Two)\n\nOption Set (Phase One - to be removed before Phase Three)\n\nOption Set (Phase Two)\n\nOption Set (Phase Two - to be removed before Phase Three)\n\nOption Set (Phase Three)\n\nIt clearly can get complicated as elements can only exist in one Option. I haven't explored this on a live project yet, but absolutely it'll be possible.\n\nJared Banks, AIA\n\nShoegnome Architects\n\nArchicad Blog: www.shoegnome.com\n\nArchicad Template: www.shoegnome.com/template/\n\nArchicad Work Environment: www.shoegnome.com/work-environment/\n\nArchicad Tutorial Videos: www.youtube.com/shoegnome"
