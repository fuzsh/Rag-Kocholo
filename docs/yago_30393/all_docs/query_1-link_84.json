        "text": "MICHAEL:\n\nThere is so much coming up for Natalie, but I wanted to go back a bit in time to when Jared died, and those incredible performances you gave at the graveside. Were those hard to pull off, or do you love getting the chance to emotionally go there?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nThank you. It’s a double-edged sword. It’s hard, but I think that is what is so gratifying about it.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nIt brought us back to a few years before when Natalie thought John was dead, and viewers witnessed your gut-wrenching performances. And now Jared is gone. What goes on in Natalie’s mind, in terms of handling all the loss and grief? It’s almost too much for one person to go through in such a short time frame.\n\nMELISSA:\n\nIt’s funny, outside of Natalie looking at it. She has had so much tragedy with the men in her life. Most of them come back, though. (Laughs) Imagine it actually happening to a human being who would actually lose so many people in such a short time in their life. It’s a little heartbreaking for that person. I think that is the thing. For each love interest and new found thing in Natalie’s life, she took from what she had with the old and you have a growth, and you bring that into the new relationship. You are going through the process all over again. Then with that person dying, it’s a whole new tragedy in itself. Then of course, how do you deal? That is the next question.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nHow was working with John Brotherton (Ex- Jared)?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nAmazing! He was awesome. He is a nice guy, professional and positive, and it was nice to work with him.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nNow we come to what looks like, or shall I say certain signs are pointing to, a re-emergence of the Natalie and John romance. Why do you think Natalie and John work so well together? Do you and Michael Easton talk about how that relationship comes across on-screen?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nI don’t know that we have really discussed how it comes across on screen, but yeah, I think it was always an interesting story. I think what made it so interesting for so long is that they never, until the very end; they never had a committed relationship. So there was this wanting, and wanting, that built for so long.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nNatalie is always compelled to help John! But this time the stakes are very high. Jessica is in big trouble.\n\nMELISSA:\n\nDefinitely! She is determined to help John and it’s double sided, but she is more determined to help her sister. Natalie knows John is the person who is going to help her, and not only that, but she had the guilt associated with the fact that John has been covering for her stabbing Mitch.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nYes. Natalie did stab evil Mitch, and John seemingly will do anything to keep Natalie in the clear of any crime.\n\nMELISSA:\n\nYes, and this is a little payback to him to say, “Thanks, and let me help you now.” I think that is the relationship they have had for a really long time. One helps the other, and they have always had a friendship. Even though they have not been in each other’s orbit there is always this care for one another.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nHow is Michael Easton to work with?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nI love working with Michael. He is fabulous, hard-working, and I like what he brings to the story. He has a very interesting character to play.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nHe is not your typical soapy actor. When something happens to John it’s so devastating to watch because of the way Michael plays him. The character is very contained. So those big emotional moments are wonderful to see.\n\nMELISSA:\n\nI think that is what makes him so interesting, because it’s not the typical character. And, as the character is challenged, it’s challenging for those involved with John. The goal sometimes for Natalie is to reach the underside of what he hides. I sometimes think that is a big drive for her. John is so quiet. I think Natalie appreciates that to some degree, too. I think because of where Natalie is in certain points of her life and because she is a feistier character, she could relate to certain things with him that other people couldn’t.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nIn a recent interview I did with Erika Slezak, (Viki) for Advocate.com, I asked her about working with you as her on-screen daughter. I want to read to you what she had to say and get your comments. Erika stated, “I think Melissa is one of the best actresses we have ever had on our show. I know Melissa personally, and I know what she does on-screen and it’s riveting. I adore that child and I think of her as my own. Now I think she lives on another planet, but I have told her that. She cuts through all the nonsense and gets to the heart of who Natalie is. She has passion and she is the sweetest goofball.”\n\nMELISSA:\n\nI love her! (Laughs) It’s funny, because I have always felt like Erika is a part of my family. I know it’s television, but Erika has always been so wonderful about taking me under her wing. I always feel like I can go to her for anything, and she is fabulous to work with. She is a giving actress, but it’s more than that. I feel I can learn so much from her, and I appreciate what she brings to the table in helping me, and her professionalism. It’s so awesome to have that opportunity to work with her!\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWould you agree with her goofball comment?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nYes. Absolutely!\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWe love that about you! How are you a goofball?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nI am goofy! I am kind of random and I say silly things sometimes and I act crazy (in a good way), sometimes. I have a different way of thinking at times. (Laughs)\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nTomorrow on OLTL, there is a huge car collision. Natalie has already taken off for Llantano Mountain to try and save Jessica from the clutches of Mitch Laurence, and she is on her way up there with Brody and John in tow. You are driving the car?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nI am driving the getaway car and it was fun. I will be honest. I was hoping because there was a remote involved, that we would be driving the getaway car. I thought it would be so cool, as it is in the movies.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWill Natalie be donning an incognito Chauffeur’s hat? After all, our three heroes are trying to out-run the cops!\n\nMELISSA:\n\nYes. At some point in it, yes I do. It was a lot of fun to tape this. Even though it wasn’t driving on the road, it was still really exciting. They have the car moving, as if you are really moving. But I will tell you; I thought I would be a much better pretend driver! (Laughs) I know how the car feels when I am driving, and how much the wheel turns. But, I guess it depends on the vehicle. For the getaway, this was more of a rugged SUV vehicle. So I guess I thought the wheel would be tougher. I kind of thought the wheel would not turn as much, and production had to tell me that I had to move the wheel more because it looked like I wasn’t doing anything. I thought I was being really cool! (Laughs) And I was bouncing it too, since it’s a rugged SUV. So I thought it would bounce more than it would shake. Apparently, it did not read well, so we had to change that. (Laughs)\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nYou went on location for these exterior scenes. Where did you shoot them?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nThe location was the loading ramp outside of the building formerly known as All My Children’s studio, where we are moving to this month.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nThis crash involves many people!\n\nMELISSA:\n\nIt is going to involve many people and in reading the scripts, it was kind of exciting. Listen, we are very lucky. We have an amazing production team to make things look as good as they do. When I first read it I was like, “How are they going to do it in the studio?” They were able to just pull it all off with stunts, and pyrotechnics, and so much more. It was so cool and looks amazing to me!\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nOnce the car accident happens, can we expect a big moment between Natalie and John? That is what we have heard and long time fans have been begging for. But it seems that Natalie gets very close in proximity to John, and in her delirium thinks she is kissing Jared?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nWe can say that there is a major moment the week of February 8th for anyone who ever loved John and Natalie. It’s totally unexpected. Yes, she thinks she is kissing Jared. She does not realize what she is doing in the midst of it, but at some point she does.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nIs Natalie in physical danger?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nNatalie is in physical danger from the car crash. I am trying to get to Jessica and that is the initial goal. There is something major that happens to them. The car crash happens, and the stakes were already high, because we have to get to Jessica. Then this collision happens and then it throws everything off course. Then the stakes are magnified.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nHow do you like the real possibility of working with Michael Easton again in an on-screen romantic relationship with John and Natalie? And wait….there is another huge complication, John’s current girlfriend, Marty! I see a triangle!\n\nMELISSA:\n\nOh yeah! And of course, there is the issue of Marty. To have a triangle is exciting! They are fun to play. I have been in quite a few triangles: Evangeline/John/Natalie, and then the John/Natalie/Cristian, and then Cristian/Jen/Natalie, and at the beginning there was the Jessica/Seth/Natalie triangle.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nSo of all those triangles, what was your favorite to play?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nI think the longest was Evangeline/John/Natalie, and I thought that was a lot of fun. I also would have to say I enjoyed the Cristian/Natalie/John triangle because it was kind of nice to be the apex! I will say that, too. (Laughs)\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nFebruary sweeps seems to be can’t-miss soap opera television at One Life to Live. There is this big issue of Mitch. Did you ever take issue, as an actress, of trying to justify Mitch’s actions? Some of it just seems so ridiculous, out there, and borders on absurd!\n\nMELISSA:\n\nIt’s a funny thing. You have heard strange stories in real life where you are kind of dumbfounded these things can actually happen, but they do. And to say that this one man can get away with so much, yeah maybe, but you have to take into account the place where it’s happening. It’s happening in Llanview! And in Llanview you can do many things. (Laughs) And what I like about Mitch is that he is the bad guy who never dies and comes back. I think that is what is great about Mitch. He is always there to haunt and bring about great story. He gets away with so much, and that is what makes the stakes so high of, “Oh, my God! How did he come back from the dead? I thought he was dead this time. And now look what he is able to do?” And it is believable in a way because he has a cult and he has a lot of followers. You hear about this in other states, where the law enforcement is involved in the cover-up. So is this completely inconceivable? No, its not! It can happen.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nHow is working with Roscoe Born as Mitch Laurence? Natalie had had quite a history with this evil incarnate. She was married to him at one point in time!\n\nMELISSA:\n\nRoscoe is amazing! He is able to deliver every single time. I feel his job is one of the hardest because he has to play not only evil, but also a cult leader. So he has scriptures and all sorts of stuff he has to pull off and come across like he is so evil. And truly, Roscoe is a very nice man, and a pleasure to work with, and very funny. He is so good at what he does.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nOk, Melissa, but do you guys ever chuckle in rehearsals? It’s so twisted! I mean there were many group and family scenes where Mitch just pops up.\n\nMELISSA:\n\nSure, oh yeah! The first day he came back on the show this time, Mitch steps into the doorway of the greenhouse and his line was like, “Daddy’s home.” It was so eerie!\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhat about when Mitch popped out of Jared’s casket at the funeral? It was funny, sick and twisted all rolled in to one and there you were playing it for all its worth and delivering another Archer bravura performance!\n\nMELISSA:\n\nIt was an interesting thing. As an actress, I felt that for Natalie to be able to make this higher stakes for her, she would have to have the hope that Jared was not really dead and this was all a bad dream. Because for her, it’s obviously happened some other times to several other men on the show that have died, who ended up not being really dead. But she believed as this casket was opening that it was Jared, and that everything was going to be OK. And then of course, when the casket is fully opened and out comes Mitch, it’s this shock and horror and almost like speechlessness. Natalie goes to say something, but it’s like, “I can’t even believe this is happening. How did this happen? Mitch is supposed to be in prison! What is going on?”\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nI thought it was good that this time when Mitch came back to the show, head writer Ron Carlivati and OLTL executive producer Frank Valentini, changed Mitch back to the cult guy with his minions. It stayed true to the original origin of the character. Now, what about Mitch’s daughter and your sister, Jessica? I mean after all, Jess’s alter ego, Tess, tried to kill Natalie, but somehow they worked through that. Now, of course, Natalie is trying to save the poor girl before Mitch erases her memories with electro-shock therapy. It seems like no matter what Natalie and Jessica go through they somehow end up still being sisterly. (Laughs)\n\nMELISSA:\n\nI think that is the best part of Natalie and Jessica. They have always had such an interesting relationship; going from Natalie pretending to be her friend to revealing that she is not a nice person, and then trying to throw her off the stairs, and then later, somehow finding a way to not only become sisters, but friends. They have their moments, like when Jess was Tess, and Natalie did not like Tess, and Tess did not like Natalie. There were obviously problems there, and yet at the same point in time, she was able to recognize it was Tess and still love her sister and come out of it having a relationship with her. What is cool about it is even though Natalie did not grow up with Jessica; the sisters have a lot of what you hear people say about what it was like growing up with a sister. You can love each other to death, and then kill each other the next day. I think there are more loving times between them then not. But, I think that they have had their problems. I like playing both ends. That is what makes it so real and relatable, except when they want to kill each other. They use bombs and secret rooms! (Laughs)\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nSince the time you premiered on One Life to Live, what scenes stick in your mind as the moments you are most proud of playing Natalie?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nThere have been moments where I thought, “Wow, I did a really great job,” and then there have been other times later on where I felt I did a better job. I think I feel I have grown as an actress. But I think I am most proud of the storyline with Jared dying. I think it’s been most gratifying for me with my work. I felt really good about my performance. I can’t say that I felt I loved it every single time, but I put my heart and soul into it, and I really liked it.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nI also thought it was very poignant how Charlie and Natalie would bond together and help each other through Jared’s death. Most touching was when he came to the grave and held Natalie. How is working with Brian Kerwin (Charlie)?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nWorking with Brian is great, too. He has a way about him that is so natural. He has a likeable quality, not only his personal self, but as his character. And even when Charlie does wrong he is a likeable guy. I think it was really, really nice that Ron wrote us having that connection over Jared’s death. And it’s not each of them grieving on their own, but also to find comfort in one another. I found it a nice touch.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhat does Natalie think of Marty?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nIn one way, I feel like even though Natalie is trying to be the adult, and it’s a fact of life, it’s always hard when you see someone you were involved with move on, even if you are emotionally over that person. I think that Natalie has grown up herself, so I don’t think that the animosity is there. Just as John and Natalie have not been in each other’s orbit, neither have Marty and Natalie for a long period of time. There is not a lot of animosity there, but I think Natalie might feel at times a little threatened by Marty. I am not sure if she even realized that. I don’t know if she recognized that she feels threatened.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this plays out; when John and Natalie reconnect and Marty is on the outside for a minute.\n\nMELISSA:\n\nI think that is why I like this triangle as well. I feel Susan Haskell brings a lot to Marty, not only the way she plays it, but how it is written for her. I think it just aired recently, where Natalie went to therapy with Marty, and it was interesting. Susan really played the part of being the therapist trying to help this person, but also the moments where we see what Marty may have actually been thinking. I saw the show where Marty was talking to her therapist. The therapist was saying to her, “Well, maybe it’s because she was talking about your boyfriend.” And I liked the way she played it because, again, it wasn’t a person recognizing that they feel threatened. Now, it brings a cool dynamic between these two women in that they are trying to be adult about this. But, they are really feeling something else. Then eventually, the question becomes, “How long are you not going to be an adult about it?”\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nSo, can we then expect a complex human triangle?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nIt’s hard to say how it will play out, but I think it’s going to play out interesting, because Marty, with her psychological background, is trying to have a grasp over her feelings and be the bigger person. And Natalie usually struggles with that stuff, in general. (Laughs) It will be interesting to see if it will become catty or not. It’s a soap, and that makes it fun to always see a little cattiness!\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhen fans meet you, what do they say to you the most? Do they tell you who they would like Natalie paired with romantically?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nIt varies. I still hear people say that they want Natalie with Cristian. So I think that is what makes soap fans so great. It’s not just one thing.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhat can we tell Natalie fans to look forward to in February?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nWe have seen Natalie grieving, then driven by revenge, and now she is driven to save her sister. Then something happens with the crash that alters her reality. Something unexpected is going to happen with John, and when that happens, things change even more.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nSo, is Natalie finally moving through her grief and ready to move on?\n\nMELISSA:\n\nI don’t think Natalie is over her loss for Jared. I think she is struggling on how to deal with it as I think anybody would in that situation. In February, it becomes trickier. You will see her struggling with all of her feelings, and desperately trying to pinpoint what is real and what is not."
