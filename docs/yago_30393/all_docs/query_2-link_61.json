(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nBlake, the plush bear, and Bentley, the plush puppy, are available for purchase for $14.99 starting today in KAY and Jared stores nationwide. All profits from the plush, no less than $7.00 of the purchase price of each, will be donated to St. Jude through Feb. 1, 2025 as part of the St. Jude Thanks and Giving® campaign.\n\n“As we embark on our 26th year of raising funds for the heroic work and lifesaving care delivered by St. Jude, at Signet we continue to prioritize Inspiring Love through our products, team and in our community,” said Virginia C. Drosos, CEO of Signet Jewelers. “We look forward to bringing Blake and Bentley into our stores and into our customers’ hearts.”\n\nThe plush campaign has become a hallmark of the Signet and St. Jude relationship. Each year, Signet team members vote for the two plush designs that will eventually make their way into customers’ hearts during the holiday season, while St. Jude patients choose the names of the famous duo.\n\nOver the past 26 years, Signet Jewelers and our generous customers have raised more than $100 million to support children with cancer and other life-threatening diseases, in support of our purpose of Inspiring Love. In addition to plush sales at KAY and Jared, Zales and Banter by Piercing Pagoda support St. Jude families by offering customers the opportunity to give at the register during the holiday season. These banners also support St. Jude year-round by accepting online customer donations, participating in a year-round employee giving campaign and offering team member matching gifts through the Signet Love Inspires Foundation. Signet also participates in the St. Jude Walk/Run and St. Jude Memphis Marathon® Weekend to help support the lifesaving mission of St. Jude.\n\n“The incredible, longtime support of our friends at Signet Jewelers helps St. Jude provide patient families with world-class care, all while accelerating efforts to find cures for childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases,\" said Richard C. Shadyac Jr., President and CEO of ALSAC, the fundraising and awareness organization for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. \"We are deeply grateful for the love and generosity of Signet’s customers and team members who are helping children across the globe survive and thrive.”\n\nIn October of 2023, Signet and its U.S.-based banners announced a new $100 million commitment to St. Jude that will further advance research and treatment to increase survivorship in the U.S. and around the world in countries where survivorship rates are much lower. In 2023, Signet raised a record-breaking $8.75 million toward that new $100 million goal, representing Signet’s largest one-time donation to St. Jude and the most Signet has raised in a single year for St. Jude families.\n\nABOUT SIGNET JEWELERS\n\nSignet Jewelers Limited is the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry. As a purpose-driven and sustainability-focused company, Signet is a participant in the United Nations Global Compact and adheres to its principles-based approach to responsible business.

Its purpose is clear: Finding cures. Saving children.® It is the only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center devoted solely to children. When St. Jude opened in 1962, childhood cancer was largely considered incurable. Since then, St. Jude has helped push the overall survival rate from 20% to more than 80%, and it won't stop until no child dies from cancer. St. Jude shares the breakthroughs it makes to help doctors and researchers at local hospitals and cancer centers around the world improve the quality of treatment and care for even more children. Because of generous donors, families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food, so they can focus on helping their child live. Visit St. Jude Inspire to discover powerful St. Jude stories of hope, strength, love and kindness. Support the St. Jude mission by donating at stjude.org, liking St. Jude on Facebook, following St. Jude on X, Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok, and subscribing to its YouTube channel."
