        "text": "The NFL offseason seemed like it was much longer than usual for supporters of the Detroit Lions.\n\nWith a football team being heralded as a Super Bowl contender, anticipation mounted as training camp began three weeks ago.\n\nOn a damp, drizzling evening in East Rutherford, N.J., players battling for roster spots and young players needing game experience took the field for a preseason contest in front of a sparse crowd.\n\nHere are seven takeaways from the Lions’ 2024 preseason opener:\n\nSolid effort for rookie cornerback Ennis Rakestraw\n\nEnnis Rakestraw has had a solid start to his first training camp, including three picks when padded practices began.\n\nThe 2024 second-round pick has relished playing all over the secondary, including on the outside.\n\nRakestraw started at outside cornerback, and secured a third-down tackle to start the game. Then, his effort on special teams was noticed, as he hustled downfield on his first punt coverage assignment to bring down the returner.\n\nIsaac Ukwu stands out\n\nFor undrafted free agents, any opportunity to make plays provides the coaching staff added information when making its evaluations.\n\nIsaac Ukwu was able to sack Drew Lock early in the contest, and used outside rush moves to disrupt the Giants’ offense early in the contest.\n\nDetroit’s defense was able to stifle the Giants early, forcing three-and-outs, pass breakups and an early interception against Drew Lock. Safety Brandon Joseph was able to aid Detroit in getting into solid field position by intercepting the veteran signal-caller.\n\nBrodric Martin and Nate Lynn combined to earn a sack in the preseason opener. Detroit is counting on Martin to make the second-year leap to provide additional depth along the defensive line.\n\nGray runs for 2 touchdowns as the Giants beat the Lions 14-3 in a preseason game with few starters\n\nJake Bates drills 53-yard kick\n\nThe Lions’ only score of the game was a 53-yarder from kicker Jake Bates, who is seeking to be more consistent as training camp progresses.\n\nSome level of concern started to grow through the first couple weeks of camp, as Bates started to rack up several misses during practices that were viewed by fans.\n\nBates has the needed leg strength. However, in order to make the Lions’ roster coming out of camp, his consistency must improve.\n\nNate Sudfeld struggles to find rhythm\n\nSudfeld likely did not convince the Lions’ coaching staff that he should be Jared Goff’s backup based on his first-half performance.\n\nThe reserve quarterback had trouble leading the offense all throughout the half, experiencing issues with both timing and accuracy. He threw a near-pick, and also tossed a very ill-advised pass in the direction of Daurice Fountain in the second quarter. Additionally, he threw a ball across his body late in the quarter that was intercepted by Tre Herndon.\n\nHe finished the opening half five-of-11 through the air for just 24 yards. It was a very underwhelming effort for Sudfeld in his 2024 preseason debut.\n\nSudfeld re-entered the game in the fourth quarter when Hendon Hooker went to the locker room and led a drive into the Giants’ red-zone, but the Lions came away without points after turning the ball over on downs.\n\nDefense shaky in second quarter\n\nAaron Glenn’s defense faltered in the second quarter, allowing 14 unanswered points to Brian Daboll’s offense.\n\nGiants fan favorite Tommy DeVito found success through the air, completing five-of-eight passes for 79 yards. Plus, New York back Eric Gray ran all over the Lions’ defense, rushing for two scores. On his first TD run, he scored from 48 yards out, eluding multiple Detroit defenders on his way to the end zone.\n\nSione Vaki provides offensive spark\n\nThe converted safety aided Detroit in the second quarter with one of their best offensive drives of what otherwise was an abysmal offensive showing.\n\nDetroit’s fourth round draft pick was able to secure 29 yards on four carries in the first half, including an impressive 15-yard scamper to move the football deeper into Giants territory.\n\nVaki is in competition to be the team’s third-string running back, and with his initial showing, he can continue his development in his first NFL training camp.\n\nIt was not the best day for Detroit’s offensive line, as Sudfeld was pressured repeatedly. Colby Sorsdal allowed a sack, and the depth could become a concern if injuries keep piling up. Connor Galvin was carted off the field after getting rolled up on in the fourth quarter.\n\nPhoto gallery from the Lions’ 14-3 preseason loss to the Giants\n\nHendon Hooker decisive, leaves game early\n\nThroughout the first couple weeks of training camp, Detroit’s second-year signal-caller struggled with inconsistency and difficulty in team periods against the defense.\n\nTrailing 14-3 in the third quarter, Hooker moved the offense down the field effectively, with a couple of conversions on third-down to extend the drive. His ability to elude defenders and scramble was on full display, as he had a tough 16-yard scramble, battling a safety in the process.\n\nUnfortunately, the nearly seven-minute drive stalled at the three-yard line, when a fourth-down pass intended for Zonovan Knight was deflected at the line.\n\nFollowing that drive, Hooker went into the blue medical tent. After exiting, he went to the locker room. No immediate specifics were given about his status, but Nate Sudfeld re-entered the game with 12 minutes to go. Hooker finished 5-of-9 for 36 yards, along with four carries for 34 yards.\n\nThis article was produced by the staff at Detroit Lions On SI. For more, visit si.com/nfl/lions"
