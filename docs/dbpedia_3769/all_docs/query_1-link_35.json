        "text": "Perhaps, the most important fact to note about true eels is that some level of salinity is required for their survival. This means that in the strict sense, there are no true freshwater eels that live and breed in freshwaters.\n\nLike many other fish, these eels usually spend their lives in fresh and brackish waters but swim several miles into the ocean to spawn.\n\nHowever, eels and eel-like fish are noticeably a part of the aquarium trade. If you consider owning an eel aquarium, here is a list of some freshwater eels.\n\nFreshwater Eel Species\n\nReedfish (Erpetoichthys Calabaricus)\n\nThe first eel-like fish to consider is the Reedfish. This fish is a peaceful fish that gets along with other fish in the aquarium.\n\nThe Reedfish is also called the Rope fish. It is common in Western African countries, including Cameroon, Benin, Nigeria, and Angola.\n\nThis eel-like fish can thrive in both freshwater and brackish water aquariums.\n\nIt is a curious and friendly fish that usually goes about its business. If you plan to keep this fish, it would be best to keep 2 – 3 of them, depending on the size of your aquarium.\n\nReedfish can grow up to 20 inches in length. Using a 55-gallon tank or more for a single Reedfish would be best. If you want to keep more than one, a 125-gallon would be best.\n\nBichir (Polypterus senegalus)\n\nThe Bichir is an air-breathing fish endemic to the Nile River and some surrounding swamps and estuaries. It has a long body with several dorsal finlets.\n\nIt is a nocturnal bottom-dwelling fish that grows very fast. This means you have to ensure that your fish tank has enough room.\n\nThe Bichir is a semi-aggressive fish. It is one of the common fish you can find in local fish stores.\n\nThis fish grows up to 14 inches in length, but in the wild, it can reach a maximum length of more than 23 inches. It is not a true ell, but it has an eel-like appearance. It is, in fact, part of the Polypteridae family.\n\nIt is a resilient fish that can tolerate dirty water. It does not demand much care. But if you plan to have them in a community aquarium, it would be better to pick tankmates that are big enough to be respected.\n\nHalf Banded Spiny Eel (Macrognathus circumcinctus)\n\nYour list of freshwater aquarium eels is incomplete without the Half-Banded Spiny Eel. Unlike the European eel that grows as long as 31 inches in length, Half banded Spiny Eels grow up to more than 8 inches.\n\nAnother cool thing about this species of eel is that they are sociable, unlike most freshwater aquarium eels. Keeping about 4 or 5 of them is ideal, and their less than 8 inches length makes this very easy to do.\n\nThe Half-Banded Spiny Eel, like Fire eels, is not considered a true eel, even though it has an eel-like body and is called a spiny eel. It is an excellent choice for newbie aquarists who want to start keeping freshwater eels.\n\nAnother noticeable thing about the Half banded eel is that it has dark marks over its body, but its marks are better patterned than those on Tire Track Eels. This fish is a great bottom dweller and will make an excellent addition to your freshwater aquarium.\n\nWest African Lungfish (Protopterus annectens)\n\nThis monstrous eel-like fish is that fish that takes away your worries about getting other fish for the tank. It does not need one.\n\nAlso referred to as Tana Lungfish, the West African Lungfish is a lazy and unpredictable eel-like fish in the freshwater bodies of West Africa and some parts of South Africa.\n\nAlthough ugly as it may be for a freshwater aquarium eel, this Lungfish has some very interesting adaptability features.\n\nOne of the most fascinating is its lungs. Unlike electric eels that breathe oxygen by inhaling air with their mouths, the West African Lungfish has two lungs for breathing.\n\nTheir lungs supplement their gills which also function as a respiratory organs. With this combination, they are fine in the water and the mud when the water body they inhabit dries out.\n\nAlthough the largest West African Lungfish caught was more than 36 inches in length, they usually grow smaller than that in captivity.\n\nIf you want to keep them as freshwater aquarium eels in your eel aquarium, it would be best to keep them alone. Tankmates are not recommended for this because it has very strong jaws and is unpredictable.\n\nKuhli Loach (Pangio khulii)\n\nThe Khuli Loach is a very popular eel-like fish in the aquarium hobby. This bottom feeder is not a true eel, but its eel-like fish appearance makes it worthy of mention. The Khuli Loach is a popular eel-like fish in the Cobitidae family.\n\nIt is one of the many types of freshwater eels that grow to a maximum of only about 4-11 inches in length. But the average size of the Khuli Loach is 2-3 inches. It is a very hardy fish.\n\nLike other spiny eel species, the Khuli Loach has a slender body like a snake’s. It does not have dorsal fins or pectoral fins either. It is so widespread that you can get it in local fish stores wherever you stay.\n\nWhile most eels are carnivores, the Khuli Loach is an omnivore. It is renowned in the hobby as one of the best cleaner small fish for a freshwater aquarium. This fish usually goes about scavenging for leftover foods at the bottom of the tank.\n\nBut you have to specifically feed them so they do not get hungry, as leftovers may not be sufficient to supply their nutrition needs.\n\nYou can feed them frozen foods but ensure they sink to the base because this eel-like fish is a bottom dweller. Frozen bloodworms, chicken liver, brine shrimp, etc., will do.\n\nSinking pellets with plant matter will also work.\n\nTire Track Eel (Mastacembelus favus)\n\nSometimes inaccurately called the Zig Zag eel, the Tire track eel is a spiny eel species in the Mastacembelus family. It shares this family with the Zig Zag eel, but both spiny eels belong to different species.\n\nTire Track eels are renowned for the distinct black marks on their elongated bodies. These marks resemble tire prints, hence the name for this freshwater aquarium eel.\n\nLike most other freshwater aquarium eels, it neither has dorsal fins nor pectoral fins. It only has a slender body to slide off decorations in the eel tank and swim around when it wants to.\n\nOf all the spiny eels, the Tire track eel is perhaps one of the most interesting with its personality. It might be shy and collected when you first introduce it to the eel aquarium; in a matter of time, it will become confident to explore the tank at its pleasure.\n\nLike many other eel-like fish, finding the right cave to accommodate their slender body can be a problem. But you can improvise. You can keep them happy by using long PVC pipes as caves for hiding. The pipe should be long enough to accommodate an elongated fish.\n\nEeltail Catfish (Plotosus lineatus)\n\nThe Eeltail Catfish (Plotosus lineatus), also known as the Striped Eel Catfish, is not to be confused with the Eel-tailed Catfish (Tandanus tandanus). The Eeltail Catfish is a member of the Plotosidae family, consisting of nine other catfish genera.\n\nThe Eeltail Catfish, like many other eel species, has an elongated body. Although it has barbels like a catfish, its eel-like tail complements its elongated body to make it look like a true eel. Its dorsal, caudal, and anal fins merge to form a flowing, continuous fin which gives it an eel-like appearance.\n\nLike many true eels, this carnivorous fish is nocturnal. Although it is not a true eel, this eel-like fish also loves hiding during the day. But it will come out at night to find food and explore the tank.\n\nIt uses its barbels to detect food especially when the visibility level of the water is very low.\n\nBy dimming the lights, you can trick these freshwater aquarium eels into coming out. That’s a great trick to having them eat.\n\nElectric Eel (Electrophorus electricus)\n\nUnlike many other freshwater aquarium eels, the Electric Eel is a very deadly fish. This fish can discharge as much as 600 volts when it comes in contact with a predator. It is a very dangerous predator.\n\nWhen confronted by bigger predators like crocodiles in the Amazon freshwater bodies, it is known to lunge all of its body at the predator.\n\nThis tactic allows the electric eel to deliver the maximum electric voltage on its predators, sometimes leaving them stiff to experience momentary respiratory seizures and muscle failure.\n\nThe Electrical Eel is not one of the common freshwater aquarium eels in the hobby because of the health risk they pose for hobbyists.\n\nBut it is not uncommon to find some daring hobbyists keeping this elongated fish in 200 gallons tanks and more.\n\nOne last thing to know about Electric Eels is that although they are eel-like fish, Electric eels are not true eels.\n\nAsian Swamp Eel (Monopterus albus)\n\nAsian Swamp eels are a very aggressive species of eels that were initially introduced into the US from East and Southeast Asia.\n\nAsian swamp eels are also called Rice Paddy eels. This species of eels is one of the many types of eels that are classified as air-breathing fish.\n\nThis swamp eel can grow as long as 36 inches. If you want to keep them as freshwater aquarium eels, a 180-gallon tank or more is what you need for an adult Asian swamp eel.\n\nYou want to keep them alone because they are very aggressive. They are so aggressive that you could lose your finger feeding them.\n\nIn the wild, an Asian Swamp eel eats a variety of prey. As voracious carnivores, these freshwater eels eat tadpoles, fish eggs, invertebrates, crayfish, worms, and smaller fish.\n\nPeacock Eels (Macrognathus siamensis)\n\nAlso known as Spotfin Spiny Eel, Siamese Spiny Eel, and Striped Peacock eel, Peacock eels are not true freshwater eels. But they are on the list of popular freshwater aquarium eels.\n\nThe Peacock Eel is a hardy fish with an impressive length like other aquarium eels. But it is smaller than the Electric Eel in terms of length.\n\nThis species of eel loves to burrow into the substrate. A soft substrate is a must-have if you want to add them to your community tank.\n\nIt is not an aggressive fish. The Peacock Eel is, in fact, a shy fish and will spend time burrowing into the substrate, waiting for the lights to dim so it can come out to explore the tank. You can house this fish with other peaceful fish in your community aquarium.\n\nFire Eel (Mastacembelus erythrotaenia)\n\nThis spiny eel is not a true eel, but the mesmerizing marks on its body make it one of the cool freshwater aquariums eels you will come across.\n\nThe Fire eel is a South American fish with a relatively large body and with its signature fire-like markings on its body. The Fire eel can grow as long as 36 inches in the wild, but in captivity, its average length is usually about 20 inches.\n\nLike most freshwater aquarium eels, the Fire eel is nocturnal, active only at night. It will usually bury its elongated body in the substrate away from light and other fish until the nighttime when the lights dim.\n\nYou want to leave some food for it before going to bed. You can be sure that it will come out to eat in the night.\n\nAlthough it is a peaceful bottom-dwelling aquarium eel, it is still a predatory fish. Fire eels can not share the same fish tank with small fish species.\n\nIdeal tankmates for fire eels are fast and mid-level or top dwelling fish that are big enough to be respected. Some you can consider are the Barbs (Medium to large size), Angelfish and Terror fish.\n\nIndian Mud Moray Eel (Gymnothorax tile)\n\nThis Moray eel is not to be confused with any of the numerous marine moray eel species.\n\nThere are over 800 species of eels in the 111 genera under the order Anguilliformes. Most of the moray eels are marine fish, but there are a few freshwater moray eels.\n\nHowever, many moray eels are also found in brackish waters, and a good example is the Indian Mud Moray eel.\n\nThis moray eel is a true brackish water fish, but it can survive in freshwater bodies. However, it will not survive for long in freshwater.\n\nUnlike the marine moray eel species that hide in coral reefs, the Indian Mud Moray Eel is a freshwater moray eel that loves to explore its immediate environment.\n\nIt is commonly called the Snowflake Moray eel. Many pet stores may try to sell you the Snowflake eel (Echidna nebulosa) as the Indian Moray eel (Gymnothorax tile).\n\nTake note that the freshwater snowflake eel differs from the Indian Moray eel, even though many pet stores claim they are the same.\n\nAnother important thing to remember is that they can jump out of the tank. It would be best to have a lid over the tank.\n\nZig Zag Eels (Mastacembelus Armatus)\n\nThe Zig Zag eel is a species of elongated spiny eels in the genus Mastacembelus. The Zig Zag eel is also inaccurately referred to as Marbled Spiny Eel, Tire Track Spiny eel, and, most commonly, Tire Track eel.\n\nZig Zag eels are endemic to the riverine fauna of South East Asia. In the aquarium hobby, many aquarists refer to the Zig Zag eel as the Leopard eel.\n\nAlthough this spiny eel is a bottom dweller, it is an occasional substrate digger. If you are rearing one, you want to use a soft substrate to prevent the possibility of an injury.\n\nThe Zig Zag Eel is a true freshwater eel, but it will also thrive in brackish water.\n\nYou want to remember that this spiny eel is one of the many types of eels that uproot plants as they burrow into the substrate. It would be best to use floating plants for cover.\n\nNote that this species of eel is similar to the Tire track eel. But major pet stores label them correctly.\n\nIt differs from the other eel species in any respect, including their scientific names. The Tire Track eel is Mastacembelus favus, while the Zig Zag eel is the Mastacembelus Armatus.\n\nFreshwater Aquarium Eels Care Guide\n\nThere is a lot to consider when taking care of your freshwater eels. However, you want to research the species you are keeping to learn about their specific needs.\n\nGenerally, freshwater eels are largely carnivorous. They eat smaller fish, crustaceans, shrimp, daphnia, insects and their larvae, worms at the riverbed, aquatic plants, and small feeder fish.\n\nIt would be best to provide them with these food choices to replicate their natural supply.\n\nSome freshwater eels usually eat plant matter, but they do this rarely. You can supplement their meat supply with flakes with plant matter.\n\nYou also want to provide a lot of covers for them. Most of these fish species live in swamps and rivers with aquatic plants. They are used to having dim lights. Others are nocturnal and will not be active until the lights dim. So you want to provide lots of covers and plants to replicate their natural environment.\n\nBut remember that they are long and slender. Regular covers will e ineffective. You want to provide long and narrow spaces where they can fit in for hiding. Remember to take this into account when picking the tank decor.\n\nIt would be best also to ensure that your pump and filters are up to the task. Many of these freshwater aquarium eels breathe with their lungs. You may notice some breach the water surface to gulp air.\n\nSo you need a good filtration system to keep the oxygen level in the water constantly at optimal levels.\n\nAnother thing to pay attention to is the characteristics of your fish. Some eels are notorious for jumping, especially the species that breach the surface to gulp some air. You want a lid on your tank to prevent them from jumping out of it.\n\nProviding a substrate is not enough. You want to provide a good base with soft sands or granites. Some eel species love to burrow into the substrate while they wait for the night to begin their exploration and scavenging for food.\n\nSince your eels are burrowers, deep-rooted plants will be a poor investment. It would be best to incorporate floating plants in your tank. The floating plants will not only provide oxygen, but they will also provide adequate cover from the light. Another benefit is that the burrowers are less likely to destroy the plants.\n\nTank Mates for Your Freshwater Eel\n\nThere is no straight-jacketed way to go about choosing tankmates for freshwater eels. Some are so peaceful and shy that they make great tank mates for slow-moving and small fish.\n\nExamples of fish like this include the bottom-dwelling Khuli Loach and Ropefish, which explore the substrate and mind their business.\n\nBut others are large, bold, and predatory. This means that any small and slow-moving tank mates will be bullied. An obvious freshwater eel that would fit this profile is the Asian Swamp Eel.\n\nThis aggressive fish will often reach the tank’s surface for air. While it does this, you can expect it to bully other fish species in the tank. Sometimes, this fish also preys on tankmates that are small enough to be eaten. It will also bite and injure a larger tank mate that is too big to eat.\n\nSo there is no uniform approach to choosing tank mates for your fish. You must research the freshwater eel you are keeping to pick the right tankmates.\n\nWhile Lionfish, Triggerfish, Wrasses, and Tangs are cool choices for a select few freshwater eels that can cope with salt water, these fish species will not cope with the water parameters of a freshwater aquarium. For this reason, they cannot be housed with these freshwater eels.\n\nHowever, Corydoras, Guppies, Rasboras, and Guppies make excellent tankmates for small peaceful bottom-dwelling freshwater eels like the Peacock eel.\n\nYou can consider Wolf Cichlid, Silver Arowanas, and the Blue Umbee Cichlid. These fish species are big enough for your eels to respect. Also, they are largely top and mid-level dwellers. This means the chances of bullying and confrontation are minimal.\n\nSome Tips To Know When Choosing Tankmates for Freshwater Eels\n\nYou should know some general information about when picking tank mates for your fish.\n\nIt would be best to choose tank mates with the same temperament level. Peaceful bottom-dwelling fish should be compatible with peaceful mid-level and top-dwelling fish. If your freshwater eel is large, quick, and aggressive, you want to keep it with large and fast tankmates that are equally aggressive.\n\nWhen picking tankmates, you also want to ensure that you pick fish species that can survive in freshwater.\n\nFor bigger freshwater eels like the 40 inches Fire eel or the 32 inches Zigzag eel, you need bigger freshwater fish species. You can house bigger eels like these with large predatory fish species.\n\nNote that not all big freshwater fish can be housed with your eels. Some of these large fish species are prolific waste producers. They are incompatible with some of these eel species that need well-oxygenated water to survive.\n\nYou want to take the time to do your research, taking into account the possible maximum size of your eel, its compatibility with another bottom dweller, its diet, and the tankmate’s rate of pollution.\n\nAre All Freshwater Eels Aggressive Fish Species?\n\nSmall-sized eels are usually peaceful, but you still want to be careful when choosing your eel.\n\nBut the bigger eels can be intimidating. Since they are naturally predatory, it would be bad to pair small and docile fish species with bigger eels like the Tire Track eels and Fire eels.\n\nSome others have very lethal characteristics that keeping them could be very dangerous. A good example is an Electric eel. Tankmates and owners are equally at risk of electrocution.\n\nThe most important thing to do when choosing which eel to rear is to research the eel, its level of aggression, and what you can do to reduce or check its aggression level.\n\nCommon Health Issues for Freshwater Eels and Treatment\n\nUnlike most jawed fish that have scales for protection, many freshwater eels do not have scales. This makes them even more susceptible to diseases and infections.\n\nBelow are some diseases and infections to watch out for:\n\nFungal and Bacterial Infections Leading to Fin RotThis is one of the most common fish health issues aquarists encounter with aquarium fish.Some causes of fungal and bacterial infection include parasitic infections following abrasions and injuries on your eel’s body and constant exposure to poor water quality and diet. Removing the protective mucous on the eel’s body during handling can also lead to bacterial and fungal infections.Symptoms of bacterial and fungal infections include tattered fins, white film on the eel’s body, and open red sores on the eel’s body.You can limit the chances of these diseases by choosing your decorations carefully. You want to avoid rocks and other decoration materials with sharp edges as these could scratch open the eel’s body and make it vulnerable to a fungal and bacterial infestation.Treatment for these diseases is easy. You can treat with antifungal and antibacterial treatment.But first, you want to separate the fish from the community aquarium. Administering any antifungal or antibacterial treatment in the community aquarium could disrupt the aquarium’s water parameters and even cause harm to the biological filters in the tank.\n\nWhite Spot Disease (Ich)The white spot disease, also known as Ich, is a very common fish disease. The parasite Ichthyophthirius multifiliis is responsible for this disease. It is a parasitic protozoan that attaches to your eel and penetrates its body to feed on its flesh.It usually appears as a white spot on your eel’s body. It is highly contagious and very adept at replicating itself. After feeding on your eel to maturity, it falls off your eel’s body to the substrate, replicating itself into a hundred more protozoans to repeat the process.The parasite damages your eel’s tissue leaving it vulnerable to bacterial and fungal attacks. It is so contagious that you can be sure all the fish in the community tank have it if you notice it on one of the fish.Symptoms of this disease include white spots on your eel’s body. You may also notice your fish scrubbing itself on solid surfaces in the tank.You need to make the temperature unfavorable for the parasite if you want to treat this disease. You can do this by raising the aquarium water temperature to 82°f for no less than 72 hours. After that, apply an over-the-counter Ich treatment. Finish off with antibacterial and antifungal treatment to help your eel recover from the tissue damage.\n\nGenerally, you should watch out for any changes in their habits that seem abnormal. These may include fatigue, lack of appetite, inflammation, and constant rubbing of its body on hard surfaces in the aquarium.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nKeeping a freshwater eel in your aquarium is a great way to spice up your freshwater aquarium. But this will not be an easy task for a novice aquarist.\n\nAlso, not much is known about their breeding. The reason is that they typically swim back into the ocean to spawn.\n\nPhoto Credit:\n\naquaristsacrosscanada.com\n\nreddit.com\n\nmonaconatureencyclopedia.com\n\nYoutube.com\n\nBe.chewy.com\n\nFishbase.de\n\nsource https://aquariumlabs.com/eel-like-freshwater-fish/\n\nCommon names of fish can be hard to memorize, especially when they start with an odd letter like the letter U.\n\nIt could be a total flop as you have to refer back to the published articles over and again to get the names correctly. It gets harder when there are a few similar scientific names too.\n\nBut we have taken the time to ease your struggle with this article in our alphabet fish name series. You can find popular and new fish names that start with the letter U in case you desire to add a new fish to your tank.\n\nThis article will help you learn common names of fish, beginning with U and more. You can start your learning by first checking out our top 5 fish that start with U.\n\nOur Top 5 Fish That Start With U\n\nUnicorn Fish\n\nUnicorn Fish is the first of our top 5 fish. There are many other unicorn fish species with distinct scientific names. But the Bluespine species has occasionally appeared in the trade. It is closely related to Sturgeon fish.\n\nIt is common in Indo-Pacific Asia. This saltwater fish is not much of a browser. Although it thrives on brown and red algae, it will seize every opportunity to feed on helpless prey like crab larvae and any other invertebrate within its range.\n\nThey are commonly found on coral reefs, especially in areas with strong surges. They usually grow to about 20-24 inches in the wild. They start growing the horn when they reach about 5 inches in length.\n\nUpside Down Catfish\n\nCatfishes are common in the hobby but have you ever heard of the Upside Down Catfish?\n\nThis fish is one of the fishes in the Synodontis genus. This genus has about 130 different species of catfish, many of which are called Upside Down Catfish.\n\nOne impressive thing about the Upside Down Catfish that you will notice is that it swims upside down. That is one of the shocking facts about this fish.\n\nApart from this unusual swimming pattern, you will also notice that the Upsidedown Catfish make a squeaking sound when you remove them from the water.\n\nUaru Cichlid\n\nOf all the shocking facts about the Uaru Cichlid, the most striking fact is that it is an intelligent freshwater fish with a unique character.\n\nThis freshwater fish is not as brightly colored as many other aquarium fish species, but it is a captivating fish to keep. Waroo and Chocolate Cichlid are other common names for this fish.\n\nThey may not be as brightly colored as other aquarium fish nor as easy to keep, but what they lack in color and ease of care, they make up for it with their intelligence.\n\nAnother intriguing thing about this fish is its impressive appearance. Its fins give it an unusual triangular shape.; making it a very powerful swimmer.\n\nAs an omnivore, it feeds on smaller animals in its freshwater habitat. These include insects, crustaceans, worms, and any other small animal that can fit into its mouth.\n\nUsumacinta Sea Catfish\n\nIn case you are wondering if this is the least of our list of fish names with U at the beginning, it is not.\n\nThis fish is one of the fishes with an unusual name, as you will find on any website. It is called the Usumacinta Sea Catfish because it is commonly found in the River Usumacinta, which is between Mexico and Guatemala.\n\nAlthough the name implies that it is not a freshwater fish, it is a freshwater fish. It prefers to stay in the major channels to large rivers. It has a maximum length of about 23 inches.\n\nNotwithstanding its impressive size, this fish is a demersal fish. Like many other cats, it is a bottom dweller spending most of its time on the floor of the lake. It also prefers tropical freshwater.\n\nAs its name suggests, it is a native fish of the Usumacinta basin, but it may be found in other nearby lakes and rivers.\n\nThere is not enough information about this fish, but its mystery profile and place of origin have earned it a place on our top pick list as a fish that starts with the letter U.\n\nUmbrella Cichlid\n\nUmbrella Apisto is another common name for this fish species. This freshwater fish has a widespread distribution throughout South American rivers. You can find this fish in the Paraguay and Parana rivers in South America.\n\nThey are also found in other South American countries like Brazil and Northern Argentina. Umbrella Cichlid is a tropical freshwater fish. It prefers warm freshwater in the temperature range of 72°f to 81°f. You want to ensure that you set your water parameter to the correct temperature.\n\nThis fish also thrives well in a slightly acidic to neutral ph. You want to set the correct water pH to help them flourish in your tank.\n\nYou want to be careful when picking tank mates. Keeping them with related species like the Dwarf South African Cichlids is better. You can pick other tank mates, but you want to avoid aggressive fish species, fin nippers, and larger fishes.\n\nIt is a common fish in the hobby and an excellent choice to start the hobby with if you hope to get an easy fish-keeping experience in the beginning.\n\nList of Fish Beginning With U\n\nHaving gone through our top picks from the beginning, we hope you find your dream fish in the list below.\n\nCheck out some of the common names you may be familiar with already and the others that may be new to you for the first time.\n\nU-mark sandperch (Parapercis snyderi)\n\nUganda nothobranch\n\nUkrainian brook lamprey\n\nUmatilla dace\n\nU-spot wrasse\n\nUaru fernandezyepezi\n\nUegitglanis zammaranoi\n\nUmbrella cichlid\n\nUmbrella conger\n\nUmbrina reedi\n\nUmbrina imberbis\n\nUmbrina milliae\n\nUmpqua dace\n\nUmpqua chub\n\nUmpqua squawfish\n\nUnarmored threespine stickleback\n\nUnarmed dwarf monocle bream\n\nUncisudis advena\n\nUncisudis longirostra\n\nUncinate sculpin\n\nUncombed blenny\n\nUnderjaw kingfish\n\nUncisudis posteropelvis\n\nUndulate painted ray\n\nUnderjaw kingfish\n\nUndistinguished sabretooth\n\nUngusurculus komodoensis\n\nUndulated moray\n\nUngusurculus collettei\n\nUngusurculus philippinensis\n\nUngusurculus sundaensis\n\nUngusurculus williamsi\n\nUngusurculus riauensis\n\nUnicorn grenadier\n\nUnicorn icefish\n\nUnicorn leatherjacket\n\nUnicolor moray\n\nUnicorn crestfish\n\nUnicorn sole\n\nUnion snook\n\nUpeneichthys stotti\n\nUnited-lip Gudgeon\n\nUpeneus filifer\n\nUpeneus guttatus\n\nUpeneus mascareinsis\n\nUpeneus mouthami\n\nUpeneus quadrilineatus\n\nUpeneus australiae\n\nUpeneus crosnieri\n\nUpjaw barb\n\nUpper Grijalva livebearer\n\nUpland bully\n\nUpper Zambesi squeaker\n\nUpper Zambezi nembwe\n\nUpper Zambezi yellowfish\n\nUpper Zambesi labeo\n\nUpside-down goby\n\nUpsidedown Catfish\n\nUpturned snout rattail\n\nUpside-down harptail blenny\n\nUranoscopus affinis\n\nUranoscopus chinensis\n\nUranoscopus crassiceps\n\nUranoscopus bauchotae\n\nUranoscopus filibarbis\n\nUranoscopus fuscomaculatus\n\nUranoscopus dahlakensis\n\nUranoscopus marisrubri\n\nUranoscopus marmoratus\n\nUranoscopus guttatus\n\nUroconger erythraeus\n\nUrolophus deforgesi\n\nUrolophus neocaledoniensis\n\nUrchin clingfish\n\nUrolophus papilio\n\nUromegarei\n\nUrophycis mystacea\n\nUropterygius makatei\n\nUropterygius nagoensis\n\nUropterygius golanii\n\nUropterygius wheeleri\n\nUropterygius genie\n\nUruguay river sprat\n\nUruguay tetra\n\nUsangu lampeye\n\nUssuri catfish\n\nUrotrygon cimar\n\nUrsinoscorpaenopsis kitai\n\nUssuri sharpbelly\n\nUsamacinta buffalo\n\nUruguayan eartheater\n\nUsumacinta cichlid\n\nUsumacinta sea catfish\n\nUssuri sharpbelly\n\nUtah chub\n\nUtah Lake sculpin\n\nUtiaritichthys sennaebragai\n\nUtiaritichthys longidorsalis\n\nsource https://aquariumlabs.com/fish-that-start-with-u/\n\nSome fish names that start with Z are easy to remember because the fishes are regular in the hobby, while others are a bit strange because the fishes are either unknown or unpopular in the hobby.\n\nFrom the freshwater fish in rivers and streams to the saltwater fish that exclusively stay in the oceans, this page lists plenty of fish names that start with Z.\n\nCheck out this post, starting with our top 9 picks to the lists below for fish names that start with Z.\n\nOur Top 9 Fish That Start With Z\n\nZebra Shark (Stegostoma fasciatum)\n\nZebra Shark is a carpet shark species endemic to the tropical waters of the Indo-Malayan parts of the Pacific ocean. This fish also loves to frequent coral reefs at a depth of about 203 ft.\n\nThe Zebra Shark is the only member of the Stegostomatidae family. It is a nocturnal fish that usually spends its day resting on the sea bed. It spends its night hunting smaller animals for food. It hunts crustaceans, smaller fish, mollusks, and sea snakes in the reef’s crevices.\n\nZebra Sharks swim alone. They have a solitary nature. Although some groups have been seen gathering together, they rarely gather together. When they do, the females usually outnumber the males 3 to 1. Their mating behavior remains a mystery, and the reason for the gathering is yet to be identified.\n\nZebra Loach (Botia striata)\n\nZebra Loach is a widespread aquarium fish. It is also known as the Candy Stripe Loach and is one of the few peaceful fish suitable for a community tank.\n\nThis freshwater fish grows only about 3.5 inches long. The bold vertical stripes on its body are the obvious reasons for its common name. It is one of the species in the Botia family.\n\nIt is a bottom dweller and a good choice for a beginner hobbyist. This fish is not sexually dimorphic, but the females usually have a much more rounded abdomen than the males.\n\nThis fish is an omnivore. But it primarily prefers live foods. It is a notorious consumer of snails. If you have a snail population crisis in your tank, you can keep one. You can also feed it other foods like bloodworm, glass worm, and brine shrimp.\n\nZebra Tilapia (Heterotilapia buttikoferi)\n\nZebra Tilapia is an aggressive freshwater fish. It is usually housed in a species-only tank or with other aggressive cichlids of its size. Zebra Tilapia is an omnivorous aquarium fish with an attitude.\n\nThis fish is very aggressive and will knock down your decorations. You want to use a large tank to provide adequate swimming room for them.\n\nSecure your decorations in the aquarium so this fish does not displace them in their frenzy.\n\nIt is also a very prolific waste producer. If you are keeping some, you want to frequently change the water and ensure that the water parameters are stable and correct at all times.\n\nZebra Danios (Danio rerio)\n\nZebra Danios are one of the popular aquarium fish in the hobby. They are schooling fish, and they love slow-moving to still freshwater bodies.\n\nThey usually reach no more than a length of 1 – 1.5 inches at the adult stage. If you want to keep this fish, keeping at least 8-10 of them in a tank would be best.\n\nA fascinating aspect of Zebra Danios is their regenerative ability. This fish has the ability to regenerate organs in its body after an injury or amputation. This is the reason most people prefer this fish for research purposes.\n\nZebra Moray (Gymnomuraena zebra)\n\nThis benthic fish is the only member of the genus Gymnomuraena. It is common in the Indo-pacific, specifically the coast of East Africa through the western coast of the Americas.\n\nThe Zebra Moray is a dangerous fish species. It usually grows up to a maximum length of 59 inches. But its average length is 2 inches. It gets its common name from the densely banded white and black stripes around its body.\n\nThis fish is not much of a browser. It has its preference. Its food options are specific; it eats only crustaceans, mollusks, and sea urchins.\n\nZebra Pleco (Hypancistrus zebra)\n\nZebra Pleco is another great aquarium fish that starts with the letter Z. It is a South American freshwater fish. Zebra plecos can be found in the rivers and streams of Brazil.\n\nImperial Pleco is another name for this fish. It is a shy fish and will typically hide under rocks and caves. It is also nocturnal. It is expensive because it is not as widespread as the other pleco species.\n\nIt is a beautiful fish. One indispensable fact about this fish is that it loves algae. It typically takes its time to scrape algae off rocks and will compete with other fish in the tank for the last bit of algae.\n\nZebra Lionfish (Dendrochirus zebra)\n\nZebra Lionfish is an impressive saltwater fish. You can find it in the Indo-pacific tropical waters. It is also referred to as the Zebra Turkeyfish.\n\nIts maximum length is around 10 inches. This fish is a bottom-dwelling fish species that likes to stay on reef flats, coral, and rock bottoms. It has vertical orange, black and white stripes on its pectoral fins. Its pectoral fins are fan-like.\n\nThey are often broadened anytime the Zebra Lionfish lays on the seabed. This fish belongs to the Scorpionfish family. It may appear peaceful, but it is a dangerous fish. It has 13 venomous spines lined along its back for defense.\n\nZander (Sander lucioperca)\n\nThis ray-finned fish is another interesting fish that starts with the letter z. It is also known as Sander and Pikeperch.\n\nThis ray-finned fish is not one of the fishes commonly kept and traded in the hobby. It has a length of about 20-26 inches. Zander juveniles are usually kept and traded in the hobby, but their place is in the wild.\n\nZander fish is almost as muscular as the Northern Pike. This makes it one of the fishes often caught for food in Europe. Apart from catching it for food, it is also one of the many game fishes in Eurasia.\n\nZebra Bullhead Shark (Heterodontus zebra)\n\nZebra Bullhead Shark is not the least on our list of fish that start with z. This fish is a type of catfish that is popular in Europe. You can also find them in Asia, especially in the central Indo-Pacific.\n\nThis bottom-dwelling shark has an appearance like a catfish. It has vertical grayish-black stripes like a zebra and a large, somewhat broad head. This is probably the main reason it is called a Zebra Bullhead Shark.\n\nIts maximum length is usually around 41 inches. Like a shark, it feeds on smaller fishes and invertebrates. It is a curious and aggressive fish.\n\nList of Fish Beginning With Z\n\nCheck out the lists below for more options to choose from when choosing the right fish for your tank.\n\nFreshwater Fish Beginning With Z\n\nZander (Sander lucioperca)\n\nZebra Danios (Danio rerio)\n\nZebra Loach (Botia striata)\n\nZebra Oto (Otocinclus cocama)\n\nZebra Pleco (Hypancistrus zebra)\n\nZiege (Pelecus cultratus)\n\nZingel (Zingel streber)\n\nSaltwater Fish Beginning With Z\n\nZebra Bream (Diplodus cervinus)\n\nZebra Bullhead Shark (Heterodontus zebra)\n\nZebra Lionfish (Dendrochirus zebra)\n\nZebra Moray (Gymnomuraena zebra)\n\nZebra Shark (Stegostoma fasciatum)\n\nImage Credit:\n\nLoaches.com\n\nTfhmagazine.com\n\nsource https://aquariumlabs.com/fish-that-start-with-z/\n\nWhen setting up a new tank, choosing a filter is one of the most important things you will do.\n\nAnd the two most popular varieties are canister filters and hang-on-back (HOB) filters.\n\nBoth will provide clean water for an aquarium. But they offer advantages and drawbacks that may make one better or worse for you.\n\nIn this article, we will consider the many canister and HOB filter pros and cons in a balanced way to help you decide what’s best for your fish tank!\n\nWhy Is Choosing The Right Filter Important?\n\nDifferent filtration system designs can serve different needs for fish owners. Since not every tank is the same, we need the right tool for a particular setup.\n\nHow Do Canister And HOB Filters Work?\n\nWhen comparing a canister filter vs hob filters, there are quite a few similarities. Both kinds are designed to filter aquarium water using three tried and true strategies:\n\nMechanical Filtration\n\nMechanical filtration is the simplest way to filter water in an aquarium. It consists of using physical screens to catch any small particles that are suspended in the water. Some media options include cotton floss, felt fabric, sand, and diatomaceous earth.\n\nThe finer the screen, the smaller the particles the mechanical filter material can catch.\n\nThis video is an excellent breakdown of what aquarium filter carbon is and how it works to polish your tank water!\n\nChemical Filtration\n\nChemical filtration uses chemical reactions to change pollutants into harmless material.\n\nOr they can bind free-floating molecules to the media itself. Activated charcoal is the most popular chemical filtration method.\n\nIt works by binding free-floating organic molecules to itself. But it needs to be swapped out every few weeks as it gets used up.\n\nBiological Filtration\n\nThe last of the three ways to clean a tank’s water is arguably the most important. Biological filtration works when beneficial bacterial development is encouraged by the design of your aquarium filter.\n\nBiological filtration is what breaks down the ammonia released as fish waste.\n\nAmmonia also comes from the action of rot-causing bacteria as they feed on leftover food, fish poop, and other sources of organic matter.\n\nAmmonia is very toxic to aquarium life (though it is a great plant fertilizer).\n\nFortunately, the beneficial bacteria found in an established (cycled) aquarium use this as food, converting it into the less toxic chemical nitrite. Unfortunately, nitrite is still not great for fish and invertebrates.\n\nFortunately, a second set of bacteria eat that, converting it into nitrate.\n\nNitrate then accumulates until you remove it via water changes. Plants can also use nitrate as fertilizer, but they prefer ammonia and nitrite and will suck those chemicals up first whenever they can.\n\nThere are many strategies to make this filtration model work. Bio wheels are commonly found on power filter designs like those made by Marineland Penguin.\n\nHowever, you can use any material with a large enough surface area for bacteria to colonize. Canister filters often use ceramic media or lava rock to provide ample biological filtration for a tank.\n\nCanister Filter VS HOB Filters: What Are the Main Differences?\n\nThe differences between a canister filter vs hob filters may not be obvious at first. After all, both sets of equipment do the same thing. Both power filters and canister filters\n\nFilter Media Chambers: Canister filters tend to have larger media chambers that are easier to customize. This makes them more versatile and effective in a wider range of circumstances\n\nEase of Maintenance: A HOB power filter is much easier to both setup and maintain, both in terms of use as well as the time it takes to keep it running properly\n\nPrice: Most HOB filter designs are cheaper than a canister filter rated for the same sized fish tank\n\nWhat Are The Benefits Of A Canister Filter?\n\nThere are quite a few canister filter pros to consider when shopping for a primary filter! They are especially good for planted or saltwater aquarium systems, where crystal clear aquarium water is needed.\n\nCanister filters offer the most customizable filtration experience in the aquarium hobby.\n\nThis is because the interior has loads of extra space for any kind of media you want to add. Water is forced through at high pressurization, so bypassing of the media rarely happens inside a canister filter unit.\n\nMost aquarists prefer the tried and true duo of activated carbon and cotton floss. If these are your favorite media options, then a hang-on-back filter might be all you really need.\n\nBut a canister filter allows you to use more exotic options with ease. Lava rock and ceramic bio-rings are a great choice that don’t always fit inside hang-on-back filter chambers.\n\nAmmonia-absorbing zeolite resin and phosphate removing media are also handy, especially for saltwater aquariums full of sensitive corals.\n\nCanister filters also make it easier to install accessories like an inline heater vs hang-on-back filters, which usually have a short, hard outlet tube.\n\nSome even have these accessories built-in already. You can even get a UV stabilizer to kill single-celled bacteria and algae that the lift tube picks up.\n\nFor medium-sized aquariums of 40-75 gallons, the Fluval 307 is a popular option. This canister filter includes rubberized components that ensure the unit runs ultra-quiet while processing tank water.\n\nAre Canister Filters Better Than HOB Filters?\n\nA canister filter is not better than a HOB power filter; it is simply a different way of purifying tank water.\n\nIt is true that a canister filter will hold more media and often has a more powerful pump compared to a HOB filter rated for the same fish tank.\n\nBut there are tradeoffs; a canister filter is almost always more expensive than an equivalent HOB filter. They also hold more filter media which means you have to spend more to fill them.\n\nAnd filter maintenance can be more complicated since canister filters don’t usually have drop-in cartridges as many HOB filters do.\n\nA media change can be done in 5 minutes with many HOB filter designs using a preconstructed bag of cotton and activated carbon.\n\nBut a canister filter requires you to seal the inlet tubes, remove the unit from under the tank, open it, and sort through several messy filter media chambers.\n\nThis difficulty means that HOB filters are a much better choice for beginning aquarists.\n\nAs well as for fish tanks where the inhabitants aren’t especially sensitive, such as most of the freshwater fish found in pet stores.\n\nDo You Really Need a Canister Filter?\n\nFor saltwater aquarium keepers, a canister filter is usually a better choice.\n\nSaltwater and reef aquariums have a much lower tolerance for elevated ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels.\n\nMarine fish and corals will stress and die faster than freshwater fish tank inhabitants.\n\nCanister filters have much larger compartments for filter media.\n\nThis, in turn, means you can provide more chemical filtration and biological filtration compared to most hob filters.\n\nWhat Are The Benefits Of An HOB Filter?\n\nAt first glance, you might think power filters are inferior to canister filters.\n\nAfter all, they have smaller media chambers and are less customizable.\n\nMany also don’t turn over aquarium water nearly as effectively in a larger tank since the pumps are typically smaller.\n\nBut many of the best hob filter designs are ideal for small tanks and medium-sized tank setups.\n\nSometimes canister filtering systems are overkill for simple setups.\n\nWhat if you are keeping hardy freshwater community fish species like guppies, barbs, corydoras, and other fish?\n\nIf so, then a canister filter really isn’t required for happy, healthy fish.\n\nSo long as the tank isn’t overstocked and you aren’t overfeeding, you may only see minimal water quality improvements by running a canister filter.\n\nIt’s when you need to track trace amounts of nitrate, phosphate, and other pollutants that a canister filter becomes the preferred model.\n\nThe price of most HOB filter designs compared to even a basic canister filter is also a solid benefit.\n\nThe AquaClear line of fish tank filters are favorites of ours due to their fine balance of effective water flow, filtration, and affordability!\n\nAre HOB Filters Better Than Canister Filter?\n\nA HOB filter is a good alternative to a canister filter. But in most cases, you are fine with either option.\n\nIf cost is not an issue, then I would choose a canister filter for setups larger than 55 gallons since they do a better job with larger volumes of water.\n\nBut for smaller aquarium sizes, a HOB filter will do a fine job.\n\nA HOB filter is also an excellent secondary filter if you have large tanks with canister filters already running on them.\n\nMaybe there is a dead zone on the opposite end of the aquarium where water isn’t getting properly turned over.\n\nOr you’ve just upgraded to larger tanks but don’t want to throw out a canister filter that is working perfectly.\n\nAdding a small HOB filter can help by adding some extra biological, chemical, and mechanical filtration capacity!\n\nWrapping Things Up\n\nThis heated debate does not have a clear conclusion since both will provide clean water for your tank. It really depends on what you need for your aquarium.\n\nBoth kinds of filters provide space for filter material. They also provide biological, mechanical, and chemical filtration.\n\nBut the main difference is that canister filters are much better at providing plenty of space for beneficial bacteria to colonize since their media chambers are so much larger.\n\nThey also make chemical filtration easier since you can add any media you prefer in larger amounts.\n\nWhen comparing canister vs hang-on-back filters, the amount of water flow depends mostly on how powerful the unit’s pump is as well as whether you are maintaining a proper maintenance schedule.\n\nIf you are lax with maintenance, a hang-on-back tank filter is a better choice. These external filters are easier to maintain, often only taking 5 minutes for you to swap cartridges in and out.\n\nA single HOB filter is more than enough for aquariums 40 gallons or less in volume. For 50-75 gallon aquariums, you should weigh the pros and cons of a canister filter vs hob filter since either one is a good choice.\n\nFor a larger tank, canister filters are usually the best choice, especially when keeping fish that produce loads of waste.\n\nHowever, a HOB filter can provide extra filtration on top of a canister filter. Or even two HOB filters.\n\nsource https://aquariumlabs.com/canister-filter-vs-hob/\n\nIntroduction\n\nHave you ever wondered about the number of fish names beginning with E in the wild? We did; hence we explored the aquatic realm to see what the numbers looked like.\n\nWe wrote this article based on what caught our attention and what we saw from the content we researched to share our results with you to help you learn more about these fish names.\n\nWe’ve featured a wide range of saltwater and freshwater fish, some suitable for aquariums and others especially adapted to the wild. The difficult-to-read words within parentheses beside each fish name are Latin and comprise the scientific fish name.\n\nThese Latin names are utilized all across the globe and might help you identify a fish.\n\nSeveral distinct fish names share the same genus name but have separate species names. The genus typically starts with a capital letter, whereas the species generally starts with a small letter.\n\nCommon Fish Names That Start With E\n\nSo, when conducting our investigation, these five fish beginning with E drew our attention. They make excellent pets, and a few of them are plain fascinating!\n\nIf you want either of these fish in your tank, be sure to look up their scientific nomenclature so you can be certain you’re buying the correct fish.\n\nEduard’s Mbuna (Pseudotropheus socolofi)\n\nAre we the only one, or does the Eduard’s Mbuna appear to be a deep shade of blue?\n\nWe are not only discussing about the hue here; this cichlid appears to be depressed! These fish, also called the Powder Blue Cichlids, are unique to Lake Malawi and have a variety of blue colors.\n\nThey love shallower tanks and waters with numerous rocks, particularly in the style of caves. Despite the fact that Eduard’s Mbuna eat frozen and live feed, they prefer blanched spinach and spirulina flakes.\n\nNotwithstanding the hostile stance of several other cichlid fish out there, Mbuna may be relatively tranquil if it isn’t kept with a fish that has a substantially bigger body or shape.\n\nHap Electric Blue (Sciaenochromis ahli)\n\nHap Electric Blue is yet another gorgeous blue fish from Lake Malawi. Sciaenochromis ahli is cichlid fish that is even less hostile than its Eduard’s Mbuna counterpart.\n\nThey prefer to burrow in rocky regions and look for little fish to eat, so don’t match them with just about any fish that’ll fit into their mouth readily.\n\nThis fish is ideal for new fish enthusiasts since it is reasonably simple to care for. Ensure that you keep up with your tank cleaning since these cichlids are susceptible to Malawi bloat, a fish sickness that may render your cichlid extremely unwell.\n\nElectric Catfish (Malapterurus electricus)\n\nUtilizing unique gland cells located on the sides of its skin, Malapterurus electricus can generate an electrical shock of about four hundred volts. They shock their victims with electrical currents, rendering them simpler to kill and catch.\n\nThey aren’t proven to induce human death, though. To gain an image of its underwater habitat, the fish employs electricity similar to radar.\n\nElephant-Nose Cichlid (Nimbochromis linni)\n\nThe Elephant Nose, which originated in Northern Africa in the River Nile, does have a trunk-like protrusion that it utilizes to hunt for food, protect itself, navigate across water, and interact.\n\nIt is generally a shy loner who needs a fifty-gallon tank to live in.\n\nElephantnose Fish (Gnathonemus petersii)\n\nThis adorable creature has a wonderful trunk-like bottom lip that is utilized for burrowing and digging.\n\nElephantnose Fish prefer muddy river bottoms; therefore, you’ll require a more densely vegetated aquarium with a softer bottom if you maintain them inside the tank.\n\nGnathonemus petersii prefers shady hiding spots and light; therefore, the flora you pick should be capable of thriving in it. If you wish to maintain Elephantnose fish, include smooth rocks and driftwood inside your aquarium.\n\nEmerald Catfish (Corydoras splendens)\n\nThe Emerald Catfish have a lovely green luster, much like emeralds!\n\nThey are also called Emerald ‘Brochis,’ plus they like to reside in quiet water course. They prefer to live at a tank’s bottom, where the slower/absence of current is optimal.\n\nCorydoras splendens is one other fish on our checklist that prefers to hide, so offer driftwood or perhaps some sort of shelter to make these corys content.\n\nEye Spot Sleeper (Tateurndina ocellicauda)\n\nThis small fish, commonly called Peacock Goby, has an odd common name: the Eye Spot Sleeper.\n\nThese fish prefer to cruise in shoals in the wild and may be seen in rivers, ponds, and streams, so maintaining a small bunch would be excellent.\n\nThey could be hostile toward their own kind; provided that there are lots of covered/shaded areas inside your aquarium, they ought to get along great though.\n\nRasboras, tetras, or rainbow fish — any sort of gentle fish, so far, they’re little – are excellent tank companions for these gobies.\n\nCollection of Fish that Begin with E\n\nWe want to inform you of a few more wonderful fish beginning with the letter E, so below are the listings. Find saltwater and freshwater fish that might become your very next aquarium companion.\n\nFreshwater Fish that start with E:\n\nEarthworm Eel (Chaudhuria caudata)\n\nEarth Eater (Satanoperca jurupari)\n\nEdible Gourami (Osphronemus gourami)\n\nEastern Mudminnow (Umbra pygmea)\n\nEgyptian Mouthbrooder (Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor)\n\nEel Loach (Pangio anguillaris\n\nEight-Barb Loach (Lefua costata)\n\nElectric Knifefish (Apteronotus albifrons)\n\nElectric Eel (Electrophorus electricus)\n\nElegant Rasbora (Rasbora elegans elegans)\n\nElectric Yellow Hap (Labidochromis caeruleus)\n\nElongated Lepidiolamprologus (Lepidiolamprologus elongatus)\n\nElephant-Nose Cichlid (Nimbochromis linni)\n\nEmpire Gudgeon (Hypseleotris compressa)\n\nEmperor Tetra (Nematobrycon palmeri)\n\nEspe’s Pencilfish (Nannostomus espei)\n\nEntsuyui (Myxocyprinus asiaticus)\n\nEuropean chub (Squalius cephalus)\n\nEthiopian Lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus aethiopicus)\n\nEuropean Minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus)\n\nEuropean Eel (Anguilla anguilla)\n\nEuropean Wels (Silurus glanis)\n\nEuropean Perch (Perca fluviatilis)\n\nEverglades Pygmy Sunfish (Elassoma evergladei)\n\nEye-Lined Pyrrhulina (Pyrrhulina rachoviana)\n\nEye Spot Loach (Acanthocobitis botia)\n\nSaltwater that fish start with E:\n\nEel (Anguilla sp.)\n\nEagle Ray (Aetomylaeus bovinus)\n\nEel-Goby (Odontamblyopus lacepedii)\n\nEel Cod (Muraenolepis microps)\n\nEeltail Catfish (Euristhmus microceps)\n\nEelpout (Gymnelus hemifasciatus)\n\nElectric Ray (Torpedo marmorata)\n\nElasmobranch (Elasmobranchii [Subclass])\n\nEmber Parrotfish (Scarus rubroviolaceus)\n\nElephant Fish (Callorhinchus milii)\n\nEmperor Bream (Lethrinus obsoletus)\n\nEmperor Angelfish (Pomacanthus imperator)\n\nEucla Cod (Euclichthys polynemus)\n\nEscolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum)\n\nEuropean Flounder (Platichthys flesus)\n\nEulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus)\n\nImage Credit:\n\nDreamstime.com\n\nThinkfish.co.uk\n\nShutterstock.com\n\nsource https://aquariumlabs.com/fish-that-start-with-e/\n\nHave you ever wondered what fish start with the letter I?\n\nThere are quite a few different fish that fall into this category, and here, we’ll take a look at some of them.\n\nWhether you’re an experienced fisherman or just curious about fish names, this is the list for you, so, without further ado, let’s get started!\n\nList of Fish Beginning With I\n\nThere aren’t too many fish that starts with I when compared to the other letters. While the letter I may be lacking in fish names, there are many interesting species of fish here, including sharks and beautiful tank fish.\n\nWe’ve split them into freshwater and saltwater fish and highlighted the most popular fish in each of these groups along with their scientific names.\n\nLet’s check them out!\n\nFreshwater Fish Beginning With I\n\nIce Blue Red Top Zebra (Metriaclima greshakei)\n\nThe Ice Blue Red Top Zebra (Metriaclima greshakei) is a species of fish native to Lake Malawi in Africa. The fish is easily recognizable by its bright blue and red coloration.\n\nThe fish is relatively peaceful and can be kept in an aquarium with other fish species. However, the fish does require a large tank, as it can grow to be up to 8 inches in length. Overall, they are a beautiful and hardy fish that makes a great addition to any freshwater aquarium.\n\nIndian Glassfish (Parambassis ranga)\n\nThe Indian Glassfish (Parambassis ranga) is a tropical freshwater fish native to India and Bangladesh. It grows to a length of around 4 inches (10 cm) and is characterized by its transparent body.\n\nThey are a popular aquarium fish and are also used in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nTheir transparency makes it difficult for predators to identify and eat them, which can lead to population explosions.\n\nAs a result, they have the potential to cause significant ecological damage if left unchecked.\n\nIndian Spiny Loach (Lepidocephalichthys thermalis)\n\nThe Indian Spiny Loach (Lepidocephalichthys thermalis) is a species of fish native to India and Nepal. It is a member of the Cobitidae family, which includes other loaches such as the clown loach and the weather loach.\n\nIt grows to a maximum length of 15 cm (6 in) and is characterized by its spiny fins and dark coloration. Its diet consists primarily of small invertebrates, which it hunts using its keen sense of smell.\n\nThe Indian Spiny Loach is a popular aquarium fish and is often kept in community tanks with other peaceful fish species. However, it can be shy and reclusive and may hide for long periods if it feels threatened.\n\nIridescent Shark (Pangasius hypophthalmus)\n\nThe Iridescent Shark, also known as the Pangasius hypophthalmus, is a freshwater fish that is native to Southeast Asia. With one of the most common fish names, this is a member of the catfish family and can grow to be over three feet long.\n\nIridescent Sharks are characterized by their iridescent silver scales and long, flowing fins.\n\nIt is a popular aquarium fish and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine. Iridescent Sharks are omnivores, and their diet includes algae, small crustaceans, and worms. It is a hardy fish and can live for up to 15 years.\n\nAs far as fish names go, the Iridescent Shark is a bit misleading as this is a peaceful fish, but it can be territorial towards other fish, so you need to be careful choosing tank mates.\n\nIt is not recommended for beginners, as it requires a large tank and regular care.\n\nInexpectatum Pleco (Hypoptopoma inexpectatum)\n\nThis is a small freshwater fish that is native to South America. Pleco, like cichlids and sharks, is another of the common names for fish, and this is a genus of the family Loricariidae, which includes over 700 species of armored catfishes.\n\nIt gets its name from its unique appearance; it has a long body and a broad, flattened head, and its skin is covered in small, bony plates.\n\nUnlike most other plecos, they don’t have any Barbels (filaments that hang from the mouth). It is tan or brown in coloration, with dark spots on its fins.\n\nThe Inexpectatum Pleco grows to an average length of 4-5 inches (10-12 cm). It is a peaceful fish that does well in community tanks. It is a bottom-dweller and does not require special feeding. It will feed on algae, detritus, and small insects.\n\nThe Inexpectatum Pleco is a hardy fish and relatively easy to care for.

They are the only known vertebrates to lack red blood cells, and as a result, they are translucent and not colorful.\n\nIcefish are also unique in that they have antifreeze proteins in their blood, which allows them to withstand the freezing temperatures of their habitat. These proteins bind to ice crystals, preventing them from growing.\n\nDespite their unusual features, icefish are not aggressive creatures that pose no threat to humans. In fact, they are often considered to be a food delicacy by those lucky enough to taste them.\n\nOther saltwater fish starting with I:\n\nImposter trevally\n\nIndian mackerels (Rastrelliger)\n\nIndonesian bamboo shark\n\nInshore hagfish\n\nsource https://aquariumlabs.com/fish-that-start-with-i/\n\nThere are many fish names that start with P.
