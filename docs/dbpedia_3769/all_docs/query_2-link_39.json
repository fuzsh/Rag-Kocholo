        "meta_description": "Fish classifications, as those of most other taxonomic groups, are being transformed drastically as new molecular phylogenies provide support for natural groups that were unanticipated by previous studies. A brief review of the main criteria used by ichthyologists to define their classifications during the last 50&nbsp;years, however, reveals slow progress towards using an explicit phylogenetic framework. Instead, the trend has been to rely, in varying degrees, on deep-rooted anatomical concepts and authority, often mixing taxa with explicit phylogenetic support with arbitrary groupings. Two leading sources in ichthyology frequently used for fish classifications (JS Nelson’s volumes of Fishes of the World and W. Eschmeyer’s Catalog of Fishes) fail to adopt a global phylogenetic framework despite much recent progress made towards the resolution of the fish Tree of Life. The first explicit phylogenetic classification of bony fishes was published in 2013, based on a comprehensive molecular phylogeny ( www.deepfin.org ). We here update the first version of that classification by incorporating the most recent phylogenetic results. The updated classification presented here is based on phylogenies inferred using molecular and genomic data for nearly 2000 fishes. A total of 72 orders (and 79 suborders) are recognized in this version, compared with 66 orders in version 1. The phylogeny resolves placement of 410 families, or ~80% of the total of 514 families of bony fishes currently recognized. The ordinal status of 30 percomorph families included in this study, however, remains uncertain (incertae sedis in the series Carangaria, Ovalentaria, or Eupercaria). Comments to support taxonomic decisions and comparisons with conflicting taxonomic groups proposed by others are presented. We also highlight cases were morphological support exist for the groups being classified. This version of the phylogenetic classification of bony fishes is substantially improved, providing resolution for more taxa than previous versions, based on more densely sampled phylogenetic trees. The classification presented in this study represents, unlike any other, the most up-to-date hypothesis of the Tree of Life of fishes.",

        "text": "The phylogenetic framework for this version of the classification (version 4) is based on a recent update of the fish Tree of Life [27] with the addition of four clades obtained by large-scale phylogenetic studies: cypriniforms [102], non-cypriniform otophysans (i.e., Characiformes, Siluriformes and Gymnotiformes; [101]), percomorphs [92], and syngnatharians [103]. Input subtrees were time-scaled using the R [110] package Ape (“chronos” function [111]) and grafted to the backbone tree using custom R code (see Additional files 1 and 2) based on secondary age calibrations and functions implemented in the R package phytools [112]. The secondary calibrations were obtained from a Bayesian analysis of a subset of 201 taxa with 61 fossil age constraints (primary calibrations). Further details on phylogenetic inference, fossil calibrations, and divergence time estimates are given in the original study [8]. This study does not intend to provide a new time scale for fish evolution; instead, it provides a synthesis of our current knowledge of fish divergence times into the extended phylogenetic tree assembled herein. Shallow-level relationships and ages for many specific groups should be taken cautiously.\n\nThe complete time tree includes 1990 species of extant bony fishes and two chondrichthyian outgroups (Figs. 1 and 2). This revision preserves names and taxonomic composition of groups presented in previous versions as much as possible; however, adjustments have been made to recognize well-supported clades, many of which have been obtained by other recent studies. Criteria for recognizing and naming clades, as in previous versions, include measures of support (bootstrap) and consistent resolution obtained by independent studies (indicated in each case). For stability purposes, we adopt some names proposed in the most recent edition of Fishes of the World [42] when they do not contradict our phylogeny (Fig. 2). Examples include classification of suborders in Osmeriformes, Zeiformes and Beryciformes, validation of Trachichthyiformes and recognition of Acanthopterygii. A complete list of 29 changes made in accordance with JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42] is presented in Additional file 3B. Many of the groups classified by JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42], however, are incongruent with our phylogeny and are thus not recognized. Examples of non-monophyletic taxa, as circumscribed by JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42], but not recognized here include Osmeromorpha, Zoroteleostei and Moroniformes. Others are recognized here, but have considerably different circumscriptions (e.g., Scombriformes, Perciformes). Tables 1 and 2 provide an exhaustive comparison of ordinal and supraordinal taxa and families that differ between this classification and JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42], respectively. Table 2 also lists differences with families recognized by R Van Der Laan, WN Eschmeyer and R Fricke [62].\n\nA total of 72 orders and 79 suborders of bony fishes are classified in this version (compared to only 66 orders in version 1). For each order/suborder we list all families examined as well as the unexamined families whose inclusion is expected on the basis of traditional classifications or other phylogenetic evidence. Order-level or supraordinal taxa are herein endorsed based on well-supported clades (>90% bootstrap values) or based on clades featuring lower support in the current tree, which are otherwise consistently obtained by other studies. In some cases, order-level taxa that are not monophyletic in our analysis are also validated, provided the incongruence is not substantially rejected by our results (i.e., incongruent clades that are poorly supported in our phylogeny). The classification is presented in phylogenetic order up to the subordinal rank (following the branching order in our tree), but families within orders and suborders are listed alphabetically (including hyperlinks to FishBase; Additional file 3A only).\n\nFamily names are largely based on R Van Der Laan, WN Eschmeyer and R Fricke [62] and WN Eschmeyer and JD Fong [113], but with several exceptions (Table 2). These studies should be consulted for authorship of family names. A total of 514 families of bony fishes are now recognized (excluding tetrapods), of which 410 (~80%) are included in our large-scale phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). The list of 104 unexamined families can be obtained from Additional file 4 (spreadsheet) that also contains the complete classification, and is intended as a resource to stimulate future phylogenetic studies. To minimize the number of non-monophyletic taxa, we have changed the membership of some traditionally recognized families whose validity is strongly challenged by phylogenetic evidence. For instance, we no longer recognize families such as Carapidae, Scaridae, Caesionidae, and Microdesmidae (lumped with Ophidiidae, Labridae, Lutjanidae, and Gobiidae, respectively). Five lineages currently recognized as separate family-level entities (“Cyclopsettidae”, “Percalatidae”, “Percophidae”, “Rivulidae” and “Pantanodontidae”) await formal nomenclatural description in compliance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). The ordinal status of 30 percomorph families (vs. 50 in version 1) included in the Series Carangaria, Ovalentaria, or Eupercaria remains uncertain due to either poor phylogenetic resolution or data unavailability. We therefore list these families as incertae sedis within each of these groups (Carangaria, Ovalentaria, or Eupercaria) awaiting new phylogenetic evidence to clarify their ordinal status. Twenty-three non-monophyletic families according to the framework phylogeny (Fig. 2) are recognized in this version (vs. 40 in version 1): Acropomatidae, Alepocephalidae, Bathydraconidae, Bathymasteridae, Chaenopsidae, Cheilodactylidae, Chlorophthalmidae, Clupeidae, Gempylidae, Grammatidae, Hemiramphidae, Ipnopidae, Labrisomidae, Nototheniidae, Paralepididae, Phosichthyidae, Scombridae, Scopelarchidae, Scorpaenidae, Stichaeidae, Synodontidae, Trachichthyidae, and Zenarchopteridae (see details below). Non-monophyly in these cases may be the result of poor resolution. These families are validated for stability purposes until additional evidence elucidating their status becomes available.\n\nWe cite sources for morphological synapomorphies for clades we have found in the literature. But there are caveats: (i) the original author/s may have polarized their characters using outgroups that are different than those appearing in this classification; (ii) we note that some suites of synapomorphies were meant for a more inclusive group than we recognize due to exclusion of one or more members of the previously recognized clade; and (iii) in some cases there is obvious conflict between morphological and molecular analyses. Our purpose is not to confirm these synapomorphies or to reject morphological conclusions that differ from our results. Rather, we seek to call attention to previously accomplished morphological analyses and to point out, where we can, conflicts and consilience between morphological and molecular studies, indicating groups that lack morphological support. See Additional file 3A for an indented and comment-free version of the classification.\n\nMegaclass Osteichthyes (= extant Euteleostomi)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see G Arratia and HP Schultze [114], P Janvier [115], P Ahlberg [116], M Zhu and HP Schultze [117], M Zhu, X Yu and P Janvier [118].\n\nSuperclass Actinopterygii (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see C Patterson [119], MI Coates [120], H-P Schultze and SL Cumbaa [121], R Cloutier and G Arratia [122], K Mickle [123].\n\nClass Cladistia (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see E Jarvik [124], R Britz and P Bartsch [125], AB Ward and NJ Kley [126].\n\nComments: polypteriforms or bichirs present a combination of characters that have led to their former identification as members of the Sarcopterygii (placed within Brachyopterygii). This view has changed since the implementation of explicit phylogenetic analyses, demonstrating that bichirs belong in Actinopterygii (e.g., [127]). Recent molecular analyses using the taxa necessary to assess the placement of bichirs (e.g., chondrichthyans, sarcopterygians and actinopterygians) have confirmed this view [8, 9].\n\nOrder Polypteriformes\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: same as Cladistia (extant taxa only).\n\nPolypteridae\n\nClass Actinopteri (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: few morphological studies provide support for this clade; e.g., R Lund and C Poplin [128] and G-H Xu, K-Q Gao and JA Finarelli [129]. Note, however, that R Lund and C Poplin [128] did not include in their study fossil and/or extant members of chondrosteans and neopterygians. Likewise, G-H Xu, K-Q Gao and JA Finarelli [129] used in their phylogenetic analyses the Cheirolepis as an outgroup, not as part of the ingroup, and their coding of Polypterus does not consider the homologization problems that polypteriforms versus other actinopterygians present, as highlighted by R Cloutier and G Arratia [122].\n\nComment: Although morphological studies on Actinopteri are scarce, the currently accepted branching of chondrosteans, holosteans and teleosts (Fig. 1) is supported by several molecular studies (e.g., [8, 10, 11, 88,89,90]).\n\nSubclass Chondrostei (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see G Arratia and HP Schultze [114], L Grande and WE Bemis [130], WE Bemis, EK Findeis and L Grande [131].\n\nOrder Acipenseriformes\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: same as Chondrostei (extant taxa only).\n\nAcipenseridae\n\nPolyodontidae\n\nSubclass Neopterygii (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see C Patterson and DE Rosen [47], BG Jamieson [132], L Grande [133], A López-Arbarello [134].\n\nInfraclass Holostei (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: L Grande [133].\n\nComment: Holostei was readopted by L Grande [133], after several decades of dismissal in ichthyology. Monophyly of Holostei has been also confirmed by several molecular studies (e.g., [8,9,10, 135]).\n\nOrder Amiiformes (= extant Halecomorphi).\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see L Grande and WE Bemis [16], G Arratia [136], G Arratia [137].\n\nComment: it should be noted that the three synapomorphies proposed by L Grande and WE Bemis [16] for amiiforms become homoplasies when other primitive teleosts, such as Triassic pholidophorids, are included in the phylogenetic analysis (see [136, 137]).\n\nAmiidae\n\nOrder Lepisosteiformes (= extant Ginglymodi) (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see EO Wiley [138], L Grande [133].\n\nLepisosteidae\n\nInfraclass Teleostei (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see G Arratia [17], G Arratia [136], G Arratia [46], G Arratia [137]. See also EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57].\n\nComment: Teleosteomorpha (or total group teleost including stem members), apomorphy-based Teleostei, and crown group Teleocephala in MCC de Pinna [139] are treated here as synonyms when only extant taxa are considered. However, we are aware that these three groups are diagnosed by different sets of synapomorphies (see G Arratia [46], G Arratia [137]). R Britz [140] criticism of the use of Teleosteomorpha and Teleocephala in his book review of Fishes of the World [42] lacks solid ground because no paleontologist or neoicthyologist is confused with the meaning of one name or the other, particularly when the concept followed is being explained. Nevertheless, we agree that the presentation of Teleocephala in JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42] is confusing and that the list of synapomorphies presented to support Teleocephala sensu MCC de Pinna [139] is a combination of three concepts.\n\nMegacohort Elopocephalai sensu G Arratia [17] (100%).\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see G Arratia [17].\n\nCohort Elopomorpha (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see G Arratia [17], G Arratia [136]; see also comments below.\n\nComments: while divergence of Elopomorpha at the base of teleosts is counter to the prevailing view that the Osteoglossomorpha represents the earliest branching teleost lineage [36, 40, 47, 141,142,143], substantial morphological [17, 25, 66, 136, 144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152] and molecular [8, 9, 153, 154] evidence favors elopomorphs as the first diverging teleosts. A more recent phylogenomic analysis based on 418 orthologous genes [155] obtained support for yet another topology – a sister-group relationship between elopomorphs and osteoglossomorphs. That study, however, has a limited taxonomic scope (12 taxa), with crucial lineages that bisect long branches missing (e.g., Hiodon, clupeiforms and Lepidogalaxias). Placement of Elopomorpha as sister to the remaining teleosts is herein maintained (i.e., it is congruent with the phylogeny presented in Figs. 1 and 2).\n\nOrder Elopiformes (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see PL Forey [156], GD Johnson and R Britz [157].\n\nElopidae\n\nMegalopidae\n\nOrder Albuliformes (95%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see PL Forey [156].\n\nAlbulidae\n\nOrder Notacanthiformes (92%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see PL Forey [156].\n\nHalosauridae\n\nNotacanthidae\n\nOrder Anguilliformes (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see PL Forey [156], GD Johnson, H Ida, J Sakaue, T Sado, T Asahida and M Miya [158], GD Johnson and R Britz [157].\n\nComment: suborders recognized in EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57] based on previous work cited therein are significantly incongruent with the clades obtained in this analysis; thus, no subordinal classification is proposed.\n\nAnguillidae\n\nCongridae\n\nEurypharyngidae\n\nMuraenesocidae\n\nMuraenidae\n\nNemichthyidae\n\nOphichthidae\n\nSaccopharyngidae\n\nSerrivomeridae\n\nNot examined: Chlopsidae, Cyematidae, Derichthyidae (including Colocongridae [158]), Heterenchelyidae, Monognathidae, Moringuidae, Myrocongridae, Nettastomatidae, Protanguillidae, Synaphobranchidae.\n\nMegacohort Osteoglossocephalai (= Osteoglossocephala sensu G Arratia [17]) (100%).\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see G Arratia [17], EJ Hilton [159], J-Y Zhang [160], MVH Wilson and AM Murray [161].\n\nSupercohort Osteoglossomorpha sensu G Arratia [17]\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see G Arratia [17], G Arratia [46], G Arratia [137]; see also comments under Elopomorpha above.\n\nComments: previous versions of the classification validated the supercohort Osteoglossocephala as well as the cohort Osteoglossomorpha, which were redundant in content. For simplicity and to avoid confusion —Osteoglossocephala sensu G Arratia [17] is the same as Osteoglossocephalai here and in previous versions, but not the same as Osteoglossocephala in previous versions — we now name this supercohort Osteoglossomorpha, but this change also means that the endings for the ranks cohort and supercohort are interchangeable.\n\nOrder Hiodontiformes (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see EJ Hilton [159], J-Y Zhang [160], MVH Wilson and AM Murray [161].\n\nHiodontidae\n\nOrder Osteoglossiformes (42%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see EJ Hilton [159], J-Y Zhang [160], MVH Wilson and AM Murray [161].\n\nComment: Osteoglossidae includes Arapaima and Heterotis, formerly in Arapaimidae [161].\n\nGymnarchidae\n\nMormyridae\n\nNotopteridae\n\nOsteoglossidae\n\nPantodontidae\n\nSupercohort Clupeocephala sensu G Arratia [48] (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see G Arratia [48].\n\nCohort Otomorpha (= Otocephala, Ostarioclupeomorpha) (92%).\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: Morphological characters supporting Otomorpha (but excluding Alepocephalidae) can be found in G Arratia [45], G Arratia [17], G Arratia [48], EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57].\n\nComments: Morphological support exists for the cohort Otomorpha, including only the subcohorts Clupei and Ostariophysi. According to G Arratia [17, 45, 48], otomorphs (her ostarioclupeomorphs) are clupeocephalans in which primitively there is an ankyloses or fusion between the mesial extrascapula and parietal alone or parietal and supraoccipital; hypurals 1 and 2 not joined by cartilage in any stage of growth, and autopalatine ossified early in ontogeny. Additionally, the presence of a modified uroneural or pleurostyle was listed as a potential synapomorphy because a pleurostyle is found in all extant otomorphs, but is absent in some of the primitive fossils of Clupei and Denticipitidae. Further research [48] re-interpreted the early ossification of the autopalatine as a clupeocephalan character, and EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57] listed a few potential synapomorphies. R Britz [140] considered the support of Otomorpha as “meagre.” To disprove the first character mentioned above, he used the condition present in advanced gonorynchiforms, the paedomorphic kneriids Cromeria and Grasseichthys, which lack parietal bones and consequently this loss represents a further transformation of the otomorph synapomorphy within the clade. The second character is questioned based on a supposedly cartilaginous connection between hypurals 1 and 2 in early developmental stages of the characiform Salminus, a connection that is not mentioned in the publication, but whose presence is unclear considering the unsatisfactory quality of preparation of the illustrated specimens in SMT Mattox, R Britz and M Toledo-Piza [162]. Such connection has not been described (or illustrated) in larvae of other otomorphs (see for instance [147, 163,164,165,166]).\n\nSubcohort Clupei (= Clupeomorpha) (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see L Grande [167].\n\nOrder Clupeiformes (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: same as Clupei.\n\nSuborder Denticipitoidei\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: L Grande [167], F Di Dario and MCC de Pinna [168], MCC de Pinna and F Di Dario [169].\n\nDenticipitidae\n\nSuborder Clupeoidei (98%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: L Grande [167], F Di Dario and MCC de Pinna [168], MCC de Pinna and F Di Dario [169].\n\nComment: family-level groupings may require major revision; Pristigasteridae, Chirocentridae and Engraulidae are supported by other molecular studies, but not Clupeidae [170, 171]; five well-supported lineages may become new families [171]. The family Sundasalangidae is no longer recognized because Sundasalanx is nested within Clupeidae (see also [172]). Clupeidae also includes the round herrings (subfamily Dussumieriinae [171]), sometimes placed in the family Dussumieriidae [62].\n\nChirocentridae\n\nClupeidae (not monophyletic in Fig. 2).\n\nEngraulidae\n\nPristigasteridae\n\nSubcohort Alepocephali (37%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see GD Johnson and C Patterson [49].\n\nComments: To the best of our knowledge, no morphological study has tested the molecular hypotheses that include the Alepocephaliformes as sister of Ostariophysi. However, as pointed out by JY Poulsen, PR Møller, S Lavoué, SW Knudsen, M Nishida and M Miya [173] “prior to the major publication of Greenwood et al. (1966), the prevailing hypothesis placed the Alepocephaliformes (with or without the Bathylaconidae) and the Clupeiformes (named Clupeoidei at this time) close to each other, within a larger group including other so-called “basal” or “primitive” teleosts, i.e., the “Isospondyli” (Berg, 1940; Bertin and Arambourg, 1958; Gosline, 1960; Marshall, 1966). Greenwood et al. (1966) tentatively transferred the Alepocephaliformes within the order Salmoniformes, only because these authors could not find any character to separate them from the Salmoniformes. However, they admitted: “there is little critical anatomical information on the Alepocephalidae, and any decision concerning their position must therefore be considered tentative… much more research is needed before the status of the Alepocephaloidei is understood.””\n\nOrder Alepocephaliformes\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: same as Alepocephali. Comment: Alepocephalidae includes Bathylaco, placed in Bathylaconidae by JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42], and the former Leptochilichthyidae [173, 174]. The position of alepocephaliforms as the sister group to Ostariophysi is contrary to their more traditional placement in Euteleostomorpha (e.g., [49]). Their current placement in Otomorpha has been consistently obtained by other molecular studies (e.g., [173, 174]).\n\nAlepocephalidae (not monophyletic in Fig. 2).\n\nPlatytroctidae\n\nSubcohort Ostariophysi (99%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see SV Fink and WL Fink [175], SV Fink and WL Fink [176].\n\nSection Anotophysa (= Anotophysi) (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see SV Fink and WL Fink [175], FJ Poyato-Ariza, T Grande and R Diogo [177], T Grande and FJ Poyato-Ariza [178], MP Davis, G Arratia and TM Kaiser [21].\n\nOrder Gonorynchiformes\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: same as Anotophysa.\n\nComment: suborders in Gonorynchiformes are no longer recognized. See also JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42]. The former Phractolaemidae is now listed as a subfamily in Kneriidae [21].\n\nGonorynchidae\n\nChanidae\n\nKneriidae\n\nSection Otophysa (= Otophysi) (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see SV Fink and WL Fink [175], SV Fink and WL Fink [176].\n\nComment: although most molecular studies (e.g., [72, 179]) are incongruent regarding otophysan interrelationships, our recent investigation of this question using genome-wide exon data coupled with a novel method for interrogating gene genealogies [101] provides overwhelming support for the null morphological hypothesis of SV Fink and WL Fink [175], which places the monophyletic characiforms sister to a clade including siluriforms and gymnotiforms. Three otophysan superorders (Cypriniphysae, Characiphysae and Siluriphysae) are now recognized. Their taxonomic composition is similar to that originally proposed by SV Fink and WL Fink [175], except that Characiphysae now contains a single order (Characiformes) following JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42].\n\nSuperorder Cypriniphysae (92%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see SV Fink and WL Fink [175], SV Fink and WL Fink [176], PM Mabee, EA Grey, G Arratia, N Bogutskaya, A Boron, MM Coburn, KW Conway, S He, A Naseka, N Rios, et al. [180], KW Conway [181].\n\nOrder Cypriniformes\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: same as Cypriniphysae.\n\nComments: recognition of suborders and families in Cypriniformes follows CC Stout, M Tan, AR Lemmon, EM Lemmon and JW Armbruster [102], which builds on WJ Chen and RL Mayden [182]. Note that the phylogenomic results by CC Stout, M Tan, AR Lemmon, EM Lemmon and JW Armbruster [102] differ from those derived from the analysis of morphological data (e.g., KW Conway [181], R Britz, K Conway and L Ruber [183]), in that the latter obtain a “Cobitoidea” sensu lato clade (including Gyrinocheilus, Catostomidae, and Cobitoidei sensu stricto), but there are relatively few characters that support that grouping and clade support is weak. This subordinal classification, with three suborders for “Cobitoidea”, is robust to phylogenetic uncertainty. Nodal support values of suborders are from CC Stout, M Tan, AR Lemmon, EM Lemmon and JW Armbruster [102].\n\nSuborder Gyrinocheiloidei (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see DJ Siebert [184], KW Conway [181], PM Mabee, EA Grey, G Arratia, N Bogutskaya, A Boron, MM Coburn, KW Conway, S He, A Naseka, N Rios, et al.

The rogue placement of Esomus in molecular and morphological analyses (see [102]) suggest that this genus may represent a distinct cyprinoid lineage, which is provisionally retained within Danionidae [102]. Recognition of Xenocyprididae is based on L Yang, T Sado, M Vincent Hirt, E Pasco-Viel, M Arunachalam, J Li, X Wang, J Freyhof, K Saitoh, AM Simons, et al.

They obtained two major clades within Sternopygoidei, which they named Rhamphichthyoidea (Rhamphichthyidae + Hypopomidae) and Sinusoidea (Sternopygidae + Apteronotidae). Although ranks for these clades are not explicit in their classification scheme, the endings suggest that these are superfamilies. According to the ICZN (article 61.2.2) “when a nominal taxon in the family group… is raised or lowered in rank, or its name is used at more than one rank simultaneously, the name-bearing type remains the same [Arts. 36.2, 43.1, 46.2].” In other words, the proper superfamily name for the “Sinusoidea” clade should be Sternopygoidea (suborder Sternopygoidei), to reflect a name-bearing type. Aside from these nomenclatural points, a phylogenomic-based gymnotiform clade (with a limited taxonomic sampling) does not support the monophyly of “Sinusoidea” [101]. Nodal support values of suborders are from D Arcila, G Ortí, RP Vari, JW Armbruster, MLJ Stiassny, K Ko, MH Sabaj, J Lundberg, LJ Revell and R Betancur-R.

For instance, alepocephalids have affinities within Otomorpha, instead of Argentiformes as proposed by GD Johnson and C Patterson [49] (e.g., [173]; see also comments under Alepocephali above); Lepidogalaxias (order Lepidogalaxiiformes) lies at the base of the euteleost tree (e.g., [201]), rendering Galaxiidae sensu lato non-monophyletic; Osmeriformes (considered a suborder of Salmoniformes by EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57]) and Stomiatiformes are sister orders (see also [76]), placed here in the subcohort Stomiati.\n\nSubcohort Lepidogalaxii\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see DE Rosen [202].\n\nOrder Lepidogalaxiiformes\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: same as Lepidogalaxii.\n\nLepidogalaxiidae\n\nSubcohort Protacanthopterygii sedis mutabilis (100%)\n\nComments: Circumscription of Protacanthopterygii is controversial (hence sedis mutabilis). JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42] restricted Protacanthopterygii to the clade including Salmoniformes and Esociformes. They also placed the orders Galaxiiformes and Argentiniformes, along with Stomiatiformes and Osmeriformes, in a new taxon they named Osmeromorpha. Circumscription of Osmeromorpha follows the results of the molecular phylogeny of CP Burridge, RM McDowall, D Craw, MVH Wilson and JM Waters [203]. Note that Burridge et al.’s study was designed to address intrafamilial galaxiid relationships. Their selection of non-galaxiid outgroups was only for time-calibration purposes; they did not intend to assess supraordinal relationships among early euteleosts. In addition to Osmeromorpha, JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42] classified a purported clade including most euteleosts, except for Lepidogalaxiiformes, Salmoniformes and Esociformes, in an unranked taxon named Zoroteleostei by MVH Wilson and RG Williams [204]. Circumscriptions of Osmeromorpha and Zoroteleostei sensu JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42] are incongruent with all recent higher-level phylogenetic analyses of fishes (i.e., [8,9,10, 27]).\n\nOrder Argentiniformes (47%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see GD Johnson and C Patterson [49].\n\nArgentinidae\n\nBathylagidae\n\nMicrostomatidae\n\nOpisthoproctidae\n\nOrder Galaxiiformes (94%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking.\n\nGalaxiidae\n\nOrder Salmoniformes (62%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see CJ Sanford [205], GD Johnson and C Patterson [49], [206].\n\nSalmonidae\n\nOrder Esociformes (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see GD Johnson and C Patterson [49].\n\nEsocidae\n\nUmbridae\n\nSubcohort Stomiati (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking\n\nComments: see comments under Protacanthopterygii above.\n\nOrder Stomiatiformes sensu DE Rosen [43] (= Stomiiformes sensu WL Fink and SH Weitzman [207]) (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see AS Harold and SH Weitzman [208], AS Harold [209].\n\nComments: suborders in Stomiatiformes are now recognized following JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42], except that their Phosichthyoidei is named Stomiatoidei herein (based on Stomiidae).\n\nSuborder Gonostomatoidei (54%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see AS Harold [209].\n\nComment: Diplophidae is no longer recognized as a separate family; it is listed as subfamily of Gonostomatidae in R Van Der Laan, WN Eschmeyer and R Fricke [62] and JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42].

Placement of Polymixiidae inside [69, 106, 220] or outside [8, 10, 11, 27] Paracanthopterygii is contentious.

[106]). Until further evidence for resolution of relationships among families becomes available, we refrain from classifying suborders and list all families alphabetically. The family Lotidae is no longer recognized here because it is not monophyletic (see also [106]); the three genera (Brosme, Lota, and Molva) formerly in Lotidae are now included in Gadidae (see also JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42]).

We place Polymixiidae in its own division (as opposed to Paracanthopterygii as in previous studies [69, 106, 220]) to recognize its rogue placement among early acanthomorph lineages. See also comments above under Paracanthopterygii.\n\nOrder Polymixiiformes\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: same as Polymixiipterygii.\n\nPolymixiidae\n\nDivision Acanthopterygii (= Euacanthomorphacea in previous versions) (95%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see MLJ Stiassny and JA Moore [52], GD Johnson and C Patterson [51], EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57] (but their circumscription of the group includes Zeiformes).\n\nComment: previous versions of this classification named this clade Euacanthomorphacea, a taxon recognized by GD Johnson and C Patterson [51] to include polymixiids, percopsids and crown acanthomorphs. Because polymixiids and percopsids are not members of this group, it seems reasonable to instead adopt Acanthopterygii, recognizing its extensive use in ichthyology. Note that Acanthopterygii was listed but not classified by EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57]. This change follows TJ Near, A Dornburg, RI Eytan, BP Keck, WL Smith, KL Kuhn, JA Moore, SA Price, FT Burbrink, M Friedman, et al. [11] and JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42]. For consistency, we also changed all Division suffixes to “-pterygii.”\n\nSubdivision Berycimorphaceae (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking for the entire group. A subgroup comprised of berycoids, trachichthyiforms and holocentriforms, but excluding stephanoberycoids has been recognized by presence of the Jakubowski’s organ and the absence of pharyngobranchial 4 [51]. This subgroup plus the zeiforms was also united by GD Johnson and C Patterson [51] with Percomorphaceae based on three hypothesized synapomorphies. These authors also hypothesized a sister-group relationship between Beryciformes (minus stephanoberycoids) and Percomorphaceae (forming the Euacanthopterygii) based on five other synapomorphies (see [57]). More recently, D Davesne, C Gallut, V Barriel, P Janvier, G Lecointre and O Otero [24] recognized holocentriforms as the sister to Percomorphaceae, as proposed originally by MLJ Stiassny and JA Moore [52]. We conclude that no current diagnosis based on morphological synapomorphies exists for this clade.\n\nComments: Beryciformes sensu lato (as in previous versions) is now split into Beryciformes sensu stricto (including Berycoidei and Stephanoberycoidei) and Trachichthyiformes sensu JA Moore [53], following JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42].\n\nOrder Beryciformes (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking for current circumscription; see JA Moore [53] and MLJ Stiassny and JA Moore [52].\n\nComment: beryciform suborders are now classified following JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42].\n\nSuborder Berycoidei (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking for current circumscription; see JA Moore [53] and MLJ Stiassny and JA Moore [52].\n\nBerycidae\n\nMelamphaidae\n\nSuborder Stephanoberycoidei (78%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see GD Johnson and C Patterson [49], JA Moore [53]. Note that GD Johnson and C Patterson [49] did not consider stephanoberycoids closely related to other beryciforms and suggested that JA Moore [53]‘s synapomorphies were ambiguous.\n\nBarbourisiidae\n\nCetomimidae\n\nRondeletiidae\n\nStephanoberycidae\n\nNot examined: Gibberichthyidae, Hispidoberycidae.\n\nOrder Trachichthyiformes sensu JA Moore [53] (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see JA Moore [53] and C Baldwin and GD Johnson [224].\n\nComment: The subordinal classification for Trachichthyiformes proposed by JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42] is incongruent with the phylogeny in Fig. 2 and is therefore not implemented herein.\n\nAnomalopidae\n\nAnoplogastridae\n\nDiretmidae\n\nMonocentridae\n\nTrachichthyidae (not monophyletic in Fig. 2)\n\nSubdivision Holocentrimorphaceae (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: MLJ Stiassny and JA Moore [52] and JA Moore [53] provided morphological evidence supporting a sister-group relationship between holocentrids and percomorphs, validating the placement of this family in its own order (but see [225, 226]). See also D Davesne, C Gallut, V Barriel, P Janvier, G Lecointre and O Otero [24].\n\nOrder Holocentriformes\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: same as Holocentrimorphaceae.\n\nHolocentridae\n\nSubdivision Percomorphaceae (= Percomorpha sensu M Miya, H Takeshima, H Endo, N Ishiguro, J Inoue, T Mukai, T Satoh, M Yamaguchi, A Kawaguchi, K Mabuchi, et al.

Recognition of Dinematichthyidae follows PR Møller, SW Knudsen, W Schwarzhans and JG Nielsen [231]; raised from subfamily Dinematichthyinae (formerly Bythitidae). These authors also lumped Aphyonidae with Bythitidae; thus, Aphyonidae is no longer validated. Finally, Parabrotulidae is also now synonymized with Bythitidae based on recent results by MA Campbell, JG Nielsen, T Sado, C Shinzato, M Kanda, TP Satoh and M Miya [232].\n\nDinematichthyidae\n\nBythitidae (includes the former Aphyonidae and Parabrotulidae).\n\nSeries Batrachoidaria (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see DW Greenfield, R Winterbottom and BB Collette [233], EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57] (references therein).\n\nOrder Batrachoidiformes\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: same as Batrachoidaria.\n\nBatrachoididae\n\nSeries Pelagiaria (= Stromateoidei sensu B Li, A Dettai, C Cruaud, A Couloux, M Desoutter-Meniger and G Lecointre [80]; = Pelagia sensu M Miya, M Friedman, TP Satoh, H Takeshima, T Sado, W Iwasaki, Y Yamanoue, M Nakatani, K Mabuchi, JG Inoue, et al.

The diagnosis provided by EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57], based on GD Johnson [235], includes families placed outside this clade in Fig. 2 (e.g., Istiophoridae). The circumscription of Scombriformes presented here is also incongruent with that of BB Collette, T Potthoff, WJ Richards, S Ueyanagi, JL Russo and Y Nishikawa [236] and other studies cited by EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57]. No morphological diagnosis exists for pelagiarians, representing a case of significant incongruence between morphological and molecular data. Despite the disparate morphology among members of Scombriformes, most are offshore fishes that inhabit pelagic environments (hence the clade name).\n\nOrder Scombriformes\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: same as Pelagiaria.\n\nComment: interfamilial resolution in Scombriformes is tenuous; classification of scombriform families into suborders (e.g., Scombroidei, Stromateoidei, Icosteoidei) or new orders requires further work.

Our delimitation of Kurtiformes is the same as Apogonoidei in CE Thacker, TP Satoh, E Katayama, RC Harrington, RI Eytan and TJ Near [242]. We also place Trichonotus in its own suborder (Trichonotoidei) in Gobiiformes (see comments below); note that Trichonotoidei sensu CE Thacker, TP Satoh, E Katayama, RC Harrington, RI Eytan and TJ Near [242] is equivalent to Gobiiformes here. Finally, Odontobutoidei and Eleotroidei, validated in previous versions of the classification, are now considered synonyms of Gobioidei.\n\nSuborder Trichonotoidei\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: JS Nelson [245], DG Smith and GD Johnson [246].\n\nComments: DG Smith and GD Johnson [246] allied Trichonotus with two families we place in the Pempheriformes (Creediidae and Hemerocoetidae) as subfamilies of an expanded Trichonotidae on the basis of specialized configuration of the suspensorium (following JS Nelson [245]). Placement of Trichonotoide here is based on molecular evidence from CE Thacker, TP Satoh, E Katayama, RC Harrington, RI Eytan and TJ Near [242], who identified Trichonotus as the sister lineage of the gobies (rendering Trichonotidae sensu DG Smith and GD Johnson [246] polyphyletic).\n\nNot examined: Trichonotidae.\n\nSuborder Gobioidei (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see R Winterbottom [247], GD Johnson and EB Brothers [248]; see also Gobiiformes in EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57].\n\nComments: recognition of Butidae, Oxudercidae and Milyeringidae follows CE Thacker [241] and CE Thacker, TP Satoh, E Katayama, RC Harrington, RI Eytan and TJ Near [242]. We now recognize Oxudercidae instead of Gobionellidae (Gobionellidae is a junior synonym). The former Microdesmidae, Kraemeriidae, Ptereleotridae, and Schindleriidae are now synonymized with Gobiidae [241, 242]. The former Xenisthmidae is now synonymized with Eleotridae [241]. Note that Schindleriidae was first recognized as a goby by GD Johnson and EB Brothers [248].\n\nEleotridae\n\nGobiidae\n\nOdontobutidae\n\nNot examined: Butidae, Milyeringidae, Oxudercidae (= Gobionellidae), Rhyacichthyidae, Thalasseleotrididae.\n\nSeries Anabantaria (= Anabantiformes sensu B Li, A Dettai, C Cruaud, A Couloux, M Desoutter-Meniger and G Lecointre [80]) (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking.\n\nComments: members of this group are mostly of freshwater origin and their geographic distribution is largely restricted to Africa and South East Asia (although some synbranchid species occur in Mexico and Central and South America).

However, according to M Friedman [258], some of these characters are symplesiomorphies while others are absent in the remaining carangimorph groups. Despite the apparent lack of morphological synapomorphies for carangimorphs there is a strong molecular signal supporting their monophyly (e.g., [8, 11, 27, 80, 92, 100, 259,260,261]). Inclusion of the billfishes (Istiophoriformes) in this series represents a significant departure from previous work in morphology where most studies placed them within or sister to the scombriforms (among pelagiarians) (see [57]).\n\nComment: Centropomidae includes the former Latidae, following PH Greenwood [262] and C Li, R Betancur-R., WL Smith and G Orti [82].\n\nOrder - level incertae sedis in Carangaria\n\nCentropomidae\n\nLactariidae\n\nLeptobramidae\n\nMenidae\n\nPolynemidae\n\nSphyraenidae\n\nToxotidae\n\nOrder Istiophoriformes (= superfamily Xiphiicae sensu I Nakamura [263]) (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see I Nakamura [263].\n\nComment: our tree (Fig. 2) does not support placement of Sphyraenidae in this order, as suggested by JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42].\n\nIstiophoridae\n\nXiphiidae\n\nOrder Carangiformes (not monophyletic in Fig. 2)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see GD Johnson [59], WF Smith-Vaniz [264].\n\nComment: monophyly of Carangiformes is not significantly rejected by the data [259].\n\nCarangidae\n\nCoryphaenidae\n\nEcheneidae\n\nNematistiidae\n\nRachycentridae\n\nOrder Pleuronectiformes (21%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see F Chapleau [265], TA Munroe [266].\n\nComment: although contentious (e.g., [261]), the monophyly of Pleuronectiformes is resolved by several molecular studies [92, 100, 259, 260].\n\nSuborder Psettodoidei (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see F Chapleau [265], TA Munroe [266].\n\nPsettodidae\n\nSuborder Pleuronectoidei (99%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see F Chapleau [265], TA Munroe [266].\n\nComment: Paralichthyidae is monophyletic if the Cyclopsetta group is included in its own family [259].

M Pohl, FC Milvertz, A Meyer and M Vences [283] identified a rogue placement for Pantanodon among cyprinodontiforms. The topology most often obtained by these authors included Pantanodon as sister to all cyprinodontoids. Formal description of a new family for Pantanodon is needed in compliance with the ICZN. The family Valenciidae is herein circumscribed to include the genus Aphanius (formerly in Cyprinodontidae), forming an Eurasian clade (following [283]).

Our new tree (Fig. 2) resolves the blennioids as monophyletic, a result not obtained in our previous large-scale studies.

Some of the most diverse orders (e.g., Perciformes, Labriformes, Lophiiformes, and Tetraodontiformes) and families (e.g., Labridae, Serranidae, and Scorpaenidae) of fishes are included in this group. Previous molecular studies obtained monophyletic groups with a combination of taxa here assigned to Eupercaria, but including far more limited sampling (e.g, [11, 58, 68, 69, 289]). Although most family-level and ordinal groups within this series receive high nodal support, interrelationships among them are largely unresolved – Eupercaria constitutes the “new bush at the top” [8]. The largest group within Eupercaria is the order Perciformes, as currently circumscribed.\n\nOrder-level incertae sedis in Eupercaria.\n\nComment: although we lack phylogenetic evidence, the family Parascorpididae, traditionally classified in “Perciformes”, is provisionally listed here; it is not placed in Perciformes, as currently circumscribed, given the long history of phylogenetic indistinctiveness between Percoidei, Perciformes, and Percomorpha [50, 51, 58].

[92]. JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42] also included in this order the families Callanthiidae, Lobotidae (including Datnioididae) and Sillaginidae. Our results do not support the placement of these three or four families in Spariformes.\n\nLethrinidae\n\nNemipteridae\n\nSparidae (includes the former Centracanthidae)\n\nOrder Priacanthiformes, new circumscription (98%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking, but implied by unspecified larval similarities (discussed by JM Leis and BM Carson-Ewart [295]).\n\nComments: a sister-group relationship between cepolids and priacanthids is strongly supported by other molecular studies (see also [295]).\n\nPriacanthidae\n\nCepolidae\n\nOrder Caproiformes (37%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking, but see F Santini and G Lecointre [299].\n\nComment: this order is herein recognized following JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42].\n\nCaproidae\n\nOrder Lophiiformes (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see TW Pietsch [300], TW Pietsch [301].\n\nComments: this order is the sister group of Tetraodontiformes (45% bootstrap).

Morphological synapomorphies for suborders are implied in several recent phylogenetic analyses of fossils and extant taxa (e.g., [23, 310, 311]).\n\nComments: Although interrelationships of major tetraodontiform lineages is controversial, several clades are congruent across studies. The subordinal classification proposed here differs from that by F Santini and JC Tyler [310], with many more suborders now recognized. Our scheme is robust to phylogenetic uncertainty and has recently been adopted by AF Bannikov, JC Tyler, D Arcila and G Carnevale [311].\n\nSuborder Triodontoidei\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: implied in various phylogenetic analyses by J.

Note that Y Tominaga [312] suggested that features of the cranium and swimbladder may be homologous in Pempheris and Glaucosoma; see also GD Johnson [50].\n\nComments: Although support for Pempheriformes is low, this clade has been obtained by several studies. Because Percophis brasiliensis (type species of Percophidae) is a Notothenioid [313], and the remaining “percophids” are in Pempheriformes, then the pempheriform “percophids” require family relocation. The subfamily Hemerocoetinae Kaup 1873 is now raised to the family level, following CE Thacker, TP Satoh, E Katayama, RC Harrington, RI Eytan and TJ Near [242]: “Additional proposed changes to the classification of Percomorpha include... recognition of Hemerocoetidae as a taxonomic family containing Matsubaraea, Enigmapercis, Pteropsaron, Acanthaphritis, and Osopsaron and the unsampled Dactylopsaron, Hemerocoetes, and Squamicreedia.” See comments under Order Gobiiformes for notes regarding the placement of Creediidae and Hemerocoetidae in Pempheriformes rather than Trachinoidei.\n\nAcropomatidae (not monophyletic in Fig. 2)\n\nBanjosidae\n\nBathyclupeidae\n\nChampsodontidae\n\nCreediidae\n\nEpigonidae\n\nGlaucosomatidae\n\nHowellidae\n\nLateolabracidae\n\nOstracoberycidae\n\nPempheridae\n\nPentacerotidae\n\n“Percophidae” (see comments)\n\nPolyprionidae\n\nSymphysanodontidae\n\nNot examined: Hemerocoetidae, Leptoscopidae (assumed affinity with Creediidae; see [314]).\n\nOrder Centrarchiformes (98%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking.\n\nComment: although the family name Cirrithidae Macleay 1841 is older than Centrarchidae Bleeker 1859, we retain the name Centrarchiformes for this order (in agreement with previous usage) but expand its membership following recent proposals [11, 315, 316].\n\nSuborder Centrarchoidei (93%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking.\n\nComments: inclusion of Enoploside in this suborder differs from the results obtained by S Lavoué, K Nakayama, DR Jerry, Y Yamanoue, N Yagishita, N Suzuki, M Nishida and M Miya [316]. Sinipercidae is recognized following C Li, G Orti and J Zhao [317] (formerly a synonym of Percichthyidae). As suggested by earlier classifications and confirmed by recent molecular studies (e.g., [318]), pygmy sunfishes (Elassoma) and sunfishes (centrarchids) are allied (placed in separate orders by EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57]).\n\nCentrarchidae\n\nElassomatidae\n\nEnoplosidae\n\nSinipercidae\n\nSuborder Cirrhitoidei (similar to Cirrhitoidea sensu PH Greenwood [319], and CP Burridge and AJ Smolenski [320]; treated as Cirrhitiformes in previous versions of the classification) (97%).\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see PH Greenwood [319].\n\nComment: the families Latridae, Chironemidae and Aplodactylidae are nested within Cheilodactylidae, rendering the latter non-monophyletic [92].\n\nAplodactylidae\n\nCheilodactylidae (not monophyletic in Fig. 2)\n\nChironemidae\n\nCirrhitidae\n\nLatridae\n\nSuborder Percichthyoidei (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: GD Johnson [59], but with a different circumscription (a series of nested synapomorphies uniting all members except Percalates).\n\nComment: percichthyoids and Percichthyidae sensu GD Johnson [59] are not monophyletic: the Australian species Percalates colonorum and Percalates novemaculeata are not closely related to other members of Percichthyidae [8, 315, 316], so these species are herein placed in their own suborder [P. Unmack pers. comm.; 317]. Percalates is listed as a junior synonym of Macquaria by WN Eschmeyer [60], but the type species of Macquaria (M. australasica) is closely related to other species of Macquaria (M. ambigua) within Percichthyidae sensu stricto, thus both are valid genus names [P. Unmack pers. comm.; 317]. Percichthyidae sensu stricto includes Percilia (formerly placed in its own family, Perciliidae).\n\nPercichthyidae\n\nSuborder Percalatoidei (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking.\n\nComment: formal description of a new family for Percalates is required to comply with the ICZN.\n\n“Percalatidae” (see comment)\n\nSuborder Terapontoidei (= Clade “h2” of N Yagishita, M Miya, Y Yamanoue, SM Shirai, K Nakayama, N Suzuki, TP Satoh, K Mabuchi, M Nishida and T Nakabo [321]; = Terapontiformes in previous versions of the classification) (99%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking for current circumscription. GD Johnson and RA Fritzsche [322] cite nerve pattern evidence uniting all but one of the families listed here (Dichistiidae) plus other groups currently placed in Pelagiaria (Arripdidae and stromateoids).\n\nComment: The families Girellidae, Microcanthidae and Scorpididae are herein recognized following several recent studies [321, 323,324,325,326,327]; these are listed as subfamilies of Kyphosidae in R Van Der Laan, WN Eschmeyer and R Fricke [62] and JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42].\n\nDichistiidae\n\nGirellidae\n\nKuhliidae\n\nKyphosidae\n\nOplegnathidae\n\nTerapontidae\n\nNot examined: Microcanthidae, Scorpididae.\n\nOrder Perciformes (= Serraniformes sensu B Li, A Dettai, C Cruaud, A Couloux, M Desoutter-Meniger and G Lecointre [80], and A-C Lautredou, H Motomura, C Gallut, C Ozouf-Costaz, C Cruaud, G Lecointre and A Dettai [328]) (93%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking.\n\nComments: although Perciformes has been traditionally regarded as a “taxonomic waste basket” (e.g., [41, 42, 50, 51, 57,58,59]), the first version of this classification [8] proposed for the first time a monophyletic definition of the order based on robust molecular analyses. Compared to classification by other authors, the revised circumscription of Perciformes reduces significantly the number of included taxa, while retaining remarkable diversity that is now organized into several suborders and infraorders. Our definition comprises 61 perciform families, including species assigned by previous classifications to the orders Scorpaeniformes, Cottiformes, and Trachiniformes (no longer validated as orders herein).\n\nSuborder Bembropoidei, new (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking.\n\nComment: This suborder is newly classified to accommodate the family Bembropidae. Bembropidae is recognized following WL Smith and MT Craig [58]; it is a synonym of Percophidae according to R Van Der Laan, WN Eschmeyer and R Fricke [62].\n\nBembropidae\n\nSuborder Normanichthyoidei\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see M Yabe, and T. Uyeno. [329].\n\nComment: this suborder is classified following R Van Der Laan, WN Eschmeyer and R Fricke [62] and JS Nelson, T Grande and MVH Wilson [42].\n\nNot examined: Normanichthyidae.\n\nSuborder Serranoidei (64%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see GD Johnson [330], C Baldwin and GD Johnson [331], but with a different circumscription (including Niphon).\n\nComments: we do not recognize Epinephelidae as a separate family, following WL Smith and MT Craig [58] and KY Ma, MT Craig, JH Choat and L van Herwerden [332]. The main justification for such nomenclatural change was that Smith and Craig’s phylogenetic analysis failed to resolve the monophyly of serranids (including epinephelines, anthiines and serranines); however, they did not conduct a topology test to ask whether this null hypothesis is rejected by their data. Our large-scale analysis supports the monophyly of Serranidae (excluding Niphon; see comments under Percoidei below), albeit with low support. Also, while elevating Epinephelinae to family is a minor nomenclatural change, this rearrangement creates confusion for fish managers and conservation biologists given the commercial importance of groupers and the endangered status of many species.\n\nSerranidae\n\nSuborder Percoidei, restricted circumscription (99%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking.\n\nComments: A-C Lautredou, H Motomura, C Gallut, C Ozouf-Costaz, C Cruaud, G Lecointre and A Dettai [328] obtained a clade uniting Percidae and Trachinidae with full support, based on the analysis of seven nuclear markers. Like with Perciformes, the restricted and monophyletic circumscription of Percoidei in this classification contrasts markedly with the long history of confusion regarding the limits and polyphyly of Percoidei (e.g., [50, 51, 58, 59]). Removal of Niphon from Serranidae (e.g., as in [330, 331]) and placement in its own family (Niphonidae) is consistent with several other studies (e.g., [58, 333]).\n\nNiphonidae\n\nPercidae\n\nNot examined: Trachinidae.\n\nSuborder Notothenioidei (= Nototheniiformes in EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57]) (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: see PA Hastings [334], EO Wiley and GD Johnson [57] (but with a different circumscription; see comment below).\n\nComment: Percophidae is herein placed in Notothenioidei following TJ Near, A Dornburg, RC Harrington, C Oliveira, TW Pietsch, CE Thacker, TP Satoh, E Katayama, PC Wainwright, JT Eastman, et al. [313]; see comments above under Pempheriformes.\n\nArtedidraconidae\n\nBathydraconidae (not monophyletic here; but see [335])\n\nBovichtidae\n\nChannichthyidae\n\nEleginopsidae\n\nHarpagiferidae\n\nNototheniidae (not monophyletic in Fig. 2)\n\nPseudaphritidae\n\nNot ex amined: Percophidae.\n\nSuborder Scorpaenoidei (72%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking. Phylogenetic analysis on all or part of various scorpaenoid families (e.g., [336,337,338]) vary to a greater or lesser degree than the results presented here.\n\nComment: nine families now included in Scorpaenoidei were listed in previous versions of this classification as not examined under Perciformes. See also H Imamura [336].\n\nScorpaenidae (not monophyletic in Fig. 2)\n\nSebastidae\n\nSetarchidae\n\nSynanceiidae\n\nTetrarogidae\n\nNot examined: Apistidae, Aploactinidae, Congiopodidae, Eschmeyeridae, Gnathanacanthidae, Neosebastidae, Pataecidae, Perryenidae (see [339]), Zanclorhynchidae.\n\nSuborder Platycephaloidei (= Bembroidei in previous versions) (26%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: lacking (see comments).\n\nComment: previous versions of this classification included Bembridae and Parabembridae in the suborder Bembroidei, which we now expand to also include Hoplichthyidae, Platycephalidae and Plectrogeniidae (previously listed as suborder-level incertae sedis in Perciformes) – a well-supported clade in our analysis (100% BS). We now name this taxon Platycephaloidei in accordance to other classifications (e.g., [336, 340]). Note that the family composition differs from that in other studies as Peristediidae and Triglidae are herein placed in a different suborder (Triglioidei).\n\nBembridae\n\nHoplichthyidae\n\nParabembridae\n\nPlatycephalidae\n\nNot examined: Plectrogeniidae (see [336]).\n\nSuborder Triglioidei sensu DS Jordan [341] (100%)\n\nMorphological diagnosis: SA Mandrytsa [338] presents synapomorphies; other results by H Imamura [336], and H Imamura [340] differ significantly from ours.\n\nPeristediidae\n\nTriglidae\n\nSuborder Cottoidei (= Cottimorpha sensu Li, A Dettai, C Cruaud, A Couloux, M Desoutter-Meniger and G Lecointre [80]) (100%)\n\nMorphological synapomorphies: H Imamura, S Shirai and M Yabe [342].\n\nComment: we have chosen to recognize clades within this suborder as infraorders, adopting the ending “–ales” for this rank.

We now split it into two families (formerly subfamilies): Hexagrammidae (sensu stricto) and Zaniolepididae [345,346,347].
