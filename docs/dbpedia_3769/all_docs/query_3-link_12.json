        "text": "We are investigating the order in which traits related to body elongation evolved in eels.\n\nThis project asks whether the traits that give true eels (Anguilliformes) their elongated body shape evolved in the same order among eel genera. These traits includeÂ various measures of the axial skeleton and the position of internal organs.\n\nWe are examining the Museum's eel specimens using x-ray radiography to collect quantitative data on their body structure.\n\nQuantifying how traits related to elongation have evolved across the order should give us a greater understanding of the evolutionary history of Anguilliformes. It should also improve our understanding of convergent evolution.\n\nConverging on elongation\n\nElongated body shapes have evolved independently numerous times across the tree of life. Besides Anguilliformes, other clades with eel-like morphologies include:\n\nother types of fish, including hagfish, lampreys, bichirs, spiny eels, eeltail catfish, knifefishes, electric eels, black dragonfishes, false brotulas, swamp eels, tube blennies and wormfishes\n\nPalaeozoic tetrapods such as nectridians, lysorophids, adelogyrinids and aÃ¯stopods\n\nsnakes, caecilians and several species of lizard\n\nOf these, true eels are an excellent model to study. They have demonstrated multiple ways of elongating â from adding vertebrae in different areas along the body axis, to changes in the sizes of the vertebrae, or some combination of the two.\n\nThey have also evolved a great variety of forms, including the long and slender snipe eel (Nemichthys), the more robust conger eel (Conger) and the large-mouthed pelican eel (Eurypharynx).\n\nThe project could improve our understanding of the convergent evolution of elongated body shapes across taxa."
