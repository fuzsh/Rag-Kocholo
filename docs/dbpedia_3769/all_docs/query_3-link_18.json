        "text": "Eels undergo considerable development from the early larval stage to the eventual adult stage and are usually predators. The term “Eel” is also used for some other Eel-shaped fish, such as electric Eels (genus Electrophorus), spiny Eels (family Mastacembelidae), swamp Eels (family Synbranchidae), and deep-sea spiny Eels (family Notacanthidae). These other clades, however, evolved their Eel-like shapes independently from the true Eels. Eels live both in salt water and fresh water and some species are catadromous.\n\nMost Eels live in the shallow waters of the ocean and burrow into sand, mud, or amongst rocks. A majority of Eel species are nocturnal, thus are rarely seen. Sometimes, they are seen living together in holes, or “Eel pits”. Some species of Eels also live in deeper water on the continental shelves and over the slopes deep as 4,000 m (13,000 ft). Only members of the Anguilla regularly inhabit fresh water, but they, too, return to the sea to breed. The heaviest true Eel is the European conger. The maximum size of this species has been reported as reaching a length of 3 m (10 ft) and a weight of 110 kg (240 lb). Other Eels are longer but do not weigh as much, such as the slender giant moray which reaches 4 m (13 ft)."
